The two sects founded by Sáurí and Zaharí became extinct in     the eighth century of the Hijra. The other four still remain. These men     venerated one another. The younger ones speak with great respect of the     elder. Thus Sháfa'í said:--\"No one in the world was so well versed in     jurisprudence as Abu Hanífa was, and he who has read neither his works,     nor those of his disciples knows nothing of jurisprudence.\" Hanbal when     sick wore a shirt which had belonged to Sháfa'í, in order that he might     be cured of his malady; but all this {34} did not prevent them starting     schools of their own, for the right of Ijtihád is granted to those who     are real Mujtahidín. There are three degrees of Ijtihád.      1. Al-Ijtihád fi'l Shari': absolute independence in legislation      2. Al-Ijtihád fi'l Mazhab: authority in the judicial systems founded by     the Mujtahidín of the first class.      3. Al-Ijtihád fi'l Masáil: authority in cases which have not been     decided by the authors of the four systems of jurisprudence.      The first is called a complete and absolute authority, the second     relative, the third special.      THE FIRST DEGREE OF IJTIHÁD.      Absolute independence in legislation is the gift of God. He to whom it     is given when seeking to discover the meaning of the Divine Law is not     bound to follow any other teacher. He can use his own judgment. This     gift was bestowed on the jurisconsults of the first, and to some in the     second and third centuries. The Companions, however, who were closely     connected with the Prophet, having transmitted immediately to their     posterity the treasures of legislation, are looked upon as Mujtahidín     of much higher authority than those of the second and third centuries.     Thus Abu Hanífa says:--\"That which comes to us from the Companions is     on our head and eyes (_i.e._, to be received with respect): as to that     which comes from the Tábi'ín, they are men and we are men.\"      Since the time of the Tábi'ín this degree of Ijtihád has only been     conferred on the six great Imáms. Theoretically any Muslim can attain     to this degree, but it is one of the principles of jurisprudence that     the confirmation of this rank is dependent on many conditions, and so     no one now gains the honour. These conditions are:--      1. The knowledge of the Qurán and all that is related to it; that is to     say, a complete knowledge of Arabic literature, a profound acquaintance     with the orders of the Qurán and all their sub-divisions, their     relationship to each other and their connection with the orders of the     Sunnat. The candidate should know when, and why each verse of the Qurán     was written, he should have a perfect acquaintance with the literal     meaning of the words, the speciality or generality of each clause, the     abrogating and abrogated sentences. He should be able to make clear the     meaning of the 'obscure' passages (Mutashábih), to discriminate between     the literal and the allegorical, the universal and the particular.      2. He must know the Qurán by heart with all the Traditions and     explanations. {35}      3. He must have a perfect knowledge of the Traditions, or at least of     three thousand of them.      He must know their source, history, object and their connection with     the laws of the Qurán. He should know by heart the most important     Traditions.      4. A pious and austere life.      5. A profound knowledge of all the sciences of the Law.      Should any one _now_ aspire to such a degree another condition would be     added, _viz_:--      6. A complete knowledge of the four schools of jurisprudence.      The obstacles, then, are almost insurmountable. On the one hand, there     is the severity of the 'Ulamá, which requires from the candidate things     almost impossible; on the other, there is the attachment of the 'Ulamá     to their own Imáms, for should such a man arise no one is bound now to     listen to him. Imám Hanbal said:--\"Draw your knowledge from whence the     Imáms drew theirs, and do not content yourself with following others     for that is certainly blindness of sight\". Thus the schools of the four     Imáms remain intact after a thousand years have passed, and so the     'Ulamá recognise since the time of these Imáms no Mujtahíd of the first     degree. Ibn Hanbal was the last.      The rights of the man who attained to this degree were very important.     He was not bound to be a disciple of another, he was a mediator between     the Law and his followers, for whom he established a system of     legislation, without any one having the right to make any objection. He     had the right to explain the Qurán, the Sunnat and the Ijmá' according     as he understood them. He used the Prophet's words, whilst his     disciples only used his. Should a disciple find some discrepancy     between a decision of his own Imám and the Qurán or Traditions, he must     abide by the decision of the Imám. The Law does not permit him to     interpret after his own fashion. When once the disciple has entered the     sect of one Imám he cannot leave it and join another. He loses the     right of private judgment, for only a Mujtahid of the first class can     dispute the decision of one of the Imáms. Theoretically such Mujtahidín     may still arise; but, as we have already shown, practically they do     not.      THE SECOND DEGREE OF IJTIHÁD.      This degree has been granted to the immediate disciples of the great     Imáms who have elaborated the systems of their masters. They enjoyed     the special consideration of the contemporary 'Ulamá, and of their     respective Imáms who in some cases have allowed them {36} to retain     their own opinion.' The most famous of these men are the two disciples     of Abu Hanífa, Abu Yúsuf and Muhammad bin al Hasan. In a secondary     matter their opinion carries great weight. It is laid down as a rule     that a Muftí may follow the unanimous opinion of these two even when it     goes against that of Abu Hanífa.      THE THIRD DEGREE OF IJTIHÁD.      This is the degree of special independence. The candidates for it     should have a perfect knowledge of all the branches of jurisprudence     according to the four schools of the Arabic language and literature.     They can solve cases which come before them, giving reasons for their     judgment, or decide on cases which have not been settled by previous     Mujtahidín; but in either case their decisions must always be in     absolute accordance with the opinions of the Mujtahidín of the first     and second classes, and with the principles which guided them. Many of     these men attained great celebrity during their lifetime, but to most     of them this rank is not accorded till after their death. Since Imám     Qází Khán died (A.H. 592), no one has been recognised by the Sunnís as     a Mujtahid even of the third class.      There are three other inferior classes of jurists, called Muqallidín,     or followers of the Mujtahidín; but all that the highest in rank     amongst them can do is to explain obscure passages in the writings of     the older jurisconsults. By some of the 'Ulamá they are considered to     be equal to the Mujtahidín of the third class. If there are several     conflicting legal opinions on any point, they can select one opinion on     which to base their decision. This a mere Qází cannot do. In such a     case he would have to refer to those men, or to their writings for     guidance. They seem to have written commentaries on the legal systems     without originating anything new. The author of the Hidáyah, who lived     at the end of the sixth century, was a Muqallid.      Such is Mirza Kázim Beg's account. The whole article, of which I have     only given the main points, is worthy of the closest study. It shows     how \"the system, as a whole, rejects experience as a guide to deeper     insight or wider knowledge; tramples upon the teaching of the past;     pays no heed to differences of climate, character, or history; but     regards itself as a body of absolute truth, one jot or tittle of which     cannot be rejected without incurring the everlasting wrath of God.\"[40]  {37}         *       *       *       *       *   CHAPTER II.  EXEGESIS OF THE QURÁN AND THE TRADITIONS.  The following account of this branch of Muslim theology, technically called 'Ilm-i-Usúl, may be introduced by a few remarks on the nature of inspiration according to Islám, though that is not strictly speaking a portion of this study.  There are two terms used to express different degrees of inspiration, Wahí and Ilhám. Wahí is the term applied to the inspiration of the Qurán, and implies that the very words are the words of God. It is divided into Wahí Záhir (external inspiration), and Wahí Bátin (internal inspiration). The whole book was prepared in heaven. Muhammad, instructed by Gabriel, is simply the medium through which the revelation of Wahí Záhir reaches man. The Wahí Qurán, _i.e._, the highest form of inspiration, always came to the ear of the Prophet through the instrumentality of Gabriel. In Muhammadan theology, this is the special work of Gabriel. Thus in the Traditions it is related that he appeared to Adam twelve times, to Enoch four, to Noah fifty, to Abraham forty-two, to Moses four hundred, to Jesus ten times, to Muhammad twenty-four thousand times.  Ilhám means the inspiration given to a saint or to a prophet when he, though rightly guided, delivers the subject matter out of his own mind, and is not a mere machine to reproduce the messages of Gabriel. There is a lower form of Wahí Záhir, which is called Ishárat-ul-Malak (literally, \"sign of the Angel.\") This expresses what Muhammad meant when he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],["title","The Faith of Islam (#8)"],["body","aid: \"The Holy Ghost has entered into my heart.\" In other words, he received the inspiration through {38} Gabriel, but not by word of mouth. This form of inspiration is higher than that possessed by saints, and is usually applied to the inspiration of the Traditions. This is denied by some, who say that except when delivering the Qurán Muhammad spoke by Ilhám and not by Wahí. The practical belief is, however, that the Traditions were Wahí inspiration, and thus they come to be as authoritative as the Qurán. Sharastani speaks of \"the signs (sayings) of the Prophet which have the marks of Wahí.\"[41] This opinion is said by some Muslim theologians to be supported by the first verse of the fifty-third Súra, entitled the Star. \"By the Star when it setteth; your companion Muhammad _erreth not_, nor is he _led astray_, neither doth he _speak of his own will_. It is none other than a revelation which hath been revealed to him.\" In any case the inspiration of Muhammad is something quite different from the Christian idea of inspiration, which is to Musalmáns a very imperfect mode of transmitting a revelation of God's will.  That there should be a human as well as a divine side to inspiration is an idea not only foreign, but absolutely repugnant to Muhammadans. The Qurán is not a book of principles. It is a book of directions. The Qurán describes the revelation given to Moses thus:--\"We wrote for him upon the tables a monition concerning every matter and said: 'Receive them thyself with steadfastness, and command thy people to receive them for the observance of its most goodly precepts.'\" (Súra vii. 142). It is such an inspiration as this the Qurán claims for itself. Muhammad's idea was that it should be a complete and final code of directions in every matter for all mankind. It is not the word of a prophet enlightened by God. It proceeds immediately from God, and the word 'say' or 'speak' precedes, or is understood to precede, every sentence. This to a Muslim is the highest form of inspiration; this alone stamps a book as {39} divine. It is acknowledged that the Injíl--the Gospel--was given by Jesus; but as that, too, according to Muslim belief, was brought down from heaven by the angel Gabriel during the month of Ramazán, it is now asserted that it has been lost, and that the four Gospels of the New Testament are simply Traditions collected by the writers whose names they bear. Their value is, therefore, that of the second foundation of the Islámic system.  The question next arises as to the exact way in which Gabriel made known his message to Muhammad. The Mudárij-un-Nabuwat, a standard theological work, gives some details on this point.[42] Though the Qurán is all of God, both as to matter and form, yet it was not all made known to the Prophet in one and the same manner. The following are some of the modes:--  1. It is recorded on the authority of 'Áyesha, one of Muhammad's wives, that a brightness like the brightness of the morning came upon the Prophet. According to some commentators this brightness remained six months. In some mysterious way Gabriel, through this brightness or vision, made known the will of God.  2. Gabriel appeared in the form of Dahiah, one of the Companions of the Prophet, renowned for his beauty and gracefulness. A learned dispute has arisen with regard to the abode of the soul of Gabriel when he assumed the bodily form of Dahiah. At times, the angelic nature of Gabriel overcame Muhammad, who was then translated to the world of angels. This always happened when the revelation was one of bad news, such as denunciations or predictions of woe. At other times, when the message brought by Gabriel was one of consolation and comfort, the human nature of the Prophet overcame the angelic nature of the angel, who, in such case, having assumed a human form, proceeded to deliver the message. {40}  3. The Prophet heard at times the noise of the tinkling of a bell. To him alone was known the meaning of the sound. He alone could distinguish in, and through it, the words which Gabriel wished him to understand. The effect of this mode of Wahí was more marvellous than that of any of the other ways. When his ear caught the sound his whole frame became agitated. On the coldest day, the perspiration, like beads of silver, would roll down his face. The glorious brightness of his countenance gave place to a ghastly hue, whilst the way in which he bent down his head showed the intensity of the emotion through which he was passing. If riding, the camel on which he sat would fall to the ground. The Prophet one day, when reclining with his head in the lap of Zeid, heard the well known sound: Zeid, too, knew that something unusual was happening, for so heavy became the head of Muhammad that it was with the greatest difficulty he could support the weight.  4. At the time of the Mi'ráj, or night ascent into heaven, God spoke to the Prophet without the intervention of an angel. It is a disputed point whether the face of the Lord was veiled or not.  5. God sometimes appeared in a dream, and placing his hands on the Prophet's shoulders made known his will.  6. Twice, angels having each six hundred wings, appeared and brought the message from God.  7. Gabriel, though not appearing in bodily form, so inspired the heart of the Prophet that the words he uttered under its influence were the words of God. This is technically called Ilká, and is by some supposed to be the degree of inspiration to which the Traditions belong.  Above all, the Prophet was not allowed to remain in any error; if, by any chance, he had made a wrong deduction from any previous revelation, another was always sent to rectify it. This idea has been worked up to a science of abrogation, according to which some verses of the Qurán abrogate others. Muhammad found it necessary to shift {41} his stand-point more than once, and thus it became necessary to annul earlier portions of his revelation.  Thus in various ways was the revelation made known to Muhammad. At first there seems to have been a season of doubt (Ante p. 3), the dread lest after all it might be a mockery. But as years rolled on confidence in himself and in his mission came. At times, too, there is a joyousness in his utterances as he swears by heaven and earth, by God and man; but more often the visions were weird and terrible. Tradition says:--\"He roared like a camel, the sound as of bells well-nigh rent his heart in pieces.\" Some strange power moved him, his fear was uncontrollable. For twenty years or more the revelations came, a direction on things of heaven and of earth, to the Prophet as the spiritual guide of all men,[43] to the Warrior-Chief, as the founder of political unity among the Arab tribes.  A Muhammadan student, after passing through a course of instruction in grammar, rhetoric, logic, law, and dogmatics, at length reaches the stage when he is permitted to enter upon the study of \"'Ilm-i-usúl,\" or the exegesis of the Qurán, and the inspired sayings of the Prophet. This done, he can henceforth read the approved commentaries in order to learn what the Fathers of Islám have to say. This science in one way fits him to be a commentator, for the work of a Muslim divine now is, not to bring things \"new and old\" out of the sacred book, but to hand down to others the things old. There is no indwelling spirit in the Church of Islám which can reveal to the devout mind new views of truth, or lead the pious scholar on to deeper and more profound knowledge.  The greatest proficient in theology is the man who can repeat the Qurán by heart, who knows also and can reproduce at will what the early commentators have said, who can remember, and quote in the most apposite manner, the {42} Prophet's sayings preserved in the Traditions handed down by the Companions, their followers, and their followers' followers, who can point out a flaw in the Isnád (_i.e._ chain of narrators) of a Tradition quoted by an opponent, or maintain, by repeating the long list of names, the authority of the Isnád of the Tradition he quotes himself. A good memory, not critical acumen, is the great desideratum in a Muslim theologian. The chief qualification of a Háfiz, a man who can repeat the whole Qurán by heart, is not that he shall understand its meaning, but that he shall be able to pronounce each word correctly. By men who are not Arabs by birth, this is only to be attained after years of practice from childhood. The Sunnís say that no Shía'h can ever become a Háfiz, from which fact they draw the conclusion that the Shía'hs are heretics. In the early days of Islám, the great authorities on the question of the correct pronunciation of the Qurán were the Khalífs Abu Bakr, Omar, Osmán, and 'Alí, and ten of the Companions, who learned from the Prophet himself the exact way in which Gabriel had spoken. The Arabic of heaven was the Arabic of Islám. The effort, however, to preserve one uniform method of repeating the Qurán failed. Men of other lands could not acquire the pure intonation of Mecca, and so no less than seven different ways of reading the sacred book became current. Here was a great difficulty, but it proved surmountable. Abu Ibn Káb, one of the Companions, had become so famous as a reader that the Prophet himself said: \"read the Qurán under Abu Ibn Káb.\" These men remembered that Abu Ibn Káb had stated, that one day when scandalized at man after man who entered the mosque repeating the Qurán in different ways, he spoke to Muhammad about it. His Highness said: \"O Abu Ibn Káb! intelligence was sent to me to read the Qurán in one dialect, and I was attentive to the Court of God, and said: 'make easy the reading of the Qurán to my sects.' These instructions were sent to me a second time saying: 'read the {43} Qurán in two dialects.' Then I turned myself to the Court of God saying: 'make easy the reading of the Qurán to my sects.' Then a voice was sent to me the third time saying: 'read the Qurán in seven dialects.'\""]]]
