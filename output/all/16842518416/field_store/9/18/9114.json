On the other hand, weapons are necessary, which take time to construct. If, however, it is thought advisable, we might make a trip of explorations along the South River, beyond the falls, the time to be limited to a week; but I have my doubts of the wisdom of such a course.\"  This suggestion appealed strongly to the boys, who were always keen for anything which savored of adventure, and it was some time before the boys could reconcile themselves to the saner and more business-like course of completing the boat and making the trip by water.  The weather was beautiful, and vegetation was springing up in abundant profusion everywhere. Magnificent showers fell at intervals, and the rainbows, more beautiful than any they had ever heretofore seen, spanned the heavens after the showers.  This had been noticed during the previous year, but now, after nine months of their life, with the wonderful insight which their needs had instilled into them, made them very observant of every phenomenon.  \"I have often wondered,\" observed George, as he gazed at the beautiful broad band which formed a crescent across the heavens, \"why there are never any rainbows in the middle of the day. They are never seen except in the morning or in the evening, and usually only in the evening.\"  \"In order to understand that it will be necessary to explain what a rainbow is. As I stated previously, light is merely vibration. Now colors are formed by the different lengths of the vibrations, just the same as the different musical notes are made by the different vibratory lengths. To understand this more fully, I make a sketch (Fig. 7), which shows just what I mean. You will see that red is the lowest musical pitch, which we will call C, and to the right is a long, wavy line. D, the next pitch higher, might resemble orange, with the wavy line a little shorter, and so on, until we reach the highest note in the scale, where the wave lengths are very short. You have probably noticed that a drop of water in the sunshine glistens, and, if closely observed, may have seen that it was colored, particularly blue or green. As the rays of the sun strike the globe of water, they produce different wave lengths, and in that way make it appear to you as being possessed of colors. Now, a rainbow is nothing more nor less than sunlight passing through the drops of water which are suspended in the air and causing a refraction of the light. At noon the sun shines down from overhead, and we are not in the proper position to see this refracted light; but in the morning or in the evening the sun shines against the earth at an angle. At those times we are able to see the effect of refraction by the colors produced.  [Illustration: _Fig. 7. THE COLOR SPECTRUM_]  [Illustration: _Fig. 8. REFLECTION ANGLE_]  \"When you throw a ball against a wall at an angle, it bounds away at the same angle. That is reflection, and is just exactly what light does when a ray strikes a mirror. If, on the other hand, the glass had no mercury on it to reflect the light, the ray would not go straight through, but would bend, just as you have seen a stick in a glass of water appearing as though it was bent below the water line. That is refraction.\"  Two weeks of very vigorous work had now been put in since the yaks had disappeared, and the wagon was still at the edge of the forest. George was anxious to recover it, with the new team, and with Harry started out early in the morning to make up as much as possible lost time, as every hour was considered valuable in their enterprises.  The yaks could be ridden as well as horses, but the greater part of the way were driven. One of the guns which had been completed was taken along, as well as the only pistol which the Professor had saved. In less than three hours the forest was reached and they were soon within sight of the wagon.  \"What have we there?\" cried Harry, as they neared the spot.  \"Our yaks! And where do you suppose they have been?\"  Close by the wagon were the yaks, as though patiently waiting for the boys. They made no resistance, nor show of fright, when the boys approached. One of them, Jack, still had the strap tied to the horns, and it was the halter which had been attached to the tree at South River.  A hasty examination was made, but if either of the boys came to any conclusion concerning it, nothing was said. Without wasting time, the team brought with them was yoked up and the broken wheel replaced by a new one. The repairs to the wagon tongue did not take long, and they were ready for the return.  \"What shall we do with Jack and Jill?\" Those were the names bestowed on the first team. \"Let us see if they will follow us.\"  They had gone fully one hundred feet before the yaks made any sign, and then slowly followed, thus assuring them that no care or attention would be required in that direction. Both boys were intensely delighted at the recovery of their favorites and could not get home fast enough to give the Professor the good news.  Nearing home, the Professor, who was on the watch, came out to meet them, waving his hat at the sight of Jack and Jill. When the latter came up he went over and affectionately petted the creatures, who seemed to realize the welcome.  \"I hope they are as glad as we are; I can understand why they got away; look at the end of this thong.\" It plainly showed the teeth of some animal which had gnawed the leather of which it was made.  \"So you have been out prospecting, too?\" was Harry's query, as he saw the queer-looking reeds on the table in the laboratory that evening. \"What do you call that?\"  \"Our honey has been getting low, and I took the occasion to-day to bring in some samples of sugar.\"  \"Is that sugar cane?\"  \"Yes; the true sugar cane.\"  \"Is that different from sorghum?\"  \"This is the species which grows in the southern part of the United States. The kind you know and which is cultivated in the Northern States, is the Chinese Sorgo, or, as we call it, sorghum. It is equal in quality and in quantity to the southern species and is readily treated to produce molasses or sugar.\"  \"What is that peculiar flower, if it is a flower? I never saw a flower like that; it seems to be hard.\"  \"I was surprised to find this. It is called the Tamarisk. This long, oval-shaped part is made by an insect which inhabits the plant, and is eaten by the inhabitants in the plains east of the Mediterranean Sea. It is there called Mount Sinai Manna, and is supposed to be the Manna which the Jews found when they were in the Wilderness after the Exodus.\"  \"I think we have properly named this place Wonder Island.\"  In the volume preceding this, when they first considered the building of a new boat, it was decided to graft an extension to the after part of their wrecked lifeboat; but when the second one was found, and calculations were made as to its usefulness, it was discovered that such a course would not be wise; hence the larger vessel was found to be the only solution.  The newly discovered boat was, however, a valuable addition, as it afforded a means by which short trips could be made, and Harry quietly set to work making a sail and rigging up a mast, so that the long-cherished desire to make these trips could be undertaken before they were ready to launch the real vessel. It was hauled up on shore and caulked and new parts added to make it adaptable for the purpose.  While engaged at this work he removed the cross seat which still remained, and in doing so was surprised to find a piece of cardboard which had been hidden, apparently, at the end of the board. Eagerly picking it up, he saw writing on it, with the following words: \"We cannot hold out much longer. Wright and Walters were captured yesterday. WILL.\"  [Illustration: _Fig. 9. THE HIDDEN MESSAGE_]  Harry could hardly contain himself, as he rushed up to the laboratory, crying out: \"George, come here, quickly! I have found something!\" Without waiting to see whether George heard, he rushed into the Professor's den with the paper in his outstretched hand. \"Look at this; don't you remember Will Sayers? I am sure it is Will.\"  George heard his excited voice, and appeared without any delay.  \"What is it now?\"  The Professor was reading the scrap, and silently handed it to George. \"Did you know either of the boys mentioned in this?\"  Neither had any recollection of Wright or Walters, but they inferred that the writer must be Will Sayers, one of the companions. The Professor had no recollection of the boy, nor could he remember the other names.  \"Let us examine every part of the boat,\" was the Professor's first suggestion. \"We may find something more to give some clue.\"  The boys rushed down to the beach where the boat was moored, the Professor following.  \"Show us the exact location of this strip.\"  \"I had just taken off this cross seat, and as I did so this piece fell from the end.\"  \"Let us put it back again and see how it fits into that place.\"  When it was replaced they noticed that a crack was left at each end of the seat, not exceeding an eighth of an inch.  \"It is very plain that the piece you found was at this end, and if it was folded as this crease indicates, it could have been concealed there and thus escaped our observation.\" After some minutes' examination, he continued: \"This piece must have been there for some time.\"  \"Why do you think so?\"  \"You will notice that the end of the board has the marks of the folded paper, showing it must have been in its place of concealment for some time. Furthermore, the paper itself indicates that it has been there for some time, by the discoloration on its outer side.\"  \"How long do you think it may have been there?\"  \"It is impossible to say; but certainly for several months.\"  \"Doesn't it seem reasonable,\" Harry inquired, \"to think it was some one from the _Investigator_? Otherwise, how is it that they had possession of the boat?\"  \"That is the problem we shall now have to find out.\"  Thus, in another direction, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20614"],["title","The Wonder Island Boys: The Mysteries of the Caverns (#6)"],["body","found an evidence that savages were on the island and that others had been wrecked and found a refuge there. How much of a refuge it was to them they had no means of knowing. They were thankful their own lives had been preserved and had been permitted to accomplish so much during their enforced stay.  \"We are now vigorous and strong and have been blessed with energy as well as health. It is our first duty to take up the task of finding our comrades, whatever the cost may be. If that is your view, we should proceed with that determination, but let us prepare for it in the best manner possible. How long will it take to finish the six guns you are now at?\" said the Professor, looking at Harry.  \"I will try to have them ready within another week,\" was his reply.  \"In the meantime, George and I will prepare a new lot of powder; and for your further information, I will state that I have been busy during the past week in making preparations to extract some lead for bullets.\"  This announcement was hailed with joy. Heretofore they had to depend on the iron slugs which had been turned out, and they were not at all satisfactory, because they lacked the proper weight.  \"Which is the lead?\" asked George, who was examining the samples.  \"It is this bluish-gray sample of galena, which, as you see, looks like lead itself, and is often mistaken for it; but it is far from being lead of the kind we can work.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because it is in what is called a sulphide form. Do you remember what a sulphide is?\"  \"Yes; it is where it is in combination with something.\"  \"That is a fairly good definition. More or less sulphur is found in all metals, but when found in large quantities the ore is called a sulphide.\"  \"How can we get rid of the sulphur?\"  \"We can cook it and drive it off like steam. Lead melts at a low temperature, comparatively, about 600 degrees Fahrenheit, so that with our furnaces it will be a very easy matter to get a pure lead.\"  During the rest of the day all were in the laboratory, superintending the preparation for the work, and at the Professor's suggestion the boys took the team in the morning and brought in over a hundred pounds of galena to be treated.  Before noon they had forty pounds of a very fine quality lead, and the work of making molds for the bullets was begun. The Professor, however, suggested that the boys should devote their time to the construction of the boat and guns, and it was difficult to decide what was the proper thing to do first.  The Professor saw the dilemma and had a very earnest conference on the subject.  \"You must not, by any means, be carried away with undue eagerness and a desire for haste. The first essential of good business is to do everything in order. It is better to plan carefully every step in advance, so that you will know just when your energies will be required for the next step. An eminent engineer, on one occasion, in answer to a question as to why he was always prepared for an emergency, laid down this rule: Whenever you have a problem to solve, work it out in more ways than one. If one fails, you can apply the other immediately. This can be done without a moment's delay. Therein lies the answer--preparedness.\"  The boys readily saw the force of the lesson. From that time on it was not necessary to direct the order of events. Each saw to it that the part allotted to him was carried out in a determined spirit.     CHAPTER IV  THE TERRIBLE MONSOONS   Of the two most urgent articles, namely, weapons or the boat, it was decided that the guns should be completed first. The feeling that the time would come when a visit from the savages might be expected at their home, contributed to this decision.  Six barrels, each eighteen inches long, and with a bore three-eighths of an inch in diameter, had been turned out, and several of the stocks had been made at odd times during the evenings. As Harry had sufficient steel left for four barrels more, two days were devoted to boring them out, in the hope that they would ultimately be able to finish them up. They would then have a battery of ten guns, and the necessity of having a number arose from the fact that they were muzzle-loaders, and could not be reloaded rapidly.  A sketch of the gun with the firing mechanism is furnished, in which it will be seen that the firing plug travels in a bore formed through the stock; in a line with the barrel. This plug had an upwardly extending finger, so it could be drawn back against the resistance of the spring. Below the plug was a trigger, with a hook-shaped forward end, in such a position that when the plug was drawn back the hook would catch and hold the plug until the lower right-angled projection of the trigger was pulled back. This would release the plug, and the spring would then be driven forward and explode the cap.  [Illustration: _Fig. 10. THE FIRST GUN_]  \"It would be well,\" said the Professor, \"to polish the inside of the bored barrels, and thus make a much better weapon.\"  \"How can we do this?\" asked Harry.  \"There are several ways, but the better plan would be to take a good polishing material, in the form of a fine sand or grit, and mix it with oil. This can then be put on a wiper which will snugly fit the bore, and the barrel may then be put in the lathe and rotated at a high rate of speed with the wiper in the bore, and during the rotation the wiper is drawn in and out. This operation should be continued for an hour at least, frequently withdrawing it to add more of the polishing grit.\"  \"What is the best grit to use?\"  \"If we can find a sample of the adamantine spar, in sufficient quantities, it would be the best substance.\"  \"What kind of material is that?\"  \"It is a substance known as corundum.\"  \"Is that the same as emery?\"  \"What is known as emery is the more or less impure product from the same source. I think I have stated heretofore that both of these products come from the precious gems; the blue variety is known under the name of sapphire; the red as ruby; the yellow as oriental topaz, and the violet as oriental amethyst.\"  During that and the following day the Professor spent some time in prospecting for the gems, but if he succeeded in finding any samples he did not make the discovery known.  A few days after this Harry announced that he was ready to lay the keel of the new boat. All the material had been prepared, and was at the beach. Prior to this the island had been visited by a heavy storm. They had been frequent within the past month, but this was not considered unusual.  The Professor insisted that a temporary shed should be erected to cover the material, as moisture would make it very undesirable for the vessel, and a day was occupied in putting up the structure.  An entire week thus passed, every hour of which was devoted with the utmost diligence to the various enterprises. The keel was laid and the work of putting on the bottom boards was progressing rapidly. One night, a few days after the laying of the keel, a brisk wind sprang up, which continued during the night, increasing in fury, and in the morning evidences were seen on all sides of the effect of the tempest.  \"It seems very singular,\" was George's observation, \"that we should have such terrible winds here.\"  The Professor had evidently expected the storms. \"Do you remember the experience we had less than a year ago? We had five days of this on the ocean.\"  \"I had forgotten that. Do they occur every year?\"  \"You may have heard of the monsoons, a periodical wind in the Indian Ocean, which is a northeast wind, and they blow with greater or less force from November to March.\"  \"What causes them to blow with such regularity during those periods?\"  \"Ah! that is one of the things which it has been difficult to determine. They appear to be modifications of the trade winds. While, as stated, the northeast winds blow during the periods mentioned, they have the southwest monsoons, which blow from April to October. As these violent winds are the most tempestuous during the period when the sun crosses the equator, it has been argued that it is due to the action of the sun being in such a position that its rays strike the earth in the center of its rotation, thus heating up the air and causing it to rise rapidly along the middle belt.\"  \"Is that what we understand by the equinoctial storms?\"  \"The equinoctial storms come in March and September, when the days and nights are of equal length.\"  \"I was told by a teacher that the summers are longer north of the equator than south of it; is that true?\"  \"Yes; the summer north of the equator is about seven and a half days longer.\"  \"What is the cause of that?\"  \"The earth is at its greatest distance from the sun during the summer months, and the angular motion of the earth in its orbit is slower. The result is, that the interval from the March to the September equinoxes is greater than from September to March.\"  Harry made his way through the violent wind and rain to the boat shed. He came back with a sorry-looking countenance. \"I am afraid everything is soaked beyond recovery.\" He was almost on the verge of tears.  Before noon the rain abated somewhat, but the winds still blew strongly, and when they ventured out to take stock of their surroundings, George was the first to notice the disappearance of the flag on Observation Hill. Rushing in to the Professor, he cried: \"Our flag is gone.\"  Harry was at the boathouse, and when George went down to inform him of the new calamity, he was almost heart-broken. The Professor, however, was not in the least perturbed. He laughingly chided them and soon restored the boys to their usual gay and happy demeanor.  \"Such little incidents as we have met with this morning only give us variety. We need something of this kind to add zest to life. Just imagine what life would be if everything turned out just as you wanted it or willed it? You would commit suicide within a week.\"  The boys smiled, but at the same time their"]]]
