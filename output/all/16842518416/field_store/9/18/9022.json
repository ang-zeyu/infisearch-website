The others insisted on returning to the coast without delay, and when we arrived there they gladly sold their shares in the ruby to me.\"  There was rather a long silence when the explorer had finished his narration. The long hand of the clock on the mantelpiece was creeping past the half-hour, but the circle round the dining-room table had been so enthralled by the story that nobody had noted the passage of time.  \"What a ghastly adventure, Mr. Musard!\" began one of the ladies, with a mirthless little laugh. \"Did you never discover anything more about the two dead men in the cave?\"  \"No,\" replied Musard. \"As I said, there were no papers or any clue to throw light on their identity. The skeletons must have lain there for many years, for the bones were crumbling into decay.\"  \"You have never revisited the spot?\" asked Sir Philip.  \"I was in the Ureweras two years later with a Maori guide, investigating copper deposits for the New Zealand Government, but I did not go back to the valley.\"  \"Would it not have been possible to give the poor things--the skeletons, I mean--Christian burial?\" Mrs. Spicer asked timidly.  \"It was impossible to dig a grave in the solid rock. Besides, they have a sepulchre of Nature's which will outlast any human grave,\" replied Musard.  \"The thing that puzzles me is how the ruby got into the skeleton's eye,\" remarked the lady journalist musingly. \"If that was the skeleton of the man who killed the other for stealing the ruby, who placed the ruby where you found it? Obviously, he could not have done it himself, for it must have been put there after death. Who, then, could it have been?\"  \"I have no idea,\" said Musard, in a tone which suggested that he did not care to discuss the subject further.  \"May I look at the ring?\" Miss Garton asked.  Musard drew it off his finger and handed it to her in silence. The others wanted to see it, so it was passed from hand to hand round the table, to the accompaniment of many admiring comments on the size and beauty of the stone. One of the young officers, with an air of much interest, asked Musard whether he thought there were other rubies like it to be found near the spot.  \"Hardly in that form,\" replied Musard. \"It is a puzzle to me how the men who found the ruby managed to get it out of the ruby rock and partially polish it. They had no tools or instruments of any kind--at least, we found none in the cave. Undoubtedly there are rubies in that part of the world. It was near the valley that Moynglass found his sample of corundum, with a ruby crystal in it. On our way back, at the head of the valley, I came across a belt of magnesian rocks charged with ores of copper and iron, and probably containing the matrix of ruby crystals.\"  \"I wonder you wear the thing,\" said the chubby-faced youth of the Flying Corps, handing the ring across the table to the explorer.  \"Why not?\" asked Musard.  \"Well, I wouldn't care to wear a ring found in a skeleton's head. I should expect the old bus to flop to the ground while I was doing a stunt, if I had a thing like that on my finger. Aren't you frightened of being haunted by the original owner?\"  \"Oh, I don't know,\" replied Musard indifferently. \"There's a horrible history attached to most jewels, if it comes to that. I am not superstitious.\" He replaced the ring on his finger, and added thoughtfully: \"I suppose many people would regard it in that light--as a grim sort of relic. Certainly, I shall never forget the valley of rocks where we found it. It was the strangest place I have ever seen--a 'waste howling wilderness.' And sometimes I fancy I can still hear the cry Doyne gave as he slipped or jumped from one of the black rocks into space. I remember how it came ringing back from the cliffs a hundred times repeated. It was--\"  He broke off suddenly, as a scream pealed through the moat-house--a wild shrill cry, which, coming from somewhere overhead, seemed to fill the dining-room with the shuddering, despairing intensity of its appeal. It was the shriek of a woman in terror.  The ladies at the dinner table regarded one another with frightened eyes and blanched faces.  \"What was that?\" several of them whispered together.  \"It came from Violet's room! My God, what has happened?\" exclaimed Phil. He sprang to his feet in agitation and pushed back his chair. His face was white, his mouth drawn, and he fumbled at his throat with a shaking hand, as though the pressure of his collar impeded his breathing. Musard rose from the table and walked to where the young man was standing.  \"Don't get upset needlessly, Phil,\" he said soothingly, placing a hand on his shoulder.  Sir Philip had also risen from his seat, and for the briefest possible space the three men stood thus, facing each other, as if uncertain how to act. Then the tense silence of the dining-room was broken by the loud report of a fire-arm.  \"Let me go!\" cried Phil shrilly, shaking off Musard's arm. He turned and limped rapidly towards the door, and as he did so his infirmity of body was apparent. One of his legs was several inches shorter than the other, and he wore a high boot.  Musard reached the door before him in a few rapid strides, and Sir Philip came hurrying after his son. The rest of the male guests followed, flocking towards the door in a body.  The first sight that Musard's eye fell upon as he passed through the doorway was the figure of Miss Heredith, rapidly descending the staircase. By the hall light he could see that her face was pale and agitated. She walked swiftly up to her old friend, and laid a trembling hand on his arm.  \"Oh, Vincent, I was just coming for you--something terrible must have happened!\" she began, in a broken, sobbing voice. \"I was going upstairs to my room, when I heard the scream, and then the shot. They must have come from Violet's room. Will you go up and see, Vincent?\"  Musard did not wait for her concluding words. He was already mounting the staircase, taking two or three of the broad shallow stairs in his stride. Phil hobbled after him, and Sir Philip and some of the guests straggled up in their wake.     CHAPTER V   A shaded light in an alcove at the head of the stairs threw a dim light down the passage which led off the first-floor landing, but Musard felt for the electric switch and pressed it. The light flooded an empty corridor, with the door of the room nearest to him gaping into a dark interior.  Musard stepped inside the open door, struck a match to find the switch, and walked over and turned on the light. As he did so, Phil and his father reached the door and followed him into the room, where, less than two hours before, Miss Heredith had been with Phil's young wife, and left her to sleep. The room seemed as it had been then; there was no sign of any intruder. The cut-glass and silver bottles stood on the small table by the head of the bed; the gold cigarette case was open alongside them; a novel, flung face downward on the pillows, revealed a garish cover and the bold lettering of the title--\"What Shall it Profit?\"--as though the book had dropped from the hand of some one overcome by sleep. But the white rays of the electric globe, hanging in a shade of rose colour directly overhead, fell with sinister distinctness on the slender figure of the young wife, lying in a huddled heap on the bed, her fashionable rest gown stained with blood, which oozed from her breast in a sluggish stream on the satin quilt. A sharp, pungent odour was mingled with the heavy atmosphere of the room--the smell of a burning fabric. There was no disorder, no weapon, no indication of a struggle. Only the motionless, bleeding figure on the bed revealed to the guests clustering outside the room that somebody had entered and departed as silently as a tiger.  Musard went swiftly to the bedside and bent over the girl.  \"She has been shot,\" he said, in a tone which was little more than a whisper.  \"She has been murdered!\" It was Phil, pressing close behind Musard, who uttered these words. \"Murdered!\" he cried, in an unnatural voice, which was dreadful to hear. He made a few steps in the direction of the bed with his arms outstretched, then stopped, and, swinging round, faced the guests who were thronging the corridor outside. \"Murdered, I say!\" he repeated. \"Where is the murderer?\"  He stood for a moment, fixing a wild eye on the group of frightened faces in the doorway, as though seeking the murderer among them. Then his face became distorted, and he fell to the ground. His limbs seemed to grow rigid as he lay; his legs were extended stiffly, the upper part of his arms were pressed against his breast, but the forearms inclined forward, with the palms of the hand thrown back, and the fingers wide apart. Even in his unconsciousness he looked as though he were warding off the horror of the sight which had stricken him to the ground.  In the presence of domestic calamity human nature betrays its inherent weakness. At such times the artificial outer covering of civilization falls away, and the soul stands forth, stark, primitive, forlorn, and cries aloud. The strain of the tremendous tragedy which had entered his house, swift-footed and silent, was too much for Sir Philip. He sank on his knees by the side of his unconscious son, whimpering like a child--a weak and helpless old man. There was no trace of the dignity of the Herediths or pride of race in the wrinkled face, now distorted with the pitiful grin of senility, as Sir Philip crouched over his son, stroking his face with feeble fingers.  One or two of the women in the passage became hysterical. The young men looked on awkwardly, with grave faces, not knowing what to do. There was something very English in their shy aloofness; in their dislike of intruding in the room unasked.  Musard, looking round from the bedside, glanced briefly at the prostrate figure of Phil, and then his gleaming eyes travelled to the group at the doorway. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20546"],["title","The Hand in the Dark (#8)"],["body","He, at all events, was calm, and master of himself.  \"The ladies had better go downstairs,\" he said, speaking in a subdued voice, but with decision. \"They can do no good here. And will you two\"--he singled out two of the young men with his eye--\"carry Phil downstairs? He has only fainted. Please take Sir Philip away also. Telephone for Dr. Holmes immediately, and send for Sergeant Lumbe. And some of you young men search the house thoroughly--at once. No, not this room. Search the house from top to bottom, and the grounds outside. Be quick! There is no time to be lost.\"  The group in the doorway melted away. The ladies, pale-faced and weeping, went downstairs together like a flock of frightened birds, and the young men, only too glad to obey somebody who showed nerve and resolution at such a moment, dispersed at once to search the house.  Musard was left in the room alone, but not for long. Miss Heredith entered from the corridor almost immediately. Tufnell accompanied her to the door, but stopped there, with staring eyes directed towards the bed. Miss Heredith's face was drawn, but she had recovered her self-control. She walked quickly towards Musard, who was still bending over the bed.  \"Vincent!\" she cried. \"In pity's name tell me what dreadful thing has happened? They have carried Phil downstairs, and they tried to detain me, but I broke away from them and came straight to you. Is Violet----\"  Musard sprang to his feet at the first sound of her voice, and wheeled round swiftly, as if trying to impose his body between her and the figure on the bed.  \"Go back, Alethea!\" he sternly commanded. \"Go back, I say! This is no sight for you, and you can do no good.\"  He still sought to intercept her as she approached, but she gently put aside his detaining hand, and, walking to the bedside, looked down. Then, at that sight, her fingers sought for his with an impulsive feminine movement, and held them tight.  \"Do not be afraid for me,\" she whispered. \"See! I am calm--I may be able to help. Is she--dead?\"  \"Dying,\" said Musard sadly.  \"Is it...?\" her voice dropped to nothingness, but her frightened eyes, travelling fearfully into the shadowy corners of the big bedroom, completed the unspoken sentence.  Musard understood her, and bowed his head silently. Then, turning his face to the door, he beckoned Tufnell to approach. The old servant advanced tremblingly into the room, vainly endeavouring to compose his horror-stricken face into a semblance of the impassive mask of the well-trained English servant.  \"Go downstairs and get me some hot water,\" said Musard quietly. \"Look sharp--and bring it yourself. I do not want any maidservants here to go into hysterics.\"  Tufnell hastened away. Musard resumed his place at the bedside, silently watching the figure on the bed. There was blood on his hands and clothes.  \"Is there no hope? Can nothing be done to save her?\" whispered Miss Heredith.  \"Nothing. The lung is penetrated. She is bleeding to death.\"  His quick eye noticed a change in the figure on the bed. The face quivered ever so slightly, and the blue eyes half opened. Then the stricken girl made an effort as though she wanted to sit up, but a sudden convulsion seized her, and she fell back on her pillow, with one little white hand, glittering with rings, flung above her head, as if she died in the act of invoking the retribution of a God of justice on the assassin who had blotted out her young life in agony and horror.  \"She is dead,\" said Musard gently. \"This is a terrible business, and our first duty is to try and capture the monster who committed this foul crime.\"  They stood there in silence for a moment, looking earnestly at one another. Outside, somewhere in the woodland, there sounded the haunting gush of a night-bird's song, shivering through the quietness like a silver bell. The sweet note finished in a frightened squawk, and was followed by the cry of an owl. The song had betrayed the singer.  Musard turned away from Miss Heredith, and walked restlessly around the bedroom, scanning the heavy pieces of furniture and the faded hangings, and peering into every nook and corner, as if seeking for the murderer's place of concealment. A roomy old wardrobe near the window attracted his eye, and he stopped in front of it and flung its doors open. It contained some articles of the dead girl's apparel--costumes and frocks--hanging on hooks.  His eye wandered to the window, shrouded in the heavy folds of the damask curtains. He walked over to it, and drew the curtains aside. The bottom half of the window was wide open.  Miss Heredith, who was following his movements closely, gave vent to a faint cry of surprise.  \"The window!\" she exclaimed.  Musard looked round inquiringly.  \"The window--what of it?\" he asked.  \"It was closed when I came in here before dinner to see Violet.\"  \"You are quite sure of that?\"  \"Oh, yes! At least, I think so.\"  \"I do not understand you.\"  \"I mean that the atmosphere of the room was heavy and thick, as if the window had not been opened all day.\"  \"It has been a still, close day.\"  \"But Violet never had a window open if she could help it. She disliked fresh air. She was always afraid of catching cold.\"  Musard looked out of the window into the velvet darkness of the night.  \"If the window was closed before, the murderer has opened it and escaped through it,\" he said.  \"It is hardly possible.\"  \"Why not?\" He turned round and faced her.  \"The ground falls on that side. The window is nearly twenty feet from the ground. And--there is the moat to be crossed. There is no bridge on that side of the house, and this window opens on the garden. Don't you remember?\"  \"I remember now.\"  \"I thought you would.\"  \"Still----\" Musard broke off abruptly, and walked away from the window.  Near the window stood the dressing-table. The swing oval mirror reflected its contents--ivory brushes, silver hand mirrors, all the costly bijoutry of a refined woman's toilet. Among them stood Violet's silver jewel-case. Musard strode over and examined the case. It was locked.  \"This ought to be put away,\" he said.  \"I was coming up to get it when I heard the scream,\" whispered his companion.  \"Perhaps you will take charge of it now,\" he said, placing it in her hands. As he did so there flashed across his mind the cynical appropriateness of the old proverb about locking doors after stolen steeds.  There was a restraint and lack of spontaneity about their conversation of which both were acutely conscious. The note was forced, as though from too great an effort to strike the right key. A curious psychological change had swept over both since they stood together by the bedside of the dying woman. It had come with the entry of death. They conversed hurriedly and guardedly, as if they mistrusted each other. In each of them two entities were now apparent--a surface consciousness, which talked and acted mechanically, and a secondary inner consciousness, watchful, and fearful of misinterpretation of the spoken word. The faculties which make up the human mind are different and complex, and mysteriously blended. It may be that when tragedy upsets the frail structure of human life the brute instincts of watchfulness and self-preservation come uppermost, guarding against chance suspicion, or the loud word of accusation. Perhaps through Musard's mind was passing the thought of the strange manner in which the murder had been committed, and how he, by detaining everybody downstairs at the dinner table while he told his story had been an instrument in its accomplishment.  The situation was terminated by the arrival of Tufnell with some hot water. Almost on his heels came the young men who had been searching the house. Musard was relieved by their return, though his impassive face did not reveal his feelings. Miss Heredith left the room with Tufnell, taking the jewel-case with her. Musard met the young men at the threshold.  The tall young officer with the sunburnt face, Major Gardner, informed Musard that they had completed a search of the house from top to bottom, but had found nothing. They had also searched the grounds, without result.  \"Mrs. Heredith is dead,\" Musard gravely informed them. \"She died while you have been searching for the miscreant who fired the shot we heard at the dinner table. Gentlemen, he must be found. It seems hardly possible that he has succeeded in getting clear away in so short a time.\"  \"We have searched the place from top to bottom,\" remarked one of the young men.  \"It is a strange, rambling old place, and difficult to explore unless you know it thoroughly,\" said Musard.  \"We have done the best we could.\"  \"I do not doubt it, but there are many old nooks and corners in which a man might hide.\"  \"His first thought, after such a dreadful crime, would be to get away as quickly as possible,\" said Major Gardner.  \"But how did he escape? Certainly not by the staircase, because we rushed out from the dining-room directly we heard the shot, and we should have caught him on his way down.\"  \"Is there not a window in the bedroom? Could he not have escaped that way?\"  \"The window is nearly twenty feet from the ground.\"  \"An athletic man might jump that distance,\" remarked Major Gardner thoughtfully.  \"I still think it possible he may be concealed about the premises,\" replied Musard. \"There is an old unused staircase at the end of this passage, which opens on the south side of the moat-house. Did you find it? It shuts with a door at the top, and might easily have escaped your notice.\"  \"I opened the door and went down the staircase,\" said the young flying officer. \"Nobody could have escaped that way. The door at the bottom is locked, and there is no key.\"  The scared face of a maidservant at that moment appeared at the head of the stairs.  \"If you please, sir,\" she said, addressing Musard, \"one of the gentlemen downstairs sent me up to tell you that he has been trying for the last ten minutes to ring up the police, but he can't"]]]
