Please, please don't make us stop together! If you won't move her, move me! I'd sleep in an attic if I could have it to myself.\"  \"You must stay where you are until the end of the week. You owe that to Rona, at any rate. Afterwards I shall not force you, but leave it to your own good feeling. I want you to think over what I have been saying. You can come on Sunday morning and tell me your decision.\"  \"I know what the answer will be,\" murmured Ulyth, as she went from the room.  She was very angry with Miss Bowes, with Rona, and with herself for her own folly.  \"It's ridiculous to expect me to take up this savage,\" she argued. \"And too bad of Miss Bowes to make out that I'm breaking my word. Oh dear! what am I to write home to Mother? How can I tell her? I believe I'll just send her a picture post card, and only say Rona has come, and no more. Miss Bowes has no right to coerce me. I'll make my own friends. No, I've quite made up my mind she shan't cram Rona down my throat. To have that awful girl eternally in my bedroom--I should die!\"  After all her heroics it was a terrible come-down for poor Ulyth now the actual had taken the place of the sentimental. Her class-mates could not forbear teasing her a little. It was too bad of them; but then they had resented her entire pre-appropriation of the new-comer, and, moreover, had one or two old scores from last term to pay off. Ulyth began to detest the very name of \"the Prairie Flower\". She wondered how she could ever have been so silly.  \"I ought to have been warned,\" she thought, trying to throw the blame on to somebody else. \"No one ever suggested she'd be like this. The editor of the magazine really shouldn't have persuaded us to write. It's all his fault in the beginning.\"  Though the rest of the girls were scarcely impressed with Rona's personality, they were not utterly repelled.  \"She's rather pretty,\" ventured Lizzie Lonsdale. \"Her eyes are the bluest I've ever seen.\"  \"And her teeth are so white and even,\" added Beth Broadway. \"She looks jolly when she smiles.\"  \"Perhaps she'll smarten up soon,\" suggested Addie Knighton. \"That blue dress suits her; it just matches her eyes.\"  To Ulyth's fastidious taste Rona's clothes looked hopelessly ill-cut and colonial, especially as her room-mate put them on anyhow, and seemed to have no regard at all for appearances. A girl who did not mind whether she looked really trim, spruce and smart, must indeed have spent her life in the backwoods.  \"Didn't you even have a governess in New Zealand?\" she ventured one day. She did not encourage Rona to talk, but for once her curiosity overcame her dislike of the high-pitched voice.  \"Couldn't get one to stop up-country, where we were. Mrs. Barker, our cowman's wife, looked after me ever since Mother died. She was the only woman about the place. One of our farm helps taught me lessons. He was a B.A. of Oxford, but down on his luck. Dad said I'd seem queer to English girls. I don't know that I care.\"  Though Rona might not be possessed of the most delicate perceptions, she nevertheless had common sense enough to realize that Ulyth did not receive her with enthusiasm.  \"I suppose you're disappointed in me?\" she queried. \"Dad said you would be, but I laughed at him. Pity if our ready-made friendship turned out a misfit! I think you're no end! Dad said I'd got to copy you; it'll take me all my time, I expect. Things are so different here from home.\"  Was there a suspicion of a choke in the words?  Ulyth had a sudden pang of compunction. Unwelcome as her companion was to her, she did not wish to be brutal.  \"You mustn't get home-sick,\" she said hastily. \"You'll shake down here in time. Everyone finds things strange at school just at first. I did myself.\"  \"I guess you were never as much a fish out of water as me, though,\" returned Rona, and went whistling down the passage.  Ulyth tried to dismiss her from her thoughts. She did not intend to worry over Rona more than she could possibly help. Fortunately they were not together in class, for Rona's entrance-examination papers had not reached the standard of the Lower Fifth, and she had been placed in IV B.  Ulyth was interested in her school-work. She stood well with her teachers, and was an acknowledged force in her form. She came from a very refined and cultured home, where intellectual interests were cultivated both by father and mother. Her temperament was naturally artistic; she was an omnivorous reader, and could devour anything in the shape of literature that came her way. The bookcase in her dormitory was filled with beautiful volumes, mostly Christmas and birthday gifts. She rejoiced in their soft leather bindings or fine illustrations with a true book-lover's enthusiasm. It was her pride to keep them in daintiest condition. Dog-ears or thumb-marks were in her opinion the depths of degradation. Ulyth had ambitions also, ambitions which she would not reveal to anybody. Some day she planned to write a book of her own. She had not yet fixed on a subject, but she had decided just what the cover was to be like, with her name on it in gilt letters. Perhaps she might even illustrate it herself, for her love of art almost equalled her love of literature; but that was still in the clouds, and must wait till she had chosen her plot. In the interim she wrote verses and short stories for the school magazine, and her essays for Miss Teddington were generally returned marked \"highly creditable\".  This term Ulyth intended to study hard. It was a promotion to be in the Upper School; she was beginning several new subjects, and her interest in many things was aroused. It would be a delightful autumn as soon as she had got rid of this dreadful problem, at present the one serious obstacle to her comfort. But in the meantime it was only Friday, and till at least the following Monday she would be obliged to endure her uncongenial presence in her bedroom.     CHAPTER III  Round the Camp-fire   It was the first Saturday of the term. So far the girls had been kept busily occupied settling down to work in their fresh forms, and trying to grow accustomed to Miss Teddington's new time-tables. Now, however, they were free to relax and enjoy themselves in any way they chose. Some were playing tennis, some had gone for a walk with Miss Moseley, a few were squatting frog-like on boulders in the midst of the stream, and others strolled under the trees in the grove.  \"Thank goodness the weather's behaving itself!\" said Mary Acton, who, with a few other members of the Lower Fifth, was sitting on the trunk of a fallen oak. \"Do you remember last council? It simply poured. The thing's no fun if one can't have a real fire.\"  \"It'll burn first-rate to-night,\" returned Lizzie Lonsdale. \"There's a little wind, and the wood'll be dry.\"  \"That reminds me I haven't found my faggot yet,\" said Beth Broadway easily.  \"Girl alive! Then you'd better go and look for one, or you'll be all in a scramble at the last!\"  \"Bother! I'm too comfy to move.\"  \"Nice Wood-gatherer you'll look if you come empty-handed!\"  \"I'd appropriate half your lot first, Lizzikins!\"  \"Would you, indeed? I'd denounce you, and you'd lose your rank and be degraded to a candidate again.\"  \"Oh, you mean, stingy miser!\"  \"Not at all. It's the wise and foolish virgins over again. I shan't have enough for myself and you. I've a lovely little stack--just enough for one--reposing--no, I'd better not tell you where. Don't look so hopeful. You're not to be trusted.\"  \"What are you talking about?\" asked Rona Mitchell, who had wandered up to the group. \"Why are some of you picking up sticks? I saw a girl over there with quite a bundle just now. You might tell me.\"  So far Rona had not been well received in her own form, IV B. She was older than her class-mates, and they, instead of attempting to initiate her into the ways of the Woodlands girls on this holiday afternoon, had scuttled off and left her to fend for herself. She looked such an odd, wistful, lonely figure that Lizzie Lonsdale's kind heart smote her. She pushed the other girls farther along the tree-trunk till they made a grudging space for the new-comer.  \"I'm a good hand at camp-fires, if you want any help,\" continued Rona, seating herself with alacrity. \"I've made 'em by the dozen at home, and cooked by them too. Just let me know where you want it, and I'll set to work.\"  \"You wouldn't be allowed,\" said Beth bluntly. \"This fire is a very special thing. Only Wood-gatherers may bring the fuel. No one else is eligible.\"  \"Why on earth not?\"  \"Oh, I can't bother to explain now! It would take too long. You'll find out to-night. Girls, I'm going in!\"  \"Turn up here at dusk if you want to know, and bring a cup with you,\" suggested Lizzie, with a half-ashamed effort at friendliness, as she followed her chums.  \"You bet I'll turn up! Rather!\"  That evening, just after sunset, little groups of girls began to collect round an open green space in the glade. They came quietly and with a certain sense of discipline. A stranger would have noticed that if any loud tone or undue hilarity made itself heard, it was instantly and firmly repressed by one or two who seemed in authority. That the meeting was more in the nature of a convention than a mere pleasure-gathering was evident both from the demeanour of the assemblage and from the various badges pinned on the girls' coats. No teacher was present, but there was an air of general expectancy, as if the coming of somebody were awaited. To the pupils at The Woodlands this night's ceremony was a very special occasion, for it was the autumn reunion of the Camp-fire League, an organization which, originally of American birth, had been introduced at the instigation of Miss Teddington, and had taken great root in the school. Any girl was eligible as a candidate, but before she could gain admission to even the initial rank she had to prove herself worthy of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],["title","For the Sake of the School (#4)"],["body","honour of membership, and pass successfully through her novitiate.  The organizer and leader of the branch which to-night was to celebrate its third anniversary was a certain Mrs. Arnold, a charming young American lady who lived in the neighbourhood. She had been an enthusiastic supporter of the League in Pennsylvania before her marriage, and was delighted to pass on its traditions to British schoolgirls. Her winsome personality made her a prime favourite at The Woodlands, where her influence was stronger even than she imagined. Miss Teddington, though it was she who had asked Mrs. Arnold to institute and take charge of the meetings, had the discretion to keep out of the League herself, realizing that the presence of teachers might be a restraint, and that the management was better left in the hands of a trustworthy outsider.  To become an authorized Camp-fire member was an ambition with most of the girls, and spurred many on to greater efforts than they would otherwise have attempted. All looked forward to the meetings, and there could be no greater punishment for certain offences than a temporary withdrawal of League privileges.  This September, after the long summer holiday, the reunion seemed of even more than ordinary importance.  The sun had set, the last gleam of the afterglow had faded, and the glade had grown full of dim shadows by the time everybody was present in the grove. The gentle rustle of the leafy boughs overhead, and the persistent tumbling rush of the stream, seemed like a faint orchestral accompaniment of Nature for the ceremonial.  \"Is it a Quakers' Meeting or a Freemasons' Lodge? You're all very mum,\" asked Rona, whom curiosity had led out with the others.  \"Sh-sh! We're waiting for our 'Guardian of the Fire',\" returned Ulyth, trying to suppress the loudness of the high-pitched voice. \"Mrs. Arnold's generally very punctual. Oh, there! I believe I hear her ringing her bicycle bell now. I'm going down the field to meet her.\"  Ulyth regarded Mrs. Arnold with that intense adoration which a girl of fifteen often bestows on a woman older than herself. She ran now through the wood, hoping she might be in time to catch her idol on the drive and have just a few precious moments with her before she was joined by the others. There were many things she wanted to pour into her friend's ready ears, but she knew it would be impossible to monopolize her as soon as the rest of the girls knew of her arrival. She fled as on wings, therefore, and had the supreme satisfaction of being the first in the field. Mrs. Arnold, young, very fair, graceful, and golden-haired, looked a picture in her blue cycling costume as she leaned her machine against a tree and greeted her enthusiastic admirer.  \"Oh, you darling! I've such heaps to tell you!\" began Ulyth, clasping her tightly by the arm. \"Rona Mitchell has come, and she's the most awful creature! I never was so disappointed in my life. Don't you sympathize with me, when I expected her to be so ripping? She's absolute backwoods!\"  \"Yes, I've heard all about her. Poor child! She must have had a strange training. It's time indeed she began to learn something.\"  \"She's not learned anything in New Zealand. Oh, her voice will just grate on you! And her manners! She's hopeless! Everything she does and says is wrong. And to think she's been foisted on to me, of all people!\"  \"Poor child!\" repeated Mrs. Arnold. (\"Which of us does she mean?\" thought Ulyth.) \"She's evidently raw material. Every diamond needs polishing. What an opportunity for a Torch-bearer!\"  Ulyth dropped her friend's arm suddenly. It was not at all the answer she had expected. Moreover, at least a dozen girls had come running up and were claiming their chief's attention. In a species of triumphant procession Mrs. Arnold was escorted into the glade and installed on her throne of state, a seat made of logs and decorated with ferns. Everyone clustered round to welcome her, and for the moment she was the centre of an enthusiastic crowd. Ulyth followed more slowly. She was feeling disturbed and put out. What did Mrs. Arnold mean? Surely not----? A sudden thought had flashed into her mind but she thrust it away indignantly. Oh no, that was quite impossible! It was outrageous of anybody to make the suggestion. And yet--and yet--the uneasy voice that had been haunting her for the last four days began to speak with even more vehemence. With a sigh of relief she heard the signal given for \"Attention\", and cast the matter away from her for the moment. Every eye was fixed on their leader. The ceremony was about to begin.  Mrs. Arnold rose, and in her clear, sweet voice proclaimed:  \"The Guardian of the Fire calls on the Wood-gatherers to bring their fuel.\"  At once a dozen girls came forward, each dragging a tolerably large bundle of brushwood. They deposited these in a circle, saluted, and retired.  \"Fire-makers, do your work!\" commanded the leader.  Eight girls responded, Ulyth among the number, and seizing the brushwood, they built it deftly into a pile. All stood round, waiting in silence while their chief struck a match and applied a light to some dried leaves and bracken that had been placed beneath. The flame rose up like a scarlet ribbon, and in a few moments the dry fuel was ablaze and crackling. The gleam lighting up the glade displayed a picturesque scene. The boles of the trees might have been the pillars in some ancient temple, with the branches for roof. Close by the cascade of the stream leapt white against a background of dim darkness. The harvest moon, full and golden, was rising behind the crest of Cwm Dinas. An owl flew hooting from the wood higher up the glen. Mrs. Arnold stood waiting until the bonfire was well alight, then she turned to the expectant girls.  \"I've no need to tell most of you why we have met here to-night; but for the benefit of a few who are new-comers to The Woodlands I should like briefly to explain the objects of the Camp-fire League. The purpose of the organization is to show that the common things of daily life are the chief means of beauty, romance, and adventure, to cultivate the outdoor habit, and to help girls to serve the community--the larger home--as well as the individual home. In these ultra-modern times we must especially devote ourselves to the service of the country, and try by every means in our power to make our League of some national use. First let us repeat together the rules of the Camp-fire League:      \"'1. Seek beauty.       2. Give service.       3. Pursue knowledge.       4. Be trustworthy.       5. Hold on to health.       6. Glorify work.       7. Be happy.'  \"Seeking beauty includes more than looking for superficial adornment. Beauty is in all life, in Nature, in people, in the love of one's heart, in virtue and a radiant disposition. The value of service depends largely upon the attitude of mind of the one rendering it. Joy in the performance of some needed service in behalf of parent, teacher, friend, or country constitutes a part of the very essence of goodness, and multiplies the good already abiding in the heart. This is the third anniversary of the founding of a branch of the League at The Woodlands. So far the work has been very encouraging, and I am glad to say that to-night we have candidates eligible for all three ranks. It shall now be the business of the meeting formally to admit them. Candidates for Wood-gatherers, present yourselves!\"  Six of the younger girls came forward and saluted.  \"Can you repeat, and will you promise to obey, the seven rules of the Camp-fire law?\"  Each responded audibly in the affirmative.  \"Then you are admitted to the initial rank of Wood-gatherers, you are awarded the white badge of service, and may sign your names as accepted members of the League.\"  The six retired to make way for a higher grade, and eight other girls stepped into the firelight.  \"Candidates for Fire-makers, you have passed three months with good characters as Wood-gatherers, and you have proved your ability to render first aid, keep accounts, tie knots, and prepare and serve a simple meal; you have each committed to memory some good poem, and have acquainted yourself with the career of some able, public-spirited woman. Having thus shown your wish to serve the community, repeat the Fire-maker's desire.\"  And all together the eight girls chanted:      \"As fuel is brought to the fire      So I purpose to bring      My strength,      My ambition,      My heart's desire,      My joy,      And my sorrow      To the fire      Of human kind.      For I will tend      As my fathers have tended      And my fathers' fathers      Since time began,      The fire that is called      The love of man for man,      The love of man for God.\"  Mrs. Arnold said a few kind words to each as she pinned on their red badges. Only novices who had stood the various tests with credit were raised to the honour of the second rank. Those who had failed must perforce continue as Wood-gatherers for another period of three months.  There remained one further and higher rank, only attainable after six months' ardent and trustworthy service as Fire-makers. To-night three girls were to be admitted to its privileges, and Helen Cooper, Doris Deane, and Ulyth Stanton presented themselves. With grave faces they repeated the Torch-bearer's desire:       \"That light which has been given to me I desire to pass undimmed to      others.\"  Ulyth kissed Mrs. Arnold's pretty hand as the long-coveted yellow badge was fastened on to her dress, side by side with the Union Jack. She was so glad to be a Torch-bearer at last. She had become a candidate when the League was first founded three years ago, and all that time she had been slowly working towards the desired end of the third rank. One or two slips had hindered her progress, but last term she had made a very special effort, and it was sweet to meet with her reward. Torch-bearers were mostly to be found among the Sixth and Upper "]]]
