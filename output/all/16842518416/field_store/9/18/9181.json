The jurists most in favour at Court were followers of Abu Hanífa. They carried the principle of analogical deduction to dangerous lengths in order to satisfy the latitudinarianism of the Khalíf. Human speculation seemed to be weakening all the essentials of the Faith. Ibn Hanbal met the difficulty by discarding altogether the principle of analogical deduction. At the same time he saw that the Máliki system, founded as it was on the \"Customs of Madína,\" was ill-suited to meet the wants of a great and growing Empire. It needed to be supplemented. What better, what surer ground could he go upon than the Traditions. These at least were inspired, and thus formed a safer foundation on which to build a system of jurisprudence than the analogical deductions of Abu Hanífa did. The system of Ibn Hanbal has almost ceased to exist. There is now no Muftí of this sect at Mecca, though the other three are represented there. Still his influence is felt to this day in the importance he attached to Tradition.  The distinction between the four Imáms has been put in this way. Abu Hanífa exercised his own judgment. Málik and Hanbal preferred authority and precedent. As-Sháfi'í entirely repudiated reason. They differ, too, as regards the value of certain Traditions, but to each of them an authentic Tradition is an incontestable authority. Their {23} opinion on points of doctrine and practice forms the third basis of the Faith.  The Ijmá' of the four Imáms is a binding law upon all Sunnís. It might be supposed that as the growing needs of the Empire led to the formation of these schools of interpretation; so now the requirements of modern, social and political life might be met by fresh Imáms making new analogical deductions. This is not the case. The orthodox belief is, that since the time of the four Imáms there has been no Mujtahid who could do as they did. If circumstances should arise which absolutely require some decision to be arrived at, it must be given in full accordance with the 'mazhab,' or school of interpretation, to which the person framing the decision belongs.[29] This effectually prevents all change, and by excluding innovation, whether good or bad, keeps Islám stationary. Legislation is now purely deductive. Nothing must be done contrary to the principles contained in the jurisprudence of the four Imáms. \"Thus, in any Muhammadan State legislative reforms are simply impossible. There exists no initiative. The Sultán, or Khalíf can claim the allegiance of his people only so long as he remains the exact executor of the prescriptions of the Law.\"  The question then as regards the politics of the \"Eastern {24} Question\" is not whether Muhammad was a deceiver or self-deceived, an apostle or an impostor; whether the Qurán is on the whole good or bad; whether Arabia was the better or the worse for the change Muhammad wrought; but what Islám as a religious and political system has become and is, how it now works, what Orthodox Muslims believe and how they act in that belief. The essence of that belief is, that the system as taught by Prophet, Khalífs and Imáms is absolutely perfect.[30] Innovation is worse than a mistake. It is a crime, a sin. This completeness, this finality of his system of religion and polity, is the very pride and glory of a true Muslim. To look for an increase of light in the knowledge of his relation to God and the unseen world, in the laws which regulate Islám on earth is to admit that Muhammad's revelation was incomplete, and that admission no Muslim will make.  It has been stated on high authority that all that is required for the reform of Turkey is that the Qánúns or orders of the Sultán should take the place of the Sharí'at or law of Islám. Precisely so; if this could be done, Turkey might be reformed; but Islám would cease to be the religion of the State. That the law as formulated by the Imám Abu Hanífa ill suits the conditions of modern life is more than probable; but it is the very function of the Khalíf of Islám, {25} which the Sultán claims to be, to maintain it. He is no Mujtahid, for such there are not now amongst the Sunnís, to which sect the Turks belong. If through stress of circumstances some new law must be made, orthodoxy demands that it should be strictly in accordance with the opinions of the Imáms. The Shía'hs, in opposition to the Sunnís, hold that there are still Mujtahidín, but this opinion arises from their peculiar doctrine of the Imámat, a subject we shall discuss a little later on. At first sight it would seem that if there can be Mujtahidín who are now able to give authoritative opinions, there may be some hope of enlightened progress amongst Shía'h people--the Persians for example. There is doubtless amongst them more religious unrest, more mysticism, more heresy, but they are no further on the road of progress than their neighbours; and the apparent advantage of the presence of a Mujtahid is quite nullified by the fact that all his decisions must be strictly in accordance with the Qurán and the Sunnat, or rather with what to the Shía'h stands in the place of the Sunnat. The Shía'h, as well as the Sunní, must base all legislation on the fossilized system of the past, not on the living needs of the present. Precedent rules both with an iron sway. The Wahhábís reject all Ijmá' except that of the Companions, but that they accept; so when they are called the Puritans of Islám, it must be remembered that they accept as a rule of faith not only the Qurán, but the Sunnat, and some Ijmá'.  In order to make Ijmá' binding, it is necessary that the Mujtahidín should have been unanimous in their opinion or in their practice.  The whole subject of Ijtihád is one of the most important in connection with the possibility of reforms in a Muslim state. A modern Muhammadan writer[31] seeking to show that Islám does possess a capacity for progress and that so far from being a hard and fast system, it is able to adapt itself to new circumstances, because the Prophet ushered in {26} \"an age of active principles,\" uses the story I have already related when describing the origin of Ijtihád (Ante. p. 17) to prove the accuracy of his statement. He makes Mu'áz to say:--\"I will look first to the Qurán, then to precedents of the Prophet, and lastly rely upon my _own judgment_.\" It is true that Ijtihád literally means 'great effort,' it is true that the Companions and Mujtahidín of the first class had the power of exercising their judgment in doubtful cases, and of deciding them according to their sense of the fitness of things, provided always, that their decision contravened no law of the Qurán or the Sunnat; but this in no way proves that Islám has any capacity for progress, or that \"an age of active principles\" was ushered in by Muhammad, or that his \"words breathe energy and force, and infuse new life into the dormant heart of humanity.\" For, though the term Ijtihád might, in reference to the men I have mentioned, be somewhat freely translated as \"one's own judgment,\" it can have no such meaning now. It is a purely technical term, and its use and only use now is to express the \"referring of a difficult case to some analogy drawn from the Qurán and the Sunnat.\" But even were the meaning not thus restricted, even though it meant now as it sometimes meant at first, \"one's own judgment;\" still Syed Amír 'Alí's position would remain to be proved for, since the days of the four Imáms, the orthodox believe that there has been no Mujtahid of the first class, and to none but men of this rank has such power ever been accorded. Thus granting, for the sake of argument merely, that the Syed's translation is grammatically and technically correct, all that results from it is that the \"age of active principles\" lasted only for two centuries. I do not admit that there ever was such an age in Islám, and certainly neither its theological development, nor its political growth negative the opposite assertion, _viz._, that Muhammad gave precepts rather than principles. The Turks are included in \"the dormant heart of humanity,\" but it is difficult to see what \"energy and {27} force\" is breathed, what \"new life is infused\" into them by the \"wonderful words\" of the Prophet, or what lasting good the \"age of active principles\" has produced.  4. QÍÁS is the fourth foundation of Islám. The word literally means reasoning, comparing. It is in common use in Hindustani and Persian in the sense of guessing, considering, &c. Technically, it means the analogical reasoning of the learned with regard to the teaching of the Qurán, the Sunnat and the Ijmá'. For example, the Qurán says:--\"Honour thy father and thy mother and be not a cause of displeasure to them.\" It is evident from this that disobedience to parents is prohibited, and prohibition implies punishment if the order is disobeyed. Again, if the Qurán and the Sunnat hold children responsible, according to their means, for the debts of their father, does it not follow that the elder ones ought to fulfil for their parents all those obligations which for some reason or other the parents may not be able to perform, such as the pilgrimage to Mecca, &c. A Tradition said to come from the Companions runs thus:--\"One day, a woman came to the Prophet and said, 'my father died without making the Pilgrimage.' The Prophet said, 'If thy father had left a debt what wouldest thou do,' 'I would pay the debt.' 'Good, then pay this debt also.'\" The Qurán forbids the use of Khamar, an intoxicating substance, and so it is argued that wine and opium are unlawful, though not forbidden by name. The Wahhábís would extend the prohibition to the use of tobacco.  From cases such as these, many jurisconsults hold that the Mujtahidín of the earliest age established this fourth foundation of the faith which they call Qíás. It is also called I'tibár-ul-Amsál, or \"imitation of an example.\" The idea is taken from the verse: \"Profit"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],["title","The Faith of Islam (#6)"],["body","this example, ye who are men of insight\" (Súra lix. 2). There are strict rules laid down which regulate Qíás, of which the most important is, that in all cases it must be based on the Qurán, the Sunnat, and the Ijmá'. In fact, the fundamental idea of Islám {28} is that a perfect law has been given, even unto details, of social and political life. The teaching of Muhammad contains the solution of every difficulty that can arise. Every law not provided by the Prophet must be deduced analogically. This produces uniformity after a fashion, but only because intellectual activity in higher pursuits ceases and moral stagnation follows. Thus all who come within the range of this system are bound down to political servitude. Whatever in feeling or conviction goes beyond the limits of an out-worn set of laws is swept away. There is a wonderful family likeness in the decay of all Musalmán States, which seems to point to a common cause. All first principles are contained in the Qurán and the Sunnat; all that does not coincide with them must be wrong. They are above all criticism.  Qíás, then, affords no hope of enlightened progress, removes no fetter of the past, for in it there must be no divergence in principle from a legislation imperfect in its relation to modern life and stationary in its essence.[32] In the Niháyat-ul-Murád it is written:--\"We are shut up to following the four Imáms.\" In the Tafsír-i-Ahmadí we read:--\"To follow any other than the four Imáms is unlawful.\" An objector may say that such respect is like the reverence the heathen pay to their ancestors. To this an answer is given in the preface to the Tarjuma-i-Sharh-i-Waqáyah. The writer there says that it is nothing of the kind. \"The Mujtahidín are not the source of the orders of the Law, but they are the medium by which we obtain the Law. Thus Imám Abu Hanífa said: 'We select first from the Qurán, then from the Traditions, then from the decrees of the Companions; we act on what the Companions agreed upon; where they doubt, we doubt.' The Commentator Jelál-ud-dín Mahlí says, 'The common people and others who have {29} not reached the rank of a Mujtahid, must follow one of the four Imáms.' Then when he enters one Mazhab (sect) he must not change. Again, it may be objected that God gave no order about the appointment of four Imáms. Now, it is recorded in a Tradition that the Prophet said, 'Follow the way of the great company; whosoever departs from it will enter hell.' The Followers of the Imáms are a great company.\" It is moreover the unanimous opinion, the \"Ijmá'-i-Ummat,\" that the Imáms rightly occupy the position accorded to them. It is a great blessing, as we read in the Tafsír-i-Ahmadí: \"It is of the grace of God, that we are shut up to these four Imáms. God approves of this, and into this matter proofs and explanations do not enter.\" Should any one further object that, in the days of the Prophet, there were no Mujtahidín, that each man acted on a \"saying\" as he heard it, that he did not confine his belief or conduct to the deductions made by some \"appointed Companion,\" he may be answered thus:--\"For a long time after the death of the Prophet many Companions were alive, and consequently the Traditions then current were trustworthy; but now it is not so, hence the need for the Imáms and their systems.\"  These four foundations,--the QURÁN, the SUNNAT, IJMÁ' and QÍÁS--form in orthodox Muslim opinion and belief a perfect basis of a perfect religion and polity. They secure the permanence of the system, but they repress an intelligent growth. The bearing of all this on modern politics is very plain. Take again the case of Turkey. The constitution of the Government is theocratic. The germs of freedom are wanting there as they have never been wanting in any other country in Europe. The ruling power desires no change; originality of thought, independence of judgment is repressed. Nothing good has the Turk ever done for the world.[33] This rule has been one continued display of brute {30} force unrelieved by any of the reflected glory which shone for a while in Cordova and in Baghdád. No nation can possibly progress, the foundations of whose legal and theocratic system are what has been described in this chapter. When brought into diplomatic and commercial intercourse with States possessing the energy and vigour of a national life and liberal constitution, Muslim kingdoms must, in the long run, fail and pass away. It has been well said that \"Spain is the only instance of a country once thoroughly infused with Roman civilisation which has been actually severed from the empire; and even then the severance, though of long duration, was but partial and temporary. After a struggle of nearly eight centuries, the higher form of social organisation triumphed over the lower and the usurping power of Islám was expelled.\" So it ought to be, and so indeed it must ever be, for despotism must give way to freedom; the life latent in the subject Christian communities must sooner or later cast off the yoke of a barbarian rule, which even at its best is petrified and so is incapable of progress. However low a Christian community may have fallen, there is always the possibility of its rising again. A lofty ideal is placed before it. All its most cherished beliefs point forward and upward. In Islám there is no regenerative power. Its golden age was in the past. When the work of conquest is done, when a Muhammadan nation has to live by industry, intelligence and thrift, it always miserably fails.  In this chapter which must now draw to a close, I have tried to prove from authentic and authoritative sources that {31} the Qurán alone is to no Muslim the sole guide of life. The fetters of a dogmatic system fasten alike around the individual and the community. Islám is sterile, it gives no new birth to the spirit of a man, leads him not in search of new forms of truth, and so it can give no real life, no lasting vitality to a nation.[34]  {32}      NOTE TO CHAPTER I.      IJTIHÁD.      Questions connected with Ijtihád are so important in Islám, that I     think it well to give in the form of a note a fuller and more technical     account of it, than I could do in the Chapter just concluded. This     account which I shall now give is that of a learned Musalmán, and is,     therefore, of the highest value. It consists of extracts from an     article in the Journal Asiatique, Quatrième Série, tome, 15, on \"Le     Marche et les Progres de la Jurisprudence parmi les Sectes orthodoxes     Musalmanes\" by Mirza Kázim Beg, Professor in the University of St.     Petersburg. It entirely supports all that has been said of the rigid     character of Muhammadan Law, and of the immobility of systems founded     thereon.      \"Orthodox Musalmáns admit the following propositions as axioms.      1. God the only legislator has shown the way of felicity to the people     whom He has chosen, and in order to enable them to walk in that way He     has shown to them the precepts which are found, partly in the eternal     Qurán, and partly in the sayings of the Prophet transmitted to     posterity by the Companions and preserved in the Sunnat. That way is     called the \"Sharí'at.\" The rules thereof are called Ahkám.      2. The Qurán and the Sunnat, which since their manifestation are the     primitive sources of the orders of the Law, form two branches of study,     _viz._, Ilm-i-Tafsír, or the interpretation of the Qurán and     Ilm-i-Hadís, or the study of Tradition.      3. All the orders of the Law have regard either to the actions (Dín),     or to the belief (Imán) of the Mukallifs.[35]      4. As the Qurán and the Sunnat are the principal sources from whence     the precepts of the Sharí'at have been drawn, so the rules recognized     as the principal elements of actual jurisprudence are the subject of     Ilm-í-Fiqh, or the science of Law.      Fiqh in its root signifies conception, comprehension. Thus Muhammad     prayed for Ibn Mas'úd: \"May God make him {33} comprehend (Faqqihahu),     and make him know the interpretation of the Qurán.\" Muhammad in his     quality of Judge and chief of the Believers decided, without appeal or     contradiction, all the affairs of the people. His sayings served as a     guide to the Companions. After the death of the Prophet the first     Khalífs acted on the authority of the Traditions. Meanwhile the Qurán     and the Sunnat, the principal elements of religion and legislation,     became little by little the subject of controversy. It was then that     men applied themselves vigorously to the task of learning by heart the     Qurán and the Traditions, and then that jurisprudence became a separate     science. No science had as yet been systematically taught, and the     early Musalmáns did not possess books which would serve for such     teaching. A change soon, however, took place. In the year in which the     great jurisconsult of Syria died (A.H. 80) N'imán bin Sabit, surnamed     Abu Hanífa was born. He is the most celebrated of the founders of the     schools of jurisprudence, a science which ranks first in all Muslim     seats of learning. Until that time and for thirty years later the     Mufassirs,[36] the Muhaddis,[37] and the Fuqihá,[38] had all their     knowledge by heart, and those who possessed good memories were highly     esteemed. Many of them knew by heart the whole Qurán with the comments     made on it by the Prophet and by the Companions; they also knew the     Traditions and their explanations, and all the commands (Ahkám) which     proceed from the Qurán, and the Sunnat. Such men enjoyed the right of     Mujtahidín. They transmitted their knowledge to their scholars orally.     It was not till towards the middle of the second century A.H. that     treatises on the different branches of the Law were written, after     which six schools (Mazhabs) of jurisprudence were formed. The founders,     all Imáms of the first class, were Abu Hanífa,"]]]
