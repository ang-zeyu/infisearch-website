Peter raced down in the evening with the light-footed little goats. When he whistled sharply through his fingers, every owner would come and get his or her goat. These owners were mostly small boys and girls and, as the goats were friendly, they did not fear them. That was the only time Peter spent with other children, the rest of the day the animals were his sole companions. At home lived his mother and an old blind grandmother, but he only spent enough time in the hut to swallow his bread and milk for breakfast and the same repast for supper. After that he sought his bed to sleep. He always left early in the morning and at night he came home late, so that he could be with his friends as long as possible. His father had met with an accident some years ago; he also had been called Peter the goatherd. His mother, whose name was Brigida, was called \"Goatherd Peter's wife\" and his blind grandmother was called by young and old from many miles about just \"grandmother.\"  Deta waited about ten minutes to see if the children were coming up behind with the goats. As she could not find them anywhere, she climbed up a little higher to get a better view down the valley from there, and peered from side to side with marks of great impatience on her countenance.  The children in the meantime were ascending slowly in a zigzag way, Peter always knowing where to find all sorts of good grazing places for his goats where they could nibble. Thus they strayed from side to side. The poor little girl had followed the boy only with the greatest effort and she was panting in her heavy clothes. She was so hot and uncomfortable that she only climbed by exerting all her strength. She did not say anything but looked enviously at Peter, who jumped about so easily in his light trousers and bare feet. She envied even more the goats that climbed over bushes, stones, and steep inclines with their slender legs. Suddenly sitting down on the ground the child swiftly took off her shoes and stockings. Getting up she undid the heavy shawl and the two little dresses. Out she slipped without more ado and stood up in only a light petticoat. In sheer delight at the relief, she threw up her dimpled arms, that were bare up to her short sleeves. To save the trouble of carrying them, her aunt had dressed her in her Sunday clothes over her workday garments. Heidi arranged her dresses neatly in a heap and joined Peter and the goats. She was now as light-footed as any of them. When Peter, who had not paid much attention, saw her suddenly in her light attire, he grinned. Looking back, he saw the little heap of dresses on the ground and then he grinned yet more, till his mouth seemed to reach from ear to ear; but he said never a word.  The child, feeling free and comfortable, started to converse with Peter, and he had to answer many questions. She asked him how many goats he had, and where he led them, what he did with them when he got there, and so forth.     [Illustration: SHE UNDID THE HEAVY SHAWL AND THE TWO LITTLE    DRESSES]  At last the children reached the summit in front of the hut. When Deta saw the little party of climbers she cried out shrilly: \"Heidi, what have you done? What a sight you are! Where are your dresses and your shawl? Are the new shoes gone that I just bought for you, and the new stockings that I made myself? Where are they all, Heidi?\"  The child quietly pointed down and said \"There.\"  The aunt followed the direction of her finger and descried a little heap with a small red dot in the middle, which she recognized as the shawl.  \"Unlucky child!\" Deta said excitedly. \"What does all this mean? Why have you taken your things all off?\"  \"Because I do not need them,\" said the child, not seeming in the least repentant of her deed.  \"How can you be so stupid, Heidi? Have you lost your senses?\" the aunt went on, in a tone of mingled vexation and reproach. \"Who do you think will go way down there to fetch those things up again? It is half-an-hour's walk. Please, Peter, run down and get them. Do not stand and stare at me as if you were glued to the spot.\"  \"I am late already,\" replied Peter, and stood without moving from the place where, with his hands in his trousers' pockets, he had witnessed the violent outbreak of Heidi's aunt.  \"There you are, standing and staring, but that won't get you further,\" said Deta. \"I'll give you this if you go down.\" With that she held a five-penny-piece under his eyes. That made Peter start and in a great hurry he ran down the straightest path. He arrived again in so short a time that Deta had to praise him and gave him her little coin without delay. He did not often get such a treasure, and therefore his face was beaming and he laughingly dropped the money deep into his pocket.  \"If you are going up to the uncle, as we are, you can carry the pack till we get there,\" said Deta. They still had to climb a steep ascent that lay behind Peter's hut. The boy readily took the things and followed Deta, his left arm holding the bundle and his right swinging the stick. Heidi jumped along gaily by his side with the goats.  After three quarters of an hour they reached the height where the hut of the old man stood on a prominent rock, exposed to every wind, but bathed in the full sunlight. From there you could gaze far down into the valley. Behind the hut stood three old fir-trees with great shaggy branches. Further back the old grey rocks rose high and sheer. Above them you could see green and fertile pastures, till at last the stony boulders reached the bare, steep cliffs.  Overlooking the valley the uncle had made himself a bench, by the side of the hut. Here he sat, with his pipe between his teeth and both hands resting on his knees. He quietly watched the children climbing up with the goats and Aunt Deta behind them, for the children had caught up to her long ago. Heidi reached the top first, and approaching the old man she held out her hand to him and said: \"Good evening, grandfather!\"  \"Well, well, what does that mean?\" replied the old man in a rough voice. Giving her his hand for only a moment, he watched her with a long and penetrating look from under his bushy brows. Heidi gazed back at him with an unwinking glance and examined him with much curiosity, for he was strange to look at, with his thick, grey beard and shaggy eyebrows, that met in the middle like a thicket.  Heidi's aunt had arrived in the meantime with Peter, who was eager to see what was going to happen.  \"Good-day to you, uncle,\" said Deta as she approached. \"This is Tobias's and Adelheid's child. You won't be able to remember her, because last time you saw her she was scarcely a year old.\"  \"Why do you bring her here?\" asked the uncle, and turning to Peter he said: \"Get away and bring my goats. How late you are already!\"  Peter obeyed and disappeared on the spot; the uncle had looked at him in such a manner that he was glad to go.  \"Uncle, I have brought the little girl for you to keep,\" said Deta. \"I have done my share these last four years and now it is your turn to provide for her.\"  The old man's eyes flamed with anger. \"Indeed!\" he said. \"What on earth shall I do, when she begins to whine and cry for you? Small children always do, and then I'll be helpless.\"  \"You'll have to look out for that!\" Deta retorted. \"When the little baby was left in my hands a few years ago, I had to find out how to care for the little innocent myself and nobody told me anything. I already had mother on my hands and there was plenty for me to do. You can't blame me if I want to earn some money now. If you can't keep the child, you can do with her whatever you please. If she comes to harm you are responsible and I am sure you do not want to burden your conscience any further.\"  Deta had said more in her excitement than she had intended, just because her conscience was not quite clear. The uncle had risen during her last words and now he gave her such a look that she retreated a few steps. Stretching out his arm in a commanding gesture, he said to her: \"Away with you! Begone! Stay wherever you came from and don't venture soon again into my sight!\"  Deta did not have to be told twice. She said \"Good-bye\" to Heidi and \"Farewell\" to the uncle, and started down the mountain. Like steam her excitement seemed to drive her forward, and she ran down at a tremendous rate. The people in the village called to her now more than they had on her way up, because they all were wondering where she had left the child. They were well acquainted with both and knew their history. When she heard from door and windows: \"Where is the child?\" \"Where have you left her, Deta?\" and so forth, she answered more and more reluctantly: \"Up with the Alm-Uncle,--with the Alm-Uncle!\" She became much provoked because the women called to her from every side: \"How could you do it?\" \"The poor little creature!\" \"The idea of leaving such a helpless child up there!\" and, over and over again: \"The poor little dear!\" Deta ran as quickly as she could and was glad when she heard no more calls, because, to tell the truth, she herself was uneasy. Her mother had asked her on her deathbed to care for Heidi. But she consoled herself with the thought that she would be able to do more for the child if she could earn some money. She was very glad to go away from people who interfered in her affairs, and looked forward with great delight to her new place.  [Illustration]     II  WITH THE GRANDFATHER   After Deta had disappeared, the Uncle sat down again on the bench, blowing big clouds of smoke out of his pipe. He did not speak, but kept his eyes fastened on the ground. In the meantime Heidi looked about her, and discovering the goat-shed, peeped in. Nothing could be seen inside. Searching for some more interesting thing, she saw the three old fir-trees behind the hut. Here the wind"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781"],["title","Heidi (#3)"],["body","roaring through the branches and the tree-tops were swaying to and fro. Heidi stood still to listen. After the wind had ceased somewhat, she walked round the hut back to her grandfather. She found him in exactly the same position, and planting herself in front of the old man, with arms folded behind her back, she gazed at him. The grandfather, looking up, saw the child standing motionless before him. \"What do you want to do now?\" he asked her.  \"I want to see what's in the hut,\" replied Heidi.  \"Come then,\" and with that the grandfather got up and entered the cottage.  \"Take your things along,\" he commanded.  \"I do not want them any more,\" answered Heidi.  The old man, turning about, threw a penetrating glance at her. The child's black eyes were sparkling in expectation of all the things to come. \"She is not lacking in intelligence,\" he muttered to himself. Aloud he added: \"Why don't you need them any more?\"  \"I want to go about like the light-footed goats!\"  \"All right, you can; but fetch the things and we'll put them in the cupboard.\" The child obeyed the command. The old man now opened the door, and Heidi followed him into a fairly spacious room, which took in the entire expanse of the hut. In one corner stood a table and a chair, and in another the grandfather's bed. Across the room a large kettle was suspended over the hearth, and opposite to it a large door was sunk into the wall. This the grandfather opened. It was the cupboard, in which all his clothes were kept. In one shelf were a few shirts, socks and towels; on another a few plates, cups and glasses; and on the top shelf Heidi could see a round loaf of bread, some bacon and cheese. In this cupboard the grandfather kept everything that he needed for his subsistence. When he opened it, Heidi pushed her things as far behind the grandfather's clothes as she could reach. She did not want them found again in a hurry. After looking around attentively in the room, she asked, \"Where am I going to sleep, grandfather?\"  \"Wherever you want to,\" he replied. That suited Heidi exactly. She peeped into all the corners of the room and looked at every little nook to find a cosy place to sleep. Beside the old man's bed she saw a ladder. Climbing up, she arrived at a hayloft, which was filled with fresh and fragrant hay. Through a tiny round window she could look far down into the valley.     [Illustration: HERE A NEAT LITTLE BED WAS PREPARED]  \"I want to sleep up here,\" Heidi called down. \"Oh, it is lovely here. Please come up, grandfather, and see it for yourself.\"  \"I know it,\" sounded from below.  \"I am making the bed now,\" the little girl called out again, while she ran busily to and fro. \"Oh, do come up and bring a sheet, grandfather, for every bed must have a sheet.\"  \"Is that so?\" said the old man. After a while he opened the cupboard and rummaged around in it. At last he pulled out a long coarse cloth from under the shirts. It somewhat resembled a sheet, and with this he climbed up to the loft. Here a neat little bed was already prepared. On top the hay was heaped up high so that the head of the occupant would lie exactly opposite the window.  The grandfather was well pleased with the arrangement. To prevent the hard floor from being felt, he made the couch twice as thick. Then he and Heidi together put the heavy sheet on, tucking the ends in well. Heidi looked thoughtfully at her fresh, new bed and said, \"Grandfather, we have forgotten something.\"  \"What?\" he asked.  \"I have no cover. When I go to bed I always creep in between the sheet and the cover.\"  \"What shall we do if I haven't any?\" asked the grandfather.  \"Never mind, I'll just take some more hay to cover me,\" Heidi reassured him, and was just going to the heap of hay when the old man stopped her.  \"Just wait one minute,\" he said, and went down to his own bed. From it he took a large, heavy linen bag and brought it to the child.  \"Isn't this better than hay?\" he asked.  Heidi pulled the sack to and fro with all her might, but she could not unfold it, for it was too heavy for her little arms. The grandfather put the thick cover on the bed while Heidi watched him. After it was all done, she said: \"What a nice bed I have now, and what a splendid cover! I only wish the evening was here, that I might go to sleep in it.\"  \"I think we might eat something first,\" said the grandfather. \"Don't you think so?\"  Heidi had forgotten everything else in her interest for the bed; but when she was reminded of her dinner, she noticed how terribly hungry she really was. She had had only a piece of bread and a cup of thin coffee very early in the morning, before her long journey. Heidi said approvingly: \"I think we might, grandfather!\"  \"Let's go down then, if we agree,\" said the old man, and followed close behind her. Going up to the fireplace, he pushed the big kettle aside and reached for a smaller one that was suspended on a chain. Then sitting down on a three-legged stool, he kindled a bright fire. When the kettle was boiling, the old man put a large piece of cheese on a long iron fork, and held it over the fire, turning it to and fro, till it was golden-brown on all sides. Heidi had watched him eagerly. Suddenly she ran to the cupboard. When her grandfather brought a pot and the toasted cheese to the table, he found it already nicely set with two plates and two knives and the bread in the middle. Heidi had seen the things in the cupboard and knew that they would be needed for the meal.  \"I am glad to see that you can think for yourself,\" said the grandfather, while he put the cheese on top of the bread, \"but something is missing yet.\"  Heidi saw the steaming pot and ran back to the cupboard in all haste. A single little bowl was on the shelf. That did not perplex Heidi though, for she saw two glasses standing behind. With those three things she returned to the table.  \"You certainly can help yourself! Where shall you sit, though?\" asked the grandfather, who occupied the only chair himself, Heidi flew to the hearth, and bringing back the little stool, sat down on it.  \"Now you have a seat, but it is much too low. In fact, you are too little to reach the table from my chair. Now you shall have something to eat at last!\" and with that the grandfather filled the little bowl with milk. Putting it on his chair, he pushed it as near to the stool as was possible, and in that way Heidi had a table before her. He commanded her to eat the large piece of bread and the slice of golden cheese. He sat down himself on a corner of the table and started his own dinner. Heidi drank without stopping, for she felt exceedingly thirsty after her long journey. Taking a long breath, she put down her little bowl.  \"How do you like the milk?\" the grandfather asked her.  \"I never tasted better,\" answered Heidi.  \"Then you shall have more,\" and with that the grandfather filled the little bowl again. The little girl ate and drank with the greatest enjoyment. After she was through, both went out into the goat-shed. Here the old man busied himself, and Heidi watched him attentively while he was sweeping and putting down fresh straw for the goats to sleep on. Then he went to the little shop alongside and fashioned a high chair for Heidi, to the little girl's greatest amazement.  \"What is this?\" asked the grandfather.  \"This is a chair for me. I am sure of it because it is so high. How quickly it was made!\" said the child, full of admiration and wonder.  \"She knows what is what and has her eyes on the right place,\" the grandfather said to himself, while he walked around the hut, fastening a nail or a loose board here and there. He wandered about with his hammer and nails, repairing whatever was in need of fixing. Heidi followed him at every step and watched the performance with great enjoyment and attention.  At last the evening came. The old fir-trees were rustling and a mighty wind was roaring and howling through the tree-tops. Those sounds thrilled Heidi's heart and filled it with happiness and joy. She danced and jumped about under the trees, for those sounds made her feel as if a wonderful thing had happened to her. The grandfather stood under the door, watching her, when suddenly a shrill whistle was heard. Heidi stood still and the grandfather joined her outside. Down from the heights came one goat after another, with Peter in their midst. Uttering a cry of joy, Heidi ran into the middle of the flock, greeting her old friends. When they had all reached the hut, they stopped on their way and two beautiful slender goats came out of the herd, one of them white and the other brown. They came up to the grandfather, who held out some salt in his hands to them, as he did every night. Heidi tenderly caressed first one and then the other, seeming beside herself with joy.  \"Are they ours, grandfather? Do they both belong to us? Are they going to the stable? Are they going to stay with us?\" Heidi kept on asking in her excitement. The grandfather hardly could put in a \"yes, yes, surely\" between her numerous questions. When the goats had licked up all the salt, the old man said, \"Go in, Heidi, and fetch your bowl and the bread.\"  Heidi obeyed and returned instantly. The grandfather milked a full bowl from the white goat, cut a piece of bread for the child, and told her to eat. \"Afterwards you can go to bed. If you need some shirts and other linen, you will find them in the bottom of the cupboard. Aunt Deta has left a bundle for you. Now good-night, I have to look after the goats and lock them up for the night.\"  \"Good-night, grandfather! Oh, please tell me what their names are,\" called Heidi after him.  \"The white one's name is Schw鄚li and the brown one I call B酺li,\" was his answer.  \"Good-night, Schw鄚li! Good-night, B酺li,\" the little girl called loudly, for they were just disappearing in the shed. Heidi now sat down on the bench and took her supper. The strong wind nearly blew her from her seat, so she hurried with her meal, to be able to go inside "]]]
