The sugar is not all like the common granulated sugar, but in ripe fruits a part is in the form known as levulose or fruit sugar, which is two and a half times sweeter than granulated sugar. Sugars are valuable for heat-and fat-producing purposes, but not for muscle repairing. Proteids are the muscle-forming nutrients. The organic acids, as malic acid in apples, citric acid in lemons and oranges, and tartaric acid in grapes, have characteristic medicinal properties. The sugar, proteid, and acid content of some of our more common fruits is given in the following table:[21]   COMPOSITION OF FRUITS    ==============================================================                   | WATER  |PROTEIDS| SUGAR  |ACID IN |KIND OF                   |        |        |        | JUICE  | ACID   ----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------                   |Per Cent|Per Cent|Per Cent|Per Cent|   Apples (Baldwin)|  85.0  |   0.50 |  10.75 |   0.92 |Malic   Apples, sweet   |  86.0  |   0.50 |  11.75 |   0.20 |Malic   Blackberries    |  88.9  |   0.90 |  11.50 |   0.75 |Malic   Currants        |  86.0  |    --  |   1.96 |   5.80 |Tartaric   Grapes          |  83.0  |   1.50 |10 to 16|1.2 to 5|Tartaric   Strawberries    |  90.8  |   0.95 |   5.36 |   1.40 |Malic   Oranges         |  85.0  |   1.10 |  10.00 |   1.30 |Citric   Lemons          |  84.0  |   0.95 |   2.00 |   7.20 |Citric   ==============================================================  In addition to sugars, acids, and proteids, there are a great many other compounds in fruits. Those which give the characteristic taste are called essential or volatile oils.  58. Food Value.--When the nutrients alone are considered, fruits appear to have a low food value, but they should not be judged entirely on this basis, because they impart palatability and flavor to other foods and exercise a favorable influence upon the digestive process. In the human ration fruits are a necessary adjunct.  59. Apples.--Apples vary in composition with the variety and physical characteristics of the fruit. In general they contain from 10 to 16 per cent of dry matter, of which 75 per cent, or more, is sugar or allied carbohydrates. Among the organic acids malic predominates, and the acidity ranges from 0.1 to 0.8 per cent. Apples contain but little protein, less than 1 per cent. There is some pectin, or jelly-like substance closely related to the carbohydrates. The flavor of the apple varies with the content of sugar, organic acids, and essential oils. During storage some apples appear to undergo further ripening, resulting in partial inversion of the sucrose, and there is a slight loss of weight, due to the formation of carbon dioxide. The apple is an important and valuable adjunct to the dietary.[22]  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--GRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF APPLE.]  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--GRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF ORANGE.]  60. Oranges contain nearly the same proportion of dry matter as apples, the larger part of which is sugar. Citric acid predominates and ranges in different varieties from 1 to 2.5 per cent. The amounts of protein, fat, and cellulose are small. In some varieties of oranges there is more iron and sulphur than is usually found in fruits. All fruits, however, contain small amounts, but not as much as is found in green vegetables. The average composition of oranges is as follows:    ===========================================================   PHYSICAL COMPOSITION|CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF EDIBLE PORTION   -----------------------------------------------------------               Per Cent|                   Per Cent   Rind        20 to 30| Solids            10 to 16   Pulp        25 to 35| Sugars             8 to 12   Juice       35 to 50| Citric acid        1 to 2.5                       | Ash                     0.5   ===========================================================  61. Lemons differ from oranges in containing more citric acid and less sucrose, levulose, and dextrose. The ash of the lemon is somewhat similar in general composition to the ash of the orange, but is larger in amount. The average composition of the lemon is as follows:    ===========================================================   PHYSICAL COMPOSITION|CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF EDIBLE PORTION   -----------------------------------------------------------               Per Cent|                 Per Cent   Rind        25 to 35| Solids          10 to 12   Pulp        25 to 35| Sugar            2 to 4   Juice       40 to 55| Citric acid      6 to 9   ===========================================================  62. Grape Fruit.--The rind and seed of this fruit make up about 25 per cent, leaving 75 per cent as edible portion. The juice contains 14 per cent solids, of which nearly 10 per cent is sugar and 2.5 per cent is citric acid. There is more acid in grape fruit than in oranges and appreciably less than in lemons. The characteristic flavor is due to a glucoside-like material. Otherwise the composition and food value are about the same as of oranges.  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--GRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF STRAWBERRY.]  63. Strawberries contain from 8 to 12 per cent of dry matter, mainly sugar and malic acid. The protein, fat, and ash usually make up less than 2 per cent. Essential oils and coloring substances are present in small amounts. It has been estimated that it would require 75 pounds of strawberries to supply the protein for a daily ration. Nevertheless they are valuable in the dietary. It has been suggested that the malic and other acids have antiseptic properties which, added to the appearance and palatability, make them a desirable food adjunct. Strawberries have high dietetic rather than high food value.  64. Grapes contain more dry matter than apples or oranges. There is no appreciable amount of protein or fat, and while they add some nutrients, as sugar, to the ration, they do not contribute any quantity. Their value, as in the case of other fruits, is due to palatability and indirect effect upon the digestibility of other foods. In the juice of grapes there is from 10 to 15 per cent or more of sugar, as sucrose, levulose, and dextrose. Grapes contain also from 1 to 1.5 per cent of tartaric acid, which, during the process of manufacture into wine, is rendered insoluble by the alcohol formed, and the product, known as argole, is used in the preparation of cream of tartar. Differences in flavor and taste of grapes are due to variations in the sugar, acid, and essential oil content.  65. Peaches contain about 12 per cent of dry matter, of which over 10 per cent is sugar and other carbohydrates. There is less than 1.5 per cent of protein, fat, and mineral matter and about 0.5 per cent of acid. The peach contains also a very small amount of hydrocyanic acid, which is more liberally present in the kernel than in the fruit. Flavor is imparted mainly by the sugar and essential oils. Peaches vary in composition with variety and environment.[23]  66. Plums contain the most dry matter of any of the fruits, about 22 per cent, mainly sugar. About one per cent is acid and about 0.5 per cent are protein and ash. There are a great many varieties of plums, varying in composition. Dried plums (prunes) have mildly laxative properties.  67. Olives.--The ripe olive contains about 15 per cent of oil, exclusive of the pit, which makes up 20 per cent of the weight. In green, preserved olives there is considerably less oil. Because of the oil the olive has food value. Olive oil is slightly laxative and assists mechanically in the digestion of foods.  68. Figs.--Dried figs contain about 50 per cent of sugar and 3.5 per cent of protein. The fig has a mildly laxative action.  69. Dried Fruits.--Many fruits are prepared for market by drying. The dried fruit has a slightly different composition from the fresh fruit because of loss of the volatile and essential oils, and minor chemical changes which take place during the drying process. When free from preservatives, dried fruits are valuable adjuncts to the dietary and can be advantageously used when fresh fruits are not obtainable.  70. Canning and Preservation of Fruits.--To obtain the best results in canning, the fruit should not be overripe. After the ripened state has been reached fermentation and bacterial changes occur, and it is more difficult to preserve the fruit than when not so fully matured.[24] When a fruit has begun to ferment, it is hard to destroy the ferment bodies and their spores so as to prevent further ferment action. The chemical changes that occur in the last stages of ripening are similar to those which take place during the cooking process whereby the pectin or jelly-like substances are rendered more soluble and digestible.  71. Adulterated Canned Fruits.--Analyses of a number of canned fruits, made by various Boards of Health, show the presence of small amounts of arsenic, tin, lead, and other poisonous metals. The quantity dissolved depends upon the kind, age, and condition of the canned goods and the state of the fruit when canned. The longer a can of fruit or vegetable has been kept in stock, the larger is the amount of tin or metal that has been dissolved. When fresh canned, there is usually very little dissolved tin, but in old goods the amount may be comparatively large. The tin used for the can is occasionally of poor quality and may contain some arsenic, which also is dissolved. The occasional use of canned goods preserved in tin is not objectionable, but they should not be used continually if it can be avoided. Preservatives, as borax, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, and sodium sulphate, are sometimes added to prevent fermentation and to preserve the natural appearance of the fruit or vegetable.[18]  72. Fruit Flavors and Extracts.--Formerly all fruit extracts and flavors were obtained from vegetable sources; at present many are made in the chemical laboratory by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20877"],["title","Mother West Wind's Children (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

HAW!\"     HE WAS SO SURPRISED HE FORGOT TO CLOSE IT     MOTHER WEST WIND'S CHILDREN   I  DANNY MEADOW MOUSE LEARNS WHY HIS TAIL IS SHORT  Danny Meadow Mouse sat in his doorway and looked down the Lone Little Path across the Green Meadows.  Way, way over near the Smiling Pool he could see Old Mother West Wind's Children, the Merry Little Breezes, at play.  Sammy Jay was sitting on a fence post.  He pretended to be taking a sun bath, but really he was planning mischief.  You never see Sammy Jay that he isn't in mischief or planning it.  Reddy Fox had trotted past an hour before in a great hurry.  Up on the hill Danny Meadow Mouse could just see Jimmy Skunk pulling over every old stick and stone he could find, no matter whose house it might be, and excusing himself because he was hungry and was looking for beetles.  Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was playing at hide and seek behind some fleecy white clouds.  All the birds were singing and singing, and the world was happy--all but Danny Meadow Mouse.  No, Danny Meadow Mouse was not happy.  Indeed, he was very far from happy, and all because his tail was short.  By and by up came old Mr. Toad.  It was a warm day and Mr. Toad was very hot and very, very thirsty.  He stopped to rest beside the house of Danny Meadow Mouse.  \"Good morning, Danny Meadow Mouse,\" said old Mr. Toad, \"it's a fine morning.\"  \"Morning,\" said Danny Meadow Mouse, grumpily.  \"I hope your health is good this morning,\" continued old Mr. Toad, just as if he hadn't noticed how short and cross Danny Meadow Mouse had answered.  Now old Mr. Toad is very ugly to look upon, but the ugliness is all in his looks.  He has the sunniest of hearts and always he is looking for a chance to help someone.  \"Danny Meadow Mouse,\" said old Mr. Toad, \"you make me think of your grandfather a thousand times removed.  You do indeed.  You look just as he did when he lost the half of his tail and realized that he never, never could get it back again.\"  Danny Meadow Mouse sat up suddenly.  \"What are you talking about, old Mr. Toad?  What are you talking about?\" he asked.  \"Did my grandfather a thousand times removed lose the half of his tail, and was it shorter then than mine is now?  Was it, old Mr. Toad?  And how did he come to lose the half of it?\"  Old Mr. Toad laughed a funny silent laugh.  \"It's a long story,\" said old Mr. Toad, \"and I'm afraid I can't tell it.  Go down to the Smiling Pool and ask Great-Grandfather Frog, who is my first cousin, how it happened your grandfather a thousand times removed lost the half of his tail.  But before you go catch three fat, foolish, green flies and take them with you as a present to Grandfather Frog.\"  Danny Meadow Mouse could hardly wait for old Mr. Toad to stop speaking. In fact, he was in such a hurry that he almost forgot his manners.  Not quite, however, for he shouted \"Thank you, Mr. Toad, thank you!\" over his shoulder as he rushed off down the Lone Little Path.  You see his short tail had always been a matter of mortification to Danny Meadow Mouse.  All his cousins in the Mouse family and the Rat family have long, smooth, tapering tails, and they have always been a source of envy to Danny Meadow Mouse.  He had felt his queer short tail to be a sort of disgrace.  So when he would meet one of his cousins dancing down the Lone Little Path, with his long, slim, tapering tail behind him, Danny Meadow Mouse would slip out of sight under the long grass, he was so ashamed of his own little tail.  It looked so mean and small!  He had wondered and wondered if the Meadow Mice had always had short tails.  He used to ask everyone who came his way if they had ever seen a Meadow Mouse with a long tail, but he had never found any one who had.  \"Perhaps,\" thought Danny Meadow Mouse as he hurried down the Lone Little Path, \"perhaps Grandfather Frog, who is very wise, will know why my tail is short.\"  So he hurried this way and he hurried that way over the Green Meadows in search of fat, foolish, green flies.  And when he had caught three, he caught one more for good measure.  Then he started for the Smiling Pool as fast as his short legs would take him.  When finally he reached the edge of the Smiling Pool he was quite out of breath.  There sat Great-Grandfather Frog on his big, green lily pad.  He was blinking his great goggle eyes at jolly, round, red Mr. Sun.  \"Oh, Grandfather Frog,\" said Danny Meadow Mouse in a very small voice, for you know he was quite out of breath with running, \"Oh, Grandfather Frog, I've brought you four fat, foolish, green flies.\"  Grandfather Frog put a hand behind an ear and listened.  \"Did I hear someone say 'foolish, green flies?'\" asked Grandfather Frog.  \"Yes, Grandfather Frog, here they are,\" said Danny Meadow Mouse, still in a very small voice.  Then he gave Grandfather Frog the four fat, foolish, green flies.  \"What is it that you want me to do for you, Danny Meadow Mouse?\" asked Grandfather Frog as he smacked his lips, for he knew that Danny Meadow Mouse must want something to bring him four fat, foolish, green flies.  \"If you please,\" said Danny Meadow Mouse, very politely, \"if you please, Grandfather Frog, old Mr. Toad told me that you could tell me how Grandfather Meadow Mouse a thousand times removed lost half of his tail.  Will you, Grandfather Frog--will you?\"  \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog.  \"My cousin, Mr. Toad, talks too much.\"  But he settled himself comfortably on the big lily pad, and this is what he told Danny Meadow Mouse:  \"Once upon a time, when the world was young, Mr. Meadow Mouse, your grandfather a thousand times removed, was a very fine gentleman.  He took a great deal of pride in his appearance, did Mr. Meadow Mouse, and they used to say on the Green Meadows that he spent an hour, a full hour, every day combing his whiskers and brushing his coat.  \"Anyway, he was very fine to look upon, was Mr. Meadow Mouse, and not the least attractive thing about him was his beautiful, long, slim tail, of which he was very proud.  \"Now about this time there was a great deal of trouble on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest, for some one was stealing--yes, stealing!  Mr. Rabbit complained first.  To be sure, Mr. Rabbit was lazy and his cabbage patch had grown little more than weeds while he had been minding other folks' affairs rather than his own, but, then, that was no reason why he should lose half of the little which he did raise.  And that is just what he said had happened.  \"No one really believed what Mr. Rabbit said, for he had such a bad name for telling things which were not so that when he did tell the truth no one could be quite sure of it.  \"So no one paid much heed to what Mr. Rabbit said until Happy Jack Squirrel one day went to his snug little hollow in the big chestnut tree where he stores his nuts and discovered half had been stolen. Then Striped Chipmunk lost the greater part of his winter store of corn.  A fat trout was stolen from Billy Mink.  \"It was a terrible time, for every one suspected every one else, and no one on the Green Meadows was happy.  \"One evening Mr. Meadow Mouse went for a stroll along the Crooked Little Path up the hill.  It was dark, very dark indeed.  But just as he passed Striped Chipmunk's granary, the place where he stores his supply of corn and acorns for the winter, Mr. Meadow Mouse met his cousin, Mr. Wharf Rat.  Now Mr. Wharf Rat was very big and strong and Mr. Meadow Mouse had for a long time looked up to and admired him.  \"'Good evening, Cousin Meadow Mouse,' said Mr. Wharf Rat, swinging a bag down from his shoulder.  'Will you do a favor for me?'  \"Now Mr. Meadow Mouse felt very much flattered, and as he was a very obliging fellow anyway, he promptly said he would.  \"'All right,' said Mr. Wharf Rat.  'I'm going to get you to tote this bag down the Crooked Little Path to the hollow chestnut tree.  I've got an errand back on top of the hill.'  \"So Mr. Meadow Mouse picked up the bag, which was very heavy, and swung it over his shoulder.  Then he started down the Crooked Little Path. Half way down he met Striped Chipmunk.  \"'Good evening, Mr. Meadow Mouse,' said Striped Chipmunk.  'What are you toting in the bag across your shoulder?'  \"Now, of course, Mr. Meadow Mouse didn't know "]]]
