The evening repast had just been finished, and the mother and son were walking slowly up and down the long porch overlooking the river in front of the house.  There was a curious and interesting likeness between the two,--a facial resemblance only, for Madam Talbot was a slender, rather frail little woman, and looked smaller by contrast as she walked by the side of her son, who had his arm affectionately thrown over her shoulder. She was as straight, however, as he was himself, in spite of her years and cares, and bore herself as proudly erect as in the days of her youth. Her black eyes looked out with undiminished lustre from beneath her snowy-white hair, which needed no powder and was covered by the mob cap she wore.  She looked every inch the lady of the manor, nor did her actions and words belie her appearance.  The subject of the conversation was evidently a serious one.  There was a troubled expression upon her face, in spite of her self-control, which was in marked contrast to the hesitating and somewhat irresolute look upon the handsome countenance of her son.  \"My son, my son,\" she said at last, \"why will you persist in approaching me upon this subject?  You know my opinions.  I have not hesitated to speak frankly, and it is not my habit to change them; in this instance they are as fixed and as immutable as the polar star.  The traditions and customs of four hundred years are behind me.  Our family--you know your father and I were cousins, and are descended from the same stock--have been called the 'loyal Talbots.'  I cannot contemplate with equanimity the possibility even of one of us in rebellion against the king.\"  \"Mother--I am sorry--grieved--but I must tell you that that is a possibility I fear you must learn to face.  I have--\"  \"Oh, Hilary, do not tell me you have finally decided to join this unrighteous rebellion.  Pause before you answer, my boy--I entreat you, and it is not my habit to entreat, as you very well know.  See, you have been the joy of my heart all my life, the idol of my soul,--I will confess it now,--and for you and your future I have lived and toiled and served and loved.  I have dreamed you great, high in rank and place, serving your king, winning back the ancient position of our family.  I have shrunk from no sacrifice, nor would I shrink from any.  'Tis not that I do not wish you to risk your life in war,--I am a daughter of my race, and for centuries they have been soldiers, and what God sends soldiers upon the field, that I can abide,--but that you should go now, with all your prospects, your ability, the opportunity presented you, and engage yourself in this fatal cause, in this unholy attack upon the king's majesty, connect yourself with this beggarly rabble who have been whipped and beaten every time they have come in contact with the royal troops,--I cannot bear it.  You are a man now.  You have grown away from your mother, Hilary, and I can no longer command, I must entreat.\"  But she spoke very proudly, for, as she said, entreaty was not so usual to her as command.  \"Oh, mother, mother, you make it very hard for me.  You know the colonists have been badly treated, and hardly used by king and Parliament.  Our liberties have been threatened, nay, have been abrogated, our privileges destroyed, none of our rights respected, and unless we are to sink to the level of mere slaves and dependants upon the mother country, we have no other course but an appeal to arms.\"  \"I know, I know all that,\" she interrupted impatiently, with a wave of her hand.  \"I have heard it all a thousand times from ill-balanced agitators and popular orators.  There may be some truth in it, of course, I grant you; but in my creed nothing, Hilary, nothing, will justify a subject in turning against his king.  The king can do no wrong.  All that we have is his; let him take what he will, so he leaves us our honor, and that, indeed, no one can take from us.  It is the principle that our ancestors have attested on a hundred fields and in every other way, and will you now be false to it, my boy?\"  \"I must be true to myself, mother, first of all, in spite of all the kings of earth; and I feel that duty and honor call me to the side of my friends and the people of this commonwealth.  I have hesitated long, mother, in deference to you, but now I have decided.\"  \"And you turn against two mothers, Hilary, when you take this course,--old England, the mother country, and this one, this old mother, who stands before you, who has given you her heart, who has lived for you, who lives in you now, whose devotion to you has never faltered; she now humbly asks with outstretched arms, the arms that carried you when you were a baby boy, that you remain true to your king.\"  \"Nay, but, mamma,\" he said, calling her by the sweet name of his boyhood, taking her hand and looking down at her tenderly with tear-dimmed eyes full of affection, \"one must be true to his idea of right and duty first of all, even at the price of his allegiance to a king; and, after all, what is any king beside you in my heart?  But I feel in honor bound to go with my people.\"  The irresolution was gone from his expression now, and the two determined faces--one full of pity, the other of apprehension--confronted each other.     CHAPTER VII  _The Loyal Talbots_  \"Your people, son?\" she said after a long pause.  \"Come with me a moment.\"  She drew him into the brilliantly lighted hall.  As they entered, he said to the servant in waiting,--  \"See that my bay horse is saddled and brought around at once, and do you tell Dick to get another horse ready and accompany me; he would better take the black pony.\"  \"Are you going out, Hilary?\"  \"Yes, mother, when our conversation is over, if there is time.  I thought to ride over to Colonel Wilton's.  The night is pleasant, and the moon will rise shortly.  What were you about to say to me?\"  She led him up to the great open fireplace, on the andirons of which a huge log was blazing and crackling cheerfully.  Over the mantel was the picture of a handsome man in the uniform of a soldier of some twenty years back.  \"Whose face is pictured there, Hilary?\"  \"My honored father,\" he answered reverently, but in some surprise.  \"And how died he?\"  \"On the Plains of Abraham, mother, as you well know.\"  \"Fighting for his king?\"  \"Yes, mother.\"  \"And who is this one?\" she said, passing to another picture.  \"Sir James Talbot; he struck for his king at Worcester,\" he volunteered.  \"Yes, Hilary; and here is his wife, Lady Caroline Talbot, my grandmother.  She kept the door against the Roundheads while the prince escaped from her castle, to which he had fled after the battle.  And over there is Lord Cecil Talbot, her father; he fell at Naseby.  There in that corner is another James, his brother, one of Prince Rupert's men, wounded at Marston Moor.  Here is Sir Hilary, slain at the Boyne; and this old man is Lord Philip, your great-uncle.  He was out in the '45, and was beheaded.  These are your people, Hilary,\" she said, standing very straight, her head thrown back, her eyes aflame with pride and determination, \"and these struck, fought, lived, and died for their king.  I could bear to see you dead,\" she laid her hand upon her heart in sudden fear at the idea, in spite of her brave words, \"but I could not bear to see you a rebel.  Think again.  You will not so decide?\"  She said it bravely; it was her final appeal, and as she made it she knew that it was useless.  The sceptre had departed out of her hand.  He smiled sadly at her, but shook his head ominously.  \"Mother, do you know these last fought for Stuart pretenders against the house of Hanover?  George III., in your creed, has no right to the place he holds.  Do I not then follow my ancestors in taking the field against him?\"  \"Ah, my child, 't is an unworthy subterfuge.  They did fight for the house of Stuart, God bless it!  It was king against king then, and at least they fought for royalty, for a king; but now the house of Stuart is gone; the new king occupies the throne undisputed, and our allegiance is due to him.  These unfortunate people who are fighting here strive to create a republic where all men shall be equal!  Said the sainted martyr Charles on the scaffold, ''T is no concern of the common people's how they are governed.'  A common man equal to a Talbot!  Fight, my son, if you must; but oh, fight for the king, even an usurper, before a republic, a mob in which so-called equality stands in very unstable equilibrium,--fight for the rightful ruler of the land, not against him.\"  \"Mother, if I am to believe the opinions of those whom I have been taught to respect, the rightful rulers of this colony, of our country, of any country, are the people who inhabit it.\"  \"And who says that, pray, my boy?\"  \"Mr. Henry.\"  \"And do you mean to tell me, a Talbot, that you have been taught to look up to men of the social stamp of Patrick Henry, or to respect their opinions?\" she said with ineffable disdain.  \"Mother, the logic of events has forced all men to do so.  Had you heard his speeches before the Burgesses at Williamsburg, you would have thought that he was second to no man in the colony, or in the world beside; but if he be not satisfactory, there is his excellency General Washington.\"  \"Mr. Washington,\" she replied with an emphasis on the \"Mr.\"  \"Now there, I grant you, is a man,\" she said reluctantly.  \"I cannot understand the perversion of his destiny or the folly of his course.\"  \"And,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20791"],["title","For Love of Country: A Story of Land and Sea in the Days of the Revolution (#8)"],["body","er, you know his family was as loyal as our own.  One of his forefathers held Worcester for King Charles with the utmost gallantry and resolution.  And he had as a companion in arms in that brave attempt Sir George Talbot, one of our ancestors.  There is an example for you.  I have often heard you speak with the greatest respect of George Washington.\"  \"It is true, my son,\" she replied honestly, \"but I am at a loss to fathom his motive.  What can it be?\"  \"Mother, I am persuaded of the purity of his motives; his actions spring from the very highest sense of his personal obligation to the cause of liberty.\"  \"'Liberty, liberty,' 't is a weak word when matched with loyalty.  But be this as it may, my son, it is beside the question.  Our family, these men and women who look down upon us, all fought for principles of royalty.  It makes no difference whether or no they fought for or against one or another king, so long as it was a king they fought for. Such a thing as a democracy never entered their heads.  And if you take this course, you will be false to every tradition of our past.  In my opinion, the people are not fit to govern, and you will find it so.  In the impious attempt that is being made to reverse what I conceive to be the divinely appointed polity and law of God, disaster must be the only end.\"  \"Mother, I must follow my convictions in the present rather than any examples in the past.  But this is a painful discussion.  Should we not best end it?  I honor your opinions, I love you, but I must go.\"  There was a long silence.  She broke it.  \"Well, my child,\" she said in despair, \"you have reached man's estate, and the men of the Talbot race have ever been accustomed to do as their judgment dictates.  If you have decided to join Washington's rabble and take part among the rebels in this fratricidal contest, I shall say no more.  I cannot further oppose you.  I cannot give you my blessing--as I might in happier circumstances--nor can I wish success to your cause.  I too am a Talbot, and have my principles, which I must also maintain; but at least I can gird your sword about you, and express the hope and make the prayer, as I do, that you may wear and use it honorably; and that hope, if you are true to the traditions of our house, will never be broken,--I feel sure of that, at least.\"  The young man bent and kissed his mother, a new light shining in his eyes.  \"Mother, I thank you.  At least, as far as I am concerned, I will endeavor to do my duty honorably in every field.  And now I think, with your permission, I will go over and tell Katharine that I have at last made up my mind and cast my lot in with her--I mean with our country,\" he said, blushing, but with the thoughtless disregard of youth as to the meaning and effect of his words.  \"Go, my son, and God be with you!\" she said solemnly.  He stepped quickly out on the porch, and, swinging into the saddle of the horse which awaited him, with the ease and grace of an accomplished horseman, galloped off in the moonlight night followed by the groom.  The little old woman stood rigidly in the doorway a moment, looking after her departed son, and then she walked quickly down to a rustic seat on the brow of the hill and sat down heavily, following with straining eyes and yearning heart his rapidly disappearing figure.  The same pang that every mother must feel, those who have a son at least, once in her life if no more, came to her heart; all her prayers had been unavailing, her requests unheeded, her pleas and wishes disregarded.  She had an idea, not altogether warranted perhaps, but still she had it, that the influence was not so much the example of General Washington, nor the eloquence of Patrick Henry, nor the force of neighborly example, nor rigid principle, but the influence of a sunny head, and a pair of youthful eyes, and a merry laugh, and a young heart, and a pleading voice.  These have always stood in the light of a mother since the world began, and these have taken her son from her side.  All her hopes gone, her dreams shattered, her sacrifice vain, her love wasted, she bowed her white head upon her thin hands, and wept quietly in the silent night.  The deep waters had gone over her soul, and the rare tears of the old woman bespoke a breaking heart.     CHAPTER VIII  _An Untold Story_  There were two roads which led from Fairview Hall to the home of the Wiltons,--one by the river, and the other over the hills farther inland.  Talbot had chosen the river-road, and was riding along with a light heart, forgetful of his mother and those tears which indeed she would not have shown him, and full of pleasant anticipations as to the effect of his decision upon Katharine.  As he rode along in the moonlight, his mind, full of that calm repose which comes to men when they have finally arrived at a decision upon some point which has troubled them, felt free to range where it would, and naturally his thoughts turned toward the girl he loved.  He was getting along in life, twenty-four his last birthday, while Katharine was several years his junior.  It was time to settle himself; and if he must ride away to the wars, it were well, pleasant at least, to think that he was leaving at home a wife over whom he had thrown the protecting aegis of his name.  Katharine would be much happier,--his thoughts dwelt tenderly upon her,--and the definite arrangement would be better than this tacit understanding, which of course was sufficiently binding; though, now he thought of it, Katharine had seemed a little difficult of late, probably because of the indefinite character of the tie.  He laughed boyishly in pleasure at his own thought.  It was another proof that she loved him, that she resented any assumption on his part based on hopes indulged in and plans formed by her father and his mother.  He must declare himself at once.  Poor mother! it was hard for her; but she would soon get over all that, and when he came back distinguished and honored by the people, she would feel very differently.  As for the capricious Katharine, he would speak out that very night, never doubting the issue, and get it done with.  Of course, that was all that was necessary.  When she knew that he was engaged heart and soul in the cause of the Revolution, she would be ready to yield him anything.  Not that he had any doubt of the result of his proposal in any case; as soon doubt that the nature and orderly sequence of events should be suddenly and violently interrupted, as imagine that these cherished plans, in which they had both acquiesced so long ago, should fall through.  And so my lord was prepared to drop the handkerchief at the feet of my lady for her to pick up!  It was a time, however, he might have remembered, in which the old established order of events in other fields, which men had long since conceived of as fixed as natural laws, was being rudely broken and destroyed.  Many things which had heretofore been habitually taken for granted, now were required to be proved, and Talbot was destined to meet the fate of every over-confident lover.  Devotion, self-abnegation, persistency,--these during ten days had held the field; and the result of the campaign had been that inevitable one which may always be looked for when the opposing forces, even after years of possession, muster under the banner of habit, assurance, confidence, and neglect.  So musing, the light-hearted gentleman galloped along.  The intervening distance was soon passed over, and Talbot found himself entering the familiar stretch of woodland which marked the beginning of the colonel's estate.  Under the trees and beneath the high bank of the river the shadows deepened; scarcely any light from the moon fell on the road.  It was well, therefore, that our cavalier drew rein, and somewhat checked the pace of his horse, advancing with some caution over the familiar yet unseen road; for just as he came opposite the land end of the pier which led out to the boat-house, the animal stopped with such suddenness that a less practised rider would have suffered a severe fall.  The horse snorted and trembled in terror, and began rearing and backing away from the spot.  Looking down in the darkness, Talbot could barely discern a dark, bulky object lying in the road.  \"Here, Dick!\" he called to the groom, who had stopped and reined in his own horse, apparently as terrified as the other, a few paces back of his master; and tossing his bridle rein toward him, \"take my horse, while I see what stopped him.\"  Lightly leaping to the ground, and stepping up to the object before him, he bent down and laid his hand upon it, and then started back in surprise and horror.  \"It's a man,\" he exclaimed; \"dead, yet warm still.  Who can it be?\"  The moonlight fell upon the pebbly beach of the river a little farther out; overcoming his reluctance, he half lifted, half carried the body out where the light would fall upon its face.  This face, which was unknown to him, was that of a desperate-looking ruffian, who was dressed in a soiled and tattered uniform, the coat of which was red; the man's hand tightly clasped a discharged pistol; he had been shot in the breast, for where his coat had fallen open might be seen a dark red stain about a ragged hole in his soiled gray shirt; the bullet had been fired at short range, too, for there were powder marks all about his breast.  Talbot noticed these things rapidly, his mind working quickly.  \"Oh, Mars' Hil'ry--wha-wha's de mattah?  I kyarnt hol' dese hosses; dey'se sumfin wrong, sho'ly,\" broke in the groom, his teeth chattering with terror.  \"Quiet, man! don't make so much noise.  This is the dead body of a man, a soldier; he has been shot too.  Take the horses back beyond the old tree on the little bend there; tie them securely, and come back here quickly.  Make no noise.  Bring the pistols from your holsters.\"  As the man turned to obey him, Talbot glanced about in perplexity, and his eyes fell upon a"]]]
