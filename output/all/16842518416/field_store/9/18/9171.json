Does Your Majesty know that he has recruited the Security Guard up to at least ten times the strength needed to meet any conceivable peace-maintenance problem on this planet, and that he has been piling up huge quantities of heavy combat equipment--guns up to 200-millimeter, heavy contragravity, even gun-cutters and bomb-and-rocket boats? And does Your Majesty know that most of this armament is massed within fifteen minutes' flight-time of this Palace? Or that Prince Travann has at his disposal from two and a half to three times, in men and firepower, the combined strength of the Planetary Militia and the Imperial Army on this planet?\"  \"I know. It has my approval. He's trying to salvage some of the young nonworkers through exposing them to military discipline. A good many of them, I believe, have gone off-planet on their discharge from the SG and hired as mercenaries, which is a far better profession than vote selling.\"  \"Quite a plausible explanation: Prince Travann is nothing if not plausible,\" the Prime Minister agreed. \"And does Your Majesty know that, because of repeated demands for support from the Ministry of Security, the Imperial Navy has been scattered all over the Empire, and that there is not a naval craft bigger than a scout-boat within fifteen hundred light-years of Odin?\"  That was absolutely true. Paul could only nod agreement. Prince Ganzay continued:  \"He has been doing some peculiar things as Police Chief of Asgard, too. For instance, there are two powerful nonworkers' voting-bloc bosses, Big Moogie Blisko and Zikko the Nose--I assure Your Majesty that I am not inventing these names; that's what the persons are actually called--who have been enjoying the favor and support of Prince Travann. On a number of occasions, their smaller rivals, leaders of less important gangs, have been arrested, often on trumped-up charges, and held incommunicado until either Moogie or Zikko could move into their territories and annex their nonworker followers. These two bloc-bosses are subsidized, respectively, by the Steel and Shipbuilding Cartels and by the Reaction Products and Chemical Cartels, but actually, they are controlled by Prince Travann. They, in turn, control between them about seventy per cent of the nonworkers in Asgard.\"  \"And you think this adds up to a plot against the Throne?\"  \"A plot to seize the Throne, Your Majesty.\"  \"Oh, come, Prince Ganzay! You're talking like Dorflay!\"  \"Hear me out, Your Majesty. His Imperial Highness is fourteen years old; it will be eleven years before he will be legally able to assume the powers of emperor. In the dreadful event of your immediate death, it would mean a regency for that long. Of course, your Ministers and Counselors would be the ones to name the Regent, but I know how they would vote with Security Guard bayonets at their throats. And regency might not be the limit of Prince Travann's ambitions.\"  \"In your own words, quite plausible, Prince Ganzay. It rests, however, on a very questionable foundation. The assumption that Prince Travann is stupid enough to want the Throne.\"  He had to terminate the conversation himself and blank the screen. Viktor Ganzay was still staring at him in shocked incredulity when his image vanished. Viktor Ganzay could not imagine anybody not wanting the Throne, not even the man who had to sit on it.         *       *       *       *       *  He sat, for a while, looking at the darkened screen, a little worried. Viktor Ganzay had a much better intelligence service than he had believed. He wondered how much Ganzay had found out that he hadn't mentioned. Then he went back to the reports. He had gotten down to the Ministry of Fine Arts when the communications screen began calling attention to itself again.  When he flipped the switch, a woman smiled out of it at him. Her blond hair was rumpled, and she wore a dressing gown; her smile brightened as his face appeared in her screen.  \"Hi!\" she greeted him.  \"Hi, yourself. You just get up?\"  She raised a hand to cover a yawn. \"I'll bet you've been up reigning for hours. Were Rod and Snooks in to see you yet?\"  He nodded. \"They just left. Rod's going on a picnic with Olva in the mountains.\" How long had it been since he and Marris had been on a picnic--a real picnic, with less than fifty guards and as many courtiers along? \"Do you have much reigning to do, this afternoon?\"  She grimaced. \"Flower Festivals. I have to make personal tri-di appearances, live, with messages for the loving subjects. Three minutes on, and a two-minute break between. I have forty for this afternoon.\"  \"Ugh! Well, have a good time, sweetheart. All I have is lunch with the Bench, and then this Plenary Session.\" He told her about Ganzay's fear of outright controversy.  \"Oh, fun! Maybe somebody'll pull somebody's whiskers, or something. I'm in on that, too.\"  The call-indicator in front of him began glowing with the code-symbol of the Minister of Security.  \"We can always hope, can't we? Well, Yorn Travann's trying to get me, now.\"  \"Don't keep him waiting. Maybe I can see you before the Session.\" She made a kissing motion with her lips at him, and blanked the screen.  He flipped the switch again, and Prince Travann was on the screen. The Security Minister didn't waste time being sorry to bother him.  \"Your Majesty, a report's just come in that there's a serious riot at the University; between five and ten thousand students are attacking the Administration Center, lobbing stench bombs into it, and threatening to hang Chancellor Khane. They have already overwhelmed and disarmed the campus police, and I've sent two companies of the Gendarme riot brigade, under an officer I can trust to handle things firmly but intelligently. We don't want any indiscriminate stunning or tear-gassing or shooting; all sorts of people can have sons and daughters mixed up in a student riot.\"  \"Yes. I seem to recall student riots in which the sons of his late Highness Prince Travann and his late Majesty Rodrik XXI were involved.\" He deliberated the point for a moment, and added: \"This scarcely sounds like a frat-fight or a panty-raid, though. What seems to have triggered it?\"  \"The story I got--a rather hysterical call for help from Khane himself--is that they're protesting an action of his in dismissing a faculty member. I have a couple of undercovers at the University, and I'm trying to contact them. I sent more undercovers, who could pass for students, ahead of the Gendarmes to get the student side of it and the names of the ring-leaders.\" He glanced down at the indicator in front of him, which had begun to glow. \"If you'll pardon me, sir, Count Tammsan's trying to get me. He may have particulars. I'll call Your Majesty back when I learn anything more.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There hadn't been anything like that at the University within the memory of the oldest old grad. Chancellor Khane, he knew, was a stupid and arrogant old windbag with a swollen sense of his own importance. He made a small bet with himself that the whole thing was Khane's fault, but he wondered what lay behind it, and what would come out of it. Great plagues from little microbes start. Great and frightening changes----  The screen got itself into an uproar, and he flipped the switch. It was Viktor Ganzay again. He looked as though his permanent toothache had deserted him for the moment.  \"Sorry to bother Your Majesty, but it's all fixed up,\" he reported. \"First Citizen Yaggo agreed to alternate in precedence with King Ranulf, and Lord Koreff has withdrawn all his objections. As far as I can see, at present, there should be no trouble.\"  \"Fine. I suppose you heard about the excitement at the University?\"  \"Oh, yes, Your Majesty. Disgraceful affair!\"  \"Simply shocking. What seems to have started it, have you heard?\" he asked. \"All I know is that the students were protesting the dismissal of a faculty member. He must have been exceptionally popular, or else he got a more than ordinary raw deal from Khane.\"  \"Well, as to that, sir, I can't say. All I learned was that it was the result of some faculty squabble in one of the science departments; the grounds for the dismissal were insubordination and contempt for authority.\"  \"I always thought that when authority began inspiring contempt, it had stopped being authority. Did you say science? This isn't going to help Duklass and Tammsan any.\"  \"I'm afraid not, Your Majesty.\" Ganzay didn't look particularly regretful. \"The News Cartel's gotten hold of it and are using it; it'll be all over the Empire.\"  He said that as though it meant something. Well, maybe it did; a lot of Ministers and almost all the Counselors spent most of their time worrying about what people on planets like Chermosh and Zarathustra and Deirdre and Quetzalcoatl might think, in ignorance of the fact that interest in Empire politics varied inversely as the square of the distance to Odin and the level of corruption and inefficiency of the local government.  \"I notice you'll be at the Bench luncheon. Do you think you could invite our guests, too? We could have an informal presentation before it starts. Can do? Good. I'll be seeing you there.\"  When the screen was blanked, he returned to the reports, ran them off hastily to make sure that nothing had been red-starred, and called a robot to clear the projector. After a while, Prince Travann called again.  \"Sorry to bother Your Majesty, but I have most of the facts on the riot, now. What happened was that Chancellor Khane sacked a professor, physics department, under circumstances which aroused resentment among the science students. Some of them walked out of class and went to the stadium to hold a protest "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20659"],["title","Ministry of Disturbance (#4)"],["body","meeting, and the thing snowballed until half the students were in it. Khane lost his head and ordered the campus police to clear the stadium; the students rushed them and swamped them. I hope, for their sakes, that none of my men ever let anything like that happen. The man I sent, a Colonel Handrosan, managed to talk the students into going back to the stadium and continuing the meeting under Gendarme protection.\"  \"Sounds like a good man.\"  \"Very good, Your Majesty. Especially in handling disturbances. I have complete confidence in him. He's also investigating the background of the affair. I'll give Your Majesty what he's learned, to date. It seems that the head of the physics department, a Professor Nelse Dandrik, had been conducting an experiment, assisted by a Professor Klenn Faress, to establish more accurately the velocity of subnucleonic particles, beta micropositos, I believe. Dandrik's story, as relayed to Handrosan by Khane, is that he reached a limit and the apparatus began giving erratic results.\"  Prince Travann stopped to light a cigarette. \"At this point, Professor Dandrik ordered the experiment stopped, and Professor Faress insisted on continuing. When Dandrik ordered the apparatus dismantled, Faress became rather emotional about it--obscenely abusive and threatening, according to Dandrik. Dandrik complained to Khane, Khane ordered Faress to apologize, Faress refused, and Khane dismissed Faress. Immediately, the students went on strike. Faress confirmed the whole story, and he added one small detail that Dandrik hadn't seen fit to mention. According to him, when these micropositos were accelerated beyond sixteen and a fraction times light-speed, they began registering at the target before the source registered the emission.\"  \"Yes, I--_What did you say_?\"  Prince Travann repeated it slowly, distinctly and tonelessly.  \"That was what I thought you said. Well, I'm going to insist on a complete investigation, including a repetition of the experiment. Under direction of Professor Faress.\"  \"Yes, Your Majesty. And when that happens, I mean to be on hand personally. If somebody is just before discovering time-travel, I think Security has a very substantial interest in it.\"  The Prime Minister called back to confirm that First Citizen Yaggo and King Ranulf would be at the luncheon. The Chamberlain, Count Gadvan, called with a long and dreary problem about the protocol for the banquet. Finally, at noon, he flashed a signal for General Dorflay, waited five minutes, and then left his desk and went out, to find the mad general and his wirehaired soldiers drawn up in the hall.         *       *       *       *       *  There were more Thorans on the South Upper Terrace, and after a flurry of porting and presenting and ordering arms and hand-saluting, the Prime Minister advanced and escorted him to where the Bench of Counselors, all thirty of them, total age close to twenty-eight hundred years, were drawn up in a rough crescent behind the three distinguished guests. The King of Durendal wore a cloth-of-silver leotard and pink tights, and a belt of gold links on which he carried a jeweled dagger only slightly thicker than a knitting needle. He was slender and willowy, and he had large and soulful eyes, and the royal beautician must have worked on him for a couple of hours. Wait till Marris sees this; oh, brother!  Koreff, the Lord Marshal, wore what was probably the standard costume of Durendal, a fairly long jerkin with short sleeves, and knee-boots, and his dress dagger looked as though it had been designed for use. Lord Koreff looked as though he would be quite willing and able to use it; he was fleshy and full-faced, with hard muscles under the flesh.  First Citizen Yaggo, People's Manager-in-Chief of and for the Planetary Commonwealth of Aditya, wore a one-piece white garment like a mechanic's coveralls, with the emblem of his government and the numeral 1 on his breast. He carried no dagger; if he had worn a dress weapon, it would probably have been a slide rule. His head was completely shaven, and he had small, pale eyes and a rat-trap mouth. He was regarding the Durendalians with a distaste that was all too evidently reciprocated.  King Ranulf appeared to have won the toss for first presentation. He squeezed the Imperial hand in both of his and looked up adoringly as he professed his deep honor and pleasure. Yaggo merely clasped both his hands in front of the emblem on his chest and raised them quickly to the level of his chin, saying: \"At the service of the Imperial State,\" and adding, as though it hurt him, \"Your Imperial Majesty.\" Not being a chief of state, Lord Koreff came third; he merely shook hands and said, \"A great honor, Your Imperial Majesty, and the thanks, both of myself and my royal master, for a most gracious reception.\" The attempt to grab first place having failed, he was more than willing to forget the whole subject. There was a chance that finding a way to dispose of the grain surplus might make the difference between his staying in power at home or not.  Fortunately, the three guests had already met the Bench of Counselors. Immediately after the presentation of Lord Koreff, they all started the two hundred yards march to the luncheon pavilion, the King of Durendal clinging to his left arm and First Citizen Yaggo stumping dourly on his right, with Prince Ganzay beyond him and Lord Koreff on Ranulf's left.  \"Do you plan to stay long on Odin?\" he asked the king.  \"Oh. I'd _love_ to stay for simply _months_! Everything is so _wonderful_, here in Asgard; it makes our little capital of Roncevaux seem so _utterly_ provincial. I'm going to tell Your Imperial Majesty a secret. I'm going to see if I can lure some of your _wonderful_ ballet dancers back to Durendal with me. Aren't I _naughty_, raiding Your Imperial Majesty's theaters?\"  \"In keeping with the traditions of your people,\" he replied gravely. \"You Sword-Worlders used to raid everywhere you went.\"  \"I'm afraid those bad old days are long past, Your Imperial Majesty,\" Lord Koreff said. \"But we Sword-Worlders got around the galaxy, for a while. In fact, I seem to remember reading that some of our brethren from Morglay or Flamberge even occupied Aditya for a couple of centuries. Not that you'd guess it to look at Aditya now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was First Citizen Yaggo's turn to take precedence--the seat on the right of the throne chair. Lord Koreff sat on Ranulf's left, and, to balance him, Prince Ganzay sat beyond Yaggo and dutifully began inquiring of the People's Manager-in-Chief about the structure of his government, launching him on a monologue that promised to last at least half the luncheon. That left the King of Durendal to Paul; for a start, he dropped a compliment on the cloth-of-silver leotard.  King Ranulf laughed dulcetly, brushed the garment with his fingertips, and said that it was just a simple thing patterned after the Durendalian peasant costume.  \"You have peasants on Durendal?\"  \"Oh, _dear_, yes! Such quaint, _charming_ people. Of course, they're all poor, and they wear such _funny_ ragged clothes, and travel about in rackety old aircars, it's a wonder they don't fall apart in the air. But they're so _wonderfully_ happy and carefree. I often wish I were one of them, instead of king.\"  \"Nonworking class, Your Imperial Majesty,\" Lord Koreff explained.  \"On Aditya,\" First Citizen Yaggo declared, \"there are no classes, and on Aditya everybody works. 'From each according to his ability; to each according to his need.'\"  \"On Aditya,\" an elderly Counselor four places to the right of him said loudly to his neighbor, \"they don't call them classes, they call them sociological categories, and they have nineteen of them. And on Aditya, they don't call them nonworkers, they call them occupational reservists, and they have more of them than we do.\"  \"But of course, I was born a king,\" Ranulf said sadly and nobly. \"I have a duty to my people.\"  \"No, they don't vote at all,\" Lord Koreff was telling the Counselor on his left. \"On Durendal, you have to pay taxes before you can vote.\"  \"On Aditya the crime of taxation does not exist,\" the First Citizen told the Prime Minister.  \"On Aditya,\" the Counselor four places down said to his neighbor, \"there's nothing to tax. The state owns all the property, and if the Imperial Constitution and the Space Navy let them, the State would own all the people, too. Don't tell me about Aditya. First big-ship command I had was the old _Invictus_, 374, and she was based on Aditya for four years, and I'd sooner have spent that time in orbit around Niffelheim.\"  Now Paul remembered who he was; old Admiral--now Prince-Counselor--Gaklar. He and Prince-Counselor Dorflay would get along famously. The Lord Marshal of Durendal was replying to some objection somebody had made:  [Illustration]  \"No, nothing of the sort. We hold the view that every civil or political right implies a civil or political obligation. The citizen has a right to protection from the Realm, for instance; he therefore has the obligation to defend the Realm. And his right to participate in the government of the Realm includes his obligation to support the Realm financially. Well, we tax only property; if a nonworker acquires taxable property, he has to go to work to earn the taxes. I might add that our nonworkers are very careful to avoid acquiring taxable property.\"  \"But if they don't have votes to sell, what do they live on?\" a Counselor asked in bewilderment.  \"The nobility supports them; the landowners, the trading barons, the industrial lords. The more nonworking adherents they have, the greater their prestige.\" And the more rifles they could muster when they quarreled with their fellow nobles, of course. \"Beside, if we didn't do that, they'd turn brigand, and it costs less to support them than to have to hunt them out of the brush and hang them.\"  \"On Aditya, brigandage does not exist.\"  \"On Aditya,"]]]
