I don't know whether your lives are in danger or not, but _please_ co-operate with us. Please report immediately anything of a suspicious nature that you see.\"  \"Of course, we will,\" Frank Corson said. \"I didn't see any signs of hostility in the other one, though.\"  \"Be that as it may, we _must_ get our hands on him.\"  \"If he did kill the one with the broken leg,\" King said, \"wouldn't he have left town?\"  \"If he thinks like a murderer, yes. But he probably doesn't. That's the trouble. We don't know how he thinks or what he's here for. We're playing it by ear.\"  \"I think we understand,\" Frank Corson said.  \"Thank you. And I'm sorry if I antagonized you. That wasn't my purpose. I'm just trying to do my job.\" He smiled and held out his hand. \"This is all strictly confidential, of course.\"  \"Of course.\"  \"Thanks for coming.\"  They left, but Brent Taber's frustrations remained with him. Earlier that day, in Washington, he'd stood on the carpet himself, before higher authority, and played the part of the reprimanded schoolboy.  \"It would appear,\" Authority said, \"that you went out of your way to antagonize Senator Crane.\"  \"I'm sorry if that's the opinion up above.\"  \"It is not a matter of opinion, one way or another. It's a matter of expediency. The Administration has to get along with Congress. Senator Crane is in a powerful position. He is on three committees that can hamper legislation the Administration is vitally interested in.\"  \"I understand. And I didn't pick the quarrel with Senator Crane. He picked it with me. In my judgment, he is not the kind of person to be trusted with information of this vital nature.\"  \"You consider Senator Crane an unreliable demagogue?\"  \"I didn't say that.\"  Authority smiled wryly. \"I'll concede that the Senator's type is rare in American politics--at least among those who get elected to high office. But the fact remains--he is a power.\"  \"If you agree that the information should have been withheld--\"  \"I didn't agree on that at all,\" Authority said quickly. \"And don't quote me as having said so. I'll deny it.\"  Brent Taber smiled also, but inwardly, where it wouldn't show. He should have expected that denial. After all, Authority had Higher Authority to account to. Authority could also be put on the carpet. There was always Someone higher up.  \"I'm sorry,\" Brent Taber said. \"I was put in charge of this project and I used my judgment--\"  \"We are not questioning your over-all judgment,\" Authority assured him.  _Then what in the hell are you gabbling about?_ This question was also asked inwardly as Brent said, \"I felt the gravity of the situation merited extreme care.\"  \"It does. But life must go on. The government must still function.\"  _That's right, play it from both ends_, Brent Taber thought bitterly. _Ride the fence. Stay in a position to jump either way._  \"What do you wish me to do about Senator Crane?\"  \"I'd stay out of his way if I were you.\"  \"Whatever damage you say I have done can be corrected with a ten-minute briefing.\"  \"That's up to you,\" Authority answered nimbly. \"As you say, you've been put in charge of the project.\"  \"Then I'll leave things as they are.\"  \"Very well. I just wanted to go on record.\"  \"Thank you,\" Brent Taber said. \"Thank you very much.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Frank Corson and Les King walked north together after their interview with Brent Taber.  \"I guess we got off lucky,\" King said. \"Those Washington appointees can be tough.\"  \"He seems to have a pretty tough job.\"  \"They all think they've got tough jobs.\"  \"It's still a murder as far as the New York police are concerned. What do you think will happen?\"  \"They turned us over to Taber, didn't they?\" King asked. \"That shows how they're playing it. The New York cops have enough murders to worry about. They like to pass them on to somebody else.\"  \"Then they won't question us any further?\"  King shrugged. \"Who knows? You've got nothing to worry about, though. Just sit tight. In fact, you're damned lucky.\"  \"How so?\"  \"This killing is under wraps. Nobody's talking. That means you won't get in trouble at the hospital.\" King grinned. \"Your _ethics_ won't come under scrutiny.\"  Frank Corson flushed and said nothing. King, after a moment's silence, said, \"I've been thinking about that tenth android.\"  \"Do you think there's as much danger in this thing as Taber says?\"  King shrugged. \"Those guys always think that way. Remember what they said about the atom bomb? The world was doomed. We were going to blow each other up. But nobody's been heaving them around. The view-with-alarm boys always talk that way.\"  \"I hope you're right.\"  \"But about that android that's supposed to be walking around loose.\"  \"What about him?\"  \"Those bastards confiscated all my stuff. The shots I made in your room--everything. But if I could get some shots of the other one--\"  \"You're actually going to work on your own? In spite of what Taber said?\"  \"It's a free country,\" King retorted hotly. \"I've got a right to follow my profession. What I was going to say was that you're in a position to help yourself a little, too.\"  \"I am?\"  \"Only you and I know what we're looking for. If you spot the android, see him hanging around anywhere, and let me know, I'll--\"  \"You can go to hell, King. I want no part of any more of your ideas. I've had it. If I see the creature I'll call Taber and nobody else. I'm going to do exactly what he told me to do. Mark me off your list.\"  Frank Corson strode away. Les King stood watching him. King shrugged. Just another bewildered citizen who thought God lived in Washington. Afraid to spit if some Washington bureaucrat wagged a finger.  Well, the hell with Corson. The hell with Taber. The hell with all of them. If Les King stood to make an honest buck, he was going to do his damnedest until somebody passed a law making it illegal.     6   Brent Taber was drawn to Doctor Entman. He found, in the ugly little scientist, a rapport that seemed to exist nowhere else. At the moment, Entman was having a fine, stimulating time dissecting the cadaver of the android. His ugly little eyes were bright. \"It's a miracle, my friend! A positive miracle. The thing these people have been able to do!\"  \"People? You've used that word before.\"  Entman waved an impatient hand. \"Oh, don't quibble! Why, the creation of an artificial digestive system alone is awesome--not to mention the creation of a synthetic brain.\"  \"The brain is what interests me.\"  \"I can hardly wait to get into that area. Certain aspects are obvious, though. These creatures must have mental powers far beyond ours--in certain areas, that is.\"  \"Tell me more.\"  \"That's merely a matter of logic. We know that _homo sapiens_--because of his free choice, so to speak--uses, on an average, not more than a tenth of his mental ability. All right. These people have created, to all intents and purposes, a man. They surely had sense enough to remove the free-choice element. The creature surely has judgment, even cunning, but it is no doubt pointed totally and completely toward the objective of its being.\"  \"Whatever the hell that objective is!\"  Entman was mildly surprised by Taber's exclamation. He held up a warning finger. \"Nerves, boy, nerves. You must watch that. As to the objective--I'm sure it's something pointed at our destruction.\"  \"What powers were you referring to?\"  \"Hypnotism, I should think. Any of the mental processes through which one human being strives to assert control over another. We are aware of several of these. They may have found others.\"  \"You won't be able to define them by cutting up that brain?\"  \"I doubt it. We could know them only by watching one of the creatures in action.\" Entman sighed. \"If we only had other facts.\"  \"What facts?\"  Entman's smile was almost patronizing. \"You're tired, aren't you, son? You're not thinking very well.\"  \"Goddamn it! Quit treating me like a cretin!\"  \"Temper, temper! Look at it analytically, son, analytically. Suppose we knew who these people are. What distances have they covered in arriving here? What is their method of conveyance?\"  \"The distance? Light years, I would assume. The conveyance? A spaceship, or a projectile along basic lines but farther advanced.\"  \"All right. We know they've sent ten creatures to our planet from infinity--that's as good a word to use as any. The next question is, why?\"  \"Damnit, that question is obvious.\"  \"And from my point of view, the answer is obvious.\"  \"Then I wish to hell you'd give it to me.\"  \"Logic, man, logic! A race as far advanced as this one could certainly move in and occupy us without trouble. Wouldn't you think?\"  \"Certainly. That's what bothers me. Why all the pussy-footing around with synthetic men who keep dropping dead?\"  \"I think it's because they themselves are unable to exist in the climatic and atmospheric conditions existent on our planet.\"  Brent Taber's eyes opened as Entman went on. \"They plan to occupy us, certainly--this we must assume--so they're trying to create an entity through which they can do it. The process is really no different, even though a little more dramatic, than our science creating a mechanical unit that functions to the best efficiency under specified conditions.\"  Taber's finger snapped up. He pointed at Entman's desk. \"They'd like to know why their androids died. Maybe they weren't alike--at least, not exactly alike. Maybe there were differences you haven't found yet--maybe they turned out ten models and they want to know which one worked the best.\"  \"You get the point,\" Entman beamed.  \"They'd like the data you're assembling--those reports you've got in front of you.\"  \"I imagine they'd find them quite interesting.\"  \"Do you think we can assume the tenth android died also?\"  \"Perhaps. We have no proof that it killed the one found slain in Greenwich Village.\"  \"I'm satisfied to assume that.

Smith, Ph.D._  _Author of \"Skylark of Space\" and \"Skylark Three\"_     Spacehounds of IPC       _A good many of us, who are now certain beyond a doubt that space     travel will forever remain in the realm of the impossible, probably     would, if a rocket that were shot to the moon, for instance, did     arrive, and perhaps return to give proof of its safe arrival on our     satellite, accept the phenomenon in a perfectly blasé, twentieth     century manner. Dr. Smith, that phenomenal writer of classic     scientific fiction, seems to have become so thoroughly convinced of     the advent of interplanetary travel that it is difficult for the     reader to feel, after finishing \"Spacehounds of IPC,\" that travel     in the great spaces is not already an established fact. Dr. Smith,     as a professional chemist, is kept fairly busy. As a writer, he is     satisfied with nothing less than perfection. For that reason, a     masterpiece from his pen has become almost an annual event. We know     you will like \"Spacehounds\" even better than the \"Skylark\" series._   Illustrated by WESSO     CHAPTER I  The IPV _Arcturus_ Sets Out for Mars   A narrow football of steel, the Interplanetary Vessel _Arcturus_ stood upright in her berth in the dock like an egg in its cup. A hundred feet across and a hundred and seventy feet deep was that gigantic bowl, its walls supported by the structural steel and concrete of the dock and lined with hard-packed bumper-layers of hemp and fibre. High into the air extended the upper half of the ship of space--a sullen gray expanse of fifty-inch hardened steel armor, curving smoothly upward to a needle prow. Countless hundred of fine vertical scratches marred every inch of her surface, and here and there the stubborn metal was grooved and scored to a depth of inches--each scratch and score the record of an attempt of some wandering cosmic body to argue the right-of-way with the stupendous mass of that man-made cruiser of the void.  A burly young man made his way through the throng about the entrance, nodded unconcernedly to the gatekeeper, and joined the stream of passengers flowing through the triple doors of the double air-lock and down a corridor to the center of the vessel. However, instead of entering one of the elevators which were whisking the passengers up to their staterooms in the upper half of the enormous football, he in some way caused an opening to appear in an apparently blank steel wall and stepped through it into the control room.  \"Hi, Breck!\" the burly one called, as he strode up to the instrument-desk of the chief pilot and tossed his bag carelessly into a corner. \"Behold your computer in the flesh! What's all this howl and fuss about poor computation?\"  \"Hello, Steve!\" The chief pilot smiled as he shook hands cordially. \"Glad to see you again--but don't try to kid the old man. I'm simple enough to believe almost anything, but some things just aren't being done. We have been yelling, and yelling hard, for trained computers ever since they started riding us about every one centimeter change in acceleration, but I know that you're no more an I-P computer than I am a Digger Indian. They don't shoot sparrows with coast-defense guns!\"  [Illustration]  \"Thanks for the compliment, Breck, but I'm your computer for this trip, anyway. Newton, the good old egg, knows what you fellows are up against and is going to do something about it, if he has to lick all the rest of the directors to do it. He knew that I was loose for a couple of weeks and asked me to come along this trip to see what I could see. I'm to check the observatory data--they don't know I'm aboard--take the peaks and valleys off your acceleration curve, if possible, and report to Newton just what I find out and what I think should be done about it. How early am I?\" While the newcomer was talking, he had stripped the covers from a precise scale model of the solar system and from a large and complicated calculating machine and had set to work without a wasted motion or instant--scaling off upon the model the positions of the various check-stations and setting up long and involved integrals and equations upon the calculator.  The older man studied the broad back of the younger, bent over his computations, and a tender, almost fatherly smile came over his careworn face as he replied:  \"Early? You? Just like you always were--plus fifteen seconds on the deadline. The final dope is due right now.\" He plugged the automatic recorder and speaker into a circuit marked \"Observatory,\" waited until a tiny light above the plug flashed green, and spoke.  \"IPV _Arcturus_; Breckenridge, Chief Pilot; trip number forty-three twenty-nine. Ready for final supplementary route and flight data, Tellus to Mars.\"  \"Meteoric swarms still too numerous for safe travel along the scheduled route,\" came promptly from the speaker. \"You must stay further away from the plane of the ecliptic. The ether will be clear for you along route E2-P6-W41-K3-R19-S7-M14. You will hold a constant acceleration of 981.27 centimeters between initial and final check stations. Your take-off will be practically unobstructed, but you will have to use the utmost caution in landing upon Mars, because in order to avoid a weightless detour and a loss of thirty-one minutes, you must pass very close to both the Martian satellites. To do so safely you must pass the last meteorological station, M14, on schedule time plus or minus five seconds, at scheduled velocity plus or minus ten meters, with exactly the given negative acceleration of 981.27 centimeters, and exactly upon the pilot ray M14 will have set for you.\"  \"All x.\" Breckenridge studied his triplex chronometer intently, then unplugged and glanced around the control room, in various parts of which half a dozen assistants were loafing at their stations.  \"Control and power check-out--Hipe!\" he barked. \"Driving converters and projectors!\"  The first assistant scanned his meters narrowly as he swung a multi-point switch in a flashing arc. \"Converter efficiency 100, projector reactivity 100; on each of numbers one to forty-five inclusive. All x.\"  \"Dirigible projectors!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Two more gleaming switches leaped from point to point. \"Converter efficiency 100, projector reactivity 100, dirigibility 100, on each of numbers one to thirty-two, inclusive, of upper band; and numbers one to thirty-two, inclusive, of lower band. All x.\"  \"Gyroscopes!\"  \"35,000. Drivers in equilibrium at ten degrees plus. All x.\"  \"Upper lights and lookout plates!\"  The second assistant was galvanized into activity, and upon a screen before him there appeared a view as though he were looking directly upward from the prow of the great vessel. The air above them was full of aircraft of all shapes and sizes, and occasionally the image of one of that flying horde flared into violet splendor upon the screen as it was caught in the mighty, roving beam of one of the twelve ultra-light projectors under test.  \"Upper lights and lookout plates--all x,\" the second assistant reported, and other assistants came to attention as the check-out went on.  \"Lower lights and lookout plates!\"  \"All x,\" was the report, after each of the twelve ultra-lights of the stern had swung around in its supporting brackets, illuminating every recess of the dark depths of the bottom well of the berth and throwing the picture upon another screen in lurid violet relief.  \"Lateral and vertical detectors!\"  \"Laterals XP2710--all x. Verticals AJ4290--all x.\"  \"Receptors!\"  \"15,270 kilofranks--all x.\"  \"Accumulators!\"  \"700,000 kilofrank-hours--all x.\"  Having thus checked and tested every function of his department, Breckenridge plugged into \"Captain,\" and when the green light went on:  \"Chief pilot check-out--all x,\" he reported briefly.  \"All x,\" acknowledged the speaker, and the chief pilot unplugged. Fifteen minutes remained, during which time one department head after another would report to the captain of the liner that everything in his charge was ready for the stupendous flight.  \"All x, Steve?\" Breckenridge turned to the computer. \"How do you check acceleration and power with the observatory?\"  \"Not so good, old bean,\" the younger man frowned in thought. \"They figure like astronomers, not navigators. They've made no allowances for anything, not even the reversal--and I figure four thousands for that and for minor detours. Then there's check station errors....\"  \"Check-station errors! Why, they're always right--that's what they're for!\"  \"Don't fool yourself--they've got troubles of their own, the same as anybody else. In fact, from a study of the charts of the last few weeks, I'm pretty sure that E2 is at least four thousand kilometers this side of where he thinks he is, that W41 is ten or twelve thousand beyond his station, and that they've both got a lateral displacement that's simply fierce. I'm going to check up, and argue with them about it as we pass. Then there's another thing--they figure to only two places, and we've got to have the third place almost solid if we expect to get a smooth curve. A hundredth of a centimeter of acceleration means a lot on a long trip when they're holding us as close as they are doing now. We'll ride this trip on 981.286 centimeters--with our scheduled mass, that means thirty six points of four seven kilofranks _plus_ equilibrium power. All set to go,\" the computer stated, as he changed, by fractions of arc, the course-plotters of the automatic integrating goniometer.  \"You're the doctor--but I'm glad it's you that'll have to explain to the observatory,\" and Breckenridge set his exceedingly delicate excess power potentiometer exactly upon the indicated figure. \"Well, we've got a few minutes left for a chin-chin before we lift her off.\"  \"What's all this commotion about? Dish out the low-down.\"  \"Well, it's like this, Steve. We"]]]
