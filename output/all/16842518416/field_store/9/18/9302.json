Regulus lies about 9° east of Acubens, in Cancer, and about 12° northeast of Alphard, in the heart of Hydra.  Leo is one of the most beautiful constellations in the zodiac. It lies south of the Great Bear, and its principal stars are arranged in the form of a sickle which nearly outlines the Lion's head. This group is so striking as to be unmistakable. Regulus is in the handle of the sickle. It is one of the stars from which longitude is reckoned, lies almost exactly on the ecliptic, and is visible for eight months in the year.  Denebola, the bright star in the Lion's tail, lies 25° east of Regulus, and about 35° west of Arcturus, in Boötes. It is the same distance northwest of Spica, in Virgo, and forms with Spica and Arcturus a large equilateral triangle.  ζ is double, and has three faint companion stars.  ε has two seventh-magnitude companion stars, forming a beautiful little triangle.  Regulus is white in color, γ yellow, π red.  γ is a beautiful colored telescopic double star and has a companion visible in an opera-glass.  The figure of Leo very much as we now have it appears in all the Indian and Egyptian zodiacs.  [Illustration: LEO  THE SICKLE]     COMA BERENICES (kō´-ma ber-e-ni´-sez)--BERENICE'S HAIR.   LOCATION.--A line drawn from Regulus to Zosma, in Leo, and prolonged an equal distance, strikes this fine cluster, which is 18° northeast of Zosma, δ Leonis.  The group lies well within a triangle formed by Denebola, Arcturus, in Boötes, and Cor Caroli, in Canes Venatici, which triangle is the upper half of the Diamond of Virgo.  Twenty or thirty stars in this group can be counted with an opera-glass, and the group can be easily distinguished with the naked eye, when the moon is not visible.  The first half of the month of April can be called the most brilliant sidereal period of the year. At this time eleven first-magnitude stars are visible in this latitude at 9 P.M. From east to west they are: Vega, Arcturus, Spica, Regulus, Pollux, Procyon, Sirius, Capella, Aldebaran, Betelgeuze, and Rigel, truly a glorious company, an incomparable sight.  [Illustration: COMA BERENICES]     CANIS MINOR (kā´-nis mi´-nor)--THE LESSER DOG. (Face West.)   LOCATION.--Procyon, the Little Dog Star, lies about 23° south of Pollux, in Gemini. A line drawn from Nath, in Auriga, to Alhena, in Gemini, and prolonged about 18°, reaches Procyon.  Procyon is equidistant from Betelgeuze in Orion, and Sirius in Canis Major, and forms with them an equilateral triangle. It forms a large right-angled triangle with Pollux and Betelgeuze.  The light from Procyon is golden yellow. Four degrees northwest of it is the third-magnitude star Gomeisa. The glass shows two small stars forming a right-angled triangle with it.  Procyon was distinctly mentioned by Ptolemy. It rises in this latitude a little north of east about half an hour before Sirius, the Dog Star, hence it was called Procyon from two Greek words which signify \"before the dog.\"  Procyon is one of our nearest neighbors in space, at a distance of ten light years, and is attended by a very faint companion which is only visible in the largest telescopes.  [Illustration: CANIS MINOR]     CORVUS (kôr´-vus)--THE CROW. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from the Bee Hive, in Cancer, through Regulus, in Leo, and prolonged about 40°, ends near the conspicuous quadrilateral which distinguishes Corvus. The brightest star in this region of the sky is Spica, in Virgo. It lies about 10° northeast of Algorab.  ζ is a double star for an opera-glass. A faint pair of stars lie close below and to the west of β. The Crow is represented as standing on, and pecking at, the coils of Hydra. The star Al Chiba is in the Crow's bill.  Corvus was known as the Raven in Chaucer's time.  δ is an interesting telescopic double.  A line drawn from γ to β Corvi and prolonged twice its length locates the third-magnitude star ι Centauri in the right shoulder of the Centaur. The brightest stars in this constellation are not visible in this latitude.  [Illustration: CORVUS]     CRATER (krā´-ter)--THE CUP. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--Crater is situated 15° west of Corvus, and due south of θ Leonis. It is easily distinguished by reason of a beautiful and very striking semicircle of six stars of the fourth magnitude, forming the bowl of the cup.  The constellation resembles a goblet with its base resting on the coils of Hydra.  The star Alkes is common to Hydra and Crater, and may be seen 24° southeast of Alphard in the heart of Hydra. It is distinguished by its forming an equilateral triangle with α and γ, stars of the same magnitude 6° south and east of it.  Corvus and Crater are to be seen half-way up the southern sky during the early evenings in spring.  δ is now the lucida.  Crater is situated at about the centre of Hydra and is on the meridian, April 26th. Owing to its many faint stars it is best seen on a clear moonless night.  The zodiacal light is well worth observing at this season of the year. It is to be seen in the western sky shortly after sundown, and is most intense during the evenings of March.

[Illustration: Maps showing the principal stars visible from Lat. 40° N. at 9 o'clock, July first.]     DRACO (drā´-ko)--THE DRAGON. (Face North.)   LOCATION.--About 10° from α Ursæ Majoris--from α to δ is 10°--slightly south of, that is above, the line from α to Polaris, is Giansar, λ in the tip of the Dragon's tail. Above λ, and almost in line with it, are two more stars in Draco, which form with two stars in Ursa Major a quadrilateral. (See diagram.) Draco now curves sharply eastward, coiling about the Little Bear as shown, then turns abruptly southerly, ending in a characteristic and clearly defined group of four stars, forming an irregular square, representing the Dragon's head. This group is almost overhead in the early evening in summer. The star in the heel of Hercules lies just south of the Dragon's head. The brilliant Vega will be seen about overhead, 12° southwest of the Dragon's head. Eltanin, one of the Dragon's eyes, is noted for its connection with the discovery of the law of aberration of light. It is of an orange hue, while the star β, near it, is white. Note Thuban, once the Pole Star, at one corner of a quadrilateral that Draco forms with Ursa Major.  Thuban could be seen by day or night from the bottom of the central passage of several of the Pyramids in Egypt.  The rising of Eltanin was visible about thirty-five hundred years B.C. through the central passages of the temples of Hathor at Denderah. The Egyptians called Draco \"The Hippopotamus.\"  Vega and the four stars in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20769"],["title","A Field Book of the Stars (#3)"],["body","'s head offer an opportunity to compare the first five stellar magnitudes with which all should be familiar.  [Illustration: DRACO]     LYRA (lī´-ra)--THE LYRE.   LOCATION.--Lyra may be easily distinguished because of the brilliant Vega, its brightest star, which is situated about 12° southwest of the Dragon's head. It is unmistakable, as it is the brightest star in this region of the heavens, and the third brightest in this latitude. In July and August Vega is close to the zenith in the early evening.  The six bright stars in Lyra form an equilateral triangle on one corner of a rhomboid. A very characteristic figure.  ε is a pretty double for an opera-glass, and a 3\" glass reveals the duplicity of each star of this pair. ε is therefore a double double.  ζ is a double for a good glass.  β is a variable, changing from magnitude 3.4 to 4.4 in twelve days. At its brightest it is about equal to its near neighbor γ Lyræ.  The noted ring nebula lies between β and γ. A 3\" glass reveals it but a powerful telescope is required to render its details visible.  If the distance from the earth to the sun equalled one inch, the distance from the earth to Vega would be 158 miles.  Vega was the first star to be photographed, in 1850. It is visible at some hour every clear night, and has been called the arc-light of the sky. Its light has the bluish-white hue that suggests \"a diamond in the sky.\"  The spectroscope reveals that Vega is a star probably only in its infancy, as hydrogen is its predominating element.  [Illustration: LYRA]     CYGNUS (sig´-nus)--THE SWAN, OR THE NORTHERN CROSS.   LOCATION.--Deneb, the brightest star in Cygnus, is at the top of the cross, and a little over 20° east of Vega. It forms a triangle with Vega and Altair in Aquila--Altair being at the apex, about 35° from Deneb and Vega.  β Cygni is at the base of the cross, and a line drawn from Vega to Altair nearly touches it. It is a beautiful colored double for a small telescope.  Note \"61,\" one of the nearest stars to us. It was the first star whose distance was measured (by Bessel in 1838). It is a double star and 10.4 light years distant.  The cross is nearly perfect and easily traced out. It lies almost wholly in the Milky Way.  Note \"The Coal Sack,\" one of the dark gap in the Milky Way.  Cygnus contains an unusual number of deeply colored stars and variable stars.  ο Cygni has a sixth-magnitude companion, and γ is in the midst of a beautiful stream of faint stars.  This region is perhaps richer than any similar extent in the heavens. An opera-glass will reveal many of its beauties.  Herschel counted 331,000 stars in an area of only 5° in Cygnus.  [Illustration: CYGNUS]     AQUILA (ak´-wi-lä)--THE EAGLE, AND ANTINOÜS. (Face Southeast.)   LOCATION.--Half-way up the sky in the Milky Way, you will see three stars in a line, the middle one much brighter than the other two. This bright star is Altair, in Aquila. It forms with Vega and Deneb an isosceles triangle. Altair is at the apex, about 35° from the other two. A triangle is formed by Vega, Altair, and Ras Alhague, in the Serpent Bearer, which is about 30° west of Altair.  This is a double constellation composed of Aquila and Antinoüs. Altair is in the neck of the Eagle, Alschain in the head of Antinoüs.  When the moon is absent, a rude arrowhead can be traced out, embracing almost all the stars in Aquila.  η is an interesting variable star, changing from magnitude 3.5 to 4.7 and back again within a period of 7 days 4 hours 12 minutes.  Altair rises about 8° north of the exact eastern point on the horizon.  In A.D. 389 a wonderful temporary star flashed out near Altair that equalled Venus in brightness and vanished within three weeks' time.  [Illustration: AQUILA  ANTINOÜS]     DELPHINUS (del-fi´-nus)--THE DOLPHIN, OR JOB'S COFFIN. (Face Southeast.)   LOCATION.--The little cluster of five stars forming Delphinus is to be seen about 10° northeast of Altair, and, though there are no bright stars in the group, it can hardly escape notice. A line drawn from Vega to Albireo, and prolonged about 20°, strikes the star ε in the tail of the Dolphin. The four other stars of prominence in the constellation are a little above ε, and form a diamond-shaped figure.  The little asterisms Sagitta, the Arrow, and Vulpecula and Anser, the Fox and Goose, are shown just above Delphinus.  Delphinus is also called Job's Coffin. The origin of this appellation is unknown.  In Greece, Delphinus was the Sacred Fish, the sky emblem of philanthropy. The Arabs called it the \"Riding Camel.\"  The star γ Delphini is a fine double for a small telescope with a marked and beautiful contrast of colors.  The names for α and β reversed spell \"Nicolaus Venator,\" the Latinized name of the assistant to the astronomer Piazzi.  [Illustration: DELPHINUS]     SAGITTARIUS (saj-i-tā-ri-us)--THE ARCHER. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from Deneb, in Cygnus, to Altair, in Aquila, and prolonged an equal distance, terminates in Sagittarius about 10° east of its distinguishing characteristic, the Milk Dipper. Sagittarius is one of the signs of the zodiac, and lies between Capricornus, on the east, and Scorpius, on the west.  The bow is easily traced out. γ marks the arrow's tip.  Note the star μ, which serves to point out the Winter Solstice, where the solstitial colure intersects the ecliptic.  On a clear night, the pretty cluster known as Corona Australis, the Southern Crown, can be seen about 10° below the bowl of the Milk Dipper. Its lucida, the fourth-magnitude star Alfecca Meridiana culminates at 9 P.M., August 13th.  Sagittarius is about due south, in a splendid position for observation, during the month of July, between the hours of nine-thirty and eleven o'clock P.M.  Observe with an opera-glass the fine clusters 20 M. and 8 M., also an almost circular black void near the stars γ and δ, and to the east of this spot another of narrow crescent form.  The stars φ and ζ in the Milk Dipper are moving in opposite directions. Future generations therefore will not have this time-honored figure to guide them in locating the Archer in their summer night skies.  [Illustration: SAGITTARIUS]     OPHIUCHUS (of-i-ū-kus)--THE SERPENT BEARER, AND SERPENS. (Face Southwest.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from ε Delphini to γ Aquilæ, prolonged about 30°, strikes the star Ras Alhague, the brightest star in the constellation and the head of Ophiuchus. It is at one angle of an isosceles triangle, of which Altair is at the apex, and Vega the third angle.  Two constellations are here combined. Ophiuchus is represented as an old man, holding in his hands a writhing serpent.  Ras Algethi, marking the head of Hercules, lies just west of Ras Alhague.  Equally distant southeast and southwest of Ras Alhague are to be seen two stars close together, representing the shoulders of Ophiuchus. His foot rests on the Scorpion just above Antares.  The head of Serpens is the star group in the form of an \"X\" just below the Crown.  1604 indicates the spot where in that year a famous temporary star appeared, called Kepler's star.  Note the asterism the \"Bull of Poniatowski\" just east of γ. The star marked 70 is one of the most distant stars for which a parallax has been obtained. Its distance from the earth = 1,300,000 radii of the earth's orbit, or 120 quadrillion miles.  There is something remarkable in the central position of this gigantic figure. It is situated almost exactly in the mid-heavens, being nearly equidistant from the poles, and midway between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.  [Illustration: OPHIUCHUS  SERPENS]     SCORPIUS (skôr´-pi-us)--THE SCORPION. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--Scorpius, one of the signs of the zodiac, is a beautiful star group, and one that is easily traced out. It lies just under the Serpent Bearer, between Sagittarius and Libra.  The resemblance to a Scorpion is not difficult to see, hence this constellation is perhaps the most aptly named of any.  The ruddy star Antares, the brightest star in the constellation, is in the heart of the Scorpion. It lies about 40° southwest of Ras Alhague, in Ophiuchus, and a little over 20° west of the bow of Sagittarius. The fact that it is the most brilliant star in this region of the sky renders its identity unmistakable. It is one of the reddest stars in the firmament.  There are several star clusters and double stars to be seen in this constellation. Their position is indicated in the diagram.  The curved tail of the Scorpion is very conspicuous. λ and υ are a striking pair and the fine clusters above them can be seen with the naked eye.  A record of a lunar occultation of β Scorpii in 295 B.C. is extant.  Note a pair just below β. They are known as ω¹ and ω².  In this region of the sky have appeared many of the brilliant temporary stars, the first one in astronomical annals being discovered in 134 B.C.  Scorpius is mentioned by all the early writers on astronomy and is supposed to be so named because in Egypt it was a sickly time of the year when the sun entered this sign.  [Illustration: SCORPIUS]     LIBRA (lī´-bra)--THE SCALES. (Face Southwest.)   LOCATION.--Libra is one of the signs of the zodiac, and lies between Virgo and Scorpius. Its two chief stars, α and β, may be recognized west of and above the head of the Scorpion.  The star ι Libræ is about 20° northwest of Antares in the Scorpion. Spica in Virgo, a star of the first magnitude, is a little over 20° northwest of α Libræ.  A quadrilateral is formed by the stars α, β, γ, ε, which characterizes the constellation.  The star α Libræ looks elongated. An opera-glass shows that it has a fifth-magnitude companion.  β is a pale green star. Its color is very unusual.  Lyra, Corona, and Hercules are almost directly overhead in the early evening, during July and August, and can best be observed in a reclining position. Thus placed, with an opera-glass to assist the vision, you may study to the best advantage the wonderful sight spread out before you, and"]]]
