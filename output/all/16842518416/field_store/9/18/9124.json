VENTIDIUS.  You conquered for him:   Philippi knows it; there you shared with him   That empire, which your sword made all your own.    ANTONY.  Fool that I was, upon my eagle's wings   I bore this wren, till I was tired with soaring,   And now he mounts above me.   Good heavens, is this,--is this the man who braves me?   Who bids my age make way?  Drives me before him,   To the world's ridge, and sweeps me off like rubbish?    VENTIDIUS.  Sir, we lose time; the troops are mounted all.    ANTONY.  Then give the word to march:   I long to leave this prison of a town,   To join thy legions; and, in open field,   Once more to show my face.  Lead, my deliverer.         Enter ALEXAS    ALEXAS.  Great emperor,   In mighty arms renowned above mankind,   But, in soft pity to the opprest, a god;   This message sends the mournful Cleopatra   To her departing lord.    VENTIDIUS.  Smooth sycophant!    ALEXAS.  A thousand wishes, and ten thousand prayers,   Millions of blessings wait you to the wars;   Millions of sighs and tears she sends you too,   And would have sent   As many dear embraces to your arms,   As many parting kisses to your lips;   But those, she fears, have wearied you already.    VENTIDIUS.  [aside.]  False crocodile!    ALEXAS.  And yet she begs not now, you would not leave her;   That were a wish too mighty for her hopes,   Too presuming   For her low fortune, and your ebbing love;   That were a wish for her more prosperous days,   Her blooming beauty, and your growing kindness.    ANTONY.  [aside.]  Well, I must man it out:--What would the queen?    ALEXAS.  First, to these noble warriors, who attend   Your daring courage in the chase of fame,--   Too daring, and too dangerous for her quiet,--   She humbly recommends all she holds dear,   All her own cares and fears,--the care of you.    VENTIDIUS.  Yes, witness Actium.    ANTONY.  Let him speak, Ventidius.    ALEXAS.  You, when his matchless valour bears him forward,   With ardour too heroic, on his foes,   Fall down, as she would do, before his feet;   Lie in his way, and stop the paths of death:   Tell him, this god is not invulnerable;   That absent Cleopatra bleeds in him;   And, that you may remember her petition,   She begs you wear these trifles, as a pawn,   Which, at your wished return, she will redeem        [Gives jewels to the Commanders.]   With all the wealth of Egypt:   This to the great Ventidius she presents,   Whom she can never count her enemy,   Because he loves her lord.    VENTIDIUS.  Tell her, I'll none on't;   I'm not ashamed of honest poverty;   Not all the diamonds of the east can bribe   Ventidius from his faith.  I hope to see   These and the rest of all her sparkling store,   Where they shall more deservingly be placed.    ANTONY.  And who must wear them then?    VENTIDIUS.  The wronged Octavia.    ANTONY.  You might have spared that word.    VENTIDIUS.  And he that bribe.    ANTONY.  But have I no remembrance?    ALEXAS.  Yes, a dear one;   Your slave the queen--    ANTONY.  My mistress.    ALEXAS.  Then your mistress;   Your mistress would, she says, have sent her soul,   But that you had long since; she humbly begs   This ruby bracelet, set with bleeding hearts,   The emblems of her own, may bind your arm.        [Presenting a bracelet.]    VENTIDIUS.  Now, my best lord,--in honour's name, I ask you,   For manhood's sake, and for your own dear safety,--   Touch not these poisoned gifts,   Infected by the sender; touch them not;   Myriads of bluest plagues lie underneath them,   And more than aconite has dipt the silk.    ANTONY.  Nay, now you grow too cynical, Ventidius:   A lady's favours may be worn with honour.   What, to refuse her bracelet!  On my soul,   When I lie pensive in my tent alone,   'Twill pass the wakeful hours of winter nights,   To tell these pretty beads upon my arm,   To count for every one a soft embrace,   A melting kiss at such and such a time:   And now and then the fury of her love,   When----And what harm's in this?    ALEXAS.  None, none, my lord,   But what's to her, that now 'tis past for ever.    ANTONY.  [going to tie it.]   We soldiers are so awkward--help me tie it.    ALEXAS.  In faith, my lord, we courtiers too are awkward   In these affairs:  so are all men indeed:   Even I, who am not one.  But shall I speak?    ANTONY.  Yes, freely.    ALEXAS.  Then, my lord, fair hands alone   Are fit to tie it; she, who sent it can.    VENTIDIUS.  Hell, death! this eunuch pander ruins you.   You will not see her?         [ALEXAS whispers an ATTENDANT, who goes out.]    ANTONY.  But to take my leave.    VENTIDIUS.  Then I have washed an Aethiop.  You're undone;   Y' are in the toils; y' are taken; y' are destroyed:   Her eyes do Caesar's work.    ANTONY.  You fear too soon.   I'm constant to myself:  I know my strength;   And yet she shall not think me barbarous neither,   Born in the depths of Afric:  I am a Roman,   Bred in the rules of soft humanity.   A guest, and kindly used, should bid farewell.    VENTIDIUS.  You do not know   How weak you are to her, how much an infant:   You are not proof against a smile, or glance:   A sigh will quite disarm you.    ANTONY.  See, she comes!   Now you shall find your error.--Gods, I thank you:   I formed the danger greater than it was,   And now 'tis near, 'tis lessened.    VENTIDIUS.  Mark the end yet.         Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMION, and IRAS    ANTONY.  Well, madam, we are met.    CLEOPATRA.  Is this a meeting?   Then, we must part?    ANTONY.  We must.    CLEOPATRA.  Who says we must?    ANTONY.  Our own hard fates.    CLEOPATRA.  We make those fates ourselves.    ANTONY.  Yes, we have made them; we have loved each other,   Into our mutual ruin.    CLEOPATRA.  The gods have seen my joys with envious eyes;   I have no friends in heaven; and all the world,   As 'twere the business of mankind to part us,   Is armed against my love:  even you yourself   Join with the rest; you, you are armed against me.    ANTONY.  I will be justified in all I do   To late posterity, and therefore hear me.   If I mix a lie   With any truth, reproach me freely with it;   Else, favour me with silence.    CLEOPATRA.  You command me,   And I am dumb.    VENTIDIUS.  I like this well; he shows authority.    ANTONY.  That I derive my ruin   From you alone----    CLEOPATRA.  O heavens!  I ruin you!    ANTONY.  You promised me your silence, and you break it   Ere I have scarce begun.    CLEOPATRA.  Well, I obey you.    ANTONY.  When I beheld you first, it was in Egypt.   Ere Caesar saw your eyes, you gave me love,   And were too young to know it; that I settled   Your father in his throne, was for your sake;   I left the acknowledgment for time to ripen.   Caesar stept in, and, with a greedy hand,   Plucked the green fruit, ere the first blush of red,   Yet cleaving to the bough.  He was my lord,   And was, beside, too great for me to rival;   But, I deserved you first, though he enjoyed you.   When, after, I beheld you in Cilicia,   An enemy to Rome, I pardoned you.    CLEOPATRA.  I cleared myself----    ANTONY.  Again you break your promise.   I loved you still, and took your weak excuses,   Took you into my bosom, stained by Caesar,   And not half mine:  I went to Egypt with you,   And hid me from the business of the world,   Shut out inquiring nations from my sight,   To give whole years to you.    VENTIDIUS.  Yes, to your shame be't spoken.        [Aside.]    ANTONY.  How I loved.   Witness, ye days and nights, and all ye hours,   That danced away with down upon your feet,   As all your business were to count my passion!   One day passed by, and nothing saw but love;   Another came, and still 'twas only love:   The suns were wearied out with looking on,   And I untired with loving.   I saw you every day, and all the day;   And every day was still but as the first,   So eager was I still to see you more.    VENTIDIUS.  'Tis all too true.    ANTONY.  Fulvia, my wife, grew jealous,   (As she indeed had reason) raised a war   In Italy, to call me back.    VENTIDIUS.  But yet   You went not.    ANTONY.  While within your arms I lay,   The world fell mouldering from my hands each hour,   And left me scarce a grasp--I thank your love for't.    VENTIDIUS.  Well pushed:  that last was home.    CLEOPATRA.  Yet may I speak?    ANTONY.  If I have urged a falsehood, yes; else, not.   Your silence says, I have not.  Fulvia died,   (Pardon, you gods, with my unkindness died);   To set the world at peace, I took Octavia,   This Caesar's sister; in her pride of youth,   And flower of beauty, did I wed that lady,   Whom blushing I must praise, because I left her.   You called; my love obeyed the fatal summons:   This raised the Roman arms; the cause was yours.   I would have fought by land, where I was stronger;   You hindered it:  yet, when I fought at sea,   Forsook me fighting; and (O stain to honour!   O lasting shame!) I knew not that I fled;   But fled to follow you.    VENTIDIUS.  What haste she made to hoist her purple sails!   And, to appear magnificent in flight,   Drew half our strength away.    ANTONY.  All this you caused.   And, would you multiply more ruins on me?   This honest man, my best, my only friend,   Has gathered up the shipwreck of my fortunes;   Twelve legions I have left, my last recruits.   And you have watched the news, and bring your eyes   To seize them too.  If you have aught to answer,   Now speak, you have free leave.    ALEXAS.  [aside.]  She stands confounded:   Despair is in her eyes.    VENTIDIUS.  Now lay a sigh in the way to stop his passage:   Prepare a tear, and bid it for his legions;   'Tis like they shall be sold.    CLEOPATRA.  How shall I plead my cause, when you, my judge,   Already have condemned me?  Shall I bring   The love you bore me for my advocate?   That now is turned against me, that destroys me;   For love, once past, is, at the best,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2062"],["title","All for Love; Or, The World Well Lost: A Tragedy (#8)"],["body"," forgotten;   But oftener sours to hate:  'twill please my lord   To ruin me, and therefore I'll be guilty.   But, could I once have thought it would have pleased you,   That you would pry, with narrow searching eyes,   Into my faults, severe to my destruction,   And watching all advantages with care,   That serve to make me wretched?  Speak, my lord,   For I end here.  Though I deserved this usage,   Was it like you to give it?    ANTONY.  Oh, you wrong me,   To think I sought this parting, or desired   To accuse you more than what will clear myself,   And justify this breach.    CLEOPATRA.  Thus low I thank you;   And, since my innocence will not offend,   I shall not blush to own it.    VENTIDIUS.  After this,   I think she'll blush at nothing.    CLEOPATRA.  You seem grieved   (And therein you are kind) that Caesar first   Enjoyed my love, though you deserved it better:   I grieve for that, my lord, much more than you;   For, had I first been yours, it would have saved   My second choice:  I never had been his,   And ne'er had been but yours.  But Caesar first,   You say, possessed my love.  Not so, my lord:   He first possessed my person; you, my love:   Caesar loved me; but I loved Antony.   If I endured him after, 'twas because   I judged it due to the first name of men;   And, half constrained, I gave, as to a tyrant,   What he would take by force.    VENTIDIUS.  O Syren!  Syren!   Yet grant that all the love she boasts were true,   Has she not ruined you?  I still urge that,   The fatal consequence.    CLEOPATRA.  The consequence indeed--   For I dare challenge him, my greatest foe,   To say it was designed:  'tis true, I loved you,   And kept you far from an uneasy wife,--   Such Fulvia was.   Yes, but he'll say, you left Octavia for me;--   And, can you blame me to receive that love,   Which quitted such desert, for worthless me?   How often have I wished some other Caesar,   Great as the first, and as the second young,   Would court my love, to be refused for you!    VENTIDIUS.  Words, words; but Actium, sir; remember Actium.    CLEOPATRA.  Even there, I dare his malice.  True, I counselled   To fight at sea; but I betrayed you not.   I fled, but not to the enemy.  'Twas fear;   Would I had been a man, not to have feared!   For none would then have envied me your friendship,   Who envy me your love.    ANTONY.  We are both unhappy:   If nothing else, yet our ill fortune parts us.   Speak; would you have me perish by my stay?    CLEOPATRA.  If, as a friend, you ask my judgment, go;   If, as a lover, stay.  If you must perish--   'Tis a hard word--but stay.    VENTIDIUS.  See now the effects of her so boasted love!   She strives to drag you down to ruin with her;   But, could she 'scape without you, oh, how soon   Would she let go her hold, and haste to shore,   And never look behind!    CLEOPATRA.  Then judge my love by this.        [Giving ANTONY a writing.]   Could I have borne   A life or death, a happiness or woe,   From yours divided, this had given me means.    ANTONY.  By Hercules, the writing of Octavius!   I know it well:  'tis that proscribing hand,   Young as it was, that led the way to mine,   And left me but the second place in murder.--   See, see, Ventidius! here he offers Egypt,   And joins all Syria to it, as a present;   So, in requital, she forsake my fortunes,   And join her arms with his.    CLEOPATRA.  And yet you leave me!   You leave me, Antony; and yet I love you,   Indeed I do:  I have refused a kingdom;   That is a trifle;   For I could part with life, with anything,   But only you.  Oh, let me die but with you!   Is that a hard request?    ANTONY.  Next living with you,   'Tis all that Heaven can give.    ALEXAS.  He melts; we conquer.        [Aside.]    CLEOPATRA.  No; you shall go:  your interest calls you hence;   Yes; your dear interest pulls too strong, for these   Weak arms to hold you here.        [Takes his hand.]   Go; leave me, soldier   (For you're no more a lover):  leave me dying:   Push me, all pale and panting, from your bosom,   And, when your march begins, let one run after,   Breathless almost for joy, and cry--She's dead.   The soldiers shout; you then, perhaps, may sigh,   And muster all your Roman gravity:   Ventidius chides; and straight your brow clears up,   As I had never been.    ANTONY.  Gods, 'tis too much; too much for man to bear.    CLEOPATRA.  What is't for me then,   A weak, forsaken woman, and a lover?--   Here let me breathe my last:  envy me not   This minute in your arms:  I'll die apace,   As fast as e'er I can, and end your trouble.    ANTONY.  Die! rather let me perish; loosened nature   Leap from its hinges, sink the props of heaven,   And fall the skies, to crush the nether world!   My eyes, my soul, my all!        [Embraces her.]    VENTIDIUS.  And what's this toy,   In balance with your fortune, honour, fame?    ANTONY.  What is't, Ventidius?--it outweighs them all;   Why, we have more than conquered Caesar now:   My queen's not only innocent, but loves me.   This, this is she, who drags me down to ruin!   \"But, could she 'scape without me, with what haste   Would she let slip her hold, and make to shore,   And never look behind!\"   Down on thy knees, blasphemer as thou art,   And ask forgiveness of wronged innocence.    VENTIDIUS.  I'll rather die, than take it.  Will you go?    ANTONY.  Go! whither?  Go from all that's excellent?   Faith, honour, virtue, all good things forbid,   That I should go from her, who sets my love   Above the price of kingdoms!  Give, you gods,   Give to your boy, your Caesar,   This rattle of a globe to play withal,   This gewgaw world, and put him cheaply off:   I'll not be pleased with less than Cleopatra.    CLEOPATRA.  She's wholly yours.  My heart's so full of joy,   That I shall do some wild extravagance   Of love, in public; and the foolish world,   Which knows not tenderness, will think me mad.    VENTIDIUS.  O women! women! women! all the gods   Have not such power of doing good to man,   As you of doing harm.        [Exit.]    ANTONY.  Our men are armed:--   Unbar the gate that looks to Caesar's camp:   I would revenge the treachery he meant me;   And long security makes conquest easy.   I'm eager to return before I go;   For, all the pleasures I have known beat thick   On my remembrance.--How I long for night!   That both the sweets of mutual love may try,   And triumph once o'er Caesar ere we die.        [Exeunt.]           Act III         Scene I         At one door enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMION, IRAS, and ALEXAS,        a Train of EGYPTIANS:  at the other ANTONY and ROMANS.        The entrance on both sides is prepared by music; the        trumpets first sounding on Antony's part:  then answered        by timbrels, etc., on CLEOPATRA'S.  CHARMION and IRAS        hold a laurel wreath betwixt them.  A Dance of EGYPTIANS.        After the ceremony, CLEOPATRA crowns ANTONY.    ANTONY.  I thought how those white arms would fold me in,   And strain me close, and melt me into love;   So pleased with that sweet image, I sprung forwards,   And added all my strength to every blow.    CLEOPATRA.  Come to me, come, my soldier, to my arms!   You've been too long away from my embraces;   But, when I have you fast, and all my own,   With broken murmurs, and with amorous sighs,   I'll say, you were unkind, and punish you,   And mark you red with many an eager kiss.    ANTONY.  My brighter Venus!    CLEOPATRA.  O my greater Mars!    ANTONY.  Thou join'st us well, my love!   Suppose me come from the Phlegraean plains,   Where gasping giants lay, cleft by my sword,   And mountain-tops paired off each other blow,   To bury those I slew.  Receive me, goddess!   Let Caesar spread his subtle nets; like Vulcan,   In thy embraces I would be beheld   By heaven and earth at once;   And make their envy what they meant their sport   Let those, who took us, blush; I would love on,   With awful state, regardless of their frowns,   As their superior gods.   There's no satiety of love in thee:   Enjoyed, thou still art new; perpetual spring   Is in thy arms; the ripened fruit but falls,   And blossoms rise to fill its empty place;   And I grow rich by giving.         Enter VENTIDIUS, and stands apart    ALEXAS.  Oh, now the danger's past, your general comes!   He joins not in your joys, nor minds your triumphs;   But, with contracted brows, looks frowning on,   As envying your success.    ANTONY.  Now, on my soul, he loves me; truly loves me:   He never flattered me in any vice,   But awes me with his virtue:  even this minute,   Methinks, he has a right of chiding me.   Lead to the temple:  I'll avoid his presence;   It checks too strong upon me.        [Exeunt the rest.]        [As ANTONY is going, VENTIDIUS pulls him by the robe.]    VENTIDIUS.  Emperor!    ANTONY.  'Tis the old argument; I pr'ythee, spare me.        [Looking back.]    VENTIDIUS.  But this one hearing, emperor.    ANTONY.  Let go   My robe; or, by my father Hercules--    VENTIDIUS.  By Hercules' father, that's yet greater,   I bring you somewhat you would wish to know.    ANTONY.  Thou see'st we are observed; attend me here,   And I'll return.        [Exit.]    VENTIDIUS.  I am waning in his favour, yet I love him;   I love this man, who runs to meet his ruin;   And sure the gods, like me, are fond of him:   His virtues lie so mingled with his crimes,   As would confound their choice to punish one,   And not reward the other.         Enter ANTONY    ANTONY.  We can conquer,   You see, without your aid.   We have dislodged their troops;   They look on us at distance, and, like curs   Scaped from the lion's paws, they bay far off,   And lick their wounds, and faintly threaten war.   Five thousand Romans, with their faces upward,   Lie breathless on the plain.    VENTIDIUS.  'Tis well; and he,   Who lost them, could have spared ten thousand more.   Yet if, by this advantage, you could gain   An easier peace, while Caesar doubts the chance   Of arms--"]]]
