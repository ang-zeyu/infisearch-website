She says that if we wait until our wings are strong we will not be so apt to fall into danger.  \"So I remained inside the nest until I was quite a large, strong bird. Then my parents called me out and taught me to fly.  \"Only yesterday I asked my mother why I did not wear a dress and cap like her own.  \"She said, 'Wait a little longer, my child.  When you are quite grown your cap will be as red as my own.  You will look so much like your father and me that those children down there will be unable to tell us apart.'  \"It is little wonder that you did not know me for a woodpecker in this simple gray dress.  All woodpecker children, however, dress in this quiet fashion at first.  I shall be happy when I get my gorgeous red cap.\"  \"Well,\" said Phyllis, \"I am very glad you came to see me.  I knew there was a nest in the old oak-tree.  I watched your father and mother one whole morning a few weeks ago.  I think they chose the oak because of those old dead branches.  \"I saw your mother brace herself against the tree with her stiff tail. Then how her wedge-shaped bill rapped and rapped against the wood.  For fully twenty minutes she rapped away at the rotten wood.  Then she grew tired and your father took her place at the tree-trunk.  \"Soon they pecked a hole deep enough to hide them from sight, but their constant rap, rap, rap could still be heard.  \"I wondered how deep they made the hole, but it was too high for me to climb to find out.\"  \"Having just come from the nest I can tell you all about it,\" replied the young woodpecker.  \"My parents dug down into the soft trunk to a depth of perhaps eighteen inches.  At the bottom they hollowed out a large roomy place for the nest.  They did not line it with feathers or grasses.  Instead of a bed of moss was a little sawdust and the smooth white sides of the oak.  \"In this nest my mother laid six pure white eggs.  She sat on them and kept them warm until at last six downy birds came out of the shells.  \"We were hungry little things.  Both our mother and father were kept busy filling our greedy, ever-open mouths.  \"And whatever they brought was sure to be very nice.  Sometimes it was a cherry or a berry, sometimes a bit of pear or apple.  \"But, best of all, were the fat, juicy little grubs which they often brought.  \"I asked my father where he got the grubs.  He made fun of me and called out to my mother in his shrill, lively way.  \"She said that that was a thing which every young woodpecker should find out for himself.  \"After that, every time a fat grub was brought to me, I wondered if I should ever be able to find them when I began to shift for myself.  \"At last my wings were strong enough and my parents called me out of the nest.  I very soon found that the fat grubs lived beneath the bark of my own oak-tree.  All I had to do was to strike my bill into the bark and bear off the prize.\"  \"Were you sorry to leave your safe high nest?\" asked Phyllis.  \"Indeed it was not so safe,\" said the young woodpecker.  \"On the day that I left the nest a great black snake crept in.  He swallowed my little brothers and sisters.  \"My parents were wild with grief.  They said that was the thing they always dreaded, that such things often happened in woodpeckers' nests.\"  \"How sad!\" said Phyllis.  \"I should never have thought of snakes!\"  \"They are our greatest danger,\" was the reply.  \"Squirrels sometimes come in and steal the nuts and corn we have stored away, but the snake is the most to be feared.\"  \"So you store away food?\" Phyllis asked.  \"Do you stay here in the winter, then?\"  \"Oh, yes, we often stay all winter.  Have you not seen us flying about among the trees in the winter-time?\"  By this time the bird sat on the window-sill.  \"Must you go?\" asked Phyllis.  \"Here is a strawberry for you.\"  \"Thanks,\" said the bird, pecking away at the fruit.  \"I am just off to the corn-field.  My father showed me this morning how to open the husks of the green corn to get at the rich, milky kernels inside.\"  \"When you get your red cap, come back,\" cried Phyllis, and the young woodpecker's lively cry answered from the corn-field.     A LEGEND OF THE NORTHLAND[1]    Away, away in the Northland,     Where the hours of the day are few,   And the nights are so long in winter     They cannot sleep them through;    Where they harness the swift reindeer     To the sledges, when it snows;   And the children look like bears' cubs     In their funny, furry clothes;    They tell them a curious story--     I don't believe 'tis true;   And yet you may learn a lesson     If I tell the tale to you.    Once, when the good Saint Peter     Lived in the world below,   And walked about it, preaching,     Just as he did, you know,    He came to the door of a cottage,     In travelling round the earth,   Where a little woman was making cakes     And baking them on the hearth;    And being faint with fasting,     For the day was almost done,   He asked her from her store of cakes     To give him a single one.    So she made a very little cake,     But as it baking lay,   She looked at it, and thought it seemed     Too large to give away.    Therefore she kneaded another,     And still a smaller one,   But it looked, when she turned it over,     As large as the first had done.    Then she took a tiny scrap of dough,     And rolled and rolled it flat;   And baked it as thin as a wafer--     But she couldn't part with that.    For she said, \"My cakes that seem too small,     When I eat them myself,   Are yet too large to give away.\"     So she put them on the shelf.    Then the good Saint Peter grew angry,     For he was hungry and faint;   And surely such a woman     Was enough to provoke a saint.    And he said, \"You are far too selfish     To dwell in a human form,   To have both food and shelter,     And fire to keep you warm.    \"Now, you shall build as the birds do,     And shall get your scanty food   By boring, and boring, and boring,     All day in the hard dry wood.\"    Then up she went through the chimney,     Never speaking a word,   And out of the top flew a woodpecker,     For she was changed to a bird.    She had a scarlet cap on her head,     And that was left the same,   But all the rest of her clothes were burned     Black as a coal in the flame.    And every country schoolboy     Has seen her in the wood;   Where she lives in the trees till this very day,     Boring and boring for food.    And this is the lesson she teaches:     Live not for yourself alone,   Lest the needs you will not pity     Shall one day be your own.    Give plenty of what is given you,     Listen to pity's call;   Don't think the little you give is great,     And the much you get is small.    Now, my little boy, remember that,     And try to be kind and good,   When you see the woodpecker's sooty dress,     And see her scarlet hood.    You mayn't be changed to a bird, though you live     As selfishly as you can;   But you will be changed to a smaller thing--     A mean and a selfish man.             --Phoebe Cary.

ALL ABOUT THE WOODPECKER  SUGGESTIONS FOR FIELD LESSONS  Comes north in May--often stays all winter--most commonly seen in the fall.  Song--shrill, lively call resembling the voice of the tree-frog.  Male and female have crimson head and neck--upper parts black with white marking--white band across wings--most conspicuous when bird is in flight.  Lower parts white--bill wedge-shaped, strong, and sharp--tail strong and stiff, used as a brace when clinging to a tree-trunk and tapping with bill--toes arranged two in front and two behind for better support in clinging to tree trunks, etc.  Young birds resemble the parents, except that in colour they are a mottled gray.  Food is largely fruit--green corn, nuts, and larval insects procured from tree-trunks.--Sometimes stores away nuts, etc.  Place chosen for nest is usually a rotting tree, which is easier to bore.--Hollow from fifteen to eighteen inches deep.--Eggs pure white, generally six in number.     THE LARK  [Illustration: Larks]  IN THE MEADOW  If Jack's big black dog, Nero, had not chanced to snatch Phyllis's rag doll by the head and run away with it this story would have never been written.  You see, Nero bounded straight across the meadow and Phyllis, fearing that she would lose the doll, ran shrieking after him.  Nero was only playing, and soon dropped the doll and ran off.  Phyllis regained her property and started to return, when a bird rose from the grass at her feet with a queer whirring sound.  Phyllis looked up at the bird and then down to the spot from which it had flown.  In another moment she would have stepped in the nest.  This meadow lark's nest was unlike any other Phyllis had found.  Indeed, it could scarcely be called a nest at all.  But when she looked at it Phyllis thought what a wise little bird the meadow lark must be to choose such a place for the nest.  Had Phyllis not chanced upon it in just the way she did she might have looked all day long and not discovered it.  The nest was flat upon the ground.  Around it and over it arched the tall meadow grasses.  The nest itself was made of grass--it seemed to Phyllis that it was made in a somewhat careless manner, and that the eggs might easily roll out upon the ground.  There were four beautiful oval eggs in the nest--the largest birds' eggs Phyllis had as yet discovered.  They were over an inch long, and were of a beautiful rosy white colour, speckled closely with reddish brown spots.  As Phyllis sat very still, the mother bird crept softly back to her home.  She carefully settled herself on the grassy nest and with her bill tenderly tucked the eggs under her soft feathers.  \"How careful"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2055"],["title","Two Years Before the Mast (#0)"],["body","YEARS BEFORE THE MAST  A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea   By  Richard Henry Dana, Jr.    With an introduction and notes by  Homer Eaton Keyes, B.L.

His services in other than literary fields occupied the greater part of his life, but they brought him comparatively small recognition and many disappointments.  His happiest associations were literary, his pleasantest acquaintanceships those which arose through his fame as the author of one book. The story of his life is one of honest and competent effort, of sincere purpose, of many thwarted hopes.  The traditions of his family forced him into a profession for which he was intellectually but not temperamentally fitted: he should have been a scholar, teacher, and author; instead he became a lawyer.  Born in Cambridge, Mass., August 1, 1815, Richard Henry Dana, Jr., came of a line of Colonial ancestors whose legal understanding and patriotic zeal had won them distinction.  His father, if possessed of less vigor than his predecessors, was yet a man of culture and ability.  He was widely known as poet, critic, and lecturer; and endowed his son with native qualities of intelligence, good breeding, and honesty.  After somewhat varied and troublous school days, young Dana entered Harvard University, where he took high rank in his classes and bid fair to make a reputation as a scholar.  But at the beginning of his third year of college a severe attack of measles interrupted his course, and so affected his eyes as to preclude, for a time at least, all idea of study.  The state of the family finances was not such as to permit of foreign travel in search of health.  Accordingly, prompted by necessity and by a youthful love of adventure, he shipped as a common sailor in the brig, Pilgrim, bound for the California coast.  His term of service lasted a trifle over two years--from August, 1834, to September, 1836. The undertaking was one calculated to kill or cure. Fortunately it had the latter effect; and, upon returning to his native place, physically vigorous but intellectually starved, he reentered Harvard and worked with such enthusiasm as to graduate in six months with honor.  Then came the question of his life work.  Though intensely religious, he did not feel called to the ministry; business made no appeal; his ancestors had been lawyers; it seemed best that he should follow where they had led.  Had conditions been those of to-day, he would naturally have drifted into some field of scholarly research,--political science or history.  As it was, he entered law school, which, in 1840, he left to take up the practice of his profession. But Dana had not the tact, the personal magnetism, or the business sagacity to make a brilliant success before the bar.  Despite the fact that he had become a master of legal theory, an authority upon international questions, and a counsellor of unimpeachable integrity, his progress was painfully slow and toilsome.  Involved with his lack of tact and magnetism there was, too, an admirable quality of sturdy obstinacy that often worked him injury.  Though far from sharing the radical ideas of the Abolitionists, he was ardent in his anti-slavery ideas and did not hesitate to espouse the unpopular doctrines of the Free-Soil party of 1848, or to labor for the freedom of those Boston negroes, who, under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, were in danger of deportation to the South.  His activity in the latter direction resulted in pecuniary loss, social ostracism and worse; for upon one occasion he was set upon and nearly killed by a pair of thugs.  But Dana was not a man to be swerved from his purpose by considerations of policy or of personal safety.  He met his problems as they came to him, took the course which he believed to be right and then stuck to it with indomitable tenacity.  Yet, curiously enough, with none of the characteristics of the politician, he longed for political preferment.  At the hands of the people this came to him in smallest measure only.  Though at one time a member of the Massachusetts Legislature, he was defeated as candidate for the lower house of Congress, and in 1876 suffered the bitterest disappointment of his life, when the libellous attacks of enemies prevented the ratification of his nomination as Minister to England.  Previous to this he had served his country as United States District Attorney during the Civil War, a time when the office demanded the highest type of ability and uprightness.  That the government appreciated this was shown in 1867 by its choice of Dana as one of its counsel in the prosecution of Jefferson Davis for treason.  The position of legal representative before the Halifax tribunal of 1877, which met to discuss fishery questions at issue between the United States and Canada, was given him no doubt in part because of his eminent fitness, in part as balm for the wound of the preceding year.  But whatever satisfaction he may have found in such honors as time and ripening years brought to him, his chief joy and relaxation lay in travel. When worry and overwork began to tell upon him, he would betake himself to shore or mountains.  Upon several occasions he visited Europe, and in 1859 made a tour of the world.  At length, in 1876, he gave up active life and took residence abroad, with the idea of finding leisure for the preparation of a treatise on international law.  He was still engaged in collecting his material when, on January 6, 1882, death overtook him.  He was buried in Rome in the Protestant Cemetery, whose cypresses cast their long shadows over the graves of many distinguished foreigners who have sought a last refuge of health and peace under the skies of Italy.  Such a career as his would seem far enough from being a failure. Yet, in retirement, Dana looked back upon it not without regret. As a lawyer, he had felt a justifiable desire to see his labors crowned by his elevation to the bench; as an active participant in public affairs, he had felt that his services and talents rendered him deserving of a seat in Congress.  Lacking these things, he might have hoped that the practice of his profession would yield him a fortune.  Here again he was disappointed.  In seeking the fulfillment of his ambitions, he was always on the high road to success; he never quite arrived.  It is remarkable that, having written one successful book, Dana did not seek further reward as a man of letters.  Two Years before the Mast appeared in 1840, while its author was still a law student.  Though at the time it created no great stir in the United States, it was most favorably received in England, where it paved the way for many pleasant and valuable acquaintanceships.  The following year, Dana produced a small volume on seamanship, entitled The Seaman's Friend.  This, and a short account of a trip to Cuba in 1859, constitute the sole additions to his early venture.  He was a copious letter-writer and kept full journals of his various travels; but he never elaborated them for publication.  Yet, long before his death, he had seen the narrative of his sailor days recognized as an American classic. Time has not diminished its reputation.  We read it to-day not merely for its simple, unpretentious style; but for its clear picture of sea life previous to the era of steam navigation, and for its graphic description of conditions in California before visions of gold sent the long lines of \"prairie schooners\" drifting across the plains to unfold the hidden destiny of the West.   California and her Missions  It is not easy to realize that, during the stirring days when the eastern coast-line of North America was experiencing the ferment of revolution, the Pacific seaboard was almost totally unexplored, its population largely a savage one.  But Spain, long established in Mexico, was slowly pushing northward along the California coast. Her emissaries were the Franciscan friars; her method the founding of Indian missions round which, in due course, should arise towns intended to afford harbor for Spanish ships and to serve as outposts against the steady encroachments of Russia, who, from Alaska, was reaching out toward San Francisco Bay.  Thus began the white settlement of California.  San Diego Mission was founded in 1769; San Carlos, at Monterey, in 1770; San Francisco, in 1776; Santa Barbara, in 1786.  For the general guardianship of these missions a garrison, or presidio, was in each case provided. It was responsible not only for the protection of the town thus created, but for all the missions in the district.  The presidio of San Diego, for example, was in charge of the missions of San Diego, San Gabriel, San Juan Capistrano, and San Luis Rey.  So, likewise, there were garrisons with extensive jurisdiction at Santa Barbara, Monterey, and San Francisco.  The Indians in the immediate vicinity of a mission were attached thereto by a sort of gentle enslavement.  They were provided special quarters, were carefully looked after by the priests, their religious education fostered, and their innate laziness conquered by specific requirements of labor in agriculture, cattle raising, and simple handicrafts.  It was an arrangement which worked well for "]]]
