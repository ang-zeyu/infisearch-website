But how are we going to get back? That's the question. And what'll the professor think? He'll write home that we've run away. And what'll we do in Savannah without any money?\"  \"You'd better have thought of some of these things before you got us into waiting to go back with the pilot,\" said Harry.  As for Tom Myers and his brother George, they just sat down and put their arms on the railing, and clapped their faces down on their arms. They cried all over their coat-sleeves, but kept as quiet as they could about it. Whenever these two boys had to cry before any of the rest of the school-fellows, they had learned to keep very quiet about it.  While the rest of us were talking away, and Scott and Harry finding fault with each other, the captain came back. He looked in a little better humor.  \"The only thing that can be done with you boys,\" he said, \"is to put you on some tug or small craft that's going back to New York. If we meet one, I'll lie to and let you off. But it will put me to a great deal of trouble, and we may meet with nothing that will take you aboard. You have acted very badly. If you had come right to me, or to any of the officers, the moment you found we had started, I could have easily put you on shore. There are lots of small boats about the piers that would have come out after you, or I might even have put back. But I can do nothing now but look out for some craft bound for New York that will take you aboard. If we don't meet one, you'll have to go on to Savannah.\"  This made us feel a little better. We were now in the lower bay, and there would certainly be some sort of a vessel that would stop for the boys. We all went to the forward deck and looked out. It was pretty cold there, and we soon began to shiver in the wind, but still we stuck it out.  There were a good many vessels, but most of them were big ones. We could hardly have the impudence to ask a great three-masted ship, under full sail, to stop and give us a lift to New York. At any rate, we had nothing to do with the asking. The captain would attend to that. But every time we came near a vessel going the other way, we looked about to see if we could see anything of an officer with a trumpet, standing all ready to sing out, \"Sail ho!\"  But, after a while, we felt so cold that we couldn't stand it any longer, and we went below. We might have gone and stood by the smoke-stack and warmed ourselves, but we didn't know enough about ships to think of this.  We hadn't been standing around the stove in the dining-room more than ten minutes, before the purser came hurrying toward us.  \"Come, now,\" he said, \"tumble forward! The captain's hailed a pilot-boat.\"  \"Hurrah!\" said Scott; \"we're going back in a pilot-boat, after all!\" and we all ran after the purser to the lower forward deck. Our engines had stopped, and not far from us was a rough-looking little schooner with a big \"17\" painted in black on her mainsail. She was \"putting about,\" the purser said, and her sails were flapping in the wind.  There was a great change in the countenances of Tom Myers and his brother George. They looked like a couple of new boys.  \"Isn't this capital?\" said Scott. \"Everything's turned out all right.\"  But all of a sudden he changed his tune.  \"Look here!\" said he to me, pulling me on one side; \"wont that pilot want to be paid something? He wont stop his vessel and take us back for nothing, will he?\"  I couldn't say anything about this, but I asked the purser, who still stood by us.  \"I don't suppose he'll make any regular charge,\" said he; \"but he'll expect you to give him something,--whatever you please.\"  \"But we haven't anything,\" said Scott to me. \"We have our return tickets to Willisville, and that's about all.\"  \"Perhaps we can't go back, after all,\" said Harry, glumly, while Tom Myers and his brother George began to drop their lower jaws again.  I did not believe that the pilot-boat people would ask to see the boys' money before they took them on board; but I couldn't help feeling that it would be pretty hard for them to go ashore at the city and give nothing for their passages but promises, and so I called Rectus on one side, and proposed to lend the fellows some money. He agreed, and I unpinned a banknote and gave it to Scott. He was mightily tickled to get it, and vowed he'd send it back to me in the first letter he wrote (and he did it, too).  The pilot-schooner did not come very near us, but she lowered a boat with two men in it, and they rowed up to the steamer. Some of our sailors let down a pair of stairs, and one of the men in the boat came up to see what was wanted. The purser was telling him, when the captain, who was standing on the upper deck, by the pilot-house, sung out:  \"Hurry up there, now, and don't keep this vessel here any longer. Get 'em out as quick as you can, Mr. Brown.\"  The boys didn't stop to have this kind invitation repeated, and Scott scuffled down the stairs into the boat as fast as he could, followed closely by Harry Alden. Tom Myers and his brother George stopped long enough to bid each of us good-bye, and shake hands with us, and then they went down the stairs. They had to climb over the railing to the platform in front of the wheel-house to get to the stairs, and as the steamer rolled a little, and the stairs shook, they went down very slowly, backward, and when they got to the bottom were afraid to step into the boat, which looked pretty unsteady as it wobbled about under them.  \"Come, there! Be lively!\" shouted the captain.  Just then, Rectus made a step forward. He had been looking very anxiously at the boys as they got into the boat, but he hadn't said anything.  \"Where are you going?\" said I; for, as quick as a flash, the thought came into my mind that Rectus's heart had failed him, and that he would like to back out.  \"I think I'll go back with the boys,\" he said, making another step toward the top of the stairs, down which the man from the pilot-boat was hurrying.  \"Just you try it!\" said I, and I put out my arm in front of him.  He didn't try it, and I'm glad he didn't, for I should have been sorry enough to have had the boys go back and say that when they last saw Rectus and I we were having a big fight on the deck of the steamer.  The vessel now started off, and Rectus and I went to the upper deck and stood and watched the little boat, as it slowly approached the schooner. We were rapidly leaving them, but we saw the boys climb on board, and one of them--it must have been Scott--waved his handkerchief to us. I waved mine in return, but Rectus kept his in his pocket. I don't think he felt in a wavy mood.  While we were standing looking at the distant pilot-boat, I began to consider a few matters; and the principal thing was this: How were Rectus and I to stand toward each other? Should we travel like a couple of school-friends, or should I make him understand that he was under my charge and control, and must behave himself accordingly? I had no idea what he thought of the matter, and by the way he addressed me when we met, I supposed that it was possible that he looked upon me very much as he used to when we went to school together. If he had said Mr. Gordon, it would have been more appropriate, I thought, and would have encouraged me, too, in taking position as his supervisor. As far as my own feelings were concerned, I think I would have preferred to travel about on a level with Rectus, and to have a good time with him, as two old school-fellows might easily have, even if one did happen to be two years older than the other. But that would not be earning my salary. After a good deal of thought, I came to the conclusion that I would let things go on as they would, for a while, giving Rectus a good deal of rope; but the moment he began to show signs of insubordination, I would march right on him, and quell him with an iron hand. After that, all would be plain sailing, and we could have as much fun as we pleased, for Rectus would know exactly how far he could go.  There were but few passengers on deck, for it was quite cold, and it now began to grow dark, and we went below. Pretty soon the dinner-bell rang, and I was glad to hear it, for I had the appetite of a horse. There was a first-rate dinner, ever so many different kinds of dishes, all up and down the table, which had ridges running lengthwise, under the table-cloth, to keep the plates from sliding off, if a storm should come up. Before we were done with dinner the shelves above the table began to swing a good deal,--or rather the vessel rolled and the shelves kept their places,--so I knew we must be pretty well out to sea, but I had not expected it would be so rough, for the day had been fine and clear. When we left the table, it was about as much as we could do to keep our feet, and in less than a quarter of an hour I began to feel dreadfully. I stuck it out as long as I could, and then I went to bed. The old ship rolled, and she pitched, and she heaved, and she butted, right and left, against the waves, and made herself just as uncomfortable for human beings as she could, but, for all that, I went to sleep after a while.  I don't know how long I slept, but when I woke up, there was Rectus, sitting on a little bench by the state-room wall, with his feet braced against the berth. He was hard at work sucking a lemon. I turned over and looked down at him. He didn't look a bit sick. I hated to see him eating lemons.  \"Don't you feel badly, Rectus?\" said I.  \"Oh no!\" said he; \"I'm all right. You ought to suck a lemon. Have one?\"  I declined his offer. The idea of eating or drinking anything was intensely"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20651"],["title","A Jolly Fellowship (#4)"],["body","to me. I wished that Rectus would put down that lemon. He did throw it away after a while, but he immediately began to cut another one.  [Illustration: RECTUS AND THE LEMONS.]  \"Rectus,\" said I, \"you'll make yourself sick. You'd better go to bed.\"  \"It's just the thing to stop me from being sick,\" said he, and at that minute the vessel gave her stern a great toss over sideways, which sent Rectus off his seat, head foremost into the wash-stand. I was glad to see it. I would have been glad of almost anything that stopped that lemon business.  But it didn't stop it; and he only picked himself up, and sat down again, his lemon at his mouth.  \"Rectus!\" I cried, leaning out of my berth. \"Put down that lemon and go to bed!\"  He put down the lemon without a word, and went to bed. I turned over with a sense of relief. Rectus was subordinate!     CHAPTER III.  RECTUS OPENS HIS EYES.   I was all right the next day, and we staid on deck most of the time, standing around the smoke-stack when our noses got a little blue with the cold. There were not many other people on deck. I was expecting young Rectus to have his turn at sea-sickness, but he disappointed me. He spent a good deal of his time calculating our position on a little folding-map he had. He inquired how fast we were going, and then he worked the whole thing out, from Sandy Hook to Savannah, marking on the map the hours at which he ought to be at such and such a place. He tried his best to get his map of the course all right, and made a good many alterations, so that we were off Cape Charles several times in the course of the day. Rectus had never been very good at calculations, and I was glad to see that he was beginning to take an interest in such things.  The next morning, just after day-break, we were awakened by a good deal of tramping about on deck, over our heads, and we turned out, sharp, to see what the matter was. Rectus wanted me to wait, after we were dressed, until he could get out his map and calculate where we were, but I couldn't stop for such nonsense, for I knew that his kind of navigation didn't amount to much, and so we scrambled up on deck. The ship was pitching and tossing worse than she had done yet. We had been practising the \"sea-leg\" business the day before, and managed to walk along pretty well; but this morning our sea-legs didn't work at all, and we couldn't take a step without hanging on to something. When we got on deck, we found that the first officer, or mate,--his name was Randall,--with three or four sailors, was throwing the lead to see how deep the water was. We hung on to a couple of stays and watched them. It was a rousing big lead, a foot long, and the line ran out over a pulley at the stern. A sailor took the lead a good way forward before he threw it, so as to give it a chance to get to the bottom before the steamer passed over it and began to tow it. When they pulled it in, we were surprised to see that it took three men to do it. Then Mr. Randall scooped out a piece of tallow that was in a hollow in the bottom of the lead, and took it to show to the captain, whose room was on deck. I knew this was one way they had of finding out where they were, for they examined the sand or mud on the tallow, and so knew what sort of a bottom they were going over; and all the different kinds of bottom were marked out on their charts.  As Mr. Randall passed us, Rectus sung out to him, and asked him where we were now.  \"Off Hatteras,\" said he, quite shortly.  I didn't think Rectus should have bothered Mr. Randall with questions when he was so busy; but after he went into the captain's room, the men did not seem to have much to do, and I asked one of them how deep it was.  \"About seventeen fathoms,\" said he.  \"Can we see Cape Hatteras?\" I said, trying to get a good look landward as the vessel rolled over that way.  \"No,\" said the man. \"We could see the light just before day-break, but the weather's gettin' thick now, and we're keepin' out.\"  It was pretty thick to the west, that was true. All that I could see in the distance was a very mixed-up picture of wave-tops and mist. I knew that Cape Hatteras was one of the most dangerous points on the coast, and that sailors were always glad when they had safely rounded it, and so I began to take a good deal of interest in what was going on. There was a pretty strong wind from the south-east, and we had no sail set at all. Every now and then the steamer would get herself up on top of a big wave, and then drop down, sideways, as if she were sliding off the top of a house. The mate and the captain soon came out on deck together, and the captain went forward to the pilot-house, while Mr. Randall came over to his men, and they got ready to throw the lead again. It didn't seem to me that the line ran out as far as it did the last time, and I think I heard Mr. Randall say, \"Fourteen.\" At any rate, a man was sent forward to the pilot-house, and directly we heard the rudder-chains creaking, and the big iron arms of the rudder, which were on deck, moved over toward the landward side of the vessel, and I knew by that that the captain was putting her head out to sea. Mr. Randall took out the tallow from the lead and laid it in an empty bucket that was lashed to the deck. He seemed to be more anxious now about the depth of water than about the kind of bottom we were passing over. The lead was just about to be thrown again, when Rectus, who had taken the tallow out of the bucket, which stood near us, and had examined it pretty closely, started off to speak to Mr. Randall, with the tallow in his hand.  [Illustration: \"'HOLD YOUR TONGUE!' ROARED MR. RANDALL.\"]  \"Look here!\" said Rectus, holding on to the railing. \"I'll tell you what would be a sight better than tallow for your leads. Just you get some fine, white Castile-soap, and----\"  \"Confound you!\" roared Mr. Randall, turning savagely on him. \"Hold your tongue! For three cents I'd tie you to this line and drag the bottom with you!\"  Rectus made no answer. He didn't offer him the three cents, but came away promptly, and put the piece of tallow back in the bucket. He didn't get any comfort from me.  \"Haven't you got any better sense,\" I said to him, \"than to go, with your nonsense, to the first officer at such a time as this? I never saw such a boy!\"  \"But the soap _is_ better than the tallow,\" said Rectus. \"It's finer and whiter, and would take up the sand better.\"  \"No, it wouldn't,\" I growled at him; \"the water would wash it out in half a minute. You needn't be trying to tell anybody on this ship what they ought to do.\"  \"But supposing----\" said he.  \"No,\" I exclaimed, in a way that made him jump, \"there's no supposing about it. If you know their business better than they do, why, just let it stand that way. It wont hurt you.\"  I was pretty mad, I must say, for I didn't want to see a fellow like Rectus trying to run the ship. But you couldn't stay mad with Rectus long. He didn't mean any wrong, and he gave no words back, and so, as you might expect, we were all right again by breakfast-time.  The next morning we were surprised to feel how warm it was on deck. We didn't need our overcoats. The sea was ever so much smoother, too. There were two or three ladies on deck, who could walk pretty well.  About noon, I was standing on the upper deck, when I saw Rectus coming toward me, looking very pale. He was generally a dark sort of a boy, and it made a good deal of difference in him to look pale. I was sure he was going to be sick, at last,--although it was rather queer for him to knock under when the voyage was pretty nearly over,--and I began to laugh, when he said to me, in a nervous sort of way:  \"I tell you what it is, I believe that we've gone past the mouth of the Savannah River. According to my calculations,\" said he, pointing to a spot on his map, which he held in his hand, \"we must be down about here, off the Georgia coast.\"  I have said that I began to laugh, and now I kept on. I just sat down and roared, so that the people looked at me.  \"You needn't laugh,\" said Rectus. \"I believe it's so.\"  \"All right, my boy,\" said I; \"but we wont tell the captain. Just let's wait and have the fun of seeing him turn around and go back.\"  Rectus didn't say anything to this, but walked off with his map.  [Illustration: \"RECTUS SHOWED ME THE MAP.\"]  Now, that boy was no fool. I believe that he was beginning to feel like doing something, and, as he had never done anything before, he didn't know how.  About twelve o'clock we reached the mouth of the Savannah (without turning back), and sailed twenty miles up the river to the city.  We were the first two persons off that vessel, and we took a hack to the hotel that the purser had recommended to us, and had the satisfaction of reaching it about ten minutes ahead of the people who came in the omnibus; although I don't know that that was of much use to us, as the clerk gave us top rooms, any way.  We went pretty nearly all over Savannah that afternoon and the next day. It's a beautiful city. There is a little public square at nearly every corner, and one of the wide streets has a double row of big trees running right down the middle of it, with grass under them, and, what seemed stranger yet, the trees were all in leaf, little children were playing on the grass, and the weather was warm and splendid. The gardens in front of the houses were full of roses and all sorts of flowers in blossom, and Rectus wanted to buy a straw hat and get his linen trousers out of his trunk.  \"No, sir,\" said I; \"I'm not going around with a fellow wearing a straw hat and linen breeches in January. You don't see anybody else wearing them.\"  \"No,\" said he; \"but it's warm enough.\"  \"You may think so,\" I answered; \"but I guess they know their own business best. This is their coldest season, and if they wore straw hats and linen clothes now, what would they put on when the scorching hot weather comes?\"  Rectus didn't know, and that matter was"]]]
