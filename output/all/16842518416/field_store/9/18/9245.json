Now, Prince Trevannion; just to what extent will the Mastership retain its sovereignty under the Empire?\"  \"To practically the same extent as at present. You will, of course, acknowledge the Emperor as your supreme ruler, and will govern subject to the Imperial Constitution. Have you any colonies on any of the other planets of this system?\"  \"We had a shipyard and docks on the inner moon, and we had mines on the fourth planet of this system, but it is almost airless and the colony was limited to a couple of dome-cities. Both were abandoned years ago.\"  \"Both will be reopened before long, I daresay. We'd better make the limits of your sovereignty the orbit of the outer planet of this system. You may have your own normal-space ships, but the Empire will control all hyperdrive craft, and all nuclear weapons. I take it you are the sole government on this planet? Then no other will be permitted to compete with you.\"  [Illustration]  \"Well, what are they taking away from us, then?\" somebody in the rear asked.  \"I assume that you are agreed to accept the sovereignty of his Imperial Majesty? Good. As a matter of form, Lord Nikkolon, will you take a vote? His Imperial Majesty would be most gratified if it were unanimous.\"  Somebody insisted that the question would have to be debated, which meant that everybody would have to make a speech, all two thousand of them. He informed them that there was nothing to debate; they were confronted with an accomplished fact which they must accept. So Nikkolon made a speech, telling them at what a great moment in Adityan history they stood, and concluded by saying:  \"I take it that it is the unanimous will of this Convocation that the sovereignty of the Galactic Emperor be acknowledged, and that we, the 'Mastership of Aditya' do here proclaim our loyal allegiance to his Imperial Majesty, Rodrik the Third. Any dissent? Then it is ordered so recorded.\"  Then he had to make another speech, to inform the representatives of his new sovereign of the fact. Prince Trevannion, in the name of the Emperor, delivered the well-worn words of welcome, and Lanze Degbrend got the coronet out of the black velvet bag under his arm and the Imperial Proconsul, Obray, Count Erskyll, was crowned. Erskyll's charge-d'affaires, Sharll Ernanday, produced the scroll of the Imperial Constitution, and Erskyll began to read.  Section One: The universality of the Empire. The absolute powers of the Emperor. The rules of succession. The Emperor also to be Planetary King of Odin.  Section Two: Every planetary government to be sovereign in its own internal affairs.... Only one sovereign government upon any planet, or within normal-space travel distance.... All hyperspace ships, and all nuclear weapons.... No planetary government shall make war ... enter into any alliance ... tax, regulate or restrain interstellar trade or communication.... Every sapient being shall be equally protected....  Then he came to Article Six. He cleared his throat, raised his voice, and read:  \"_There shall be no chattel-slavery or serfdom anywhere in the Empire; no sapient being, of any race whatsoever, shall be the property of any being but himself._\"  The Convocation Chamber was silent, like a bomb with a defective fuse, for all of thirty seconds. Then it blew up with a roar. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the doors slide apart and an airjeep, bristling with machine guns, float in and rise to the ceiling. The first inarticulate roar was followed by a babel of voices, like a tropical cloudburst on a prefab hut. Olvir Nikkolon's mouth was working as he shouted unheard.  He pressed another of the row of buttons on the arm of his chair. Out of the screen-speaker a voice, as loud, by actual sound-meter test, as an anti-vehicle gun, thundered:  \"SILENCE!\"  Into the shocked stillness which it produced, he spoke, like a schoolmaster who has returned to find his room in an uproar:  \"Lord Nikkolon; what is this nonsense? You are Chairman of the Presidium; is this how you keep order here? What is this, a planetary parliament or a spaceport saloon?\"  \"You tricked us!\" Nikkolon accused. \"You didn't tell us about that article when we voted. Why, our whole society is based on slavery!\"  Other voices joined in:  \"That's all right for you people, you have robots....\"  \"Maybe you don't know it, but there are twenty million slaves on this planet....\"  \"Look, you can't free slaves! That's ridiculous. A slave's a _slave_!\"  \"Who'll do the work? And who would they belong to? They'd have to belong to somebody!\"  \"What I want to know,\" Rovard Javasan made himself heard, is, \"_how_ are you going to free them?\"  There was an ancient word, originating in one of the lost languages of Pre-Atomic Terra--_sixtifor_. It meant, the basic, fundamental, question. Rovard Javasan, he suspected, had just asked the sixtifor. Of course, Obray, Count Erskyll, Planetary Proconsul of Aditya, didn't realize that. He didn't even know what Javasan meant. Just free them. Commodore Vann Shatrak couldn't see much of a problem, either. He would have answered, Just free them, and then shoot down the first two or three thousand who took it seriously. Jurgen, Prince Trevannion, had no intention whatever of attempting to answer the sixtifor.  \"My dear Lord Javasan, that is the problem of the Adityan Mastership. They are your slaves; we have neither the intention nor the right to free them. But let me remind you that slavery is specifically prohibited by the Imperial Constitution; if you do not abolish it immediately, the Empire will be forced to intervene. I believe, toward the last of those audio-visuals, you saw some examples of Imperial intervention.\"  They had. A few looked apprehensively at the ceiling, as though expecting the hellburners and planet-busters and nega-matter-bombs at any moment. Then one of the members among the benches rose.  \"We don't know how we are going to do it, Prince Trevannion,\" he said. \"We will do it, since this is the Empire law, but you will have to tell us how.\"  \"Well, the first thing will have to be an Act of Convocation, outlawing the ownership of one being by another. Set some definite date on which the slaves must all be freed; that need not be too immediate. Then, I would suggest that you set up some agency to handle all the details. And, as soon as you have enacted the abolition of slavery, which should be this afternoon, appoint a committee, say a dozen of you, to confer with Count Erskyll and myself. Say you have your committee aboard the _Empress Eulalie_ in six hours. We'll have transportation arranged by then. And let me point out, I hope for the last time, that we discuss matters directly, without intermediaries. We don't want any more slaves, pardon, freedmen, coming aboard to talk for you, as happened yesterday.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Obray, Count Erskyll, was unhappy about it. He did not think that the Lords-Master were to be trusted to abolish slavery; he said so, on the launch, returning to the ship. Jurgen, Prince Trevannion was inclined to agree. He doubted if any of the Lords-Master he had seen were to be trusted, unassisted, to fix a broken mouse-trap.  Line-Commodore Vann Shatrak was also worried. He was wondering how long it would take for Pyairr Ravney to make useful troops out of the newly-surrendered slave soldiers, and where he was going to find contragravity to shift them expeditiously from trouble-spot to trouble-spot. Erskyll thought he was anticipating resistance on the part of the Masters, and for once he approved the use of force. Ordinarily, force was a Bad Thing, but this was a Good Cause, which justified any means.  They entertained the committee from the Convocation for dinner, that evening. They came aboard stiffly hostile--most understandably so, under the circumstances--and Prince Trevannion exerted all his copious charm to thaw them out, beginning with the pre-dinner cocktails and continuing through the meal. By the time they retired for coffee and brandy to the parlor where the conference was to be held, the Lords-ex-Masters were almost friendly.  \"We've enacted the Emancipation Act,\" Olvir Nikkolon, who was ex officio chairman of the committee, reported. \"Every slave on the planet must be free before the opening of the next Midyear Feasts.\"  \"And when will that be?\"  Aditya, he knew, had a three hundred and fifty-eight day year; even if the Midyear Feasts were just past, they were giving themselves very little time. In about a hundred and fifty days, Nikkolon said.  \"Good heavens!\" Erskyll began, indignantly.  \"I should say so, myself,\" he put in, cutting off anything else the new Proconsul might have said. \"You gentlemen are allowing yourselves dangerously little time. A hundred and fifty days will pass quite rapidly, and you have twenty million slaves to deal with. If you start at this moment and work continuously, you'll have a little under a second apiece for each slave.\"  The Lords-Master looked dismayed. So, he was happy to observe, did Count Erskyll.  \"I assume you have some system of slave registration?\" he continued.  That was safe. They had a bureaucracy, and bureaucracies tend to have registrations of practically everything.  \"Oh, yes, of course,\" Rovard Javasan assured him. \"That's your Management, isn't it, Sesar; Servile Affairs?\"  \"Yes, we have complete data on every slave on the planet,\" Sesar Martwynn, the Chief of Servile Management, said. \"Of course, I'd have to ask Zhorzh about the details....\"  Zhorzh was Zhorzh Khouzhik, Martwynn's chief-slave in office.  \"At least, he was my chief-slave; now you people have taken him away from me. I don't know what I'm going to do without him. For that matter, I don't know what poor Zhorzh will do,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20726"],["title","A Slave is a Slave (#6)"],["body","her.\"  \"Have you gentlemen informed your chief-slaves that they are free, yet?\"  Nikkolon and Javasan looked at each other. Sesar Martwynn laughed.  \"They know,\" Javasan said. \"I must say they are much disturbed.\"  \"Well, reassure them, as soon as you're back at the Citadel,\" he told them. \"Tell them that while they are now free, they need not leave you unless they so desire; that you will provide for them as before.\"  \"You mean, we can keep our chief-slaves?\" somebody cried.  \"Yes, of course--chief-freedmen, you'll have to call them, now. You'll have to pay them a salary....\"  \"You mean, give them money?\" Ranal Valdry, the Lord Provost-Marshal demanded, incredulously. \"Pay our own slaves?\"  \"You idiot,\" somebody told him, \"they aren't our slaves any more. That's the whole point of this discussion.\"  \"But ... but how can we pay slaves?\" one of the committeemen-at-large asked. \"Freedmen, I mean?\"  \"With money. You do have money, haven't you?\"  \"Of course we have. What do you think we are, savages?\"  \"What kind of money?\"  Why, money; what did he think? The unit was the star-piece, the stelly. When he asked to see some of it, they were indignant. Nobody carried money; wasn't Masterly. A Master never even touched the stuff; that was what slaves were for. He wanted to know how it was secured, and they didn't know what he meant, and when he tried to explain their incomprehension deepened. It seemed that the Mastership issued money to finance itself, and individual Masters issued money on their personal credit, and it was handled through the Mastership Banks.  \"That's Fedrig Daffysan's Management; he isn't here,\" Rovard Javasan said. \"I can't explain it, myself.\"  And without his chief-slave, Fedrig Daffysan probably would not be able to, either.  \"Yes, gentlemen. I understand. You have money. Now, the first thing you will have to do is furnish us with a complete list of all the slave-owners on the planet, and a list of all the slaves held by each. This will be sent back to Odin, and will be the basis for the compensation to be paid for the destruction of your property-rights in these slaves. How much is a slave worth, by the way?\"  Nobody knew. Slaves were never sold; it wasn't Masterly to sell one's slaves. It wasn't even heard of.  \"Well, we'll arrive at some valuation. Now, as soon as you get back to the Citadel, talk at once to your former chief-slaves, and their immediate subordinates, and explain the situation to them. This can be passed down through administrative freedmen to the workers; you must see to it that it is clearly understood, at all levels, that as long as the freedmen remain at their work they will be provided for and paid, but that if they quit your service they will receive nothing. Do you think you can do that?\"  \"You mean, give them everything we've been giving them now, and then pay them money?\" Ranal Valdry almost howled.  \"Oh, no. You pay them a fixed wage. You charge them for everything you give them, and deduct that from their wages. It will mean considerable extra bookkeeping, but outside of that I believe you'll find that things will go along much as they always did.\"  The Masters had begun to relax, and by the time he was finished all of them were smiling in relief. Count Erskyll, on the other hand, was almost writhing in his chair. It must be horrible to be a brilliant young Proconsul of liberal tendencies and to have to sit mute while a cynical old Ministerial Secretary, vastly one's superior in the Imperial Establishment and a distant cousin of the Emperor to boot, calmly bartered away the sacred liberties of twenty million people.  \"But would that be legal, under the Imperial Constitution?\" Olvir Nikkolon asked.  \"I shouldn't have suggested it if it hadn't been. The Constitution only forbids physical ownership of one sapient being by another; it emphatically does not guarantee anyone an unearned livelihood.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Convocation committee returned to Zeggensburg to start preparing the servile population for freedom, or reasonable facsimile. The chief-slaves would take care of that; each one seemed to have a list of other chief-slaves, and the word would spread from them on an each-one-call-five system. The public announcement would be postponed until the word could be passed out to the upper servile levels. A meeting with the chief-slaves in office of the various Managements was scheduled for the next afternoon.  Count Erskyll chatted with forced affability while the departing committeemen were being seen to the launch that would take them down. When the airlock closed behind them, he drew Prince Trevannion aside out of earshot of their subordinates.  \"You know what you're doing?\" he raged, in a hoarse whisper. \"You're simply substituting peonage for outright slavery!\"  \"I'd call that something of a step.\" He motioned Erskyll into one of the small hall-cars, climbed in beside him, and lifted it, starting toward the living-area. \"The Convocation has acknowledged the principle that sapient beings should not be property. That's a great deal, for one day.\"  \"But the people will remain in servitude, you know that. The Masters will keep them in debt, and they'll be treated just as brutally....\"  \"Oh, there will be abuses; that's to be expected. This Freedmen's Management, nee Servile Management, will have to take care of that. Better make a memo to talk with this chief-freedman of Martwynn's, what's his name? Zhorzh Khouzhik; that's right, let Zhorzh do it. Employment Practices Code, investigation agency, enforcement. If he can't do the job, that's not our fault. The Empire does not guarantee every planet an honest, intelligent and efficient government; just a single one.\"  \"But....\"  \"It will take two or three generations. At first, the freedmen will be exploited just as they always have been, but in time there will be protests, and disorders, and each time, there will be some small improvement. A society must evolve, Obray. Let these people earn their freedom. Then they will be worthy of it.\"  \"They should have their freedom now.\"  \"This present generation? What do you think freedom means to them? _We don't have to work, any more._ So down tools and let everything stop at once. _We can do anything we want to._ Let's kill the overseer. And: _Anything that belongs to the Masters belongs to us; we're Masters too, now._ No, I think it's better, for the present, to tell them that this freedom business is just a lot of Masterly funny-talk, and that things aren't really being changed at all. It will effect a considerable saving of his Imperial Majesty's ammunition, for one thing.\"  He dropped Erskyll at his apartment and sent the hall-car back from his own. Lanze Degbrend was waiting for him when he entered.  \"Ravney's having trouble. That is the word he used,\" Degbrend said. In Pyairr Ravney's lexicon, trouble meant shooting. \"The news of the Emancipation Act is leaking all over the place. Some of the troops in the north who haven't been disarmed yet are mutinying, and there are slave insurrections in a number of places.\"  \"They think the Masters have forsaken them, and it's every slave for himself.\" He hadn't expected that to start so soon. \"The announcement had better go out as quickly as possible. And I think we're going to have some trouble. You have information-taps into Count Erskyll's numerous staff? Use them as much as you can.\"  \"You think he's going to try to sabotage this employment programme of yours, sir?\"  \"Oh, he won't think of it in those terms. He'll be preventing me from sabotaging the Emancipation. He doesn't want to wait three generations; he wants to free them at once. Everything has to be at once for six-month-old puppies, six-year-old children, and reformers of any age.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The announcement did not go out until nearly noon the next day. In terms comprehensible to any low-grade submoron, it was emphasized that all this meant was that slaves should henceforth be called freedmen, that they could have money just like Lords-Master, and that if they worked faithfully and obeyed orders they would be given everything they were now receiving. Ravney had been shuttling troops about, dealing with the sporadic outbreaks of disorder here and there: many of these had been put down, and the rest died out after the telecast explaining the situation.  In addition, some of Commander Douvrin's intelligence people had discovered that the only source of fissionables and radioactives for the planet was a complex of uranite mines, separation plants, refineries and reaction-plants on the smaller of Aditya's two continents, Austragonia. In spite of other urgent calls on his resources, Ravney landed troops to seize these, and a party of engineers followed them down from the _Empress Eulalie_ to make an inspection.  At lunch, Count Erskyll was slightly less intransigent on the subject of the wage-employment proposals. No doubt some of his advisors had been telling him what would happen if any appreciable number of Aditya's labor-force stopped work suddenly, and the wave of uprisings that had broken out before any public announcement had been made puzzled him. He was also concerned about finding a suitable building for a proconsular palace; the business of the Empire on Aditya could not be conducted long from shipboard.  Going down to the Citadel that afternoon, they found the chief-freedmen of the non-functional Chiefs of Management assembled in a large room on the fifth level down. There was a cluster of big tables and communication-screens and wired telephones in the middle, with smaller tables around them, at which freedmen in variously colored gowns sat. The ones at the central tables, a dozen and a half, all wore chief-slaves' white gowns.  Trevannion and Erskyll and Patrique Morvill and Lanze Degbrend joined these; subordinates guided the rest of the party--a couple of Ravney's officers and Erskyll's numerous "]]]
