We 're sorry, but Maxime is have hees day,           De ole man's gettin' on.\"    It's foolish t'ing to do, for dere 's alway hang aroun'     Some crazy feller almos' ev'ry day--   So I might a' stay at home 'stead o' tryin' feex de boom,     Dough I 'm sure de win' is blow de oder way;   For I never hear dem shout w'en dey let de water out,     An' de log dey come a-bangin' down de chute,   But leetle Joe Leblanc ketch me on de pant, hooraw!     Den spile de job by w'isperin', \"I 'm afraid I spik de trut',           De ole man 's gettin' on.\"    Only yesterday de pig get loose an' run away,     An' de nex' t'ing he was goin' on de corn--   So I run an' fetch de stick, an' after heem so quick     Jus' to mak' heem feelin' sorry he was born;   An' dat pig he laugh at me, an' he fill hees belly full     'Fore he 's makin' up his min' for come along--   I 'm sure I see heem wink--should n't wonder if he t'ink,     \"Very easy see dere 's somet'ing goin' wrong--           De ole man 's gettin on.\"    If only I can get some doctor feex me up,     Mak' me feel a leetle looser on de knee--   On de shoulder, ev'ryw'ere--ba tonder!

Oh! dat maudit rheumateez! now she's ketchin' me again     On de back becos I 'm leetle bit excite,   An' put ma finger down, widout stoopin' on de groun'--     But I 'll do dat trick to-morrow, not to-night--   All de sam' I often t'ink ev'ry dog is got hees day,     Dat 's de lesson I was learnin' on de school;   So I can't help feelin' blue w'en I wonder if it 's true     W'at dey 're sayin'--dough o' course dey 're only fool--           De ole man 's gettin' on.  [Illustration: Thistle]     [Illustration: Border]  Pioneers    If dey 're walkin' on de roadside, an' dey 're bote in love togeder,     An' de star of spring is shinin' wit' de young moon in between,   It was purty easy guessin' dey 're not talkin' of de wedder,     W'en de boy is comin' twenty, an' de girl is jus' eighteen.    It 's a sign de winter 's over, an' it 's pleasan' hear de talkin'     Of de bull-frog on de swamp dere wit' all hees familee--   But it 's lonesome doin' not'ing, an' dere 's not moche fun in walkin',     So we fin' some fence dat 's handy for mese'f an' Rosalie.  [Illustration: \"So we fin' some fence dat 's handy                      for mese'f an' Rosalie.\"]    An' I dunno how it happen, w'en her head come on ma shoulder,     An' her black eye on de moonlight, lak de star shine--dat 's de way.   (Mebbe it 's becos de springtam) so I ketch her han' an' tole her     Of how moche I 'd lak to tak' her on some contree far away.    Den she say, I 'll mak' an offer, if you 're sure you want to tak' me     On de place I dunno w'ere--me--you mus' pay beeg price, Jo-seph.   You can carry me off to-morrow, so I 'm never comin' back--me--     But you 'll lose upon de bargain, for de price I want's you'se'f.\"    I was purty good for tradin', mebbe tak' it from ma fader,     For de ole man 's alway tryin' show me somet'ing dat was new--   But de trade I mak' dat evenin' wit' poor Rosalie, I rader     Not say not'ing moche about it, dough it 's bes' I never do.    So we settle on de reever wit' de bush for miles behin' us--     Here we buil' de firse log shaintee, only me an' Rosalie--   Dat 's de woman help her husban'! an' w'en winter come an' fin' us     We was ready waitin' for heem jus' as happy as could be.    Bar'l o' pork an' good potato, wan or two oder t'ing too     Leetle w'isky, plaintee flour, an' wood-pile stannin' near--   Don't min' de hardes' winter, an' fat enough in spring too--     De folk dat 's comin' handy w'en you want de contree clear!    Rosalie, you see her outside on de porch dere wit' her knittin'--     Yass, of course I know she 's changin' since de day she marry me--   An' she 'll never sit no more dere on de fence lak leetle kitten--     She 'd be safer on a stone wall, but she 's still ma Rosalie.    All alone: de neares' shaintee, over ten mile down de reever--     An' might be only yesterday, I 'member it so well--   W'en I 'm comin' home wan morning affer trappin' on de beaver,     An' ma wife is sayin', \"Hurry, go an' fetch Ma-dame Labelle.\"    If you 're stan'in' on de bank dere, you mus' t'ink I 'm crazy feller     By de way I work de paddle, an' de way canoe she go--   But Ma-dame know all about it, an' I never need to tell her,     An' we jus' get back in tam' dere for welcome leetle Joe.    Dat 's de way dem woman 's doin' for help along each oder,     For Pierre Labelle he 's comin' now an' den for Rosalie--   Of course dere 's many tam too, dey got to be godmoder--     An' w'en dey want godfader, w'y dere 's only Pierre an' me.    Twenty year so hard we 're workin', twenty year reapin', sowin',     Choppin' tree an' makin' portage, an' de chil'ren help us too--   But it 's never feelin' lonesome w'ile de familee is growin',     An' de cradle seldom empty, an' we got so moche to do.    Den w'en all de work is finish, w'at dey 're callin' de surveyor     He 's comin' here an' fin' us, an' of course so well he might--   For it 's easy job to foller, w'en de road is lyin' dere,     So blin' man he can walk it wit' hees eyes closed, darkes' night.    An' de nex' t'ing dere 's a township, an' de township bring de taxes,     An' it 's leetle hard on us too, dat 's way it seem to me--   An' de Gover'ment, I s'pose dey 'll never t'ink at all to ax us     For de small account dey 're owin' mese'f an' Rosalie.    So we 'll see de beeg procession very soon come up de reever--     Some will settle on de roadside, some will stay upon de shore--   But de ole place we be clearin', I don't t'ink we 'll never leave her,     Dough we 're all surroun' by stranger an' we 're           in de worl' wance more.     [Illustration: Border]  Natural Philosophy    Very offen I be t'inkin' of de queer folk goin' roun',     And way dey kip a-talkin' of de hard tam get along--   May have plaintee money too, an' de healt' be good an' soun'--     But you 'll fin' dere 's alway somet'ing goin' wrong--   'Course dere may be many reason w'y some feller ought to fret--     But me, I 'm alway singin' de only song I know--   'T is n't long enough for music, an' so short you can't forget,     But it drive away de lonesome, an' dis is how she go,       \"Jus' tak' your chance, an' try your luck.\"    Funny feller 's w'at dey call me--\"so diff'ren' from de res',\"     But ev'rybody got hees fault, as far as I can see--   An' all de t'ing I 'm doin', I do it for de bes',     Dough w'en I 'm bettin' on a race, dat 's often loss for me--   \"Oho!\" I say, \"Alphonse ma frien', to-day is not your day,     For more you got your money up, de less your trotter go--   But never min' an' don't lie down,\" dat 's w'at I alway say,     An' sing de sam' ole song some more, mebbe a leetle slow--       \"Jus' tak' your chance, an' try your luck.\"    S'pose ma uncle die an' let me honder-dollar, mebbe two--     An' I don't tak' hees advice--me--for put heem on de bank--   'Stead o' dat, some lot'rie ticket, to see w'at I can do,     An' purty soon I 'm findin' out dey 're w'at you call de blank--   Wall! de bank she might bus' up dere--somet'ing might go wrong--     Dem feller, w'en dey get it, mebbe skip before de night--   Can't tell--den w'ere 's your money?  So I sing ma leetle song     An' don't boder wit' de w'isky, an' again I feel all right,       \"Jus' tak' your chance, an' try your luck.\"    If you 're goin' to mak' de marry, kip a look out on de eye,     But no matter how you 're careful, it was risky anyhow--   An' if you 're too unlucky, jus' remember how you try     For gettin' dat poor woman, dough she may have got you now--   All de sam', it sometam happen dat your wife will pass away--     No use cryin', you can't help it--dere 's your duty to you'se'f--   You don't need to ax de neighbor, dey will tell you ev'ry day     Start again lak hones' feller, for dere's plaintee woman lef'--       \"Jus' tak' your chance, an' try your luck.\"    Poor man lak me, I 'm not'ing: only w'en election 's dere,     An' ev'rybody 's waitin' to ketch you by de t'roat--   De money I be makin' den, wall! dat was mon affaire--     An' affer all w'at diff'rence how de poor man mak' de vote?   So I do ma very bes'--me--wit' de wife an' familee--     On de church door Sunday morning, you can see us all parade--   Len' a frien' a half a dollar, an' never go on spree--     So w'en I 'm comin' die--me--no use to be afraid--       \"Jus' tak' your chance, an' try your luck.\"     [Illustration: Border]  Champlain    \"W'ere 'll we go?\" says Pierre de Monts,[1]     To hese'f as he walk de forwar' deck,   \"For I got ma share of Trois Rivières     An' I never can lak Kebeck--   Too moche Nort' Pole--maudit! it 's cole     Oh! la! la! de win' blow too.

De Spanish da-go he was gettin' mad,     An' he 's dangerous l'Espagnol!   An' ev'ry wan say it was lookin' bad,     Not safe on de State at all--   So Yankee he 's tryin' for sell hees farm,     An' town 's very moche excite,   Feexin' de gun an' de fire-alarm,     An' ban' playin' ev'ry night.    An' soon dere 's comin', all dress to kill,     Beeg feller from far away,   Shoutin' lak devil on top de hill,     An' dis is de t'ing he say--    \"Strike for your home an' your own contree!

I got a long story for tell dat night     On poor leetle Rose Elmire,   An' she say she 's sorry about de fight     We 're doin' so well down here--   But it 's not our fault an' we can't help dat,     De law she is made for all,   So our duty is wait for de rat-tat-tat     Of drum an' de bugle call.    An' it 's busy week for Elmire an' me,     I 'm sure you 'd pity us too--   Workin' so hard lak you never see,     For dere 's plaintee o' job to do--   Den half o' de night packin' up de stuff     We got on de small cabane--   An' buyin' a horse, dough he cos' enough,     For Yankee 's a hard trade man.    An' how can I sleep if ma wife yell out--     \"Gédéon, dere she goes!\"   An' bang an' tear all de house about     W'en Johnnie is blow hees nose?   Poor leetle chil'ren dey suffer too,     Lyin' upon de floor,   Wit' de bed made up, for dey never go     On de worl' lak dat before.    We got to be ready, of course, an' wait--     De chil'ren, de wife, an' me,   For show de Yankee upon de State,     Ba Golly! how smart we be.   You know de game dey call checker-boar'?

An' I t'ink of de tam I be leevin' dere     On county of Yamachiche,   De swamp on de bush w'ere I ketch de hare     De reever I use to feesh.    An' ma wife Elmire w'en she see de tear,     She cry leetle bit herse'f--   Put her han' on ma neck, an' say, \"Ma dear,     I 'm sorry we never lef';   But money 's good t'ing, an' dere 's nice folk too,     Leevin' upon Vermont--   Got plaintee o' work for me an' you--     Is dere anyt'ing more we want?
