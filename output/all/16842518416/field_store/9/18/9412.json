The Lady Clare rejected Lord Marmion’s suit, and took refuge from him in the convent of St. Hilda, in Whitby. Constance took the veil in the convent of St. Cuthbert, in Holy Isle, but after a time left the convent clandestinely, was captured, taken back, and buried alive in the walls of a deep cell. In the mean time, Lord Marmion, being sent by Henry VIII. on an embassy to James IV. of Scotland, stopped at the hall of Sir Hugh de Heron, who sent a palmer as his guide. On his return, Lord Marmion commanded the abbess of St. Hilda to release the Lady Clare, and place her under the charge of her kinsman, Fitzclare of Tantallon Hall. Here she met the palmer, who was Ralph de Wilton, and as Lord Marmion was slain in the battle of Flodden Field, she was free to marry the man she loved.--Sir W. Scott, _Marmion_ (1808).  _Marmion_ (_Lord_), a descendant of Robert de Marmion, who obtained from William the Conqueror, the manor of Scrivelby, in Lincolnshire. This Robert de Marmion was the first royal champion of England, and the office remained in the family till the reign of Edward I., when in default of male issue it passed to John Dymoke, son-in-law of Philip Marmion, in whose family it remains still.   =Marnally= (_Bernard_). Good-looking Irish tutor at “Happy-go-Lucky,” a country house. He is accused of murdering the infant children of a young widow with whom he is in love, but is acquitted and goes back to Ireland. Some years later, he revisits America, meets his old love and marries her.--Miriam Coles Harris, _Happy-go-Lucky_ (1881).   =Marner= (_Silas_). Miser and misogynist in humble life, who finds a baby-girl in his cottage one night, and in bringing her up, learns to have patience with life and charity with his kind.--George Eliot, _Silas Marner_.   =Ma´ro=, Virgil, whose full name was Publius Virgilius Maro (B.C. 70-19).      Oh, were it mine with the sacred Maro’s art     To wake to sympathy the feeling heart,     Like him the smooth and mournful verse to dress     In all the pomp of exquisite distress ...     Then might I ...      Falconer, _The Shipwreck_, iii. 5 (1756).   =Mar´onites= (3 _syl._), a religious semi-Catholic sect of Syria, constantly at war with their near neighbors, the Druses, a semi-Mohammedan sect. Both are now tributaries of the sultan, but enjoy their own laws. The Maronites number about 400,000, and the Druses about half that number. The Maronites owe their name to J. Maron, their founder; the Druses to Durzi, who led them out of Egypt into Syria. The patriarch of the Maronites resides at Kanobin; the hakem of the Druses at Deir-el-kamar. The Maronites, or “Catholics of Lebanon,” differ from the Roman Catholics in several points, and have a pope or patriarch of their own. In 1860 the Druses made on them a horrible onslaught, which called forth the intervention of Europe.   =Marotte= (2 _syl._), a footman of Gorgibus; a plain bourgeois, who hates affectation. When the fine ladies of the house try to convert him into a fashionable flunky, and teach him a little grandiloquence, he bluntly tells them he does not understand Latin.       _Marotte._ Voilà un laquais qui demande si vous êtes au logis, et      dit que son maître, vous venir voir.       _Madelon._ Apprenez, sotte, à vous énoncer moins vulgaiment. Dites:      Voilà un nécessaire que demande si vous êtes en commodité d’etre      visibles.       _Marotte._ Je n’entends point le Latin.--Molière, _Les Précieuses      Ridicules_, vii. (1659).   =Marphi´sa=, sister of Roge´ro, and a female knight of amazing prowess. She was brought up by a magician, but being stolen at the age of seven, was sold to the king of Persia. When she was 18, her royal master assailed her honor; but she slew him, and usurped the crown. Marphisa went to Gaul to join the army of Agramant, but subsequently entered the camp of Charlemagne, and was baptized.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).   =Marphu´rius=, a doctor of the Pyrrhonian school. Sganarelle consults him about his marriage; but the philosopher replies, “Perhaps; it is possible; it may be so; everything is doubtful;” till at last Sganarelle beats him, and Marphurius says he shall bring an action against him for battery. “Perhaps,” replies Sganarelle; “it is possible; it may be so,” etc., using the very words of the philosopher (sc. ix.).--Molière, _Le Mariage Forcé_ (1664).   =Marplot=, “the busy body.” A blundering, good-natured, meddlesome young man, very inquisitive, too officious by half, and always bungling whatever he interferes in. Marplot is introduced by Mrs. Centlivre in two comedies, _The Busy Body_ and _Marplot in Lisbon_.       That unlucky dog Marplot ... is ever doing mischief, and yet (to      give him his due) he never designs it. This is some blundering      adventure, wherein he thought to show his friendship, as he calls      it.--Mrs. Centlivre, _The Busy Body_, iii. 5 (1709).  ⁂ This was Henry Woodward’s great part (1717-1777). His unappeasable curiosity, his slow comprehension, his annihilation under the sense of his dilemmas, were so diverting, that even Garrick confessed him the decided “Marplot” of the stage.--Boaden, _Life of Siddons_.  N. B.--William Cavendish, duke of Newcastle, brought out a free tranlation[TN-2] of Molière’s _L’Etourdi_, which he entitled _Marplot_.   =Marquis de Basqueville=, being one night at the opera, was told by a messenger that his mansion was on fire. “Eh bien,” he said to the messenger, “adressez-vous à Mme. la marquise qui est en face dans cette loge; car c’est affaire de ménage.”--Chapus, _Dieppe et ses Environs_ (1853).   =Marrall= (_Jack_), a mean-spirited, revengeful time-server. He is the clerk and tool of Sir Giles Overreach. When Marrall thinks Wellborn penniless, he treats him like a dog; but as soon as he fancies he is about to marry the wealthy dowager, Lady Allworth, he is most servile, and offers to lend him money. Marrall now plays the traitor to his master, Sir Giles, and reveals to Wellborn the scurvy tricks by which he has been cheated of his estates. When, however, he asks Wellborn to take him into his service, Wellborn replies, “He who is false to one master will betray another;” and will have nothing to say to him.--Massinger, _A New Way to Pay Old Debts_ (1628).   =Married Men of Genius.= The number of men of genius unhappy in their wives is very large. The following are notorious examples:--Socratês and Xantippê; Saadi, the Persian poet; Dantê and Gemma Donati; Milton, with Mary Powell; Marlborough and Sarah Jennings; Gustavus Adolphus and his flighty queen; Byron and Miss Milbanke; Dickens and Miss Hogarth; etc. Every reader will be able to add to the list.   =Mars=, divine Fortitude personified. Bacchus is the tutelary demon of the Mahommedans, and Mars the guardian potentate of the Christians.--Camoens, _The Lusiad_ (1569).  _That Young Mars of Men_, Edward the Black prince, who with 8,000 men defeated, at Poitiers, the French king, John, whose army amounted to 60,000--some say even more (A. D. 1356).[TN-3]  _The Mars of Men_, Henry Plantagenet, earl of Derby, third son of Henry, earl of Lancaster, and near kinsman of Edward III. (See DERBY.)   =Marse’ Chan.= Brave Virginian soldier whose lady-love enacts “My Lady Disdain” until news is brought her that he has fallen in battle. Then she grieves for him as a widow for her husband, and when she dies, she is buried by him.--Thomas Nelson Page, _In Ole Virginia_ (1887).   =Mars of Portugal= (_The_), Alfonso de Albuquerque, viceroy of India (1452-1515).   =Mars Wounded.= A very remarkable parallel to the encounter of Diŏmed and Mars in the _Iliad_, v., occurs in Ossian. Homer says that Diomed hurled his spear against Mars, which, piercing the belt, wounded the war-god in the bowels; “Loud bellowed Mars, nine thousand men, ten thousand, scarce so loud, joining fierce battle.” Then Mars ascending, wrapped in clouds, was borne upwards to Olympus.  Ossian, in _Carrick-Thura_, says that Loda, the god of his foes, came like a “blast from the mountain. He came in his terror and shook his dusky spear. His eyes were flames, and his voice like distant thunder. ‘Son of night,’ said Fingal, ‘retire. Do I fear thy gloomy form, spirit of dismal Loda? Weak is thy shield of cloud, feeble thy meteor sword.’”[TN-4] Then cleft he the gloomy shadow with his sword. It fell like a column of smoke. It shrieked. Then rolling itself up, the wounded spirit rose on the wind, and the island shook to its foundation.”   =Marseilles’ Good Bishop=, Henri François Xavier de Belsunce (1671-1775). Immortalized by his philanthropic diligence in the plague at Marseilles (1720-1722).  Charles Borromēo, archbishop of Milan a century previously (1576), was equally diligent and self-sacrificing in the plague of Milan (1538-1584).  Sir John Lawrence, lord mayor of London during the great plague, supported 40,000 dismissed servants, and deserves immortal honor.  Darwin refers to Belsunce and Lawrence in his _Loves of the Plants_, ii. 433.   =Marshal Forwards=, Blücher; so called for his dash in battle, and the rapidity of his movements, in the campaign of 1813 (1742-1819).   =Marsi=, a part of the Sabellian race, noted for Magic, and said to have been descended from Circê.       Marsis vi quadam genitali datum, ut serpentium virulentorum      domitores sint, et incantationibus herbarumque succis faciant      medelarum mira.--_Gellius_, xvi. 11.   =Marsig´lio=, a Saracen king, who plotted the attack upon Roland, “under the tree on which Judas hanged himself.” With a force of 600,000 men, divided into three companies, Marsiglio attacked the paladin in Roncesvallês and overthrew him; but Charlemagne, coming up, routed the Saracen, and hanged him on the very tree under which he planned the attack.--Turpin, _Chronicle_ (1122).   =Marsilia=, “who bears up great Cynthia’s train,” is the marchioness of Northampton, to whom Spenser dedicated his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20851"],["title","Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 3 (#2)"],["body","Daphnaida_. This lady was Helena, daughter of Wolfgangus Swavenburgh, a Swede.      No less praiseworthy is Marsilia,     Best known by bearing up great Cynthia’s train.     She is the pattern of true womanhead....     Worthy next after Cynthia [_queen Elizabeth_] to tread,     As she is next her in nobility.

He challenged Apollo to a contest of skill, but being beaten by the god, was flayed alive for his presumption.   =Mar´tafax and Ler´mites= (3 _syl._), two famous rats brought up before the White Cat for treason, but acquitted.--Comtesse D’Aunoy, _Fairy Tales_ (“The White Cat,” 1682).   =Marta´no=, a great coward, who stole the armor of Gryphon, and presented himself in it before King Norandi´no. Having received the honors due to the owner, Martano quitted Damascus with Origilla; but Aquilant unmasked the villain, and he was hanged (bks. viii., ix.).--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).   =Marteau des Heretiques=, Pierre d’Ailly; also called _L’Aigle de la France_ (1350-1420).   =Martel= (_Charles_), Charles, natural son of Pépin d’Héristal.  M. Collin de Plancy says that this “palace mayor” of France was not called “Martel” because he _martelé_ (“hammered”) the Saracens under Abd-el-Rahman in 732, but because his patron saint was _Martellus_ (or _St. Martin_).--_Bibliothèque des Légendes._  Thomas Delf, in his translation of Chevreuil’s _Principles of Harmony, etc., of Colors_ (1847), signs himself “Charles Martel.”   =Martext= (_Sir Oliver_), a vicar in Shakespeare’s comedy of _As You Like It_ (1600).   =Martha:=      “Yea, Lord! Yet man must earn      And woman bake the bread;      And some must watch and wake      Early for other’s sake      Who pray instead.”      Julia C. R.

She married Carlos, but as he married under a false name, the marriage was illegal, and when Carlos was given up to the hands of justice, Orgarita was placed under the charge of her grandmother, Mde. de Théringe, and [probably] espoused Horace de Brienne.--E.

Scott, _Anne of Geierstein_ (time, Edward IV.).  _Marthon, alias_ RIZPAH, a Bohemian woman, attendant on the Countess Hameline of Croye.--Sir W. Scott, _Quentin Durward_ (time, Edward IV.).   =Martian Laws= (not _Mercian_ as Wharton gives it in his _Law Dictionary_) are the laws collected by Martia, the wife of Guithelin, great grand-son of Mulmutius, who established in Britain the “Mulmutian Laws” (_q.v._). Alfred translated both these codes into Saxon-English, and called the Martian code _Pa Marchitle Lage_.
