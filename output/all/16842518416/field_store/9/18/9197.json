AN INQUIRY INTO  THE NATURE OF PEACE  AND  THE TERMS OF ITS PERPETUATION  BY  THORSTEIN VEBLEN   New York B.W. HUEBSCH 1919  _All rights reserved_     COPYRIGHT, 1917. BY THE MACMILLAN COMPANY.  Published April, 1917: Reprinted August, 1917.  New edition published by B.W. HUEBSCH. January, 1919.     PREFACE   It is now some 122 years since Kant wrote the essay, _Zum ewigen Frieden_. Many things have happened since then, although the Peace to which he looked forward with a doubtful hope has not been among them. But many things have happened which the great critical philosopher, and no less critical spectator of human events, would have seen with interest. To Kant the quest of an enduring peace presented itself as an intrinsic human duty, rather than as a promising enterprise. Yet through all his analysis of its premises and of the terms on which it may be realised there runs a tenacious persuasion that, in the end, the régime of peace at large will be installed. Not as a deliberate achievement of human wisdom, so much as a work of Nature the Designer of things--_Natura daedala rerum_.  To any attentive reader of Kant's memorable essay it will be apparent that the title of the following inquiry--On the nature of peace and the terms of its perpetuation--is a descriptive translation of the caption under which he wrote. That such should be the case will not, it is hoped, be accounted either an unseemly presumption or an undue inclination to work under a borrowed light. The aim and compass of any disinterested inquiry in these premises is still the same as it was in Kant's time; such, indeed, as he in great part made it,--viz., a systematic knowledge of things as they are. Nor is the light of Kant's leading to be dispensed with as touches the ways and means of systematic knowledge, wherever the human realities are in question.  Meantime, many things have also changed since the date of Kant's essay. Among other changes are those that affect the direction of inquiry and the terms of systematic formulation. _Natura daedala rerum_ is no longer allowed to go on her own recognizances, without divulging the ways and means of her workmanship. And it is such a line of extension that is here attempted, into a field of inquiry which in Kant's time still lay over the horizon of the future.  The quest of perpetual peace at large is no less a paramount and intrinsic human duty today than it was, nor is it at all certain that its final accomplishment is nearer. But the question of its pursuit and of the conditions to be met in seeking this goal lies in a different shape today; and it is this question that concerns the inquiry which is here undertaken,--What are the terms on which peace at large may hopefully be installed and maintained? What, if anything, is there in the present situation that visibly makes for a realisation of these necessary terms within the calculable future? And what are the consequences presumably due to follow in the nearer future from the installation of such a peace at large? And the answer to these questions is here sought not in terms of what ought dutifully to be done toward the desired consummation, but rather in terms of those known factors of human behaviour that can be shown by analysis of experience to control the conduct of nations in conjunctures of this kind.

CHAPTER II  ON THE NATURE AND USES OF PATRIOTISM                                31  The nature of Patriotism, 31.  --Is a spirit of Emulation, 33.  --Must seem moral, if only to a biased populace, 33.  --The common man is sufficiently patriotic but is hampered with a sense of right and honest dealing, 38.  --Patriotism is at cross purposes with modern life, 38.  --Is an hereditary trait? 41.  --Variety of racial stocks in Europe, 43.  --Patriotism a ubiquitous trait, 43.  --Patriotism disserviceable, yet men hold to it, 46.  --Cultural evolution of Europeans, 48.  --Growth of a sense of group solidarity, 49.  --Material interests of group falling into abeyance as class divisions have grown up, until prestige remains virtually the sole community interest, 51.  --Based upon warlike prowess, physical magnitude and pecuniary traffic of country, 54.  --Interests of the master class are at cross purposes with the fortunes of the common man, 57.  --Value of superiors is a \"prestige value,\" 57.  --The material benefits which this ruling class contribute are: defense against aggression, and promotion of the community's material gain, 60.  --The common defense is a remedy for evils due to the patriotic spirit, 61.  --The common defense the usual blind behind which events are put in train for eventual hostilities, 62.  --All the nations of warring Europe convinced that they are fighting a defensive war, 62.  --Which usually takes the form of a defense of the National Honour, 63.  --Material welfare is of interest to the Dynastic statesman only as it conduces to political success, 64.  --The policy of national economic self-sufficiency, 67.  --The chief material use of patriotism is its use to a limited number of persons in their quest of private gain, 67.  --And has the effect of dividing the nations on lines of rivalry, 76.   CHAPTER III  ON THE CONDITIONS OF A LASTING PEACE                                77  The patriotic spirit of modern peoples is the abiding source of contention among nations, 77.  --Hence any calculus of the Chances of Peace will be a reckoning of forces which may be counted on to keep a patriotic nation in an unstable equilibrium of peace, 78.  --The question of peace and war at large is a question of peace and war among the Powers, which are of two contrasted kinds: those which may safely be counted on spontaneously to take the offensive and those which will fight on provocation, 79.  --War not a question of equity but of opportunity, 81.  --The Imperial designs of Germany and Japan as the prospective cause of war, 82.  --Peace can be maintained in two ways: submission to their dominion, or elimination of these two Powers; No middle course open, 84.  --Frame of mind of states; men and popular sentiment in a Dynastic State, 84.  --Information, persuasion and reflection will not subdue national animosities and jealousies; Peoples of Europe are racially homogeneous along lines of climatic latitude, 88.  --But loyalty is a matter of habituation, 89.  --Derivation and current state of German nationalism, 94.  --Contrasted with the animus of the citizens of a commonwealth, 103;--A neutral peace-compact may be practicable in the absence of Germany and Japan, but it has no chance in their presence, 106.  --The national life of Germany: the Intellectuals, 108.  --Summary of chapter, 116.   CHAPTER IV  PEACE WITHOUT HONOUR                                               118  Submission to the Imperial Power one of the conditions precedent to a peaceful settlement, 118.  --Character of the projected tutelage, 118.  --Life under the _Pax Germanica_ contrasted with the Ottoman and Russian rule, 124.  --China and biological and cultural success, 130.  --Difficulty of non-resistant subjection is of a psychological order, 131.  --Patriotism of the bellicose kind is of the nature of habit, 134.  --And men may divest themselves of it, 140.  --A decay of the bellicose national spirit must be of the negative order, the disuse of the discipline out of which it has arisen, 142.  --Submission to Imperial authorities necessitates abeyance of national pride among the other peoples, 144.  --Pecuniary merits of the projected Imperial dominion, 145.  --Pecuniary class distinctions in the commonwealths and the pecuniary burden on the common man, 150.  --Material conditions of life for the common man under the modern rule of big business, 156.  --The competitive régime, \"what the traffic will bear,\" and the life and labor of the common man, 158.  --Industrial sabotage by businessmen, 165.  --Contrasted with the Imperial usufruct and its material advantages to the common man, 174.

AN INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF PEACE AND THE TERMS OF ITS PERPETUATION     ON THE NATURE OF PEACE AND THE TERMS OF ITS PERPETUATION     CHAPTER I  INTRODUCTORY: ON THE STATE AND ITS RELATION TO WAR AND PEACE   To many thoughtful men ripe in worldly wisdom it is known of a verity that war belongs indefeasibly in the Order of Nature. Contention, with manslaughter, is indispensable in human intercourse, at the same time that it conduces to the increase and diffusion of the manly virtues. So likewise, the unspoiled youth of the race, in the period of adolescence and aspiring manhood, also commonly share this gift of insight and back it with a generous commendation of all the martial qualities; and women of nubile age and no undue maturity gladly meet them half way.  On the other hand, the mothers of the people are commonly unable to see the use of it all. It seems a waste of dear-bought human life, with a large sum of nothing to show for it. So also many men of an elderly turn, prematurely or otherwise, are ready to lend their countenance to the like disparaging appraisal; it may be that the spirit of prowess in them runs at too low a tension, or they may have outlived the more vivid appreciation of the spiritual values involved. There are many, also, with a turn for exhortation, who find employment for their best faculties in attesting the well-known atrocities and futility of war.  Indeed, not infrequently such advocates of peace will devote their otherwise idle powers to this work of exhortation without stipend or subsidy. And they uniformly make good their contention that the currently accepted conception of the nature of war--General Sherman's formula--is substantially correct. All the while it is to be admitted that all this axiomatic exhortation has no visible effect on the course of events or on the popular temper touching warlike enterprise. Indeed, no equal volume of speech can be more incontrovertible or less convincing than the utterances of the peace advocates, whether subsidised or not. \"War is Bloodier than Peace.\" This would doubtless be conceded without argument, but also without prejudice. Hitherto the pacifists' quest of a basis for enduring peace, it must be admitted, has brought home nothing tangible--with the qualification, of course, that the subsidised pacifists have come in for the subsidy. So that, after searching the recesses of their imagination, able-bodied pacifists whose loquacity has never been at fault hitherto have been brought to ask: \"What Shall We Say?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Under these circumstances it will not be out of place to inquire into the nature of this peace about which swings this wide orbit of opinion and argument. At the most, such an inquiry can be no more gratuitous and no more nugatory than the controversies that provoke it. The intrinsic merits of peace at large, as against those of warlike enterprise, it should be said, do not here come in question. That question lies in the domain of preconceived opinion, so that for the purposes of this inquiry it will have no significance except as a matter to be inquired into; the main point of the inquiry being the nature, causes and consequences of such a preconception favoring peace, and the circumstances that make for a contrary preconception in favor of war.  By and large, any breach of the peace in modern times is an official act and can be taken only on initiative of the governmental establishment, the State. The national authorities may, of course, be driven to take such a step by pressure of warlike popular sentiment. Such, e.g., is presumed to have been the case in the United States' attack on Spain during the McKinley administration; but the more that comes to light of the intimate history of that episode, the more evident does it become that the popular war sentiment to which the administration yielded had been somewhat sedulously \"mobilised\" with a view to such yielding and such a breach. So also in the case of the Boer war, the move was made under sanction of a popular war spirit, which, again, did not come to a head without shrewd surveillance and direction. And so again in the current European war, in the case, e.g., of Germany, where the initiative was taken, the State plainly had the full support of popular sentiment, and may even be said to have precipitated the war in response to this urgent popular aspiration; and here again it is a matter of notoriety that the popular sentiment had long been sedulously nursed and \"mobilised\" to that effect, so that the populace was assiduously kept in spiritual readiness for such an event. The like is less evident as regards the United Kingdom, and perhaps also as regards the other Allies.  And such appears to have been the common run of the facts as regards all the greater wars of the last one hundred years,--what may be called the \"public\" wars of this modern era, as contrasted with the \"private\" or administrative wars which have been carried on in a corner by one and another of the Great Powers against hapless barbarians, from time to time, in the course of administrative routine.  It is also evident from the run of the facts as exemplified in these modern wars that while any breach of the peace takes place only on the initiative and at the discretion of the government, or State,[1] it is always requisite in furtherance of such warlike enterprise to cherish and eventually to mobilise popular sentiment in support of any warlike move. Due fomentation of a warlike animus is indispensable to the procuring and maintenance of a suitable equipment with which eventually to break the peace, as well as to ensure a diligent prosecution of such enterprise when once it has been undertaken. Such a spirit of militant patriotism as may serviceably be mobilised in support of warlike enterprise has accordingly been a condition precedent to any people's entry into the modern Concert of Nations. This Concert of Nations is a Concert of Powers, and it is only as a Power that any nation plays its part in the concert, all the while that \"power\" here means eventual warlike force.  [Footnote 1: A modern nation constitutes a State only in respect of or with ulterior bearing on the question of International peace or war.]  Such a people as the Chinese, e.g., not pervaded with an adequate patriotic spirit, comes into the Concert of Nations not as a Power but as a bone of contention. Not that the Chinese fall short in any of the qualities that conduce to efficiency and"]]]
