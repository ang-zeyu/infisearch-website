And light-speed had been constant, regardless of distance from source, and the Universe, to explain certain observed phenomena, had been believed to be expanding simultaneously in all directions. And the things that had happened in psychology, when psi-phenomena had become too obvious to be shrugged away.  \"And then, when Dr. Dandrik ordered you to drop this experiment, just when it was becoming interesting, you refused?\"  \"Your Majesty, I couldn't stop, not then. But Dr. Dandrik ordered the apparatus dismantled and scrapped, and I'm afraid I lost my head. Told him I'd punch his silly old face in, for one thing.\"  \"You admit that?\" Chancellor Khane cried.  \"I think you showed admirable self-restraint in not doing it. Did you explain to Chancellor Khane the importance of this experiment?\"  \"I tried to, Your Majesty, but he simply wouldn't listen.\"  \"But, Your Majesty!\" Khane expostulated. \"Professor Dandrik is head of the department, and one of the foremost physicists of the Empire, and this young man is only one of the junior assistant-professors. Isn't even a full professor, and he got his degree from some school away off-planet. University of Brannerton on Gimli.\"  \"Were you a pupil of Professor Vann Evaratt?\" Prince Travann asked sharply.  \"Why, yes, sir. I----\"  \"Ha, no wonder!\" Dandrik crowed. \"Your Majesty, that man's an out-and-out charlatan! He was kicked out of the University here ten years ago, and I'm surprised he could even get on the faculty of a school like Brannerton, on a planet like Gimli.\"  \"Why, you stupid old fool!\" Faress yelled at him. \"You aren't enough of a physicist to oil robots in Vann Evaratt's lab!\"  \"There, Your Majesty,\" Khane said. \"You see how much respect for authority this hooligan has!\"  On Aditya, such would be unthinkable; on Aditya, everybody respects authority. Whether it's respectable or not.  Count Tammsan laughed, and he realized that he must have spoken aloud. Nobody else seemed to have gotten the joke.  \"Well, how about the riot, now?\" he asked. \"Who started that?\"  \"Colonel Handrosan made an investigation on the spot,\" Prince Travann said. \"May I suggest that we hear his report?\"  \"Yes indeed. Colonel?\"  Handrosan rose and stood with his hands behind his back, looking fixedly at the wall behind the desk.  [Illustration]  \"Your Majesty, the students of Professor Faress' advanced subnuclear physics class, postgraduate students, all of them, were told of Professor Faress' dismissal by a faculty member who had taken over the class this morning. They all got up and walked out in a body, and gathered outdoors on the campus to discuss the matter. At the next class break, they were joined by other science students, and they went into the stadium, where they were joined, half an hour later, by more students who had learned of the dismissal in the meantime. At no time was the gathering disorderly. The stadium is covered by a viewscreen pickup which is fitted with a recording device; there is a complete audio-visual of the whole thing, including the attack on them by the campus police.  \"This attack was ordered by Chancellor Khane, at about 1100; the chief of the campus police was told to clear the stadium, and when he asked if he was to use force, Chancellor Khane told him to use anything he wanted to.\"  \"I did not! I told him to get the students out of the stadium, but----\"  \"The chief of campus police carries a personal wire recorder,\" Handrosan said, in his flat monotone. \"He has a recording of the order, in Chancellor Khane's own voice. I heard it myself. The police,\" he continued, \"first tried to use gas, but the wind was against them. They then tried to use sono-stunners, but the students rushed them and overwhelmed them. If Your Majesty will permit a personal opinion, while I do not sympathize with their subsequent attack on the Administration Center, they were entirely within their rights in defending themselves in the stadium, and it's hard enough to stop trained and disciplined troops when they are winning. After defeating the police, they simply went on by what might be called the momentum of victory.\"  \"Then you'd say that it's positively established that the students were behaving in a peacable and orderly manner in the stadium when they were attacked, and that Chancellor Khane ordered the attack personally?\"  \"I would, emphatically, Your Majesty.\"  \"I think we've done enough here, gentlemen.\" He turned to Count Tammsan. \"This is, jointly, the affair of Education and Security. I would suggest that you and Prince Travann join in a formal and public inquiry, and until all the facts have been established and recorded and action decided upon, the dismissal of Professor Faress be reversed and he be restored to his position on the faculty.\"  \"Yes, Your Majesty,\" Tammsan agreed. \"And I think it would be a good idea for Chancellor Khane to take a vacation till then, too.\"  \"I would further suggest that, as this microposito experiment is crucial to the whole question, it should be repeated. Under the personal direction of Professor Faress.\"  \"I agree with that, Your Majesty,\" Prince Travann said. \"If it's as important as I think it is, Professor Dandrik is greatly to be censured for ordering it stopped and for failing to report this anticipation effect.\"  \"We'll consult about the inquiry, including the experiment, tomorrow, Your Highness,\" Tammsan told Travann.  Paul rose, and everybody rose with him. \"That being the case, you gentlemen are all excused. The students' procession ought to be arriving, now, and I want to tell them what's going to be done. Prince Travann, Count Tammsan; do you care to accompany me?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Going up to the central terrace in front of the Octagon Tower, he turned to Count Tammsan.  \"I notice you laughed at that remark of mine about Aditya,\" he said. \"Have you met the First Citizen?\"  \"Only on screen, sir. He was at me for about an hour, this morning. It seems that they are reforming the educational system on Aditya. On Aditya, everything gets reformed every ten years, whether it needs it or not. He came here to find somebody to take charge of the reformation.\"  He stopped short, bringing the others to a halt beside him, and laughed heartily.  \"Well, we'll send First Citizen Yaggo away happy; we'll make him a present of the most distinguished educator on Odin.\"  \"Khane?\" Tammsan asked.  \"Khane. Isn't it wonderful; if you have a few problems, you have trouble, but if you have a whole lot of problems, they start solving each other. We get a chance to get rid of Khane and create a vacancy that can be filled by somebody big enough to fill it; the Ministry of Education gets out from under a nasty situation; First Citizen Yaggo gets what he thinks he wants----\"  \"And if I know Khane and if I know the People's Commonwealth of Aditya, it won't be a year before Yaggo has Khane shot or stuffs him into jail, and then the Space Navy will have an excuse to visit Aditya, and Aditya'll never be the same afterward,\" Prince Travann added.  The students massed on the front lawns were still cheering as they went down after addressing them. The Security Guards were conspicuously absent and it was a detail of red-kilted Thoran riflemen who met them as they entered the hall to the Session Chamber. Prince Ganzay approached, attended by two Household Guard officers, a human and a Thoran. Count Tammsan looked from one to the other of his companions, bewildered. The bewildering thing was that everything was as it should be.  \"Well, gentlemen,\" Paul said, \"I'm sure that both of you will want to confer for a moment with your colleagues in the Rotunda before the Session. Please don't feel obliged to attend me further.\"  Prince Ganzay approached as they went down the hall. \"Your Majesty, what _is_ going on here?\" he demanded querulously. \"Just who is in control of the Palace--you or Prince Travann? And where is His Imperial Highness, and where is General Dorflay?\"  \"I sent Dorflay to join Prince Rodrik's picnic party. If you're upset about this, you can imagine what he might have done here.\"  Prince Ganzay looked at him curiously for a moment. \"I thought I understood what was happening,\" he said. \"Now I---- This business about the students, sir; how did it come out?\"  Paul told him. They talked for a while, and then the Prime Minister looked at his watch, and suggested that the Session ought to be getting started. Paul nodded, and they went down the hall and into the Rotunda.  The big semicircular lobby was empty, now, except for a platoon of Household Guards, and the Empress Marris and her ladies-in-waiting. She advanced as quickly as her sheath gown would permit, and took his arm; the ladies-in-waiting fell in behind her, and Prince Ganzay went ahead, crying: \"My Lords, Your Venerable Highnesses, gentlemen; His Imperial Majesty!\"  Marris tightened her grip on his arm as they started forward. \"Paul!\" she hissed into his ear. \"What is this silly story about Yorn Travann trying to seize the Throne?\"  \"Isn't it? Yorn's been too close the Throne for too long not to know what sort of a seat it is. He'd commit any crime up to and including genocide to keep off it.\"  She gave a quick skip to get into step with him. \"Then why's he filled the Palace with these blackcoats? Is Rod all right?\"  \"Perfectly all right; he's somewhere out in the mountains, keeping Harv Dorflay out of mischief.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They crossed the Session Hall and took their seats on the double throne; everybody sat down, and the Prime Minister, after some formalities, declared the Plenary Session in being. Almost at once, one of the Prince-Counselors was on his feet begging His Majesty's leave to interrogate the Government.  \"I wish to ask His Highness the Minister of Security the meaning of all this unprecedented disturbance, both here in the Palace and in the city,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20659"],["title","Ministry of Disturbance (#8)"],["body","said.  Prince Travann rose at once. \"Your Majesty, in reply to the question of His Venerable Highness,\" he began, and then launched himself into an account of the student riot, the march to petition the emperor, and the clash with the nonworking class hooligans. \"As to the affair at the University, I hesitate to speak on what is really the concern of His Lordship the Minister of Education, but as to the fighting in the city, if it is still going on, I can assure His Venerable Highness that the Gendarmes and Security Guards have it well in hand; the persons responsible are being rounded up, and, if the Minister of Justice concurs, an inquiry will be started tomorrow.\"  The Minister of Justice assured the Minister of Security that his Ministry would be quite ready to co-operate in the inquiry. Count Tammsan then got up and began talking about the riot at the University.  \"What did happen, Paul?\" Marris whispered.  \"Chancellor Khane sacked a science professor for being too interested in science. The students didn't like it. I think Khane's successor will rectify that. Have a good time at the Flower Festivals?\"  She raised her fan to hide a grimace. \"I made my schedule,\" she said. \"Tomorrow, I have fifty more booked.\"  \"Your Imperial Majesty!\" The Counselor who had risen paused, to make sure that he had the Imperial attention, before continuing: \"Inasmuch as this question also seems to involve a scientific experiment, I would suggest that the Ministry of Science and Technology is also interested and since there is at present no Minister holding that portfolio, I would suggest that the discussion be continued after a Minister has been elected.\"  The Minister of Health and Sanity jumped to his feet.  \"Your Imperial Majesty; permit me to concur with the proposal of His Venerable Highness, and to extend it with the subproposal that the Ministry of Science and Technology be abolished, and its functions and personnel divided among the other Ministries, specifically those of Education and of Economics.\"  The Minister of Fine Arts was up before he was fully seated.  \"Your Imperial Majesty; permit me to concur with the proposal of Count Guilfred, and to extend it further with the proposal that the Ministry of Defense, now also vacant, be likewise abolished, and its functions and personnel added to the Ministry of Security under His Highness Prince Travann.\"  So that was it! Marris, beside him, said, \"Well!\" He had long ago discovered that she could pack more meaning into that monosyllable than the average counselor could into a half-hour's speech. Prince Ganzay was thunderstruck, and from the Bench of Counselors six or eight voices were babbling loudly at once. Four Ministers were on their feet clamoring for recognition; Count Duklass of Economics was yelling the loudest, so he got it.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Your Imperial Majesty; it would have been most unseemly in me to have spoken in favor of the proposal of Count Guilfred, being an interested party, but I feel no such hesitation in concurring with the proposal of Baron Garatt, the Minister of Fine Arts. Indeed, I consider it a most excellent proposal----\"  \"And I consider it the most diabolically dangerous proposal to be made in this Hall in the last six centuries!\" old Admiral Gaklar shouted. \"This is a proposal to concentrate all the armed force of the Empire in the hands of one man. Who can say what unscrupulous use might be made of such power?\"  \"Are you intimating, Prince-Counselor, that Prince Travann is contemplating some tyrannical or subversive use of such power?\" Count Tammsan, of all people, demanded.  There was a concerted gasp at that; about half the Plenary Session were absolutely sure that he was. Admiral Geklar backed quickly away from the question.  \"Prince Travann will not be the last Minister of Security,\" he said.  \"What I was about to say, Your Majesty, is that as matters stand, Security has a virtual monopoly on armed power on this planet. When these disorders in the city--which Prince Travann's men are now bringing under control--broke out, there was, I am informed, an order sent out to bring Regular Army and Planetary Militia into Asgard. It will be hours before any of the former can arrive, and at least a day before the latter can even be mobilized. By the time any of them get here, there will be nothing for them to do. Is that not correct, Prince Ganzay?\"  The Prime Minister looked at him angrily, stung by the realization that somebody else had a personal intelligence service as good as his own, then swallowed his anger and assented.  \"Furthermore,\" Count Duklass continued, \"the Ministry of Defense, itself, is an anachronism, which no doubt accounts for the condition in which we now find it. The Empire has no external enemies whatever; all our defense problems are problems of internal security. Let us therefore turn the facilities over to the Ministry responsible for the tasks.\"  The debate went on and on; he paid less and less attention to it, and it became increasingly obvious that opposition to the proposition was dwindling. Cries of, \"Vote! Vote!\" began to be heard from its supporters. Prince Ganzay rose from his desk and came to the throne.  \"Your Imperial Majesty,\" he said softly. \"I am opposed to this proposition, but I am convinced that enough favor it to pass it, even over Your Majesty's veto. Before the vote is called, does Your Majesty wish my resignation?\"  He rose and stepped down beside the Prime Minister, putting an arm over Prince Ganzay's shoulder.  \"Far from it, old friend,\" he said, in a distinctly audible voice. \"I will have too much need for you. But, as for the proposal, I don't oppose it. I think it an excellent one; it has my approval.\" He lowered his voice. \"As soon as it's passed, place General Dorflay's name in nomination.\"  The Prime Minister looked at him sadly for a moment, then nodded, returning to his desk, where he rapped for order and called for the vote.  \"Well, if you can't lick them, join them,\" Marris said as he sat down beside her. \"And if they start chasing you, just yell, 'There he goes; follow me!'\"  The proposal carried, almost unanimously. Prince Ganzay then presented the name of Captain-General Dorflay for elevation to the Bench of Counselors, and the emperor decreed it. As soon as the Session was adjourned and he could do so, he slipped out the little door behind the throne, into an elevator.         *       *       *       *       *  In the room at the top of the Octagon Tower, he laid aside his belt and dress dagger and unfastened his tunic, than sat down in his deep chair and called a serving robot. It was the one which had brought him his breakfast, and he greeted it as a friend; it lit a cigarette for him, and poured a drink of brandy. For a long time he sat, smoking and sipping and looking out the wide window to the west, where the orange sun was firing the clouds behind the mountains, and he realized that he was abominably tired. Well, no wonder; more Empire history had been made today than in the years since he had come to the Throne.  Then something behind him clicked. He turned his head, to see Yorn Travann emerge from the concealed elevator. He grinned and lifted his drink in greeting.  \"I thought you'd be a little late,\" he said. \"Everybody trying to climb onto the bandwagon?\"  Yorn Travann came forward, unbuckling his belt and laying it with Paul's; he sank into the chair opposite, and the robot poured him a drink.  \"Well, do you blame them? What would it have looked like to you, in their place?\"  \"A _coup d'etat_. For that matter, wasn't that what it was? Why didn't you tell me you were springing it?\"  \"I didn't spring it; it was sprung on me. I didn't know a thing about it till Max Duklass buttonholed me down by the landing stage. I'd intended fighting this proposal to partition Science and Technology, but this riot blew up and scared Duklass and Tammsan and Guilfred and the rest of them. They weren't too sure of their majority--that's why they had the election postponed a couple of times--but they were sure that the riot would turn some of the undecided Counselors against them. So they offered to back me to take over Defense in exchange for my supporting their proposal. It looked too good to pass up.\"  \"Even at the price of wrecking Science and Technology?\"  \"It was wrecked, or left to rust into uselessness, long ago. The main function of Technology has been to suppress anything that might threaten this state of economic _rigor mortis_ that Duklass calls stability, and the function of Science has been to let muttonheads like Khane and Dandrik dominate the teaching of science. Well, Defense has its own scientific and technical sections, and when we come to carving the bird, Duklass and Tammsan are going to see a lot of slices going onto my plate.\"  \"And when it's all cut up, it will be discovered that there is no provision for original research. So it will please My Majesty to institute an Imperial Office of Scientific Research, independent of any Ministry, and guess who'll be named to head it.\"  \"Faress. And, by the way, we're all set on Khane, too. First Citizen Yaggo is as delighted to have him as we are to get rid of him. Why don't we get Vann Evaratt back, and give him the job?\"  \"Good. If he takes charge there at the opening of the next academic year, in ten years we'll have a thousand young men, maybe ten times that many, who won't be afraid of new things and new ideas. But the main thing is that now you have Defense, and now the plan can really start firing all jets.\"  \"Yes.\" Yorn Travann got out his cigarettes and lit one. Paul glanced at the robot, hoping that its feelings hadn't been hurt. \"All these native uprisings I've been blowing up out of inter-tribal knife fights, and all these civil wars my people have been manufacturing; there'll be more of them, and I'll start yelling my head off for an adequate Space Navy, and after we get it, these"]]]
