We have interviewed Lyne's butler, and his account agrees with Stay's. Stay left at five minutes past nine, and at twenty-five minutes to ten--exactly half an hour later--Lyne himself left the house, driving his two-seater. He was alone, and told the butler he was going to his club.\"  \"How was he dressed?\" asked Tarling.  \"That is rather important,\" nodded the Commissioner. \"For he was in evening dress until nine o'clock--in fact, until after Stay had gone--when he changed into the kit in which he was found dead.\"  Tarling pursed his lips.  \"He'd hardly change from evening into day dress to go to his club,\" he said.  He left Scotland Yard a little while after this, a much puzzled man. His first call was at the flat in Edgware Road which Odette Rider occupied. She was not at home, and the hall porter told him that she had been away since the afternoon of the previous day. Her letters were to be sent on to Hertford. He had the address, because it was his business to intercept the postman and send forward the letters.  \"Hillington Grove, Hertford.\"  Tarling was worried. There was really no reason why he should be, he told himself, but he was undoubtedly worried. And he was disappointed too. He felt that, if he could have seen the girl and spoken with her for a few minutes, he could have completely disassociated her from any suspicion which might attach. In fact, that she was away from home, that she had \"disappeared\" from her flat on the eve of the murder, would be quite enough, as he knew, to set the official policeman nosing on her trail.  \"Do you know whether Miss Rider has friends at Hertford?\" he asked the porter.  \"Oh, yes, sir,\" said the man nodding. \"Miss Rider's mother lives there.\"  Tarling was going, when the man detained him with a remark which switched his mind back to the murder and filled him with a momentary sense of hopeless dismay.  \"I'm rather glad Miss Rider didn't happen to be in last night, sir,\" he said. \"Some of the tenants upstairs were making complaints.\"  \"Complaints about what?\" asked Tarling, and the man hesitated.  \"I suppose you're a friend of the young lady's, aren't you?\" and Tarling nodded.  \"Well, it only shows you,\" said the porter confidentially, \"how people are very often blamed for something they did not do. The tenant in the next flat is a bit crotchety; he's a musician, and rather deaf. If he hadn't been deaf, he wouldn't have said that Miss Rider was the cause of his being wakened up. I suppose it was something that happened outside.\"  \"What did he hear?\" asked Tarling quickly, and the porter laughed.  \"Well, sir, he thought he heard a shot, and a scream like a woman's. It woke him up. I should have thought he had dreamt it, but another tenant, who also lives in the basement, heard the same sound, and the rum thing was they both thought it was in Miss Rider's flat.\"  \"What time was this?\"  \"They say about midnight, sir,\" said the porter; \"but, of course, it couldn't have happened, because Miss Rider had not been in, and the flat was empty.\"  Here was a disconcerting piece of news for Tarling to carry with him on his railway journey to Hertford. He was determined to see the girl and put her on her guard, and though he realised that it was not exactly his duty to put a suspected criminal upon her guard, and that his conduct was, to say the least of it, irregular, such did not trouble him very much.  He had taken his ticket and was making his way to the platform when he espied a familiar figure hurrying as from a train which had just come in, and apparently the man saw Tarling even before Tarling had recognised him, for he turned abruptly aside and would have disappeared into the press of people had not the detective overtaken him.  \"Hullo, Mr. Milburgh!\" he said. \"Your name is Milburgh, if I remember aright?\"  The manager of Lyne's Store turned, rubbing his hands, his habitual smile upon his face.  \"Why, to be sure,\" he said genially, \"it's Mr. Tarling, the detective gentleman. What sad news this is, Mr. Tarling! How dreadful for everybody concerned!\"  \"I suppose it has meant an upset at the Stores, this terrible happening?\"  \"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Milburgh in a shocked voice. \"Of course we closed the Store for the day. It is dreadful--the most dreadful thing within my experience. Is anybody suspected, sir?\" he asked.  Tarling shook his head.  \"It is a most mysterious circumstance, Mr. Milburgh,\" he said. And then: \"May I ask if any provision had been made to carry on the business in the event of Mr. Lyne's sudden death?\"  Again Milburgh hesitated, and seemed reluctant to reply.  \"I am, of course, in control,\" he said, \"as I was when Mr. Lyne took his trip around the world. I have received authority also from Mr. Lyne's solicitors to continue the direction of the business until the Court appoints a trustee.\"  Tarling eyed him narrowly.  \"What effect has this murder had upon you personally?\" he asked bluntly. \"Does it enhance or depreciate your position?\"  Milburgh smiled.  \"Unhappily,\" he said, \"it enhances my position, because it gives me a greater authority and a greater responsibility. I would that the occasion had never arisen, Mr. Tarling.\"  \"I'm sure you do,\" said Tarling dryly, remembering Lyne's accusations against the other's probity.  After a few commonplaces the men parted.  Milburgh! On the journey to Hertford Tarling analysed that urbane man, and found him deficient in certain essential qualities; weighed him and found him wanting in elements which should certainly form part of the equipment of a trustworthy man.  At Hertford he jumped into a cab and gave the address.  \"Hillington Grove, sir? That's about two miles out,\" said the cabman. \"It's Mrs. Rider you want?\"  Tarling nodded.  \"You ain't come with the young lady she was expecting?\" said the driver  \"No,\" replied Tarling in surprise.  \"I was told to keep my eyes open for a young lady,\" explained the cabman vaguely.  A further surprise awaited the detective. He expected to discover that Hillington Grove was a small suburban house bearing a grandiose title. He was amazed when the cabman turned through a pair of impressive gates, and drove up a wide drive of some considerable length, turning eventually on to a gravelled space before a large mansion. It was hardly the kind of home he would have expected for the parent of a cashier at Lyne's Store, and his surprise was increased when the door was opened by a footman.  He was ushered into a drawing-room, beautifully and artistically furnished. He began to think that some mistake had been made, and was framing an apology to the mistress of the house, when the door opened and a lady entered.  Her age was nearer forty than thirty, but she was still a beautiful woman and carried herself with the air of a grand dame. She was graciousness itself to the visitor, but Tarling thought he detected a note of anxiety both in her mien and in her voice.  \"I'm afraid there's some mistake,\" he began. \"I have probably found the wrong Mrs. Rider--I wanted to see Miss Odette Rider.\"  The lady nodded.  \"That is my daughter,\" she said. \"Have you any news of her? I am quite worried about her.\"  \"Worried about her?\" said Tarling quickly. \"Why, what has happened? Isn't she here?\"  \"Here?\" said Mrs. Rider, wide-eyed. \"Of course she is not.\"  \"But hasn't she been here?\" asked Tarling. \"Didn't she arrive here two nights ago?\"  Mrs. Rider shook her head.  \"My daughter has not been,\" she replied. \"But she promised to come and spend a few days with me, and last night I received a telegram--wait a moment, I will get it for you.\"  She was gone a few moments and came back with a little buff form, which she handed to the detective. He looked and read:       \"My visit cancelled. Do not write to me at flat. I will communicate      with you when I reach my destination.\"  The telegram had been handed in at the General Post Office, London, and was dated nine o'clock--three hours, according to expert opinion, before the murder was committed!     CHAPTER VII  THE WOMAN IN THE CASE   \"May I keep this telegram?\" asked Tarling.  The woman nodded. He saw that she was nervous, ill at ease and worried.  \"I can't quite understand why Odette should not come,\" she said. \"Is there any particular reason?\"  \"That I can't say,\" said Tarling. \"But please don't let it worry you, Mrs. Rider. She probably changed her mind at the last moment and is staying with friends in town.\"  \"Then you haven't seen her?\" asked Mrs. Rider anxiously.  \"I haven't seen her for several days.\"  \"Is anything wrong?\" Her voice shook for a second, but she recovered herself. \"You see,\" she made an attempt to smile. \"I have been in the house for two or three days, and I have seen neither Odette nor--nor anybody else,\" she added quickly.  Who was she expecting to see, wondered Tarling, and why did she check herself? Was it possible that she had not heard of the murder? He determined to test her.  \"Your daughter is probably detained in town owing to Mr. Lyne's death,\" he said, watching her closely.  She started and went white.  \"Mr. Lyne's death?\" she stammered. \"Has he died? That young man?\"  \"He was murdered in Hyde Park yesterday morning,\" said Tarling, and she staggered back and collapsed into a chair.  \"Murdered! Murdered!\" she whispered. \"Oh, God! Not that, not that!\"  Her face was ashen white, and she was shaking in every limb, this stately woman who had walked so serenely into the drawing-room a few minutes before.  Presently she covered her face with her hands and began to weep softly and Tarling waited.  \"Did you know Mr. Lyne?\" he asked after a while.  She shook her head.  \"Have you heard any stories about Mr. Lyne?\"  She looked up.  \"None,\" she said listlessly, \"except that he was--not a very nice man.\"  \"Forgive me asking you, but are you very much interested--\" He hesitated, and she lifted her head.  He did not know how to put this question into words. It "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20912"],["title","The Daffodil Mystery (#7)"],["body","him that the daughter of this woman, who was evidently well off, should be engaged in a more or less humble capacity in Lyne's Store. He wanted to know whether she knew that the girl had been dismissed, and whether that made much difference to her. Then again, his conversation with Odette Rider had not led him to the conclusion that she could afford to throw up her work. She spoke of finding another job, and that did not sound as though her mother was in a good position.  \"Is there any necessity for your daughter working for a living?\" he asked bluntly, and she dropped her eyes.  \"It is her wish,\" she said in a low voice. \"She does not get on with people about here,\" she added hastily.  There was a brief silence, then he rose and offered his hand.  \"I do hope I haven't worried you with my questions,\" he said, \"and I daresay you wonder why I have come. I will tell you candidly that I am engaged in investigating this murder, and I was hoping to hear that your daughter, in common with the other people who were brought into contact with Mr. Lyne, might give me some thread of a clue which would lead to more important things.\"  \"A detective?\" she asked, and he could have sworn there was horror in her eyes.  \"A sort of detective,\" he laughed, \"but not a formidable one, I hope, Mrs. Rider.\"  She saw him to the door, and watched him as he disappeared down the drive; then walked slowly back to the room and stood against the marble mantelpiece, her head upon her arms, weeping softly.  Jack Tarling left Hertford more confused than ever. He had instructed the fly driver to wait for him at the gates, and this worthy he proceeded to pump.  Mrs. Rider had been living in Hertford for four years, and was greatly respected. Did the cabman know the daughter? Oh yes, he had seen the young lady once or twice, but \"She don't come very often,\" he explained. \"By all accounts she doesn't get on with her father.\"  \"Her father? I did not know she had a father,\" said Tarling in surprise.  Yes, there was a father. He was an infrequent visitor, and usually came up from London by the late train and was driven in his own brougham to the house. He had not seen him--indeed, very few people had, but by all accounts he was a very nice man, and well-connected in the City.  Tarling had telegraphed to the assistant who had been placed at his disposal by Scotland Yard, and Detective-Inspector Whiteside was waiting for him at the station.  \"Any fresh news?\" asked Tarling.  \"Yes, sir, there's rather an important clue come to light,\" said Whiteside. \"I've got the car here, sir, and we might discuss it on the way back to the Yard.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Tarling.  \"We got it from Mr. Lyne's manservant,\" said the inspector. \"It appears that the butler had been going through Mr. Lyne's things, acting on instructions from headquarters, and in a corner of his writing-desk a telegram was discovered. I'll show it you when I get to the Yard. It has a very important bearing upon the case, and I think may lead us to the murderer.\"  On the word \"telegram\" Tarling felt mechanically in his pockets for the wire which Mrs. Rider had given him from her daughter. Now he took it out and read it again. It had been handed in at the General Post Office at nine o'clock exactly.  \"That's extraordinary, sir,\" Detective-Inspector Whiteside, sitting by his side, had overlooked the wire.  \"What is extraordinary?\" asked Tarling with an air of surprise.  \"I happened to see the signature to that wire--'Odette,' isn't it?\" said the Scotland Yard man.  \"Yes,\" nodded Tarling. \"Why? What is there extraordinary in that?\"  \"Well, sir,\" said Whiteside, \"it's something of a coincidence that the telegram which was found in Mr. Lyne's desk, and making an appointment with him at a certain flat in the Edgware Road, was also signed 'Odette,' and,\" he bent forward, looking at the wire still in the astonished Tarling's hand, \"and,\" he said in triumph, \"it was handed in exactly at the same time as that!\"  An examination of the telegram at Scotland Yard left no doubt in the detective's mind that Whiteside had spoken nothing but the truth. An urgent message was despatched to the General Post Office, and in two hours the original telegrams were before him. They were both written in the same hand. The first to her mother, saying that she could not come; the second to Lyne, running:       \"Will you see me at my flat to-night at eleven o'clock? ODETTE      RIDER.\"  Tarling's heart sank within him. This amazing news was stunning. It was impossible, impossible, he told himself again and again, that this girl could have killed Lyne. Suppose she had? Where had they met? Had they gone driving together, and had she shot him in making the circuit of the Park? But why should he be wearing list slippers? Why should his coat be off, and why should the night-dress be bound round and round his body?  He thought the matter out, but the more he thought the more puzzled he became. It was a very depressed man who interviewed an authority that night and secured from him a search warrant.  Armed with this and accompanied by Whiteside he made his way to the flat in Edgware Road, and, showing his authority, secured a pass-key from the hall porter, who was also the caretaker of the building. Tarling remembered the last time he had gone to the flat, and it was with a feeling of intense pity for the girl that he turned the key in the lock and stepped into the little hall, reaching out his hand and switching on the light as he did so.  There was nothing in the hall to suggest anything unusual. There was just that close and musty smell which is peculiar to all buildings which have been shut up, even for a few days.  But there was something else.  Tarling sniffed and Whiteside sniffed. A dull, \"burnt\" smell, some pungent, \"scorched\" odour, which he recognised as the stale stench of exploded cordite. He went into the tiny dining-room; everything was neat, nothing displaced.  \"That's curious,\" said Whiteside, pointing to the sideboard, and Tarling saw a deep glass vase half filled with daffodils. Two or three blossoms had either fallen or had been pulled out, and were lying, shrivelled and dead, on the polished surface of the sideboard.  \"Humph!\" said Tarling. \"I don't like this very much.\"  He turned and walked back into the hall and opened another door, which stood ajar. Again he turned on the light. He was in the girl's bedroom. He stopped dead, and slowly examined the room. But for the disordered appearance of the chest of drawers, there was nothing unusual in the appearance of the room. At the open doors of the bureau a little heap of female attire had been thrown pell-mell upon the floor. All these were eloquent of hasty action. Still more was a small suit-case, half packed, an the bed, also left in a great hurry.  Tarling stepped into the room, and if he had been half blind he could not have missed the last and most damning evidence of all. The carpet was of a biscuit colour and covered the room flush to the wainscot. Opposite the fireplace was a big, dark red, irregular stain.  Tarling's face grew tense.  \"This is where Lyne was shot,\" he said.  \"And look there!\" said Whiteside excitedly, pointing to the chest of drawers.  Tarling stepped quickly across the room and pulled out a garment which hung over the edge of the drawer. It was a night-dress--a silk night-dress with two little sprays of forget-me-nots embroidered on the sleeves. It was the companion to that which had been found about Lyne's body. And there was something more. The removal of the garment from the drawer disclosed a mark on the white enamel of the bureau. It was a bloody thumb print!  The detective looked round at his assistant, and the expression of his face was set in its hardest mask.  \"Whiteside,\" he said quietly, \"swear out a warrant for the arrest of Odette Rider on a charge of wilful murder. Telegraph all stations to detain this girl, and let me know the result.\"  Without another word he turned from the room and walked back to his lodgings.     CHAPTER VIII  THE SILENCING OF SAM STAY   There was a criminal in London who was watched day and night. It was no new experience to Sam Stay to find an unconcerned-looking detective strolling along behind him; but for the first time in his life the burglar was neither disconcerted nor embarrassed by these attentions.  The death of Thornton Lyne had been the most tragic blow which had ever overtaken him. And if they had arrested him he would have been indifferent. For this hang-dog criminal, with the long, melancholy face, lined and seamed and puckered so that he appeared to be an old man, had loved Thornton Lyne as he had loved nothing in his wild and barren life. Lyne to him had been some divine creature, possessed gifts and qualities which no other would have recognised in him. In Sam's eyes Lyne could have done no wrong. By Sam Stay's standard he stood for all that was beautiful in human nature.  Thornton Lyne was dead! Dead, dead, dead.  Every footfall echoed the horrible, unbelievable word. The man was incapable of feeling--every other pain was deadened in this great suffering which was his.  And who had been the cause of it all? Whose treachery had cut short this wonderful life? He ground his teeth at the thought. Odette Rider! He remembered the name. He remembered all the injuries she had done to this man, his benefactor. He remembered that long conversation which Lyne and he had had on the morning of Sam's release from prison and the plannings which had followed.  He could not know that his hero was lying, and that in his piqué and hurt vanity he was inventing grievances which had no foundation, and offences which had never been committed. He only knew that, because of the hate which lay in Thornton Lyne's heart, justifiable hate from Sam's view, the death of this great man had been encompassed.  He walked aimlessly westward, unconscious of and uncaring for his shadower, and had reached the"]]]
