It's impossible that he could be so wicked!\"  \"It's not impossible that anybody could be wicked,\" said Tarling of the impassive face and the laughing eyes. \"All that I know is that he even induced Mr. Milburgh to say that complaints have been made by Milburgh concerning thefts of money from your department.\"  \"That's absolutely impossible!\" she cried emphatically. \"Mr. Milburgh would never say such a thing. Absolutely impossible!\"  \"Mr. Milburgh didn't want to say such a thing, I give him credit for that,\" said Tarling slowly, and then gave the gist of the argument, omitting any reference, direct or indirect, to the suspicion which surrounded Milburgh.  \"So you see,\" he said in conclusion, \"that you ought to be on your guard. I suggest to you that you see a solicitor and put the matter in his hands. You need not move against Mr. Lyne, but it would strengthen your position tremendously if you had already detailed the scheme to some person in authority.\"  \"Thank you very, very much, Mr. Tarling,\" she said warmly, and looked up into his face with a smile so sweet, so pathetic, so helpless, that Tarling's heart melted towards her.  \"And if you don't want a solicitor,\" he said, \"you can depend upon me. I will help you if any trouble arises.\"  \"You don't know how grateful I am to you, Mr. Tarling, I didn't receive you very graciously!\"  \"If you will forgive my saying so, you would have been a fool to have received me in any other way,\" he said.  She held out both hands to him: he took them, and there were tears in her eyes. Presently she composed herself, and led him into her little drawing-room.  \"Of course, I've lost my job,\" she laughed, \"but I've had several offers, one of which I shall accept. I am going to have the rest of the week to myself and to take a holiday.\"  Tarling stopped her with a gesture. His ears were superhumanly sensitive.  \"Are you expecting a visitor?\" he asked softly.  \"No,\" said the girl in surprise.  \"Do you share this flat with somebody?\"  \"I have a woman who sleeps here,\" she said. \"She is out for the evening.\"  \"Has she a key?\"  The girl shook her head.  The man rose, and Odette marvelled how one so tall could move so swiftly, and without so much as a sound, across the uncarpeted hallway. He reached the door, turned the knob of the patent lock and jerked it open. A man was standing on the mat and he jumped back at the unexpectedness of Tarling's appearance. The stranger was a cadaverous-looking man, in a brand-new suit of clothes, evidently ready-made, but he still wore on his face the curious yellow tinge which is the special mark of the recently liberated gaol-bird.  \"Beg pardon,\" he stammered, \"but is this No. 87?\"  Tarling shot out a hand, and gripping him by the coat, drew the helpless man towards him.  \"Hullo, what are you trying to do? What's this you have?\"  He wrenched something from the man's hand. It was not a key but a flat-toothed instrument of strange construction.  \"Come in,\" said Tarling, and jerked his prisoner into the hall.  A swift turning back of his prisoner's coat pinioned him, and then with dexterousness and in silence he proceeded to search. From two pockets he took a dozen jewelled rings, each bearing the tiny tag of Lyne's Store.  \"Hullo!\" said Tarling sarcastically, \"are these intended as a loving gift from Mr. Lyne to Miss Rider?\"  The man was speechless with rage. If looks could kill, Tarling would have died.  \"A clumsy trick,\" said Tarling, shaking his head mournfully. \"Now go back to your boss, Mr. Thornton Lyne, and tell him that I am ashamed of an intelligent man adopting so crude a method,\" and with a kick he dismissed Sam Stay to the outer darkness.  The girl, who had been a frightened spectator of the scene, turned her eyes imploringly upon the detective.  \"What does it mean?\" she pleaded. \"I feel so frightened. What did that man want?\"  \"You need not be afraid of that man, or any other man,\" said Tarling briskly. \"I'm sorry you were scared.\"  He succeeded in calming her by the time her servant had returned and then took his leave.  \"Remember, I have given you my telephone number and you will call me up if there is any trouble. Particularly,\" he said emphatically, \"if there is any trouble to-morrow.\"  But there was no trouble on the following day, though at three o'clock in the afternoon she called him up.  \"I am going away to stay in the country,\" she said. \"I got scared last night.\"  \"Come and see me when you get back,\" said Tarling, who had found it difficult to dismiss the girl from his mind. \"I am going to see Lyne to-morrow. By the way, the person who called last night is a protégé of Mr. Thornton Lyne's, a man who is devoted to him body and soul, and he's the fellow we've got to look after. By Jove! It almost gives me an interest in life!\"  He heard the faint laugh of the girl.  \"Must I be butchered to make a detective's holiday?\" she mocked, and he grinned sympathetically.  \"Any way, I'll see Lyne to-morrow,\" he said.  The interview which Jack Tarling projected was destined never to take place.  On the following morning, an early worker taking a short cut through Hyde Park, found the body of a man lying by the side of a carriage drive. He was fully dressed save that his coat and waistcoat had been removed. Wound about his body was a woman's silk night-dress stained with blood. The hands of the figure were crossed on the breast and upon them lay a handful of daffodils.  At eleven o'clock that morning the evening newspapers burst forth with the intelligence that the body had been identified as that of Thornton Lyne, and that he had been shot through the heart.     CHAPTER V  FOUND IN LYNE'S POCKET   \"The London police are confronted with a new mystery, which has features so remarkable, that it would not be an exaggeration to describe this crime as the Murder Mystery of the Century. A well-known figure in London Society, Mr. Thornton Lyne, head of an important commercial organisation, a poet of no mean quality, and a millionaire renowned for his philanthropic activities, was found dead in Hyde Park in the early hours of this morning, in circumstances which admit of no doubt that he was most brutally murdered.  \"At half-past five, Thomas Savage, a bricklayer's labourer employed by the Cubitt Town Construction Company, was making his way across Hyde Park _en route_ to his work. He had crossed the main drive which runs parallel with the Bayswater Road, when his attention was attracted to a figure lying on the grass near to the sidewalk. He made his way to the spot and discovered a man, who had obviously been dead for some hours. The body had neither coat nor waistcoat, but about the breast, on which his two hands were laid, was a silk garment tightly wound about the body, and obviously designed to stanch a wound on the left side above the heart.  \"The extraordinary feature is that the murderer must not only have composed the body, but had laid upon its breast a handful of daffodils. The police were immediately summoned and the body was removed. The police theory is that the murder was not committed in Hyde Park, but the unfortunate gentleman was killed elsewhere and his body conveyed to the Park in his own motor-car, which was found abandoned a hundred yards from the scene of the discovery. We understand that the police are working upon a very important clue, and an arrest is imminent.\"  Mr. J. O. Tarling, late of the Shanghai Detective Service, read the short account in the evening newspaper, and was unusually thoughtful.  Lyne murdered! It was an extraordinary coincidence that he had been brought into touch with this young man only a few days before.  Tarling knew nothing of Lyne's private life, though from his own knowledge of the man during his short stay in Shanghai, he guessed that that life was not wholly blameless. He had been too busy in China to bother his head about the vagaries of a tourist, but he remembered dimly some sort of scandal which had attached to the visitor's name, and puzzled his head to recall all the circumstances.  He put down the newspaper with a little grimace indicative of regret. If he had only been attached to Scotland Yard, what a case this would have been for him! Here was a mystery which promised unusual interest.  His mind wandered to the girl, Odette Rider. What would she think of it? She would be shocked, he thought--horrified. It hurt him to feel that she might be indirectly, even remotely associated with such a public scandal, and he realised with a sudden sense of dismay that nothing was less unlikely than that her name would be mentioned as one who had quarrelled with the dead man.  \"Pshaw!\" he muttered, shrugging off the possibility as absurd, and, walking to the door, called his Chinese servant.  Ling Chu came silently at his bidding.  \"Ling Chu,\" he said, \"the white-faced man is dead.\"  Ling Chu raised his imperturbable eyes to his master's face.  \"All men die some time,\" he said calmly. \"This man quick die. That is better than long die.\"  Tarling looked at him sharply.  \"How do you know that he quick die?\" he demanded.  \"These things are talked about,\" said Ling Chu without hesitation.  \"But not in the Chinese language,\" replied Tarling, \"and, Ling Chu, you speak no English.\"  \"I speak a little, master,\" said Ling Chu, \"and I have heard these things in the streets.\"  Tarling did not answer immediately, and the Chinaman waited.  \"Ling Chu,\" he said after awhile, \"this man came to Shanghai whilst we were there, and there was trouble-trouble. Once he was thrown out from Wing Fu's tea-house, where he had been smoking opium. Also there was another trouble--do you remember?\"  The Chinaman looked him straight in the eyes.  \"I am forgetting,\" he said. \"This white-face was a bad man. I am glad he is dead.\"  \"Humph!\" said Tarling, and dismissed his retainer.  Ling Chu was the cleverest of all his sleuths, a man who"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20912"],["title","The Daffodil Mystery (#5)"],["body","lifted his nose from the trail once it was struck, and he had been the most loyal and faithful of Tarling's native trailers. But the detective never pretended that he understood Ling Chu's mind, or that he could pierce the veil which the native dropped between his own private thoughts and the curious foreigner. Even native criminals were baffled in their interpretation of Ling Chu's views, and many a man had gone to the scaffold puzzling the head, which was soon to be snicked from his body, over the method by which Ling Chu had detected his crime.  Tarling went back to the table and picked up the newspaper, but had hardly begun to read when the telephone bell rang. He picked up the receiver and listened. To his amazement it was the voice of Cresswell, the Assistant Commissioner of Police, who had been instrumental in persuading Tarling to come to England.  \"Can you come round to the Yard immediately, Tarling?\" said the voice. \"I want to talk to you about this murder.\"  \"Surely,\" said Tarling. \"I'll be with you in a few minutes.\"  In five minutes he was at Scotland Yard and was ushered into the office of Assistant Commissioner Cresswell. The white-haired man who came across to meet him with a smile of pleasure in his eyes disclosed the object of the summons.  \"I'm going to bring you into this case, Tarling,\" he said. \"It has certain aspects which seem outside the humdrum experience of our own people. It is not unusual, as you know,\" he said, as he motioned the other to a chair, \"for Scotland Yard to engage outside help, particularly when we have a crime of this character to deal with. The facts you know,\" he went on, as he opened a thin folder. \"These are the reports, which you can read at your leisure. Thornton Lyne was, to say the least, eccentric. His life was not a particularly wholesome one, and he had many undesirable acquaintances, amongst whom was a criminal and ex-convict who was only released from gaol a few days ago.\"  \"That's rather extraordinary,\" said Tarling, lifting his eyebrows. \"What had he in common with the criminal?\"  Commissioner Cresswell shrugged his shoulders.  \"My own view is that this acquaintance was rather a pose of Lyne's. He liked to be talked about. It gave him a certain reputation for character amongst his friends.\"  \"Who is the criminal?\" asked Tarling.  \"He is a man named Stay, a petty larcenist, and in my opinion a much more dangerous character than the police have realised.\"  \"Is he----\" began Tarling. But the Commissioner shook his head.  \"I think we can rule him out from the list of people who may be suspected of this murder,\" he said. \"Sam Stay has very few qualities that would commend themselves to the average man, but there can be no doubt at all that he was devoted to Lyne, body and soul. When the detective temporarily in charge of the case went down to Lambeth to interview Stay, he found him lying on his bed prostrate with grief, with a newspaper containing the particulars of the murder by his side. The man is beside himself with sorrow, and threatens to 'do in' the person who is responsible for this crime. You can interview him later. I doubt whether you will get much out of him, because he is absolutely incoherent. Lyne was something more than human in his eyes, and I should imagine that the only decent emotion he has had in his life is this affection for a man who was certainly good to him, whether he was sincere in his philanthropy or otherwise. Now here are a few of the facts which have not been made public.\" Cresswell settled himself back in his chair and ticked off on his fingers the points as he made them.  \"You know that around Lyne's chest a silk night-dress was discovered?\"  Tarling nodded.  \"Under the night-dress, made into a pad, evidently with the object of arresting the bleeding, were two handkerchiefs, neatly folded, as though they had been taken from a drawer. They were ladies' handkerchiefs, so we may start on the supposition that there is a woman in the case.\"  Tarling nodded.  \"Now another peculiar feature of the case, which happily has escaped the attention of those who saw the body first and gave particulars to the newspapers, was that Lyne, though fully dressed, wore a pair of thick felt slippers. They were taken out of his own store yesterday evening, as we have ascertained, by Lyne himself, who sent for one of his assistants to his office and told him to get a pair of very soft-soled slippers.  \"The third item is that Lyne's boots were discovered in the deserted motor-car which was drawn up by the side of the road a hundred yards from where the body was lying.  \"And the fourth feature--and this explains why I have brought you into the case--is that in the car was discovered his bloodstained coat and waistcoat. In the right-hand pocket of the latter garment,\" said Cresswell, speaking slowly, \"was found this.\" He took from his drawer a small piece of crimson paper two inches square, and handed it without comment to the detective.  Tarling took the paper and stared. Written in thick black ink were four Chinese characters, \"_tzu chao fan nao_\"--\"He brought this trouble upon himself.\"     CHAPTER VI  THE MOTHER OF ODETTE RIDER   The two men looked at one another in silence.  \"Well?\" said the Commissioner at last.  Tarling shook his head.  \"That's amazing,\" he said, and looked at the little slip of paper between his finger and thumb.  \"You see why I am bringing you in,\" said the Commissioner. \"If there is a Chinese end to this crime, nobody knows better than you how to deal with it. I have had this slip translated. It means 'He brought this trouble upon himself.'\"  \"Literally, 'self look for trouble,'\" said Tarling. \"But there is one fact which you may not have noticed. If you will look at the slip, you will see that it is not written but printed.\"  He passed the little red square across the table, and the Commissioner examined it.  \"That's true,\" he said in surprise. \"I did not notice that. Have you seen these slips before?\"  Tarling nodded.  \"A few years ago,\" he said. \"There was a very bad outbreak of crime in Shanghai, mostly under the leadership of a notorious criminal whom I was instrumental in getting beheaded. He ran a gang called 'The Cheerful Hearts'--you know the fantastic titles which these Chinese gangs adopt. It was their custom to leave on the scene of their depredations the _Hong_, or sign-manual of the gang. It was worded exactly as this slip, only it was written. These visiting cards of 'The Cheerful Hearts' were bought up as curios, and commanded high prices until some enterprising Chinaman started printing them, so that you could buy them at almost any stationer's shop in Shanghai--just as you buy picture post-cards.\"  The Commissioner nodded.  \"And this is one of those?\"  \"This is such a one. How it came here, heaven knows,\" he said. \"It is certainly the most remarkable discovery.\"  The Commissioner went to a cupboard, unlocked it and took out a suit-case, which he placed upon the table and opened.  \"Now,\" said the Commissioner, \"look at this, Tarling.\"  \"This\" was a stained garment, which Tarling had no difficulty in recognising as a night-dress. He took it out and examined it. Save for two sprays of forget-me-nots upon the sleeves it was perfectly plain and was innocent of lace or embroidery.  \"It was found round his body, and here are the handkerchiefs.\" He pointed to two tiny squares of linen, so discoloured as to be hardly recognisable.  Tarling lifted the flimsy garment, with its evidence of the terrible purpose for which it had been employed, and carried it to the light.  \"Are there laundry marks?\"  \"None whatever,\" said the Commissioner.  \"Or on the handkerchiefs?\"  \"None,\" replied Mr. Cresswell.  \"The property of a girl who lived alone,\" said Tarling. \"She is not very well off, but extremely neat, fond of good things, but not extravagant, eh?\"  \"How do you know that?\" asked the Commissioner, surprised.  Tarling laughed.  \"The absence of laundry marks shows that she washes her silk garments at home, and probably her handkerchiefs also, which places her amongst the girls who aren't blessed with too many of this world's goods. The fact that it is silk, and good silk, and that the handkerchiefs are good linen, suggests a woman who takes a great deal of trouble, yet whom one would not expect to find over-dressed. Have you any other clue?\"  \"None,\" said the Commissioner. \"We have discovered that Mr. Lyne had rather a serious quarrel with one of his employees, a Miss Odette Rider----\"  Tarling caught his breath. It was, he told himself, absurd to take so keen an interest in a person whom he had not seen for more than ten minutes, and who a week before was a perfect stranger. But somehow the girl had made a deeper impression upon him than he had realised. This man, who had spent his life in the investigation of crime and in the study of criminals, had found little time to interest himself in womanhood, and Odette Rider had been a revelation to him.  \"I happen to know there was a quarrel. I also know the cause,\" he said, and related briefly the circumstances under which he himself had met Thornton Lyne. \"What have you against her?\" he said, with an assumption of carelessness which he did not feel.  \"Nothing definite,\" said the Commissioner. \"Her principal accuser is the man Stay. Even he did not accuse her directly, but he hinted that she was responsible, in some way which he did not particularise, for Thornton Lyne's death. I thought it curious that he should know anything about this girl, but I am inclined to think that Thornton Lyne made this man his confidant.\"  \"What about the man?\" asked Tarling. \"Can he account for his movements last night and early this morning?\"  \"His statement,\" replied the Commissioner, \"is that he saw Mr. Lyne at his flat at nine o'clock, and that Mr. Lyne gave him five pounds in the presence of Lyne's butler. He said he left the flat and went to his lodgings in Lambeth, where he went to bed"]]]
