When the sun enters the sign Libra the days and nights are equal all over the world and seem to observe a certain equilibrium like a balance, hence the name of the constellation.  [Illustration: LIBRA]     CORONA BOREALIS (kō-rō´nä bō-rē-a´-lis)--THE NORTHERN CROWN.   LOCATION.--A line drawn from α Cygni, to α Lyræ, and projected a little over 40°, terminates in the Crown, which lies between Hercules and Boötes, and just above the diamond-shaped group of stars in the head of the Serpent.  The characteristic semicircle resembling a crown is easily traced out. The principal stars are of the fourth magnitude excepting Gemma, which is a second-magnitude star and known as the \"Pearl of the Crown.\"  Gemma, sometimes called Alphacca, forms with the stars Seginus and Arcturus, in Boötes, an isosceles triangle, the vertex of which is at Arcturus.  Close to ε a famous temporary appeared suddenly May 12, 1866, as a second-magnitude star. It was known as the \"Blaze Star\" and was visible to the naked eye only eight days, fading at that time to a tenth-magnitude star, and then rising to an eighth-magnitude, where it still remains.  The native Australians called this constellation \"The Boomerang.\" To the Hebrews it was \"Ataroth\" and by this name it is known in the East to-day. No two of the seven stars composing the Crown are moving in the same direction or at the same rate.  α Coronæ is seventy-eight light years distant and sixty times brighter than the sun.  [Illustration: CORONA BOREALIS]     HERCULES (her´-kū-lēz)--THE KNEELER.   LOCATION.--A line drawn from either Vega, in Lyra, or Altair, in Aquila, to Gemma, in Corona Borealis, passes through this constellation. The left foot of Hercules rests on the head of Draco, on the north, and his head nearly touches the head of Ophiuchus on the south.  The star in the head of Hercules, Ras Algethi, is about 25° southeast of Corona Borealis.  α Ophiuchi and α Herculis are only about 5° apart.  The cluster 13 M., the Halley Nebula, can be easily seen in an opera-glass. In a recent photograph of this cluster 50,000 stars are shown in an area of sky which would be entirely covered by the full moon.  Hercules occupies the part of the heavens toward which the sun is bearing the earth and planets at the rate of twelve miles a second or 373 million miles a year.  On a clear night the asterism Cerberus, the three-headed dog, which Hercules holds in his hand, can be seen.  This constellation is said to have been an object of worship in Phœnicia. There is a good deal of mystery about its origin. The ancient Greeks called it \"The Phantom\" and \"The Man upon his Knees.\"  The stars ε, ζ, η, and π form a keystone shaped figure that serves to identify the constellation.  [Illustration: HERCULES]     BOÖTES (bō-ō´tēz)--THE HERDSMAN, OR BEAR DRIVER. (Face West.)   LOCATION.--Boötes lies just west of the Crown, and east of Cor Caroli. It may be easily distinguished by the position and splendor of its principal star, Arcturus, which shines with a golden yellow lustre. It is about 35° east of Denebola, in Leo, and nearly as far north of Spica, in Virgo, and forms with these two a large equilateral triangle. A line drawn from ζ to η Ursæ Majoris and prolonged about 30° locates it, as does one from δ Herculis to γ Coronæ prolonged its length.  The brightest stars in Boötes outline a characteristic kite-shaped figure. Arcturus is mentioned in the Book of Job and is often referred to as \"The Star of Job.\"  Three stars of the fourth magnitude are situated in the right hand. They are about 5° north of η Ursæ Majoris.  Contrast the color of Arcturus with Spica, Antares, and Vega.  The trapezium β, γ, δ, and μ, was called \"The Female Wolves,\" by the Arabians; θ, ι, κ and λ, \"The Whelps of the Hyenas.\" They knew the constellation as \"The Vociferator.\"  Arcturus is the fourth brightest star in the northern hemisphere. It is 1000 times the size of our sun and rushes through space toward Virgo at the astounding rate of ninety miles a second. It is forty light years distant.  The ancient Greeks called this constellation \"Lycaon,\" a name which signifies a Wolf. The Hebrew name for it was \"The Barking Dog.\"  [Illustration: BOÖTES]     VIRGO (ver´-gō)--THE VIRGIN. (Face West.)   LOCATION.--An imaginary line drawn from Antares in Scorpius through α Libræ and prolonged a little over 20° strikes Spica, the brightest star in Virgo, which star is about 30° southwest of Arcturus.  Arcturus, Cor Caroli, Denebola, and Spica form a figure about 50° in length, called the Diamond of Virgo.  The equator, ecliptic, and equinoctial colure intersect each other at a point close to the star η. This is called the autumnal equinox.  The star ε is known as the \"Grape Gatherer.\" It is observed to rise just before the sun at vintage time.  Within the rude square formed by Denebola, and ε, γ, and β, Virginis, the telescope reveals many wonderful nebulæ; hence this region of the sky has been called \"The Field of the Nebula.\"  Spica is an extremely beautiful pure white star. It rises a very little south of the exact eastern point on the horizon.  γ is a fine double star for a small telescope.  Virgo is mentioned by the astronomers of all ages. By the Egyptians it was intended to represent the goddess Isis, and the Greeks knew it as Ceres. Spica represents the ear of corn held in the Virgin's left hand.  [Illustration: VIRGO]     CANES VENATICI (kā´-nēz ve-nat´-i-cī)--THE HUNTING DOGS. (Face Northwest.)   LOCATION.--Cor Caroli, the bright star in this constellation, when on the meridian is about 17° south of ε Ursæ Majoris. A line drawn from η Ursæ Majoris, through Berenice's Hair, to Denebola, in Leo, passes through it.  The dogs, Asterion and Chara, are represented as being held in leash by Boötes, the herdsman, in his pursuit of the Great Bear.  Cor Caroli is in the southern hound, Chara, and represents the heart of Charles II of England. It is a beautiful double star in a small telescope.  The so-called \"Diamond of Virgo,\" is clearly shown on this plate. It is formed by connecting with lines the stars Cor Caroli, Denebola, Spica, and Arcturus.  The fifth-magnitude star La Superba, about 7° north and 2½° west of Cor Caroli, is especially noteworthy because of the flashing brilliancy of its prismatic rays.

[Illustration: Map showing the principal stars visible from Lat. 40° N. at 9 o'clock, October first.]     CASSIOPEIA (kas-i-ō-pē´-ya)--THE LADY IN THE CHAIR. (Face North.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from δ Ursæ Majoris, through Polaris, strikes α Cassiopeiæ. It is situated the same distance from Polaris as Ursa Major, and about midway between Polaris and the zenith in the Milky Way. Cassiopeia is characterized by a zigzag row of stars which form a rude \"W,\" but in mid-autumn, to an observer facing north, the \"W\" appears more like an \"M,\" and is almost overhead. Note the spot marked 1572. This is where a very famous temporary star appeared in that year. It was bright enough at one time to be seen in full sunshine. The star η is sixteen light years distant.  Caph is equidistant from the Pole, and exactly opposite the star Megres in Ursa Major; with α Andromedæ and γ Pegasi it marks the equinoctial colure. These stars are known as \"The Three Guides.\"  The chair can be readily traced out; β, α, and γ mark three of the four corners of the back, and δ and ε, one of the front legs. The word \"Bagdei,\" made up of the letters for the principal stars, assists the memory.  The stars γ and β are pointer stars to a fifth-magnitude star the lucida of the asterism Lacerta, the lizard about 15° from β.  Cassiopeia makes an excellent illuminated clock. When β is above Polaris it is noon, when it is in the west at right angles to its first position it is 6 P.M. At midnight it is on the northern horizon, and at 6 P.M. it is due east.  This is sidereal time which agrees with mean time on March 22d, and gains on the latter at the rate of two hours a month.  [Illustration: CASSIOPEIA]     CEPHEUS (sē´-fūs) (Face North.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from α to β Cassiopeiæ and prolonged about 18° strikes α Cephei. The nearest bright star west of Polaris is γ Cephei. Cepheus is an inconspicuous constellation, lying partly in the Milky Way. A view of this constellation through an opera-glass will repay the observer. Cepheus is characterized by a rude square, one side of which is the base of an isosceles triangle. Look for the so-called garnet star μ, probably the reddest star visible to the naked eye in the United States. The star ζ has a blue companion star.  α forms an equilateral triangle with Polaris and ε Cassiopeiæ.  It is claimed that Cepheus was known to the Chaldæans twenty-three centuries before our era.  Surrounding δ, ε, ζ, and λ, which mark the king's head, is a vacant space in the Milky Way, similar to the Coal Sack of Cygnus.  About 4° from γ, in the direction of κ is a pretty pair of sixth-magnitude stars.  Owing to precession, γ, β, and α Cephei will be successively the Pole Star in 4500, 6000, and 7500 A.D. respectively.  δ is a double whose components are yellow and blue. It is an interesting variable changing from magnitude 3.7 to 4.9 at intervals of 5 days 8 hours 47 minutes. As it is three times as bright at maximum as at minimum and can be observed with the naked eye its variations are well worth observing.  [Illustration: CEPHEUS]     PEGASUS (peg´-a-sus)--THE WINGED HORSE. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--One corner of the Great Square is found by drawing a line from Polaris to Cassiopeia, and prolonging it an equal distance.  The Great Square is a stellar landmark. Three of the corners of the square are marked by stars in Pegasus; the fourth, and northeastern, corner is marked by the star Alpheratz in Andromeda. Each side of the square is about 18° long.  The horse is generally seen upside down, with his fore feet projected up into the sky. Only the head, neck, and fore feet are represented. The star Enif marks the nose.  π is an interesting double, easily seen in an opera-glass. All the stars of the Square are approaching us at an inconceivable speed.  The position of the asterism Equus or Equūleus, the Little Horse, or Horse's Head, is shown in the diagram.  Delphinus, the water jar of Aquarius, and the circlet in the Western Fish, are all in the vicinity of Pegasus, and indicated in the diagram.  The winged horse is found on coins of Corinth 500 to 430 B.C. The Greeks called this constellation ἱπποσ.  Pegasus seems to have been regarded in Phœnicia and Egypt as the sky emblem of a ship.  Within the area of the Square Argelander counted thirty naked-eye stars.  Note a fine pair in Equūleus just west of the star Enif in Pegasus.  The position of the equinoctial colure is defined by a line connecting Polaris, β Cassiopeiæ, α Andromedæ, and γ Pegasi.  [Illustration: PEGASUS]     ANDROMEDA (an-drom´-e-dä)--THE CHAINED LADY.   LOCATION.--The star α Alpheratz is at the northeastern corner of the great square of Pegasus, one of the stellar landmarks.  Running east from α, at almost equal distances, are four other stars, two of which are of the second magnitude. The most easterly one is β Persei, known as Algol, the famous variable. Lines connecting the stars γ Andromedæ, Algol, and α Persei form a right-angled triangle. The right angle is marked by Algol.  The chief object of interest in this constellation is the great nebula, the first to be discovered. It can be seen by the naked eye and it is a fine sight in an opera-glass. Its location is indicated in the diagram.  The star γ is the radiant point of the Bielid meteors, looked for in November. It is a colored double visible in a 3\" glass.  The great nebula has been called the \"Queen of the Nebulæ.\" It is said to have been known as far back as A.D. 905, and it was described 986 A.D. as the \"Little Cloud.\"  Andromeda is very favorable for observation in September, low in the eastern sky.  Note the characteristic \"Y\" shaped asterism known as Gloria Frederika or Frederik's Glory. It lies about at the apex of a nearly isosceles triangle of which a line connecting Alpheratz and β Pegasi is the base. A line drawn from δ to α Cassiopeiæ and prolonged a little over twice its length points it out.  [Illustration: ANDROMEDA]     PERSEUS (per´-sūs)--THE CHAMPION. (Face Northeast.)   LOCATION.--α Persei lies on a line drawn from β to γ Andromedæ, and is about 9° from the latter. The most striking feature in Perseus is the so-called \"segment of Perseus,\" a curve of stars beginning about 12° below Cassiopeia, and curving toward Ursa Major. Note the famous variable Algol the Demon star. It represents the Medusa's head which Perseus holds in his hand. It varies from the second to the fourth magnitude in about three and one-half hours, and back again in the same time, after which it remains steadily brilliant for two and three-quarters days, when the same change recurs. Algenib and Algol form with γ Andromedæ, a right-angled triangle.  Note a dull red star near Algol, and a pretty pair just above Algenib.  An opera-glass reveals much that is worthy of observation in this region of the sky. It has been said of the clusters between Cassiopeia and Perseus that they form the most striking sidereal spectacle in the northern heavens. They are visible to the naked eye. Algenib never sets in the latitude of New York, just touching the horizon at its lower culmination. It is estimated that Algol is a little over a million miles in diameter, η has three faint stars on one side nearly in a line, and one on the other--a miniature representation of Jupiter and his satellites.  Algol, when on the meridian of New York City, is only one tenth of a degree from the zenith point. This remarkable variable has a dark companion star revolving near it obscuring its light in part from us at stated intervals. By means of the spectroscope the speed diameter and mass of this invisible star has been reckoned.  [Illustration: PERSEUS]     PISCES (pis´ēz)--THE FISHES. (Face Southeast.)   LOCATION.--This constellation is represented by two fishes each with a ribbon tied to its tail. One, the Northern Fish, lies just below β Andromedæ,--the other, represented by the circlet, is just below Pegasus. The ribbons, represented by streams of faint stars, from a \"V\" with elongated sides, and terminate in the star Al Rischa, The Knot.  Below ω, and to the east of λ the spot marked (*) is the place which the sun occupies at the time of the equinox. It is one of the two crossing places of the equinoctial, or equator, of the heavens, and the ecliptic, or sun's path.  Below Pisces is Cetus, the Whale.  Pisces is thought to have taken its name from its coincidence with the sun during the rainy season.  Three distinct conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn took place in this constellation in the year 747 of Rome.  Pisces was considered the national constellation of the Jews, as well as a tribal symbol.  In 1881, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus were grouped together in Pisces.  The Circlet is a very striking group forming a pentagon. The glass reveals two faint stars in addition, making the figure seven-sided or elliptical in form.  As to the number of the stars as classified according to their magnitude, that is their brightness, it may be mentioned that there are approximately 20 stars of the first magnitude, 65 of the second, 300 of"]]]
