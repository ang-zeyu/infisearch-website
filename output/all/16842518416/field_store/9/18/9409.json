Thus oxide of sulphur is the product of the combustion of sulphur; oxide of iron is the product of the combustion of iron. It is evident that the products of the combustion of any substance must weigh more than the original substance, the increase in weight corresponding to the amount of oxygen taken up in the act of combustion. For example, when iron burns the oxide of iron formed weighs more than the original iron.  In some cases the products of combustion are invisible gases, so that the substance undergoing combustion is apparently destroyed. Thus, when a candle burns it is consumed, and so far as the eye can judge nothing is formed during combustion. That invisible gases are formed, however, and that the weight of these is greater than the weight of the candle may be shown by the following experiment.  [Illustration: Fig. 7]       A lamp chimney is filled with sticks of the compound known as      sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), and suspended from the beam of      the balance, as shown in Fig. 7. A piece of candle is placed on      the balance pan so that the wick comes just below the chimney,      and the balance is brought to a level by adding weights to the      other pan. The candle is then lighted. The products formed pass      up through the chimney and are absorbed by the sodium      hydroxide. Although the candle burns away, the pan upon which      it rests slowly sinks, showing that the combustion is attended      by an increase in weight.       ~Combustion in air and in oxygen.~ Combustion in air and in      oxygen differs only in rapidity, the products formed being      exactly the same. That the process should take place less      rapidly in the former is readily understood, for the air is      only about one fifth oxygen, the remaining four fifths being      inert gases. Not only is less oxygen available, but much of the      heat is absorbed in raising the temperature of the inert gases      surrounding the substance undergoing combustion, and the      temperature reached in the combustion is therefore less.       ~Phlogiston theory of combustion.~ The French chemist Lavoisier      (1743-1794), who gave to oxygen its name was the first to show      that combustion is due to union with oxygen. Previous to his      time combustion was supposed to be due to the presence of a      substance or principle called _phlogiston_. One substance was      thought to be more combustible than another because it      contained more phlogiston. Coal, for example, was thought to be      very rich in phlogiston. The ashes left after combustion would      not burn because all the phlogiston had escaped. If the      phlogiston could be restored in any way, the substance would      then become combustible again. Although this view seems absurd      to us in the light of our present knowledge, it formerly had      general acceptance. The discovery of oxygen led Lavoisier to      investigate the subject, and through his experiments he arrived      at the true explanation of combustion. The discovery of oxygen      together with the part it plays in combustion is generally      regarded as the most important discovery in the history of      chemistry. It marked the dawn of a new period in the growth of      the science.  ~Combustion in the broad sense.~ According to the definition given above, the presence of oxygen is necessary for combustion. The term is sometimes used, however, in a broader sense to designate any chemical change attended by the evolution of heat and light. Thus iron and sulphur, or hydrogen and chlorine under certain conditions, will combine so rapidly that light is evolved, and the action is called a combustion. Whenever combustion takes place in the air, however, the process is one of oxidation.       ~Spontaneous combustion.~ The temperature reached in a given      chemical action, such as oxidation, depends upon the rate at      which the reaction takes place. This rate is usually increased      by raising the temperature of the substances taking part in the      action.       When a slow oxidation takes place under such conditions that      the heat generated is not lost by being conducted away, the      temperature of the substance undergoing oxidation is raised,      and this in turn hastens the rate of oxidation. The rise in      temperature may continue in this way until the kindling      temperature of the substance is reached, when combustion      begins. Combustion occurring in this way is called _spontaneous      combustion_.       Certain oils, such as the linseed oil used in paints, slowly      undergo oxidation at ordinary temperatures, and not      infrequently the origin of fires has been traced to the      spontaneous combustion of oily rags. The spontaneous combustion      of hay has been known to set barns on fire. Heaps of coal have      been found to be on fire when spontaneous combustion offered      the only possible explanation.  ~Importance of oxygen.~ 1. Oxygen is essential to life. Among living organisms only certain minute forms of plant life can exist without it. In the process of respiration the air is taken into the lungs where a certain amount of oxygen is absorbed by the blood. It is then carried to all parts of the body, oxidizing the worn-out tissues and changing them into substances which may readily be eliminated from the body. The heat generated by this oxidation is the source of the heat of the body. The small amount of oxygen which water dissolves from the air supports all the varied forms of aquatic animals.  2. Oxygen is also essential to decay. The process of decay is really a kind of oxidation, but it will only take place in the presence of certain minute forms of life known as bacteria. Just how these assist in the oxidation is not known. By this process the dead products of animal and vegetable life which collect on the surface of the earth are slowly oxidized and so converted into harmless substances. In this way oxygen acts as a great purifying agent.  3. Oxygen is also used in the treatment of certain diseases in which the patient is unable to inhale sufficient air to supply the necessary amount of oxygen.   OZONE  ~Preparation.~ When electric sparks are passed through oxygen or air a small percentage of the oxygen is converted into a substance called _ozone_, which differs greatly from oxygen in its properties. The same change can also be brought about by certain chemical processes. Thus, if some pieces of phosphorus are placed in a bottle and partially covered with water, the presence of ozone may soon be detected in the air contained in the bottle. The conversion of oxygen into ozone is attended by a change in volume, 3 volumes of oxygen forming 2 volumes of ozone. If the resulting ozone is heated to about 300°, the reverse change takes place, the 2 volumes of ozone being changed back into 3 volumes of oxygen. It is possible that traces of ozone exist in the atmosphere, although its presence there has not been definitely proved, the tests formerly used for its detection having been shown to be unreliable.  ~Properties.~ As commonly prepared, ozone is mixed with a large excess of oxygen. It is possible, however, to separate the ozone and thus obtain it in pure form. The gas so obtained has the characteristic odor noticed about electrical machines when in operation. By subjecting it to great pressure and a low temperature, the gas condenses to a bluish liquid, boiling at -119°. When unmixed with other gases ozone is very explosive, changing back into oxygen with the liberation of heat. Its chemical properties are similar to those of oxygen except that it is far more active. Air or oxygen containing a small amount of ozone is now used in place of oxygen in certain manufacturing processes.  ~The difference between oxygen and ozone.~ Experiments show that in changing oxygen into ozone no other kind of matter is either added to the oxygen or withdrawn from it. The question arises then, How can we account for the difference in their properties? It must be remembered that in all changes we have to take into account _energy_ as well as _matter_. By changing the amount of energy in a substance we change its properties. That oxygen and ozone contain different amounts of energy may be shown in a number of ways; for example, by the fact that the conversion of ozone into oxygen is attended by the liberation of heat. The passage of the electric sparks through oxygen has in some way changed the energy content of the element and thus it has acquired new properties. _Oxygen and ozone must, therefore, be regarded as identical so far as the kind of matter of which they are composed is concerned. Their different properties are due to their different energy contents._  ~Allotropic states or forms of matter.~ Other elements besides oxygen may exist in more than one form. These different forms of the same element are called _allotropic states_ or _forms_ of the element. These forms differ not only in physical properties but also in their energy contents. Elements often exist in a variety of forms which look quite different. These differences may be due to accidental causes, such as the size or shape of the particles or the way in which the element was prepared. Only such forms, however, as have different energy contents are properly called allotropic forms.   MEASUREMENT OF GAS VOLUMES  ~Standard conditions.~ It is a well-known fact that the volume occupied by a definite weight of any gas can be altered by changing the temperature of the gas or the pressure to which it is subjected. In measuring the volume of gases it is therefore necessary, for the sake of accuracy, to adopt some standard conditions of temperature and pressure. The conditions agreed upon are (1) a temperature"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20848"],["title","An Elementary Study of Chemistry (#5)"],["body"," 0°, and (2) a pressure equal to the average pressure exerted by the atmosphere at the sea level, that is, 1033.3 g. per square centimeter. These conditions of temperature and pressure are known as the _standard conditions_, and when the volume of a gas is given it is understood that the measurement was made under these conditions, unless it is expressly stated otherwise. For example, the weight of a liter of oxygen has been given as 1.4285 g. This means that one liter of oxygen, measured at a temperature of 0° and under a pressure of 1033.3 g. per square centimeter, weighs 1.4285 g.  The conditions which prevail in the laboratory are never the standard conditions. It becomes necessary, therefore, to find a way to calculate the volume which a gas will occupy under standard conditions from the volume which it occupies under any other conditions. This may be done in accordance with the following laws.  ~Law of Charles.~ This law expresses the effect which a change in the temperature of a gas has upon its volume. It may be stated as follows: _For every degree the temperature of a gas rises above zero the volume of the gas is increased by 1/273 of the volume which it occupies at zero; likewise for every degree the temperature of the gas falls below zero the volume of the gas is decreased by 1/273 of the volume which it occupies at zero, provided in both cases that the pressure to which the gas is subjected remains constant._  If V represents the volume of gas at 0°, then the volume at 1° will be V + 1/273 V; at 2° it will be V + 2/273 V; or, in general, the volume v, at the temperature t, will be expressed by the formula      (1) v = V + t/273 V,      or (2) v = V(1 + (t/273)).  Since 1/273 = 0.00366, the formula may be written      (3) v = V(1 + 0.00366t).  Since the value of V (volume under standard conditions) is the one usually sought, it is convenient to transpose the equation to the following form:      (4) V = v/(1 + 0.00366t).  The following problem will serve as an illustration of the application of this equation.  The volume of a gas at 20° is 750 cc.; find the volume it will occupy at 0°, the pressure remaining constant.  In this case, v = 750 cc. and t = 20. By substituting these values, equation (4) becomes      V = 750/(1 + 0.00366 × 20) = 698.9 cc.  ~Law of Boyle.~ This law expresses the relation between the volume occupied by a gas and the pressure to which it is subjected. It may be stated as follows: _The volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured, provided the temperature of the gas remains constant._  If V represents the volume when subjected to a pressure P and v represents its volume when the pressure is changed to p, then, in accordance with the above law, V : v :: p : P, or VP = vp. In other words, for a given weight of a gas the product of the numbers representing its volume and the pressure to which it is subjected is a constant.  Since the pressure of the atmosphere at any point is indicated by the barometric reading, it is convenient in the solution of the problems to substitute the latter for the pressure measured in grams per square centimeter. The average reading of the barometer at the sea level is 760 mm., which corresponds to a pressure of 1033.3 g. per square centimeter. The following problem will serve as an illustration of the application of Boyle's law.  A gas occupies a volume of 500 cc. in a laboratory where the barometric reading is 740 mm. What volume would it occupy if the atmospheric pressure changed so that the reading became 750 mm.?  Substituting the values in the equation VP = vp, we have 500 × 740 = v × 750, or v = 493.3 cc.  ~Variations in the volume of a gas due to changes both in temperature and pressure.~ Inasmuch as corrections must be made as a rule for both temperature and pressure, it is convenient to combine the equations given above for the corrections for each, so that the two corrections may be made in one operation. The following equation is thus obtained:      (5) V_{s} = vp/(760(1 + 0.00366t)),  in which V_{s} represents the volume of a gas under standard conditions and v, p, and t the volume, pressure, and temperature respectively at which the gas was actually measured.  The following problem will serve to illustrate the application of this equation.  A gas having a temperature of 20° occupies a volume of 500 cc. when subjected to a pressure indicated by a barometric reading of 740 mm. What volume would this gas occupy under standard conditions?  In this problem v = 500, p = 740, and t = 20. Substituting these values in the above equation, we get      V_{s} = (500 × 740)/(760 (1 + 0.00366 × 20)) = 453.6 cc.  [Illustration: Fig. 8]  ~Variations in the volume of a gas due to the pressure of aqueous vapor.~ In many cases gases are collected over water, as explained under the preparation of oxygen. In such cases there is present in the gas a certain amount of water vapor. This vapor exerts a definite pressure, which acts in opposition to the atmospheric pressure and which therefore must be subtracted from the latter in determining the effective pressure upon the gas. Thus, suppose we wish to determine the pressure to which the gas in tube A (Fig. 8) is subjected. The tube is raised or lowered until the level of the water inside and outside the tube is the same. The atmosphere presses down upon the surface of the water (as indicated by the arrows), thus forcing the water upward within the tube with a pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure. The full force of this upward pressure, however, is not spent in compressing the gas within the tube, for since it is collected over water it contains a certain amount of water vapor. This water vapor exerts a pressure (as indicated by the arrow within the tube) in opposition to the upward pressure. It is plain, therefore, that the effective pressure upon the gas is equal to the atmospheric pressure less the pressure exerted by the aqueous vapor. The pressure exerted by the aqueous vapor increases with the temperature. The figures representing the extent of this pressure (often called the _tension of aqueous vapor_) are given in the Appendix. They express the pressure or tension in millimeters of mercury, just as the atmospheric pressure is expressed in millimeters of mercury. Representing the pressure of the aqueous vapor by a, formula (5) becomes      (6) V_{s} = v(p - a)/(760(1 + 0.00366t)).  The following problem will serve to illustrate the method of applying the correction for the pressure of the aqueous vapor.  The volume of a gas measured over water in a laboratory where the temperature is 20° and the barometric reading is 740 mm. is 500 cc. What volume would this occupy under standard conditions?  The pressure exerted by the aqueous vapor at 20° (see table in Appendix) is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of mercury 17.4 mm. in height. Substituting the values of v, t, p, and a in formula (6), we have      (6) V_{s} = 500(740 - 17.4)/(760(1 + 0.00366 × 20)) = 442.9 cc.  ~Adjustment of tubes before reading gas volumes.~ In measuring the volumes of gases collected in graduated tubes or other receivers, over a liquid as illustrated in Fig. 8, the reading should be taken after raising or lowering the tube containing the gas until the level of the liquid inside and outside the tube is the same; for it is only under these conditions that the upward pressure within the tube is the same as the atmospheric pressure.

CHAPTER III  HYDROGEN   ~Historical.~ The element hydrogen was first clearly recognized as a distinct substance by the English investigator Cavendish, who in 1766 obtained it in a pure state, and showed it to be different from the other inflammable airs or gases which had long been known. Lavoisier gave it the name hydrogen, signifying water former, since it had been found to be a constituent of water.  ~Occurrence.~ In the free state hydrogen is found in the atmosphere, but only in traces. In the combined state it is widely distributed, being a constituent of water as well as of all living organisms, and the products derived from them, such as starch and sugar. About 10% of the human body is hydrogen."]]]
