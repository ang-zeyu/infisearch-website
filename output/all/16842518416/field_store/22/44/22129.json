You are grateful, and you say to yourself, half in envy      and half in admiration: “Here is a _book_; here, or one is a      Dutchman, is one of the books of the year.”’--_National Observer._       ‘“Barrack-Room Ballads” contains some of the best work that Mr.      Kipling has ever done, which is saying a good deal. “Fuzzy-Wuzzy,”      “Gunga Din,” and “Tommy,” are, in our opinion, altogether superior      to anything of the kind that English literature has hitherto      produced.’--_Athenæum._       ‘These ballads are as wonderful in their descriptive power as they      are vigorous in their dramatic force. There are few ballads in the      English language more stirring than “The Ballad of East and West,”      worthy to stand by the Border ballads of Scott.’--_Spectator._       ‘The ballads teem with imagination, they palpitate with emotion. We      read them with laughter and tears; the metres throb in our pulses,      the cunningly ordered words tingle with life; and if this be not      poetry, what is?’--_Pall Mall Gazette._       =Henley.= LYRA HEROICA: An Anthology selected from the best English      Verse of the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries.
