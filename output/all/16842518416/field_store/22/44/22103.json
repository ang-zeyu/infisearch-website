Here he reared and plunged, causing the young ladies to scream “murder”  at the top of their voices.  “Oh, my! Oh, dear me!” bawled Felix, and took refuge behind a neighboring hedge. “The horse has gone crazy! He'll bite somebody next!”  The cries reached some men who were not far off, and they came running to the assistance of the party. One caught the steed by the bridle and soon had him quieted down.  “I'll never drive that horse again!” said the dude. “Not for a million dollars!”  “How are we to get home?” queried Belle.  “I'll drive you,” said one of the men. “I know this horse. He used to belong to Bill Perkins. I know how to handle him.”  “Then do so,” answered Felix, “and I'll pay you two dollars.”  The man was as good as his word, and to Felix's astonishment he made the horse go back to the hotel without the slightest mishap. Then the horse was put in the stable, the dude paid the bill, and the party separated.  “I shall never drive again, never!” declared the dude to himself, and it may be added that he kept his word.  “I hope you had a nice drive,” said Joe, when he met Felix that evening.  “It was beastly, don't you know,” was the answer. “That horse was a terribly vicious creature.”  “He looked to be gentle enough when he started off.”  “I think he is a crazy horse.”  “By the way, Mr. Gussing, Mr. Silas Simms was looking for you.”  “You mean that lawyer who drives the spotted white horse?”  “Yes.”  Felix gave a groan.  “He says he wants damages.”  “It wasn't my fault that the horse ran into him.”  “Well, he is very angry about it, anyway,” said our hero.  Early the next morning Felix Gussing received a communication from the lawyer. It was in the following terms:--  “MR. GUSSING. Sir:--In consequence of your reckless driving yesterday, I was thrown from my carriage, receiving a contusion on my shoulder and other injuries. My carriage was also nearly ruined. If you choose to make a race-course of the public highways you must abide the consequences. The damage I have sustained I cannot estimate at less than one hundred and fifty dollars. Indemnify me for that and I will go no further. Otherwise, I shall be compelled to resort to legal action.  “SILAS SIMMS, Atty.”  Felix read the letter several times and his knees shook visibly. He did not want to pay over such an amount, yet it struck him with terror when he thought he might possibly be arrested for fast driving. He went to see Mr. Silas Simms.  “I am very sorry,” he began.  “Have you come to pay?” demanded the attorney, curtly.  “Well--er--the fact is--don't you think you are asking rather a stiff price, Mr. Simms?”  “Not at all! Not at all, sir! I ought to have placed the damages at three hundred!”  “I'll give you fifty dollars and call it square.”  “No, sir, a hundred and fifty! Not a penny less, not one penny! Look at my nose, sir--all scratched! And my ear! Not a penny less than one hundred and fifty dollars!” And the lawyer pounded on his desk with his fist.  “All right then, I'll pay you, but you must give me a receipt in full,”  answered the dude.  He had to wait until the bank opened, that he might cash a check, and then he paid over the amount demanded. The lawyer drew up a legal paper discharging him from all further obligations. Felix read it with care and stowed it in his pocket.  “And now let me give you some advice, Mr. Gussing,” said the lawyer, after the transaction was concluded. “Don't drive such a wild horse again.”  “Depend upon it, I never shall,” answered the dude. “It costs too much!”  he added, with a faint smile.  “Are you well acquainted with horses?”  “No.”  “Then you had better leave them alone altogether.”  “I have already made up my mind to do so.”    CHAPTER X.   DAVID BALL FROM MONTANA.   Finding that Joe could be depended upon, Mr. Mallison put him in charge of all of the boats at the hotel, so that our hero had almost as much work ashore as on the lake.  During the week following, the events just narrated, many visitors left the hotel and others came in. Among those to go were Felix Gussing and the two young ladies. The dude bid our hero a cordial good-bye, for he now knew Joe quite well.  “Good-bye, Mr. Gussing,” said Joe. “I hope we meet again.”  “Perhaps we shall, although I generally go to a different place each summer.”  “Well, I don't expect to stay in Riverside all my life.”  “I see. If you make a move, I hope you do well,” returned Felix.  On the day after the dude left, a man came to the hotel who, somehow, looked familiar to our hero. He came dressed in a light overcoat and a slouch hat, and carried a valise and a suit case.  “I've seen him before, but where?” Joe asked himself not once but several times.  The man registered as David Ball, and put down his address as Butte, Montana. He said he was a mining expert, but added that he was sick and the doctors had ordered him to come East for a rest.  “'ve heard of Riverside being a nice place,” said he, “so I came on right after striking Pittsburg.”  “We shall do all we can to make your stay a pleasant one,” said the hotel proprietor, politely.  “All I want is a nice sunny room, where I can get fresh air and take it easy,” said the man.  He was willing to pay a good price, and so obtained one of the best rooms in the house, one overlooking the river and the lake. He ate one meal in the dining room, but after that he had his meals sent to his apartment.  “Is he sick?” asked Joe, after watching the man one day.  “He certainly doesn't seem to be well,” answered Andrew Mallison.  “It runs in my mind that I have seen him before, but I can't place him,”  went on our hero.  “You must be mistaken, Joe. I questioned him and he says this is his first trip to the East, although he has frequently visited St. Louis and Chicago.”  On the following day the man called for a physician and Doctor Gardner was sent for.  “I've got pains here,” said the man from the West, and pointed to his chest. “Do you think I am getting consumption?”  The Riverside physician made a careful examination and then said the man had probably strained himself.  “Reckon I did,” was the ready answer. “I was in the mine and a big rock came down on me. I had to hold it up for ten minutes before anybody came to my aid. I thought I was a dead one sure.”  “I will give you some medicine and a liniment,” said the doctor. “Perhaps you'll feel better after a good rest.” And then he left.  That afternoon Joe had to go up into the hotel for something and passed the room of the new boarder. He saw the man standing by the window, gazing out on the water.  “I'm dead certain I've seen him before,” mused our hero. “It is queer I can't think where.”  Doctor Gardner wanted to be taken across the lake and Joe himself did the job. As he was rowing he asked about the man who had signed the hotel register as David Ball from Montana.  “Is he very sick, doctor?”  “No, I can't say that he is,” was the physician's answer. “He looks to be as healthy as you or I.”  “It's queer he keeps to his room.”  “Perhaps something happened out at his mine to unsettle his nerves. He told me of some sort of an accident.”  “Is he a miner?”  “He is a mine owner, so Mr. Mallison told me, but he never heard of the man before.”  The stranger received several letters the next day and then a telegram. Shortly after that he took to his bed.  “I am feeling worse,” said he to the bell boy who answered his ring. “I want you to send for that doctor again. Ask him to call about noon.”  “Yes, sir,” answered the boy, and Doctor Gardner was sent for without delay. He came and made another examination and left some medicine.  “I'll take the medicine regularly,” said the stranger, who was in bed. But when the doctor had left he quietly poured half of the contents of the bottle into the wash bowl, where it speedily drained from sight!  “Don't catch me drinking such rot,” he muttered to himself. “I'd rather have some good liquor any day,” and he took a long pull from a black bottle he had in his valise.  About noon a carriage drove up to the hotel and two men alighted.  One led the way into the hotel and asked to see the register.  “I'd like to see Mr. David Ball,” said he to the clerk.  “Mr. Ball is sick.”  “So I have heard and that is why I wish to see him.”  “I'll send up your card.”  “I don't happen to have a card. Tell him Mr. Anderson is here, from Philadelphia, with a friend of his.”  The message was sent to the sick man's room, and word came down that he would see the visitors in a few minutes.  “He says he is pretty sick and he can't talk business very long,” said the bell boy.  “We won't bother him very much,” answered the man who had given his name as Anderson.  Joe happened to be close by during this conversation and he looked the man called Anderson over with care.  “I've seen that man, too!” he declared to himself. “But where? I declare he is as much of a mystery as the sick one!”  Our hero's curiosity was now aroused to the highest pitch, and when the two men walked up to David Ball's room he followed to the very doorway.  “Come in,” came from the room, and a deep groan followed. On the bed lay the man from Montana, wrapped in several blankets and with a look of anguish on his features.  “Feeling pretty bad, eh?” said Anderson, as he stalked in. “I am downright sorry for you.”  “I'm afraid I am going to die,” groaned the man in bed. “The doctor says I am in bad shape. He wants me to take a trip to Europe, or somewhere else.”  “This is Mr. Maurice Vane,” went on Anderson. “We won't trouble you any more than is necessary, Mr. Ball.”  “I am sorry to disturb you,” said Maurice Vane. He was a kindly looking gentleman. “Perhaps we had better defer this business until some other time.”  “Oh, no, one time is as bad as another,” came with another groan from the bed. “Besides, I admit I need money badly. If it wasn't for that--“. The man in bed began to cough. “Say, shut the door,” he went on, to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/528"],["title","Joe the Hotel Boy; Or, Winning out (#8)"],["body","first man who had come in.  The door was closed, and for the time being Joe heard no more of the conversation.  It must be admitted that our hero was perplexed, and with good reason. He felt certain that the man in bed was shamming, that he was hardly sick at all. If so, what was his game?  “Something is surely wrong somewhere,” he reasoned. “I wish I could get to the bottom of it.”  The room next to the one occupied by David Ball was empty and he slipped into this. The room contained a closet, and on the other side was another closet, opening into the room the men were in. The partition between was of boards, and as the other door stood wide open, Joe, by placing his head to the boards, could hear fairly well.  “You have the stock?” he heard Maurice Vane ask.  “Yes, in my valise. Hand me the bag and I'll show you,” answered the man in bed. “Oh, how weak I feel!” he sighed.  There was a silence and then the rustling of papers.  “And what is your bottom price for these?” went on Maurice Vane.  “Thirty thousand dollars.”  “I told Mr. Vane you might possibly take twenty-five thousand,” came from the man called Anderson.  “They ought to be worth face value--fifty thousand dollars,” said the man in bed.  A talk in a lower tone followed, and then more rustling of papers.  “I will call to-morrow with the cash,” said Maurice Vane, as he prepared to leave. “In the meantime, you promise to keep these shares for me?”  “I'll keep them until noon. I've got another offer,” said the man in bed.  “We'll be back,” put in the man called Anderson. “So don't you sell to anybody else.”  Then the two visitors left and went downstairs. Five minutes later they were driving away in the direction of the railroad station.  “This certainly beats anything I ever met before,” said Joe, to himself as he watched them go. “I'll wager all I am worth that I've met that Anderson before, and that he is a bad man. I do wish I could get at the bottom of what is going on.”  In the evening he had occasion to go upstairs in the hotel once more. To his surprise he saw Mr. David Ball sitting in a rocking-chair, calmly smoking a cigar and reading a paper.  “He isn't as sick as he was this morning,” he mused. “In fact, I don't think he is sick at all.”  He wished to be on hand the following morning, when the strangers came back, but an errand took him up the lake. He had to stop at several places, and did not start on the return until four in the afternoon.  On his way back Joe went ashore close to where the old lodge was located, and something, he could not tell what, made him run over and take a look at the spot that had proved a shelter for Ned and himself during the heavy storm. How many things had occurred since that fatal day!  As our hero looked into one of the rooms he remembered the strange men he had seen there--the fellows who had talked about mining stocks. Then, of a sudden, a revelation came to him, like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.  “I've got it! I've got it!” he cried. “Mr. David Ball is that fellow who called himself Malone, and Anderson is the man named Caven! They are both imposters!”    CHAPTER XI.   A FRUITLESS CHASE.   The more Joe thought over the matter the more he became convinced that he was right. He remembered a good deal of the talk he had overheard during the storm, although such talk had, for the time being, been driven from his mind by the tragic death of old Hiram Bodley.  “If they are working some game what can this Maurice Vane have to do with it?” he asked himself.  He thought it best to get back to the hotel at once, and tell Mr. Mallison of his suspicions. But, as luck would have it, scarcely had he started to row his boat again when an oarlock broke, and so it took him the best part of an hour to make the trip.  “Where is Mr. Mallison?” he asked of the clerk of the hotel.  “Out in the stable, I believe,” was the answer.  Without waiting, our hero ran down to the stable and found the hotel proprietor inspecting some hay that had just been unloaded.  “I'd like to speak to you a moment, Mr. Mallison,” he said. “It's important,” and he motioned for the man to follow him.  “What is it, Joe?”  “It's about those men who called to see that sick man, and about the sick man, too.”  “He has gone--all of them have gone.”  “What!” ejaculated our hero. “The sick man, too?”  “Exactly. But he didn't go with the others. While they were here he was in bed, but right after they left he arose, dressed himself, and drove away.”  “Where did he go to?”  “I don't know.”  “Do you know what became of the other two men?”  “I do not. But what's up? Is there anything wrong?” questioned the hotel proprietor, with a look of concern on his face.  “I am afraid there is,” answered Joe, and told his tale from beginning to end.  “That's an odd sort of a yarn, Joe. It's queer you didn't recognize the men before.  “It is queer, sir, but I can't help that. It flashed over me just as I looked into the window of the old lodge.”  “You haven't made any mistake?”  “No, sir.”  “Humph!” Andrew Mallison mused for a moment. “I don't really see what I can do in the matter. We can't prove that those men are wrongdoers, can we?”  “Not unless they tried some game on this Mr. Maurice Vane.”  “They may have sold him some worthless mining shares. That sort of a trick is rather old.”  “I think we ought to make a search for this David Ball, or Malone, or whatever his name is.”  “I'm willing to do that.”  After questioning half a dozen people they learned that the pretended sick man had driven off in the direction of a village called Hopedale.  “What made him go there, do you think?” questioned Joe.  “I don't know, excepting that he thought of getting a train on the other line.”  A horse and buggy were procured, and in this Mr. Mallison and our hero drove over to Hopedale. They were still on the outskirts of the village when they heard a locomotive whistle.  “There's the afternoon train now!” cried Joe. “Perhaps it's the one he wants to catch.”  The horse was touched up and the buggy drove up to the railroad platform at breakneck speed. But the train was gone and all they could see of it was the last car as it swung around one of the mountain bends.  “Too late, Mr. Mallison!” sang out the station master. “If I had known ye was comin' I might have held her up a bit.”  “I didn't want the train, Jackson. Who got on board?”  “Two ladies, a man and a boy--Dick Fadder.”  “Did you know the man?”  “No.”  “What did he have with him?”  “A dress suit case.”  “Was he dressed in a dark blue suit and wear a slouch hat?” asked Joe.  “Yes, and had a light overcoat with him.”  “That was our man.”  “Anything wrong with him?” asked the station master.  “Perhaps,” answered the hotel proprietor. “Anyway, we wanted to see him. Did he buy a ticket?”  “Yes, to Snagtown.”  “What can he want in Snagtown?” asked Joe.  “Oh, that might have been a blind, Joe. He could easily go through to Philadelphia or some other place, if he wanted to.”  At first they thought of telegraphing ahead to stop the man, but soon gave that plan up. They had no evidence, and did not wish to make trouble unless they knew exactly what they were doing.  “I hope it turns out all right,” observed Andrew Mallison, when they were driving back to Riverside. “If there was a swindle it would give my hotel a black eye.”  “That's one reason why I wanted that man held,” answered Joe.  The next day and that following passed quietly, and our hero began to think that he had made a mistake and misjudged the men. He was kept very busy and so almost forgot the incident.  Among the new boarders was a fussy old man named Chaster, who was speedily nicknamed by the bell boys Chestnuts. He was a particular individual, and made everybody as uncomfortable as he possibly could.  One day Wilberforce Chaster--to use his full name,--asked Joe to take him out on the lake for a day's fishing. Our hero readily complied, and was in hot water from the time they went out until they returned. Nothing suited the old man, and as he caught hardly any fish he was exceedingly put out when he came back to the hotel.  “Your boatman is of no account,” he said to Andrew Mallison. “I have spent a miserable day,” and he stamped off to his room in high anger.  “It was not my fault, Mr. Mallison,” said Joe, with burning cheeks. “I did my level best by him.”  “That man has been making trouble for us ever since he come,” answered the hotel proprietor. “I am going to ask him to go elsewhere when his week is up.”  The insults that Joe had received that day from Wilberforce Chaster rankled in his mind, and he determined to square accounts with the boarder if he possibly could.  Towards evening he met a bell boy named Harry Ross who had also had trouble with Chaster, and the two talked the matter over.  “We ought to get square,” said Harry Ross. “I wish I could souse him with a pitcher of ice water.”  “I've got a plan,” said Joe.  Stopping at the hotel was a traveling doctor, who came to Riverside twice a year, for a stay of two weeks each time. He sold some patent medicines, and had in his room several skulls and also a skeleton strung on wires.  “That doctor is away,” said our hero. “I wonder if we can't smuggle the skulls and the skeleton into Mr. Chaster's room?”  “Just the cheese!” cried the bell boy, enthusiastically. “And let us rub the bones with some of those matches that glow in the dark!”  The plan was talked over, and watching their chance the two transferred the skeleton and the skulls to the apartment occupied by Wilberforce Chaster. Then they rubbed phosphorus on the bones, and hung them upon long strings, running over a doorway into the next room.  That evening Wilberforce Chaster remained in the hotel parlor until ten o 'clock. Then he marched off to his room in his usual ill humor. The gas was lit and he went to bed without delay.  As soon as the light went out and they heard the man retire, Joe and the bell boy began to groan in an ominous manner. As"]]]
