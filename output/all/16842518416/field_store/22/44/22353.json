She stood for a moment looking through the window, her long hair falling in a silky stream down her white shoulders, and the soft, dreamy look came into her eyes.  \"Is it true?\" she murmured. \"Am I really here at home with someone to love me--someone whom I can love? Or is it only a dream, and shall I wake in the cold bare room and find that I have still to endure the old life? No! It is no dream, it is true!\"  She wound up the long hair and went down to find that Mrs. Penfold had already prepared the table, her uncle standing beside and waiting with gentle impatience for her appearance.  He started as she entered, with a distinct feeling of renewed surprise; the relief from uncertainty as to her welcome, the kindness of her reception had already refreshed her, and her beauty shone out unclouded by doubt or nervousness.  The old man's eyes wandered with artistic approval over the graceful form and lovely face, and he was almost in the land of dreams again when Mrs. Penfold roused him by setting a chair at the table, and handing him a cobwebbed bottle and a corkscrew.  \"Miss Stella must be starving, sir!\" she said, suggestively.  \"Yes, yes,\" he assented, and both of them set to work exhorting and encouraging her to eat, as if they feared she might drop under the table with exhaustion unless she could be persuaded to eat of everything on the table.  Mr. Etheridge seemed to place great faith in the old port as a restorative, and had some difficulty in concealing his disappointment when Stella, after sipping the first glass, declined any more on the score that it was strong.  At last, but with visible reluctance, he accepted her assertion that she was rescued from any chance of starvation, and Mrs. Penfold cleared the table and left them alone.  A lamp stood on the table, but the moonbeams poured in through the window, and instinctively Stella drew near the window.  \"What a lovely place it is, uncle!\" she said.  He did not answer, he was watching her musingly, as she leant against the edge of the wall.  \"You must be very happy here.\"  \"Yes,\" he murmured, dreamily. \"Yes, and you think you will be, Stella.\"  \"Ah, yes,\" she answered, in a low voice, and with a low sigh. \"Happier than I can say.\"  \"You will not feel it lonely, shut up with an old man, a dreamer, who has parted with the world and almost forgotten it?\"  \"No, no! a thousand times no!\" was the reply.  He wandered to the fireplace and took up his pipe, but with a sudden glance at her laid it down again. Slight as was the action she saw it, and with the graceful, lithe movement which he had noticed, she glided across the room and took up the pipe.  \"You were going to smoke, uncle.\"  \"No, no,\" he said, eagerly. \"No, a mere habit----\"  She interrupted him with a smile, and filled the pipe for him with her taper little fingers, and gave it to him.  \"You do not want me to wish that I had not come to you uncle?\"  \"Heaven forbid!\" he said, simply.  \"Then you must not alter anything in your life; you must go on as if I had never dropped from the clouds to be a burden upon you.\"  \"My child!\" he murmured, reproachfully.  \"Or to make you uncomfortable. I could not bear that, uncle.\"  \"No, no!\" he said, \"I will alter nothing, Stella; we will be happy, you and I.\"  \"Very happy,\" she murmured, softly.  He wandered to the window, and stood looking out; and, unseen by him, she drew a chair up and cleared it of the litter, and unconsciously he sat down.  Then she glided to and fro, wandering round the room noiselessly, looking at the curious lumber, and instinctively picking up the books and putting them in something like order on the almost empty shelves.  Every now and then she took up one of the pictures which stood with their faces to the wall, and her gaze would wander from it to the painter sitting in the moonlight, his white hair falling on his shoulders, his thin, nervous hands clasped on his knee.  She, who had spent her life in the most artistic city of the world, knew that he was a great painter, and, child-woman as she was, wondered why the world permitted him to remain unknown and unnoticed. She had yet to learn that he cared as little for fame as he did for wealth, and to be allowed to live for his art and dream in peace was all he asked from the world in which he lived but in which he took no part. Presently she came back to the window, and stood beside him; he started slightly and put out his hand, and she put her thin white one into it. The moon rose higher in the heavens, and the old man raised his other hand and pointed to it in silence.  As he did so, Stella saw glide into the scene--as it was touched by the moonbeams--a large white building rearing above the trees on the hill-top, and she uttered an exclamation of surprise.  \"What house is that, uncle? I had no idea one was there until this moment!\"  \"That is Wyndward Hall, Stella,\" he replied, dreamily; \"it was hidden by the shadow and the clouds.\"  \"What a grand place!\" she murmured. \"Who lives there uncle?\"  \"The Wyndwards,\" he answered, in the same musing tone, \"the Wyndwards. They have lived there for hundreds of years, Stella. Yes, it is a grand place.\"  \"We should call it a palace in Italy, uncle.\"  \"It is a palace in England, but we are more modest. They are contented to call it the Hall. An old place and an old race.\"  \"Tell me about them,\" she said, quietly. \"Do you know them--are they friends of yours?\"  \"I know them. Yes, they are friends, as far as there be any friendship between a poor painter and the Lord of Wyndward. Yes, we are friends; they call them proud, but they are not too proud to ask James Etheridge to dinner occasionally; and they accuse him of pride because he declines to break the stillness of his life by accepting their hospitality. Look to the left there, Stella. As far as you can see stretch the lands of Wyndward--they run for miles between the hills there.\"  \"They have some reason to be proud,\" she murmured, with a smile. \"But I like them because they are kind to you.\"  He nodded.  \"Yes, the earl would be more than kind, I think----\"  \"The earl?\"  \"Yes, Lord Wyndward, the head of the family; the Lord of Wyndward they call him. They have all been called Lords of Wyndward by the people here, who look up to them as if they were something more than human.\"  \"And does he live there alone?\" she asked, gazing at the gray stone mansion glistening in the moonlight.  \"No, there is a Lady Wyndward, and a daughter--poor girl.\"  \"Why do you say poor girl?\" asked Stella.  \"Because all the wealth of the race would not make her otherwise than an object of tender pity. She is an invalid; you see that window--the one with the light in it?\"  \"Yes,\" Stella said.  \"That is the window of her room; she lies there on a sofa, looking down the valley all the day!\"     CHAPTER II.   \"Poor girl!\" murmured Stella. There was silence for a moment. \"And those three live there all alone?\" she said.  \"Not always,\" he replied, musingly. \"Sometimes, not often, the son Leycester comes down. He is Viscount Trevor.\"  \"The son,\" said Stella. \"And what is he like?\"  The question seemed to set some train of thought in action; the old man relapsed into silence for a few minutes. Then suddenly but gently he rose, and going to the other end of the room, fetched a picture from amongst several standing against the wall, and held it toward her.  \"That is Lord Leycester,\" he said.  Stella took the canvas in her hand, and held it to the light, and an exclamation broke involuntarily from her lips.  \"How beautiful he is!\"  The old man took the picture from her, and resting it on his knees, gazed at it musingly.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"it is a grand face; one does not see such a face often.\"  Stella leant over the chair and looked at it with a strange feeling of interest and curiosity, such as no simply beautiful picture would have aroused.  It was not the regularity of the face, with its clear-cut features and its rippling chestnut hair, that, had it been worn by a Wyndward of a hundred years ago, would have fallen in rich curls upon the square, well-formed shoulders. It was not the beauty of the face, but a something indefinable in the carriage of the head and the expression of the full, dark eyes that attracted, almost fascinated, her.  It was in a voice almost hushed by the indescribable effect produced by the face, that she said:  \"And he is like that?\"  \"It is lifelike,\" he answered. \"I, who painted it, should not say it, but it is like him nevertheless--that is Leycester Wyndward. Why did you ask?\"  Stella hesitated.  \"Because--I scarcely know. It is such a strange face, uncle. The eyes--what is it in the eyes that makes me almost unable to look away from them?\"  \"The reflection of a man's soul, Stella,\" he said.  It was a strange answer, and the girl looked down at the strange face interrogatively.  \"The reflection of a man's soul, Stella. The Wyndwards have always been a wild, reckless, passionate race; here, in this village, they have innumerable legends of the daring deeds of the lords of Wyndward. Murder, rapine, and high-handed tyranny in the olden times, wild license and desperate profligacy in these modern ones; but of all the race this Leycester Wyndward is the wildest and most heedless. Look at him, Stella, you see him here in his loose shooting-jacket, built by Poole; with the diamond pin in his irreproachable scarf, with his hair cut to the regulation length: I see him in armor with his sword upraised to watch the passionate fire of his eyes. There is a picture in the great gallery up yonder of one of the Wyndwards clad just so, in armor of glittering steel, with one foot on the body of a prostrate foe, one hand upraised to strike the death-dealing blow of his battle-ax. Yes, Leycester Wyndward should have lived four centuries back.\"  Stella smiled.  \"Has he committed many murders, uncle, burnt down many villages?\"  The old man started and looked up at the exquisite face, with its"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5342"],["title","The Story Girl (#0)"],["body","STORY GIRL  By L.

THE HOME OF OUR FATHERS  “I do like a road, because you can be always wondering what is at the end of it.”  The Story Girl said that once upon a time. Felix and I, on the May morning when we left Toronto for Prince Edward Island, had not then heard her say it, and, indeed, were but barely aware of the existence of such a person as the Story Girl. We did not know her at all under that name. We knew only that a cousin, Sara Stanley, whose mother, our Aunt Felicity, was dead, was living down on the Island with Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia King, on a farm adjoining the old King homestead in Carlisle. We supposed we should get acquainted with her when we reached there, and we had an idea, from Aunt Olivia’s letters to father, that she would be quite a jolly creature. Further than that we did not think about her. We were more interested in Felicity and Cecily and Dan, who lived on the homestead and would therefore be our roofmates for a season.  But the spirit of the Story Girl’s yet unuttered remark was thrilling in our hearts that morning, as the train pulled out of Toronto. We were faring forth on a long road; and, though we had some idea what would be at the end of it, there was enough glamour of the unknown about it to lend a wonderful charm to our speculations concerning it.  We were delighted at the thought of seeing father’s old home, and living among the haunts of his boyhood. He had talked so much to us about it, and described its scenes so often and so minutely, that he had inspired us with some of his own deep-seated affection for it--an affection that had never waned in all his years of exile. We had a vague feeling that we, somehow, belonged there, in that cradle of our family, though we had never seen it. We had always looked forward eagerly to the promised day when father would take us “down home,” to the old house with the spruces behind it and the famous “King orchard” before it--when we might ramble in “Uncle Stephen’s Walk,” drink from the deep well with the Chinese roof over it, stand on “the Pulpit Stone,” and eat apples from our “birthday trees.”  The time had come sooner than we had dared to hope; but father could not take us after all. His firm asked him to go to Rio de Janeiro that spring to take charge of their new branch there. It was too good a chance to lose, for father was a poor man and it meant promotion and increase of salary; but it also meant the temporary breaking up of our home. Our mother had died before either of us was old enough to remember her; father could not take us to Rio de Janeiro. In the end he decided to send us to Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet down on the homestead; and our housekeeper, who belonged to the Island and was now returning to it, took charge of us on the journey. I fear she had an anxious trip of it, poor woman! She was constantly in a quite justifiable terror lest we should be lost or killed; she must have felt great relief when she reached Charlottetown and handed us over to the keeping of Uncle Alec. Indeed, she said as much.  “The fat one isn’t so bad. He isn’t so quick to move and get out of your sight while you’re winking as the thin one. But the only safe way to travel with those young ones would be to have ‘em both tied to you with a short rope--a MIGHTY short rope.”  “The fat one” was Felix, who was very sensitive about his plumpness. He was always taking exercises to make him thin, with the dismal result that he became fatter all the time. He vowed that he didn’t care; but he DID care terribly, and he glowered at Mrs. MacLaren in a most undutiful fashion. He had never liked her since the day she had told him he would soon be as broad as he was long.  For my own part, I was rather sorry to see her going; and she cried over us and wished us well; but we had forgotten all about her by the time we reached the open country, driving along, one on either side of Uncle Alec, whom we loved from the moment we saw him. He was a small man, with thin, delicate features, close-clipped gray beard, and large, tired, blue eyes--father’s eyes over again. We knew that Uncle Alec was fond of children and was heart-glad to welcome “Alan’s boys.” We felt at home with him, and were not afraid to ask him questions on any subject that came uppermost in our minds. We became very good friends with him on that twenty-four mile drive.  Much to our disappointment it was dark when we reached Carlisle--too dark to see anything very distinctly, as we drove up the lane of the old King homestead on the hill. Behind us a young moon was hanging over southwestern meadows of spring-time peace, but all about us were the soft, moist shadows of a May night. We peered eagerly through the gloom.  “There’s the big willow, Bev,” whispered Felix excitedly, as we turned in at the gate.  There it was, in truth--the tree Grandfather King had planted when he returned one evening from ploughing in the brook field and stuck the willow switch he had used all day in the soft soil by the gate.  It had taken root and grown; our father and our uncles and aunts had played in its shadow; and now it was a massive thing, with a huge girth of trunk and great spreading boughs, each of them as large as a tree in itself.  “I’m going to climb it to-morrow,” I said joyfully.  Off to the right was a dim, branching place which we knew was the orchard; and on our left, among sibilant spruces and firs, was the old, whitewashed house--from which presently a light gleamed through an open door, and Aunt Janet, a big, bustling, sonsy woman, with full-blown peony cheeks, came to welcome us.  Soon after we were at supper in the kitchen, with its low, dark, raftered ceiling from which substantial hams and flitches of bacon were hanging. Everything was just as father had described it. We felt that we had come home, leaving exile behind us.  Felicity, Cecily, and Dan were sitting opposite us, staring at us when they thought we would be too busy eating to see them. We tried to stare at them when THEY were eating; and as a result we were always catching each other at it and feeling cheap and embarrassed.  Dan was the oldest; he was my age--thirteen. He was a lean, freckled fellow with rather long, lank, brown hair and the shapely King nose. We recognized it at once. His mouth was his own, however, for it was like to no mouth on either the King or the Ward side; and nobody would have been anxious to claim it, for it was an undeniably ugly one--long and narrow and twisted. But it could grin in friendly fashion, and both Felix and I felt that we were going to like Dan.  Felicity was twelve. She had been called after Aunt Felicity, who was the twin sister of Uncle Felix. Aunt Felicity and Uncle Felix, as father had often told us, had died on the same day, far apart, and were buried side by side in the old Carlisle graveyard.  We had known from Aunt Olivia’s letters, that Felicity was the beauty of the connection, and we had been curious to see her on that account. She fully justified our expectations. She was plump and dimpled, with big, dark-blue, heavy-lidded eyes, soft, feathery, golden curls, and a pink and white skin--“the King complexion.” The Kings were noted for their noses and complexion. Felicity had also delightful hands and wrists. At every turn of them a dimple showed itself. It was a pleasure to wonder what her elbows must be like.  She was very nicely dressed in a pink print and a frilled muslin apron; and we understood, from something Dan said, that she had “dressed up”  in honour of our coming. This made us feel quite important. So far as we knew, no feminine creatures had ever gone to the pains of dressing up on our account before.  Cecily, who was eleven, was pretty also--or would have been had Felicity not been there. Felicity rather took the colour from other girls. Cecily looked pale and thin beside her; but she had dainty little features, smooth brown hair of satin sheen, and mild brown eyes, with just a hint of demureness in them now and again. We remembered that Aunt Olivia had written to father that Cecily was a true Ward--she had no sense of humour. We did not know what this meant, but we thought"]]]
