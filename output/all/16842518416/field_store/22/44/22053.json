[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5259"],["title","Hildegarde's Neighbors (#3)"],["body",", sunny sitting-room, into which they were ushered by a pleasant-faced maid, low bookcases ran all round the walls, and were not only filled, but heaped with books, the volumes lying in piles along the top. The centre-table was a magazine-stand, where Saint Nicholas and The Century, The Forum and The Scientific American jostled each other in friendly rivalry. Mrs. Merryweather sat in a low chair, with her lap full of books, and had some difficulty in rising to receive her visitors. Her hearty welcome assured them that they had not come a day too soon, as Mrs. Grahame feared.  \"My dear lady, no! I am charmed to see you. Bell has had such pleasure in making friends with your daughter. Miss Grahame, I am delighted to see you!\" and Mrs. Merryweather held out what she thought was her hand, but Hildegarde shook instead a small morocco volume, and was well content when she saw that it was the \"Golden Treasury.\"  \"Bell has had such pleasure that I have been most anxious to share it, and to know you and your daughter. Shall we be neighbourly? I am the most unceremonious person in the world. Dear me! isn't there a chair without books on it? Here, my dear Mrs. Grahame, sit down here, pray! It is Dr. Johnson himself who makes room for you, and you must excuse the great man for being slow in his movements.\"  With a merry smile, she offered the chair from which she had just removed a huge folio dictionary. Hildegarde found an ottoman which she could easily share with a volume of Punch, and Mrs. Merryweather beamed at them over her spectacles, and said again that she was delighted to see them.  \"We are getting the books to rights gradually,\" she said, \"but it takes time, as you see. I have to do this myself, with Bell's help. She will be down in a moment, my dear. We have established an overflow bookcase in a cupboard upstairs, and she has just gone up with a load. Ah! here she is. Bell, my dear, Mrs. and Miss Grahame. So kind of them to come and see us!\"  Bell shook hands warmly, her frank, pleasant face shining with good-will. \"I am so glad to see you!\" she cried, sitting down by Hildegarde on a pile of Punches. \"I hoped you would come to-day, even if the books are not in order yet. They are so dear, the books; they are part of the family, and we want to be sure that they have places they like. I suppose Punch ought by rights to go with people of his own sort--if there is anybody!--but one wants him close at hand, don't you think so? where one can take him up any time,--when it rains, or when things bother one. Do you remember that Leech picture?\" and they babbled of Punch, their beloved, for ten minutes, and liked each other better at every one of the ten.  \"Bell, I want Mrs. and Miss Grahame to see our other children,\" said Mrs. Merryweather, presently. \"Where is Toots, and where are the boys?\"  \"Toots is upstairs, poor lamb!\" Bell replied. \"When Mary came to tell me of our visitors' arrival I was just putting away Sibbes's 'Soul's Conflict,' and various other dreadful persons whom you would not let me burn; so I dumped them in Toots's arms, and ran off and left her. Being a ''bedient old soul,' she is probably standing just where I left her. I will go--\"  But at this moment Toots appeared,--a girl of fifteen, tall, shy and blushing, and was introduced as \"my daughter Gertrude.\" She confessed, on interrogation, that she had dropped Sibbes's \"Soul's Conflict\" out of the window, and was on her way to pick it up.  \"Why didn't you drop it down the well?\" asked her sister. \"It is so dry, I am sure a wetting would do it good!\"  \"Sit down, my dear!\" said Mrs. Merryweather, comfortably. \"One of the boys is sure to be about, and will bring in the book. Sibbes IS a little dry, Bell, but very sound writing, much sounder than a good deal of the controversial writing of--bless me! what's that?\"  Something resembling a human wheel had revolved swiftly past the window, emitting unearthly cries.  Hildegarde blushed and hesitated. \"I--I think it was your brother Obadiah,\" she said to Bell.  The latter stared, open-eyed. \"My brother Obadiah?\" she repeated. \"How did you know--I beg your pardon! but why do you say Obadiah?\"  Hildegarde glanced at her mother, who was laughing openly. \"You will have to make full confession, Hilda,\" she said. \"I do not think Mrs. Merryweather will be very severe with you.\"  \"It is a dreadful thing to confess,\" said Hildegarde, laughing and blushing. \"I--to tell the truth, I happened to be walking in our garden, on the other side of the tall hedge, just when you drove up, the other day; and--there is a most convenient little peep-hole, and I wanted to see our new neighbours, and--and--I peeped! Are you much shocked, Mrs. Merryweather? I heard several names,--Bell, and Toots, and--I--I heard the handsome red-haired boy called Obadiah.\"  The Merryweathers laughed merrily, and Mrs. Merryweather was about to speak, when a voice was heard in the hall, chanting in a singular, nasal key,--      \"Dropsy dropped a book,      And she's going to be shook!      Dropsy dropped a volume,      Which makes her very solume!\"  The door was pushed open, and the handsome red-haired boy entered, walking on his hands, holding aloft between his feet the missing \"Soul's Conflict.\"  \"My son Gerald,\" said Mrs. Merryweather, with a wicked smile. \"Gerald, my love, Mrs. and Miss Grahame.\"  If Hildegarde was crimson (and she undoubtedly was), Gerald Merryweather was brilliant scarlet when he rose to his feet and saluted the strangers; but he was also atwinkle with laughter, the whole lithe, graceful body of him seeming to radiate fun. One glance at Bell, another at Hildegarde, and the whole party broke into peal on peal of merriment.  \"How do you do?\" said Scarlet to Crimson, holding out a strong brown hand, and gripping hers cordially. \"Awfully glad! Please excuse me, Mrs. Grahame, for coming in like that. I thought there was no one here but the mother, and she is as used to one end of me as the other.\"  \"So you are Gerald, and not Obadiah.\" said Mrs. Grahame. \"I congratulate you on the prettier name.\"  \"Oh, Ferguson calls me Obadiah!\" said Gerald, laughing again. \"He's the other of me, you know. Beg pardon! you don't know, perhaps. We are twins, Ferguson and I.\"  \"And Ferguson, my dear Mrs. Grahame,\" interposed Mrs. Merryweather, \"is my son Philip. Why these boys cannot call each other by their rightful names is a family mystery; but so it is.\"  \"Is your brother Fer--Philip like you?\" asked Hildegarde, feeling sure that he was not, as the other boy she had seen certainly had not red hair.  \"Not a bit!\" replied Gerald, cheerfully. \"No resemblance, I believe. 'Beauty and the Beast' we call each other, too. Sometimes I am Beauty, and more times I am the Beast; depends on which has had his hair cut last.\"  \"Or brushed,\" said Bell, glancing at the curly hair, which was certainly in rather a wild condition.  \"Oh, yes! beg pardon!\" said Gerald, glancing ruefully at the mirror, and running his hand through his curly mop.  \"Beast this time, and no mistake. Grass rather long, you see, and tore my locks of gold. Happy thought! Desiring to tear your hair in sorrow, walk on hands through long grass; effect admirable. Wonder Hamlet never tried it!\"  \"Hamlet's hair was black,\" said Toots, seriously.  \"And therefore he could not walk on his hands,\" said Gerald. \"I see! Dropsy, you are a genius; that's the trouble with you.\"  A long gray leg appeared at the open window, and after waving wildly for a moment, disappeared suddenly.  \"Ferguson!\" said Gerald, turning to Hildegarde. \"His mountain way! Becoming aware of your presence, he has retired, to reverse legs, and will shortly reappear, fondly hoping that you did not see him before.\"  Sure enough, in a few moments another tall boy entered, looking preternaturally grave, with his hair scrupulously smooth.  \"Been upstairs, you see,\" said the irrepressible Gerald, \"and slicked himself all up. Quite the Beauty, Fergs.\"  \"Gerald, do be quiet!\" said Mrs. Merryweather. \"This is Philip, my other twin boy, Mrs. Grahame.\"  Philip greeted Hildegarde and her mother with grave courtesy, taking no notice of his brother's gibes.  \"You find us in a good deal of confusion,\" he said to Hildegarde, sitting down on a table, the only available seat. \"It takes a long time to get settled, don't you think so?\"  \"Oh--yes!\" said Hildegarde, struggling for composure, and conscious of Gerald's eyes fixed intently on her. \"But you all look so home-like and comfortable here.\"  \"Especially Ferguson!\" broke in Gerald, sotto voce. \"How comfortable he looks, doesn't he, Miss Grahame? No use, Fergs! We marked your little footprints in the air, my son.\"  \"Oh!\" said Philip, looking much discomposed. \"Well, I'll punch your head, Obe, anyhow.\"  \"Suppose we come out and look at the tennis-court,\" said Bell. \"I am sure you play tennis, Miss Grahame.\"  \"Indeed I do,\" said Hildegarde, heartily. \"I have often looked longingly at that nice smooth lawn, and I hoped you were going to lay it out for a court.\"  \"Phil,\" said Gertrude aside to her brother, who was still blushing and uncomfortable, \"you needn't mind a bit. Jerry came in walking on his hands, right into the room, before he saw them at all; and they are so nice, they didn't care; they liked it.\"  \"Did they?\" said Phil, also in a whisper. \"Well, that's some comfort; but I'll punch his head for him, all the same.\"  And Gerald cried aloud,--  \"Away, away to the mountain's brow, For Ferguson glares like an angry cow. He'll punch my head, and kill me dead, Before I have time to say 'Bow-wow.'\"  And the five young people went off laughing to the tennis-court.     CHAPTER IV.  HESTER'S PLAYROOM.   \"'THAR!' said the Deacon. 'Naow she'll dew!'\"  Hildegarde spoke in a tone of satisfaction, as she looked about her room. She had been setting it to rights,--not that it was ever \"to wrongs\" for any length of time,--for Bell and Gertrude Merryweather were coming to spend the morning with her, and she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5259"],["title","Hildegarde's Neighbors (#4)"],["body","her own special sanctum to look its best. She was very fond of this large, bare, airy chamber, with its polished floor, its white wainscoting, and its quaint blue-dragon paper. She had made it into a picture gallery, and just now it was a flower-show, too; for every available vase and bowl was filled with flowers from wood and garden. On the round table stood a huge Indian jar of pale green porcelain, filled with nodding purple iris; the green glass bowls held double buttercups and hobble-bush sprays, while two portraits, those of Dundee and William the Silent, were wreathed in long garlands of white hawthorn. The effect was charming, and Hildegarde might well look satisfied. But Bell Merryweather, when she came into the room, thought that its owner was the most beautiful part of it. Hildegarde was used to herself, as she would have said frankly; she knew she was pretty, and it was pleasant to be pretty, and there was an end of it. But to Bell, in whose family either brown locks or red were the rule, this white and gold maiden, with her cool, fresh tints of pearl and rose, was something wonderful. Hildegarde's dress this morning was certainly nothing astonishing, simply a white cambric powdered with buttercups; but its perfect freshness, its trim simplicity, made it so absolutely the fit and proper thing, that Bell's honest heart did homage to the lovely vision; there was something almost like reverence in her eyes as she returned Hildegarde's cordial greeting. As for the young Gertrude, all the world was fairyland to her, and Hildegarde was the queen, opening the door of a new province. The most important thing in life was not to fall or drop anything on this first visit to the strange and wonderful old house, as all the Merryweathers persisted in calling Braeside. Gertrude was always falling and dropping things. At home nobody expected anything else; but here it was different, and the poor child was conscious of every finger and toe as she stepped along gingerly. Gerald's parting words were still ringing in her ears:  \"When you feel that you must fall down, Dropsy, be careful not to fall into shelves of china,--that's all. Bookcases are the best things to fall into, you'll find; and a book is the best thing to drop, too, my poor child. When you feel the fit coming on, put down the teacup and grab a dictionary; then choose the toe you want it to fall on,--superfluous aunt of the family, or some one of that sort,--and you are all right. Bless you, Dropsy! Farewell, my dear!\"  Hildegarde took the girls directly up to her room, and they admired all her arrangements as heartily as she could wish. Bell exclaimed with amazement at the size of the room.  \"To have all this for your own, your castle and defence,\" she cried. \"What would the girls at college say if they could see such a room as this, and one girl living in it! Twelve by fourteen is our rule, and two girls to that.\"  \"Dear me!\" said Hildegarde. \"Why, I couldn't live without room.\"  \"Oh yes, you could!\" said Bell, laughing. \"One gets used to everything. It's rather good fun seeing how closely one can pack. We have sixty-five pictures in our room, my chum and I. Oh, you have my William! I didn't know anyone else had just exactly that portrait.\"  \"Your William, indeed!\" cried Hildegarde, laughing. \"Why, he is mine, my very own, and no one ever began to love him as I do.\"  The two girls fell into a friendly discussion, and ran lightly over the history of the Netherlands, with occasional excursions to Italy, the Highlands, or the south of France, as one picture or another claimed their attention. Hildegarde was enjoying herself immensely, and did the honours with ardour, delighted to find that the \"college girl\" knew all about the things she loved, without being in the least bookish or prosy.  \"I thought you would be 'primmed up with majestic pride,'\" she said, laughing. \"I was frightened when your little brother said you were at college, and I instantly saw you with spectacles, and pale, lank hair done up in a bob on the top of your head. And then--then you came over the top of the fence, looking like--like----\"  \"Like what?\" said Bell. \"I insist upon knowing.\"  \"You are sure you don't mind?\" asked Hildegarde, as Bell herself had asked the day before. \"You looked like an apple,--so exactly like a nice red and white Benoni I was sure you must be good to eat. Oh, I am so glad you came!\"  \"So am I!\" said Bell.  \"Do you think we might drop the 'Miss' part?\" inquired Hildegarde, \"or are you too dignified?\"  \"Apples must not stand on dignity,\" replied Bell, gravely. \"But I have wanted to say 'Hildegarde' ever since I came into this room, because the name just fits the room--and you.\"  At this point Gertrude, who had forgotten her destiny in the joy of pictures, and was backing round the walls in silent ecstasy, saw--or rather did not see--her opportunity, and fell quietly downstairs. One special feature of Hildegarde's room was the staircase, her own private staircase, of which she was immensely proud. It was a narrow, winding stair, very steep and crooked, leading to the ground floor. When Gertrude disappeared down this gulf with a loud crash, Hildegarde was much alarmed, and flew to the rescue, followed more leisurely by Bell.  \"Are you much hurt, my dear?\" cried Hildegarde. \"Wait till I come and pick you up, poor child!\"  \"Oh no!\" replied Gertrude, softly, from the foot of the stairs, where she lay doubled up against the door. \"Thank you, but I never hurt myself. I hope I haven't hurt the stairs.\"  Bell came along, laughing. \"Dear Dropsy!\" she said. \"Here, come up! She really never does hurt herself,\" she added, in response to Hildegarde's look of astonishment. \"She falls about so much, and has done so since she was a baby, that she keeps in training, I suppose, and her joints and bones are all supple and elastic. This was a good one, though! Sure you are not bruised, little girl?\"  Gertrude picked herself up, declining assistance, and maintained stoutly that she was sound in wind and limb. \"If only I did not break anything,\" she said, anxiously. \"I came a terrible crack against the panel here, and it seemed as if something gave as I fell past it.\"  Bell bent down, in spite of Hildegarde's assurance that everything was right, and passed her hand along the wall of the staircase. \"There is no crack,\" she said. \"I think it is all right, Toots.\" She tapped the panel critically. \"The wall is hollow here,\" she said. \"Is this your secret chamber, Hildegarde?\"  \"Hollow?\" cried Hildegarde. \"What do you mean, Bell? I know of no hollow place there.\"  \"Have you ever looked for one?\" Bell inquired. \"Search would reveal something in there, I am pretty sure.\"  Thrilled with curiosity, Hildegarde came down, and the three girls crouched together on the narrow stair, and tapped and rapped here and there. Beyond a doubt, one panel was hollow. What could it mean?  Bell meditated. \"What is on the other side of this place?\" she asked.  \"I--don't know,\" said Hildegarde. \"Stop a moment, though! It must be,--yes, it is! The old chimney, the great square stack, comes near this place. Can there be any space--\"  \"Then it IS a secret chamber, most likely,\" said Bell. \"I have heard of such things. Shall we try?\"  They tried eagerly, pressing here, pushing there, but for some time in vain. At length, as Hildegarde's strong fingers pressed hard on one spot of moulding, she felt it quiver. There was a faint sound, like a murmur of protest; then slowly, unwillingly, the panel moved, obedient to the insistent fingers, and slid aside, revealing a square opening into--the blackness of darkness.  \"Oh, it's a dungeon!\" cried Gertrude, starting back. \"Perhaps the floor will give way, and let us down into places with knives and scythes. You remember 'The Dumberdene,' Bell?\"  \"No fear, Gertrude,\" said Hildegarde. \"Nothing more horrible than the dining-room is under our feet. But this,--this is very mysterious. Can you see anything, Bell?\"  \"I begin to get a faint glimmer,\" said Bell. \"Of course, if it is a chimney-room there cannot be any particular light. Shall we creep in? There is evidently a good deal of space.\"  \"By all means,\" cried Hildegarde. \"But let me go first, to bear the brunt of any horrors there may be. Spiders I would not face, but they must all be dead years ago.\"  She crept in on her hands and knees, closely followed by the two Merryweathers. Growing accustomed to the dimness, they found themselves in a small square chamber, high enough for them to stand upright. The walls were smooth, and thick with dust; the floor was carpeted with something that felt soft and close, like an Eastern rug.  \"We simply MUST have light!\" cried Hildegarde. \"Wait, girls! I will bring a candle and matches.\"  \"No! no!\" cried Bell. \"Wait a moment! I think I have found a window, or something like one, if I can only get it open.\"  Again there was a soft, complaining sound, and then a sliding movement; a tiny panel was pushed aside, and a feeble ray of light stole in. The girls' faces glimmered white against the blackness.  \"Something obstructs the light,\" said Hildegarde. \"See! this is it.\" She put her arm out through the little opening, and pushed away a dense mass of vines that hung down like a thick curtain. \"That is better,\" she said. \"Now let us see where we are.\"  It was a curious place, surely, to lie hidden in the heart of a comparatively modern house. A square room, perhaps eight feet across, neatly papered with the blue-dragon paper of Hildegarde's own room; on the floor an old rug, faded to a soft, nameless hue, but soft and fine. On the walls hung a few pictures, quaint little coloured wood-cuts in gilt frames, representing ladies and gentlemen in scant gowns and high-shouldered frock-coats. There were two little chairs, painted blue, with roses on the backs; a low table, and a tiny chest of drawers. The girls looked at each other, a new light dawning in their faces.  \"It is a doll's room,\""]]]
