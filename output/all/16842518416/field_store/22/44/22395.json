European cartographers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries seem to have known and cared little about the relative positions of places in Asia; as Italian merchants by this time had established contacts with the Mongols in southern Russia, what was more natural than to place the Mongol overlord’s tomb in the hinterland of the Black Sea? Here there was more available space than in the Far East, and here on Leardo’s map the Grand Khan’s tomb could be made symmetrically to balance Prester John’s palace across the map in Africa (299).  South of the sepulcher we see the River Volga (6, 7) flowing into the northwestern corner of the Caspian (250). A branch from the east (8), perhaps the Kama, joins the Volga where the latter bends at a right angle to the south. East of the lower Volga is a “desert of thirty days” (10), Polo’s mysterious demon-haunted desert of Lop, where the traveler hears ringing bells and other uncanny sounds (possibly “singing sands”). Like the Grand Khan’s tomb, this desert is also wofully misplaced, since the actual desert of Lop lies in eastern Chinese Turkestan. The responsibility is not Leardo’s, however, for the Lop desert is in the same place on the Catalan Atlas of 1375 and on the Este map.  Farther east, beyond a row of six castles representing towns on the borderlands of China (35-40), we come to a gulf of the encircling ocean and to a great system of mountains. The gulf (11), which contains three islands, appears in almost the same position and form on the Este map, where there is a legend explaining that on the islands griffons and falcons are found and that the natives are not allowed to kill them without the permission of the Grand Khan of the Tatars. This is also from Marco Polo, who writes that the islands where the gerfalcons are bred lie so far north that the North Star is left behind you in the south! The mountains southeast of the gulf make an enclosure shaped something like a θ (42-47). Inside the northern half of this θ a legend tells us that “this is the province of Gog and Magog, where many tribes of the Jews were shut in” (70), referring to the medieval tradition that Alexander the Great enclosed Gog and Magog—the terrible hordes of Antichrist—within the Caspian Mountains. On many maps the mountains of Gog and Magog in the Far East are named thus. Leardo, however, places “M^o Gaspio” (Caspiae Montes) (4) north of the Caspian Sea somewhat nearer the position at which Ptolemy had placed them. To the mountains of Gog and Magog he assigns names derived from Ptolemy’s northeastern Asia. Running westward from the southern basin formed by these mountains Leardo has added a river (49), the Oechardes of Ptolemy. Near the point where this river emerges from the mountain rim we see a red spot labeled “Iron gate” (72) and, immediately to the west, two short red marks, “Statues of Alexander” (73). The iron gate was built by Alexander in the wall enclosing Gog and Magog, and the statues represent trumpeters set up by Alexander to keep guard over these unclean hordes. On the Catalan maps the trumpeters themselves are shown with their trumpets.  Immediately west of the statues appears “Mount Tanacomedo” (48), an amusing instance of Leardo’s carelessness; he has here evidently copied “Montana Comedorum” from a Ptolemaic map, combining the last part of the first word with the first part of the last! At the extreme eastern edge of the world disk we see the Terrestrial Paradise (63) surrounded by an enormous wall to keep out curious intruders. The River Indus flows southwestward to a great delta near the entrance of the Persian Gulf (84). Many of the place names in India correspond with those of the Catalan maps and in turn were derived from Marco Polo. The scene of St. Thomas’ mission and of the early introduction of Christianity into India is indicated by the inscription: “Here preached St. Thomas” (113).  In central Asia, we note two rivers entering the eastern side of the Caspian Sea, the Jaxartes (117) and Oxus (118). The Lake of Aral, in which these great streams actually have their outlet, seems to have been wholly unknown to the geographers both of antiquity and of medieval Europe. Moslem scholars, however, were aware of its existence. Leardo’s castles of Organa and of Organzia (Urganj) (120, 121) at the mouth of the Jaxartes and his place name Orcania (132) on the Oxus recall Matthew Arnold’s description of the Oxus at the close of _Sohrab and Rustum_:    But the majestic river floated on ...   Right for the polar star, past Orgunjè,   Brimming, and bright, and large.  The Tigris and Euphrates (165, 166) join, reaching the Persian Gulf (267) as a single stream flowing between two large edifices that represent Susiana (172) and Babylonia (173). To the east of the Tigris a nameless river (139) having its headwaters in a large lake (138) also enters the Persian Gulf. This same stream on the Catalan Atlas and on the Este map rises in a double source, two bodies of water that have been identified with Lakes Van and Urmia. Leardo connects the Euphrates (166) with the Mediterranean through the Orontes (168) and with the Red Sea (268) through the Jordan (167).  The most prominent feature in Arabia is Mecca (211), a large domed and towered building in good Italian Renaissance style and presumably representing a mosque. Several corrupted Turkish place names (227, 228, 229, 232) along with classical names (224, 231, 233-235) appear in Asia Minor.  The Indian Ocean is filled with yellow and red islands. A legend asserting that pepper and spice are found in these islands (275) comes from Marco Polo’s description of the East Indian archipelago. The largest of all the islands, lying off the coast of India, is marked Taprobana (269) and probably represents Sumatra.                                    Africa  Leardo’s Africa, like that of the Este map, has a very unusual shape. Two gulfs reach inland from the Indian Ocean and from the Atlantic, partially cutting off the southern extremity of the continent. On the Este map the eastern gulf is not as prominent as that of Leardo’s map, but the western is even deeper. Kretschmer suggests that these features have sprung from a combination of the ancient doctrine of a vast austral continent with Ptolemy’s theory that the Indian Ocean is surrounded by land.[23] Certain Arabic maps show an eastward projection of Africa like those of the Este map and Leardo, although they do not indicate anything corresponding to the western gulf.  Prester John’s castle (299) bulks large in the interior of Africa. In the twelfth century, reports spread through Europe of the vast realm of a fabulous Christian monarch in the heart of Asia. By the fourteenth century, however, Prester John’s empire had been transferred to Africa, where it became associated with the Christian kingdom of Abyssinia. The elaborate edifice with which Leardo represents Prester John’s empire may be intended for the sumptuous palace described in the thirteenth-century _Letter of Prester John_.  Like most medieval cartographers, Leardo makes the Nile (312) rise in West Africa (338). In this he follows Herodotus, Pliny, Mela, and other ancient authorities. Ptolemy, however, seems to have had a more correct view, placing the sources of the river in the Mountains of the Moon in eastern Africa. Nothing daunted, most of the fifteenth-century cartographers who used the writings of Ptolemy boldly transferred the Mountains of the Moon to West Africa to suit their theory of the river’s course. Thus, on the Leardo map we see the Montes Lunae (334) on the north coast of the West African gulf. Thence four streams flow north into a lake, out of which the Nile makes its way eastward and another stream flows westward into the Atlantic. The latter stream represents, perhaps, a combination of Niger and Senegal, of which some faint knowledge may have been gained through traders who had crossed the Sahara. The lower Nile is joined by the River “Stapus” (313), doubtless the Astapus of Ptolemy or the modern Blue Nile. On the Este map this tributary rises in the Terrestrial Paradise, there placed in East Africa.  To the mountain range of North Africa, the Carena of the Catalan maps, Leardo has added Ptolemaic names (385-392).                              The Mediterranean  The outlines of the Mediterranean (433) and Black Seas (431) are more correct than any other features which Leardo draws. This, of course, is due to the fact that they were derived ultimately from the portolan charts. Leardo preserves the faulty orientation of the Mediterranean characteristic of the latter. If we assume that the perpendicular line extending from the wind-blower off the west coast of Spain through Jerusalem to the wind-blower east of the Terrestrial Paradise is intended to run due east and west, we see that the axis of the Mediterranean with the adjoining shores has been turned counter-clockwise some twelve degrees. This is probably because of failure on the part of the makers of the original portolan charts to take into consideration the declination of the compass.[24]  Leardo’s place names along the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts are all derived from the portolan charts, although Leardo wrote names only where it was easy to do so without crowding. The least successful portion of Leardo’s Mediterranean coast is that of Spain: the shore is here unduly elongated as compared with that of the Este Catalan map, Barcelona (475) and Ampurias (476) being placed too far northeast on what ought to be the French shore line.                                    Europe  As on the Catalan maps, the geography of northwestern Europe is badly distorted. The Seine (448), Rhine (487), and Elbe (488) all flow parallel with one another but slightly to the south of west. The course of the Danube (552) with its southern branches is more true to nature. The Baltic Sea (577) and Scandinavia are drawn much as on the Este map.

[2]This map was discovered by Vincenzo Lazari in 1850. A detailed     description and interpretation of it will be found in Santarem, Vol.     3, pp. 398-442 [fuller bibliographical details regarding this and     other abbreviated references in these notes will be found on pp.     63-67]; black and white reproduction in Santarem’s _Atlas_, Part 3,     No. 49; also in A. E. Nordenskiöld, _Periplus_, p. 61.  [3]The map was discovered in 1879 by Major Friedrich von Pilat, Imperial     Counsellor of the Austro-Hungarian Legation and Consul-General of     Austria-Hungary in Venice. At the time it was presented to the     Society a brief anonymous description appeared in the _Bulletin of     the American Geographical Society_, Vol. 38, 1906, pp. 365-368. This     was based upon a sixteen-page pamphlet by Dr. Guglielmo Berchet, _Il     planisfero di Giovanni Leardo dell’ anno 1452_, Venice, 1880,     accompanying a photographic facsimile constituting No. XIV of the     series _Raccolta di mappamondi e carte nautiche del XIII al XVI     secolo_ published by Ferdinand Ongania, Venice. Dr. Berchet’s paper,     while useful to the present writer, has on the whole proved     disappointing because of its many inaccuracies in transcriptions and     also because almost no attempt was made to deal with the place     names, in many respects the most interesting features of all.  [4]As much of this digit as remains might be the upper part of either a     2, a 3, or a 7. Since the Easter calendar begins with 1453 the date     could hardly be earlier than Easter, 1452. For the same reason, it     is not likely to have been as late as 1457, the only possible date     after 1453. On the Vicenza Leardo map the Easter calendar begins     with the year in which the map is dated, 1448; on the Verona map of     1442 the calendar begins with the preceding year, 1441. A     discrepancy of four years between the beginning of the calendar and     the date of the map, however, is most improbable.      Santarem, Vol. 3, p. 399, and Berchet, _op. cit._, p. 6, cite two     mid-eighteenth century MSS in the Library of St. Mark’s, Venice,     which contain entries relating to a map by Giovanni Leardo dated     1447. One of these MS is that of the Doge Marco Foscarini (Codex     ital., XI, 123, p. 42), the other that of a contemporary scholar,     Giovanni degli Agostini (Codex ital., VII, 291, p. 542; this and the     preceding reference were furnished to the present writer by the     Chief Librarian of the Library of St. Mark’s; they do not agree     exactly with the references as given by Santarem and Berchet).      The passage from the Foscarini MS (Fig. 2) may be translated thus:     “Gio. Leardo, who flourished in 1440, made a planisphere on     parchment on which was written _Leardius de Venetiis me fecit anno     1447_. It was at the house of (_era presso_) Bernardo Trevisano.     Apostolo Zeno saw it many times and marveled at seeing the exactness     of the design.” The passage from the Agostini MS (Fig. 3) runs as     follows: “Giovanni Leardo: This (man) lived shortly before the     middle of the fifteenth century, and he delighted in geography and     spheres. In the Trevisan Library was preserved a planisphere by him     on parchment on which could be seen delineated the whole terraqueous     globe with all the signs and celestial constellations, beneath     which, according to his assertion, every part is placed. At the     bottom of this parchment these words may be read: _Joannes Leardius     de Venetiis me fecit ab anno 1447_. It is curious to see how in his     time, when not many discoveries had been made and navigation was so     little advanced, the positions of the provinces and of the seas were     conceived.”      Berchet, _op. cit._, p. 7, points out that the arms at the top of     the parchment of the Leardo map now belonging to the American     Geographical Society are those of the Trevisan house. He reads     incorrectly, however, the date given by Agostini as 1452, concluding     therefrom that the map mentioned by the latter was the same as the     Society’s map, the date of which he also reads as 1452. In view of     the actual difference in the dates, we may conclude that Leardo     constructed two maps for the Trevisan family, and that the one dated     1447 is yet to be rediscovered.

Macrobius, _Commentaria in     somnium Scipionis_, I, 20: 20, gives the diameter of the earth as     80,000 stades, which might, if converted into Arabic miles, be     approximately the 6857 miles of Leardo. According to Macrobius the     radius of the sun’s orbit is 4,800,000 stades (_ibid._, I, 20: 21);     the diameter of the sun’s orbit would therefore be 9,600,000 stades,     or 120 times that of the earth. The diameter of the sun’s orbit     according to Leardo is 218 times that of the earth. On the authority     of Porphyry, Macrobius (_ibid._, II, 3: 14) gives the relative     distances between the planets; but Leardo’s figures bear no relation     to these. I have not been able as yet to trace the origin of     Leardo’s figures.  [8]H. Grotefend, _Zeitrechnung des deutschen Mittelalters und der     Neuzeit_, Vol. 1, Hannover, 1891, p. 203 (reference kindly suggested     by Dom Hugh G. Bévenot of Weingarten Abbey, Württemberg, Germany).  [9]Grotefend, _op. cit._, p. 113, asserts that O was usually omitted to     avoid confusion with zero. Leardo, however, includes O. J and I are     counted as one letter. The golden number of 1453 is 10; Leardo’s A     corresponds with golden number 8.  [10]The following is a comparison of the times of the new moon on     certain dates as indicated by Leardo with the actual times as     determined for the meridian of Venice from Th. von Oppolzer, _Canon     der Finsternisse_ (constituting _Denkschr. Kaiserl. Akad. der Wiss.     in"]]]
