In 1911, Western Union began investigating systems used in Europe. The first to be tested was the Creed, a system for transmitting and printing Continental or Morse code signals at high speed. After observing several other systems, the Murray Multiplex, an improved and modernized version of the Baudot Multiplex, was found to show better operating features and, due to the use of the five-unit permutation code, more efficient use of telegraph lines.  By agreement with Donald Murray, and with his cooperation, the so-called Western Union Multiplex was developed, using Murray’s phonic wheel drive and synchronous correction. Western Union engineers designed tape transmitters and an autocontrol device for transmitting service signals. A keyboard-operated, five-unit-code, tape punch was supplied by the Morkrum Company. A page printer, which was later converted to print on gummed tape, was supplied by the Kleinschmidt Electric Company. The Western Union Multiplex was effective in increasing operating efficiency and came into extensive use throughout the system.  From that time on, development of the Baudot permutation-code printing telegraph apparatus was furthered by various companies, such as Bell Laboratories, Western Electric, the Morkrum Company, the Kleinschmidt Electric Company, as well as the companies of J. E. Wright, L. M. Potts, and others.  It appears that all of these inventors experimented with the idea of operating all transmitting and receiving apparatus at identical speeds to transmit a five-unit-code combination by first transmitting a pulse to start both transmitter and the distant receiver at the same time. Synchronous operation was obtained by electric motors equipped with governors to maintain correct speed; some used tuning-fork-controlled impulse motors. A system of five relays with progressive contact arrangements to cause cascade operation was also used to provide correct timing. Later, when correctly-timed, 60-cycle alternating current became available (see page 27), synchronous motors did the job.  Teleprinter apparatus using this synchronous method worked very well for point-to-point transmission as was used by the telegraph companies and news-distributing organizations to carry local traffic. It did not, however, solve the sought-for plan for a teleprinter intercommunicating system. When attempts were made to connect printers at different distant points in a telegraph intercommunicating circuit while using the synchronous principle, false reception and printing errors would occur, due to variation in line circuit conditions and to a variation of the mechanical start operation at outlying teleprinters. This required frequent overline adjustment to keep the connected apparatus in phase.  The following is an excerpt from a patent application of Dr. Louis M. Potts (later to become research engineer for the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation), filed June 17, 1909, giving his idea for achieving a teleprinter intercommunicating system on the synchronous principle. Dr. Potts was a very capable telegraph engineer. His early association was with the telegraph system of the Rowland Telegraphic Company which had limited use in the early 1900s.    In those synchronous telegraph systems wherein the sending and the   receiving commutator brushes constantly rotate, it is necessary to   adjust these brushes so that they will approximately simultaneously   engage corresponding segments. To effect this adjustment there is   usually provided a special device embodying an additional segment on   each commutator, and the adjustment consists in causing the brushes to   arrive approximately simultaneously on this segment at the two ends of   the line. Such adjustment is known as “finding the letter” and has to   be made every time synchronism has been interrupted. According to the   present invention, the necessity of providing additional means for   performing the so-called operation of “finding the letter” is rendered   unnecessary, since the transmitting and receiving commutator brushes   at the two ends of the line start up afresh as it were for each   signal.  In a later patent application, filed October 11, 1913, Dr. Potts stated:    This machine has also the advantage of being able to operate with a   very short code. In order to adapt it to Morse circuits, it should be   capable of operating with a code at least as short as the Morse code.   In the present machine, I preferably employ a five unit code which,   together with the starting impulse and the lag between signals, is   actually shorter than the Morse code. Counting the five code impulse   periods, the starting impulse period and the period of lag between   impulses, each signal in my case, may be considered in comparison with   the Morse code as being seven units long, whereas the Morse code is   8.5 units long. The average signal being shorter than the Morse, the   delicacy of adjustment will be less and the distance of operation   greater than a Morse telegraph for the same rate of transmission in   words per minute.  Dr. Potts, however, still depended on like synchronous operation at both terminals, and dual start, so he did not have the answer after all!  John E. Wright, who in the 1890s designed and built step-by-step printing apparatus, including the Wright-Negron bulletin printer, also turned his thoughts toward the five-unit permutation code for printer operation and built several variations using the synchronous principle. The Superintendent of Telegraphs for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad thought well of Wright’s apparatus and placed some in operation. But, here again, reliable operation could be maintained only in point-to-point operation. As will be noted in Chapter 2, Mr. Wright’s patents were purchased by the Kleinschmidt Electric Company in 1922.  A paper issued by Siemens-Halske of Germany in January of 1917[1] states that the Siemens Pendel Telegraph “is among the forerunners of the eventual worldwide start-stop system for intercommunication by the printed word.” The following excerpt translated from that description briefly explains the operation:    The Pendel Telegraph uses the five-unit permutation code to select   characters, and operates on a start-stop principle. It is intended for   station-to-station, one-way operation, the line current normally being   closed to the positive side of the line battery. Transmission is under   control of a keyboard with keys arranged as in a typewriter. Upon the   depression of a key, the line battery is reversed, thereby   transmitting a negative pulse to line which effects the start of both   transmitter and receiver at the same time. Thereafter,   five-code-combination pulses are transmitted, followed by positive   current to line, thus restoring the circuit system to a normally   closed line condition.    The name “Pendel Telegraph” would make one think that the timing of   the transmitter and receiver were under control of a swinging   pendulum. This is not the case. However, it does have a plan for   simulating the action of a pendulum by an arrangement of springs and   semi-rotating weights to effect synchronism for each printing cycle;   and energy is derived from a motor which intermittently winds a power   mainspring to an even tension. This arrangement is started in   operation at both terminals at the same time and provides isochronal   motion at both transmitter and receiver for each transmitted   character. Due to multiple operations of the springs and weights used   to provide synchronous action, the operating speed is limited to four   or five letters per second.  In England, too, there was work being done along these same lines. Mr. H. H. Harrison, who is so well known for his contributions over the years in the telegraph field, devised printer apparatus using the five-unit code which is described in Herbert’s _Telegraphy_,[2] as follows:    The instrument is provided with a Baudot 5-key keyboard, and has a   step-by-step distributor which is mounted inside the casing. The   standard Baudot alphabet is used, but each letter or character is   prefixed by a positive starting impulse. Every time a key is depressed   a universal bar is actuated which closes contacts giving the starting   impulse and the distributors at both ends of the line step through six   spaces. The combiner is of the electrical type invented by Baudot, and   is similar to that used in Siemens’ new automatic printing telegraph.   Five relays of the class used for telephone purposes are set at the   receiving end, according to whether some of the stepping impulses are   positive or negative. The distributor is a trunk hunting switch as   used in automatic telephony, and consists of a ratchet wheel and   stepping electromagnet. On the shaft of the ratchet wheel is fixed a   wiper which sweeps over a semi-circular bank of contacts in response   to the stepping impulses. Two-way working is secured by means of the   differential balance.    (The article ends with the statement that a typewriter keyboard is   being constructed to replace the five keys.)  It appears that all of these telegraph engineers and inventors envisioned a start-stop system and experimented with the idea of operating all transmitting and receiving apparatus at identical speeds by inserting a start signal before each group of letter code signals, to start both transmitter and distant receiver at the same time, and a stop condition between code groups.  In the following chapters will be shown the contributions made by both the Kleinschmidt and the Morkrum companies in the printing telegraph field, and finally their joint efforts which were to lead up to the establishment of that now worldwide intercommunicating system, the TELEX.                                    CHAPTER 2                               KLEINSCHMIDT   Edward E. Kleinschmidt’s first direct contact with telegraph"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53481"],["title","Printing Telegraphy... A New Era Begins (#2)"],["body","was during his employment as a young man, in 1893, by John E. Wright, whose firm had developed and was then manufacturing printing telegraph equipment known as the Wright-Negron bulletin printer for the Havas News Agency in Paris. These printers operated on the step-by-step principle at 30 words per minute. (To attest to their ruggedness, as late as 1951 some of these machines were reported to be still in use!)  Five years later, in 1898, Kleinschmidt started an experimental shop at 122 Fulton Street in New York City. A sign over the door read, “Inventions Developed,” and he did experimental and developmental work for various customers (individuals as well as companies—including Western Union) on a time-and-material basis. In the beginning he had a project of his own going—a facsimile telegraph system. He submitted the system to Western Union in 1900 with the suggestion that it might be valuable for customer services, since a customer could write his telegram in longhand and insert the written message in the transmitting unit for transmission in facsimile to the telegraph central. The idea, however, was rejected. At that time the photoelectric cell for scanning the written message and electronic means for amplifying signals had not yet been developed; while the apparatus operated quite well over short circuits, evidently the time had not arrived for commercial facsimile telegraphy.  The first telegraph apparatus job for the shop was brought in by Dr. George A. Cardwell, a dentist by profession. It was a partially developed printing telegraph using a three-unit code made up of combinations of plus-minus-high-and-low-voltage pulses (the code we have already discussed). The work for Dr. Cardwell was carried on until 1903 when a working model was completed. It had a typewheel for printing and stops arranged in a circle; magnets under control of relay selection were used to set the stops according to the received code combinations. This arrangement operated well, and on a test over a Western Union circuit from New York to Baltimore it gave satisfactory results. As we have seen, however, the code arrangement proved unsatisfactory for general telegraphic use.  Many customers came to the experimental shop with every type of idea imaginable; vacuum cleaners (The “Vacuna”), elevator signals, some early designs for Elmer Sperry’s gyrocompass were only a few. Kleinschmidt also set up a couple of side-line businesses, one for manufacturing automatic fishing reels under the trade name “Kelso,” another, the Aseptuloid Company, for making vaccination shields (some readers may well remember their childhood vaccinations being protected by a bubble of celluloid).  Another customer was George M. Seely, who later was instrumental in bringing Kleinschmidt’s work to the attention of Charles B. Goodspeed and W. S. Moore (they were to become his financial backers—see page 14). Mr. Seely came to the shop in 1906 with a partially developed block system for electric trolley car railways. His plan was to use special devices attached to the trolley pole which would cooperate with stationary electrical controls at certain fixed points along the road.  After working along these lines for awhile it became apparent that some inventive work would be required on Kleinschmidt’s part. Seely, in addition to time and material, then offered him a retainer for the assignment of any resulting patents.  As plans and studies progressed, a number of railway signaling devices were developed, tested, and patented. A major item was the development of a telephone train dispatching system. A complete set of apparatus was exhibited in operation at the American Association of Railroads Communications Convention held in Los Angeles in 1910. The company name given this venture was the “National Telephone Selector Company,” located at 235 Greenwich Street, New York City. The telephone train dispatching system was installed on the Long Branch Railroad with 30 stations connected with dispatcher headquarters at Red Bank, New Jersey. Another installation was made on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in West Virginia, connecting 38 stations with dispatcher headquarters at Fairbanks, West Virginia.  Most of the patents assigned to Mr. Seely were eventually sold to the Hall Signal Company.  Doing development work for others and assigning patents for a retainer did not satisfy Kleinschmidt’s ambitions. His interests being mainly in the telegraph, he set out to design and build a piece of apparatus that the telegraph companies could use. A keyboard-operated perforator to punch the Morse code in a tape for automatic transmission at high speed looked like a promising subject, since the tape punches in use at that time had a three-key arrangement—one each for dot, dash, and space.  Kleinschmidt’s first keyboard-operated, Morse-code perforator was constructed in 1911 and exhibited to the Western Union Telegraph Company. Mr. G. R. Benjamin, their chief engineer, and Mr. Emmett R. Shute, a vice president, thought well of the machine and, after testing it, gave Kleinschmidt an order for fifty. This order spelled success. To celebrate the event, Kleinschmidt invited his brothers, Bernard, Fred and William, and their families to a dinner party at a distinguished restaurant. Soon thereafter (1913), the Kleinschmidt Electric Company was organized, with the brothers as incorporating officers.  The Kleinschmidt Keyboard Perforator came into use by telegraph and cable companies throughout the world where Morse, Wheatstone, or Cable codes were used to transmit telegrams. It was also used with Western Union’s Barclay system which had its own code. The device was later manufactured by Teletype Corporation under the name “Teletype Perforator” and used by the U. S. Government where it served its purpose for high-speed Morse transmission during the war period (see figure 1).  In the years 1911 and 1912, the Western Union Telegraph Company, in looking toward higher operating efficiency over their trunk circuits, decided to test the Creed high-speed Morse and the Murray Multiplex, and invited both companies to bring their apparatus to New York. It was on this occasion that Kleinschmidt became acquainted with Mr. F. G. Creed, who, upon observing the Kleinschmidt keyboard perforator at Western Union, was impressed by its performance and said that there would be a good market for it in England, especially as a keyboard punch for the Creed high-speed Continental-Morse-code system. As a result of that conference he asked for ten as a trial order. These perforators were shipped to London in due time and gave satisfactory service. The British Post Office Telegraph evidently had heard about this new perforator and sent a letter to the Kleinschmidt company asking for a demonstration at their London headquarters.  Now it happened at that time that Kleinschmidt was extremely busy with the development of a five-unit-code typebar printer for the new Multiplex—and this was urgent since the first model was to be put on competitive test with a typewheel printer submitted by L. M. Potts and the Western Electric typewheel printer which was then in use. Therefore, he felt he should not lose a month or two in this developmental work for a trip to London. So, his answer to this important invitation was that he could not personally bring one of his perforators for exhibit but that he would ask Mr. F. G. Creed to do so. Mr. Creed agreed and set up a formal exhibit for the Post Office engineers; he consequently received an order for twenty Kleinschmidt perforators. Further correspondence with Creed resulted in an order for one hundred and a request that Kleinschmidt come to London the next year (1914) to negotiate a contract to supply his keyboard perforators for the Creed high-speed Morse and to set up a sales agency with Creed for certain territories.  While in London in the summer of 1914, Kleinschmidt visited the Managing Director of the Post Office Telegraph at his office to apologize for having had Mr. Creed exhibit the Kleinschmidt perforator instead of bringing it personally as had been requested. The Managing Director replied that Mr. Creed had indeed given a very good operating exhibition of the device and that an order for twenty had been placed with him. “However,” he added, “you know, we sent you an official invitation and expected your appearance with your machine!”  To continue: Upon observing the change in systems at Western Union (switching from the Barclay to the Murray Multiplex), the Kleinschmidt Electric Company, who had been experimenting in the development of a telegraph typewriter, built a receiving teletypewriter for the multiplex. It was a magnet-operated, five-unit-code typebar page printer, using the Underwood typewriter mechanisms as a basis; and it was completed in time for test and evaluation at Western Union in competition with the typewheel printers of both L. M. Potts and Western Electric.  The Western Electric machine was given the number 1A, Mr. Potts’s, 2A, and the Kleinschmidt printer was 3A. The final outcome of the tests was the selection of the Kleinschmidt model, and the company received an order for five machines, to include a spare, to equip the New York terminal of a New York-to-Boston, four-channel multiplex system. The order was filled in a short time and the machines were put on test.
