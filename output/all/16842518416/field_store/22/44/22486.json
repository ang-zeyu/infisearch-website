Then a fat man came out of the Court House, with a quill in his hand, and a merry twinkle in his eye that Stephen resented.  \"This way, please, sah,\" and he led him to a desk, from the drawer of which he drew forth a blank deed.  \"Name, please!\"  \"Stephen Atterbury Brice.\"  \"Residence, Mr. Brice!\"  Stephen gave the number. But instead of writing it clown, the man merely stared at him, while the fat creases in his face deepened and deepened. Finally he put down his quill, and indulged in a gale of laughter, hugely to Mr. Brice's discomfiture.  \"Shucks!\" said the fat man, as soon as he could.  \"What are you givin' us? That the's a Yankee boa'din' house.\"  \"And I suppose that that is part of your business, too,\" said Stephen, acidly.  The fat man looked at him, pressed his lips, wrote down the number, shaken all the while with a disturbance which promised to lead to another explosion. Finally, after a deal of pantomime, and whispering and laughter with the notary behind the wire screen, the deed was made out, signed, attested, and delivered. Stephen counted out the money grimly, in gold and Boston drafts.  Out in the sunlight on Chestnut Street, with the girl by his side, it all seemed a nightmare. The son of Appleton Brice of Boston the owner of a beautiful quadroon girl! And he had bought hex with his last cent.  Miss Crane herself opened the door in answer to his ring. Her keen eyes instantly darted over his shoulder and dilated, But Stephen, summoning all his courage, pushed past her to the stairs, and beckoned Hester to follow.  \"I have brought this--this person to see my mother,\" he said  The spinster bowed from the back of her neck. She stood transfixed on a great rose in the hall carpet until she heard Mrs. Brice's door open and slam, and then she strode up the stairs and into the apartment of Mrs. Abner Reed. As she passed the first landing, the quadroon girl was waiting in the hall.     CHAPTER VI  SILAS WHIPPLE  The trouble with many narratives is that they tell too much. Stephen's interview with his mother was a quiet affair, and not historic. Miss Crane's boarding-house is not an interesting place, and the tempest in that teapot is better imagined than described. Out of consideration for Mr. Stephen Brice, we shall skip likewise a most affecting scene at Mr. Canter's second-hand furniture store.  That afternoon Stephen came again to the dirty flight of steps which led to Judge Whipple's office. He paused a moment to gather courage, and then, gripping the rail, he ascended. The ascent required courage now, certainly. He halted again before the door at the top. But even as he stood there came to him, in low, rich tones, the notes of a German song. He entered And Mr. Richter rose in shirt-sleeves from his desk to greet him, all smiling.  \"Ach, my friend!\" said he, \"but you are late. The Judge has been awaiting you.\"  \"Has he?\" inquired Stephen, with ill-concealed anxiety.  The big young German patted him on the shoulder.  Suddenly a voice roared from out the open transom of the private office, like a cyclone through a gap.  \"Mr. Richter!\"  \"Sir!\"  \"Who is that?\"  \"Mr. Brice, sir.\"  \"Then why in thunder doesn't he come in?\"  Mr. Richter opened the private door, and in Stephen walked. The door closed again, and there he was in the dragon's dens face to face with the dragon, who was staring him through and through. The first objects that caught Stephen's attention were the grizzly gray eye brows, which seemed as so much brush to mark the fire of the deep-set battery of the eyes. And that battery, when in action, must have been truly terrible.  The Judge was shaven, save for a shaggy fringe of gray beard around his chin, and the size of his nose was apparent even in the full face.  Stephen felt that no part of him escaped the search of Mr. Whipple's glance. But it was no code or course of conduct that kept him silent. Nor was it fear entirely.  \"So you are Appleton Brice's son,\" said the Judge, at last. His tone was not quite so gruff as it might have been.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Stephen.  \"Humph!\" said the Judge, with a look that scarcely expressed approval. \"I guess you've been patted on the back too much by your father's friends.\" He leaned back in his wooden chair. \"How I used to detest people who patted boys on the back and said with a smirk, 'I know your father.' I never had a father whom people could say that about. But, sir,\" cried the Judge, bringing down his fist on the litter of papers that covered his desk, \"I made up my mind that one day people should know me. That was my spur. And you'll start fair here, Mr. Brice. They won't know your father here--\"  If Stephen thought the Judge brutal, he did not say so. He glanced around the little room,--at the bed in the corner, in which the Judge slept, and which during the day did not escape the flood of books and papers; at the washstand, with a roll of legal cap beside the pitcher.  \"I guess you think this town pretty crude after Boston, Mr. Brice,\" Mr. Whipple continued. \"From time immemorial it has been the pleasant habit of old communities to be shocked at newer settlements, built by their own countrymen. Are you shocked, sir?\"  Stephen flushed. Fortunately the Judge did not give him time to answer.  \"Why didn't your mother let me know that she was coming?\"  \"She didn't wish to put you to any trouble, sir.\"  \"Wasn't I a good friend of your father's? Didn't I ask you to come here and go into my office?\"  \"But there was a chance, Mr. Whipple--\"  \"A chance of what?\"  \"That you would not like me. And there is still a chance of it,\" added Stephen, smiling.  For a second it looked as if the Judge might smile, too. He rubbed his nose with a fearful violence.  \"Mr. Richter tells me you were looking for a bank,\" said he, presently.  Stephen quaked.  \"Yes, sir, I was, but--\"  But Mr. Whipple merely picked up the 'Counterfeit Bank Note Detector'.  \"Beware of Western State Currency as you would the devil,\" said he. \"That's one thing we don't equal the East in--yet. And so you want to become a lawyer?\"  \"I intend to become a lawyer, sir.\"  \"And so you shall, sir,\" cried the Judge, bringing down his yellow fist upon the 'Bank Note Detector'. \"I'll make you a lawyer, sir. But my methods ain't Harvard methods, sir.\"  \"I am ready to do anything, Mr. Whipple.\"  The Judge merely grunted. He scratched among his papers, and produced some legal cap and a bunch of notes.  \"Go out there,\" he said, \"and take off your coat and copy this brief. Mr. Richter will help you to-day. And tell your mother I shall do myself the honor to call upon her this evening.\"  Stephen did as he was told, without a word. But Mr. Richter was not in the outer office when he returned to it. He tried to compose himself to write, although the recollection of each act of the morning hung like a cloud over the back of his head. Therefore the first sheet of legal cap was spoiled utterly. But Stephen had a deep sense of failure. He had gone through the ground glass door with the firm intention of making a clean breast of the ownership of Hester. Now, as he sat still, the trouble grew upon him. He started a new sheet, and ruined that: Once he got as far as his feet, and sat down again. But at length he had quieted to the extent of deciphering ten lines of Mr. Whipple's handwriting when the creak of a door shattered his nerves completely.  He glanced up from his work to behold--none other than Colonel Comyn Carvel.  Glancing at Mr. Richter's chair, and seeing it empty, the Colonel's eye roved about the room until it found Stephen. There it remained, and the Colonel remained in the middle of the floor, his soft hat on the back of his head, one hand planted firmly on the gold head of his stick, and the other tugging at his goatee, pulling down his chin to the quizzical angle.  \"Whoopee!\" he cried.  The effect of this was to make one perspire freely. Stephen perspired. And as there seemed no logical answer, he made none.  Suddenly Mr. Carvel turned, shaking with a laughter he could not control, and strode into the private office the door slammed behind him. Mr. Brice's impulse was flight. But he controlled himself.  First of all there was an eloquent silence. Then a ripple of guffaws. Then the scratch-scratch of a quill pen, and finally the Judge's voice.  \"Carvel, what the devil's the matter with you, sir?\"  A squall of guffaws blew through the transom, and the Colonel was heard slapping his knee.  \"Judge Whipple,\" said he, his voice vibrating from suppressed explosions, \"I am happy to see that you have overcome some of your ridiculous prejudices, sir.\"  \"What prejudices, sir?\" the Judge was heard to shout.  \"Toward slavery, Judge,\" said Mr. Carvel, seeming to recover his gravity. \"You are a broader man than I thought, sir.\"  An unintelligible gurgle came from the Judge. Then he said.  \"Carvel, haven't you and I quarrelled enough on that subject?\"  \"You didn't happen to attend the nigger auction this morning when you were at the court?\" asked the Colonel, blandly.  \"Colonel,\" said the Judge, \"I've warned you a hundred times against the stuff you lay out on your counter for customers.\"  \"You weren't at the auction, then,\" continued the Colonel, undisturbed. \"You missed it, sir. You missed seeing this young man you've just employed buy the prettiest quadroon wench I ever set eyes on.\"  Now indeed was poor Stephen on his feet. But whether to fly in at the one entrance or out at the other, he was undecided.  \"Colonel,\" said Mr. Whipple, \"is that true?\"  \"Sir!\" \"MR. BRICE!\"  It did not seem to Stephen as if he was walking when he went toward the ground glass door. He opened it. There was Colonel Carvel seated on the bed, his goatee in his hand. And there was the Judge leaning forward from his hips, straight as a ramrod. Fire was darting from beneath his bushy eyebrows. \"Mr. Brice,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5389"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 02 (#0)"],["body","CRISIS  By Winston Churchill   Volume 2.    CHAPTER VIII  BELLEGARDE  Miss Virginia Carvel came down the steps in her riding-habit. And Ned, who had been waiting in the street with the horses, obsequiously held his hand while his young mistress leaped into Vixen's saddle. Leaving the darkey to follow upon black Calhoun, she cantered off up the street, greatly to the admiration of the neighbor. They threw open their windows to wave at her, but Virginia pressed her lips and stared straight ahead. She was going out to see the Russell girls at their father's country place on Bellefontaine Road, especially to proclaim her detestation for a certain young Yankee upstart. She had unbosomed herself to Anne Brinsmade and timid Eugenie Renault the day before.  It was Indian summer, the gold and purple season of the year. Frost had come and gone. Wasps were buzzing confusedly about the eaves again, marvelling at the balmy air, and the two Misses Russell, Puss and Emily, were seated within the wide doorway at needlework when Virginia dismounted at the horseblock.  \"Oh, Jinny, I'm so glad to see you,\" said Miss Russell. \"Here's Elise Saint Simon from New Orleans. You must stay all day and to-night.\"  \"I can't, Puss,\" said Virginia, submitting impatiently to Miss Russell's warm embrace. She was disappointed at finding the stranger. \"I only came --to say that I am going to have a birthday party in a few weeks. You must be sure to come, and bring your guest.\"  Virginia took her bridle from Ned, and Miss Russell's hospitable face fell.  \"You're not going?\" she said.  \"To Bellegarde for dinner,\" answered Virginia.  \"But it's only ten o'clock,\" said Puss. \"And, Jinny?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"There's a new young man in town, and they do say his appearance is very striking--not exactly handsome, you know, but strong-looking.\"  \"He's horrid!\" said Virginia. \"He's a Yankee.\"  \"How do you know?\" demanded Puss and Emily in chorus.  \"And he's no gentleman,\" said Virginia.  \"But how do you know, Jinny?\"  \"He's an upstart.\"  \"Oh. But he belongs to a very good Boston family, they say.\"  \"There are no good Boston families,\" replied Virginia, with conviction, as she separated her reins. \"He has proved that. Who ever heard of a good Yankee family?\"  \"What has he done to you, Virginia?\" asked Puss, who had brains.  Virginia glanced at the guest. But her grievance was too hot within her for suppression.  Do you remember Mr. Benbow's Hester, girls? The one I always said I wanted. She was sold at auction yesterday. Pa and I were passing the Court House, with Clarence, when she was put up for sale. We crossed the street to see what was going on, and there was your strong-looking Yankee standing at the edge of the crowd. I am quite sure that he saw me as plainly as I see you, Puss Russell.\"  \"How could he help it?\" said Puss, slyly.  Virginia took no notice of the remark.  \"He heard me ask Pa to buy her. He heard Clarence say that he would bid her in for me. I know he did. And yet he goes in and outbids Clarence, and buys her himself. Do you think any gentleman would do that, Puss Russell?\"  \"He bought her himself!\" cried the astonished Miss Russell. \"Why I thought that all Bostonians were Abolitionists.\"  \"Then he set her free,\" said Miss Carvel, contemptuously Judge Whipple went on her bond to-day.\"  \"Oh, I'm just crazy to see him now,\" said Miss Russell.  \"Ask him to your party, Virginia,\" she added mischievously.  \"Do you think I would have him in my house?\" cried Virginia.  Miss Russell was likewise courageous--\"I don't see why not. You have Judge Whipple every Sunday dinner, and he's an Abolitionist.\"  Virginia drew herself up.  \"Judge Whipple has never insulted me,\" she said, with dignity.  Puss gave way to laughter. Whereupon, despite her protests and prayers for forgiveness, Virginia took to her mare again and galloped off. They saw her turn northward on the Bellefontaine Road.  Presently the woodland hid from her sight the noble river shining far below, and Virginia pulled Vixen between the gateposts which marked the entrance to her aunt's place, Bellegarde. Half a mile through the cool forest, the black dirt of the driveway flying from Vixen's hoofs, and there was the Colfax house on the edge of the, gentle slope; and beyond it the orchard, and the blue grapes withering on the vines,--and beyond that fields and fields of yellow stubble. The silver smoke of a steamboat hung in wisps above the water. A young negro was busily washing the broad veranda, but he stopped and straightened at sight of the young horsewoman.  \"Sambo, where's your mistress?\"  \"Clar t' goodness, Miss Jinny, she was heah leetle while ago.\"  \"Yo' git atter Miss Lilly, yo' good-fo'-nuthin' niggah,\" said Ned, warmly. \"Ain't yo' be'n raised better'n to stan' theh wif yo'mouf open?\"  Sambo was taking the hint, when Miss Virginia called him back.  \"Where's Mr. Clarence?  \"Young Masr? I'll fotch him, Miss Jinny. He jes come home f'um seein' that thar trottin' hose he's gwine to race nex' week.\"  Ned, who had tied Calhoun and was holding his mistress's bridle, sniffed. He had been Colonel Carvel's jockey in his younger days.  \"Shucks!\" he said contemptuously. \"I hoped to die befo' the day a gemman'd own er trottah, Jinny. On'y runnin' hosses is fit fo' gemmen.\"  \"Ned,\" said Virginia, \"I shall be eighteen in two weeks and a young lady. On that day you must call me Miss Jinny.\"  Ned's face showed both astonishment and inquiry.  \"Jinny, ain't I nussed you always? Ain't I come upstairs to quiet you when yo' mammy ain't had no power ovah yo'? Ain't I cooked fo' yo', and ain't I followed you everywheres since I quit ridin' yo' pa's bosses to vict'ry? Ain't I one of de fambly? An' yit yo' ax me to call yo' Miss Jinny?\"  \"Then you've had privileges enough,\" Virginia answered. \"One week from to-morrow you are to say 'Miss Jinny.'\"  \"I'se tell you what, Jinny,\" he answered mischievously, with an emphasis on the word, \"I'se call you Miss Jinny ef you'll call me Mistah Johnson. Mistah Johnson. You aint gwinter forget? Mistah Johnson.\"  \"I'll remember,\" she said. \"Ned,\" she demanded suddenly, \"would you like to be free?\"  The negro started.  \"Why you ax me dat, Jinny?\"  \"Mr. Benbow's Hester is free,\" she said.  \"Who done freed her?\"  Miss Virginia flushed. \"A detestable young Yankee, who has come out here to meddle with what doesn't concern him. I wanted Hester, Ned. And you should have married her, if you behaved yourself.\"  Ned laughed uneasily.  \"I reckon I'se too ol' fo' Heste'.\" And added with privileged impudence, \"There ain't no cause why I can't marry her now.\"  Virginia suddenly leaped to the ground without his assistance.  \"That's enough, Ned,\" she said, and started toward the house.  \"Jinny! Miss Jinny!\" The call was plaintive.  \"Well, what?\"  \"Miss Jinny, I seed that than young gemman. Lan' sakes, he ain' look like er Yankee.\"  \"Ned,\" said Virginia, sternly, \"do you want to go back to cooking?\"  He quailed. \"Oh, no'm--Lan' sakes, no'm. I didn't mean nuthin'.\"  She turned, frowned, and bit her lip. Around the corner of the veranda she ran into her cousin.  He, too, was booted and spurred. He reached out, boyishly, to catch her in his arms. But she drew back from his grasp.  \"Why, Jinny,\" he cried, \"what's the matter?\"  \"Nothing, Max.\" She often called him so, his middle name being Maxwell. \"But you have no right to do that.\"  \"To do what?\" said Clarence, making a face.  \"You know,\" answered Virginia, curtly. \"Where's Aunt Lillian?\"  \"Why haven't I the right?\" he asked, ignoring the inquiry.  \"Because you have not, unless I choose. And I don't choose.\"  \"Are you angry with me still? It wasn't my fault. Uncle Comyn made me come away. You should have had the girl, Jinny, if it took my fortune.\"  \"You have been drinking this morning, Max,\" said Virginia.  \"Only a julep or so,\" he replied apologetically. \"I rode over to the race track to see the new trotter. I've called him Halcyon, Jinny,\" he continued, with enthusiasm. \"And he'll win the handicap sure.\"  She sat down on the veranda steps, with her knees crossed and her chin resting on her hands. The air was heavy with the perfume of the grapes and the smell of late flowers from the sunken garden near by. A blue haze hung over the Illinois shore.  \"Max, you promised me you wouldn't drink so much.\"  \"And I haven't been, Jinny, 'pon my word,\" he replied. \"But I met old Sparks at the Tavern, and he started to talk about the horses, and--and he insisted.\"  \"And you hadn't the strength of character,\" she said, scornfully, \"to refuse.\"  \"Pshaw, Jinny, a gentleman must be a gentleman. I'm no Yankee.\"  For a space Virginia answered nothing. Then she said, without changing her position:  \"If you were, you might be worth something.\"  \"Virginia!\"  She did not reply, but sat gazing toward the water. He began to pace the veranda, fiercely.  \"Look here, Jinny,\" he cried, pausing in front of her. \"There are some things you can't say to me, even in jest.\"  Virginia rose, flicked her riding-whip, and started down the steps.  \"Don't be a fool, Max,\" she said.  He followed her, bewildered. She skirted the garden, passed the orchard, and finally reached a summer house perched on a knoll at the edge of the wood. Then she seated herself on a bench, silently. He took a place on the opposite side, with his feet stretched out, dejectedly.  \"I'm tired trying to please you,\" he said. \"I have been a fool. You don't care that for me. It was all right when I was younger, when there was no one else to take you riding, and jump off the barn for your amusement, Miss. Now you have Tom Catherwood and Jack Brinsmade and the Russell boys running after you, it's different. I reckon I'll go to Kansas. There are Yankees to shoot in Kansas.\"  He did not see her smile as he sat staring at his feet.  \"Max,\" said she, all at once, \"why don't you settle down to something? Why don't you work?\"  Young Mr. Colfax's arm swept around in a circle.  There are twelve hundred acres to look"]]]
