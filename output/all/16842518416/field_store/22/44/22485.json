He was moved to return it with a little more fervor than he usually showed. And he felt, whatever the Judge might be, that he had a powerful friend near at hand--Mr. Richter's welcome came near being an embrace.  \"Sit down, Mr. Brice,\" he said; \"mild weather for November, eh? The Judge will be here in an hour.\"  Stephen looked around him: at the dusty books on the shelves, and the still dustier books heaped on Mr. Richter's big table; at the cuspidors; at the engravings of Washington and Webster; at the window in the jog which looked out on the court-house square; and finally at another ground-glass door on which was printed:                 SILAS WHIPPLE                  PRIVATE  This, then, was the den,--the arena in which was to take place a memorable interview. But the thought of waiting an hour for the dragon to appear was disquieting. Stephen remembered that he had something over nine hundred dollars in his pocket (which he had saved out of his last year's allowance at the Law School). So he asked Mr. Richter, who was dusting off a chair, to direct him to the nearest bank.  \"Why, certainly,\" said he; \"Mr. Brinsmade's bank on Chestnut Street.\" He took Stephen to the window and pointed across the square. \"I am sorry I cannot go with you,\" he added, \"but the Judge's negro, Shadrach, is out, and I must stay in the office. I will give you a note to Mr. Brinsmade.\"  \"His negro!\" exclaimed Stephen. \"Why, I thought that Mr. Whipple was an Abolitionist.\"  Mr. Richter laughed.  \"The man is free,\" said he. \"The Judge pays him wages.\"  Stephen thanked his new friend for the note to the bank president, and went slowly down the stairs. To be keyed up to a battle-pitch, and then to have the battle deferred, is a trial of flesh and spirit.  As he reached the pavement, he saw people gathering in front of the wide entrance of the Court House opposite, and perched on the copings. He hesitated, curious. Then he walked slowly toward the place, and buttoning his coat, pushed through the loafers and passers-by dallying on the outskirts of the crowd. There, in the bright November sunlight, a sight met his eyes which turned him sick and dizzy.  Against the walls and pillars of the building, already grimy with soot, crouched a score of miserable human beings waiting to be sold at auction. Mr. Lynch's slave pen had been disgorged that morning. Old and young, husband and wife,--the moment was come for all and each. How hard the stones and what more pitiless than the gaze of their fellow-creatures in the crowd below! O friends, we who live in peace and plenty amongst our families, how little do we realize the terror and the misery and the dumb heart-aches of those days! Stephen thought with agony of seeing his own mother sold before his eyes, and the building in front of him was lifted from its foundation and rocked even as shall the temples on the judgment day.  The oily auctioneer was inviting the people to pinch the wares. Men came forward to feel the creatures and look into their mouths, and one brute, unshaven and with filthy linen, snatched a child from its mother's lap Stephen shuddered with the sharpest pain he had ever known. An ocean-wide tempest arose in his breast, Samson's strength to break the pillars of the temple to slay these men with his bare hands. Seven generations of stern life and thought had their focus here in him,--from Oliver Cromwell to John Brown.  Stephen was far from prepared for the storm that raged within him. He had not been brought up an Abolitionist--far from it. Nor had his father's friends--who were deemed at that time the best people in Boston--been Abolitionists. Only three years before, when Boston had been aflame over the delivery of the fugitive Anthony Burns, Stephen had gone out of curiosity to the meeting at Faneuil Hall. How well he remembered his father's indignation when he confessed it, and in his anger Mr. Brice had called Phillips and Parker \"agitators.\" But his father, nor his father's friends in Boston had never been brought face to face with this hideous traffic.  Hark! Was that the sing-song voice of the auctioneer He was selling the cattle. High and low, caressing an menacing, he teased and exhorted them to buy. The were bidding, yes, for the possession of souls, bidding in the currency of the Great Republic. And between the eager shouts came a moan of sheer despair. What was the attendant doing now? He was tearing two of then: from a last embrace.  Three--four were sold while Stephen was in a dream  Then came a lull, a hitch, and the crowd began to chatter gayly. But the misery in front of him held Stephen in a spell. Figures stood out from the group. A white-haired patriarch, with eyes raised to the sky; a flat-breasted woman whose child was gone, whose weakness made her valueless. Then two girls were pushed forth, one a quadroon of great beauty, to be fingered. Stephen turned his face away,--to behold Mr. Eliphalet Hopper looking calmly on.  \"Wal, Mr. Brice, this is an interesting show now, ain't it? Something we don't have. I generally stop here to take a look when I'm passing.\" And he spat tobacco juice on the coping.  Stephen came to his senses.  \"And you are from New England?\" he said.  Mr. Hopper laughed.  \"Tarnation!\" said he, \"you get used to it. When I came here, I was a sort of an Abolitionist. But after you've lived here awhile you get to know that niggers ain't fit for freedom.\"  Silence from Stephen.  \"Likely gal, that beauty,\" Eliphalet continued unrepressed. \"There's a well-known New Orleans dealer named Jenkins after her. I callate she'll go down river.\"  \"I reckon you're right, Mistah,\" a man with a matted beard chimed in, and added with a wink: \"She'll find it pleasant enough--fer a while. Some of those other niggers will go too, and they'd rather go to hell. They do treat 'em nefarious down thah on the wholesale plantations. Household niggers! there ain't none better off than them. But seven years in a cotton swamp,--seven years it takes, that's all, Mistah.\"  Stephen moved away. He felt that to stay near the man was to be tempted to murder. He moved away, and just then the auctioneer yelled, \"Attention!\"  \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \"I have heah two sisters, the prope'ty of the late Mistah Robe't Benbow, of St. Louis, as fine a pair of wenches as was ever offe'd to the public from these heah steps--\"  \"Speak for the handsome gal,\" cried a wag.  \"Sell off the cart hoss fust,\" said another.  The auctioneer turned to the darker sister:  \"Sal ain't much on looks, gentlemen,\" he said, \"but she's the best nigger for work Mistah Benbow had.\" He seized her arm and squeezed it, while the girl flinched and drew back. \"She's solid, gentlemen, and sound as a dollar, and she kin sew and cook. Twenty-two years old. What am I bid?\"  Much to the auctioneer's disgust, Sal was bought in for four hundred dollars, the interest in the beautiful sister having made the crowd impatient. Stephen, sick at heart, turned to leave. Halfway to the corner he met a little elderly man who was the color of a dried gourd. And just as Stephen passed him, this man was overtaken by an old negress, with tears streaming down her face, who seized the threadbare hem of his coat. Stephen paused involuntarily.  \"Well, Nancy,\" said the little man, \"we had marvellous luck. I was able to buy your daughter for you with less than the amount of your savings.\"  \"T'ank you, Mistah Cantah,\" wailed the poor woman, \"t'ank you, suh. Praised be de name ob de Lawd. He gib me Sal again. Oh, Mistah Cantah\" (the agony in that cry), \"is you gwineter stan' heah an' see her sister Hester sol' to--to--oh, ma little Chile! De little Chile dat I nussed, dat I raised up in God's 'ligion. Mistah Cantah, save her, suh, f'om dat wicked life o' sin. De Lawd Jesus'll rewa'd you, suh. Dis ole woman'll wuk fo' you twell de flesh drops off'n her fingers, suh.\"  And had he not held her, she would have gone down on her knees on the stone flagging before him. Her suffering was stamped on the little man's face--and it seemed to Stephen that this was but one trial more which adversity had brought to Mr. Canter.  \"Nancy,\" he answered (how often, and to how many, must he have had to say the same thing), \"I haven't the money, Nancy. Would to God that I had, Nancy!\"  She had sunk down on the bricks. But she had not fainted. It was not so merciful as that. It was Stephen who lifted her, and helped her to the coping, where she sat with her bandanna awry.  Stephen was not of a descent to do things upon impulse. But the tale was told in after days that one of his first actions in St. Louis was of this nature. The waters stored for ages in the four great lakes, given the opportunity, rush over Niagara Falls into Ontario.  \"Take the woman away,\" said Stephen, in a low voice, \"and I will buy the girl,--if I can.\"  The little man looked up, dazed.  \"Give me your card,--your address. I will buy the girl, if I can, and set her free.\"  He fumbled in his pocket and drew out a dirty piece of pasteboard. It read: \"R. Canter, Second Hand Furniture, 20 Second Street.\" And still he stared at Stephen, as one who gazes upon a mystery. A few curious pedestrians had stopped in front of them.  \"Get her away, if you can, for God's sake,\" said Stephen again. And he strode off toward the people at the auction. He was trembling. In his eagerness to reach a place of vantage before the girl was sold, he pushed roughly into the crowd.  But suddenly he was brought up short by the blocky body of Mr. Hopper, who grunted with the force of the impact.  \"Gosh,\" said that gentleman, \"but you are inters'ted. They ain't begun to sell her yet--he's waitin' for somebody. Callatin' to buy her?\" asked Mr. Hopper, with genial humor.  Stephen took a deep breath. If he knocked Mr. Hopper down, he certainly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5388"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 01 (#7)"],["body"," not buy her. And it was a relief to know that the sale had not begun.  As for Eliphalet, he was beginning to like young Brice. He approved of any man from Boston who was not too squeamish to take pleasure in a little affair of this kind.  As for Stephen, Mr. Hopper brought him back to earth. He ceased trembling, and began to think.  \"Tarnation!\" said Eliphalet. \"There's my boss, Colonel Carvel across the street. Guess I'd better move on. But what d'ye think of him for a real Southern gentleman?\"  \"The young dandy is his nephew, Clarence Colfax. He callates to own this town.\" Eliphalet was speaking leisurely, as usual, while preparing to move. \"That's Virginia Carvel, in red. Any gals down Boston-way to beat her? Guess you won't find many as proud.\"  He departed. And Stephen glanced absently at the group. They were picking their way over the muddy crossing toward him. Was it possible that these people were coming to a slave auction? Surely not. And yet here they were on the pavement at his very side.  She wore a long Talma of crimson cashmere, and her face was in that most seductive of frames, a scoop bonnet of dark green velvet, For a fleeting second her eyes met his, and then her lashes fell. But he was aware, when he had turned away, that she was looking at him again. He grew uneasy. He wondered whether his appearance betrayed his purpose, or made a question of his sanity.  Sanity! Yes, probably he was insane from her point of view. A sudden anger shook him that she should be there calmly watching such a scene.  Just then there was a hush among the crowd. The beautiful slave-girl was seized roughly by the man in charge and thrust forward, half fainting, into view. Stephen winced. But unconsciously he turned, to see the effect upon Virginia Carvel.  Thank God! There were tears upon her lashes.  Here was the rasp of the auctioneer's voice:-- \"Gentlemen, I reckon there ain't never been offered to bidders such an opportunity as this heah. Look at her well, gentlemen. I ask you, ain't she a splendid creature?\"  Colonel Carvel, in annoyance, started to move on. \"Come Jinny,\" he said, \"I had no business to bring you aver.\"  But Virginia caught his arm. \"Pa,\" she cried, \"it's Mr. Benbow's Hester. Don't go, dear. Buy her for me You know that I always wanted her. Please!\"  The Colonel halted, irresolute, and pulled his goatee Young Colfax stepped in between them.  \"I'll buy her for you, Jinny. Mother promised you a present, you know, and you shall have her.\"  Virginia had calmed.  \"Do buy her, one of you,\" was all she said  \"You may do the bidding, Clarence,\" said the Colonel, \"and we'll settle the ownership afterward.\" Taking Virginia's arm, he escorted her across the street.  Stephen was left in a quandary. Here was a home for the girl, and a good one. Why should me spend the money which meant so much to him. He saw the man Jenkin elbowing to the front. And yet--suppose Mr. Colfax did not get her? He had promised to buy her if he could, and to set her free:  Stephen had made up his mind: He shouldered his way after Jenkins.     CHAPTER V  THE FIRST SPARK PASSES  \"Now, gentlemen,\" shouted the auctioneer when he had finished his oration upon the girl's attractions, \"what 'tin I bid? Eight hundred?\"  Stephen caught his breath. There was a long pause no one cared to start the bidding.  \"Come, gentlemen, come! There's my friend Alf Jenkins. He knows what she's worth to a cent. What'll you give, Alf? Is it eight hundred?\"  Mr. Jenkins winked at the auction joined in the laugh.  \"Three hundred!\" he said.  The auctioneer was mortally offended. Then some one cried:--\"Three hundred and fifty!\"  It was young Colfax. He was recognized at once, by name, evidently as a person of importance.  \"Thank you, Mistah Colfax, suh,\" said the auctioneer, with a servile wave of the hand in his direction, while the crowd twisted their necks to see him. He stood very straight, very haughty, as if entirely oblivious to his conspicuous position.  \"Three seventy-five!\"  \"That's better, Mistah Jenkins,\" said the auctioneer, sarcastically. He turned to the girl, who might have stood to a sculptor for a figure of despair. Her hands were folded in front of her, her head bowed down. The auctioneer put his hand under her chin and raised it roughly. \"Cheer up, my gal,\" he said, \"you ain't got nothing to blubber about now.\"  Hester's breast heaved and from her black eyes there shot a magnificent look of defiance. He laughed. That was the white blood.  The white blood!  Clarence Colfax had his bid taken from his lips. Above the heads of the people he had a quick vision of a young man with a determined face, whose voice rang clear and strong,-- \"Four hundred!\"  Even the auctioneer, braced two ways, was thrown off his balance by the sudden appearance of this new force. Stephen grew red over the sensation he made. Apparently the others present had deemed competition with such as Jenkins and young Colfax the grossest folly. He was treated to much liberal staring before the oily salesman arranged his wits to grapple with the third factor.  Four hundred from--from--from that gentleman. And the chubby index seemed the finger of scorn.  \"Four hundred and fifty!\" said Mr. Colfax, defiantly.  Whereupon Mr. Jenkins, the New Orleans dealer, lighted a very long cigar and sat down on the coping. The auctioneer paid no attention to this manoeuvre. But Mr. Brice and Mr. Colfax, being very young, fondly imagined that they had the field to themselves, to fight to a finish.  Here wisdom suggested in a mild whisper to Stephen that there was a last chance to pull out. And let Colfax have the girl? Never. That was pride, and most reprehensible. But second he thought of Mr. Canter and of Nancy, and that was not pride.  \"Four seventy-five!\" he cried.  \"Thank you, suh.\"  \"Now fur it, young uns!\" said the wag, and the crowd howled with merriment.  \"Five hundred!\" snapped Mr. Colfax.  He was growing angry. But Stephen was from New England, and poor, and he thought of the size of his purse. A glance at his adversary showed that his blood was up. Money was plainly no consideration to him, and young Colfax did not seem to be the kind who would relish returning to a young lady and acknowledge a defeat.  Stephen raised the bid by ten dollars. The Southerner shot up fifty. Again Stephen raised it ten. He was in full possession of himself now, and proof against the thinly veiled irony of the oily man's remarks in favor of Mr. Colfax. In an incredibly short time the latter's impetuosity had brought them to eight hundred and ten dollars.  Then several things happened very quickly.  Mr. Jenkins got up from the curb and said, \"Eight hundred and twenty-five,\" with his cigar in his mouth. Scarcely had the hum of excitement died when Stephen, glancing at Colfax for the next move, saw that young gentleman seized from the rear by his uncle, the tall Colonel. And across the street was bliss Virginia Carvel, tapping her foot on the pavement.  \"What are you about, sir?\" the Colonel cried. \"The wench isn't worth it.\"  \"Mr. Colfax shook himself free.  \"I've got to buy her now, sir,\" he cried.  \"I reckon not,\" said the Colonel. \"You come along with me.\"  Naturally Mr. Colfax was very angry. He struggled but he went. And so, protesting, he passed Stephen, at whom he did not deign to glance. The humiliation of it must have been great for Mr. Colfax. \"Jinny wants her; sir,\" he said, \"and I have a right to buy her.\"  \"Jinny wants everything,\" was the Colonel's reply. And in a single look of curiosity and amusement his own gray eyes met Stephen's. They seemed to regret that this young man, too, had not a guardian. Then uncle and nephew recrossed the street, and as they walked off the Colonel was seen to laugh. Virginia had her chin in the air, and Clarence's was in his collar.  The crowd, of course, indulged in roars of laughter, and even Stephen could not repress a smile, a smile not without bitterness. Then he wheeled to face Mr. Jerkins. Out of respect for the personages involved, the auctioneer had been considerately silent daring the event. It was Mr. Brice who was now the centre of observation.  Come, gentlemen, come, this here's a joke--eight twenty-five. She's worth two thousand. I've been in the business twenty yea's, and I neve' seen her equal. Give me a bid, Mr.--Mr.--you have the advantage of me, suh.\"  \"Eight hundred and thirty-five!\" said Stephen.  \"Now, Mr. Jerkins, now, suh! we've got twenty me' to sell.\"  \"Eight fifty!\" said Mr. Jerkins.  \"Eight sixty!\" said Stephen, and they cheered him.  Mr. Jenkins took his cigar out of his teeth, and stared.  \"Eight seventy-five!\" said he.  \"Eight eighty-five!\" said Stephen.  There was a breathless pause.  \"Nine hundred!\" said the trader.  \"Nine hundred and ten!\" cried Stephen.  At that Mr. Jerkins whipped his hat from off his head, and made Stephen a derisive bow.  \"She's youahs, suh,\" he said. \"These here are panic times. I've struck my limit. I can do bettah in Louisville fo' less. Congratulate you, suh --reckon you want her wuss'n I do.\"  At which sally Stephen grew scarlet, and the crowd howled with joy.  \"What!\" yelled the auctioneer. \"Why, gentlemen, this heah's a joke. Nine hundred and ten dollars, gents, nine hundred and ten. We've just begun, gents. Come, Mr. Jerkins, that's giving her away.\"  The trader shook his head, and puffed at his cigar.  \"Well,\" cried the oily man, \"this is a slaughter. Going at nine hundred an' ten--nine ten--going--going--\" down came the hammer--\"gone at nine hundred and ten to Mr.--Mr.--you have the advantage of me, suh.\"  An attendant had seized the girl, who was on the verge of fainting, and was dragging her back. Stephen did not heed the auctioneer, but thrust forward regardless of stares.  \"Handle her gently, you blackguard,\" he cried.  The man took his hands off.  \"Suttinly, sah,\" he said.  Hester lifted her eyes, and they were filled with such gratitude and trust that suddenly he was overcome with"]]]
