One day in the warm summer the farmer and his wife determined to drive to the town to sell their butter and eggs and bring back some groceries in exchange for them, and while they were gone Bobby was to be left alone.  \"We shall not be back till late in the evening,\" said his mother, \"for the weather is too warm to drive very fast. But I have left you a dish of bread and milk for your supper, and you must be a good boy and amuse yourself with your fiddle until we return.\"  Bobby promised to be good and look after the house, and then his father and mother climbed into the wagon and drove away to the town.  The boy was not entirely alone, for there was the big black tabby-cat lying upon the floor in the kitchen, and the little yellow dog barking at the wagon as it drove away, and the big moolie-cow lowing in the pasture down by the brook. Animals are often very good company, and Bobby did not feel nearly as lonely as he would had there been no living thing about the house.  Besides he had some work to do in the garden, pulling up the weeds that grew thick in the carrot-bed, and when the last faint sounds of the wheels had died away he went into the garden and began his task.  The little dog went too, for dogs love to be with people and to watch what is going on; and he sat down near Bobby and cocked up his ears and wagged his tail and seemed to take a great interest in the weeding. Once in a while he would rush away to chase a butterfly or bark at a beetle that crawled through the garden, but he always came back to the boy and kept near his side.  By and by the cat, which found it lonely in the big, empty kitchen, now that Bobby's mother was gone, came walking into the garden also, and lay down upon a path in the sunshine and lazily watched the boy at his work. The dog and the cat were good friends, having lived together so long that they did not care to fight each other. To be sure Towser, as the little dog was called, sometimes tried to tease pussy, being himself very mischievous; but when the cat put out her sharp claws and showed her teeth, Towser, like a wise little dog, quickly ran away, and so they managed to get along in a friendly manner.  By the time the carrot-bed was all weeded, the sun was sinking behind the edge of the forest and the new moon rising in the east, and now Bobby began to feel hungry and went into the house for his dish of bread and milk.  \"I think I'll take my supper down to the brook,\" he said to himself, \"and sit upon the grassy bank while I eat it. And I'll take my fiddle, too, and play upon it to pass the time until father and mother come home.\"  It was a good idea, for down by the brook it was cool and pleasant; so Bobby took his fiddle under his arm and carried his dish of bread and milk down to the bank that sloped to the edge of the brook. It was rather a steep bank, but Bobby sat upon the edge, and placing his fiddle beside him, leaned against a tree and began to eat his supper.  The little dog had followed at his heels, and the cat also came slowly walking after him, and as Bobby ate, they sat one on either side of him and looked earnestly into his face as if they too were hungry. So he threw some of the bread to Towser, who grabbed it eagerly and swallowed it in the twinkling of an eye. And Bobby left some of the milk in the dish for the cat, also, and she came lazily up and drank it in a dainty, sober fashion, and licked both the dish and spoon until no drop of the milk was left.  Then Bobby picked up his fiddle and tuned it and began to play some of the pretty tunes he knew. And while he played he watched the moon rise higher and higher until it was reflected in the smooth, still water of the brook. Indeed, Bobby could not tell which was the plainest to see, the moon in the sky or the moon in the water. The little dog lay quietly on one side of him, and the cat softly purred upon the other, and even the moolie-cow was attracted by the music and wandered near until she was browsing the grass at the edge of the brook.  After a time, when Bobby had played all the tunes he knew, he laid the fiddle down beside him, near to where the cat slept, and then he lay down upon the bank and began to think.  It is very hard to think long upon a dreamy summer night without falling asleep, and very soon Bobby's eyes closed and he forgot all about the dog and the cat and the cow and the fiddle, and dreamed he was Jack the Giant Killer and was just about to slay the biggest giant in the world.  And while he dreamed, the cat sat up and yawned and stretched herself, and then began wagging her long tail from side to side and watching the moon that was reflected in the water.  But the fiddle lay just behind her, and as she moved her tail, she drew it between the strings of the fiddle, where it caught fast. Then she gave her tail a jerk and pulled the fiddle against the tree, which made a loud noise. This frightened the cat greatly, and not knowing what was the matter with her tail, she started to run as fast as she could. But still the fiddle clung to her tail, and at every step it bounded along and made such a noise that she screamed with terror. And in her fright she ran straight towards the cow, which, seeing a black streak coming at her, and hearing the racket made by the fiddle, became also frightened and made such a jump to get out of the way that she jumped right across the brook, leaping over the very spot where the moon shone in the water!  Bobby had been awakened by the noise, and opened his eyes in time to see the cow jump; and at first it seemed to him that she had actually jumped over the moon in the sky, instead of the one in the brook.  The dog was delighted at the sudden excitement caused by the cat, and ran barking and dancing along the bank, so that he presently knocked against the dish, and behold! it slid down the bank, carrying the spoon with it, and fell with a splash into the water of the brook.  As soon as Bobby recovered from his surprise he ran after the cat, which had raced to the house, and soon came to where the fiddle lay upon the ground, it having at last dropped from the cat's tail. He examined it carefully, and was glad to find it was not hurt, in spite of its rough usage. And then he had to go across the brook and drive the cow back over the little bridge, and also to roll up his sleeve and reach into the water to recover the dish and the spoon.  Then he went back to the house and lighted a lamp, and sat down to compose a new tune before his father and mother returned.  The cat had recovered from her fright and lay quietly under the stove, and Towser sat upon the floor panting, with his mouth wide open, and looking so comical that Bobby thought he was actually laughing at the whole occurrence.  And these were the words to the tune that Bobby composed that night:          Hey, diddle, diddle,         The cat and the fiddle,     The cow jumped over the moon!         The little dog laughed         To see such sport,     And the dish ran away with the spoon!     [Illustration: The Black Sheep]     The Black Sheep      Black sheep, black sheep, have you any wool?     Yes, my little master, three bags full;     One for my master and one for his dame,     And one for the little boy that lives in the lane.   IT was a bright spring day, and the sun shone very warm and pleasant over the pastures, where the new grass was growing so juicy and tender that all the sheep thought they had never tasted anything so delicious.  The sheep had had a strange experience that morning, for the farmer had taken them down to the brook and washed them, and then he tied their legs together and laid them on the grass and clipped all the heavy, soft wool from their bodies with a great pair of shears.  The sheep did not like this very well, for every once in a while the shears would pull the wool and hurt them; and when they were sheared they felt very strange, for it was almost as if someone took off all your clothes and let you run around naked. None of them were in a very good temper this morning, although the sun shone so warmly and the grass was so sweet, and as they watched the farmer and his man carry their wool up to the house in great bags, the old ram said, crossly,  \"I hope they are satisfied, now that they have stolen from us all our soft, warm fleece.\"  \"What are they going to do with it?\" asked one of the sheep.  \"Oh, they will spin it into threads and make coats for the men and dresses for the women. For men are such strange creatures that no wool grows on them at all, and that is why they selfishly rob us of our fleece that they may cover their own skinny bodies!\"  \"It must be horrid to be a man,\" said the Black Sheep, \"and not to have any wool grow on you at all. I'm sorry for that little boy that lives in the lane, for he will never be able to keep warm unless we give him some of our wool.\"  \"But what a shame it is,\" continued the ram, \"for the farmer to steal all the wool from us when we have taken all the trouble to grow it!\"  \"I don't mind,\" bleated a young lamb named Frisky, as it kicked up its heels and gambolled about upon the grass; \"it's nice to have all that heavy wool cut off my back, for I sha'n't have to carry it around wherever I go.\"  \"Oh, indeed!\" sneered the ram, \"you like it, do you? Have you any idea what you look like, all sheared down to your skin? How would you like to have someone come along and see you, now that you are all head and legs?\"  \"Oh, I wouldn't mind,\" said the lamb again; \"I shall grow more wool by winter-time, and I'm sure I don't look any worse than you do.\"  Some of the sheep looked at the ram and began to titter, for he was old and thin, and looked very comical indeed without any wool. And this made him so angry that he went off by himself and began eating grass, and would not speak to the others at all.  \"I don't know why sheep should feel badly about having their fleeces cut,\" remarked the Black Sheep,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5312"],["title","Mother Goose in Prose (#5)"],["body","tfully, \"for the farmer is very kind to us, and so is his dame, and I am glad my wool serves to keep them warm in the winter. For before the snow comes our wool will grow out again, and we shall not be any the worse for our loss.\"  \"What do those people who haven't any sheep do for clothes?\" asked the lamb.  \"I'm sure I don't know. They must nearly freeze in the winter. Perhaps the ram can tell us.\"  But the ram was still angry, and refused to say anything, so the sheep stopped talking and began to scatter over the pasture and eat the tender, new grass.  By and by the Black Sheep wandered near the lane, and looking up, saw the little boy watching it through the bars.  \"Good morning, Black Sheep,\" said the boy; \"why do you look so funny this morning?\"  \"They have cut off my wool,\" answered the sheep.  [Illustration: The Black Sheep]  \"What will they do with it, Black Sheep?\" enquired the little boy.  \"They will make coats of it, to keep themselves warm.\"  \"I wish I had some wool,\" said the boy, \"for I need a new coat very badly, and mamma is so poor she cannot buy me one.\"  \"That is too bad,\" replied the Black Sheep; \"but I shall have more wool by and by, and then I will give you a bagful to make a new coat from.\"  \"Will you really?\" asked the boy, looking very much pleased.  \"Indeed I will,\" answered the sheep, \"for you are always kind and have a pleasant word for me. So you watch until my wool grows again, and then you shall have your share of it.\"  \"Oh, thank you!\" said the boy, and he ran away to tell his mother what the Black Sheep had said.  When the farmer came into the field again the Black Sheep said to him,  \"Master, how many bags of wool did you cut from my back?\"  \"Two bags full,\" replied the farmer; \"and it was very nice wool indeed.\"  \"If I grow three bags full the next time, may I have one bag for myself?\" asked the sheep.  \"Why, what could you do with a bag of wool?\" questioned the farmer.  \"I want to give it to the little boy that lives in the lane. He is very poor and needs a new coat.\"  \"Very well,\" answered the master; \"if you can grow three bags full I will give one to the little boy.\"  So the Black Sheep began to grow wool, and tried in every way to grow the finest and heaviest fleece in all the flock. She always lay in the sunniest part of the pastures, and drank from the clearest part of the brook, and ate only the young and juicy shoots of grass and the tenderest of the sheep-sorrel. And each day the little boy came to the bars and looked at the sheep and enquired how the wool was growing.  \"I am getting along finely,\" the Black Sheep would answer, \"for not one sheep in the pasture has so much wool as I have grown already.\"  \"Can I do anything to help you?\" asked the little boy.  \"Not that I think of,\" replied the sheep, \"unless you could get me a little salt. I believe salt helps the wool to grow.\"  So the boy ran to the house and begged his mother for a handful of salt, and then he came back to the bars, where the Black Sheep licked it out of his hand.  Day by day the wool on the sheep grew longer and longer, and even the old ram noticed it and said,  \"You are foolish to grow so much wool, for the farmer will cut it all off, and it will do you no good. Now I am growing just as little as possible, for since he steals what I have I am determined he shall get very little wool from my back.\"  Black Sheep did not reply to this, for she thought the old ram very ill-tempered and selfish, and believed he was doing wrong not to grow more wool.  Finally the time came to shear the sheep again, and the farmer and his man came into the pasture to look at them, and were surprised to see what a fine, big fleece the Black Sheep had grown.  \"There will be three bagsful at the least,\" said the master, \"and I will keep my promise and give one to the little boy in the lane. But, my goodness! how scraggly and poor the old ram looks. There is scarcely any wool on him at all. I think I must sell him to the butcher!\"  And, in truth, although the ram kicked and struggled and bleated with rage, they tied his legs and put him into the cart and carried him away to the butcher. And that was the last the sheep ever saw of him.  But the Black Sheep ran up to the bars by the lane and waited with a glad heart till the little boy came. When he saw the sheep waiting for him he asked,      \"Black Sheep, Black Sheep, have you any wool?\"  And the sheep replied,      \"Yes my little master, three bags full!\"  \"That is fine!\" said the boy; \"but who are the three bags for?\"      \"One for my master, one for his dame,      And one for the little boy that lives in the lane.\"  \"Thank you, Black Sheep,\" said the little boy; \"you are very kind, and I shall always think of you when I wear my new coat.\"  The next day the sheep were all sheared, and the Black Sheep's fleece made three big bagsful. The farmer kept his promise and carried one bag to the little boy that lived in the lane, and the wool was so soft and so heavy that there was enough not only for the new coat, but to make his mother a warm dress as well.  The Black Sheep was very proud and happy when the mother and her little boy came down to the bars and showed the new clothes that had been made from the wool.  \"This pays me for all my trouble,\" said the Black Sheep, and the little boy reached his hand through the bars and patted her gently upon the head.     [Illustration: Old King Cole]     Old King Cole      Old King Cole was a merry old soul,       And a merry old soul was he;     He called for his pipe and he called for his bowl       And he called for his fiddlers three.   OLD KING COLE was not always a king, nor was he born a member of any royal family. It was only chance--\"hard luck\" he used to call it--that made him a king at all.  He had always been a poor man, being the son of an apple peddler, who died and left him nothing but a donkey and a fiddle. But that was enough for Cole, who never bothered his head about the world's goods, but took things as they came and refused to worry about anything.  So, when the house he lived in, and the furniture, and even the apple-cart were sold to pay his father's debts, and he found himself left with the old fiddle that nobody wanted and the old donkey that no one would have--it being both vicious and unruly--he uttered no word of complaint. He simply straddled the donkey and took the fiddle under his arm and rode out into the world to seek his fortune.  When he came to a village he played a merry tune upon the fiddle and sang a merry song with it, and the people gave him food most willingly. There was no trouble about a place to sleep, for if he was denied a bed he lay down with the donkey in a barn, or even on the village green, and making a pillow of the donkey's neck he slept as soundly as anyone could in a bed of down.  And so he continued riding along and playing upon his fiddle for many years, until his head grew bald and his face was wrinkled and his bushy eyebrows became as white as snow. But his eyes never lost their merry twinkle, and he was just as fat and hearty as in his younger days, while, if you heard him singing his songs and scraping upon the old fiddle, you would know at once his heart was as young as ever.  He never guided the donkey, but let the beast go where it would, and so it happened that at last they came to Whatland, and entered one day the city where resided the King of that great country.  Now, even as Cole rode in upon his donkey the King of Whatland lay dying in his palace, surrounded by all the luxury of the court. And as he left no heir, and was the last of the royal line, the councilors and wise men of Whatland were in a great quandary as to who should succeed him. But finally they bethought themselves of the laws of the land, and upon looking up the records they found in an old book a law that provided for just such a case as this.  \"If the King dies,\" so read the law, \"and there be no one to succeed to the throne, the prime minister shall be blinded and led from the palace into the main street of the city. And he shall stretch out his arms and walk about, and the first person he touches shall be crowned as King of the land.\"  The councilors were greatly pleased when they found this law, for it enabled them to solve the problem that confronted them. So when the King had breathed his last they blindfolded the prime minister and led him forth from the palace, and he began walking about with outstretched arms seeking someone to touch.  Of course the people knew nothing of this law, nor even that the old King was dead, and seeing the prime minister groping about blindfolded they kept out of his way, fearing they might be punished if he stumbled against them. But Cole was then riding along on the donkey, and did not even know it was the prime minister who was feeling about in such a funny way. So he began to laugh, and the minister, who had by this time grown tired of the game, heard the laugh and came toward the stranger and touched him, and immediately all the wise men and the councilors fell down before him and hailed him as King of Whatland!  Thus did the wandering fiddler become King Cole, and you may be sure he laughed more merrily than ever when they explained to him his good fortune.  [Illustration: Old King Cole]  They carried him within the palace and dressed him in purple and fine linen, and placed a crown of gold upon his bald head and a jeweled scepter in his wrinkled hand, and all this amused old King Cole very much. When he had been led to the great throne-room and placed upon the throne of gold (where the silken cushions felt very soft and pleasant after his long ride upon the donkey's sharp back) the courtiers all knelt before him and asked what commands he wished to give, since everyone in the kingdom must now obey his slightest word.  \"Oh well,\" said the new King, \"I think the first thing I would like is my old pipe. You'll find it in the pocket of the ragged coat I took"]]]
