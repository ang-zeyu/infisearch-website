It would take too long now to tell that story of the letter to Adrianople.  I've no proof, but a private notion that Kagig is descended from the old Armenian kings.  In a certain sort of tight place there's not a better man in Asia.  Now, Lord Montdidier, if you're in earnest about searching for that castle of your Crusader ancestors, you're in luck!\"  \"You know it's what I came here for,\" said Monty.  \"These friends of mine are curious, and I'm determined.  Now that Fred's well--\"  \"I'm puzzled,\" said the consul, leaning back and looking at us all with half-closed eyes.  \"Why should Kagig choose just this time to guide a hunting party?  If any man knows trouble's brewing, I suspect be surely does.  Anything can happen in the interior.  I recall, for instance, a couple of Danes, who went with a guide not long ago, and simply disappeared.  There are outlaws everywhere, and it's more than a theory that the public officials are in league with them.\"  \"What a joke if we find the old family castle is a nest of robbers,\" smiled Monty.  \"Still!\" corrected Fred.  I was watching the consul's eyes.  He was troubled, but the prospect of massacre did not account for all of his expression.  There was debate, inspiration against conviction, being fought out under cover of forced calm.  Inspiration won the day.  \"I was wondering,\" he said, and lit a fresh cigar while we waited for him to go on.  \"I vouch for my friends,\" said Monty.  \"It wasn't that.  I've no right to make the proposal--no official right whatever--I'm speaking strictly unofficially--in fact, it's not a proposal at all--merely a notion.\"  He paused to give himself a last chance, but indiscretion was too strong.  \"I was wondering how far you four men would go to save twenty or thirty thousand lives.\"  \"You've no call to wonder about that,\" said Will.  \"Suppose you tell us what you've got in mind,\" suggested Monty, putting his long legs on a chair and producing a cigarette.  The consul knocked out his pipe and sat forward, beginning to talk a little faster, as a man who throws discretion to the winds.  \"I've no legal right to interfere.  None at all.  In case of a massacre of Armenians--men, women, little children--I could do nothing.  Make a fuss, of course.  Throw open the consulate to refugees.  Threaten a lot of things that I know perfectly well my government won't do. The Turks will be polite to my face and laugh behind my back, knowing I'm helpless.  But if you four men--\"  \"Yes--go on--what?\"  \"Spill it!\" urged Will.  \"--should be up-country, and I knew it for a fact, but did not know your precise whereabouts, I'd have a grown excuse for raising most particular old Harry!  You get my meaning?\"  \"Sure!\" said Will. \"Monty's an earl.  Fred's related to half the peerages in Burke.  Me and him\"--I was balancing my chair on one leg and he pushed me over backward by way of identification--\"just pose as distinguished members of society for the occasion.  I get you.\"  \"It might even be possible, Mr. Yerkes, to get the United States Congress to take action on your account.\"  \"Don't you believe it!\" laughed Will.  \"The members for the Parish Pump, and the senators from Ireland would howl about the Monroe Doctrine and Washington's advice at the merest hint of a Yankee in trouble in foreign parts.\"  \"What about the United States papers?\"  \"They'd think it was an English scheme to entangle the United States, and they'd be afraid to support action for fear of the Irish.  No, England's your only chance!\"  \"Well,\" said the consul, \"I've told you the whole idea.  If I should happen to know of four important individuals somewhere up-country, and massacres should break out after you had started, I could supply our ambassador with something good to work on.  The Turkish government might have to stop the massacre in the district in which you should happen to be.  That would save lives.\"  \"But could they stop it, once started?\" I asked.  \"They could try.  That 'ud be more than they ever did yet.\"  \"You mean,\" said Monty, \"that you'd like us to engage Kagig and make the trip, and to remain out in case of--ah--vukuart until we're rescued?\"  \"Can't say I like it, but that's what I mean.  And as for rescue, the longer the process takes the better, I imagine!\"  \"Hide, and have them hunt for us, eh?\"  \"Would it help,\" I suggested, \"if we were to be taken prisoner by outlaws and held for ransom?\"  \"It might,\" said the consul darkly.  \"I'd take to the hills myself and send back a wail for help, only my plain duty is here at the mission.  What I have suggested to you is mad quixotism at the best, and at the worst--well, do you recall what happened to poor Vyner, who was held for ransom by Greek brigands?  They sent a rescue party instead of money, and--\"  \"Charles Vyner was a friend of mine,\" said Monty quietly.  Fred began to look extremely cheerful and Will nudged me and nodded.  \"Remember,\" said the consul, \"in the present state of European politics there's no knowing what can or can't be done, but if you four men are absent in the hills I believe I can give the Turkish government so much to think about that there'll be no massacres in that one district.\"  \"Whistle up Kagig!\" Monty answered, and that was the end of the argument as far as yea or nay had anything to do with it.  Prospect of danger was the last thing likely to divide the party.  \"How about permits to travel?\" asked Will.  \"The United States consul told me none is to be had at present.\"  The consul rubbed his thumb and forefinger together.  \"It may cost a little more, that's all,\" he said.  \"You might go without, but you'd better submit to extortion.\"  He called the kavass, the uniformed consular attendant, and sent him in search of Kagig.  Within two minutes the Eye of Zeitoon was grinning at us through a small square window in the wall at one end of the veranda.  Then he came round and once more vaulted the veranda rail, for he seemed to hold ordinary means of entry in contempt. His eye looked very possessive for that of one seeking employment as a guide, but he stood at respectful attention until spoken to.  \"These gentlemen have decided to employ you,\" the consul announced.  \"Mashallah!\" (God be praised!)  For a Christian he used unusual expletives.  \"They want to find a castle in the mountains, to hunt bear and boar, and to see Zeitoon.\"  \"I shall lead them to ten castles never seen before by Eenglismen! They shall kill all the bears and pigs!  Never was such sport as they shall see!\"  He exploded the word pigs as if he had the Osmanli prejudice against that animal.  Yet he wore a pig-skin cartridge belt about his middle.  \"They will need enormous lots of ammunition!\" he announced.  \"What else would the roadside robbers like them to bring?\"  \"No Turkish servants!  They throw Turks over a bridge-side in Zeitoon! I myself will provide servants, who shall bring them back safely!\"  It seemed to me that he breathed inward as he said that.  A Turk would have added \"Inshallah!\"--if God wills!  \"Make ready for a journey of two months,\" he said.  \"When and where shall the start be?\"  It would obviously be unwise to start from the consulate.  \"From the Yeni Khan in Tarsus,\" said Will.  \"That is very good--that is excellent!  I will send Zeitoonli servants to the Yeni Khan at once.  Pay them the right price.  Have you horses? Camels are of no use, nor yet are wheels--you shall know why later! Mules are best.\"  \"I know where you can hire mules,\" said the consul, \"with a Turkish muleteer to each pair.\"  \"Oh, well!\" laughed Kagig, leaning back against the rail and moving his hands palms upward as if he weighed one thought against another. \"What is the difference?  If a few Turks move or less come to an end over Zeitoon bridge--\"  It was only for moments at a time that he seemed able to force himself to speak as our inferior.  A Turk of the guide class would likely have knelt and placed a foot of each of us on his neck in turn as soon as he knew we had engaged him.  This Armenian seemed made of other stuff.  \"Then be on hand to-morrow morning,\" ordered Monty.  But the Eye of Zeitoon had another surprise for us.  \"I shall meet you on the road,\" he announced with an air of a social equal.  \"Servants shall attend you at the Yeni Khan.  They will say nothing at all, and work splendidly!  Start when you like;  you will find me waiting for you at a good place on the road.  Bring not plenty, but too much ammunition!  Good day, then, gentlemen!\"  He nodded to us--bowed to the consul--vaulted the rail.  A second later he grinned at us again through the tiny window.  \"I am the Eye of Zeitoon!\" he boasted, and was gone.  A servant whom the consul sent to follow him came back after ten or fifteen minutes saying he had lost him in a maze of narrow streets.  His latter, offhanded manner scarcely auguring well, we debated whether or not to search for some one more likely amenable to discipline to take his place.  But the consul spent an hour telling us about the letter that went to Adrianople, and the bringing back of the answer that hastened peace.  \"He was shot badly.  He nearly died on the way back.  I've no idea how he recovered.  He wouldn't accept a piaster more than the price agreed on.\"  \"Let's take a chance!\" said Will, and we were all agreed before he urged it.  \"There's one other thing,\" said the consul.  \"I've been told a Miss Gloria Vanderrnan is on her way to the mission at Marash--\"  \"Gee whiz!\" said Will.  The consul nodded.  \"She's pretty, if that's what you mean.  It was very unwise to let her go, escorted only by Armenians.  Of course, she may get through without as much as suspecting trouble's brewing, but--well--I wish you'd look out for her.\"  \"Chicken, eh?\"  Will stuck both hands deep in his trousers pockets and tilted his chair backward to the point of perfect poise.  \"Cuckoo, you ass!\" laughed Fred, kicking the chair over backward, and then"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5241"],["title","The Eye of Zeitoon (#6)"],["body"," all the veranda furniture on top, to the scandalized amazement of the stately kavass, who came at that moment shepherding a small boy with a large tray and perfectly enormous drinks.     Chapter Three \"Sahib, there is always--work for real soldiers!\"   WHERE TWO OR THREE  Oh, all the world is sick with hate, And who shall heal it, friend o' mine? And who is friend? And who shall stand Since hireling tongue and alien hand Kill nobleness in all this land? Judas and Pharisee combine To plunder and proclaim it Fate.  Days when the upright dared be few Are they departed, friend o' mine? Are bribery and rich largesse Fair props for fat forgetfulness, Or anodynous of distress? Oh, would the world were drunk with wine And not this last besotting brew!  Oh, for the wonderful again-- The greatly daring, friend o' mine! The simply gallant blade unbought, The soul compassionate, unsought, With no price but the priceless thought Nor purpose than the brave design Of giving that the world may gain!   So we took two rooms at the Yeni Khan instead of one, not being minded to sleep as closely as the gentry of Asia Minor like to.  Will hurried us down there for a look at the gipsy girl.  But the tent was gone and the gipsies with it, and when we asked questions about them people spat.  Your good Moslem--and a Moslem is good in those parts who makes a mountain of observances, regarding mole-hills of mere morals not at all--affects to despise all giaours; but a giaour, like a gipsy, who has no obvious religion of any kind, he ranks below the pig in order of reverence.  It did not redound to our credit that we showed interest in the movements of such people.  Monty brought an enormous can of bug-powder with him, and restored our popularity by lending generously after he had treated our quarters sufficiently for three days' stay.  Fred did nothing to our quarters--stirred no finger, claiming convalescence with his tongue in his cheek, and strolling about until he fell utterly in love with the khan and its crowd, and the khan with him.  That very first night he brought out his concertina on the balcony, and yowled songs to its clamor;  and whether or not the various crowd agreed on naming the noise music, all were delighted with the friendliness.  Fred talks more languages fluently than he can count on the fingers of both hands.  He began to tell tales in a sing-song eastern snarl--a tale in Persian, then in Turkish, and the night grew breathless, full of listening, until pent-up interest at intervals burst bonds and there were \"Ahs\" and \"Ohs\" all amid the dark, like little breaths of night wind among trees.  He found small time for sleep, and when dawn came, and four Zeitoonli servants according to Kagig's promise, they still swarmed around him begging for more.  He went off to eat breakfast with a khan from Bokhara, sitting on a bale of nearly priceless carpets to drink overland tea made in a thing like a samovar.  All the rest of that day, and the next, sleeping only at intervals, while Monty and Will and I helped the Zeitoonli servants get our loads in shape, Fred sharpened his wonder-gift of tongues on the fascinated men of many nations, giving them London ditties and tales from the Thousand Nights and a Night in exchange for their news of caravan routes.  He left them well pleased with their bargain.  Monty went off alone the second day to see about mules.  The Turk with a trade to make believes that of several partners one is always \"easier\" than the rest;  consequently, one man can bring him to see swifter reason than a number can.  He came back that evening with twelve good mules and four attendants.  \"One apiece to ride, and two apiece to carry everything.  Not another mule to be had.  Unpack the loads again and make them smaller!\"  Fred came and sat with us that night before the charcoal brazier in his and Monty's room.  \"They all talk of robbers on the road,\" he said.  \"Northward, through the Circassian Gates, or eastward it's all the same.  There's a man in a room across the way who was stripped stark naked and beaten because they thought he might have money in his clothes.  When he reached this place without a stitch on him he still had all his money in his clenched fists!  Quite a sportsman--what?  Imagine his juggling with it while they whipped him with knotted cords!\"  \"What have you heard about Kagig?\"  \"Nothing.  But a lot about vukuart.*  It's vague, but there's something in the air.  You'll notice the Turkish muleteers are having nothing whatever to say to our Zeitoonli, although they've accepted the same service.  Moslems are keeping together, and Armenians are getting the silence cure.  Armenians are even shy of speaking to one another. I've tried listening, and I've tried asking questions, although that was risky.  I can't get a word of explanation.  I've noticed, though, that the ugly mood is broadening.  They've been polite to me, but I've heard the word shapkali applied more than once to you fellows. Means hatted man, you know.  Not a serious insult, but implies contempt.\"  -------------- * Turkish word:  happenings, a euphemism for massacre. --------------  Nothing but comfort and respectability ever seemed able to make Fred gloomy.  He discussed our present prospects with the air of an epicure ordering dinner.  And Monty listened with his dark, delightful smile--the kindliest smile in all the world.  I have seen unthoughtful men mistake it for a sign of weakness.  I have never known him to argue.  Nor did he then, but strode straight down into the khan yard, we sitting on the balcony to watch.  He visited our string of mules first for an excuse, and invited a Kurdish chieftain (all Kurds are chieftains away from home) to inspect a swollen fetlock.  With that subtle flattery he unlocked the man's reserve, passed on from chance remark to frank, good-humored questions, and within an hour had talked with twenty men.  At last he called to one of the Zeitoonli to come and scrape the yard dung from his boots, climbed the stairs leisurely, and sat beside us.  \"You're quite right, Fred,\" he said quietly.  Then there came suddenly from out the darkness a yell for help in English that brought three of us to our feet.  Fred brushed his fierce mustaches upward with an air of satisfaction, and sat still.  \"There's somebody down there quite wrong, and in line at last to find out why!\" he said.  \"I've been waiting for this.  Sit down.\"  We obeyed him, though the yells continued.  There came blows suggestive of a woman on the housetops beating carpets.  \"D'you recollect the man I mentioned at the consulate--the biped Peter Measel, missionary on his own account, who keeps a diary and libels ladies in it?  Well, he's foul of a thalukdar* from Rajputana, and of a Prussian contractor, recruiting men for work on the Baghdad railway.  I wasn't allowed to murder him.  I see why now--finger of justice--I'd have been too quick.  Sit down, you idiots!  You've no idea what he wrote about Miss Vanderman.  Let him scream, I like it!\"  --------------- * Punjabi Word--landholder. ---------------  \"Come along,\" said Monty.  \"If he were a bad-house keeper he has had enough!\"  But Will had gone before us, headlong down the stairs with the speed off the mark that they taught him on the playing field at Bowdoin. When we caught up he was standing astride a prostrate being who sobbed like a cow with its throat cut, and a Rajput and a German, either of them six feet tall, were considering whether or not to resent the violence of his interference.  The German was disposed to yield to numbers.  The Rajput not so.  \"Why are you beating him?\" asked Monty.  \"Gott in Hinimel, who would not!  He wrote of me in his diary--der Liminel!--that I shanghai laborers.\"  \"Do you, or don't you?\" asked Monty sweetly.  \"Kreutz-blitzen!  What is that to do with you--or with him?  What right had he to write that people in France should pray for me in church?\"  The Rajput all this while was standing simmering, as ready as a boar at bay to fight the lot of us, yet I thought with an air about him, too, of half-conscious surprise.  Several times he took a half-pace forward to assert his right of chastisement, looked hard at Monty, and checked mid-stride.  \"You've done enough,\" said Monty.  \"Who are you that says so?\" the German retorted.  \"He--who--will--attend--to--it--that--you--do--no--more!\"  Monty's smooth voce had become without inflection.  \"Bah!  That is easy, isn't it?  You are four to one!\"  \"Five to one!\"  The Rajput's gruff throat thrilled with a new emotion.  He sprang suddenly past me, and thrust himself between Monty and the German, who took advantage of the opportunity to walk away.  \"Lord Montdidier, colonel sahib bahadur, burra salaam!\"  He made no obeisance, but stood facing Monty eye to eye.  The words, as be roiled them out, were like an order given to a thousand men. One almost heard the swish of sabers as the squadrons came to the general salute.  \"I knew you, Rustum Khan, the minute I set eyes on you.  Why were you beating this man?\"  \"Sahib bahadur, because he wrote in his book that people in France should pray for me in church, naming my honorable name, because, says he--but I will not repeat what he says.  It is not seemly.\"  \"How do you know what is in his diary?\" Monty asked.  \"That German read it out to me.  We were sitting, he and I, discussing how the Turks intend to butcher the Armenians, as all the world knows is written.  They say it shall happen soon.  Said he to me--the German said to me--'I know another,' said he, 'who if I had my way should suffer first in that event.'  Saying which he showed the written book that he had found, and read me parts of it.  The German was for denouncing the fellow as a friend of Armenians, but I was for beating him at once, and I had my way.\"  \"Where is the book?\" demanded Monty.  \"The German has it.\"  \"The German has no right to it.\"  \"I will bring it.\"  Rustum Khan strode off into the night, and"]]]
