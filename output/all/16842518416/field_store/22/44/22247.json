There have not been wanting persons to disparage the “Analogy,” because it affords, as they say, no _direct_ proof of revelation. As well might we demand a discussion of chemistry in a work on astronomy. Scores of writers _prove_ Christianity, and here we have one to relieve us from the difficulties which beset it, and objections which still remain. There is an aspect in which the Analogy may be said to contribute the best of proof. What can go further towards establishing a point, than to demonstrate that there is no proof of the contrary? What can show the fallacy of a set of objections, more than to prove that they might be urged with no less force against the obvious course of nature? This use of analogy is conformable to the severest logic, and though offering no pretence of positive argument, goes far towards establishing full conviction. “The probabilities,” says STEWART, “resulting from a concurrence of different analogies, may rise so high as to produce an effect on the belief scarcely distinguishable from moral certainty.”  When it is considered that Butler’s argument is wholly in addition to the cumulative mass of direct and almost irresistible evidence, and removes even the objections which attend the subject, we see the rejection of Christianity to be inexpressibly rash and absurd. We see the skeptic condemned at his own bar, for acting in the most momentous of all possible concerns, in a manner the very opposite of that which he calls sensible and prudent in his ordinary affairs. The “Analogy” establishes, beyond cavil, strong _presumptions_ that Christianity is true, aside from all inspection of its proofs. The man, therefore, who really understands this book, and refuses to be a Christian, is led by his lusts and not his reason.  Some admirers of this book have lamented as a defect, its want of evangelical tincture, and its exclusive reference to natural things. To me, this is a prime recommendation. Were it otherwise, the reasoning would be in a circle. The very structure of the argument demands that it should avoid quotations from the Bible.  It must be admitted, however, that some expressions, taken just as they stand, without qualification by the current of the argument, tend to lead astray. For instance, “There is nothing in the human mind contrary to virtue.” “Men’s happiness and virtue are left to themselves.” “Religion requires nothing which we are not well able to perform.” “Our repentance is accepted, to eternal life.” “Our relations to God are made known by reason.” Such expressions are not to be taken alone, but as explained by the general drift of sentiment and doctrine. No one can be familiar with his works, without finding the fullest evidence that Christianity was to Butler infinitely more than a creed or a ritual. Nor should we forget that such expressions are not to be interpreted by the tenor of the “Analogy” only, but by that of his whole ‘Works.’  Even if it be judged that he everywhere fails to express himself in such phrase as we usually call evangelical, it should be remembered that he was a Church-of-England man, at a time when there was a powerful reaction against the evangelism of the Puritans, and when a real lack of emotional piety was general in his church.  That he did not enjoy in his last illness, which extended over a long period, that sustaining sense of the love of Christ which hearty Christians generally feel, is certain. A friend, trying to relieve his depression, reminded him of his excellent life, and especially his wide liberalities. He immediately replied, “l am but a steward! All is His, intrusted to me, to promote his glory and the good of mankind; how can I know that I have not abused the trust? I reflect on all these things, and they fill my soul with terror by the feeling of responsibility they awaken.”  On another occasion, his chaplain sought to soothe his troubled spirit by referring to the extensive influence of his _Analogy_ in reclaiming skeptics. His reply was, “I _began_ the Analogy with a view to the glory of God; but as I proceeded, visions of the fame it might bring me mingled themselves with my motives, and all was polluted and made sinful! The book may be a blessing to others, but it weighs like lead on my soul.” “Admit all this,” tenderly replied the chaplain; “yet has not Jesus said, ‘Whosoever cometh unto me shall in no wise be cast out’?” Instantly the Bishop raised himself in the bed, exclaiming, “How wonderful that the force of this passage never struck me before! ‘Whosoever,’--_all_, ALL! ‘In no wise,’--no amount of sin can prevent acceptance! Christ’s righteousness will hide the iniquities of _all_ who accept his offer of mercy!”  From that time, for weeks, Butler spoke to all who approached him, of a _full_ and _free_ salvation. He died triumphantly repeating this passage.  If all that is said of the lack of evangelical sentiment in Butler or his book be conceded, it certainly cannot impair either the value of the analogical argument, or the force of our author’s use of it.  Various circumstances conspire to make the study of “The Analogy” difficult. The nature of the reasoning--the conciseness, and often obscurity of the style--the dislocation of parts by frequent digressions--the arrest of a close course of reasoning to answer objections--and the abstruseness of the subject itself--combine to make the full comprehension of its import difficult. Mackintosh says, “No thinker so great, was ever so bad a writer.” But this, like some other objections of Sir James, is stated too strongly. The language is good, sinewy Saxon, and will endure when much that is now called fine writing, will seem grotesque. Still it is possible to write philosophy in better phrase, as has been shown by at least two great men, Berkeley and Stewart. Had Butler but possessed the glowing style of Berkeley, or the smooth, graceful, and transparent diction of Dugald Stewart, his work, instead of serving only for close thinkers, or a college text-book, would have been read by all classes, and banished that vulgar infidelity which flippant writers still disseminate. That it is thus restricted in its influence is a misfortune to the world. But he wrote for a class, and did his work completely. Literary infidelity was conquered. Vulgar, ignorant, licentious infidelity, will always exist, and is even now deplorably prevalent. Both Europe and America contain conceited and malignant ignoramuses, who by their sneers, their cavils, and their audacity, make havoc of souls. Of these, Tom Paine is a type, whose book, the contempt of cultivated minds, continues to be sold and read. For this class of persons, “Baxter’s Call,” or “Alleine’s Alarm,” are far more suitable than treatises on the evidences of Christianity, or even Butler’s Analogy.     Editor’s Preface.   The text is the result of a careful collation of the various principal editions. Occasionally solecisms are corrected, and a word transposed or put in italics, when a sentence could thus be made perspicuous. The author had a fashion of beginning a large proportion of his sentences with “and,” “but,” “now,” “indeed,” “however,” &c., which often served to perplex, and in such cases they have been omitted. Long paragraphs, comprehending different topics, have been so divided as to correspond with the true analysis; which will greatly assist the student in detecting the successive stages of the argument. Special pains has been taken to correct and improve the punctuation. Hundreds of sentences have thus been rendered more perspicuous, and many which were obscure, have been made lucid. In no respect was Butler’s style, as printed, so defective.  The Conspectus is made much ampler than any other, for this reason: that students are apt to content themselves with such help instead of mastering the full discussion by the author. In the present case they cannot so do, for such is the fulness of the Conspectus, that if they master this, they have mastered the subject itself in full.  Notes by the present editor are distinguished from those of the author by being enclosed in brackets. They are designed to open out further views, to elucidate the text, to facilitate extended researches, and to suggest topics for conversation in the class-room.  The Index has cost far more labor than would be supposed, and may not be of much benefit to the undergraduate. Its advantages will not be small to him in after life when he desires to recur to particular topics. The general scholar will find it enables him to make use of the book for occasional reference. Without it the work is not complete for the class-room, still less for the library.  That students of the Analogy need help, is confessed; and all attempts to furnish it have been kindly received. As is remarked by Bishop Wilson, “His argument, clear and convincing as it is to a prepared mind, is not obvious to the young reader, whose experience of life being small, and his habits of reflection feeble, has not the furniture necessary for comprehending, at first, the thoughts and conclusions of such a mind. The style is too close, too negligent, too obscure, to be suitable for the young.”  If it be asked why, with several existing helps to the study of the Analogy, I offer another, I frankly reply, because I have found none of them satisfactory, either to the public or to myself.         *       *       *       *       *  Some teachers prefer their text-books to be accompanied by a set of questions. Such will find in this edition all they desire. They have only to enunciate each sentence of the Conspectus in the interrogative form, and they will have every possible question prepared to their hand.     Conspectus of the Author’s Introduction.   I. _What is probable evidence?_    =1.= It differs from demonstration in that it admits of degrees; of   _all_ degrees.      1.) One probability does not beget assurance.      2.) But the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53346"],["title","The Analogy of Religion to the Constitution and Course of Nature (#4)"],["body","presumption makes a probability.      3.) The repetition of it may make certainty.    =2.= What constitutes probability is _likeness_; in regard to the   event itself, or its kind of evidences, or its circumstances.      1.) This daily affords presumptions, evidence, or conviction:     according as it is occasional, common, or constant.      2.) Measures our hopes and fears.      3.) Regulates our expectations as to men’s conduct.      4.) Enables us to judge of character from conduct.    =3.= It is an imperfect mode of judging, and adapted to beings of   limited capacities.    =4.= Where better evidence cannot be had, it constitutes moral   obligation, even though great doubts remain.      1.) We are as much bound to do what, on the whole, _appears_ to     be best, as if we _knew_ it to be so.      2.) In questions of great moment, it is reasonable to act when     the favorable chances are no greater than the unfavorable.      3.) There are numberless cases in which a man would be thought     distracted if he did not act, and that earnestly, where the     chances of success were _greatly against_ him.   II. _The use and application of probabilities_.  Shall not go further into the _nature_ of probable evidence, nor inquire _why_ likeness begets presumption and conviction; nor how far analogical reasoning can be reduced to a _system_; but shall only show how just and conclusive this mode of reasoning is.    =1.= In determining our judgments and practice.      1.) There may be cases in which its value is doubtful.      2.) There may be seeming analogies, which are not really such.      3.) But as a mode of argument, it is perfectly just and     conclusive.    =2.= In noting correspondencies between the different parts of God’s   government.      1.) We may expect to find the same sort of difficulties in the     Bible, as we do in Nature.      2.) To deny the Bible to be of God, because of these     difficulties, requires us to deny that the world was made by     him.      3.) If there be a likeness between revelation and the system of     nature, it affords a presumption that both have the same author.      4.) To reason on the construction and government of the world,     without settling foundation-principles, is mere hypothesis.      5.) To apply principles which are certain, to cases which are     not applicable, is no better.      6.) But to join abstract reasonings to the observation of     facts, and argue, from known present things, to what is likely     or credible, must be right.      7.) We cannot avoid acting thus, if we act at all.    =3.= In its application to religion, revealed, as well as natural.   This is the use which will be made of analogy in the following   work. In so using it,      1.) It will be taken for proved that there is an intelligent     Creator and Ruler.        --There are no presumptions _against_ this, prior to proof.        --There are proofs:--from analogy, reason, tradition, &c.        --The fact is not denied by the generality of skeptics.      2.) No regard will be paid to those who idly speculate as to how     the world _might_ have been made and governed.        --Such prating would amount to this:          · All creatures should have been made at first as happy as         they could be.          · Nothing of hazard should be put upon them.          · Should have been _secured_ in their happiness.          · All punishments avoided.        --It is a sufficient reply to such talk that mankind have not       faculties for such speculations.      3.) We are, to some extent, judges as to _ends_; and may     conclude that Nature and Providence are designed to produce     virtue and happiness; but of the _means_ of producing these in     the highest degree, we are not competent judges.        --We know not the extent of the universe;        --Nor even how one person can best be brought to perfection.        --We are not often competent to judge of the conduct of each       other.        --As to God, we may presume that order will prevail in his       universe; but are no judges of his modes for accomplishing       this end.      4.) Instead of vainly, and perhaps sinfully, imagining schemes     for God’s conduct, we must _study what is_.        --Discovering general laws.        --Comparing the known course of things with what revelation       teaches us to expect.   III. _The force of this use of Analogy._    =1.= Sometimes is practically equivalent to proof.    =2.= Confirms what is otherwise proved.    =3.= Shows that the system of revelation is no more open to   ridicule, than the system of nature.    =4.= Answers almost all objections against religion.    =5.= To a great extent answers objections against the _proofs_ of   religion.   IV. _General scope of the book._    =1.= The divine government is considered, as containing in it,      Chap. 1. Man’s future existence.        ”   2. In a state of reward or punishment.        ”   3. This according to our behavior.        ”   4. Our present life probationary.        ”   5. And also disciplinary.        ”   6. Notwithstanding the doctrine of necessity.        ”   7. Or any apparent want of wisdom or goodness.    =2.= Revealed religion is considered,      Chap. 1. As important.        ”   2. As proved by miracles.        ”   3. As containing strange things.        ”   4. As a scheme imperfectly comprehended.        ”   5. As carried on by a mediator.        ”   6. As having such an amount of evidence as God saw fit to give.        ”   7. As having sufficient and full evidence.   Conspectus of the Analogy.   PART I.   CHAPTER I.  A FUTURE LIFE.  Will not discuss the subject of identity; but will consider what analogy suggests from changes which do not destroy; and thus see whether it is not _probable_ that we shall live hereafter.   I. _The probabilities that we shall survive death._    =1.= It is a law of nature that creatures should exist in different   stages, and in various degrees of perfection.        --Worms turn into flies.        --Eggs are hatched into birds.        --Our own present state is as different from our state in the       womb, as two states of the same being can be.        --That we shall hereafter exist in a state as different from       the present as the present is from our state in the womb, is       according to analogy.    =2.= We now have capacities for happiness, action, misery, &c., and   there is always a probability that things will continue as they   are, except when experience gives us reason to think they will be   altered. This is a general law; and is our _only_ natural reason   for expecting the continuance of any thing.    =3.= There is no reason to apprehend that death will destroy us.   If there was, it would arise from the nature of death; or from the   analogy of nature.      1.) Not from the nature of death.        --We know not what death is.        --But only _some_ of its _effects_.        --These effects do not imply the destruction of the living       agent.        --We know little of what the _exercise_ of our powers depends       upon; and nothing of what _the powers_ themselves depend on.        --We may be unable to _exercise_ our powers, and yet not lose       them--_e.g._ sleep, swoon.      2.) Not from analogy.        --Reason shows no connection between death and our       destruction.        --We have no faculties by which to trace any being beyond it.        --The possession of living powers, up to the very moment       when our faculties cease to be able to trace them, is a       probability of their continuing.        --We have already survived wonderful changes.        --To live after death is analogous to the course of nature.   II. _Presumptions against a future life._    =1.= That death _destroys_ us.      _Ans._ 1. This is an assumption that we are compound and     material beings, and hence discerptible; which is not true.        1.) Consciousness is a single, indivisible power, and of       course the subject of it must be.        2.) The material body is not ourself.        3.) We can easily conceive of our having more limbs, or of       a different kind, or of having more or fewer senses, or of       having no bodies at all, or of hereafter animating these same       bodies, remodelled.        4.) The dissolution of a succession of new and strange       bodies, would have no tendency to destroy _us_.      _Ans._ 2. Though the absolute simplicity of the living being     cannot be proved by _experiment_, yet facts lead us so to     conclude. We lose limbs, &c. Our bodies were once _very_ small,     but we might, then, have lost part of them. There is a constant     destruction and renewal going on.        1.) Thus we see that no certain _bulk_ is necessary to our       existence, and unless it were proved that there is, and that       it is larger than an indissoluble atom, there is no reason to       presume that death destroys us, even if we are discerptible.        2.) The living agent is not an _internal material organism_,       which dies with the body. Because          --Our only ground for this presumption is our relation to         other systems of matter. But we see these are not necessary         to us.          --It will not do to say that lost portions of the body were         not _essential_--who is to determine?          --The relation between the living agent, and the most         essential parts of the body, is only one by which they         mutually affect each other.        3.) If we regard our body as made up of organs of sense, we       come to the same result.          --We see with the eyes, just as we do with glasses. The eye         is not a _recipient_, any more than a telescope.          --It is not pretended that vision, hearing, &c. can be         traced clear up to the percipient; but so far as we can         trace perceptions, the _organ_ does not perceive.          --In dreams we perceive without organs.          --"]]]
