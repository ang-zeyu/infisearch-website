Nous avons à emprunter de l'Amérique, autant qu'à lui apporter. Si notre civilisation plus ancienne est plus raffinée, comment ne se retournerait-elle pas vers les exemples de vigueur, de réalisme et d'énergie, qui lui sont donnés par le jeune continent? Nos vieilles villes ont leurs cathédrales et leurs donjons; ses villes récentes ont leurs usines et leurs gratte-ciels. Nous suons l'histoire, ils respirent l'avenir; toutes les grandeurs ont leur efficacité et leur poésie.  La première pensée fut de grouper, en France, les hommes qui s'intéressent aux Amériques, dans l'espoir de grouper, un jour, aux Amériques, les hommes qui s'intéressent à la France, et, si c'était possible, de réunir ces bonnes volontés dispersées en un faisceau qui, par le simple rapprochement, deviendrait une force.  Les concours que le Comité a recueillis ont été si nombreux que, dès 1911, le nombre de ses membres actifs et de ses adhérents approchait du millier. Après avoir organisé ainsi en France une base solide, il a fondé des comités correspondants en Amérique; les premiers se sont fondés à Montréal et à la Nouvelle-Orléans; d'autres sont créés ou en voie de formation à New-York, Sao-Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, La Havane, Montévidéo, Buenos-Ayres et Santiago.  D'autre part, une section de propagande organise, depuis le 1er janvier 1912, un service de renseignements en Amérique sur le tourisme en France, l'enseignement français et les produits de l'industrie française. Enfin depuis le mois de mars 1912 des sections nationales ont été fondées; celle des États-Unis a comme membres de son bureau le général Brugère, M. E. Tuck, le président de la Chambre de commerce américaine, M. Boutroux et M. d'Estournelles de Constant.  Le Comité central de Paris, qui a son siège social, 21, rue Cassette, se compose d'un bureau, d'un conseil de direction, de membres actifs et d'adhérents. Le bureau est actuellement formé des personnes suivantes:  _Président_: M. Gabriel HANOTAUX, de l'Académie française, ancien ministre des Affaires étrangères.  _Vice-présidents_: MM. le général BRUGÈRE; Anatole LEROY-BEAULIEU, de l'Institut, directeur de l'École des Sciences Politiques; HEURTEAU, délégué général du Conseil d'administration de la Compagnie d'Orléans; Vicomte Robert DE CAIX DE SAINT-AYMOUR.  _Trésorier_: M. le Comte R. DE VOGÜÉ.  _Secrétaire général_: M. Gabriel-Louis JARAY, auditeur au Conseil d'État.   Le Comité publie depuis le 1er janvier 1910, une revue mensuelle, _France-Amérique_, qui est la propriété du Comité[4].    [4] Cotisation minimum des adhérents, donnant droit au service de la   Revue et prix d'abonnement: France: 24 francs; Amérique: 25 francs;   Étranger: 26 francs.  Siège social: 21, rue Cassette, Paris, VIe; spécimen sur demande. Cette revue étudie la vie des nations américaines dans toutes leurs manifestations, politiques, nationales, économiques, financières, sociales, intellectuelles, artistiques, etc... Elle a publié régulièrement des articles et chroniques des auteurs les plus connus et les plus compétents. C'est une revue de luxe, qui paraît sur 92 pages de grand format, publie chaque mois des gravures ou cartes en planche hors texte sur papier couché et a un supplément mensuel consacré au Canada.   En 1912, cette revue a offert à ses lecteurs deux séries d'articles sur les chemins de fer en Amérique et sur les relations des ports et centres commerciaux en France avec l'Amérique. Enfin, pour faire de plus en plus de cette Revue le grand périodique américain de langue française, le Comité développe les chroniques mensuelles, en les groupant sous trois rubriques: la vie économique, commerciale et financière; la vie politique et internationale; la vie intellectuelle, sociale et artistique. Désormais ses lecteurs trouvent soit mensuellement, soit périodiquement, à côté des chroniques spéciales à chaque pays d'Amérique, les chroniques générales suivantes: Finances publiques: budget, dette et circulation monétaire, par M. F. Lefort; Chronique commerciale: produits, changes et frets d'Amérique, par M. P. Gebhard; Propriété industrielle, littéraire et artistique, par M. Georges Chabaud, avocat à la Cour d'appel; Actes et faits internationaux, par M. Georges Salle, professeur à l'Université de Lille; Cartographie américaine, par M. le capitaine Périer, du service géographique de l'armée; Antiquités américaines, par le docteur Rivet, assistant au Muséum, etc.  _France-Amérique_ est la revue d'un Comité dont l'œuvre est faite de dévouement désintéressé, de souci patriotique, d'amitié franco-américaine et de conciliation des intérêts de pays américains et de la France.

CHAPTER I. The Pleasant Fiction of the Presumption of Innocence   There was a great to-do some years ago in the city of New York over an ill-omened young person, Duffy by name, who, falling into the bad graces of the police, was most incontinently dragged to headquarters and \"mugged\" without so much as \"By your leave, sir,\" on the part of the authorities. Having been photographed and measured (in most humiliating fashion) he was turned loose with a gratuitous warning to behave himself in the future and see to it that he did nothing which might gain him even more invidious treatment.  Now, although many thousands of equally harmless persons had been similarly treated, this particular outrage was made the occasion of a vehement protest to the mayor of the city by a certain member of the judiciary, who pointed out that such things in a civilized community were shocking beyond measure, and called upon the mayor to remove the commissioner of police and all his staff of deputy commissioners for openly violating the law which they were sworn to uphold. But, the commissioner of police, who had sometimes enforced the penal statutes in a way to make him unpopular with machine politicians, saw nothing wrong in what he had done, and, what was more, said so most outspokenly. The judge said, \"You did,\" and the commissioner said, \"I didn't.\" Specifically, the judge was complaining of what had been done to Duffy, but more generally he was charging the police with despotism and oppression and with systematically disregarding the sacred liberties of the citizens which it was their duty to protect.  Accordingly the mayor decided to look into the matter for himself, and after a lengthy investigation came to the alleged conclusion that the \"mugging\" of Duffy was a most reprehensible thing and that all those who were guilty of having any part therein should be instantly removed from office. He, therefore, issued a pronunciamento to the commissioner demanding the official heads of several of his subordinates, which order the commissioner politely declined to obey. The mayor thereupon removed him and appointed a successor, ostensibly for the purpose of having in the office a man who should conduct the police business of the city with more regard for the liberties of the inhabitants thereof. The judge who had started the rumpus expressed himself as very much pleased and declared that now at last a new era had dawned wherein the government was to be administered with a due regard for law.  Now, curiously enough, although the judge had demanded the removal of the commissioner on the ground that he had violated the law and been guilty of tyrannous and despotic conduct, the mayor had ousted him not for pursuing an illegal course in arresting and \"mugging\" a presumptively innocent man (for illegal it most undoubtedly was), but for inefficiency and maladministration in his department.  Said the mayor in his written opinion:   \"After thinking over this matter with the greatest care, I am led to the conclusion that as mayor of the city of New York I should not order the police to stop taking photographs of people arrested and accused of crime or who have been indicted by grand juries. That grave injustice may occur the Duffy case has demonstrated, but I feel that it is not the taking of the photograph that has given cause to the injustice, but the inefficiency and maladministration of the police department, etc.\"  In other words, the mayor set the seal of his official approval upon the very practice which caused the injustice to Duffy. \"Mugging\" was all right, so long as you \"mugged\" the right persons.  The situation thus outlined was one of more than passing interest. A sensitive point in our governmental nervous system had been touched and a condition uncovered that sooner or later must be diagnosed and cured.  For the police have no right to arrest and photograph a citizen unconvicted of crime, since it is contrary to law. And it is ridiculous to assert that the very guardians of the law may violate it so long as they do so judiciously and do not molest the Duffys. The trouble goes deeper than that. The truth is that we are up against that most delicate of situations, the concrete adjustment of a theoretical individual right to a practical necessity. The same difficulty has always existed and will always continue to exist whenever emergencies requiring prompt and decisive action arise or conditions obtain that must be handled effectively without too much discussion. It is easy while sitting on the piazza with your cigar to recognize the rights of your fellow-men, you may assert most vigorously the right of the citizen to immunity from arrest without legal cause, but if you saw a seedy character sneaking down a side street at three o'clock in the morning, his pockets bulging with jewelry and silver! Would you have the policeman on post insist on the fact that a burglary had been committed being established beyond peradventure before arresting the suspect, who in the meantime would undoubtedly escape? Of course, the worthy officer sometimes does this, but his conduct in that case becomes the subject of an investigation on the part of his superiors. In fact, the rules of the New York police department require him to arrest all persons carrying bags in the small hours who cannot give a satisfactory account of themselves. Yet there is no such thing under the laws of the State as a right \"to arrest on suspicion.\" No citizen may be arrested under the statutes unless a crime has actually been committed. Thus, the police regulations deliberately compel every officer either to violate the law or to be made the subject of charges for dereliction of duty. A confusing state of things, truly, to a man who wants to do his duty by himself and by his fellow-citizens!  The present author once wrote a book dealing with the practical administration of criminal justice, in which the unlawfulness of arrest on mere \"suspicion\" was discussed at length and given a prominent place. But when the time came for publication that portion of it was omitted at the earnest solicitation of certain of the authorities on the ground that as such arrests were absolutely necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law a public exposition of their illegality would do infinite harm. Now, as it seems, the time has come when the facts, for one reason or another, should be faced. The difficulty does not end, however, with \"arrest on suspicion,\" \"the third degree,\" \"mugging,\" or their allied abuses. It really goes to the root of our whole theory of the administration of the criminal law. Is it possible that on final analysis we may find that our enthusiastic insistence upon certain of the supposedly fundamental liberties of the individual has led us into a condition of legal hypocrisy vastly less desirable than the frank attitude of our continental neighbors toward such subjects?  The Massachusetts Constitution of 1785 concludes with the now famous words: \"To the end that this may be a government of laws and not of men.\" That is the essence of the spirit of American government. Our forefathers had arisen and thrown off the yoke of England and her intolerable system of penal government, in which an accused had no right to testify in his own behalf and under which he could be hung for stealing a sheep. \"Liberty!\" \"Liberty or death!\" That was the note ringing in the minds and mouths of the signers of the Declaration and framers of the Constitution. That is the popular note to-day of the Fourth of July orator and of the Memorial Day address. This liberty was to be guaranteed by laws in such a way that it was never to be curtailed or violated. No mere man was to be given an opportunity to tamper with it. The individual was to be protected at all costs. No king, or sheriff, or judge, or officer was to lay his finger on a free man save at his peril. If he did, the free man might immediately have his \"law\"--\"have the law on him,\" as the good old expression was--for no king or sheriff was above the law. In fact, we were so energetic in providing safeguards for the individual, even when a wrong-doer, that we paid very little attention to the effectiveness of kings or sheriffs or what we had substituted for them. And so it is to-day. What candidate for office, what silver-tongued orator or senator, what demagogue or preacher could hold his audience or capture a vote if, when it came to a question of liberty, he should lift up his voice in behalf of the rights of the majority as against the individual?  Accordingly in devising our laws We have provided in every possible way for the freedom of the citizen from all interference on the part of the authorities. No one may be stopped, interrogated, examined, or arrested unless a crime has been committed. Every one is presumed to be innocent until shown to be guilty by the verdict of a jury. No one's premises may be entered or searched without a warrant which the law renders it difficult to obtain. Every accused has the right to testify in his own behalf, like any other witness. The fact that he has been held for a crime by a magistrate and indicted by a grand jury places him at not the slightest disadvantage so far as defending himself against the charge is concerned, for he must be proven guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. These illustrations of the jealousy of the law for the rights of citizens might be multiplied to no inconsiderable extent. Further, our law allows a defendant convicted of crime to appeal to the highest courts, whereas if he be acquitted the people or State of New York have no right of appeal at all.  Without dwelling further on the matter it is enough to say that in general the State constitutions, their general laws, or"]]]
