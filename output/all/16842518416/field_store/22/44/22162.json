I gave you a hint some time ago that your attentions were not welcome to Miss Bewery.”  Bryce made no immediate response. Instead, leaning almost carelessly and indifferently against the table at which he had been busy with drugs and bottles, he took a small file from his waistcoat pocket and began to polish his carefully cut nails.  “Yes?” he said, after a pause. “Well?”  “In spite of it,” continued Ransford, “you've since addressed her again on the matter--not merely once, but twice.”  Bryce put his file away, and thrusting his hands in his pockets, crossed his feet as he leaned back against the table--his whole attitude suggesting, whether meaningly or not, that he was very much at his ease.  “There's a great deal to be said on a point like this,” he observed. “If a man wishes a certain young woman to become his wife, what right has any other man--or the young woman herself, for that matter to say that he mustn't express his desires to her?”  “None,” said Ransford, “provided he only does it once--and takes the answer he gets as final.”  “I disagree with you entirely,” retorted Bryce. “On the last particular, at any rate. A man who considers any word of a woman's as being final is a fool. What a woman thinks on Monday she's almost dead certain not to think on Tuesday. The whole history of human relationship is on my side there. It's no opinion--it's a fact.”  Ransford stared at this frank remark, and Bryce went on, coolly and imperturbably, as if he had been discussing a medical problem.  “A man who takes a woman's first answer as final,” he continued, “is, I repeat, a fool. There are lots of reasons why a woman shouldn't know her own mind at the first time of asking. She may be too surprised. She mayn't be quite decided. She may say one thing when she really means another. That often happens. She isn't much better equipped at the second time of asking. And there are women--young ones--who aren't really certain of themselves at the third time. All that's common sense.”  “I'll tell you what it is!” suddenly exclaimed Ransford, after remaining silent for a moment under this flow of philosophy. “I'm not going to discuss theories and ideas. I know one young woman, at any rate, who is certain of herself. Miss Bewery does not feel any inclination to you--now, nor at any time to be! She's told you so three times. And--you should take her answer and behave yourself accordingly!”  Bryce favoured his senior with a searching look.  “How does Miss Bewery know that she mayn't be inclined to--in the future?” he asked. “She may come to regard me with favour.”  “No, she won't!” declared Ransford. “Better hear the truth, and be done with it. She doesn't like you--and she doesn't want to, either. Why can't you take your answer like a man?”  “What's your conception of a man?” asked Bryce.  “That!--and a good one,” exclaimed Ransford.  “May satisfy you--but not me,” said Bryce. “Mine's different. My conception of a man is of a being who's got some perseverance. You can get anything in this world--anything!--by pegging away for it.”  “You're not going to get my ward,” suddenly said Ransford. “That's flat! She doesn't want you--and she's now said so three times. And--I support her.”  “What have you against me?” asked Bryce calmly. “If, as you say, you support her in her resolution not to listen to my proposals, you must have something against me. What is it?”  “That's a question you've no right to put,” replied Ransford, “for it's utterly unnecessary. So I'm not going to answer it. I've nothing against you as regards your work--nothing! I'm willing to give you an excellent testimonial.”  “Oh!” remarked Bryce quietly. “That means--you wish me to go away?”  “I certainly think it would be best,” said Ransford.  “In that case,” continued Bryce, more coolly than ever, “I shall certainly want to know what you have against me--or what Miss Bewery has against me. Why am I objected to as a suitor? You, at any rate, know who I am--you know that my father is of our own profession, and a man of reputation and standing, and that I myself came to you on high recommendation. Looked at from my standpoint, I'm a thoroughly eligible young man. And there's a point you forget--there's no mystery about me!”  Ransford turned sharply in his chair as he noticed the emphasis which Bryce put on his last word.  “What do you mean?” he demanded.  “What I've just said,” replied Bryce. “There's no mystery attaching to me. Any question about me can be answered. Now, you can't say that as regards your ward. That's a fact, Dr. Ransford.”  Ransford, in years gone by, had practised himself in the art of restraining his temper--naturally a somewhat quick one. And he made a strong effort in that direction now, recognizing that there was something behind his assistant's last remark, and that Bryce meant him to know it was there.  “I'll repeat what I've just said,” he answered. “What do you mean by that?”  “I hear things,” said Bryce. “People will talk--even a doctor can't refuse to hear what gossiping and garrulous patients say. Since she came to you from school, a year ago, Wrychester people have been much interested in Miss Bewery, and in her brother, too. And there are a good many residents of the Close--you know their nice, inquisitive ways!--who want to know who the sister and brother really are--and what your relationship is to them!”  “Confound their impudence!” growled Ransford.  “By all means,” agreed Bryce. “And--for all I care--let them be confounded, too. But if you imagine that the choice and select coteries of a cathedral town, consisting mainly of the relicts of deceased deans, canons, prebendaries and the like, and of maiden aunts, elderly spinsters, and tea-table-haunting curates, are free from gossip--why, you're a singularly innocent person!”  “They'd better not begin gossiping about my affairs,” said Ransford. “Otherwise--”  “You can't stop them from gossiping about your affairs,” interrupted Bryce cheerfully. “Of course they gossip about your affairs; have gossiped about them; will continue to gossip about them. It's human nature!”  “You've heard them?” asked Ransford, who was too vexed to keep back his curiosity. “You yourself?”  “As you are aware, I am often asked out to tea,” replied Bryce, “and to garden-parties, and tennis-parties, and choice and cosy functions patronized by curates and associated with crumpets. I have heard--with these ears. I can even repeat the sort of thing I have heard. 'That dear, delightful Miss Bewery--what a charming girl! And that good-looking boy, her brother--quite a dear! Now I wonder who they really are? Wards of Dr. Ransford, of course! Really, how very romantic!--and just a little--eh?--unusual? Such a comparatively young man to have such a really charming girl as his ward! Can't be more than forty-five himself, and she's twenty--how very, very romantic! Really, one would think there ought to be a chaperon!'”  “Damn!” said Ransford under his breath.  “Just so,” agreed Bryce. “But--that's the sort of thing. Do you want more? I can supply an unlimited quantity in the piece if you like. But it's all according to sample.”  “So--in addition to your other qualities,” remarked Ransford, “you're a gossiper?”  Bryce smiled slowly and shook his head.  “No,” he replied. “I'm a listener. A good one, too. But do you see my point? I say--there's no mystery about me. If Miss Bewery will honour me with her hand, she'll get a man whose antecedents will bear the strictest investigation.”  “Are you inferring that hers won't?” demanded Ransford.  “I'm not inferring anything,” said Bryce. “I am speaking for myself, of myself. Pressing my own claim, if you like, on you, the guardian. You might do much worse than support my claims, Dr. Ransford.”  “Claims, man!” retorted Ransford. “You've got no claims! What are you talking about? Claims!”  “My pretensions, then,” answered Bryce. “If there is a mystery--as Wrychester people say there is--about Miss Bewery, it would be safe with me. Whatever you may think, I'm a thoroughly dependable man--when it's in my own interest.”  “And--when it isn't?” asked Ransford. “What are you then?--as you're so candid.”  “I could be a very bad enemy,” replied Bryce.  There was a moment's silence, during which the two men looked attentively at each other.  “I've told you the truth,” said Ransford at last. “Miss Bewery flatly refuses to entertain any idea whatever of ever marrying you. She earnestly hopes that that eventuality may never be mentioned to her again. Will you give me your word of honour to respect her wishes?”  “No!” answered Bryce. “I won't!”  “Why not?” asked Ransford, with a faint show of anger. “A woman's wishes!”  “Because I may consider that I see signs of a changed mind in her,” said Bryce. “That's why.”  “You'll never see any change of mind,” declared Ransford. “That's certain. Is that your fixed determination?”  “It is,” answered Bryce. “I'm not the sort of man who is easily repelled.”  “Then, in that case,” said Ransford, “we had better part company.” He rose from his desk, and going over to a safe which stood in a corner, unlocked it and took some papers from an inside drawer. He consulted one of these and turned to Bryce. “You remember our agreement?” he continued. “Your engagement was to be determined by a three months' notice on either side, or, at my will, at any time by payment of three months' salary?”  “Quite right,” agreed Bryce. “I remember, of course.”  “Then I'll give you a cheque for three months' salary--now,” said Ransford, and sat down again at his desk. “That will settle matters definitely--and, I hope, agreeably.”  Bryce made no reply. He remained leaning against the table, watching Ransford write the cheque. And when Ransford laid the cheque down at the edge of the desk he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],["title","The Paradise Mystery (#3)"],["body","no movement towards it.  “You must see,” remarked Ransford, half apologetically, “that it's the only thing I can do. I can't have any man who's not--not welcome to her, to put it plainly--causing any annoyance to my ward. I repeat, Bryce--you must see it!”  “I have nothing to do with what you see,” answered Bryce. “Your opinions are not mine, and mine aren't yours. You're really turning me away--as if I were a dishonest foreman!--because in my opinion it would be a very excellent thing for her and for myself if Miss Bewery would consent to marry me. That's the plain truth.”  Ransford allowed himself to take a long and steady look at Bryce. The thing was done now, and his dismissed assistant seemed to be taking it quietly--and Ransford's curiosity was aroused.  “I can't make you out!” he exclaimed. “I don't know whether you're the most cynical young man I ever met, or whether you're the most obtuse--”  “Not the last, anyway,” interrupted Bryce. “I assure you of that!”  “Can't you see for yourself, then, man, that the girl doesn't want you!”  said Ransford. “Hang it!--for anything you know to the contrary, she may have--might have--other ideas!”  Bryce, who had been staring out of a side window for the last minute or two, suddenly laughed, and, lifting a hand, pointed into the garden. And Ransford turned--and saw Mary Bewery walking there with a tall lad, whom he recognized as one Sackville Bonham, stepson of Mr. Folliot, a wealthy resident of the Close. The two young people were laughing and chatting together with evident great friendliness.  “Perhaps,” remarked Bryce quietly, “her ideas run in--that direction? In which case, Dr. Ransford, you'll have trouble. For Mrs. Folliot, mother of yonder callow youth, who's the apple of her eye, is one of the inquisitive ladies of whom I've just told you, and if her son unites himself with anybody, she'll want to know exactly who that anybody is. You'd far better have supported me as an aspirant! However--I suppose there's no more to say.”  “Nothing!” answered Ransford. “Except to say good-day--and good-bye to you. You needn't remain--I'll see to everything. And I'm going out now. I think you'd better not exchange any farewells with any one.”  Bryce nodded silently, and Ransford, picking up his hat and gloves, left the surgery by the side door. A moment later, Bryce saw him crossing the Close.     CHAPTER III. ST. WRYTHA'S STAIR   The summarily dismissed assistant, thus left alone, stood for a moment in evident deep thought before he moved towards Ransford's desk and picked up the cheque. He looked at it carefully, folded it neatly, and put it away in his pocket-book; after that he proceeded to collect a few possessions of his own, instruments, books from various drawers and shelves. He was placing these things in a small hand-bag when a gentle tap sounded on the door by which patients approached the surgery.  “Come in!” he called.  There was no response, although the door was slightly ajar; instead, the knock was repeated, and at that Bryce crossed the room and flung the door open.  A man stood outside--an elderly, slight-figured, quiet-looking man, who looked at Bryce with a half-deprecating, half-nervous air; the air of a man who was shy in manner and evidently fearful of seeming to intrude. Bryce's quick, observant eyes took him in at a glance, noting a much worn and lined face, thin grey hair and tired eyes; this was a man, he said to himself, who had seen trouble. Nevertheless, not a poor man, if his general appearance was anything to go by--he was well and even expensively dressed, in the style generally affected by well-to-do merchants and city men; his clothes were fashionably cut, his silk hat was new, his linen and boots irreproachable; a fine diamond pin gleamed in his carefully arranged cravat. Why, then, this unmistakably furtive and half-frightened manner--which seemed to be somewhat relieved at the sight of Bryce?  “Is this--is Dr. Ransford within?” asked the stranger. “I was told this is his house.”  “Dr. Ransford is out,” replied Bryce. “Just gone out--not five minutes ago. This is his surgery. Can I be of use?”  The man hesitated, looking beyond Bryce into the room.  “No, thank you,” he said at last. “I--no, I don't want professional services--I just called to see Dr. Ransford--I--the fact is, I once knew some one of that name. It's no matter--at present.”  Bryce stepped outside and pointed across the Close.  “Dr. Ransford,” he said, “went over there--I rather fancy he's gone to the Deanery--he has a case there. If you went through Paradise, you'd very likely meet him coming back--the Deanery is the big house in the far corner yonder.”  The stranger followed Bryce's outstretched finger.  “Paradise?” he said, wonderingly. “What's that?”  Bryce pointed to a long stretch of grey wall which projected from the south wall of the Cathedral into the Close.  “It's an enclosure--between the south porch and the transept,” he said. “Full of old tombs and trees--a sort of wilderness--why called Paradise I don't know. There's a short cut across it to the Deanery and that part of the Close--through that archway you see over there. If you go across, you're almost sure to meet Dr. Ransford.”  “I'm much obliged to you,” said the stranger. “Thank you.”  He turned away in the direction which Bryce had indicated, and Bryce went back--only to go out again and call after him.  “If you don't meet him, shall I say you'll call again?” he asked. “And--what name?”  The stranger shook his head.  “It's immaterial,” he answered. “I'll see him--somewhere--or later. Many thanks.”  He went on his way towards Paradise, and Bryce returned to the surgery and completed his preparations for departure. And in the course of things, he more than once looked through the window into the garden and saw Mary Bewery still walking and talking with young Sackville Bonham.  “No,” he muttered to himself. “I won't trouble to exchange any farewells--not because of Ransford's hint, but because there's no need. If Ransford thinks he's going to drive me out of Wrychester before I choose to go he's badly mistaken--it'll be time enough to say farewell when I take my departure--and that won't be just yet. Now I wonder who that old chap was? Knew some one of Ransford's name once, did he? Probably Ransford himself--in which case he knows more of Ransford than anybody in Wrychester knows--for nobody in Wrychester knows anything beyond a few years back. No, Dr. Ransford!--no farewells--to anybody! A mere departure--till I turn up again.”  But Bryce was not to get away from the old house without something in the nature of a farewell. As he walked out of the surgery by the side entrance, Mary Bewery, who had just parted from young Bonham in the garden and was about to visit her dogs in the stable yard, came along: she and Bryce met, face to face. The girl flushed, not so much from embarrassment as from vexation; Bryce, cool as ever, showed no sign of any embarrassment. Instead, he laughed, tapping the hand-bag which he carried under one arm.  “Summarily turned out--as if I had been stealing the spoons,” he remarked. “I go--with my small belongings. This is my first reward--for devotion.”  “I have nothing to say to you,” answered Mary, sweeping by him with a highly displeased glance. “Except that you have brought it on yourself.”  “A very feminine retort!” observed Bryce. “But--there is no malice in it? Your anger won't last more than--shall we say a day?”  “You may say what you like,” she replied. “As I just said, I have nothing to say--now or at any time.”  “That remains to be proved,” remarked Bryce. “The phrase is one of much elasticity. But for the present--I go!”  He walked out into the Close, and without as much as a backward look struck off across the sward in the direction in which, ten minutes before, he had sent the strange man. He had rooms in a quiet lane on the farther side of the Cathedral precinct, and his present intention was to go to them to leave his bag and make some further arrangements. He had no idea of leaving Wrychester--he knew of another doctor in the city who was badly in need of help: he would go to him--would tell him, if need be, why he had left Ransford. He had a multiplicity of schemes and ideas in his head, and he began to consider some of them as he stepped out of the Close into the ancient enclosure which all Wrychester folk knew by its time-honoured name of Paradise. This was really an outer court of the old cloisters; its high walls, half-ruinous, almost wholly covered with ivy, shut in an expanse of turf, liberally furnished with yew and cypress and studded with tombs and gravestones. In one corner rose a gigantic elm; in another a broken stairway of stone led to a doorway set high in the walls of the nave; across the enclosure itself was a pathway which led towards the houses in the south-east corner of the Close. It was a curious, gloomy spot, little frequented save by people who went across it rather than follow the gravelled paths outside, and it was untenanted when Bryce stepped into it. But just as he walked through the archway he saw Ransford. Ransford was emerging hastily from a postern door in the west porch--so hastily that Bryce checked himself to look at him. And though they were twenty yards apart, Bryce saw that Ransford's face was very pale, almost to whiteness, and that he was unmistakably agitated. Instantly he connected that agitation with the man who had come to the surgery door.  “They've met!” mused Bryce, and stopped, staring after Ransford's retreating figure. “Now what is it in that man's mere presence that's upset Ransford? He looks like a man who's had a nasty, unexpected shock--a bad 'un!”  He remained standing in the archway, gazing after the retreating figure, until Ransford had disappeared within his own garden; still wondering and speculating, but not about his own affairs, he turned across Paradise at last and made his way towards the"]]]
