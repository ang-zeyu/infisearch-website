He feels so strongly.\"  \"He feels no stronger than I do,\" replied the Judge.  \"You have gotten used to me in eighteen years, and besides,\" she flashed, \"you never spent all the money you had in the world for a principle.\"  Mr. Whipple smiled as she went out of the door.  \"I have spent pretty near all,\" he said. But more to himself than to the Colonel.  That evening, some young people came in to tea, two of the four big Catherwood boys, Anne Brinsmade and her brother Jack, Puss Russell and Bert, and Eugenie Renault. But Virginia lost her temper. In an evil moment Puss Russell started the subject of the young Yankee who had deprived her of Hester. Puss was ably seconded by Jack Brinsmade, whose reputation as a tormentor extended far back into his boyhood. In vain; did Anne, the peacemaker, try to quench him, while the big Catherwoods and Bert Russell laughed incessantly. No wonder that Virginia was angry. She would not speak to Puss as that young lady bade her good night. And the Colonel, coming home from an evening with Mr, Brinsmade, found his daughter in an armchair, staring into the sitting-room fire. There was no other light in the room Her chin was in her hand, and her lips were pursed.  \"Heigho!\" said the Colonel, \"what's the trouble now?\"  \"Nothing,\" said Virginia.  \"Come,\" he insisted, \"what have they been doing to my girl?\"  \"Pa!\"  \"Yes, honey.\"  \"I don't want to go to balls all my life. I want to go to boarding-school, and learn something. Emily is going to Monticello after Christmas. Pa, will you let me?\"  Mr. Carvel winced. He put an arm around her. He, thought of his lonely widowerhood, of her whose place Virginia had taken.  \"And what shall I do?\" he said, trying to smile.  \"It will only be for a little while. And Monticello isn't very far, Pa.\"  \"Well, well, there is plenty of time to think it over between now and January,\" he said. \"And now I have a little favor to ask of you, honey.\"  \"Yes?\" she said.  The Colonel took the other armchair, stretched his feet toward the blaze, and stroked his goatee. He glanced covertly at his daughter's profile. Twice he cleared hip throat.  \"Jinny?\"  \"Yes, Pa\" (without turning her head).  \"Jinny, I was going to speak of this young. Brice. He's a stranger here, and he comes of a good family, and--and I like him.\"  \"And you wish me to invite him to my party,\" finished Virginia.  The Colonel started. \"I reckon you guessed it,\" he said.  Virginia remained immovable. She did not answer at once. Then she said:  \"Do you think, in bidding against me, that he behaved, like a gentleman?\"  The Colonel blundered.  \"Lord, Virginia,\" he said, \"I thought you told the judge this afternoon teat it was done out of principle.\"  Virginia ignored this. But she bit her lip  \"He is like all Yankees, without one bit of consideration for a woman. He knew I wanted Hester.\"  \"What makes you imagine that he thought of you at all, my dear?\" asked her father, mildly, \"He does not know you.\"  This time the Colonel scored certainly. The firelight saved Virginia.  \"He overheard our conversation,\" she answered.  \"I reckon that he wasn't worrying much about us. And besides, he was trying to save Hester from Jennings.\"  \"I thought that you said that it was to be my party, Pa,\" said Virginia, irrelevantly.  The Colonel looked thoughtful, then he began to laugh.  \"Haven't we enough Black Republican friends?\" she asked.  \"So you won't have him?\" said the Colonel.  \"I didn't say that I wouldn't have him,\" she answered.  The Colonel rose, and brushed the ashes from his goat.  \"By Gum!\" he said. \"Women beat me.\"     CHAPTER X  THE LITTLE HOUSE  When Stephen attempted to thank Judge Whipple for going on Hester's bond, he merely said, \"Tut, tut.\"  The Judge rose at six, so his man Shadrach told Stephen. He had his breakfast at the Planters' House at seven, read the Missouri Democrat, and returned by eight. Sometimes he would say good morning to Stephen and Richter, and sometimes he would not. Mr. Whipple was out a great part of the day, and he had many visitors. He was a very busy man. Like a great specialist (which he was), he would see only one person at a time. And Stephen soon discovered that his employer did not discriminate between age or sex, or importance, or condition of servitude. In short, Stephen's opinion of Judge Whipple altered very materially before the end of that first week. He saw poor women and disconsolate men go into the private room ahead of rich citizens, who seemed content to wait their turn on the hard wooden chairs against the wall of the main office. There was one incident in particular, when a well-dressed gentleman of middle age paced impatiently for two mortal hours after Shadrach had taken his card into the sanctum. When at last he had been admitted, Mr. Richter whispered to Stephen his name. It was that of a big railroad man from the East. The transom let out the true state of affairs.  \"See here, Callender,\" the Judge was heard to say, \"you fellows don't like me, and you wouldn't come here unless you had to. But when your road gets in a tight place, you turn up and expect to walk in ahead of my friends. No, sir, if you want to see me, you've got to wait.\"  Mr. Callender made some inaudible reply, \"Money!\" roared the Judge, \"take your money to Stetson, and see if you win your case.\"  Mr. Richter smiled at Stephen, as if in sheer happiness at this vindication of an employer who had never seemed to him to need a defence.  Stephen was greatly drawn toward this young German with the great scar on his pleasant face. And he was itching to know about that scar. Every day, after coming in from dinner, Richter lighted a great brown meerschaum, and read the St. Louis 'Anzeiger' and the 'Westliche Post'. Often he sang quietly to himself:            \"Deutschlands Sohne           Laut ertone           Euer Vaterlandgesang.           Vaterland! Du Land des Ruhmes,           Weih' zu deines Heiligthumes           Hutern, uns and unser Schwert.\"  There were other songs, too. And some wonderful quality in the German's voice gave you a thrill when you heard them, albeit you could not understand the words. Richter never guessed how Stephen, with his eyes on his book, used to drink in those airs. And presently he found out that they were inspired.  The day that the railroad man called, and after he and the Judge had gone out together, the ice was broken.  \"You Americans from the North are a queer people, Mr. Brice,\" remarked Mr. Richter, as he put on his coat. \"You do not show your feelings. You are ashamed. The Judge, at first I could not comprehend him--he would scold and scold. But one day I see that his heart is warm, and since then I love him. Have you ever eaten a German dinner, Mr. Brice? No? Then you must come with me, now.\"  It was raining, the streets ankle-deep in mud, and the beer-garden by the side of the restaurant to which they went was dreary and bedraggled. But inside the place was warm and cheerful. Inside, to all intents and purposes, it was Germany. A most genial host crossed the room to give Mr. Richter a welcome that any man might have envied. He was introduced to Stephen.  \"We were all 'Streber' together, in Germany,\" said Richter.  \"You were all what?\" asked Stephen, interested.  \"Strivers, you might call it in English. In the Vaterland those who seek for higher and better things--for liberty, and to be rid of oppression --are so called. That is why we fought in '48 and lost. And that is why we came here, to the Republic. Ach! I fear I will never be the great lawyer --but the striver, yes, always. We must fight once more to be rid of the black monster that sucks the blood of freedom--vampire. Is it not so in English?\"  Stephen was astonished at this outburst.  \"You think it will come to war?\"  \"I fear,--yes, I fear,\" said the German, shaking his head. \"We fear. We are already preparing.\"  \"Preparing? You would fight, Richter? You, a foreigner?\"  \"A foreigner!\" cried Richter, with a flash of anger in his blue eyes that died as suddenly as it came,--died into reproach. \"Call me not a foreigner--we Germans will show whether or not we are foreigners when the time is ripe. This great country belongs to all the oppressed. Your ancestors founded it, and fought for it, that the descendants of mine might find a haven from tyranny. My friend, one-half of this city is German, and it is they who will save it if danger arises. You must come with me one night to South St. Louis, that you may know us. Then you will perhaps understand, Stephen. You will not think of us as foreign swill, but as patriots who love our new Vaterland even as you love it. You must come to our Turner Halls, where we are drilling against the time when the Union shall have need of us.\"  \"You are drilling now?\" exclaimed Stephen, in still greater astonishment. The German's eloquence had made him tingle, even as had the songs.  \"Prosit deine Blume!\" answered Richter, smiling and holding up his glass of beer. \"You will come to a 'commerce', and see.  \"This is not our blessed Lichtenhainer, that we drink at Jena. One may have a pint of Lichtenhainer for less than a groschen at Jena. Aber,\" he added as he rose, with a laugh that showed his strong teeth, \"we Americans are rich.\"  As Stephen's admiration for his employer grew, his fear of him waxed greater likewise. The Judge's methods of teaching law were certainly not Harvard's methods. For a fortnight he paid as little attention to the young man as he did to the messengers who came with notes and cooled their heels in the outer office until it became the Judge's pleasure to answer them. This was a trifle discouraging to Stephen. But he stuck to his Chitty and his Greenleaf and his Kent. It was Richter who advised him to buy Whittlesey's \"Missouri Form Book,\" and warned him of Mr."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5389"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 02 (#4)"],["body","e's hatred for the new code. Well that he did! There came a fearful hour of judgment. With the swiftness of a hawk Mr. Whipple descended out of a clear sky, and instantly the law terms began to rattle in Stephen's head like dried peas in a can. It was the Old Style of Pleading this time, without a knowledge of which the Judge declared with vehemence that a lawyer was not fit to put pen to legal cap.  \"Now, sir, the pleadings?\" he cried.  \"First,\" said Stephen, \"was the Declaration. The answer to that was the Plea. The answer to that was the Replication. Then came the Rejoinder, then the Surrejoinder, then the Rebutter, then the Surrebutter. But they rarely got that far,\" he added unwisely.  \"A good principle in Law, sir,\" said the Judge, \"is not to volunteer information.\"  Stephen was somewhat cast down when he reached home that Saturday evening. He had come out of his examination with feathers drooping. He had been given no more briefs to copy, nor had Mr. Whipple vouchsafed even to send him on an errand. He had not learned how common a thing it is with young lawyers to feel that they are of no use in the world. Besides, the rain continued. This was the fifth day.  His mother, knitting before the fire in her own room, greeted him with her usual quiet smile of welcome. He tried to give her a humorous account of his catechism of the morning, but failed.  \"I am quite sure that he doesn't like me,\" said Stephen.  His mother continued to smile.  \"If he did, he would not show it,\" she answered.  \"I can feel it,\" said Stephen, dejectedly.  \"The Judge was here this afternoon,\" said his mother.  \"What?\" cried Stephen. \"Again this week? They say that he never calls in the daytime, and rarely in the evening. What did he say?\"  \"He said that some of this Boston nonsense must be gotten out of you,\" answered Mrs. Brice, laughing. \"He said that you were too stiff. That you needed to rub against the plain men who were building up the West. Who were making a vast world-power of the original little confederation of thirteen states. And Stephen,\" she added more earnestly, \"I am not sure but what he is right.\"  Then Stephen laughed. And for a long time he sat staring into the fire.  \"What else did he say?\" he asked, after a while.  \"He told me about a little house which we might rent very cheaply. Too cheaply, it seems. The house is on this street, next door to Mr. Brinsmade, to whom it belongs. And Mr. Whipple brought the key, that we might inspect it to-morrow.\"  \"But a servant,\" objected Stephen, \"I suppose that we must have a servant.\"  His mother's voice fell.  \"That poor girl whom you freed is here to see me every day. Old Nancy does washing. But Hester has no work and she is a burden to Judge Whipple. Oh, no,\" she continued, in response to Stephen's glance, \"the Judge did not mention that, but I think he had it in mind that Nester might come. And I am sure that she would.\"  Sunday dawned brightly. After church Mrs. Brice and Stephen walked down Olive Street, and stood looking at a tiny house wedged in between, two large ones with scrolled fronts. Sad memories of Beacon Street filled them both as they gazed, but they said nothing of this to each other. As Stephen put his hand on the latch of the little iron gate, a gentleman came out of the larger house next door. He was past the middle age, somewhat scrupulously dressed in the old fashion, in swallowtail coat and black stock. Benevolence was in the generous mouth, in the large nose that looked like Washington's, and benevolence fairly sparkled in the blue eyes. He smiled at them as though he had known them always, and the world seemed brighter that very instant. They smiled in return, whereupon the gentleman lifted his hat. And the kindliness and the courtliness of that bow made them very happy. \"Did you wish to look at the house, madam?\" he asked \"Yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Brice.  \"Allow me to open it for you,\" he said, graciously taking the key from her. \"I fear that you will find it inconvenient and incommodious, ma'am. I should be fortunate, indeed, to get a good tenant.\"  He fitted the key in the door, while Stephen and his mother smiled at each other at the thought of the rent. The gentleman opened the door, and stood aside to let them enter, very much as if he were showing them a palace for which he was the humble agent.  They went into the little parlor, which was nicely furnished in mahogany and horsehair. And it had back of it a bit of a dining room, with a little porch overlooking the back yard. Mrs. Brice thought of the dark and stately high-ceiled dining-room she had known throughout her married days: of the board from which a royal governor of Massachusetts Colony had eaten, and some governors of the Commonwealth since. Thank God, she had not to sell that, nor the Brice silver which had stood on the high sideboard with the wolves and the shield upon it. The widow's eyes filled with tears. She had not hoped again to have a home for these things, nor the father's armchair, nor the few family treasures that were to come over the mountains.  The gentleman, with infinite tact, said little, but led the way through the rooms. There were not many of them. At the door of the kitchen he stopped, and laid his hand kindly on Stephen's shoulder:-- \"Here we may not enter. This is your department, ma'am,\" said he.  Finally, as they stood without waiting for the gentleman, who insisted upon locking the door, they observed a girl in a ragged shawl hurrying up the street. As she approached them, her eyes were fixed upon the large house next door. But suddenly, as the gentleman turned, she caught sight of him, and from her lips escaped a cry of relief. She flung open the gate, and stood before him.  \"Oh, Mr. Brinsmade,\" she cried, \"mother is dying. You have done so much for us, sir,--couldn't you come to her for a little while? She thought if she might see you once more, she would die happy.\" The voice was choked by a sob.  Mr. Brinsmade took the girl's hand in his own, and turned to the lady with as little haste, with as much politeness, as he had shown before.  \"You will excuse me, ma'am,\" he said, with his hat in his hand.  The widow had no words to answer him. But she and her son watched him as he walked rapidly down the street, his arm in the girl's, until they were out of sight. And then they walked home silently.  Might not the price of this little house be likewise a piece of the Brinsmade charity?     CHAPTER XI  THE INVITATION  Mr. Eliphalet Hopper, in his Sunday-best broadcloth was a marvel of propriety. It seemed to Stephen that his face wore a graver expression on Sunday when he met him standing on Miss Crane's doorstep, picking the lint from his coat. Stephen's intention was not to speak. But he remembered what the Judge had said to his mother, and nodded. Why, indeed, should he put on airs with this man who had come to St. Louis unknown and unrecommended and poor, who by sheer industry had made himself of importance in the large business of Carvel &, Company? As for Stephen Brice, he was not yet earning his salt, but existing by the charity of Judge Silas Whipple.  \"Howdy, Mr. Brice,\" said Mr. Hopper, his glance caught by the indefinable in Stephen's costume. This would have puzzled Mr. Hopper's tailor more.  \"Very well, thanks.\"  \"A fine day after the rain.\"  Stephen nodded, and Mr. Hopper entered the hours after him.  \"Be you asked to Virginia Carvel's party?\" he asked abruptly.  \"I do not know Miss Carvel,\" said Stephen, wondering how well the other did. And if the truth be told, he was a little annoyed at Mr. Hopper's free use of her name.  \"That shouldn't make no difference,\" said Eliphalet with just a shade of bitterness in his tone. \"They keep open house, like all Southerners,\" Mr. Hopper hesitated,--\"for such as come well recommended. I 'most forgot,\" said he. \"I callate you're not any too well recommended. I 'most forgot that little transaction down to the Court House. They do say that she wanted that gal almighty bad,--she was most awful cut up not to get her. Served her right, though. I'm glad you did. Show her she can't have everything her own way. And say,\" he added, with laughter, \"how you did fix that there stuckup Colfax boy! He'll never forgive you no more than she. But,\" said Mr. Hopper, meditatively, \"it was a durned-fool trick.\"  I think Stephen's critics will admit that he had a good right to be angry, and that they will admire him just a little bit because he kept his temper. But Mr. Hopper evidently thought he had gone too far.  \"She ain't got no use for me, neither,\" he said.  \"She shows poor judgment,\" answered Stephen.  \"She's not long sighted, that's sure,\" replied Eliphalet, with emphasis.  At dinner Stephen was tried still further. And it was then he made the determination to write for the newspapers in order to pay the rent on Mr. Brinsmade's house. Miss Carvel's coming-out party was the chief topic.  \"They do say the Colonel is to spend a sight of money on that ball,\" said Mrs. Abner Reed. \"I guess it won't bankrupt him.\" And she looked hard at Mr. Hopper.  \"I callate he ain't pushed for money,\" that gentleman vouchsafed.  \"He's a good man, and done well by you, Mr. Hopper.\"  \"So--so,\" answered Eliphalet. \"But I will say that I done something for the Colonel. I've saved him a hundred times my pay since I showed old Hood the leaks. And I got a thousand dollar order from Wright & Company this week for him.\"  \"I dare say you'd keep a tight hand enough on expenses,\" said Miss Crane, half in sarcasm, half in approval.  \"If Colonel Carvel was doin' business in New England,\" said Eliphalet, \"he'd been bankrupt long ago.\"  \"That young Clarence Colfax,\" Mrs. Abner Reed broke in, \"he'll get a right smart mint o' money when he marries Virginia. They do say her mother left her independent. How now, Mr. Hopper?\"  Eliphalet looked mysterious and knowing. He did not reply.  \"And young Colfax ain't precisely a pauper,\" said Miss Crane.  \"I'll risk a"]]]
