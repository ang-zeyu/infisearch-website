But if you were to leave the blood in the pail for a few hours or for a day, you would find, instead of the large jelly quite filling the pail, a smaller but firmer jelly covered by or floating in a colourless or very pale yellow liquid. This smaller, firmer jelly, which in the course of a day or so would get still firmer and smaller, would in fact go on shrinking in size, you may still call the =clot=; the clear fluid in which it is floating is called =serum=.  What has taken place is as follows. Soon after blood is shed there is formed in it a something which was not present in it before. This something, which we call =fibrin=, starts as a multitude of fine tender threads which run in all directions through the mass of blood, forming a close network everywhere. So the blood is shut up in an immense number of little chambers formed by the meshes of the fibrin; and it is this which makes it seem a jelly. But each thread of fibrin as soon as it is formed begins to shrink, and the blood in each of these little chambers is squeezed by the shrinking of its walls of fibrin, and tries to make its way out. The corpuscles get caught in the meshes, but all the rest of the blood passes between the threads and comes out on the top and sides of the pail. And this goes on until you have left in the clot very little besides corpuscles entangled in a network of fibrin, and all the rest of the blood has been squeezed outside the clot, and is then called serum. =Serum, then, is blood out of which the corpuscles have been strained by the process of clotting.=  Now I dare say you are ready to ask the question, If blood clots so readily when it is shed, why does it not clot inside the body? Why is our blood ever fluid? This is rather a difficult question to answer. When blood is shed from the warm body it soon gets cool. But it does not clot and become solid because it gets cool, as ordinary jelly does. If you keep it from getting cool it clots all the same, in fact quicker, and if kept cold enough will not clot at all. Nor does it clot when shed, because it has become still, and is no longer rushing round through the blood-vessels. Nor is it because it is exposed to the air. Perhaps we don’t know exactly why it is, and you will have much to learn hereafter about the coagulation of blood. All I will say at present is that as long as the blood is in the body there is something at work to keep it from clotting. It does clot sometimes in the body, and blood-vessels get plugged with the clots; but that constitutes a very dangerous disease.  =24.= Well, blood is thicker than water because it contains solid corpuscles and fibrin. But even the serum, _i.e._ blood out of which both fibrin and corpuscles have been taken, is thicker than water.  You know that if you were to take a basinful of pure water and boil it, it would boil away to nothing. It would all go off in steam. But if you were to try to boil a basinful of serum, you would find several curious things happen.  In the first place you would not be able to boil it at all. Before you got it as hot as boiling water, your serum, which before seemed quite as liquid as water, only feeling a little sticky if you put your finger in it, would all become quite solid. You know the difference between a raw and a boiled egg. The white of the raw egg, though very sticky and ropy, or viscid as it is called, is still liquid; you will find it hard work if you try to cut it with a knife. The white of the hard boiled egg, on the other hand, is quite solid, and you can cut it into ever so thin slices. It has been “set” by boiling. Well, the serum of blood is in this respect very like white of egg. In fact they both contain the same substance, called =albumin=, which has this property of “setting” or becoming solid when heated nearly to boiling-point. Both the serum of blood and white of egg even when “set” are wet, _i.e._ contain a great deal of water. You may dry them in the proper manner into a transparent horny substance. When quite dry they will readily burn. They are therefore things which can be oxidized. When burnt they give off carbonic acid, water, and ammonia; the latter you might easily recognize by its effect on your nose if you were to burn a piece of dried blood in a flame. Now, when I say that =albumin= in burning gives off carbonic acid, water, and ammonia, you know from your Chemistry that it must contain carbon to form the carbonic acid, hydrogen to form water, and nitrogen to form ammonia. It need not contain oxygen, for as you know it could get all the oxygen it wanted from the air; still it does contain some oxygen. =Albumin, then, is an oxidizable or combustible body made up of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.= It is important you should remember this; but I will not bother you with how much of each--it is a very complex substance, built up in a wonderful way, far more complex than any of the things you had to learn about in your Chemistry Primer. And this albumin, dissolved in a great deal of water, forms the serum of blood.  I did not say anything about what fibrin was made of; but it, like albumin, is made up of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. It is not quite the same thing as albumin, but first cousin to it. There is another first cousin to both of them, also containing nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, which together with a great deal of water forms muscle; another forms a great part of the red corpuscles; and scattered all over the body in various places, there are first cousins to albumin, all containing nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, all combustible, and all when burnt giving off carbonic acid, water, and ammonia. All these first cousins go under one name; they are all called =proteids=.  =25.= Well, then, blood is thicker than water by reason of the proteids in the corpuscles, in the fibrin, and in the serum, but there is something else besides. I will not trouble you with the crowd of things of which there are perhaps just a few grains in a gallon of blood, like the little pinches of things a cook puts into a savoury dish; though, as you go on in your studies, you will find that these, like many other little things in the world, are of great importance.  But I will ask you to remember this. If you take some dried blood and burn it, though you may burn all the proteids (and some other of the trifles I spoke of just now) away, you will not be able to burn the whole blood away. Burn as long as you like, you will always have left a quantity of what you have learnt from your Chemistry to call =ash, and if you were to examine this ash you would find it contained ever so many elements; sulphur, phosphorus, chlorine, potassium, sodium, calcium, and iron, being the most abundant and most important=.  Blood, then, is a very wonderful fluid: wonderful for being made up of coloured corpuscles and colourless fluid, wonderful for its fibrin and power of clotting, wonderful for the many substances, for the proteids, for the ashes or minerals, for the rest of the things which are locked up in the corpuscles and in the serum.  But you will not wonder at it when you come to see that the blood is the great circulating market of the body, in which all the things that are wanted by all parts, by the muscles, by the brain, by the skin, by the lungs, liver, and kidney, are bought and sold. What the muscle wants, it, as we have seen, buys from the blood; what it has done with it sells back to the blood; and so with every other organ and part. As long as life lasts this buying and selling is for ever going on, and this is why the blood is for ever on the move, sweeping restlessly from place to place, bringing to each part the things it wants, and carrying away those with which it has done. When the blood ceases to move, the market is blocked, the buying and selling cease, and all the organs die, starved for the lack of the things which they want, choked by the abundance of things for which they have no longer any need.  We have now to learn how the blood is thus kept continually on the move.     HOW THE BLOOD MOVES. § V.   =26.= You have already learnt to recognize the blood-vessels of the rabbit, and to distinguish two kinds of blood-vessels--the arteries, which in a dead animal generally contain little or no blood, and have rather firm stout walls; and the veins, which are generally full of blood, and have thinner and flabby walls. The arteries when you cut them generally gape and remain open; the veins fall together and collapse. The larger the arteries, the stouter and firmer they are, and the greater the difference between them and the veins.  You have also studied the capillaries in the frog’s foot; you have seen that they are minute channels, with the thinnest and tenderest walls, forming a close network in which the smallest arteries end, and from which the smallest veins begin.  You have moreover been told that all over your own body, in every part, there are, though you cannot see them, networks of capillaries like those in the frog’s foot which you can see; that all the arteries of your body end in capillaries, and all the veins begin in capillaries. Let me repeat that, one or two structures excepted, there is no part of your body in which, could you put it under a microscope, you would not see a small artery branching out and losing itself in a network of capillaries, out of which, as out of so many roots, a small vein gathers itself together again.  In some places the network is very close, the capillaries lying closer together than even in the frog’s foot; in others the network is more open, and the capillaries wider apart; but everywhere, with a few exceptions which you will learn by and by, there are capillaries, arteries, and veins.  Suppose you were a little lone red corpuscle, all by yourself in the quite empty blood-vessels of a dead body, squeezed in the narrow pathway of a capillary, say of the biceps muscle of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],["title","Kate Vernon: A Tale.

It would give a very false idea of Kate Vernon's character, were we to say that Captain Egerton's departure did not leave a blank in the quiet routine of her life. Indeed, she was rather surprised to find how closely he had linked himself with the pleasures and occupations of the secluded little circle amongst whom accident had thrown him. She missed his ready companionship, and the amusing contrariety of his opinions and prejudices; she missed the interested attention with which he listened to every word that fell from her lips, and her eye, peculiarly alive to beauty in every form, missed his distinguished, soldierly figure, and bold, frank, open face. But her regrets did not even border on the sentimental, and were spoken as openly as her grandfather's, who every hour in the day, for a week, at least, after his departure, might be heard to say--\"If Fred Egerton was here, he would do this, or that, for me.\" In short, Kate had never dreamt of Egerton as a lover. Marriage was to her a distant possibility--desirable, certainly, in due time, as she always considered it, if happy, the happiest state of life; but marriage with a soldier, who could not be always near her grandfather, was something so utterly beyond the powers of her imagination to conceive, that it gave her all the ease and security she might have felt with a brother.  So the winter wore steadily away. The morning's study--the afternoon walk with her grandfather--often to visit the sick and needy--the interchange of contrasting thought with Winter and the organist, kept Miss Vernon too wholesomely active both in mind and body to permit the pleasant monotony of her life to degenerate into stagnation.  But the half-hour in the evening, while her grandfather dosed, was the happiest portion of the day to her; when she leaned back in her chair gazing at the fire-light as it danced upon the wall and cast uncouth shadows, and, following some train of thought suggested by the reading, or occurrences of the day, dreamed of the future, or conjured up the past! And often did she feel surprise, at the frequent recurrence of the ball at Carrington--of Egerton's farewell--among these visions--though, at this point, she ever turned resolutely away.  Then Colonel Vernon was laid up for a month with a feverish cold, which made Kate rather anxious, and banished every thought not connected with the invalid.  So-came on the lengthening days' warmer sun, and more piercing winds of early spring; and one morning, towards the end of March, Mrs. O'Toole laid two letters before the Colonel; one directed to him in a clear, bold hand, bearing the Marseilles' post-mark, the other to Kate.  \"I really think this is from Fred Egerton,\" said the Colonel, feeling in every pocket for glasses. \"Kate, my dear! they were hanging round my neck before breakfast?\"  \"Oh! here they are, dear grandpapa,\" exclaimed she, eagerly; \"do not mind looking at the outside--open it.\"  And she laid aside her own.  With many a break, and many a tantalising pause, the Colonel slowly doled forth Egerton's letter, it was short, and contained little more than a report of his safe arrival, after a tedious journey, many expressions of sincere regard, and kind enquiries for his friends at A----, but breathed an indefinable tone of despondency, and restlessness of spirit, unlike anything they had hitherto observed in him.  The Colonel, at length, concluded, in a sort of surprised accent, as though he expected something more; and Kate exclaimed--  \"Is that all? Do you know, grandpapa, I expected much greater things from Captain Egerton's first letter from India. Do you not think he writes dejectedly.\"  \"I cannot quite make him out,\" he replied, in an absent manner; \"but I am obliged to him for his kind remembrance of us. We must tell Winter and Gilpin--he was such a favorite with them. Now open your despatch, my dear. I see it is from Georgina.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Dearest Kate,\" began Miss Vernon, in obedience to his commands, \"your last letter is now so ancient, I am ashamed to mention it--your first I did not answer because I was too much vexed at your absurd opposition to all my plans for your benefit. Time has cooled my resentment, and accident has revived my affection for my pretty, loveable god-child, while it has, I hope, awakened in your mind proper regret for the folly of preferring a life of seclusion in a dull country town to the brilliant lot you might have secured. I forgive you, as I am sure you have punished yourself enough. The immediate cause of this letter is as follows. Mrs. Wentworth, one of my closest allies at Naples, told me, a brother of hers met a most exquisite personage, called Colonel Vernon, and an equally exquisite Miss Vernon at A----, I recognised the description, and immediately a vision of my happy girlish days at Dungar, and of all I owed to my kind and venerated cousin, rose before my mind; and deep was the self-reproach, with which I thought of my long unpardonable neglect! It is the life of unchecked prosperity I lead, that makes me thus thoughtless, thus inferior to you, my bright-eyed recluse, in whose name I once promised and vowed the three things you have practised. I am what I am, and will feign nothing. I acknowledge, that tardy as this letter is, I doubt if I should have penned it, had not certain fleeting catspaws ruffled the smooth surface of my life, and showed me how slight are the bands that hold back the \"dogs of war,\" doubt, emptiness, and dissatisfaction! I fear I am selfish, but nothing will do my heart so much good as the sight of your calm, sweet face, and the sound of your noble-hearted grandfather's well-remembered voice--forgive me, I know how guilty I am, I feel I am most unworthy--yet, forgive me, and come; leave the seclusion nature never intended for either. D'Arcy Vernon never refused me a request in those old times when I was all but a dependent on his bounty--I trust he will not now prevent me from employing some of the filthy lucre fortune has thrown in my way, in administering to my own enjoyment, by accelerating your journey here. I have written so much longer than usual, I can add nothing of the charms intrinsic or extrinsic of fair Florence, to me it will be nothing if you refuse to come.                                                \"Yours as warmly as ever,                                                             \"G. DESMOND.  \"P.S.--Moore writes me word there has been a great search for some papers relating to the Knockdrum farm, I do not exactly understand what they want them for; some lawsuit that a Mr. Taaffe is engaged in, but you had better tell your grandfather.\"  \"What a charming letter!\" cried Kate, as she concluded. \"Is it not delightful, to read such a candid, warm-hearted acknowledgement of error? I am so glad to have heard from her at last. It is so dreadful to feel that any chilling cloud of doubt intervenes between you and one you love!\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said the Colonel; \"what a rash impulsive creature Georgy has ever been! rushing into injustice one moment, and atoning for it with such graceful self-abasement the next; it would be better if she could steer clear of both extremes; but let me look at that postscript again; she is as distinct as ladies usually are on legal subjects.\"  Kate handed him the letter, and he continued to read and re-read the postscript for some minutes, with a look of concentrated attention, then, raising his eyes and speaking more to himself than to his grand-daughter--  \"I am astonished, that Moore has not written to me on this matter,\" he said, in a displeased tone. \"If this Taaffe, be the nephew of old Arthur Taaffe, and the papers required, those connected with that judgment;\" he stopped abruptly, and sat for a few moments in deep thought, looking very grave. Kate also kept a respectful silence, feeling little interest in any legal matter, till her grandfather rousing himself, and with his old contented look returning, observed, \"no, no! no man could act such a villanous part, he must be perfectly aware it was paid years ago.\"  \"What was paid, grandpapa?\"  \"That debt to old Taaffe; he advanced my father money on Knockdrum, and got me to join in the bond, on which, of course judgments were entered against us both. I paid it years ago,"]]]
