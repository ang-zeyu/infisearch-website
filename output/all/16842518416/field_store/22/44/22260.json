Scientific, or something in that line, struck me?\"  \"That's all very well, Sir Roland,\" said a lively girl opposite to him. \"You needn't try to back out of your too-evident admiration of the fair Hypatia--we all saw it. Why, you never took your eyes off her from the moment she came into the room, till you put her into the carriage. You forgot your dance with me. You never _once_ asked Jennie Castanette; she used to be your favourite partner. A sudden attack of whatsyname at first sight, don't they call it?\"  \"You ought to know best,\" he replied; \"but Miss Tollemache is certainly handsome, or, rather, distinguished-looking; seems clever too, above the average, though she avoided literary topics.\"  \"Clever!\" retorted his fair opponent. \"I should think she is, though I defy you to do more than guess at it from her talk; she is so unpretending in her manner, and has a horror of showing off. Do you know what she did last year? There wasn't a girl that came near her in the University examinations.\"  \"So much the worse for her chances of happiness or that of the man that marries her--if she is not too 'cultured' to marry at all.\"  \"How do you make that out?\"  \"There are three things that tend to spoil a woman's character in the estimation of all sensible men,\" he answered: \"beauty, money, or pre-eminent intellect. The beauty is flattered into outrageous vanity and frivolity. The heiress is besieged by suitors and toadies whose adulation fosters selfishness and arrogance. The third is perhaps the least evil, as after it is demonstrated that its possessor cannot lay down the law in private life, as she is prone to do, she retains a reserve of resources within herself, and mostly makes a rational use of them. Depend upon it, the post of honour is a 'middle station.'\"  \"Indeed! I am delighted to hear it,\" replied Miss Branksome. \"So we poor mediocrities who have neither poverty nor riches--certainly not the last--and who don't profess beauty, have a fair chance of happiness? I was not quite sure of it before. And now, having unburdened yourself of all this 'philosophy in a country house,' you will dash off in pursuit of Hypatia directly you find out what she is going to do today. What will you give me if I tell you? 'Have you seen my Sylvia pass this way?' and so on.\"  \"Hasn't she gone back to Chesterfield?\" he asked.  \"So it was erroneously supposed. But Lady Roxburgh will tell you when she comes down that she brought off a picnic to the ruins of St. Wereburgh's Abbey; that she has been invited from the Wensleydales, and all the house-party here are going. Unless, of course, you would prefer to stay behind and have a peaceful day in the library?\"  Sir Roland's face betrayed him. No human countenance, after such contending emotions as had almost \"rent his heart in twain,\" could have retained its immobility.  \"There now!\" said Miss Branksome, scornfully. \"'What a piece of work is man!' etc. I have been reading Shakespeare lately--on wet mornings.\"  \"But are you certain as to the programme?\"  \"Clara Roxburgh is my authority. The arrangement was made at an early hour this morning. You are relied on to drive the drag conveying the ladies of this household, including my insignificant self--not without value, I trust, to _some_ people, however we poor ordinary mortals may be overshadowed by 'sweet girl graduates.'\"  \"Then may I venture to ask you, with Lady Roxburgh's permission, to occupy the box seat?\"  \"That's very sweet of you; _faute d'autre_, of course. Her ladyship's nerves won't permit of her taking it herself. And now let me give you a little advice--'honest Injun,' I mean--in all good faith and friendship, though I know you men don't believe in our capacity for that. Don't be too devoted. It's a mistake if you want to be successful; any girl could tell you. We are mostly annoyed if we're run after. There's nothing like indifference; it piques us. Then, if we like a man, we run after _him_--in a quiet ladylike way, of course. Do you follow?\"  \"Oh yes; a thousand thanks. Pray go on.\"  \"I have only one other bit of warning. You're a lot older than me, and I dare say you think you know best, as I'm not long out. But you don't. Some day you'll see it. In the meantime don't give away _all_ your heart before you make sure of a fair return. She may lead you on--unconsciously, of course--which means she wouldn't be rude to you and all the rest of it. But my idea is, she doesn't know what she wants just now. She's the sort of girl that thinks she's got a career before her. She won't be satisfied with the regulation returned affection, matrimony business.\"  \"But surely such a woman has no commonplace thoughts, no vulgar ideals. She is incapable of such paltry bargaining for wealth or position.\"  \"You think so? I don't say she's worse than any other girl who's got such a pull in the way of looks, brains, family, and all the rest of it. But none of us like to go cheap, and the love in a cottage business, or even a man like yourself of good county family, but _not_ rich, _not_ distinguished--h'm--as yet, _not_ a power socially or politically in the land, is scarcely a high bid for a first-class property in the marriage market like Hypatia Tollemache.\"  \"My dear Miss Branksome, don't talk like that. It pains me, I assure you.\"  \"Perhaps it does, but it will do you good in the long run. It's pretty true, as you'll find out in time. And now, as I hear Lady Roxburgh coming downstairs, and I've talked enough nonsense for one morning, I'll go and get ready for the drag party. You'll know soon that I have no personal interest in the matter, though I've liked you always, and don't wish to see your life spoiled by a sentimental mistake.\"  And so this very frank young woman departed, just in time to meet the hostess, who, coming forward, explained her late arrival at the breakfast table by saying that she had to send off messages about the picnic party and an impromptu dance for the evening. She verified Miss Branksome's information respecting the drag, and the responsible office of coachman which Sir Roland expressed himself most willing to accept. But all the time he was suitably attiring himself; and even during a visit of inspection to the stables for the purpose of interviewing the well-matched team, and having a word or two with the head groom, a feeling of doubt would obtrude itself as he recalled the well-meant, unconventional warning of Miss Bessie Branksome.  \"I suppose women know a good deal more about each other's ways than we do,\" he reflected. \"But an average girl like Miss Branksome, good-hearted and well-intentioned, as she no doubt is, can no more enter into the motives of a woman like Miss Tollemache than a milkmaid could gauge the soul of a duchess. In any case, I must take my chance, and I shall have the satisfaction of taking my dismissal from _her_ lips alone, for no other earthly authority will detach me from the pursuit. So that's settled.\"  And when Roland Massinger made use of that expression in soliloquy or otherwise, a certain line of action was definitely followed. Neither obstacles nor dissuasions had the smallest weight with him. In general, he took pains to work out his plans and to form his opinion before committing himself to them. This, however, he admitted, was an exception to his rule of life. Rule of life? It _was_ his life--his soul, mind, body--everything. \"Whatever stirs this mortal frame\"--of course. What did Byron say about love? \"'Tis woman's whole existence.\" Byron didn't know: he had long since squandered the riches of the heart, the boundless wealth of the affections. He could _write_ about love. But the real enthralling, all-absorbing, reverential passion of a true man's honest love, he did not know, never could have known, and was incapable of feeling.  After this burst of blasphemy against the acknowledged high priest of \"Venus Victrix,\" the great singer of \"love, and love's sharp woe,\" Sir Roland felt relieved, if not comforted.  Then came the more mundane business of the day. The girls' chatter, always more or less sweet in his ears, like the half-notes of thrushes in spring; the arranging of pairs, and the small difficulties in mounting to the high seats of the drag; the monosyllabic utterances of the swells, civil and military, who helped to compose the party, at length came to an end.  Finally, when, with pretty, lively, amusing Miss Branksome on the box seat beside him, he started the well-matched team, and, rattling down the avenue, swept through the park gates, and turned into the road which led to St. Wereburgh's, he felt once more in comparative harmony with his surroundings.  \"Now, Sir Roland, you look more like your old self--like the man we used to know. You take my tip, and back your opinion for all you're worth. If it comes off, well and good; if it's a boil-over, pay and look pleasant. If you knew as much about girls as I do, you'd know there _are_ as good fish in the sea, etc., though you men won't believe it. Now, promise me not to do the Knight of the Woeful Countenance any more, won't you?\"  \"As the day is so fine, for a wonder, and the horses are going well together, not to mention the charming company of Miss Branksome on the box seat, who would be perfect if she would drop the didactic business, I think I may promise.\"  So, shaking himself together by a strong effort of will, such as he remembered when acting in private theatricals, he defied care and anxiety, enacting the gay worldling with pronounced success. So much so, that between his prowess as a whip and his cheery returns to the airy badinage usual on such occasions, he ran a close second to a cavalry officer on leave from India for the honourable distinction of \"the life of the party.\"  Pleasant enough indeed was their progress through one of the most picturesque"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53358"],["title","\"War to the Knife;\" or, Tangata Maori (#3)"],["body","in England, but when they stopped within full view of the venerable ivy-clad ruin, of which a marvellous gateway and a noble arch still remained perfect, Sir Roland's gaze did not rest on those time-worn relics of ancient grandeur.  \"She's not here yet,\" said Miss Branksome, with a smile, after the descent from the drag and the regulation amount of handshaking, greeting, and \"How are you?\" and \"How is your dear mother?\" had been got through. \"The Wensleydales have farther to come, and I doubt if their horses are as fast as ours. Oh yes! now I see them--just behind that waggon in the lane, near the bridge. Hypatia is on the box beside young Buckhurst. _He_ can't drive a bit; that's a point in your favour, if you can get her to exchange with me going back. I'll suggest it, anyhow.\"  Sir Roland gave his guide, philosopher, and friend a look of such gratitude that she began to laugh; but, composing her countenance to an expression of the requisite propriety, she advanced to the rival coach, and so timed her movements that he was enabled to help the fair Hypatia to the ground--a slight, but smile-compelling service, which repaid the giver a hundredfold.  Taking a mean advantage of Buckhurst, who was compelled for some reason to overlook the unharnessing of his horses, he thereupon walked away with the entrancing personage towards the assembled party, abandoning Miss Branksome, who discreetly preferred to busy herself in animated conversation with the newcomers.  After this fortunate commencement all went well. Smiling as the morn, pleased (and what woman is not?) with the marked attention of a \"personage,\" Miss Tollemache confessed the exhilaration proper to that pleasantest of informal gatherings--a picnic to a spot of historic interest in an English county, with congenial intimates, and perhaps still more interesting strangers.  Her companion was well up in the provincial records, and thereby in a position of superiority to the rest of the company conversationally.  They had pulled up for lunch in the meadow, deep-swarded and thick with the clovers white and purple, mingled with the tiny fodder plants which nestle around a ruin in green England. The party was full of exclamations.  \"What a darling old church!--thousands of years old it must be,\" said one of the Miss Wensleydales. \"Now, can any one tell me whether it is a Norman or a Saxon one?\"  \"Oh, Norman, surely!\" was the verdict of several feminine voices, all at once.  \"I am not quite certain,\" said Lady Roxburgh; \"I always intended to look it up. What do you say, Miss Tollemache? You know more about these matters than we do.\"  \"Oh, I don't pretend to any knowledge of architecture. A grand old ruin like this is such a thing of beauty that it seems a pity to pick it to pieces. That south door with its round arches looks rather Saxon. What does Sir Roland think? It's not far from Massinger, is it?\"  \"I used to know it well in my boyhood,\" replied that gentleman, who, truth to tell, had been waiting to be referred to. \"Miss Tollemache is right; you will find its history in the Domesday Book. The manor was held by the secular canons of St. Wereburgh till the Conqueror gave it to Hugh Lupus, who granted it to the Benedictine monks.\"  \"And was it an abbey church?\" asked Miss Branksome, who may or may not have divined Sir Roland's special knowledge of church history.  \"Certainly,\" he replied; \"all the authorities are distinct on the point. The manor was held under the abbots by a family of the same name, so it must have belonged to the original Saxon stock.\"  \"And why did they not keep it?\" asked Lady Roxburgh. \"Really, this is most interesting.\"  \"A lady in the case,\" answered Sir Roland. \"Alice de Sotowiche conveyed it away by her marriage with Robert de Maurepas. What the Normans did not get by the sword they seem to have acquired by matrimony. It did not go out of the family, though, till the time of Edward the First. These De Maurepases battled for their manorial rights, too, which included fishing in the Welland, always providing that sturgeon went to the overlord.\"  \"I always knew it was a dear old place,\" said Lady Roxburgh, \"but now it seems doubly interesting. I must get up this history business for future use, and Miss Branksome shall give a little lecture about it next time we have a picnic.\"  \"Thanks awfully, my dear Lady Roxburgh,\" said that young lady, \"but I never could learn anything by heart in my life. I don't mind writing it down, though, from Sir Roland's notes, so that you can have it printed for private circulation at breakfast-time on picnic days.\"  \"I think we might manage a county historical society,\" continued her ladyship. \"It would be a grand idea for house-parties--only now it must be lunch-time. I see they have been unpacking. We must verify these quatrefoils, chevrons, and things afterwards.\"  They lunched under the mouldering walls, picturing a long-past day when, issuing forth from the courtyard of the neighbouring castle, had ridden knight and squire and lady fayre, attended by falconers and woodsmen, with hawk on wrist and hound in leash.  \"What glorious times they must have had of it!\" said Miss Tollemache. \"I should like to have lived then. Life was more direct and sincere than in these artificial days.\"  \"If we could only have seen the people as they really were,\" he replied, \"'in their habit as they lived,' mental or otherwise, it would be such splendid opera business, would it not? But they must have been awfully dull between times. Hardly any books, no cigars till later on; war and the chase their only recreations.\"  \"Noble occupations both,\" said Miss Tollemache, with an air of conviction; \"they left little room for the frivolous indolence of these latter days.\"  \"Perhaps so,\" assented her companion. \"You had either to knock people on the head or undergo the operation yourself. Then, mark the opposite side of the shield. In that very castle--while the gay troop was riding out with pennons flying--the feudal enemy or 'misproud' retainer was probably lying in the dungeon (_they had_ one there, Orme says) after an imprisonment of years.\"  The gathering was a pronounced success. The ruin provided subjects for unlimited conversation as well as occasions for heroic daring in the matter of climbing. The lunch was perfect in its way; the ensuing walks and talks all that could be wished.  And when, after, as one of the young people declared, the \"truly excellent--really delicious day\" came so near to its close that the horses were brought up, Miss Branksome playfully suggested that she and Miss Tollemache should change seats, as she wished to take a lesson from the opposition charioteer in driving, and when, after a moment's playful contest, the fair enslaver was placed on the seat beside him, Sir Roland's cup of happiness was full.    \"Let Fate do her worst;     There are moments of joy,   Bright dreams of the past,     Which she cannot destroy\"--  must have been written by the poet, he felt assured, with that wondrous instinctive insight into the inmost soul of him, and all true lovers, which stamps the heaven-born singer.  Then the drive back to Roxburgh Hall, where they were to reassemble for the impromptu dance! The horses, home-returning, pulled just sufficiently to enable the box passenger to appreciate the strong arm and steady hand of her companion; and when, after an hour, the lamps were lit and the star-spangled night appeared odorous with the scents of early spring, the girl's low voice and musical laugh seemed the appropriate song-speech for which the star-clustered night formed fitting hour and circumstance.  Roland Massinger in that eve of delicious companionship abandoned himself to hope and fantasy. His fair companion had been so far acted upon by her environment, that she had permitted speculative allusions to the recondite problems of the day; to the deeper aims of life--subjects in which she evinced an interest truly exceptional in a girl of such acknowledged social distinction; while he, drawn on by the thought of possible companionship with so rarely-gifted a being, abandoned his usual practical and chiefly negative outlook upon the world, acknowledging the attraction of self-sacrifice and philanthropic crusade. His mental vision appeared to have received an illuminating expansion, and as those low, earnest, but melodious tones made music in his ear, emanating from the fair lips so closely inclined towards his own, he felt almost moved to devote his future energies, means, lands, and life to the amelioration of the race--to the grand aims of that altruistic federation of which, it must be confessed, that he had been a formal, if not indifferent, professor. If only he might persuade this \"one sweet spirit to be his minister\"! Then, how cheerfully would he fare forth through whatever lands or seas she might appoint.  But that fatal _if_!  Why should _he_ be privileged to appropriate this glorious creature, redolent of all the loveliness of earth's primal vigour, and yet informed with the lore of the ages, heightening her attractions a hundred--yes, a thousand-fold? Almost he despaired when thinking of his superlative presumption.  Fortunately for the safety of the passengers, who little knew what tremendous issues were oscillating in the brain of their pilot, he mechanically handled the reins in his usual skilled and efficient fashion. Nor, indeed, did the fair comrade, or she would scarcely have emphasized the conventional remark, \"Oh, Sir Roland, what a delightful drive we have had! I feel so grateful to you!\" as he swung his horses round, and, with practised accuracy, almost grazed the steps at the portico of Roxburgh Hall.     CHAPTER II   Events shaped themselves much after the manner customary since that earliest recorded compromise between soul and sense which mortals throughout all ages have agreed to call Love.
