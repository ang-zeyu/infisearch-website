You'll not catch me going up there again.\"  Fatima did not prove such a nuisance as we had feared.  Huldah Jane liked her, and Ismay, in spite of her declaration that she would have nothing to do with her, looked after her comfort scrupulously.  She even used to get up in the middle of the night and go out to see if Fatima was warm.  Max came in every day and, being around, gave us good advice.  Then one day, about three weeks after Aunt Cynthia's departure, Fatima disappeared--just simply disappeared as if she had been dissolved into thin air.  We left her one afternoon, curled up asleep in her basket by the fire, under Huldah Jane's eye, while we went out to make a call.  When we came home Fatima was gone.  Huldah Jane wept and was as one whom the gods had made mad.  She vowed that she had never let Fatima out of her sight the whole time, save once for three minutes when she ran up to the garret for some summer savory.  When she came back the kitchen door had blown open and Fatima had vanished.  Ismay and I were frantic.  We ran about the garden and through the out-houses, and the woods behind the house, like wild creatures, calling Fatima, but in vain.  Then Ismay sat down on the front doorsteps and cried.  \"She has got out and she'll catch her death of cold and Aunt Cynthia will never forgive us.\"  \"I'm going for Max,\" I declared.  So I did, through the spruce woods and over the field as fast as my feet could carry me, thanking my stars that there was a Max to go to in such a predicament.  Max came over and we had another search, but without result. Days passed, but we did not find Fatima.  I would certainly have gone crazy had it not been for Max.  He was worth his weight in gold during the awful week that followed.  We did not dare advertise, lest Aunt Cynthia should see it; but we inquired far and wide for a white Persian cat with a blue spot on its tail, and offered a reward for it; but nobody had seen it, although people kept coming to the house, night and day, with every kind of a cat in baskets, wanting to know if it was the one we had lost.  \"We shall never see Fatima again,\" I said hopelessly to Max and Ismay one afternoon.  I had just turned away an old woman with a big, yellow tommy which she insisted must be ours--\"cause it kem to our place, mem, a-yowling fearful, mem, and it don't belong to nobody not down Grafton way, mem.\"  \"I'm afraid you won't,\" said Max.  \"She must have perished from exposure long ere this.\"  \"Aunt Cynthia will never forgive us,\" said Ismay, dismally.  \"I had a presentiment of trouble the moment that cat came to this house.\"  We had never heard of this presentiment before, but Ismay is good at having presentiments--after things happen.  \"What shall we do?\" I demanded, helplessly.  \"Max, can't you find some way out of this scrape for us?\"  \"Advertise in the Charlottetown papers for a white Persian cat,\" suggested Max.  \"Some one may have one for sale.  If so, you must buy it, and palm it off on your good Aunt as Fatima.  She's very short-sighted, so it will be quite possible.\"  \"But Fatima has a blue spot on her tail,\" I said.  \"You must advertise for a cat with a blue spot on its tail,\" said Max.  \"It will cost a pretty penny,\" said Ismay dolefully.  \"Fatima was valued at one hundred dollars.\"  \"We must take the money we have been saving for our new furs,\" I said sorrowfully.  \"There is no other way out of it.  It will cost us a good deal more if we lose Aunt Cynthia's favor.  She is quite capable of believing that we have made away with Fatima deliberately and with malice aforethought.\"  So we advertised.  Max went to town and had the notice inserted in the most important daily.  We asked any one who had a white Persian cat, with a blue spot on the tip of its tail, to dispose of, to communicate with M. I., care of the _Enterprise_.  We really did not have much hope that anything would come of it, so we were surprised and delighted over the letter Max brought home from town four days later.  It was a type-written screed from Halifax stating that the writer had for sale a white Persian cat answering to our description.  The price was a hundred and ten dollars, and, if M. I. cared to go to Halifax and inspect the animal, it would be found at 110 Hollis Street, by inquiring for \"Persian.\"  \"Temper your joy, my friends,\" said Ismay, gloomily.  \"The cat may not suit.  The blue spot may be too big or too small or not in the right place.  I consistently refuse to believe that any good thing can come out of this deplorable affair.\"  Just at this moment there was a knock at the door and I hurried out.  The postmaster's boy was there with a telegram.  I tore it open, glanced at it, and dashed back into the room.  \"What is it now?\" cried Ismay, beholding my face.  I held out the telegram.  It was from Aunt Cynthia.  She had wired us to send Fatima to Halifax by express immediately.  For the first time Max did not seem ready to rush into the breach with a suggestion.  It was I who spoke first.  \"Max,\" I said, imploringly, \"you'll see us through this, won't you?  Neither Ismay nor I can rush off to Halifax at once.  You must go to-morrow morning.  Go right to 110 Hollis Street and ask for 'Persian.'  If the cat looks enough like Fatima, buy it and take it to Aunt Cynthia.  If it doesn't--but it must!  You'll go, won't you?\"  \"That depends,\" said Max.  I stared at him.  This was so unlike Max.  \"You are sending me on a nasty errand,\" he said, coolly.  \"How do I know that Aunt Cynthia will be deceived after all, even if she be short-sighted.  Buying a cat in a joke is a huge risk.  And if she should see through the scheme I shall be in a pretty mess.\"  \"Oh, Max,\" I said, on the verge of tears.  \"Of course,\" said Max, looking meditatively into the fire, \"if I were really one of the family, or had any reasonable prospect of being so, I would not mind so much.  It would be all in the day's work then.  But as it is--\"  Ismay got up and went out of the room.  \"Oh, Max, please,\" I said.  \"Will you marry me, Sue?\" demanded Max sternly.  \"If you will agree, I'll go to Halifax and beard the lion in his den unflinchingly.  If necessary, I will take a black street cat to Aunt Cynthia, and swear that it is Fatima.  I'll get you out of the scrape, if I have to prove that you never had Fatima, that she is safe in your possession at the present time, and that there never was such an animal as Fatima anyhow.  I'll do anything, say anything--but it must be for my future wife.\"  \"Will nothing else content you?\" I said helplessly.  \"Nothing.\"  I thought hard.  Of course Max was acting abominably--but--but--he was really a dear fellow--and this was the twelfth time--and there was Anne Shirley!  I knew in my secret soul that life would be a dreadfully dismal thing if Max were not around somewhere. Besides, I would have married him long ago had not Aunt Cynthia thrown us so pointedly at each other's heads ever since he came to Spencervale.  \"Very well,\" I said crossly.  Max left for Halifax in the morning.  Next day we got a wire saying it was all right.  The evening of the following day he was back in Spencervale.  Ismay and I put him in a chair and glared at him impatiently.  Max began to laugh and laughed until he turned blue.  \"I am glad it is so amusing,\" said Ismay severely.  \"If Sue and I could see the joke it might be more so.\"  \"Dear little girls, have patience with me,\" implored Max.  \"If you knew what it cost me to keep a straight face in Halifax you would forgive me for breaking out now.\"  \"We forgive you--but for pity's sake tell us all about it,\" I cried.  \"Well, as soon as I arrived in Halifax I hurried to 110 Hollis Street, but--see here!  Didn't you tell me your Aunt's address was 10 Pleasant Street?\"  \"So it is.\"  \"'T isn't.  You look at the address on a telegram next time you get one.  She went a week ago to visit another friend who lives at 110 Hollis.\"  \"Max!\"  \"It's a fact.  I rang the bell, and was just going to ask the maid for 'Persian' when your Aunt Cynthia herself came through the hall and pounced on me.\"  \"'Max,' she said, 'have you brought Fatima?'  \"'No,' I answered, trying to adjust my wits to this new development as she towed me into the library.  'No, I--I--just came to Halifax on a little matter of business.'  \"'Dear me,' said Aunt Cynthia, crossly, 'I don't know what those girls mean.  I wired them to send Fatima at once.  And she has not come yet and I am expecting a call every minute from some one who wants to buy her.'  \"'Oh!' I murmured, mining deeper every minute.  \"'Yes,' went on your aunt, 'there is an advertisement in the Charlottetown _Enterprise_ for a Persian cat, and I answered it. Fatima is really quite a charge, you know--and so apt to die and be a dead loss,'--did your aunt mean a pun, girls?--'and so, although I am considerably attached to her, I have decided to part with her.'  \"By this time I had got my second wind, and I promptly decided that a judicious mixture of the truth was the thing required.  \"'Well, of all the curious coincidences,' I exclaimed.  'Why, Miss Ridley, it was I who advertised for a Persian cat--on Sue's behalf.  She and Ismay have decided that they want a cat like Fatima for themselves.'  \"You should have seen how she beamed.  She said she knew you always really liked cats, only you would never own up to it.  We clinched the dicker then and there.  I passed her over your hundred and ten dollars--she took the money without turning a hair--and now you are the joint owners of Fatima.  Good luck to your bargain!\"  \"Mean old thing,\" sniffed Ismay.  She meant Aunt Cynthia, and, remembering our shabby furs, I didn't disagree with her.  \"But there is no Fatima,\" I said, dubiously.  \"How shall we account for her when Aunt Cynthia comes home?\"  \"Well, your aunt isn't coming home for a month yet.  When she comes you will have to tell her that the cat--is lost--but you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5340"],["title","Further Chronicles of Avonlea (#3)"],["body","eedn't say WHEN it happened.  As for the rest, Fatima is your property now, so Aunt Cynthia can't grumble.  But she will have a poorer opinion than ever of your fitness to run a house alone.\"  When Max left I went to the window to watch him down the path. He was really a handsome fellow, and I was proud of him.  At the gate he turned to wave me good-by, and, as he did, he glanced upward.  Even at that distance I saw the look of amazement on his face.  Then he came bolting back.  \"Ismay, the house is on fire!\" I shrieked, as I flew to the door.  \"Sue,\" cried Max, \"I saw Fatima, or her ghost, at the garret window a moment ago!\"  \"Nonsense!\" I cried.  But Ismay was already half way up the stairs and we followed.  Straight to the garret we rushed.  There sat Fatima, sleek and complacent, sunning herself in the window.  Max laughed until the rafters rang.  \"She can't have been up here all this time,\" I protested, half tearfully.  \"We would have heard her meowing.\"  \"But you didn't,\" said Max.  \"She would have died of the cold,\" declared Ismay.  \"But she hasn't,\" said Max.  \"Or starved,\" I cried.  \"The place is alive with mice,\" said Max.  \"No, girls, there is no doubt the cat has been here the whole fortnight.  She must have followed Huldah Jane up here, unobserved, that day.  It's a wonder you didn't hear her crying--if she did cry.  But perhaps she didn't, and, of course, you sleep downstairs.  To think you never thought of looking here for her!\"  \"It has cost us over a hundred dollars,\" said Ismay, with a malevolent glance at the sleek Fatima.  \"It has cost me more than that,\" I said, as I turned to the stairway.  Max held me back for an instant, while Ismay and Fatima pattered down.  \"Do you think it has cost too much, Sue?\" he whispered.  I looked at him sideways.  He was really a dear. Niceness fairly exhaled from him.  \"No-o-o,\" I said, \"but when we are married you will have to take care of Fatima, _I_ won't.\"  \"Dear Fatima,\" said Max gratefully.    II. THE MATERIALIZING OF CECIL  It had never worried me in the least that I wasn't married, although everybody in Avonlea pitied old maids; but it DID worry me, and I frankly confess it, that I had never had a chance to be.  Even Nancy, my old nurse and servant, knew that, and pitied me for it.  Nancy is an old maid herself, but she has had two proposals.  She did not accept either of them because one was a widower with seven children, and the other a very shiftless, good-for-nothing fellow; but, if anybody twitted Nancy on her single condition, she could point triumphantly to those two as evidence that \"she could an she would.\"  If I had not lived all my life in Avonlea I might have had the benefit of the doubt; but I had, and everybody knew everything about me--or thought they did.  I had really often wondered why nobody had ever fallen in love with me.  I was not at all homely; indeed, years ago, George Adoniram Maybrick had written a poem addressed to me, in which he praised my beauty quite extravagantly; that didn't mean anything because George Adoniram wrote poetry to all the good-looking girls and never went with anybody but Flora King, who was cross-eyed and red-haired, but it proves that it was not my appearance that put me out of the running.  Neither was it the fact that I wrote poetry myself--although not of George Adoniram's kind--because nobody ever knew that.  When I felt it coming on I shut myself up in my room and wrote it out in a little blank book I kept locked up.  It is nearly full now, because I have been writing poetry all my life.  It is the only thing I have ever been able to keep a secret from Nancy.  Nancy, in any case, has not a very high opinion of my ability to take care of myself; but I tremble to imagine what she would think if she ever found out about that little book.  I am convinced she would send for the doctor post-haste and insist on mustard plasters while waiting for him.  Nevertheless, I kept on at it, and what with my flowers and my cats and my magazines and my little book, I was really very happy and contented.  But it DID sting that Adella Gilbert, across the road, who has a drunken husband, should pity \"poor Charlotte\" because nobody had ever wanted her.  Poor Charlotte indeed!  If I had thrown myself at a man's head the way Adella Gilbert did at--but there, there, I must refrain from such thoughts.  I must not be uncharitable.  The Sewing Circle met at Mary Gillespie's on my fortieth birthday.  I have given up talking about my birthdays, although that little scheme is not much good in Avonlea where everybody knows your age--or if they make a mistake it is never on the side of youth.  But Nancy, who grew accustomed to celebrating my birthdays when I was a little girl, never gets over the habit, and I don't try to cure her, because, after all, it's nice to have some one make a fuss over you.  She brought me up my breakfast before I got up out of bed--a concession to my laziness that Nancy would scorn to make on any other day of the year.  She had cooked everything I like best, and had decorated the tray with roses from the garden and ferns from the woods behind the house.  I enjoyed every bit of that breakfast, and then I got up and dressed, putting on my second best muslin gown.  I would have put on my really best if I had not had the fear of Nancy before my eyes; but I knew she would never condone THAT, even on a birthday.  I watered my flowers and fed my cats, and then I locked myself up and wrote a poem on June.  I had given up writing birthday odes after I was thirty.  In the afternoon I went to the Sewing Circle.  When I was ready for it I looked in my glass and wondered if I could really be forty.  I was quite sure I didn't look it.  My hair was brown and wavy, my cheeks were pink, and the lines could hardly be seen at all, though possibly that was because of the dim light.  I always have my mirror hung in the darkest corner of my room.  Nancy cannot imagine why.  I know the lines are there, of course; but when they don't show very plain I forget that they are there.  We had a large Sewing Circle, young and old alike attending.  I really cannot say I ever enjoyed the meetings--at least not up to that time--although I went religiously because I thought it my duty to go.  The married women talked so much of their husbands and children, and of course I had to be quiet on those topics; and the young girls talked in corner groups about their beaux, and stopped it when I joined them, as if they felt sure that an old maid who had never had a beau couldn't understand at all.  As for the other old maids, they talked gossip about every one, and I did not like that either.  I knew the minute my back was turned they would fasten into me and hint that I used hair-dye and declare it was perfectly ridiculous for a woman of FIFTY to wear a pink muslin dress with lace-trimmed frills.  There was a full attendance that day, for we were getting ready for a sale of fancy work in aid of parsonage repairs.  The young girls were merrier and noisier than usual.  Wilhelmina Mercer was there, and she kept them going.  The Mercers were quite new to Avonlea, having come here only two months previously.  I was sitting by the window and Wilhelmina Mercer, Maggie Henderson, Susette Cross and Georgie Hall were in a little group just before me.  I wasn't listening to their chatter at all, but presently Georgie exclaimed teasingly:  \"Miss Charlotte is laughing at us.  I suppose she thinks we are awfully silly to be talking about beaux.\"  The truth was that I was simply smiling over some very pretty thoughts that had come to me about the roses which were climbing over Mary Gillespie's sill.  I meant to inscribe them in the little blank book when I went home.  Georgie's speech brought me back to harsh realities with a jolt.  It hurt me, as such speeches always did.  \"Didn't you ever have a beau, Miss Holmes?\" said Wilhelmina laughingly.  Just as it happened, a silence had fallen over the room for a moment, and everybody in it heard Wilhelmina's question.  I really do not know what got into me and possessed me.  I have never been able to account for what I said and did, because I am naturally a truthful person and hate all deceit.  It seemed to me that I simply could not say \"No\" to Wilhelmina before that whole roomful of women.  It was TOO humiliating.  I suppose all the prickles and stings and slurs I had endured for fifteen years on account of never having had a lover had what the new doctor calls \"a cumulative effect\" and came to a head then and there.  \"Yes, I had one once, my dear,\" I said calmly.  For once in my life I made a sensation.  Every woman in that room stopped sewing and stared at me.  Most of them, I saw, didn't believe me, but Wilhelmina did.  Her pretty face lighted up with interest.  \"Oh, won't you tell us about him, Miss Holmes?\" she coaxed, \"and why didn't you marry him?\"  \"That is right, Miss Mercer,\" said Josephine Cameron, with a nasty little laugh.  \"Make her tell.  We're all interested.  It's news to us that Charlotte ever had a beau.\"  If Josephine had not said that, I might not have gone on.  But she did say it, and, moreover, I caught Mary Gillespie and Adella Gilbert exchanging significant smiles.  That settled it, and made me quite reckless.  \"In for a penny, in for a pound,\" thought I, and I said with a pensive smile:  \"Nobody here knew anything about him, and it was all long, long ago.\"  \"What was his name?\" asked Wilhelmina.  \"Cecil Fenwick,\" I answered promptly.  Cecil had always been my favorite name for a man; it figured quite frequently in the blank book.  As for the Fenwick part of it, I had a bit of newspaper in my hand, measuring a hem, with \"Try Fenwick's Porous Plasters\" printed across it, and I simply joined the two in sudden and irrevocable matrimony.  \"Where did you meet him?\" asked Georgie.  I hastily reviewed my past.  There was only one place to locate Cecil Fenwick.  The only time I had ever been"]]]
