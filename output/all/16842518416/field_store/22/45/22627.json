Katuti is poor, and the little words \"Give me! scare away friends as the cry of a hawk scares the chickens. My poor mistress!\"  \"It is a large sum,\" muttered Paaker to himself.  \"It is enormous!\" sighed the dwarf, \"and where is it to be found in these hard times?  It would have been different with us, if--ah if--.  And it would be a form of madness which I do not believe in, that Nefert should still care for her braggart husband.  She thinks as much of thee as of him.\"  Paaker looked at the dwarf half incredulous and half threatening.  \"Ay--of thee,\" repeated Nemu.  \"Since our excursion to the Necropolis the day before yesterday it was--she speaks only of thee, praising thy ability, and thy strong manly spirit.  It is as if some charm obliged her to think of thee.\"  The pioneer began to walk so fast that his small companion once more had to ask him to moderate his steps.  They gained the shore in silence, where Paaker's boat was waiting, which also conveyed his chariot.  He lay down in the little cabin, called the dwarf to him, and said:  \"I am Katuti's nearest relative; we are now reconciled; why does she not turn to me in her difficulty?\"  \"Because she is proud, and thy blood flows in her veins.  Sooner would she die with her child--she said so--than ask thee, against whom she sinned, for an \"alms.\"  \"She did think of me then?\"  \"At once; nor did she doubt thy generosity.  She esteems thee highly--I repeat it; and if an arrow from a Cheta's bow or a visitation of the Gods attained Mena, she would joyfully place her child in thine arms, and Nefert believe me has not forgotten her playfellow.  The day before yesterday, when she came home from the Necropolis, and before the letter had come from the camp, she was full of thee--       [\"To be full (meh) of any one\" is used in the Egyptian language for      \"to be in love with any one.\"]  nay called to thee in her dreams; I know it from Kandake, her black maid.\"  The pioneer looked down and said:  \"How extraordinary! and the same night I had a vision in which your mistress appeared to me; the insolent priest in the temple of Hathor should have interpreted it to me.\"  \"And he refused? the fool! but other folks understand dreams, and I am not the worst of them--Ask thy servant.  Ninety-nine times out of a hundred my interpretations come true.  How was the vision?\"  \"I stood by the Nile,\" said Paaker, casting down his eyes and drawing lines with his whip through the wool of the cabin rug.  \"The water was still, and I saw Nefert standing on the farther bank, and beckoning to me.  I called to her, and she stepped on the water, which bore her up as if it were this carpet.  She went over the water dry-foot as if it were the stony wilderness.  A wonderful sight!  She came nearer to me, and nearer, and already I had tried to take her hand, when she ducked under like a swan.  I went into the water to seize her, and when she came up again I clasped her in my arms; but then the strangest thing happened-- she flowed away, she dissolved like the snow on the Syrian hills, when you take it in your hand, and yet it was not the same, for her hair turned to water-lilies, and her eyes to blue fishes that swam away merrily, and her lips to twigs of coral that sank at once, and from her body grew a crocodile, with a head like Mena, that laughed and gnashed its teeth at me.  Then I was seized with blind fury; I threw myself upon him with a drawn sword, he fastened his teeth in my flesh, I pierced his throat with my weapon; the Nile was dark with our streaming blood, and so we fought and fought--it lasted an eternity--till I awoke.\"  Paaker drew a deep breath as he ceased speaking; as if his wild dream tormented him again.  The dwarf had listened with eager attention, but several minutes passed before he spoke.  \"A strange dream,\" he said, \"but the interpretation as to the future is not hard to find.  Nefert is striving to reach thee, she longs to be thine, but if thou dost fancy that she is already in thy grasp she will elude thee; thy hopes will melt like ice, slip away like sand, if thou dost not know how to put the crocodile out of the way.\"  At this moment the boat struck the landing-place.  The pioneer started up, and cried, \"We have reached the end!\"  \"We have reached the end,\" echoed the little man with meaning.  \"There is only a narrow bridge to step over.\"  When they both stood on the shore, the dwarf said,  \"I  have  to  thank  thee  for  thy  hospitality,  and when I can serve thee command me.\"  \"Come here,\" cried the pioneer, and drew Nemu away with him under the shade of a sycamore veiled in the half light of the departing sun.  \"What do you mean by a bridge which we must step over?  I do not understand the flowers of speech, and desire plain language.\"  The dwarf reflected for a moment; and then asked, \"Shall I say nakedly and openly what I mean, and will you not be angry?\"  \"Speak!\"  \"Mena is the crocodile.  Put him out of the world, and you will have passed the bridge; then Nefert will be thine--if thou wilt listen to me.\"  \"What shall I do?\"  \"Put the charioteer out of the world.\"  Paaker's gesture seemed to convey that that was a thing that had long been decided on, and he turned his face, for a good omen, so that the rising moon should be on his right hand.  The dwarf went on.  \"Secure Nefert, so that she may not vanish like her image in the dream, before you reach the goal; that is to say, ransom the honor of your future mother and wife, for how could you take an outcast into your house?\"  Paaker looked thoughtfully at the ground.  \"May I inform my mistress that thou wilt save her?\"  asked Nemu. \"I may?--Then all will be well, for he who will devote a fortune to love will not hesitate to devote a reed lance with a brass point to it to his love and his hatred together.\"     CHAPTER XVI.  The sun had set, and darkness covered the City of the Dead, but the moon shone above the valley of the kings' tombs, and the projecting masses of the rocky walls of the chasm threw sharply-defined shadows.  A weird silence lay upon the desert, where yet far more life was stirring than in the noonday hour, for now bats darted like black silken threads through the night air, owls hovered aloft on wide-spread wings, small troops of jackals slipped by, one following the other up the mountain slopes.  From time to time their hideous yell, or the whining laugh of the hyena, broke the stillness of the night.  Nor was human life yet at rest in the valley of tombs.  A faint light glimmered in the cave of the sorceress Hekt, and in front of the paraschites' but a fire was burning, which the grandmother of the sick Uarda now and then fed with pieces of dry manure.  Two men were seated in front of the hut, and gazed in silence on the thin flame, whose impure light was almost quenched by the clearer glow of the moon; whilst the third, Uarda's father, disembowelled a large ram, whose head he had already cut off.  \"How the jackals howl!\"  said the old paraschites, drawing as he spoke the torn brown cotton cloth, which he had put on as a protection against the night air and the dew, closer round his bare shoulders.  \"They scent the fresh meat,\" answered the physician, Nebsecht.  \"Throw them the entrails, when you have done; the legs and back you can roast. Be careful how you cut out the heart--the heart, soldier.  There it is! What a great beast.\"  Nebsecht took the ram's heart in his hand, and gazed at it with the deepest attention, whilst the old paraschites watched him anxiously.  At length:  \"I promised,\" he said, \"to do for you what you wish, if you restore the little one to health; but you ask for what is impossible.\"  \"Impossible?\"  said the physician, \"why, impossible?  You open the corpses, you go in and out of the house of the embalmer.  Get possession of one of the canopi,       [Vases of clay, limestone, or alabaster, which were used for the      preservation of the intestines of the embalmed Egyptians, and      represented the four genii of death, Amset, Hapi, Tuamutef, and      Khebsennuf.  Instead of the cover, the head of the genius to which      it was dedicated, was placed on each kanopus.  Amset (tinder the      protection of Isis) has a human head, Hapi (protected by Nephthys)      an ape's head, Tuamutef (protected by Neith) a jackal's head, and      Khebsennuf (protected by Selk) a sparrow-hawk's head.  In one of the      Christian Coptic Manuscripts, the four archangels are invoked in the      place of these genii.]  lay this heart in it, and take out in its stead the heart of a human being.  No one--no one will notice it.  Nor need you do it to-morrow, or the day after tomorrow even.  Your son can buy a ram to kill every day with my money till the right moment comes.  Your granddaughter will soon grow strong on a good meat-diet.  Take courage!\"  \"I am not afraid of the danger,\" said the old man, \"but how can I venture to steal from a dead man his life in the other world?  And then--in shame and misery have I lived, and for many a year--no man has numbered them for me--have I obeyed the commandments, that I may be found righteous in that world to come, and in the fields of Aalu, and in the Sun-bark find compensation for all that I have suffered here.  You are good and friendly.  Why, for the sake of a whim, should you sacrifice the future bliss of a man, who in all his long life has never known happiness, and who has never done you any harm?\"  \"What I want with the heart,\" replied the physician, \"you cannot understand, but in procuring it for me, you will be furthering a great and useful"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5442"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 04 (#2)"],["body","urpose.  I have no whims, for I am no idler.  And as to what concerns your salvation, have no anxiety.  I am a priest, and take your deed and its consequences upon myself; upon myself, do you understand? I tell you, as a priest, that what I demand of you is right, and if the judge of the dead shall enquire, 'Why didst thou take the heart of a human being out of the Kanopus?' then reply--reply to him thus, 'Because Nebsecht, the priest, commanded me, and promised himself to answer for the deed.'\"  The old man gazed thoughtfully on the ground, and the physician continued still more urgently:  \"If you fulfil my wish, then--then I swear to you that, when you die, I will take care that your mummy is provided with all the amulets, and I myself will write you a book of the Entrance into Day, and have it wound within your mummy-cloth, as is done with the great.       [The Books of the Dead are often found amongst the cloths, (by the      leg or under the arm), or else in the coffin trader, or near, the      mummy.]  That will give you power over all demons, and you will be admitted to the hall of the twofold justice, which punishes and rewards, and your award will be bliss.\"  \"But the theft of a heart will make the weight of my sins heavy, when my own heart is weighed,\" sighed the old man.  Nebsecht considered for a moment, and then said: \"I will give you a written paper, in which I will certify that it was I who commanded the theft.  You will sew it up in a little bag, carry it on your breast, and have it laid with you in the grave.  Then when Techuti, the agent of the soul, receives your justification before Osiris and the judges of the dead, give him the writing.  He will read it aloud, and you will be accounted just.\"       [The vignettes of Chapter 125 of the Book of the Dead represent the      Last Judgment of the Egyptians.  Under a canopy Osiris sits      enthroned as Chief Judge, 42 assessors assist him.  In the hall      stand the scales;  the dog headed ape, the animal sacred to Toth,      guides the balance.  In one scale lies the heart of the dead man, in      the other the image of the goddess of Truth, who introduces the soul      into the hall of justice  Toth writs the record.  The soul affirms      that it has not committed 42 deadly sins, and if it obtains credit,      it is named \"maa cheru,\" i.e. \"the truth-speaker,\" and is therewith      declared blessed.  It now receives its heart back, and grows into a      new and divine life.]  \"I am not learned in writing,\" muttered the paraschites with a slight mistrust that made itself felt in his voice.  \"But I swear to you by the nine great Gods, that I will write nothing on the paper but what I have promised you.  I will confess that I, the priest Nebsecht, commanded you to take the heart, and that your guilt is mine.\"  \"Let me have the writing then,\" murmured the old man.  The physician wiped the perspiration from his forehead, and gave the paraschites his hand.  \"To-morrow you shall have it,\" he said, \"and I will not leave your granddaughter till she is well again.\"  The soldier engaged in cutting up the ram, had heard nothing of this conversation.  Now he ran a wooden spit through the legs, and held them over the fire to roast them.  The jackals howled louder as the smell of the melting fat filled the air, and the old man, as he looked on, forgot the terrible task he had undertaken.  For a year past, no meat had been tasted in his house.  The physician Nebsecht, himself eating nothing but a piece of bread, looked on at the feasters.  They tore the meat from the bones, and the soldier, especially, devoured the costly and unwonted meal like some ravenous animal.  He could be heard chewing like a horse in the manger, and a feeling of disgust filled the physician's soul.  \"Sensual beings,\" he murmured to himself, \"animals with consciousness! And yet human beings.  Strange!  They languish bound in the fetters of the world of sense, and yet how much more ardently they desire that which transcends sense than we--how much more real it is to them than to us!\"  \"Will you have some meat?\"  cried the soldier, who had remarked that Nebsecht's lips moved, and tearing a piece of meat from the bone of the joint he was devouring, he held it out to the physician.  Nebsecht shrank back; the greedy look, the glistening teeth, the dark, rough features of the man terrified him.  And he thought of the white and fragile form of the sick girl lying within on the mat, and a question escaped his lips.  \"Is the maiden, is Uarda, your own child?\"  he said.  The soldier struck himself on the breast.  \"So sure as the king Rameses is the son of Seti,\" he answered.  The men had finished their meal, and the flat cakes of bread which the wife of the paraschites gave them, and on which they had wiped their hands from the fat, were consumed, when the soldier, in whose slow brain the physician's question still lingered, said, sighing deeply:  \"Her mother was a stranger; she laid the white dove in the raven's nest.\"  \"Of what country was your wife a native?\"  asked the physician.  \"That I do not know,\" replied the soldier.  \"Did you never enquire about the family of your own wife?\"  \"Certainly I did: but how could she have answered me?  But it is a long and strange story.\"  \"Relate it to me,\" said Nebsecht, \"the night is long, and I like listening better than talking.  But first I will see after our patient.\"  When the physician had satisfied himself that Uarda was sleeping quietly and breathing regularly, he seated himself again by the paraschites and his son, and the soldier began:  \"It all happened long ago.  King Seti still lived, but Rameses already reigned in his stead, when I came home from the north.  They had sent me to the workmen, who were building the fortifications in Zoan, the town of Rameses.--[The Rameses of the Bible.  Exodus i.  ii.]--I was set over six men, Amus,--[Semites]--of the Hebrew race, over whom Rameses kept such a tight hand.       [For an account of the traces of the Jews in Egypt, see Chabas,      Melanges, and Ebers, AEgypten und die Bucher Moses]  Amongst the workmen there were sons of rich cattle-holders, for in levying the people it was never: 'What have you?' but 'Of what race are you?'  The fortifications and the canal which was to join the Nile and the Red Sea had to be completed, and the king, to whom be long life, health, and prosperity, took the youth of Egypt with him to the wars, and left the work to the Amus, who are connected by race with his enemies in the east.  One lives well in Goshen, for it is a fine country, with more than enough of corn and grass and vegetables and fish and fowls, and I always had of the best, for amongst my six people were two mother's darlings, whose parents sent me many a piece of silver.  Every one loves his children, but the Hebrews love them more tenderly than other people. We had daily our appointed tale of bricks to deliver, and when the sun burnt hot, I used to help the lads, and I did more in an hour than they did in three, for I am strong and was still stronger then than I am now.  \"Then came the time when I was relieved.  I was ordered to return to Thebes, to the prisoners of war who were building the great temple of Amon over yonder, and as I had brought home some money, and it would take a good while to finish the great dwelling of the king of the Gods, I thought of taking a wife; but no Egyptian.  Of daughters of paraschites there were plenty; but I wanted to get away out of my father's accursed caste, and the other girls here, as I knew, were afraid of our uncleanness.  In the low country I had done better, and many an Amu and Schasu woman had gladly come to my tent.  From the beginning I had set my mind on an Asiatic.  \"Many a time maidens taken prisoners in war were brought to be sold, but either they did not please me, or they were too dear.  Meantime my money melted away, for we enjoyed life in the time of rest which followed the working hours.  There were dancers too in plenty, in the foreign quarter.  \"Well, it was just at the time of the holy feast of Amon-Chem, that a new transport of prisoners of war arrived, and amongst them many women, who were sold publicly to the highest bidder.  The young and beautiful ones were paid for high, but even the older ones were too dear for me.  \"Quite at the last a blind woman was led forward, and a withered-looking woman who was dumb, as the auctioneer, who generally praised up the merits of the prisoners, informed the buyers.  The blind woman had strong hands, and was bought by a tavern-keeper, for whom she turns the handmill to this day; the dumb woman held a child in her arms, and no one could tell whether she was young or old.  She looked as though she already lay in her coffin, and the little one as though he would go under the grass before her.  And her hair was red, burning red, the very color of Typhon. Her white pale face looked neither bad nor good, only weary, weary to death.  On her withered white arms blue veins ran like dark cords, her hands hung feebly down, and in them hung the child.  If a wind were to rise, I thought to myself, it would blow her away, and the little one with her.  \"The auctioneer asked for a bid.  All were silent, for the dumb shadow was of no use for work; she was half-dead, and a burial costs money.  \"So passed several minutes.  Then the auctioneer stepped up to her, and gave her a blow with his whip, that she might rouse herself up, and appear less miserable to the buyers.  She shivered like a person in a fever, pressed the child closer to her, and looked round at every one as though seeking for help--and me full in the face.  What happened now was a real wonder, for her eyes were bigger than any that I ever saw, and a demon dwelt in them that had power over me and ruled me to the end, and that day it bewitched me for the first time.  \"It was not hot and I had drunk nothing, and yet I acted against my own will and better"]]]
