But I don't find Zopyrus' proposal a bad one.\"  \"Then so let it be,\" said Darius, yielding.  \"In that case Oroetes must provide us with the uniform of Lydian Taxiarchs.\"  \"You'd better take the splendid dress of the Chiliarchs\" at once, I think,\" cried Gyges.  \"Why, on such young men, that would excite suspicion directly.\"  \"But we can't appear as common soldiers.\"  \"No, but as Hekatontarchs.\"  \"All right,\" said Zopyrus laughing.  \"Anything you like except a shop- keeper.--So in three days we are off.  I am glad I shall just have time to make sure of the satrap's little daughter, and to visit the grove of Cybele at last.  Now, goodnight, Bartja; don't get up too early.  What will Sappho say, if you come to her with pale cheeks?\"     CHAPTER X.  The sun of a hot midsummer-day had risen on Naukratis.  The Nile had already begun to overflow its banks, and the fields and gardens of the Egyptians were covered with water.  The harbor was crowded with craft of all kinds.  Egyptian vessels were there, manned by Phoenician colonists from the coasts of the Delta, and bringing fine woven goods from Malta, metals and precious stones from Sardinia, wine and copper from Cyprus.  Greek triremes laden with oil, wine and mastic-wood; metal-work and woollen wares from Chalcis, Phoenician and Syrian craft with gaily-colored sails, and freighted with cargoes of purple stuffs, gems, spices, glass-work, carpets and cedar- trees,--used in Egypt, where wood was very scarce, for building purposes, and taking back gold, ivory, ebony, brightly-plumaged tropical birds, precious stones and black slaves,--the treasures of Ethiopia; but more especially the far-famed Egyptian corn, Memphian chariots, lace from Sais, and the finer sorts of papyrus.  The time when commerce was carried on merely by barter was now, however, long past, and the merchants of Naukratis not seldom paid for their goods in gold coin and carefully- weighed silver.  Large warehouses stood round the harbor of this Greek colony, and slightly-built dwelling-houses, into which the idle mariners were lured by the sounds of music and laughter, and the glances and voices of painted and rouged damsels.  Slaves, both white and colored, rowers and steersmen, in various costumes, were hurrying hither and thither, while the ships' captains, either dressed in the Greek fashion or in Phoenician garments of the most glaring colors, were shouting orders to their crews and delivering up their cargoes to the merchants.  Whenever a dispute arose, the Egyptian police with their long staves, and the Greek warders of the harbor were quickly at hand.  The latter were appointed by the elders of the merchant-body in this Milesian colony.  The port was getting empty now, for the hour at which the market opened was near, and none of the free Greeks cared to be absent from the market- place then.  This time, however, not a few remained behind, curiously watching a beautifully-built Samian ship, the Okeia, with a long prow like a swan's neck, on the front of which a likeness of the goddess Hera was conspicuous.  It was discharging its cargo, but the public attention was more particularly attracted by three handsome youths, in the dress of Lydian officers, who left the ship, followed by a number of slaves carrying chests and packages.  The handsomest of the three travellers, in whom of course our readers recognize their three young friends, Darius, Bartja and Zopyrus, spoke to one of the harbor police and asked for the house of Theopompus the Milesian, to whom they were bound on a visit.  Polite and ready to do a service, like all the Greeks, the police functionary at once led the way across the market-place,--where the opening of business had just been announced by the sound of a bell,--to a handsome house, the property of the Milesian, Theopompus, one of the most important and respected men in Naukratis.  The party, however, did not succeed in crossing the market-place without hindrance.  They found it easy enough to evade the importunities of impudent fishsellers, and the friendly invitations of butchers, bakers, sausage and vegetable-sellers, and potters.  But when they reached the part allotted to the flower-girls, Zopyrus was so enchanted with the scene, that he clapped his hands for joy.       [Separate portions of the market were set apart for the sale of      different goods.  The part appointed for the flower-sellers, who      passed in general for no better than they should be, was called the      \"myrtle-market.\"  Aristoph.  Thesmoph. 448.]  Three wonderfully-lovely girls, in white dresses of some half-transparent material, with colored borders, were seated together on low stools, binding roses, violets and orange-blossoms into one long wreath.  Their charming heads were wreathed with flowers too, and looked very like the lovely rosebuds which one of them, on seeing the young men come up, held out to their notice.  \"Buy my roses, my handsome gentlemen,\" she said in a clear, melodious voice, \"to put in your sweethearts' hair.\"  Zopyrus took the flowers, and holding the girl's hand fast in his own, answered, \"I come from a far country, my lovely child, and have no sweetheart in Naukratis yet; so let me put the roses in your own golden hair, and this piece of gold in your white little hand.\"  The girl burst into a merry laugh, showed her sister the handsome present, and answered: \"By Eros, such gentlemen as you cannot want for sweethearts.  Are you brothers?\"  \"No.\"  \"That's a pity, for we are sisters.\"  \"And you thought we should make three pretty couples?\"  \"I may have thought it, but I did not say so.\"  \"And your sisters?\"       [This passage was suggested by the following epigram of Dionysius      \"Roses are blooming on thy cheek, with roses thy basket is laden,      Which dost thou sell?  The flowers?  Thyself?  Or both, my pretty      maiden?\"]  The girls laughed, as if they were but little averse to such a connection, and offered Bartja and Darius rosebuds too.  The young men accepted them, gave each a gold piece in return, and were not allowed to leave these beauties until their helmets had been crowned with laurel.  Meanwhile the news of the strangers' remarkable liberality had spread among the many girls, who were selling ribbons, wreaths and flowers close by.  They all brought roses too and invited the strangers with looks and words to stay with them and buy their flowers.  Zopyrus, like many a young gentleman in Naukratis, would gladly have accepted their invitations, for most of these girls were beautiful, and their hearts were not difficult to win; but Darius urged him to come away, and begged Bartja to forbid the thoughtless fellow's staying any longer.  After passing the tables of the money-changers, and the stone seats on which the citizens sat in the open air and held their consultations, they arrived at the house of Theopompus.  The stroke given by their Greek guide with the metal knocker on the house-door was answered at once by a slave.  As the master was at the market, the strangers were led by the steward, an old servant grown grey in the service of Theopompus, into the Andronitis, and begged to wait there until he returned.  They were still engaged in admiring the paintings on the walls, and the artistic carving of the stone floor, when Theopompus, the merchant whom we first learnt to know at the house of Rhodopis, came back from the market, followed by a great number of slaves bearing his purchases.       [Men of high rank among the Greeks did not disdain to make purchases      at market, accompanied by their slaves, but respectable women could      not appear there.  Female slaves were generally sent to buy what was      needed.]  He received the strangers with charming politeness and asked in what way he could be of use to them, on which Bartja, having first convinced himself that no unwished--for listeners were present, gave him the roll he had received from Phanes at parting.  Theopompus had scarcely read its contents, when he made a low bow to the prince, exclaiming: \"By Zeus, the father of hospitality, this is the greatest honor that could have been conferred upon my house!  All I possess is yours, and I beg you to ask your companions to accept with kindness what I can offer.  Pardon my not having recognized you at once in your Lydian dress.  It seems to me that your hair is shorter and your beard thicker, than when you left Egypt.  Am I right in imagining that you do not wish to be recognized?  It shall be exactly as you wish.  He is the best host, who allows his guests the most freedom.  All, now I recognize your friends; but they have disguised themselves and cut their curls also.  Indeed, I could almost say that you, my friend, whose name--\"  \"My name is Darius.\"  \"That you, Darius, have dyed your hair black.  Yes?  Then you see my memory does not deceive me.  But that is nothing to boast of, for I saw you several times at Sais, and here too, on your arrival and departure. You ask, my prince, whether you would be generally recognized?  Certainly not.  The foreign dress, the change in your hair and the coloring of your eyebrows have altered you wonderfully.  But excuse me a moment, my old steward seems to have some important message to give.\"  In a few minutes Theopompus came back, exclaiming: \"No, no, my honored friends, you have certainly not taken the wisest way of entering Naukratis incognito.  You have been joking with the flower-girls and paying them for a few roses, not like runaway Lydian Hekatontarchs, but like the great lords you are.  All Naukratis knows the pretty, frivolous sisters, Stephanion, Chloris and Irene, whose garlands have caught many a heart, and whose sweet glances have lured many a bright obolus out of the pockets of our gay young men.  They're very fond of visiting the flower- girls at market-time, and agreements are entered into then for which more than one gold piece must be paid later; but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5458"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 09 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS, Part 2.  By Georg Ebers  Volume 9.    CHAPTER XI.  According to the law of Egypt, Zopyrus had deserved death.  As soon as his friends heard this, they resolved to go to Sais and try to rescue him by stratagem.  Syloson, who had friends there and could speak the Egyptian language well, offered to help them.  Bartja and Darius disguised themselves so completely by dyeing their hair and eyebrows and wearing broad-brimmed felt-hats,--that they could scarcely recognize each other.  Theopompus provided them with ordinary Greek dresses, and, an hour after Zopyrus' arrest, they met the splendidly-got-up Syloson on the shore of the Nile, entered a boat belonging to him and manned by his slaves, and, after a short sail, favored by the wind, reached Sais,--which lay above the waters of the inundation like an island,--before the burning midsummer sun had reached its noonday height.  They disembarked at a remote part of the town and walked across the quarter appropriated to the artisans.  The workmen were busy at their calling, notwithstanding the intense noonday heat.  The baker's men were at work in the open court of the bakehouse, kneading bread--the coarser kind of dough with the feet, the finer with the hands.  Loaves of various shapes were being drawn out of the ovens-round and oval cakes, and rolls in the form of sheep, snails and hearts.  These were laid in baskets, and the nimble baker's boys would put three, four, or even five such baskets on their heads at once, and carry them off quickly and safely to the customers living in other quarters of the city.  A butcher was slaughtering an ox before his house, the creature's legs having been pinioned; and his men were busy sharpening their knives to cut up a wild goat.  Merry cobblers were calling out to the passers-by from their stalls; carpenters, tailors, joiners and weavers--were all there, busy at their various callings.  The wives of the work-people were going out marketing, leading their naked children by the hand, and some soldiers were loitering near a man who was offering beer and wine for sale.  But our friends took very little notice of what was going on in the streets through which they passed; they followed Syloson in silence.  At the Greek guard-house he asked them to wait for him.  Syloson, happening to know the Taxiarch who was on duty that day, went in and asked him if he had heard anything of a man accused of murder having been brought from Naukratis to Sais that morning.  \"Of course,\" said the Greek.  \"It's not more than half an hour since he arrived.  As they found a purse full of money in his girdle, they think he must be a Persian spy.  I suppose you know that Cambyses is preparing for war with Egypt.\"  \"Impossible!\"  \"No, no, it's a fact.  The prince-regent has already received information.  A caravan of Arabian merchants arrived yesterday at Pelusium, and brought the news.\"  \"It will prove as false as their suspicions about this poor young Lydian. I know him well, and am very sorry for the poor fellow.  He belongs to one of the richest families in Sardis, and only ran away for fear of the powerful satrap Oroetes, with whom he had had a quarrel.  I'll tell you the particulars when you come to see me next in Naukratis.  Of course you'll stay a few days and bring some friends.  My brother has sent me some wine which beats everything I ever tasted.  It's perfect nectar, and I confess I grudge offering it to any one who's not, like you, a perfect judge in such matters.\"  The Taxiarch's face brightened up at these words, and grasping Syloson's hand, he exclaimed.  \"By the dog, my friend, we shall not wait to be asked twice; we'll come soon enough and take a good pull at your wine-skins.  How would it be if you were to ask Archidice, the three flower-sisters, and a few flute-playing-girls to supper?\"       [Archidice--A celebrated Hetaira of Naukratis mentioned by Herod.      II.  135.  Flute-playing girls were seldom missing at the young      Greeks' drinking-parties]  \"They shall all be there.  By the bye, that reminds me that the flower- girls were the cause of that poor young Lydian's imprisonment.  Some jealous idiot attacked him before their house with a number of comrades. The hot-brained young fellow defended himself .  .  .  .\"  \"And knocked the other down?\"   \"Yes; and so that he'll never get up again.\"  \"The boy must be a good boxer.\"  \"He had a sword.\"  \"So much the better for him.\"  \"No, so much the worse; for his victim was an Egyptian.\"  \"That's a bad job.  I fear it can only have an unfortunate end.  A foreigner, who kills an Egyptian, is as sure of death as if he had the rope already round his neck.  However, just now he'll get a few days' grace; the priests are all so busy praying for the dying king that they have no time to try criminals.\"  \"I'd give a great deal to be able to save that poor fellow.  I know his father.\"  \"Yes, and then after all he only did his duty.  A man must defend himself.\"  \"Do you happen to know where he is imprisoned?\"  \"Of course I do.  The great prison is under repair, and so he has been put for the present in the storehouse between the principal guard-house of the Egyptian body-guard and the sacred grove of the temple of Neith. I have only just come home from seeing them take him there.\"  \"He is strong and has plenty of courage; do you think he could get away, if we helped him?\"  \"No, it would be quite impossible; he's in a room two stories high; the only window looks into the sacred grove, and that, you know, is surrounded by a ten-foot wall, and guarded like the treasury.  There are double sentries at every gate.  There's only one place where it is left unguarded during the inundation season, because, just here, the water washes the walls.  These worshippers of animals are as cautious as water- wagtails.\"  \"Well, it's  a great  pity, but I suppose we must leave the poor fellow to his fate.  Good-bye, Doemones; don't forget my invitation.\"  The Samian left the guard-room and went back directly to the two friends, who were waiting impatiently for him.  They listened eagerly to his tidings, and when he had finished his description of the prison, Darius exclaimed: \"I believe a little courage will save him.  He's as nimble as a cat, and as strong as a bear.  I have thought of a plan.\"  \"Let us hear it,\" said Syloson, \"and let me give an opinion as to its practicability.\"  \"We will buy some rope-ladders, some cord, and a good bow, put all these into our boat, and row to the unguarded part of the temple-wall at dusk. You must then help me to clamber over it.  I shall take the things over with me and give the eagle's cry.  Zopyras will know at once, because, since we were children, we have been accustomed to use it when we were riding or hunting together.  Then I shall shoot an arrow, with the cord fastened to it, up into his window, (I never miss), tell him to fasten a weight to it and let it down again to me.  I shall then secure the rope- ladder to the cord, Zopyrus will draw the whole affair up again, and hang it on an iron nail,--which, by the bye, I must not forget to send up with the ladder, for who knows whether he may have such a thing in his cell. He will then come down on it, go quickly with me to the part of the wall where you will be waiting with the boat, and where there must be another rope-ladder, spring into the boat, and there he is-safe!\"  \"First-rate, first-rate!\"  cried Bartja.  \"But very dangerous,\" added Syloson.  \"If we are caught in the sacred grove, we are certain to be severely punished.  The priests hold strange nightly festivals there, at which every one but the initiated is strictly forbidden to appear.  I believe, however, that these take place on the lake, and that is at some distance from Zopyrus' prison.\"  \"So much the better,\" cried Darius; \"but now to the main point.  We must send at once, and ask Theopompus to hire a fast trireme for us, and have it put in sailing order at once.  The news of Cambyses' preparations have already reached Egypt; they take us for spies, and will be sure not to let either Zopyrus or his deliverers escape, if they can help it.  It would be a criminal rashness to expose ourselves uselessly to danger. Bartja, you must take this message yourself, and must marry Sappho this very day, for, come what may, we must leave Naukratis to-morrow.  Don't contradict me, my friend, my brother!  You know our plan, and you must see that as only one can act in it, your part would be that of a mere looker-on.  As it was my own idea I am determined to carry it out myself. We shall meet again to-morrow, for Auramazda protects the friendship of the pure.\"  It was a long time before they could persuade Bartja to leave his friends in the lurch, but their entreaties and representations at last took effect, and he went down towards the river to take a boat for Naukratis, Darius and Syloson going at the same time to buy the necessary implements for their plan.  In order to reach the place where boats were to be hired, Bartja had to pass by the temple of Neith.  This was not easy, as an immense crowd was assembled at the entrance-gates.  He pushed his way as far as the obelisks near the great gate of the temple with its winged sun-disc and fluttering pennons, but there the temple-servants prevented him from going farther; they were keeping the avenue of sphinxes clear for a procession.  The gigantic doors of the Pylon opened, and Bartja, who, in spite of himself, had been pushed into the front row, saw a brilliant procession come out of the temple.  The unexpected sight of many faces he had formerly known occupied his attention so much, that he scarcely noticed the loss of his broad-brimmed hat, which had been"]]]
