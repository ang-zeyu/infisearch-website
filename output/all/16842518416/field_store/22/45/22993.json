Barbara had not forgotten this, and had understood how to keep him aloof with maidenly austerity until, on the evening before his departure, he had hung around her neck the big gold thaler his godfather had given him.  Then, obeying an impulse of gratitude, she had thrown her arms around his neck; but even then she would not allow him to kiss her lips again. Instead, she hastily drew back to examine the gold thaler closely, praised its weight and beauty, and then promised Wolf that when she was rich and he had become a great lord she would have a new goblet made for him out of just such coins, like one which she had seen at the Wollers in the Ark, the richest of her wealthy relatives.  As Wolf now recalled this promise it vexed him again.  What had he expected from that parting hour--the vow of eternal fidelity, a firm betrothal, ardent kisses, and a tender embrace?  But, instead of obtaining even one of these beautiful things, he had become involved in a dispute with Barbara because he desired to receive nothing from her, and only claimed the right of showering gifts upon her later.  This had pleased her, and, when he urged her to promise to wait for him and become his wife when he returned home a made man, she laughed gaily, and declared that she liked him, and, if it should be he who obtained for her what she now had in mind, she would be glad.  Then his loving heart overflowed, and with her hands clasped in his he entreated her to give up these arrogant thoughts, be faithful to him, and not make him wretched.  The words had poured so ardently, so passionately from the quiet, sedate young man's lips that the girl was thoroughly frightened, and wrenched her hands from his grasp.  But when she saw how deeply her struggling hurt him, she voluntarily held out her right hand, exclaiming:  \"Only succeed while you are absent sufficiently to build a house like our old one in the Kramgasse, and when the roof is on and your knightly escutcheon above the door we will move in together, and life will be nothing but music and happiness.\"  This was all that gave him the right to consider her as his betrothed bride, for after a brief farewell and a few kisses of the hand flung to him from the threshold, she had escaped to the little bow-windowed room and thereby also evaded from the departing lover an impressive, well- prepared speech concerning the duties of a betrothed couple.  Yet in Rome and Brussels Wolf had held fast to the conviction that a beloved betrothed bride was awaiting him in Ratisbon.  So long as his foster-parents lived he had had news from them of the Blombergs.  After the death of the old couple, Barbara's father had answered in a very awkward manner the questions which he had addressed to him in a letter, and his daughter wrote a friendly message under the old captain's signature.  True, it was extremely brief, but few fiery love letters ever made the recipient happier or were more tenderly pressed to the lips.  The girl he loved still bore the name of Barbara Blomberg.  This outweighed a whole archive of long letters.  The captain, who, for the sake of fighting the infidels, had so sadly neglected his property that his own house in the Kramgasse fell into the hands of his creditors, had rented the second story in the cantor house.  Barbara at that time was very small, but now she had ceased to be a child, and, after she devoted herself earnestly to acquiring the art of singing, the old warrior had undertaken to keep the little chapel in order.  The task certainly seemed strangely ill-suited to the tall, broad- shouldered man with the bushy eyebrows, long beard, and mustache twisted stiffly up at the ends, who had obtained in Tunis and during the Turkish war the reputation of being one of the most fearless heroes, and carried away severe wounds; but he knew how to make scoffers keep their distance, and did not trouble himself at all about other people.  Regularly every evening he went down the stairs and performed the duty he had undertaken with the punctilious care of a neat housewife.  He was a devout man, and did his work there in the hope of pleasing the Holy Virgin, because the reckless old warrior was indebted to her for more than one deliverance from impending death, and because he trusted that she would repay it to him in his child.  Besides, his income was not large enough for him to keep a maid-servant of his own, and he could not expect old Ursel, who had worked for the precentor and his wife, and performed the roughest labour in the third story for a mere \"thank you,\" to take care of the chapel also.  She had plenty to do, and besides she had been a Protestant three years, and took the Lord's Supper in a different form.  This would have induced him to break off every connection with his old friend's maid-servant had not his kind, grateful heart forbidden him to hurt her feelings.  Besides, she was almost indispensable to his daughter and himself; it was difficult enough, in any case, for the nobly born captain to meet the obligations imposed by his position.  He now received only a very small portion of the profits of the lumber trade which had supported his ancestors, his father, and himself very handsomely, for he had been compelled to mortgage his share in the business.  Notwithstanding the title of \"Captain\" with which his imperial commander had honoured him when he received his discharge, the pension he had was scarcely worth mentioning, and, besides, it was very irregularly paid. Therefore the father and daughter had tried to obtain some means of earning money which could be kept secret from their fellow-citizens. The \"Captain\" busied himself with tracing coats-of-arms, ornaments, and inscriptions upon tin goblets, mugs, tankards, and dishes.  Barbara, when she had finished her exercises in singing, washed fine laces.  This was done entirely in secret.  A certain Frau Lerch, who when a girl had served Barbara's dead mother as waiting maid, and now worked as a dressmaker for the most aristocratic women in Ratisbon, privately obtained this employment.  It was partly from affection for the young lady whom she had tended when a child; but the largest portion of Barbara's earnings returned to her, for she cut for the former all the garments she needed to appear among her wealthy relatives and young companions at dances, musical entertainments, banquets, and excursions to the country.  True, Frau Lerch, who was a childless woman, worked very cheaply for her, and, when she heard that Barbara had again been the greatest beauty, it pleased her, and she saw her seed ripening.  What a customer the vain darling, who was very ambitious, promised to become in the future as the wife of a rich aristocrat!  She would undoubtedly be that.  There was absolute guarantee of it in her marvellously beautiful head, with its abundant golden hair, her magnificent figure, which--she could not help knowing it-- was unequalled in Ratisbon, and her nightingale voice.  Even old Blomberg, who kept aloof from the meetings of his distinguished fellow-citizens, but, on the other hand, when his supply of money would permit, enjoyed a drinking bout at the tavern with men of the sword all the more, rejoiced to hear his daughter's rare gifts lauded.  The use of the graver was thoroughly distasteful and unsuited to his rank; but even the most laborious work gained a certain charm for his paternal heart when, while wiping the perspiration from his brow, he thought of what his diligence would allow him to devote to the adornment and instruction of his daughter.  He preferred to be alone at home, and his reserved, eccentric nature had caused his relatives to shun his house, which doubtless seemed to them contemptibly small.  Barbara endured this cheerfully, for, though she had many relatives and acquaintances among the companions of her own age, she possessed no intimate friend.  As a child, Wolf had been her favourite playmate, but now visits from her aunts and cousins would only have interrupted her secret work, and disturbed her practice of singing.  When Wolf entered the house, the captain had just left the chapel.  He did not notice the returning owner, for people must have made their way into the quiet dwelling.  At least he had heard talking in the entry of the second story, where usually it was even more noiseless than in his lodgings in the third, since it was tenanted only by old Ursel, who was now confined to her bed.  Wolf saw Barbara's father, whose height surpassed the stature of ordinary men by a head, hurrying up the stairs.  It was a strange, and, for children, certainly an alarming, sight--his left leg, which had been broken by a bullet from a howitzer, had remained stiff, and, as he leaped up three stairs at a time, he stretched his lean body so far forward that it seemed as though he could not help losing his balance at the next step.  He was in haste, for he thought that at last he could again acquit himself manfully and cope with one or rather with two or three of the burglars who, since the Duke of Bavaria had prohibited the conveyance of provisions into Ratisbon as a punishment for its desertion of the Catholic Church, had pursued their evil way in the city.  He first discovered with what very small ill-doers he had to deal when he held the little lamp toward them, and, to his sincere vexation, found that they were only little boys, who, moreover, were the children of honest folk, and therefore could scarcely be genuine scoundrels.  Yet it could hardly be any laudable purpose which brought them at so late an hour to the cantor house, and therefore, with the intention of turning the serious attack into a mirthful one; he shouted in a harsh voice the gibberish which he had compounded of scraps of all sorts of languages, and whose effect upon unruly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5561"],["title","Barbara Blomberg â€” Volume 01 (#7)"],["body","he had tested to his own amusement.  As his rough \"Larum gardum quantitere runze punze ke hi voi la\" now reached the little ones, the impression was far deeper than he had intended, for the cellar man's youngest son, a little fellow six years old, first shrieked aloud, and, when the terrible old man's long arms barred his way, he began to cry piteously.  This troubled the kind-hearted giant, who was really fond of children, and, ere the little lad was aware of it, the captain's free left hand grasped the waistband of his little leather breeches and lifted him into the air.  The swift act doubled the terror and anguish of the struggling little wight.  As the strong man held him on his arm he fought bravely with his fat little fists and his sturdy little legs.  But though in the unequal conflict the boy pitilessly pulled the powerful monster's grayishy yellow imperial and bushy mustache, and the captain recognised the child from the Red Cock as one of the rascals who often shouted their nickname of \"Turkey gobbler\" after his tall figure, conspicuous from its height and costume, he strove with honest zeal to soothe the little one.  His deep voice, meanwhile, sounded so gentle and friendly, and his promise to give him a piece of spice cake which he was bringing home to Ursel to sweeten the disagreeable taste of her medicine produced so soothing an influence, that little Hans at last looked up at him trustingly and hopefully.  The cellar man's oldest son, who had violently assaulted the old gentleman to release his little brother, now stood penitently before him, and the landlord's boy related, in somewhat confused but perfectly intelligible words, the object of their coming, and in whose name they were bringing the roll and yonder little package to old Ursel.  The story sounded humble enough, but as soon as the captain had set little Hans on his feet and bent curiously over the forerunners of the dear friend, which had been placed on the little bench by the door, the three boys dashed down the stairs, and the shrill voice of the landlord's son shrieked from the lowest step one \"Turkey gobbler\" and \"Pope's slave\" after another.  \"Satan's imps!\" shouted the old man; but the outer door, which banged below him, showed that pursuit of the naughty mockers would result to his disadvantage.  Then as, with an angry shake of the head, he drew back from the banisters, he saw his daughter's playmate.  How dear the latter was to him, and how fully his aged heart had retained its capacity of feeling, were proved by the reception which he gave the returning knight.  The injury just inflicted seemed to have been entirely forgotten.  With tears in his eyes and a voice tremulous with deep emotion, he drew Wolf toward him, kissing first his head, which reached only to his lips, then his cheeks and brow.  Then, with youthful vivacity, he expressed his pleasure in seeing him again, and, without permitting Wolf to speak, he repeatedly exclaimed:  \"And my Wawerl, and Ursel in there!  There'll be a jubilee!\"  When Wolf had at last succeeded in returning his old friend's greeting and then expressed a wish, first of all, to clasp the faithful old maid- servant's hand, the old gentleman's beaming face clouded, and he said, sighing:  \"What has not befallen us here since you went away, my dear Wolf!  My path has been bordered with tombstones as poplars line the highway.  But we will let the dead rest.  Nothing can now disturb their peace.  Old Ursel, too, is longing for the end of life, and we ought not to grudge it to her.  Only I dread the last hour, and still more the long eternity which will follow it, for the good, patient woman entered the snare of the Satanic Protestant doctrine, and will not hear of taking the holy sacrament.\"  Wolf begged him to admit him at once, but Blomberg declared that, after the attack of apoplexy which she had recently had, one thing and another might happen if she should so unexpectedly see the man to whom her whole heart clung.  Wolf would do better first to surprise the girl upstairs, who had no suspicion of his presence.  He, Blomberg, must look after the old woman now.  He would carry those things--he pointed to the parcels which the boys had left--into the young nobleman's old room.  Ursel had always kept it ready for his return, as though she expected him daily. This suited Wolf, only he insisted upon having his own way about the articles he had brought, and took them upstairs with him.  He would gladly have greeted the faithful nurse of his childhood at once, yet it seemed like a fortunate dispensation that, through the old man's delay below, his wish to have his first meeting with the woman he loved without witnesses should be fulfilled.     CHAPTER IV.  In spite of the darkness and the zigzag turns of the stairs, Wolf was so familiar with every corner of the old house that he did not even need to grope his way with his hand.  He found the door of the Blomberg lodgings open.  Putting down in the anteroom whatever might be in his way while greeting Barbara, and carrying the roll of velvet under his arm and a little box in his pocket, he entered the chamber which the old man called his artist workshop.  It was in total darkness, but through the narrow open door in the middle of the left wall one could see what was going on in Barbara's little bow- windowed room.  This was quite brightly lighted, for she was ironing and crimping ruffs for the neck, small lace handkerchiefs, and cuffs.  The light required for this purpose was diffused by a couple of tallow candles and also by the coals which heated the irons.  As she bent over the glow, it shone into her beautiful face and upon her magnificent fair hair, which rippled in luxuriant confusion about her round head or fell in thick waves to her hips.  The red kerchief which had confined it was lying on the floor.  Another had slipped from her neck and was hanging on the corner of the ironing board.  Her stockings had lost their fastenings and slipped down to her feet, revealing limbs whose whiteness and beauty of form vied with the round arms which, after holding the iron near her hot cheeks, she moved with eager diligence.  The image of a vivacious, early developed child had impressed itself upon Wolf's mind.  Now he stood before a maiden in the full bloom of her charms, whose superb symmetry of figure surprised and stirred him to the depths of his nature.  In spite of her immature youth, he had cherished her in his inmost heart.  youth, she confronted him as an entirely new and doubly desirable creature.  The quiet longing which had mastered him was transformed into passionate yearning, but he restrained it by exerting all the strength of will peculiar to him, for a voice within cried out that he was too insignificant for this marvellous maiden.  But when she dipped the tips of her fingers into the dainty little bowl, which he had once given her for a birthday present, sprinkled the linen with water, and meanwhile sang in fresh, clear notes the 'ut, re, me, fa, sol, la' of Perissone Cambio's singing lesson, new wonder seized him. What compass, what power, what melting sweetness the childish voice against whose shrillness his foster-father and he himself had zealously struggled now possessed!  Neither songstress nor member of the boy choir whom he had heard in Italy or the Netherlands could boast of such bell- like purity of tone!  He was a connoisseur, and yet it seemed as though every tone which he heard had received the most thorough cultivation.  Who in Ratisbon could have been her teacher?  To whom did she owe this masterly training?  As if by a miracle, he knew not whether from looking or listening, he found a combination of notes which he had long been seeking for the motet on which he was working.  When he had registered it, and she sang a few passages from it, what an exquisite delight awaited him!  But what should he do now?  Ought he to surprise her in this way?  It would certainly have been proper to be first announced by her father; but he could not bring himself even to stir a foot.  Beads of perspiration stood upon his brow.  Panting for breath, he seized his handkerchief to wipe it, and in doing so the roll of velvet which he had held under his arm fell on the floor.  Wolf stooped, and, ere he had straightened himself again, he heard Barbara call in a questioning tone, \"Father?\" and saw her put down the iron and stand listening.  Then, willing or not, he was obliged to announce his presence, and, with a timid \"It is I, Wolf,\" he approached the little bow-windowed room and hesitatingly crossed the threshold.  \"Wolf, my tame Wolf,\" she repeated gaily, without being in the least concerned about the condition of her dress.  \"I knew that we should soon meet again, for, just think of it!  I dreamed of you last night.  I was entering a golden coach.  It was very high, so I put my foot on your hand, and you lifted me in.\"  Then, without the least embarrassment, she held out her right hand, but slapped his fingers smartly when he passionately endeavoured to raise it to his lips.  Yet the blow was not unkindly meant, for even while he drew back she voluntarily clasped both his hands, scrutinized him intently from head to foot, and said calmly:  \"Welcome to the old home, Sir Knight!\"  Then, laughing gaily, she added: \"Why, such a thing is unprecedented!  Not a feature, not a look is unlike what it used to be!  And yet you've been roaming five years in foreign lands!  Changes take place--only look at me!--changes take place more swiftly here in Ratisbon.  How you stare at me!  I thought so!  Out with it!  Hasn't the feather-head of those days become quite a charming young lady?\"  Now Wolf would gladly have made as many flattering speeches as she could desire, but his tongue refused to obey him.  The new meeting was too unlike his expectation.  The sight of the self-conscious woman who, in her wonderful beauty, stood leaning with folded arms on"]]]
