If you yourself were such a son, and your ear had not perfectly caught the parting counsels of the dying- how many talents of silver would you not pay to be able to supply the missing words?  And what are immortal works of the great poets and thinkers but such sacred words of warning addressed, not to a single individual, but to all that are not barbarians, however many they maybe. They will elevate, instruct, and delight our descendants a thousand years hence as they do us at this day, and they, if they are not degenerate and ungrateful will be thankful to those who have devoted the best powers of their life to completing and restoring all that our mighty forefathers have said, as it must have originally stood before it was mutilated, and spoiled by carelessness and folly.  \"He who, like King Euergetes, puts one syllable in Homer right, in place of a wrong one, in my opinion has done a service to succeeding generations--aye and a great service.\"  \"What you say,\" replied Publius, \"sounds convincing, but it is still not perfectly clear to me; no doubt because I learned at an early age to prefer deeds to words.  I find it more easy to reconcile my mind to your painful and minute labors when I reflect that to you is entrusted the restoration of the literal tenor of laws, whose full meaning might be lost by a verbal error; or that wrong information might be laid before me as to one single transaction in the life of a friend or of a blood- relation, and it might lie with me to clear him of mistakes and misinterpretation.\"  \"And what are the works of the great singers of the deeds of the heroes- of the writers of past history, but the lives of our fathers related either with veracious exactness or with poetic adornments?\"  cried Aristarchus.  \"It is to these that my king and companion in study devotes himself with particular zeal.\"  \"When he is neither drinking, nor raving, nor governing, nor wasting his time in sacrificing and processions,\" interpolated Euergetes.  \"If I had not been a king perhaps I might have been an Aristarchus; as it is I am but half a king--since half of my kingdom belongs to you, Philometor--and but half a student; for when am I to find perfect quiet for thinking and writing?  Everything, everything in me is by halves, for I, if the scale were to turn in my favor\"--and here he struck his chest and his forehead, \"I should be twice the man I am.  I am my whole real self nowhere but at high festivals, when the wine sparkles in the cup, and bright eyes flash from beneath the brows of the flute-players of Alexandria or Cyrene-- sometimes too perhaps in council when the risk is great, or when there is something vast and portentous to be done from which my brother and you others, all of you, would shrink--nay perhaps even the Roman.  Aye!  so it is--and you will learn to know it.\"  Euergetes had roared rather than spoken the last words; his cheeks were flushed, his eyes rolled, while he took from his head both the garland of flowers and the golden fillet, and once more pushed his fingers through his hair.  His sister covered her ears with her hands, and said: \"You positively hurt me!  As no one is contradicting you, and you, as a man of culture, are not accustomed to add force to your assertions, like the Scythians, by speaking in a loud tone, you would do well to save your metallic voice for the further speech with which it is to be hoped you will presently favor us.  We have had to bow more than once already to the strength of which you boast--but now, at a merry feast, we will not think of that, but rather continue the conversation which entertained us, and which had begun so well.  This eager defence of the interests which most delight the best of the Hellenes in Alexandria may perhaps result in infusing into the mind of our friend Publius Scipio--and through him into that of many young Romans--a proper esteem for a line of intellectual effort which he could not have condemned had he not failed to understand it perfectly.  \"Very often some striking poetical turn given to a subject makes it, all at once, clear to our comprehension, even when long and learned disquisitions have failed; and I am acquainted with such an one, written by an anonymous author, and which may please you--and you too, Aristarchus.  It epitomizes very happily the subject of our discussion. The lines run as follows:                     \"Behold, the puny Child of Man                     Sits by Time's boundless sea,                     And gathers in his feeble hand                     Drops of Eternity.                      \"He overhears some broken words                     Of whispered mystery                     He writes them in a tiny book                     And calls it 'History!'  \"We owe these verses to an accomplished friend; another has amplified the idea by adding the two that follow:                     \"If indeed the puny Child of Man                     Had not gathered drops from that wide sea,                     Those small deeds that fill his little span                     Had been lost in dumb Eternity.                      \"Feeble is his hand, and yet it dare                     Seize some drops of that perennial stream;                     As they fall they catch a transient gleam--                     Lo!  Eternity is mirrored there!  \"What are we all but puny children?  And those of us who gather up the drops surely deserve our esteem no less than those who spend their lives on the shore of that great ocean in mere play and strife--\"  \"And love,\" threw in Eulaeus in a low voice, as he glanced towards Publius.  \"Your poet's verses are pretty and appropriate,\" Aristarchus now said, \"and I am very happy to find myself compared to the children who catch the falling drops.  There was a time--which came to an end, alas! with the great Aristotle--when there were men among the Greeks, who fed the ocean of which you speak with new tributaries; for the gods had bestowed on them the power of opening new sources, like the magician Moses, of whom Onias, the Jew, was lately telling us, and whose history I have read in the sacred books of the Hebrews.  He, it is true--Moses I mean--only struck water from the rock for the use of the body, while to our philosophers and poets we owe inexhaustible springs to refresh the mind and soul.  The time is now past which gave birth to such divine and creative spirits; as your majesties' forefathers recognized full well when they founded the Museum of Alexandria and the Library, of which I am one of the guardians, and which I may boast of having completed with your gracious assistance.  When Ptolemy Soter first created the Museum in Alexandria the works of the greatest period could receive no additions in the form of modern writings of the highest class; but he set us--children of man, gathering the drops--the task of collecting and of sifting them, of eliminating errors in them--and I think we have proved ourselves equal to this task.  \"It has been said that it is no less difficult to keep a fortune than to deserve it; and so perhaps we, who are merely 'keepers' may nevertheless make some credit--all the more because we have been able to arrange the wealth we found under hand, to work it profitably, to apply it well, to elucidate it, and to make it available.  When anything new is created by one of our circle we always link it on to the old; and in many departments we have indeed even succeeded in soaring above the ancients, particularly in that of the experimental sciences.  The sublime intelligence of our forefathers commanded a broad horizon--our narrower vision sees more clearly the objects that lie close to us.  We have discovered the sure path for all intellectual labor, the true scientific method; and an observant study of things as they are, succeeds better with us than it did with our predecessors.  Hence it follows that in the provinces of the natural sciences, in mathematics, astronomy, mechanics and geography the sages of our college have produced works of unsurpassed merit.  Indeed the industry of my associates--\"  \"Is very great,\" cried Euergetes.  \"But they stir up such a dust that all free-thought is choked, and because they value quantity above all things in the results they obtain, they neglect to sift what is great from what is small; and so Publius Scipio and others like him, who shrug their shoulders over the labors of the learned, find cause enough to laugh in their faces.  Out of every four of you I should dearly like to set three to some handicraft, and I shall do it too, one of these days--I shall do it, and turn them and all their miserable paraphernalia out of the Museum, and out of my capital.  They may take refuge with you, Philometor, you who marvel at everything you cannot do yourself, who are always delighted to possess what I reject, and to make much of those whom I condemn--and Cleopatra I dare say will play the harp, in honor of their entering Memphis.\"  \"I dare say!\"  answered the queen, laughing bitterly.  \"Still, it is to be expected that your wrath may fall even on worthy men.  Until then I will practise my music, and study the treatise on harmony that you have begun writing.  You are giving us proof to-day of how far you have succeeded in attaining unison in your own soul.\"  \"I like you in this mood!\"  cried Euergetes.  \"I love you, sister, when you are like this!  It ill becomes the eagle's brood to coo like the dove, and you have sharp talons though you hide them never so well under your soft feathers.  It is true that I am writing a treatise on harmony, and I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5462"],["title","The Sisters â€” Volume 2 (#8)"],["body"," doing it with delight; still it is one of those phenomena which, though accessible to our perception, are imperishable, for no god even could discover it entire and unmixed in the world of realities.  Where is harmony to be found in the struggles and rapacious strife of the life of the Cosmos?  And our human existence is but the diminished reflection of that process of birth and decease, of evolution and annihilation, which is going on in all that is perceptible to our senses; now gradually and invisibly, now violently and convulsively, but never harmonyously.  \"Harmony is at home only in the ideal world--harmony which is unknown even among the gods harmony, whom I may know, and yet may never comprehend--whom I love, and may never possess--whom I long for, and who flies from me.  \"I am as one that thirsteth, and harmony as the remote, unattainable well--I am as one swimming in a wide sea, and she is the land which recedes as I deem myself near to it.  \"Who will tell me the name of the country where she rules as queen, undisturbed and untroubled?  And which is most in earnest in his pursuit of the fair one: He who lies sleeping in her arms, or he who is consumed by his passion for her?  \"I am seeking what you deem that you possess.--Possess--!  \"Look round you on the world and on life--look round, as I do, on this hall of which you are so proud!  It was built by a Greek; but, because the simple melody of beautiful forms in perfect concord no longer satisfies you, and your taste requires the eastern magnificence in which you were born, because this flatters your vanity and reminds you, each time you gaze upon it, that you are wealthy and powerful--you commanded your architect to set aside simple grandeur, and to build this gaudy monstrosity, which is no more like the banqueting-hall of a Pericles than I or you, Cleopatra, in all our finery, are like the simply clad gods and goddesses of Phidias.  I mean not to offend you, Cleopatra, but I must say this; I am writing now on the subject of harmony, and perhaps I shall afterwards treat of justice, truth, virtue; although I know full well that they are pure abstractions which occur neither in nature nor in human life, and which in my dealings I wholly set aside; nevertheless they seem to me worthy of investigation, like any other delusion, if by resolving it we may arrive at conditional truth.  It is because one man is afraid of another that these restraints--justice, truth, and what else you will--have received these high-sounding names, have been stamped as characteristics of the gods, and placed under the protection of the immortals; nay, our anxious care has gone so far that it has been taught as a doctrine that it is beautiful and good to cloud our free enjoyment of existence for the sake of these illusions.  Think of Antisthenes and his disciples, the dog-like Cynics--think of the fools shut up in the temple of Serapis!  Nothing is beautiful but what is free, and he only is not free who is forever striving to check his inclinations--for the most part in vain--in order to live, as feeble cowards deem virtuously, justly and truthfully.  \"One animal eats another when he has succeeded in capturing it, either in open fight or by cunning and treachery; the climbing plant strangles the tree, the desert-sand chokes the meadows, stars fall from heaven, and earthquakes swallow up cities.  You believe in the gods--and so do I after my own fashion--and if they have so ordered the course of this life in every class of existence that the strong triumph over the weak, why should not I use my strength, why let it be fettered by those much- belauded soporifics which our prudent ancestors concocted to cool the hot blood of such men as I, and to paralyze our sinewy fists.  \"Euergetes--the well-doer--I was named at my birth; but if men choose to call me Kakergetes--the evil-doer--I do not mind it, since what you call good I call narrow and petty, and what you call evil is the free and unbridled exercise of power.  I would be anything rather than lazy and idle, for everything in nature is active and busy; and as, with Aristippus, I hold pleasure to be the highest good, I would fain earn the name of having enjoyed more than all other men; in the first place in my mind, but no less in my body which I admire and cherish.\"  During this speech many signs of disagreement had found expression, and Publius, who for the first time in his life heard such vicious sentiments spoken, followed the words of the headstrong youth with consternation and surprise.  He felt himself no match for this overbearing spirit, trained too in all the arts of argument and eloquence; but he could not leave all he had heard uncontroverted, and so, as Euergetes paused in order to empty his refilled cup, he began:  \"If we were all to act on your principles, in a few centuries, it seems to me, there would be no one left to subscribe to them; for the earth would be depopulated; and the manuscripts, in which you are so careful to substitute 'siu' for 'iu', would be used by strong-handed mothers, if any were left, to boil the pot for their children--in this country of yours where there is no wood to burn.  Just now you were boasting of your resemblance to Alcibiades, but that very gift which distinguished him, and made him dear to the Athenians--I mean his beauty--is hardly possible in connection with your doctrines, which would turn men into ravening beasts.  He who would be beautiful must before all things be able to control himself and to be moderate--as I learnt in Rome before I ever saw Athens, and have remembered well.  A Titan may perhaps have thought and talked as you do, but an Alcibiades--hardly!\"  At these words the blood flew to Euergetes' face; but he suppressed the keen and insulting reply that rose to his lips, and this little victory over his wrathful impulse was made the more easy as Lysias, at this moment, rejoined the feasters; he excused himself for his long absence, and then laid before Cleopatra and her husband the gems belonging to Publius.  They were warmly admired; even Euergetes was not grudging of his praise, and each of the company admitted that he had rarely seen anything more beautiful and graceful than the bashful Hebe with downcast eyes, and the goddess of persuasion with her hand resting on the bride's arm.  \"Yes, I will take the part of Peitho,\" said Cleopatra with decision.  \"And I that of Heracles,\" cried Euergetes.  \"But who is the fair one,\" asked King Philometor of Lysias, whom you have in your eye, as fulfilling this incomparably lovely conception of Hebe? While you were away I recalled to memory the aspect of every woman and girl who frequents our festivals, but only to reject them all, one after the other.\"  \"The fair girl whom I mean,\" replied Lysias, \"has never entered this or any other palace; indeed I am almost afraid of being too bold in suggesting to our illustrious queen so humble a child as fit to stand beside her, though only in sport.\"  \"I shall even have to touch her arm with my hand!\"  said the queen anxiously, and she drew up her fingers as if she had to touch some unclean thing.  If you mean a flower-seller or a flute-player or something of that kind--\"  \"How could I dare to suggest anything so improper?\"  Lysias hastily interposed.  \"The girl of whom I speak may be sixteen years old; she is innocence itself incarnate, and she looks like a bud ready to open perhaps in the morning dew that may succeed this very night, but which as yet is still enfolded in its cup.  She is of Greek race, about as tall as you are, Cleopatra; she has wonderful gazelle-like eyes, her little head is covered by a mass of abundant brown hair, when she smiles she has delicious dimples in her cheeks--and she will be sure to smile when such a Peitho speaks to her!\"  \"You are rousing our curiosity,\" cried Philometor.  \"In what garden, pray, does this blossom grow?\"  \"And how is it,\" added Cleopatra, \"that my husband has not discovered it long since, and transplanted it to our palace.\"  \"Probably,\" answered Lysias, \"because he who possesses Cleopatra, the fairest rose of Egypt, regards the violets by the roadside as too insignificant to be worth glancing at.  Besides, the hedge that fences round my bud grows in a gloomy spot; it is difficult of access and suspiciously watched.  To be brief: our Hebe is a water-bearer in the temple of Serapis, and her name is Irene.\"     CHAPTER XI.  Lysias was one of those men from whose lips nothing ever sounds as if it were meant seriously.  His statement that he regarded a serving girl from the temple of Serapis as fit to personate Hebe, was spoken as naturally and simply as if he were telling a tale for children; but his words produced an effect on his hearers like the sound of waters rushing into a leaky ship.  Publius had turned perfectly white, and it was not till his friend had uttered the name of Irene that he in some degree recovered his composure; Philometor had struck his cup on the table, and called out in much excitement:  \"A water-bearer of Serapis to play Hebe in a gay festal performance!  Do you conceive it possible, Cleopatra?\"  \"Impossible--it is absolutely out of the question,\" replied the queen, decidedly.  Euergetes, who also had opened his eyes wide at the Corinthian's proposition, sat for a long time gazing into his cup in silence; while his brother and sister continued to express their surprise and disapprobation and to speak of the respect and consideration which even kings must pay to the priests and servants of Serapis.  At length, once more lifting his wreath and crown, he raised his curls with both hands, and said, quite calmly and decisively;  \"We must have a Hebe, and must take her where we find her.  If you hesitate to allow the girl to be fetched it shall be done by my orders. The priests of Serapis are for the most part Greeks, and the high-priest is a Hellene.  He will not trouble himself much about a half-grown-up girl"]]]
