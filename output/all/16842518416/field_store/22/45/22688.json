Remember, Psamtik has promised us fifty gold rings if we bring the Athenian to Sais dead or alive.'  This is the report of Sebek, who has been in your service seven years, O Phanes.\"  To both these accounts Phanes listened calmly.  Rhodopis trembled. Aristomachus exclaimed, \"Not a hair of your head shall be touched, if Egypt perish for it!\"  Croesus advised prudence.  A tremendous excitement had mastered the whole party.  At last Phanes broke silence, saying: \"Reflection is never more necessary than in a time of danger.  I have thought the matter over, and see clearly that escape will be difficult.  The Egyptians will try to get rid of me quietly.  They know that I intend going on board a Phoecean trireme, which sets sail for Sigeum at a very early hour to-morrow morning, and have therefore no time to lose, if they will seize me.  Your garden, Rhodopis, is entirely surrounded, and were I to remain here, your house would no longer be respected as a sanctuary; it would be searched and I taken in it.  There can be no doubt that a watch has been set over the Phoecean ship also.  Blood shall not be shed in vain on my account.\"  \"But  you  dare  not  surrender!\"  cried  Aristomachus.  \"No, no, I have a plan,\" shouted Theopompus the Milesian merchant.  \"At sunrise to-morrow a ship sails for Miletus laden with Egyptian corn, but not from Naukratis, from Canopus.  Take the noble Persian's horse and ride thither.  We will cut a way for you through the garden.\"  \"But,\" said Gyges, \"our little band is not strong enough to carry out such an attempt.  We number in all ten men, and of these only three have swords; our enemies, on the other hand, number at least a hundred, and are armed to the teeth.\"  \"Lydian!\"  cried Aristomachus, \"wert thou ten times more fainthearted than thou art, and were our enemies double their number, I at least, will fight them!\"  Phanes grasped his friend's hand.  Gyges turned pale.  This brave warrior had called him fainthearted; and again he could find no words to answer; for at every stirring emotion his tongue failed him.  Suddenly the blood mounted to his face; his words came quickly and with decision: \"Athenian, follow me! and thou, Spartan, who art not wont to use words heedlessly, call no man fainthearted again before thou knowest him.  Friends, Phanes is safe,  Farewell, father!\"  The remaining guests surveyed these two departing men in silent wonder. As they stood there, silently listening, the sound of two horses galloping swiftly away fell on their ear, and after a longer interval a prolonged whistle from the Nile and a cry of distress.  \"Where is Knakias?\"  said Rhodopis to one of her slaves.  \"He went into the garden with Phanes and the Persian,\" was the answer, and as it was being spoken, the old slave re-entered, pale and trembling.  \"Have you seen my son?\"  cried Croesus.  \"Where is Phanes?\"  \"I was to bid you farewell from them both.\"  \"Then they are gone.--Whither?  How was it possible?\" .  .  .  \"The Athenian and the Persian,\" began the slave, \"had a slight dispute in the anteroom.  This over, I was told to divest both of their robes. Phanes then put on the stranger's trousers, coat and girdle; on his own curls he placed the pointed Persian cap.  The stranger wrapped himself in the Athenian's chiton and mantle, placed the golden circlet above his brow, caused the hair to be shaved from his upper lip, and ordered me to follow him into the garden.  Phanes, whom in his present dress, none could imagine to be other than a Persian, mounted one of the horses still waiting before the gate; the stranger called after him, 'Farewell Gyges, farewell beloved Persian, a pleasant journey to thee, Gyges!'  The servant, who had been waiting, followed on the other horse.  I could hear the clatter of arms among the bushes, but the Athenian was allowed to depart unmolested, the soldiers, without doubt, believing him to be a Persian.  \"On returning to the house the stranger's orders were: 'Accompany me to Phanes' bark, and cease not to call me by the Athenian's name.'  'But the boatmen will betray you,' I said.  'Then go alone to them,' he answered, 'and command them to receive me as their master, Phanes.'  Then I prayed him to allow me to take the dress of the fugitive and become a prey to the pursuers; but he would by no means allow this, and said my gait and carriage would betray me.  There alas! he spoke truly, for only the free man can walk erect; the neck of the slave is bent; the schools in which the noble and the freeborn learn grace and beauty of movement are not for him.  And so it must remain, the children must be even as the fathers; can the unclean onion-root produce a rose, or the unsightly radish a hyacinth?  Constant bondage bows the neck of the slave, but the consciousness of freedom gives dignity to the stature.\"  \"But what has become of my son?\"  interrupted Croesus.  \"He would not accept my poor offer, and took his seat in the bark, sending a thousand greetings unto thee, O king!  I cried after him, 'Farewell Phanes!  I wish thee a prosperous journey, Phanes!'  At that moment a cloud crossed the moon; and from out the thick darkness I heard screams, and cries for help; they did not, however, last long, a shrill whistle followed, then all was silent; and the measured strokes of oars were the only sounds that fell on my ear.  I was on the point of returning to relate what I had seen, when the boatman Sebek swam up once more and told as follows: The Egyptians had caused a leak to be made in Phanes' boat, and at a short distance from land it had filled and began to sink.  On the boatmen crying for help, the royal bark, which was following, had come up and taken the supposed Phanes on board, but had prevented the rowers from leaving their benches.  They all went down with the leaking boat, the daring Sebek alone excepted.  Gyges is on board the royal boat; Phanes has escaped, for that whistle must have been intended for the soldiers in ambush at the garden-gate.  I searched the bushes, the soldiers were gone, and I could hear the sound of their voices and weapons on their way back to Sais.\"  The guests listened with eager attention to this tale.  At its close a mingled feeling of relief and anxiety was felt by all; relief that their favorite companion had escaped so fearful a danger, anxiety for the brave young Lydian who had risked his life to save him.  They praised his generosity, congratulated Croesus on possessing such a son, and finally agreed in the conclusion, that, when the crown-prince discovered the error into which his emissaries had fallen, he must certainly release Gyges, and even make him compensation for what he had suffered at their hands.  The friendship already shown by Amasis, and the fear in which he evidently stood of the Persian power, were the thoughts which had power to calm Croesus, who soon left, in order to pass the night at the house of Theopompus, the Milesian merchant.  At parting, Aristomachus said: \"Salute Gyges in my name; tell him I ask his forgiveness, and hope one day either to enjoy his friendship, or, if that cannot be, to meet him as a fair foe on the field of battle.\"  \"Who knows what the future may bring?\"  answered Croesus giving his hand to the Spartan.     CHAPTER IX.  The sun of a new day had risen over Egypt, but was still low in the east; the copious dew, which, on the Nile, supplies the place of rain, lay sparkling like jewels on the leaves and blossoms, and the morning air, freshened by a north-west wind, invited those to enjoy it who could not bear the heat of mid-day.  Through the door of the country-house, now so well known to us, two female figures have just passed; Melitta, the old slave, and Sappho, the grandchild of Rhodopis.  The latter is not less lovely now, than when we saw her last, asleep. She moves through the garden with a light quick step, her white morning robe with its wide sleeves falling in graceful drapery over her lithe limbs, the thick brown hair straying from beneath the purple kerchief over her head, and a merry, roguish smile lurking round her rosy mouth and in the dimples of her cheeks and chin.  She stooped to pick a rose, dashed the dew from it into the face of her old nurse, laughing at her naughty trick till the clear bell-like tones rang through the garden; fixed the flower in her dress and began to sing in a wonderfully rich and sweet voice--                      Cupid once upon a bed                     Of roses laid his weary head;                     Luckless urchin! not to see                     Within the leaves a slumbering bee.                     The bee awak'd--with anger wild                     The bee awak'd, and stung the child.                     Loud and piteous are his cries;                     To Venus quick he runs, he flies;                     \"Oh mother!  I am wounded through--                     \"I die with pain--in sooth I do!                     \"Stung by some little angry thing.                     \"Some serpent on a tiny wing,                     \"A bee it was--for once, I know,                     \"I heard a rustic call it so.\"  \"Isn't that a very pretty song?\"  asked the laughing girl.  \"How stupid of little Eros to mistake a bee for a winged snake!  Grandmother says that the great poet Anacreon wrote another verse to this song, but she will not teach it me.  Tell me, Melitta, what can there be in that verse? There, you are smiling; dear, darling Melitta, do sing me that one verse. Perhaps though, you don't know it yourself?  No?  then certainly you can't teach it me.\"  \"That is a new song,\" answered the old woman, evading her darling's question, \"I only know the songs of the good old times.  But hark! did not you hear a knock at the gate?\"       [The last lines which contain the point of this song are:                      Thus he spoke, and she, the while,                     Heard him with a soothing smile;      "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5452"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 03 (#7)"],["body","               Then said, \"My infant, if so much                     \"Thou feel the little wild bee's touch,                     \"How must the heart, ah!  Cupid be,                     \"The hapless heart that's stung by thee?\"       --Translation from one of Anacreon's songs]  \"Yes, of course I did, and I think the sound of horses' hoofs too.  Go and see who seeks admission so early.  Perhaps, after all, our kind Phanes did not go away yesterday, and has come to bid us farewell once more.\"  \"Phanes is gone,\" said Melitta, becoming serious, \"and Rhodopis has ordered me to send you in when visitors arrive.  Go child, that I may open the gate.  There, they have knocked again.\"  Sappho pretended to run in, but instead of obeying her nurse's orders, stopped and hid herself behind a rose-bush, hoping to catch sight of these early guests.  In the fear of needlessly distressing her, she had not been told of the events of the previous evening, and at this early hour could only expect to see some very intimate friend of her grandmother's.  Melitta opened the gate and admitted a youth splendidly apparelled, and with fair curling hair.  It was Bartja, and Sappho was so lost in wonder at his beauty, and the Persian dress, to her so strange, that she remained motionless in her hiding-place, her eyes fixed on his face.  Just so she had pictured to herself Apollo with the beautiful locks, guiding the sun-chariot.  As Melitta and the stranger came nearer she thrust her little head through the roses to hear what the handsome youth was saying so kindly in his broken Greek.  She heard him ask hurriedly after Croesus and his son; and then, from Melitta's answer, she gathered all that had passed the evening before, trembled for Phanes, felt so thankful to the generous Gyges, and again wondered who this youth in royal apparel could possibly be.  Rhodopis had told her about Cyrus's heroic deeds, the fall of Croesus and the power and wealth of the Persians, but still she had always fancied them a wild, uncultivated people.  Now, however, her interest in Persia increased with every look at the handsome Bartja.  At last Melitta went in to wake her grandmother and announce the guest, and Sappho tried to follow her, but Eros, the foolish boy whose ignorance she had been mocking a moment before, had other intentions.  Her dress caught in the thorns, and before she could disengage it, the beautiful Bartja was standing before her, helping her to get free from the treacherous bush.  Sappho could not speak a word even of thanks; she blushed deeply, and stood smiling and ashamed, with downcast eyes.  Bartja, too, generally so full of fun and spirit, looked down at her without speaking, the color mounting to his cheeks.  The silence, however, did not last long, for Sappho, recovering from her fright, burst into a laugh of childish delight at the silent stranger and the odd scene, and fled towards the house like a timid fawn.  In a moment Bartja was himself again; in two strides he reached the young girl, quick as thought seized her hand and held it fast, notwithstanding all her struggles.  \"Let me go!\"  she cried half in earnest and half laughing, raising her dark eyes appealingly to him.  \"Why should I?\"  he answered.  \"I took you from the rose-bush and shall hold you fast until you give me your sister there, the other rose, from your bosom, to take home with me as a keepsake.\"  \"Please let me go,\" repeated Sappho, \"I will promise nothing unless you let my hand go.\"  \"But if I do, you will not run away again?\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"Well, then, I will give you your liberty, but now you must give me your rose.\"  \"There are plenty on the bush yonder, and more beautiful ones; choose whichever you like.  Why do you want just this one?\"  \"To keep it carefully in remembrance of the most beautiful maiden I ever saw.\"  \"Then I shall certainly not give it to you; for those are not my real friends who tell me I am beautiful, only those who tell me I am good.\"  \"Where did you learn that?\"  \"From my grandmother Rhodopis.\"  \"Very well, then I will tell you you are better than any other maiden in the whole world.\"  \"How can you say such things, when you don't know me at all?  Oh, sometimes I am very naughty and disobedient.  If I were really good I should be indoors now instead of talking to you here.  My grandmother has forbidden me ever to stay in the garden when visitors are here, and indeed I don't care for all those strange men who always talk about things I cannot understand.\"  \"Then perhaps you would like me to go away too?\"  \"Oh no, I can understand you quite well; though you cannot speak half so beautifully as our poor Phanes for example, who was obliged to escape so miserably yesterday evening, as I heard Melitta saying just this minute.\"  \"Did you love Phanes?\"  \"Love him?  Oh yes,--I was very fond of him.  When I was little he always brought me balls, dolls ninepins from Memphis and Sais; and now that I am older he teaches me beautiful new songs.\"       [Jointed dolls for children.  Wilkinson II. 427. Note 149.  In the      Leyden Museum one of these jointed toys is to be seen, in very good      preservation.]  \"As a parting gift he brought me a tiny Sicilian lapdog, which I am going to call Argos, because he is so white and swiftfooted.  But in a few days we are to have another present from the good Phanes, for .  .  .  There, now you can see what I am; I was just going to let out a great secret. My grandmother has strictly forbidden me to tell any one what dear little visitors we are expecting; but I feel as if I had known you a long time already, and you have such kind eyes that I could tell you everything. You see, when I am very happy, I have no one in the whole world to talk to about it, except old Melitta and my grandmother, and, I don't know how it is, that, though they love me so much, they sometimes cannot understand how trifles can make me so happy.\"  \"That is because they are old, and have forgotten what made them happy in their youth.  But have you no companions of your own age that you are fond of?\"  \"Not one.  Of course there are many other young girls beside me in Naukratis, but my grandmother says I am not to seek their acquaintance, and if they will not come to us I am not to go to them.\"  \"Poor child! if you were in Persia, I could soon find you a friend. I have a sister called Atossa, who is young and good, like you.\"  \"Oh, what a pity that she did not come here with you!--But now you must tell me your name.\"  \"My name is Bartja.\"  \"Bartja! that is a strange name!  Bartja-Bartja.  Do you know, I like it. How was the son of Croesus called, who saved our Phanes so generously?\"  \"Gyges.  Darius, Zopyrus and he are my best friends.  We have sworn never to part, and to give up our lives for one another,\" and that is why I came to-day, so early and quite in secret, to help my friend Gyges, in case he should need me.\"  \"Then you rode here for nothing.\"  \"No, by Mithras, that indeed I did not, for this ride brought me to you. But now you must tell me your name.\"  \"I am called Sappho.\"  \"That is a pretty name, and Gyges sings me sometimes beautiful songs by a poetess called Sappho.  Are you related to her?\"  \"Of course.  She was the sister of my grandfather Charaxus, and is called the tenth muse or the Lesbian swan.  I suppose then, your friend Gyges speaks Greek better than you do?\"  \"Yes, he learnt Greek and Lydian together as a little child, and speaks them both equally well.  He can speak Persian too, perfectly; and what is more, he knows and practises all the Persian virtues.\"  \"Which are the highest virtues then according to you Persians?\"  \"Truth is the first of all; courage the second, and the third is obedience; these three, joined with veneration for the gods, have made us Persians great.\"  \"But I thought you worshipped no gods?\"  \"Foolish child! who could live without a god, without a higher ruler? True, they do not dwell in houses and pictures like the gods of the Egyptians, for the whole creation is their dwelling.  The Divinity, who must be in every place, and must see and hear everything, cannot be confined within walls.\"  \"Where do you pray then and offer sacrifice, if you have no temples?\"  \"On the grandest of all altars, nature herself; our favorite altar is the summit of a mountain.  There we are nearest to our own god, Mithras, the mighty sun, and to Auramazda, the pure creative light; for there the light lingers latest and returns earliest.\"       [From Herodotus (I. 131 and 132.), and from many other sources, we      see clearly that at the time of the Achaemenidae the Persians had      neither temples nor images of their gods.  Auramazda and      Angramainjus, the principles of good and evil, were invisible      existences filling all creation with their countless train of good      and evil spirits.  Eternity created fire and water.  From these      Ormusd (Auramazda), the good spirit, took his origin.  He was      brilliant as the light, pure and good.  After having, in the course      of 12000 years, created heaven, paradise and the stars, he became      aware of the existence of an evil spirit, Ahriman (Angramainjus),      black, unclean, malicious and emitting an evil odor.  Ormusd      determined on his destruction, and a fierce strife began, in which      Ormusd was the victor, and the evil spirit lay 3000 years      unconscious from the effects of terror.  During this interval Ormusd      created the sky, the waters, the earth, all useful plants, trees and      herbs, the ox and the first pair of human beings in one year.      Ahriman, after this, broke loose, and was overcome but not slain.      As, after death, the four elements of which all things are composed,      Earth, Air, Fire and Water, become reunited with their primitive      elements; and as, at the resurrection-day, everything that has been      severed combines once more, and nothing returns into oblivion, all      is reunited to its"]]]
