Now, we must not utter another word.--If we are discovered, I will confess the truth; if you alone are seen, you can say--well, say you were waiting for Orion, to speak to him very early about the horse-fair at Niku.\"  \"A horse was off--off--offered me for sale this very day.\"  \"Good, very good; then you lingered in the vestibule to speak of that--to ask the master about it before he should go out.  It must be daylight in a few hours.--Now, come.\"  Paula went down the stairs with a sure and rapid step.  At the bottom Hiram again took off his shoes, holding them in his hand, so as to lose no time in following his mistress.  They went on in silence through the darkness till they reached the kitchen.  Here Paula turned and said to the Syrian:  \"If there is any one here, I will say I came to fetch some water; if there is no one I will cough and you can follow.  At any rate I will leave the door open, and then you will hear what happens.  If I am obliged to return, do you hurry on before me back by the way we came. In that case I will return to my room where you must wait outside till the side door is opened again, and if you are found there leave the explanation to me.--Shrink back, quite into that corner.\"  She softly opened the door into the kitchen; the roof was open to the light of the declining moon and myriad stars.  The room was quite empty: only a cat lay on a bench by the wide hearth, and a few bats flitted to and fro on noiseless wings; a few live coals still glowed among the ashes under the spits, like the eyes of lurking beasts of prey.  Paula coughed gently, and immediately heard Hiram's step behind her; then, with a beating heart and agonizing fears, she proceeded on her way.  First down a few steps, then through a dark passage, where the bats in their unswerving flight shot by close to her head.  At last they had to cross the large, open dining-hall.  This led into the viridarium, a spacious quadrangle, paved at the edges and planted in the middle, where a fountain played; round this square the Governor's residence was built. All was still and peaceful in this secluded space, vaulted over by the high heavens whose deep blue was thickly dotted with stars.  The moon would soon be hidden behind the top of the cornice which crowned the roof of the building.  The large-leaved plants in the middle of the quadrangle threw strange, ghostly shadows on the dewy grass-plot; the water in the fountain splashed more loudly than by day, but with a soothing, monotonous gurgle, broken now and then by a sudden short pause.  The marble pillars gleamed as white as snow, and filmy mists, which were beginning to rise from the damp lawn, floated languidly hither and thither on the soft night breeze, like ghosts veiled in flowing crape. Moths flitted noiselessly round and over the clumps of bushes, and the whole quiet and restful enclosure was full of sweetness from the Lotos flowers in the marble basin, from the blossoms of the luxuriant shrubs and the succulent tropical herbs at their feet.  At any other time it would have been a joy to pause and look round, only to breathe and let the silent magic of the night exert its spell; but Paula's soul was closed against these charms.  The sequestered silence lent a threatening accent to the furious wrangling in the court-yard, which was audible even here in bursts of uproar; and it was with an anxious heart that she observed that everything was not in its usual order; for her sharp eyes could discern no one, nothing, at the entrance to the tablinum, which was usually guarded by an armed sentinel or by the watch-dog; and surely-- yes, she was not mistaken--the bronze doors were open, and the moon shone on the bright metal of one half which stood ajar.  She stopped, and Hiram behind her did the same.  They both listened with such tension that the veins in their foreheads swelled; but from the tablinum, which was hardly thirty paces from them, came only very faint and intermittent sounds, indistinct in character and drowned by the tumult without.  A few long and anxious minutes, and then the half-closed door was suddenly opened and a man came forth.  Paula's heart stood still, but she did not for an instant lose her keenness of vision; she at once and positively recognized the man who came out of the tablinum as Orion and none other, and the big, long-haired dog too came out and past him, sniffed the air and then, with a loud bark, rushed on the two watchers. Trembling and with clenched teeth, but still mistress of herself, she let him come close to her, and then, calling him by his name: \"Beki\" in low, caressing tones, as soon as he recognized her, she laid her hand on his shaggy head to scratch his ears, as he loved it done.  Paula and her companion were standing behind a column in the deepest shadow.  Thus Orion could not see her, and the dog's loud bark had prevented his hearing her coaxing call; so when Beki was quiet and stood still, Orion whistled to him.  The obedient and watchful beast, ran back, wagging his tail; and his master, greeting him as \"a stupid old cat- hunter,\" let him spring over his arm, hugged the creature and then pushed him off again in play.  Then he closed the door and went into the apartments leading to the courtyard.  \"But he must come back this way to go to his own rooms,\" said Paula to her companion with a sigh of relief.  \"We must wait.  But now we must not lose a minute.  Come over to the door of the tablinum.  The dog will know me now and will not bark again.\"  They hastened on, and when they had reached the door, which lay in shadow within a deep doorway, Paula asked her companion:  \"Did you see who the man was who came out?\"  \"My lord Orion,\" said Hiram.  \"He was co--co--coming home from the town when I preceded you across the yard.\"  \"Indeed?\"  she said with apparent indifference, and as she leaned against the cold metal door-panels she looked back into the garden and thought she was now free to return.  She would describe to the freedman the way he must now go--it was quite simple; but she had not had time to do so when, from a room dividing the viridarium from the vestibule she heard first a woman's shrill voice; then the deeper tones of a man; and hardly had they exchanged a few sentences, when every sound was lost in the furious barking of the hound, and immediately after a loud shriek of pain from a woman fell upon her ear, and the noise of a heavy object falling to the ground.  What had happened?  It must be something portentous and terrible; of that there could be no doubt; and ere long Paula's fears were justified.  Out from the room where the scene had taken place rushed Orion, and with him the dog, across the grass-plot which was usually respected and cherished as holy ground, towards the side of the house facing the river, which was where he and all the family had their rooms.  \"Now!\"  cried Paula, quickly leading the way.  She flew in breathless haste through the first room and into the unguarded hall; but she had not reached the middle of it when she gave a scream, for before her in the moonlight, lay a body, motionless, at full length, on the hard, marble floor.  \"Run, Hiram, fly !\"  she cried to her companion.  \"The door is ajar-- open--I can see it is.\"  She fell on her knees by the side of the lifeless form, raised the head, and saw--the beautiful, deathlike face of the crazy Persian slave.  She felt her hand wet with the blood that had soaked the hapless girl's thick, fair hair, and she shuddered; but she resisted her impulse of horror and loathing, and perceiving some dark stains on the torn peplos she pulled it aside and saw that the white bosom was bleeding from deep wounds made in the tender flesh by the cruel fangs of the hound.  Paula's heart thrilled with indignation, grief and pity.  He--he whom she had only yesterday held to be the epitome of every manly perfection-- Orion, was guilty of so foul a deed!  He, of whose unflinching, dauntless courage she had heard so much, had fled like a coward, and had left the victim to her fate--twice a victim to him!  But something must be done besides lamenting and raging, and wondering how in one human soul there could be room for so much that was noble and fine with so much that was shameful and cruel.  She must save the girl, she must seek help, for Mandane's bosom still faintly rose and fell under Paula's tremulous fingers.  The freedman's brave heart would not allow him to fly to leave her with the injured girl; he flung his shoes on the floor, raised the senseless form, and propped it against one of the columns that stood round the hall.  It was not till his mistress had repeated her orders that he hurried away.  Paula watched him depart; as soon as she heard the heavy door of the atrium close upon him, heedless of her own suspicious-looking position, she shouted for help, so loudly that her cries rang through the nocturnal silence of the house, and in a few minutes, from this side and that, a slave, a maid, a clerk, a cook, a watchman, came hurrying in.  Foremost of all--so soon indeed that he must have been on his way when he heard her cry--came Orion.  He wore a light night-dress, intended, so she said to herself, to give the wretch the appearance of having sprung out of bed.  But was this indeed he?  Was this man with a flushed face, staring eyes, disordered hair and hoarse voice, that favorite of fortune whose happy nature, easy demeanor, sunny gaze and enchanting song had bewitched her soul?  His hand shook as he came close to her and the injured slave; and how forced and embarrassed was his enquiry as to what had happened; how scared he looked as he asked her what had brought her into this part of the house at such an hour.  She made no reply; but when his mother repeated the question soon after, in a sharp voice, she--she who had never in her life told a lie--said with hasty decision: \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5518"],["title","The Bride of the Nile â€” Volume 02 (#7)"],["body","not sleep, and the bark of the dog and a cry for help brought me here.\"  \"I call that having sharp ears!\"  retorted Neforis with an incredulous shrug.  \"For the future, at any rate, under similar circumstances you need not be so prompt.  How long, pray, have young girls trusted themselves alone when murder is cried?\"  \"If you had but armed yourself, fair daughter of heroes!\"  added Orion; but he had no sooner spoken than he bitterly regretted it.  What a glance Paula cast at him!  It was more than she could bear to hear him address her in jest, almost in mockery: him of all men, and at this moment for the first time--and to be thus reminded of her father!  She answered proudly and with cutting sharpness: \"I leave weapons to fighting men and murderers!\"  \"To fighting men, and murderers!\"  repeated Orion, pretending not to understand the point of her words.  He forced a smile; but then, feeling that he must make some defence, he added bitterly: \"Really, that sounds like the utterance of a feeble-hearted damsel!  But let me beg you to come closer and be calm.  These pitiable gashes on the poor creature's shoulder--I care more about her than you do, take my word for it--were inflicted by a four-footed assassin, whose weapons were given by nature. Yes, that is what happened.  Rough old Beki keeps watch at the door of the tablinum.  What brought the poor child here I know not, but he caught scent of her and pulled her down.\"  \"Or nothing of the kind!\"  interrupted Neforis, picking up a pair of man's shoes which lay on the ground by the sufferer.  Orion turned as pale as death and hastily took the shoes from his mother's hand; he would have liked to fling them up and away through the open roof.  How came they here?  Whose were they?  Who had been here this night?  Before going into the tablinum he had locked the outer door on that side, and had returned subsequently to open it again for the people in the court-yard.  It was not till after he had done this that the crazy girl had rushed upon him; she must have been lurking somewhere about when he first went through the atrium but had not then found courage enough to place herself in his way.  When she had thrown herself upon him, the dog had pulled her down before he could prevent it: he would certainly have sprung past her and have come to the rescue but that he must thus have betrayed his visit to the tablinum.  It had required all his presence of mind to hurry to his room, fling on his night garments, and rush back to the scene of disaster.  When Paula had first called for help he was already on his way, and with what feelings!  Never had he felt so bewildered, so confused, so deeply dissatisfied with himself; for the first time in his life, as he stood face to face with Paula, he dared not look straight into the eyes of his fellow-man.  And now these shoes!  The owner must have come there with the crazy girl, and if he had seen him in the tablinum and betrayed what he was doing there, how could he ever again appear in his parents' presence?  He had looked upon it as a good joke, but now it had turned to bitter earnest. At any cost he must and would prevent his nocturnal doings from becoming known!  Some new wrong-doing-nay, the worst was  preferable to a stain on his honor.--Whose could the shoes be?  He suddenly held them up on high, crying with a loud voice: \"Do these shoes belong to any of you, you people?  To the gate-keeper perhaps?\"  When all were silent, and the porter denied the ownership, he stood thinking; then he added with a defiant glare, and in a husky voice: \"Then some one who had broken into the house has been startled and dropped them.  Our house-stamp is here on the leather: they were made in our work-shop, and they still smell of the stable-here, Sebek, you can convince yourself.  Take them into your keeping, man; and tomorrow morning we will see who has left this suspicious offering in our vestibule.--You were the first to reach the spot, fair Paula.  Did you see a man about?\"  \"Yes,\" she replied with a hostile and challenging stare.  \"And which way did he go?\"  \"He fled across the viridarium like a coward, running across the poor, well-kept grass-plot to save time, and vanished upstairs in the dwelling- rooms.\"  Orion ground his teeth, and a mad hatred surged up in him of this mystery in woman's form in whose power, as it seemed, his ruin lay, and whose eyes mashed with revenge and the desire to undo him.  What was she plotting against him?  Was there a being on earth who would dare to accuse him, the spoilt favorite of great and small....?  And her look had meant more than aversion, it had expressed contempt....  How dare she look so at him?  Who in the wide world had a right to accuse him of anything that could justify such a feeling?  Never, never had he met with enmity like this, least of all from a girl.  He longed to annihilate the high-handed, cold-hearted, ungrateful creature who could humble him so outrageously after he had allowed her to see that his heart was hers, and who could make him quail--a man whose courage had been proved a hundred times.  He had to exercise his utmost self-control not to forget that she was a woman.--What had happened?  What demon had been playing tricks on him--What had so completely altered him within this half-hour that his whole being seemed subverted even to himself, and that any one dared to treat him so?  His mother at once observed the terrible change that came over her son's face when Paula declared that a man had fled towards the dwelling-rooms; but she accounted for it in her own way, and exclaimed in genuine alarm: \"Towards the Nile-wing, the rooms where your father sleeps?  Merciful Heaven! suppose they have planned an attack there!  Run--fly, Sebek.  \"Go across with some armed men!  Search the whole house from top to bottom!  Perhaps you will catch the rascal--he had trodden down the grass--you must find him--you must not let him escape.\"  The steward hurried off, but Paula begged the head gardener, who had come in with the rest, to compare the foot-prints of the fugitive, which must. yet be visible on the damp grass, with the shoes; her heart beat wildly, and again she tried to catch the young man's eye.  Orion, however, started forward and went into the viridarium, saying as he went: \"That is my concern.\"  But he was ashamed of himself, and felt as if something tight was throttling him.  In his own eyes he appeared like a thief caught in the act, a traitor, a contemptible rascal; and he began to perceive that he was indeed no longer what he had been before he had committed that fatal deed in the tablinum.  Paula breathed hard as she watched him go out.  Had he sunk so low as to falsify the evidence, and to declare that the groom's broad sole fitted the tracks of his small and shapely feet?  She hated him, and yet she could have found it in her heart to pray that this, at least, he might not do; and when he came back and said in some confusion that he could not be sure, that the shoes did not seem exactly to fit the foot-marks, she drew a breath of relief and turned again to the wounded girl and the physician, who, had now made his appearance.  Before Neforis followed her example she drew Orion aside and anxiously asked him what ailed him, he looked so pale and upset.  He only said with some hesitation: \"That poor girl's fate. . . .\" and he pointed to the Persian slave.--\"It troubles me.\"  \"You are so soft-hearted--you were as a boy!\"  said his mother soothingly.  She had seen the moisture sparkling in his eyes; but his tears were not for the Persian, but for the mysterious something--he himself knew not what to call it--that he had forfeited in this last hour, and of which the loss gave him unspeakable pain.  But their dialogue was interrupted: the first misfortune of this luckless night had brought its attendant: the body of Rustem, the splendid and radiantly youthful Rustem, the faithful Persian leader of the caravan, was borne into the hall, senseless.  He had made some satirical remark on the quarrel over creeds, and a furious Jacobite had fallen upon him with a log of wood, and dealt him a deep and perhaps mortal wound.  The leech at once gave him his care, and several of the crowd of muttering and whispering men, who had made their way in out of curiosity or with a wish to be of use, now hurried hither and thither in obedience to the physician's orders.  As soon as he saw the Masdakite's wound he exclaimed angrily:  \"A true Egyptian blow, dealt from behind!--What does this mob want here? Out with every man who does not belong to the place!  The first things needed are litters.  Will you, Dame Neforis, desire that two rooms may be got ready; one for that poor, gentle creature, and one for this fine fellow, though all will soon be over with him, short of a miracle.\"  \"To the north of the viridarium,\" replied the lady, \"there are two rooms at your service.\"  \"Not there!\"  cried the leech.  \"I must have rooms with plenty of fresh air, looking out upon the river.\"  \"There are none but the handsome rooms in the visitor's quarters, where my husband's niece has hers, Sick persons of the family have often lain there, but for such humble folk--you understand?\"  \"No--I am deaf,\" replied the physician.  \"Oh, I know that,\" laughed Neforis.  \"But those rooms are really just refurnished for exalted guests.\"  \"It would be hard to find any more exalted than such as these, sick unto death,\" replied Philippus.  \"They are nearer to God in Heaven than you are; to your advantage I believe.  Here, you people!  Carry these poor souls up to the guests' rooms.\"     CHAPTER IX.  \"It is impossible, impossible, impossible!\"  cried Orion, jumping up from his writing-table.  He thought of what he had done as a misfortune, and not as a crime; he himself hardly knew how it had all come about.  Yes, there must be demons, evil, spiteful demons--and it was they who had led him to so mad a deed.  Yesterday evening,"]]]
