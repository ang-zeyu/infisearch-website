Petrus softly laid his hand on his son's forehead and found it cool and free from fever.  Then he went quietly up to the portrait of Sirona, raised the cloth with which it was covered, and stood before it a long time sunk in thought.  At last he drew back, covered it up again, and examined the models which stood on a shelf fastened to the wall.  A small female figure particularly fixed his attention, and he was taking it admiringly in his band when Polykarp awoke.  \"That is the image of the goddess of fate--that is a Tyche,\" said Petrus.  \"Do not be angry with me, father,\" entreated Polykarp.  \"You know, the figure of a Tyche is to stand in the hand of the statue of the Caesar that is intended for the new city of Constantine, and so I have tried to represent the goddess.  The drapery and pose of the arms, I think, have succeeded, but I failed in the head.\"  Petrus, who had listened to him with attention, glanced involuntarily at the head of Sirona, and Polykarp followed his eyes surprised and almost startled.  The father and son had understood each other, and Polykarp said, \"I had already thought of that.\"  Then he sighed bitterly, and said to himself, \"Yes and verily, she is the goddess of my fate.\"  But he dared not utter this aloud.  But Petrus had heard him sigh, and said, \"Let that pass.  This head smiles with sweet fascination, and the countenance of the goddess that rules the actions even of the immortals, should be stern and grave.\"  Polykarp could contain himself no longer.  \"Yes, father,\" he exclaimed.  \"Fate is terrible--and yet I will represent the goddess with a smiling mouth, for that which is most terrible in her is, that she rules not by stern laws, but smiles while she makes us her sport.\"     CHAPTER XV.  It was a splendid morning; not a cloud dimmed the sky which spread high above desert, mountain, and oasis, like an arched tent of uniform deep- blue silk.  How delicious it is to breathe the pure, light, aromatic air on the heights, before the rays of the sun acquire their mid-day power, and the shadows of the heated porphyry cliffs, growing shorter and shorter, at last wholly disappear!  With what delight did Sirona inhale this pure atmosphere, when after a long night--the fourth that she had passed in the anchorite's dismal cave-she stepped out into the air.  Paulus sat by the hearth, and was so busily engaged with some carving, that he did not observe her approach.  \"Kind good man!\"  thought Sirona, as she perceived a steaming pot on the fire, and the palm-branches which the Alexandrian had fastened up by the entrance to the cave, to screen her from the mounting sun.  She knew the way without a guide to the spring from which Paulus had brought her water at their first meeting, and she now slipped away, and went down to it with a pretty little pitcher of burnt clay in her hand.  Paulus did indeed see her, but he made as though he neither, saw nor heard, for he knew she was going there to wash herself, and to dress and smarten herself as well as might be--for was she not a woman!  When she returned, she looked not less fresh and charming than on that morning when she had been seen and watched by Hermas.  True, her heart was sore, true, she was perplexed and miserable, but sleep and rest had long since effaced from her healthy, youthful, and elastic frame all traces left by that fearful day of flight; and fate, which often means best by us when it shows us a hostile face, had sent her a minor anxiety to divert her from her graver cares.  Her greyhound was very ill, and it seemed that in the ill-treatment it had experienced, not only its leg had been broken, but that it had suffered some internal injury.  The brisk, lively little creature fell down powerless when ever it tried to stand, and when she took it up to nurse it comfortably in her lap, it whined pitifully, and looked up at her sorrowfully, and as if complaining to her.  It would take neither food nor drink; its cool little nose was hot; and when she left the cave, Iambe lay panting on the fine woollen coverlet which Paulus had spread upon the bed, unable even to look after her.  Before taking the dog the water she had fetched in the graceful jar-- which was another gift from her hospitable friend--she went up to Paulus and greeted him kindly.  He looked up from his work, thanked her, and a few minutes later, when she came out of the cave again, asked her, \"How is the poor little creature?\"  Sirona shrugged her shoulders, and said sadly, \"She has drunk nothing, and does not even know me, and pants as rapidly as last evening--if I were to lose the poor little beast!--\"  She could say no more for emotion, but Paulus shook his head.  \"It is sinful,\" he said, \"to grieve so for a beast devoid of reason.\"  \"Iambe is not devoid of reason,\" replied Sirona.  \"And even if she were, what have I left if she dies?  She grew up in my father's house, where all loved me; I had her first when she was only a few days old, and I brought her up on milk on a little bit of sponge.  Many a time, when I heard the little thing whining for food, have I got out of bed at night with bare feet; and so she came to cling to me like a child, and could not do without me.  No one can know how another feels about such things. My father used to tell us of a spider that beautified the life of a prisoner, and what is a dirty dumb creature like that to my clever, graceful little dog!  I have lost my home, and here every one believes the worst of me, although I have done no one any harm, and no one, no one loves me but Iambe.\"  \"But I know of one who loves every one with a divine and equal love,\" interrupted Paulus.  \"I do not care for such a one,\" answered Sirona.  \"Iambe follows no one but me; what good can a love do me that I must share with all the world! But you mean the crucified God of the Christians?  He is good and pitiful, so says Dame Dorothea; but he is dead--I cannot see him, nor hear him, and, certainly, I cannot long for one who only shows me grace. I want one to whom I can count for something, and to whose life and happiness I am indispensable.\"  A scarcely perceptible shudder thrilled through the Alexandrian as she spoke these words, and he thought, as he glanced at her face and figure with a mingled expression of regret and admiration, \"Satan, before he fell, was the fairest among the pure spirits, and he still has power over this woman.  She is still far from being ripe for salvation, and yet she has a gentle heart, and even if she has erred, she is not lost.\"  Sirona's eyes had met his, and she said with a sigh, \"You look at me so compassionately--if only Iambe were well, and if I succeeded in reaching Alexandria, my destiny would perhaps take a turn for the better.\"  Paulus had risen while she spoke, and had taken the pot from the hearth; he now offered it to his guest, saying:  \"For the present we will trust to this broth to compensate to you for the delights of the capital; I am glad that you relish it.  But tell me now, have you seriously considered what danger may threaten a beautiful, young, and unprotected woman in the wicked city of the Greeks?  Would it not be better that you should submit to the consequences of your guilt, and return to Phoebicius, to whom unfortunately you belong?\"  Sirona, at these words, had set down the vessel out of which she was eating, and rising in passionate haste, she exclaimed:  \"That shall never, never be!--And when I was sitting up there half-dead, and took your step for that of Phoebicius, the gods showed me a way to escape from him, and from you or anyone who would drag me back to him. When I fled to the edge of the abyss, I was raving and crazed, but what I then would have done in my madness, I would do now in cold blood--as surely as I hope to see my own people in Arelas once more!  What was I once, and to what have I come through Phoebicius!  Life was to me a sunny garden with golden trellises and shady trees and waters as bright as crystal, with rosy flowers and singing birds; and he, he has darkened its light, and fouled its springs, and broken down its flowers.  All now seems dumb and colorless, and if the abyss is my grave, no one will miss me nor mourn for me.\"  \"Poor woman!\"  said Paulus.  \"Your husband then showed you very little love.\"  \"Love,\" laughed Sirona, \"Phoebicius and love!  Only yesterday I told you, how cruelly he used to torture me after his feasts, when he was drunk or when he recovered from one of his swoons.  But one thing he did to me, one thing which broke the last thread of a tie between us.  No one yet has ever heard a word of it from me; not even Dorothea, who often blamed me when I let slip a hard word against my husband.  It was well for her to talk--if I had found a husband like Petrus I might perhaps have been like Dorothea.  It is a marvel, which I myself do not understand, that I did not grow wicked with such a man, a man who--why should I conceal it-- who, when we were at Rome, because he was in debt, and because he hoped to get promotion through his legate Quintillus, sold me--me--to him.  He himself brought the old man--who had often followed me about--into his house, but our hostess, a good woman, had overheard the matter, and betrayed it all to me.  It is so base, so vile--it seems to blacken my soul only to think of it!  The legate got little enough in return for his sesterces, but Phoebicius did not restore his wages of sin, and his rage against me knew no bounds when he was transferred to the oasis at the instigation of his betrayed chief.  Now you know all, and never advise me again to return to that man to whom my misfortune has bound me.  \"Only listen how the poor little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5497"],["title","Homo Sum â€” Volume 04 (#4)"],["body","in there is whining.  It wants to come to me, and has not the strength to move.\"  Paulus looked after her sympathetically as she disappeared under the opening in the rock, and he awaited her return with folded arms.  He could not see into the cave, for the space in which the bed stood was closed at the end by the narrow passage which formed the entrance, and which joined it at an angle as the handle of a scythe joins the blade. She remained a long time, and he could hear now and then a tender word with which she tried to comfort the suffering creature.  Suddenly he was startled by a loud and bitter cry from Sirona; no doubt, the poor woman's affectionate little companion was dead, and in the dim twilight of the cave she had seen its dulled eye, and felt the stiffness of death overspreading and paralyzing its slender limbs.  He dared not go into the cavern, but he felt his eyes fill with tears, and he would willingly have spoken some word of consolation to her.  At last she came out, her eyes red with weeping.  Paulus had guessed rightly for she held the body of little Iambe in her arms.  \"How sorry I am,\" said Paulus, \"the poor little creature was so pretty.\"  Sirona nodded, sat down, and unfastened the prettily embroidered band from the dog's neck, saying half to herself, and half to Paulus, \"My little Agnes worked this collar.  I myself had taught her to sew, and this was the first piece of work that was all her own.\"  She held the collar up to the anchorite.  \"This clasp is of real silver,\" she went on, \"and my father himself gave it to me.  He was fond of the poor little dog too.  Now it will never leap and spring again, poor thing.\"  She looked sadly down at the dead dog.  Then she collected herself, and said hurriedly, \"Now I will go away from here.  Nothing--nothing keeps me any longer in this wilderness, for the senator's house, where I have spent many happy hours, and where everyone was fond of me, is closed against me, and must ever be so long as he lives there.  If you have not been kind to me only to do me harm in the end, let me go today, and help me to reach Alexandria.\"  \"Not to-day, in any case not to-day,\" replied Paulus.  \"First I must find out when a vessel sails for Klysma or for Berenike, and then I have many other things to see to for you.  You owe me an answer to my question, as to what you expect to do and to find in Alexandria.  Poor child--the younger and the fairer you are--\"  \"I know all you would say to me,\" interrupted Sirona.  \"Wherever I have been, I have attracted the eyes of men, and when I have read in their looks that I pleased them, it has greatly pleased me--why should I deny it?  Many a one has spoken fair words to me or given me flowers, and sent old women to my house to win me for them, but even if one has happened to please me better than another, still I have never found it hard to send them home again as was fitting.\"  \"Till Hermas laid his love at your feet,\" said Paulus.  \"He is a bold lad--\"  \"A pretty, inexperienced boy,\" said Sirona, \"neither more nor less.  It was a heedless thing, no doubt, to admit him to my rooms, but no vestal need be ashamed to own to such favor as I showed him.  I am innocent, and I will remain so that I may stand in my father's presence without a blush when I have earned money enough in the capital for the long journey.\"  Paulus looked in her face astonished and almost horrified.  Then he had in fact taken on himself guilt which did not exist, and perhaps the senator would have been slower to condemn Sirona, if it had not been for his falsely acknowledging it.  He stood before her, feeling like a child that would fain put together some object of artistic workmanship, and who has broken it to pieces for want of skill.  At the same time he could not doubt a word that she said, for the voice within him had long since plainly told him that this woman was no common criminal.  For some time he was at a loss for words; at last he said timidly:  \"What do you purpose doing in Alexandria?\"  \"Polykarp says, that all good work finds a purchaser there,\" she answered.  \"And I can weave particularly well, and embroider with gold- thread.  Perhaps I may find shelter under some roof where there are children, and I would willingly attend to them during the day.  In my free time and at night I could work at my frame, and when I have scraped enough together I shall soon find a ship that will carry me to Gaul, to my own people.  Do you not see that I cannot go back to Phoebicius, and can you help me?\"  \"Most willingly, and better perhaps than you fancy,\" said Paulus.  \"I cannot explain this to you just now; but you need not request me, but may rather feel that you have a good right to demand of me that I should rescue you.\"  She looked at him in surprised enquiry, and he continued:  \"First let me carry away the little dog, and bury it down there.  I will put a stone over the grave, that you may know where it lies.  It must be so, the body cannot be here any longer.  Take the thing, which lies there.  I had tried before to cut it out for you, for you complained yesterday that your hair was all in a tangle because you had not a comb, so I tried to carve you one out of bone.  There were none at the shop in the oasis, and I am myself only a wild creature of the wilderness, a sorry, foolish animal, and do not use one.  \"Was that a stone that fell?  Aye, certainly, I hear a man's step; go quickly into the cave and do not stir till I call you.\"  Sirona withdrew into her rock-dwelling, and Paulus took the body of the dog in his arms to conceal it from the man who was approaching.  He looked round, undecided, and seeking a hiding-place for it, but two sharp eyes had already detected him and his small burden from the height above him; before he had found a suitable place, stones were rolling and crashing down from the cliff to the right of the cavern, and at the same time a man came springing down with rash boldness from rock to rock, and without heeding the warning voice of the anchorite, flung himself down the slope, straight in front of him, exclaiming, while he struggled for breath and his face was hot with hatred and excitement:  \"That--I know it well-that is Sirona's greyhound--where is its mistress? Tell me this instant, where is Sirona--I must and will know.\"  Paulus had frequently seen, from the penitent's room in the church, the senator and his family in their places near the altar, and he was much astonished to recognize in the daring leaper, who rushed upon him like a mad man with dishevelled hair and fiery eyes, Polykarp, Petrus' second son.  The anchorite found it difficult to preserve his calm, and composed demeanor, for since he had been aware that he had accused Sirona falsely of a heavy sin, while at the same time he had equally falsely confessed himself the partner of her misdeed, he felt an anxiety that amounted to anguish, and a leaden oppression checked the rapidity of his thoughts. He at first stammered out a few unintelligible words, but his opponent was in fearful earnest with his question; he seized the collar of the anchorite's coarse garment with terrible violence, and cried in a husky voice, \"Where did you find the dog?  Where is--?\"  But suddenly he left go his hold of the Alexandrian, looked at him from head to foot, and said softly and slowly:  \"Can it be possible?  Are you Paulus, the Alexandrian?\"  The anchorite nodded assent.  Polykarp laughed loud and bitterly, pressed his hand to his forehead, and exclaimed in a tone of the deepest disgust and contempt:  \"And is it so, indeed!  and such a repulsive ape too!  But I will not believe that she even held out a hand to you, for the mere sight of you makes me dirty.\"  Paulus felt his heart beating like a hammer within his breast; and there was a singing and roaring in his ears.  When once more Polykarp threatened him with his fist he involuntarily took the posture of an athlete in a wrestling match, he stretched out his arms to try to get a good hold of his adversary, and said in a hollow, deep tone of angry warning, \"Stand back, or something will happen to you that will not be good for your bones.\"  The speaker was indeed Paulus--and yet--not Paulus; it was Menander, the pride of the Palaestra, who had never let pass a word of his comrades that did not altogether please him.  And yet yesterday in the oasis he had quietly submitted to far worse insults than Polykarp had offered him, and had accepted them with contented cheerfulness.  Whence then to-day this wild sensitiveness and eager desire to fight?  When, two days since, he had gone to his old cave to fetch the last of his hidden gold pieces, he had wished to greet old Stephanus, but the Egyptian attendant had scared him off like an evil spirit with angry curses, and had thrown stones after him.  In the oasis he had attempted to enter the church in spite of the bishop's prohibition, there to put up a prayer; for he thought that the antechamber, where the spring was and in which penitents were wont to tarry, would certainly not be closed even to him; but the acolytes had driven him away with abusive words, and the door-keeper, who a short time since had trusted him with the key, spit in his face, and yet he had not found it difficult to turn his back on his persecutors without anger or complaint.  At the counter of the dealer of whom he had bought the woollen coverlet, the little jug, and many other things for Sirona, a priest had passed by, had pointed to his money, and had said, \"Satan takes care of his own.\"  Paulus had answered him nothing, had returned to his charge with an uplifted and grateful heart, and had heartily rejoiced once more in the exalted and encouraging consciousness that he was enduring disgrace and suffering for another in humble imitation of Christ.  What was it then that made him so acutely sensitive with regard to Polykarp, and once more snapped those threads, which long years of self-denial had twined"]]]
