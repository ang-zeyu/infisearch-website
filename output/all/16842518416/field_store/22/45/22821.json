But to Paulus and in his present mood he found courage to speak out.  \"I have sure hope of Paradise,\" he said, \"but it will be first opened to us after death.  The Christian should be patient; why can you not wait for Heaven till the Saviour calls you, instead of desiring to enjoy its pleasures here on earth?  This first and that after!  Why Should God have bestowed on us the gifts of the flesh if not that we may use them? Beauty and strength are not empty trifles, and none but a fool gives noble gifts to another, only in order to throw them away.\"  Paulus gazed in astonishment at the youth, who up to this moment had always unresistingly obeyed his father and him, and he shook his head as he answered,  \"So think the children of this world who stand far from the Most High. In the image of God are we made no doubt, but what child would kiss the image of his father, when the father offers him his own living lips?\"  Paulus had meant to say 'mother' instead of 'father,' but he remembered in time that Hermas had early lost the happiness of caressing a mother, and he had hastily amended the phrase.  He was one of those to whom it is so painful to hurt another, that they never touch a wounded soul unless to heal it, divining the seat of even the most hidden pain.  He was accustomed to speak but little, but now he went on eagerly:  \"By so much as God is far above our miserable selves, by so much is the contemplation of Him worthier of the Christian than that of his own person.  Oh! who is indeed so happy as to have wholly lost that self and to be perfectly absorbed in God!  But it pursues us, and when the soul fondly thinks itself already blended in union with the Most High it cries out 'Here am I!' and drags our nobler part down again into the dust.  It is bad enough that we must hinder the flight of the soul, and are forced to nourish and strengthen the perishable part of our being with bread and water and slothful sleep to the injury of the immortal part, however much we may fast and watch.  And shall we indulge the flesh, to the detriment of the spirit, by granting it any of its demands that can easily be denied?  Only he who despises and sacrifices his wretched self can, when he has lost his baser self by the Redeemer's grace, find himself again in God.\"  Hermas had listened patiently to the anchorite, but he now shook his head, and said: \"I cannot under stand either you or my father.  So long as I walk on this earth, I am I and no other.  After death, no doubt, but not till then, will a new and eternal life begin\"  \"Not so,\" cried Paulus hastily, interrupting him.  \"That other and higher life of which you speak, does not begin only after death for him who while still living does not cease from dying, from mortifying the flesh, and from subduing its lusts, from casting from him the world and his baser self, and from seeking the Lord.  It has been vouchsafed to many even in the midst of life to be born again to a higher existence.  Look at me, the basest of the base.  I am not two but one, and yet am I in the sight of the Lord as certainly another man than I was before grace found me, as this young shoot, which has grown from the roots of an overthrown palmtree is another tree than the rotten trunk.  I was a heathen and enjoyed every pleasure of the earth to the utmost; then I became a Christian; the grace of the Lord fell upon me, and I was born again, and became a child again; but this time--the Redeemer be praised!--the child of the Lord.  In the midst of life I died, I rose again, I found the joys of Heaven.  I had been Menander, and like unto Saul, I became Paulus. All that Menander loved--baths, feasts, theatres, horses and chariots, games in the arena, anointed limbs, roses and garlands, purple-garments, wine and the love of women--lie behind me like some foul bog out of which a traveller has struggled with difficulty.  Not a vein of the old man survives in the new, and a new life has begun for me, mid-way to the grave; nor for me only, but for all pious men.  For you too the hour will sound, in which you will die to--\"  \"If only I, like you, had been a Menander,\" cried Hermas, sharply interrupting the speaker: \"How is it possible to cast away that which I never possessed?  In order to die one first must live.  This wretched life seems to me contemptible, and I am weary of running after you like a calf after a cow.  I am free-born, and of noble race, my father himself has told me so, and I am certainly no feebler in body than the citizens' sons in the town with whom I went from the baths to the wrestling- school.\"  \"Did you go to the Palaestra?\" asked Paulus in surprise.  \"To the wrestling-school of Timagetus,\" cried Hermas, coloring.  \"From outside the gate I watched the games of the youths as they wrestled, and threw heavy disks at a mark.  My eyes almost sprang out of my head at the sight, and I could have cried out aloud with envy and vexation, at having to stand there in my ragged sheep-skin excluded from all competition.  If Pachomius had not just then come up, by the Lord I must have sprung into the arena, and have challenged the strongest of them all to wrestle with me, and I could have thrown the disk much farther than the scented puppy who won the victory and was crowned.\"  \"You may thank, Pachomius,\" said Paulus laughing, \"for having hindered you, for you would have earned nothing in the arena but mockery and disgrace.  You are strong enough, certainly, but the art of the discobolus must be learned like any other.  Hercules himself would be beaten at that game without practice, and if he did not know the right way to handle the disk.\"  \"It would not have been the first time I had thrown one,\" cried the boy. \"See, what I can do!\"  With these words he stooped and raised one of the flat stones, which lay piled up to secure the pathway; extending his arm with all his strength, he flung the granite disk over the precipice away into the abyss.  \"There, you see,\" cried Paulus, who had watched the throw carefully and not without some anxious excitement.  \"However strong your arm may be, any novice could throw farther than you if only he knew the art of holding the discus.  It is not so--not so; it must cut through the air like a knife with its sharp edge.  Look how you hold your hand, you throw like a woman!  The wrist straight, and now your left foot behind, and your knee bent! see, how clumsy you are!  Here, give me the stone.  You take the discus so, then you bend your body, and press down your knees like the arc of a bow, so that every sinew in your body helps to speed the shot when you let go.  Aye--that is better, but it is not quite right yet.  First heave the discus with your arm stretched out, then fix your eye on the mark; now swing it out high behind you--stop! once more! your arm must be more strongly strained before you throw.  That might pass, but you ought to be able to hit the palm-tree yonder.  Give me your discus, and that stone.  There; the unequal corners hinder its flight-- now pay attention!\"  Paulus spoke with growing eagerness, and now he grasped the flat stone, as he might have done many years since when no youth in Alexandria had been his match in throwing the discus.  He bent his knees, stretched out his body, gave play to his wrist, extended his arm to the utmost and hurled the stone into space, while the clenched toes of his right foot deeply dinted the soil.  But it fell to the ground before reaching which Paulus had indicated as the mark.  \"Wait!\" cried Hermas.  \"Let me try now to hit the tree.\"  His stone whistled through the air, but it did not even reach the mound, into which the palm-tree had struck root.  Paulus shook his head disapprovingly, and in his, turn seized a flat stone; and now an eager contest began.  At every throw Hermas' stone flew farther, for he copied his teacher's action and grasp with increasing skill, while the older man's arm began to tire.  At last Hermas for the second time hit the palm-tree, while Paulus had failed to reach even the mound with his last fling.  The pleasure of the contest took stronger possession of the anchorite; he flung his raiment from him, and seizing another stone he cried out-- as though he were standing once more in the wrestling school among his old companions; all shining with their anointment.  \"By the silver-bowed Apollo, and the arrow-speeding Artemis, I will hit the palm-tree.\"  The missile sang through the air, his body sprang back, and he stretched out his left arm to save his tottering balance; there was a crash, the tree quivered under the blow, and Hermas shouted joyfully:  \"Wonderful! wonderful! that was indeed a throw.  The old Menander is not dead! Farewell--to-morrow we will try again.\"  With these words Hermas quitted the anchorite, and hastened with wide leaps down the hill in the oasis.  Paulus started at the words like a sleep-walker who is suddenly wakened by hearing his name called.  He looked about him in bewilderment, as if he had to find his way in some strange world.  Drops of sweat stood on his brow, and with sudden shame he snatched up his garments that were lying on the ground, and covered his naked limbs.  For some time he stood gazing after Hermas, then he clasped his brow in deep anguish and large tears ran down upon his beard.  \"What have I said?\"  he muttered to himself; \"That every vein of the old man in me was extirpated?  Fool! vain madman that I am.  They named me Paulus, and I am in truth Saul, aye, and worse than Saul!\"  With these words he threw himself on his knees, pressing his forehead against the hard rock, and began to pray.  He felt as if he had been flung from a height on to spears and lances, as if his heart and soul were bleeding, and while he remained there, dissolved in grief and prayer, accusing and condemning himself, he felt not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5494"],["title","Homo Sum â€” Volume 01 (#5)"],["body","burning of the sun as it mounted in the sky, heeded not the flight of time, nor heard the approach of a party of pilgrims, who, under the guidance of bishop Agapitus, were visiting the Holy Places.  The palmers saw him at prayer, heard his sobs, and, marvelling at his piety, at a sign from their pastor they knelt down behind him.  When Paulus at last arose, he perceived with surprise and alarm the witnesses of his devotions, and approached Agapitus to kiss his robe. But the bishop said: \"Not so; he that is most pious is the greatest among us.  My friends, let us bow down before this saintly man!\"  The pilgrims obeyed his command.  Paulus hid his face in his hands and sobbed out: \"Wretch, wretch that I am!\"  And the pilgrims lauded his humility, and followed their leader who left the spot.     CHAPTER III.  Hermas had hastened onwards without delay.  He had already reached the last bend of the path he had followed down the ravine, and he saw at his feet the long narrow valley and the gleaming waters of the stream, which here fertilized the soil of the desert.  He looked down on lofty palms and tamarisk shrubs innumerable, among which rose the houses of the inhabitants, surrounded by their little gardens and small carefully- irrigated fields; already he could hear the crowing of a cock and the hospitable barking of a dog, sounds which came to him like a welcome from the midst of that life for which he yearned, accustomed as he was to be surrounded day and night by the deep and lonely stillness of the rocky heights.  He stayed his steps, and his eyes followed the thin columns of smoke, which floated tremulously up in the clear light of the ever mounting sun from the numerous hearths that lay below him.  \"They are cooking breakfast now,\" thought he, \"the wives for their husbands, the mothers for their children, and there, where that dark smoke rises, very likely a splendid feast is being prepared for guests; but I am nowhere at home, and no one will invite me in.\"  The contest with Paulus had excited and cheered him, but the sight of the city filled his young heart with renewed bitterness, and his lips trembled as he looked down on his sheepskin and his unwashed limbs.  With hasty resolve he turned his back on the oasis and hurried up the mountain.  By the side of the brooklet that he knew of he threw off his coarse garment, let the cool water flow over his body, washed himself carefully and with much enjoyment, stroked clown his thick hair with his fingers, and then hurried down again into the valley.  The gorge through which he had descended debouched by a hillock that rose from the valley-plain; a small newly-built church leaned against its eastern declivity, and it was fortified on all sides by walls and dikes, behind which the citizens found shelter when they were threatened by the Saracen robbers of the oasis.  This hill passed for a particularly sacred spot.  Moses was supposed to have prayed on its summit during the battle with the Amalekites while his arms were held up by Aaron and Hur.  But there were other notable spots in the neighborhood of the oasis. There farther to the north was the rock whence Moses had struck the water; there higher up, and more to the south-east, was the hill, where the Lord had spoken to the law-giver face to face, and where he had seen the burning bush; there again was the spring where he had met the daughters of Jethro, Zippora and Ledja, so called in the legend.  Pious pilgrims came to these holy places in great numbers, and among them many natives of the peninsula, particularly Nabateans, who had previously visited the holy mountain in order to sacrifice on its summit to their gods, the sun, moon, and planets.  At the outlet, towards the north, stood a castle, which ever since the Syrian Prefect, Cornelius Palma, had subdued Arabia Petraea in the time of Trajan, had been held by a Roman garrison for the protection of the blooming city of the desert against the incursions of the marauding Saracens and Blemmyes.  But the citizens of Pharan themselves had taken measures for the security of their property.  On the topmost cliffs of the jagged crown of the giant mountain--the most favorable spots for a look-out far and wide-- they placed sentinels, who day and night scanned the distance, so as to give a warning-signal in case of approaching clanger.  Each house resembled a citadel, for it was built of strong masonry, and the younger men were all well exercised bowmen.  The more distinguished families dwelt near the church-hill, and there too stood the houses of the Bishop Agapitus, and of the city councillors of Pharan.  Among these the Senator Petrus enjoyed the greatest respect, partly by reason of his solid abilities, and of his possessions in quarries, garden-ground, date palms, and cattle; partly in consequence of the rare qualities of his wife, the deaconess Dorothea, the granddaughter of the long-deceased and venerable Bishop Chaeremon, who had fled hither with his wife during the persecution of the Christians under Decius, and who had converted many of the Pharanites to the knowledge of the Redeemer.  The house of Petrus was of strong and well-joined stone, and the palm garden adjoining was carefully tended.  Twenty slaves, many camels, and even two horses belonged to him, and the centurion in command of the Imperial garrison, the Gaul Phoebicius, and his wife Sirona, lived as lodgers under his roof; not quite to the satisfaction of the councillor, for the centurion was no Christian, but a worshipper of Mithras, in whose mysteries the wild Gaul had risen to the grade of a 'Lion,' whence his people, and with them the Pharanites in general, were wont to speak of him as \"the Lion.\"  His predecessor had been an officer of much lower rank but a believing Christian, whom Petrus had himself requested to live in his house, and when, about a year since, the Lion Phoebicius had taken the place of the pious Pankratius, the senator could not refuse him the quarters, which had become a right.  Hermas went shyly and timidly towards the court of Petrus' house, and his embarrassment increased when he found himself in the hall of the stately stone-house, which he had entered without let or hindrance, and did not know which way to turn.  There was no one there to direct him, and he dared not go up the stairs which led to the upper story, although it seemed that Petrus must be there.  Yes, there was no doubt, for he heard talking overhead and clearly distinguished the senator's deep voice. Hermas advanced, and set his foot on the first step of the stairs; but he had scarcely begun to go up with some decision, and feeling ashamed of his bashfulness, when he heard a door fly open just above him, and from it there poured a flood of fresh laughing children's voices, like a pent up stream when the miller opens the sluice gate.  He glanced upwards in surprise, but there was no time for consideration, for the shouting troop of released little ones had already reached the stairs.  In front of all hastened a beautiful young woman with golden hair; she was laughing gaily, and held a gaudily-dressed doll high above her head.  She came backwards towards the steps, turning her fair face beaming with fun and delight towards the children, who, full of their longing, half demanding, half begging, half laughing, half crying, shouted in confusion, \"Let us be, Sirona,\"  \"Do not take it away again, Sirona,\"  \"Do stay here, Sirona,\" again and again, \"Sirona--Sirona.\"  A lovely six year old maiden stretched up as far as she could to reach the round white arm that held the play-thing; with her left hand, which was free, she gaily pushed away three smaller children, who tried to cling to her knees and exclaimed, still stepping backwards, \"No, no; you shall not have it till it has a new gown; it shall be as long and as gay as the Emperors's robe.  Let me go, Caecilia, or you will fall down as naughty Nikon did the other day.\"  By this time she had reached the steps; she turned suddenly, and with outstretched arms she stopped the way of the narrow stair on which Hermas was standing, gazing open-mouthed at the merry scene above his head. Just as Sirona was preparing to run down, she perceived him and started; but when she saw that the anchorite from pure embarrassment could find no words in which to answer her question as to what he wanted, she laughed heartily again and called out: \"Come up, we shall not hurt you--shall we children?\"  Meanwhile Hermas had found courage enough to give utterance to his wish to speak with the senator, and the young woman, who looked with complacency on his strong and youthful frame, offered to conduct him to him.  Petrus had been talking to his grown up elder sons; they were tall men, but their father was even taller than they, and of unusual breadth of shoulder.  While the young men were speaking, he stroked his short grey beard and looked down at the ground in sombre gravity, as it might have seemed to the careless observer; but any one who looked closer might quickly perceive that not seldom a pleased smile, though not less often a somewhat bitter one, played upon the lips of the prudent and judicious man.  He was one of those who can play with their children like a young mother, take the sorrows of another as much to heart as if they were their own, and yet who look so gloomy, and allow themselves to make such sharp speeches, that only those who are on terms of perfect confidence with them, cease to misunderstand them and fear them.  There was something fretting the soul of this man, who nevertheless possessed all that could contribute to human happiness.  His was a thankful nature, and yet he was conscious that he might have been destined to something greater than fate had permitted him to achieve or to be.  He had remained a stone-cutter, but his sons had both completed their education in good schools in Alexandria.  The elder, Antonius, who already had a house of his own"]]]
