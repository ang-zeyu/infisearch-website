Two young men were standing on the steps, and one was Clarence Colfax. His hands were in his pockets, and a careless, scornful smile was on his face when he glanced down into the street. Stephen caught that smile. Anger swept over him in a hot flame, as at the slave auction years agone. That was the unquenchable fire of the war. The blood throbbed in his temples as his feet obeyed,--and yet he stopped.  What right had he to pull down that flag, to die on the pavement before that house?     CHAPTER XVII  CAMP JACKSON  What enthusiasm on that gusty Monday morning, the Sixth of May, 1861! Twelfth Street to the north of the Market House is full three hundred feet across, and the militia of the Sovereign State of Missouri is gathering there. Thence by order of her Governor they are to march to Camp Jackson for a week of drill and instruction.  Half a mile nearer the river, on the house of the Minute Men, the strange flag leaps wildly in the wind this day.  On Twelfth Street the sun is shining, drums are beating, and bands are playing, and bright aides dashing hither and thither on spirited chargers. One by one the companies are marching up, and taking place in line; the city companies in natty gray fatigue, the country companies often in their Sunday clothes. But they walk with heads erect and chests out, and the ladies wave their gay parasols and cheer them. Here are the aristocratic St. Louis Grays, Company A; there come the Washington Guards and Washington Blues, and Laclede Guards and Missouri Guards and Davis Guards. Yes, this is Secession Day, this Monday. And the colors are the Stars and Stripes and the Arms of Missouri crossed.  What are they waiting for? Why don't they move? Hark! A clatter and a cloud of dust by the market place, an ecstasy of cheers running in waves the length of the crowd. Make way for the dragoons! Here they come at last, four and four, the horses prancing and dancing and pointing quivering ears at the tossing sea of hats and parasols and ribbons. Maude Catherwood squeezes Virginia's arm. There, riding in front, erect and firm in the saddle, is Captain Clarence Colfax. Virginia is red and white, and red again,--true colors of the Confederacy. How proud she was of him now! How ashamed that she even doubted him! Oh, that was his true calling, a soldier's life. In that moment she saw him at the head of armies, from the South, driving the Yankee hordes northward and still northward until the roar of the lakes warns them of annihilation. She saw his chivalry sparing them. Yes, this is Secession Monday.  Down to a trot they slow, Clarence's black thorough-bred arching his long neck, proud as his master of the squadron which follows, four and four. The square young man of bone and sinew in the first four, whose horse is built like a Crusader's, is George Catherwood. And Eugenie gives a cry and points to the rear where Maurice is riding.  Whose will be the Arsenal now? Can the Yankee regiments with their slouchy Dutchmen hope to capture it! If there are any Yankees in Twelfth Street that day, they are silent. Yes, there are some. And there are some, even in the ranks of this Militia--who will fight for the Union. These are sad indeed.  There is another wait, the companies standing at ease. Some of the dragoons dismount, but not the handsome young captain, who rides straight to the bright group which has caught his eye, Colonel Carvel wrings his gauntleted hand.  \"Clarence, we are proud of you, sir,\" he says.  And Virginia, repeats his words, her eyes sparkling, her fingers caressing the silken curve of Jefferson's neck.  \"Clarence, you will drive Captain Lyon and his Hessians into the river.\"  \"Hush, Jinny,\" he answered, \"we are merely going into camp to learn to drill, that we may be ready to defend the state when the time comes.\"  Virginia laughed. \"I had forgotten,\" she said.  \"You will have your cousin court-martialed, my dear,\" said the Colonel.  Just then the call is sounded. But he must needs press Virginia's hand first, and allow admiring Maude and Eugenie to press his. Then he goes off at a slow canter to join his dragoons, waving his glove at them, and turning to give the sharp order, \"Attention\"! to his squadron.  Virginia is deliriously happy. Once more she has swept from her heart every vestige of doubt. Now is Clarence the man she can admire. Chosen unanimously captain of the Squadron but a few days since, Clarence had taken command like a veteran. George Catherwood and Maurice had told the story.  And now at last the city is to shake off the dust of the North. \"On to Camp Jackson!\" was the cry. The bands are started, the general and staff begin to move, and the column swings into the Olive Street road, followed by a concourse of citizens awheel and afoot, the horse cars crowded. Virginia and Maude and the Colonel in the Carvel carriage, and behind Ned, on the box, is their luncheon in a hamper Standing up, the girls can just see the nodding plumes of the dragoons far to the front.  Olive Street, now paved with hot granite and disfigured by trolley wires, was a country road then. Green trees took the place of crowded rows of houses and stores, and little \"bob-tail\" yellow cars were drawn by plodding mules to an inclosure in a timbered valley, surrounded by a board fence, known as Lindell Grove. It was then a resort, a picnic ground, what is now covered by close residences which have long shown the wear of time.  Into Lindell Grove flocked the crowd, the rich and the poor, the proprietor and the salesmen, to watch the soldiers pitch their tents under the spreading trees. The gallant dragoons were off to the west, across a little stream which trickled through the grounds. By the side of it Virginia and Maude, enchanted, beheld Captain Colfax shouting his orders while his troopers dragged the canvas from the wagons, and staggered under it to the line. Alas! that the girls were there! The Captain lost his temper, his troopers, perspiring over Gordian knots in the ropes, uttered strange soldier oaths, while the mad wind which blew that day played a hundred pranks.  To the discomfiture of the young ladies, Colonel Carvel pulled his goatee and guffawed. Virginia was for moving away.  \"How mean, Pa,\" she said indignantly. \"How car, you expect them to do it right the first day, and in this wind?\"  \"Oh! Jinny, look at Maurice!\" exclaimed Maude, giggling. \"He is pulled over on his head.\"  The Colonel roared. And the gentlemen and ladies who were standing by laughed, too. Virginia did not laugh. It was all too serious for her.  \"You will see that they can fight,\" she said. \"They can beat the Yankees and Dutch.\"  This speech made the Colonel glance around him: Then he smiled,--in response to other smiles.  \"My dear,\" he said, \"you must remember that this is a peaceable camp of instruction of the state militia. There fly the Stars and Stripes from the general's tent. Do you see that they are above the state flag? Jinny; you forget yourself.\"  Jinny stamped her foot  \"Oh, I hate dissimulation,\" she cried, \"Why can't we, say outright that we are going to run that detestable Captain Lyon and his Yankees and Hessians out of the Arsenal.\"  \"Why not, Colonel Carvel?\" cried Maude. She had forgotten that one of her brothers was with the Yankees and Hessians.  \"Why aren't women made generals and governors?\" said the Colonel.  \"If we were,\" answered Virginia, \"something might be accomplished.\"  \"Isn't Clarence enough of a fire-eater to suit you?\" asked her father.  But the tents were pitched, and at that moment the young Captain was seen to hand over his horse to an orderly, and to come toward them. He was followed by George Catherwood.  \"Come, Jinny,\" cried her cousin, \"let us go over to the main camp.\"  \"And walk on Davis Avenue,\" said Virginia, flushing with pride. \"Isn't there a Davis Avenue?\"  \"Yes, and a Lee Avenue, and a Beauregard Avenue,\" said George, taking his sister's arm.  \"We shall walk in them all,\" said Virginia.  What a scene of animation it was. The rustling trees and the young grass of early May, and the two hundred and forty tents in lines of military precision. Up and down the grassy streets flowed the promenade, proud fathers and mothers, and sweethearts and sisters and wives in gala dress. Wear your bright gowns now, you devoted women. The day is coming when you will make them over and over again, or tear them to lint, to stanch the blood of these young men who wear their new gray so well.  Every afternoon Virginia drove with her father and her aunt to Camp Jackson. All the fashion and beauty of the city were there. The bands played, the black coachmen flecked the backs of their shining horses, and walking in the avenues or seated under the trees were natty young gentlemen in white trousers and brass-buttoned jackets. All was not soldier fare at the regimental messes. Cakes and jellies and even ices and more substantial dainties were laid beneath those tents. Dress parade was one long sigh of delight: Better not to have been born than to have been a young man in St. Louis, early in Camp Jackson week, and not be a militiaman.  One young man whom we know, however, had little of pomp and vanity about him,--none other than the young manager (some whispered \"silent partner\") of Carvel & Company. If Mr. Eliphalet had had political ambition, or political leanings, during the half-year which had just passed, he had not shown them. Mr. Cluyme (no mean business man himself) had pronounced Eliphalet a conservative young gentleman who attended to his own affairs and let the mad country take care of itself. This is precisely the wise course Mr. Hopper chose. Seeing a regiment of Missouri Volunteers slouching down Fifth street in citizens' clothes he had been remarked to smile cynically. But he kept his opinions so close that he was supposed not to have any.  On Thursday of Camp Jackson"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5392"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 05 (#2)"],["body","ek, an event occurred in Mr. Carvel's store which excited a buzz of comment. Mr. Hopper announced to Mr. Barbo, the book-keeper, that he should not be there after four o'clock. To be sure, times were more than dull. The Colonel that morning had read over some two dozen letters from Texas and the Southwest, telling of the impossibility of meeting certain obligations in the present state of the country. The Colonel had gone home to dinner with his brow furrowed. On the other hand, Mr. Hopper's equanimity was spoken of at the widow's table.  At four o'clock, Mr. Hopper took an Olive Street car, tucking himself into the far corner where he would not be disturbed by any ladies who might enter. In the course of an hour or so, he alighted at the western gate of the camp on the Olive Street road. Refreshing himself with a little tobacco, he let himself be carried leisurely by the crowd between the rows of tents. A philosophy of his own (which many men before and since have adopted) permitted him to stare with a superior good nature at the open love-making around him. He imagined his own figure,--which was already growing a little stout,--in a light gray jacket and duck trousers, and laughed. Eliphalet was not burdened with illusions of that kind. These heroes might have their hero-worship. Life held something dearer for him.  As he was sauntering toward a deserted seat at the foot of a tree, it so chanced that he was overtaken by Mr. Cluyme and his daughter Belle. Only that morning, this gentleman, in glancing through the real estate column of his newspaper, had fallen upon a deed of sale which made him wink. He reminded his wife that Mr. Hopper had not been to supper of late. So now Mr. Cluyme held out his hand with more than common cordiality. When Mr. Hopper took it, the fingers did not close any too tightly over his own. But it may be well to remark that Mr. Hopper himself did not do any squeezing. He took off his hat grudgingly to Miss Belle. He had never liked the custom.  \"I hope you will take pot luck with us soon again, Mr. Hopper,\" said the elder gentleman. \"We only have plain and simple things, but they are wholesome, sir. Dainties are poor things to work on. I told that to his Royal Highness when he was here last fall. He was speaking to me on the merits of roast beef--\"  \"It's a fine day,\" said Mr. Hopper.  \"So it is,\" Mr. Cluyme assented. Letting his gaze wander over the camp, he added casually, \"I see that they have got a few mortars and howitzers since yesterday. I suppose that is the stuff we heard so much about, which came on the 'Swon' marked 'marble.' They say Jeff Davis sent the stuff to 'em from the Government arsenal the Secesh captured at Baton Rouge. They're pretty near ready to move on our arsenal now.\"  Mr. Hopper listened with composure. He was not greatly interested in this matter which had stirred the city to the quick. Neither had Mr. Cluyme spoken as one who was deeply moved. Just then, as if to spare the pains of a reply, a \"Jenny Lind\" passed them. Miss Belle recognized the carriage immediately as belonging to an elderly lady who was well known in St. Louis. Every day she drove out, dressed in black bombazine, and heavily veiled. But she was blind. As the mother-in-law of the stalwart Union leader of the city, Miss Belle's comment about her appearance in Camp Jackson was not out of place.  \"Well!\" she exclaimed, \"I'd like to know what she's doing here!\"  Mr. Hopper's answer revealed a keenness which, in the course of a few days, engendered in Mr. Cluyme as lusty a respect as he was capable of.  \"I don't know,\" said Eliphalet; \"but I cal'late she's got stouter.\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" Miss Belle demanded.  \"That Union principles must be healthy,\" said he, and laughed.  Miss Cluyme was prevented from following up this enigma. The appearance of two people on Davis Avenue drove the veiled lady from her mind. Eliphalet, too, had seen them. One was the tall young Captain of Dragoons, in cavalry boots, and the other a young lady with dark brown hair, in a lawn dress.  \"Just look at them!\" cried Miss Belle. \"They think they are alone in the garden of Eden. Virginia didn't use to care for him. But since he's a captain, and has got a uniform, she's come round pretty quick. I'm thankful I never had any silly notions about uniforms.\"  She glanced at Eliphalet, to find that his eyes were fixed on the approaching couple.  \"Clarence is handsome, but worthless,\" she continued in her sprightly way. \"I believe Jinny will be fool enough to marry him. Do you think she's so very pretty, Mr. Hopper?\"  Mr. Hopper lied.  \"Neither do I,\" Miss Belle assented. And upon that, greatly to the astonishment of Eliphalet, she left him and ran towards them. \"Virginia!\" she cried; \"Jinny, I have something so interesting to tell you!\"  Virginia turned impatiently. The look she bestowed upon Miss Cluyme was not one of welcome, but Belle was not sensitive. Putting her arm through Virginia's, she sauntered off with the pair toward the parade grounds, Clarence maintaining now a distance of three feet, and not caring to hide his annoyance.  Eliphalet's eyes smouldered, following the three until they were lost in the crowd. That expression of Virginia's had reminded him of a time, years gone, when she had come into the store on her return from Kentucky, and had ordered him to tell her father of her arrival. He had smarted then. And Eliphalet was not the sort to get over smarts.  \"A beautiful young lady,\" remarked Mr. Cluyme. \"And a deserving one, Mr. Hopper. Now, she is my notion of quality. She has wealth, and manners, and looks. And her father is a good man. Too bad he holds such views on secession. I have always thought, sir, that you were singularly fortunate in your connection with him.\"  There was a point of light now in each of Mr. Hopper's green eyes. But Mr. Cluyme continued:  \"What a pity, I say, that he should run the risk of crippling himself by his opinions. Times are getting hard.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Hopper.  \"And southwestern notes are not worth the paper they are written on--\"  But Mr. Cluyme has misjudged his man. If he had come to Eliphalet for information of Colonel Carvel's affairs, or of any one else's affairs, he was not likely to get it. It is not meet to repeat here the long business conversation which followed. Suffice it to say that Mr. Cluyme, who was in dry goods himself, was as ignorant when he left Eliphalet as when he met him. But he had a greater respect than ever for the shrewdness of the business manager of Carvel & Company.            .........................  That same Thursday, when the first families of the city were whispering jubilantly in each other's ears of the safe arrival of the artillery and stands of arms at Camp Jackson, something of significance was happening within the green inclosure of the walls of the United States arsenal, far to the southward.  The days had become alike in sadness to Stephen. Richter gone, and the Judge often away in mysterious conference, he was left for hours at a spell the sole tenant of the office. Fortunately there was work of Richter's and of Mr. Whipple's left undone that kept him busy. This Thursday morning, however, he found the Judge getting into that best black coat which he wore on occasions. His manner had recently lost much of its gruffness.  \"Stephen,\" said he, \"they are serving out cartridges and uniforms to the regiments at the arsenal. Would you like to go down with me?\"  \"Does that mean Camp Jackson?\" asked Stephen, when they had reached the street.  \"Captain Lyon is not the man to sit still and let the Governor take the first trick, sir,\" said the Judge.  As they got on the Fifth Street car, Stephen's attention was at once attracted to a gentleman who sat in a corner, with his children about him. He was lean, and he had a face of great keenness and animation. He had no sooner spied Judge Whipple than he beckoned to him with a kind of military abruptness.  \"That is Major William T. Sherman,\" said the Judge to Stephen. \"He used to be in the army, and fought in the Mexican War. He came here two months ago to be the President of this Fifth Street car line.\"  They crossed over to him, the Judge introducing Stephen to Major Sherman, who looked at him very hard, and then decided to bestow on him a vigorous nod.  \"Well, Whipple,\" he said, \"this nation is going to the devil; eh?\"  Stephen could not resist a smile. For it was a bold man who expressed radical opinions (provided they were not Southern opinions) in a St. Louis street car early in '61.  The Judge shook his head. \"We may pull out,\" he said.  \"Pull out!\" exclaimed Mr. Sherman. \"Who's man enough in Washington to shake his fist in a rebel's face? Our leniency--our timidity--has paralyzed us, sir.\"  By this time those in the car began to manifest considerable interest in the conversation. Major Sherman paid them no attention, and the Judge, once launched in an argument, forgot his surroundings.  \"I have faith in Mr. Lincoln. He is calling out volunteers.\"  \"Seventy-five thousand for three months!\" said the Major, vehemently, \"a bucketful on a conflagration I tell you, Whipple, we'll need all the water we've got in the North.\"  The Judge expressed his belief in this, and also that Mr. Lincoln would draw all the water before he got through.  \"Upon my soul,\" said Mr. Sherman, \"I'm disgusted. Now's the time to stop 'em. The longer we let 'em rear and kick, the harder to break 'em. You don't catch me going back to the army for three months. If they want me, they've got to guarantee me three years. That's more like it.\" Turning to Stephen, he added: \"Don't you sign any three months' contract, young man.\"  Stephen grew red. By this time the car was full, and silent. No one had offered to quarrel with the Major. Nor did it seem likely that any one would.  \"I'm afraid I can't go, sir.\"  \"Why not?\" demanded Mr. Sherman.  \"Because, sir,\" said the Judge, bluntly, \"his mother's a widow, and"]]]
