Eulaeus may be informed that, on the contrary, everything I learned from that singular man in the Serapeum bore reference to the things of the past.\"  \"But how can it be possible,\" said Eulaeus, \"that any one to whom Cleopatra had offered her society should think so long of anything else than the beautiful present?\"  \"You indeed have good reason,\" retorted Publius quickly, \"to enter the lists in behalf of the present, and never willingly to recall the past.\"  \"It was full of anxiety and care,\" replied Eulaeus with perfect self- possession.  \"That my sovereign lady must know from her illustrious mother, and from her own experience; and she will also protect me from the undeserved hatred with which certain powerful enemies seem minded to pursue me.  Permit me, your majesty, not to make my appearance at the banquet until later.  This noble gentleman kept me waiting for hours in the Serapeum, and the proposals concerning the new building in the temple of Isis at Philae must be drawn up and engrossed to-day, in order that they may be brought to-morrow before your royal husband in council and your illustrious brother Euergetes--\"  \"You have leave, interrupted Cleopatra.\"  As soon as Eulaeus had disappeared, the queen went closer up to Publius, and said:  \"You are annoyed with this man--well, he is not pleasant, but at any rate he is useful and worthy.  May I ask whether you only feel his personality repugnant to you, or whether actual circumstances have given rise to your aversion--nay, if I have judged rightly, to a very bitterly hostile feeling against him?\"  \"Both,\" replied Publius.  \"In this unmanly man, from the very first, I expected to find nothing good, and I now know that, if I erred at all, it was in his favor.  To-morrow I will ask you to spare me an hour when I can communicate to your majesty something concerning him, but which is too repulsive and sad to be suitable for telling in an evening devoted to enjoyment.  You need not be inquisitive, for they are matters that belong to the past, and which concern neither you nor me.\"  The high-steward and the cup-bearer here interrupted this conversation by calling them to table, and the royal pair were soon reclining with their guests at the festal board.  Oriental splendor and Greek elegance were combined in the decorations of the saloon of moderate size, in which Ptolemy Philometor was wont to prefer to hold high-festival with a few chosen friends.  Like the great reception-hall and the men's hall-with its twenty doors and lofty porphyry columns--in which the king's guests assembled, it was lighted from above, since it was only at the sides that the walls--which had no windows--and a row of graceful alabaster columns with Corinthian acanthus-capitals supported a narrow roof; the centre of the hall was quite uncovered.  At this hour, when it was blazing with hundreds of lights, the large opening, which by day admitted the bright sunshine, was closed over by a gold net-work, decorated with stars and a crescent moon of rock-crystal, and the meshes were close enough to exclude the bats and moths which at night always fly to the light.  But the illumination of the king's banqueting-hall made it almost as light as day, consisting of numerous lamps with many branches held up by lovely little figures of children in bronze and marble.  Every joint was plainly visible in the mosaic of the pavement, which represented the reception of Heracles into Olympus, the feast of the gods, and the astonishment of the amazed hero at the splendor of the celestial banquet; and hundreds of torches were reflected in the walls of polished yellow marble, brought from Hippo Regius; these were inlaid by skilled artists with costly stones, such as lapis lazuli and malachite, crystals, blood-stone, jasper, agates and chalcedony, to represent fruit-pieces and magnificent groups of game or of musical instruments; while the pilasters were decorated with masks of the tragic and comic Muses, torches, thyrsi wreathed with ivy and vine, and pan-pipes.  These were wrought in silver and gold, and set with costly marbles, and they stood out from the marble background like metal work on a leather shield, or the rich ornamentation on a sword-sheath. The figures of a Dionysiac procession, forming the frieze, looked down upon the feasters--a fine relievo that had been designed and modelled for Ptolemy Soter by the sculptor Bryaxis, and then executed in ivory and gold.  Everything that met the eye in this hall was splendid, costly, and above all of a genial aspect, even before Cleopatra had come to the throne; and she--here as in her own apartments--had added the busts of the greatest Greek philosophers and poets, from Thales of Miletus down to Strato, who raised chance to fill the throne of God, and from Hesiod to Callimachus; she too had placed the tragic mask side by side with the comic, for at her table--she was wont to say--she desired to see no one who could not enjoy grave and wise discourse more than eating, drinking, and laughter.  Instead of assisting at the banquet, as other ladies used, seated on a chair or at the foot of her husband's couch, she reclined on a couch of her own, behind which stood busts of Sappho the poetess, and Aspasia the friend of Pericles.  Though she made no pretensions to be regarded as a philosopher nor even as a poetess, she asserted her right to be considered a finished connoisseur in the arts of poetry and music; and if she preferred reclining to sitting how should she have done otherwise, since she was fully aware how well it became her to extend herself in a picturesque attitude on her cushions, and to support her head on her arm as it rested on the back of her couch; for that arm, though not strictly speaking beautiful, always displayed the finest specimens of Alexandrian workmanship in gem-cutting and goldsmiths' work.  But, in fact, she selected a reclining posture particularly for the sake of showing her feet; not a woman in Egypt or Greece had a smaller or more finely formed foot than she.  For this reason her sandals were so made that when she stood or walked they protected only the soles of her feet, and her slender white toes with the roseate nails and their polished white half-moons were left uncovered.  At the banquet she put off her shoes altogether, as the men did; hiding her feet at first however, and not displaying them till she thought the marks left on her tender skin by the straps of the sandals had completely disappeared.  Eulaeus was the greatest admirer of these feet; not, as he averred, on account of their beauty, but because the play of the queen's toes showed him exactly what was passing in her mind, when he was quite unable to detect what was agitating her soul in the expression of her mouth and eyes, well practised in the arts of dissimulation.  Nine couches, arranged three and three in a horseshoe, invited the guests to repose, with their arms of ebony and cushions of dull olive-green brocade, on which a delicate pattern of gold and silver seemed just to have been breathed.  The queen, shrugging her shoulders, and, as it would seem, by no means agreeably surprised at something, whispered to the chamberlain, who then indicated to each guest the place he was to occupy.  To the right of the central group reclined the queen, and her husband took his place to the left; the couch between the royal pair, destined for their brother Euergetes, remained unoccupied.  On one of the three couches which formed the right-hand angle with those of the royal family, Publius found a place next to Cleopatra; opposite to him, and next the king, was Lysias the Corinthian.  Two places next to him remained vacant, while on the side by the Roman reclined the brave and prudent Hierax, the friend of Ptolemy Euergetes and his most faithful follower.  While the servants strewed the couches with rose leaves, sprinkled perfumed waters, and placed by the couch of each guest a small table-made of silver and of a slab of fine, reddish-brown porphyry, veined with white-the king addressed a pleasant greeting to each guest, apologizing for the smallness of the number.  \"Eulaeus,\" he said, \"has been forced to leave us on business, and our royal brother is still sitting over his books with Aristarchus, who came with him from Alexandria; but he promised certainly to come.\"  \"The fewer we are,\" replied Lysias, bowing low, \"the more honorable is the distinction of belonging to so limited a number of your majesty's most select associates.\"  \"I certainly think we have chosen the best from among the good,\" said the queen.  \"But even the small number of friends I had invited must have seemed too large to my brother Euergetes, for he--who is accustomed to command in other folks' houses as he does in his own--forbid the chamberlain to invite our learned friends--among whom Agatharchides, my brothers' and my own most worthy tutor, is known to you--as well as our Jewish friends who were present yesterday at our table, and whom I had set down on my list.  I am very well satisfied however, for I like the number of the Muses; and perhaps he desired to do you, Publius, particular honor, since we are assembled here in the Roman fashion.  It is in your honor, and not in his, that we have no music this evening; you said that you did not particularly like it at a banquet.  Euergetes himself plays the harp admirably.  However, it is well that he is late in coming as usual, for the day after tomorrow is his birthday, and he is to spend it here with us and not in Alexandria; the priestly delegates assembled in the Bruchion are to come from thence to Memphis to wish him joy, and we must endeavor to get up some brilliant festival.  You have no love for Eulaeus, Publius, but he is extremely skilled in such matters, and I hope he will presently return to give us "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5462"],["title","The Sisters â€” Volume 2 (#4)"],["body","advice.\"  \"For the morning we will have a grand procession,\" cried the king. \"Euergetes delights in a splendid spectacle, and I should be glad to show him how much pleasure his visit has given us.\"  The king's fine features wore a most winning expression as he spoke these words with heart-felt warmth, but his consort said thoughtfully: \"Aye! if only we were in Alexandria--but here, among all the Egyptian people--\"     CHAPTER IX.  A loud laugh re-echoing from the marble walls of the state-room interrupted the queen's speech; at first she started, but then smiled with pleasure as she recognized her brother Euergetes, who, pushing aside the chamberlains, approached the company with an elderly Greek, who walked by his side.  \"By all the dwellers on Olympus!  By the whole rabble of gods and beasts that live in the temples by the Nile!\"  cried the new-comer, again laughing so heartily that not only his fat cheeks but his whole immensely stout young frame swayed and shook.  \"By your pretty little feet, Cleopatra, which could so easily be hidden, and yet are always to be seen--by all your gentle virtues, Philometor, I believe you are trying to outdo the great Philadelphus or our Syrian uncle Antiochus, and to get up a most unique procession; and in my honor!  Just so!  I myself will take a part in the wonderful affair, and my sturdy person shall represent Eros with his quiver and bow.  Some Ethiopian dame must play the part of my mother Aphrodite; she will look the part to perfection, rising from the white sea-foam with her black skin.  And what do you think of a Pallas with short woolly hair; of the Charities with broad, flat Ethiopian feet; and an Egyptian, with his shaven head mirroring the sun, as Phoebus Apollo?\"  With these words the young giant of twenty years threw himself on the vacant couch between his brother and sister, and, after bowing, not without dignity, to the Roman, whom his brother named to him, he called one of the young Macedonians of noble birth who served at the feast as cup-bearers, had his cup filled once and again and yet a third time, drinking it off quickly and without setting it down; then he said in a loud tone, while he pushed his hands through his tossed, light brown hair, till it stood straight up in the air from his broad temples and high brow:  \"I must make up for what you have had before I came.--Another cup-full Diocleides.\"  \"Wild boy!\"  said Cleopatra, holding up her finger at him half in jest and half in grave warning.  \"How strange you look!\"  \"Like Silenus without the goat's hoofs,\" answered Euergetes.  \"Hand me a mirror here, Diocleides; follow the eyes of her majesty the queen, and you will be sure to find one.  There is the thing!  And in fact the picture it shows me does not displease me.  I see there a head on which besides the two crowns of Egypt a third might well find room, and in which there is so much brains that they might suffice to fill the skulls of four kings to the brim.  I see two vulture's eyes which are always keen of sight even when their owner is drunk, and that are in danger of no peril save from the flesh of these jolly cheeks, which, if they continue to increase so fast, must presently exclude the light, as the growth of the wood encloses a piece of money stuck into a rift in a tree- or as a shutter, when it is pushed to, closes up a window.  With these hands and arms the fellow I see in the mirror there could, at need, choke a hippopotamus; the chain that is to deck this neck must be twice as long as that worn by a well-fed Egyptian priest.  In this mirror I see a man, who is moulded out of a sturdy clay, baked out of more unctuous and solid stuff than other folks; and if the fine creature there on the bright surface wears a transparent robe, what have you to say against it, Cleopatra?  The Ptolemaic princes must protect the import trade of Alexandria, that fact was patent even to the great son of Lagus; and what would become of our commerce with Cos if I did not purchase the finest bombyx stuffs, since those who sell it make no profits out of you, the queen--and you cover yourself, like a vestal virgin, in garments of tapestry.  Give me a wreath for my head--aye and another to that, and new wine in the cup!  To the glory of Rome and to your health, Publius Cornelius Scipio, and to our last critical conjecture, my Aristarchus-- to subtle thinking and deep drinking!\"  \"To deep thinking and subtle drinking!\"  retorted the person thus addressed, while he raised the cup, looked into the wine with his twinkling eyes and lifted it slowly to his nose--a long, well-formed and slightly aquiline nose--and to his thin lips.  \"Oh! Aristarchus,\" exclaimed Euergetes, and he frowned.  \"You please me better when you clear up the meaning of your poets and historians than when you criticise the drinking-maxims of a king.  Subtle drinking is mere sipping, and sipping I leave to the bitterns and other birds that live content among the reeds.  Do you understand me?  Among reeds, I say- -whether cut for writing, or no.\"  \"By subtle drinking,\" replied the great critic with perfect indifference, as he pushed the thin, gray hair from his high brow with his slender hand.  \"By subtle drinking I mean the drinking of choice wine, and did you ever taste anything more delicate than this juice of the vines of Anthylla that your illustrious brother has set before us?  Your paradoxical axiom commends you at once as a powerful thinker and as the benevolent giver of the best of drinks.\"  \"Happily turned,\" exclaimed Cleopatra, clapping her hands, \"you here see, Publius, a proof of the promptness of an Alexandrian tongue.\"  \"Yes!\"  said Euergetes, \"if men could go forth to battle with words instead of spears the masters of the Museum in Alexander's city, with Aristarchus at their head, they might rout the united armies of Rome and Carthage in a couple of hours.\"  \"But we are not now in the battle-field but at a peaceful meal,\" said the king, with suave amiability.  \"You did in fact overhear our secret Euergetes, and mocked at my faithful Egyptians, in whose place I would gladly set fair Greeks if only Alexandria still belonged to me instead of to you.--However, a splendid procession shall not be wanting at your birthday festival.\"  \"And do you really still take pleasure in these eternal goose-step performances?\"  asked Euergetes, stretching himself out on his couch, and folding his hands to support the back of his head.  \"Sooner could I accustom myself to the delicate drinking of Aristarchus than sit for hours watching these empty pageants.  On two conditions only can I declare myself ready and willing to remain quiet, and patiently to dawdle through almost half a day, like an ape in a cage: First, if it will give our Roman friend Publius Cornelius Scipio any pleasure to witness such a performance--though, since our uncle Antiochus pillaged our wealth, and since we brothers shared Egypt between us, our processions are not to be even remotely compared to the triumphs of Roman victors--or, secondly, if I am allowed to take an active part in the affair.\"  \"On my account, Sire,\" replied Publius, \"no procession need be arranged, particularly not such a one as I should here be obliged to look on at.\"  \"Well!  I still enjoy such things,\" said Cleopatra's husband.  \"Well- arranged groups, and the populace pleased and excited are a sight I am never tired of.\"  \"As for me,\" cried Cleopatra, \"I often turn hot and cold, and the tears even spring to my eyes, when the shouting is loudest.  A great mass of men all uniting in a common emotion always has a great effect.  A drop, a grain of sand, a block of stone are insignificant objects, but millions of them together, forming the sea, the desert or the pyramids, constitute a sublime whole.  One man alone, shouting for joy, is like a madman escaped from an asylum, but when thousands of men rejoice together it must have a powerful effect on the coldest heart.  How is it that you, Publius Scipio, in whom a strong will seems to me to have found a peculiarly happy development, can remain unmoved by a scene in which the great collective will of a people finds its utterance?\"  \"Is there then any expression of will, think you,\" said the Roman, \"in this popular rejoicing?  It is just in such circumstances that each man becomes the involuntary mimic and duplicate of his neighbor; while I love to make my own way, and to be independent of everything but the laws and duties laid upon me by the state to which I belong.\"  \"And I,\" said Euergetes, \"from my childhood have always looked on at processions from the very best places, and so it is that fortune punishes me now with indifference to them and to everything of the kind; while the poor miserable devil who can never catch sight of anything more than the nose or the tip of a hair or the broad back of those who take part in them, always longs for fresh pageants.  As you hear, I need have no consideration for Publius Scipio in this, willing as I should be to do so.  Now what would you say, Cleopatra, if I myself took a part in my procession--I say mine, since it is to be in my honor; that really would be for once something new and amusing.\"  \"More new and amusing than creditable, I think,\" replied Cleopatra dryly.  \"And yet even that ought to please you,\" laughed Euergetes.  \"Since, besides being your brother, I am your rival, and we would sooner see our rivals lower themselves than rise.\"  \"Do not try to justify yourself by such words,\" interrupted the king evasively, and with a tone of regret in his soft voice.  \"We love you truly; we are ready to yield you your dominion side by side with ours, and I beg you to avoid such speeches even in jest, so that bygones may be bygones.\"  \"And,\" added Cleopatra, \"not to detract from your dignity as a king and your fame as a sage by any such fool's pranks.\"  \"Madam teacher, do you know then what I had in my mind?  I would appear as Alcibiades, followed by a train of flute-"]]]
