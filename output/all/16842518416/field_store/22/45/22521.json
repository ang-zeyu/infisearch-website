There was some one in the crowd, a Yankee, who bid her in and set her free. Do you remember him?\"  He saw her profile, her lips parted, her look far away, She inclined her head.  \"Yes,\" said her cousin, \"so do I remember him. He has crossed my path many times since, Virginia. And mark what I say--it was he whom you had in mind on that birthday when you implored me to make something of myself, It was Stephen Brice.\"  Her eyes flashed upon him quickly.  \"Oh, how dare you?\" she cried.  \"I dare anything, Virginia,\" he answered quietly. \"I am not blaming you. And I am sure that you did not realize that he was the ideal which you had in mind.\"  The impression of him has never left it. Fate is in it. Again, that night at the Brinsmades', when we were in fancy dress, I felt that I had lost you when I got back. He had been there when I was away, and gone again. And--and--you never told me.\"  \"It was a horrible mistake, Max,\" she faltered. \"I was waiting for you down the road, and stopped his horse instead. It--it was nothing--\"  \"It was fate, Jinny. In that half-hour I lost you. How I hated that man,\" he cried, \"how I hated him?\"  \"Hated!\" exclaimed Virginia, involuntarily. \"Oh, no!\"  \"Yes,\" he said, \"hated! I would have killed him if I could. But now--\"  \"But now?\"  \"Now he has saved my life. I have not--I could not tell you before: He came into the place where I was lying in Vicksburg, and they told him that my only chance was to come North, I turned my back upon him, insulted him. Yet he went to Sherman and had me brought home--to you, Virginia. If he loves you,--and I have long suspected that he does--\"  \"Oh, no,\" she cried, hiding her face \"No.\"  \"I know he loves you, Jinny,\" her cousin continued calmly, inexorably. \"And you know that he does. You must feel that he does. It was a brave thing to do, and a generous. He knew that you were engaged to me. He thought that he was saving me for you. He was giving up the hope of marrying you himself.\"  Virginia sprang to her feet. Unless you had seen her then, you had never known the woman in her glory.  \"Marry a Yankee!\" she cried. \"Clarence Colfax, have you known and loved me all my life that you might accuse me of this? Never, never, never!\" Transformed, he looked incredulous admiration.  \"Jinny, do you mean it?\" he cried.  In answer she bent down with all that gentleness and grace that was hers, and pressed her lips to his forehead. Long after she had disappeared in the door he sat staring after her.  But later, when Mammy Easter went to call her mistress for supper, she found her with her face buried in the pillows.     CHAPTER X  IN JUDGE WHIPPLE'S OFFICE  After this Virginia went to the Judge's bedside every day, in the morning, when Clarence took his sleep. She read his newspapers to him when he was well enough. She read the detested Missouri Democrat, which I think was the greatest trial Virginia ever had to put up with. To have her beloved South abused, to have her heroes ridiculed, was more than she could bear. Once, when the Judge was perceptibly better, she flung the paper out of the window, and left the room. He called her back penitently.  \"My dear,\" he said, smiling admiration, \"forgive an old bear. A selfish old bear, Jinny; my only excuse is my love for the Union. When you are not here, I lie in agony, lest she has suffered some mortal blow unknown to me, Jinny. And if God sees fit to spare our great country, the day will come when you will go down on your knees and thank Him for the inheritance which He saved for your children. You are a good woman, my dear, and a strong one. I have hoped that you will see the right. That you will marry a great citizen, one unwavering in his service and devotion to our Republic.\" The Judge's voice trembled with earnestness as he spoke. And the gray eyes under the shaggy brows were alight with the sacred fire of his life's purpose. Undaunted as her spirit was, she could not answer him then.  Once, only once, he said to her: \"Virginia, I loved your father better than any man I ever knew. Please God I may see him again before I die.\"  He never spoke of the piano. But sometimes at twilight his eyes would rest on the black cloth that hid it.  Virginia herself never touched that cloth to her it seemed the shroud upon a life of happiness that was dead and gone.  Virginia had not been with Judge Whipple during the critical week after Stephen was brought home. But Anne had told her that his anxiety was a pitiful thing to see, and that it had left him perceptibly weaker. Certain it was that he was failing fast. So fast that on some days Virginia, watching him, would send Ned or Shadrach in hot haste for Dr. Polk.  At noon Anne would relieve Virginia,--Anne or her mother,--and frequently Mr. Brinsmade would come likewise. For it is those who have the most to do who find the most time for charitable deeds. As the hour for their coming drew near, the Judge would be seeking the clock, and scarce did Anne's figure appear in the doorway before the question had arisen to his lips--\"And how is my young Captain to-day?\"  That is what he called him,--\"My young Captain.\" Virginia's choice of her cousin, and her devotion to him, while seemingly natural enough, had drawn many a sigh from Anne. She thought it strange that Virginia herself had never once asked her about Stephen's condition and she spoke of this one day to the Judge with as much warmth as she was capable of.  \"Jinny's heart is like steel where a Yankee is concerned. If her best friend were a Yankee--\"  Judge Whipple checked her, smiling.  \"She has been very good to one Yankee I know of,\" he said. \"And as for Mrs. Brice, I believe she worships her.\"  \"But when I said that Stephen was much better to-day, she swept out of the room as if she did not care whether he lived or died.\"  \"Well, Anne,\" the Judge had answered, \"you women are a puzzle to me. I guess you don't understand yourselves,\" he added.  That was a strange month in the life of Clarence Colfax,--the last of his recovery, while he was waiting for the news of his exchange. Bellegarde was never more beautiful, for Mrs. Colfax had no whim of letting the place run down because a great war was in progress. Though devoted to the South, she did not consecrate her fortune to it. Clarence gave as much as he could.  Whole afternoons Virginia and he would sit in the shaded arbor seat; or at the cool of the day descend to the bench on the lower tier of the summer garden, to steep, as it were, in the blended perfumes of the roses and the mignonettes and the pinks. He was soberer than of old. Often through the night he pondered on the change in her. She, too, was grave. But he was troubled to analyze her gravity, her dignity. Was this merely strength of character, the natural result of the trials through which she had passed, the habit acquired of being the Helper and comforter instead of the helped and comforted? Long years afterward the brightly colored portrait of her remained in his eye,--the simple linen gown of pink or white, the brown hair shining in the sunlight, the graceful poise of the head. And the background of flowers--flowers everywhere, far from the field of war.  Sometimes, when she brought his breakfast on a tray in the morning, there was laughter in her eyes. In the days gone by they had been all laughter.  They were engaged. She was to be his wife. He said it over to himself many, many times in the day. He would sit for a space, feasting his eyes upon her until she lifted her look to his, and the rich color flooded her face. He was not a lover to sit quietly by, was Clarence. And yet, as the winged days flew on, that is what he did, It was not that she did not respond to his advances, he did not make them. Nor could he have told why. Was it the chivalry inherited from a long life of Colfaxes who were gentlemen? Not wholly. Something of awe had crept into his feeling for her.  As the month wore on, and the time drew near for him to go back to the war, a state that was not quite estrangement, and yet something very like it, set in. Poor Clarence. Doubts bothered him, and he dared not give them voice. By night he would plan his speeches,--impassioned, imploring. To see her in her marvellous severity was to strike him dumb. Horrible thought! Whether she loved him, whether she did not love him, she would not give him up. Through the long years of their lives together, he would never know. He was not a weak man now, was Clarence Colfax. He was merely a man possessed of a devil, enchained by the power of self-repression come upon her whom he loved.  And day by day that power seemed to grow more intense,--invulnerable. Among her friends and in the little household it had raised Virginia to heights which she herself did not seem to realize. She was become the mistress of Bellegarde. Mrs. Colfax was under its sway, and doubly miserable because Clarence would listen to her tirades no more.  \"When are you to be married?\" she had ventured to ask him once. Nor had she taken pains to hide the sarcasm in her voice.  His answer, bringing with it her remembrance of her husband at certain times when it was not safe to question him, had silenced her. Addison Colfax had not been a quiet man. When he was quiet he was dangerous.  \"Whenever Virginia is ready, mother,\" he had replied. Whenever Virginia was ready! He knew in his heart that if he were to ask her permission to send for Dr, Posthelwaite to-morrow that she would say yes. Tomorrow came,--and with it a great envelope, an official, answer to Clarence's report that he was fit for duty once more. He had been exchanged. He was to proceed to Cairo, there to await the arrival of the transport Indianapolis, which was to carry five hundred officers and men from Sandusky Prison, who were going back to fight once more for the Confederacy. O that they might have seen the North, all those brave men who made that sacrifice."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5394"],["title","The Crisis â€” Volume 07 (#7)"],["body","they might have realized the numbers and the resources and the wealth arrayed against them!  It was a cool day for September, a perfect day, an auspicious day, and yet it went the way of the others before it. This was the very fulness of the year, the earth giving out the sweetness of her maturity, the corn in martial ranks, with golden plumes nodding. The forest still in its glory of green. They walked in silence the familiar paths, and Alfred, clipping the late roses for the supper table, shook his white head as they passed him. The sun, who had begun to hurry on his southward journey, went to bed at six. The few clothes Clarence was to take with him had been packed by Virginia in his bag, and the two were standing in the twilight on the steps of the house, when Ned came around the corner. He called his young mistress by name, but she did not hear him. He called again.  \"Miss Jinny!\"  She started as from a sleep, and paused.  \"Yes, Mr. Johnson,\" said she, and smiled. He wore that air of mystery so dear to darkeys.  \"Gemmen to see you, Miss Jinny.\"  \"A gentleman!\" she said in surprise. \"Where?\"  The negro pointed to the lilac shrubbery.  \"Thar!\"  \"What's all this nonsense, Ned?\" said Clarence, sharply: \"If a man is there, bring him here at once.\"  \"Reckon he won't come, Marse Clarence.\" said Ned, \"He fearful skeered ob de light ob day. He got suthin very pertickler fo' Miss Jinny.\"  \"Do you know him?\" Clarence demanded.  \"No sah--yessah--leastwise I'be seed 'um. Name's Robimson.\"  The word was hardly out of his mouth before Virginia had leaped down the four feet from the porch to the flower-bed and was running across the lawn toward the shrubbery. Parting the bushes after her, Clarence found his cousin confronting a large man, whom he recognized as the carrier who brought messages from the South.  \"What's the matter, Jinny?\" he demanded.  \"Pa has got through the lines,\" she said breathlessly. \"He--he came up to see me. Where is he, Robinson?\"  \"He went to Judge Whipple's rooms, ma'am. They say the Judge is dying. I reckoned you knew it, Miss Jinny,\" Robinson added contritely.  \"Clarence,\" she said, \"I must go at once.\"  \"I will go with you,\" he said; \"you cannot go alone.\" In a twinkling Ned and Sambo had the swift pair of horses harnessed, and the light carriage was flying over the soft clay road toward the city. As they passed Mr. Brinsmade's place, the moon hung like a great round lantern under the spreading trees about the house. Clarence caught a glimpse of his cousin's face in the light. She was leaning forward, her gaze fixed intently on the stone posts which stood like monuments between the bushes at the entrance. Then she drew back again into the dark corner of the barouche. She was startled by a sharp challenge, and the carriage stopped. Looking out, she saw the provost's guard like black card figures on the road, and Ned fumbling for his pass.  On they drove into the city streets until the dark bulk of the Court House loomed in front of them, and Ned drew rein at the little stairway which led to the Judge's rooms. Virginia, leaping out of the carriage, flew up the steps and into the outer office, and landed in the Colonel's arms.  \"Jinny!\"  \"Oh, Pa!\" she cried. \"Why do you risk your life in this way? If the Yankees catch you--\"  \"They won't catch me, honey,\" he answered, kissing her. Then he held her out at arm's length and gazed earnestly into her face. Trembling, she searched his own. \"Pa, how old you look!\"  \"I'm not precisely young, my dear,\" he said, smiling. His hair was nearly white, and his face scared. But he was a fine erect figure of a man, despite the shabby clothes he wore, and the mud-bespattered boots.  \"Pa,\" she whispered, \"it was foolhardy to come here. Why did you come to St. Louis at all?\"  \"I came to see you, Jinny, I reckon. And when I got home to-night and heard Silas was dying, I just couldn't resist. He's the oldest friend I've got in St. Louis, honey and now--now--\"  \"Pa, you've been in battle?\"  \"Yes,\" he said.  \"And you weren't hurt; I thank God for that,\" she whispered. After a while: \"Is Uncle Silas dying?\"  \"Yes, Jinny; Dr. Polk is in there now, and says that he can't last through the night. Silas has been asking for you, honey, over and over. He says you were very good to him,--that you and Mrs. Brice gave up everything to nurse him.\"  \"She did,\" Virginia faltered. \"She was here night and day until her son came home. She is a noble woman--\"  \"Her son?\" repeated the Colonel. \"Stephen Brice? Silas has done nothing the last half-hour but call his name. He says he must see the boy before he dies. Polk says he is not strong enough to come.\"  \"Oh, no, he is not strong enough,\" cried Virginia. The Colonel looked down at her queerly. \"Where is Clarence?\" he asked.  She had not thought of Clarence. She turned hurriedly, glanced around the room, and then peered down the dark stairway.  \"Why, he came in with me. I wonder why he did not follow me up?\"  \"Virginia.\"  \"Yes, Pa.\"  \"Virginia, are you happy?\"  \"Why, yes, Pa.\"  \"Are you going to marry Clarence?\" he asked.  \"I have promised,\" she said simply.  Then after a long pause, seeing her father said nothing, she added, \"Perhaps he was waiting for you to see me alone. I will go down to see if he is in the carriage.\"  The Colonel started with her, but she pulled him back in alarm.  \"You will be seen, Pa,\" she cried. \"How can you be so reckless?\"  He stayed at the top of the passage, holding open the door that she might have light. When she reached the sidewalk, there was Ned standing beside the horses, and the carriage empty.  \"Ned!\"  \"Yass'm, Miss Jinny.\"  \"Where's Mr. Clarence?\"  \"He done gone, Miss Tinny.\"  \"Gone?\"  \"Yass'm. Fust I seed was a man plump out'n Willums's, Miss Jinny. He was a-gwine shufflin' up de street when Marse Clarence put out after him, pos' has'e. Den he run.\"  She stood for a moment on the pavement in thought, and paused on the stairs again, wondering whether it were best to tell her father. Perhaps Clarence had seen--she caught her breath at the thought and pushed open the door.  \"Oh, Pa, do you think you are safe here?\" she cried. \"Why, yes, honey, I reckon so,\" he answered. \"Where's Clarence?\"  \"Ned says he ran after a man who was hiding in an entrance. Pa, I am afraid they are watching the place.\"  \"I don't think so, Jinny. I came here with Polk, in his buggy, after dark.\"  Virginia, listening, heard footsteps on the stairs, and seized her father's sleeve.  \"Think of the risk you are running, Pa,\" she whispered. She would have dragged him to the closet. But it was too late. The door opened, and Mr. Brinsmade entered, and with him a lady veiled.  At sight of Mr. Carvel Mr. Brinsmade started back in surprise. How long he stared at his old friend Virginia could not say. It seemed to her an eternity. But Mrs. Brice has often told since how straight the Colonel stood, his fine head thrown back, as he returned the glance. Then Mr. Brinsmade came forward, with his hand outstretched.  \"Comyn,\" said he, his voice breaking a little, \"I have known you these many years as a man of unstained honor. You are safe with me. I ask no questions. God will judge whether I have done my duty.\"  Mr. Carvel took his friend's hand. \"Thank you, Calvin,\" he said. \"I give you my word of honor as a gentleman that I came into this city for no other reason than to see my daughter. And hearing that my old friend was dying, I could not resist the temptation, sir--\"  Mr. Brinsmade finished for him. And his voice shook.  \"To come to his bedside. How many men do you think would risk their lives so, Mrs. Brice?\"  \"Not many, indeed, Mr. Brinsmade,\" she answered. \"Thank God he will now die happy. I know it has been much on his mind.\"  The Colonel bowed over her hand.  \"And in his name, madam,--in the name of my oldest and best friend,--I thank you for what you have done for him. I trust that you will allow me to add that I have learned from my daughter to respect and admire you. I hope that your son is doing well.\"  \"He is, thank you, Colonel Carvel. If he but knew that the Judge were dying, I could not have kept him at home. Dr. Polk says that he must not leave the house, or undergo any excitement.\"  Just then the door of the inner room opened, and Dr. Polk came out. He bowed gravely to Mrs. Brice and Mr. Brinsmade, and he patted Virginia.  \"The Judge is still asleep,\" he said gently. \"And--he may not wake up in this world.\"  Silently, sadly, they went together into that little room where so much of Judge Whipple's life had been spent. How little it was! And how completely they filled it,--these five people and the big Rothfield covered with the black cloth. Virginia pressed her father's arm as they leaned against it, and brushed her eyes. The Doctor turned the wick of the night-lamp.  What was that upon the sleeper's face from which they drew back? A smile? Yes, and a light. The divine light which is shed upon those who have lived for others, who have denied themselves the lusts of the flesh, For a long space, perhaps an hour, they stayed, silent save for a low word now and again from the Doctor as he felt the Judge's heart. Tableaux from the past floated before Virginia's eyes. Of the old days, of the happy days in Locust Street, of the Judge quarrelling with her father, and she and Captain Lige smiling nearby. And she remembered how sometimes when the controversy was finished the Judge would rub his nose and say:  \"It's my turn now, Lige.\"  Whereupon the Captain would open the piano, and she would play the hymn that he liked best. It was \"Lead, Kindly Light.\"  What was it in Silas Whipple's nature that courted the pain of memories? What pleasure could it have been all through his illness to look upon this silent and cruel reminder of days gone by forever? She had heard that Stephen Brice had been with the Judge when he had bid it in. She wondered that he had allowed it, for they said that he was the only one who had ever been known to "]]]
