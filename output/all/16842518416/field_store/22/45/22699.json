Birthdays were held in      much honor by the ancients, and more especially those of their      kings.  Both the great bilingual Egyptian tablets, which we possess      (the Rosetta stone, line 10 of hieroglyphic text; Gr. text, line 46.      and the edict of Canopus ed. Lepsius, hieroglyphic text 1. 3.  Gr.      text 1. 5.) mention the celebration of the birthday of one of the      Ptolemies; and even of Rameses II., so early as the 14th century B.      C.  we read: \"There was joy in heaven on his birthday.\"]  The entire body of officials and deputies streamed from the provinces up to the royal city, bringing presents to their ruler and good wishes; they came also to take part in the great sacrifices at which horses, stags, bulls and asses were slaughtered in thousands as offerings to the gods.  At this festival all the Persians received gifts, every man was allowed to ask a petition of the king, which seldom remained unfulfilled, and in every city the people were feasted at the royal expense.  Cambyses had commanded that his marriage with Nitetis should be celebrated eight days after the birthday, and all the magnates of the realms should be invited to the ceremony.  The streets of Babylon swarmed with strangers, the colossal palaces on both shores of the Euphrates were overfilled, and all the houses stood adorned in festal brightness.  The zeal thus displayed by his people, this vast throng of human beings, --representing and bringing around him, as it were, his entire kingdom, contributed not a little to raise the king's spirits.  His pride was gratified; and the only longing left in his heart had been stilled by Nitetis' love.  For the first time in his life he believed himself completely happy, and bestowed his gifts, not only from a sense of his duty as king of Persia, but because the act of giving was in itself a pleasure.  Megabyzus could not extol the deeds of Bartja and his friends too highly. Cambyses embraced the young warriors, gave them horses and gold chains, called them \"brothers\" and reminded Bartja, that he had promised to grant him a petition if he returned victorious.  At this Bartja cast down his eyes, not knowing at first in what form to begin his request, and the king answered laughing: \"Look, my friends; our young hero is blushing like a girl!  It seems I shall have to grant something important; so he had better wait until my birthday, and then, at supper, when the wine has given him courage, he shall whisper in my ear what he is now afraid to utter.  Ask much, Bartja, I am happy myself, and wish all my friends to be happy too.\"  Bartja only smiled in answer and went to his mother; for he had not yet opened his heart to her on the matter which lay so near it.  He was afraid of meeting with decided opposition; but Croesus had cleared the way far him by telling Kassandane so much in praise of Sappho, her virtues and her graces, her talents and skill, that Nitetis and Atossa maintained she must have given the old man a magic potion, and Kassandane, after a short resistance, yielded to her darling's entreaties.  \"A Greek woman the lawful wife of a Persian prince of the blood!\"  cried the blind woman.  \"Unheard of! What will Cambyses say?  How can we gain his consent?\"  \"On that matter you may be at ease, my mother,\" answered Bartja, \"I am as certain that my brother will give his consent, as I am that Sappho will prove an ornament and honor to our house.\"  \"Croesus has already told me much in favor of this maiden,\" answered Kassandane,\" and it pleases me that thou hast at last resolved to marry; but never-the-less this alliance does not seem suitable for a son of Cyrus.  And have you forgotten that the Achaemenidae; will probably refuse to recognize the child of a Greek mother as their future king, if Cambyses should remain childless?\"  \"Mother, I fear nothing; for my heart is not set upon the crown.  And indeed many a king of Persia has had a mother of far lower parentage than my Sappho.\"  I feel persuaded that when my relations see the precious jewel I have won on the Nile, not one of them will chide me.\"  \"The gods grant that Sappho may be equal to our Nitetis!\"  answered Kassandane, \"I love her as if she were my own child, and bless the day which brought her to Persia.  The warm light of her eyes has melted your brother's hard heart; her kindness and gentleness bring beauty into the night of my blind old age, and her sweet earnestness and gravity have changed your sister Atossa from an unruly child into a gentle maiden. But now call them, (they are playing in the garden), and we will tell them of the new friend they are to gain through you.\"  \"Pardon me, my mother,\" answered Bartja, \"but I must beg you not to tell my sister until we are sure of the king's consent.\"  \"You are right, my son.  We must conceal your wish, to save Nitetis and Atossa from a possible disappointment.  A bright hope unfulfilled is harder to bear than an unexpected sorrow.  So let us wait for your brother's consent, and may the gods give their blessing!\"  Early in the morning of the king's birthday the Persians offered their sacrifices on the shores of the Euphrates.  A huge altar of silver had been raised on an artificial hill.  On this a mighty fire had been kindled,  from which flames and sweet odors rose towards heaven.  White-robed magi fed the fire with pieces of daintily-cut sandal-wood, and stirred it with bundles of rods.  A cloth, the Paiti-dhana, was bound round the  heads of the priests, the ends of which covered the mouth, and thus preserved the pure fire from pollution by human breath.       [The Persians were ordered to hold this little square piece of cloth      before their mouths when they prayed.  It was from 2 to 7 fingers      broad.  Anquetil gives a drawing of it in his Zend-Avesia.  Strabo      speaks of the Paiti-dhana p. 733.  He says the ends of the cloth      used as a covering for the head hung down over the mouth.]  The victims had been slaughtered in a meadow near the river, the flesh cut into pieces, sprinkled with salt, and laid out on tender grasses, sprouts of clover, myrtle-blossoms, and laurel-leaves, that the beautiful daughter of Ormuzd, the patient, sacred Earth, might not be touched by aught that was dead or bleeding.  Oropastes, the chief Destur,--[Priest]--now drew near the fire and cast fresh butter into it.  The flames leapt up into the air and all the Persians fell on their knees and hid their faces, in the belief that the fire was now ascending to their great god and father.  The Magian then took a mortar, laid some leaves and stalks of the sacred herb Haomas within it, crushed them and poured the ruddy juice, the food of the gods, into the flames.  After this he raised his hands to heaven, and, while the other priests continually fed the flames into a wilder blaze by casting in fresh butter, sang a long prayer out of the sacred books.  In this prayer the blessing of the gods was called down on everything pure and good, but principally on the king and his entire realm.  The good spirits of light, life and truth; of all noble deeds; of the Earth, the universal giver; of the refreshing waters, the shining metals, the pastures, trees and innocent creatures, were praised: the evil spirits of darkness; of lying, the deceiver of mankind; of disease, death and sin; of the rigid cold; the desolating heat; of all odious dirt and vermin, were cursed, together with their father the malignant Ahriman.  At the end all present joined in singing the festival prayer: \"Purity and glory are sown for them that are pure and upright in heart.\"  The sacrificial ceremony was concluded with the king's prayer, and then Cambyses, arrayed in his richest robes, ascended a splendid chariot drawn by four snow-white Nicoean horses, and studded with topazes, cornelian and amber, and was conveyed to the great reception-hall, where the deputies and officers from the provinces awaited him.  As soon as the king and his retinue had departed, the priests selected, for themselves, the best pieces of the flesh which had been offered in sacrifice, and allowed the thronging crowd to take the rest.  The Persian divinities disdained sacrifices in the light of food, requiring only the souls of the slaughtered animals, and many a poor man, especially among the priests, subsisted on the flesh of the abundant royal sacrifices.  The prayer offered up by the Magian was a model for those of the Persian people.  No man was allowed to ask anything of the gods for himself alone.  Every pious soul was rather to implore blessings for his nation; for was not each only a part of the whole? and did not each man share in the blessings granted to the whole kingdom?  But especially they were commanded to pray for the king, in whom the realm was embodied and shadowed forth.  It was this beautiful surrender of self for the public weal, that had made the Persians great.  The doctrines of the Egyptian priesthood represented the Pharaohs as actual divinities, while the Persian monarchs were only called \"sons of the gods;\" yet the power of the latter was far more absolute and unfettered than that of the former; the reason for this being that the Persians had been wise enough to free themselves from priestly domination, while the Pharaohs, as we have seen, if not entirely under the dominion of the priestly caste, were yet under its influence in the most important matters.  The Egyptian intolerance of all strange religions was unknown in Asia. The conquered Babylonians were allowed by Cyrus to retain their own gods, after their incorporation in the great Asiatic kingdom.  The Jews, Ionians and inhabitants of Asia Minor, in short, the entire mass of nations subject to Cambyses remained unmolested in possession of their hereditary religions and customs.  Beside the great altar, therefore, might be seen many a smaller sacrificial flame, kindled in honor "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5454"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 05 (#2)"],["body","their own divinities, by the envoys from the conquered provinces to this great birthday feast.  Viewed from a distance, the immense city looked like a gigantic furnace. Thick clouds of smoke hovered over its towers, obscuring the light of the burning May sun.  By the time the king had reached the palace, the multitude who had come to take part in the festival had formed themselves into a procession of interminable length, which wandered on through the straight streets of Babylon towards the royal palace.  Their road was strewn with myrtle and palm-branches, roses, poppy and oleander-blossoms, and with leaves of the silver poplar, palm and laurel; the air perfumed with incense, myrrh, and a thousand other sweet odors. Carpets and flags waved and fluttered from the houses.  Music too was there; the shrill peal of the Median trumpet, and soft tone of the Phrygian flute; the Jewish cymbal and harp, Paphlagonian tambourines and the stringed instruments of Ionia; Syrian kettle-drums and cymbals, the shells and drums of the Arians from the mouth of the Indus, and the loud notes of the Bactrian battle-trumpets.  But above all these resounded the rejoicing shouts of the Babylonian multitude, subjugated by the Persians only a few short years before, and yet, like all Asiatics, wearing their fetters with an air of gladness so long as the fear of their tyrant was before their eyes.  The fragrant odors, the blaze of color and sparkling of gold and jewels, the neighing of the horses, and shouts and songs of human beings, all united to produce a whole, at once bewildering and intoxicating to the senses and the feelings.  The messengers had not been sent up to Babylon empty-handed.  Beautiful horses, huge elephants and comical monkeys; rhinoceroses and buffaloes adorned with housings and tassels; double-humped Bactrian camels with gold collars on their shaggy necks; waggon-loads of rare woods and ivory, woven goods of exquisite texture, casks of ingots and gold-dust, gold and silver vessels, rare plants for the royal gardens, and foreign animals for the preserves, the most remarkable of which were antelopes, zebras, and rare monkeys and birds, these last being tethered to a tree in full leaf and fluttering among the branches.  Such were the offerings sent to the great king of Persia.  They were the tribute of the conquered nations and, after having been shown to the king, were weighed and tested by treasurers and secretaries, either declared satisfactory, or found wanting and returned, in which case the niggardly givers were condemned to bring a double tribute later.       [At the time of which we are writing, the kings of Persia taxed      their kingdom at whatever time and to whatever extent seemed good in      their own eyes.  Cambyses' successor, Darius, was the first to      introduce a regular system of taxation, in consequence of which he      was nicknamed \"the shopkeeper.\"  Up to a much later period it still      remained the duty of certain districts to send natural products to      the court  Herod. I.  192.  Xenoph.  Anab. IV. 5.]  The palace-gates were reached without hindrance, the way being kept clear by lines of soldiers and whipbearers stationed on either side of the street.  If the royal progress to the place of sacrifice, when five hundred richly-caprisoned horses had been led behind the king's chariot, could be called magnificent, and the march of the envoys a brilliant spectacle, the great throne-room presented a vision of dazzling and magic beauty.  In the background, raised on six steps, each of which was guarded, as it were, by two golden clogs, stood the throne of gold; above it, supported by four golden pillars studded with precious stones, was a purple canopy, on which appeared two winged discs, the king's Feruer.       [The Feruer or Ferwer is the spiritual part of every man-his soul      and reason.  It was in existence before the man was horn, joins him      at his birth and departs at his death.  The Ferwer keeps up a war      with the Diws or evil spirits, and is the element of man's      preservation in life.  The moment he departs, the body returns to      its original elements.  After death he becomes immortal if he has      done well, but if his deeds have been evil he is cast into hell.  It      is right to call upon the Ferwer and entreat his help.  He will      bring the prayer before God and on this account is represented as a      winged disc.]  Fan-bearers, high in office at the court, stood behind the throne, and, on either side, those who sat at the king's table, his relations and friends, and the most important among the officers of state, the priestly caste and the eunuchs.  The walls and ceiling of the entire hall were covered with plates of burnished gold, and the floor with purple carpets.  Before the silver gates lay winged bulls, and the king's body-guard-their dress consisting of a gold cuirass under a purple overcoat, and the high Persian cap, their swords in golden scabbards glittering with jewels, and their lances ornamented with gold and silver apples, were stationed in the court of the palace.  Among them the band of the \"Immortals\" was easily to be distinguished by their stately forms and dauntless bearing.  Officers, whose duty consisted in announcing and presenting strangers, and who carried short ivory staves, led the deputies into the hall, and up to the throne, where they cast themselves on the ground as though they would kiss the earth, concealing their hands in the sleeves of their robes.  A cloth was bound over the mouth of every man before he was allowed to answer the king's questions, lest the pure person of the king should be polluted by the breath of common men.  Cambyses' severity or mildness towards the deputations with whose chiefs he spoke, was proportioned to the obedience of their province and the munificence of their tribute-offerings.  Near the end of the train appeared an embassy from the Jews, led by two grave men with sharply-cut features and long beards.  Cambyses called on them in a friendly tone to stop.  The first of these men was dressed in the fashion of the Babylonian aristocracy.  The other wore a purple robe woven without seam, trimmed with bells and tassels, and held in at the waist by a girdle of blue, red and white.  A blue garment was thrown over his shoulders and a little bag suspended around his neck containing the sacred lots, the Urim and Thummin, adorned with twelve precious stones set in gold, and bearing the names of the tribes of Israel.  The high-priest's brow was grave and thoughtful.  A white cloth was wound round his head, the ends of which hung down to the shoulders.  \"I rejoice to behold you once more, Belteshazzar,\" exclaimed the king to the former of the two men.  \"Since the death of my father you have not been seen at my gate.\"  The man thus addressed bowed humbly and answered: \"The favor of the king rejoices his servant!  If it seem good unto thee, to cause the sun of thy favor to shine on me, thine unworthy servant, so hearken unto my petition for my nation, which thy great father caused to return unto the land of their fathers' sepulchres.  This old man at my side, Joshua, the high- priest of our God, hath not feared the long journey to Babylon, that he might bring his request before thy face.  Let his speech be pleasing in thine ears and his words bring forth fruit in thine heart.\"  \"I foresee what ye desire of me,\" cried the king.  \"Am I wrong, priest, in supposing that your petition refers to the building of the temple in your native land?\"  \"Nothing can be hidden from the eyes of my lord,\" answered the priest, bowing low.  \"Thy servants in Jerusalem desire to behold the face of their ruler, and beseech thee by my mouth to visit the land of their fathers, and to grant them permission to set forward the work of the temple, concerning which thine illustrious father (the favor of our God rest upon him), made a decree.\"  The king answered with a smile: \"You have the craft of your nation, and understand how to choose the right time and words for your petition.  On my birthday it is difficult for me to refuse my faithful people even one request.  I promise you, therefore, so soon as possible to visit Jerusalem and the land of your fathers.\"  \"By so doing thou wilt make glad the hearts of thy servants,\" answered the priest; \"our vines and olives will bear more fruit at thine approach, our gates will lift up their heads to receive thee, and Israel rejoice with shouts to meet his lord doubly blessed if as lord of the building--\"  \"Enough, priest, enough!\"  cried Cambyses.  \"Your first petition, I have said it, shall not remain unfulfilled; for I have long desired to visit the wealthy city of Tyre, the golden Sidon, and Jerusalem with its strange superstitions; but were I to give permission for the building now, what would remain for me to grant you in the coming year?\"  \"Thy servants will no more molest thee by their petitions, if thou grant unto them this one, to finish the temple of the Lord their God,\" answered the priest.  \"Strange beings, these men of Palestine!\"  exclaimed Cambyses.  \"I have heard it said that ye believe in one God alone, who can be represented by no likeness, and is a spirit.  Think ye then that this omnipresent Being requires a house?  Verily, your great spirit can be but a weak and miserable creature, if he need a covering from the wind and rain, and a shelter from the heat which he himself has created.  If your God be like ours, omnipresent, fall down before him and worship as we do, in every place, and feel certain that everywhere ye will be heard of him!\"  \"The God of Israel hears his people in every place,\" exclaimed the high- priest.  \"He heard us when we pined in captivity under the Pharaohs far from our land; he heard us weeping by the rivers of Babylon.  He chose thy father to be the instrument of our deliverance, and will hear my prayer this day and soften thine heart like wise."]]]
