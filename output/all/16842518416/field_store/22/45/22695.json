It is indeed expected that the princes shall marry in their own family, the Achaemenidae; but the Persians have an unbounded predilection for everything foreign.  Enchanted with the beauty of your granddaughter, and rendered indulgent by their partiality for Bartja, they would easily forgive this breach of an ancient custom.  Indeed, if the king gives his approval, no objection on the part of his subjects can be entertained. The history of Iran too offers a sufficient number of examples, in which even slaves became the mothers of kings.  The queen mother, whose position, in the eyes of the people, is nearly as high as that of the monarch himself, will do nothing to thwart the happiness of her youngest and favorite son.  When she sees that he will not give up Sappho,--that his smiling face, in which she adores the image of her great husband Cyrus, becomes clouded, I verily believe she would be ready to sanction his taking even a Scythian woman to wife, if it could restore him to cheerfulness.  Neither will Cambyses himself refuse his consent if his mother press the point at a right moment.\"  \"In that case every difficulty is set aside,\" cried Rhodopis joyfully.  \"It is not the marriage itself, but the time that must follow, which causes me uneasiness,\" answered Croesus.  \"Do you think then that Bartja .  .  . ?\"  \"From him I fear nothing.  He has a pure heart, and has been so long proof against love, that now he has once yielded, he will love long and ardently.\"  \"What then do you fear?\"  \"You must remember that, though the charming wife of their favorite will be warmly received by all his friends of his own sex, there are thousands of idle women in the harems of the Persian nobles, who will endeavor, by every artifice and intrigue in their power, to injure the newly-risen star; and whose greatest joy it will be to ruin such an inexperienced child and make her unhappy.\"  \"You have a very bad opinion of the Persian women.\"  \"They are but women, and will naturally envy her, who has gained the husband they all desired either for themselves or for their daughters. In their monotonous life, devoid of occupation, envy easily becomes hatred, and the gratification of these evil passions is the only compensation which the poor creatures can obtain for the total absence of love and loss of freedom.  I repeat, the more beautiful Sappho is, the more malicious they will feel towards her, and, even if Bartja should love her so fervently as not to take a second wife for two or three years, she will still have such heavy hours to encounter, that I really do not know whether I dare congratulate you on her apparently brilliant future.\"  \"That is quite my own feeling.  A simple Greek would be more welcome to me than this son of a mighty monarch.\"  In this moment Knakias brought Bartja into the room.  He went to Rhodopis at once, besought her not to refuse him the hand of her granddaughter, spoke of his ardent love, and assured her that his happiness would be doubled, if she would consent to accompany them to Persia.  Then turning to Croesus, he seized his hand and entreated forgiveness for having so long concealed his great happiness from one who had been like a father to him, at the same time begging him to second his suit with Rhodopis.  The old man listened to the youth's passionate language with a smile, and said: \"Ah, Bartja, how often have I warned thee against love!  It is a scorching fire.\"  \"But its flame is bright and beautiful.\"  \"It causes pain.\"  \"But such pain is sweet.\"  \"It leads the mind astray.\"  \"But it strengthens the heart.\"  \"Oh, this love!\"  cried Rhodopis.  \"Inspired by Eros, the boy speaks as if he had been all his life studying under an Attic orator!\"  \"And yet,\" answered Croesus, \"these lovers are the most unteachable of pupils.  Convince them as clearly as you will, that their passion is only another word for poison, fire, folly, death, they still cry, 'Tis sweet,' and will not be hindered in their course.\"  As he was speaking Sappho came in.  A white festal robe, with wide sleeves, and borders of purple embroidery, fell in graceful folds round her delicate figure, and was confined at the waist by a golden girdle. Her hair was adorned with fresh roses, and on her bosom lay her lover's first gift, the flashing diamond star.  She came up modestly and gracefully, and made a low obeisance to the aged Croesus.  His eyes rested long on the maidenly and lovely countenance, and the longer he gazed the kindlier became his gaze.  For a moment he seemed to grow young again in the visions conjured up by memory, and involuntarily he went up to the young girl, kissed her affectionately on the forehead, and, taking her by the hand, led her to Bartja with the words: \"Take her, thy wife she must be, if the entire race of the Achaemenidae were to conspire against us!\"  \"Have I no voice in the matter?\"  said Rhodopis, smiling through her tears.  On hearing these words, Bartja and Sappho each took one of her hands, and gazed entreatingly into her face.  She rose to her full stature, and like a prophetess exclaimed: \"Eros, who brought you to each other, Zeus and Apollo defend and protect you.  I see you now like two fair roses on one stem, loving and happy in the spring of life.  What summer, autumn and winter may have in store for you, lies hidden with the gods.  May the shades of thy departed parents, Sappho, smile approvingly when these tidings of their child shall reach them in the nether world.\"                 .................................  Three days later a densely packed crowd was once more surging round the Sais landing-place.  This time they had assembled to bid a last farewell to their king's daughter, and in this hour the people gave clear tokens that, in spite of all the efforts of the priestly caste, their hearts remained loyal to their monarch and his house.  For when Amasis and Ladice embraced Nitetis for the last time with tears--when Tachot, in presence of all the inhabitants of Sais, following her sister down the broad flight of steps that led to the river, threw her arms round her neck once more and burst into sobs--when at last the wind filled the sails of the royal boat and bore the princess, destined to be the great king's bride, from their sight, few eyes among that vast crowd remained dry.  The priests alone looked on at this sad scene with unmoved gravity and coldness; but when the south wind at last bore away the strangers who had robbed them of their princess, many a curse and execration followed from the Egyptians on the shore; Tachot alone stood weeping there and waving her veil to them.  For whom were these tears?  for the play-fellow of her youth, or for the handsome, beloved prince?  Amasis embraced his wife and daughter in the eyes of all his people; and held up his little grandson, Prince Necho, to their gaze, the sight eliciting cries of joy on all sides.  But Psamtik, the child's own father, stood by the while, tearless and motionless.  The king appeared not to observe him, until Neithotep approached, and leading him to his father, joined their hands and called down the blessing of the gods upon the royal house.  At this the Egyptians fell on their knees with uplifted hands.  Amasis clasped his son to his heart, and when the high-priest had concluded his prayer, the following colloquy between the latter and Amasis took place in low tones:  \"Let peace be between us for our own and Egypt's sake!\"  \"Hast thou received Nebenchari's letter?\"  \"A Samian pirate-vessel is in pursuit of Phanes' trireme.\"  \"Behold the child of thy predecessor Hophra, the rightful heiress of the Egyptian throne, departing unhindered to a distant land!\"  \"The works of the Greek temple now building in Memphis shall be discontinued.\"  \"May Isis grant us peace, and may prosperity and happiness increase in our land!\"                      ............................  The Greek colonists in Naukratis had prepared a feast to celebrate the departure of their protector's daughter.  Numerous animals had been slaughtered in sacrifice on the altars of the Greek divinities, and the Nile-boats were greeted with a loud cry of \"Ailinos\" on their arrival in the harbor.  A bridal wreath, composed of a hoop of gold wound round with scented violets, was presented to Nitetis by a troop of young girls in holiday dresses, the act of presentation being performed by Sappho, as the most beautiful among the maidens of Naukratis.  On accepting the gift Nitetis kissed her forehead in token of gratitude. The triremes were already waiting; she went on board, the rowers took their oars and began the Keleusma.       [The measure of the Keleusma was generally given by a flute-player,      the Trieraules.  AEschylus, Persians 403.  Laert. Diog. IV. 22.  In      the Frogs of Aristophanes the inhabitants of the marshes are made to      sing the Keleusma, v. 205.  The melody, to the measure of which the      Greek boatmen usually timed their strokes.]  Ailinos rang across the water from a thousand voices.  Bartja stood on the deck, and waved a last loving farewell to his betrothed; while Sappho prayed in silence to Aphrodite Euploia, the protectress of those who go down to the sea in ships.  A tear rolled down her cheek, but around her lips played a smile of love and hope, though her old slave Melitta, who accompanied her to carry her parasol, was weeping as if her heart would break.  On seeing, however, a few leaves fall from her darling's wreath, she forgot her tears for a moment and whispered softly: \"Yes, dear heart, it is easy to see that you are in love; when the leaves fall from a maiden's wreath, 'tis a sure sign that her heart has been touched by Eros.     CHAPTER XII.  Seven weeks after Nitetis had quitted her native country, a long train of equipages and horsemen was to be seen on the king's highway from the west to Babylon, moving steadily towards that gigantic city, whose towers might already be descried in the far"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5453"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 04 (#3)"],["body","istance.       [The great road called the \"king's road,\" of which we shall have      more to say, was made by Cyrus and carefully kept up by Darius.]  The principal object in this caravan was a richly-gilded, four-wheeled carriage, closed in at the sides by curtains, and above by a roof supported on wooden pillars.  In this vehicle, called the Harmamaxa, resting on rich cushions of gold brocade, sat our Egyptian Princess.       [Harmamaxa--An Asiatic travelling carriage.  The first mention of      these is in Xenophon's Anabasis, where we find a queen travelling in      such a vehicle.  They were later adopted by the Romans and used for      the same object.]  On either side rode her escort, viz.: the Persian princes and nobles whom we have already learnt to know during their visit to Egypt, Croesus and his son.  Behind these, a long train, consisting of fifty vehicles of different kinds and six hundred beasts of burden, stretched away into the distance, and the royal carriage was preceded by a troop of splendidly-mounted Persian cavalry.  The high-road followed the course of the Euphrates, passing through luxuriant fields of wheat, barley and sesame yielding fruit two, and sometimes even three, hundred-fold.  Slender date-palms covered with golden fruit were scattered in every direction over the fields, which were thoroughly irrigated by means of canals and ditches.  It was winter, but the sun shone warm and bright from a cloudless sky. The mighty river swarmed with craft of all sizes, either transporting the products of Upper Armenia to the plains of Mesopotamia, or the wares of Greece and Asia Minor from Thapsakus to Babylon.       [Thapsakus--An important commercial town on the Euphrates, and the      point of observation from which Eratosthenes took his measurements      of the earth.]  Pumps and water-wheels poured refreshing streams over the thirsty land, and pretty villages ornamented the shores of the river.  Indeed every object gave evidence that our caravan was approaching the metropolis of a carefully governed and civilized state.  Nitetis and her retinue now halted at a long brick house, roofed with asphalte, and surrounded by a grove of plane-trees.       [Asphalte--Nearly all authorities, ancient as well as modern, report      that bitumen, which is still plentifully found in the neighborhood      of Babylon, was used by the Babylonians as mortar.  See, besides the      accounts of ancient writers, W. Vaux, 'Nineveh and Persepolis'.      Burnt bitumen was used by Assyrians for cement in building.]  Here Croesus was lifted from his horse, and approaching the carriage, exclaimed: \"Here we are at length at the last station!  That high tower which you see on the horizon is the celebrated temple of Bel, next to the Pyramids, one of the most gigantic works ever constructed by human hands. Before sunset we shall have reached the brazen gates of Babylon.  And now I would ask you to alight, and let me send your maidens into the house; for here you must put on Persian apparel, to appear well-pleasing in the eyes of Cambyses.  In a few hours you will stand before your future husband.  But you are pale!  Permit your maidens to adorn your cheeks with a color that shall look like the excitement of joy.  A first impression is often a final one, and this is especially true with regard to Cambyses.  If, which I doubt not, you are pleasing in his eyes at first, then you have won his love for ever; but if you should displease him to-day he will never look kindly on you again, for he is rough and harsh.  But take courage, my daughter, and above all, do not forget the advice I have given you.\"  Nitetis dried her tears as she answered: \"How can I ever thank you, O Croesus, my second father, my protector and adviser, for all your goodness?  Oh, forsake me not in the days to come! and if the path of my life should lead through grief and care, be near to help and guide me as you did on the mountain-passes of this long and dangerous journey.  A thousand times I thank thee, O my father!\"  And, as she said these words, the young girl threw her arms around the old man's neck and kissed him tenderly.  On entering the court-yard, a tall stout man, followed by a train of Asiatic serving-maidens, came forward to meet them.  This was Boges, the chief of the eunuchs, an important official at the Persian court.  His beardless face wore a smile of fulsome sweetness; in his ears hung costly jewelled pendents; his neck, arms, legs and his effeminately long garments glittered all over with gold chains and rings, and his crisp, stiff curls, bound round by a purple fillet, streamed with powerful and penetrating perfumes.  Making a low and reverential obeisance before Nitetis, and holding, the while, his fat hands overloaded with rings before his mouth, he thus addressed her: \"Cambyses, lord of the world, hath sent me to thee, O Queen, that I may refresh thy heart with the dew of his salutations.  He sendeth thee likewise by me, even by me the lowest of his servants, Persian raiment, that thou, as befitteth the consort of the mightiest of all rulers, mayest approach the gates of the Achaemenidae in Median garments.  These women whom thou seest are thy handmaidens, and only await thy bidding to transform thee from an Egyptian jewel into a Persian pearl.\"  The master of the caravansary then appeared, bearing, in token of welcome, a basket of fruits arranged with great taste.  Nitetis returned her thanks to both these men in kind and friendly words; then entering the house laid aside the dress and ornaments of her native land, weeping as she did so, allowed the strangers to unloose the plait of hair which hung down at the left side of her head, and was the distinctive mark of an Egyptian princess, and to array her in Median garments.       [In almost all the Egyptian pictures, the daughters and sons of the      Pharaohs are represented with these locks of hair, plaited and      reaching from the forehead to the neck.  Rosellini, Mon. stor. II.      123.  Lepsius, Denkmaler.  The daughter of Rameses II. is drawn      thus, and we have examples of the same in many other pictures.]  In the meantime, a repast had been commanded by the princes who accompanied her.  Eager and agile attendants rushed to the baggage- waggons, fetching thence, in a few moments, seats, tables, and golden utensils of all kinds.  The cooks vied with them and with each other, and as if by magic, in a short space of time a richly-adorned banquet for the hungry guests appeared, at which even the flowers were not wanting.  During the entire journey our travellers had lived in a similar luxury, as their beasts of burden carried every imaginable convenience, from tents of water-proof materials inwrought with gold, down to silver foot- stools; and in the vehicles which composed their train were not only bakers, cooks, cup-bearers and carvers, but perfumers, hair-dressers and weavers of garlands.  Beside these conveniences, a well-fitted up caravansary, or inn, was to be found about every eighteen miles along the whole route, where disabled horses could be replaced, the plantations around which afforded a refreshing shelter from the noonday heat, or their hearths a refuge from the snow and cold on the mountain-passes.  The kingdom of Persia was indebted for these inns (similar to the post- stations of modern days) to Cyrus, who had endeavored to connect the widely-distant provinces of his immense dominions by a system of well- kept roads, and a regular postal service.  At each of these stations the horseman carrying the letter-bag was relieved by a fresh man on a fresh steed, to whom the letters were transferred, and who, in his turn, darted off like the wind, to be again replaced at a similar distance by another rider.  These couriers, called Angari, were considered the swiftest horsemen in the world.       [Herodotus V. 14. 49-52.  Persian milestones are still to be found      among the ruins of the old king's road, which led from Nineveh to      Ecbatana.  The Kurds call them keli-Shin (blue pillars).]  Just as the banqueters, amongst whom Boges had taken his seat, were rising from table, the door opened, and a vision appeared, which drew prolonged exclamation of surprise from all the Persians present. Nitetis, clad in the glorious apparel of a Median princess, proud in the consciousness of her triumphant beauty, and yet blushing like a young girl at the wondering admiration of her friends, stood before them.  The attendants involuntarily fell on their faces before her, according to the custom of the Asiatics, and the noble Achaemenidae bowed low and reverentially; for it seemed as if Nitetis has laid aside all her former bashfulness and timidity with her simple Egyptian dress, and with the splendid silken garments of a Persian princess, flashing as they were with gold and jewels, had clothed herself in the majesty of a queen.  The deep reverence paid by all present seemed agreeable to her, and thanking her admiring friends by a gracious wave of the hand, she turned to the chief of the eunuchs and said in a kind tone but mingled with a touch of pride; \"Thou hast performed thy mission well; I am content with the raiment and the slaves that thou hast provided and shall commend thy circumspection to the king, my husband.  Receive this gold chain in the meanwhile, as a token of my gratitude.\"  The eunuch kissed the hem of her garment, and accepted the gift in silence.  This man, hitherto omnipotent in his office, had never before encountered such pride in any of the women committed to his charge.  Up to the present time all Cambyses' wives had been Asiatics, and, well aware of the unlimited power of the chief of the eunuchs, had used every means within their reach to secure his favor by flattery and submission.  Boges now made a second obeisance before Nitetis, of which, however, she took no notice, and turning to Croesus said: \"Neither words nor  gifts could ever suffice to"]]]
