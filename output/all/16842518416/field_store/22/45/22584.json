[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54309"],["title","Ancient Apostles (#5)"],["body","te: In Capernaum.]  Next morning, the people in Capernaum who knew that Peter and the other disciples had left the opposite shore without Jesus, were very much astonished to see Him in their midst, and said, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  \"Ye seek me,\" answered Jesus, \"not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.\"  [IMAGE: \"Lord, save me.\"]  \"Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you.\" [2]  [Sidenote: Sermon on the Bread of Life.]  He then delivered the famous sermon on the Bread of Life, part of which, as John remembered it, is recorded in John the sixth chapter. There were so many things spoken which the Jews could not understand, because of their prejudice, that they first became confused, then angry, and finally much offended. Those who had only a little faith, became influenced by the murmuring crowd, and said, \"We don't believe this man is the Son of God.\" Even some of His disciples turned away from the Truth, and \"walked no more with Him.\"  [Sidenote: Men Swerved by Doubt.]  The mass of angry men and women became much like the heaving sea that tossed the disciples the evening before. The winds of ridicule and the waves of discontent beat against the wavering disciples. As they looked upon these angry elements of human passion, their faith in Christ weakened, and they \"began to sink.\"  [Sidenote: Jesus Appeals to the Twelve.]  In vain, Jesus testified, \"It is I, the Son of man!\" They would not listen to Him, for He was to them only the son of Joseph the carpenter. As group after group turned their backs upon Him. He turned to the Twelve and said, \"Will ye also go away?\"  [Sidenote: Peter's Answer.]  Again it was Peter who broke the silence. With the others, he had looked at the noisy crowd, with the others he had listened to the angry words hurled at their Master. In the midst of this sea of human passion, shall he say, \"Lord, if it be Thee, bid me come unto Thee?\"  As if he wavered just a little, as if his faith had not yet become as firm as Jesus would have it become, he answered, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.\"  [Sidenote: Belief Matures into Knowledge.]  Then, as his assurance became stronger and his thoughts turned from the apostate crowd, he added, \"And we _believe_--and are _sure_ that thou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" Though there came not from Jesus' lips at this time, the word \"Blessed,\" yet, undoubtedly, He was gratified indeed to see the wavering faith of His disciples become steadfast in the heart of His Apostles, as if they would say,    \"Then come the wild weather, come sleet or come snow,   We will stand by each other, however it blow.   Oppression and sickness, and sorrow, and pain   Shall be to our true love as links in a chain.\"  Footnotes:  1. Matt. 14:28.  2. John 6:25-27.    LESSON 6  Peter's Testimony  [Sidenote: At Tyre and Sidon.]  Very soon after the people of Capernaum rejected the Savior, as narrated in the previous chapter, Jesus took His Twelve disciples westward across Galilee into the land of Tyre and Sidon, near the Mediterranean Sea. He desired to be alone with the Twelve that He might teach them many things pertaining to the kingdom of God, and thus prepare them for carrying on the work, after He should leave them.  There were many things happened on this tour which must have made it a memorable one to Peter and the other members of the Twelve. First, there was the Gentile woman who sought Jesus, and implored Him to come and heal her little daughter.  [Sidenote: A Syro-Phoenician Woman.]  Because she did not belong to the Jewish race, the disciples said: \"Master, send this woman away, for she is a trouble to us, crying out after us.\" Of course, they thought then, and a long time afterwards, that the Gospel was only for the Jews. But Jesus taught them that He loved the Gentile woman just as well as He did the Jews. But Peter did not fully understand.  [Sidenote: Other Miracles.]  From the coast of Tyre and Sidon, they traveled around Galilee and came to the east side of the Sea of Galilee. Here the disciples witnessed further manifestations of the power of Jesus. A deaf man who could not speak plainly was made to hear and to speak; and when the people heard about it, they followed Jesus and the Twelve out of the village into \"a desert place.\"  Again Peter saw a multitude of people fed; this time from only seven loaves and a few small fishes.  It would seem that after all these months with the Savior--hearing His parables, seeing His miracles, feeling His spirit and receiving His teachings daily, the apostles would surely understand the mission of the Redeemer.  [Sidenote: Jesus' Sayings Not Understood.]  But we read that after these \"four thousand men besides women and children\" were fed, the disciples entered with Jesus into a boat and rowed across to the west side of the lake. Here they met some Pharisees and Sadducees who began to oppose Jesus. When He and the Twelve were alone again, He said: \"Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.\"  You know what Jesus meant when He said this; but the disciples said to themselves, \"He says this 'because we have brought no bread.'\"  When Jesus saw that they did not comprehend Him, He said: \"How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?\"  \"Then understood they how that He bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.\" [1]  Undoubtedly, there were several among them whose testimony was becoming firm and unwavering. At any rate, we learn that just a few days later, the chief apostle gave evidence in words that could not be misunderstood, of his sure conviction that Christ was indeed the Son of the Living God.  [Sidenote: Peter's Memorable Testimony.]  They had gone northward to Caesarea Philippi at the foot of Mount Hermon. Here, Jesus, one day, asked His disciples this question: \"Who do men say that I, the Son of man, am?\"  They answered, \"Some say thou art John the Baptist. Some say thou art Elias, and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.\"  Then Jesus said, \"But who say ye that I am?\"  Simon Peter answered,  \"_Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God_.\"  There is no hesitancy now, no fear, no wavering, no \"we believe and are sure;\" but the unqualified and direct expression of a soul convinced of the truth: \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God.\"  \"_Blessed_ art thou, Simon Barjona,\" said Jesus, \"for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\" [2]  At last Jesus discovers the assurance in Peter for which He has been laboring many months to develop. He now knows that Peter's spirit has received divine assurance that all these miracles and mighty manifestations have been wrought by the power of God through His only Begotten Son. He knows that the testimony borne by Peter comes not from men but from God, and no matter what men may think or do, Peter will stand firm as a rock on this testimony.  \"I say unto thee,\" continued Jesus, \"that thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\"  [Sidenote: Christ's Church Built Upon Revelation.]  By that He meant that as Simon's name \"Peter\" means rock, so this testimony that comes by revelation shall be the rock upon which Christ's Church Christ's shall be built. Because when one receives such divine assurance in his soul that the gospel is true, no views of men, nor waves of temptation nor \"the power of hell\" can deprive him of it. You remember when Jesus first met Simon, He said He should be called \"the Rock.\" Ever since then it would seem that Jesus has been waiting for the time when Peter's testimony would be like his character--expressive and firm. That time has come; and Peter is now prepared to receive a greater responsibility.  [Sidenote: Keys of the Kingdom]  \"And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"  One key was to open the door of the gospel to the Gentiles, but it took quite a while before Peter knew how to use it.  It is one thing to know that the gospel is true; it is quite another thing to comprehend its purpose and significance.  [Sidenote: Jesus Foretells His Death.]  From that time, Jesus began to tell the Apostles that He would suffer and die, and that they must carry on the preaching of the gospel. He told them Jesus that in a few months He would be taken by the chief priests, would be killed, and would rise again the third day.  [Sidenote: Misguided Zeal.]  When Peter heard this, he took the Savior off to one side, and still hoping that Jesus would some day be a king, said, \"Far be it from Thee, Lord; this shall not be unto Thee.\" As much as to say, \"They shall not take you if we can prevent it.\"  [Sidenote: Rebuked Peter.]  Brave but uncomprehending Peter! He does not realize that it is necessary for his Lord to die, before His mission of redemption is fulfilled. So he would, in his blinded love, prevent his Master from completing His work! The Savior perceiving this, turned and said unto Peter, \"Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offense unto me; for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.\" [3]  This was a severe rebuke, and it must have impressed Peter deeply with the thought that his plan was not God's plan; and he no doubt realized that there was yet very much for him to learn before he could carry out the great responsibility that the Lord had this day conferred upon him. But in his zeal to save Jesus from death, he erred, though only in love; and we can fancy hearing one of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54309"],["title","Ancient Apostles (#6)"],["body","others saying, in effect, in commendation of Peter's anxiety,    \"If he be not one that truly loves you,   That errs in ignorance, and not in cunning,   I have no judgment in an honest man's face.\"  At any rate, we know that Jesus was pleased with Peter's testimony, and with his love, and would patiently wait the unfolding of his mind in the comprehension of the gospel plan.

LESSON 7  A Marvelous Manifestation  [Sidenote: The Holy Mount.]  In the region of Caesarea Philippi, where Peter gave his testimony and received a blessing and power from his Master, is a high mountain peak of the Lebanon range, known as Mt. Hermon. Peter called it the Holy Mount. When you learn of what took place there, you will agree that Peter gave it a good name.  One writer who has visited this region tells us that the \"glittering splendor\" of this peak, \"towering like a giant above all other peaks of the Lebanon range, its head always covered with snow, is visible from every direction. It is in clear view as far south as the Dead Sea. It was probably the highest spot of earth on which our Lord ever stood, and from which He had His most extensive view. From it He looked down upon Galilee, where He had taught and wrought, where He had been received by the few and rejected by the many.\" [1]  [Sidenote: Self-Denial Necessary.]  Six days, (Luke says eight) had passed since Peter had borne his great testimony--six days, undoubtedly of important instruction to Peter and the other eleven. It was probably during that time that the Twelve learned that to be a true follower of Jesus, one must be able to deny one's self of many desires and appetites--one must learn to control feelings of anger, jealousy, and other passions. Said the Savior, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  \"For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it:  \"And whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.  \"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\" [2]  These and many other glorious truths, Peter undoubtedly heard during that memorable week at Caesarea Philippi.  But he was to see and hear things even more glorious.  Still perplexed over some of the sayings of Jesus, still wondering why it was necessary for their Lord to \"suffer many things, and be rejected\" and even put to death, Peter and James and John one night, accompanied Jesus up the side of Mt. Hermon. It appears from the brief accounts we have of this incident that they spent several hours in solemn conversation, the apostles \"asking Him many questions concerning His sayings.\"  [Sidenote: The Transfiguration.]  Twilight deepened into darkness, and the shades of night completely hid Mt. Hermon from the sleeping vales below. Perhaps the three leaders became drowsy; and as their Lord withdrew a little apart to pray, they may have fallen, for a moment or two, into a sleep--Luke tells us that they were \"heavy with sleep.\" Be that as it may, we know that when their eyes were turned toward Jesus, \"He was transfigured before them. And His raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so white as no fuller on earth can white them.\"  \"And there appeared unto them Elias and Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.\" [3]  [Sidenote: Death but a Change.]  These heavenly personages talked, not _to_ Jesus but _with_ him, about His approaching death, and resurrection, one of the vital things in Christ's ministry which Peter could not comprehend. Surely after this glorious vision of two heavenly beings. Death would lose much if not all its terror for Peter, James, and John. They would know that even if wicked men did kill their Master, that He would still live and still be their Lord and Savior. Death, to them, after this, would be just a \"departure.\" They would realize that \"Death hath nothing terrible in it, but what life hath made so.\"  [Sidenote: \"It is Good to be Here.\"]  Peter by inspiration had received assurances that Jesus was indeed the Christ; now he witnessed a visible sign of his testimony. Desiring to have a monument to this outward sign, something which other eyes beside his might behold, he cried, out of the impulsiveness of his heart, \"Master, it is good for us to be here, and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.\" But suddenly, as Moses and Elias \"departed,\" a cloud overshadowed them and a voice came _out of the cloud_ saying, \"_This_ is My beloved Son hear Him!\"  [Sidenote: Sources of Testimony.]  Peter's testimony was, by this time, made strong and his faith proved: [4]  (1) By the confirmation of miracles; (2) By seeing heavenly beings; (3) By inspiration; (4) By hearing not only the testimony of these angels but the Divine testimony of God Himself!  Surely his faith is now built upon the Rock, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it!  This is true; and henceforth, we may safely conclude as we follow his career, that not a shadow of doubt of the divinity of Christ's mission ever crosses Peter's mind.  When we think of Peter having been in almost daily contact with the Savior of men, we may conclude that his testimony grew very slowly, but if so, like the oak tree that grows slowly to, it was all the more enduring.  [Sidenote: Purity and Sincerity Essentials.]  After all, Peter's experience is the experience that will come to nearly all the boys and girls who read these pages. The knowledge of truth, and the testimony of the Gospel may come gradually to most of them. The one great lesson for them to learn even in youth is, that _purity of thought_, and a _sincere heart seeking_ the Savior's _guidance daily_ will lead to a testimony of the truth of Christ's Gospel as sure and permanent as that which Peter possessed as he descended Mt. Hermon after seeing the transfiguration of Christ, and hearing the voice of God testify to His divinity.  But _knowing_ that Jesus is the Savior of mankind, did not give Peter a comprehension of the Gospel plan. In this regard, he had yet much to learn. And, it may be, that his strength of character, or shall we say, his judgment, was not yet so sound as it should have been in a man whose whole life should be as firm as a rock.  In the strength of his testimony, and in a somewhat resigned attitude to the fate that sooner or later was to befall his Master, Peter continued to ask many questions, pertaining to the vital aspects of Christ's mission. One of these which the apostles asked themselves as they came down towards the crowd at the foot of the hill, was, What did the Master mean when He said the Son of Man would rise from the dead?  While the Savior was answering this question, and explaining prophecies relating to it, they came to the place where, the evening before, they had left the other disciples. A great multitude had gathered about them, and the scribes were questioning them.  [Sidenote: The Afflicted Boy.]  In the midst of this crowd was a little boy sorely afflicted by an evil spirit. When he was \"possessed,\" he fell to the ground, foamed at the mouth, gnashed his teeth, and pined away. The father met Jesus, and begged Him to relieve his poor boy, and added that the disciples had tried but could not.  \"How long a time is it,\" asked Jesus, \"since this came unto him?\" \"When a child,\" the father said; \"and ofttimes it hath cast him into fire and into the waters, to destroy him, but if thou canst, I ask thee to have compassion on us, and help us.\"  Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and the little boy was healed.  [Sidenote: A Contrast.]  To Peter, James, and John what a contrast was this scene to the one they beheld the night before on the Mount! Here was manifest the power of the evil one, causing suspicions, pain, agony, death; _there_ was manifest the power of the Holy One, proclaiming happiness, peace, glory, and immortality! Such have been the results of these two powers as they have influenced the lives of men in all ages. Such is the result today. A vital question for us is, Shall we hover around the foothills of sin where the evil one is triumphant, or shall we at least show a willingness to climb the mount of Holiness and let God transform our lives?    \"'Tis not for man to trifle; life is brief,   And sin is here.   Our age is but the falling leaf,   A dropping tear.   We have no time to sport away the hours,   All must be earnest in a world like ours.\"  Footnotes:  1. Weed.  2. Matt. 16:24-26.  3. Matt. 17:1-8; Mark 9:1-6.  4. Peter 1:7.    LESSON 8  Lessons in True Leadership.  \"Character is built out of circumstances. From exactly the same materials one man builds palaces, while another builds hovels.\"  Between the Transfiguration and the last eventful week of the Savior's life on earth, there are only a few recorded instances in scripture with which Peter is personally mentioned. It is significant, however, that nearly everyone of these, bears either directly or indirectly upon the moulding of Peter's character as an Apostolic leader. Peter knows that Jesus is the Christ that should come, but has he strength to defend Him in word and deed? Does he comprehend the divine principles of the Gospel sufficiently to manifest them in his daily life and conversation and in all his associations with his fellowmen? With the probable exception of the tribute money incident, which emphasized for Peter the divine Sonship of his Master, all the lessons following bear directly upon strength of character and principles of conduct.  TRIBUTE  [Sidenote: An Ancient Law.]  In those days, there was a tax levied upon every male Jew of twenty years old and upwards for the maintenance of the Temple and its services. This law had been in force ever since the days of the children of Israel when the great lawgiver, Moses, said a \"half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord.\" [1]  Matthew tells us"]]]
