Before his mental vision rose the little mistress of the garden of Epicurus.  He saw the sparkle of her large blue eyes, which never ceased to question, yet appeared to contain the mystery of the world.  He fancied he heard once more the silvery cadence of her voice and the bewitching magic of her pure, childlike laughter, and it was hard to remember what she had become.  Snatched away from the present, yet conscious that Fate had granted him a great boon in this sorrowful hour, he moved on at her side and led her through the main entrance, the spacious inner court-yard of the palace. At the rear was the great door opening into the Queen's apartments, before which Mardion, Iras, and their companions had already stationed themselves.  At the left was a smaller one leading into the wing occupied by the children.  Archibius was about to conduct Cleopatra across the lighted court-yard, but she motioned towards the children's rooms, and he understood her.  At the threshold her hand fell from his arm, and when he bowed as if to retire, she said kindly: \"There is Charmian.  You both deserve to accompany me to the spot where childhood is dreaming and peace of mind and painlessness have their abode.  But respect for the Queen has prevented the brother and sister from greeting each other after so long a separation.  Do so now!  Then, follow me.\"  While speaking, she hastened with the swift step of youth into the atrium and up the staircase which led to the sleeping-rooms of the princes and princesses.  Archibius and Charmian obeyed her bidding; the brother clasped his sister affectionately in his arms, and in hurried tones, with tears streaming from her eyes, she informed him that to her all seemed lost.  Antony had behaved in a manner for which no words of condemnation or regret were adequate.  Probably he would follow Cleopatra; the fleet, and perhaps the army also, were destroyed.  Her fate lay in the hands of Octavianus.  Then she preceded him towards the staircase, where Iras was standing with a tall Syrian, who bore a striking resemblance to Philostratus, Barine's former husband.  It was his brother Alexas, the trusted favourite of Mark Antony.  His place should now have been with him, and Archibius asked his sister with a hasty look how this man chanced to be in the Queen's train.  \"His skill in reading the stars,\" was the reply.  \"His flattering tongue. He is a parasite of the worst kind, but he tells her many things, he diverts her, and she tolerates him near her person.\"  As soon as Iras saw the direction in which Cleopatra had turned, she had hastened after her to accompany her to the children.  The Syrian Alexas had stopped her to express his joy in meeting her again.  Even before the outbreak of the war he had devoted himself zealously to her, and he now plainly showed that during the long period of separation his feelings had by no means cooled.  Like his brother, he had a head too small for his body, but his well-formed features were animated by a pair of eyes sparkling with a keen, covetous expression.  Iras, too, seemed glad to welcome the favourite, but ere the brother and sister reached the staircase she left him to embrace Charmian, her aunt and companion, with the affection of a daughter.  They found the Queen in the anteroom of the children's apartments. Euphronion, their tutor, had awaited her there, and hurriedly gave, in the most rapturous terms, his report of them and the wonderful gifts which became more and more apparent in each, now as a heritage from their mother, now from their father.  Cleopatra had interrupted the torrent of his enthusiastic speech with many a question, meanwhile endeavouring to loose the veil wound about her head; but the little hands, unaccustomed to the task, failed.  Iras noticed it from the stairs and, hastening up the last steps, skilfully released her from the long web of lace.  The Queen acknowledged the service by a gracious nod, but when the chief eunuch opened the door leading into the children's rooms, she called joyously to the brother and sister, \"Come!\"  The tutor, who was obliged to leave the charge of his pupils' sleeping apartments to the eunuchs and nurses, drew back, but Iras felt it a bitter affront to be excluded from this visit.  Her cheeks flushed and paled; her thin lips were more firmly compressed, and she gazed intently at the basket of fruit in the mosaic floor at her feet as if she were counting the cherries that filled it. But she suddenly pushed the little curls back from her forehead, darted swiftly down the stairs, and called to Alexas just as he was about to leave the atrium.  The Syrian hastened towards her, extolling the good fortune that made his sun rise for him a second time that night, but she cut him short with the words; \"Cease this foolish love-making.  It would be far better for us both to become allies in serious, bitter earnest.  I am ready.\"  \"So am I!\" cried the Syrian rapturously, pressing his hand upon his heart.  Meanwhile Cleopatra had entered the chamber where the children lay sleeping.  Deep silence pervaded the lofty hall hung with bright-hued carpets, and softly lighted by three lamps with rose-colored globes.  An arch, supported by pillars of Libyan marble, divided the wide space.  In the first, near a window closely muffled with draperies, stood two ivory beds, surmounted with crowns of gold and silver set with pearls and turquoises.  Around the edge, carved by the hands of a great artist, ran a line of happy children dancing to the songs of birds in blossoming bushes.  The couches were separated by a heavy curtain which the eunuchs had raised at the approach of the Queen.  Cleopatra could now see them all at a single glance, and the picture was indeed one of exquisite charm; for on these beautiful couches slept the twins, the ten-year-old children of Cleopatra and Antony--Antonius Helios and Cleopatra Selene.  The girl was pink and white, fair and wonderfully lovely; the boy no less beautiful, but with ebon-black hair, like his father.  Both curly heads were turned towards the side, and rested on a dimpled hand pressed upon the silken pillow.  Upon a third bed, beyond the arch, was Alexander, the youngest prince, a lovely boy of six, the Queen's darling.  After gazing a long while at the twins, and pressing a light kiss upon cheeks flushed with slumber, she turned to the youngest child and sank beside his couch as if forced to bend the knee before some apparition which Heaven had vouchsafed to her.  Tears streamed from her eyes as, drawing the child carefully towards her, she kissed his mouth, eyes, and cheeks, and then laid him gently back upon the pillows.  The boy, however, did not instantly relapse into slumber, but threw his little plump arms around his mother's neck, murmuring incomprehensible words. She joyously submitted to his caresses, till sleep again overpowered him, and his little hands fell back upon the bed.  She lingered a short time longer, with her brow resting on the ivory of the couch, praying for this child and his brother and sister.  When she rose again her cheeks were wet with tears, and she pressed her hand upon her breast.  Then, beckoning to Charmian and Archibius, she motioned towards Alexander and the twins, saying, as she saw tears glittering in the eyes of both: \"I know you have lost this happiness for my sake.  For each one of these children a great empire would not be too high a price; for them all----What does earth contain that I would not bestow?  Yet what can I still call my own?\"  Her smiling face clouded as she asked the question.  The vision of the lost battle again rose before her mind.  Her own power was lost, forfeited, and with it the independence of the native land which she loved.  Rome was already stretching out her hand to add it to the others as a new province.  But this should not be!  Her twin children yonder, sleeping beneath crowns, must wear them!  And the boy slumbering on the pillows?  How many kingdoms Antony had bestowed!  What remained for her to give?  Again she bent to the child.  A beautiful dream must have hovered over him, for he was smiling in his sleep.  A flood of maternal love welled up in her agitated heart, and, as she saw the companions of her childhood also gazing tenderly at the little steeper, she remembered the days of her own youth, and the quiet happiness which she had enjoyed in her garden of Epicurus.  Power and splendour had begun for her beyond its confines, but the greater the heights of worldly grandeur she attained, the more distant, the more irrecoverable became the consciousness of the happiness which she had once gratefully enjoyed, and for which she had never ceased to long.  And as she now gazed once more at the peaceful, smiling face, whence all pain and anxiety seemed worlds away, and all the love which her heart contained appeared to be pouring towards him, the question arose in her mind whether this boy, for whom she possessed no crown, might not be the only happy mortal of them all-happy in the sense of the master.  Deeply moved by this thought, she turned to Archibius and Charmian, exclaiming in a subdued tone, in order not to rouse the sleeper: \"Whatever destiny may await us, I commend this child to your special love and care.  If Fate denies him the lustre of the crown and the elation of power, teach him to enjoy that other happiness, which-- how long ago it is!--your father unfolded to his mother.\"  Archibius kissed her robe, and Charmian her hands; but Cleopatra, drawing a long breath, said: \"The mother has already taken too much time from the Queen.  I have ordered the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5476"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 04 (#6)"],["body"," of my arrival to be kept from Caesarion. This was well.  The most important matters will be settled before our meeting.  Everything relating to me and to the state must be decided within an hour.  But, first, I am something more than mother and Queen. The woman also asserts her claim.  I will find time for you, my friend, to-morrow!-To my chamber first, Charmian.  But you need rest still more than I.  Go with your brother.  Send Iras to me.  She will be glad to use her skilful fingers again in her mistress's service.\"     CHAPTER XI.  The Queen had left her bath.  Iras had arranged the still abundant waves of her hair, now dark-brown in hue, and robed her magnificently to receive the dignitaries whom, spite of the late hour of the night, she expected.  How wonderfully she had retained her beauty!  It seemed as if Time had not ventured to touch this masterpiece of feminine loveliness; yet the Greek's keen eye detected here and there some token of the vanishing spell of youth.  She loved her mistress, yet her inmost soul rejoiced whenever  she detected in her the same changes which began to appear in herself, the woman of seven-and-twenty, so many years her sovereign's junior.  She would  gladly have given Cleopatra everything at her command, yet she felt as if she must praise Nature for an act of justice, when she perceived that even her royal favourite was not wholly relieved from the law which applied to all.  \"Cease your flattery,\" said Cleopatra, smiling mournfully. \"They say that the works of the Pharaohs here on the Nile flout Time. The inexorable destroyer is less willing to permit this from the Queen of Egypt.  These are grey hairs, and they came from this head, however eagerly you may deny it.  Whose save my own are these lines around the corners of the eyes and on the brow?  What say you to the tooth which my lips do not hide so kindly as you assert?  It was injured the night before the luckless battle.  My dear, faithful, skilful Olympus, the prince of leeches, is the only one who can conceal such things.  But it would not do to take the old man to the war, and Glaucus is far less adroit.  How I missed Olympus during those fatal hours!  I seemed a monster even to myself, and he--Antony's eye is only too keen for such matters.  What is the love of men?  A blackened tooth may prove its destruction.  An aspect obnoxious to the gaze will pour water on the fiercest fire.  What hours I experienced, Iras!  Many a glance from him seemed an insult, and, besides, my heart was filled with torturing anxiety.  \"Something had evidently come between us!  I felt it.  The trouble began soon after he left Alexandria.  It gnawed my soul like a worm, and now that I am here again I must see clearly.  He will follow me in a few days, I know.  Pinarius Scarpus, with his untouched legions, is in Paraetonium, whither he went.  At Taenarum he resolved to retire from the world which he, on whom it had bestowed so much that is great, hates because he has given it cause for many a shake of the head.  But the old spirit woke again, and if Fortune, usually so faithful, still aids him, a large force will soon join the new African army.  The Asiatic princes-- But the ruler of the state must be silent.  I entered this room to give the woman her just rights, and the woman shall have them.  He will soon be here.  He cannot live without me.  It is not alone the beaker of Nektanebus which draws him after me!\"  \"When the greatest of the great, Julius Caesar, sued for your love in Alexandria, and Antony on the Cydnus, you did not possess the goblet,\" observed Iras.  \"It is two years since Anubis permitted you to borrow the masterpiece from the temple treasures, and within a few days you will be obliged to restore it.  That a mysterious spell emanates from the cup is certain, but one still more powerful dwells in the magic of your own nature.\"  \"Would that it might assert itself to-day!\" cried the Queen.  \"At any rate the power of the beaker impelled Antony to do many things.  I am not vain enough to believe that it was love, that it was solely the spell of my own personality which drew him to me in that disastrous hour.  That battle, that incomprehensible, disgraceful battle!  You were ill, and could not see our fleet when it set sail; but even experienced spectators said that handsomer, larger vessels were never beheld.  I was right in insisting that the decision of the conflict should be left to them.  I was entitled to call them mine.  Had we conquered, what a proud delight it would have been to say, 'The weapons which you gave to the man you loved gained him the sovereignty of the world!'  Besides, the stars had assured me that good fortune would attend us on the sea.  They had given the same message to Anubis here and to Alexas upon Antony's galley.  I also trusted the spell of the goblet, which had already compelled Antony to do many things he opposed.  So I succeeded in having the decision of the conflict left to the fleet, but the prediction was false, false, false!--how utterly, was to be proved only too soon.  \"If I had only been told in time what I learned later!  After the defeat people were more loquacious.  That one remark of a veteran commander of the foot-soldiers would probably have sufficed to open my eyes.  He had asked Mark Antony why he fixed his hopes on miserable wood, exclaiming, 'Let the Phoenician's and Egyptians war on the water, but leave us the land where we are accustomed, with our feet firmly set upon the earth, to fight, conquer, or die!'  This alone, I am sure, would have changed my resolve in a happy hour.  But it was kept from me.  \"The conflict began.  Our troops had lost patience.  The left wing of the fleet advanced.  At first I watched the battle eagerly, with a throbbing heart.  How proudly the huge galleys moved forward!  Everything was going admirably.  Antony had made an address, assuring the warriors that, even without soldiers, our ships would destroy the foe by their mere height and size.  What orator can so carry his hearers with him!  I, too, was still fearless.  Who cherishes anxiety when confidently expecting victory?  When he went on board his own ship, after bidding me farewell far less cordially than usual, I became more troubled.  I thought it was evident that his love was waning.  What had I become since we left Alexandria, and Olympus no longer attended me!  Matters could not continue in this way.  I would leave the direction of the war to him, and vanish from his eyes.  After he had looked into the beaker of Nektanebus, he yielded to my will, but often with indignation.  The unconcealed, ineffaceable lines, and the years, the cruel years!\"  \"What thoughts are these?\" cried Iras.  \"Let me take oath, my sovereign mistress, that as you stand before me--\"  \"Thanks to this toilet-table and the new compounds of Olympus in these boxes!  At that time, I tell you, I was fairly startled at the sight of my own face.  Trouble does not enhance beauty, and what condemnation the Romans had heaped on the woman who meddled with war, the craft of man! I had answers for them, but I would not endure it longer.  I had previously determined to hold aloof from the battle on land; but even at the commencement of the conflict, spite of its favourable promise, I longed to leave Antony and return to the children.  They do not heed the colour of their mother's hair, nor her wrinkles; and he, when he had looked for and called me in vain, would feel for the first time what he possessed in me, would miss me, and with the longing the old love would awaken with fresh ardour.  As soon as the fleet had gained the victory I would have the prow of my galley turned southward and, without a farewell, exclaiming only, 'We will meet in Alexandria!' set sail for Egypt.  \"I summoned Alexas, who had remained with me, and ordered him to give me a signal as soon as the battle was decided in our favour.  I remained on deck.  Then I saw the ships of the foe describing a wide circle.  The nauarch told me that Agrippa was trying to surround us.  This roused a feeling of discomfort.  I began to repent having meddled with men's work.  \"Antony looked across at me from his galley.  I waved my hand to point out the peril, but instead of eagerly and lovingly answering the greeting, as of yore, he turned his back, and in a short time after the wildest uproar arose around me.  One ship became entangled with another, planks and poles shattered with a loud crash.  Shouts, the cries  and moans of the combatants and the wounded, mingled with the thunder of the stones hurled by the catapults, and the sharp notes of the signals which sounded like calls for help.  Two soldiers, stricken by arrows, fell beside me.  It was horrible!  Yet my courage remained steadfast, even when a squadron--it was commanded by Aruntius--pressed upon the fleet. I saw another line of galleys steering directly towards us, and a Roman vessel assailed by one of mine--I had named her the Selene--turn on her side and sink.  This pleased me and seemed like the first presage of victory.  I again ordered Alexas to have the ship's prow turned as soon as the result of the battle was decided.  Ere I had ceased speaking, Jason, the steward--you know him--appeared with refreshments.  I took the beaker, but, ere I could raise it to my lips, he fell to the deck with a cloven skull, mingling his blood with the spilled juice of the grape. My blood seemed fairly to freeze in my veins, and Alexas, trembling and deadly pale, asked, 'Do you command us to quit the battle?'  \"Every fibre of my being urged me to give the order, but I controlled myself, and asked the nauarch, who was standing on the bridge before me, 'Are we gaining the advantage?'  The reply was a positive 'Yes.'  I thought the fitting time had come, and called to him to steer the galley southward.  But the man did not seem to understand.  Meanwhile the noise of the conflict had grown louder and louder.  So, in spite of"]]]
