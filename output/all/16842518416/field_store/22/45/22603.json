It will be remembered he was but a boy fourteen years of age when this event occurred. He had been, previously, in a disturbed state of mind concerning religion. In the neighborhood where he dwelt there had been great excitement, on account of a religious revival. At the meetings he attended he learned that the various sects were very much opposed to each other. In the midst of this tumult and war of words and opinions, Joseph felt grieved and asked himself, \"What is to be done? Who of all these are right? And how shall I know?\"  One day Joseph read in the first chapter of James as follows:   \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men  liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"  Using Joseph's own words, he said:   \"Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart  of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with  great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again  and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did.  * * * Unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never  know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood  the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all  confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible. At  length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness  and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of  God. * * * So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of  God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning  of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred  and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such  an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the  attempt to pray vocally. After I had retired to the place where I had  previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself  alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart  to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by  some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing  influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak.  Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as  if I were doomed to sudden destruction. But exerting all my powers to  call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had  seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into  despair and abandon myself to destruction--not to an imaginary ruin,  but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had  such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being--just at  this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my  head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until  it fell upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered  from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I  saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description,  standing above me in the air. One of them spoke unto me, calling me by  name and said, pointing to the other, 'This is my beloved Son, hear  him!'   \"My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all  the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner,  therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak,  than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which  of all the sects was right--for at this time it had never entered  into my heart that all were wrong--and which I should join. I was  answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong;  and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were  an abomination in his sight. * * 'They teach for doctrine the  commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the  power thereof.' He again forbade me to join any of them; and many  other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time.   \"Some time afterwards the vision was made known to a Methodist  preacher, who treated it with contempt, saying it was all from the  devil; that there was no such thing as visions or revelations in these  days; that all such things had ceased with the Apostles, and that  there never would be any more of them.\"  The ministers and others persecuted him, which caused him deep sorrow, although an obscure boy, and under the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily labor. But, strange to say, he became very prominent and conspicuous, and evil was spoken of him continually. Nevertheless, he had seen a vision, and, like Paul before King Agrippa, related the account of the vision he had, when he \"saw a light and heard a voice.\" Still, there were a few who believed him. Some said he was dishonest; others said he was mad; and he (like Joseph) was ridiculed and reviled; but all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision--he knew he had--and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise. Joseph Smith said:   \"I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God?  or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen?  for I had seen a vision. I knew it. I knew that God knew it; and I  could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so  doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.\"  For over three years Joseph continued his labors daily until the 21st of September, 1823. After retiring to his bed in quite a serious mood, he shortly betook himself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for a manifestation of his standing before Him. While thus engaged he received the following vision, using his own words:   \"While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light  appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was  lighter than at noonday, when a personage appeared at my bed-side;  he had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness, * * * his hands  were naked, and his arms also a little above the wrist, * * * his head  and neck were also bare. * * * his whole person was glorious beyond  description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was  exceedingly light, but no so very bright as immediately around his  person. When I first looked upon him I was afraid, but the fear soon  left me.   \"He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent  from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that  God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good  and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues; or that it should  be both good and evil spoken of among all people. * * * While he  was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened to  my mind that I could see the place where the plates were deposited,  and that so clearly and distinctly, that I knew the place again when  I visited it. After this communication, I saw the light in the room  begin to gather immediately around the person of him who had been  speaking to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again  left dark, except just around him, when instantly I saw, as it were, a  conduit open right up into heaven, and he ascended up till he entirely  disappeared, and the room was left as it had been before this heavenly  light had made its appearance.\"  This vision was repeated three times during the night, and the angel each time instructed him of great events, such as famine, war, pestilence and grievous judgments, which were to come in this generation. He also reminded him that his name should be known for good and evil, and that wicked men would seek to destroy him, which was literally fulfilled.  In 1517, Mexico, then unknown to the world, though teeming with its millions of Lamanites, was discovered by Cortez; and the gold plates that Joseph Smith received contain their history, which I advise all men to read.  Furthermore, the angel said that the fulness of the everlasting gospel was contained in the record that was about to be delivered to him, which was the same as that taught by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants of Jerusalem.  Thus comes unto us knowledge unveiling the mystery surrounding the American Indians which has puzzled the most profound historians of our age to explain. For all this useful knowledge we are indebted to God, the giver of all good.  Although the Prophet was manifestly unlearned at this time, as evinced by the spelling written by him over the seven lines of characters, shown in another place in this pamphlet, he afterwards became proficient as a scholar, and studied the classic languages at the School of the Prophets in Kirtland, Ohio. This school was established, by command of the Lord, for the purpose of educating the Elders and others in the history of nations, countries and people; thus laying up treasures of knowledge and useful information.  The Prophet, however, was not dependent upon scholastic learning, for God revealed to him line upon line, here a little and there a little, enabling him to become efficient in organizing the Church in its perfect order; so much so, that the learned theologians and others of the present day are adopting many of the doctrines revealed to him.  The description of the breast-pate, as given by the mother of Joseph, is very interesting. She was favored with handling it, but it was covered with a thin muslin cloth, through which she could see the glittering gold. It was concave on one side and convex on the other. It would extend from the neck downwards as far as the center of the stomach of a man of extraordinary size. Attached to it were four straps of the same material, for the purpose of fastening it to the breast; two of these ran back so as to fasten over the shoulders, and the other two were designed to fasten to the waist. Mother Smith said the straps were the width of her "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],["title","Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#8)"],["body","fingers, for she measured them. They had holes in the ends for convenience in fastening. Although the Urim and Thummim and breast-plate go together, it was not necessary for them always to remain attached to each other. Mother Lucy Smith also saw and handled the interpreters, and described them as \"two diamonds set in silver bows, much like old-fashioned spectacles, only much larger.\" She also said that the breast plate was worth more than $500.  Soon after Joseph received the plates and other articles, the angel left him to manage the work entrusted to him, which responsibility he felt very seriously. He first concealed the secret treasure in a secluded place, excepting the Urim and Thummim, which he kept with him. Soon after Joseph arrived at home he explained to his parents the necessity of keeping the sacred relics under lock and key, and until such time as proper precaution was taken, he had hidden them away securely. Then said the mother:  \"Order a chest at once.\"  \"But we have not a dollar in the house to pay for it,\" said Joseph.  \"God will provide, my son,\" said the confidential mother. \"Go, promise part cash and part trade,\" which was done, and the same day Mrs. Wells, of Macedon, gave Joseph work at digging a well, promising cash for the work. The mother reminded the son of the Lord's providence, so soon fulfilled.  While Joseph was working for Mrs. Wells, to supply their daily wants and to pay for the chest in which the plates were to be secured, a mob of twelve men, headed by Mr. Willard Chase, a Methodist class leader, and a certain conjurer whose special business was to divine the hiding place of the gold plates, were heard to say:  \"We will have that gold Bible in spite of all the devils in hell.\"  Father Smith, knowing that the plates were secreted away from home, felt deep anxiety concerning their safety, and he induced Emma, the Prophet's wife, who was living with the family, to go on horseback to give warning to Joseph of the intentions of the mob. From an impression Joseph had, he looked with the Urim and Thummim, which he had with him, after which, meeting his wife with a smile, he informed her that the plans of the mob would prove futile; that the plates were safe. However, he returned home with his wife, and in the evening, after procuring the chest, Joseph started for the plates, but as he was returning home with them, he was waylaid and attacked three times, but he finally escaped, although bruised and weary, bringing the plates home in safety.  This was one of his first lessons and a fulfillment of the angel's words to him.  Not long after this first experience, the Prophet was warned of a second attempt to rob him of the treasure.  On this occasion he remembered the angel's charge in regard to using every precaution, and the promise that if he was prayerful and careful he should not lose them. A stone of the old-fashioned hearth was removed and the plates and the breast-plate were concealed in a cavity under the hearth. The stone had just been replaced, when a large armed mob came rushing uproariously around the house. The door was thrown open and were in the house, Joseph at their head, rushed out, when the mob fled without their booty. A third attempt to obtain the plates was also unsuccessfully made. This time the treasures were hid in some flax in the loft of a cooper shop, and an empty box was hidden under the floor. It was said that a young woman, aided by a peepstone, pointed out the cooper shop as the repository of the \"Gold Bible.\" During the night the place was rummaged, the floor torn up and the box broken to pieces. This was another experience, but the treasures were still safely preserved. It was manifested to the Prophet that a facsimile of characters must be copied and sent to the most learned professors of the country, and that Martin Harris should be the bearer of them. Before the Prophet could accomplish this desired object, however, he was compelled to seek peace in Pennsylvania, for the whole country around seemed determined to give Joseph no peace whatever. While the servant of God was on his way from his father's house, to seek a peaceful retreat, he was stopped on the highway twice by a mob of fifty men, but as the necessary precaution had been observed by hiding the plates in a barrel of beans, again they were preserved.  The trying scenes which this young man had to pass through, having been compelled to leave his home and country by reason of the persecutions heaped upon him in his young married life, were of a heart-rending character, besides the labor of translating the Book of Mormon, and organizing the Church, which he was instructed to do. It became all the more difficult to perform this great work because new revelation came so much in contact with the traditions of the different religious sects of the day, each one differing from the other, yet each one claiming to be the right Church. Just imagine this unlearned youth, possessing no funds only as he earned them by his daily labor, under these circumstances, with increasing responsibilities of family, and home. Without God's aid it would border on insanity to entertain a faint hope of success in so stupendous an undertaking. Had it not been that the Lord had promised to help him, his heart would have failed him by the way. But there was encouragement found in the words of the prophet Isaiah, 29th chapter, where the prophet, speaking of the very time and condition surrounding the youth, used these words:  \"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish ... They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.\" (Isaiah 29:14, 24)  Tens of thousands have proven those words to be true. I was personally favored with many conversations with the three witnesses whom God raised up, one of whom was Martin Harris, a near neighbor of Joseph Smith. In 1871, while I was emigrating Martin Harris from Kirkland, Ohio, during our journey of over 2,000 miles, he related many little incidents which occurred in those early times.  One of the incidents that interested me most was when, on a certain occasion, Martin's neighbors prevailed upon him to drink some wine with them with the evident intention of getting him to deny his testimony to the Book of Mormon. Martin drank but little, while his neighbors partook more freely. When they were in high glee they asked him if he really believed that he saw the angel of which he had testified.  \"No,\" said Martin, \"I do not believe it.\"  \"Now,\" said they, \"we know you are an honest man.\"  \"Stop a moment,\" said Martin, \"and properly understand me. My reason for not believing it is that knowledge surpasses belief. Gentlemen, it was in open day when I saw the angel and I testify to you that I know my testimony is true. I do not believe it is true; I know it is.\"  The reader can imagine the chagrin that his neighbors felt at this unexpected outcome of their efforts to entrap him.  Martin told me that, knowing the indigent circumstances of the Prophet, he felt it was his duty to aid in the great work by giving Joseph fifty dollars to help advance the Lord's work. This occurred just prior to Joseph's leaving Manchester for Harmony, Penn. The Lord raised tip a friend in time of need. The Lord remembered Martin for the timely aid, although it was many days afterwards. Martin also stated that he had hired Joseph to work for him on his farm many times and paid him fifty cents per day, which was the usual price paid for hired help at that time. He also said that he had hoed corn with Joseph often, and that the latter was a good hand to work.  The Prophet found a short season of rest with his father-in-law at Harmony, Penn., where he succeeded in copying the seven lines of characters, which, by a previous arrangement, were taken to Professor Anthon, of New York, as explained in the next chapter.  Soon after Martin Harris returned from New York, he commenced to write for the Prophet while he translated from the gold plates. Martin often related to the writer the mode of translation. He said that the Prophet possessed a seer stone as well as the Urim and Thummim, by means of which he could translate the characters. On one occasion Martin placed in a hat a stone very much like the Prophet's seer stone, and after the Prophet had looked an unusual length of time, he raised his head, saying, \"Martin, what in the world is the matter? all is dark as Egypt.\" Martin smiled, and confessed. Joseph said, \"Martin, why did you do this?\" Martin answered: \"To stop the mouths of fools, who tell me you know all this by heart, and are deceiving me.\"  Father Sanford Porter, while living in Jackson County, Mo., in 1832, Was desirous to know how the Prophet translated the characters which were engraven on the gold plates, and made it a matter of prayer. While the Prophet was receiving a revelation in Jackson County, Missouri, Father Porter was present in the room and while observing that the Prophet would speak a sentence to be written by a scribe engaged for that purpose, the scribe would say, \"It is written,\" and if written correctly the sentence before the Prophet would disappear and another sentence would appear likewise, but if not written correctly by the scribe the sentence would remain, and after the necessary correction had been made, the sentence would disappear.  Many years ago Father Porter related to me that it was shown unto him, that by the aid of the Urim and Thummim the Prophet could see a sentence as if in gold letters, which he would read, and when it was written another sentence would appear. Martin Harris stated to me as above that when he had written the sentence that was presented, if written correctly it would disappear and another sentence would appear, and so continue. At the conclusion of the revelation Joseph was"]]]
