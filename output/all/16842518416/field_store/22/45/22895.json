As close in as we dared cruise, we found fathomless depths, and always the same undented coastline of bald cliffs.  As darkness threatened, we drew away and lay well off the coast all night. We had not as yet really commenced to suffer for lack of water; but I knew that it would not be long before we did, and so at the first streak of dawn I moved in again and once more took up the hopeless survey of the forbidding coast.  Toward noon we discovered a beach, the first we had seen.  It was a narrow strip of sand at the base of a part of the cliff that seemed lower than any we had before scanned.  At its foot, half buried in the sand, lay great boulders, mute evidence that in a bygone age some mighty natural force had crumpled Caprona's barrier at this point.  It was Bradley who first called our attention to a strange object lying among the boulders above the surf.  \"Looks like a man,\" he said, and passed his glasses to me.  I looked long and carefully and could have sworn that the thing I saw was the sprawled figure of a human being.  Miss La Rue was on deck with us.  I turned and asked her to go below.  Without a word she did as I bade.  Then I stripped, and as I did so, Nobs looked questioningly at me.  He had been wont at home to enter the surf with me, and evidently he had not forgotten it.  \"What are you going to do, sir?\" asked Olson.  \"I'm going to see what that thing is on shore,\" I replied. \"If it's a man, it may mean that Caprona is inhabited, or it may merely mean that some poor devils were shipwrecked here. I ought to be able to tell from the clothing which is more near the truth.  \"How about sharks?\" queried Olson.  \"Sure, you ought to carry a knoife.\"  \"Here you are, sir,\" cried one of the men.  It was a long slim blade he offered--one that I could carry between my teeth--and so I accepted it gladly.  \"Keep close in,\" I directed Bradley, and then I dived over the side and struck out for the narrow beach.  There was another splash directly behind me, and turning my head, I saw faithful old Nobs swimming valiantly in my wake.  The surf was not heavy, and there was no undertow, so we made shore easily, effecting an equally easy landing.  The beach was composed largely of small stones worn smooth by the action of water.  There was little sand, though from the deck of the U-33 the beach had appeared to be all sand, and I saw no evidences of mollusca or crustacea such as are common to all beaches I have previously seen.  I attribute this to the fact of the smallness of the beach, the enormous depth of surrounding water and the great distance at which Caprona lies from her nearest neighbor.  As Nobs and I approached the recumbent figure farther up the beach, I was appraised by my nose that whether man or not, the thing had once been organic and alive, but that for some time it had been dead.  Nobs halted, sniffed and growled.  A little later he sat down upon his haunches, raised his muzzle to the heavens and bayed forth a most dismal howl.  I shied a small stone at him and bade him shut up--his uncanny noise made me nervous.  When I had come quite close to the thing, I still could not say whether it had been man or beast.  The carcass was badly swollen and partly decomposed.  There was no sign of clothing upon or about it.  A fine, brownish hair covered the chest and abdomen, and the face, the palms of the hands, the feet, the shoulders and back were practically hairless.  The creature must have been about the height of a fair sized man; its features were similar to those of a man; yet had it been a man?  I could not say, for it resembled an ape no more than it did a man. Its large toes protruded laterally as do those of the semiarboreal peoples of Borneo, the Philippines and other remote regions where low types still persist.  The countenance might have been that of a cross between Pithecanthropus, the Java ape-man, and a daughter of the Piltdown race of prehistoric Sussex. A wooden cudgel lay beside the corpse.  Now this fact set me thinking.  There was no wood of any description in sight.  There was nothing about the beach to suggest a wrecked mariner. There was absolutely nothing about the body to suggest that it might possibly in life have known a maritime experience.  It was the body of a low type of man or a high type of beast.  In neither instance would it have been of a seafaring race.  Therefore I deduced that it was native to Caprona--that it lived inland, and that it had fallen or been hurled from the cliffs above.  Such being the case, Caprona was inhabitable, if not inhabited, by man; but how to reach the inhabitable interior!  That was the question.  A closer view of the cliffs than had been afforded me from the deck of the U-33 only confirmed my conviction that no mortal man could scale those perpendicular heights; there was not a finger-hold, not a toe-hold, upon them.  I turned away baffled.  Nobs and I met with no sharks upon our return journey to the submarine. My report filled everyone with theories and speculations, and with renewed hope and determination.  They all reasoned along the same lines that I had reasoned--the conclusions were obvious, but not the water. We were now thirstier than ever.  The balance of that day we spent in continuing a minute and fruitless exploration of the monotonous coast.  There was not another break in the frowning cliffs--not even another minute patch of pebbly beach.  As the sun fell, so did our spirits. I had tried to make advances to the girl again; but she would have none of me, and so I was not only thirsty but otherwise sad and downhearted.  I was glad when the new day broke the hideous spell of a sleepless night.  The morning's search brought us no shred of hope.  Caprona was impregnable--that was the decision of all; yet we kept on.  It must have been about two bells of the afternoon watch that Bradley called my attention to the branch of a tree, with leaves upon it, floating on the sea.  \"It may have been carried down to the ocean by a river,\" he suggested.  \"Yes,\" I replied, \"it may have; it may have tumbled or been thrown off the top of one of these cliffs.\"  Bradley's face fell.  \"I thought of that, too,\" he replied, \"but I wanted to believe the other.\"  \"Right you are!\" I cried.  \"We must believe the other until we prove it false.  We can't afford to give up heart now, when we need heart most. The branch was carried down by a river, and we are going to find that river.\" I smote my open palm with a clenched fist, to emphasize a determination unsupported by hope. \"There!\" I cried suddenly.  \"See that, Bradley?\"  And I pointed at a spot closer to shore.  \"See that, man!\"  Some flowers and grasses and another leafy branch floated toward us.  We both scanned the water and the coastline.  Bradley evidently discovered something, or at least thought that he had.  He called down for a bucket and a rope, and when they were passed up to him, he lowered the former into the sea and drew it in filled with water.  Of this he took a taste, and straightening up, looked into my eyes with an expression of elation--as much as to say \"I told you so!\"  \"This water is warm,\" he announced, \"and fresh!\"  I grabbed the bucket and tasted its contents.  The water was very warm, and it was fresh, but there was a most unpleasant taste to it.  \"Did you ever taste water from a stagnant pool full of tadpoles?\" Bradley asked.  \"That's it,\" I exclaimed, \"--that's just the taste exactly, though I haven't experienced it since boyhood; but how can water from a flowing stream, taste thus, and what the dickens makes it so warm?  It must be at least 70 or 80 Fahrenheit, possibly higher.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Bradley, \"I should say higher; but where does it come from?\"  \"That is easily discovered now that we have found it,\" I answered. \"It can't come from the ocean; so it must come from the land. All that we have to do is follow it, and sooner or later we shall come upon its source.\"  We were already rather close in; but I ordered the U-33's prow turned inshore and we crept slowly along, constantly dipping up the water and tasting it to assure ourselves that we didn't get outside the fresh-water current.  There was a very light off-shore wind and scarcely any breakers, so that the approach to the shore was continued without finding bottom; yet though we were already quite close, we saw no indication of any indention in the coast from which even a tiny brooklet might issue, and certainly no mouth of a large river such as this must necessarily be to freshen the ocean even two hundred yards from shore.  The tide was running out, and this, together with the strong flow of the freshwater current, would have prevented our going against the cliffs even had we not been under power; as it was we had to buck the combined forces in order to hold our position at all.  We came up to within twenty-five feet of the sheer wall, which loomed high above us. There was no break in its forbidding face.  As we watched the face of the waters and searched the cliff's high face, Olson suggested that the fresh water might come from a submarine geyser.  This, he said, would account for its heat; but even as he spoke a bush, covered thickly with leaves and flowers, bubbled to the surface and floated off astern.  \"Flowering shrubs don't thrive in the subterranean caverns from which geysers spring,\" suggested Bradley.  Olson shook his head.  \"It beats me,\" he said.  \"I've got it!\" I exclaimed suddenly.  \"Look there!\"  And I pointed at the base of the cliff ahead of us, which the receding tide was gradually exposing to our view.  They all looked, and all saw what I had seen--the top of a dark opening in the rock, through which water was pouring out into the sea.  \"It's the subterranean channel of an inland river,\" I cried.  \"It flows through a land covered with vegetation--and therefore a land upon which the sun shines.  No subterranean caverns produce any order of plant life"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/55143"],["title","The Story of the Mince Pie (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive)        THE STORY OF THE MINCE PIE   [Illustration: “Here! what’s this rolling across the floor?”    (_Page 142_) ]       THE STORY OF   THE MINCE PIE    BY   JOSEPHINE SCRIBNER GATES   Author of “Captain Billie,” “The Story of Live Dolls,”   “Little Girl Blue,” etc.    ILLUSTRATED BY   JOHN RAE    [Illustration]    NEW YORK   DODD, MEAD AND COMPANY   1916    COPYRIGHT, 1916   BY DODD, MEAD AND COMPANY, INC.

No one ever did, I am sure, and no one knew the pie was full of dolls; everybody supposed it was just a plain mince pie; the kind that makes your eyes twinkle, and makes you smack your lips when you sniff it baking.  I have always thought it was the kind Jack Horner had when he sat in the corner and pulled out a plum, but never did I dream that he might have pulled out a doll!  I found it out in such an extremely funny and unexpected way that I must tell you all about it.  It was Christmas Eve. Jack’s father was away but coming home on the morrow in time for all the Christmas doings.  We had locked up the house and were just going upstairs to bed when Jack exclaimed:  “Mother, you know the mince pie you baked to-day? We must take it up to bed with us!”  “A pie, a mince pie to bed with us?” I cried in amazement, as I thought of the spicy delicious thing safely stowed away on the pantry shelf.  “Yes, Mother, you know there is a mouse. It ate up my gingerbread doll; didn’t leave even a crumb. How would we feel if it ate up our mince pie!”  That was true. There had been a mouse spying about of late, and so I said all right, we would.  I carried it up very carefully, and we stood in the middle of the room looking about for a good place to put it.  It was a bitter night. The maid had built a grand fire of logs, and they crackled and snapped a Christmas greeting as we stood seeking a resting place for the pie.  “I see a fine spot!” cried Jack, as he ran to the big grandfather clock, and sure enough it was. A shelf just under the pendulum that seemed made on purpose for a pie. We placed it there and covered it carefully with a napkin.  “The pie is going to bed, too,” I said, as I snuggled it up under its cover.  Jack shouted over this, and we both had a merry time undressing before the jolly fire.  We hung up our stockings and one for Father, then hopped into bed.  Jack nestled up close and begged for a bedtime story, which I always told him. A drowsy tale which sent him to sleep, and me, too, before it was barely finished.  I really didn’t know I was asleep, but suddenly a queer sound startled me, and as I listened I heard Jack smothering a giggle.  “What is it, dear?” I whispered.  “Oh, Mother, such a funny thing! I heard the clock chain rattle, and I looked and the mouse ran up the clock, and I heard voices singing: ‘Hickory Dickory Dock.’ Now look quick!”  We both stared at the napkin over the pie, for it began to get humpy. You have played “tent” under the bedclothes, of course.  Well, there seemed a dozen somethings playing that game, for the napkin humped up here and there till presently it was lifted off and fell to the floor.  It was just like a matinée. The napkin seemed to be the curtain rolled away, then the show began.  We heard queer voices singing, and then we saw such a sight! Out of that pie filed a lot of dolls, the strangest looking dolls any one ever saw.  One seemed to be made of raisins; another of currants—the dried sugary kind. One had a round apple for a head, and such rosy cheeks it looked like a blooming country maid wearing a Dutch blue gown and an apron as white as snow.  Back of her was a brownie, holding the hand of a creamy white fat boy. Following them was a group, one had a round nut-like head; another was stuck full of what looked like cloves; another was tall and thin just like a stick. With him was a pair of twins. They looked for all the world like salt and pepper boxes. They were much smaller than the others and teetered on the edge of the pie like tiny fairies.  Then came another pair, one with an orange for a head, the other a lemon. As they pranced along, their fluffy orange and yellow skirts stood out like ballet dancers.  Then came a dumpy maid all sparkly white.  “She’s the shape of a fat sugar bowl, Mother!” whispered Jack, and, sure enough, she looked as though she had walked right off the tea tray.  Following her came one with a small oval brown head, looking so wise.  With her was one with a large green head.  Back of them strode another pair; one looking like a molasses jug, the other like a vinegar cruet.  Such a funny lot as they were!  We looked and laughed, and laughed and looked. They raced about on the very edge of the crust as though they were playing Ring around a Rosy; then at a signal from the tall thin fellow they ran down the spiral column of the clock over to the hearth.  “We can have a Christmas dance right here,” cried the rosy-cheeked apple maid; at this joyful news they switched off their sashes.  The tall thin one fastened the ends to the top of an andiron, and there in the firelight we saw a dance, such as no one ever saw before. Round and round they danced, till the iron was bound with ribbon to its very base; then the little creatures threw themselves on the hearth.  “Let’s play school!” cried the tall thin Stick Doll, who seemed to be chairman for the occasion.  “Mercy, no!” cried another. “I don’t like school. I don’t want to learn things.”  “I said let’s _play_ school. We don’t have to learn anything. It will be fun. We’ll each tell a story.”  “A story!” echoed the whole bunch.  “What kind of a story?”  “A true story.”  “We don’t know any,” they all sighed.  “Oh, yes, you do. You all know fine stories, and if you’ll tell them, something grand is going to happen!”  “What?” cried the audience.  “This is the one night of all the year when wonderful things happen.”  With"]]]
