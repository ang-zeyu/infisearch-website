And the celestial relations and action of the great Mormon drama, in other worlds, and in the \"eternities past and to come,\" have constituted her most familiar studies and been in the rehearsals of her daily ministry.  Mother Whitney says:      \"I was born the day after Christmas in the first year of the     present century, in the quiet, old-fashioned country town of Derby,     New Haven County, Conn. My parents' names were Gibson and Polly     Smith. The Smiths were among the earliest settlers there, and were     widely known. I was the oldest child, and grew up in an atmosphere     of love and tenderness. My parents were not professors of religion,     and according to puritanical ideas were grossly in fault to have     me taught dancing; but my father had his own peculiar notions upon     the subject, and wished me to possess and enjoy, in connection     with a sound education and strict morals, such accomplishments as     would fit me to fill, with credit to myself and my training, an     honorable position in society. He had no sympathy whatever with any     of the priests of that day, and was utterly at variance with their     teachings and ministry, notwithstanding he was strenuous on all     points of honor, honesty morality and uprightness.      \"There is nothing in my early life I remember with more intense     satisfaction than the agreeable companionship of my father. My     mother's health was delicate, and with her household affairs,     and two younger children, she gave herself up to domestic life,     allowing it to absorb her entire interest, and consequently I was     more particularly under my father's jurisdiction and influence;     our tastes were most congenial, and this geniality and happiness     surrounded me with its beneficial influence until I reached     my nineteenth year. Nothing in particular occurred to mar the     smoothness of my life's current and prosperity, and love beamed     upon our home.      \"About this time a new epoch in my life created a turning point     which unconsciously to us, who were the actors in the drama, caused     all my future to be entirely separate and distinct from those     with whom I had been reared and nurtured. My father's sister, a     spinster, who had money at her own disposal, and who was one of     those strong-minded women of whom so much is said in this our day,     concluded to emigrate to the great West,--at that time Ohio seemed     a fabulous distance from civilization and enlightenment, and going     to Ohio then was as great an undertaking as going to China or     Japan is at the present day. She entreated my parents to allow me     to accompany her, and promised to be as faithful and devoted to     me as possible, until they should join us, and that they expected     very shortly to do; their confidence in aunt Sarah's ability     and self-reliance was unbounded, and so, after much persuasion,     they consented to part with me for a short interval of time; but     circumstances, over which we mortals have no control, were so     overruled that I never saw my beloved mother again. Our journey was     a pleasant one; the beautiful scenery through which our route lay     had charms indescribable for me, who had never been farther from     home than New Haven, in which city I had passed a part of my time,     and to me it was nearer a paradise than any other place on earth.     The magnificent lakes, rivers, mountains, and romantic forests were     all delineations of nature which delighted my imagination.      \"We settled a few miles inland from the picturesque Lake Erie,     and here in after years, were the saints of God gathered and the     everlasting gospel proclaimed. My beloved aunt Sarah was a true     friend and instructor to me, and had much influence in maturing my     womanly character and developing my home education. She hated the     priests of the day, and believed them all deceivers and hypocrites;     her religion consisted in visiting the widow and the fatherless and     keeping herself 'unspotted from the world.'      \"Shortly after entering my twenty-first year I became acquainted     with a young man from Vermont, Newel K. Whitney, who, like myself,     had left home and relatives and was determined to carve out a     fortune for himself. He had been engaged in trading with the     settlers and Indians at Green Bay, Mich., buying furs extensively     for the eastern markets. In his travels to and from New York     he passed along the charming Lake Erie, and from some unknown     influence he concluded to settle and make a permanent home for     himself in this region of country; and then subsequently we met     and became acquainted; and being thoroughly convinced that we were     suited to each other, we were married by the Presbyterian minister     of that place, the Rev. J. Badger. We prospered in all our efforts     to accumulate wealth, so much so, that among our friends it came to     be remarked that nothing of Whitney's ever got lost on the lake,     and no product of his exportation was ever low in the market;     always ready sales and fair prices. We had neither of us ever made     any profession of religion, but contrary to my early education I     was naturally religious, and I expressed to my husband a wish that     we should unite ourselves to one of the churches, after examining     into their principles and deciding for ourselves. Accordingly we     united ourselves with the Campbellites, who were then making many     converts, and whose principles seemed most in accordance with     the scriptures. We continued in this church, which to us was the     nearest pattern to our Saviour's teachings, until Parley P. Pratt     and another elder preached the everlasting gospel in Kirtland.\"    CHAPTER V.  THE VOICE, AND THE MESSENGER OF THE COVENANT.  And there came one as a \"voice crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord!\"  Thus ever!  A coming to Israel with \"a new and everlasting covenant;\" this was the theme of the ancient prophets, now unfolded.  There was the voice crying in the wilderness of Ohio, just before the advent of the latter-day prophet.  The voice was Sidney Rigdon. He was to Joseph Smith as a John the Baptist.  The forerunner made straight the way in the wilderness of the virgin West. He raised up a church of disciples in and around Kirtland. He led those who afterwards became latter-day saints to faith in the promises, and baptized them in water for the remission of sins. But he had not power to baptize them with the Holy Ghost and with fire from heaven. Yet he taught the literal fulfillment of the prophesies concerning the last days, and heralded the advent of the \"one greater than I.\"  \"The same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"  That is ever the \"one greater than I,\" be his name whatever it may.  Joseph Smith baptized with the Holy Ghost. But Sidney knew not that he was heralding Joseph.  And the prophet himself was but as the voice crying in the wilderness of the great dark world: \"Prepare ye the way for the second advent of earth's Lord.\" His mission was also to \"make straight in the desert a highway\" for the God of Israel; for Israel was going up,--following the angel of the covenant, to the chambers of the mountains.  He came with a great lamp and a great light in those days, dazzling to the eyes of the generation that \"crucified\" him in its blindness.  Joseph was the sign of Messiah's coming. He unlocked the sealed heavens by faith and \"election.\" He came in \"the spirit and power of Elijah.\" The mantle of Elijah was upon him.  Be it always understood that the coming of Joseph Smith \"to restore the covenant to Israel\" signifies the near advent of Messiah to reign as King of Israel. Joseph was the Elijah of the last days.  These are the first principles of Mormonism. And to witness of their truth this testament of the sisters is given, with the signs and wonders proceeding from the mission of Him who unlocked the heavens and preached the gospel of new revelations to the world, whose light of revelation had gone out.  But first came the famous Alexander Campbell and his compeer, Sidney Rigdon, to the West with the \"lamp.\" Seekers after truth, whose hearts had, been strangely moved by some potent spirit, whose influence they felt pervading but understood not, saw the lamp and admired.  Mr. Campbell, of Virginia, was a reformed Baptist. He with Sidney Rigdon, a Mr. Walter Scott, and some other gifted men, had dissented from the regular Baptists, from whom they differed much in doctrine. They preached baptism for the remission of sins, promised the gift of the Holy Ghost, and believed in the literal fulfillment of prophesy. They also had some of the apostolic forms of organization in their church.  In Ohio they raised up branches. In Kirtland and the regions round, they made many disciples, who bore the style of \"disciples,\" though the popular sect-name was \"Campbellites.\" Among them were Eliza R. Snow, Elizabeth Ann Whitney, and many more, who afterwards embraced the \"fullness of the everlasting gospel\" as restored by the angels to the Mormon prophet.  But these evangels of a John the Baptist mission brought not to the West the light of new revelation in their lamp.  These had not yet even heard of the opening of a new dispensation of revelations. As they came by the way they had seen no angels with new commissions for the Messiah age. No Moses nor Elijah had been with them on a mount of transfiguration. Nor had they entered into the chamber with the angel of the covenant, bringing a renewal of the covenant to Israel. This was in the mission of the \"one greater\" than they who came after.  They brought the lamp without the light--nothing more. Better _the light_ without the evangelical lamp--better a conscientious intellect than the forms of sectarian"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54335"],["title","The Women of Mormondom (#7)"],["body","without the power.  Without the power to unlock the heavens, and the Elijah faith to call the angels down, there could be no new dispensation--no millennial civilization for the world, to crown the civilization of the ages.  Light came to Sidney Rigdon from the Mormon Elijah, and he comprehended the light; but Alexander Campbell rejected the prophet when his message came; he would have none of his angels. He had been preaching the literal fulfillment of prophesy, but when the covenant was revealed he was not ready. The lamp, not the light, was his admiration. Himself was the lamp; _Joseph had the light from the spirit world_, and the darkness comprehended it not.  Alexander Campbell was a learned and an able man--the very _form of wisdom_, but without the spirit.  Joseph Smith was an unlettered youth. He came not in the polished _form_ of wisdom--either divine or human--but in the demonstration of the Holy Ghost, and with signs following the believer.  Mr. Campbell would receive no new revelation from such an one--no everlasting covenant from the new Jerusalem which was waiting to come down, to establish on earth a great spiritual empire, that the King might appear to Zion in his glory, with all his angels and the ancients of days.  The tattered and blood-stained commissions of old Rome were sufficient for the polished divine,--Rome which had made all nations drunk with her spiritual fornications,--Rome which put to death the Son of God when his Israel in blindness rejected him.  Between Rome and Jerusalem there was now the great controversy of the God of Israel. Not the old Jerusalem which had traveled from the east to the west, led by the angel of the covenant, up out of the land of Egypt! The new Jerusalem to the earth then, as she is to-day! Ever will she be the new Jerusalem--ever will \"old things\" be passing away when \"the Lord cometh!\"  And the angel of the west appeared by night to the youth, as he watched in the chamber of his father's house, in a little village in the State of New York. On that charmed night when the invisibles hovered about the earth the angel that stood before him read to the messenger of Messiah the mystic text of his mission:  \"_Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in; behold he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts._\"    CHAPTER VI.  AN ANGEL FROM THE CLOUD IS HEARD IN KIRTLAND--THE \"DAUGHTER OF THE VOICE.\"  Now there dwelt in Kirtland in those days disciples who feared the Lord.  And they \"spake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.\"  \"We had been praying,\" says mother Whitney, \"to know from the Lord how we could obtain the gift of the Holy Ghost.\"  \"My husband, Newel K. Whitney, and myself, were Campbellites. We had been baptized for the remission of our sins, and believed in the laying on of hands and the gifts of the spirit. But there was no one with authority to confer the Holy Ghost upon us. We were seeking to know how to obtain the spirit and the gifts bestowed upon the ancient saints.  \"Sister Eliza Snow was also a Campbellite. We were acquainted before the restoration of the gospel to the earth. She, like myself, was seeking for the fullness of the gospel. She lived at the time in Mantua.  \"One night--it was midnight--as my husband and I, in our house at Kirtland, were praying to the father to be shown the way, the spirit rested upon us and a _cloud_ overshadowed the house.  \"It was as though we were out of doors. The house passed away from our vision. We were not conscious of anything but the presence of the spirit and the cloud that was over us.  \"We were wrapped in the cloud. A solemn awe pervaded us. We saw the cloud and we felt the spirit of the Lord.  \"Then we heard a voice out of the cloud saying:  \"'Prepare to receive the word of the Lord, for it is coming!'  \"At this we marveled greatly; but from that moment we knew that the word of the Lord was coming to Kirtland.\"  Now this is an Hebraic sign, well known to Israel after the glory of Israel had departed. It was called by the sacred people who inherited the covenant \"the daughter of the voice.\"  Blindness had happened to Israel. The prophets and the seers the Lord had covered, but the \"daughter of the voice\" was still left to Israel. From time to time a few, with the magic blood of the prophets in them, heard the voice speaking to them out of the cloud.  Down through the ages the \"daughter of the voice\" followed the children of Israel in their dispersions. Down through the ages, from time to time, some of the children of the sacred seed have heard the voice. This is the tradition of the sons and daughters of Judah.  It was the \"daughter of the voice\" that Mother Whitney and her husband heard, at midnight, in Kirtland, speaking to them out of the cloud. Mother Whitney and her husband were of the seed of Israel (so run their patriarchal blessings); it was their gift and privilege to hear the \"voice.\"  _He_ was coming now, whose right it is to reign. The throne of David was about to be re-set up and given to the lion of the tribe of Judah. The everlasting King of the new Jerusalem was coming down, with the tens of thousands of his saints.  The star of Messiah was traveling from the east to the west. The prophet--the messenger of Messiah's covenant--was about to remove farther westward, towards the place where his Lord in due time will commence his reign, which shall extend over all the earth.  This was the meaning of that vision of the \"cloud\" in Kirtland, at midnight, overshadowing the house of Newel K. Whitney; this the significance of the \"voice\" which spoke out of the cloud, saying: \"Prepare to receive the word of the Lord, for it is coming!\"  The Lord of Hosts was about to make up his jewels for the crown of his appearing; and there were many of those jewels already in the West.    CHAPTER VII.  AN ISRAEL PREPARED BY VISIONS, DREAMS AND ANGELS--INTERESTING AND MIRACULOUS STORY OF PARLEY P. PRATT--A MYSTIC SIGN OF MESSIAH IN THE HEAVENS--THE ANGEL'S WORDS FULFILLED.  The divine narrative leads directly into the personal story of Parley P. Pratt. He it was who first brought the Mormon mission west. He it was who presented the Book of Mormon to Sidney Rigdon, and converted him to the new covenant which Jehovah was making with a latter-day Israel.  Parley P. Pratt was one of the earliest of the new apostles. By nature he was both poet and prophet. The soul of prophesy was born in him. In his lifetime he was the Mormon Isaiah. All his writings were Hebraic. He may have been of Jewish blood. He certainly possessed the Jewish genius, of the prophet order.  It would seem that the spirit of this great latter-day work could not throw its divine charms around the youthful prophet, who had been raised up to open a crowning spiritual dispensation, without peculiarly affecting the spiritual minded everywhere--both men and women.  It is one of the remarkable facts connected with the rise of Mormonism in the age that, at about the time Joseph Smith was receiving the administration of angels, thousands both in America and Great Britain were favored with corresponding visions and intuitions. Hence, indeed, its success, which was quite as astonishing as the spiritual work of the early Christians.  One of the first manifestations was that of earnest gospel-seekers having visions of the elders before they came, and recognizing them when they did come bearing the tidings. Many of the sisters, as well as the brethren, can bear witness of this.  This very peculiar experience gave special significance to one of the earliest hymns, sung by the saints, of the angel who \"came down from the mansions of glory\" with \"the fullness of Jesus's gospel,\" and also the \"covenant to gather his people,\" the refrain of which was,    \"O! Israel! O! Israel! in all your abidings,   Prepare for your Lord, when you hear these glad tidings.\"  An Israel had been prepared in all their \"abidings,\" by visions and signs, like sister Whitney, who heard the voice of the angel, from the cloud, bidding her prepare for the coming word of the Lord. Parley P. Pratt was the elder who fulfilled her vision, and brought the word of the Lord direct from Joseph to Kirtland.  And Parley himself was one of an Israel who had been thus mysteriously prepared for the great latter-day mission, of which he became so marked an apostle.  Before he reached the age of manhood, Parley had in his native State (N.Y.) met with reverses in fortune so serious as to change the purposes of his life.  \"I resolved,\" he says, \"to bid farewell to the civilized world, where I had met with little else but disappointment, sorrow and unrewarded toil; and where sectarian divisions disgusted, and ignorance perplexed me,--and to spend the remainder of my days in the solitudes of the great West, among the natives of the forest.\"  In October, 1826, he took leave of his friends and started westward, coming at length to a small settlement about thirty miles west of Cleveland, in the State of Ohio. The country was covered with a dense forest, with only here and there a small opening made by the settlers, and the surface of the earth was one vast scene of mud and mire.  Alone, in a land of strangers, without home or money, and not yet twenty years of age, he became somewhat discouraged, but concluded to stop for the winter.  In the spring he resolved to return to his native State, for there was one at home whom his heart had long loved and from whom he would not have been separated, except by misfortune.  But with her, as his wife, he returned to Ohio, the following year, and made a home on the lands which he cleared with his own hands. [1]  Eighteen months thereafter Sidney Rigdon came into the neighborhood, as a preacher."]]]
