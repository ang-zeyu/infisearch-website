After the speech he assured the Judge that he was now undergoing the greatest pleasure of his life in meeting the popular orator, the true representative man of the Great West, the matured statesman, and the able advocate of national principles. And although Mr. Douglas looked as if he had heard something of the kind before, he pressed Mr. Cluyme's hand warmly.  So was the author of Popular Sovereignty, \"the great Bulwark of American Independence,\" escorted to the Court House steps, past houses of his stanch supporters; which were illuminated in his honor. Stephen, wedged. among the people, remarked that the Judge had lost none of his self-confidence since that day at Freeport. Who, seeing the Democratic candidate smiling and bowing to the audience that blocked the wide square, would guess that the Question troubled him at all, or that he missed the votes of the solid South? How gravely the Judge listened to the eulogy of the prominent citizen, who reminded him that his work was not yet finished, and that he still was harnessed to the cause of the people! And how happy was the choice of that word harnessed!  The Judge had heard (so he said) with deep emotion the remarks of the chairman. Then followed one of those masterful speeches which wove a spell about those who listened,--which, like the most popular of novels, moved to laughter and to tears, to anger and to pity. Mr. Brice and Mr Richter were not the only Black Republicans who were depressed that night. And they trudged homeward with the wild enthusiasm still ringing in their ears, heavy with the thought that the long, hot campaign of their own Wide-Awakes might be in vain.  They had a grim reproof from Judge Whipple in the morning.  \"So you too, gentlemen, took opium last night,\" was all he said.  The dreaded possibility of Mr. Lincoln's election did not interfere with the gayeties. The week after the Fair Mr. Clarence Colfax gave a great dance at Bellegarde, in honor of his cousin, Virginia, to which Mr. Stephen Brice was not invited. A majority of Company A was there. Virginia would have liked to have had them in uniform.  It was at this time that Anne Brinsmade took the notion of having a ball in costume. Virginia, on hearing the news, rode over from Bellegarde, and flinging her reins to Nicodemus ran up to Anne's little dressing-room.  \"Whom have you invited, Anne?\" she demanded.  Anne ran over the long list of their acquaintance, but there was one name she omitted.  \"Are you sure that that is all?\" asked Virginia, searchingly, when she had finished.  Anne looked mystified.  \"I have invited Stephen Brice, Jinny,\" she said. But!--\"  \"But!\" cried Virginia. \"I knew it. Am I to be confronted with that Yankee everywhere I go? It is always 'Stephen Brice', and he is ushered in with a but.\"  Anne was quite overcome by this outburst. She had dignity, however, and plenty of it. And she was a loyal friend.  \"You have no right to criticise my guests, Virginia.\"  Virginia, seated on the arm of a chair, tapped her foot on the floor.  \"Why couldn't things remain as they were?\" she said. \"We were so happy before these Yankees came. And they are not content in trying to deprive us of our rights. They must spoil our pleasure, too.\"  \"Stephen Brice is a gentleman,\" answered Anne. \"He spoils no one's pleasure, and goes no place that he is not asked.\"  \"He has not behaved according to my idea of a gentleman, the few times that I have been unfortunate enough to encounter him,\" Virginia retorted.  \"You are the only one who says so, then.\" Here the feminine got the better of Anne's prudence, and she added. \"I saw you waltz with him once, Jinny Carvel, and I am sure you never enjoyed a dance as much in your life.\"  Virginia blushed purple.  \"Anne Brinsmade!\" she cried. \"You may have your ball, and your Yankees, all of them you want. But I shan't come. How I wish I had never seen that horrid Stephen Brice! Then you would never have insulted me.\"  Virginia rose and snatched her riding-whip. This was too much for Anne. She threw her arms around her friend without more ado.  \"Don't quarrel with me, Jinny,\" she said tearfully. \"I couldn't bear it. He--Mr. Brice is not coming, I am sure.\"  Virginia disengaged herself.  \"He is not coming?\"  \"No,\" said Anne. \"You asked me if he was invited. And I was going on to tell you that he could not come.\"  She stopped, and stared at Virginia in bewilderment. That young lady, instead of beaming, had turned her back. She stood flicking her whip at the window, gazing out over the trees, down the slope to the river. Miss Russell might have interpreted these things. Simple Anne!  \"Why isn't he coming?\" said Virginia, at last.  \"Because he is to be one of the speakers at a big meeting that night. Have you seen him since you got home, Jinny? He is thinner than he was. We are much worried about him, because he has worked so hard this summer.\"  \"A Black Republican meeting!\" exclaimed Virginia, scornfully ignoring the rest of what was said. \"Then I'll come, Anne dear,\" she cried, tripping the length of the room. \"I'll come as Titania. Who will you be?\"  She cantered off down the drive and out of the gate, leaving a very puzzled young woman watching her from the window. But when Virginia reached the forest at the bend of the road, she pulled her horse down to a walk.  She bethought herself of the gown which her Uncle Daniel had sent her from Calvert House, and of the pearls. And she determined to go as her great-grandmother, Dorothy Carvel.  Shades of romance! How many readers will smile before the rest of this true incident is told?  What had happened was this. Miss Anne Brinsmade had driven to town in her mother's Jenny Lind a day or two before, and had stopped (as she often did) to pay a call on Mrs. Brice. This lady, as may be guessed, was not given to discussion of her husband's ancestors, nor of her own. But on the walls of the little dining-room hung a Copley and two Stuarts. One of the Stuarts was a full length of an officer in the buff and blue of the Continental Army. And it was this picture which caught Anne's eye that day.  \"How like Stephen!\" she exclaimed. And added. \"Only the face is much older. Who is it, Mrs. Brice?\"  \"Colonel Wilton Brice, Stephen's grandfather. There is a marked look about all the Brices. He was only twenty years of age when the Revolution began. That picture was painted much later in life, after Stuart came back to America, when the Colonel was nearly forty. He had kept his uniform, and his wife persuaded him to be painted in it.\"  \"If Stephen would only come as Colonel Wilton Brice!\" she cried. \"Do you think he would, Mrs. Brice?\"  Mrs. Brice laughed, and shook her head.  \"I am afraid not, Anne,\" she said. \"I have a part of the uniform upstairs, but I could never induce him even to try it on.\"  As she drove from shop to shop that day, Anne reflected that it certainly would not be like Stephen to wear his grandfather's uniform to a ball. But she meant to ask him, at any rate. And she had driven home immediately to write her invitations. It was with keen disappointment that she read his note of regret.  However, on the very day of the ball, Anne chanced to be in town again, and caught sight of Stephen pushing his way among the people on Fourth Street. She waved her hand to him, and called to Nicodemus to pull up at the sidewalk.  \"We are all so sorry that you are not coming,\" said she, impulsively. And there she stopped short. For Anne was a sincere person, and remembered Virginia. \"That is, I am so sorry,\" she added, a little hastily. \"Stephen, I saw the portrait of your grandfather, and I wanted you to come in his costume.\"  Stephen, smiling down on her, said nothing. And poor Anne, in her fear that he had perceived the shade in her meaning, made another unfortunate remark.  \"If you were not a--a Republican--\" she said.  \"A Black Republican,\" he answered, and laughed at her discomfiture. \"What then?\"  Anne was very red.  \"I only meant that if you were not a Republican, there would be no meeting to address that night.\"  \"It does not make any difference to you what my politics are, does it?\" he asked, a little earnestly.  \"Oh, Stephen!\" she exclaimed, in gentle reproof.  \"Some people have discarded me,\" he said, striving to smile.  She wondered whether he meant Virginia, and whether he cared. Still further embarrassed, she said something which she regretted immediately.  \"Couldn't you contrive to come?\"  He considered.  \"I will come, after the meeting, if it is not too late,\" he said at length. \"But you must not tell any one.\"  He lifted his hat, and hurried on, leaving Anne in a quandary. She wanted him. But what was she to say to Virginia? Virginia was coming on the condition that he was not to be there. And Anne was scrupulous.  Stephen, too, was almost instantly sorry that he had promised. The little costumer's shop (the only one in the city at that time) had been ransacked for the occasion, and nothing was left to fit him. But when he reached home there was a strong smell of camphor in his mother's room. Colonel Brice's cocked hat and sword and spurs lay on the bed, and presently Hester brought in the blue coat and buff waistcoat from the kitchen, where she had been pressing them. Stephen must needs yield to his mother's persuasions and try them on--they were more than a passable fit. But there were the breeches and cavalry boots to be thought of, and the ruffled shirt and the powdered wig. So before tea he hurried down to the costumer's again, not quite sure that he was not making a fool of himself, and yet at last sufficiently entered into the spirit of the thing. The coat was mended and freshened. And when after tea he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5392"],["title","The Crisis â€” Volume 05 (#0)"],["body","CRISIS  By Winston Churchill   Volume 5.    CHAPTER XVI  THE GUNS OF SUMTER  Winter had vanished. Spring was come with a hush. Toward a little island set in the blue waters of Charleston harbor anxious eyes were strained.  Was the flag still there?  God alone may count the wives and mothers who listened in the still hours of the night for the guns of Sumter. One sultry night in April Stephen's mother awoke with fear in her heart, for she had heard them. Hark! that is the roar now, faint but sullen. That is the red flash far across the black Southern sky. For in our beds are the terrors and cruelties of life revealed to us. There is a demon to be faced, and nought alone.  Mrs. Brice was a brave woman. She walked that night with God.  Stephen, too, awoke. The lightning revealed her as she bent over him. On the wings of memory be flew back to his childhood in the great Boston house with the rounded front, and he saw the nursery with its high windows looking out across the Common. Often in the dark had she come to him thus, her gentle hand passing over aim to feel if he were covered.  \"What is it, mother?\" he said.  She said: \"Stephen, I am afraid that the war has come.\"  He sat up, blindly. Even he did not guess the agony in her heart.  \"You will have to go, Stephen.\"  It was long before his answer came.  \"You know that I cannot, mother. We have nothing left but the little I earn. And if I were--\" He did not finish the sentence, for he felt her trembling. But she said again, with that courage which seems woman's alone:  \"Remember Wilton Brice. Stephen--I can get along. I can sew.\"  It was the hour he had dreaded, stolen suddenly upon him out of the night. How many times had he rehearsed this scene to himself! He, Stephen Brice, who had preached and slaved and drilled for the Union, a renegade to be shunned by friend and foe alike! He had talked for his country, but he would not risk his life for it. He heard them repeating the charge. He saw them passing him silently on the street. Shamefully he remembered the time, five months agone, when he had worn the very uniform of his Revolutionary ancestor. And high above the tier of his accusers he saw one face, and the look of it stung to the very quick of his soul.  Before the storm he had fallen asleep in sheer weariness of the struggle, that face shining through the black veil of the darkness. If he were to march away in the blue of his country (alas, not of hers!) she would respect him for risking life for conviction. If he stayed at home, she would not understand. It was his plain duty to his mother. And yet he knew that Virginia Carvel and the women like her were ready to follow with bare feet the march of the soldiers of the South.  The rain was come now, in a flood. Stephen's mother could not see in the blackness the bitterness on his face. Above the roar of the waters she listened for his voice.  \"I will not go, mother,\" he said. \"If at length every man is needed, that will be different.\"  \"It is for you to decide, my son,\" she answered. \"There are many ways in which you can serve your country here. But remember that you may have to face hard things.\"  \"I have had to do that before, mother,\" he replied calmly. \"I cannot leave you dependent upon charity.\"  She went back into her room to pray, for she knew that he had laid his ambition at her feet.  It was not until a week later that the dreaded news came. All through the Friday shells had rained on the little fort while Charleston looked on. No surrender yet. Through a wide land was that numbness which precedes action. Force of habit sent men to their places of business, to sit idle. A prayerful Sunday intervened. Sumter had fallen. South Carolina had shot to bits the flag she had once revered.  On the Monday came the call of President Lincoln for volunteers. Missouri was asked for her quota. The outraged reply of her governor went back, --never would she furnish troops to invade her sister states. Little did Governor Jackson foresee that Missouri was to stand fifth of all the Union in the number of men she was to give. To her was credited in the end even more men than stanch Massachusetts.  The noise of preparation was in the city--in the land. On the Monday morning, when Stephen went wearily to the office, he was met by Richter at the top of the stairs, who seized his shoulders and looked into his face. The light of the zealot was on Richter's own.  \"We shall drill every night now, my friend, until further orders. It is the Leader's word. Until we go to the front, Stephen, to put down rebellion.\" Stephen sank into a chair, and bowed his head. What would he think,--this man who had fought and suffered and renounced his native land for his convictions? Who in this nobler allegiance was ready to die for them? How was he to confess to Richter, of all men?  \"Carl,\" he said at length, \"I--I cannot go.\"  \"You--you cannot go? You who have done so much already! And why?\"  Stephen did not answer. But Richter, suddenly divining, laid his hands impulsively on Stephen's shoulders.  \"Ach, I see,\" he said. \"Stephen, I have saved some money. It shall be for your mother while you are away.\"  At first Stephen was too surprised for speech. Then, in spite of his feelings, he stared at the German with a new appreciation of his character. Then he could merely shake his head.  \"Is it not for the Union?\" implored Richter, \"I would give a fortune, if I had it. Ah, my friend, that would please me so. And I do not need the money now. I 'have--nobody.\"  Spring was in the air; the first faint smell of verdure wafted across the river on the wind. Stephen turned to the open window, tears of intense agony in his eyes. In that instant he saw the regiment marching, and the flag flying at its head.  \"It is my duty to stay here, Carl,\" he said brokenly.  Richter took an appealing step toward him and stopped. He realized that with this young New Englander a decision once made was unalterable. In all his knowledge of Stephen he never remembered him to change. With the demonstrative sympathy of his race, he yearned to comfort him, and knew not how. Two hundred years of Puritanism had reared barriers not to be broken down.  At the end of the office the stern figure of the Judge appeared.  \"Mr. Brice!\" he said sharply.  Stephen followed him into the littered room behind the ground glass door, scarce knowing what to expect,--and scarce caring, as on that first day he had gone in there. Mr. Whipple himself closed the door, and then the transom. Stephen felt those keen eyes searching him from their hiding-place.  \"Mr. Brice,\" he said at last, \"the President has called for seventy-five thousand volunteers to crush this rebellion. They will go, and be swallowed up, and more will go to fill their places. Mr. Brice, people will tell you that the war will be over in ninety days. But I tell you, sir, that it will not be over in seven times ninety days.\" He brought down his fist heavily upon the table. \"This, sir, will be a war to the death. One side or the other will fight until their blood is all let, and until their homes are all ruins.\" He darted at Stephen one look from under those fierce eyebrows. \"Do you intend to go sir?\"  Stephen met the look squarely. \"No, sir,\" he answered, steadily, \"not now.\"  \"Humph,\" said the Judge. Then he began what seemed a never-ending search among the papers on his desk. At length he drew out a letter, put on his spectacles and read it, and finally put it down again.  \"Stephen,\" said Mr. Whipple, \"you are doing a courageous thing. But if we elect to follow our conscience in this world, we must not expect to escape persecution, sir. Two weeks ago,\" he continued slowly, \"two weeks ago I had a letter from Mr. Lincoln about matters here. He mentions you.\"  \"He remembers me!\" cried Stephen  The Judge smiled a little. \"Mr. Lincoln never forgets any one,\" said he. \"He wishes me to extend to you his thanks for your services to the Republican party, and sends you his kindest regards.\"  This was the first and only time that Mr. Whipple spoke to him of his labors. Stephen has often laughed at this since, and said that he would not have heard of them at all had not the Judge's sense of duty compelled him to convey the message. And it was with a lighter heart than he had felt for many a day that he went out of the door.  Some weeks later, five regiments were mustered into the service of the United States. The Leader was in command of one. And in response to his appeals, despite the presence of officers of higher rank, the President had given Captain Nathaniel Lyon supreme command in Missouri.  Stephen stood among the angry, jeering crowd that lined the streets as the regiments marched past. Here were the 'Black Jaegers.' No wonder the crowd laughed. Their step was not as steady, nor their files as straight as Company A. There was Richter, his head high, his blue eyes defiant. And there was little Tiefel marching in that place of second lieutenant that Stephen himself should have filled. Here was another company, and at the end of the first four, big Tom Catherwood. His father had disowned him the day before, His two brothers, George and little Spencer, were in a house not far away--a house from which a strange flag drooped.  Clouds were lowering over the city, and big drops falling, as Stephen threaded his way homeward, the damp anal gloom of the weather in his very soul. He went past the house where the strange flag hung against its staff In that big city it flaunted all unchallenged. The house was thrown wide open that day, and in its window lounged young men of honored families. And while they joked of German boorishness and Yankee cowardice they held rifles across their knees to avenge any insult to the strange banner that they had set up. In the hall, through the open doorway, the mouth of a shotted field gun could be seen. The guardians were the Minute Men, organized to maintain the honor and dignity of the state of Missouri."]]]
