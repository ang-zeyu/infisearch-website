D.W.]      AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS, Part 2.  By Georg Ebers  Volume 6.    CHAPTER I.  The principal steward of the banquet went forward to meet the guests as they entered, and, assisted by other noble staff-bearers (chamberlains and masters of the ceremonies), led them to their appointed places.  When they were all seated, a flourish of trumpets announced that the king was near.  As he entered the hall every one rose, and the multitude received him with a thundering shout of \"Victory to the king!\" again and again repeated.  The way to his seat was marked by a purple Sardian carpet, only to be trodden by himself and Kassandane.  His blind mother, led by Croesus, went first and took her seat at the head of the table, on a throne somewhat higher than the golden chair for Cambyses, which stood by it. The king's lawful wives sat on his left hand; Nitetis next to him, then Atossa, and by her side the pale, plainly-dressed Phaedime; next to this last wife of Cambyses sat Boges, the eunuch.  Then came the high-priest Oropastes, some of the principal Magi, the satraps of various provinces (among them the Jew Belteshazzar), and a number of Persians, Medes and eunuchs, all holding high offices under the crown.  Bartja sat at the king's right hand, and after him Croesus, Hystaspes, Gobryas, Araspes, and others of the Achaemenidae, according to their rank and age.  Of the concubines, the greater number sat at the foot of the table; some stood opposite to Cambyses, and enlivened the banquet by songs and music.  A number of eunuchs stood behind them, whose duty it was to see that they did not raise their eyes towards the men.  Cambyses' first glance was bestowed on Nitetis; she sat by him in all the splendor and dignity of a queen, but looking very, very pale in her new purple robes.  Their eyes met, and Cambyses felt that such a look could only come from one who loved him very dearly.  But his own love told him that something had troubled her.  There was a sad seriousness about her mouth, and a slight cloud, which only he could see, seemed to veil the usually calm, clear and cheerful expression of her eyes.  \"I will ask her afterwards what has happened,\" thought he, \"but it will not do to let my subjects see how much I love this girl.\"  He kissed his mother, sister, brother and his nearest relations on the forehead--said a short prayer thanking the gods for their mercies and entreating a happy new year for himself and the Persians--named the immense sum he intended to present to his countrymen on this day, and then called on the staff bearers to bring the petitioners before his face, who hoped to obtain some reasonable request from the king on this day of grace.  As every petitioner had been obliged to lay his request before the principal staff bearer the day before, in order to ascertain whether it was admissible, they all received satisfactory answers.  The petitions of the women had been enquired into by the eunuchs in the same manner, and they too were now conducted before their lord and master by Boges, Kassandane alone remaining seated.  The long procession was opened by Nitetis and Atossa, and the two princesses were immediately followed by Phaedime and another beauty.  The latter was magnificently dressed and had been paired with Phaedime by Boges, in order to make the almost poverty-stricken simplicity of the fallen favorite more apparent.  Intaphernes and Otanes looked as annoyed as Boges had expected, on seeing their grandchild and daughter so pale, and in such miserable array, in the midst of all this splendor and magnificence.  Cambyses had had experience of Phaedime's former extravagance in matters of dress, and, when he saw her standing before him so plainly dressed and so pale, looked both angry and astonished.  His brow darkened, and as she bent low before him, he asked her in an angry and tyrannical tone: \"What is the meaning of this beggarly dress at my table, on the day set apart in my honor?  Have you forgotten, that in our country it is the custom never to appear unadorned before the king?  Verily, if it were not my birthday, and if I did not owe you some consideration as the daughter of our dearest kinsman, I should order the eunuchs to take you back to the harem, that you might have time to think over your conduct in solitude.\"  These words rendered the mortified woman's task much easier....  She began to weep loud and bitterly, raising her hands and eyes to her angry lord in such a beseeching manner that his anger was changed into compassion, and he raised her from the ground with the question: \"Have you a petition to ask of me?\"  \"What can I find to wish for, now that the sun of my life has withdrawn his light?\"  was her faltering answer, hindered by sobs.  Cambyses shrugged his shoulders, and asked again \"Is there nothing then that you wish for?  I used to be able to dry your tears with presents; ask me for some golden comfort to-day.\"  \"Phaedime has nothing left to wish for now.  For whom can she put on jewels when her king, her husband, withdraws the light of his countenance?\"  \"Then I can do nothing for you,\" exclaimed Cambyses, turning away angrily from the kneeling woman.  Boges had been quite right in advising Phaedime to paint herself with white, for underneath the pale color her cheeks were burning with shame and anger.  But, in spite of all, she controlled her passionate feelings, made the same deep obeisance to Nitetis as to the queen-mother, and allowed her tears to flow fast and freely in sight of all the Achaemenidae.  Otanes and Intaphernes could scarcely suppress their indignation at seeing their daughter and grandchild thus humbled, and many an Achaemenidae looked on, feeling deep sympathy with the unhappy Phaedime and a hidden grudge against the favored, beautiful stranger.  The formalities were at last at an end and the feast began.  Just before the king, in a golden basket, and gracefully bordered round with other fruits, lay a gigantic pomegranate, as large as a child's head.  Cambyses noticed it now for the first time, examined its enormous size and rare beauty with the eye of a connoisseur, and said: \"Who grew this wonderful pomegranate?\"  \"Thy servant Oropastes,\" answered the chief of the Magi, with a low obeisance.  \"For many years I have studied the art of gardening, and have ventured to lay this, the most beautiful fruit of my labors, at the feet of my king.\"  \"I owe you thanks,\" cried the king: \"My friends, this pomegranate will assist me in the choice of a governor at home when we go out to war, for, by Mithras, the man who can cherish and foster a little tree so carefully will do greater things than these.  What a splendid fruit!  Surely it's like was never seen before.  I thank you again, Oropastes, and as the thanks of a king must never consist of empty words alone, I name you at once vicegerent of my entire kingdom, in case of war.  For we shall not dream away our time much longer in this idle rest, my friends.  A Persian gets low-spirited without the joys of war.\"  A murmur of applause ran through the ranks of the Achaemenidae and fresh shouts of \"Victory to the king\" resounded through the hall.  Their anger on account of the humiliation of a woman was quickly forgotten; thoughts of coming battles, undying renown and conqueror's laurels to be won by deeds of arms, and recollections of their former mighty deeds raised the spirits of the revellers.  The king himself was more moderate than usual to-day, but he encouraged his guests to drink, enjoying their noisy merriment and overflowing mirth; taking, however, far more pleasure still in the fascinating beauty of the Egyptian Princess, who sat at his side, paler than usual, and thoroughly exhausted by the exertions of the morning and the unaccustomed weight of the high tiara.  He had never felt so happy as on this day. What indeed could he wish for more than he already possessed?  Had not the gods given him every thing that a man could desire? and, over and above all this, had not they flung into his lap the precious gift of love?  His usual inflexibility seemed to have changed into benevolence, and his stern severity into good-nature, as he turned to his brother Bartja with the words: \"Come brother, have you forgotten my promise? Don't you know that to-day you are sure of gaining the dearest wish of your heart from me?  That's right, drain the goblet, and take courage! but do not ask anything small, for I am in the mood to give largely to- day.  Ah, it is a secret! come nearer then.  I am really curious to know what the most fortunate youth in my entire kingdom can long for so much, that he blushes like a girl when his wish is spoken of.\"  Bartja, whose cheeks were really glowing from agitation, bent his head close to his brother's ear, and whispered shortly the story of his love. Sappho's father had helped to defend his native town Phocaea against the hosts of Cyrus, and this fact the boy cleverly brought forward, speaking of the girl he loved as the daughter of a Greek warrior of noble birth. In so saying he spoke the truth, but at the same time he suppressed the facts that this very father had acquired great riches by mercantile undertakings.       [The Persians were forbidden by law to contract debts, because      debtors were necessarily led to say much that was untrue.  Herod. I.      For this reason they held all money transactions m contempt, such      occupations being also very uncongenial to their military tastes.      They despised commerce and abandoned it to the conquered nations.]  He then told his brother how charming, cultivated and loving his Sappho was, and was just going to call on Croesus for a confirmation of his words, when Cambyses interrupted him by kissing his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5455"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 06 (#1)"],["body","and saying: \"You need say no more, brother; do what your heart bids you.  I know the power of love too, and I will help you to gain our mother's consent.\" Bartja threw himself at his brother's feet, overcome with gratitude and joy, but Cambyses raised him kindly and, looking especially at Nitetis and Kassandane, exclaimed: \"Listen, my dear ones, the stem of Cyrus is going to blossom afresh, for our brother Bartja has resolved to put an end to his single life, so displeasing to the gods.       [The Persians were commanded by their religion to marry, and the      unmarried were held up to ridicule.  Vendid.  IV.  Fargard.  130.      The highest duty of man was to create and promote life, and to have      many children was therefore considered praiseworthy.  Herod.  I.      136.]  In a few days the young lover will leave us for your country, Nitetis, and will bring back another jewel from the shores of the Nile to our mountain home.\"  \"What is the matter, sister?\"  cried Atossa, before her brother had finished speaking.  Nitetis had fainted, and Atossa was sprinkling her forehead with wine as she lay in her arms.  \"What was it?\"  asked the blind Kassandane, when Nitetis had awakened to consciousness a few moments later.  \"The joy--the happiness--Tachot,\" faltered Nitetis.  Cambyses, as well as his sister, had sprung to the fainting girl's help.  When she had recovered consciousness, he asked her to take some wine to revive her completely, gave her the cup with his own hand, and then went on at the point at which he had left off in his account: \"Bartja is going to your own country, my wife--to Naukratis on the Nile--to fetch thence the granddaughter of a certain Rhodopis, and daughter of a noble warrior, a native of the brave town of Phocaea, as his wife.\"  \"What was that?\"  cried the blind queen-mother.  \"What is the matter with you?\"  exclaimed Atossa again, in an anxious, almost reproachful tone.  \"Nitetis!\"  cried Croesus admonishingly.  But the warning came too late; the cup which her royal lover had given her slipped from her hands and fell ringing on the floor.  All eyes were fixed on the king's features in anxious suspense.  He had sprung from his seat pale as death; his lips trembled and his fist was clenched.  Nitetis looked up at her lover imploringly, but he was afraid of meeting those wonderful, fascinating eyes, and turned his head away, saying in a hoarse voice: \"Take the women back to their apartments, Boges.  I have seen enough of them--let us begin our drinking-bout--good-night, my mother; take care how you nourish vipers with your heart's blood.  Sleep well, Egyptian, and pray to the gods to give you a more equal power of dissembling your feelings.  To- morrow, my friends, we will go out hunting.  Here, cup-bearer, give me some wine! fill the large goblet, but taste it well--yes, well--for to- day I am afraid of poison; to-day for the first time.  Do you hear, Egyptian?  I am afraid of poison!  and every child knows--ah-ha--that all the poison, as well as the medicine comes from Egypt.\"  Nitetis left the hall,--she hardly knew how,--more staggering than walking.  Boges accompanied her, telling the bearers to make haste.  When they reached the hanging-gardens he gave her up to the care of the eunuch in attendance, and took his leave, not respectfully as usual, but chuckling, rubbing his hands, and speaking in an intimate and confidential tone: \"Dream about the handsome Bartja and his Egyptian lady-love, my white Nile-kitten!  Haven't you any message for the beautiful boy, whose love-story frightened you so terribly?  Think a little.  Poor Boges will very gladly play the go-between; the poor despised Boges wishes you so well--the humble Boges will be so sorry when he sees the proud palm-tree from Sais cut down.  Boges is a prophet; he foretells you a speedy return home to Egypt, or a quiet bed in the black earth in Babylon, and the kind Boges wishes you a peaceful sleep. Farewell, my broken flower, my gay, bright viper, wounded by its own sting, my pretty fir-cone, fallen from the tall pine-tree!\"  \"How dare you speak in this impudent manner?\" said the indignant princess.  \"Thank you,\" answered the wretch, smiling.  \"I shall complain of your conduct,\" threatened Nitetis.  \"You are very amiable,\" answered Boges.  \"Go out of my sight,\" she cried.  \"I will obey your kind and gentle hints;\" he answered softly, as if whispering words of love into her ear.  She started back in disgust and fear at these scornful words; she saw how full of terror they were for her, turned her back on him and went quickly into the house, but his voice rang after her: \"Don't forget my lovely queen, think of me now and then; for everything that happens in the next few days will be a keepsake from the poor despised Boges.\"  As soon as she had disappeared he changed his tone, and commanded the sentries in the severest and most tyrannical manner, to keep a strict watch over the hanging-gardens.  \"Certain death,\" said he, \"to whichever of you allows any one but myself to enter these gardens.  No one, remember--no one--and least of all messengers from the queen-mother, Atossa or any of the great people, may venture to set foot on these steps.  If Croesus or Oropastes should wish to speak to the Egyptian Princess, refuse them decidedly.  Do you understand?  I repeat it, whoever is begged or bribed into disobedience will not see the light of to-morrow's sun.  Nobody may enter these gardens without express permission from my own mouth.  I think you know me.  Here, take these gold staters, your work will be heavier now; but remember, I swear by Plithras not to spare one of you who is careless or disobedient.\"  The men made a due obeisance and determined to obey; they knew that Boges' threats were never meant in joke, and fancied something great must be coming to pass, as the stingy eunuch never spent his staters without good reason.  Boges was carried back to the banqueting-hall in the same litter, which had brought Nitetis away.  The king's wives had left, but the concubines were all standing in their appointed place, singing their monotonous songs, though quite unheard by the uproarious men.  The drinkers had already long forgotten the fainting woman.  The uproar and confusion rose with every fresh wine-cup.  They forgot the dignity of the place where they were assembled, and the presence of their mighty ruler.  They shouted in their drunken joy; warriors embraced one another with a tenderness only excited by wine, here and there a novice was carried away in the arms of a pair of sturdy attendants, while an old hand at the work would seize a wine-jug instead of a goblet, and drain it at a draught amid the cheers of the lookers-on.  The king sat on at the head of the table, pale as death, staring into the wine-cup as if unconscious of what was going on around hint.  But at the sight of his brother his fist clenched.  He would neither speak to him, nor answer his questions.  The longer he sat there gazing into vacancy, the firmer became his conviction that Nitetis had deceived him,--that she had pretended to love him while her heart really belonged to Bartja.  How shamefully they had made sport of him!  How deeply rooted must have been the faithlessness of this clever hypocrite, if the mere news that his brother loved some one else could not only destroy all her powers of dissimulation, but actually deprive her of consciousness!  When Nitetis left the hall, Otanes, the father of Phaedime had called out: \"The Egyptian women seem to take great interest in the love-affairs of their brothers-in-law.  The Persian women are not so generous with their feelings; they keep them for their husbands.\"  Cambyses was too proud to let it be seen that he had heard these words; like the ostrich, he feigned deafness and blindness in order not to seem aware of the looks and murmurs of his guests, which all went to prove that he had been deceived.  Bartja could have had no share in her perfidy; she had loved this handsome youth, and perhaps all the more because she had not been able to hope for a return of her love.  If he had had the slightest suspicion of his brother, he would have killed him on the spot.  Bartja was certainly innocent of any share in the deception and in his brother's misery, but still he was the cause of all; so the old grudge, which had only just been allowed to slumber, woke again; and, as a relapse is always more dangerous than the original illness, the newly-roused anger was more violent than what he had formerly felt.  He thought and thought, but he could not devise a fitting punishment for this false woman.  Her death would not content his vengeance, she must suffer something worse than mere death!  Should he send her back to Egypt, disgraced and shamed?  Oh, no!  she loved her country, and she would be received by her parents with open arms.  Should he, after she had confessed her guilt, (for he was determined to force a confession from her) shut her up in a solitary dungeon?  or should he deliver her over to Boges, to be the servant of his concubines?  Yes! now he had hit upon the right punishment.  Thus the faithless creature should be disciplined, and the hypocrite, who had dared to make sport of him--the All-powerful--forced to atone for her crimes.  Then he said to himself: \"Bartja must not stay here; fire and water have more in common than we two--he always fortunate and happy, and I so miserable.  Some day or other his descendants will divide my treasures, and wear my crown; but as yet I am king, and I will show that I am.\"  The thought of his proud, powerful position flashed through him like lightning.  He woke from his dreams into new life, flung his golden goblet far into the hall, so that the wine flew round like rain, and cried: \"We have had enough of this idle talk and useless noise.  Let us hold a council of war, drunken as we are, and consider what answer we ought to give the Massagetae.  Hystaspes, you "]]]
