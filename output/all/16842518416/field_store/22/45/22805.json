Shortly after the Nubian's return the Queen came back to the palace from the mausoleum.  Her features bore an impress of resolution usually alien to them; nay, the firmly compressed lips gave them an expression of actual sternness.  She knew what duty required, and regarded her approaching end as an inevitable necessity.  Death seemed to her like a journey which she must take in order to escape the most terrible disgrace.  Besides, life after the death of Antony was no longer the same; it had been only a tiresome delay and waiting for the children's sake.  The visit to the tomb had been intended, as it were, to announce her coming to her husband.  She had remained a long time in the silent hall, where she had garlanded the coffin with flowers, kissed it, talked to the dead man as if he were still alive, and told him that the day had come when what he had mentioned in his will as the warmest desire of his heart--to rest beside her in the same tomb--would be fulfilled.  Among the thousand forms of suffering which had assailed her, nothing had seemed so hard to bear as to be deprived of his society and love.  Then she had gone into the garden, embraced and kissed the children, and entreated them to remember her tenderly.  Her purpose had not been concealed from Archibius, but Charmian had told him the menace of the future, and he approved her decision.  By the exertion of all his innate strength of will, he succeeded in concealing the grief which rent his faithful heart.  She must die.  The thought of seeing her adorn the triumphal procession of Octavianus was unbearable to him also.  Her thanks and entreaties to be an affectionate guardian to the children were received with an external calmness which afterwards seemed to him utterly incomprehensible.  When she spoke of her approaching meeting with her lover, he asked whether she had entirely abandoned the teachings of Epicurus, who believed that death absolutely ended existence.  Cleopatra eagerly assented, saying: \"Absence of pain has ceased to appear to me the chief earthly blessing, since I have known that love does not bring pleasure only, since I have learned that pain is the inseparable companion of love.  I will not give it up, nor will I part from my lover. Whoever experiences what fate has allotted to me has learned to know other gods than those whom the master described as dwelling happily in undisturbed repose.  Rather eternal torture in another world, united to the man I love, than painless, joyless mere existence in a desolate, incomprehensible, unknown region!  You will be the last to teach the children to yearn for freedom from pain--\"  \"Because, like you,\" cried Archibius, \"I have learned how great a blessing is love, and that love is pain.\"  As he spoke he bent over her hand to kiss it, but she took his temples between her hands and, bending hastily, pressed her lips on his broad brow.  Then his self-control vanished, and, sobbing aloud, he hurried back to the children.  Cleopatra gazed after him with a sorrowful smile, and leaning on Charmian's arm, she entered the palace.  There she was bathed and, robed in costly mourning garments, reclined among her cushions to take breakfast, which was usually served at this hour.  Iras and Charmian shared it.  When dessert was carried in, the Nubian brought a basket filled with delicious figs.  A peasant, she told Epaphroditus, who was watching the meal, had given them to her because they were so remarkably fine.  Some had already been snatched by the guards.  The Queen and her companions ate a little of the fruit, and Proculejus, who had come to greet Cleopatra, was also persuaded to taste one of the finest figs.  At the end of the meal Cleopatra wished to rest.  The Roman gentlemen and the guards retired.  At last the women were alone, and gazed at each other silently.  Charmian timidly lifted the upper layer of the fruit, but the Queen said mournfully:  \"The wife of Antony dragged through the streets of Rome behind the victor's chariot, a spectacle for the populace and envious matrons! \"Then, starting up, she exclaimed: \"What a thought!  Was it too great for Octavianus, or too petty?  He who so loudly boasts his knowledge of mankind expects this impossibility from the woman who revealed her inmost soul to him as fully as he concealed his from her.  We will show him how small is his comprehension of human nature, and teach him modesty.\"  A contemptuous smile flitted over her beautiful lips as, with rapid movements, she flung handful after handful of figs on the table, till she saw some thing stirring under the fruit, and with a sigh of relief exclaimed under her breath:  \"There it is!\" as with hasty resolution she held out her arm towards the asp, which hissed at her.  While gazing intently at the movements of the viper, which seemed afraid to fulfil the dread office, she said to her attendants:  \"I thank you-thank you for everything.  Be calm.  You know, Iras, it will cause no pain.  They say it is like falling asleep.\"  Then she shuddered slightly, adding: \"Death is a solemn thing; yet it must be.  Why does the serpent delay?  There, there; I will keep firm.  Ambition and love were the moving forces of my life.  Men shall praise my memory.--I follow you, Mark Antony!\"  Charmian bent over the left arm of her royal mistress, which hung loosely at her side, and, weeping aloud, covered it with kisses, while Cleopatra, watching the motions of the asp still more closely, added:  \"The peace of our garden of Epicurus will begin to-day.  Whether it will be painless, who can tell?  Yet--there I agree with  Archibius--life's greatest joy--love--is blended with pain, as yonder branch of exquisite roses from Dolabella, the last gift of friendship, has its sharp thorns. I think you have both experienced this.  The twins and my little darling --When they think of their mother and her end, will not the children--\"  Here she uttered a low cry.  The asp had struck its fangs into the upper part of her arm like an icy flash of lightning, and a few instants later Cleopatra sank back upon her pillows lifeless.  Iras, pale but calm, pointed to her, saying \"Like a sleeping child. Bewitching even in death.  Fate itself was constrained to do her will and fulfil the last desire of the great Queen, the victorious woman, whom no heart resisted.  Its decree shatters the presumptuous plan of Octavianus. The victor will show himself to the Romans without thee, thou dear one.\"  Sobbing violently, she bent over the inanimate form, closed the eyes, and kissed the lips and brow.  The weeping Charmian did the same.  Then the footsteps of men were heard in the anteroom, and Iras, who was the first to notice them, cried eagerly:  \"The moment is approaching!  I am glad it is close at hand.  Does it not seem to you also as if the very sun in the heavens was darkened?\" Charmian nodded assent, and whispered, \"The poison?\"  \"Here!\"  replied Iras calmly, holding out  a plain pin.  \"One little prick, and the deed will be done.  Look!  But no.  You once inflicted the deepest suffering upon me.  You know--Dion, the playmate of my childhood --It is forgiven.  But now--you will do me a kindness.  You will spare my using the pin myself.  Will you not?  I will repay you.  If you wish, my hand shall render you the same service.\"  Charmian clasped her niece to her heart, kissed her, pricked her arm lightly, and gave her the other pin, saying:  \"Now it is your turn.  Our hearts were filled with love for one who understood how to bestow it as none other ever did, and our love was returned.  What matters all else that we sacrificed?  Those on whom the sun shines need no other light.  Love is pain,\" she said in dying, \"but this pain--especially that of renunciation for love's sake--bears with it a joy, an exquisite joy, which renders death easy.  To me it seems as if it were merely following the Queen to--Oh, that hurt!\"  Iras's pin had pricked her.  The poison did its work quickly.  Iras was seized with giddiness, and could scarcely stand.  Charmian had just sunk on her knees, when some one knocked loudly at the closed door, and the voices of Epaphroditus and Proculejus imperiously demanded admittance.  When no answer followed, the lock was hastily burst open.  Charmian was found lying pale and distorted at the feet of her royal mistress; but Iras, tottering and half stupefied by the poison, was adjusting the diadem, which had slipped from its place.  To keep from her beloved Queen everything that could detract from her beauty had been her last care.  Enraged, fairly frantic with wrath, the Romans rushed towards the women. Epaphroditus had seen Iras still occupied in arranging Cleopatra's ornaments.  Now he endeavoured to raise her companion, saying reproachfully, \"Charmian, was this well done?\"  Summoning her last strength, she answered in a faltering voice, \"Perfectly well, and worthy a descendant of Egyptian kings.\"  Her eyes closed, but Proculejus, the author, who had gazed long with deep emotion into the beautiful proud face of the Queen whom he had so greatly wronged, said: \"No other woman on earth was ever so admired by the greatest, so loved by the loftiest. Her fame echoed from nation to nation throughout the world.  It will continue to resound from generation to generation; but however loudly men may extol the bewitching charm, the fervour of the love which survived death, her intellect, her knowledge, the heroic courage with which she preferred the tomb to ignominy--the praise of these two must not be forgotten.  Their fidelity deserves it.  By their marvellous end they unconsciously erected the most beautiful monument to their mistress; for what genuine goodness and lovableness must have been possessed by the woman who, after the greatest reverses, made it seem more desirable to those nearest to her person to die than to live without her!\"       [The Roman's exclamation and the answer of the loyal dying Charmian"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54812"],["title","A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin (#0)"],["body","KEY                                    TO                            UNCLE TOM’S CABIN;                         PRESENTING THE ORIGINAL                           FACTS AND DOCUMENTS                     UPON WHICH THE STORY IS FOUNDED.

The work which the writer here presents to the public is one which has been written with no pleasure, and with much pain.  In fictitious writing, it is possible to find refuge from the hard and the terrible, by inventing scenes and characters of a more pleasing nature. No such resource is open in a work of fact; and the subject of this work is one on which the truth, if told at all, must needs be very dreadful. There is no bright side to slavery, as such. Those scenes which are made bright by the generosity and kindness of masters and mistresses, would be brighter still if the element of slavery were withdrawn. There is nothing picturesque or beautiful, in the family attachment of old servants, which is not to be found in countries where these servants are legally free. The tenants on an English estate are often more fond and faithful than if they were slaves. Slavery, therefore, is not the element which forms the picturesque and beautiful of Southern life. What is peculiar to slavery, and distinguishes it from free servitude, is evil, and only evil, and that continually.  In preparing this work, it has grown much beyond the author’s original design. It has so far overrun its limits that she has been obliged to omit one whole department;—that of the characteristics and developments of the colored race in various countries and circumstances. This is more properly the subject for a volume; and she hopes that such an one will soon be prepared by a friend to whom she has transferred her materials.  The author desires to express her thanks particularly to those legal gentlemen who have given her their assistance and support in the legal part of the discussion. She also desires to thank those, at the North and at the South, who have kindly furnished materials for her use. Many more have been supplied than could possibly be used. The book is actually selected out of a mountain of materials.  The great object of the author in writing has been to bring this subject of slavery, as a moral and religious question, before the minds of all those who profess to be followers of Christ, in this country. A minute history has been given of the action of the various denominations on this subject.  The writer has aimed, as far as possible, to say what is true, and only that, without regard to the effect which it may have upon any person or party. She hopes that what she has said will be examined without bitterness,—in that serious and earnest spirit which is appropriate for the examination of so very serious a subject. It would be vain for her to indulge the hope of being wholly free from error. In the wide field which she has been called to go over, there is a possibility of many mistakes. She can only say that she has used the most honest and earnest endeavors to learn the truth.  The book is commended to the candid attention and earnest prayers of all true Christians, throughout the world. May they unite their prayers that Christendom may be delivered from so great an evil as slavery!                                     PART I.                                    CHAPTER I.   At different times, doubt has been expressed whether the representations of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” are a fair representation of slavery as it at present exists. This work, more, perhaps, than any other work of fiction that ever was written, has been a collection and arrangement of real incidents,—of actions really performed, of words and expressions really uttered,—grouped together with reference to a general result, in the same manner that the mosaic artist groups his fragments of various stones into one general picture. His is a mosaic of gems,—this is a mosaic of facts.  Artistically considered, it might not be best to point out in which quarry and from which region each fragment of the mosaic picture had its origin; and it is equally unartistic to disentangle the glittering web of fiction, and show out of what real warp and woof it is woven, and with what real coloring dyed. But the book had a purpose entirely transcending the artistic one, and accordingly encounters, at the hands of the public, demands not usually made on fictitious works. It is _treated_ as a reality,—sifted, tried and tested, as a reality; and therefore as a reality it may be proper that it should be defended.  The writer acknowledges that the book is a very inadequate representation of slavery; and it is so, necessarily, for this reason,—that slavery, in some of its workings, is too dreadful for the purposes of art. A work which should represent it strictly as it is would be a work which could not be read. And all works which ever mean to give pleasure must draw a veil somewhere, or they cannot succeed.  The author will now proceed along the course of the story, from the first page onward, and develop, as far as possible, the incidents by which different parts were suggested.                                   CHAPTER II.                                MR. HALEY.   In the very first chapter of the book we encounter the character of the negro-trader, Mr. Haley. His name stands at the head of this chapter as the representative of all the different characters introduced in the work which exhibit the trader, the kidnapper, the negro-catcher, the negro-whipper, and all the other inevitable auxiliaries and indispensable appendages of what is often called the “divinely-instituted relation” of slavery. The author’s first personal observation of this class of beings was somewhat as follows:  Several years ago, while one morning employed in the duties of the nursery, a colored woman was announced. She was ushered into the nursery, and the author thought, on first survey, that a more surly, unpromising face she had never seen. The woman was thoroughly black, thick-set, firmly built, and with strongly-marked African features. Those who have been accustomed to read the expressions of the African face know what a peculiar effect is produced by a lowering, desponding expression upon its dark features. It is like the shadow of a thunder-cloud. Unlike her race generally, the woman did not smile when smiled upon, nor utter any pleasant remark in reply to such as were addressed to her. The youngest pet of the nursery, a boy about three years old, walked up, and laid his little hand on her knee, and seemed astonished not to meet the quick smile which the negro almost always has in reserve for the little child. The writer thought her very cross and disagreeable, and, after a few moments’ silence, asked, with perhaps a little impatience, “Do you want anything of me to-day?”  “Here are some papers,” said the woman, pushing them towards her; “perhaps you would read them.”  The first paper opened was a letter from a negro-trader in Kentucky, stating concisely that he had waited about as long as he could for her child; that he wanted to start for the South, and must get it off his hands; that, if she would send him two hundred dollars before the end of the week, she should have it; if not, that he would set it up at auction, at the court-house door, on Saturday. He added, also, that he might have got more than that for the child, but that he was willing to let her have it cheap.  “What sort of a man is this?” said the author to the woman, when she had done reading the letter.  “Dunno, ma’am; great Christian, I know,—member of the Methodist church, anyhow.”  The expression of sullen irony with which this was said was a thing to be remembered.  “And how old is this child?” said the author to her.  The woman looked at the little boy who had been standing at her knee, with an expressive glance, and said, “She will be three years old this summer.”  On further inquiry into the history of the woman, it appeared that she had been set free by the will of her owners; that the child was legally entitled to freedom, but had been seized on by the heirs of the estate. She was poor and friendless, without money to maintain a suit, and the heirs, of course, threw the child into the hands of the trader. The necessary sum, it may be added, was all raised in the small neighborhood which then surrounded the Lane Theological Seminary, and the child was redeemed.  If the public would like a specimen of the correspondence which passes between these worthies, who are the principal reliance of the community for supporting and extending the institution of slavery, the following may be interesting as a matter of literary curiosity. It was forwarded by Mr. M. J. Thomas, of Philadelphia, to the _National Era_, and stated by him to be “a copy taken verbatim from "]]]
