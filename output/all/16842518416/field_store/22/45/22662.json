Ani again acted as his charioteer; they drove slowly through the long ranks of invalids and convalescents, but suddenly Ani gave the reins an involuntary pull, the horses reared, and it was with difficulty that he soothed them to a steady pace again.  Rameses looked round in anxious surprise, for at the moment when the horses had started, he too had felt an agitating thrill--he thought he had caught sight of his preserver at Kadesh.  Had the sight of a God struck terror into the horses?  Was he the victim of a delusion? or was his preserver a man of flesh and blood, who had come home from the battle-field among the wounded!  The man who stood by his side, and held the reins, could have informed him, for Ani had recognized Pentaur, and in his horror had given the reins a perilous jerk.     CHAPTER XLI.  The king did not return to the great pavilion till after sun-down; the banqueting hall, illuminated with a thousand lamps, was now filled with the gay crowd of guests who awaited the arrival of the king.  All bowed before him, as he entered, more or less low, each according to his rank; he immediately seated himself on his throne, surrounded by his children in a wide semicircle, and his officers and retainers all passed before him; for each he had a kindly word or glance, winning respect from all, and filling every one with joy and hope.  \"The only really divine attribute of my royal condition,\" said he to himself, \"is that it is so easy to a king to make men happy.  My predecessors chose the poisonous Uraeus as the emblem of their authority, for we can cause death as quickly and certainly as the venomous snake; but the power of giving happiness dwells on our own lips, and in our own eyes, and we need some instrument when we decree death.\"  \"Take the Uraeus crown from my head,\" he continued aloud, as he seated himself at the feast.  \"Today I will wear a wreath of flowers.\"  During the ceremony of bowing to the king, two men had quitted the hall-- the Regent Ani, and the high-priest Ameni.  Ani ordered a small party of the watch to go and seek out the priest Pentaur in the tents of the wounded by the harbor, to bring the poet quietly to his tent, and to guard him there till his return.  He still had in his possession the maddening potion, which he was to have given to the captain of the transport-boat, and it was open to him still to receive Pentaur either as a guest or as a prisoner.  Pentaur might injure him, whether Katuti's project failed or succeeded.  Ameni left the pavilion to go to see old Gagabu, who had stood so long in the heat of the sun during the ceremony of receiving the conqueror, that he had been at last carried fainting to the tent which he shared with the high-priest, and which was not far from that of the Regent.  He found the old man much revived, and was preparing to mount his chariot to go to the banquet, when the Regent's myrmidons led Pentaur past in front of him. Ameni looked doubtfully at the tall and noble figure of the prisoner, but Pentaur recognized him, called him by his name, and in a moment they stood together, hand clasped in hand.  The guards showed some uneasiness, but Ameni explained who he was.  The high-priest was sincerely rejoiced at the preservation and restoration of his favorite disciple, whom for many months he had mourned as dead; he looked at his manly figure with fatherly tenderness, and desired the guards, who bowed to his superior dignity, to conduct his friend, on his responsibility; to his tent instead of to Ani's.  There Pentaur found his old friend Gagabu, who wept with delight at his safety.  All that his master had accused him of seemed to be forgotten. Ameni had him clothed in a fresh white robe, he was never tired of looking at him, and over and over again clapped his hand upon his shoulder, as if he were his own son that had been lost and found again.  Pentaur was at once required to relate all that had happened to him, and the poet told the story of his captivity and liberation at Mount Sinai, his meeting with Bent-Anat, and how he had fought in the battle of Kadesh, had been wounded by an arrow, and found and rescued by the faithful Kaschta.  He concealed only his passion for Bent-Anat, and the fact that he had preserved the king's life.  \"About an hour ago,\" he added, \"I was sitting alone in my tent, watching the lights in the palace yonder, when the watch who are outside brought me an order from the Regent to accompany them to his tent.  What can he want with me?  I always thought he owed me a grudge.\"  Gagabu and Ameni glanced meaningly at each other, and the high-priest then hastened away, as already he had remained too long away from the banquet.  Before he got into his chariot he commanded the guard to return to their posts, and took it upon himself to inform the Regent that his guest would remain in his tent till the festival was over; the soldiers unhesitatingly obeyed him.  Ameni arrived at the palace before them, and entered the banqueting-hall just as Ani was assigning a place to each of his guests.  The high-priest went straight up to him, and said, as he bowed before him:  \"Pardon my long delay, but I was detained by a great surprise.  The poet Pentaur is living--as you know.  I have invited him to remain in my tent as my guest, and to tend the prophet Gagabu.\"  The Regent turned pale, he remained speechless and looked at Ameni with a cold ghastly smile; but he soon recovered himself.  \"You see,\" he said, \"how you have injured me by your unworthy suspicions; I meant to have restored your favorite to you myself to-morrow.\"  \"Forgive me, then, for having anticipated your plan,\" said Ameni, taking his seat near the king.  Hundreds of slaves hurried to and fro loaded with costly dishes.  Large vessels of richly wrought gold and silver were brought into the hall on wheels, and set on the side-boards.  Children were perched in the shells and lotus-flowers that hung from the painted rafters; and from between the pillars, that were hung with cloudy transparent tissues, they threw roses and violets down on the company. The sounds of harps and songs issued from concealed rooms, and from an altar, six ells high, in the middle of the hall, clouds of incense were wafted into space.  The king-one of whose titles was \"Son of the Sun,\"--was as radiant as the sun himself.  His children were once more around him, Mena was his cupbearer as in former times, and all that was best and noblest in the land was gathered round him to rejoice with him in his triumph and his return.  Opposite to him sat the ladies, and exactly in front of him, a delight to his eyes, Bent-Anat and Nefert.  His injunction to Mena to hold the wine cup steadily seemed by no means superfluous, for his looks constantly wandered from the king's goblet to his fair wife, from whose lips he as yet had heard no word of welcome, whose hand he had not yet been so happy as to touch.  All the guests were in the most joyful excitement.  Rameses related the tale of his fight at Kadesh, and the high-priest of Heliopolis observed In later times the poets will sing of thy deeds.\"  \"Their songs will not be of my achievements,\" exclaimed the king, \"but of the grace of the Divinity, who so miraculously rescued your sovereign, and gave the victory to the Egyptians over an innumerable enemy.\"  \"Did you see the God with your own eyes? and in what form did he appear to you?\" asked Bent-Anat.  \"It is most extraordinary,\" said the king, \"but he exactly resembled the dead father of the traitor Paaker.  My preserver was of tall stature, and had a beautiful countenance; his voice was deep and thrilling, and he swung his battle-axe as if it were a mere plaything.\"  Ameni had listened eagerly to the king's words, now he bowed low before him and said humbly: \"If I were younger I myself would endeavor, as was the custom with our fathers, to celebrate this glorious deed of a God and of his sublime son in a song worthy of this festival; but melting tones are no longer mine, they vanish with years, and the car of the listener lends itself only to the young.  Nothing is wanting to thy feast, most lordly Ani, but a poet, who might sing the glorious deeds of our monarch to the sound of his lute, and yet--we have at hand the gifted Pentaur, the noblest disciple of the House of Seti.\"  Bent-Anat turned perfectly white, and the priests who were present expressed the utmost joy and astonishment, for they had long thought the young poet, who was highly esteemed throughout Egypt, to be dead.  The king had often heard of the fame of Pentaur from his sons and especially from Rameri, and he willingly consented that Ameni should send for the poet, who had himself borne arms at Kadesh, in order that he should sing a song of triumph.  The Regent gazed blankly and uneasily into his wine cup, and the high-priest rose to fetch Pentaur himself into the presence of the king.  During the high-priest's absence, more and more dishes were served to the company; behind each guest stood a silver bowl with rose water, in which from time to time he could dip his fingers to cool and clean them; the slaves in waiting were constantly at hand with embroidered napkins to wipe them, and others frequently changed the faded wreaths, round the heads and shoulders of the feasters, for fresh ones.  \"How pale you are, my child!\"  said Rameses turning to Bent-Anat. \"If you are tired, your uncle will no doubt allow you to leave the hall; though I think you should stay to hear the performance of this much- lauded poet.  After having been so highly praised he will find it difficult to satisfy his hearers.  But indeed I am uneasy about you, my child--would you rather go?\"  The Regent had risen and said earnestly, \"Your presence has done me honor, but if you are fatigued I beg you to allow me to conduct you and your ladies to the apartments intended for you.\"  \"I will stay,\" said Bent-Anat in a low but decided tone, and she kept"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5448"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 10 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      UARDA  Volume 10.  By Georg Ebers    CHAPTER XLII.  The cloudless vault of heaven spread over the plain of Pelusium, the stars were bright, the moon threw her calm light over the thousands of tents which shone as white as little hillocks of snow.  All was silent, the soldiers and the Egyptians, who had assembled to welcome the king, were now all gone to rest.  There had been great rejoicing and jollity in the camp; three enormous vats, garlanded with flowers and overflowing with wine, which spilt with every movement of the trucks on which they were drawn by thirty oxen, were sent up and down the little streets of tents, and as the evening closed in tavern-booths were erected in many spots in the camp, at which the Regent's servants supplied the soldiers with red and white wine.  The tents of the populace were only divided from the pavilion of the Pharaoh by the hastily-constructed garden in the midst of which it stood, and the hedge which enclosed it.  The tent of the Regent himself was distinguished from all the others by its size and magnificence; to the right of it was the encampment of the different priestly deputations, to the left that of his suite; among the latter were the tents of his friend Katuti, a large one for her own use, and some smaller ones for her servants.  Behind Ani's pavilion stood a tent, enclosed in a wall or screen of canvas, within which old Hekt was lodged; Ani had secretly conveyed her hither on board his own boat.  Only Katuti and his confidential servants knew who it was that lay concealed in the mysteriously shrouded abode.  While the banquet was proceeding in the great pavilion, the witch was sitting in a heap on the sandy earth of her conical canvas dwelling; she breathed with difficulty, for a weakness of the heart, against which she had long struggled, now oppressed her more frequently and severely; a little lamp of clay burned before her, and on her lap crouched a sick and ruffled hawk; the creature shivered from time to time, closing the filmy lids of his keen eyes, which glowed with a dull fire when Hekt took him up in her withered hand, and tried to blow some air into his hooked beak, still ever ready to peck and tear her.  At her feet little Scherau lay asleep.  Presently she pushed the child with her foot.  \"Wake up,\" she said, as he raised himself still half asleep.  \"You have young ears--it seemed to me that I heard a woman scream in Ani's tent.  Do you hear any thing?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" exclaimed the little one.  \"There is a noise like crying, and that--that was a scream!  It came from out there, from Nemu's tent.\"  \"Creep through  there,\" said the witch, \"and see what is happening!\"  The child obeyed: Hekt turned her attention again to the bird, which no longer perched in her lap, but lay on one side, though it still tried to use its talons, when she took him up in her hand.  \"It is all over with him,\" muttered the old woman, \"and the one I called Rameses is sleeker than ever.  It is all folly and yet--and yet! the Regent's game is over, and he has lost it.  The creature is stretching itself--its head drops--it draws itself up--one more clutch at my dress --now it is dead!\"  She contemplated the dead hawk in her lap for some minutes, then she took it up, flung it into a corner of the tent, and exclaimed:  \"Good-bye, King Ani.  The crown is not for you!\"  Then she went on: \"What project has he in hand now, I wonder?  Twenty times he has asked me whether the great enterprise will succeed; as if I knew any more than he! And Nemu too has hinted all kinds of things, though he would not speak out.  Something is going on, and I--and I?  There it comes again.\"  The old woman pressed her hand to her heart and closed her eyes, her features were distorted with pain; she did not perceive Scherau's return, she did not hear him call her name, or see that, when she did not answer him, he left her again.  For an hour or more she remained unconscious, then her senses returned, but she felt as if some ice-cold fluid slowly ran through her veins instead of the warm blood.  \"If I had kept a hawk for myself too,\" she muttered, \"it would soon follow the other one in the corner!  If only Ani keeps his word, and has me embalmed!  \"But how can he when he too is so near his end.  They will let me rot and disappear, and there will be no future for me, no meeting with Assa.\"  The old woman remained silent for a long time; at last she murmured hoarsely with her eyes fixed on the ground:  \"Death brings release, if only from the torment of remembrance.  But there is a life beyond the grave.  I do not, I will not cease to hope. The dead shall all be equally judged, and subject to the inscrutable decrees.--Where shall I find him?  Among the blest, or among the damned? And I?  It matters not!  The deeper the abyss into which they fling me the better.  Can Assa, if he is among the blest, remain in bliss, when he sees to what he has brought me?  Oh! they must embalm me--I cannot bear to vanish, and rot and evaporate into nothingness!\"  While she was still speaking, the dwarf Nemu had come into the tent; Scherau, seeing the old woman senseless, had run to tell him that his mother was lying on the earth with her eyes shut, and was dying.  The witch perceived the little man.  \"It is well,\" she said, \"that you have come; I shall be dead before sunrise.\"  \"Mother!\"  cried the dwarf horrified, \"you shall live, and live better than you have done till now!  Great things are happening, and for us!\"  \"I know, I know,\" said Hekt.  \"Go away, Scherau--now, Nemu, whisper in my ear what is doing?\"  The dwarf felt as if he could not avoid the influence of her eye, he went up to her, and said softly--\"The pavilion, in which the king and his people are sleeping, is constructed of wood; straw and pitch are built into the walls, and laid under the boards.  As soon as they are gone to rest we shall set the tinder thing on fire.  The guards are drunk and sleeping.\"  \"Well thought of,\" said Hekt.  \"Did you plan it?\"  \"I and my mistress,\" said the dwarf not without pride.  \"You can devise a plot,\" said the old woman, \"but you are feeble in the working out.  Is your plan a secret? Have you clever assistants?\"  \"No one knows of it,\" replied the dwarf, \"but Katuti, Paaker, and I; we three shall lay the brands to the spots we have fixed upon.  I am going to the rooms of Bent-Anat; Katuti, who can go in and out as she pleases, will set fire to the stairs, which lead to the upper story, and which fall by touching a spring; and Paaker to the king's apartments.\"  \"Good-good, it may succeed,\" gasped the old woman.  \"But what was the scream in your tent?\"  The dwarf seemed doubtful about answering; but Hekt went on:  \"Speak without fear--the dead are sure to be silent.\"  The dwarf, trembling with agitation, shook off his hesitation, and said:  \"I have found Uarda, the grandchild of Pinem, who had disappeared, and I decoyed her here, for she and no other shall be my wife, if Ani is king, and if Katuti makes me rich and free.  She is in the service of the Princess Bent-Anat, and sleeps in her anteroom, and she must not be burnt with her mistress.  She insisted on going back to the palace, so, as she would fly to the fire like a gnat, and I would not have her risk being burnt, I tied her up fast.\"  \"Did she not struggle?\"  said Hekt.  \"Like a mad thing,\" said the dwarf.  \"But the Regent's dumb slave, who was ordered by his master to obey me in everything to-day, helped me. We tied up her mouth that she might not be heard screaming!\"  \"Will you leave her alone when you go to do your errand?\"  \"Her father is with her!\"  \"Kaschta, the red-beard?\"  asked the old woman in surprise.  \"And did he not break you in pieces like an earthenware pot?\"  \"He will not stir,\" said Nemu laughing.  \"For when I found him, I made him so drunk with Ani's old wine that he lies there like a mummy.  It was from him that I learned where Uarda was, and I went to her, and got her to come with me by telling her that her father was very ill, and begged her to go to see him once more.  She flew after me like a gazelle, and when she saw the soldier lying there senseless she threw herself upon him, and called for water to cool his head, for he was raving in his dreams of rats and mice that had fallen upon him.  As it grew late she wanted to return to her mistress, and we were obliged to prevent her. How handsome she has grown, mother; you cannot imagine how pretty she is.\"  \"Aye, aye!\"  said Hekt.  \"You will have to keep an eye upon her when she is your wife.\"  \"I will treat her like the wife of a noble,\" said Nemu.  \"And pay a real lady to guard her.  But by this time Katuti has brought home her daughter, Mena's wife; the stars are sinking and--there--that was the first signal.  When Katuti whistles the third time we are to go to work. Lend me your fire-box, mother.\"  \"Take it,\" said Hekt.  \"I shall never need it again.  It is all over with me!  How your hand shakes!  Hold the wood firmly, or you will drop it before you have brought the fire.\"  The dwarf bid the old woman farewell, and she let him kiss her without moving.  When he was gone, she listened eagerly for any sound that might pierce the silence of the night, her eyes shone with a keen light, and a thousand thoughts flew through her restless brain.  When she heard the second signal on Katuti's silver whistle, she sat upright and muttered:  \"That gallows-bird Paaker, his vain aunt and that villain Ani, are no match for Rameses, even when he is asleep.  Ani's hawk is dead; he has nothing to hope for from Fortune, and I nothing to hope for from him. But if Rameses--if the real king would promise me--then my poor old body --Yes, that is the thing, that is what I will do.\"  "]]]
