Euergetes turned his back on her, and spoke to his brother of indifferent subjects, while she drew lines, some straight and some crooked, with her fan-stick through the pile of the soft rug on the floor, and sat gazing thoughtfully at her feet.  As she sat thus her eye was caught by her sandals, richly set with precious stones, and the slender toes she had so often contemplated with pleasure; but now the sight of them seemed to vex her, for in obedience to a swift impulse she loosened the straps, pushed off her right sandal with her left foot, kicked it from her, and said, turning to her husband:  \"It is late and I do not feel well, and you may sup without me.\"  \"By the healing Isis!\"  exclaimed Philometor, going up to her.  \"You look suffering.  Shall I send for the physicians?  Is it really nothing more than your usual headache?  The gods be thanked!  But that you should be unwell just to-day!  I had so much to say to you; and the chief thing of all was that we are still a long way from completeness in our preparations for our performance.  If this luckless Hebe were not--\"  \"She is in good hands,\" interrupted Euergetes.  \"The Roman, Publius Scipio, has taken her to a place of safety; perhaps in order to present her to me to morrow morning in return for the horses from Cyrene which I sent him to-day.  How brightly your eyes sparkle, sister--with joy no doubt at this good idea.  This evening, I dare say he is rehearsing the little one in her part that she may perform it well to-morrow.  If we are mistaken--if Publius is ungrateful and proposes keeping the dove, then Thais, your pretty Athenian waiting-woman, may play the part of Hebe. What do you think of that suggestion, Cleopatra?\"  \"That I forbid such jesting with me!\"  cried the queen vehemently. \"No one has any consideration for me--no one pities me, and I suffer fearfully!  Euergetes scorns me--you, Philometor, would be glad to drag me down!  If only the banquet is not interfered with, and so long as nothing spoils your pleasure!--Whether I die or no, no one cares!\"  With these words the queen burst into tears, and roughly pushed away her husband as he endeavored to soothe her.  At last she dried her eyes, and said: \"Go down-the guests are waiting.\"  \"Immediately, my love,\" replied Philometor.  \"But one thing I must tell you, for I know that it will arouse your sympathy.  The Roman read to you the petition for pardon for Philotas, the chief of the Chrematistes and 'relative of the king,' which contains such serious charges against Eulaeus.  I was ready with all my heart to grant your wish and to pardon the man who is the father of these miserable water-bearers; but, before having the decree drawn up, I had the lists of the exiles to the gold- mines carefully looked through, and there it was discovered that Philotas and his wife have both been dead more than half a year.  Death has settled this question, and I cannot grant to Publius the first service he has asked of me--asked with great urgency too.  I am sorry for this, both for his sake and for that of poor Philotas, who was held in high esteem by our mother.\"  \"May the ravens devour them!\" answered Cleopatra, pressing her forehead against the ivory frame which surrounded the stuffed back of her seat. \"Once more I beg of you excuse me from all further speech.\"  This time the two kings obeyed her wishes.  When Euergetes offered her his hand she said with downcast eyes, and poking her fan-stick into the wool of the carpet:  \"I will visit you early to-morrow.\"  \"After the first sacrifice,\" added Euergetes.  \"If I know you well, something that you will then hear will please you greatly; very greatly indeed, I should think.  Bring the children with you; that I ask of you as a birthday request.\"     CHAPTER XX.  The royal chariot in which Klea was standing, wrapped in the cloak and wearing the hat of the captain of the civic guard, went swiftly and without stopping through the streets of Memphis.  As long as she saw houses with lighted windows on each side of the way, and met riotous soldiers and quiet citizens going home from the taverns, or from working late in their workshops, with lanterns in their hands or carried by their slaves--so long her predominant feeling was one of hatred to Publius; and mixed with this was a sentiment altogether new to her--a sentiment that made her blood boil, and her heart now stand still and then again beat wildly--the thought that he might be a wretched deceiver.  Had he not attempted to entrap one of them--whether her sister or herself it was all the same--wickedly to betray her, and to get her into his power!  \"With me,\" thought she, \"he could not hope to gain his evil ends, and when he saw that I knew how to protect myself he lured the poor unresisting child away with him, in order to ruin her and to drag her into shame and misery.  Just like Rome herself, who seizes on one country after another to make them her own, so is this ruthless man.  No sooner had that villain Eulaeus' letter reached him, than he thought himself justified in believing that I too was spellbound by a glance from his eyes, and would spread my wings to fly into his arms; and so he put out his greedy hand to catch me too, and threw aside the splendor and delights of a royal banquet to hurry by night out into the desert, and to risk a hideous death--for the avenging deities still punish the evildoer.\"  By this time she was shrouded in total darkness, for the moon was still hidden by black clouds.  Memphis was already behind her, and the chariot was passing through a tall-stemmed palm-grove, where even at mid-day deep shades intermingled with the sunlight.  When, just at this spot, the thought once more pierced her soul that the seducer was devoted to death, she felt as though suddenly a bright glaring light had flashed up in her and round her, and she could have broken out into a shout of joy like one who, seeking retribution for blood, places his foot at last on the breast of his fallen foe.  She clenched her teeth tightly and grasped her girdle, in which she had stuck the knife given her by the smith.  If the charioteer by her side had been Publius, she would have stabbed him to the heart with the weapon with delight, and then have thrown herself under the horses' hoofs and the brazen wheels of the chariot.  But no!  Still more gladly would she have found him dying in the desert, and before his heart had ceased to beat have shouted in his ear how much she hated him; and then, when his breast no longer heaved a breath--then she would have flung herself upon him, and have kissed his dimmed eyes.  Her wildest thoughts of vengeance were as inseparable from tender pity and the warmest longings of a heart overflowing with love, as the dark waters of a river are from the brighter flood of a stream with which it has recently mingled.  All the passionate impulses which had hitherto been slumbering in her soul were set free, and now raised their clamorous voices as she was whirled across the desert through the gloom of night. The wishes roused in her breast by her hatred appealing to her on one side and her love singing in her ear, in tempting flute-tones, on the other, jostled and hustled one another, each displacing the other as they crowded her mind in wild confusion.  As she proceeded on her journey she felt that she could have thrown herself like a tigress on her victim, and yet--like an outcast woman--have flung herself at Publius' knees in supplication for the love that was denied her.  She had lost all idea of time and distance, and started as from a wild and bewildering dream when the chariot suddenly halted, and the driver said in his rough tones:  \"Here we are, I must turn back again.\"  She shuddered, drew the cloak more closely round her, sprang out on to the road, and stood there motionless till the charioteer said:  \"I have not spared my horses, my noble gentleman.  Won't you give me something to get a drop of wine?\"  Klea's whole possessions were two silver drachma, of which she herself owned one and the other belonged to Irene.  On the last anniversary but one of his mother's death, the king had given at the temple a sum to be divided among all the attendants, male and female, who served Serapis, and a piece of silver had fallen to the share of herself and her sister.  Klea had them both about her in a little bag, which also contained a ring that her mother had given her at parting, and the amulet belonging to Serapion.  The girl took out the two silver coins and gave them to the driver, who, after testing the liberal gift with his fingers, cried out as he turned his horses:  \"A pleasant night to you, and may Aphrodite and all the Loves be favorable!\"  \"Irene's drachma!\"  muttered Klea to herself, as the chariot rolled away. The sweet form of her sister rose before her mind; she recalled the hour when the girl--still but a child--had entrusted it to her, because she lost everything unless Klea took charge of it for her.  \"Who will watch her and care for her now?\"  she asked herself, and she stood thinking, trying to defend herself against the wild wishes which again began to stir in her, and to collect her scattered thoughts.  She had involuntarily avoided the beam of light which fell across the road from the tavern-window, and yet she could not help raising her eyes and looking along it, and she found herself looking through the darkness which enveloped her, straight into the faces of two men whose gaze was directed to the very spot where she was standing.  And what faces they were that she saw!  One, a fat face, framed in thick hair and a short, thick and ragged beard, was of a dusky brown and as coarse and brutal as the other was smooth, colorless and lean, cruel and crafty.  The eyes of the first of these ruffians were prominent, weak and bloodshot, with a fixed glassy stare, while those of the other seemed always to be on the watch with a restless and uneasy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5464"],["title","The Sisters — Volume 4 (#8)"],["body","eer.  These were Euergetes' assassins--they must be!  Spellbound with terror and revulsion she stood quite still, fearing only that the ruffians might hear the beating of her heart, for she felt as if it were a hammer swung up and down in an empty space, and beating with loud echoes, now in her bosom and now in her throat.  \"The young gentleman must have gone round behind the tavern--he knows the shortest way to the 'tombs.  Let us go after him, and finish off the business at once,\" said the broad-shouldered villain in a hoarse whisper that broke down every now and then, and which seemed to Klea even more repulsive than the monster's face.  \"So that he may hear us go after him-stupid!\"  answered the other.  \"When he has been waiting for his sweetheart about a quarter of an hour I will call his name in a woman's voice, and at his first step towards the desert do you break his neck with the sand-bag.  We have plenty of time yet, for it must still be a good half hour before midnight.\"  \"So much the better,\" said the other.  \"Our wine-jar is not nearly empty yet, and we paid the lazy landlord for it in advance, before he crept into bed.\"  \"You shall only drink two cups more,\" said the punier villain.  \"For this time we have to do with a sturdy fellow, Setnam is not with us now to lend a hand in the work, and the dead meat must show no gaping thrusts or cuts.  My teeth are not like yours when you are fasting--even cooked food must not be too tough for them to chew it, now-a-days.  If you soak yourself in drink and fail in your blow, and I am not ready with the poisoned stiletto the thing won't come off neatly.  But why did not the Roman let his chariot wait?\"  \"Aye! why did he let it go away?\"  asked the other staring open-mouthed in the direction where the sound of wheels was still to be heard.  His companion mean while laid his hand to his ear, and listened.  Both were silent for a few minutes, then the thin one said:  \"The chariot has stopped at the first tavern.  So much the better.  The Roman has valuable cattle in his shafts, and at the inn down there, there is a shed for horses.  Here in this hole there is hardly a stall for an ass, and nothing but sour wine and mouldy beer.  I don't like the rubbish, and save my coin for Alexandria and white Mariotic; that is strengthening and purifies the blood.  For the present I only wish we were as well off as those horses; they will have plenty of time to recover their breath.\"  \"Yes, plenty of time,\" answered the other with a broad grin, and then he with his companion withdrew into the room to fill his cup.  Klea too could hear that the chariot which had brought her hither, had halted at the farther tavern, but it did not occur to her that the driver had gone in to treat himself to wine with half of Irene's drachma.  The horses should make up for the lost time, and they could easily do it, for when did the king's banquets ever end before midnight?  As soon as Plea saw that the assassins were filling their earthen cups, she slipped softly on tiptoe behind the tavern; the moon came out from behind the clouds for a few minutes, she sought and found the short way by the desert-path to the Apis-tombs, and hastened rapidly along it.  She looked straight before her, for whenever she glanced at the road-side, and her eye was caught by some dried up shrub of the desert, silvery in the pale moonlight, she fancied she saw behind it the face of a murderer.  The skeletons of fallen beasts standing up out of the dust, and the bleached jawbones of camels and asses, which shone much whiter than the desert-sand on which they lay, seemed to have come to life and motion, and made her think of the tiger-teeth of the bearded ruffian.  The clouds of dust driven in her face by the warm west wind, which had risen higher, increased her alarm, for they were mingled with the colder current of the night-breeze; and again and again she felt as if spirits were driving her onwards with their hot breath, and stroking her face with their cold fingers.  Every thing that her senses perceived was transformed by her heated imagination into a fearful something; but more fearful and more horrible than anything she heard, than any phantom that met her eye in the ghastly moonlight, were her own thoughts of what was to be done now, in the immediate future--of the fearful fate that threatened the Roman and Irene; and she was incapable of separating one from the other in her mind, for one influence alone possessed her, heart and soul: dread, dread; the same boundless, nameless, deadly dread--alike of mortal peril and irremediable shame, and of the airiest phantoms and the merest nothings.  A large black cloud floated slowly across the moon and utter darkness hid everything around, even the undefined forms which her imagination had turned to images of dread.  She was forced to moderate her pace, and find her way, feeling each step; and just as to a child some hideous form that looms before him vanishes into nothingness when he covers his eyes with his hand, so the profound darkness which now enveloped her, suddenly released her soul from a hundred imaginary terrors.  She stood still, drew a deep breath, collected the whole natural force of her will, and asked herself what she could do to avert the horrid issue.  Since seeing the murderers every thought of revenge, every wish to punish the seducer with death, had vanished from her mind; one desire alone possessed her now--that of rescuing him, the man, from the clutches of these ravening beasts.  Walking slowly onwards she repeated to herself every word she had heard that referred to Publius and Irene as spoken by Euergetes, Eulaeus, the recluse, and the assassins, and recalled every step she had taken since she left the temple; thus she brought herself back to the consciousness that she had come out and faced danger and endured terror, solely and exclusively for Irene's sake.  The image of her sister rose clearly before her mind in all its bright charm, undimmed by any jealous grudge which, indeed, ever since her passion had held her in its toils had never for the smallest fraction of a minute possessed her.  Irene had grown up under her eye, sheltered by her care, in the sunshine of her love.  To take care of her, to deny herself, and bear the severest fatigue for her had been her pleasure; and now as she appealed to her father--as she wont to do--as if he were present, and asked him in an inaudible cry: \"Tell me, have I not done all for her that I could do?\" and said to herself that he could not possibly answer her appeal but with assent, her eyes filled with tears; the bitterness and discontent which had lately filled her breast gradually disappeared, and a gentle, calm, refreshing sense of satisfaction came over her spirit, like a cooling breeze after a scorching day.  As she now again stood still, straining her eyes which were growing more accustomed to the darkness, to discover one of the temples at the end of the alley of sphinxes, suddenly and unexpectedly at her right hand a solemn and many-voiced hymn of lamentation fell upon her ear.  This was from the priests of Osiris-Apis who were performing the sacred mysteries of their god, at midnight, on the roof of the temple.  She knew the hymn well--a lament for the deceased Osiris which implored him with urgent supplication to break the power of death, to rise again, to bestow new light and new vitality on the world and on men, and to vouchsafe to all the departed a new existence.  The pious lament had a powerful effect on her excited spirit.  Her parents too perhaps had passed through death, and were now taking part in the conduct of the destiny of the world and of men in union with the life giving God.  Her breath came fast, she threw up her arms, and, for the first time since in her wrath she had turned her back on the holy of holies in the temple of Serapis, she poured forth her whole soul with passionate fervor in a deep and silent prayer for strength to fulfil her duty to the end,--for some sign to show her the way to save Irene from misfortune, and Publius from death.  And as she prayed she felt no longer alone--no, it seemed to her that she stood face to face with the invincible Power which protects the good, in whom she now again had faith, though for Him she knew no name; as a daughter, pursued by foes, might clasp her powerful father's knees and claim his succor.  She had not stood thus with uplifted arms for many minutes when the moon, once more appearing, recalled her to herself and to actuality.  She now perceived close to her, at hardly a hundred paces from where she stood, the line of sphinxes by the side of which lay the tombs of Apis near which she was to await Publius.  Her heart began to beat faster again, and her dread of her own weakness revived.  In a few minutes she must meet the Roman, and, involuntarily putting up her hand to smooth her hair, she was reminded that she still wore Glaucus' hat on her head and his cloak wrapped round her shoulders.  Lifting up her heart again in a brief prayer for a calm and collected mind, she slowly arranged her dress and its folds, and as she did so the key of the tomb-cave, which she still had about her, fell under her hand.  An idea flashed through her brain--she caught at it, and with hurried breath followed it out, till she thought she had now hit upon the right way to preserve from death the man who was so rich and powerful, who had given her nothing but taken everything from her, and to whom, nevertheless, she--the poor water- bearer whom he had thought to trifle with--could now bestow the most precious of the gifts of the immortals, namely, life.  Serapion had said, and she was willing to believe, that Publius was not base, and he certainly was not one of those who could prove ungrateful to a preserver.  She longed to earn the right to demand something of him, and that could be nothing else but that he should give up her sister and bring"]]]
