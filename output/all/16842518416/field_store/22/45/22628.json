I might have had her cheaper!  My companions laughed at me, the auctioneer shrugged his shoulders as he took my money, but I took the child on my arm, helped the woman up, carried her in a boat over the Nile, loaded a stone-cart with my miserable property, and drove her like a block of lime home to the old people.  \"My mother shook her head, and my father looked as if he thought me mad; but neither of them said a word.  They made up a bed for her, and on my spare nights I built that ruined thing hard by--it was a tidy hut once. Soon my mother grew fond of the child.  It was quite small, and we called it Pennu--[Pennu is the name for the mouse in old Egyptian]--because it was so pretty, like a little mouse.  I kept away from the foreign quarter, and saved my wages, and bought a goat, which lived in front of our door when I took the woman to her own hut.  \"She was dumb, but not deaf, only she did not understand our language; but the demon in her eyes spoke for her and understood what I said.  She comprehended everything, and could say everything with her eyes; but best of all she knew how to thank one.  No high-priest who at the great hill festival praises the Gods in long hymns for their gifts can return thanks so earnestly with his lips as she with her dumb eyes.  And when she wished to pray, then it seemed as though the demon in her look was mightier than ever.  \"At first I used to be impatient enough when she leaned so feebly against the wall, or when the child cried and disturbed my sleep; but she had only to look up, and the demon pressed my heart together and persuaded me that the crying was really a song.  Pennu cried more sweetly too than other children, and he had such soft, white, pretty little fingers.  \"One day he had been crying for a long time,  At last I bent down over him, and was going to scold him, but he seized me by the beard.  It was pretty to see!  Afterwards he was for ever wanting to pull me about, and his mother noticed that that pleased me, for when I brought home anything good, an egg or a flower or a cake, she used to hold him up and place his little hands on my beard.  \"Yes, in a few months the woman had learnt to hold him up high in her arms, for with care and quiet she had grown stronger.  White she always remained and delicate, but she grew younger and more beautiful from day to day; she can hardly have numbered twenty years when I bought her. What she was called I never heard; nor did we give her any name.  She was 'the woman,' and so we called her.  \"Eight moons passed by, and then the little Mouse died.  I wept as she did, and as I bent over the little corpse and let my tears have free course, and thought--now he can never lift up his pretty little finger to you again; then I felt for the first time the woman's soft hand on my cheek.  She stroked my rough beard as a child might, and with that looked at me so gratefully that I felt as though king Pharaoh had all at once made me a present of both Upper and Lower Egypt.  \"When the Mouse was buried she got weaker again, but my mother took good care of her.  I lived with her, like a father with his child.  She was always friendly, but if I approached her, and tried to show her any fondness, she would look at me, and the demon in her eyes drove me back, and I let her alone.  \"She grew healthier and stronger and more and more beautiful, so beautiful that I kept her hidden, and was consumed by the longing to make her my wife.  A good housewife she never became, to be sure; her hands were so tender, and she did not even know how to milk the goat.  My mother did that and everything else for her.  \"In the daytime she stayed in her hut and worked, for she was very skillful at woman's work, and wove lace as fine as cobwebs, which my mother sold that she might bring home perfumes with the proceeds.  She was very fond of them, and of flowers too; and Uarda in there takes after her.  \"In the evening, when the folk from the other side had left the City of the Dead, she would often walk down the valley here, thoughtful and often looking up at the moon, which she was especially fond of.  \"One evening in the winter-time I came home.  It was already dark, and I expected to find her in front of the door.  All at once, about a hundred steps behind old Hekt's cave, I heard a troop of jackals barking so furiously that I said to myself directly they had attacked a human being, and I knew too who it was, though no one had told me, and the woman could not call or cry out.  Frantic with terror, I tore a firebrand from the hearth and the stake to which the goat was fastened out of the ground, rushed to her help, drove away the beasts, and carried her back senseless to the hut.  My mother helped me, and we called her back to life.  When we were alone, I wept like a child for joy at her escape, and she let me kiss her, and then she became my wife, three years after I had bought her.  \"She bore me a little maid, that she herself named Uarda; for she showed us a rose, and then pointed to the child, and we understood her without words.  \"Soon afterwards she died.  \"You are a priest, but I tell you that when I am summoned before Osiris, if I am admitted amongst the blessed, I will ask whether I shall meet my wife, and if the doorkeeper says no, he may thrust me back, and I will go down cheerfully to the damned, if I find her again there.\"  \"And did no sign ever betray her origin?\" asked the physician.  The soldier had hidden his face in his hand; he was weeping aloud, and did not hear the question.  But, the paraschites answered:  \"She was the child of some great personage, for in her clothes we found a golden jewel with a precious stone inscribed with strange characters.  It is very costly, and my wife is keeping it for the little one.\"     CHAPTER XVII.  In the earliest glimmer of dawn the following clay, the physician Nebsecht having satisfied himself as to the state of the sick girl, left the paraschites' hut and made his way in deepest thought to the 'Terrace Temple of Hatasu, to find his friend Pentaur and compose the writing which he had promised to the old man.  As the sun arose in radiance he reached the sanctuary.  He expected to hear the morning song of the priests, but all was silent.  He knocked and the porter, still half-asleep, opened the door.  Nebsecht enquired for the chief of the Temple.  \"He died in the night,\" said the man yawning.  \"What do you say?\" cried the physician in sudden terror, \"who is dead?\"  \"Our good old chief, Rui.\"  Nebsecht breathed again, and asked for Pentaur.  \"You belong to the House of Seti,\" said the doorkeeper, \"and you do not know that he is deposed from his office?  The holy fathers have refused to celebrate the birth of Ra with him.  He sings for himself now, alone up on the watch-tower.  There you will find him.\"  Nebsecht strode quickly up the stairs.  Several of the priests placed themselves together in groups as soon as they saw him, and began singing. He paid no heed to them, however, but hastened on to the uppermost terrace, where he found his friend occupied in writing.  Soon he learnt all that had happened, and wrathfully he cried: \"You are too honest for those wise gentlemen in the House of Seti, and too pure and zealous for the rabble here.  I knew it, I knew what would come of it if they introduced you to the mysteries.  For us initiated there remains only the choice between lying and silence.\"  \"The old error!\"  said Pentaur, \"we know that the Godhead is One, we name it, 'The All,' 'The Veil of the All,' or simply 'Ra.'  But under the name Ra we understand something different than is known to the common herd; for to us, the Universe is God, and in each of its parts we recognize a manifestation of that highest being without whom nothing is, in the heights above or in the depths below.\"  \"To me you can say everything, for I also am initiated,\" interrupted Nebsecht.  \"But neither from the laity do I withhold it,\" cried Pentaur, \"only to those who are incapable of understanding the whole, do I show the different parts.  Am I a liar if I do not say, 'I speak,' but 'my mouth speaks,' if I affirm, 'Your eye sees,' when it is you yourself who are the seer.  When the light of the only One manifests itself, then I fervently render thanks to him in hymns, and the most luminous of his forms I name Ra.  When I look upon yonder green fields, I call upon the faithful to give thanks to Rennut, that is, that active manifestation of the One, through which the corn attains to its ripe maturity.  Am I filled with wonder at the bounteous gifts with which that divine stream whose origin is hidden, blesses our land, then I adore the One as the God Hapi, the secret one.  Whether we view the sun, the harvest, or the Nile, whether we contemplate with admiration the unity and harmony of the visible or invisible world, still it is always with the Only, the All- embracing One we have to do, to whom we also ourselves belong as those of his manifestations in which lie places his self-consciousness.  The imagination of the multitude is limited .  .  .  .  .\"  \"And so we lions,       [\"The priests,\" says Clement of Alexandria, \"allow none to be      participators in their mysteries, except kings or such amongst      themselves as are distinguished for virtue or wisdom.\"  The same      thing is shown by the monuments in many places]  give them the morsel that we can devour at one gulp, finely chopped up, and diluted with broth as if for the weak stomach of a sick man.\"  \"Not so; we only feel it our duty to temper and sweeten the sharp potion, which for men even is almost too strong, before we offer it to the children, the babes in spirit.  The sages of old veiled indeed the highest truths in allegorical forms, in symbols, and finally in a beautiful and richly-colored mythos, but they brought them near to the multitude shrouded it is true but still "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5442"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 04 (#4)"],["body","discernible.\"  \"Discernible?\"  said the  physician, \"discernible?  Why then the veil?\"  \"And do you imagine that the multitude could look the naked truth in the face,       [In Sais the statue of Athene (Neith) has the following,      inscription: \"I am the All, the Past, the Present, and the Future,      my veil has no mortal yet lifted.\"  Plutarch, Isis and Osiris 9, a      similar quotation by Proclus, in Plato's Timaeus.]  and not despair?\"  \"Can I, can any one who looks straight forward, and strives to see the truth and nothing but the truth?\"  cried the physician.  \"We both of us know that things only are, to us, such as they picture themselves in the prepared mirror of our souls.  I see grey, grey, and white, white, and have accustomed myself in my yearning after knowledge, not to attribute the smallest part to my own idiosyncrasy, if such indeed there be existing in my empty breast.  You look straight onwards as I do, but in you each idea is transfigured, for in your soul invisible shaping powers are at work, which set the crooked straight, clothe the commonplace with charm, the repulsive with beauty.  You are a poet, an artist; I only seek for truth.\"  \"Only?\"  said Pentaur, \"it is just on account of that effort that I esteem you so highly, and, as you already know, I also desire nothing but the truth.\"  \"I know, I know,\" said the physician nodding, \"but our ways run side by side without ever touching, and our final goal is the reading of a riddle, of which there are many solutions.  You believe yourself to have found the right one, and perhaps none exists.\"  \"Then let us content ourselves with the nearest and the most beautiful,\" said Pentaur.  \"The most beautiful?\"  cried Nebsecht indignantly.  \"Is that monster, whom you call God, beautiful--the giant who for ever regenerates himself that he may devour himself again?  God is the All, you say, who suffices to himself.  Eternal he is and shall be, because all that goes forth from him is absorbed by him again, and the great niggard bestows no grain of sand, no ray of light, no breath of wind, without reclaiming it for his household, which is ruled by no design, no reason, no goodness, but by a tyrannical necessity, whose slave he himself is.  The coward hides behind the cloud of incomprehensibility, and can be revealed only by himself--I would I could strip him of the veil!  Thus I see the thing that you call God!\"  \"A ghastly picture,\" said Pentaur, \"because you forget that we recognize reason to be the essence of the All, the penetrating and moving power of the universe which is manifested in the harmonious working together of its parts, and in ourselves also, since we are formed out of its substance, and inspired with its soul.\"  \"Is the warfare of life in any way reasonable?\"  asked Nebsecht.  \"Is this eternal destruction in order to build up again especially well- designed and wise?  And with this introduction of reason into the All, you provide yourself with a self-devised ruler, who terribly resembles the gracious masters and mistresses that you exhibit to the people.\"  \"Only apparently,\" answered Pentaur, \"only because that which transcends sense is communicable through the medium of the senses alone.  When God manifests himself as the wisdom of the world, we call him 'the Word,' 'He, who covers his limbs with names,' as the sacred Text expresses itself, is the power which gives to things their distinctive forms; the scarabaeus, 'which enters life as its own son' reminds us of the ever self-renewing creative power which causes you to call our merciful and benevolent God a monster, but which you can deny as little as you can the happy choice of the type; for, as you know, there are only male scarabei, and this animal reproduces itself.\"  Nebsecht smiled.  \"If all the doctrines of the mysteries,\" he said, \"have no more truth than this happily chosen image, they are in a bad way.  These beetles have for years been my friends and companions. I know their family life, and I can assure you that there are males and females amongst them as amongst cats, apes, and human beings.  Your 'good God' I do not know, and what I least comprehend in thinking it over quietly is the circumstance that you distinguish a good and evil principle in the world.  If the All is indeed God, if God as the scriptures teach, is goodness, and if besides him is nothing at all, where is a place to be found for evil?\"  \"You talk like a school-boy,\" said Pentaur indignantly.  \"All that is, is good and reasonable in itself, but the infinite One, who prescribes his own laws and his own paths, grants to the finite its continuance through continual renewal, and in the changing forms of the finite progresses for evermore.  What we call evil, darkness, wickedness, is in itself divine, good, reasonable, and clear; but it appears in another light to our clouded minds, because we perceive the way only and not the goal, the details only, and not the whole.  Even so, superficial listeners blame the music, in which a discord is heard, which the harper has only evoked from the strings that his hearers may more deeply feel the purity of the succeeding harmony; even so, a fool blames the painter who has colored his board with black, and does not wait for the completion of the picture which shall be thrown into clearer relief by the dark background; even so, a child chides the noble tree, whose fruit rots, that a new life may spring up from its kernel.  Apparent evil is but an antechamber to higher bliss, as every sunset is but veiled by night, and will soon show itself again as the red dawn of a new day.\"  \"How convincing all that sounds!\"  answered the physician, \"all, even the terrible, wins charm from your lips; but I could invert your proposition, and declare that it is evil that rules the world, and sometimes gives us one drop of sweet content, in order that we may more keenly feel the bitterness of life.  You see harmony and goodness in everything.  I have observed that passion awakens life, that all existence is a conflict, that one being devours another.\"  \"And do you not feel the beauty of visible creation, and does not the immutable law in everything fill you with admiration and humility?\"  \"For beauty,\" replied Nebsecht, \"I have never sought; the organ is somehow wanting in me to understand it of myself, though I willingly allow you to mediate between us.  But of law in nature I fully appreciate the worth, for that is the veritable soul of the universe.  You call the One 'Temt,' that is to say the total--the unity which is reached by the addition of many units; and that pleases me, for the elements of the universe and the powers which prescribe the paths of life are strictly defined by measure and number--but irrespective of beauty or benevolence.\"  \"Such views,\" cried Pentaur troubled, \"are the result of your strange studies.  You kill and destroy, in order, as you yourself say, to come upon the track of the secrets of life.  Look out upon nature, develop the faculty which you declare to be wanting, in you, and the beauty of creation will teach you without my assistance that you are praying to a false god.\"  \"I do not pray,\" said Nebsecht, \"for the law which moves the world is as little affected by prayers as the current of the sands in your hour- glass.  Who tells you that I do not seek to come upon the track of the first beginning of things?  I proved to you just now that I know more about the origin of Scarabei than you do.  I have killed many an animal, not only to study its organism, but also to investigate how it has built up its form.  But precisely in this work my organ for beauty has become blunt rather than keen.  I tell you that the beginning of things is not more attractive to contemplate than their death and decomposition.\"  Pentaur looked at the physician enquiringly.  \"I also for once,\" continued Nebsecht, \"will speak in figures.  Look at this wine, how pure it is, how fragrant; and yet it was trodden from the grape by the brawny feet of the vintagers.  And those full ears of corn! They gleam golden yellow, and will yield us snow-white meal when they are ground, and yet they grew from a rotting seed.  Lately you were praising to me the beauty of the great Hall of Columns nearly completed in the Temple of Amon over yonder in Thebes.       [Begun by Rameses I. continued by Seti I., completed by Rameses II.      The remains of this immense hall, with its 134 columns, have not      their equal in the world.]  How posterity will admire it!  I saw that Hall arise.  There lay masses of freestone in wild confusion, dust in heaps that took away my breath, and three months since I was sent over there, because above a hundred workmen engaged in stone-polishing under the burning sun had been beaten to death.  Were I a poet like you, I would show you a hundred similar pictures, in which you would not find much beauty.  In the meantime, we have enough to do in observing the existing order of things, and investigating the laws by which it is governed.\"  \"I have never clearly understood your efforts, and have difficulty in comprehending why you did not turn to the science of the haruspices,\" said Pentaur.  \"Do you then believe that the changing, and--owing to the conditions by which they are surrounded--the dependent life of plants and animals is governed by law, rule, and numbers like the movement of the stars?\"  \"What a question!  Is the strong and mighty hand, which compels yonder heavenly bodies to roll onward in their carefully-appointed orbits, not delicate enough to prescribe the conditions of the flight of the bird, and the beating of the human heart?\"  \"There we are again with the heart,\" said the poet smiling, \"are you any nearer your aim?\"  The physician became very grave.  \"Perhaps tomorrow even,\" he said, \"I may have what I need.  You have your palette there with red and black color, and a writing reed.  May I use this sheet of papyrus?\"  \"Of course; but first tell me .  "]]]
