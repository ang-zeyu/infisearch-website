The old sorceress Hekt, who has taken charge of the paraschites' wife and grandchild, knows all about it.  Send some policeguards over there, and let her be brought over here as a prisoner; I will examine her myself, and so can question her without exciting observation.\"  Ameni at once sent off a party of soldiers, and then quietly ordered a faithful attendant to light up the so-called audience-chamber, and to put a seat for him in an adjoining room.     CHAPTER XXX.  While the banquet was going forward at the temple, and Ameni's messengers were on their way to the valley of the kings' tombs, to waken up old Hekt, a furious storm of hot wind came up from the southwest, sweeping black clouds across the sky, and brown clouds of dust across the earth. It bowed the slender palm-trees as an archer bends his bow, tore the tentpegs up on the scene of the festival, whirled the light tent-cloths up in the air, drove them like white witches through the dark night, and thrashed the still surface of the Nile till its yellow waters swirled and tossed in waves like a restless sea.  Paaker had compelled his trembling slaves to row him across the stream; several times the boat was near being swamped, but he had seized the helm himself with his uninjured hand, and guided it firmly and surely, though the rocking of the boat kept his broken hand in great and constant pain. After a few ineffectual attempts he succeeded in landing.  The storm had blown out the lanterns at the masts--the signal lights for which his people looked--and he found neither servants nor torch-bearers on the bank, so he struggled through the scorching wind as far as the gate of his house.  His big dog had always been wont to announce his return home to the door-keeper with joyful barking; but to-night the boatmen long knocked in vain at the heavy doer.  When at last he entered the court- yard, he found all dark, for the wind had extinguished the lanterns and torches, and there were no lights but in the windows of his mother's rooms.  The dogs in their open kennels now began to make themselves heard, but their tones were plaintive and whining, for the storm had frightened the beasts; their howling cut the pioneer to the heart, for it reminded him of the poor slain Descher, whose deep voice he sadly missed; and when he went into his own room he was met by a wild cry of lamentation from the Ethiopian slave, for the dog which he had trained for Paaker's father, and which he had loved.  The pioneer threw himself on a seat, and ordered some water to be brought, that he might cool his aching hand in it, according to the prescription of Nebsecht.  As soon as the old man saw the broken fingers, he gave another yell of woe, and when Paaker ordered him to cease he asked:  \"And is the man still alive who did that, and who killed Descher?\"  Paaker nodded, and while he held his hand in the cooling water he looked sullenly at the ground.  He felt miserable, and he asked himself why the storm had not swamped the boat, and the Nile had not swallowed him. Bitterness and rage filled his breast, and he wished he were a child, and might cry.  But his mood soon changed, his breath came quickly, his breast heaved, and an ominous light glowed in his eyes.  He was not thinking of his love, but of the revenge that was even dearer to him.  \"That brood of Rameses!\"  he muttered.  \"I will sweep them all away together--the king, and Mena, and those haughty princes, and many more-- I know how.  Only wait, only wait!\"  and he flung up his right fist with a threatening gesture.  The door opened at this instant, and his mother entered the room; the raging of the storm had drowned the sound of her steps, and as she approached her revengeful son, she called his name in horror at the mad wrath which was depicted in his countenance.  Paaker started, and then said with apparent composure:  \"Is it you, mother?  It is near morning, and it is better to be asleep than awake in such an hour.\"  \"I could not rest in my rooms,\" answered Setchem.  \"The storm howled so wildly, and I am so anxious, so frightfully unhappy--as I was before your father died.\"  Then stay with me,\" said Paaker affectionately, and lie down on my couch.\"  \"I did not come here to sleep,\" replied Setchem.  \"I am too unhappy at all that happened to you on the larding-steps, it is frightful!  No, no, my son, it is not about your smashed hand, though it grieves me to see you in pain; it is about the king, and his anger when he hears of the quarrel.  He favors you less than he did your lost father, I know it well.  But how wildly you smile, how wild you looked when I carne in! It went through my bones and marrow.\"  Both were silent for a time, and listened to the furious raging of the storm.  At last Setchem spoke.  \"There is something else,\" she said, \"which disturbs my mind.  I cannot forget the poet who spoke at the festival to-day, young Pentaur.  His figure, his face, his movements, nay his very voice, are exactly like those of your father at the time when he was young, and courted me.  It is as if the Gods were fain to see the best man that they ever took to themselves, walk before them a second time upon earth.\"  \"Yes, my lady,\" said the black slave; \"no mortal eye ever saw such a likeness.  I saw him fighting in front of the paraschites' cottage, and he was more like my dead master than ever.  He swung the tent-post over his head, as my lord used to swing his battle-axe.\"  \"Be silent,\"  cried  Paaker, \"and  get out-idiot!  The priest is like my father; I grant it, mother; but he is an insolent fellow, who offended me grossly, and with whom I have to reckon--as with many others.\"  \"How violent you are!\"  interrupted his mother, \"and how full of bitterness and hatred.  Your father was so sweet-tempered, and kind to everybody.\"  \"Perhaps they are kind to me?\"  retorted Paaker with a short laugh. \"Even the Immortals spite me, and throw thorns in my path.  But I will push them aside with my own hand, and will attain what I desire without the help of the Gods and overthrow all that oppose me.\"  \"We cannot blow away a feather without the help of the Immortals,\" answered Setchem.  \"So your father used to say, who was a very different man both in body and mind from you!  I tremble before you this evening, and at the curses you have uttered against the children of your lord and sovereign, your father's best friend.\"  \"But my enemy,\" shouted Paaker.  \"You will get nothing from me but curses.  And the brood of Rameses shall learn whether your husband's son will let himself be ill-used and scorned without revenging him self. I will fling them into an abyss, and I will laugh when I see them writhing in the sand at my feet!\"  \"Fool!\"  cried Setchem, beside herself.  \"I am but a woman, and have often blamed myself for being soft and weak; but as sure as I am faithful to your dead father--who you are no more like than a bramble is like a palm-tree--so surely will I tear my love for you out of my heart if you --if you--Now I see! now I know!  Answer me-murderer!  Where are the seven arrows with the wicked words which used to hang here?  Where are the arrows  on which you had scrawled 'Death to Mena?'\"  With these words Setchem breathlessly started forward, but the pioneer drew back as she confronted him, as in his youthful days when she threatened to punish him for some misdemeanor.  She followed him up, caught him by the girdle, and in a hoarse voice repeated her question. He stood still, snatched her hand angrily from his belt, and said defiantly:  \"I have put them in my quiver--and not for mere play.  Now you know.\"  Incapable of words, the maddened woman once more raised her hand against her degenerate son, but he put back her arm.  \"I am no longer a child,\" he said, \"and I am master of this house.  I will do what I will, if a hundred women hindered me!\"  and with these words he pointed to the door.  Setchem broke into loud sobs, and turned her back upon him; but at the door once more she turned to look at him. He had seated himself, and was resting his forehead on the table on which the bowl of cold water stood.  Setchem fought a hard battle.  At last once more through her choking tears she called his name, opened her arms wide and exclaimed:  \"Here I am--here I am!  Come to my heart, only give up these hideous thoughts of revenge.\"  But Paaker did not move, he did not look up at her, he did not speak, he only shook his head in negation.  Setchem's hands fell, and she said softly:  \"What did your father teach you out of the scriptures?  'Your highest praise consists in this, to reward your mother for what she has done for you, in bringing you up, so that she may not raise her hands to God, nor He hear her lamentation.'\"  At these words, Paaker sobbed aloud, but he did not look at his mother. She called him tenderly by his name; then her eyes fell on his quiver, which lay on a bench with other arms.  Her heart shrunk within her, and with a trembling voice she exclaimed:  \"I forbid this mad vengeance--do you hear?  Will you give it up?  You do not move?  No!  you will not!  Ye Gods, what can I do?\"  She wrung her hands in despair; then she hastily crossed the room, snatched out one of the arrows, and strove to break it.  Paaker sprang from his seat, and wrenched the weapon from her hand; the sharp point slightly scratched the skin, and dark drops of blood flowed from it, and dropped upon the floor.  The Mohar would have taken the wounded hand, for Setchem, who had the weakness of never being able to see blood flow--neither her own nor anybody's else--had turned as pale as death; but she pushed him from her, and as she spoke her gentle voice had a dull estranged tone.  \"This hand,\" she said--\"a mother's hand wounded by her son--shall never again grasp yours till you have sworn a solemn oath to put away from you all thoughts of revenge and murder, and not to disgrace your father's name."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5445"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 07 (#4)"],["body","  I have said it, and may his glorified spirit be my witness, and give me strength to keep my word!\"  Paaker had fallen on his knees, and was engaged in a terrible mental struggle, while his mother slowly went towards the door.  There again she stood still for a moment; she did not speak, but her eyes appealed to him once more.  In vain.  At last she left the room, and the wind slammed the door violently behind her.  Paaker groaned, and pressed his hand over his eyes.  \"Mother, mother!\"  he cried.  \"I cannot go back--I cannot.\"  A fearful gust of wind howled round the house, and drowned his voice, and then he heard two tremendous claps, as if rocks had been hurled from heaven.  He started up and went to the window, where the melancholy grey dawn was showing, in order to call the slaves.  Soon they came trooping out, and the steward called out as soon as he saw him:  \"The storm has blown down the masts at the great gate!\"  \"Impossible!\"  cried Paaker.  \"Yes, indeed!\"  answered the servant.  \"They have been sawn through close to the ground.  The matmaker no doubt did it, whose collar-bone was broken.  He has escaped in this fearful night.\"  \"Let out the dogs,\" cried the Mohar.  \"All who have legs run after the blackguard!  Freedom, and five handfuls of gold for the man who brings him back.\"  The guests at the House of Seti had already gone to rest, when Ameni was informed of the arrival of the sorceress, and he at once went into the hall, where Ani was waiting to see her; the Regent roused himself from a deep reverie when he heard the high-priest's steps.  \"Is she come?\"  he asked hastily; when Ameni answered in the affirmative Ani went on meanwhile carefully disentangling the disordered curls of his wig, and arranging his broad, collar-shaped necklace:  \"The witch may exercise some influence over me; will you not give me your blessing to preserve me from her spells?  It is true, I have on me this Houss'-eye, and this Isis-charm, but one never knows.\"  \"My presence will be your safe-guard,\" said Ameni.  \"But-no, of course you wish to speak with her alone.  You shall be conducted to a room, which is protected against all witchcraft by sacred texts.  My brother,\" he continued to one of the serving-priests, \"let the witch be taken into one of the consecrated rooms, and then, when you have sprinkled the threshold, lead my lord Ani thither.\"  The high-priest went away, and into a small room which adjoined the hall where the interview between the Regent and the old woman was about to take place, and where the softest whisper spoken in the larger room could be heard by means of an ingeniously contrived and invisible tube.  When Ani saw the old woman, he started back is horror; her appearance at this moment was, in fact, frightful.  The storm had tossed and torn her garment and tumbled all her thick, white hair, so that locks of it fell over her face.  She leaned on a staff, and bending far forward looked steadily at the Regent; and her eyes, red and smarting from the sand which the wind had flung in her face, seemed to glow as she fixed them on his.  She looked as a hyaena might when creeping to seize its prey, and Ani felt a cold shiver and he heard her hoarse voice addressing him to greet him and to represent that he had chosen a strange hour for requiring her to speak with him.  When she had thanked him for his promise of renewing her letter of freedom, and had confirmed the statement that Paaker had had a love- philter from her, she parted her hair from off her face--it occurred to her that she was a woman.  The Regent sat in an arm-chair, she stood before him; but the struggle with the storm had tired her old limbs, and she begged Ani to permit her to be seated, as she had a long story to tell, which would put Paaker into his power, so that he would find him as yielding as wax.  The Regent signed her to a corner of the room, and she squatted down on the pavement.  When he desired her to proceed with her story, she looked at the floor for some time in silence, and then began, as if half to herself:  \"I will tell thee, that I may find peace--I do not want, when I die, to be buried unembalmed.  Who knows but perhaps strange things may happen in the other world, and I would not wish to miss them.  I want to see him again down there, even if it were in the seventh limbo of the damned. Listen to me!  But, before I speak, promise me that whatever I tell thee, thou wilt leave me in peace, and will see that I am embalmed when I am dead.  Else I will not speak.\"  Ani bowed consent.  \"No-no,\" she said.  \"I will tell thee what to swear 'If I do not keep my word to Hekt--who gives the Mohar into my power--may the Spirits whom she rules, annihilate me before I mount the throne.'  Do not be vexed, my lord--and say only 'Yes.'  What I can tell, is worth more than a mere word.\"  \"Well then--yes!\"  cried the Regent, eager for the mighty revelation.  The old woman muttered a few unintelligible words; then she collected herself, stretched out her lean neck, and asked, as she fixed her sparkling eyes on the man before her:  \"Did'st thou ever, when thou wert young, hear of the singer Beki?  Well, look at me, I am she.\"  She laughed loud and hoarsely, and drew her tattered robe across her bosom, as if half ashamed of her unpleasing person.  \"Ay!\"  she continued.  \"Men find pleasure in grapes by treading them down, and when the must is drunk the skins are thrown on the dung-hill. Grape-skins, that is what I am--but you need not look at me so pitifully; I was grapes once, and poor and despised as I am now, no one can take from me what I have had and have been.  Mine has been a life out of a thousand, a complete life, full to overflowing of joy and suffering, of love and hate, of delight, despair, and revenge.  Only to talk of it raises me to a seat by thy throne there.  No, let me be, I am used now to squatting on the ground; but I knew thou wouldst hear me to the end, for once I too was one of you.  Extremes meet in all things--I know it by experience.  The greatest men will hold out a hand to a beautiful woman, and time was when I could lead you all as with a rope.  Shall I begin at the beginning?  Well--I seldom am in the mood for it now-a-days.  Fifty years ago I sang a song with this voice of mine; an old crow like me? sing!  But so it was.  My father was a man of rank, the governor of Abydos; when the first Rameses took possession of the throne my father was faithful to the house of thy fathers, so the new king sent us all to the gold mines, and there they all died--my parents, brothers, and sisters.  I only survived by some miracle.  As I was handsome and sang well, a music master took me into his band, brought me to Thebes, and wherever there was a feast given in any great house, Beki was in request. Of flowers and money and tender looks I had a plentiful harvest; but I was proud and cold, and the misery of my people had made me bitter at an age when usually even bad liquor tastes of honey.  Not one of all the gay young fellows, princes' sons, and nobles, dared to touch my hand.  But my hour was to come; the handsomest and noblest man of them all, and grave and dignified too--was Assa, the old Mohar's father, and grandfather of Pentaur--no, I should say of Paaker, the pioneer; thou hast known him. Well, wherever I sang, he sat opposite me, and gazed at me, and I could not take my eyes off him, and--thou canst tell the rest! no!  Well, no woman before or after me can ever love a man as I loved Assa.  Why dost thou not laugh?  It must seem odd, too, to hear such a thing from the toothless mouth of an old witch.  He is dead, long since dead.  I hate him!  and yet--wild as it sounds--I believe I love him yet.  And he loved me--for two years; then he went to the war with Seti, and remained a long time away, and when I saw him again he had courted the daughter of some rich and noble house.  I was handsome enough still, but he never looked at me at the banquets.  I came across him at least twenty times, but he avoided me as if I were tainted with leprosy, and I began to fret, and fell ill of a fever.  The doctors said it was all over with me, so I sent him a letter in which there was nothing but these words: 'Beki is dying, and would like to see Assa once more,' and in the papyrus I put his first present--a plain ring.  And what was the answer?  a handful of gold! Gold--gold!  Thou may'st believe me, when I say that the sight of it was more torturing to my eyes than the iron with which they put out the eyes of criminals.  Even now, when I think of it--But what do you men, you lords of rank and wealth, know of a breaking heart?  When two or three of you happen to meet, and if thou should'st tell the story, the most respectable will say in a pompous voice: 'The man acted nobly indeed; he was married, and his wife would have complained with justice if he had gone to see the singer.'  Am I right or wrong?  I know; not one will remember that the other was a woman, a feeling human being; it will occur to no one that his deed on the one hand saved an hour of discomfort, and on the other wrought half a century of despair.  Assa escaped his wife's scolding, but a thousand curses have fallen on him and on his house.  How virtuous he felt himself when he had crushed and poisoned a passionate heart that had never ceased to love him!  Ay, and he would have come if he had not still felt some love for me, if he had not misdoubted himself, and feared that the dying woman might once more light up the fire he had so carefully smothered and crushed out.  I would have grieved for him-- but that he should send me money, money!--that I have never forgiven; that he shall atone for in his grandchild.\"  The old woman spoke the last words as if in a dream, and without seeming to remember her hearer.  Ani shuddered, as if he were in the presence of a mad woman, and he involuntarily drew his chair back a little way.  The witch observed this; she took breath and"]]]
