I have often been told that he and I resemble each other--in many points, say the more sincere; in every point, say the more polite of my friends.\"  At these words Publius measured with his eye the frame of the royal young libertine, enveloped in transparent robes; and recalling to himself, as he gazed, a glorious statue of that favorite of the Athenians, which he had seen in the Ilissus, an ironical smile passed over his lips.  It was not unobserved by Euergetes and it offended him, for there was nothing he liked better than to be compared to the nephew of Pericles; but he suppressed his annoyance, for Publius Cornelius Scipio was the nearest relative of the most influential men of Rome, and, though he himself wielded royal power, Rome exercised over him the sovereign will of a divinity.  Cleopatra noticed what was passing in her brother's mind, and in order to interrupt his further speech and to divert his mind to fresh thoughts, she said cheerfully:  \"Let us then give up the procession, and think of some other mode of celebrating your birthday.  You, Lysias, must be experienced in such matters, for Publius tells me that you were the leader in all the games of Corinth.  What can we devise to entertain Euergetes and ourselves?\"  The Corinthian looked for a moment into his cup, moving it slowly about on the marble slab of the little table at his side, between an oyster pasty and a dish of fresh asparagus; and then he said, glancing round to win the suffrages of the company:  \"At the great procession which took place under Ptolemy Philadelphus-- Agatharchides gave me the description of it, written by the eye-witness Kallixenus, to read only yesterday--all kinds of scenes from the lives of the gods were represented before the people.  Suppose we were to remain in this magnificent palace, and to represent ourselves the beautiful groups which the great artists of the past have produced in painting or sculpture; but let us choose those only that are least known.\"  \"Splendid,\" cried Cleopatra in great excitement, who can be more like Heracles than my mighty brother there--the very son of Alcmene, as Lysippus has conceived and represented him?  Let us then represent the life of Heracles from grand models, and in every case assign to Euergetes the part of the hero.\"  \"Oh! I will undertake it,\" said the young king, feeling the mighty muscles of his breast and arms, \"and you may give me great credit for assuming the part, for the demi-god who strangled the snakes was lacking in the most important point, and it was not without due consideration that Lysippus represented him with a small head on his mighty body; but I shall not have to say anything.\"  \"If I play Omphale will you sit at my feet?\"  asked Cleopatra.  \"Who would not be willing to sit at those feet?\"  answered Euergetes. \"Let us at once make further choice among the abundance of subjects offered to us, but, like Lysias, I would warn you against those that are too well-known.\"  \"There are no doubt things commonplace to the eye as well as to the ear,\" said Cleopatra.  \"But what is recognized as good is commonly regarded as most beautiful.\"  \"Permit me,\" said Lysias, \"to direct your attention to a piece of sculpture in marble of the noblest workmanship, which is both old and beautiful, and yet which may be known to few among you.  It exists on the cistern of my father's house at Corinth, and was executed many centuries since by a great artist of the Peloponnesus.  Publius was delighted with the work, and it is in fact beautiful beyond description.  It is an exquisite representation of the marriage of Heracles and Hebe--of the hero, raised to divinity, with sempiternal youth.  Will Your Majesty allow yourself to be led by Pallas Athene and your mother Alcmene to your nuptials with Hebe?\"  \"Why not?\"  said Euergetes.  \"Only the Hebe must be beautiful.  But one thing must be considered; how are we to get the cistern from your father's house at Corinth to this place by to-morrow or next day?  Such a group cannot be posed from memory without the original to guide us; and though the story runs that the statue of Serapis flew from Sinope to Alexandria, and though there are magicians still at Memphis--\"  \"We shall not need them,\" interrupted Publius, \"while I was staying as a guest in the house of my friend's parents--which is altogether more magnificent than the old castle of King Gyges at Sardis--I had some gems engraved after this lovely group, as a wedding-present for my sister. They are extremely successful, and I have them with me in my tent.\"  \"Have you a sister?\"  asked the queen, leaning over towards the Roman. \"You must tell me all about her.\"  \"She is a girl like all other girls,\" replied Publius, looking down at the ground, for it was most repugnant to his feelings to speak of his sister in the presence of Euergetes.  \"And you are unjust like all other brothers,\" said Cleopatra smiling, \"and I must hear more about her, for\"--and she whispered the words and looked meaningly at Publius--\"all that concerns you must interest me.\"  During this dialogue the royal brothers had addressed themselves to Lysias with questions as to the marriage of Heracles and Hebe, and all the company were attentive to the Greek as he went on: \"This fine work does not represent the marriage properly speaking, but the moment when the bridegroom is led to the bride.  The hero, with his club on his shoulder, and wearing the lion's skin, is led by Pallas Athene, who, in performing this office of peace, has dropped her spear and carries her helmet in her hand; they are accompanied by his mother Alcmene, and are advancing towards the bride's train.  This is headed by no less a personage than Apollo himself, singing the praises of Hymenaeus to a lute.  With him walks his sister Artemis and behind them the mother of Hebe, accompanied by Hermes, the messenger of the gods, as the envoy of Zeus.  Then follows the principal group, which is one of the most lovely works of Greek art that I am acquainted with.  Hebe comes forward to meet her bridegroom, gently led on by Aphrodite, the queen of love.  Peitho, the goddess of persuasion, lays her hand on the bride's arm, imperceptibly urging her forward and turning away her face; for what she had to say has been said, and she smiles to herself, for Hebe has not turned a deaf ear to her voice, and he who has once listened to Peitho must do what she desires.\"  \"And Hebe?\"  asked Cleopatra.  \"She casts down her eyes, but lifts up the arm on which the hand of Peitho rests with a warning movement of her fingers, in which she holds an unopened rose, as though she would say; 'Ah! let me be--I tremble at the man'--or ask: 'Would it not be better that I should remain as I am and not yield to your temptations and to Aphrodite's power?'  Oh! Hebe is exquisite, and you, O Queen!  must represent her!\"  \"I!\"  exclaimed Cleopatra.  \"But you said her eyes were cast down.\"  \"That is from modesty and timidity, and her gait must also be bashful and maidenly.  Her long robe falls to her feet in simple folds, while Peitho holds hers up saucily, between her forefinger and thumb, as if stealthily dancing with triumph over her recent victory.  Indeed the figure of Peitho would become you admirably.\"  \"I think I will represent Peitho,\" said the queen interrupting the Corinthian.  \"Hebe is but a bud, an unopened blossom, while I am a mother, and I flatter myself I am something of a philosopher--\"  \"And can with justice assure yourself,\" interrupted Aristarchus, \"that with every charm of youth you also possess the characters attributed to Peitho, the goddess, who can work her spells not only on the heart but on the intellect also.  The maiden bud is as sweet to look upon as the rose, but he who loves not merely color but perfume too--I mean refreshment, emotion and edification of spirit--must turn to the full-blown flower; as the rose--growers of lake Moeris twine only the buds of their favorite flower into wreaths and bunches, but cannot use them for extracting the oil of imperishable fragrance; for that they need the expanded blossom. Represent Peitho, my Queen! the goddess herself might be proud of such a representative.\"  \"And if she were so indeed,\" cried Cleopatra, \"how happy am I to hear such words from the lips of Aristarchus.  It is settled--I play Peitho. My companion Zoe may take the part of Artemis, and her grave sister that of Pallas Athene.  For the mother's part we have several matrons to choose from; the eldest daughter of Epitropes appears to me fitted for the part of Aphrodite; she is wonderfully lovely.\"  \"Is she stupid too?\"  asked Euergetes.  \"That is also an attribute of the ever-smiling Cypria.\"  \"Enough so, I think, for our purpose,\" laughed Cleopatra.  \"But where are we to find such a Hebe as you have described, Lysias?  The daughter of Alimes the Arabarch is a charming child.\"  \"But she is brown, as brown as this excellent wine, and too thoroughly Egyptian,\" said the high-steward, who superintended the young Macedonian cup-bearers; he bowed deeply as he spoke, and modestly drew the queen's attention to his own daughter, a maiden of sixteen.  But Cleopatra objected, that she was much taller than herself, and that she would have to stand by the Hebe, and lay her hand on her arm.  Other maidens were rejected on various grounds, and Euergetes had already proposed to send off a carrier-pigeon to Alexandria to command that some fair Greek girl should be sent by an express quadriga to Memphis--where the dark Egyptian gods and men flourish, and are more numerous than the fair race of Greeks--when Lysias exclaimed:  \"I saw to-day the very girl we want, a Hebe that might have stepped out from the marble group at my father's, and have been endued with life and warmth and color by some god.  Young, modest, rose and white, and just about as tall as Your Majesty.  If you will allow me, I will not tell"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5462"],["title","The Sisters â€” Volume 2 (#6)"],["body"," who she is, till after I have been to our tent to fetch the gems with the copies of the marble.\"  \"You will find them in an ivory casket at the bottom of my clothes- chest,\" said Publius; \"here is the key.\"  \"Make haste,\" cried the queen, \"for we are all curious to hear where in Memphis you discovered your modest, rose and white Hebe.\"     CHAPTER X.  An hour had slipped by with the royal party, since Lysias had quitted the company; the wine-cups had been filled and emptied many times; Eulaeus had rejoined the feasters, and the conversation had taken quite another turn, since the whole of the company were not now equally interested in the same subject; on the contrary, the two kings were discussing with Aristarchus the manuscripts of former poets and of the works of the sages, scattered throughout Greece, and the ways and means of obtaining them or of acquiring exact transcripts of them for the library of the Museum.  Hierax was telling Eulaeus of the last Dionysiac festival, and of the representation of the newest comedy in Alexandria, and Eulaeus assumed the appearance--not unsuccessfully--of listening with both ears, interrupting him several times with intelligent questions, bearing directly on what he had said, while in fact his attention was exclusively directed to the queen, who had taken entire possession of the Roman Publius, telling him in a low tone of her life--which was consuming her strength--of her unsatisfied affections, and her enthusiasm for Rome and for manly vigor.  As she spoke her cheeks glowed and her eyes sparkled, for the more exclusively she kept the conversation in her own hands the better she thought she was being entertained; and Publius, who was nothing less than talkative, seldom interrupted her, only insinuating a flattering word now and then when it seemed appropriate; for he remembered the advice given him by the anchorite, and was desirous of winning the good graces of Cleopatra.  In spite of his sharp ears Eulaeus could understand but little of their whispered discourse, for King Euergetes' powerful voice sounded loud above the rest of the conversation; but Eulaeus was able swiftly to supply the links between the disjointed sentences, and to grasp the general sense, at any rate, of what she was saying.  The queen avoided wine, but she had the power of intoxicating herself, so to speak, with her own words, and now just as her brothers and Aristarchus were at the height of their excited and eager question and answer--she raised her cup, touched it with her lips and handed it to Publius, while at the same time she took hold of his.  The young Roman knew well enough all the significance of this hasty action; it was thus that in his own country a woman when in love was wont to exchange her cup with her lover, or an apple already bitten by her white teeth.  Publius was seized with a cold shudder--like a wanderer who carelessly pursues his way gazing up at the moon and stars, and suddenly perceives an abyss yawning; at his feet.  Recollections of his mother and of her warnings against the seductive wiles of the Egyptian women, and particularly of this very woman, flashed through his mind like lightning; she was looking at him--not royally by any means, but with anxious and languishing gaze, and he would gladly have kept his eyes fixed on the ground, and have left the cup untouched; but her eye held his fast as though fettering it with ties and bonds; and to put aside the cup seemed to the most fearless son of an unconquered nation a deed too bold to be attempted.  Besides, how could he possibly repay this highest favor with an affront that no woman could ever forgive--least of all a Cleopatra?  Aye, many a life's happiness is tossed away and many a sin committed, because the favor of women is a grace that does honor to every man, and that flatters him even when it is bestowed by the unloved and unworthy. For flattery is a key to the heart, and when the heart stands half open the voice of the tempter is never wanting to whisper: \"You will hurt her feelings if you refuse.\"  These were the deliberations which passed rapidly and confusedly through the young Roman's agitated brain, as he took the queen's cup and set his lips to the same spot that hers had touched.  Then, while he emptied the cup in long draughts, he felt suddenly seized by a deep aversion to the over-talkative, overdressed and capricious woman before him, who thus forced upon him favors for which he had not sued; and suddenly there rose before his soul the image, almost tangibly distinct, of the humble water- bearer; he saw Klea standing before him and looking far more queenly as, proud and repellent, she avoided his gaze, than the sovereign by his side could ever have done, though crowned with a diadem.  Cleopatra rejoiced to mark his long slow draught, for she thought the Roman meant to imply by it that he could not cease to esteem himself happy in the favor she had shown him.  She did not take her eyes off him, and observed with pleasure that his color changed to red and white; nor did she notice that Eulaeus was watching, with a twinkle in his eyes, all that was going on between her and Publius.  At last the Roman set down the cup, and tried with some confusion to reply to her question as to how he had liked the flavor of the wine.  \"Very fine--excellent--\" at last he stammered out, but he was no longer looking at Cleopatra but at Euergetes, who just then cried out loudly:  \"I have thought over that passage for hours, I have given you all my reasons and have let you speak, Aristarchus, but I maintain my opinion, and whoever denies it does Homer an injustice; in this place 'siu' must be read instead of 'iu'.\"  Euergetes spoke so vehemently that his voice outshouted all the other guests; Publius however snatched at his words, to escape the necessity for feigning sentiments he could not feel; so he said, addressing himself half to the speaker and half to Cleopatra:  \"Of what use can it be to decide whether it is one or the other--'iu' or 'siu'.  I find many things justifiable in other men that are foreign to my own nature, but I never could understand how an energetic and vigorous man, a prudent sovereign and stalwart drinker--like you, Euergetes--can sit for hours over flimsy papyrus-rolls, and rack his brains to decide whether this or that in Homer should be read in one way or another.\"  \"You exercise yourself in other things,\" replied Euergetes.  \"I consider that part of me which lies within this golden fillet as the best that I have, and I exercise my wits on the minutest and subtlest questions just as I would try the strength of my arms against the sturdiest athletes. I flung five into the sand the last time I did so, and they quake now when they see me enter the gymnasium of Timagetes.  There would be no strength in the world if there were no obstacles, and no man would know that he was strong if he could meet with no resistance to overcome.  I for my part seek such exercises as suit my idiosyncrasy, and if they are not to your taste I cannot help it.  If you were to set these excellently dressed crayfish before a fine horse he would disdain them, and could not understand how foolish men could find anything palatable that tasted so salt.  Salt, in fact, is not suited to all creatures!  Men born far from the sea do not relish oysters, while I, being a gourmand, even prefer to open them myself so that they may be perfectly fresh, and mix their liquor with my wine.\"  \"I do not like any very salt dish, and am glad to leave the opening of all marine produce to my servants,\" answered Publius.  \"Thereby I save both time and unnecessary trouble.\"  \"Oh! I know!\"  cried Euergetes.  \"You keep Greek slaves, who must even read and write for you.  Pray is there a market where I may purchase men, who, after a night of carousing, will bear our headache for us?  By the shores of the Tiber you love many things better than learning.\"  \"And thereby,\" added Aristarchus, \"deprive yourselves of the noblest and subtlest of pleasures, for the purest enjoyment is ever that which we earn at the cost of some pains and effort.\"  \"But all that you earn by this kind of labor,\" returned Publius, \"is petty and unimportant.  It puts me in mind of a man who removes a block of stone in the sweat of his brow only to lay it on a sparrow's feather in order that it may not be carried away by the wind.\"  \"And what is great--and what is small?\"  asked Aristarchus.  \"Very opposite opinions on that subject may be equally true, since it depends solely on us and our feelings how things appear to us--whether cold or warm; lovely or repulsive--and when Protagoras says that 'man is the measure of all things,' that is the most acceptable of all the maxims of the Sophists; moreover the smallest matter--as you will fully appreciate --acquires an importance all the greater in proportion as the thing is perfect, of which it forms a part.  If you slit the ear of a cart-horse, what does it signify?  but suppose the same thing were to happen to a thoroughbred horse, a charger that you ride on to battle!  \"A wrinkle or a tooth more or less in the face of a peasant woman matters little, or not at all, but it is quite different in a celebrated beauty. If you scrawl all over the face with which the coarse finger of the potter has decorated a water-jar, the injury to the wretched pot is but small, but if you scratch, only with a needle's point, that gem with the portraits of Ptolemy and Arsinoe, which clasps Cleopatra's robe round her fair throat, the richest queen will grieve as though she had suffered some serious loss.  \"Now, what is there more perfect or more worthy to be treasured than the noblest works of great thinkers and great poets.  \"To preserve them from injury, to purge them from the errors which, in the course of time, may have spotted their immaculate purity, this is our task; and if we do indeed raise blocks of stone it is not to weight a sparrow's feather "]]]
