But Dion's ears were keen, and he fancied he heard subdued voices on the other side of the dwelling.  He followed the sound without delay and, when he turned the corner of the building, stopped short in astonishment, exclaiming as a low cry rose close before him:  \"Good-evening, Gorgias!  I'll see you later.  I won't interrupt you.\"  A few rapid steps took him back to Barine, and as he whispered, \"I saw Helena out in the moonlight, soothing her longing for her grandparents in Gorgias's arms,\" she clapped her hands and said, smiling:  \"That's the way one loses good manners in this solitude.  To disturb the first meeting of a pair of lovers!  But Gorgias treated us in the same way in Alexandria, so he is now paid in his own coin.\"  The architect soon entered the room, with Helena leaning on his arm. Hour by hour he had missed her more and more painfully, and on the eighth day found it impossible to endure life's burden longer without her.  He now protested that he could approach her mother and grandparents as a suitor with a clear conscience; for on the third day after Helena's departure the relation between him and the Queen had changed.  In Cleopatra's presence the image of the granddaughter of Didymus became even more vivid than that of the peerless sovereign had formerly been in Helena's.  Outside of the pages of poetry he had never experienced longing like that which had tortured him during the past few days.     CHAPTER XXI.  This time the architect could spend only a few hours on the Serpent Island, for affairs in the city were beginning to wear a very serious aspect, and the building of the monument was pushed forward even during the night.  The interior of the first story was nearly completed and the rough portion of the second was progressing.  The mosaic workers, who were making the floor of the great hall, had surpassed themselves. It was impossible to wait longer for the sculptures which were to adorn the walls.  At present slabs of polished black marble were to occupy the places intended for bronze reliefs; the utmost haste was necessary.  Octavianus had already reached Pelusium; even if Seleukus, the commander of the garrison, held the strong fortress a long time, a part of the hostile army might appear before Alexandria the following week.  A considerable force, however, was ready to meet him.  The fleet seemed equal to that of the enemy; the horsemen whom Antony had led before the Queen would delight the eye of any one versed in military affairs; and the Imperator hoped much from the veterans who had served under him in former times, learned to know his generosity and open hand in the hour of prosperity, and probably had scarcely forgotten the eventful days when he had cheerfully and gaily shared their perils and privations.  Helena remained on the cliff, and her longing for the old couple had materially diminished.  Her hands moved nimbly, and her cheerful glance showed that the lonely life on the island was beginning to unfold its charms to her.  The young husband, however, had grown very uneasy.  He concealed it before the women, but old Pyrrhus often had much difficulty in preventing his making a trip to the city which might imperil, on the eve of the final decision, the result of their long endurance and privation.  Dion had often wished to set sail with his wife for a great city in Syria or Greece, but fresh and mighty obstacles had deterred him.  A special danger lay in the fact that every large vessel was thoroughly searched before it left the harbour, and it was impossible to escape from it without passing through the narrow straits east of the Pharos or the opening in the Heptastadium, both of which were easily guarded.  The calm moderation that usually distinguished the young counsellor had been transformed into feverish restlessness, and the heart of his faithful old monitor had also lost its poise; for an encounter between the fleet in which his sons served and that of Octavianus was speedily expected.  One day he returned from the city greatly excited.  Pelusium was said to have fallen.  When he ascended the cliff he found everything quiet.  No one, not even Dione, came to meet him.  What had happened here?  Had the fugitives been discovered and dragged with his family to the city to be thrown into prison, perhaps sent to the stone quarries?  Deadly pale, but erect and composed, he walked towards the house.  He owed to Dion and his father the greatest blessing in life, liberty, and the foundation of everything else he possessed.  But if his fears were verified, if he was bereft of friends and property, even as a lonely beggar he might continue to enjoy his freedom.  If, for the sake of those to whom he owed his best possession, he must surrender the rest, it was his duty to bear fate patiently.  It was still light.  Even when he had approached very near the house he heard no sound save the joyous barking of his wolf-hound, Argus, which leaped upon him.  He now laid his hand upon the lock of the door--but it was flung open from the inside.  Dion had seen him coming and, enraptured by the new happiness with which this day had blessed him, he flung himself impetuously on the breast of his faithful friend, exclaiming: \"A boy, a splendid boy!  We will call him Pyrrhus.\"  Bright tears of joy streamed down the freedman's face and fell on his grey beard; and when his wife came towards him with her finger on her lips, he whispered in a tremulous voice: \"When I brought them here you were afraid that the city people would drag us into ruin, but nevertheless you received them as they deserved to be, and--he's going to name him Pyrrhus--and now!--What has a poor fellow like me done to have such great and beautiful blessings fall to my lot?\"  \"And I--I?\" sobbed his wife.  \"And the child, the darling little creature!\"  This day of sunny happiness was followed by others of quiet joy, of the purest pleasure, yet mingled with the deepest anxiety.  They also brought many an hour in which Helena found an opportunity to show her prudence, while old Chloris and the fisherman's wife aided her by their experience.  Every one, down to the greybeard whose name the little one bore, declared that there had never been a lovelier young mother than Barine or a handsomer child than the infant Pyrrhus; but Dion could no longer endure to remain on the cliff.  A thousand things which he had hitherto deemed insignificant and allowed to pass unheeded now seemed important and imperatively in need of his personal attention.  He was a father, and any negligence might be harmful to his son.  With his bronzed complexion and long hair and beard he required little aid to disguise him from his friends.  In the garments shabby by long use, and with his delicate hands calloused by work in the dock-yard, any one would have taken him for a real fisherman.  Perhaps it was foolish, but the desire to show himself in the character of a father to Barine's mother and grandparents and to Gorgias seemed worth risking a slight danger; so, without informing Barine, who was now able to walk about her room, he set out for the city after sunset on the last day of July.  He knew that Octavianus was encamped in the Hippodrome east of Alexandria.  The white mounds which had risen there had been recognized as tents, even from the Serpent Island.  Pyrrhus had returned in the afternoon with tidings that Antony's mounted troops had defeated those of Octavianus.  This time the news of victory could be trusted, for the palace at Lochias was illuminated for a festival and when Dion landed there was a great bustle on the quay.  One shouted to another that all would be well.  Mark Antony was his old self again.  He had fought like a hero.  Many who yesterday had cursed him, to-day mingled their voices in the shouts of \"Evoe!\" which rang out for the new Dionysus, who had again proved his claim to godship.  The late visitor found the grandparents alone in the house of Gorgias. They had been informed of Barine's new happiness long before.  Now they rejoiced with Dion, and wanted to send at once for their host and future son-in-law, who was in the city attending a meeting of the Ephebi, although he had ceased some time ago to be a member of their company. But Dion wished to greet him among the youths who had invited the architect to give them his aid in deciding the question of the course they were to pursue in the impending battle.  Yet he did not leave the old couple immediately; he was expecting two visitors--Barine's mother and Charmian's Nubian maid who, since the birth of little Pyrrhus, had come to the philosopher's every evening.  The former's errand was to ask whether any news of the mother and child had been received during the day; the latter, to get the letters which she delivered the next morning at the fish-market to her friend Pyrrhus or his sons.  Anukis was the first to appear.  She relieved her sympathizing heart by a brief expression of congratulations; but, gladly as she would have listened to the most minute details concerning the beloved young mother from the lips of Dion himself, she repressed her own wishes for her mistress's sake, and returned to Charmian as quickly as possible to inform her of the arrival of the unexpected guest.  Berenike bore her new dignity of grandmother with grateful joy, yet to- night she came oppressed by a grave anxiety, which was not solely due to her power of imagining gloomy events.  Her brother Arius and his sons were concealed in the house of a friend, for they seemed threatened by a serious peril.  Hitherto Antony had generously borne the philosopher no ill-will on the score of his intimate relations with Octavianus; but now that Octavianus was encamped outside the city, the house of the man who, during the latter's years of education, had been his mentor and counsellor, and later a greatly valued friend, was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5480"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 08 (#7)"],["body","ed, by Mardion's orders, by the Scythian guard.  He and his family were forbidden to enter the city, and his escape to his friend had been effected under cover of the darkness and with great danger.  The anxious woman feared the worst for her brother if Mark Antony should conquer, and yet, with her whole heart, she wished the Queen to gain the victory.  She, who always feared the worst, saw in imagination the fortunes of war change--and there was reason for the belief.  The bold general who had gained so many victories, and whom the defeat of Actium had only humbled, was said to have regained his former elasticity.  He had dashed forward at the head of his men with the heroic courage of former days--nay, with reckless impetuosity.  Rumour reported that, with the huge sword he wielded, he had dealt from his powerful charger blows as terrible as those inflicted five-and-twenty years before when, not far from the same spot, he struck Archelaus on the head.  The statement that, in his golden armour, with the gold helmet framing his bearded face, he resembled his ancestor Herakles, was confirmed by Charmian, who had been borne quickly hither by a pair of the Queen's swift horses.  Cleopatra might need her soon, yet she had left the Lochias to question the father about many things concerning the young mother and her boy, who was already dear to her as the first grandson of the man whose suit, it is true, she had rejected, but to whom she owed the delicious consciousness of having loved and been loved in the springtime of life.  Dion found her changed.  The trying months which she had described in her letters to Barine had completely blanched her grey hair, her cheeks were sunken, and a deep line between her mouth and nose gave her pleasant face a sorrowful expression.  Besides, she seemed to have been weeping and, in fact, heart-rending events had just occurred.  She had stolen away from Lochias in the midst of a revel.  Antony's victory was being celebrated.  He himself presided at the banquet.  Again his head and breast were wreathed with a wealth of fresh leaves and superb flowers.  At his side reclined Cleopatra, robed in light-blue garments adorned with lotus-flowers which, like the little coronet on her head, glittered with sapphires and pearls.  Charmian said she had rarely looked more beautiful.  But she did not add that the Queen had been obliged to have rouge applied to her pale, bloodless cheeks.  It was touching to see Antony after his return from the battle, still in his suit of mail, clasp her in his arms as joyously as if he had won her back, a prize of victory, and with his vanished heroic power regained her and their mutual love.  Her eyes, too, had been radiant with joy and, in the elation of her heart, she had given the horseman who, for a deed of special daring, was presented to her, a helmet and coat of mail of solid gold.  Yet, even before the revel began, she had been forced to acknowledge to herself that the commencement of the end was approaching; for, a few hours after she had so generously rewarded the man, he had deserted to the foe.  Then Antony had challenged Octavianus to a duel, and received the unfeeling reply that he would find many roads to death open.  This was the language of the cold-hearted foe, secure of superior power. How sadly, too, she had been disappointed in the hope--that the veterans who had served under Antony would desert their new commander at the first summons and flock to his standard!--for all her husband's efforts in this direction, spite of the bewitching power of his eloquence, failed, while every hour brought tidings of the treacherous desertion from his army of individual warriors and whole maniples.  His foe deemed his cause so weak that he did not even resist Mark Antony's attempts to win the soldiers by promises.  From all these signs Cleopatra now saw plainly, in her lover's victory, only the last flicker of a dying fire; but so long as it burned he should see her follow its light.  Therefore she had entered the festal hall with the victor of the day. She had witnessed a strange festival.  It began with tears and reminded Cleopatra of the saying that she herself resembled a banquet served to celebrate a victory before the battle was won.  The cup-bearers had scarcely advanced to the guests with their golden vessels when Antony turned to them, exclaiming: \"Pour generously, men; perhaps to-morrow you will serve another master!\"  Then, unlike his usual self, he grew thoughtful and murmured under his breath, \"And I shall probably be lying outside a corpse, a miserable nothing.\"  Loud sobs from the cup-bearers and servants followed these words; but he addressed them calmly, assuring them that he would not take them into a battle from which he expected an honourable death rather than rescue and victory.  At this Cleopatra's tears flowed also.  If this reckless man of pleasure, this notorious spendthrift and disturber of the public peace, with his insatiate desires, had inspired bitter hostility, few had gained the warm love of so many hearts.  One glance at his heroic figure; one memory of the days when even his foes conceded that he was never greater than in the presence of the most imminent peril, never more capable of awakening in others the hope of brighter times than amid the sorest privations; one tone of the orator's deep, resonant voice, which so often came from the heart and therefore gained hearts with such resistless power; the recollection of numberless instances of the bright cheerfulness of his nature and his boundless generosity sufficiently explained the lamentations which burst forth at that banquet, the tears which flowed --tears of genuine feeling.  They were also shed for the beautiful Queen who, unmindful of the spectators, rested her noble brow, with its coronal of pearls, upon his mighty shoulder.  But the grief did not last long, for Mark Antony, shouted: \"Hence with melancholy!  We do not need the larva!       [At the banquets of the Egyptians a small figure in the shape of a      mummy was passed around to remind the guests that they, too, would      soon be in the same condition, and have no more time to enjoy life      and its pleasures.  The Romans imitated this custom by sending the      larva, a statuette in the form of a skeleton, to make the round of      the revellers.  The Greek love of beauty converted this ugly      scarecrow into a winged genius.]  We know, without its aid, that pleasure will soon be over!--Xuthus, a joyous festal song!--And you, Metrodor, lead the dancers!  The first beaker to the fairest, the best, the wisest, the most cherished, the most fervently beloved of women!\"  As he spoke he waved his goblet aloft, the flute-player, Xuthus, beckoned to the chorus, and the dancer Metrodor, in the guise of a butterfly, led forth a bevy of beautiful girls, who, in the cloud of ample robes of transparent coloured bombyx which floated around them, executed the most graceful figures and now hovered like mists, now flitted to and fro as if borne on wings, affording the most charming variety to the delighted spectators.  The \"Comrades of Death\" had again become companions in pleasure; and when Charmian, who did not lose sight of her mistress, noticed the sorrowful quiver of her lips and glided out of the circle of guests, the faithful Nubian had approached to inform her of Dion's arrival.  Then--but this she concealed from her friends--she hastened to her own apartments to prepare to go out, and when Iras opened the door to enter her rooms she went to speak to her about the night attendance upon the Queen.  But her niece had not perceived her; shaken by convulsive sobs, she had pressed her face among the cushions of a couch, and there suffered the fierce anguish which had stirred the inmost depths of her being to rave itself out with the full vehemence of her passionate nature.  Charmian called her name and, weeping herself, ripened her arms to her, and for the first time since her return from Actium her sister's daughter again sank upon her breast, and they held each other in a close embrace until Charmian's exclamation, \"With her, for her unto death!\" was answered by Iras's \"To the tomb!\"  This was a word which, in many an hour of the silent night, had stirred the soul of the woman who had been the youthful playmate of the Queen who, with bleeding heart, sat below among the revellers at the noisy banquet and forced her to ask the question: \"Is not your fate bound to hers?  What can life offer you without her?\"  Now, this word was spoken by other lips, and, like an echo of Iras's exclamation, came the answer: \"Unto death, like you, if she precedes us to the other world.  Whatever may follow dying, nowhere shall she lack Charmian's hand and heart.\"  \"Nor the love and service of Iras,\" was the answering assurance.  So they had parted, and the agitation of this fateful moment was still visible in the features of the woman who had formerly sacrificed to her royal playfellow her love, and now offered her life.  When, ere leaving Gorgias's house, she bade her friend farewell, she pressed Dion's hand with affectionate warmth and, as he accompanied her to the carriage, she informed him that, before the first encounter of the troops, Archibius had taken the royal children to his estate of Irenia, where they were at present.  \"Rarely has it been my fate to experience a more sorrowful hour than when I beheld the Queen, her heart torn with anguish, bid them fare well. What fate is impending over the dear ones, who are so worthy of the greatest happiness?  To see the twins and little Alexander recognized and saved from death and insult, and your boy in Barine's arms, is the last wish which I still cherish.\"  On returning to Lochias, Charmian had a long time to wait ere the Queen retired.  She dreaded the mood in which she would leave the banquet. For months past Cleopatra had returned from the revels of the \"Comrades of Death\""]]]
