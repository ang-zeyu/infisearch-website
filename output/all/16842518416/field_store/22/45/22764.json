As soon as Dion and the older man were alone, the latter inquired the cause of the increasing uproar, and as, like every well-disposed Alexandrian, he esteemed Archibius, and knew that he was intimately acquainted with the owner of the imperilled garden, and therefore with his granddaughter Barine, he confided his anxiety to him without reserve.  \"Iras is your niece, it is true,\" he said in his open-hearted manner, \"but I know that you understand her character.  It suits her now to fling a golden apple into the path of a person whom she dislikes and believes incautious, that she may pick it up and thus afford her an opportunity to bring a charge of theft.\"  Noting the inquiring glance Archibius fixed upon him as he made this comparison, he changed his tone and continued more earnestly: \"Zeus is great, but destiny is superior even to him.  Zeus can accomplish much, but when Iras and your sister Charmian, who unfortunately is now with the Queen, wish to effect anything, he, like the Regent Mardion, must give way.  The more lovable Cleopatra is, the more surely every one prizes a position near her person above aught else, especially such trifles as law and justice.\"  \"These are harsh words,\" responded Archibius, and seem the more bitter in proportion to the germ of truth which they contain.  Our court shares the fate of every other in the East, and those to whom Rome formerly set the example of holding law and justice sacred--\"  \"Can now go there,\" interrupted Dion, \"to learn how rudely both are trampled under foot.  The sovereigns here and there may smile at one another like the augurs.  They are like brothers--\"  \"But with the difference,\" Archibius broke in, \"that the head of our public affairs is the very embodiment of affability and grace; while in Rome, on the contrary, harsh severity and bloody arrogance, or even repulsive servility, guide the reins.\"  Here Archibius interrupted himself to point to the shouting throng advancing towards them.  \"You are right,\" Dion answered.  \"Let us defer this discussion till we can pursue it in the house of the charming Barine.  But I rarely meet you there, though by blood you are so nearly allied to her father.  I am her friend--at my age that might easily mean her lover.  But in our case the comparison would not suit.  Yet perhaps you will believe me, for you have the right to call yourself the friend of the most bewitching of women.\"  A sorrowful smile flitted over the grave, set features of the older man, who, raising his hand as if in protest, answered carelessly: \"I grew up with Cleopatra, but a private citizen loves a queen only as a divinity. I believe in your friendship for Barine, though I deem it dangerous.\"  \"If you mean that it might injure the lovely woman,\" replied Dion, raising his head more proudly as if to intimate that he required no warning, even from him, \"perhaps you are right.  Only I beg you not to misunderstand me.  I am not vain enough to suppose that I could win her heart, but unfortunately there are many who cannot forgive the power of attraction which she exerts over me as well as upon all.  So many men gladly visit Barine's house that there are an equal number of women who would rejoice to close it.  Among them, of course, is Iras.  She dislikes my friend; nay, I fear that what you witness yonder is the apple she flung in order, if not to ruin, at least to drive her from the city, ere the Queen--may the gods grant her victory!--ere Cleopatra returns.  You know your niece Iras.  Like your sister Charmian, she will shrink from nothing to remove an annoyance from her mistress's pathway, and it will hardly please Cleopatra when she learns that the two youths whose welfare lies nearest her heart--Antyllus and Caesarion--seek Barine's house, no matter how stainless the latter's reputation may be.\"  \"I have just heard of it,\" replied Archibius, \"and I, too, am anxious. Antony's son has inherited much of his father's insatiable love of pleasure.  But Caesarion!  He has not yet ventured out of the dreamland which surrounds him into actual life.  What others scarcely perceive deals him a serious blow.  I fear Eros is sharpening arrows for him which will pierce deep into his heart.  While talking with me he seemed strangely changed.  His dreamy eyes glittered like a drunkard's when he spoke of Barine.  I fear, I fear--\"  \"Impossible!\" cried Dion, in surprise, nay, almost terror.  \"If that is the case, Iras is not wholly wrong, and we must deal with the matter differently.  But it is of the first importance to conceal the fact that Caesarion has any interest in the affairs of the old house-owner.  To seek to maintain the old man's right to his own property is a matter of course, and I will undertake to do this and try to get yonder orator home Just see how the braggart is swinging his arms in Iras's service!  As for Barine, it will be well to induce her to leave of her own free will a city where it will be made unpleasant for her.  Try to persuade her to pursue this course.  If I went to her with such a suggestion, I, who yesterday--No, no!  Besides, she might hear that Iras and I--She would imagine all sorts of absurdities.  You know what jealousy means.  To you, whom she esteems, she would surely listen, and she need not go far from the city.  If the heart of this enthusiastic boy--who might some day desire to be 'King of kings' not only in name--should really be fired with love for Barine, what serious misfortune might follow!  We must secure her from him.  She could not go to my country house among the papyrus plantations at Sebennys.  It would afford too much license for evil tongues.  But you--your villa at Kanopus is too near--but, if I am not mistaken, you have--\"  \"My estate in the lake region is remote enough, and will be at her disposal,\" interrupted the other.  \"The house is always kept ready for my reception.  I will do my best to persuade her, for your advice is prudent.  She must be withdrawn from the boy's eyes.\"  \"I shall learn the result of your mission tomorrow,\" cried Dion eagerly-- \"nay, this evening.  If she consents, I will tell Iras, as if by accident, that Barine has gone to Upper Egypt to drink new milk, or something of that kind.  Iras is a shrewd woman, and will be glad if she can keep aloof from such trifles during the time which will decide the fate of Cleopatra and of the world.\"  \"My thoughts, too, are always with the army,\" said Archibius.  \"How trivial everything else seems compared with the result which will be determined in the next few days!  But life is made up of trifles.  They are food, drink, maintenance.  Should the Queen return triumphant, and find Caesarion in wrong paths--\"  \"We must close them against him,\" exclaimed Dion.  \"That the boy may not follow Barine?\" asked Archibius, shaking his head. \"I think we need feel no anxiety on that score.  He will doubtless eagerly desire to do so, but with him there is a wide gulf between the wish and its fulfilment.  Antyllus is differently constituted.  He would be quite capable of ordering a horse to be saddled, or the sails of a boat to be spread in order to pursue her--beyond the Cataract if necessary.  So we must maintain the utmost secrecy concerning the place to which Barine voluntarily exiles herself.\"  \"But she is not yet on her way,\" replied Dion with a faint sigh.  \"She is bound to this city by many ties.\"  \"I know it,\" answered Archibius, confirming his companion's fear.  The latter, pointing to the equipage, said in a rapid, earnest tone: \"Gorgias is beckoning.  But, before we part, let me beseech you to do everything to persuade Barine to leave here.  She is in serious danger.  Conceal nothing from her, and say that her friends will not leave her too long in solitude.\"  Archibius, with a significant glance, shook his finger at the young man in playful menace, and then went up to the carriage.  Caesarion's clear-cut but pallid face, whose every feature resembled that of his father, the great Caesar, bent towards them from the opening above the door, as he greeted both with a formal bend of the head and a patronizing glance.  His eyes had sparkled with boyish glee when he first caught sight of the friend from whom he had been separated several weeks, but to the stranger he wished to assume the bearing which beseemed a king.  He desired to make him feel his superior position, for he was ill- disposed towards him.  He had seen him favoured by the woman whom he imagined he loved, and whose possession he had been promised by the secret science of the Egyptians, whose power to unveil the mysteries of the future he firmly believed.  Antyllus, Antony's son, had taken him to Barine, and she had received him with the consideration due his rank. Spite of her bright graciousness, boyish timidity had hitherto prevented any word of love to the young beauty whom he saw surrounded by so many distinguished men of mature years.  Yet his beaming, expressive eyes must have revealed his feelings to her.  Doubtless his glances had not been unobserved, for only a few hours before an Egyptian woman had stopped him at the temple of his father, Caesar, to which, according to the fixed rules governing the routine of his life, he went daily at a certain hour to pray, to offer sacrifices, to anoint the stone of the altar, or to crown the statue of the departed emperor.  Caesarion had instantly recognized her as the female slave whom he had seen in Barine's atrium, and ordered his train to fall back.  Fortunately his tutor, Rhodon, had not fulfilled his duty of accompanying him.  So the youth had ventured to follow the slave woman, and in the shadow of the mimosas, in the little grove beside the temple, he found Barine's litter.  His heart throbbed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5473"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 01 (#4)"],["body","as, full of anxious expectation, he obeyed her signal to draw nearer.  Still, she had granted him nothing save the favour of gratifying one of her wishes.  But his heart had swelled almost to bursting when, resting her beautiful white arm on the door of her litter, she had told him that unjust men were striving to rob her grandfather Didymus of his garden, and she expected him, who bore the title of the \"King of kings\" to do his best to prevent such a crime.  It had been difficult for him to grasp her meaning while she was speaking.  There was a roaring sound in his ears as if, instead of being in the silent temple grove, he was standing on a stormy day upon the surf-beaten promontory of Lochias.  He had not ventured to raise his eyes and look into her face.  Not until she closed with the question whether she might hope for his assistance did her gaze constrain him to glance up.  Ah, what had he not fancied he read in her imploring blue eyes! how unspeakably beautiful she had appeared!  He had stood before her as if bereft of his senses.  His sole knowledge was that he had promised, with his hand on his heart, to do everything in his power to prevent what threatened to cause her pain.  Then her little hand, with its sparkling rings, was again stretched towards him, and he had resolved to kiss it; but while he glanced around at his train, she had already waved him a farewell, and the litter was borne away.  He stood motionless, like the figure of a man on one of his mother's ancient vases, staring in bewilderment after the flying figure of Happiness, whom he might easily have caught by her floating locks.  How he raged over the miserable indecision which had defrauded him of so much joy!  Yet nothing was really lost.  If he succeeded in fulfilling her wishes, she could not fail to be grateful; and then--  He pondered over the person to whom he should apply--Mardion, the Regent, or the Keeper of the Seal?  No, they had planned the erection of the group of sculpture in the philosopher's garden.  To Iras, his mother's confidante?  Nay, last of all to her.  The cunning woman would have perceived his purpose and betrayed it to the Regent.  Ah, if Charmian, his mother's other attendant, had been present!  but she was with the fleet, which perhaps was even now engaged in battle with the enemy.  At this recollection his eyes again sought the ground--he had not been permitted to take the place in the army to which his birth entitled him, while his mother and Charmian--But he did not pursue this painful current of thought; for a serious reproach had forced itself upon him and sent the blood to his cheeks.  He wished to be considered a man, and yet, in these fateful days, which would determine the destiny of his mother, his native city, Egypt, and that Rome which he, the only son of Caesar, was taught to consider his heritage, he was visiting a beautiful woman, thinking of her, and of her alone.  His days and half the nights were passed in forming plans for securing her love, forgetful of what should have occupied his whole heart.  Only yesterday Iras had sharply admonished him that, in times like these, it was the duty of every friend of Cleopatra, and every foe of her foes, to be with the army at least in mind.  He had remembered this, but, instead of heeding the warning, the thought of her had merely recalled her uncle, Archibius, who possessed great influence, not merely on account of his wealth but because every one also knew his high standing in the regard of the Queen.  Besides, the clever, kindly man had always been friendly to him from childhood, and like a revelation came the idea of applying to him, and to the architect Gorgias, who had a voice in the matter, and by whom he had been strongly attracted during the period while he was rebuilding the wing assigned to the prince in the palace at Lochias.  So one of the attendants was instantly despatched with the little tablet which invited Gorgias to the interview at the Temple of Isis.  Then, in the afternoon, Caesarion went secretly in a boat to the little palace of Archibius, situated on the seashore at Kanopus, and now as the latter, with his friend, stood beside the carriage door, he explained to them that he was going with the architect to old Didymus to assure him of his assistance.  This was unadvisable in every respect, but it required all the weight of the older man's reasons to induce the prince to yield.  The consequences which might ensue, should the populace discover that he was taking sides against the Regent, would be incalculable.  But submission and withdrawal were especially difficult to the young \"King of kings.\"  He longed to pose as a man in Dion's presence, and as this could not be, he strove to maintain the semblance of independence by yielding his resolve only on the plea of not desiring to injure the aged scholar and his granddaughter.  Finally, he again entreated the architect to secure Didymus in the possession of his property.  When at last he drove away with Archibius, twilight was already gathering, torches were lighted in front of the temple and the little mausoleum adjoining the cella, and pitch-pans were blazing in the square.     CHAPTER III.  \"The lad is in an evil plight,\" said Gorgias, shaking his head thoughtfully as the equipage rolled over the stone pavement of the Street of the King.  \"And over yonder, added Dion,\" \"the prospect is equally unpleasing. Philostratus is setting the people crazy.  But the hired mischief-maker will soon wish he had been less ready to seize Iras's gold coins.\"  \"And to think,\" cried the architect, \"that Barine was this scoundrel's wife!  How could it--\"  \"She was but a child when they married her,\" interrupted Dion.  \"Who consults a girl of fifteen in the choice of a husband?  And Philostratus --he was my classmate at Rhodus--at that time had the fairest prospects. His brother Alexas, Antony's favourite, could easily advance him. Barine's father was dead, her mother was accustomed to follow Didymus's counsel, and the clever fellow had managed to strew dust in the old man's eyes.  Long and lank as he is, he is not bad-looking even now.  \"When he appeared as an orator he pleased his hearers.  This turned his head, and a spendthrift's blood runs in his veins.  To bring his fair young bride to a stately mansion, he undertook the bad cause of the thievish tax-collector Pyrrhus, and cleared him.\"  \"He bought a dozen false witnesses.\"  \"There were sixteen.  Afterwards they became as numerous as the open mouths you see shouting yonder.  It is time to silence them.  Go to the old man's house and soothe him--Barine also, if she is there.  If you find messengers from the Regent, raise objections to the unprecedented decree.  You know the portions of the law which can be turned to Didymus's advantage.\"  \"Since the reign of Euergetes II, registered landed property has been unassailable, and his was recorded.\"  \"So much the better.  Tell the officials also, confidentially, that you know of objections just discovered which may perhaps change the Regent's views.\"  \"And, above all, I shall insist upon my right to choose the place for the twin statues.  The Queen herself directed the others to heed my opinion.\"  \"That will cast the heaviest weight into the scale.  We shall meet later. You will prefer to keep away from Barine to-night.  If you see her, tell her that Archibius said he would visit her later--for an object I will explain afterwards.  I shall probably go to Iras to bring her to reason. It will be better not to mention Caesarion's wish.\"  \"Certainly--and you will give nothing to yonder brawler.\"  \"On the contrary.  I feel very generous.  If Peitho will aid me, the insatiate fellow will get more than may be agreeable to him.\"  Then grasping the architect's hand, Dion forced his way through the throng surrounding the high platform on wheels, upon which the closely covered piece of sculpture had been rolled up.  The gate of the scholar's house stood open, for an officer in the Regent's service had really entered a short time before, but the Scythian guards sent by the exegetus Demetrius, one of Barine's friends, were keeping back the throng of curious spectators.  Their commander knew Gorgias, and he was soon standing in the impluvium of the scholar's house, an oblong, rootless space, with a fountain in the centre, whose spray moistened the circular bed of flowers around it.  The old slave had just lighted some three-branched lamps which burned on tall stands.  The officers sent by the Regent to inform Didymus that his garden would be converted into a public square had just arrived.  When Gorgias entered, these magistrates, their clerks, and the witnesses accompanying them--a group of twenty men, at whose head was Apollonius, a distinguished officer of the royal treasury--were in the house.  The slave who admitted the architect informed him of it.  In the atrium a young girl, doubtless a member of the household, stopped him.  He was not mistaken in supposing that she was Helena, Didymus's younger granddaughter, of whom Barine had spoken.  True, she resembled her sister neither in face nor figure, for while the young matron's hair was fair and waving, the young girl's thick black tresses were wound around her head in a smooth braid.  Very unlike Barine's voice, too, were the deep, earnest tones trembling with emotion, in which she confronted him with the brief question, concealing a faint reproach, \"Another demand?\"  After first ascertaining that he was really speaking to Helena, his friend's sister, he hastily told her his name, adding that, on the contrary, he had come to protect her grandfather from a serious misfortune.  When his glance first rested upon her in the dimly lighted room, the impression she made upon him was by no means favourable.  The pure brow, which seemed to him too high for a woman's face, wore an indignant frown; and though her mouth was beautiful in form, its outlines were "]]]
