I saw the white wake leap from her bow straight toward the enemy cruiser.  A chorus of hoarse yells arose from the deck of our own craft:  I saw the officers stand suddenly erect in the boat that was approaching us, and I heard loud cries and curses from the raider. Then I turned my attention to my own business.  Most of the men on the submarine's deck were standing in paralyzed fascination, staring at the torpedo. Bradley happened to be looking toward the conning-tower and saw me.  I sprang on deck and ran toward him.  \"Quick!\" I whispered. \"While they are stunned, we must overcome them.\"  A German was standing near Bradley--just in front of him. The Englishman struck the fellow a frantic blow upon the neck and at the same time snatched his pistol from its holster. Von Schoenvorts had recovered from his first surprise quickly and had turned toward the main hatch to investigate.  I covered him with my revolver, and at the same instant the torpedo struck the raider, the terrific explosion drowning the German's command to his men.  Bradley was now running from one to another of our men, and though some of the Germans saw and heard him, they seemed too stunned for action.  Olson was below, so that there were only nine of us against eight Germans, for the man Bradley had struck still lay upon the deck. Only two of us were armed; but the heart seemed to have gone out of the boches, and they put up but half-hearted resistance. Von Schoenvorts was the worst--he was fairly frenzied with rage and chagrin, and he came charging for me like a mad bull, and as he came he discharged his pistol.  If he'd stopped long enough to take aim, he might have gotten me; but his pace made him wild, so that not a shot touched me, and then we clinched and went to the deck.  This left two pistols, which two of my own men were quick to appropriate.  The Baron was no match for me in a hand-to-hand encounter, and I soon had him pinned to the deck and the life almost choked out of him.  A half-hour later things had quieted down, and all was much the same as before the prisoners had revolted--only we kept a much closer watch on von Schoenvorts.  The _Geier_ had sunk while we were still battling upon our deck, and afterward we had drawn away toward the north, leaving the survivors to the attention of the single boat which had been making its way toward us when Olson launched the torpedo.  I suppose the poor devils never reached land, and if they did, they most probably perished on that cold and unhospitable shore; but I couldn't permit them aboard the U-33.  We had all the Germans we could take care of.  That evening the girl asked permission to go on deck.  She said that she felt the effects of long confinement below, and I readily granted her request.  I could not understand her, and I craved an opportunity to talk with her again in an effort to fathom her and her intentions, and so I made it a point to follow her up the ladder.  It was a clear, cold, beautiful night. The sea was calm except for the white water at our bows and the two long radiating swells running far off into the distance upon either hand astern, forming a great V which our propellers filled with choppy waves.  Benson was in the tower, we were bound for San Diego and all looked well.  Lys stood with a heavy blanket wrapped around her slender figure, and as I approached her, she half turned toward me to see who it was. When she recognized me, she immediately turned away.  \"I want to thank you,\" I said, \"for your bravery and loyalty--you were magnificent.  I am sorry that you had reason before to think that I doubted you.\"  \"You did doubt me,\" she replied in a level voice.  \"You practically accused me of aiding Baron von Schoenvorts.  I can never forgive you.\"  There was a great deal of finality in both her words and tone.  \"I could not believe it,\" I said; \"and yet two of my men reported having seen you in conversation with von Schoenvorts late at night upon two separate occasions--after each of which some great damage was found done us in the morning.  I didn't want to doubt you; but I carried all the responsibility of the lives of these men, of the safety of the ship, of your life and mine.  I had to watch you, and I had to put you on your guard against a repetition of your madness.\"  She was looking at me now with those great eyes of hers, very wide and round.  \"Who told you that I spoke with Baron von Schoenvorts at night, or any other time?\" she asked.  \"I cannot tell you, Lys,\" I replied, \"but it came to me from two different sources.\"  \"Then two men have lied,\" she asserted without heat.  \"I have not spoken to Baron von Schoenvorts other than in your presence when first we came aboard the U-33.  And please, when you address me, remember that to others than my intimates I am Miss La Rue.\"  Did you ever get slapped in the face when you least expected it? No? Well, then you do not know how I felt at that moment. I could feel the hot, red flush surging up my neck, across my cheeks, over my ears, clear to my scalp.  And it made me love her all the more; it made me swear inwardly a thousand solemn oaths that I would win her.   [1]  Late in July, 1916, an item in the shipping news mentioned a Swedish sailing vessel, Balmen, Rio de Janeiro to Barcelona, sunk by a German raider sometime in June.  A single survivor in an open boat was picked up off the Cape Verde Islands, in a dying condition. He expired without giving any details.    Chapter 4  For several days things went along in about the same course. I took our position every morning with my crude sextant; but the results were always most unsatisfactory.  They always showed a considerable westing when I knew that we had been sailing due north. I blamed my crude instrument, and kept on.  Then one afternoon the girl came to me.  \"Pardon me,\" she said, \"but were I you, I should watch this man Benson--especially when he is in charge.\"  I asked her what she meant, thinking I could see the influence of von Schoenvorts raising a suspicion against one of my most trusted men.  \"If you will note the boat's course a half-hour after Benson goes on duty,\" she said, \"you will know what I mean, and you will understand why he prefers a night watch.  Possibly, too, you will understand some other things that have taken place aboard.\"  Then she went back to her room, thus ending the conversation. I waited until half an hour after Benson had gone on duty, and then I went on deck, passing through the conning-tower where Benson sat, and looking at the compass.  It showed that our course was north by west--that is, one point west of north, which was, for our assumed position, about right.  I was greatly relieved to find that nothing was wrong, for the girl's words had caused me considerable apprehension.  I was about to return to my room when a thought occurred to me that again caused me to change my mind--and, incidentally, came near proving my death-warrant.  When I had left the conning-tower little more than a half-hour since, the sea had been breaking over the port bow, and it seemed to me quite improbable that in so short a time an equally heavy sea could be deluging us from the opposite side of the ship--winds may change quickly, but not a long, heavy sea.  There was only one other solution--since I left the tower, our course had been altered some eight points.  Turning quickly, I climbed out upon the conning-tower. A single glance at the heavens confirmed my suspicions; the constellations which should have been dead ahead were directly starboard.  We were sailing due west.  Just for an instant longer I stood there to check up my calculations--I wanted to be quite sure before I accused Benson of perfidy, and about the only thing I came near making quite sure of was death.  I cannot see even now how I escaped it. I was standing on the edge of the conning-tower, when a heavy palm suddenly struck me between the shoulders and hurled me forward into space.  The drop to the triangular deck forward of the conning-tower might easily have broken a leg for me, or I might have slipped off onto the deck and rolled overboard; but fate was upon my side, as I was only slightly bruised.  As I came to my feet, I heard the conning-tower cover slam.  There is a ladder which leads from the deck to the top of the tower. Up this I scrambled, as fast as I could go; but Benson had the cover tight before I reached it.  I stood there a moment in dumb consternation.  What did the fellow intend?  What was going on below?  If Benson was a traitor, how could I know that there were not other traitors among us? I cursed myself for my folly in going out upon the deck, and then this thought suggested another--a hideous one: who was it that had really been responsible for my being here?  Thinking to attract attention from inside the craft, I again ran down the ladder and onto the small deck only to find that the steel covers of the conning-tower windows were shut, and then I leaned with my back against the tower and cursed myself for a gullible idiot.  I glanced at the bow.  The sea seemed to be getting heavier, for every wave now washed completely over the lower deck.  I watched them for a moment, and then a sudden chill pervaded my entire being. It was not the chill of wet clothing, or the dashing spray which drenched my face; no, it was the chill of the hand of death upon my heart.  In an instant I had turned the last corner of life's highway and was looking God Almighty in the face--the U-33 was being slowly submerged!  It would be difficult, even impossible, to set down in writing my sensations at that moment.  All I can particularly recall is that I laughed, though neither from a spirit of bravado nor from hysteria. And I wanted to smoke.  Lord! how I did want to smoke; but that was out of the question.  I watched the water rise until the little deck I stood on was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/551"],["title","The Land That Time Forgot (#7)"],["body","wash, and then I clambered once more to the top of the conning-tower. From the very slow submergence of the boat I knew that Benson was doing the entire trick alone--that he was merely permitting the diving-tanks to fill and that the diving-rudders were not in use. The throbbing of the engines ceased, and in its stead came the steady vibration of the electric motors.  The water was halfway up the conning-tower!  I had perhaps five minutes longer on the deck. I tried to decide what I should do after I was washed away.  Should I swim until exhaustion claimed me, or should I give up and end the agony at the first plunge?  From below came two muffled reports.  They sounded not unlike shots. Was Benson meeting with resistance?  Personally it could mean little to me, for even though my men might overcome the enemy, none would know of my predicament until long after it was too late to succor me. The top of the conning-tower was now awash.  I clung to the wireless mast, while the great waves surged sometimes completely over me.  I knew the end was near and, almost involuntarily, I did that which I had not done since childhood--I prayed.  After that I felt better.  I clung and waited, but the water rose no higher.  Instead it receded.  Now the top of the conning-tower received only the crests of the higher waves; now the little triangular deck below became visible!  What had occurred within?  Did Benson believe me already gone, and was he emerging because of that belief, or had he and his forces been vanquished?  The suspense was more wearing than that which I had endured while waiting for dissolution.  Presently the main deck came into view, and then the conning-tower opened behind me, and I turned to look into the anxious face of Bradley.  An expression of relief overspread his features.  \"Thank God, man!\" was all he said as he reached forth and dragged me into the tower.  I was cold and numb and rather all in. Another few minutes would have done for me, I am sure, but the warmth of the interior helped to revive me, aided and abetted by some brandy which Bradley poured down my throat, from which it nearly removed the membrane.  That brandy would have revived a corpse.  When I got down into the centrale, I saw the Germans lined up on one side with a couple of my men with pistols standing over them. Von Schoenvorts was among them.  On the floor lay Benson, moaning, and beyond him stood the girl, a revolver in one hand. I looked about, bewildered.  \"What has happened down here?\" I asked.  \"Tell me!\"  Bradley replied.  \"You see the result, sir,\" he said.  \"It might have been a very different result but for Miss La Rue.  We were all asleep. Benson had relieved the guard early in the evening; there was no one to watch him--no one but Miss La Rue.  She felt the submergence of the boat and came out of her room to investigate. She was just in time to see Benson at the diving rudders.  When he saw her, he raised his pistol and fired point-blank at her, but he missed and she fired--and didn't miss.  The two shots awakened everyone, and as our men were armed, the result was inevitable as you see it; but it would have been very different had it not been for Miss La Rue.  It was she who closed the diving-tank sea-cocks and roused Olson and me, and had the pumps started to empty them.\"  And there I had been thinking that through her machinations I had been lured to the deck and to my death!  I could have gone on my knees to her and begged her forgiveness--or at least I could have, had I not been Anglo-Saxon.  As it was, I could only remove my soggy cap and bow and mumble my appreciation.  She made no reply--only turned and walked very rapidly toward her room. Could I have heard aright?  Was it really a sob that came floating back to me through the narrow aisle of the U-33?  Benson died that night.  He remained defiant almost to the last; but just before he went out, he motioned to me, and I leaned over to catch the faintly whispered words.  \"I did it alone,\" he said.  \"I did it because I hate you--I hate all your kind.  I was kicked out of your shipyard at Santa Monica. I was locked out of California.  I am an I. W. W. I became a German agent--not because I love them, for I hate them too--but because I wanted to injure Americans, whom I hated more.  I threw the wireless apparatus overboard.  I destroyed the chronometer and the sextant.  I devised a scheme for varying the compass to suit my wishes.  I told Wilson that I had seen the girl talking with von Schoenvorts, and I made the poor egg think he had seen her doing the same thing.  I am sorry--sorry that my plans failed. I hate you.\"  He didn't die for a half-hour after that; nor did he speak again--aloud; but just a few seconds before he went to meet his Maker, his lips moved in a faint whisper; and as I leaned closer to catch his words, what do you suppose I heard?  \"Now--I--lay me--down--to--sleep\" That was all; Benson was dead.  We threw his body overboard.  The wind of that night brought on some pretty rough weather with a lot of black clouds which persisted for several days.  We didn't know what course we had been holding, and there was no way of finding out, as we could no longer trust the compass, not knowing what Benson had done to it.  The long and the short of it was that we cruised about aimlessly until the sun came out again.  I'll never forget that day or its surprises.  We reckoned, or rather guessed, that we were somewhere off the coast of Peru.  The wind, which had been blowing fitfully from the east, suddenly veered around into the south, and presently we felt a sudden chill.  \"Peru!\" snorted Olson.  \"When were yez after smellin' iceber-rgs off Peru?\"  Icebergs!  \"Icebergs, nothin'!\" exclaimed one of the Englishmen. \"Why, man, they don't come north of fourteen here in these waters.\"  \"Then,\" replied Olson, \"ye're sout' of fourteen, me b'y.\"  We thought he was crazy; but he wasn't, for that afternoon we sighted a great berg south of us, and we'd been running north, we thought, for days.  I can tell you we were a discouraged lot; but we got a faint thrill of hope early the next morning when the lookout bawled down the open hatch:  \"Land!  Land northwest by west!\"  I think we were all sick for the sight of land.  I know that I was; but my interest was quickly dissipated by the sudden illness of three of the Germans.  Almost simultaneously they commenced vomiting. They couldn't suggest any explanation for it.  I asked them what they had eaten, and found they had eaten nothing other than the food cooked for all of us.  \"Have you drunk anything?\"  I asked, for I knew that there was liquor aboard, and medicines in the same locker.  \"Only water,\" moaned one of them.  \"We all drank water together this morning.  We opened a new tank.  Maybe it was the water.\"  I started an investigation which revealed a terrifying condition--some one, probably Benson, had poisoned all the running water on the ship. It would have been worse, though, had land not been in sight.  The sight of land filled us with renewed hope.  Our course had been altered, and we were rapidly approaching what appeared to be a precipitous headland.  Cliffs, seemingly rising perpendicularly out of the sea, faded away into the mist upon either hand as we approached.  The land before us might have been a continent, so mighty appeared the shoreline; yet we knew that we must be thousands of miles from the nearest western land-mass--New Zealand or Australia.  We took our bearings with our crude and inaccurate instruments; we searched the chart; we cudgeled our brains; and at last it was Bradley who suggested a solution.  He was in the tower and watching the compass, to which he called my attention.  The needle was pointing straight toward the land.  Bradley swung the helm hard to starboard.  I could feel the U-33 respond, and yet the arrow still clung straight and sure toward the distant cliffs.  \"What do you make of it?\" I asked him.  \"Did you ever hear of Caproni?\" he asked.  \"An early Italian navigator?\" I returned.  \"Yes; he followed Cook about 1721.  He is scarcely mentioned even by contemporaneous historians--probably because he got into political difficulties on his return to Italy.  It was the fashion to scoff at his claims, but I recall reading one of his works--his only one, I believe--in which he described a new continent in the south seas, a continent made up of 'some strange metal' which attracted the compass; a rockbound, inhospitable coast, without beach or harbor, which extended for hundreds of miles. He could make no landing; nor in the several days he cruised about it did he see sign of life.  He called it Caprona and sailed away. I believe, sir, that we are looking upon the coast of Caprona, uncharted and forgotten for two hundred years.\"  \"If you are right, it might account for much of the deviation of the compass during the past two days,\" I suggested.  \"Caprona has been luring us upon her deadly rocks.  Well, we'll accept her challenge. We'll land upon Caprona.  Along that long front there must be a vulnerable spot.  We will find it, Bradley, for we must find it.  We must find water on Caprona, or we must die.\"  And so we approached the coast upon which no living eyes had ever rested.  Straight from the ocean's depths rose towering cliffs, shot with brown and blues and greens--withered moss and lichen and the verdigris of copper, and everywhere the rusty ocher of iron pyrites. The cliff-tops, though ragged, were of such uniform height as to suggest the boundaries of a great plateau, and now and again we caught glimpses of verdure topping the rocky escarpment, as though bush or jungle-land had pushed outward from a lush vegetation farther inland to signal to an unseeing world that Caprona lived and joyed in life beyond her austere and repellent coast.  But metaphor, however poetic, never slaked a dry throat. To enjoy Caprona's romantic suggestions we must have water, and so we came in close,"]]]
