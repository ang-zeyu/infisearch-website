Are you disposed to submit patiently to the blow struck at you and at your parent's worthy memory by this restless old man, who hates you as he did your father before you?\"  \"Certainly not,\" replied the youth proudly.  \"That is right!\"  cried the general.  \"That is what I expected of you; but tell me now, with what weapons you, a Christian, propose to defy this shrewd and powerful man, in whose hands--as I know full well--you have placed the weal and woe, not of your souls alone....\"  \"I do not know yet,\" replied Orion, and as he met a glance of scorn from the Vekeel, he looked down.  At this Amru rose, went closer to him, and said \"And you will seek them in vain, my young friend; nor, if you found them, could you use them. It is easier to hit a woman, an eel, a soaring bird, than these supple, weak, unarmed, robed creatures, who have love and peace on their tongues and use their physical helplessness as a defence, aiming invisible but poisoned darts at those they hate--at you first and foremost, Son of the Mukaukas; I know it and I advise you: Be on your guard!  If indeed manly revenge for this slight on your father's memory is dear to your heart you can easily procure it--but only on one condition.\"  \"Show it me!\"  cried Orion with flaming eyes.  \"Become one of us.\"  \"That is what I came here for.  My brain and my arm from this day forth are at the service of the rulers of my country: yourself and our common master the Khaliff.\"  \"Ya Salaam--that is well!\"  cried Amru, laying his hand on Orion's shoulder.  \"There is but one God, and yours is ours, too, for there is none other but He! you will not have to sacrifice much in becoming a Moslem, for we, too, count your lord Jesus as one of the prophets; and even you must confess that the last and greatest of them is Mohammed, the true prophet of God.  Every man must acknowledge our lord Mohammed, who does not wilfully shut his eyes to the events which have come about under his government and in his name.  Your own father admitted. . .\"  \"My father?\"  \"He was forced to admit that we are more zealous, more earnest, more deeply possessed by our faith than you, his own fellow-believers.\"  \"I know it.\"  \"And when I told him that I had given orders that the desk for the reader of the Koran in our new mosque should be discarded, because when he stepped up to it he was uplifted above the other worshippers, the weary Mukaukas was quite agitated with satisfaction and uttered a loud cry of approbation.  We Moslems--for that was what my commands implied--must all be equal in the presence of God, the Eternal, the Almighty, the All- merciful; their leader in prayer must not be raised above them, even by a head; the teaching of the Prophet points the road to Paradise, to all alike, we need no earthly guide to show us the way.  It is our faith, our righteousness, our good deeds that open or close the gates of heaven; not a key in the hand of a priest.  When you are one of us, no Benjamin can embitter your happiness on earth, no Patriarch can abrogate your claims and your father's to eternal bliss.  You have chosen well, boy! Your hand, my convert to the true faith!\"  And he held out his hand to Orion with glad excitement.  But the young man did not take it; he drew back a little and said rather uneasily:  \"Do not misunderstand me, great Captain.  Here is my hand, and I can know no greater honor than that of grasping yours, of wielding my sword under your command, of wearing it out in your service and in that of my lord the Khaliff; but I cannot be untrue to my faith.\"  \"Then be crushed by Benjamin--you and all your people!\"  cried Armu, disappointed and angry.  He waved his hand with a gesture of disgust and dismissal, and then turned to the Vekeel with a shrug, to answer the man's scornful exclamation.  Orion looked at them in dumb indecision; but he quickly collected himself, and said in a tone of modest but urgent entreaty:  \"Nay; hear me and do not reject my petition.  It could only be to my advantage to go over to you; and yet I can resist so great a temptation; but for that very reason I shall keep faith with you as I do to my religion.\"  \"Until the priests compel you to break it,\" interrupted the Arab roughly.  \"No, no!\"  cried Orion.  \"I know that Benjamin is my foe; but I have lost a beloved parent, and I believe in a meeting beyond the grave.\"  \"So do I,\" replied the Moslem.  \"And there is but one Paradise and one Hell, as there is but one God.\"  \"What gives you this conviction?\"  \"My faith.\"  \"Then forgive me if I cling to mine, and hope to see my father once more in that Heaven....\"  \"The heaven to which, as you fools believe, no souls but your own are admitted!  But supposing that it is open only to the immortal spirit of Moslems and closed against Christians?--What do you know of that Paradise?  I know your sacred Scriptures--Is it described in them?  But the All-merciful allowed our Prophet to look in, and what he saw he has described as though the Most High himself had guided his reed.  The Moslem knows what Heaven has to offer him,--but you?  Your Hell, you do know; your priests are more readier to curse than to bless.  If one of you deviates by one hair's breadth from their teaching they thrust him out forthwith to the abode of the damned.--Me and mine, the Greek Christians, and--take my word for it boy--first and foremost you and your father!\"  \"If only I were sure of finding him there!\"  cried Orion striking his breast.  \"I really should not fear to follow him.  I must meet him, must see him again, were it in Hell itself!\"  At these words the Vekeel burst into loud laughter, and when Amru reproved him sharply the negro retorted and a vehement dialogue ensued.  Obada's contumely had roused Orion's wrath; he was longing, burning to reduce this insolent antagonist to silence.  However, he contained himself by a supreme effort of will, till Amru turned to him once more and said in a reserved tone, but not unkindly:  \"This clear-sighted man has mentioned a suspicion which I myself had already felt.  A worldly-minded young Christian of your rank is not so ready to give up earthly joys and happiness for the doubtful bliss of your Paradise and when you do so and are prepared to forego all that a man holds most dear: Honor, temporal possessions, a wide field of action, and revenge on your enemies, to meet the spirit of the departed once more after death, there must be some special reason in the background.  Try to compose yourself, and believe my assurances that I like you and that you will find in me a zealous protector and a discreet friend if you will but tell me candidly and fully what are the motives of your conduct. I myself really desire that our interview should be fruitful of advantages on both sides.  So put your trust in a man so much your senior and your father's friend, and speak.\"  \"On no consideration in the presence of that man!\"  said Orion in a tremulous voice.  \"Though he is supposed not to understand Greek, he follows every word I say with malicious watchfulness; he dared to laugh at me, he. . .\"  \"He is as discreet as he is brave, and my Vekeel,\" interrupted Amru reprovingly.  \"If you join us you will have to obey him; and remember this, young man.  I sent for you to impose conditions on you, not to have them dictated to me.  I grant you an audience as the ruler of this country, as the Vicar of Omar, your Khaliff and mine.\"  \"Then I entreat you to dismiss me, for in the presence of that man my heart and lips are sealed; I feel that he is my enemy.\"  \"Beware of his becoming so!\"  cried the governor, while Obada shrugged his shoulders scornfully.  Orion understood this gesture, and although he again succeeded in keeping cool he felt that he could no longer be sure of himself; he bowed low, without paying any heed to the Vekeel, and begged Amru to excuse him for the present.  Amru, who had not failed to observe Obada's demeanor and who keenly sympathized with what was going on in the young man's mind, did not detain him; but his manner changed once more; he again became the pressing host and invited his guest, as it was growing late, to pass the night under his roof.  Orion politely declined, and when at length he quitted the room--without deigning even to look at the Negro--Amru accompanied him into the anteroom.  There he grasped the young man's hand, and said in a low voice full of sincere and fatherly interest:  \"Beware of the Negro; you let him perceive that you saw through him--it was brave but rash.  For my part I honestly wish you well.\"  \"I believe it, I know it,\" replied Orion, on whose perturbed soul the noble Arab's warm, deep accents fell like balm.  \"And now we are alone I will gladly confide in you.  I, my Lord, I--my father--you knew him. In cruel wrath, before he closed his eyes, he withdrew his blessing from his only son.\"  The memory of the most fearful hour of his life choked his voice for a moment, but he soon went on: \"One single act of criminal folly roused his anger; but afterwards, in grief and penitence, I thought over my whole life, and I saw how useless it had been; and now, when I came hither with a heart full of glad expectancy to place all I have to offer of mind and gifts at your disposal, I did so, my Lord, because I long to achieve great and noble, and difficult or, if it might be, impossible deeds--to be active, to be doing. . .\"  Here he was interrupted by Amru, who said, laying his sinewy arm across the youth's shoulders:  \"And because you long to let the spirit of your dead father, that righteous man, see that a heedless"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5522"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 06 (#6)"],["body"," of youthful recklessness has not made you unworthy of his blessing; because you hope by valiant deeds to compel his wrath to turn to approval, his scorn to esteem. . .\"  \"Yes, yes, that is the thing, the very thing!\"  Orion broke in with fiery enthusiasm; but the Arab eagerly signed to him to lower his voice, as though to cheat some listener, and whispered hastily, but with warm kindliness:  \"And I, I will help you in this praiseworthy endeavor.  Oh, how much you remind me of the son of my heart who, like you, erred, and who was permitted to atone for all, for more than all by dying like a hero for his faith on the field of battle!--Count on me, and let your purpose become deed.  In me you have found a friend.--Now, go.  You shall hear from me before long.  But, once more: Do not provoke the Negro; beware of him; and the next time you meet him subdue your pride and make as though you had never seen him before.\"  He looked sadly at Orion, as though the sight of him revived some loved image in his mind, kissed his brow, and as soon as the youth had left the anteroom he hastily drew open the curtain that hung across the door into the dining-room.--A few steps behind it stood the Vekeel, who was arranging the straps of his sword-belt.  \"Listener!\"  exclaimed the Arab with intense scorn, \"you, a man of gifts, a man of deeds!  A hero in battle and in council; lion, serpent, and toad in one!  When will you cast out of your soul all that is contemptible and base?  Be what you have made yourself, not what you were; do not constantly remind the man who helped you to rise that you were born of a slave!\"  \"My Lord!\"  began the Moor, and the whites of his rolling eyes were ominously conspicuous in his black face.  But Amru took the words out of his mouth and went on in stern and determined reproof:  \"You behaved to that noble youth like an idiot, like a buffoon at a fair, like a madman.\"  \"To Hell with him!\"  cried Obada, \"I hate the gilded upstart.\"  \"Envious wretch!  Do not provoke him!  Times change, and the day may come when you will have reason to fear him.\"  \"Him?\"  shrieked the other.  \"I could crush the puppet like a fly!  And he shall live to know it.\"  \"Your turn first and then his!\"  said Amru.  \"To us he is the more important of the two--yes, he, the up start, the puppet.  Do you hear? Do you understand?  If you touch a hair of his head, it will cost you your nose and ears!  Never for an hour forget that you live--and ought not to live--only so long as two pairs of lips are sealed.  You know whose.  That clever head remains on your shoulders only as long as they choose.  Cling to it, man; you have only one to lose!  It was necessary, my lord Vekeel, to remind you of that once more!\"  The Negro groaned like a wounded beast and sullenly panted out: \"This is the reward of past services; these are the thanks of Moslem to Moslem!-- And all for the sake of a Christian dog.\"  \"You have had thanks, and more than are your due,\" replied Amru more calmly.  \"You know what you pledged yourself to before I raised you to be my Vekeel for the sake of your brains and your sword, and what I had to overlook before I did so--not on your behalf, but for the great cause of Islam.  And, if you wish to remain where you are, you will do well to sacrifice your wild ambition.  If you cannot, I will send you back to the army, and to-day rather than to-morrow; and if you carry it with too high a hand you will find yourself at Medina in fetters, with your death- warrant stuck in your girdle.\"  The Negro again groaned sullenly; but his master was not to be checked.  \"Why should you hate this youth?  Why, a child could see through it! In the son and heir of George you see the future Mukaukas, while you are cherishing the insane wish to become the Mukaukas yourself.\"  \"And why should such a wish be insane?\"  cried the other in a harsh voice.  \"Putting you out of the question, who is there here that is shrewder or stronger than I?\"  \"No Moslem, perhaps.  But neither you nor any other true believer will succeed to the dead man's office, but an Egyptian and a Christian. Prudence requires it, and the Khaliff commands it.\"  \"And does he also command that this curled ape shall be left in possession of his millions?\"  \"So that is what you covet, you greedy curmudgeon--that is it?  Do not all the crimes you have committed out of avarice weigh upon you heavily enough?  Gold, and yet more gold--that is the end, the foul end, of all your desires.  A fat morsel, no doubt: the Mukaukas' estates, his talents of gold, his gems, slaves, and horses; I admit that.  But thank God the All-merciful, we are not thieves and robbers!\"  \"And who was it that dug out the hidden millions from beneath the reservoir of Peter the Egyptian, and who made him bite the dust?\"  \"I--I.  But--as you know--only to send the money to Medina.  Peter had hidden it before we killed him.  The Mukaukas and his son have declared all their possessions to the uttermost dinar and hide of land; they have faithfully paid the taxes, and consequently their property belongs to them as our swords, our horses, our wives belong to you or me.  What will not your grasping spirit lead you to!--Take your hand from your dagger!-- Not a copper coin from them shall fall into your hungry maw, so help me God!  Do not again cast an evil eye on the Mukaukas' son!  Do not try my patience too far, man, or else--Hold your head tight on your shoulders or you will have to seek it at your feet; and what I say I mean!--Now, good- night!  To-morrow morning in the divan you are to explain your scheme for the new distribution of the land; it will not suit me in any way, and I shall have other projects to propose for discussion.\"  With this the Arab turned his back on the Vekeel; but no sooner had the door closed on him than Obada clenched his fist in fury at his lord and master, who had hitherto said nothing of his having had purloined a portion of the consignment of gold which Amru had charged him to escort to Medina.  Then he rushed up and down the room, snorting and foaming till slaves came in to clear the tables.     CHAPTER XXV.  Orion made his way home under the moonlit and starry night.  He held his head high, and not since that evening on the water with Paula had he felt so glad or so hopeful.  On the other side of the bridge he did not at once turn his horse's head homewards; the fresh night air was so delightful, his heart beat so high that he shrunk from the oppression of a room.  Full of renewed life, freed from a burden as it were, he made his way at a round pace to the house that held his beloved, picturing to himself how gladly she would welcome the news that he had found Amru ready to encourage him in his projects, indeed, to be a fatherly friend.  The Arab general, whose lofty character, intellect, and rectitude his father had esteemed highly, had impressed him, too, as the ideal of noble manliness, and as he compared him with the highest officials and warriors he had met at the Court of Byzantium he could not help smiling.  By the side of this dignified, but impetuous and warm-hearted man they appeared like the old, rigid idols of his ancestors in comparison with the freely- wrought works of Greek art.  He could bless the memory of his father for having freed the land from that degenerate race.  Now, he felt, that lost parent, whose image lived in his soul, was satisfied with him, and this gave him a sense of happiness which he meant to cling to and enhance by every thought and deed in the future.  \"Life is a function, a ministry, and a duty!\"  this watchword, which had been given him by those beloved lips, should keep him in the new path; and soon he hoped to feel sure of himself, to be able to look back on such deeds of valor as would give him a right in his own judgment to unite his lot to that of this noblest of women.  Full of such thoughts as these, he made his way to the house of Rufinus. The windows of the corner room on the upper floor were lighted up; two of these windows looked out on the river and the quay.  He did not know which rooms were Paula's, but he looked up at the late-burning light with a vague feeling that it must be hers; a female figure which now appeared framed m the opening, showed him that he was not mistaken; it was that of Perpetua.  The sound of hoofs had roused her curiosity, but she did not seem to recognize him in the dim starlight.  He slowly rode past, and when he presently turned back and again looked up, in the hope this time of seeing Paula, the place was vacant: however, he perceived a tall dark shadow moving across from one side of the room to the other, which could not be that of the nurse nor of her slender mistress.  It must indeed be that of a remarkably big man, and stopping to gaze with anxious and unpleasant apprehension, he plainly recognized Philippus.  It was past midnight.  How could he account for his being with Paula at this hour?--Was she ill?--Was this room hers after all?--Was it merely by chance that the nurse was in Rufinus' room with the physician.  No.  The woman whom he could now see pass across the window and go straight up to the man, with outstretched hands, was Paula and none other.  Isis heart was already beating fast, and now a suspicion grew strong in him which his vanity had hitherto held in check, though he had often seen the friendly relations that subsisted between Paula and the leech.--Perhaps it was a warmer feeling than friendship and guileless trust, which had led her so unreservedly to claim this man's protection and service.  Could he have won Paula's heart--Paula's love?  Was it conceivable!--But why not?  What was there against Philippus but his homely face and humble birth? And how many a woman had he not seen set her heart on quite other things! The physician was not more than five years his senior; and recalling the expression in his eyes as he looked at Paula only that morning Orion felt more and more uneasy."]]]
