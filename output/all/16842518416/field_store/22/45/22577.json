But since he was born blind, how could the affliction have come as the result of his own sin? In only one way. If the man had had an existence before he was {51} born in the flesh, he might there have sinned. The Lord might then have punished him for his sin by causing him to be born blind.  Evidently, the disciples understood that there is a pre-existent state. But were they right? If they were not, surely Jesus would correct them. Listen. Jesus answered, \"Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\" Jesus, then, did not rebuke them. He, too, accepted the doctrine. At least, the affliction of blindness was not because of sin committed in the spirit world. And the works of God were truly made manifest in the miracle which Jesus then performed.  [Sidenote: Conclusion.]  From the teachings of Jesus, in the spirit and in the flesh, it is clear, then, that the spirits of all men existed in the spirit world long before they were born into bodies of flesh in this world; that the body of the spirit is like the mortal body in form; and that Jesus was chosen before the earth was organized to redeem mankind from sin.  \"We have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: Shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of Spirits, and live?\"  THE REFERENCES  Ether 3:4-16.

It is clear, from what we have learned, that Jesus had a very specific mission to perform on the earth. He did not come merely to display miraculous power. He came to save mankind--to teach them to know God and His commands, and to show them, further, how to keep the commands. And the wonderful thing about the mission of Jesus is that He was willing to suffer as no other man has ever suffered and finally to lay down His life in order to bring about the purpose of God.  And the great purpose of God in this world is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. For just as Jesus did not come merely to show how He could perform wonders, so God did not organize the earth and put living things upon it only to display His power. He had a far greater and higher purpose. That the purpose may be accomplished, man must learn to know God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.  [Sidenote: The problem of evil.]  Now, it may seem to you that, if God were so desirous of saving mankind that He was willing to give His only Begotten Son to accomplish the desire, He could have made it very easy for men to keep His commands. Indeed, He might have made His will the only possible thing to do. But it is not so. It is not ever really difficult to keep the commands of God if one sets his mind to keep them; but there are always so many other things {56} possible to do that one is tempted to neglect the word of God. Evil is always in the way. We wonder why there should be evil in the way, and how evil came to be. Men have wondered about the same thing for many ages. It would be so much easier to be good if there were no wrong. In this lesson, therefore, we want to learn how evil came into the world; in the next one, we shall learn why it is here.  [Sidenote: The parable of the sower.]  One day, when a great multitude of people had assembled about Him, Jesus related the parable of the sower. Said He, \"A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it. And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold....  [Sidenote: The meaning.]  \"Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. Those by the wayside are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good {57} heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.\"  [Sidenote: The devil the power of evil.]  It is the devil, then, who, in this world, is the power of evil. Directly or indirectly he gets between man and the path of duty. Although a man may know the way of righteousness, the devil tempts him to neglect it, or even to depart from it and to walk in the way of evil. But who is the devil? Whence did he get such power? How came he to be the devil?  [Sidenote: A council of the spirits.]  In the pre-existent state, of which we learned in the preceding lesson, all the spirits of men lived together in a world of spirits. It was there that they first heard of the plan of salvation--the Gospel. The plan was explained at a great meeting, or council, of the spirits. God Himself presented the plan to them, and showed them how, in order to carry out the plan, there would be needed a Savior--someone to perform the very mission that Jesus has actually performed for us. Then, when he had fully presented the Gospel plan, God asked, \"Whom shall I send?\"  [Sidenote: Jesus Volunteers.]  There was present at the council a spirit of supreme intelligence and humility. He was Immanuel, the Son of God. This spirit stepped forward and volunteered unselfishly, \"Father, here am I, send me. Thy will be done, and the glory be Thine forever.\"  [Sidenote: Lucifer volunteers.]  But there was present at the assembly a proud and haughty spirit named Lucifer, the Light-bringer, a Son of the Morning. Lucifer also volunteered, saying, \"Behold--here am I, {58} send me, I will be Thy son and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me Thine honor.\"  One can easily imagine that not only God, but the whole multitude of spirits also, must have been astounded at the selfishness and the arrogance of Lucifer. He was willing to try to save mankind--to force their salvation, in fact--but as reward he would thrust God from His throne, and claim for himself the honor and glory of God. It was as if he had said in his heart, \"I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.\"  [Sidenote: Lucifer rebels.]  It is no wonder, then, that God said simply, \"I will send the first.\" Naturally, Lucifer became angry, and rebelled against God, carrying with him one-third of the spirits of heaven. But in the war which followed, Lucifer and his host were defeated, and were cast out of heaven. \"And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto (God's) voice.\"  [Sidenote: The declaration of Jesus.]  That is how evil came into the world; and that is why Jesus said once to the Jews who rejected Him, \"If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and am come from God: neither came I of myself, but He sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode {59} not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.\"  THE REFERENCES  Luke 8:4-15. Isa. 14:12, 13.  Moses 4:1-4. Doc. and Cov. 29:36-38.  Abraham 3:27, 28.

You remember, that, when Jesus was grown to manhood He went to the river Jordan and was baptized by John. \"Then,\" we are told, \"was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He was afterward an hungered.\"  This was a very important and a critical moment in the history of the world. Jesus was about to begin the splendid ministry which was to culminate in His death on the cross for the redemption of the world. If He should succeed in His mission, the power of evil would be broken, and it would become possible for man to return to the presence of God. Of course, Satan was much disturbed at such a thought. He had gained such power on the earth that he had come to be called the prince of this world. It angered him to think that he might lose that power. In desperation, he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54292"],["title","What Jesus Taught (#7)"],["body","to try his strength with Jesus. If he could but bring about the downfall of the Son of God, God's plan would certainly be thwarted, and Satan might hope utterly to possess the earth. It was a wicked ambition; but it was in fulfillment of his mission among men. So Satan set about to tempt even the Only Begotten of the Father.  [Sidenote: The temptation of Jesus.]  \"And when the tempter came to Him (Jesus), he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But He (Jesus) answered and {62} said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Then the devil taketh Him up into the holy city, and setteth Him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto Him, If Thou be the Son of God, cast Thyself down: for it is written. He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee: and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and saith unto Him, All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written. Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth Him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto Him.\"  [Sidenote: The application.]  This impressive story of the strength and ultimate victory of innocence and purity is full of significance. In the performing of his mission of evil, Satan never stops with one kind of temptation alone. He attacks man at every point where weakness may lie. First he appealed to the appetites of the flesh. But though Jesus had fasted forty days and forty nights, and was hungry, yet He resisted the evil suggestion of the tempter. Then Satan appealed to the love of glory and the praise of men. But Jesus was content to wait, knowing that the glory and praise which would come to Him, from {63} honest and worthy endeavor, would be greater and far more lasting than that which might come from mere display. Finally, Satan appealed to the love of riches and power. But Jesus had the will and the strength to command him to depart; for the riches and the power gained through evil are necessarily but fleeting, whereas the blessings derived through the service of God endure forever. Thus did Jesus overcome the great temptation, and show all men how to resist evil.  [Sidenote: Guard against suggestions of the devil.]  You may readily understand, that because of His own experience, Jesus appreciated fully the tempting power of the devil. In the parable of the sower, you remember, Jesus urges men to guard against the suggestions of the devil. It is because of the hearkening to those suggestions that so much of the seed fails to bear fruit. And not only do those suggestions withhold men from good deeds, but they inspire evil thoughts and draw men into sin. There are in history many examples of this truth; but there is none more shocking than the example of Judas Iscariot, who betrayed the Christ to His enemies. \"When He (Jesus) had dipped the sop,\" we read in the Gospel of St. John, \"He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. And after the sop (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray Him) Satan entered into him.\" Judas had not the strength to resist the suggestions of the devil, and thus brought condemnation upon himself.  [Sidenote: Why there is evil.]  But you are still wondering why there is evil in the world. Why should even Jesus, the Christ, be subjected to temptation by the devil? Let us consider the source of our love and adoration of Jesus. If God had made it no trial {64} or task at all, but altogether pleasant, to redeem mankind, should we experience the affection and the worship that we now feel for Jesus? If He had not suffered; if He had experienced no pain; if He had passed through no agony of body nor anguish of heart, could we feel indebted to Him as we do now? If He had suffered no temptation, if it had never been a struggle for Him to do the right--as it was in Gethsemane--could we admire His strength, and profit by His teaching? In short, could the atoning death of Jesus be called a sacrifice, if there had been no suffering, no overcoming of temptation and evil? It was through overcoming that Jesus proved Himself worthy to be the Son of God.  [Sidenote: The trial of man.]  In just the same way, evil is put before man to tempt him, that he too may show his worthiness or unworthiness. We admire the boy who has the The trial of courage and the will-power to say No to the suggestion of evil. We recognize in him strength of character. We see in him a pillar of strength for the future. We are likely to despise the boy who always yields to temptation, who allows his character to be broken down by evil, and who finally becomes a slave to Satan. Such a boy is a weakling; he will be of little or of no service to the world.  [Sidenote: A state of probation.]  With these facts in mind, it is easy to understand the words of Jesus in the Spirit world. At the great council of the spirits--about which we have already learned--Jesus said to those around Him, \"We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these (spirits) may {65} dwell; and we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.\" And in our own dispensation, Jesus said to the Prophet, Joseph Smith, \"It must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves, for if they never should have bitter, they could not know the sweet.\"  [Sidenote: The free agency of man.]  Here of course lies the secret of the matter. God has endowed us with free agency. He does not try to force us to be good, but we may do good or evil as we ourselves please. And as we gain strength to overcome evil, we grow in character and in power, and become more nearly worthy to return to the presence of God. It was partly because he wanted to destroy the God-given free agency of man, that Lucifer was cast out of heaven. Only the person who sturdily and persistently resists temptation retains his free agency. He who yields to temptation becomes soon a servant to the devil, and loses the free agency with which God endowed him.  Through overcoming temptation and evil Jesus triumphed over the devil and redeemed the world. Through overcoming temptation and evil, man, too, may triumph over the devil, and have glory added upon his head for ever and ever. \"Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given unto them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil.\"  {66} THE REFERENCES  Matt. 4:1-11.

As He approached the day of the awful sacrifice, Jesus Himself declared to His followers, \"This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" And as God the Son manifested thus His great love, so also did God the Father. \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"  [Sidenote: Why should God be mindful of man?]  Now, it is only natural that one should ask, as did the great psalmist, \"What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man that Thou visitest him? Why should there be devised in the heavens a gracious and liberal plan of salvation? Why, because of man, should the hosts of heaven be plunged into the horrors of civil war? What is man, that the noblest of the spirits of heaven should lay down His life for man's redemption? It is an answer to these questions that we want now to find in the teachings of Jesus.  [Sidenote: The parable of the lost sheep.]  {70} One day when the publicans and the sinners drew near to Jesus to hear Him, \"the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. And He spake this parable unto them, saying, \"What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.\"  [Sidenote: Man's "]]]
