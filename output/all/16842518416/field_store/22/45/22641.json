If I were only as young as Paaker!  You laugh at the sighs of a man--say at once of an old man!  Well, yes, I am old, for the prime of life lies behind me.  And yet Katuti, my friend, wisest of women--explain to me one thing.  When I was young I was loved by many and admired many women, but not one of them--not even my wife, who died young, was more to me than a toy, a plaything; and now when I stretch out my hand for a girl, whose father I might very well be--not for her own sake, but simply to serve my purpose--and she refuses me, I feel as much disturbed, as much a fool as- as that dealer in love-philters, Paaker.\"  \"Have you spoken to Bent-Anat?\"  asked Katuti.  \"And heard again from her own lips the refusal she had sent me through you.  You see my spirit has suffered!\"  \"And on what pretext did she reject your suit?\"  asked the widow.  \"Pretext!\"  cried Ani.  \"Bent-Anat and pretext!  It must be owned that she has kingly pride, and not Ma--[The Goddess of Truth]--herself is more truthful than she.  That I should have to confess it!  When I think of her, our plots seem to me unutterably pitiful.  My veins contain, indeed, many drops of the blood of Thotmes, and though the experience of life has taught me to stoop low, still the stooping hurts me.  I have never known the happy feeling of satisfaction with my lot and my work; for I have always had a greater position than I could fill, and constantly done less than I ought to have done.  In order not to look always resentful, I always wear a smile.  I have nothing left of the face I was born with but the mere skin, and always wear a mask.  I serve him whose master I believe I ought to be by birth; I hate Rameses, who, sincerely or no, calls me his brother; and while I stand as if I were the bulwark of his authority I am diligently undermining it.  My whole existence is a lie.\"  \"But it will be truth,\" cried Katuti, \"as soon as the Gods allow you to be--as you are--the real king of this country.\"  \"Strange!\"  said Ani smiling, Ameni,  this  very day, used almost exactly the same words.  The wisdom of priests, and that of women, have much in common, and they fight with the same weapons.  You use words instead of swords, traps instead of lances, and you cast not our bodies, but our souls, into irons.\"  \"Do you blame or praise us for it?\"  said the widow.  \"We are in any case not impotent allies, and therefore, it seems to me, desirable ones.\"  Indeed you are,\" said Ani smiling.  \"Not a tear is shed in the land, whether it is shed for joy or for sorrow, for which in the first instance a priest or a woman is not responsible.  Seriously, Katuti--in nine great events out of ten you women have a hand in the game.  You gave the first impulse to all that is plotting here, and I will confess to you that, regardless of all consequences, I should in a few hours have given up my pretensions to the throne, if that woman Bent-Anat had said 'yes' instead of 'no.'\"  \"You make me believe,\" said  Katuti, \"that the weaker sex are gifted with stronger wills than the nobler.  In marrying us you style us, 'the mistress of the house,' and if the elders of the citizens grow infirm, in this country it is not the sons but the daughters that must be their mainstay.  But we women have our weaknesses, and chief of these is curiosity.--May I ask on what ground Bent-Anat dismissed you?\"  \"You know so much that you may know all,\" replied Ani.  \"She admitted me to speak to her alone.  It was yet early, and she had come from the temple, where the weak old prophet had absolved her from uncleanness; she met me, bright, beautiful and proud, strong and radiant as a Goddess, and a princess.  My heart throbbed as if I were a boy, and while she was showing me her flowers I said to myself:  'You are come to obtain through her another claim to the throne.'  And yet I felt that, if she consented to be mine, I would remain the true brother, the faithful Regent of Rameses, and enjoy happiness and peace by her side before it was too late.  If she refused me then I resolved that fate must take its way, and, instead of peace and love, it must be war for the crown snatched from my fathers.  I tried to woo her, but she cut my words short, said I was a noble man, and a worthy suitor but--\"  \"There came the but.\"  \"Yes--in the form of a very frank 'no.'  I asked her reasons.  She begged me to be content with the 'no;' then I pressed her harder, till she interrupted me, and owned with proud decision that she preferred some one else.  I wished to learn the name of the happy man--that she refused. Then my blood began to boil, and my desire to win her increased; but I had to leave her, rejected, and with a fresh, burning, poisoned wound in my heart.\"  \"You are jealous!\"  said Katuti, \"and do you know of whom?\"  \"No,\" replied Ani.  \"But I hope to find out through you.  What I feel it is impossible for me to express.  But one thing I know, and that is this, that I entered the palace a vacillating man--that I left it firmly resolved.  I now rush straight onwards, never again to turn back.  From this time forward you will no longer have to drive me onward, but rather to hold me back; and, as if the Gods had meant to show that they would stand by me, I found the high-priest Ameni, and the chief pioneer Paaker waiting for me in my house.  Ameni will act for me in Egypt, Paaker in Syria.  My victorious troops from Ethiopia will enter Thebes to-morrow morning, on their return home in triumph, as if the king were at their head, and will then take part in the Feast of the Valley.  Later we will send them into the north, and post them in the fortresses which protect Egypt against enemies coming from the east Tanis, Daphne, Pelusium, Migdol.  Rameses, as you know, requires that we should drill the serfs of the temples, and send them to him as auxiliaries.  I will send him half of the body-guard, the other half shall serve my own purposes.  The garrison of Memphis, which is devoted to Rameses, shall be sent to Nubia, and shall be relieved by troops that are faithful to me.  The people of Thebes are led by the priests, and tomorrow Ameni will point out to them who is their legitimate king, who will put an end to the war and release them from taxes.  The children of Rameses will be excluded from the solemnities, for Ameni, in spite of the chief-priest of Anion, still pronounces Bent-Anat unclean.  Young Rameri has been doing wrong and Ameni, who has some other great scheme in his mind, has forbidden him the temple of Seti; that will work on the crowd!  You know how things are going on in Syria: Rameses has suffered much at the hands of the Cheta and their allies; whole legions are weary of eternally lying in the field, and if things came to extremities would join us; but, perhaps, especially if Paaker acquits himself well, we may be victorious without fighting.  Above all things now we must act rapidly.\"  \"I no longer recognize the timid, cautious lover of delay!\"  exclaimed Katuti.  \"Because now prudent hesitation would be want of prudence,\" said Ani.  \"And if the king should get timely information as to what is happening here?\"  said Katuti.  \"I said so!\"  exclaimed Ani; \"we are exchanging parts.\"  \"You are mistaken,\" said Katuti.  \"I also am for pressing forwards; but I would remind you of a necessary precaution.  No letters but yours must reach the camp for the next few weeks.\"  \"Once more you and the priests are of one mind,\" said Ani laughing; 'for Ameni gave me the same counsel.  Whatever letters are sent across the frontier between Pelusium and the Red Sea will be detained.  Only my letters--in which I complain of the piratical sons of the desert who fall upon the messengers--will reach the king.\"  \"That is wise,\" said the widow; \"let the seaports of the Red Sea be watched too, and the public writers.  When you are king, you can distinguish those who are affected for or against you.\"  Ani shook his head and replied:  \"That would put me in a difficult position; for it I were to punish those who are now faithful to their king, and exalt the others, I should have to govern with unfaithful servants, and turn away the faithful ones.  You need not color, my kind friend, for we are kin, and my concerns are yours.\"  Katuti took the hand he offered her and said:  \"It is so.  And I ask no further reward than to see my father's house once more in the enjoyment of its rights.\"  \"Perhaps we shall achieve it,\" said Ani; \"but in a short time if--if-- Reflect, Katuti; try to find out, ask your daughter to help you to the utmost.  Who is it that she--you know whom I mean--Who is it that Bent- Anat loves?\"  The widow started, for Ani had spoken the last words with a vehemence very foreign to his usual courtliness, but soon she smiled and repeated to the Regent the names of the few young nobles who had not followed the king, and remained in Thebes.  \"Can it be Chamus?\"  at last she said, \"he is at the camp, it is true, but nevertheless--\"  At this instant Nemu, who had not lost a word of the conversation, came in as if straight from the garden and said:  \"Pardon me, my lady; but I have heard a strange thing.\"  \"Speak,\" said Katuti.  The high and mighty princess Bent-Anat, the daughter of Rameses, is said to have an open love-affair with a young priest of the House of Seti.\"  \"You barefaced scoundrel!\"  exclaimed Ani, and his eyes sparkled with rage.  \"Prove what you say, or you lose your tongue.\"  \"I am willing to lose it as a slanderer and traitor according to the law,\" said the little man abjectly, and yet with a malicious laugh; \"but this time I shall keep it, for I can vouch for what I say.  You both know that Bent-Anat was pronounced unclean because she stayed for an hour and more in the house of a paraschites.  She had an assignation there with the priest.  At a second, in the temple of Hatasu, they were surprised by Septah, the chief of the haruspices of the House of Seti.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5444"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 06 (#3)"],["body","  \"Who is the priest?\"  asked Ani with apparent calmness.  \"A low-born man,\" replied Nemu, \"to whom a free education was given at the House of Seti, and who is well known as a verse-maker and interpreter of dreams.  His name is Pentaur, and it certainly must be admitted that he is handsome and dignified.  He is line for line the image of the pioneer Paaker's late father.  Didst thou ever see him, my lord?\"  The Regent looked gloomily at the floor and nodded that he had.  But Katuti cried out; \"Fool that I am! the dwarf is right!  I saw how she blushed when her brother told her how the boys had rebelled on his account against Ameni. It is Pentaur and none other!\"  \"Good!\"  said Ani, \"we will see.\"  With these words he took leave of Katuti, who, as he disappeared in the garden, muttered to herself: \"He was wonderfully clear and decided to-day; but jealousy is already blinding him and will soon make him feel that he cannot get on without my sharp eyes.\"  Nemu had slipped out after the Regent.  He called to him from behind a fig-tree, and hastily whispered, while he bowed with deep respect:  \"My mother knows a great deal, most noble highness!  The sacred Ibis       [Ibis religiosa.  It has disappeared from Egypt  There were two      varieties of this bird, which was sacred to Toth, and mummies of      both have been found in various places.  Elian states that an      immortal Ibis was shown at Hermopolis.  Plutarch says, the ibis      destroys poisonous reptiles, and that priests draw the water for      their purifications where the Ibis has drunk, as it will never touch      unwholesome water.]  wades through the fen when it goes in search of prey, and why shouldst thou not stoop to pick up gold out of the dust?  I know how thou couldst speak with the old woman without being seen.\"  \"Speak,\" said Ani.  \"Throw her into prison for a day, hear what she has to say, and then release her--with gifts if she is of service to you--if not, with blows. But thou wilt learn something important from her that she obstinately refused to tell me even.\"  \"We will see!\"  replied the Regent.  He threw a ring of gold to the dwarf and got into his chariot.  So large a crowd had collected in the vicinity of the palace, that Ani apprehended mischief, and ordered his charioteer to check the pace of the horses, and sent a few police-soldiers to the support of the out-runners; but good news seemed to await him, for at the gate of the castle he heard the unmistakable acclamations of the crowd, and in the palace court he found a messenger from the temple of Seti, commissioned by Ameni to communicate to him and to the people, the occurrence of a great miracle, in that the heart of the ram of Anion, that had been torn by wolves, had been found again within the breast of the dead prophet Rui.  Ani at once descended from his chariot, knelt down before all the people, who followed his example, lifted his arms to heaven, and praised the Gods in a loud voice.  When, after some minutes, he rose and entered the palace, slaves came out and distributed bread to the crowd in Ameni's name.  \"The Regent has an open hand,\" said a joiner to his neighbor; \"only look how white the bread is.  I will put it in my pocket and take it to the children.\"  \"Give me a bit!\"  cried a naked little scamp, snatching the cake of bread from the joiner's hand and running away, slipping between the legs of the people as lithe as a snake.  \"You crocodile's brat!\"  cried his victim.  \"The insolence of boys gets worse and worse every day.\"  \"They are hungry,\" said the woman apologetically.  \"Their fathers are gone to the war, and the mothers have nothing for their children but papyrus-pith and lotus-seeds.\"  \"I hope they enjoy it,\" laughed the joiner.  \"Let us push to the left; there is a man with some more bread.\"  \"The Regent must rejoice greatly over the miracle,\" said a shoemaker. \"It is costing him something.\"  \"Nothing like it has happened for a long time,\" said a basket-maker. \"And he is particularly glad it should be precisely Rui's body, which the sacred heart should have blessed.  You ask why?--Hatasu is Ani's ancestress, blockhead!\"  \"And Rui was prophet of the temple of Hatasu,\" added the joiner.  \"The priests over there are all hangers-on of the old royal house, that I know,\" asserted a baker.  \"That's no secret!\"  cried the cobbler.  \"The old times were better than these too.  The war upsets everything, and quite respectable people go barefoot because they cannot pay for shoe-leather.  Rameses is a great warrior, and the son of Ra, but what can he do without the Gods; and they don't seem to like to stay in Thebes any longer; else why should the heart of the sacred ram seek a new dwelling in the Necropolis, and in the breast of an adherent of the old--\"  \"Hold your tongue,\" warned the basket-maker.  \"Here comes one of the watch.\"  \"I must go back to work,\" said the baker.  \"I have my hands quite full for the feast to-morrow.\"  \"And I too,\" said the shoemaker with a sigh, \"for who would follow the king of the Gods through the Necropolis barefoot.\"  \"You must earn a good deal,\" cried the basket-maker.  \"We should do better if we had better workmen,\" replied the shoemaker, \"but all the good hands are gone to the war.  One has to put up with stupid youngsters.  And as for the women!  My wife must needs have a new gown for the procession, and bought necklets for the children.  Of course we must honor the dead, and they repay it often by standing by us when we want it--but what I pay for sacrifices no one can tell.  More than half of what I earn goes in them--\"  \"In the first grief of losing my poor wife,\" said the baker, \"I promised a small offering every new moon, and a greater one every year.  The priests will not release us from our vows, and times get harder and harder.  And my dead wife owes me a grudge, and is as thankless as she was is her lifetime; for when she appears to me in a dream she does not give me a good word, and often torments me.\"  \"She is now a glorified all-seeing spirit,\" said the basket-maker's wife, \"and no doubt you were faithless to her.  The glorified souls know all that happens, and that has happened on earth.\"  The baker cleared his throat, having no answer ready; but the shoemaker exclaimed:  \"By Anubis, the lord of the under-world, I hope I may die before my old woman! for if she finds out down there all I have done in this world, and if she may be changed into any shape she pleases, she will come to me every night, and nip me like a crab, and sit on me like a mountain.\"  \"And if you die first,\" said the woman, \"she will follow you afterwards to the under-world, and see through you there.\"  \"That will be less dangerous,\" said the shoemaker laughing, \"for then I shall be glorified too, and shall know all about her past life.  That will not all be white paper either, and if she throws a shoe at me I will fling the last at her.\"  \"Come home,\" said the basket-maker's wife, pulling her husband away. \"You are getting no good by hearing this talk.\"  The bystanders laughed, and the baker exclaimed:  \"It is high time I should be in the Necropolis before it gets dark, and see to the tables being laid for to-morrow's festival.  My trucks are close to the narrow entrance to the valley.  Send your little ones to me, and I will give them something nice.  Are you coming over with me?\"  \"My younger brother is gone over with the goods,\" replied the shoemaker. \"We have plenty to do still for the customers in Thebes, and here am I standing gossiping.  Will the wonderful heart of the sacred ram be exhibited to-morrow do you know?\"  \"Of course--no doubt,\" said the baker, \"good-bye, there go my cases!\"     CHAPTER XXVI.  Notwithstanding the advanced hour, hundreds of people were crossing over to the Necropolis at the same time as the baker.  They were permitted to linger late on into the evening, under the inspection of the watch, because it was the eve of the great feast, and they had to set out their counters and awnings, to pitch their tents, and to spread out their wares; for as soon as the sun rose next day all business traffic would be stopped, none but festal barges might cross from Thebes, or such boats as ferried over pilgrims--men, women, and children whether natives or foreigners, who were to take part in the great procession.  In the halls and work-rooms of the House of Seti there was unusual stir. The great miracle of the wonderful heart had left but a short time for the preparations for the festival.  Here a chorus was being practised, there on the sacred lake a scenic representation was being rehearsed; here the statues of the Gods were being cleaned and dressed,       [The dressing and undressing of the holy images was conducted in      strict accordance with a prescribed ritual.  The inscriptions in the      seven sanctuaries of Abydos, published by Alariette, are full of      instruction as to these ordinances, which were significant in every      detail.]  and the colors of the sacred emblems were being revived, there the panther-skins and other parts of the ceremonial vestments of the priests were being aired and set out; here sceptres, censers and other metal- vessels were being cleaned, and there the sacred bark which was to be carried in the procession was being decorated.  In the sacred groves of the temple the school-boys, under the direction of the gardeners, wove garlands and wreaths to decorate the landing-places, the sphinxes, the temple, and the statues of the Gods.  Flags were hoisted on the brass- tipped masts in front of the pylon, and purple sails were spread to give shadow to the court.  The inspector of sacrifices was already receiving at a side-door the cattle, corn and fruit, offerings which were brought as tribute to the House of Seti, by citizens from all parts of the country, on the occasion of the festival of the Valley, and he was assisted by scribes, who kept an account of all that was brought in by the able-bodied"]]]
