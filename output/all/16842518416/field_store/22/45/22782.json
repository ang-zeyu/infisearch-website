Besides, she was confused by the angry emotion which the sight of Iras awakened.  Twice, thrice she strove to utter a few words of explanation, defence, but her voice refused to obey her will.  When Charmian at last approached to encourage her, it was too late; the indignant Queen had turned away, exclaiming to Iras: \"let her be taken back to Lochias.  Her guilt is proved; but it does not become the injured person, the accuser, to award the punishment.  This must be left to the judges before whom we will bring her.\"  Then Barine once more recovered the power of speech.  How dared Cleopatra assert that she was convicted of a crime, without hearing her defence?  As surely as she felt her own innocence she must succeed in proving it, and with this consciousness she cried out to the Queen in a tone of touching entreaty: \"O your Majesty, do not leave me without hearing me! As truly as I believe in your justice, I can ask you to listen to me once more.  Do not give me up to the woman who hates me because the man whom she--\"  Here Cleopatra interrupted her.  Royal dignity forbade her to hear one woman's jealous accusation of another, but, with the subtle discernment with which women penetrate one another's moods, she heard in Barine's piteous appeal a sincere conviction that she was too severely condemned. Doubtless she also had reason to believe in Iras's hate, and Cleopatra knew how mercilessly she pursued those who had incurred her displeasure. She had rejected and still shuddered at her advice to remove the singer from her path; for an inner voice warned her not to burden her soul now with a fresh crime, which would disturb its peace.  Besides, she had at first been much attracted by this charming, winning creature; but the irritating thought that Antony had bestowed the same gift upon the sovereign and the artist's daughter still so incensed her, that it taxed to the utmost her graciousness and self-control as, without addressing any special person, she exclaimed, glancing back into the hall: \"This examination will be followed by another.  When the time comes, the accused must appear before the judges; therefore she must remain at Lochias and in custody.  It is my will that no harm befalls her.  You are her friend, Charmian.  I will place her in your charge.  Only\"--here she raised her voice--\"on pain of my anger, do not allow her by any possibility to leave the palace, even for a moment, or to hold intercourse with any person save yourself.\"  With these words she passed out of the hall and went into her own apartments.  She had turned the night into day, not only to despatch speedily matters which seemed to her to permit of no delay, but even more because, since the battle of Actium, she dreaded the restless hours upon her lonely couch.  They seemed endless; and though before she had remembered with pleasure the unprecedented display and magnificence with which she had surrounded her love-life with Antony, she now in these hours reproached herself for having foolishly squandered the wealth of her people.  The present appeared unbearable, and from the future a host of black cares pressed upon her.  The following days were overcrowded with business details.  Half of her nights were spent in the observatory.  She had not asked again for Barine.  On the fifth night she permitted Alexas to conduct her once more to the little observatory which had been erected for her father at Lochias, and Antony's favourite knew how to prove that a star which had long threatened her planet was that of the woman whom she seemed to have forgotten as completely as she had ignored his former warning against this very foe.  The Queen denied this, but Alexas eagerly continued: \"The night after your return home your kindness was again displayed in its inexhaustible and--to us less noble souls--incomprehensible wealth.  Deeply agitated, we watched during the memorable examination the touching spectacle of the greatest heart making itself the standard by which to measure what is petty and ignoble.  But ere the second trial takes place the wanderers above, who know the future, bid me warn you once more; for that woman's every look was calculated, every word had its fixed purpose, every tone of her voice was intended to produce a certain effect.  Whatever she said or may yet say had no other design than to deceive my royal mistress.  As yet there have been no definite questions and answers.  But you will have her examined, and then----What may she not make of the story of Mark Antony, Barine, and the two armlets?  Perhaps it will be a masterpiece.\"  \"Do you know its real history?\" asked Cleopatra, clasping her fingers more closely around the pencil in her hand.  \"If I did,\" replied Alexas, smiling significantly, \"the receiver of stolen goods should not betray the thief.\"  \"Not even if the person who has been robbed--the Queen--commands you to give up the dishonestly acquired possession?\"  \"Unfortunately, even then I should be forced to withhold obedience; for consider, my royal mistress, there are but two great luminaries around which my dark life revolves.  Shall I betray the moon, when I am sure of gaining nothing thereby save to dim the warm light of the sun?\"  \"That means that your revelations would wound me, the sun?\"  \"Unless your lofty soul is too great to be reached by shadows which surround less noble women with an atmosphere of indescribable torture.\"  \"Do you intend to render your words more attractive by the veil with which you shroud them?  It is transparent, and dims the vision very little.  My soul, you think, should be free from jealousy and the other weaknesses of my sex.  There you are mistaken.  I am a woman, and wish to remain one.  As Terence's Chremes says he is a human being, and nothing human is unknown to him, I do not hesitate to confess all feminine frailties.  Anubis told me of a queen in ancient times who would not permit the inscriptions to record 'she,' but 'he came,' or 'he, the ruler, conquered.'  Fool!  Whatever concerns me, my womanhood is not less lofty than the crown.  I was a woman ere I became Queen.  The people prostrate themselves before my empty litters; but when, in my youth, I wandered in disguise with Antony through the city streets and visited some scene of merrymaking, while the men gazed admiringly at me, and we heard voices behind us murmur, 'A  handsome couple!'  I returned home full of joy and pride.  But there was something greater still for the woman to learn, when the heart in the breast of the Queen forgot throne and sceptre and, in the hours consecrated to Eros, tasted joys known to womanhood alone.  How can you men, who only command and desire, understand the happiness of sacrifice?  I am a woman; my birth does not exalt me above any feeling of my sex; and what I now ask is not as Queen but as woman.\"  \"If that is the case,\" Alexas answered with his hand upon his heart, \"you impose silence upon me; for were I to confess to the woman Cleopatra what agitates my soul, I should be guilty of a double crime--I would violate a promise and betray the friend who confided his noble wife to my protection.\"  \"Now the darkness is becoming too dense for me,\" replied Cleopatra, raising her head with repellent pride.  \"Or, if I choose to raise the veil, I must point out to you the barriers--  \"Which surround the Queen,\" replied the Syrian with an obsequious bow. \"There you behold the fact.  It is an impossibility to separate the woman from the princess.  So far as I am concerned, I do not wish to anger the former against the presumptuous adorer, and I desire to yield to the latter the obedience which is her due.  Therefore I entreat you to forget the armlet and its many painful associations, and pass to the consideration of other matters.  Perhaps the fair Barine will voluntarily confess everything, and even add how she managed to ensnare the amiable son of the greatest of men, and the most admirable of mothers, the young King Caesarion.\"  Cleopatra's eyes flashed more brightly, and she angrily exclaimed: \"I found the boy just now as though he were possessed by demons.  He was ready to tear the bandage from his wound, if he were refused the woman whom he loved.  A magic potion was the first thought, and his tutor of course attributes everything to magic arts.  Charmian, on the contrary, declares that his visits annoyed and even alarmed Barine.  Nothing except a rigid investigation can throw light upon this subject.  We will await the Imperator's return.  Do you think that he will again seek the singer? You are his most trusted confidant.  If you desire his best good, and care for my favour, drop your hesitation and answer this question.\"  The Syrian assumed the manner of a man who had reached a decision, and answered firmly: \"Certainly he will, unless you prevent him.  The simplest way would be--\"  \"Well?\"  \"To inform him, as soon as he lands, that she is no longer to be found. I should be especially happy to receive this commission from my royal sun.\"  \"And do you think it would dim the light of your moon a little, were he to seek her here in vain?\"  \"As surely as that the contrary would be the case if he were always as gratefully aware of the peerless brilliancy of his sun as it deserves. Helios suffers no other orb to appear so long as he adorns the heavens. His lustre quenches all the rest.  Let my sun so decree, and Barine's little star will vanish.\"  \"Enough!  I know your aim now.  But a human life is no small thing, and this woman, too, is the child of a mother.  We must consider, earnestly consider, whether our purpose cannot be gained without proceeding to extremes.  This must be done with zeal and a kindly intention--But I-- Now, when the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5477"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 05 (#5)"],["body","of this country, my own, and the children's is hanging in the balance, when I have not fifteen minutes at my command, and there is no end of writing and consulting, I can waste no time on such matters.\"  \"The reflective mind must be permitted to use its mighty wings unimpeded,\" cried the Syrian eagerly.  \"Leave the settlement of minor matters to trustworthy friends.\"  Here they were  interrupted  by  the \"introducer,\" who announced the eunuch Mardion.  He had come on business which, spite of the late hour, permitted no delay.  Alexas accompanied the Queen to the tablinum, where they found the eunuch.  A slave attended him, carrying a pouch filled with letters which had just been brought by two messengers from Syria.  Among them were some which must be answered without delay.  The Keeper of the Seal and the Exegetus were also waiting.  Their late visit was due to the necessity of holding a conference in relation to the measures to be adopted to calm the excited citizens.  All the galleys which had escaped from the battle had entered the harbour the day before, wreathed with garlands as if a great victory had been won.  Loud acclamations greeted them, yet tidings of the defeat at Actium spread with the swiftness of the wind.  Crowds were now gathering, threatening demonstrations had been made in front of the Sebasteum, and on the square of the Serapeum the troops had been compelled to interfere, and blood had flowed.  There lay the letters.  Zeno remarked that more papers conferring authority were required for the work on the canal, and the Exegetus earnestly besought definite instruction.  \"It is much--much,\"  murmured  Cleopatra.  Then, drawing herself up to her full height, she exclaimed, \"Well, then, to work!\"  But Alexas did not permit her to do this at once.  Humbly advancing as she took her seat at the large writing-table, he whispered: \"And with all this, must my royal mistress devote time and thought to the destroyer of her peace.  To disturb your Majesty with this trifle is a crime; yet it must be committed, for should the affair remain unheeded longer, the trickling rivulet may become a mountain torrent--\"  Here Cleopatra, whose glance had just rested upon a fateful letter from King Herod, turned her face half towards her husband's favourite, exclaiming curtly, with glowing cheeks, \"Presently.\"  \"Then she glanced rapidly over the letter, pushed it excitedly aside, and dismissed the waiting Syrian with the impatient words: \"Attend to the trial and the rest.  No injustice, but no untimely mildness.  I will look into this unpleasant matter myself before the Imperator returns.\"  \"And the authority?\"  asked the Syrian, with another low bow.  \"You have it.  If you need a written one, apply to Zeno.  We will discuss the affair further at some less busy hour.\"  The Syrian retired; but Cleopatra turned to the eunuch and, flushed with emotion, cried, pointing to the King of Judea's letter:  \"Did you ever witness baser ingratitude?  The rats think the ship is sinking, and it is time to leave it.  If we succeed in keeping above water, they will return in swarms; and this must, must, must be done, for the sake of this beloved country and her independence.  Then the children, the children! All our powers must now be taxed, every expedient must be remembered and used.  We will hammer each feeble hope until it becomes the strong steel of certainty.  We will transform night into day.  The canal will save the fleet.  Mark Antony will find in Africa Pinarius Scarpus with untouched loyal legions.  The gladiators are faithful to us.  We can easily make them ours, and my brain is seething with other plans.  But first we will attend to the Alexandrians.  No violence!\"  This exclamation was followed by order after order, and the promise that, if necessary, she would show herself to the people.  The Exegetus was filled with admiration as he received the clear, sagacious directions.  After he had retired with his companions, the Queen again turned to the Regent, saying: \"We did wisely to make the people happy at first with tidings of victory.  The unexpected news of terrible disaster might have led them to some unprecedented deed of madness.  Disappointment is a more common pain, for which less powerful remedies will suffice.  Besides, many things could be arranged ere they knew that I was here.  How much we have accomplished already, Mardion! But I have not even granted myself the joy of seeing my children.  I was forced to defer the pleasure of the companionship of my oldest friends, even Archibius.  When he comes again he will be admitted.  I have given the order.  He knows Rome thoroughly.  I must hear his opinion of pending negotiations.\"  She shivered as she spoke, and pressing her hand upon her brow, exclaimed: \"Octavianus victor, Cleopatra vanquished!  I, who was everything to Caesar, beseeching mercy from his heir.  I, a petitioner to Octavia's brother!  Yet, no, no!  There are still a hundred chances of avoiding the horrible doom.  But whoever wishes to compel the field to bear fruits must dig sturdily, draw the buckets from the well, plough, and sow the seed.  To work, then, to work!  When Antony returns he must find all things ready.  The first success will restore his lost energy. I glanced through yonder letter while talking with the Exegetus; now I will dictate the answer.\"  So she sat reading, writing, and dictating, listening, answering, and giving orders, until the east brightened with the approach of dawn, the morning star grew pale, and the Regent, utterly exhausted, entreated her to consider her own health and his years, and permit him a few hours' rest.  Then she, too, allowed herself to be led into her darkened chamber, and this time a friendly, dreamless slumber closed her weary eyes and held her captive until roused by the loud shouts of the multitude, who had heard of the Queen's return and flocked to Lochias.
