When the Pleiades had risen, Nebenchari was to be found seated alone in one of the magnificent rooms assigned to his use on the eastern side of the palace, near to Kassandane's apartments.  The friendly manner in which he had welcomed his old servant had given place to the serious expression which his face usually wore, and which had led the cheerful Persians to call him a morose and gloomy man.  Nebenchari was an Egyptian priest through and through; a member of that caste which never indulged in a jest, and never for a moment forgot to be dignified and solemn before the public; but when among their relations and their colleagues completely threw off this self-imposed restraint, and gave way at times even to exuberant mirth.  Though he had known Phanes in Sais, he received him with cold politeness, and, after the first greeting was ended, told Hib to leave them alone.  \"I have come to you,\" said the Athenian, \"to speak about some very important affairs.\"  \"With which I am already acquainted,\" was the Egyptian's curt reply.  \"I am inclined to doubt that,\" said Phanes with an incredulous smile.  \"You have been driven out of Egypt, persecuted and insulted by Psamtik, and you have come to Persia to enlist Cambyses as an instrument of revenge against my country.\"  \"You are mistaken.  I have nothing against your country, but all the more against Amasis and his house.  In Egypt the state and the king are one, as you very well know.\"  \"On the contrary, my own observations have led me to think that the priests considered themselves one with the state.\"  \"In that case you are better informed than I, who have always looked on the kings of Egypt as absolute.  So they are; but only in proportion as they know how to emancipate themselves from the influence of your caste. --Amasis himself submits to the priests now.\"  \"Strange intelligence!\"  \"With which, however, you have already long been made acquainted.\"  \"Is that your opinion?\"  \"Certainly it is.  And I know with still greater certainty that once--you hear me--once, he succeeded in bending the will of these rulers of his to his own.\"  \"I very seldom hear news from home, and do not understand what you are speaking of.\"  \"There I believe you, for if you knew what I meant and could stand there quietly without clenching your fist, you would be no better than a dog who only whimpers when he's kicked and licks the hand that torments him.\"  The physician turned pale.  \"I know that Amasis has injured and insulted me,\" he said, \"but at the same time I must tell you that revenge is far too sweet a morsel to be shared with a stranger.\"  \"Well said!  As to my own revenge, however, I can only compare it to a vineyard where the grapes are so plentiful, that I am not able to gather them all myself.\"  \"And you have come hither to hire good laborers.\"  \"Quite right, and I do not even yet give up the hope of securing you to take a share in my vintage.\"  \"You are mistaken.  My work is already done.  The gods themselves have taken it in hand.  Amasis has been severely enough punished for banishing me from country, friends and pupils into this unclean land.\"  \"You mean by his blindness perhaps?\"  \"Possibly.\"  \"Then you have not heard that Petammon, one of your colleagues, has succeeded in cutting the skin, which covered the pupil of the eye and so restoring Amasis' sight?\"  The Egyptian started and ground his teeth; recovered his presence of mind, however, in a moment, and answered: \"Then the gods have punished the father through the children.\"  \"In what way?  Psamtik suits his father's present mood very well.  It is true that Tachot is ill, but she prays and sacrifices with her father all the more for that; and as to Nitetis, you and I both know that her death will not touch him very closely.\"  \"I really do not understand you.\"  \"Of course not, so long as you fancy that I believe your beautiful patient to be Amasis' daughter.\"  The Egyptian started again, but Phanes went on without appearing to notice his emotion: \"I know more than you suppose.  Nitetis is the daughter of Hophra, Amasis' dethroned predecessor.  Amasis brought her up as his own child-first, in order to make the Egyptians believe that Hophra had died childless; secondly, in order to deprive her of her rights to the throne; for you know women are allowed to govern on the Nile.\"  \"These are mere suppositions.\"  \"For which, however, I can bring irrefragable proofs.  Among the papers which your old servant Hib brought with him in a small box, there must be some letters from a certain Sonnophre, a celebrated accoucheur, your own father, which .  .  .\"       [To judge from the pictures on the monuments and from the 1st Chap.      of Exodus, it would seem that in ancient, as in modern Egypt,      midwives were usually called in to assist at the birth of children;      but it is also certain, that in difficult cases physicians were      employed also.  In the hieratic medical papyrus in Berlin, women are      often spoken of as assisting at such times.  In the medical Papyrus      Ebers certain portions are devoted to diseases peculiar to women.      \"There were special rooms set aside in private houses for the birth      of children, as symbolical ones were reserved in the temples.  These      chambers were called meschen, and from them was derived the name      given to midwives, to meschennu.]  \"If that be the case, those letters are my property, and I have not the slightest intention of giving them up; besides which you might search Persia from one end to the other without finding any one who could decipher my father's writing.\"  \"Pardon me, if I point out one or two errors into which you have fallen. First, this box is at present in my hands, and though I am generally accustomed to respect the rights of property, I must assure you that, in the present instance, I shall not return the box until its contents have served my purpose.  Secondly, the gods have so ordained, that just at this moment there is a man in Babylon who can read every kind of writing known to the Egyptian priests.  Do you perhaps happen to know the name of Onuphis?\"  For the third time the Egyptian turned pale.  \"Are you certain,\" he said, \"that this man is still among the living?\"  \"I spoke to him myself yesterday.  He was formerly, you know, high-priest at Heliopolis, and was initiated into all your mysteries there.  My wise countryman, Pythagoras of Samos, came to Egypt, and after submitting to some of your ceremonies, was allowed to attend the lessons given in the schools for priests.  His remarkable talents won the love of the great Onuphis and he taught him all the Egyptian mysteries, which Pythagoras afterwards turned to account for the benefit of mankind.  My delightful friend Rhodopis and I are proud of having been his pupils.  When the rest of your caste heard that Onuphis had betrayed the sacred mysteries, the ecclesiastical judges determined on his death.  This was to be caused by a poison extracted from peach-kernels.  The condemned man, however, heard of their machinations, and fled to Naukratis, where he found a safe asylum in the house of Rhodopis, whom he had heard highly praised by Pythagoras, and whose dwelling was rendered inviolable by the king's letter.  Here he met Antimenidas the brother of the poet Alcarus of Lesbos, who, having been banished by Pittakus, the wise ruler of Mitylene, had gone to Babylon, and there taken service in the army of Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Assyria.  Antimenidas gave him letters to the Chaldians.  Onuphis travelled to the Euphrates, settled there, and was obliged to seek for some means of earning his daily bread, as he had left Egypt a poor man.  He is now supporting himself in his old age, by the assistance which his superior knowledge enables him to render the Chaldoeans in their astronomical observations from the tower of Bel. Onuphis is nearly eighty, but his mind is as clear as ever, and when I saw him yesterday and asked him to help me, his eyes brightened as he promised to do so.  Your father was one of his judges, but he bears you no malice and sends you a greeting.\"  Nebenchari's eyes were fixed thoughtfully on the ground during this tale. When Phanes had finished, he gave him a penetrating look and said: \"Where are my papers?\"  They are in Onuphis' hands.  He is looking among them for the document I want.\"  \"I expected to hear that.  Be so good as to tell me what the box is like, which Hib thought proper to bring over to Persia?\"  \"It is a small ebony trunk, with an exquisitely-carved lid.  In the centre is a winged beetle, and on the four corners .  .  .\"  \"That contains nothing but a few of my father's notices and memorandums,\" said Nebenchari, drawing a deep breath of relief.  \"They will very likely be sufficient for my purpose.  I do not know whether you have heard, that I stand as high as possible in Cambyses' favor.\"  \"So much the better for you.  I can assure you, however, that the paper. which would have been most useful to you have all been left behind in Egypt.\"  \"They were in a large chest made of sycamore-wood and painted in colors.\"  \"How do you know that?\"  \"Because--now listen well to what I am going to say, Nebenchari--because I can tell you (I do not swear, for our great master Pythagoras forbade oaths), that this very chest, with all it contained, was burnt in the grove of the temple of Neith, in Sais, by order of the king \"  Phanes spoke slowly, emphasizing every syllable, and the words seemed to strike the Egyptian like so many flashes of lightning.  His quiet coolness and deliberation gave way to violent emotion; his cheeks glowed and his eyes flashed.  But only for one single minute; then the strong emotion seemed to freeze, his burning cheeks grew pale.  \"You are trying to make me hate my friends, in order to gain me as your ally,\" he said, coldly and calmly.  \"I know you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5456"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 07 (#8)"],["body","very well.  You are so intriguing and artful, that there is no lie, no fraud, too base, if it will only help to gain your purpose.\"  \"You judge me and my countrymen in true Egyptian fashion; that is, they are foreigners, and therefore must be bad men.  But this time your suspicions happen to be misplaced.  Send for old Hib; he will tell you whether I am right or not.\"  Nebenchari's face darkened, as Hib came into the room.  \"Come nearer,\" said he in a commanding tone to the old man.  Hib obeyed with a shrug of the shoulders.  \"Tell me, have you taken a bribe from this man?  Yes or no?  I must know the truth; it can influence my future for good or evil.  You are an old and faithful servant, to whom I owe a great deal, and so I will forgive you if you were taken in by his artifices, but I must know the truth. I conjure you to tell me by the souls of your fathers gone to Osiris!\"  The old man's sallow face turned ashy pale as he heard these words.  He gulped and wheezed some time before he could find an answer, and at last, after choking down the tears which had forced their way to his eyes, said, in a half-angry, half-whining tone: \"Didn't I say so? they've bewitched him, they've ruined him in this wicked land.  Whatever a man would do himself, he thinks others are capable of.  Aye, you may look as angry as you like; it matters but little to me.  What can it matter indeed to an old man, who has served the same family faithfully and honestly for sixty years, if they call him at last a rogue, a knave, a traitor, nay even a murderer, if it should take their fancy.\"  And the scalding tears flowed down over the old man's cheeks, sorely against his will.  The easily-moved Phanes clapped him on the shoulder and said, turning to Nebenchari:  \"Hib is a faithful fellow.  I give you leave to call me a rascal, if he has taken one single obolus from me.\"  The physician did not need Phanes' assurance; he had known his old servant too well and too long not to be able to read his simple, open features, on which his innocence was written as clearly as in the pages of an open book.  \"I did not mean to reproach you, old Hib,\" he said kindly, coming up to him.  \"How can any one be so angry at a simple question?\"  \"Perhaps you expect me to be pleased at such a shameful suspicion?\"  \"No, not that; but at all events now you can tell me what has happened at our house since I left.\"  \"A pretty story that is!  Why only to think of it makes my mouth as bitter, as if I were chewing wormwood.\"  \"You said I had been robbed.\"  \"Yes indeed: no one was ever so robbed before.  There would have been some comfort if the knaves had belonged to the thieves' caste, for then we should have got the best part of our property back again, and should not after all have been worse off than many another; but when .  .  .\"       [The cunning son of the architect, who robbed the treasure-house of      Rhampsinitus was, according to Herodotus, (II. 120), severely      punished; but in Diod. I. 80. we see that when thieves acknowledged      themselves to the authorities to be such, they were not punished,      though a strict watch was set over them.  According to Diodorus,      there was a president of the thieves' caste, from whom the stolen      goods could be reclaimed on relinquishment of a fourth part of the      same.  This strange rule possibly owed its rise to the law, which      compelled every Egyptian to appear once in each year before the      authorities of his district and give an account of his means of      subsistence.  Those who made false statements were punished with      death.  Diod. I. 77.  Thus no one who valued his life could escape      the watchful eye of the police, and the thief sacrificed the best      part of his gains in order to save his life.]  \"Keep to the point, for my time is limited.\"  \"You need not tell me that; I see old Hib can't do anything right here in Persia.  Well, be it so, you're master; you must give orders; I am only the servant, I must obey.  I won't forget it.  Well, as I was saying, it was just at the time when the great Persian embassy came over to Sais to fetch Nitetis, and made everybody stare at them as if they were monsters or prodigies, that this shameful thing happened.  I was sitting on the mosquito-tower just as the sun was setting, playing with my little grandson, my Baner's eldest boy--he's a fine strapping little lad now, wonderfully sharp and strong for his age.  The rogue was just telling me how his father, the Egyptians do that when their wives leave the children too much alone--had hidden his mother's shoes, and I was laughing heartily, because my Baner won't let any of the little ones live with me, she always says I spoil them, and so I was glad she should have the trick played her--when all of a sudden there was such a loud knocking at the house-door, that I thought there must be a fire and let the child drop off my lap.  Down the stairs I ran, three steps at a time, as fast as my long legs would carry me, and unbarred the door.  Before I had time to ask them what they wanted, a whole crowd of temple-servants and policemen--there must have been at least fifteen of them--forced their way into the house.  Pichi,--you know, that impudent fellow from the temple of Neith,--pushed me back, barred the door inside and told the police to put me in fetters if I refused to obey him.  Of course I got angry and did not use very civil words to them--you know that's my way when I'm put out--and what does that bit of a fellow do--by our god Thoth, the protector of knowledge who must know all, I'm speaking the truth--but order them to bind my hands, forbid me--me, old Hib--to speak, and then tell me that he had been told by the high-priest to order me five-and-twenty strokes, if I refused to do his bidding.  He showed me the high-priest's ring, and so I knew there was nothing for it but to obey the villain, whether I would or no.  And what was his modest demand? Why, nothing less than to give him all the written papers you had left behind.  But old Hib is not quite so stupid as to let himself be caught in that way, though some people, who ought to know better, do fancy he can be bribed and is no better than the son of an ass.  What did I do then?  I pretended to be quite crushed into submission by the sight of the signet-ring, begged Pichi as politely as I could to unfasten my hands, and told him I would fetch the keys.  They loosened the cords, I flew up the stairs five steps at a time, burst open the door of your sleeping-room, pushed my little grandson, who was standing by it, into the room and barred it within.  Thanks to my long legs, the others were so far behind that I had time to get hold of the black box which you had told me to take so much care of, put it into the child's arms, lift him through the window on to the balcony which runs round the house towards the inner court, and tell him to put it at once into the pigeon-house. Then I opened the door as if nothing had happened, told Pichi the child had had a knife in his mouth, and that that was the reason I had run upstairs in such a hurry, and had put him out on the balcony to punish him.  That brother of a hippopotamus was easily taken in, and then he made me show him over the house.  First they found the great sycamore- chest which you had told me to take great care of too, then the papyrus- rolls on your writing-table, and so by degrees every written paper in the house.  They made no distinction, but put all together into the great chest and carried it downstairs; the little black box, however, lay safe enough in the pigeon-house.  My grandchild is the sharpest boy in all Sais!  \"When I saw them really carrying the chest downstairs, all the anger I'd been trying so hard to keep down burst out again.  I told the impudent fellows I would accuse them before the magistrates, nay, even before the king if necessary, and if those confounded Persians, who were having the city shown them, had not come up just then and made everybody stare at them, I could have roused the crowd to take my side.  The same evening I went to my son-in-law-he is employed in the temple of Neith too, you know,--and begged him to make every effort to find out what had become of the papers.  The good fellow has never forgotten the handsome dowry you gave my Baner when he married her, and in three days he came and told me he had seen your beautiful chest and all the rolls it contained burnt to ashes.  I was so angry that I fell ill of the jaundice, but that did not hinder me from sending in a written accusation to the magistrates.  The wretches,--I suppose only because they were priests too,--refused to take any notice of me or my complaint.  Then I sent in a petition to the king, and was turned away there too with the shameful threat, that I should be considered guilty of high treason if I mentioned the papers again.  I valued my tongue too much to take any further steps, but the ground burnt under my feet; I could not stay in Egypt, I wanted to see you, tell you what they had done to you, and call on you, who are more powerful than your poor servant, to revenge yourself.  And besides, I wanted to see the black box safe in your hands, lest they should take that from me too. And so, old man as I am, with a sad heart I left my home and my grandchildren to go forth into this foreign Typhon's land.  Ah, the little lad was too sharp!  As I was kissing him, he said: 'Stay with us, grandfather.  If the foreigners make you unclean, they won't let me kiss you any more.'  Baner sends you a hearty greeting, and my son-in-law told me to say he had found out that Psamtik, the crown-prince, and your rival, Petammon, had been the sole causes of this execrable deed.  I could not make up my mind to trust myself on that Typhon's sea, so I travelled with an Arabian trading caravan as far as Tadmor,--[Palmyra]-- the Phoenician palm-tree station in the wilderness,\" and then on to Carchemish,"]]]
