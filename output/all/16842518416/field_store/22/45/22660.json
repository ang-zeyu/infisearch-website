My father seemed delighted too, and he said to Chamus: 'He has won there!\"  \"He will grant me some great favor,\" said Mena in explanation, \"if, when she hears I have taken a strange maiden to my tent her confidence in me is not shaken, Rameses considers it simply impossible, but I know that I shall win.  Why! she must trust me.\"     CHAPTER XXXIX.  Before the battle,       [The battle about to be described is taken entirely from the epos of      Pentaur.]  prayers were offered and victims sacrificed for each division of the army.  Images of the Gods were borne through the ranks in their festal barks, and miraculous relics were exhibited to the soldiers; heralds announced that the high-priest had found favorable omens in the victims offered by the king, and that the haruspices foretold a glorious victory. Each Egyptian legion turned with particular faith to the standard which bore the image of the sacred animal or symbol of the province where it had been levied, but each soldier was also provided with charms and amulets of various kinds; one had tied to his neck or arm a magical text in a little bag, another the mystic preservative eye, and most of them wore a scarabaeus in a finger ring.  Many believed themselves protected by having a few hairs or feathers of some sacred animal, and not a few put themselves under the protection of a living snake or beetle carefully concealed in a pocket of their apron or in their little provision-sack.  When the king, before whom were carried the images of the divine Triad of Thebes, of Menth, the God of War and of Necheb, the Goddess of Victory, reviewed the ranks, he was borne in a litter on the shoulders of twenty- four noble youths; at his approach the whole host fell on their knees, and did not rise till Rameses, descending from his position, had, in the presence of them all, burned incense, and made a libation to the Gods, and his son Chamus had delivered to him, in the name of the Immortals, the symbols of life and power.  Finally, the priests sang a choral hymn to the Sun-god Ra, and to his son and vicar on earth, the king.  Just as the troops were put in motion, the paling stars appeared in the sky, which had hitherto been covered with thick clouds; and this occurrence was regarded as a favorable omen, the priests declaring to the army that, as the coming Ra had dispersed the clouds, so the Pharaoh would scatter his enemies.  With no sound of trumpet or drum, so as not to arouse the enemy, the foot-soldiers went forward in close order, the chariot-warriors, each in his light two-wheeled chariot drawn by two horses, formed their ranks, and the king placed himself at their head.  On each side of the gilt chariot in which he stood, a case was fixed, glittering with precious stones, in which were his bows and arrows.  His noble horses were richly caparisoned; purple housings, embroidered with turquoise beads, covered their backs and necks, and a crown-shaped ornament was fixed on their heads, from which fluttered a bunch of white ostrich-feathers.  At the end of the ebony pole of the chariot, were two small padded yokes, which rested on the necks of the horses, who pranced in front as if playing with the light vehicle, pawed the earth with their small hoofs, and tossed and curved their slender necks.  The king wore a shirt of mail,       [The remains of a shirt of mail, dating from the time of Scheschenk      I. (Sesonchis), who belonged to the 22d dynasty, is in the British      Museum.  It is made of leather, on which bronze scales are      fastened.]  over which lay the broad purple girdle of his apron, and on his head was the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt; behind him stood Mena, who, with his left hand, tightly held the reins, and with his right the shield which was to protect his sovereign in the fight.  The king stood like a storm-proof oak, and Mena by his side like a sapling ash.  The eastern horizon was rosy with the approaching sun-rise when they quitted the precincts of the camp; at this moment the pioneer Paaker advanced to meet the king, threw himself on the ground before him, kissed the earth, and, in answer to the king's question as to why he had come without his brother, told him that Horus was taken suddenly ill.  The shades of dawn concealed from the king the guilty color, which changed to sallow paleness, on the face of the pioneer--unaccustomed hitherto to lying and treason.  \"How is it with the enemy?\"  asked Rameses.  \"He is aware,\" replied Paaker, \"that a fight is impending, and is collecting numberless hosts in the camps to the south and east of the city.  If thou could'st succeed in falling on the rear from the north of Kadesh, while the foot soldiers seize the camp of the Asiatics from the south, the fortress will be thine before night.  The mountain path that thou must follow, so as not to be discovered, is not a bad one.\"  \"Are you ill as well as your brother, man?\"  asked the king.  \"Your voice trembles.\"  \"I was never better,\" answered the Mohar.  Lead the way,\" commanded the king, and Paaker obeyed.  They went on in silence, followed by the vast troop of chariots through the dewy morning air, first across the plain, and then into the mountain range.  The corps of Ra, armed with bows and arrows, preceeded them to clear the way; they crossed the narrow bed of a dry torrent, and then a broad valley opened before them, extending to the right and left and enclosed by ranges of mountains.  \"The road is good,\" said  Rameses, turning to Mena.  \"The Mohar has learned his duties from his father, and his horses are capital.  Now he leads the way, and points it out to the guards, and then in a moment he is close to us again.\"  \"They are the golden-bays of my breed,\" said Mena, and the veins started angrily in his forehead.  \"My stud-master tells me that Katuti sent them to him before his departure.  They were intended for Nefert's chariot, and he drives them to-day to defy and spite me.\"  \"You have the wife--let the horses go,\" said Rameses soothingly.  Suddenly a blast of trumpets rang through the morning air; whence it came could not be seen, and yet it sounded close at hand.  Rameses started up and took his battle-axe from his girdle, the horses pricked their ears, and Mena exclaimed:  \"Those are the trumpets of the Cheta!  I know the sound.\"  A closed wagon with four wheels in which the king's lions were conveyed, followed the royal chariot.  \"Let loose the lions!\"  cried the king, who heard an echoing war cry, and soon after saw the vanguard which had preceded him, and which was broken up by the chariots of the enemy, flying towards him down the valley again.  The wild beasts shook their manes and sprang in front of their master's chariot with loud roars.  Mena lashed his whip, the horses started forward and rushed with frantic plunges towards the fugitives, who however could not be brought to a standstill, or rallied by the king's voice--the enemy were close upon them, cutting them down.  \"Where is Paaker?\"  asked the king.  But the pioneer had vanished as completely as if the earth had swallowed him and his chariot.  The flying Egyptians and the death-dealing chariots of the enemy came nearer and nearer, the ground trembled, the tramp of hoofs and the roar of wheels sounded louder and louder, like the roll of a rapidly approaching storm.  Then Rameses gave out a war cry, that rang back from the cliffs on the right hand and on the left like the blast of a trumpet; his chariot-guard joined in the shout--for an instant the flying Egyptians paused, but only to rush on again with double haste, in hope of escape and safety: suddenly the war-cry of the enemy was heard behind the king, mingling with the trumpet-call of the Cheta, and out from a cross valley, which the king had passed unheeded by--and into which Paaker had disappeared-- came an innumerable host of chariots which, before the king could retreat, had broken through the Egyptian ranks, and cut him off from the body of his army.  Behind him he could hear the roar and shock of the battle, in front of him he saw the fugitives, the fallen, and the enemy growing each instant in numbers and fury.  He saw the whole danger, and drew up his powerful form as if to prove whether it were an equal match for such a foe.  Then, raising his voice to such a pitch, that it sounded above the cries and groans of the fighting men, the words of command, the neighing of the horses, the crash of overthrown chariots, the dull whirr of lances and swords, their heavy blows on shields and helmets, and the whole bewildering tumult of the battle--with a loud shout he drew his bow, and his first arrow pierced a Cheta chief.  His lions sprang forward, and carried confusion into the hosts that were crowding down upon him, for many of their horses became unmanageable at the roar of the furious brutes, overthrew the chariots, and so hemmed the advance of the troops in the rear.  Rameses sent arrow after arrow, while Mena covered him with the shield from the shots of the enemy.  His horses meanwhile had carried him forward, and he could fell the foremost of the Asiatics with his battle-axe; close by his side fought Rameri and three other princes; in front of him were the lions.  The press was fearful, and the raging of the battle wild and deafening, like the roar of the surging ocean when it is hurled by a hurricane against a rocky coast.  Mena seemed to be in two places at once, for, while he guided the horses forwards, backwards, or to either hand, as the exigences of the position demanded, not one of the arrows shot at the king touched him.  His eye was everywhere, the shield always ready, and not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5447"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 09 (#5)"],["body"," eyelash of the young hero trembled, while Rameses, each moment more infuriated, incited his lions with wild war-cries, and with flashing eyes advanced farther and farther into the enemy's ranks.  Three arrows aimed, not at the king but at Mena himself, were sticking in the charioteer's shield, and by chance he saw written on the shaft of one of them the words \"Death to Mena.\"  A fourth arrow whizzed past him.  His eye followed its flight, and as he marked the spot whence it had come, a fifth wounded his shoulder, and he cried out to the king:  \"We are betrayed!  Look over there!  Paaker is fighting with the Cheta.\"  Once more the Mohar had bent his bow, and came so near to the king's chariot that he could be heard exclaiming in a hoarse voice, as he let the bowstring snap, \"Now I will reckon with you--thief!  robber!  My bride is your wife, but with this arrow I will win Mena's widow.\"  The arrow cut through the air, and fell with fearful force on the charioteer's helmet; the shield fell from his grasp, and he put his hand to his head, feeling stunned; he heard Paaker's laugh of triumph, he felt another of his enemy's arrows cut his wrist, and, beside himself with rage, he flung away the reins, brandished his battle-axe, and forgetting himself and his duty, sprang from the chariot and rushed upon Paaker. The Mohar awaited him with uplifted sword; his lips were white, his eyes bloodshot, his wide nostrils trembled like those of an over-driven horse, and foaming and hissing he flew at his mortal foe.  The king saw the two engaged in a struggle, but he could not interfere, for the reins which Mena had dropped were dragging on the ground, and his ungoverned horses, following the lions, carried him madly onwards.  Most of his comrades had fallen, the battle raged all round him, but Rameses stood as firm as a rock, held the shield in front of him, and swung the deadly battle-axe; he saw Rameri hastening towards him with his horses, the youth was fighting like a hero, and Rameses called out to encourage him: \"Well done! a worthy grandson of Seti!\"  \"I will win a new sword!\"  cried the boy, and he cleft the skull of one of his antagonists.  But he was soon surrounded by the chariots of the enemy; the king saw the enemy pull down the young prince's horses, and all his comrades--among whom were many of the best warriors--turn their horses in flight.  Then one of the lions was pierced by a lance, and sank with a dying roar of rage and pain that was heard above all the tumult.  The king himself had been grazed by an arrow, a sword stroke had shivered his shield, and his last arrow had been shot away.  Still spreading death around him, he saw death closing in upon him, and, without giving up the struggle, he lifted up his voice in fervent prayer, calling on Amon for support and rescue.  While thus in the sorest need he was addressing himself to the Lords of Heaven, a tall Egyptian suddenly appeared in the midst of the struggle and turmoil of the battle, seized the reins, and sprang into the chariot behind the king, to whom he bowed respectfully.  For the first time Rameses felt a thrill of fear.  Was this a miracle?  Had Amon heard his prayer?  He looked half fearfully round at his new charioteer, and when he fancied he recognized the features of the deceased Mohar, the father of the traitor Paaker, he believed that Amon had assumed this aspect, and had come himself to save him.  \"Help is at hand!\"  cried his new companion.  \"If we hold our own for only a short time longer, thou art saved, and victory is ours.\"  Then once more Rameses raised his war-cry, felled a Cheta, who was standing close to him to the ground, with a blow on his skull, while the mysterious supporter by his side, who covered him with the shield, on his part also dealt many terrible strokes.  Thus some long minutes passed in renewed strife; then a trumpet sounded above the roar of the battle, and this time Rameses recognized the call of the Egyptians; from behind a low ridge on his right rushed some thousands of men of the foot-legion of Ptah who, under the command of Horus, fell upon the enemy's flank.  They saw their king, and the danger he was in.  They flung themselves with fury on the foes that surrounded him, dealing death as they advanced, and putting the Cheta to flight, and soon Rameses saw himself safe, and protected by his followers.  But his mysterious friend in need had vanished.  He had been hit by an arrow, and had fallen to the earth--a quite mortal catastrophe; but Rameses still  believed that one of the Immortals had come to his rescue.  But the king granted no long respite to his horses and his fighting-men; he turned to go back by the way by which he had come, fell upon the forces which divided him from the main army, took them in the rear while they were still occupied with his chariot-brigade which was already giving way, and took most of the Asiatics prisoners who escaped the arrows and  swords of the Egyptians.  Having rejoined the main body of the troops, he pushed forwards across the plain where the Asiatic horse and chariot-legions were engaged with the Egyptian swordsmen, and forced the enemy back upon the river Orontes and the lake of Kadesh.  Night-fall put an end to the battle, though early next morning the struggle was renewed.  Utter discouragement had fallen upon the Asiatic allies, who had gone into battle in full security of victory; for the pioneer Paaker had betrayed his king into their hands.  When the Pharaoh had set out, the best chariot-warriors of the Cheta were drawn up in a spot concealed by the city, and sent forward against Rameses through the northern opening of the valley by which he was to pass, while other troops of approved valor, in all two thousand five hundred chariots, were to fall upon him from a cross valley where they took up their position during the night.  These tactics had been successfully carried out, and notwithstanding the Asiatics had suffered a severe defeat--besides losing some of their noblest heroes, among them Titure their Chancellor, and Chiropasar, the chronicler of the Cheta king, who could wield the sword as effectively as the pen, and who, it was intended, should celebrate the victory of the allies, and perpetuate its glory to succeeding generations.  Rameses had killed one of these with his own hands, and his unknown companion the other, and besides these many other brave captains of the enemy's troops. The king was greeted as a god, when he returned to the camp, with shouts of triumph and hymns of praise.  Even the temple-servants, and the miserable troops from Upper Egypt- ground down by the long war, and bought over by Ani--were carried away by the universal enthusiasm, and joyfully hailed the hero and king who had successfully broken the stiff necks of his enemies.  The next duty was to seek out the dead and wounded; among the latter was Mena; Rameri also was missing, but news was brought next day that he had fallen into the hands of the enemy, and he was immediately exchanged for the princess who had been sheltered in Mena's tent.  Paaker had disappeared; but the bays which he had driven into the battle were found unhurt in front of his ruined and blood-sprinkled chariot.  The Egyptians were masters of Kadesh, and Chetasar, the king of the Cheta, sued to be allowed to treat for peace, in his own name and in that of his allies; but Rameses refused to grant any terms till he had returned to the frontier of Egypt.  The conquered peoples had no choice, and the representative of the Cheta king--who himself was wounded--and twelve princes of the principal nations who had fought against Rameses, were forced to follow his victorious train.  Every respect was shown them, and they were treated as the king himself, but they were none the less his prisoners.  The king was anxious to lose no time, for sad suspicion filled his heart; a shadow hitherto unknown to his bright and genial nature had fallen upon his spirit.  This was the first occasion on which one of his own people had betrayed him to the enemy.  Paaker's deed had shaken his friendly confidence, and in his petition for peace the Cheta prince had intimated that Rameses might find much in his household to be set to rights--perhaps with a strong hand.  The king felt himself more than equal to cope with Ani, the priests, and all whom he had left in Egypt; but it grieved him to be obliged to feel any loss of confidence, and it was harder to him to bear than any reverse of fortune.  It urged him to hasten his return to Egypt.  There was another thing which embittered his victory.  Mena, whom he loved as his own son, who understood his lightest sign, who, as soon as be mounted his chariot, was there by his side like a part of himself--had been dismissed from his office by the judgment of the commander-in-chief, and no longer drove his horses.  He himself had been obliged to confirm this decision as just and even mild, for that man was worthy of death who exposed his king to danger for the gratification of his own revenge.  Rameses had not seen Mena since his struggle with Paaker, but he listened anxiously to the news which was brought him of the progress of his sorely wounded officer.  The cheerful, decided, and practical nature of Rameses was averse to every kind of dreaminess or self-absorption, and no one had ever seen him, even in hours of extreme weariness, give himself up to vague and melancholy brooding; but now he would often sit gazing at the ground in wrapt meditation, and start like an awakened sleeper when his reverie was disturbed by the requirements of the outer world around him.  A hundred times before he had looked death in the face, and defied it as he would any other enemy, but now it seemed as though he felt the cold hand of the mighty adversary on his heart.  He could not forget the oppressive sense of helplessness which had seized him when he had felt himself at the mercy of the unrestrained horses, like a"]]]
