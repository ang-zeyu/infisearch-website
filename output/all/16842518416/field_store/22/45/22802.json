He was aided by one of Caesar's freedmen, Epaphroditus, who is said to stand so high in the favour of Octavianus.  \"The scoundrel also searched Iras and Charmian, yet all the time both Romans constantly spoke in cajoling terms of Caesar's favour; and his desire to grant Cleopatra everything which was due a Queen.  \"At last she was taken back to Lochias, but I felt like a madman; for the image of the unfortunate woman pursued me like my shadow.  It was no longer a vision of the bewitching sovereign nay, it resembled the incarnation of despair, tearless anguish, wrath demanding vengeance. I will not describe it; but those eyes, those flashing, threatening eyes, and the tangled hair on which Antony's blood had flowed-terrible, horrible!  My heart grew chill, as if I had seen upon Athene's shield the head of the Medusa with its serpent locks.  \"It had been impossible for me to warn her in time, or even to seize the traitor's arm--I have already said so--and yet, yet her shining image gazed reproachfully at me for my cowardly delay.  Her glance still haunts me, robbing me of calmness and peace.  Not until I gaze into Helena's pure, calm eyes will that terrible vision of the face, flooded by light in the midst of the tomb, cease to haunt me.\"  His friend laid his hand on his arm, spoke soothingly to him, and reminded him of the blessings which this terrible day--he had said so himself--had brought.  Dion was right to give this warning; for Gorgias's bearing and the very tone of his voice changed as he eagerly declared that the frightful events had been followed by more than happy ones for the city, his friend, and Barine.  Then, with a sigh of relief, he continued: \"I pursued my way home like a drunken man.  Every attempt to approach the Queen or her attendants was baffled, but I learned from Charmian's clever Nubian that Cleopatra had been permitted, in Caesar's name, to choose the palace she desired to occupy, and had selected the one at Lochias.  \"I did not make much progress towards my house; the crowd in front of the great gymnasium stopped me.  Octavianus had gone into the city, and the people, I heard, had greeted him with acclamations and flung themselves on their knees before him.  Our stiff-necked Alexandrians in the dust before the victor!  It enraged me, but my resentment was diminished.  \"The members of the gymnasium all knew me.  They made way and, ere I was aware of it, I had passed through the door.  Tall Phryxus had drawn my arm through his.  He appears and vanishes at will, is as alert as he is rich, sees and hears everything, and manages to secure the best places. This time he had again succeeded; for when he released me we were standing opposite to a newly erected tribune.  \"They were waiting for Octavianus, who was still in the hypostyle of Euergetes receiving the homage of the epitrop, the members of the Council, the gymnasiarch, and I know not how many others.  \"Phryxus said that on Caesar's entry he had held out his hand to his former tutor, bade him accompany him, and commanded that his sons should be presented.  The philosopher had been distinguished above every one else, and this will benefit you and yours; for he is Berenike's brother, and therefore your wife's uncle.  What he desires is sure to be granted. You will hear at once how studiously the Caesar distinguishes him.  I do not grudge it to the man; he interceded boldly for Barine; he is lauded as an able scholar, and he does not lack courage.  In spite of Actium and the only disgraceful deed with which, to my knowledge, Mark Antony could be reproached--I mean the surader of Turullius--Arius remained here, though the Imperator might have held the friend of Julius Caesar's nephew as a hostage as easily as he gave up the Emperor's assassin.  \"Since Octavianus encamped before the city, your uncle has been in serious danger, and his sons shared his peril.  Surely you must know the handsome, vigorous young Ephebi.  \"We were not obliged to wait long in the gymnasium ere the Caesar appeared on the platform; and now--if your hand clenches, it is only what I expect--now all fell on their knees.  Our turbulent, rebellious rabble raised their hands like pleading beggars, and grave, dignified men followed their example.  Whoever saw me and Phryxus will remember us among the kneeling lickspittles;  for had we remained standing we should certainly have been dragged down.  So we followed the example of the others.\"  \"And Octavianus?\" asked Dion eagerly.  \"A man of regal bearing and youthful aspect; beardless face of the finest chiselling, a profile as beautiful as if created for the coin-maker; all the lines sharp and yet pleasing; every inch an aristocrat; but the very mirror of a cold nature, incapable of any lofty aspiration, any warm emotion, any tenderness of feeling.  All in all, a handsome, haughty, calculating man, whose friendship would hardly benefit the heart, but from whose enmity may the immortals guard all we love!  \"Again he led Arius by the hand.  The philosopher's sons followed the pair.  When he stood on the stage, looking down upon the thousands kneeling before him, not a muscle of his noble face--it is certainly that --betrayed the slightest emotion.  He gazed at us like a farmer surveying his flocks and, after a long silence, said curtly in excellent Greek that he absolved the Alexandrians from all guilt towards him: first--he counted as if he were summoning individual veterans to reward them--from respect for the illustrious founder of our city, Alexander, the conqueror of the world; secondly, because the greatness and beauty of Alexandria filled him with admiration; and, thirdly--he turned to Arius as he spoke --to give pleasure to his admirable and beloved friend.  \"Then shouts of joy burst forth.  \"Every one, from the humblest to the greatest, had had a heavy burden removed from his mind, and the throng had scarcely left the gymnasium when they were again laughing saucily enough, and there was no lack of biting and innocent jests.  \"The fat carpenter, Memnon--who furnished the wood-work for your palace-- exclaimed close beside me that formerly a dolphin had saved Arius from the pirates; now Arius was saving marine Alexandria from the robbers.  So the sport went on.  Philostratus, Barine's first husband, offered the best butt for jests.  The agitator had good reason to fear the worst; and now, clad in black mourning robes, ran after Arius, whom but a few months ago he persecuted with the most vindictive hatred, continually repeating this shallow bit of verse:            \"'If he is a wise man, let the wise aid the wise.'  \"Reaching home was not easy.  The street was swarming with Roman soldiers.  They fared well enough; for in the joy of their hearts many a prosperous citizen who saw his property saved invited individual warriors, or even a whole maniple, to the taverns or cook-shops, and the stock of wine in Alexandrian cellars will be considerably diminished to- night.  \"Many, as I have already said, had been quartered in the houses, with orders to spare the property of the citizens; and it was in this way that the misfortune with which I commenced my narrative befell the grandmother.  She died before my departure.  \"All the gates of the city will now stand open to you, and the niece of Arius and her husband will be received with ovations.  I don't grudge Barine the good fortune; for the way in which your noble wife, who had cast her spell over me too, flung aside what is always dear to the admired city beauty and found on the loneliest of islands a new world in love, is worthy of all admiration and praise.  For yourself, I dread new happiness and honours; if they are added to those which Fate bestowed upon you in such a wife and your son Pyrrhus, the gods would not be themselves if they did not pursue you with their envy.  I have less reason to fear them.\"  \"Ungrateful fellow!\" interrupted his friend.  \"There will be numerous mortals to grudge you Helena.  As for me, I have already felt many a slight foreboding; but we have already paid by no means a small tribute to the divine ones.  The lamp is still burning in the sitting-room. Inform the sisters of their grandmother's death, and tell them the pleasant tidings you have brought us, but reserve until the morning a description of the terrible scenes you witnessed.  We will not spoil their sleep.  Mark my words!  Helena's silent grief and her joy at our escape will lighten your heart.\"  And so it proved.  True, Gorgias lived over again in his dreams the frightful spectacle witnessed the day before; but when the sun of the 2d day of August rose in full radiance over Alexandria and, early in the morning, boat after boat reached the Serpent Island, landing first Berenike and her nephews, the sons of the honoured philosopher Arius, then clients, officials, and friends of Dion, and former favourite guests of Barine, to greet the young pair and escort them from the refuge which had so long sheltered them back to the city and their midst, new and pleasant impressions robbed the gloomy picture of a large portion of its terrors.  \"Tall Phryxus\" had rapidly spread the news of the place where Dion and Barine had vanished, and that they had long been happily wedded.  Many deemed it well worth a short voyage to see the actors in so strange an adventure and be the first to greet them.  Besides, those who knew Barine and her husband were curious to learn how two persons accustomed to the life of a great capital had endured for months such complete solitude. Many feared or expected to see them emaciated and careworn, haggard or sunk in melancholy, and hence there were a number of astonished faces among those whose boats the freedman Pyrrhus guided as pilot through the shallows which protected his island.  The return of this rare couple to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5481"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 09 (#3)"],["body","home would have afforded an excellent opportunity for gay festivities.  Sincerely as the majority of the populace mourned the fate of the Queen, and gravely as the more thoughtful feared for Alexandria's freedom under Roman rule, all rejoiced over the lenient treatment of the city.  Their lives and property were safe, and the celebration of festivals had become a life habit with all classes.  But the news of the death of Didymus's wife and the illness of the old man, who could not bear up under the loss of his faithful companion, gave Dion a right to refuse any gay welcome at his home.  Barine's sorrow was his also, and Didymus died a few days after his wife, with whom he had lived in the bonds of love for more than half a century --people said, \"of a broken heart.\"  So Dion and his young wife entered his beautiful palace with no noisy festivities.  Instead of the jubilant hymenaeus, the voice of his own child greeted him on the threshold.  The mourning garments in which Barine welcomed him in the women's apartment reminded him of the envy of the gods which his friend had feared for him.  But he often fancied that his mother's statue in the tablinum looked specially happy when the young mistress of the house entered it.  Barine, too, felt that her happiness as wife and mother in her magnificent home would have been overwhelming had not a wise destiny imposed upon her, just at this time, grief for those whom she loved.  Dion instantly devoted himself again to the affairs of the city and his own business.  He and the woman he loved, who had first become really his own during a time of sore privation, had run into the harbour and gazed quietly at the storms of life.  The anchor of love, which moored their ship to the solid earth, had been tested in the solitude of the Serpent Island.     CHAPTER XXIV.  The fisherman and his family had watched the departure of their beloved guests with sorrowful hearts, and the women had shed many tears, although the sons of Pyrrhus had been dismissed from the fleet and were again helping their father at home, as in former times.  Besides, Dion had made the faithful freedman a prosperous man, and given his daughter, Dione, a marriage dowry.  She was soon to become the wife of the captain of the Epicurus, Archibius's swift galley, whose acquaintance she had made when the vessel, on several occasions, brought Charmian's Nubian maid to the island.  Anukis's object in making these visits was not only to see her friend, but to induce him to catch one of the poisonous serpents in the neighbouring island and keep it ready for the Queen.  Since Cleopatra had ascertained that no poison caused a less painful death than the fangs of the asp, she had resolved that the bite of one of these reptiles should release her from the burden of life.  The clever Ethiopian had thought of inducing her friend Pyrrhus to procure the adder, but it had required all Aisopion's skill in persuasion, and the touching manner in which she understood how to describe the Queen's terrible situation and severe suffering, to conquer the reluctance of the upright man.  At last she succeeded in persuading him to measure a queen by a different standard from a woman of the people, and inducing him to arrange the manner and time of conveying the serpent into the well- guarded palace.  A signal was to inform him when the decisive hour arrived.  After that he was to be ready with the asp in the fish-market every day.  Probably his service would soon be claimed; for Octavianus's delay was scarcely an indication of a favourable decision of Cleopatra's fate.  True, she was permitted to live in royal state at Lochias, and had even been allowed to have the children, the twins, and little Alexander sent back to her with the promise that life and liberty would be granted them; but Caesarion--whose treacherous tutor Rhodon lured him from the journey southward back to Alexandria by all sorts of representations, among them the return of Barine--was held prisoner in his father's temple, where he had sought refuge.  This news, and the fact that Octavianus had condemned to death the youth who bore so striking a resemblance to Caesar, had not remained concealed from the unhappy mother.  She was also informed of the words in which the philosopher Arius had encouraged Caesar's desire to rid himself of the son of his famous uncle.  They referred to the Homeric saying concerning the disadvantage of having many rulers.  Everything which Cleopatra desired to know concerning events in the city reached her ears; for she was allowed much liberty-only she was closely watched day and night, and all the servants and officials to whom she granted an audience were carefully searched to keep from her all means of self-destruction.  True, it was very evident that she had closed her account with life.  Her attempt to take no food and die of starvation must have been noticed. Threats directed against the children, through whom she could be most easily influenced, finally induced her to eat again.  Octavianus was informed of all these things, and his conduct proved his anxiety to keep her from suicide.  Several Asiatic princes vied with each other in the desire to honour Mark Antony by a magnificent funeral, but Octavianus had allowed Cleopatra to provide the most superb obsequies.  In the time of her deepest anguish it afforded her comfort and satisfaction to arrange everything herself, and even perform some offices with her own hands.  The funeral had been as gorgeous as the dead man's love of splendour could have desired.  Iras and Charmian were often unable to understand how the Queen--who, since Antony's death, had suffered not only from the wounds she had inflicted upon herself in her despair, but also after her baffled attempt at starvation from a slow fever--had succeeded in resisting the severe exertions and mental agitation to which she had been subjected by Antony's funeral.  The return of Archibius with the children, however, had visibly reanimated her flagging energy.  She often went to Didymus's garden, which was now connected with the palace at Lochias, to watch their work and share whatever interested their young hearts.  But the gayest of mothers, who had understood how to enter so thoroughly into her children's pursuits, had now become a sorrowful, grave monitor. Though the lessons she urged upon them were often beautiful and wise, they were little suited to the ages of Archibius's pupils, for they usually referred to death and to questions of philosophy not easily understood by children.  She herself felt that she no longer struck the right key; but whenever she tried to change it and jest with them as usual, she could endure the forced gaiety only a short time; a painful revulsion, frequently accompanied by tears, followed, and she was obliged to leave her darlings.  The life her foe granted her seemed like an intrusive gift, an oppressive debt, which we desire to pay a troublesome creditor as soon as possible. She seemed calmer and apparently content only when permitted to talk with the companions of her youth concerning bygone days, or with them and Iras of death, and how it would be possible to put an end to an unwelcome existence.  After such conversations Iras and Charmian left her with bleeding hearts. They had long since resolved to share the fate of their royal mistress, whatever it might be.  Their common suffering was the bond which again united them in affection.  Iras had provided poisoned pins which had speedily destroyed the animals upon which they had been tried.  Cleopatra knew of their existence, but she herself preferred the painless death bestowed by the serpent's bite, and it was long since her friends had seen the eyes of their beloved sovereign sparkle so brightly as when Charmian told her that away had been found to obtain the uraeus serpent as soon as it was needed.  Put it was not yet imperative to adopt the last expedient.  Octavianus wished to be considered lenient, and perhaps might still be prevailed upon to grant the Queen and her children a future meet for their royal birth.  Cleopatra's reply was an incredulous smile, yet a faint hope which saved her from despair began to bud in her soul.  Dolabella, an aristocratic Roman, a scion of the noble Cornelius family, was in the Caesar's train, and had been presented to the Egyptian Queen. In former years his father was a friend of Cleopatra; nay, she had placed him under obligations by sending him, after the murder of Julius Caesar, the military force at her command to be used against Cassius.  True, her legions, by messengers from Dolabella himself, were despatched in another direction; but Cleopatra had not withdrawn her favour from Dolabella's father on that account.  The latter had known her in Rome before the death of Caesar, and had enthusiastically described the charms of the bewitching Egyptian sovereign.  Though the youth found her only a mourning widow, ill in body and mind, he was so strongly attracted and deeply moved by her beauty, her brilliant intellect, her grace of bearing, her misfortunes and sufferings, that he devoted many hours to her, and would have considered it a happiness to render her greater services than circumstances permitted.  He often accompanied her to the children, whose hearts had been completely won by his frank, cheerful nature; and so it happened that he soon became one of the most welcome guests at Lochias.  He confided without reserve every feeling that stirred his soul to the warm-hearted woman who was so many years his senior, and through him she learned many things connected with Octavianus and his surroundings.  Without permitting himself to be used as a tool, he became an advocate for the unfortunate woman whom he so deeply esteemed.  In intercourse with her he made every effort to inspire confidence in Octavianus, who favoured him, enjoyed his society, and in whose magnanimity the youth firmly believed.  He"]]]
