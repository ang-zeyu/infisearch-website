Neither were flags unknown to the Greeks.  It      appears from some inscriptions on the staffs of the Pylons, that if      the former were not actually erected for lightning-rods, it had been      noticed that they attracted the electricity.]  \"Rhodopis must surely be from home; can they have forgotten?\"--Here a deep voice suddenly interrupted him with the exclamation, \"Ha! the commander of the body-guard!\"  \"A pleasant evening to you, Knakais,\" exclaimed Phanes, kindly greeting the old man, who now came up.  \"But how is it that this garden is as still as an Egyptian tomb, and yet the flag of welcome is fluttering at the gate?  How long has that white ensign waved for guests in vain?\"  \"How long indeed?\"  echoed the old slave of Rhodopis with a smile.  \"So long as the Fates graciously spare the life of my mistress, the old flag is sure to waft as many guests hither as the house is able to contain. Rhodopis is not at home now, but she must return shortly.  The evening being so fine, she determined on taking a pleasure-trip on the Nile with her guests.  They started at sunset, two hours ago, and the evening meal is already prepared; they cannot remain away much longer.  I pray you, Phanes, to have patience and follow me into the house.  Rhodopis would not easily forgive me, if I allowed such valued guests to depart.  You stranger,\" he added, turning to the Spartan, \"I entreat most heartily to remain; as friend of your friend you will be doubly welcome to my mistress.\"  The two Greeks, following the servant, seated themselves in an arbor, and Aristomachus, after gazing on the scene around him now brilliantly lighted by the moon, said, \"Explain to me, Phanes, by what good fortune this Rhodopis, formerly only a slave and courtesan can now live as a queen, and receive her guests in this princely manner?\"       [The mistresses (Hetaere) of the Greeks must not be compared with      modern women of bad reputation.  The better members of this class      represented the intelligence and culture of their sex in Greece, and      more especially in the Ionian provinces.  As an instance we need      only recall Aspasia and her well-attested relation to Pericles and      Socrates.  Our heroine Rhodopis was a celebrated woman.  The      Hetaera, Thargalia of Miletus, became the wife of a Thessalian king.      Ptolemy Lagi married Thais; her daughter was called Irene, and her      sons Leontiskus and Lagus.  Finally, statues were erected to many.]  \"I have long expected this question,\" answered the Athenian.  \"I shall be delighted to make you acquainted with the past history of this woman before you enter her house.  So long as we were on the Nile, I would not intrude my tale upon you; that ancient river has a wonderful power of compelling to silence and quiet contemplation.  Even my usually quick tongue was paralyzed like yours, when I took my first night-journey on the Nile.\"  \"I thank you for this,\" replied the Spartan.  \"When I first saw the aged priest Epimenides,\" at Knossus in Crete, he was one hundred and fifty years old, and I remember that his age and sanctity filled me with a strange dread; but how far older, how far more sacred, is this hoary river, the ancient stream 'Aigyptos'!\"  Who would wish to avoid the power of his spells?  Now, however, I beg you to give me the history of Rhodopis.\"  Phanes began: \"When Rhodopis was a little child playing with her companions on the Thracian sea-shore, she was stolen by some Phoenician mariners, carried to Samos, and bought by Iadmon, one of the geomori, or landed aristocracy of the island.  The little girl grew day by day more beautiful, graceful and clever, and was soon an object of love and admiration to all who knew her.  AEsop, the fable-writer, who was at that time also in bondage to Iadmon, took an especial pleasure in the growing amiability and talent of the child, taught her and cared for her in the same way as the tutors whom we keep to educate our Athenian boys.  The kind teacher found his pupil tractable and quick of comprehension, and the little slave soon practised the arts of music, singing and eloquence, in a more charming and agreeable manner than the sons of her master Iadmon, on whose education the greatest care had been lavished. By the time she had reached her fourteenth year, Rhodopis was so beautiful and accomplished, that the jealous wife of Iadmon would not suffer her to remain any longer in the house, and the Samian was forced, with a heavy heart, to sell her to a certain Xanthus.  The government of Samos at that time was still in the hands of the less opulent nobles; had Polykrates then been at the head of affairs, Xanthus need not have despaired of a purchaser.  These tyrants fill their treasuries as the magpies their nests!  As it was, however, he went off with his precious jewel to Naukratis, and there gained a fortune by means of her wondrous charms.  These were three years of the deepest humiliation to Rhodopis, which she still remembers with horror.  Now it happened, just at the time when her fame was spreading through all Greece, and strangers were coming from far to Naukratis for her sake alone, that the people of Lesbos rose up against their nobles, drove them forth, and chose the wise Pittakus as their ruler.       [According to Herodotus the beauty of Rhodopis was so great that      every Greek knew her by name.]  The highest families of Lesbos were forced to leave the country, and fled, some to Sicily, some to the Greek provinces of Italy, and others to Egypt.  Alcaeus, the greatest poet of his day, and Charaxus, the brother of that Sappho whose odes it was our Solon's last wish to learn by heart, came here to Naukratis, which had already long been the flourishing centre of commercial communication between Egypt and the rest of the world.  Charaxus saw Rhodopis, and soon loved her so passionately, that he gave an immense sum to secure her from the mercenary Xanthus, who was on the point of returning with her to his own country; Sappho wrote some biting verses, derisive of her brother and his purchase, but Alcaeus on the other hand, approved, and gave expression to this feeling in glowing songs on the charms of Rhodopis.  And now Sappho's brother, who had till then remained undistinguished among the many strangers at Naukratis, became a noted man through Rhodopis.  His house was soon the centre of attraction to all foreigners, by whom she was overwhelmed with gifts. The King Hophra, hearing of her beauty and talent, sent for her to Memphis, and offered to buy her of Charaxus, but the latter had already long, though secretly, given Rhodopis her freedom, and loved her far too well to allow of a separation.  She too, loved the handsome Lesbian and refused to leave him despite the brilliant offers made to her on all sides.  At length Charaxus made this wonderful woman his lawful wife, and continued to live with her and her little daughter Kleis in Naukratis, until the Lesbian exiles were recalled to their native land by Pittakus. He then started homeward with his wife, but fell ill on the journey, and died soon after his arrival at Mitylene.  Sappho, who had derided her brother for marrying one beneath him, soon became an enthusiastic admirer of the beautiful widow and rivalled Alcaeus in passionate songs to her praise.  After the death of the poetess, Rhodopis returned, with her little daughter, to Naukratis, where she was welcomed as a goddess.  During this interval Amasis, the present king of Egypt, had usurped the throne of the Pharaohs, and was maintaining himself in its possession by help of the army, to which caste he belonged.       [Amasis, of whom much will be said in our text, reigned 570-526 B.      C.  His name, in the hieroglyphic signs, was Aahmes or young moon      but the name by which he was commonly called was Sa-Nit \"Son of      Neith.\"  His name, and pictures of him are to be found on stones in      the fortress of Cairo, on a relief in Florence, a statue in the      Vatican, on sarcophagi in Stockholm and London, a statue in the      Villa Albani and on a little temple of red granite at Leyden.  A      beautiful bust of gray-wacke in our possession probably represents      the same king.]  As his predecessor Hophra had accelerated his fall, and brought the army and priesthood to open rebellion by his predilection for the Greek nation, and for intercourse with foreigners generally, (always an abomination in the eyes of the Egyptians), men felt confident that Amasis would return to the old ways, would rigorously exclude foreigners from the country, dismiss the Greek mercenaries, and instead of taking counsel from the Greeks, would hearken only to the commands of the priesthood. But in this, as you must see yourself, the prudent Egyptians had guessed wide of the mark in their choice of a ruler; they fell from Scylla into Charybdis.  If Hophra was called the Greeks' friend, Amasis must be named our lover.  The Egyptians, especially the priests and the army, breathe fire and flame, and would fain strangle us one and all, off hand,  This feeling on the part of the soldiery does not disturb Amasis, for he knows too well the comparative value of their and our services; but with the priests it is another and more serious matter, for two reasons: first, they possess an unbounded influence over the people; and secondly. Amasis himself retains more affection than he likes to acknowledge to us, for this absurd and insipid religion--a religion which appears doubly sacred to its adherents simply because it has existed in this eccentric land--unchanged for thousands of years.  These priests make the king's life burdensome to him; they persecute and injure us in every possible way; and indeed, if it had not been for the king's protection, I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5450"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 01 (#5)"],["body"," long ago have been a dead man.  But I am wandering from my tale!  As I said before, Rhodopis was received at Naukratis with open arms by all, and loaded with marks of favor by Amasis, who formed her acquaintance. Her daughter Kleis, as is the case with the little Sappho now--was never allowed to appear in the society which assembled every evening at her mother's house, and indeed was even more strictly brought up than the other young girls in Naukratis.  She married Glaucus, a rich Phocaean merchant of noble family, who had defended his native town with great bravery against the Persians, and with him departed to the newly-founded Massalia, on the Celtic coast.  There, however, the young couple both fell victims to the climate, and died, leaving a little daughter, Sappho. Rhodopis at once undertook the long journey westward, brought the orphan child back to live with her, spent the utmost care on her education, and now that she is grown up, forbids her the society of men, still feeling the stains of her own youth so keenly that she would fain keep her granddaughter (and this in Sappho's case is not difficult), at a greater distance from contact with our sex than is rendered necessary, by the customs of Egypt.  To my friend herself society is as indispensable as water to the fish or air to the bird.  Her house is frequented by all the strangers here, and whoever has once experienced her hospitality and has the time at command will never after be found absent when the flag announces an evening of reception.  Every Greek of mark is to be found here, as it is in this house that we consult on the wisest measures for encountering the hatred of the priests and bringing the king round to our own views.  Here you can obtain not only the latest news from home, but from the rest of the world, and this house is an inviolable sanctuary for the persecuted, Rhodopis possessing a royal warrant which secures her from every molestation on the part of the police.       [A very active and strict police-force existed in Egypt, the      organization of which is said to have owed much to Amasis' care.  We      also read in inscriptions and papyrus rolls, that a body of mounted      police existed, the ranks of which were generally filled by      foreigners in preference to natives.]  Our own songs and our own language are to be heard here, and here we take counsel on the best means for delivering Greece from the ever fresh encroachments of her tyrants.  In a word, this house is the centre of attraction for all Hellenic interests in Egypt, and of more importance to us politically, than our temple, the Hellenion itself, and our hall of commerce.  In a few minutes you will see this remarkable grandmother, and, if we should be here alone, perhaps the grandchild too; you will then at once perceive that they owe everything to their own rare qualities and not to the chances of good fortune.  Ah! there they come!  they are going towards the house.  Cannot you hear the slave-girls singing?  Now they are going in.  First let them quietly be seated, then follow me, and when the evening is over you shall say whether you repent of having come hither, and whether Rhodopis resembles more nearly a queen or a freed bond-woman.\"  The houses was built in the Grecian style.  It was a rather long, one- storied building, the outside of which would be called extremely plain in the present day; within, it united the Egyptian brilliancy of coloring with the Greek beauty of form.  The principal door opened into the entrance-hall.  To the left of this lay a large dining-room, overlooking the Nile, and, opposite to this last was the kitchen, an apartment only to be found in the houses of the wealthier Greeks, the poorer families being accustomed to prepare their food at the hearth in the front apartment.  The hall of reception lay at the other end of the entrance- hall, and was in the form of a square, surrounded within by a colonnade, into which various chambers opened.  This was the apartment devoted to the men, in the centre of which was the household fire, burning on an altar-shaped hearth of rich AEginetan metal-work.  It was lighted by an opening in the roof, which formed at the same time, an outlet for the smoke.  From this room (at the opposite end to that on which it opened into the entrance-hall), a passage, closed by a well- fastened door, led into the chamber of the women.  This was also surrounded by a colonnade within, but only on three sides, and here the female inhabitants were accustomed to pass their time, when not employed, spinning or weaving, in the rooms lying near the back or garden-door as it was termed.  Between these latter and the domestic offices, which lay on the right and left of the women's apartment, were the sleeping-rooms; these served also as places of security for the valuables of the house. The walls of the men's apartment were painted of a reddish-brown color, against which the outlines of some white marble carvings, the gift of a Chian sculptor,  stood out in sharp relief.  The floor was covered with rich carpets from Sardis; low cushions of panthers' skins lay ranged along the colonnade; around the artistically wrought hearth stood quaint Egyptian settees, and small, delicately-carved tables of Thya wood, on which lay all kinds of musical instruments, the flute, cithara and lyre. Numerous lamps of various and singular shapes, filled with Kiki oil, hung against the walls.  Some represented fire-spouting dolphins; others, strange winged monsters from whose jaws the flames issued; and these, blending their light with that from the hearth, illumined the apartment.  In this room a group of men were assembled, whose appearance and dress differed one from the other.  A Syrian from Tyre, in a long crimson robe, was talking animatedly to a man whose decided features and crisp, curly, black hair proclaimed him an Israelite.  The latter had come to Egypt to buy chariots and horses for Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah--the Egyptian equipages being the most sought after at that time.  Close to him stood three Greeks from Asia Minor, the rich folds of whose garments (for they wore the costly dress of their native city Miletus), contrasted strongly with the plain and unadorned robe of Phryxus, the deputy commissioned to collect money for the temple of Apollo at Delphi, with whom they were in earnest conversation.  Ten years before, the ancient temple had been consumed by fire; and at this time efforts were being made to build another, and a more beautiful one.  Two of the Milesians, disciples of Anaximander and Anaximenes, were staying then in Egypt, to study astronomy and the peculiar wisdom of the Egyptians at Heliopolis, and the third was a wealthy merchant and ship- owner, named Theopompus, who had settled at Naukratis.       [Anaximander of Miletus, born 611-546, was a celebrated      geometrician, astronomer, philosopher and geographer.  He was the      author of a book on natural phenomena, drew the first map of the      world on metal, and introduced into Greece a kind of clock which he      seems to have borrowed from the Babylonians.  He supposes a primary      and not easily definable Being, by which the whole world is      governed, and in which, though in himself infinite and without      limits, everything material and circumscribed has its foundation.      \"Chaotic matter\" represents in his theory the germ of all created      things, from which water, earth, animals, nereids or fish-men, human      beings &c.  have had their origin.]  Rhodopis herself was engaged in a lively conversation with two Samian Greeks: the celebrated worker in metals, sculptor and goldsmith Theodorus, and the Iambic poet Ibykus of Rhegium, who had left the court of Polykrates for a time in order to become acquainted with Egypt, and were bearers of presents to Amasis from their ruler.  Close to the fire lay Philoinus of Sybaris, a corpulent man with strongly-marked features and a sensual expression of face; he was stretched at full-length on a couch covered with spotted furs, and amused himself by playing with his scented curls wreathed with gold, and with the golden chains which fell from his neck on to the long saffron-colored robe that clothed him down to his feet.       [Sybaris was a town in Lower Italy notorious throughout the ancient      world for its luxury.  According to Strabo it was founded by      Achaeans 262.  About 510 it was conquered and destroyed by the      Crotoniates and then rebuilt under the name of Thurii.]  Rhodopis had a kind word for each of her guests, but at present she occupied herself exclusively with the two celebrated Sarnians; their talk was of art and poetry.  The fire of youth still glowed in the eyes of the Thracian woman, her tall figure was still full and unbent; her hair, though grey, was wound round her beautifully formed head in luxuriant waves, and laid together at the back in a golden net, and a sparkling diadem shone above her lofty forehead.  Her noble Greek features were pale, but still beautiful and without a wrinkle, notwithstanding her great age; indeed her small mouth with its full lips, her white teeth, her eyes so bright and yet so soft, and her nobly-formed nose and forehead would have been beauty enough for a young maiden.  Rhodopis looked younger than she really was, though she made no attempt to disavow her age.  Matronly dignity was visible in every movement, and the charm of her manner lay, not in a youthful endeavor to be pleasing, but in the effort of age to please others, considering their wishes, and at the same time demanding consideration in return.  Our two friends now presenting themselves in the hall, every eye turned upon them, and as Phanes entered leading his friend by the hand, the heartiest welcome met him from all sides; one of the Milesians indeed exclaimed: \"Now I see what it is that was wanting to our assembly.  There can be no merriment without Phanes.\"  And"]]]
