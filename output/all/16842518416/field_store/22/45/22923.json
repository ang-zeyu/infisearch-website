To save a criminal--it is unheard of:--you dared to accuse the son of your benefactor of being a corrupt judge.\"  \"And so he is,\" exclaimed Paula furious.  \"And what is more, he has inveigled the child whom you destine to be his wife into bearing false witness.  More--much more could I say, but that, even if I did not respect the mother, your husband has deserved that I should spare him.\"  \"Spare him-spare!\"  cried Neforis contemptuously.  \"You--you will spare us!  The accused will be merciful and spare the judge!  But you shall be made to speak;--aye, made to speak!  And as to what you, a slanderer, can say about false witness. . .\"  \"Your own granddaughter,\" interrupted the leech, \"will be compelled to repeat it before all the world, noble lady, if you do not moderate yourself.\"  Neforis laughed hysterically.  \"So that is the way the wind blows!\"  she exclaimed, quite beside herself.  \"The sick-room is a temple of Bacchus and Venus; and this disgraceful conduct is not enough, but you must conspire to heap shame and disgrace on this righteous house and its masters.\"  Then, resting her left hand which held the reliquary on her hip, she added with hasty vehemence:  \"So be it.  Go away; go wherever you please!  If I find you under this roof to-morrow at noon, you thankless, wicked girl, I will have you turned out into the streets by the guard.  I hate you--for once I will ease my poor, tormented heart--I loathe you; your very existence is an offence to me and brings misfortune on me and on all of us; and besides --besides, I should prefer to keep the emeralds we have left.\"  This last and cruelest taunt, which she had brought out against her better feelings, seemed to have relieved her soul of a hundred-weight of care; she drew a deep breath, and turning to Philippus, went on far more quietly and rationally:  \"As for you, Philip, my husband needs you.  You know well what we have offered you and you know George's liberal hand.  Perhaps you will think better of it, and will learn to perceive. . .\"  \"I! . . .\"  said the leech with a lofty smile.  \"Do you really know me so little?  Your husband, I am ready to admit, stands high in my esteem, and when he wants me he will no doubt send for me.  But never again will I cross this threshold uninvited, or enter a house where right is trodden underfoot, where defenceless innocence is insulted and abandoned to despair.  \"You may stare in astonishment!  Your son has desecrated his father's judgment-seat, and the blood of guiltless Hiram is on his head.--You-- well, you may still cling to your emeralds.  Paula will not touch them; she is too high-souled to tell you who it is that you would indeed do well to lock up in the deepest dungeon-cell!  What I have heard from your lips breaks every tie that time had knit between us.  I do not demand that my friends should be wealthy, that they should have any attractions or charm, any special gifts of mind or body; but we must meet on common ground: that of honorable feeling.  That you did not bring into the world, or you have lost it; and from this hour I am a stranger to you and never wish to see you again, excepting by the side of your husband when he requires me.\"  He spoke the last words with such immeasurable dignity that Neforis was startled and bereft of all self-control.  She had been treated as a wretch worthy of utter scorn by a man beneath her in rank, but whom she always regarded as one of the most honest, frank and pure-minded she had ever known; a man indispensable to her husband, because he knew how to mitigate his sufferings, and could restrain him from the abuse of his narcotic anodyne.  He was the only physician of repute, far and wide. She was to be deprived of the services of this valuable ally, to whom little Mary and many of the household owed their lives, by this Syrian girl; and she herself, sure that she was a good and capable wife and mother, was to stand there like a thing despised and avoided by every honest man, through this evil genius of her house!  It was too much.  Tortured by rage, vexation, and sincere distress, she said in a complaining voice, while the tears started to her eyes:  \"But what is the meaning of all this?  You, who know me, who have seen me ruling and caring for my family, you turn your back upon me in my own house and point the finger at me?  Have I not always been a faithful wife, nursing my husband for years and never leaving his sick-bed, never thinking of anything but how to ease his pain?  I have lived like a recluse from sheer sense of duty and faithful lose, while other wives, who have less means than I, live in state and go to entertainments.--And whose slaves are better kept and more often freed than ours?  Where is the beggar so sure of an alms as in our house, where I, and I alone, uphold piety?--And now am I so fallen that the sun may not shine on me, and that a worthy man like you should withdraw his friendship all in a moment, and for the sake of this ungrateful, loveless creature--because, because, what did you call it--because the mind is wanting in me--or what did you call it that I must have before you....?\"  \"It is called feeling,\" interrupted the leech, who was sorry for the unhappy woman, in whom he knew there was much that was good.  \"Is the word quite new to you, my lady Neforis?--It is born with us; but a firm will can elevate the least noble feeling, and the best that nature can bestow will deteriorate through self-indulgence.  But, in the day of judgment, if I am not very much mistaken, it is not our acts but our feeling that will be weighed.  It would ill-become me to blame you, but I may be allowed to pity you, for I see the disease in your soul which, like gangrene in the body. . .\"  \"What next!\"  cried Neforis.  \"This disease,\" the physician calmly went on--\"I mean hatred, should be far indeed from so pious a Christian.  It has stolen into your heart like a thief in the night, has eaten you up, has made bad blood, and led you to treat this heavily-afflicted orphan as though you were to put stocks and stones in the path of a blind man to make him fall.  If, as it would seem, my opinion still weighs with you a little, before Paula leaves your house you will ask her pardon for the hatred with which you have persecuted her for years, which has now led you to add an intolerable insult--in which you yourself do not believe--to all the rest.\"  At this Paula, who had been watching the physician all through his speech, turned to Dame Neforis, and unclasped her hands which were lying in her lap, ready to shake hands with her uncle's wife if she only offered hers, though she was still fully resolved to leave the house.  A terrible storm was raging in the lady's soul.  She felt that she had often been unkind to Paula.  That a painful doubt still obscured the question as to who had stolen the emerald she had unwillingly confessed before she had come up here.  She knew that she would be doing her husband a great service by inducing the girl to remain, and she would only too gladly have kept the leech in the house;--but then how deeply had she, and her son, been humiliated by this haughty creature!  Should she humble herself to her, a woman so much younger, offer her hand, make....  At this moment they heard the tinkle of the silver bowl, into which her husband threw a little ball when he wanted her.  His pale, suffering face rose before her inward eye, she could hear him asking for his opponent at draughts, she could see his sad, reproachful gaze when she told him to-morrow that she, Neforis, had driven his niece, the daughter of the noble Thomas, out of the house--, with a swift impulse she went towards Paula, grasping the reliquary in her left hand and holding out her right, and said in a low voice.  \"Shake hands, girl.  I often ought to have behaved differently to you; but why have you never in the smallest thing sought my love?  God is my witness that at first I was fully disposed to regard you as a daughter, but you--well, let it pass.  I am sorry now that I should--if I have distressed you.\"  At the first words Paula had placed her hand in that of Neforis.  Hers was as cold as marble, the elder woman's was hot and moist; it seemed as though their hands were typical of the repugnance of their hearts.  They both felt it so, and their clasp was but a brief one.  When Paula withdrew hers, she preserved her composure better than the governor's wife, and said quite calmly, though her cheeks were burning:  \"Then we will try to part without any ill-will, and I thank you for having made that possible.  To-morrow morning I hope I may be permitted to take leave of my uncle in peace, for I love him; and of little Mary.\"  \"But you need not go now!  On the contrary, I urgently request you to stay,\" Neforis eagerly put in.  \"George will not let you leave.  You yourself know how fond he is of you.\"  \"He has often been as a father to me,\" said Paula, and even her eyes shone through tears.  \"I would gladly have stayed with him till the end. Still, it is fixed--I must go.\"  \"And if your uncle adds his entreaties to mine?\"  \"It will be in vain.\"  Neforis took the maiden's hand in her own again, and tried with genuine anxiety to persuade her,--but Paula was firm.  She adhered to her determination to leave the governor's house in the morning.  \"But where will you find a suitable house?\"  cried Neforis.  \"A residence that will be fit for you?\"  \"That shall be my business,\" "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5520"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 04 (#2)"],["body","the physician.  \"Believe me, noble lady, it would be best for all that Paula should seek another home.  But it is to be hoped that she may decide on remaining in Memphis.\"  At this Neforis exclaimed:  \"Here, with us, is her natural home!--Perhaps God may turn your heart for your uncle's sake, and we may begin a new and happier life.\"  Paula's only reply was a shake of the head; but Neforis did not see it the metal tinkle sounded for the third time, and it was her duty to respond to its call.  As soon as she had left the room Paula drew a deep breath, exclaiming:  \"O God!  O God!  How hard it was to refrain from flinging in her teeth the crime her wicked son....  No, no; nothing should have made me do that.  But I cannot tell you how the mere sight of that woman angers me, how light-hearted I feel since I have broken down the bridge that connected me with this house and with Memphis.\"  \"With Memphis?\"  asked Philippus.  \"Yes,\" said Paula gladly.  \"I go away--away from hence, out of the vicinity of this woman and her son!--Whither?  Oh! back to Syria, or to Greece--every road is the right one, if it only takes me away from this place.\"  \"And I, your friend?\"  asked Philippus.  \"I shall bear the remembrance of you in a grateful heart.\"  The physician smiled, as though something had happened just as he expected; after a moment's reflection he said:  \"And where can the Nabathaean find you, if indeed he discovers your father in the hermit of Sinai?\"  The question startled and surprised Paula, and Philippus now adduced every argument to convince her that it was necessary that she should remain in the City of the Pyramids.  In the first place she must liberate her nurse--in this he could promise to help her--and everything he said was so judicious in its bearing on the circumstances that had to be reckoned with, and the facts actual or possible, that she was astonished at the practical good sense of this man, with whom she had generally talked only of matters apart from this world.  Finally she yielded, chiefly for the sake of her father and Perpetua; but partly in the hope of still enjoying his society.  She would remain in Memphis, at any rate for the present, under the roof of a friend of the physician's--long known to her by report--a Melchite like herself, and there await the further development of her fate.  To be away from Orion and never, never to see him again was her heartfelt wish.  All places were the same to her where she had no fear of meeting him.  She hated him; still she knew that her heart would have no peace so long as such a meeting was possible.  Still, she longed to free herself from a desire to see what his further career would be, which came over her again and again with overwhelming and terrible power.  For that reason, and for that only, she longed to go far, far away, and she was hardly satisfied by the leech's assurance that her new protector would be able to keep away all visitors whom she might not wish to receive.  And he himself, he added, would make it his business to stand between her and all intruders the moment she sent for him.  They did not part till the sun was rising above the eastern hills; as they separated Paula said:  \"So this morning a new life begins for me, which I can well imagine will, by your help, be pleasanter than that which is past.\"  And Philippus replied with happy emotion: \"The new life for me began yesterday.\"     CHAPTER XIV.  Between morning and noon Mary was sitting on a low cane seat under the sycamores which yesterday had shaded Katharina's brief young happiness; by her side was her governess Eudoxia, under whose superintendence she was writing out the Ten Commandments from a Greek catechism.  The teacher had been lulled to sleep by the increasing heat and the pervading scent of flowers, and her pupil had ceased to write.  Her eyes, red with tears, were fixed on the shells with which the path was strewn, and she was using her long ruler, at first to stir them about, and then to write the words: \"Paula,\" and \"Paula, Mary's darling,\" in large capital letters.  Now and again a butterfly, following the motion of the rod, brought a smile to her pretty little face from which the dark spirit \"Trouble\" had not wholly succeeded in banishing gladness.  Still, her heart was heavy.  Everything around her, in the garden and in the house, was still; for her grandfather's state had become seriously worse at sunrise, and every sound must be hushed.  Mary was thinking of the poor sufferer: what pain he had to bear, and how the parting from Paula would grieve him, when Katharina came towards her down the path.  The young girl did little credit to-day to her nickname of \"the water- wagtail;\" her little feet shuffled through the shelly gravel, her head hung wearily, and when one of the myriad insects, that were busy in the morning sunshine, came within her reach she beat it away angrily with her fan.  As she came up to Mary she  greeted  her with  the usual \"All hail!\"  but the child only nodded in response, and half turning her back went on with her inscription.  Katharina, however, paid no heed to this cool reception, but said in sympathetic tones:  \"Your poor grandfather is not so well, I hear?\"  Mary shrugged her shoulders.  \"They say he is very dangerously ill.  I saw Philippus himself.\"  \"Indeed?\"  said Mary without looking up, and she went on writing.  \"Orion is with him,\" Katharina went on.  \"And Paula is really going away?\"  The child nodded dumbly, and her eyes again filled with tears.  Katharina now observed how sad the little girl was looking, and that she intentionally refused to answer her.  At any other time she would not have troubled herself about this, but to-day this taciturnity provoked her, nay it really worried her; she stood straight in front of Mary, who was still indefatigably busy with the ruler, and said loudly and with some irritation:  \"I have fallen into disgrace with you, it would seem, since yesterday. Every one to his liking; but I will not put up with such bad manners, I can tell you!\"  The last words were spoken loud enough to wake Eudoxia, who heard them, and drawing herself up with dignity she said severely:  \"Is that the way to behave to a kind and welcome visitor, Mary?\"  \"I do not see one,\" retorted the child with a determined pout.  \"But I do,\" cried the governess.  \"You are behaving like a little barbarian, not like a little girl who has been taught Greek manners. Katharina is no longer a child, though she is still often kind enough to play with you.  Go to her at once and beg her pardon for being so rude.\"  \"I!\"  exclaimed Mary, and her tone conveyed the most positive refusal to obey this behest.  She sprang to her feet, and with flashing eyes, she cried:  \"We are not Greeks, neither she nor I, and I can tell you once for all that she is not my kind and welcome visitor, nor my friend any more!  We have nothing, nothing whatever to do with each other any more!\"  \"Are you gone mad?\"  cried Eudoxia, and her long face assumed a threatening expression, while she rose from her easy-chair in spite of the increasing heat, intending to capture her pupil and compel her to apologize; but Mary was more nimble than the middle-aged damsel and fled down the alley towards the river, as nimble as a gazelle.  Eudoxia began to run after her; but the heat was soon too much for her, and when she stopped, exhausted and panting, she perceived that Katharina, worthy once more of her name of \"water-wagtail,\" had flown past her and was chasing the little girl at a pace that she shuddered to contemplate.  Mary soon saw that no one but Katharina was in pursuit; she moderated her pace, and awaited her cast-off friend under the shade of a tall shrub.  In a moment Katharina was facing her; with a heightened color she seized both her hands and exclaimed passionately:  \"What was it you said?  You--you--  If I did not know what a wrong-headed little simpleton you were, I could . . . .\"  \"You could accuse me falsely!--But now, leave go of my hands or I will bite you.  And as Katharina, at this threat, released her she went on vehemently.  \"Oh!  I know you now--since yesterday!  And I tell you, once for all, I say thank you for nothing for such friends.  You ought to sink into the earth for shame of the sin you have committed.  I am only ten years old, but rather than have done such a thing I would have let myself be shut up in that hot hole with poor, innocent Perpetua, or I would have let myself be killed, as you want poor, honest Hiram to be!  Oh, shame!\"  Katharina's crimson cheeks bad turned pale at this address and, as she had no answer ready, she could only toss her head and say, with as much pride and dignity as she could assume:  \"What can a child like you know about things that puzzle the heads of grown-up people?\"  \"Grown-up people!\"  laughed Mary, who was not three inches shorter than her antagonist.  \"You must be a great deal taller before I call you grown up!  In two years time, you will scarcely be up to my eyes.\"  At this the irascible Egyptian fired up; she gave the child a slap in the face with the palm of her hand.  Mary only stood still as if petrified, and after gazing at the ground for a minute or two without a cry, she turned her back on her companion and silently went back into the shaded walk.  Katharina watched her with tears in her eyes.  She felt that Mary was justified in disapproving of what she had done the day before; for she herself had been unable to sleep and had become more and more convinced that she had acted wrongly, nay, unpardonably.  And now again she had done an inexcusable thing.  She felt that she had deeply hurt the child's feelings, and this sincerely grieved her.  She followed Mary in silence, at some little distance, like a maid-servant.  She longed to hold her back by her dress, to say something kind to her, nay, to ask her pardon. As they drew near to the spot where the governess had dropped into her chair"]]]
