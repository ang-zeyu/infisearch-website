A smile played upon her lips as she perceived young Hermas, who had already been for some time leaning motionless against the wall of the house opposite, and devouring with his gaze the figure of the beautiful young woman.  She had a facile and volatile nature.  Like the eye which retains no impression of the disabling darkness so soon as the rays of light have fallen on it, no gloom of suffering touched her so deeply that the lightest breath of a new pleasure could not blow her troubles to the winds.  Many rivers are quite different in color at their source and at their mouth, and so it was often with her tears; she began to weep for sorrow, and then found it difficult to dry her eyes for sheer overflow of mirth.  It would have been so easy for Phoebicius to make her lot a fair one! for she had a most susceptible heart, and was grateful for the smallest proofs of love, but between him and her every bond was broken.  The form and face of Hermas took her fancy; she thought he looked of noble birth in spite of his poor clothing, and when she observed that his checks were glowing, and that the hand in which he held the medicine phial trembled, she understood that he was watching her, and that the sight of her had stirred his youthful blood.  A woman--still more a woman who is pleased to please--forgives any sin that is committed for her beauty's sake, and Sirona's voice had a friendly ring in it as she bid Hermas good-morning and asked him how his father was, and whether the senator's medicine had been of service.  The youth's answers were short and confused, but his looks betrayed that he would fain have said quite other things than those which his indocile tongue allowed him to reiterate timidly.  \"Dame Dorothea was telling me last evening,\" she said kindly, \"that Petrus had every hope of your father's recovery, but that he is still very weak.  Perhaps some good wine would be of service to him--not to-day, but to-morrow or the day after.  Only come to me if you need it; we have some old Falerman in the loft, and white Mareotis wine, which is particularly good and wholesome.\"  Hermas thanked her, and as she still urged him to apply to her in all confidence, he took courage and succeeded in stammering rather than saying,--\"You are as good as you are beautiful.\"  The words were hardly spoken when the topmost stone of an elaborately constructed pile near the slaves' house fell down with a loud clatter. Sirona started and drew back from the window, the grey-hound set up a loud barking, and Hermas struck his forehead with his hand as if he were roused from a dream.  In a few instants he had knocked at the senator's door; hardly had he entered the house when Miriam's slight form passed across behind the pile of stones, and vanished swiftly and silently into the slaves' quarters. These were by this time deserted by their inhabitants, who were busy in the field, the house, or the quarries; they consisted of a few ill- lighted rooms with bare, unfinished walls.  The shepherdess went into the smallest, where, on a bed of palm-sticks, lay the slave that she had wounded, and who turned over as with a hasty hand she promptly laid a fresh, but ill-folded bandage, all askew on the deep wound in his bend.  As soon as this task was fulfilled she left the room again, placed herself behind the half open door which led into the court-yard, and, pressing, her brow against the stone door-post, looked first at the senator's house, and then at Sirona's window, while her breath came faster and faster.  A new and violent emotion was stirring her young soul; not many minutes since she had squatted peacefully on the ground by the side of the wounded man, with her head resting on her hand, and thinking of her goats on the mountain.  Then she had heard a slight sound in the court, which any one else would not have noticed; but she not only perceived it, but knew with perfect certainty with whom it originated.  She could never fail to recognize Hermas' foot-step, and it had an irresistible effect upon her.  She raised her head quickly from her hand, and her elbow from the knee on which it was resting, sprang to her feet, and went out into the yard.  She was hidden by the mill-stones, but she could see Hermas lost in admiration.  She followed the direction of his eyes and saw the same image which had fascinated his gaze--Sirona's lovely form, flooded with sunlight.  She looked as if formed out of snow, and roses, and gold, like the angel at the sepulchre in the new picture in the church.  Yes, just like the angel, and the thought flew through her mind how brown and black she was herself, and that he had called her a she-devil.  A sense of deep pain came over her, she felt as though paralyzed in body and soul; but soon she shook off the spell, and her heart began to beat violently; she had to bite her lip hard with her white teeth to keep herself from crying out with rage and anguish.  How she wished that she could swing herself up to the window on which Hermas' gaze was fixed, and clutch Sirona's golden hair and tear her down to the ground, and suck the very blood from her red lips like a vampire, till she lay at her feet as pale as the corpse of a man dead of thirst in the desert.  Then she saw the light mantle slip from Sirona's shoulders, and observed Hermas start and press his hand to his heart.  Then another impulse seized her.  It was to call to her and warn her of his presence; for even women who hate each other hold out the hand of fellowship in the spirit, when the sanctity of woman's modesty is threatened with danger.  She blushed for Sirona, and had actually opened her lips to call, when the greyhound barked and the dialogue began.  Not a word escaped her sharp ears, and when he told Sirona that she was as good as she was beautiful she felt seized with giddiness; then the topmost stone, by which she had tried to steady herself, lost its balance, its fall interrupted their conversation, and Miriam returned to the sick man.  Now she was standing at the door, waiting for Hermas.  Long, long did she wait; at last he appeared with Dorothea, and she could see that he glanced up again at Sirona; but a spiteful smile passed over her lips, for the window was empty and the fair form that he had hoped to see again had vanished.  Sirona was now sitting at her loom in the front room, whither she had been tempted by the sound of approaching hoofs.  Polykarp had ridden by on his father's fine horse, had greeted her as he passed, and had dropped a rose on the roadway.  Half an hour later the old black slave came to Sirona, who was throwing the shuttle through the warp with a skilful hand.  \"Mistress,\" cried the negress with a hideous grin; the lonely woman paused in her work, and as she looked up enquiringly the old woman gave her a rose.  Sirona took the flower, blew away the road-side dust that had clung to it, rearranged the tumbled delicate petals with her finger- tips, and said, while she seemed to give the best part of her attention to this occupation, \"For the future let roses be when you find them.  You know Phoebicius, and if any one sees it, it will be talked about.\"  The black woman turned away, shrugging her shoulders; but Sirona thought, \"Polykarp is a handsome and charming man, and has finer and more expressive eyes than any other here, if he were not always talking of his plans, and drawings, and figures, and mere stupid grave things that I do not care for!\"     CHAPTER VII.  The next day, after the sun had passed the meridian and it was beginning to grow cool, Hermas and Paulus yielded to Stephanus' wish, as he began to feel stronger, and carried him out into the air.  The anchorites sat near each other on a low block of stone, which Hermas had made into a soft couch for his father by heaping up a high pile of fresh herbs. They looked after the youth, who had taken his bow and arrows, as he went up the mountain to hunt a wild goat; for Petrus had prescribed a strengthening diet for the sick man.  Not a word was spoken by either of them till the hunter had disappeared.  Then Stephanus said, \"How much he has altered since I have been ill.  It is not so very long since I last saw him by the broad light of day, and he seems meantime to have grown from a boy into a man.  How self-possessed his gait is.\"  Paulus, looking down at the ground, muttered some words of assent.  He remembered the discus-throwing and thought to himself, \"The Palaestra certainly sticks in his mind, and he has been bathing too; and yesterday, when he came up from the oasis, he strode in like a young athlete.\"  That friendship only is indeed genuine when two friends, without speaking a word to each other, can nevertheless find happiness in being together. Stephanus and Paulus were silent, and yet a tacit intercourse subsisted between them as they sat gazing towards the west, where the sun was near its setting.  Far below them gleamed the narrow, dark blue-green streak of the Red Sea, bounded by the bare mountains of the coast, which shone in a shimmer of golden light.  Close beside them rose the toothed crown of the great mountain which, so soon as the day-star had sunk behind it, appeared edged with a riband of glowing rubies.  The flaming glow flooded the western horizon, filmy veils of mist floated across the hilly coast-line, the silver clouds against the pure sky changed their hue to the tender blush of a newly opened rose, and the undulating shore floated in the translucent violet of the amethyst.  There not a breath of air was stirring, not a sound broke the solemn stillness of the evening.  Not till the sea was taking a darker and still darker hue, till the glow on the mountain peaks and in the west had begun to die away, and the night to spread its shades over the heights and hollows, did Stephanus unclasp his folded hands and softly speak his companion's name.  Paulus started and said, speaking like a man who is aroused from a dream and who is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5495"],["title","Homo Sum â€” Volume 02 (#4)"],["body"," conscious of having heard some one speak, \"You are right; it is growing dark and cool and you must go back into the cave.\"  Stephanus offered no opposition and let himself be led back to his bed; while Paulus was spreading the sheepskin over the sick man he sighed deeply.  \"What disturbs your soul?\" asked the older man.  \"It is--it was--what good can it do me!\" cried Paulus in strong excitement.  \"There we sat, witnesses of the most glorious marvels of the Most High, and I, in shameless idolatry, seemed to see before me the chariot of Helios with its glorious winged-horses, snorting fire as they went, and Helios himself in the guise of Hermas, with gleaming golden hair, and the dancing Hours, and the golden gates of the night.  Accursed rabble of demons!--\"  At this point the anchorite was interrupted, for Hermas entered the cave, and laying a young steinbock, that he had killed, before the two men, exclaimed, \"fine fellow, and he cost me no more than one arrow.  I will light a fire at once and roast the best pieces.  There are plenty of bucks still on our mountain, and I know where to find them.\"  In about an hour, father and son were eating the pieces of meat, which had been cooked on a spit.  Paulus declined to sup with them, for after he had scourged himself in despair and remorse for the throwing of the discus, he had vowed a strict fast.  \"And now,\" cried Hermas, when his father declared himself satisfied, after seeming to relish greatly the strong meat from which he had so long abstained, \"and now the best is to come!  In this flask I have some strengthening wine, and when it is empty it will be filled afresh.\" Stephanus took the wooden beaker that his son offered him, drank a little, and then said, while he smacked his tongue to relish the after- taste of the noble juice,  \"That is something choice!--Syrian wine! only taste it, Paulus.\"  Paulus took the beaker in his hand, inhaled the fragrance of the golden fluid, and then murmured, but without putting it to his lips, \"That is not Syrian; it is Egyptian, I know it well.  I should take it to be Mareotic.\"  \"So Sirona called it,\" cried Hermas, \"and you know it by the mere smell! She said it was particularly good for the sick.\"  \"That it is,\" Paulus agreed; but Stephanus asked in surprise, \"Sirona? who is she?\"  The cave was but dimly lighted by the fire that had been made at the opening, so that the two anchorites could not perceive that Hermas reddened all over as he replied, \"Sirona?  The Gaulish woman Sirona?  Do you not know her?  She is the wife of the centurion down in the oasis.\"  \"How do you come to know her?\" asked his father.  \"She lives in Petrus' house,\" replied the lad, \"and as she had heard of your wound--\"  \"Take her my thanks when you go there to-morrow morning,\" said Stephanus. To her and to her husband too.  Is he a Gaul?\"  \"I believe so--nay, certainly,\" answered Hermas, \"they call him the lion, and he is no doubt a Gaul?\"  When the lad had left the cave the old man laid himself down to rest, and Paulus kept watch by him on his son's bed.  But Stephanus could not sleep, and when his friend approached him to give him some medicine, he said, \"The wife of a Gaul has done me a kindness, and yet the wine would have pleased me better if it had not come from a Gaul.\"  Paulus looked at him enquiringly, and though total darkness reigned in the cave, Stephanus felt his gaze and said, \"I owe no man a grudge and I love my neighbor.  Great injuries have been done me, but I have for given--from the bottom of my heart forgiven.  Only one man lives to whom I wish evil, and he is a Gaul.\"  \"Forgive him too,\" said Paulus, \"and do not let evil thoughts disturb your sleep.\"  \"I am not tired,\" said the sick man, \"and if you had gone through such things as I have, it would trouble your rest at night too.\"  \"I know, I know,\" said Paulus soothingly.  \"It was a Gaul that persuaded your wretched wife into quitting your house and her child.\"  \"And I loved, oh! how I loved Glycera!\"  groaned the old man.  \"She lived like a princess and I fulfilled her every wish before it was uttered. She herself has said a hundred times that I was too kind and too yielding, and that there was nothing left for her to wish.  Then the Gaul came to our house, a man as acrid as sour wine, but with a fluent tongue and sparkling eyes.  How he entangled Glycera I know not, nor do I want to know; he shall atone for it in hell.  For the poor lost woman I pray day and night.  A spell was on her, and she left her heart behind in my house, for her child was there and she loved Hermas so fondly; indeed she was deeply devoted to me.  Think what the spell must be that can annihilate a mother's love!  Wretch, hapless wretch that I am!  Did you ever love a woman, Paulus?\"  \"You ought to be asleep,\" said Paulus in a warning tone.  \"Who ever lived nearly half a century without feeling love!  Now I will not speak another word, and you must take this drink that Petrus has sent for you.\"  The senator's medicine was potent, for the sick man fell asleep and did not wake till broad day lighted up the cave.  Paulus was still sitting on his bed, and after they had prayed together, he gave him the jar which Hermas had filled with fresh water before going down to the oasis.  \"I feel quite strong,\" said the old man.  \"The medicine is good; I have slept well and dreamed sweetly; but you look pale and as if you had not slept.\"  \"I,\" said Paulus, \"I lay down there on the bed.  Now let me go out in the air for a moment.\"  With these words he went out of the cave.  As soon as he was out of sight of Stephanus he drew a deep breath, stretched his limbs, and rubbed his burning eyes; he felt as if there was sand gathered under their lids, for he had forbidden them to close for three days and nights.  At the same time he was consumed by a violent thirst, for neither food nor drink had touched his lips for the same length of time.  His hands were beginning to tremble, but the weakness and pain that he experienced filled him with silent joy, and he would willingly have retired into his cave and have indulged, not for the first time, in the ecstatic pain of hanging on the cross, and bleeding from five wounds, in imitation of the Saviour.  But Stephanus was calling him, and without hesitation he returned to him and replied to his questions; indeed it was easier to him to speak than to listen, for in his ears there was a roaring, moaning, singing, and piping, and he felt as if drunk with strong wine.  \"If only Hermas does not forget to thank the Gaul!\"  exclaimed Stephanus.  \"Thank--aye, we should always be thankful!\" replied his companion, closing his eyes.  \"I dreamed of Glycera,\" the old man began again.  You said yesterday that love had stirred your heart too, and yet you never were married.  You are silent?  Answer me something.\"  \"I--who called me?\" murmured Paulus, staring at the questioner with a fixed gaze.  Stephanus was startled to see that his companion trembled in every limb, he raised himself and held out to him the flask with Sirona's wine, which the other, incapable of controlling himself, snatched eagerly from his hand, and emptied with frantic thirst.  The fiery liquor revived his failing strength, brought the color to his cheeks, and lent a strange lustre to his eyes.  \"How much good that has done me!\" he cried with a deep sigh and pressing his hands on his breast.  Stephanus was perfectly reassured and repeated his question, but he almost repented of his curiosity, for his friend's voice had an utterly strange ring in it, as he answered:  \"No, I was never married--never, but I have loved for all that, and I will tell you the story from beginning to end; but you must not interrupt me, no not once.  I am in a strange mood--perhaps it is the wine.  I had not drunk any for so long; I had fasted since--since but it does not matter.  Be silent, quite silent, and let me tell my story.\"  Paulus sat down on Hermas' bed; he threw himself far back, leaned the back of his head against the rocky wall of the cavern, through whose doorway the daylight poured, and began thus, while he gazed fixedly into vacancy, \"What she was like?--who can, describe her?  She was tall and large like Hera, and yet not proud, and her noble Greek face was lovely rather than handsome.  \"She could no longer have been very young, but she had eyes like those of a gentle child.  I never knew her other than very pale; her narrow forehead shone like ivory under her soft brown hair; her beautiful hands were as white as her forehead-hands that moved as if they themselves were living and inspired creatures with a soul and language of their own. When she folded them devoutly together it seemed as if they were putting up a mute prayer.  She was pliant in form as a young palm-tree when it bends, and withal she had a noble dignity, even on the occasion when I first saw her.  \"It was a hideous spot, the revolting prison-hall of Rhyakotis.  She wore only a threadbare robe that had once been costly, and a foul old woman followed her about--as a greedy rat might pursue an imprisoned dove--and loaded her with abusive language.  She answered not a word, but large heavy tears flowed slowly over her pale cheeks and down on to her hands, which she kept crossed on her bosom.  Grief and anguish spoke from her eyes, but no vehement passion deformed the regularity of her features. She knew how to endure even ignominy with grace, and what words the raging old woman poured out upon her!  \"I had long since been baptized, and all the prisons were open to me, the rich Menander, the brother-in-law of the prefect--those prisons in which under Maximin so many Christians were destined to be turned from the true faith.  \"But she did not belong to us.  Her eye met mine, and I signed my forehead with the cross, but she did not respond to the sacred sign.  The guards led away the old woman, and she drew back into a dark corner, sat down, and covered her face with her hands. "]]]
