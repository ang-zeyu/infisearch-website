It seemed as if a portion of her lord's pride were reflected there.  The frivolous waiting-woman sank involuntarily on her knees, as her eyes, full of smiling admiration, met the radiant glance of Nitetis,--of the woman who was beloved by the most powerful of men.  For a few moments Nitetis gazed on the girl, lying in the dust at her feet; but soon shook her beautiful head, and blushing for shame, raised her kindly, kissed her forehead, gave her a gold bracelet, and then, perceiving her letter on the ground, told her she wished to be alone. Mandane ran, rather than walked, out of the room in her eagerness to show the splendid present she had just received to the inferior attendants and slaves; and Nitetis, her eyes glistening and her heart beating with excess of happiness, threw herself on to the ivory chair which stood before her dressing-table, uttered a short prayer of thanksgiving to her favorite Egyptian goddess, the beautiful Hathor, kissed the gold chain which Cambyses had given her after plunging into the water for her ball, then her letter from home, and rendered almost over-confident by her great happiness, began to unroll it, slowly sinking back into the purple cushions as she did so and murmuring: \"How very, very happy I am!  Poor letter, I am sure your writer never thought Nitetis would leave you a quarter of an hour on the ground unread.\"  In this happy mood she began to read, but her face soon grew serious and when she had finished, the letter fell once more to the ground.  Her eyes, whose proud glance had brought the waiting-maid to her feet, were dimmed by tears; her head, carried so proudly but a few minutes before, now lay on the jewels which covered the table.  Tears rolled down among the pearls and diamonds, as strange a contrast as the proud tiara and its unhappy, fainting wearer.  The letter read as follows:  \"Ladice the wife of Amasis and Queen of Upper and Lower Egypt, to her daughter Nitetis, consort of the great King of Persia.  \"It has not been our fault, my beloved daughter, that you have remained so long without news from home.  The trireme by which we sent our letters for you to AEgae was detained by Samian ships of war, or rather pirate vessels, and towed into the harbor of Astypalaea.  \"Polykrates' presumption increases with the continual success of his undertakings, and since his victory over the Lesbians and Milesians, who endeavored to put a stop to his depredations, not a ship is safe from the attacks of his pirate vessels.  \"Pisistratus is dead,\" but his sons are friendly to Polykrates.  Lygdamis is under obligations to him, and cannot hold his own in Naxos without Samian help.  He has won over the Amphiktyonic council to his side by presenting the Apollo of Delos with the neighboring island of Rhenea. His fifty-oared vessels, requiring to be manned by twenty-thousand men, do immense damage to all the seafaring nations; yet not one dares to attack him, as the fortifications of his citadel and his splendid harbor are almost impregnable, and he himself always surrounded by a well- drilled body-guard.  \"Through the traders, who followed the fortunate Kolxus to the far west, and these pirate ships, Samos will become the richest of islands and Polykrates the most powerful of men, unless, as your father says, the gods become envious of such unchanging good fortune and prepare him a sudden and speedy downfall.  \"In this fear Amasis advised Polykrates as his old friend, to put away from him the thing he held dearest, and in such a manner that he might be sure of never receiving it again.  Polykrates adopted this advice and threw into the sea, from the top of the round tower on his citadel, his most valuable signet-ring, an unusually large sardonyx held by two dolphins.  This ring was the work of Theodorus, and a lyre, the symbol of the ruler, was exquisitely engraved on the stone.\"  \"Six days later, however, the ring was found by Polykrates' cooks in the body of a fish.  He sent us news at once of this strange occurrence, but instead of rejoicing your father shook his grey head sadly, saying: 'he saw now it was impossible for any one to avoid his destiny!'  On the same day he renounced the friendship of Polykrates and wrote him word, that he should endeavor to forget him in order to avoid the grief of seeing his friend in misfortune.  \"Polykrates laughed at this message and returned the letters his pirates had taken from our trireme, with a derisive greeting.  For the future all your letters will be sent by Syria.  \"You will ask me perhaps, why I have told you this long story, which has so much less interest for you than any other home news.  I answer: to prepare you for your father's state.  Would you have recognized the cheerful, happy, careless Amasis in that gloomy answer to his Samian friend?  \"Alas, my husband has good reason to be sad, and since you left us, my own eyes have seldom been free from tears.  My time is passed either at the sick-bed of your sister or in comforting your father and guiding his steps; and though much in need of sleep I am now taking advantage of night to write these lines.  \"Here I was interrupted by the nurses, calling me to your sister Tachot, your own true friend.  \"How often the dear child has called you in her feverish delirium; and how carefully she treasures your likeness in wax, that wonderful portrait which bears evidence not only of the height to which Greek art has risen, but of the master hand of the great Theodorus.  To-morrow it will be sent to AEgina, to be copied in gold, as the soft wax becomes injured from frequent contact with your sister's burning hands and lips.  \"And now, my daughter, you must summon all your courage to hear what I need all my strength of mind to tell-the sad story of the fate which the gods have decreed for our house.  \"For three days after you left us Tachot wept incessantly.  Neither our comforting words nor your father's good advice--neither offerings nor prayers--could avail to lessen her grief or divert her mind.  At last on the fourth day she ceased to weep and would answer our questions in a low voice, as if resigned; but spent the greater part of every day sitting silently at her wheel.  Her fingers, however, which used to be so skilful, either broke the threads they tried to spin, or lay for hours idle in her lap, while she was lost in dreams.  Your father's jokes, at which she used to laugh so heartily, made no impression on her, and when I endeavored to reason with her she listened in anxious suspense.  \"If I kissed her forehead and begged her to control herself, she would spring up, blushing deeply, and throw herself into my arms, then sit down again to her wheel and begin to pull at the threads with almost frantic eagerness; but in half an hour her hands would be lying idle in her lap again and her eyes dreamily fixed, either on the ground, or on some spot in the air.  If we forced her to take part in any entertainment, she would wander among the guests totally uninterested in everything that was passing.  \"We took her with us on the great pilgrimage to Bubastis, during which the Egyptians forget their usual gravity, and the shores of the Nile look like a great stage where the wild games of the satyrs are being performed by choruses, hurried on in the unrestrained wantonness of intoxication. When she saw thus for the first time an entire people given up to the wildest and most unfettered mirth and enjoyment, she woke up from her silent brooding thoughts and began to weep again, as in the first days after you went away.  \"Sad and perplexed, we brought our poor child back to Sais.  \"Her looks were not those of a common mortal.  She grew thinner, and we all fancied, taller; her complexion was white, and almost transparent, with a tender bloom on her cheek, which I can only liken to a young rose- leaf or the first faint blush of sunrise.  Her eyes are still wonderfully clear and bright.  It always seems to me as if they looked beyond the heaven and earth which we see.  \"As she continued to suffer more and more from heat in the head and hands, while her tender limbs often shivered with a slight chill, we sent to Thebes for Thutmes, the most celebrated physician for inward complaints.  \"The experienced priest shook his head on seeing your sister and foretold a serious illness.  He forbade her to spin or to speak much.  Potions of all kinds were given her to drink, her illness was discussed and exorcised, the stars and oracles consulted, rich presents and sacrifices made to the gods.  The priest of Hathor from the island of Philae sent us a consecrated amulet, the priest of Osiris in Abydos a lock of hair from the god himself set in gold, and Neithotep, the high-priest of our own guardian goddess, set on foot a great sacrifice, which was to restore your sister to health.  \"But neither physicians nor charms were of any avail, and at last Neithotep confessed that Tachot's stars gave but little ground for hope. Just then, too, the sacred bull at Memphis died and the priests could discover no heart in his entrails, which they interpreted as prognosticating evil to our country.  They have not yet succeeded in finding a new Apis, and believe that the gods are wroth with your father's kingdom.  Indeed the oracle of Buto has declared that the Immortals will show no favor to Egypt, until all the temples that have been built in the black land for the worship of false gods are destroyed and their worshippers banished.       [Egypt was called by its ancient inhabitants Cham, the black,      or black-earthed.]  \"These evil omens have proved, alas, only too true.  Tachot fell ill of a dreadful fever and lay for nine days hovering between life and death; she is still so weak "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5454"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 05 (#6)"],["body","she must be carried, and can move neither hand nor foot.  \"During the journey to Bubastis, Amasis' eyes, as so often happens here, became inflamed.  Instead of sparing them, he continued to work as usual from sunrise until mid-day, and while your sister was so ill he never left her bed, notwithstanding all our entreaties.  But I will not enter into particulars, my child.  His eyes grew worse, and on the very day which brought us the news of your safe arrival in Babylon, Amasis became totally blind.  \"The cheerful, active man has become old, gloomy and decrepit since that day.  The death of Apis, and the unfavorable constellations and oracles weigh on his mind; his happy temper is clouded by the unbroken night in which he lives; and the consciousness that he cannot stir a step alone causes indecision and uncertainty.  The daring and independent ruler will soon become a mere tool, by means of which the priests can work their will.  \"He spends hours in the temple of Neith, praying and offering sacrifices; a number of workmen are employed there in building a tomb for his mummy, and the same number at Memphis in levelling the temple which the Greeks have begun building to Apollo.  He speaks of his own and Tachot's misfortunes as a just punishment from the Immortals.  \"His visits to Tachot's sick-bed are not the least comfort to her, for instead of encouraging her kindly, he endeavors to convince her that she too deserves punishinent from the gods.  He spends all his remarkable eloquence in trying to persuade her, that she must forget this world entirely and only try to gain the favor of Osiris and the judges of the nether world by ceaseless prayers and sacrifices.  In this manner he only tortures our poor sick child, for she has not lost her love of life. Perhaps I have still too much of the Greek left in me for a queen of Egypt; but really, death is so long and life so short, that I cannot help calling even wise men foolish, when they devote the half of even this short term to a perpetual meditation on the gloomy Hades.  \"I have just been interrupted again.  Our great physician, Thutmes, came to enquire after his patient.  He gives very little hope, and seems surprised that her delicate frame has been able to resist death so long. He said yesterday: 'She would have sunk long ago if not kept up by her determined will, and a longing which gives her no rest.  If she ceased to care for life, she could allow death to take her, just as we dream ourselves asleep.  If, on the other hand, her wish could be gratified, she might, (though this is hardly probable) live some years yet, but if it remain but a short time longer unfulfilled, it will certainly wear her to death.  \"Have you any idea for whom she longs so eagerly?  Our Tachot has allowed herself to be fascinated by the beautiful Bartja, the brother of your future husband.  I do not mean to say by this that he has employed magic, as the priest Ameneman believes, to gain her love; for a youth might be far less handsome and agreeable than Bartja, and yet take the heart of an innocent girl, still half a child.  But her passionate feeling is so strong, and the change in her whole being so great, that sometimes I too am tempted to believe in the use of supernatural influence.  A short time before you left I noticed that Tachot was fond of Bartja.  Her distress at first we thought could only be for you, but when she sank into that dreamy state, Ibykus, who was still at our court, said she must have been seized by some strong passion.  \"Once when she was sitting dreaming at her wheel, I heard him singing softly Sappho's little love-song to her:                     \"I cannot, my sweet mother,                     Throw shuttle any more;                     My heart is full of longing,                     My spirit troubled sore,                     All for a love of yesterday                     A boy not seen before.\"                 [Sappho ed. Neue XXXII.  Translation from Edwin Arnold's                Poets of Greece.]  \"She turned pale and asked him: 'Is that your own song?'  \"'No,' said he, 'Sappho wrote it fifty years ago.'  \"'Fifty years ago,' echoed Tachot musingly.  \"'Love is always the same,' interrupted the poet; 'women loved centuries ago, and will love thousands of years to come, just as Sappho loved fifty years back.'  \"The sick girl smiled in assent, and from that time I often heard her humming the little song as she sat at her wheel.  But we carefully avoided every question, that could remind her of him she loved.  In the delirium of fever, however, Bartja's name was always on her burning lips. When she recovered consciousness we told her what she had said in her delirium; then she opened her heart to me, and raising her eyes to heaven like a prophetess, exclaimed solemnly: 'I know, that I shall not die till I have seen him again.'  \"A short time ago we had her carried into the temple, as she longed to worship there again.  When the service was over and we were crossing the temple-court, we passed some children at play, and Tachot noticed a little girl telling something very eagerly to her companions.  She told the bearers to put down the litter and call the child to her.  \"'What were you saying?' she asked the little one.  \"I was telling the others something about my eldest sister.'  \"'May I hear it too?' said Tachot so kindly, that the little girl began at once without fear: \"Batau, who is betrothed to my sister, came back from Thebes quite unexpectedly yesterday evening.  Just as the Isis-star was rising, he came suddenly on to our roof where Kerimama was playing at draughts with my father; and he brought her such a beutiful goldeng bridal wreath.'       [Among the Egyptians the planet Venus bore the name of the goddess      Isis.  Pliny II. 6.  Arist  De mundo II. 7.  Early monuments prove      that they were acquainted with the identity of the morning and      evening star.  Lepsius, Chronologie p. 94.]  \"Tachot kissed the child and gave her her own costly fan.  When we were at home again she smiled archly at me and said: 'You know, mother dear, that the words children say in the temple-courts are believed to be oracles.'  So, if the little one spoke the truth, he must come; and did not you hear that he is to bring the bridal-wreath?  O mother, I am sure, quite sure, that I shall see him again.'  \"I asked her yesterday if she had any message for you, and she begged me to say that she sent you thousands of kisses, and messages of love, and that when she was stronger she meant to write, as she had a great deal to tell you.  She has just brought me the little note which I enclose; it is for you alone, and has cost her much fatigue to write.  \"But now I must finish my letter, as the messenger has been waiting for it some time.  \"I wish I could give you some joyful news, but sadness and sorrow meet me whichever way I turn.  Your brother yields more and more to the priests' tyranny, and manages the affairs of state for your poor blind father under Neithotep's guidance.  \"Amasis does not interfere, and says it matters little whether his place be filled a few days sooner or later by his successor.  \"He did not attempt to prevent Psamtik from seizing the children of Phanes in Rhodopis' house, and actually allowed his son to enter into a negotiation with the descendants of those two hundred thousand soldiers, who emigrated to Ethiopia in the reign of Psamtik I. on account of the preference shown to the Greek mercenaries.  In case they declared themselves willing to return to their native land, the Greek mercenaries were to have been dismissed.  The negotiation failed entirely, but Psamtik's treatment of the children of Phanes has given bitter offence to the Greeks.  Aristomachus threatened to leave Egypt, taking with him ten thousand of his best troops, and on hearing that Phanes' son had been murdered at Psamtik's command applied for his discharge.  From that time the Spartan disappeared, no one knows whither; but the Greek troops allowed themselves to be bribed by immense sums and are still in Egypt.  \"Amasis said nothing to all this, and looked on silently from the midst of his prayers and sacrifices, while your brother was either offending every class of his subjects or attempting to pacify them by means beneath the dignity of a ruler.  The commanders of the Egyptian and Greek troops, and the governors of different provinces have all alike assured me that the present state of things is intolerable.  No one knows what to expect from this new ruler; he commands today the very thing, which he angrily forbade the day before.  Such a government must soon snap the beautiful bond, which has hitherto united the Fgyptian people to their king.  \"Farewell, my child, think of your poor friend, your mother; and forgive your parents when you hear what they have so long kept secret from you. Pray for Tachot, and remember us to Croesus and the young Persians whom we know.  Give a special message too from Tachot to Bartja; I beg him to think of it as the last legacy of one very near death.  If you could only send her some proof, that he has not forgotten her!  Farewell, once more farewell and be happy in your new and blooming home.\"     CHAPTER XVI.  Sad realities follow bright anticipations nearly as surely as a rainy day succeeds a golden sunrise.  Nitetis had been so happy in the thought of reading the very letter, which poured such bitter drops of wormwood into her cup of happiness.  One beautiful element in her life, the remembrance of her dear home and the companions of her happy childhood, had been destroyed in one moment, as if by the touch of a magician's wand.  She sat there in her royal purple, weeping, forgetful of everything but her mother's grief, her father's misfortunes and her sister's illness. The joyful future, full of love, joy, and happiness, which had been beckoning her forward only a few minutes before, had vanished.  Cambyses' chosen bride forgot"]]]
