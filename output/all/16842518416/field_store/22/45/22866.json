Such a Soul as hers is of small account even in a less exclusive Heaven than yours is.\"  \"Take back those words!\"  cried Marcus, beside himself and clenching his fist.  \"But that is just like you!  Your impure eyes and heart defile purity itself, and see spots even in the sun.  Nothing is too bad for a 'singing girl,' I know.  But that is just the marrow of the matter; it is from that very curse that I mean to save her.  If you can accuse her of anything, speak; if not, and if you do not want to appear a base slanderer in my eyes, take back the words you have just spoken!\"  \"Oh! I take them back of course,\" said Demetrius indifferently.  \"I know nothing of your beauty beyond what she has herself said to me and you and Cynegius and his Secretaries--with her pretty, saucy eyes.  But the language of the eye, they say, is not always to be depended on; so take it as unsaid.  And, if I understood you rightly, you do not even know where the singers are hiding?  If you have no objection, I will help you to seek them out.\"  \"That is as you please,\" answered Marcus hotly.  \"All your mockery will not prevent my doing my duty.\"  \"Very right, very right,\" said his brother.  \"Perhaps this damsel is unlike all the other singing-girls with whom I used so often to spend a jolly evening in my younger days.  Once, at Barca, I saw a white raven-- but perhaps after all it was only a dove.  Your opinion, in this case, is at any rate better founded than mine, for I never thought twice about the girl and you did.--But it is late; till to-morrow, Marcus.\"  The brothers parted for the night, but when Demetrius found himself alone he walked up and down the room, shaking his head doubtfully.  Presently, when his body-slave came in to pack for him, he called out crossly:  \"Let that alone--I shall stay in Alexandria a few days longer.\"  Marcus could not go to bed; his brother's scorn had shaken his soul to the foundations.  An inward voice told him that his more experienced senior might be right, but at the same time he hated and contemned himself for listening to its warnings at all.  The curse that rested on Dada was that of her position; she herself was pure--as pure as a lily, as pure as the heart of a child, as pure as the blue of her eyes and the ring of her voice.  He would obey the angel's behest!  He could and he must save her!  In the greatest excitement he went out of the house, through the great gate, into the Canopic way, and walked on.  As he was about to turn down a side street to go to the lake he found the road stopped by soldiers, for this street led past the prefect's house where Cynegius, the Emperor's emissary, was staying; he had come, it was said, to close the Temples, and the excited populace had gathered outside the building, during the afternoon, to signify their indignant disapprobation.  At sundown an armed force had been called out and had dispersed the crowd; but it was by another road that the young Christian at length made his way to the shore.     CHAPTER VII.  While Marcus was restlessly wandering on the shore of Mareotis, dreaming of Dada's image and arranging speeches of persuasive eloquence by which to touch her heart and appeal to her soul, silence had fallen on the floating home of the singers.  A light white mist, like a filmy veil--a tissue of clouds and moonbeams--hung over the lake.  Work was long since over in the ship-yard, and the huge skeletons of the unfinished ships threw weird and ghostly shadows on the silvered strand-forms like black visions of crayfish, centipedes, or enormous spiders.  From the town there came not a sound; it lay in the silence of intoxicated sleep.  The Roman troops had cleared the streets, the lights were dead in every house, and in all the alleys and squares; only the moon shone over the roofs of Alexandria, while the blazing beacon of the light-house on the north-eastern point of the island of Pharos shone like a sun through the darkness.  In a large cabin in the stern of the vessel lay the two girls, on soft woollen couches and covered with rugs.  Agne was gazing wide-eyed into the darkness; Dada had long been asleep, but she breathed painfully and her rosy lips were puckered now and then as if she were in some distress. She was dreaming of the infuriated mob who had snatched the garland from her hair--she saw Marcus suddenly interfere to protect her and rescue her from her persecutors--then she thought she had fallen off the gangway that led from the land to the barge, and was in the water while old Damia stood on the shore and laughed at her without trying to help her.  Night generally brought the child sound sleep or pleasant dreams, but now one hideous face after another haunted her.  And yet the evening had brought her a great pleasure.  Not long after their return from their walk the steward had come down to the boat and brought her a very beautiful dress, with greetings from his old mistress; he had at the same time brought an Egyptian slave-woman, well skilled in all the arts of the toilet, who was to wait upon her so long as she remained in Alexandria.  Dada had never owned such a lovely dress!  The under-robe was of soft sea-green bombyx silk, with a broad border, delicately embroidered, of a garland of roses and buds.  The peplos was of the same color and decorated to match; costly clasps of mosaic, representing full-blown roses and set in oval gold settings, fastened it on the shoulders.  In a separate case were a gold girdle, a bracelet, also of gold, in the shape of a snake, a gold crescent with a rose, like those on the shoulder-clasps, in its centre, and a metal mirror of spotless lustre.  The slave, a middle-aged woman with a dark cunning face, had helped her to put on this new garment; she had also insisted on dressing her hair, and all the time had never ceased praising the charms that nature had bestowed on her young mistress, with the zeal of a lover.  Agne had looked on smiling, good-naturedly handing the slave the pins and ribbands she had needed, and sincerely rejoicing in her companion's beauty and delight.  At last Dada had made her appearance in the deckroom and was greeted by many an Ah! and Oh! of admiration from the men of the party, including Medius, the singer whom Karnis had met in the street.  Even Herse, who had received her quite disagreeably on her return from the city, could not suppress a smile of kindly approval, though she shook her finger at her saying:  \"The old lady has set her heart on turning your head completely I see. All that is very pretty, but all the good it will do will be to rouse spiteful tongues.  Remember, Dada, that you are my sister's child; I promise you I shall not forget it, and I shall keep my eye upon you.\"  Orpheus made haste to light every lamp and taper, of which there were plenty, for the barge was handsomely furnished, and when Dada was plainly visible in the brilliant illumination Karnis exclaimed:  \"You look like a senator's daughter!  Long live the Fair!\"  She ran up to him and kissed him; but when Orpheus walked all round her, examining the fineness of the tissue and the artistic finish of the clasps, and even turned the snake above her round elbow, she sharply bid him let her be.  Medius, a man of the age of Karnis who had formerly been his intimate companion, never took his eyes off the girl, and whispered to the old musician that Dada would easily carry off the palm for beauty in Alexandria, and that with such a jewel in his keeping he might recover wealth and position and by quite honest means.  At his suggestion she then assumed a variety of attitudes; she stood as Hebe, offering nectar to the gods--as Nausicae, listening to the tale of Odysseus--and as Sappho, singing to her lyre.  The girl was delighted at all this, and when Medius, who kept close to her, tried to persuade her to perform in a similar manner in the magical representations at the house of Posidonius, before a select company of spectators, she clapped her hands exclaiming:  \"You took me all round the city, father, and as your reward I should like to earn back your pretty vineyards, I should stand like this, you know, and like this--to be stared at.  I only hope I might not be seized with a sudden impulse to make a face at the audience.  But if they did not come too close I really might . . .\"  \"You could do no better than to play the parts that Posidonius might give you,\" interrupted Medius.  \"His audiences like to see good daemons, the kindly protecting spirits, and so forth.  You would have to appear among clouds behind a transparent veil, and the people would hail you with acclamations or even raise their hands in adoration.\"  All this seemed to Dada perfectly delightful, and she was on the point of giving her hand to Medius in token of agreement, when her eye caught the anxious gaze of the young Christian girl who stood before her with a deep flush on her face.  Agne seemed to be blushing for her.  The color rushed to her own cheeks, and shortly saying: \"No--after all, I think not,\" she turned her back on the old man and threw herself on the cushions close to where the wine-jug was standing.  Medius now began to besiege Karnis and Herse with arguments, but they refused all his offers as they intended quitting Alexandria in a few days, so he had no alternative but to submit.  Still, he did not altogether throw up the game, and to win Dada's consent, at any rate, he made her laugh with a variety of comical pranks and showed her some ingenious conjuring tricks, and ere long their floating home echoed with merriment, with the clinking of wine-cups and with songs, in which even Agne was obliged to take part.  Medius did not leave till near midnight and Herse then sent them all to bed.  As soon as the slave had undressed her young mistress and left the girls alone, Dada threw herself into the arms of Agne who was on the point of getting into bed, and kissed her vehemently, exclaiming: \"You "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5502"],["title","Serapis â€” Volume 02 (#5)"],["body","much-- so much better than I!  How is that you always know what is right?\"  Then she lay down; but before she fell asleep she once more spoke to Agne: \"Marcus will find us out, I am certain,\" she said, \"and I should really like to know what he has to say to me.\"  In a few minutes sleep had sealed her eyes, but the Christian girl lay awake; her thoughts would not rest, and Sleep, who the night before had taken her to his heart, to-night would not come near her pillow; so much to agitate and disturb her soul had taken place during the day.  She had often before now been a silent spectator of the wild rejoicings of the musician's family, and she had always thought of these light- hearted creatures as spendthrifts who waste all their substance in a few days to linger afterwards through years of privation and repentance. Troubled, as she could not fail to be, as to the eternal salvation of these lost souls, though happy in her own faith, she had constantly turned for peace to her Saviour and always found it; but to-night it was not so, for a new and unexpected temptation had sprung up for her in the house of Porphyrius.  She had heard Gorgo sing again, and joined her own voice with hers. Dirges, yearning hymns, passionate outpourings in praise of the mighty and beautiful divinity had filled her ear and stirred her soul with an ecstatic thrill, although she knew that they, were the composition of heathen poets and had first been sung to the harmony of lutes by reprobate idolaters.  And yet, and yet they had touched her heart, and moved her soul to rapture, and filled her eyes with tears.  She could not but confess to herself that she could have given no purer, sweeter, or loftier expression to her own woes, thankfulness, aspirations, and hopes of ever lasting life and glory, than this gifted creature had given to the utterance of her idolatry.  Surprise, unrest, nay, some little jealousy had been mingled with her delight at Gorgo's singing.  How was it that this heathen could feel and utter emotions which she had always conceived of as the special privilege of the Christian, and, for her own part, had never felt so fervently as in the hours when she had drawn closest to her Lord?  Were not her own sentiments the true and right ones; had her intercourse with these heathens tainted her?  This doubt disturbed her greatly; it must be based on something more than mere self-torture, for she had not once thought of asking to whom the two-part hymn, with its tender appeal, was addressed, when Karnis had first gone through it with her alone; nor even subsequently, when she had sung it with Gorgo--timidly at first, more boldly the second time, and finally without a mistake, but carried completely away by the beauty and passion of the emotions it expressed.  She knew now, for Karnis himself had told her.  It was the Lament of Isis for her--lost husband and brother--oh that horrible heathen confusion!-- The departed Osiris.  The wailing widow, who called on him to return with \"the silent speech of tears,\" was that queen of the idolater's devils whose shameful worship her father had often spoke of with horror.  Still, this dirge was so true and noble, so penetrated with fervent, agonized grief, that it had gone to her heart.  The sorrowing Mother of God, Mary herself, might thus have besought the resurrection of her Son; just thus must the \"God-like maid\"--as she was called in the Arian confession of her father--have uttered her grief, her prayers, and her longings.  But it was all a heathen delusion, all the trickery and jugglery of the Devil, though she had failed to see through it, and had given herself up to it, heart and soul.  Nay, worse! for after she had learnt that Gorgo was to represent Isis and she herself Nephthys, the sister of the divine pair, she had opposed the suggestion but feebly, even though she knew that they were to sing the hymn together in the Temple of Isis; and when Gorgo had clasped her in her arms with sisterly kindness, begging her not to spoil her plans but to oblige her in this, she had not repulsed the tempter with firm decision, but merely asked for time to think it over.  How indeed could she have found the heart to refuse the noble girl, whose beauty and voice had so struck and fascinated her, when she flung her arms round her neck, looked into her eyes and earnestly besought her:  \"Do it for my sake, to please me.  I do not ask you to do anything wicked.  Pure song is acceptable to every god.  Think of your lament, if you like, as being for your own god who suffered on the cross.  But I like singing with you so much; say yes.  Do not refuse, for my sake!\"  She had thrown her arms so gladly, so much too gladly round the heathen lady--for she had a loving heart and no one else had ever made it a return in kind--and clinging closely to her she had said:  \"As you will; I will do whatever you like.\"  Then Orpheus, too, had urged her to oblige Gorgo, and himself, and all of them; and it had seemed almost impossible to refuse the first request that the modest youth--to whom she would willingly have granted anything and everything--had ever made.  Still, she had held back; and in her anxious bewilderment, not daring to think or act, she had tried every form of excuse and postponement.  She would probably have been awkward enough about this, but Gorgo was content to press her no further, and when, after leaving the house, she had summoned up courage to refuse to enter the Temple of Isis, Karnis had only said: \"Be thankful that this gifted lady, the favorite of the Muses, should think you worthy to sing with her.  We will see about the rest by-and-bye.\"  Now, in the watches of the sleepless night, she saw clearly the abyss above which she was standing.  She, like Judas, was on the point of betraying her Saviour; not indeed for money, but in obedience to the transient sound of an earthly voice, for the pleasure of exercising her art, to indulge a hastily-formed liking; nay, perhaps because it satisfied her childish vanity to find herself put on an equality with a lady of rank and wealth, and matched with a singer who had roused Karnis and Orpheus to such ardent admiration.  She was an enigma to herself; while passages out of the Bible crowded on her memory to reproach her conscience.  There lay Dada's embroidered dress.  Worn for the first time this day, in a month it would be unpresentably shabby and then, ere long, flung aside as past wearing.  Like this--just like this--was every earthly pleasure, every joy of this brief existence.  Alas, she certainly was not happy here in Karnis' sense of the word; but in the other world there were joys eternal, and she had only to deny herself the petty enjoyments of this life to secure unfailing and everlasting happiness in the next.  There she would find an endless flow of all her soul could desire, there perhaps she might be allowed to cool the lips of Gorgo, as Lazarus cooled those of the rich man.  She was quite clear now what her answer would be to-morrow, and, firmly resolved not to allow herself to think of singing in the Temple of Isis, she at last fell asleep just as the light began to dawn in the east.  She did not wake till late, and it was with downcast eyes and set lips that she went with Karnis and Orpheus to the house of Porphyrius.     CHAPTER VIII.  When the steward went to summons the musicians to his master's house he had again had no bidding for Dada, and she was very indignant at being left behind.  \"That old cornsack's daughter,\" she said, \"was full of her airs, and would have nothing to say to them excepting to make use of them for her own purposes!\"  If she had not been afraid of being thought intrusive she would have acted on old Damia's invitation to visit her frequently, and have made her appearance, in defiance of Gorgo, dropping like a shooting-star into the midst of their practising.  It never occurred to her to fancy that the young lady had any personal dislike to her, for, though she might be ignored and forgotten, who had ever had any but a kind word for her.  At the same time she assumed the right of feeling that \"she could not bear\" the haughty Gorgo, and as the party set out she exclaimed to Agne, \"Well, you need not kill her for me, but at any rate, I send her no greeting; it is a shame that I should be left to mope alone with Herse.  Do not be surprised if you find me turned to a stark, brown mummy--for we are in Egypt, you know, the land of mummies. I bequeath my old dress to you, my dear, for I know you would never put on the new one.  If you bewail me as you ought I will visit you in a dream, and put a sugarplum in your mouth--a cake of ambrosia such as the gods eat.  You are not even leaving me Papias to tease!\"  For in fact Agne's little brother, dressed in a clean garment, was to be taken to Gorgo who had expressed a wish to see him.  When they had all left the ship Dada soon betrayed how superficial her indignation had been; for, presently spying through the window of the cabin the young cavalry officer's grey-bearded father, she sprang up the narrow steps--barefoot as she was accustomed to be when at home--and threw herself on a cushion to lean over the gunwale of the upper deck, which was shaded by a canvas awning, to watch the ship-yard and the shore-path.  Before she had begun to weary of this occupation the waiting-slave, who had been up to the house to put various matters in order, came back to the vessel, and squatting down at her feet was ready to give her all the information she chose to require.  Dada's first questions naturally related to Gorgo.  The young mistress, said the slave, had already dismissed many suitors, the sons of the greatest families of Alexandria, and if her suspicions--those of Sachepris, the slave--were well founded, all for the sake of the old shipbuilder's son, whom she had known from childhood and who was now an officer in the Imperial guard.  However, as she opined, this"]]]
