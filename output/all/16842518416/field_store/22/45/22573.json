Count them up, Will--the lads we have drunk with aforetime. There was Greene, now----\"  Shakespeare bent his head for tally.  \"--I can see his poor corse staring up at the rafters: there on the shoemaker's bed, with a chaplet of laurel askew on the brow. The woman meant it kindly, poor thing!... She forgot to close his eyes, though. With my own fingers I closed 'em, and borrowed two penny pieces of her for weights. 'Twas the first dead flesh I had touched, and I feel it now.... But George Peele was worse, ten times worse. I forget if you saw him?\"  Again Shakespeare bent his head.  \"And poor Kit? You saw Kit, I know ... with a hole below the eye, they told me, where the knife went through. And that was our Kit, our hope, pride, paragon, our Daphnis. Damnation, and this is art! Didst hear that blotch-faced youngster, that Scotchman, how he prated of it, laying down the law?\"  \"That Jonson, Tom, is a tall poet, or will be.\"  \"The devil care I! Tall poet or not, he is no Englishman and understands not the race. Art is not for us. We have dreamed dreams, thou and I: and thy dreams are coming to glory. But the last dream of a true Englishman is to own a few good English acres and die respected in a dear, if narrow, round. Dear Will, there is more in this than greed. There is the call of the land, which is home. For me--thou knowest--I had ne'er the gift of saving. My bolt is shot, or almost: two years at farthest must see the end of me. But when thou rememberest, bethink thee that I understood the call. Wilt guess what I am writing, now at the last? A great book--a sound book--and all of the red-herring! Ay, the red-herring, staple of my own Yarmouth. Canst never, as an inland man, rise to the virtues of that fish nor to the merit of my handling. But I have read some pages of it to my neighbours there and I learn from their approving looks that I shall die respected. Yet I, too, forgot and dreamed of art....\"         *       *       *       *       *  On the Bankside at the foot of Paris Garden Stairs, deserted now of watermen, a youth sat with his teeth chattering.  Above, while he tried to clench his teeth, a window opened stealthily. There was a heavy splash on the tideway, and the window shut to, softly as it had opened. He watched. He was past fear. The body bobbed once to the surface, half a furlong below the spreading, fading circles thrown to the foot of Paris Garden Stairs. It did not rise again. The Bankside knew its business.  A heavy footfall came down the steps to the landing-stage.  \"A glorious night!\"  The apprentice watched the river.  \"A glorious night! A night to remember! Tell me, lad, have I made good my promises, or have I not?\"  \"They rise thrice before sinking, I have always heard,\" twittered the lad.  \"What the devil art talking of? Here, take my cloak, if thou feelest the chill. The watermen here ply by shifts, and we shall hail a boat anon to take us over. Meanwhile, if thou hast eyes, boy, look on the river--see the masts there, below bridge, the sun touching them!--see the towers yonder, in the gold of it!    _London, thou art the flower of cities all!_  --Eh, lad?\"  The sun's gold, drifted through the fog, touched the side of a small row-boat nearing the farther shore. Behind, and to right and left along Bankside, a few guitars yet tinkled. Across the tide came wafted the voices of London's Christmas bells.     YE SEXES, GIVE EAR!  A STORY FROM A CHIMNEY-CORNER   A good song, and thank 'ee, Sir, for singing it! Time was, you'd never miss hearing it in these parts, whether 'twas feast or harvest-supper or Saturday night at the public. A virtuous good song, too; and the merry fellow that made it won't need to cast about and excuse himself when the graves open and he turns out with his fiddle under his arm. My own mother taught it to me; the more by token that she came from Saltash, and \"Ye sexes, give ear\" was a terrible favourite with the Saltash females by reason of Sally Hancock and her turn-to with the press-gang. Hey? You don't tell me, after singing the song, that you never heard tell of Sally Hancock? Well, if----I Here, take and fill my mug, somebody!  'Tis an instructive tale, too.... This Sally was a Saltash fishwoman, and you must have heard of _them_ at all events. There was Bess Rablin, too, and Mary Kitty Climo, and Thomasine Oliver, and Long Eliza that married Treleaven the hoveller, and Pengelly's wife Ann; these made up the crew Sally stroked in the great race. And besides these there was Nan Scantlebury--she took Bess Rablin's oar the second year, Bess being a bit too fond of lifting her elbow, which affected her health--and Phemy Sullivan, an Irishwoman, and Long Eliza's half-sister Charlotte Prowse, and Rebecca Tucker, and Susan Trebilcock, that everybody called \"Apern,\" and a dozen more maybe: powerful women every one, and proud of it. The town called them Sally Hancock's Gang, she being their leader, though they worked separate, shrimping, cockling, digging for lug and long-lining, bawling fish through Plymouth streets, even a hovelling job at times--nothing came amiss to them, and no weather. For a trip to Plymouth they'd put on sea-boots belike, or grey stockings and clogs: but at home they went bare-legged, and if they wore anything 'pon their heads 'twould be a handkerchief, red or yellow, with a man's hat clapped a-top; coats too, and guernseys like men's, and petticoats a short few inches longer; for I'm telling of that back-along time when we fought Boney and while seafaring men still wore petticoats--in these parts at any rate. Well, that's how Sally and her mates looked on week-a-days, and that's how they behaved: but you must understand that, though rough, they were respectable; the most of them Wesleyan Methodists; and on Sundays they'd put on bonnet and sit in chapel, and drink their tea afterwards and pick their neighbours to pieces just like ordinary Christians. Sal herself was a converted woman, and greatly exercised for years about her husband's condition, that kept a tailor's shop half-way down Fore Street and scoffed at the word of Grace; though he attended public worship, partly to please his customers and partly because his wife wouldn't let him off.  The way the fun started was this. In June month of the year 'five (that's the date my mother always gave) the Wesleyans up at the London Foundry sent a man down to preach a revival through Cornwall, starting with Saltash. He had never crossed the Tamar before, but had lived the most of his life near Wolverhampton--a bustious little man, with a round belly and a bald head and high sense of his own importance. He arrived on a Saturday night, and attended service next morning, but not to take part in it: he \"wished to look round,\" he said. So the morning was spent in impressing everyone with his shiny black suit of West-of-England broadcloth and his beautiful neckcloth and bunch of seals. But in the evening he climbed the pulpit, and there Old Nick himself, that lies in wait for preachers, must have tempted the poor fellow to preach on Womanly Perfection, taking his text from St. Paul.  He talked a brave bit about subjection, and how a woman ought to submit herself to her husband, and keep her head covered in places of public worship. And from that he passed on to say that 'twas to this beautiful submissiveness women owed their amazing power for good, and he, for his part, was going through Cornwall to tackle the women-folk and teach 'em this beautiful lesson, and he'd warrant he'd leave the whole county a sight nearer righteousness than he found it. With that he broke out into axtempory prayer for our dear sisters, as he called them, dusted his knees, and gave out the hymn, all as pleased as Punch.  Sal walked home from service alongside of her husband, very thoughtful. Deep down in the bottom of his heart he was afraid of her, and she knew it, though she made it a rule to treat him kindly. But knowing him for a monkey-spirited little man, and spiteful as well as funny, you could never be sure when he wouldn't break out. To-night he no sooner gets inside his own door than says he with a dry sort of a chuckle--  \"Powerful fine sermon, this evenin'. A man like that makes you _think_.\"  \"Ch't!\" says Sally, tossing her bonnet on to the easy-chair and groping about for the tinder-box.  \"Sort of doctrine that's badly needed in Saltash,\" says he. \"But I'd ha' bet 'twould be wasted on you. Well, well, if you can't understand logic, fit and fetch supper, that's a good soul!\"  \"Ch't!\" said Sally again, paying no particular attention, but wondering what the dickens had become of the tinder-box. She couldn't find it on the chimney-piece, so went off to fetch the kitchen one.  When she came back, there was my lord seated in the easy-chair--that was hers by custom--and puffing away at his pipe--a thing not allowed until after supper. You see, he had collared the tinder-box when he first came in, and had hidden it from her.  Sal lit the lamp, quiet-like. \"I s'pose you know you're sittin' 'pon my best bonnet?\" said she.  This took him aback. He jumped up, found the bonnet underneath him sure enough, and tossed it on to the table. \"Gew-gaws!\" said he, settling himself down again and puffing. \"Gew-gaws and frippery! That man'll do good in this country; he's badly wanted.\"  Sal patted the straw of her bonnet into something like shape and smoothed out the ribbons. \"If it'll make you feel like a breadwinner,\" said she, \"there's a loaf in the bread-pan. The cold meat and pickles are under lock and key, and we'll talk o' them later.\" She fitted the bonnet on and began to tie the strings.  \"You don't tell me, Sarah, that you mean to go gadding out at this time of the evening?\" cries he, a bit chapfallen, for he knew she carried the keys in an under-pocket beneath her skirt.  \"And you don't suppose,\" answers she, \"that I can spare the time to watch you play-actin' in my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54274"],["title","Shakespeare's Christmas, and other stories (#8)"],["body","chair? No, no, my little man! Sit there and amuse yourself: what _you_ do don't make a ha'porth of odds. But there's others to be considered, and I'm going to put an end to this nonsense afore it spreads.\"  The time of the year, as I've told you, was near about midsummer, when a man can see to read print out-of-doors at nine o'clock. Service over, the preacher had set out for a stroll across the hayfields towards Trematon, to calm himself with a look at the scenery and the war-ships in the Hamoaze and the line of prison-hulks below, where in those days they kept the French prisoners. He was strolling back, with his hands clasped behind him under his coat-tails, when on the knap of the hill, between him and the town, he caught sight of a bevy of women seated among the hay-pooks--staid middle-aged women, all in dark shawls and bonnets, chattering there in the dusk. As he came along they all rose up together and dropped him a curtsey.  \"Good evenin', preacher dear,\" says Sally, acting spokeswoman; \"and a very fine night for the time of year.\"  I reckon that for a moment the preacher took a scare. Monstrous fine women they were to be sure, looming up over him in the dimmety light, and two or three of them tall as Grenadiers. But hearing himself forespoken so pleasantly, he came to a stand and peered at them through his gold-rimmed glasses.  \"Ah, good evening, ladies!\" says he. \"You are, I presoom, members of the society that I've just had the privilege of addressin'?\" And thereupon they dropped him another curtsey altogether. \"Like me, I dare say you find the scent of the new-mown hay refreshingly grateful. And what a scene! What a beautiful porch, so to speak, to the beauties of Cornwall!--beauties of which I have often heard tell.\"  \"Yes, Sir,\" answers Sal demurely. \"Did you ever hear tell, too, why Old Nick never came into Cornwall?\"  \"H'm--ha--some proverbial saying, no doubt? But--you will excuse me--I think we should avoid speaking lightly of the great Enemy of Mankind.\"  \"He was afraid,\" pursued Sal, \"of being put into a pie.\" She paused at that, giving her words time to sink in. The preacher didn't notice yet awhile that Long Eliza Treleaven and Thomasine Oliver had crept round a bit and planted themselves in the footpath behind him.  After a bit Sal let herself go in a comfortable smile, and says she, in a pretty, coaxing voice, \"Sit yourself down, preacher, that's a dear: sit yourself down, nice and close, and have a talk!\"  The poor fellow fetched a start at this. He didn't know, of course, that everyone's \"my dear\" in Cornwall, and I'm bound to say I've seen foreigners taken aback by it--folks like commercial travellers, not given to shyness as a rule.  \"You'll excuse me, Madam.\"  \"No, I won't: not if you don't come and sit down quiet. Bless the man, I'm not going to eat 'ee--wouldn't harm a hair of your dear little head, if you had any! What? You refuse?\"  \"How dare you, Madam!\" The preacher drew himself up, mighty dignified. \"How dare you address me in this fashion!\"  \"I'm addressin' you for your good,\" answered Sally. \"We've been talkin' over your sermon, me and my friends here--all very respectable women--and we've made up our minds that it won't do. We can't have it 'pon our conscience to let a gentleman with your views go kicking up Jack's delight through the West. We owe something more to our sex. 'Wrestlin'' with 'em--that was one of your expressions--'wrestlin' with our dear Cornish sisters'!\"  \"In the spirit--a figure of speech,\" explained the poor man, snappy-like.  Sal shook her head. \"They know all about wrestlin' down yonder. I tell you, 'twon't do. You're a well-meaning man, no doubt; but you're terribly wrong on some points. You'd do an amazing amount of mischief if we let you run loose. But we couldn't take no such responsibility--indeed we couldn't: and the long and short of it is, you've got to go.\"  She spoke these last words very firmly. The preacher flung a glance round and saw he was in a trap.  \"Such shameless behaviour----\" he began.  \"You've got to go back,\" repeated Sally, nodding her head at him. \"Take my advice and go quiet.\"  \"I can only suppose you to be intoxicated,\" said he, and swung round upon the path where Thomasine Oliver stood guard. \"Allow me to pass, Madam, if you please!\"  But here the mischief put it into Long Eliza to give his hat a flip by the brim. It dropped over his nose and rolled away in the grass. \"Oh, what a dear little bald head!\" cried Long Eliza; \"I declare I must kiss it or die!\" She caught up a handful of hay as he stooped, and--well, well, Sir! Scandalous, as you say! Not a word beyond this would any of them tell: but I do believe the whole gang rolled the poor man in the hay and took a kiss off him--\"making sweet hay,\" as 'tis called. 'Twas only known that he paid the bill for his lodging a little after dawn next morning, took up his bag, and passed down Fore Street towards the quay. Maybe a boat was waiting for him there: at all events, he was never seen again--not on this side of Tamar.  Sal went back, composed as you please, and let herself in by the front-door. In the parlour she found her man still seated in the easy-chair and smoking, but sulky-like, and with most of his monkey-temper leaked out of him.  \"What have you been doin', pray?\" asks he.  Sal looked at him with a twinkle. \"Kissin',\" says she, untying her bonnet: and with that down she dropped on a chair and laughed till her sides ached.         *       *       *       *       *  Her husband ate humble pie that night before ever he set fork in the cold meat: and for some days after, though she kept a close eye on him, he showed no further sign of wanting to be lord of creation. \"Nothing like promptness,\" thought Sally to herself. \"If I hadn't taken that nonsense in hand straight off, there's no telling where it wouldn't have spread.\" By the end of the week following she had put all uneasiness out of her head.  Next Saturday--as her custom was on Saturdays--she traded in Plymouth, and didn't reach home until an hour or more past nightfall, having waited on the Barbican for the evening fish-auction, to see how prices were ruling. 'Twas near upon ten o'clock before she'd moored her boat, and as she went up the street past the Fish and Anchor she heard something that fetched her to a standstill.  She stood for a minute, listening; then walked in without more ado, set down her baskets in the passage, and pushed open the door of the bar-room. There was a whole crowd of men gathered inside, and the place thick with tobacco-smoke. And in the middle of this crew, with his back to the door, sat her husband piping out a song--    _Ye sexes, give ear to my fancy;     In the praise of good women I sing,   It is not of Doll, Kate, or Nancy,     The mate of a clown nor a King--         With my fol-de-rol, tooral-i-lay!_    _Old Adam, when he was creyated,     Was lord of the Universe round;   Yet his happiness was not complated     Until that a helpmate he'd found._    _He had all things for food that was wanting,     Which give us content in this life;   He had horses and foxes for hunting,     Which many love more than a wife,--         With my fol-de-rol, tooral-i-lay!_  He had sung so far and was waving his pipestem for the chorus when the company looked up and saw Sal straddling in the doorway with her fists on her hips. The sight daunted them for a moment: but she held up a finger, signing them to keep the news to themselves, and leaned her shoulder against the door-post with her eyes steady on the back of her husband's scrag neck. His fate was upon him, poor varmint, and on he went, as gleeful as a bird in a bath--    _He'd a garden so planted by natur'     As man can't produce in this life;   But yet the all-wise great Creaytor     Perceived that he wanted a wife.         With his fol-de-rol, tooral-i-lay!_  \"You chaps might be a bit heartier with the chorus,\" he put in. \"A man would almost think you was afraid of your wives overhearin'--    _Old Adam was laid in a slumber,     And there he lost part of his side;   And when he awoke in great wonder     He beyeld his beyeautiful bride._  _With_ my fol-de-rol, tooral--why, whatever's wrong with 'ee all? You're as melancholy as a passel of gib-cats.\" [And with that he caught the eye of a man seated opposite, and slewed slowly round to the door.]  I tell you that even Sal was forced to smile, and the rest, as you may suppose, rolled to and fro and laughed till they cried. But when the landlord called for order and they hushed themselves to hear more, the woman had put on a face that made her husband quake.  \"Go ahead, Hancock!\" cried one or two. \"'With transport he gazèd----' Sing away, man!\"  \"I will not,\" said the tailor, very sulky. \"This here's no fit place for women: and a man has his feelin's. I'm astonished at you, Sarah--I reely am. The wife of a respectable tradesman!\" But he couldn't look her straight in the face.  \"Why, what's wrong with the company?\" she asks, looking around. \"Old, young, and middle-aged, I seem to know them all for Saltash men: faults, too, they have to my knowledge: but it passes me what I need to be afeared of. And only a minute since you was singing that your happiness wouldn't be completed until that a helpmate you'd found. Well, you've found her: so sing ahead and be happy.\"  \"I will not,\" says he, still stubborn.  \"Oh, yes you will, my little man,\" says she in a queer voice, which made him look up and sink his eyes again.  \"Well,\" says he, making the best of it, \"to please the missus, naybours, we'll sing the whole randigal through. And after that, Sarah\"--here he pretended to look at her like one in command--\"you'll walk home with me straight.\"  \"You may lay to that,\" Sal promised him: and so, but in no very firm voice, he pitched to the song again--    _With transport he gazèd upon her,     His happiness then was complate;   And he blessèd the marvellous forethought     That on him bestowed such a"]]]
