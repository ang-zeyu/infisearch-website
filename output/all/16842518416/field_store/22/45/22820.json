Trembling in every slender limb, shaken with grief, and overwhelmed with sorrow, the slight shepherdess stood before him, and he felt as if he must help her.  His passionate pity cut him to the heart and fettered his by no means ready tongue.  As he could find no word of comfort, he took the water-gourd in his left hand and laid his right, in which he had hitherto held it, gently on her shoulder.  She started, but she let him do it; he felt her warm breath; he would have drawn back, but he felt as if he could not; he hardly knew whether she was crying or laughing while she let his hand rest on her black waving hair.  She did not move.  At last she raised her head, her eyes flashed into his, and at the same instant he felt two slender arms clasped round his neck.  He felt as if a sea were roaring in his ears, and fire blazing in his eyes.  A nameless anguish seized him; he tore himself violently free, and with a loud cry as if all the spirits of hell were after him he fled up the steps that led from the well, and heeded not that his water-jar was shattered into a thousand pieces against the rocky wall.  She stood looking after him as if spell-bound.  Then she struck her slender hand against her forehead, threw herself down by the spring again and stared into space; there she lay motionless, only her mouth continued to twitch.  When the shadow of the palm-tree grew longer she sprang up, called her goats, and looked up, listening, to the rock-steps by which he had vanished; the twilight is short in the neighborhood of the tropics, and she knew that she would be overtaken by the darkness on the stony and fissured road down the valley if she lingered any longer.  She feared the terrors of the night, the spirits and demons, and a thousand vague dangers whose nature she could not have explained even to herself; and yet she did not stir from the spot nor cease listening and waiting for his return till the sun had disappeared behind the sacred mountain, and the glow in the west had paled.  All around was as still as death, she could hear herself breathe, and as the evening chill fell she shuddered with cold.  She now heard a loud noise above her head.  A flock of wild mountain goats, accustomed to come at this hour to quench their thirst at the spring, came nearer and nearer, but drew back as they detected the presence of a human being.  Only the leader of the herd remained standing on the brink of the ravine, and she knew that he was only awaiting her departure to lead the others down to drink.  Following a kindly impulse, she was on the point of leaving to make way for the animals, when she suddenly recollected Hermas's threat to drive her from the well, and she angrily picked up a stone and flung it at the buck, which started and hastily fled.  The whole herd followed him.  Miriam listened to them as they scampered away, and then, with her head sunk, she led her flock home, feeling her way in the darkness with her bare feet.     CHAPTER II.  High above the ravine where the spring was lay a level plateau of moderate extent, and behind it rose a fissured cliff of bare, red-brown porphyry.  A vein of diorite of iron-hardness lay at its foot like a green ribbon, and below this there opened a small round cavern, hollowed and arched by the cunning hand of nature.  In former times wild beasts, panthers or wolves, had made it their home; it now served as a dwelling for young Hermas and his father.  Many similar caves were to be found in the holy Fountain, and other anchorites had taken possession of the larger ones among them.  That of Stephanus was exceptionally high and deep, and yet the space was but small which divided the two beds of dried mountain herbs where, on one, slept the father, and on the other, the son.  It was long past midnight, but neither the younger nor the elder cave- dweller seemed to be sleeping.  Hermas groaned aloud and threw himself vehemently from one side to the other without any consideration for the old man who, tormented with pain and weakness, sorely needed sleep. Stephanus meanwhile denied himself the relief of turning over or of sighing, when he thought he perceived that his more vigorous son had found rest.  \"What could have robbed him of his rest, the boy who usually slept so soundly, and was so hard to waken?\"  \"Whence comes it,\" thought Stephanus, \"that the young and strong sleep so soundly and so much, and the old, who need rest, and even the sick, sleep so lightly and so little.  Is it that wakefulness may prolong the little term of life, of which they dread the end?  How is it that man clings so fondly to this miserable existence, and would fain slink away, and hide himself when the angel calls and the golden gates open before him!  We are like Saul, the Hebrew, who hid himself when they came to him with the crown!  My wound burns painfully; if only I had a drink of water.  If the poor child were not so sound asleep I might ask him for the jar.\"  Stephanus listened to his son and would not wake him, when he heard his heavy and regular breathing.  He curled himself up shivering under the sheep-skin which covered only half his body, for the icy night wind now blew through the opening of the cave, which by day was as hot as an oven.  Some long minutes wore away; at last he thought he perceived that Hermas had raised himself.  Yes, the sleeper must have wakened, for he began to speak, and to call on the name of God.  The old man turned to his son and began softly, \"Do you hear me, my boy?\"  \"I cannot sleep,\" answered the youth.  \"Then give me something to drink,\" asked Stephanus, \"my wound burns intolerably.\"  Hermas rose at once, and reached the water-jar to the sufferer.  \"Thanks, thanks, my child,\" said the old man, feeling for the neck of the jar.  But he could not find it, and exclaimed with surprise: \"How damp and cold it is--this is clay, and our jar was a gourd.\"  \"I have broken it,\"  interrupted  Hermas,  \"and Paulus lent me his.\"  \"Well, well,\" said Stephanus anxious for drink; he gave the jar back to his son, and waited till he had stretched himself again on his couch. Then he asked anxiously: \"You were out a long time this evening, the gourd is broken, and you groaned in your sleep.  Whom did you meet?\"  \"A demon of hell,\" answered Hermas.  \"And now the fiend pursues me into our cave, and torments me in a variety of shapes.\"  \"Drive it out then and pray,\" said the old man gravely.  \"Unclean spirits flee at the name of God.\"  \"I have called upon Him,\" sighed Hermas, \"but in vain; I see women with ruddy lips and flowing Hair, and white marble figures with rounded limbs and flashing eyes beckon to me again and again.\"  \"Then take the scourge,\" ordered the father, \"and so win peace.\"  Hermas once more obediently rose, and went out into the air with the scourge; the narrow limits of the cave did not admit of his swinging it with all the strength of his arms.  Very soon Stephanus heard the whistle of the leathern thongs through the stillness of the night, their hard blows on the springy muscles of the man and his son's painful groaning.  At each blow the old man shrank as if it had fallen on himself.  At last he cried as loud as he was able \"Enough--that is enough.\"  Hermas came back into the cave, his father called him to his couch, and desired him to join with him in prayer.  After the 'Amen' he stroked the lad's abundant hair and said, \"Since you went to Alexandria, you have been quite another being.  I would I had withstood bishop Agapitus, and forbidden you the journey.  Soon, I know, my Saviour will call me to himself, and no one will keep you here; then the tempter will come to you, and all the splendors of the great city, which after all only shine like rotten wood, like shining snakes and poisonous purple-berries--\"  \"I do not care for them,\" interrupted Hermas, \"the noisy place bewildered and frightened me.  Never, never will I tread the spot again.\"  \"So you have always said,\" replied Stephanus, \"and yet the journey quite altered you.  How often before that I used to think when I heard you laugh that the sound must surely please our Father in Heaven.  And now? You used to be like a singing bird, and now you go about silent, you look sour and morose, and evil thoughts trouble your sleep.\"  \"That is my loss,\" answered Hermas.  \"Pray let go of my hand; the night will soon be past, and you have the whole live-long day to lecture me in.\"  Stephanus sighed, and Hermas returned to his couch.  Sleep avoided them both, and each knew that the other was awake, and would willingly have spoken to him, but dissatisfaction and defiance closed the son's lips, and the father was silent because he could not find exactly the heart-searching words that he was seeking.  At last it was morning, a twilight glimmer struck through the opening of the cave, and it grew lighter and lighter in the gloomy vault; the boy awoke and rose yawning.  When he saw his father lying with his eyes open, he asked indifferently, \"Shall I stay here or go to morning worship?\"  \"Let us pray here together,\" begged the father.  \"Who knows how long it may yet be granted to us to do so?  I am not far from the day that no evening ever closes.  Kneel down here, and let me kiss the image of the Crucified.\"  Hermas did as his father desired him, and as they were ending their song of praise, a third voice joined in the 'Amen.'  \"Paulus!\" cried the old man.  \"The  Lord be praised! pray look to my wound then.  The arrow head seeks to work some way out, and it burns fearfully.\"  \"The new comer, an anchorite, who for all clothing wore a shirt-shaped coat of brown undressed linen, and a sheep-skin, examined the wound carefully, and laid some herbs on it, murmuring meanwhile some pious texts.  \"That is much easier,\" sighed the old man.  \"The Lord has mercy on me for your goodness' sake.\"  \"My goodness?  I am a vessel of wrath,\" replied Paulus, with a deep, rich; sonorous voice, and his peculiarly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5494"],["title","Homo Sum â€” Volume 01 (#3)"],["body"," blue eyes were raised to heaven as if to attest how greatly men were deceived in him.  Then he pushed the bushy grizzled hair, which hung in disorder over his neck and face, out of his eyes, and said cheerfully: \"No man is more than man, and many men are less.  In the ark there were many beasts, but only one Noah.\"  \"You are the Noah of our little ark,\" replied Stephanus.  \"Then this great lout here is the elephant,\" laughed Paulus.  \"You are no smaller than he,\" replied Stephanus.  \"It is a pity this stone roof is so low, else we might have measured ourselves,\" said Paulus.  \"Aye! if Hermas and I were as pious and pure as we are tall and strong, we should both have the key of paradise in our pockets.  You were scourging yourself this night, boy; I heard the blows. It is well; if the sinful flesh revolts, thus we may subdue it.\"  \"He groaned heavily and could not sleep,\" said Stephanus.  \"Aye, did he indeed!\" cried Paulus to the youth, and held his powerful arms out towards him with clenched fists; but the threatening voice was loud rather than terrible, and wild as the exceptionally big man looked in his sheepskin, there was such irresistible kindliness in his gaze and in his voice, that no one could have believed that his wrath was in earnest.  \"Fiends of hell had met him,\" said Stephanus in excuse for his son, \"and I should not have closed an eye even without his groaning; it is the fifth night.\"  \"But in the sixth,\" said Paulus, \"sleep is absolutely necessary.  Put on your sheep-skin, Hermas; you must go down to the oasis to the Senator Petrus, and fetch a good sleeping-draught for our sick man from him or from Dame Dorothea, the deaconess.  Just look! the youngster has really thought of his father's breakfast--one's own stomach is a good reminder. Only put the bread and the water down here by the couch; while you are gone I will fetch some fresh--now, come with me.\"  \"Wait a minute, wait,\" cried Stephanus.  \"Bring a new jar with you from the town, my son.  You lent us yours yesterday, Paulus, and I must--\"  \"I should soon have forgotten it,\" interrupted the other.  \"I have to thank the careless fellow, for I have now for the first time discovered the right way to drink, as long as one is well and able.  I would not have the jar back for a measure of gold; water has no relish unless you drink it out of the hollow of your hand!  The shard is yours.  I should be warring against my own welfare, if I required it back.  God be praised! the craftiest thief can now rob me of nothing save my sheepskin.\"  Stephanus would have thanked him, but he took Hermas by the hand, and led him out into the open air.  For some time the two men walked in silence over the clefts and boulders up the mountain side.  When they had reached a plateau, which lay on the road that led from the sea over the mountain into the oasis, he turned to the youth, and said:  \"If we always considered all the results of our actions there would be no sins committed.\"  Hermas looked at him enquiringly, and Paulus went on, \"If it had occurred to you to think how sorely your poor father needed sleep, you would have lain still this night.\"  \"I could not,\" said the youth sullenly.  \"And you know very well that I scourged myself hard enough.\"  \"That was quite right, for you deserved a flogging for a misconducted boy.\"  Hermas looked defiantly at his reproving friend, the flaming color mounted to his cheek: for he remembered the shepherdess's words that he might go and complain to his nurse, and he cried out angrily:  \"I will not let any one speak to me so; I am no longer a child.\"  \"Not even your father's?\"  asked Paulus, and he looked at the boy with such an astonished and enquiring air, that Hermas turned away his eyes in confusion.  \"It is not right at any rate to trouble the last remnant of life of that very man who longs to live for your sake only.\"  \"I should have been very willing to be still, for I love my father as well as any one else.\"  \"You do not beat him,\" replied Paulus, \"you carry him bread and water, and do not drink up the wine yourself, which the Bishop sends him home from the Lord's supper; that is something certainly, but not enough by a long way.\"  \"I am no saint!\"  \"Nor I neither,\" exclaimed Paulus, \"I am full of sin and weakness.  But I know what the love is which was taught us by the Saviour, and that you too may know.  He suffered on the cross for you, and for me, and for all the poor and vile.  Love is at once the easiest and the most difficult of attainments.  It requires sacrifice.  And you?  How long is it now since you last showed your father a cheerful countenance?\"  \"I cannot be a hypocrite.\"  \"Nor need you, but you must love.  Certainly it is not by what his hand does but by what his heart cheerfully offers, and by what he forces himself to give up that a man proves his love.\"  \"And is it no sacrifice that I waste all my youth here?\"  asked the boy.  Paulus stepped back from him a little way, shook his matted head, and said, \"Is that it?  You are thinking of Alexandria!  Ay! no doubt life runs away much quicker there than on our solitary mountain.  You do not fancy the tawny shepherd girl, but perhaps some pretty pink and white Greek maiden down there has looked into your eyes?\"  \"Let me alone about the women,\" answered Hermas, with genuine annoyance. \"There are other things to look at there.\"  The youth's eyes sparkled as he spoke, and Paulus asked, not without interest, \"Indeed?\"  \"You know Alexandria better than I,\" answered Hermas evasively. \"You were born there, and they say you had been a rich young man.\"  \"Do they say so?\"  said Paulus.  \"Perhaps they are right; but you must know that I am glad that nothing any longer belongs to me of all the vanities that I possessed, and I thank my Saviour that I can now turn my back on the turmoil of men.  What was it that seemed to you so particularly tempting in all that whirl?\"  Hermas hesitated.  He feared to speak, and yet something urged and drove him to say out all that was stirring his soul.  If any one of all those grave men who despised the world and among whom he had grown up, could ever understand him, he knew well that it would be Paulus; Paulus whose rough beard he had pulled when he was little, on whose shoulders he had often sat, and who had proved to him a thousand times how truly he loved him.  It is true the Alexandrian was the severest of them all, but he was harsh only to himself.  Hermas must once for all unburden his heart, and with sudden decision he asked the anchorite:  \"Did you often visit the baths?\"  \"Often?  I only wonder that I did not melt away and fall to pieces in the warm water like a wheaten loaf.\"  \"Why do you laugh at that which makes men beautiful?\"  cried Hermas hastily.  \"Why may Christians even visit the baths in Alexandria, while we up here, you and my father and all anchorites, only use water to quench our thirst?  You compel me to live like one of you, and I do not like being a dirty beast.\"  \"None can see us but the Most High,\" answered Paulus, \"and for him we cleanse and beautify our souls.\"  \"But the Lord gave us our body too,\" interrupted Hermas.  \"It is written that man is the image of God.  And we!  I appeared to myself as repulsive as a hideous ape when at the great baths by the Gate of the Sun I saw the youths and men with beautifully arranged and scented hair and smooth limbs that shone with cleanliness and purification.  And as they went past, and I looked at my mangy sheepfell, and thought of my wild mane and my arms and feet, which are no worse formed or weaker than theirs were, I turned hot and cold, and I felt as if some bitter drink were choking me.  I should have liked to howl out with shame and envy and vexation. I will not be like a monster!\"  Hermas ground his teeth as he spoke the last words, and Paulus looked uneasily at him as he went on: \"My body is God's as much as my soul is, and what is allowed to the Christians in the city--\"  \"That we nevertheless may not do,\" Paulus interrupted gravely.  \"He who has once devoted himself to Heaven must detach himself wholly from the charm of life, and break one tie after another that binds him to the dust.  I too once upon a time have anointed this body, and smoothed this rough hair, and rejoiced sincerely over my mirror; but I say to you, Hermas--and, by my dear Saviour, I say it only because I feel it, deep in my heart I feel it--to pray is better than to bathe, and I, a poor wretch, have been favored with hours in which my spirit has struggled free, and has been permitted to share as an honored guest in the festal joys of Heaven!\"  While he spoke, his wide open eyes had turned towards Heaven and had acquired a wondrous brightness.  For a short time the two stood opposite each other silent and motionless; at last the anchorite pushed the hair from off his brow, which was now for the first time visible.  It was well-formed, though somewhat narrow, and its clear fairness formed a sharp contrast to his sunburnt face.  \"Boy,\" he said with a deep breath, \"you know not what joys you would sacrifice for the sake of worthless things.  Long ere the Lord, calls the pious man to Heaven, the pious has brought Heaven down to earth in himself.\"  Hermas well understood what the anchorite meant, for his father often for hours at a time gazed up into Heaven in prayer, neither seeing nor hearing what was going on around him, and was wont to relate to his son, when he awoke from his ecstatic vision, that he had seen the Lord or heard the angel-choir.  He himself had never succeeded in bringing himself into such a state, although Stephanus had often compelled him to remain on his knees praying with him for many interminable hours.  It often happened that the old man's feeble flame of life had threatened to become altogether extinct after these deeply soul-stirring exercises, and Hermas would gladly have forbidden him giving himself up to such hurtful emotions, for he loved his father; but"]]]
