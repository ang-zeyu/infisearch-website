She hastily took the document up again, and read it through once more.  Its instructions were precise to stop the proceedings of the misguided Memphites with stern promptitude.  It explained that the death of the Christ Jesus, who shed His blood to redeem the world, had satisfied the need for a human victim.  Throughout the wide realms which the Cross overshadowed with blessing human sacrifice must therefore be accounted a useless and accursed abomination.  It went on to point out how the heathen had devised their gods in the image of weak, sinful, earthly beings, and chosen victims in accordance with this idea.  \"But our God,\" it said, \"is as high above men as the Spirit is above the flesh, and the sacrifice He demands is not of the flesh, but of the spirit.  Will He not turn away in wrath and sorrow from the blinded Christians of Memphis who, in their straits, feel and are about to act like the cruel and foolish heathen?  They take for their victim a heretic and a stranger, deeming that that will diminish the abomination in the eyes of the Lord; but it moves Him to loathing all the same, for no human blood may stain the pure and sacred altars of our mild faith, which gives life and not death.  \"Ask your blind and misguided flock, my brother: Can the Father of Love feel joy at the sight of one of His children, even an erring one, suffocated in the waters to the honor of the Most High, while struggling, and cursing her executioners?  \"If, indeed, there were a pure maiden, possessed with the blessed intoxication of the love of God, who was ready to follow the example of Him who redeemed man by His death, to fling herself into the waters while she cried to Heaven with her dying breath: 'Take me and my innocence as an offering, O Lord!  Release my people from their extremity!'--that would be a victim indeed; and perchance, the Lord might say: 'I will accept it; but the will alone is enough.  No child of mine may cast away the life that I have lent her as the most sacred and precious of gifts.'\"  The letter ended with pious exhortations to the community.  Then a maiden who should voluntarily sacrifice herself in the river to save the people in their need would be a victim pleasing in the sight of the Lord--so said the Man of God, through whose mouth the Most High spoke.  And this opinion, this hint, was to Katharina like a distaff from which she spun a lengthening thread to warp to the loom and weave from it a tangible tissue.  She would be the maiden whom the patriarch had imagined--the real, true Bride of the Nile, inspired to cast off her young life to save her people in their need.  In this there was expiation such as Heaven might accept; this would release her from the burthen of life that weighed upon her, and would reunite her to her mother; in this way she could show her lover and the bishop and all the world the immensity of her self-sacrifice, which was in nothing behind that of \"the other\"--the much-vaunted daughter of Thomas!  She would do the great deed before Paula's eyes, in sight of all the people.  But Orion must know whose image she bore in her heart and for whose sake she made that leap from blooming life into a watery grave.  Oh! it was wonderful, splendid!  Would she not thus compel him inevitably to remember her whenever he should think of Paula?  Yes, she would force him to allow her image to dwell in his soul, inseparable from that \"other;\" and would not such an unparalleled act add such height to her figure, that it would be equal to that of her Syrian rival in the estimation of all men--even in his?  She now began to long for the supreme moment.  Her vain little heart laughed in anticipation of the delight of being seen, praised and admired by all.  Tomorrow she, her little self, would tower above all the world; and the more she felt the oppressive heat of the scorching day, the more delicious it seemed to look forward to finding rest from the torments of life in the cool element.  She saw no difficulties in the way of her achievement; she was mistress now, and her slaves and servants must obey her orders.  At the same time she remembered, too, to protect her large possessions from falling into the hands of relations for whom she did not care; with a firm hand she drew up a will in which she bequeathed part of her fortune to her uncle Chrysippus, small portions to her foster-brother Anubis, and to Rufinus' widow, to whom she owed reparation for great wrong; then the larger half, and she owned many millions, she bequeathed to her dear friend Orion, whom she freely forgave, and who, she hoped, would see that even in the little \"water-wagtail\" there had been room for some greatness.  She begged him also to take her house, since she had not been altogether guiltless of the destruction of the home of his fathers.  The condition she attached to this bequest showed the same keen, alert spirit that had guided her through life.  She knew that the patriarch's indignation might be fatal to the young man, so to serve as a mediator, and at the same time to ensure for herself the prayers of the Church, which she desired, she enjoined Orion to bestow the greater part of his inheritance on the patriarch for the Church and for benevolent purposes.  But not at once, not for ten years, and in instalments of which Orion himself was to determine the proportion.  In the event of his dying within the next three years all his claims were to be transferred to her uncle Chrysippus.  She added a request to the Church, to which she belonged with her whole heart, that every year on her saint's day and her mother's they should be prayed for in every church in the land.  A chapel was to be erected on the scene of her self-immolation, and if the patriarch thought her worthy of the honor, it was to bear the name of the Chapel of Susannah and Katharina.  She gave all her slaves their freedom and devised legacies to all the officials of her household.  As she sat for long hours of serious meditation, drawing up this last will, she smiled frequently with satisfaction.  Then she copied it out fair, and finally called the physician and all the free servants in the house to witness her signature.  Though no one had suspected the \"water-wagtail\" of such forethought, it was no matter of surprise that the young heiress, shut up in the plague- stricken house, should dispose of her estates, and before night-fall the physician brought Alexander, the chief of the Senate, to the garden gate by her desire, and there they spoke to each other without opening it.  He was an old friend of her father's, and since the death of the Mukaukas, had been her guardian; he now agreed to stand as her Kyrios, and as such he ratified her will and the signature, though she would not allow him to read the document.  Finally she went to the slaves quarters, from whence a few more sufferers had been removed to the Necropolis, and desired her boatman to get the holiday barge in readiness early in the morning, as she purposed seeing the ceremonial from the river.  She gave particular orders to the gardener as to how it was to be decorated, and what flowers he was to cut for her personal adornment.  She went to bed far less excited than she had been the night before, and before she had ended her evening prayer, slumber overtook her weary brain.  When she awoke at sunrise, the large and splendid boat, which her father had had built at great cost in Alexandria, was manned and ready to put out.  No one interfered to prevent her embarking with Anubis and a few female servants, for all the guards who had surrounded the house till yesterday had been withdrawn to do duty at the great ceremonial of the marriage and sacrifice, since a popular tumult was not unlikely to arise.     CHAPTER XXV.  A great number of persons had collected during the night on the quay near Nesptah's inn.  The crowd was increasing every minute, and in spite of the intense heat, not a Memphite could bear to stop within doors, Men, women and children were flocking to the scene of the festival; they came in thousands from the neighboring towns, hamlets and villages, to witness the unprecedented sacrifice which was to put an end to the misery of the land.  Who had ever heard of such a marriage?  What a privilege, what a happiness, to be so fortunate as to see it!  The senate had not been idle and had done all in their power to surround it with magnificence and to enable as many as possible to enjoy the pageant, which had been planned with a lavish hand and liberal munificence.  Round the cove by Nesptah's inn a semi-circular wooden stand had been constructed, on which thousands found seats or standing-room.  Stalls furnished with hangings were erected in the middle of the tribune for the authorities and their families as well as for the leading Arab officials, and arm-chairs were placed in them for the Vekeel, for the Kadi, for the head of the senate, for old Horapollo and also for the Christian priesthood, though it was well known that they would not be present at the ceremony.  The lower classes, who could not afford to pay for admission to these seats, had established themselves on the banks of the river; wandering dealers had followed them, and wherever the crowd was densest they had displayed their wares--light refreshments or solid food--on two-wheeled trucks, or on little carpets spread on the ground.  In the tribune itself the cries of the water-sellers were incessant as they offered filtered Nile water and fruit syrups for sale.  The parched tops of the palms, where turtle doves, lapwings and sparrow- hawks were wont to perch, were crowded with the vagabond boys of the town, who whiled away the time by pulling the withered and diseased dates from the great clumps and flinging them down on the bystanders below, till the guard took "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5528"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 12 (#8)"],["body","at them with their arrows and stopped the game.  The centre of attraction to all eyes was a wooden platform or pontoon, built far out into the stream; from thence the bride was to be flung into the watery embrace of the expectant bridegroom.  Here the masters of the ceremonies had put forth their best efforts, and it was magnificently decorated with hangings and handkerchiefs, palm-leaves and flags; with heavy garlands of tamarisk and willow, mingled with bright blossoms of the lotos and mallow, lilies and roses; with devices emblematic of the province, and other gilt ornaments.  Only the furthest end of it was unadorned and without even a railing, that there might be nothing to intercept the view of the \"marriage.\"  Three hours before noon none were absent but those whose places were secured, and ere long curiosity brought them also to the spot.  The town- watch found it required all their efforts to keep the front ranks of the people from being pushed into the river by those behind; indeed, this accident could not be everywhere guarded against; but, thanks to the shallow state of the water, no one was the worse.  But the cries of those who were in danger nevertheless drowned the music of the bands performing on raised platforms and the shouts of applause which rose on all sides to hail Horapollo--who was here, there, everywhere on his white ass as brisk as a lad--or to greet some leading official.  And now and again loud cries of anguish were heard, or the closely-packed throng parted with exclamations of horror.  A citizen had had a sunstroke, or had been seized by the plague.  Then the fugitives dragged others away with them; screaming mothers trying to save their little ones from the crush on one hand and the contagion on the other, oversetting one dealer's truck, smashing the eggs and cakes of another.  A whole party were pushed into a deep but half-dried up water-course; the guardians of the peace flourished their staves, yelling and making their victims yell in their efforts to restore order--but all this hardly affected the vast body of spectators, and suddenly peace reigned, the confusion subsided, the shrieks were silenced.  Those who were doomed might fall or die, be crushed or plague-stricken.  Trumpet calls and singing were heard approaching from the town: the procession, the Bridal procession was coming!  Not a man but would have perished rather than be deprived of seeing a single act of this stupendous drama.  Those Arabs--what fools they were!  Besides the Vekeel only three of their magnates were present, and those men whom no one knew.  Even the Kadi was nowhere to be seen; and he must have forbidden the Moslem women to come, for not a single veiled beauty of the harem was visible.  Not one Egyptian woman would have failed to appear if the plague had not kept so many imprisoned in their houses.  Such a thing would never be seen again; this day's doings would be a tale to tell to future great- grandchildren!  The music and singing came nearer and nearer; and it did not indeed sound as if it were escorting a hapless creature to a fearful end.  Blast after blast rang out from the trumpets, filling the air with festive defiance; cheerful bridal songs came nearer and nearer to the listeners, the shrill chorus of boys and maidens sounding above the deeper and stronger chant of youths and men of all ages; flutes piped a gay invitation to gladness; the dull roar of drums muttered like the distant waves in time to a march, broken by the clang of cymbals and the tinkle of bells hung around tambourines held high by girlish hands which struck, rattled and waved them above their flowing curls; lute players discoursed sweet music on the strings; and as this vast tide of mingled tones came closer, behind it there was still more music and more song.  To the ear the procession seemed endless, and the eye soon confirmed the impression.  All were listening, gazing, watching to see the Bride and her escort. Every eye seemed compelled to turn in the same direction; and presently there came: first the trumpeters on spirited horses, and these ranged themselves on each side of the road by the shore leading to the scene of the \"marriage.\"  In front of them the choir of women took their stand to the left and, on the right, the men who had marched after them.  All alike were arrayed in light sea-green garments, and loaded with lotos- flowers.  The women's hair, twined with white blossoms, flowed over their shoulders; the men carried bunches of papyrus and reeds;--they represented river gods that had risen from the stream.  Then came boys and bearded men, in white robes, with panther-skins on their shoulders, as the heathen priests had been wont to wear them.  They were headed by two old men with long white beards, one holding a silver cup and the other a golden one, ready to fling them into the waves as a first offering, according to the practise of their forefathers, as Horapollo had described and ordered it.  These went on to the pontoon, to its farthest end, and took their place on one side of the platform whence the Bride was to be cast into the river.  Behind them came a large troop of flute-players and drummers, followed by fifty maidens holding tambourines, and fifty men all dressed and carrying emblems as followers of Dionysus, or Osiris-Bacchus, who had been worshipped here in the time of the Romans; with these came the drunken Silenus, goathoofed Satyrs and Pan, with his reed-pipes, all riding grey asses strangely bedaubed with yellow.  Then followed giraffes, elephants, ostriches, antelopes, gazelles; even some tamed lions and panthers were led past the wondering crowd; for this had been done in the famous procession in honor of the second Ptolemy, described by Callixenus of Rhodes.  Next came a large car drawn by twelve black horses, and on it a symbolical group of Famine and Pestilence overthrown; they were surrounded by shrieking black children, with pointed wings on their shoulders and horns on their foreheads, bound to stakes to represent the hosts of hell--a performance which they tried to make at once ghastly and droll.  On another car the Goddess of the Inundation was to be seen.  She sat amid sheaves, fruits, and garlands of vine; while round her were groups of children with apples and corn, pomegranates and bunches of dates, wine-jars and cups in their hands.  Presently there appeared in a large shell, as though lounging in a bath, the goddess of health; she was drawn by eight snow-white horses, and held in one hand a golden goblet and in the other a caduceus.  After her came the river-god Nile, the bridegroom of the marriage, studied from the famous statue carried away from Alexandria by the Romans: a splendid and mighty bearded man, resting against an urn.  Sixteen naked children--the sixteen ells that the river must rise for its overflow to bless the land --played round his herculean form, and a bridal wreath of lotos-flowers crowned his flowing locks.  This car, which was decorated with crocodiles, sheaves, dates, grapes, and shells, was hailed with shouts of enthusiasm; it was escorted by old men in the costume of the heathen priesthood.  Behind this came more music and singers, with a troop of young men and maidens led by lute-players singing.  These too were dressed as the genie, and nymphs of the river and were the groomsmen and bridesmaids in attendance on the betrothed.  The longer the procession lasted and the nearer the looked-for victim approached, the more eagerly attent were the gazing multitude.  When this group of youths and maidens had gone by, there was hardly a sound to be heard in the tribune and among the crowd.  No one felt the fierce heat of the sun, no one heeded the thirst that parched every tongue; all eyes were bent in one direction; only the black Vekeel, whose colossal form towered up where he stood, occasionally sent a sinister and anxious glance towards the town.  He expected to see smoke rising from the quarter near the prison, and suddenly his lips parted and he displayed his dazzlingly white teeth in a scornful laugh.  That which he looked for had come to pass; the little grey cloud which he discerned grew blacker, and then, in the heart of it, rose a crimson glow which did not take its color from the sun.  But of all those thousands he was the only one who looked behind him and observed it.  The bride's attendants had by this time taken their station on the pontoon; here came another band of youths with panther skins on their shoulders; and now--at last, at last--a car came swaying along, drawn by eight coal-black oxen dressed with green ostrich-feathers and water- plants.  The car was shaded by a tall canopy, supported by four poles, against which leaned four men in the robes of the heathen priesthood; this awning was lavishly decorated with wreaths of lotos and reeds, and fenced about with papyrus, bulrushes, tall grasses and blossoming river-weeds. Beneath it sat the queen of the festival--the Bride of the Nile.  Robed in white and closely veiled, she was quite motionless.  Her long, thick brown hair fell over her shoulders; at her feet lay a wreath, and rare rose-colored lotos-flowers were strewn on the car.  The bishop had been sitting at her side, the first Christian priest, certainly, of all the swarms of monks and ecclesiastics in Memphis, who had ever appeared at such a scene of heathen abomination.  He was now standing, looking down at the crowd with a deeply knit brow and menacing gaze.  What good had come of the penitential sermons in all the churches, of his and his vicar's warnings and threats?  In spite of all remonstrance he had mounted the car with the condemned victim, after administering the last consolations to her soul.  It might cost him his life, but he would keep his promise.  In her hand Paula held two roses: one was Orion's last greeting delivered by Martina; the other Pulcheria had brought her early in the morning. Yesterday, in a "]]]
