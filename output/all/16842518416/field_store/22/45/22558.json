Did he own up?\"  \"No; he brazened it out. He said the box was given him to take care of by some mysterious stranger.\"  \"That's too thin. How was it traced to Luke?\"  \"It seems Old Maid Sprague\"--it was lucky for Melinda's peace of mind that she did not hear this contemptuous reference to her--\"went to the Widow Larkin's house one day and saw the tin box in her trunk.\"  \"She didn't leave the trunk open, did she?\"  \"No; but she had it open, looking into it, when old Melinda crept upstairs softly and caught her at it.\"  \"I suppose Luke will have to go to State's prison,\" said Randolph, with a gratified smile.  \"I hope it won't be quite so bad as that,\" said Sam, who was not equal in malice to his aristocratic friend.  \"I haven't any pity for him,\" said Randolph, decidedly. \"If he chooses to steal, he must expect to be punished.\"  Just then Mr. Hooper, the grammar-school teacher, came up.  \"Mr. Hooper,\" said Randolph, eagerly, \"have you heard about Luke?\"  \"I have heard that he has been removed from his janitorship, and I'm sorry for it.\"  \"If he goes to jail he wouldn't be able to be janitor,\" said Randolph.  \"Goes to jail! What do you mean?\" demanded the teacher, sharply.  Hereupon Randolph told the story, aided and assisted by Sam Noble, to whom he referred as his authority.  \"This is too ridiculous!\" said Mr. Hooper, contemptuously. \"Luke is no thief, and if he had the tin box he has given the right explanation of how he came by it.\"  \"I know he is a favorite of yours, Mr. Hooper, but that won't save him from going to jail,\" said Randolph, tartly.  \"If he is a favorite of mine,\" said the teacher, with dignity, \"it is for a very good reason. I have always found him to be a high-minded, honorable boy, and I still believe him to be so, in spite of the grave accusation that has been brought against him.\"  There was something in the teacher's manner that deterred Randolph from continuing his malicious attack upon Luke. Mr. Hooper lost no time in inquiring into the facts of the case, and then in seeking out Luke, whom he found in the constable's house.  \"Luke,\" he said, extending his hand, \"I have heard that you were in trouble, and I have come to see what I can do for you.\"  \"You are very kind, Mr. Hooper,\" said Luke, gratefully. \"I hope you don't believe me guilty.\"  \"I would as soon believe myself guilty of the charge, Luke.\"  \"That's just what I said, Mr. Hooper,\" said Constable Perkins. \"Just as if there wasn't more than one tin box in the world.\"  \"You never told any one that you had a tin box in your custody, I suppose, Luke?\"  \"No, sir; the man who asked me to take care of it especially cautioned me to say nothing about it.\"  \"What was his name?\"  \"Roland Reed.\"  \"Do you know where to find him? It would be of service to you if you could obtain his evidence. It would clear you at once.\"  \"I wish I could, sir, but I have no idea where to look for him.\"  \"That is unfortunate,\" said the teacher, knitting his brows in perplexity. \"When are you to be brought to trial?\"  \"To-morrow, I hear.\"  \"Well, Luke, keep up a good heart and hope for the best.\"  \"I mean to, sir.\"    CHAPTER XIII  IN THE COURT-ROOM   It was decided that Luke should remain until his trial in the personal custody of Constable Perkins. Except for the name of it, his imprisonment was not very irksome, for the Perkins family treated him as an honored guest, and Mrs. Perkins prepared a nicer supper than usual. When Mr. Perkins went out he said to his wife, with a quizzical smile: \"I leave Luke in your charge. Don't let him run away.\"  \"I'll look out for that,\" said Mrs. Perkins, smiling.  \"Perhaps I had better leave you a pistol, my dear?\"  \"I am afraid I should not know how to use it.\"  \"You might tie my hands,\" suggested Luke.  \"That wouldn't prevent your walking away.\"  \"Then my feet.\"  \"It won't be necessary, husband,\" said Mrs. Perkins. \"I've got the poker and tongs ready.\"  But, though treated in this jesting manner, Luke could not help feeling a little anxious. For aught he knew, the tin box taken from his mother's trunk might be the same which had been stolen from the bank. In that case Roland Reed was not likely to appear again, and his story would be disbelieved. It was a strange one, he could not help admitting to himself. Yet he could not believe that the mysterious stranger was a burglar. If he were, it seemed very improbable that he would have left his booty within half a mile of the bank, in the very village where the theft had been committed. It was all very queer, and he could not see into the mystery.  \"I should like to do something,\" thought Luke. \"It's dull work sitting here with folded hands.\"  \"Isn't there something I can do, Mrs. Perkins?\" he said. \"I am not used to sitting about the house idle.\"  \"Well, you might make me some pies,\" said Mrs. Perkins.  \"You'd never eat them if I did. I can boil eggs and fry potatoes. Isn't there some wood to saw and split?\"  \"Plenty out in the shed.\"  \"I understand that, at any rate. Have you any objection to my setting to work?\"  \"No, if you won't run away.\"  \"Send out Charlie to watch me.\"  Charlie was a youngster about four years of age, and very fond of Luke, who was a favorite with most young children.  \"Yes, that will do. Charlie, go into the shed and see Luke saw wood.\"  \"Yes, mama.\"  \"Don't let him run away.\"  \"No, I won't,\" said Charlie, gravely.  Luke felt happier when he was fairly at work. It took his mind off his troubles, as work generally does, and he spent a couple of hours in the shed. Then Mrs. Perkins came to the door and called him.  \"Luke,\" she said, \"a young lady has called to see the prisoner.\"  \"A young lady! Who is it?\"  \"Florence Grant.\"  Luke's face brightened up with pleasure; he put on his coat and went into the house.  \"Oh, Luke, what a shame!\" exclaimed Florence, hastening to him with extended hand. \"I only just heard of it.\"  \"Then you're not afraid to shake hands with a bank burglar?\" said Luke.  \"No, indeed! What nonsense it is! Who do you think told me of your arrest?\"  \"Randolph Duncan.\"  \"You have guessed it.\"  \"What did he say? Did he seem to be shocked at my iniquity?\"  \"I think he seemed glad of it. Of course, he believes you guilty.\"  \"I supposed he would, or pretend to, at any rate. I think his father is interested to make me out guilty. I hope you don't think there is any chance of it?\"  \"Of course not, Luke. I know you too well. I'd sooner suspect Randolph. He wanted to know what I thought of you now.\"  \"And what did you answer?\"  \"That I thought the same as I always had--that you were one of the best boys in the village. 'I admire your taste,' said Randolph, with a sneer. Then I gave him a piece of my mind.\"  \"I should like to have heard you, Florence.\"  \"I don't know; you have no idea what a virago I am when I am mad. Now sit down and tell me all about it.\"  Luke obeyed, and the conversation was a long one, and seemed interesting to both. In the midst of it Linton Tomkins came in.  \"Have you come to see the prisoner, also, Linton?\" asked Florence.  \"Yes, Florence. What a desperate-looking ruffian he is! I don't dare to come too near. How did you break into the bank, Luke?\"  First Luke smiled, then he became grave. \"After all, it is no joke to me, Linny,\" he said. \"Think of the disgrace of being arrested on such a charge.\"  \"The disgrace is in being a burglar, not in being arrested for one, Luke. Of course, it's absurd. Father wants me to say that if you are bound over for trial he will go bail for you to any amount.\"  \"Your father is very kind, Linny. I may need to avail myself of his kindness.\"  The next day came, and at ten o'clock, Luke, accompanied by Constable Perkins, entered the room in which Squire Duncan sat as trial justice. A considerable number of persons were gathered, for it was a trial in which the whole village was interested. Among them was Mrs. Larkin, who wore an anxious, perturbed look.  \"Oh, Luke,\" she said sorrowfully, \"how terrible it is to have you here!\"  \"Don't be troubled, mother,\" said Luke. \"We both know that I am innocent, and I rely on God to stand by me.\"  \"Luke,\" said Mr. Beane, \"though I am a bank trustee, I am your friend and believe you innocent. I will act as your lawyer.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Beane. I shall be very glad to accept your services.\"  The preliminary proceedings were of a formal character. Then Miss Melinda Sprague was summoned to testify. She professed to be very unwilling to say anything likely to injure her good friends, Luke and his mother, but managed to tell, quite dramatically, how she first caught a glimpse of the tin box.  \"Did Mrs. Larkin know that you saw it?\" asked the squire.  \"She didn't know for certain,\" answered Melinda, \"but she was evidently afraid I would, for she shut the trunk in a hurry, and seemed very much confused. I thought of this directly when I heard of the bank robbery, and I went over to tell Luke and his mother.\"  \"How did they receive your communication?\"  \"They seemed very much frightened.\"  \"And you inferred that they had not come honestly by the tin box?\"  \"It grieves me to say that I did,\" said Melinda, putting her handkerchief to her eyes to brush away an imaginary tear.  Finally Melinda sat down, and witnesses were called to testify to Luke's good character. There were more who wished to be sworn than there was time to hear. Mr. Beane called only Mr. Hooper, Mr. Tomkins and Luke's Sunday-school teacher. Then he called Luke to testify in his own defense.  Luke told a straightforward story--the same that he had told before--replying readily and easily to any questions that were asked him.  \"I submit, Squire Duncan,\" said Mr. Beane, \"that my client's statement is plain and frank and explains everything. I hold that it exonerates him from all suspicion of complicity with the robbery.\"  \"I differ"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/542"],["title","The Life of Me: An Autobiography (#0)"],["body","LIFE OF ME  AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY   Clarence Edgar Johnson    Copyright 1978     Clarence Edgar Johnson   2538 Chestnut   San Angelo, Texas 76901     DEDICATION  To    Ima, my wife    Virgil Dennis, our first son    David Larry, our youngest son    and especially to our late daughter,   Anita Joyce.

The original writings were in the form of letters written to Anita during the last few years.  When my sons, Dennis and Larry, learned of the letters, they also asked for copies.  As I began writing, I soon realized that I knew very little about the details of the lives of my parents and grandparents.  So I set out to tell my children a few things about myself and to leave unmentioned some things which I do not want them to know about me.  I also included some things about a few kinfolks and neighbors who had a part in molding the character whom my children now refer to as \"Dad.\"  It was hoped that the letters would aid in their better understanding of how certain teachings and ideals had been handed down through generations, and that they might better understand why they grew up under those rules and customs.

Andrew was the oldest and was a half brother to the other eight.  Joe was Grandma's first born, second was my father, William Franklin. All but one of them lived and thrived and raised children. That's why I have dozens of cousins.  When my father was born, the family lived in Bosque County, Texas, somewhere about Meridian.  They were ranchers and owned a bunch of cattle.  Some 20 years later we find the family in Concho County somewhere near Paint Rock or in between Paint Rock and where the little town of Melvin now stands.  At least two of the boys, Joe and Will, worked for the Melvin brothers on their ranch.  I have heard Papa tell of breaking saddle horses for the brothers as well as trail driving near San Angelo.  In the meantime the weather turned dry, grass became scarce, and the Johnsons drove their cattle to Indian Territory, (Oklahoma) looking for grass in about the year of 1894--that is, all but Joe.  He stayed with his job in Texas.  About a year after the family moved to Oklahoma, Will Johnson got a neighbor boy to go with him back to their place in Texas to bring another wagon load of household goods.  They were gone about two weeks.  While the family was in Oklahoma, Will--who was about 20--taught school two terms at Nubbin Ridge, somewhere near Duncan. Simpson, being about 17 at the time, was not about to go to school to a teacher who was his older brother, so he saddled his horse and slipped away back to Melvin's ranch, to be with his brother Joe.  He said he got tired of riding but not nearly as tired as his horse.  The journey was about 300 miles.  He was on the trail three days and nights and had to stop at times to let his horse rest.  When he got to the ranch, Joe wrote to the family saying that Simpson was with him and for them not to worry.  They had suspected where he had gone but were not sure.  My Gaddie grandparents reared five children, three boys and two girls.  Emma, my mother, was next to the youngest.  Hugh was her younger brother.  When my mother was born the family lived in Larue County, Kentucky, near Hodgensville.  Their farm joined the Lincoln farm.  She and Abraham Lincoln drew water from the same well but not at the same time.  The Lincoln family had moved away some years before the Gaddies moved there.  The well was on the fence row between the two farms.  When Emma was four years old her family moved to Dallas County, Texas.  Then they moved to Grayson County, where Emma started to school at age seven.  When she was nine they moved back to their old home place in Kentucky.  Again, when she was 13, they moved to Dallas County, and at age 16 the family moved to a farm some eight miles southeast of Duncan, Oklahoma.  About the same time the Gaddie family moved to their farm near Duncan, we find the Johnson family leaving Texas where the weather turned dry and the grass became scarce and the Johnsons drove their cattle to Indian Territory looking for grass, and they found that grass near Duncan, Oklahoma.  They stayed in Oklahoma about four years and during that time at least two of the boys were busy at things other than sitting around watching cattle grow.  Andrew had married a girl named Mary, and Will had met this pretty little freckle faced girl from Kentucky.  So then, as you can see, here in farming and cattle country near Duncan is where the Johnsons met up with the Gaddies.  This is where a schoolteaching cowboy named Will met a country farmer's daughter named Emma Lee.  This is where the falling in love took place.  And this is where Will married Emma in the fall of 1896. She was 18, he was 22.  They were my parents.  After living in Oklahoma that four years, Grandpa Johnson went back to Texas looking for land to buy.  He found what he wanted and bought 1,000 acres of unimproved land in Jones County about three miles southeast of Hamlin.  Then he went back to Oklahoma to get the family.  So by the time Grandpa Johnson was ready to start his journey back to Texas with his family, the family had increased by two daughters-in-law and two grandchildren.  Will and Emma had a son, Frank, six weeks old.  Andrew and Mary had a daughter, Ruth, only three weeks old.  Some thought that Ruth was too young to make the trip in the cold of winter.  But they all came through in wagons and drove their cattle.  That was in January of 1898.  In later years Mama told me that she thought she would have frozen to death if it had not been for Frank in her lap to help keep her warm.  The trip took two weeks in the dead of winter and it rained every day of the trip.  Since there were no improvements on the Johnson land, they all rented other farms for a year or two while they made improvements.  Papa and Mama rented and farmed one year in Fisher County.  Much of the well water in that county tastes so strongly of gypsum that people have to haul their drinking water from the better wells.  So, the story is told that when they were driving their covered wagon to Fisher County, they stopped and asked a man, \"How far is it to Fisher County?\"  The man said, \"You are still about ten miles away.\"  \"How can we tell when we get there?\"  \"You will see farmers hauling water in barrels in wagons.\"  \"Have they always had to haul water in Fisher County?\"  \"Yes, but during the World Flood they didn't have to haul it so far.  The flood water came within a half-mile of Roby.\"  I guess Grandpa farmed at least one year in Fisher County.  They tell me that Ed, one of the younger boys, went to school in that county at White Pond one year.  Grandpa had bought the l,000 acres for all the family.  Andrew and Will were the first ones to buy their portions of 100 acres each.  The raw land had cost $3 an acre.  Papa's farm cost him $300.  Papa was fast becoming a good carpenter and he did his part in helping build a two-story house on Grandpa's portion of the land. The house is still in good shape and has a family living in it 77 years later.  Andrew first lived in a dugout on his 100 acres.  They used the dugout for a kitchen and storm cellar many years after they built a house beside it.  Papa's land was in the southeast corner of the 1,000 acre tract. He built his house about a quarter-mile south of Grandpa's house. It is still standing also.  Since that time some of the Johnson boys and girls have bought and sold and swapped portions of the land.  But most of it is still in the hands of the Johnson boys and girls or their sons and daughters.  After farming in Fisher County in the year of 1898, Papa moved to a farm in Jones County, a mile northeast of Neinda, and farmed there in 1899.  And there, in a half-dugout, my sister, Susie, was born.  Many years later as we would drive by the farm in our hack, on our way to church at Neinda, our parents would point out the old dugout and explain, \"There is where we used to live.\"  Year after year as the old dugout deteriorated and began caving in, we still went by it on our way to church and there was always something fascinating about it to us kids as one or more of us would point to the old dwelling and say, \"There's where Mama"]]]
