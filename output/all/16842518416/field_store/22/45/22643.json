You know very well I am still hot-headed, though I am old in years, and alas! timidity was never my weakness; but Rameses is a powerful man, and duty compels me to ask you: Is it mere hatred for the king that has led you to take these hasty and imprudent steps?\"  \"I have no hatred for Rameses,\" answered Ameni gravely.  \"If he did not wear the crown I could love him; I know him too, as well as if I were his brother, and value all that is great in him; nay I will admit that he is disfigured by no littleness.  If I did not know how strong the enemy is, we might try to overthrow him with smaller means.  You know as well as I do that he is our enemy.  Not yours, nor mine, nor the enemy of the Gods; but the enemy of the old and reverend ordinances by which this people and this country must be governed, and above all of those who are required to protect the wisdom of the fathers, and to point out the right way to the sovereign--I mean the priesthood, whom it is my duty to lead, and for whose rights I will fight with every weapon of the spirit. In this contest, as you know, all that otherwise would be falsehood, treachery, and cunning, puts on the bright aspect of light and truth. As the physician needs the knife and fire to heal the sick, we must do fearful things to save the community when it is in danger.  Now you will see me fight with every weapon, for if we remain idle, we shall soon cease to be the leaders of the state, and become the slaves of the king.\"  Gagabu nodded assent, but Ameni went on with increasing warmth, and in that rhythmical accent in which, when he came out of the holy of holies, he was accustomed to declare the will of the Divinity, \"You were my teacher, and I value you, and so you now shall be told everything that stirred my soul, and made me first resolve upon this fearful struggle.  I was, as you know, brought up in this temple with Rameses--and it was very wise of Seti to let his son grow up here with other boys.  At work and at play the heir to the throne and I won every prize.  He was quite my superior in swift apprehension--in keen perception--but I had greater caution, and deeper purpose.  Often he laughed at my laborious efforts, but his brilliant powers appeared to me a vain delusion.  I became one of the initiated, he ruled the state in partnership with his father, and, when Seti died, by himself.  We both grew older, but the foundation of our characters remained the same.  He rushed to splendid victories, overthrew nations, and raised the glory of the Egyptian name to a giddy height, though stained with the blood of his people; I passed my life in industry and labor, in teaching the young, and in guarding the laws which regulate the intercourse of men and bind the people to the Divinity.  I compared the present with the past: What were the priests?  How had they come to be what they are?  What would Egypt be without them?  There is not an art, not a science, not a faculty that is not thought out, constructed, and practised by us.  We crown the kings, we named the Gods, and taught the people to honor them as divine--for the crowd needs a hand to lead it, and under which it shall tremble as under the mighty hand of Fate.  We are the willing ministers of the divine representative of Ra on the throne, so long as he rules in accordance with our institutions--as the One God reigns, subject to eternal laws.  He used to choose his counsellors from among us; we told him what would benefit the country, he heard us willingly, and executed our plans.  The old kings were the hands, but we, the priests, were the head.  And now, my father, what has become of us?  We are made use of to keep the people in the faith, for if they cease to honor the Gods how will they submit to kings?  Seti ventured much, his son risks still more, and therefore both have required much succor from the Immortals.  Rameses is pious, he sacrifices frequently, and loves prayer: we are necessary to him, to waft incense, to slaughter hecatombs, to offer prayers, and to interpret dreams--but we are no longer his advisers.  My father, now in Osiris, a worthier high- priest than I, was charged by the Prophets to entreat his father to give up the guilty project of connecting the north sea by a navigable channel with the unclean waters of the Red Sea.       [The harbors of the Red Sea were in the hands of the Phoenicians,      who sailed from thence southwards to enrich themselves with the      produce of Arabia and Ophir.  Pharaoh Necho also projected a Suez      canal, but does not appear to have carried it out, as the oracle      declared that the utility of the undertaking would be greatest to      foreigners.]  \"Such things can only benefit the Asiatics.  But Seti would not listen to our counsel.  We desired to preserve the old division of the land, but Rameses introduced the new to the disadvantage of the priests; we warned him against fresh wars, and the king again and again has taken the field; we had the ancient sacred documents which exempted our peasantry from military service, and, as you know, he outrageously defies them.  From the most ancient times no one has been permitted to raise temples in this land to strange Gods, and Rameses favors the son of the stranger, and, not only in the north country, but in the reverend city of Memphis and here in Thebes, he has raised altars and magnificent sanctuaries, in the strangers' quarter, to the sanguinary  false Gods of the East.\"       [Human sacrifices, which had been introduced into Egypt by the      Phoenicians, were very early abolished.]  \"You speak like a Seer,\" cried old Gagabu, \"and what you say is perfectly true.  We are still called priests, but alas! our counsel is little asked.  'You have to prepare men for a happy lot in the other world,' Rameses once said; 'I alone can guide their destinies in this.'\"  \"He did say so,\" answered Ameni, \"and if he had said no more than that he would have been doomed.  He and his house are the enemies of our rights and of our noble country.  Need I tell you from whom the race of the Pharaoh is descended?  Formerly the hosts who came from the east, and fell on our land like swarms of locusts, robbing and destroying it, were spoken of as 'a curse' and a 'pest.'  Rameses' father was of that race. When Ani's ancestors expelled the Hyksos, the bold chief, whose children now govern Egypt, obtained the favor of being allowed to remain on the banks of the Nile; they served in the armies, they distinguished themselves, and, at last, the first Rameses succeeded in gaining the troops over to himself, and in pushing the old race of the legitimate sons of Ra, weakened as they were by heresy, from the throne.  I must confess, however unwillingly, that some priests of the true faith--among them your grandfather, and mine--supported the daring usurper who clung faithfully to the old traditions.  Not less than a hundred generations of my ancestors, and of yours, and of many other priestly families, have lived and died here by the banks of the Nile--of Rameses race we have seen ten, and only know of them that they descend from strangers, from the caste of Amu!  He is like all the Semitic race; they love to wander, they call us ploughmen,--[The word Fellah (pl. Fellahin) means ploughman] --and laugh to scorn the sober regularity with which we, tilling the dark soil, live through our lives to a tardy death, in honest labor both of mind and body.  They sweep round on foraying excursions, ride the salt waves in ships, and know no loved and fixed home; they settle down wherever they are tempted by rapine, and when there is nothing more to be got they build a house in another spot.  Such was Seti, such is Rameses! For a year he will stop in Thebes, then he must set out for wars in strange lands.  He does not know how to yield piously, or to take advice of wise counsellors, and he will not learn.  And such as the father is, so are the children!  Think of the criminal behavior of Bent-Anat!\"  \"I said the kings liked foreigners.  Have you duly considered the importance of that to us?  We strive for high and noble aims, and have wrenched off the shackles of the flesh in order to guard our souls.  The poorest man lives secure under the shelter of the law, and through us participates in the gifts of the spirit; to the rich are offered the priceless treasures of art and learning.  Now look abroad: east and west wandering tribes roam over the desert with wretched tents; in the south a debased populace prays to feathers, and to abject idols, who are beaten if the worshipper is not satisfied.  In the north certainly there are well regulated states, but the best part of the arts and sciences which they possess they owe to us, and their altars still reek with the loathsome sacrifice of human blood.  Only backsliding from the right is possible under the stranger, and therefore it is prudent to withdraw from him; therefore he is hateful to our Gods.  And Rameses, the king, is a stranger, by blood and by nature, in his affections, and in his appearance; his thoughts are always abroad--this country is too small for him--and he will never perceive what is really best for him, clear as his intellect is.  He will listen to no guidance, he does mischief to Egypt, and therefore I say: Down with him from the throne!\"  \"Down with him!\"--Gagabu eagerly echoed the words.  Ameni gave the old man his hand, which trembled with excitement, and went on more calmly.  \"The Regent Ani is a legitimate child of the soil, by his father and mother both.  I know him well, and I am sure that though he is cunning indeed, he is "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5444"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 06 (#7)"],["body","of true veneration, and will righteously establish us in the rights which we have inherited.  The choice is easy: I have chosen, and I always carry through what I have once begun!  Now you know all, and you will second me.\"  \"With body and soul!\"  cried Gagabu.  \"Strengthen the hearts of the brethren,\"  said Ameni, preparing to go. \"The initiated may all guess what is going on, but it must never be spoken of.\"     CHAPTER XXVII.  The sun was up on the twenty-ninth morning of the second month of the over-flow of the Nile,       [The 29th Phaophi.  The Egyptians divided the year into three      seasons of four months each.  Flood-time, seed-time and Harvest.      (Scha, per and schemu.)  The 29th Phaophi corresponds to the 8th      November.]  and citizens and their wives, old men and children, freemen and slaves, led by priests, did homage to the rising day-star before the door of the temple to which the quarter of the town belonged where each one dwelt.  The Thebans stood together like Huge families before the pylons, waiting for the processions of priests, which they intended to join in order to march in their train round the great temple of the city, and thence to cross with the festal barks to the Necropolis.  To-day was the Feast of the Valley, and Anion, the great God of Thebes, was carried over in solemn pomp to the City of the Dead, in order that he--as the priests said--might sacrifice to his fathers in the other world.  The train marched westward; for there, where the earthly remains of man also found rest, the millions of suns had disappeared, each of which was succeeded daily by a new one, born of the night.  The young luminary, the priests said, did not forget those that had been extinguished, and from whom he was descended; and Anion paid them this mark of respect to warn the devout not to forget those who were passed away, and to whom they owed their existence.  \"Bring offerings,\" says a pious text, \"to thy father and thy mother who rest in the valley of the tombs; for such gifts are pleasing to the Gods, who will receive them as if brought to themselves.  Often visit thy dead, so that what thou dost for them, thy son may do for thee.\"  The Feast of the Valley was a feast of the dead; but it was not a melancholy solemnity, observed with lamentation and wailing; on the contrary, it was a cheerful festival, devoted to pious and sentimental memories of those whom we cease not to love after death, whom we esteem happy and blest, and of whom we think with affection; to whom too the throng from Thebes brought offerings, forming groups in the chapel-like tombs, or in front of the graves, to eat and drink.  Father, mother and children clung together; the house-slaves followed with provisions, and with torches, which would light up the darkness of the tomb and show the way home at night.  Even the poorest had taken care to secure beforehand a place in one of the large boats which conveyed the people across the stream; the barges of the rich, dressed in the gayest colors, awaited their owners with their households, and the children had dreamed all night of the sacred bark of Anion, whose splendor, as their mothers told them, was hardly less than that of the golden boat in which the Sun-God and his companions make their daily voyage across the ocean of heaven.  The broad landing place of the temple of Anion was already crowded with priests, the shore with citizens, and the river with boats; already loud music drowned the din of the crowds, who thronged and pushed, enveloped in clouds of dust, to reach the boats; the houses and hovels of Thebes were all empty, and the advent of the God through the temple-gates was eagerly expected; but still the members of the royal family had not appeared, who were wont on this solemn day to go on foot to the great temple of Anion; and, in the crowd, many a one asked his neighbor why Bent-Anat, the fair daughter of Rameses, lingered so long, and delayed the starting of the procession.  The priests had begun their chant within the walls, which debarred the outer world from any glimpse into the bright precincts of the temple; the Regent with his brilliant train had entered the sanctuary; the gates were thrown open; the youths in their short-aprons, who threw flowers in the path of the God, had come out; clouds of incense announced the approach of Anion--and still the daughter of Rameses appeared not.  Many rumors were afloat, most of them contradictory; but one was accurate, and confirmed by the temple servants, to the great regret of the crowd--Bent-Anat was excluded from the Feast of the Valley.  She stood on her balcony with her brother Rameri and her friend Nefert, and looked down on the river, and on the approaching God.  Early in the previous morning Bek-en-Chunsu, the old high-priest of the temple of Anion had pronounced her clean, but in the evening he had come to communicate to her the intelligence that Ameni prohibited her entering the Necropolis before she had obtained the forgiveness of the Gods of the West for her offence.  While still under the ban of uncleanness she had visited the temple of Hathor, and had defiled it by her presence; and the stern Superior of the City of the Dead was in the right--that Bek-en-Chunsu himself admitted-- in closing the western shore against her.  Bent-Anat then had recourse to Ani; but, though he promised to mediate for her, he came late in the evening to tell her that Ameni was inexorable.  The Regent at the same time, with every appearance of regret, advised her to avoid an open quarrel, and not to defy Ameni's lofty severity, but to remain absent from the festival.  Katuti at the same time sent the dwarf to Nefert, to desire her to join her mother, in taking part in the procession, and in sacrificing in her father's tomb; but Nefert replied that she neither could nor would leave her royal friend and mistress.  Bent-Anat had given leave of absence to the highest members of her household, and had prayed them to think of her at the splendid solemnity.  When, from her balcony, she saw the mob of people and the crowd of boats, she went back into her room, called Rameri, who was angrily declaiming at what he called Ameni's insolence, took his hands in hers, and said:  \"We have both done wrong, brother; let us patiently submit to the consequences of our faults, and conduct ourselves as if our father were with us.\"  \"He would tear the panther-skin from the haughty priest's shoulders,\" cried Rameri, \"if he dared to humiliate you so in his presence;\" and tears of rage ran down his smooth cheeks as he spoke.  \"Put anger aside,\" said Bent-Anat.  \"You were still quite little the last time my father took part in this festival.\"  \"Oh!  I remember that morning well,\" exclaimed Rameri, \"and shall never forget it.\"  \"So I should think,\" said the princess.  \"Do not leave us, Nefert--you are now my sister.  It was a glorious morning; we children were collected in the great hall of the King, all in festival dresses; he had us called into this room, which had been inhabited by my mother, who then had been dead only a few months.  He took each of us by the hand, and said he forgave us everything we might have done wrong if only we were sincerely penitent, and gave us each a kiss on our forehead.  Then he beckoned us all to him, and said, as humbly as if he were one of us instead of the great king, 'Perhaps I may have done one of you some injustice, or have kept you out of some right; I am not conscious of such a thing, but if it has occurred I am very sorry'--we all rushed upon him, and wanted to kiss him, but he put us aside smiling, and said, 'Each of you has enjoyed an equal share of one thing, that you may be sure--I mean your father's love; and I see now that you return what I have given you.'  Then he spoke of our mother, and said that even the tenderest father could not fill the place of a mother.  He drew a lovely picture of the unselfish devotion of the dead mother, and desired us to pray and to sacrifice with him at her resting-place, and to resolve to be worthy of her; not only in great things but in trifles too, for they make up the sum of life, as hours make the days, and the years.  We elder ones clasped each other's hands, and I never felt happier than in that moment, and afterwards by my mother's grave.\"  Nefert raised her eyes that were wet with tears.  \"With such a father it must be easy to be good,\" she said.  \"Did your mother never speak good words that went to your heart on the morning of this festival?\"  asked Bent-Anat.  Nefert colored, and answered: \"We were always late in dressing, and then had to hurry to be at the temple in time.\"  \"Then let me be your mother to-day,\" cried the princess, \"and yours too, Rameri.  Do you not remember how my father offered forgiveness to the officers of the court, and to all the servants, and how he enjoined us to root out every grudge from our hearts on this day?  'Only stainless garments,' he said, 'befit this feast; only hearts without spot.'  So, brother, I will not hear an evil word about Ameni, who is most likely forced to be severe by the law; my father will enquire into it all and decide.  My heart is so full, it must overflow.  Come, Nefert, give me a kiss, and you too, Rameri.  Now I will go into my little temple, in which the images of our ancestors stand, and think of my mother and the blessed spirits of those loved ones to whom I may not sacrifice to-day.\"  \"I will go with you,\" said Rameri.  \"You, Nefert--stay here,\" said Bent-Anat, \"and cut as many flowers as you like; take the best and finest, and make a wreath, and when it is ready we will send a messenger across to lay it, with other gifts, on the grave of your Mena's mother.\"  When, half-an-hour later, the brother and sister returned to the young wife, two graceful garlands hung in Nefert's bands, one for the grave of the dead queen, and one for Mena's mother.  \"I will carry over the wreaths, and lay them in the"]]]
