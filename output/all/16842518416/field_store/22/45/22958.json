She told Eudoxia of her meeting with the bishop, and that even Joanna was uneasy as to her future fate.  Ah!  that life within walls under lock and key seemed to her so frightful--and she pictured her terrors, her love of freedom and of a busy, useful, active life among men and her friends, and her hope that the great general, Amru, would defend her against every one if once she could place herself under his protection--painting it all so vividly, so passionately, and so pathetically, that the governess was softened.  She clasped her hands over her eyes, which were streaming with tears, and exclaimed: \"It is horrible, unheard-of--still, perhaps it is the best thing to do.  Well, go to meet the governor,--ride off, ride off!\"  And when the sweet, warm-hearted, joyous creature clang round her neck she was glad of her own weakness: this fair, fresh, and blooming bud of humanity should not pine in confinement and seclusion; she should find and give happiness, to her own joy and that of all good souls, and unfold to a full and perfect flower.  And Eudoxia knew the widow well; she knew that Joanna would by-and-bye understand why she helped the child to escape the greatest peril that can hang over a human soul: that of living in perpetual conflict with itself in the effort to become something totally different from what, by natural gifts and inclinations, it is intended to be.  With a sigh of anguish Eudoxia reflected what she herself, forced by cruel fate and lacking freedom and pleasurable ease, had become, from an ardent and generous young creature; and she, the narrow-hearted teacher, could make allowances for the strange, adventurous yearning of a child, where a larger souled woman might have derided, and blamed and repressed it.  When it was daylight Eudoxia fulfilled the offices she commonly left to the maid: she arranged Mary's hair, talking to her and listening the while, as though in this night the child had developed into a woman. Then she went into the garden with her, and hardly let her out of her sight.  At breakfast Joanna and Pulcheria wondered at her singular behavior, but it did not displease them, and Marv was radiant with contentment.  The widow made no objection to allowing the child to go into the city to execute her uncle's mysterious commission.  Rustem was with her; and whatever it was that made the child so happy must certainly be right and unobjectionable.  Orion's maps and lists were sent to the prison early in the day, and before the child set out with her stalwart escort Gibbus had returned with the prisoner's letter to the Arab governor.  On their way it was agreed that Mary should join Rustem at dusk at the riverside inn of Nesptah.  In these clays of famine and death beasts of burthen of every description were easily procurable, as well as attendants and guides; and the Masdakite, who was experienced in such matters, thought it best to purchase none but swift dromedaries and to carry only a light tent for the \"little mistress!\"  At the door of Gamaliel's shop Mary bid him wait; the jovial goldsmith welcomed her with genuine pleasure....  What had befallen the house of the Mukaukas!  Fire had destroyed the dwelling-place of justice, like the Egyptian cities to whom the prophet had announced a similar fate a thousand years since.  Gamaliel knew in what peril Orion stood, and the fate that hung over the noble maiden who had once given him the costliest of gems, and afterwards entrusted to him a portion of her fortune.  To see any member of his patron's family alive and well rejoiced his heart.  He asked Mary one sympathizing question after another, and his wife wanted to give her some of her good apricot tarts; but the little girl begged Gamaliel to grant her at once a private interview, so the jeweller led her into his little work-shop, bidding her trust him entirely, for whatever a grandchild of Mukaukas George might ask of him it was granted beforehand.  Blushing with confusion she took Orion's ring out of its wrapper, offered it to the Jew, and desired him to give her whatever was right.  She looked enquiringly into his face with her bright eyes, in full confidence that the kind-hearted man would at once pay her down gold coins and to spare; but he did not even take the ring out of her hand. He merely glanced at it, and said gravely:  \"Nay, my little maid, we do not do business with children.\"  \"But I want the money, Gamaliel,\" she urged.  \"I must have it.\"  \"Must?\"  he repeated with a smile.  \"Well, must is a nail that drives through wood, no doubt; but if it hits iron it is apt to bend.  Not that I am so hard as that; but money, money, money!  And whose money do you mean, little maid?  If you want money of mine to spend in bread, or in cakes, which is more likely, I will shut my eyes and put my hand boldly into my wallet; but, if I am not mistaken, you are well provided for by Rufinus the Greek, in whose house there is no lack of anything; and I have a nice round sum in my own keeping which your grandfather placed in my hands at interest two years since, with a remark that it was a legacy to you from your godmother, and the papers stand in your name; so your necessity looks very like what other folks would call ease.\"  \"Necessity!  I am in no necessity,\" Mary broke in.  \"But I want the money all the same; and if I have some of my own, and you perhaps have it there in your box, give me as much of it as I want.\"  \"As much as you want?\"  laughed the jeweller.  \"Not so fast, little maid. Before such matters can be settled here in Egypt we must have plenty of time, and papyrus and ink, a grand law court, sixteen witnesses, a Kyrios.  .  .\"  \"Well then, buy the ring!  You are such a good, kind man Gamaliel.  Just to please me.  Why, you yourself do not really think that I want to buy cakes!\"  \"No.  But in these hard times, when so many are starving, a soft heart may be moved to other follies.\"  \"No indeed!  Do buy the ring; and if you will do me this favor.  .  .\"  \"Old Gamaliel will be both a rogue and a simpleton!--Have you forgotten the emerald?  I bought that, and a pretty piece of business that was! I can have nothing to say to the ring, my little maid.\"  Mary withdrew her hand, and the grief and disappointment expressed by her large, tearful eyes were so bitter and touching, that the Jew paused, and then went on seriously and heartily:  \"I would sooner give my own old head to be an anvil than distress you, sweet child; and Adonai!  I do not mean to say--why should I--that you should ever leave old Gamaliel without money.  He has plenty, and though he is always ready to take, he is ready to give, too, when it is meet and fitting.  I cannot buy the ring, to be sure, but do not be down-hearted and look me well in the face, little maid.  It is much to ask, and I have handsomer things in my stores, but if you see anything in it that gives you confidence, speak out and whisper to the man of whom even your grandfather had some good opinion: 'I want so much, and what is more--how did you put it?--what is more, I must have it.'\"  Mary did see something in the Jew's merry round face that inspired her with trust, and in her childlike belief in the sanctity of an oath she made a third person--a believer too, in a third form of religion--swear not to betray her secret, only marvelling that the administering of the oath, in which she had now had some practice, should be so easy.  Even grown-up people will sometimes buy another's dearest secret for a light asseveration.  And when she had thus ensured the Israelite's silence, she confided to him that she was charged by Orion to send out a messenger to meet Amru, that he and Paula might be reprieved in time.  The goldsmith listened attentively, and even before she had ended he was busying himself with an iron chest built into the wall, and interrupted her to ask!  \"How much?\"  She named the sum that Nilus had suggested, and hardly had she finished her story when the Jew, who kept the trick by which he opened the chest a secret even from his wife, exclaimed:  \"Now, go and look out of the window, you wonder among envoys and money- borrowers, and if you see nothing in the courtyard, then fancy to yourself that a man is standing there who looks like old Gamaliel, and who puts his hand on your head and gives you a good kiss.  And you may fancy him, too, as saying to himself: 'God in Heaven! if only my little daughter, my Ruth may be such another as little Mary, grandchild of the just Mukaukas!'\"  And as he spoke, the vivacious but stout man, who had dropped on his knees, rose panting, left the lid of his strong box open, hurried up to the child, who had been standing at the window all the while, and bending over her from behind pressed a kiss on her curly head, saying with a laugh: \"There, little pickpocket, that is my interest.  But look out still, till I call you again.\"  He nimbly trotted back on his short little legs, wiping his eyes; took from the strong box a little bag of gold, which contained rather more than the desired sum, locked the chest again, looking at Mary with a mixture of suspicion and hearty approbation; then at last he called her to him.  He emptied the money-bag before her, counted out the sum she needed, put the remainder of the coins into his girdle, and handed the bag to the little girl requesting her to count his \"advance\", back into it, while he, with a cunning smile, quitted the room.  He presently returned and she had finished her task, but she timidly observed: \"One gold piece is wanting.\"  At this he clasped his hands over his breast and raised his eyes to Heaven exclaiming: \"My God! what a child.  There is the solidus, child; and you may take my word for it as a man of experience: whatever you undertake will prosper.  You know what you are about; and when you are grown up and a suitor comes he will go to a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5528"],["title","The Bride of the Nile â€” Volume 12 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      THE BRIDE OF THE NILE  By Georg Ebers  Volume 12.    CHAPTER XXI.  While Rustem, to whom Mary had entrusted the jeweller's gold, was making his preparations for their journey with all the care of a practised guide, and while Mary was comforting her governess and Mandane, to whom she explained that Rustem's journey was to save Paula's life, a fresh trial was going forward in the Court of Justice.  This time Orion was the accused.  He had scarcely begun to study the maps and lists he required for his undertaking when he was bidden to appear before his judges.  The members composing the Court were the same as yesterday.  Among the witnesses were Paula and the new bishop, as well as Gamaliel, who had been sent for soon after Mary had left him.  The prosecutor accused the son of the Mukaukas of having made away, in defiance of the patriarch's injunction, with a costly emerald bequeathed to the Church by his father.  Orion had determined to conduct his own defence; he recapitulated everything that he had told the prelate in self-justification in his father's private room, and then added, that to put a speedy end to this odious affair he was now prepared to restore the stone, and he placed it at the disposal of his judges.  He handed Paula's emerald to the Kadi who presented it to the bishop.  John, however, did not seem satisfied; he referred to the written testimony of the widow Susannah, who had been present when the deceased Mukaukas had designated all the jewels in the Persian hanging as included in his gift to the Church.  This was in Orion's presence so he was still under suspicion of a fraud; and it was difficult to determine whether the fine gem now lying on the table before them were indeed the same to which the Church laid claim.  All this was urged with excessive vehemence and bore the stamp of a hostile purpose.  Obedience and conviction alike prompted the zealous prelate to this demeanor, for the same carrier-pigeon which had brought from the patriarch his appointment to the bishopric required him to insist on Orion's punishment, for he was a thorn in the flesh of the Jacobite church, a tainted sheep who might infect the rest of the flock.  If the young man should offer an emerald it was therefore to be closely examined, to see whether it were the original stone or a substitute.  On these grounds the bishop had expressed his doubts, and though they gave rise to an indignant murmur among the judges, the Kadi so far admitted the prelate's suspicions as to explain that last evening a letter had reached him from his uncle at Djidda, Haschim the merchant, in which mention was made of the emerald.  His son happened to have weighed that stone, without his knowledge, before he started for Egypt, and Othman had here a note of its exact weight.  The Jew Gamaliel had been desired to attend with his balances, and could at once use them to satisfy the bishop.  The jeweller immediately proceeded to do so, and old Horapollo, who was an expert in such matters, went close up to him, and watched him narrowly.  It was in feverish anxiety, and more eagerly than any other bystander, that Paula and Orion kept their eyes fixed on the Jew's hands and lips; after weighing it once, he did so a second time.  Old Horapollo himself weighed it a third time, with a keen eye though his hands trembled a little; all three experiments gave the same result: this gem was heavier by a few grains of doura than that which the merchant's son had weighed, and yet the Jew declared that there was no purer, clearer, or finer emerald in the world than this.  Orion breathed more freely, and the question arose among the judges as to whether the young Arab might have failed in precision, or an exchange had in fact been effected.  This was difficult to imagine, since in that case the accused would have given himself the loss, and the Church the advantage.  The bishop, an honest man, now said that the patriarch's suspicions had certainly led him too far in this instance, and after this he spoke no more.  All through this enquiry the Vekeel had kept silence, but the defiant gaze, assured of triumph, which he fixed on Paula and Orion alternately, augured the worst.  When the prosecutor next accused the young man of complicity in the much discussed escape of the nuns Orion again asserted his innocence, pointing out that during the fatal contest between the Arabs and the champions of the sisters, he had been with the Arab governor, as Amru himself could testify.  By an act of unparalleled despotism, he had been deprived of his estates and his freedom on mere false suspicion, and he put his trust in the first instance in a just sentence from his judges and, failing that, he threw himself on the protection and satisfaction of his sovereign lord the Khaliff.  As he spoke his eyes flashed flames at the Vekeel; but the negro still preserved his self-control, and this doubled the alarm of those who wished the youth well.  It was clear from all this that Obada felt sure that he had the noose well around his victim's neck, and why he thought so, soon became evident; for Orion had hardly finished his defence when he rose, and with a malicious grin, handed to the Kadi the little tablet given him yesterday by old Horapollo, describing it as a document addressed to Paula and desiring the Kadi to examine it.  The heat had effaced much of what had been written on the wax, but most of the words could still be deciphered.  The venerable Horapollo had already made them out, and was quite ready to read to the judges all that the accused--who by his own account, was a spotless dove--had written in his innocence and truthfulness for his fair one.  He signed to the old man and helped him as he rose with difficulty, but the Kadi begged him to wait, made himself acquainted with the contents of the letter by the help of the interpreter, and when the man had, with much pains, fulfilled his task, he turned, not to Horapollo, but to Obada, and asked whence this document had come.  \"From Paula's desk,\" replied the Vekeel.  \"My old friend found it there.\" He pointed to Horapollo, who confirmed his statement by a nod of assent.  The Kadi rose, went up to the girl, whose cheeks were pale with indignation, and asked whether she recognized the tablets as her property; Paula, after convincing herself, replied with a flaming glance of scorn and aversion at Horapollo: \"Yes, my lord.  It is mine.  That base old man has taken it with atrocious meanness from among my things.\" For an instant her voice failed her; then, turning to the judges, she exclaimed:  \"If there is one among you to whom helplessness and innocence are sacred and malice and cunning odious, I beg him to go to Rufinus' wife, over whose threshold this man has crept like a ferret into a dovecote, for no other end but to tread hospitable kindness in the dust, to rifle her home and make use of whatever might serve his vile purpose--to go, I say, and warn the lonely woman against this treacherous spy and thief.\"  At this the old man, gasping and inarticulate, raised his withered arm; the Christian judges whispered together, but at cross-purposes, while the Jew fidgeted his round little person on the bench, drumming incessantly with his fingers on his breast, and trying to meet Orion's or Paula's eye and to make her understand that he was the man who would warn Joanna. But a thump from the Vekeel's fist, that came down on his shoulder unawares, reduced him to sitting still; and while he sat rubbing the place with subdued sounds of pain, not daring to reproach the all- powerful negro for his violence, the Kadi gave the tablets to Horapollo and bid him read the letter.  But the terrible accusation cast at him by the hated Patrician maiden, ascribing his removal to Rufinus house to a motive which, in truth, had been far from his, had so enraged and agitated him that his old lungs, at all times feeble, refused their office.  This woman had done him a fresh wrong, for he had gone to live with the widow from the kindest impulse; only an accident had thrown this document in his way.  And yet it would not fail to be reported to Joanna in the course of the day that he had gone to her house as a spy, and there would be an end to the pleasant life of which he had dreamed--nay, even Philippus might perhaps quarrel with him.  And all, all through this woman.  He could not utter a word but, as he sank back on the seat, a glance so full of hatred, so dark with malignant fury, fell on Paula that she shuddered, and told herself that this man was ready to die himself if only he could drag her down too.  The interpreter now began to read Orion's letter and to translate it for the Arabs; and while he blundered through it, declaring that not a letter could be plainly made out, she recovered her self-control and, before the interpreter had done his task, a gleam as of sunshine lighted up her pure features.  Some great, lofty, and rapturous thought must have flashed through her brain, and it was evident that she had seized it and was feeding on it.  Orion, sitting opposite to her, noticed this; still, he did not understand what her beseeching gaze had to say to him, what it asked of him as she pressed her hand on her breast, and looked into his eyes with such urgent entreaty that it went to his very heart.  The interpreter ceased; but what he had read had had a great effect on the judges.  The Kadi's benevolent face expressed extreme apprehension, and the contents of the letter were indeed such as to cause it.  It ran as follows:  \"After waiting for you a long time in vain, I must at last make up my mind to go; and how much I still had to say to you.  A written farewell.\"  Here a few lines were effaced, and then"]]]
