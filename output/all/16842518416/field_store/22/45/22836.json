In her youth her father had kept her very strictly, but still he had allowed her to go through the streets of the town with her young companions, wreathed with flowers, and all dressed in their best, in the procession of maidens at the feast of Venus of Arelas, to whom all the women of her native town were wont to turn with prayers and sacrifices when their hearts were touched by love.  Now she tried to pray to Venus, but again and again the wanton jests of the men who were used to accompany the maidens came into her mind, and memories of how she herself had eagerly listened for the only too frequent cries of admiration, and had enticed the silent with a glance, or thanked the more clamorous with a smile.  To-day certainly she had no mind for such sport, and she recollected the stern words which had fallen from Dorothea's lips on the worship of Venus, when she had once told her how well the natives of Arelas knew how to keep their feasts.  And Polykarp, whose heart was nevertheless so full of love, he no doubt thought like his mother, and she pictured him as she had frequently seen him following his parents by the side of his sister Marthana--often hand in hand with her--as they went to church.  The senator's son had always had a kindly glance for her, excepting when he was one of this procession to the temple of the God of whom they said that He was love itself, and whose votaries indeed were not poor in love; for in Petrus' house, if anywhere, all hearts were united by a tender affection.  It then occurred to her that Paulus had just now advised her to turn to the crucified God of the Christians, who was full of an equal and divine love to all men. To him Polykarp also prayed--was praying perhaps this very hour; and if she now did the same her prayers would ascend together with his, and so she might be in some sort one with that beloved friend, from whom everything else conspired to part her.  She knelt down and folded her hands, as she had so often seen Christians do, and she reflected on the torments that the poor Man, who hung with pierced hands on the cross, had so meekly endured, though He suffered innocently; she felt the deepest pity for Him, and softly said to herself, as she raised her eyes to the low roof of her cave-dwelling:  \"Thou poor good Son of God, Thou knowest what it is when all men condemn us unjustly, and surely, Thou canst understand when I say to Thee how sore my poor heart is!  And they say too, that of all hearts Thine is the most loving, and so thou wilt know how it is that, in spite of all my misery, it still seems to me that I am a happy woman.  The very breath of a God must be rapture, and that Thou too must have learned when they tortured and mocked Thee, for Thou halt suffered out of love.  They say, that Thou wast wholly pure and perfectly sinless.  Now I--I have committed many follies, but not a sin--a real sin--no, indeed, I have not; and Thou must know it, for Thou art a God, and knowest the past, and canst read hearts.  And, indeed, I also would fain remain innocent, and yet how can that be when I cannot help being devoted to Polykarp, and yet I am another man's wife.  But am I indeed the true and lawful wife of that horrible wretch who sold me to another?  He is as far from my heart --as far as if I had never seen him with these eyes.  And yet--believe me--I wish him no ill, and I will be quite content, if only I need never go back to him.  \"When I was a child, I was afraid of frogs; my brothers and sisters knew it, and once my brother Licinius laid a large one, that he had caught, on my bare neck.  I started, and shuddered, and screamed out loud, for it was so hideously cold and damp--I cannot express it.  And that is exactly how I have always felt since those days in Rome whenever Phoebicius touched me, and yet I dared not scream when he did.  \"But Polykarp! oh! would that he were here, and might only grasp my hand. He said I was his own, and yet I have never encouraged him.  But now! if a danger threatened him or a sorrow, and if by any means I could save him from it, indeed--indeed--though I never could bear pain well, and am afraid of death, I would let them nail me to a cross for him, as Thou wast crucified for us all.  \"But then he must know that I had died for him, and if he looked into my dying eyes with his strange, deep gaze, I would tell him that it is to him that I owe a love so great that it is a thing altogether different and higher than any love I have ever before seen.  And a feeling that is so far above all measure of what ordinary mortals experience, it seems to me, must be divine.  Can such love be wrong?  I know not; but Thou knowest, and Thou, whom they name the Good Shepherd, lead Thou us-- each apart from the other, if it be best so for him--but yet, if it be possible, unite us once more, if it be only for one single hour.  If only he could know that I am not wicked, and that poor Sirona would willingly belong to him, and to no other, then I would be ready to die.  O Thou good, kind Shepherd, take me too into Thy flock, and guide me.\"  Thus prayed Sirona, and before her fancy there floated the image of a lovely and loving youthful form; she had seen the original in the model for Polykarp's noble work, and she had not forgotten the exquisite details of the face.  It seemed to her as well known and familiar as if she had known--what in fact she could not even guess--that she herself had had some share in the success of the work.  The love which unites two hearts is like the ocean of Homer which encircles both halves of the earth.  It flows and rolls on.  Where shall we seek its source--here or there--who can tell?  It was Dame Dorothea who in her motherly pride had led the Gaulish lady into her son's workshop.  Sirona thought of her and her husband and her house, where over the door a motto was carved in the stone which she had seen every morning from her sleeping-room.  She could not read Greek, but Polykarp's sister, Marthana, had more than once told her what it meant. \"Commit thy way to the Lord, and put thy trust in Him,\" ran the inscription, and she repeated it to herself again and again, and then drew fancy-pictures of the future in smiling day-dreams, which by degrees assumed sharper outlines and brighter colors.  She saw herself united to Polykarp, and as the daughter of Petrus and Dorothea, at home in the senator's house; she had a right now to the children who loved her, and who were so dear to her; she helped the deaconess in all her labors, and won praise, and looks of approval.  She had learned to use her hands in her father's house and now she could show what she could do; Polykarp even gazed at her with surprise and admiration, and said that she was as clever as she was beautiful, and promised to become a second Dorothea.  She went with him into his workshop, and there arranged all the things that lay about in confusion, and dusted it, while he followed her every movement with his gaze, and at last stood before her, his arms wide--wide open to clasp her.  She started, and pressed her hands over her eyes, and flung herself loving and beloved on his breast, and would have thrown her arms round his neck, while her hot tears flowed--but the sweet vision was suddenly shattered, for a swift flash of light pierced the gloom of the cavern, and immediately after she heard the heavy roll of the thunder-clap, dulled by the rocky walls of her dwelling.  Completely recalled to actuality she listened for a moment, and then stepped to the entrance of the cave.  It was already dusk, and heavy rain-drops were falling from the dark clouds which seemed to shroud the mountain peaks in a vast veil of black crape.  Paulus was nowhere to be seen, but there stood the food he had prepared for her.  She had eaten nothing since her breakfast, and she now tried to drink the milk, but it had curdled and was not fit to use; a small bit of bread and a few dates quite satisfied her.  As the lightning and thunder began to follow each other more and more quickly, and the darkness fast grew deeper, a great fear fell upon her; she pushed the food on one side, and looked up to the mountain where the peaks were now wholly veiled in night, now seemed afloat in a sea of flame, and more distinctly visible than by daylight.  Again and again a forked flash like a saw-blade of fire cut through the black curtain of cloud with terrific swiftness, again and again the thunder sounded like a blast of trumpets through the silent wilderness, and multiplied itself, clattering, growling, roaring, and echoing from rock to rock.  Light and sound at last seemed to be hurled from Heaven together, and the very rock in which her cave was formed quaked.  Crushed and trembling she drew back into the inmost depth of her rocky chamber, starting at each flash that illumined the darkness.  At length they occurred at longer intervals, the thunder lost its appalling fury, and as the wind drove the storm farther and farther to the southwards, at last it wholly died away.     CHAPTER XVII.  It was quite dark in Sirona's cavern, fearfully dark, and the blacker grew the night which shrouded her, the more her terror increased.  From time to time she shut her eyes as tightly as she could, for she fancied she could see a crimson glare, and she longed for light in that hour as a drowning man longs for the shore.  Dark forebodings of every kind oppressed her soul.  What if Paulus had abandoned her, and had left her to her fate?  Or if Polykarp should have been searching for her on the mountain in this storm, and in the darkness should have fallen into some abyss, or have been struck by the lightning?  Suppose the mass of rock that overhung the entrance to the cave should have been loosened in the storm, and should fall, and bar her exit to the open air?  Then she would be buried alive, and she must perish alone, without seeing him whom she loved once more, or telling him that she "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5497"],["title","Homo Sum — Volume 04 (#8)"],["body","not been unworthy of his trust in her.  Cruelly tormented by such thoughts as these, she dragged herself up and felt her way out into the air and wind, for she could no longer hold out in the gloomy solitude and fearful darkness.  She had hardly reached the mouth of the cave, when she heard steps approaching her lurking place, and again she shrank back.  Who was it that could venture in this pitch- dark night to climb from rock to rock?  Was it Paulus returning?  Was it he--was it Polykarp seeking her?  She felt intoxicated; she pressed her hands to her heart, and longed to cry out, but she dared not, and her tongue refused its office.  She listened with the tension of terror to the sound of the steps which came straight towards her nearer and nearer, then the wanderer perceived the faint gleam of her white dress, and called out to her.  It was Paulus.  She drew a deep breath of relief when she recognized his voice, and answered his call.  \"In such weather as this,\" said the anchorite, \"it is better to be within than without, it seems to me, for it is not particularly pleasant out here, so far as I have found.\"  \"But it has been frightful here inside the cave too,\" Sirona answered, \"I have been so dreadfully frightened, I was so lonely in the horrible darkness.  If only I had had my little dog with me, it would at least have been a living being.\"  \"I have made haste as well as I could,\" interrupted Paulus.  \"The paths are not so smooth here as the Kanopic road in Alexandria, and as I have not three necks like Cerberus, who lies at the feet of Serapis, it would have been wiser of me to return to you a little more leisurely.  The storm-bird has swallowed up all the stars as if they were flies, and the poor old mountain is so grieved at it, that streams of tears are everywhere flowing over his stony cheeks.  It is wet even here.  Now go back into the cave, and let me lay this that I have got here for you in my arms, in the dry passage.  I bring you good news; to-morrow evening, when it is growing dusk, we start.  I have found out a vessel which will convey us to Klysma, and from thence I myself will conduct you to Alexandria.  In the sheepskin here you will find the dress and veil of an Amalekite woman, and if your traces are to be kept hidden from Phoebicius, you must accommodate yourself to this disguise; for if the people down there were to see you as I saw you to-day, they would think that Aphrodite herself had risen from the sea, and the report of the fair-haired beauty that had appeared among them would soon spread even to the oasis.\"  \"But it seems to me that I am well hidden here,\" replied Sirona.  \"I am afraid of a sea-voyage, and even if we succeeded in reaching Alexandria without impediment, still I do not know--\"  \"It shall be my business to provide for you there.\"  Paulus interrupted with a decision that was almost boastful, and that somewhat disturbed Sirona.  \"You know the fable of the ass in the lion's skin, but there are lions who wear the skin of an ass on their shoulders--or of a sheep, it comes to the same thing.  Yesterday you were speaking of the splendid palaces of the citizens, and lauding the happiness of their owners.  You shall dwell in one of those marble houses, and rule it as its mistress, and it shall be my care to procure you slaves, and litter-bearers, and a carriage with four mules.  Do not doubt my word, for I am promising nothing that I cannot perform.  The rain is ceasing, and I will try to light a fire.  You want nothing more to eat?  Well then, I will wish you good-night.  The rest will all do to-morrow.\"  Sirona had listened in astonishment to the anchorite's promises.  How often had she envied those who possessed all that her strange protector now promised her--and now it had not the smallest charm for her; and, fully determined in any case not to follow Paulus, whom she began to distrust, she replied, as she coldly returned his greeting, \"There are many hours yet before tomorrow evening in which we can discuss everything.\"  While Paulus was with great difficulty rekindling the fire, she was once more alone, and again she began to be alarmed in the dark cavern.  She called the Alexandrian.  \"The darkness terrifies me so,\" she said. \"You still had some oil in the jug this morning; perhaps you may be able to contrive a little lamp for me; it is so fearful to stay here in the dark.\"  Paulus at once took a shard, tore a strip from his tattered coat, twisted it together, and laid it for a wick in the greasy fluid, lighted it at the slowly reviving fire, and putting this more than simple light in Sirona's hand, he said, \"It will serve its purpose; in Alexandria I will see that you have lamps which give more light, and which are made by a better artist.\"  Sirona placed the lamp in a hollow in the rocky wall at the head of her bed, and then lay down to rest.  Light scares away wild beasts and fear too from the resting-place of man, and it kept terrifying thoughts far away from the Gaulish woman.  She contemplated her situation clearly and calmly, and quite decided that she would neither quit the cave, nor entrust herself to the anchorite, till she had once more seen and spoken to Polykarp.  He no doubt knew where to seek her, and certainly, she thought, he would by this time have returned, if the storm and the starless night had not rendered it an impossibility to come up the mountain from the oasis.  \"To-morrow I shall see him again, and then I will open my heart to him, and he shall read my soul like a book, and on every page, and in every line he will find his own name.  And I will tell him too that I have prayed to his 'Good Shepherd,' and how much good it has done me, and that I will be a Christian like his sister Marthana and his mother.  Dorothea will be glad indeed when she hears it, and she at any rate cannot have thought that I was wicked, for she always loved me, and the children--the children--\"  The bright crowd of merry faces came smiling in upon her fancy, and her thoughts passed insensibly into dreams; kindly sleep touched her heart with its gentle hand, and its breath swept every shadow of trouble from her soul.  She slept, smiling and untroubled as a child whose eyes some guardian angel softly kisses, while her strange protector now turned the flickering wood on the damp hearth and with a reddening face blew up the dying charcoal-fire, and again walked restlessly up and down, and paused each time he passed the entrance to the cave, to throw a longing glance at the light which shone out from Sirona's sleeping-room.  Since the moment when he had flung Polykarp to the ground, Paulus had not succeeded in recovering his self-command; not for a moment had he regretted the deed, for the reflection had never occurred to him, that a fall on the stony soil of the Sacred Mountain, which was as hard as iron, must hurt more than a fall on the' sand of the arena.  \"The impudent fellow,\" thought he, \"richly deserved what he got.  Who gave him a better right over Sirona than he, Paulus himself, had--he who had saved her life, and had taken it upon himself to protect her?\"  Her great beauty had charmed him from the first moment of their meeting, but no impure thought stirred his heart as he gazed at her with delight, and listened with emotion to her childlike talk.  It was the hot torrent of Polykarp's words that had first thrown the spark into his soul, which jealousy and the dread of having to abandon Sirona to another, had soon fanned into a consuming flame.  He would not give up this woman, he would continue to care for her every need, she should owe everything to him, and to him only.  And so, without reserve, he devoted himself body and soul to the preparations for her flight.  The hot breath of the storm, the thunder and lightning, torrents of rain, and blackness of night could not delay him, while he leaped from rock to rock, feeling his way-soaked through, weary and in peril; he thought only of her, and of how he could most safely carry her to Alexandria, and then surround her with all that could charm a woman's taste.  Nothing--nothing did he desire for himself, and all that he dreamed of and planned turned only and exclusively on the pleasure which he might afford her.  When he had prepared and lighted the lamp for her he saw her again, and was startled at the beauty of the face that the trembling flame revealed.  He could observe her a few seconds only, and then she had vanished, and he must remain alone in the darkness and the rain.  He walked restlessly up and down, and an agonizing longing once more to see her face lighted up by the pale flame, and the white arm that she had held out to take the lamp, grew more and more strong in him and accelerated the pulses of his throbbing heart.  As often as he passed the cave, and observed the glimmer of light that came from her room, he felt prompted and urged to slip in, and to gaze on her once more.  He never once thought of prayer and scourging, his old means of grace, he sought rather for a reason that might serve him as an excuse if he went in, and it struck him that it was cold, and that a sheepskin was lying in the cavern.  He would fetch it, in spite of his vow never to wear a sheepskin again; and supposing he were thus enabled to see her, what next?  When he had Stepped across the threshold, an inward voice warned him to return, and told him that he must be treading the path of unrighteousness, for that he was stealing in on tiptoe like a thief; but the excuse was ready at once.  \"That is for fear of waking her, if she is asleep.\"  And now all further reflection was silenced for he had already reached the spot where, at the end of the rocky passage, the cave widened into her sleeping-room; there she lay on her hard couch, sunk in slumber and enchantingly fair.  A deep gloom reigned around, and the feeble light of the little lamp lighted up only a small portion of the dismal chamber but the head, throat, and"]]]
