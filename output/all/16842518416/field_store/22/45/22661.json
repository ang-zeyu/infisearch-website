Was it really Amon who had appeared in human form at his call?  Was he indeed a son of the Gods, and did their blood flow in his veins?  The Immortals had shown him peculiar favor, but still he was but a man; that he realized from the pain in his wound, and the treason to which he had been a victim.  He felt as if he had been respited on the very scaffold.  Yes; he was a man like all other men, and so he would still be.  He rejoiced in the obscurity that veiled his future, in the many weaknesses which he had in common with those whom he loved, and even in the feeling that he, under the same conditions of life as his contemporaries, had more responsibilities than they.  Shortly after his victory, after all the important passes and strongholds had been conquered by his troops, he set out for Egypt with his train and the vanquished princes.  He sent two of his sons to Bent-Anat at Megiddo, to escort her by sea to Pelusium; he knew that the commandant of the harbor of that frontier fortress, at the easternmost limit of his kingdom, was faithful to him, and he ordered that his daughter should not quit the ship till he arrived, to secure her against any attempt on the part of the Regent.  A large part of the material of war, and most of the wounded, were also sent to Egypt by sea.    CHAPTER XL.  Nearly three months had passed since the battle of Kadesh, and to-day the king was expected, on his way home with his victorious army, at Pelusium, the strong hold and key of Egyptian dominion in the east.  Splendid preparations had been made for his reception, and the man who took the lead in the festive arrangements with a zeal that was doubly effective from his composed demeanor was no less a person than the Regent Ani.  His chariot was to be seen everywhere: now he was with the workmen, who were to decorate triumphal arches with fresh flowers; now with the slaves, who were hanging garlands on the wooden lions erected on the road for this great occasion; now--and this detained him longest--he watched the progress of the immense palace which was being rapidly constructed of wood on the site where formerly the camp of the Hyksos had stood, in which the actual ceremony of receiving the king was to take place, and where the Pharaoh and his immediate followers were to reside.  It had been found possible, by employing several thousand laborers, to erect this magnificent structure, in a few weeks, and nothing was lacking to it that could be desired, even by a king so accustomed as Rameses to luxury and splendor.  A high exterior flight of steps led from the garden--which had been created out of a waste--to the vestibule, out of which the banqueting hall opened.  This was of unusual height, and had a vaulted wooden ceiling, which was painted blue and sprinkled with stars, to represent the night heavens, and which was supported on pillars carved, some in the form of date- palms, and some like cedars of Lebanon; the leaves and twigs consisted of artfully fastened and colored tissue; elegant festoons of bluish gauze were stretched from pillar to pillar across the hall, and in the centre of the eastern wall they were attached to a large shell-shaped canopy extending over the throne of the king, which was decorated with pieces of green and blue glass, of mother of pearl, of shining plates of mica, and other sparkling objects.  The throne itself had the shape of a buckler, guarded by two lions, which rested on each side of it and formed the arms, and supported on the backs of four Asiatic captives who crouched beneath its weight.  Thick carpets, which seemed to have transported the sea-shore on to the dry land-for their pale blue ground was strewn with a variety of shells, fishes, and water plants-covered the floor of the banqueting hall, in which three hundred seats were placed by the tables, for the nobles of the kingdom and the officers of the troops.  Above all this splendor hung a thousand lamps, shaped like lilies and tulips, and in the entrance hall stood a huge basket of roses to be strewn before the king when he should arrive.  Even the bed-rooms for the king and his suite were splendidly decorated; finely embroidered purple stuffs covered the walls, a light cloud of pale blue gauze hung across the ceiling, and giraffe skins were laid instead of carpets on the floors.  The barracks intended for the soldiers and bodyguard stood nearer to the city, as well as the stable buildings, which were divided from the palace by the garden which surrounded it.  A separate pavilion, gilt and wreathed with flowers, was erected to receive the horses which had carried the king through the battle, and which he had dedicated to the Sun-God.  The Regent Ani, accompanied by Katuti, was going through the whole of these slightly built structures.  \"It  seems to  me all quite complete,\"  said the widow.  \"Only one thing I cannot make up my mind about,\" replied Ani, \"whether most to admire your inventive genius or your exquisite taste.\"  \"Oh! let that pass,\" said Katuti smiling.  \"If any thing deserves your praise it is my anxiety to serve you.  How many things had to be considered before this structure at last stood complete on this marshy spot where the air seemed alive with disgusting insects and now it is finished how long will it last?\"  Ani looked down.  \"How long?\" he repeated.  Then he continued: \"There is great risk already of the plot miscarrying.  Ameni has grown cool, and will stir no further in the matter; the troops on which I counted are perhaps still faithful to me, but much too weak; the Hebrews, who tend their flocks here, and whom I gained over by liberating them from forced labor, have never borne arms.  And you know the people.  They will kiss the feet of the conqueror if they have to wade up to there through the blood of their children.  Besides--as it happens--the hawk which old Hekt keeps as representing me is to-day pining and sick--\"  \"It will be all the prouder and brighter to-morrow if you are a man!\" exclaimed Katuti, and her eyes sparkled with scorn.  \"You cannot now retreat.  Here in Pelusium you welcome Rameses as if he were a God, and he accepts the honor.  I know the king, he is too proud to be distrustful, and so conceited that he can never believe himself deceived in any man, either friend or foe.  The man whom he appointed to be his Regent, whom he designated as the worthiest in the land, he will most unwillingly condemn.  Today you still have the car of the king; to-morrow he will listen to your enemies, and too much has occurred in Thebes to be blotted out.  You are in the position of a lion who has his keeper on one side, and the bars of his cage on the other.  If you let the moment pass without striking you will remain in the cage; but if you act and show yourself a lion your keepers are done for!\"  \"You urge me on and on,\" said Ani.  \"But supposing your plan were to fail, as Paaker's well considered plot failed?\"  \"Then you are no worse off than you are now,\" answered Katuti.  \"The Gods rule the elements, not men.  Is it likely that you should finish so beautiful a structure with such care only to destroy it?  And we have no accomplices, and need none.\"  \"But who shall set the brand to the room which Nemu and the slave have filled with straw and pitch?\"  asked Ani.  \"I,\" said Katuti decidedly.  \"And one who has nothing to look for from Rameses.\"  \"Who is that?\"  \"Paaker.\"  Is the Mohar here?\"  asked the Regent surprised.  \"You yourself have seen him.\"  \"You are mistaken,\" said Ani.  \"I should--\"  \"Do you recollect the one-eyed, grey-haired, blackman, who yesterday brought me a letter?  That was my sister's son.\"  The Regent struck his forehead--\"Poor wretch\" he muttered.  \"He is frightfully altered,\" said Katuti.  \"He need not have blackened his face, for his own mother would not know him again:  He lost an eye in his fight with Mena, who also wounded him in the lungs with a thrust of his sword, so that he breathes and speaks with difficulty, his broad shoulders have lost their flesh, and the fine legs he swaggered about on have shrunk as thin as a negro's.  I let him pass as my servant without any hesitation or misgiving.  He does not yet know of my purpose, but I am sure that he would help us if a thousand deaths threatened him.  For God's sake put aside all doubts and fears!  We will shake the tree for you, if you will only hold out your hand to-morrow to pick up the fruit. Only one thing I must beg.  Command the head butler not to stint the wine, so that the guards may give us no trouble.  I know that you gave the order that only three of the five ships which brought the contents of your winelofts should be unloaded.  I should have thought that the future king of Egypt might have been less anxious to save!\"  Katuti's lips curled with contempt as she spoke the last words.  Ani observed this and said:  \"You think I am timid!  Well, I confess I would far rather that much which I have done at your instigation could be undone.  I would willingly renounce this new plot, though we so carefully planned it when we built and decorated this palace.  I will sacrifice the wine; there are jars of wine there that were old in my father's time--but it must be so!  You are right!  Many things have occurred which the king will not forgive!  You are right, you are right--do what seems good to you.  I will retire after the feast to the Ethiopian camp.\"  \"They will hail you as king as soon as the usurpers have fallen in the flames,\" cried Katuti.  \"If only a few set the example, the others will take up the cry, and even though you have offended Ameni he will attach himself to you rather than to Rameses.  Here he comes, and I already see the standards in the distance.\"  \"They are coming!\"  said the Regent.  \"One thing more! Pray see yourself that the princess Bent-Anat goes to the rooms intended for her; she must not be injured.\"  \"Still Bent-Anat?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5447"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 09 (#7)"],["body","Katuti with a smile full of meaning but without bitterness.  \"Be easy, her rooms are on the ground floor, and she shall be warned in time.\"  Ani turned to leave her; he glanced once more at the great hall, and said with a sigh.  \"My heart is heavy--I wish this day and this night were over!\"  \"You are like this grand hall,\" said Katuti smiling, \"which is now empty, almost dismal; but this evening, when it is crowded with guests, it will look very different.  You were born to be a king, and yet are not a king; you will not be quite yourself till the crown and sceptre are your own.\"  Ani smiled too, thanked her, and left her; but Katuti said to herself:  \"Bent-Anat may burn with the rest: I have no intention of sharing my power with her!\"  Crowds of men and women from all parts had thronged to Pelusium, to welcome the conqueror and his victorious army on the frontier.  Every great temple-college had sent a deputation to meet Rameses, that from the Necropolis consisting of five members, with Ameni and old Gagabu at their head.  The white-robed ministers of the Gods marched in solemn procession towards the bridge which lay across the eastern-Pelusiac-arm of the Nile, and led to Egypt proper--the land fertilized by the waters of the sacred stream.  The deputation from the temple of Memphis led the procession; this temple had been founded by Mena, the first king who wore the united crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, and Chamus, the king's son, was the high-priest. The deputation from the not less important temple of Heliopolis came next, and was followed by the representatives of the Necropolis of Thebes.  A few only of the members of these deputations wore the modest white robe of the simple priest; most of them were invested with the panther-skin which was worn by the prophets.  Each bore a staff decorated with roses, lilies, and green branches, and many carried censers in the form of a golden arm with incense in the hollow of the hand, to be burnt before the king.  Among the deputies from the priesthood at Thebes were several women of high rank, who served in the worship of this God, and among them was Katuti, who by the particular desire of the Regent had lately been admitted to this noble sisterhood.  Ameni walked thoughtfully by the side of the prophet Gagabu.  \"How differently everything has happened from what we hoped and intended!\" said Gagabu in a low voice.  \"We are like ambassadors with sealed credentials--who can tell their contents?\"  \"I welcome Rameses heartily and joyfully,\" said Ameni.  \"After that which happened to him at Kadesh he will come home a very different man to what he was when he set out.  He knows now what he owes to Amon.  His favorite son was already at the head of the ministers of the temple at Memphis, and he has vowed to build magnificent temples and to bring splendid offerings to the Immortals.  And Rameses keeps his word better than that smiling simpleton in the chariot yonder.\"  \"Still I am sorry for Ani,\" said Gagabu.  \"The Pharaoh will not punish him--certainly not,\" replied the high- priest.  \"And he will have nothing to fear from Ani; he is a feeble reed, the powerless sport of every wind.\"  \"And yet you hoped for great things from him!\"  \"Not from him, but through him--with us for his guides,\" replied Ameni in a low voice but with emphasis.  \"It is his own fault that I have abandoned his cause.  Our first wish--to spare the poet Pentaur--he would not respect, and he did not hesitate to break his oath, to betray us, and to sacrifice one of the noblest of God's creatures, as the poet was, to gratify a petty grudge.  It is harder to fight against cunning weakness than against honest enmity.  Shall we reward the man who has deprived the world of Pentaur by giving him a crown?  It is hard to quit the trodden way, and seek a better--to give up a half-executed plan and take a more promising one; it is hard, I say, for the individual man, and makes him seem fickle in the eyes of others; but we cannot see to the right hand and the left, and if we pursue a great end we cannot remain within the narrow limits which are set by law and custom to the actions of private individuals.  We draw back just as we seem to have reached the goal, we let him fall whom we had raised, and lift him, whom we had stricken to the earth, to the pinnacle of glory, in short we profess--and for thousands of years have professed--the doctrine that every path is a right one that leads to the great end of securing to the priesthood the supreme power in the land.  Rameses, saved by a miracle, vowing temples to the Gods, will for the future exhaust his restless spirit not in battle as a warrior, but in building as an architect.  He will make use of us, and we can always lead the man who needs us.  So I now hail the son of Seti with sincere joy.\"  Ameni was still speaking when the flags were hoisted on the standards by the triumphal arches, clouds of dust rolled up on the farther shore of the Nile, and the blare of trumpets was heard.  First came the horses which had carried Rameses through the fight, with the king himself, who drove them.  His eyes sparkled with joyful triumph as the people on the farther side of the bridge received him with shouts of joy, and the vast multitude hailed him with wild enthusiasm and tears of emotion, strewing in his path the spoils of their gardens-flowers, garlands, and palm-branches.  Ani marched at the head of the procession that went forth to meet him; he humbly threw himself in the dust before the horses, kissed the ground, and then presented to the king the sceptre that had been entrusted to him, lying on a silk cushion.  The king received it graciously, and when Ani took his robe to kiss it, the king bent down towards him, and touching the Regent's forehead with his lips, desired him to take the place by his side in the chariot, and fill the office of charioteer.  The king's eyes were moist with grateful emotion.  He had not been deceived, and he could re-enter the country for whose greatness and welfare alone he lived, as a father, loving and beloved, and not as a master to judge and punish.  He was deeply moved as he accepted the greetings of the priests, and with them offered up a public prayer. Then he was conducted to the splendid structure which had been prepared for him gaily mounted the outside steps, and from the top-most stair bowed to his innumerable crowd of subjects; and while he awaited the procession from the harbor which escorted Bent-Anat in her litter, he inspected the thousand decorated bulls and antelopes which were to be slaughtered as a thank-offering to the Gods, the tame lions and leopards, the rare trees in whose branches perched gaily-colored birds, the giraffes, and chariots to which ostriches were harnessed, which all marched past him in a long array.       [The splendor of the festivities I make Ani prepare seems pitiful      compared with those Ptolemy Philadelphus, according to the report of      an eye witness, Callexenus, displayed to the Alexandrians on a      festal occasion.]  Rameses embraced his daughter before all the people; he felt as if he must admit his subjects to the fullest sympathy in the happiness and deep thankfulness which filled his soul.  His favorite child had never seemed to him so beautiful as this day, and he realized with deep emotion her strong resemblance to his lost wife.--[Her name was Isis Nefert.]  Nefert had accompanied her royal friend as fanbearer, and she knelt before the king while he gave himself up to the delight of meeting his daughter.  Then he observed her, and kindly desired her to rise.  \"How much,\" he said, \"I am feeling to-day for the first time!  I have already learned that what I formerly thought of as the highest happiness is capable of a yet higher pitch, and I now perceive that the most beautiful is capable of growing to greater beauty!  A sun has grown from Mena's star.\"  Rameses, as he spoke, remembered his charioteer; for a moment his brow was clouded, and he cast down his eyes, and bent his head in thought.  Bent-Anat well knew this gesture of her father's; it was the omen of some kindly, often sportive suggestion, such as he loved to surprise his friends with.  He reflected longer than usual; at last he looked up, and his full eyes rested lovingly on his daughter as he asked her:  \"What did your friend say when she heard that her husband had taken a pretty stranger into his tent, and harbored her there for months?  Tell me the whole truth of it, Bent-Anat.\"  \"I am indebted to this deed of Mena's, which must certainly be quite excusable if you can smile when you speak of it,\" said the princess, \"for it was the cause of his wife's coming to me.  Her mother blamed her husband with bitter severity, but she would not cease to believe in him, and left her house because it was impossible for her to endure to hear him blamed.\"  \"Is this the fact?\"  asked Rameses.  Nefert bowed her pretty head, and two tears ran down her blushing cheeks.  \"How good a man must be,\" cried the king, \"on whom the Gods bestow such happiness!  My lord Chamberlain, inform Mena that I require his services at dinner to-day--as before the battle at Kadesh.  He flung away the reins in the fight when he saw his enemy, and we shall see if he can keep from flinging down the beaker when, with his own eyes, he sees his beloved wife sitting at the table.--You ladies will join me at the banquet.\"  Nefert sank on her knees before the king; but he turned from her to speak to the nobles and officers who had come to meet him, and then proceeded to the temple to assist at the slaughter of the victims, and to solemnly renew his vow in the presence of the priests and the people, to erect a magnificent temple in Thebes as a thank-offering for his preservation from death.  He was received with rapturous enthusiasm; his road led to the harbor, past the tents in which lay the wounded, who had been brought home to Egypt by ship, and he greeted"]]]
