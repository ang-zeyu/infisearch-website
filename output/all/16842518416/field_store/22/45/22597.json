He commenced, and again related the very same things which he had     done at his first visit, without the least variation, which having     done, he informed me of great judgments which were coming upon the     earth, with great desolations by famine, sword, and pestilence;     and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this     generation. Having related these things, he again ascended as he     had done before.\"  \"When the angel ascended the second time he left Joseph overwhelmed with astonishment, yet gave him but a short time to contemplate the things which he had told him before he made his reappearance and rehearsed the same things over, adding a few words of caution and instruction, thus: That he must beware of covetousness, and he must not suppose the record was to be brought forth with the view of getting gain, for this was not the case, but that it was to bring forth light and intelligence, which had for a long time been lost to the world; and that when he went to get the plates, he must be on his guard, or his mind would be filled with darkness. The angel then told him to tell his father all which he had both seen and heard.  \"* * * * From this time forth, Joseph continued to receive instructions from the Lord, and we continued to get the children together every evening, for the purpose of listening while he gave us a relation of the same. I presume our family presented an aspect as singular as any that ever lived upon the face of the earth--all seated in a circle, father, mother, sons, and daughters, and giving the most profound attention to a boy, eighteen years of age, who had never read the Bible through in his life. He seemed much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of our children, but far more given to meditation and deep study.  \"We were now confirmed in the opinion that God was about to bring to light something upon which we could stay our minds, or that would give us a more perfect knowledge of the plan of salvation and the redemption of the human family. This caused us greatly to rejoice; the sweetest union and happiness pervaded our house, and tranquillity reigned in our midst.  \"During our evening conversations, Joseph would occasionally give us some of the most amusing recitals that could be imagined. He would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent, their dress, mode of traveling, and the animals upon which they rode; their cities, their buildings, with every particular; their mode of warfare; and also their religious worship. This he would do with as much ease, seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life with them.\"  Thus continued the divine and miraculous experience of the prophetic family until the golden plates were obtained, the book of Mormon published, and the \"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\" was established on the 6th of April, 1830.  But all this shall be written in the book of the prophet!    CHAPTER III.  THE OPENING OF A SPIRITUAL DISPENSATION TO AMERICA--WOMAN'S EXALTATION--THE LIGHT OF THE LATTER DAYS.  Joseph Smith opened to America a great spiritual dispensation. It was such the Mormon sisterhood received.  A latter-day prophet! A gospel of miracles! Angels visiting the earth again! Pentecosts in the nineteenth century! This was Mormonism.  These themes were peculiarly fascinating to those earnest apostolic women whom we shall introduce to the reader.  Ever must such themes be potent with woman. She has a divine mission always, both to manifest spiritual gifts and to perpetuate spiritual dispensations.  Woman is child of faith. Indeed she is faith. Man is reason. His mood is skepticism. Left alone to _his_ apostleship, spiritual missions die, though revealed by a cohort of archangels. Men are too apt to lock again the heavens which the angels have opened, and convert priesthood into priestcraft. It is woman who is the chief architect of a spiritual church.  Joseph Smith was a prophet and seer because his mother was a prophetess and seeress. Lucy Smith gave birth to the prophetic genius which has wrought out its manifestations so marvelously in the age. Brigham Young, who is a society-builder, also received his rare endowments from his mother. Though differing from Joseph, Brigham has a potent inspiration.  Thus we trace the Mormon genius to these mothers. They gave birth to the great spiritual dispensation which is destined to incarnate a new and universal Christian church.  Until the faith of Latter-day Saints invoked one, there was no Holy Ghost in the world such as the saints of former days would have recognized. Respectable divines, indeed, had long given out that revelation was done away, because no longer needed. The canon of scripture was said to be full. The voice of prophesy was no more to be heard to the end of time.  But the Mormon prophet invoked the Holy Ghost of the ancient Hebrews, and burst the sealed heavens. The Holy Ghost came, and His apostles published the news abroad.  The initial text of Mormonism was precisely that which formed the basis of Peter's colossal sermon on the day of Pentecost:  \"And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams;  \"And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit; and they shall prophesy.\"  Here was a magic gospel for the age! And how greatly was woman in its divine programme!  No sooner was the application made than the prophesy was discovered to be pregnant with its own fulfillment. The experience of the former-day saints became the experience of the \"latter-day saints.\" It was claimed, too, that the supreme fulfillment was reserved for this crowning dispensation. These were emphatically the \"last days.\" It was in the \"last days\" that God would pour out His spirit upon \"_all_ flesh.\" The manifestation of Pentecost was but the foreshadowing of the power of God, to be universally displayed to his glory, and the regeneration of the nations in the \"dispensation of the fullness of times.\"  This gospel of a new dispensation came to America by the administration of angels. But let it not be thought that Joseph Smith alone saw angels. Multitudes received angelic administrations in the early days of the Church; thousands spoke in tongues and prophesied; and visions, dreams and miracles were daily manifestations among the disciples.  The sisters were quite as familiar with angelic visitors as the apostles. They were in fact the best \"mediums\" of this spiritual work. They were the \"cloud of witnesses.\" Their Pentecosts of spiritual gifts were of frequent occurrence.  The sisters were also apostolic in a priestly sense. They partook of the priesthood equally with the men. They too \"held the keys of the administration of angels.\" Who can doubt it, when faith is the greatest of all keys to unlock the gates of heaven? But \"the Church\" herself acknowledged woman's key. There was no Mormon St. Peter in this new dispensation to arrogate supremacy over woman, on his solitary pontifical throne. The \"Order of Celestial Marriage,\" not of celestial celibacy, was about to be revealed to the Church.  Woman also soon became high priestess and prophetess. She was this _officially_. The constitution of the Church acknowledged her divine mission to administer for the regeneration of the race. The genius of a patriarchal priesthood naturally made her the apostolic help-meet for man. If you saw her not in the pulpit _teaching_ the congregation, yet was she to be found in the temple, _administering_ for the living and the dead! Even in the holy of holies she was met. As a high priestess she blessed with the laying on of hands! As a prophetess she oracled in holy places! As an endowment giver she was a Mason, of the Hebraic order, whose Grand Master is the God of Israel and whose anointer is the Holy Ghost.  She held the keys of the administration of angels and of the working of miracles and of the \"sealings\" pertaining to \"the heavens and the earth.\" Never before was woman so much as she is in this Mormon dispensation!  The supreme spiritual character of the \"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\" (its proper name), is well typed in the hymn so often sung by the saints at their \"testimony meetings,\" and sometimes in their temples. Here is its theme:    \"The spirit of God like a fire is burning,        The latter-day glory begins to come forth,   The visions and blessings of old are returning,        The angels are coming to visit the earth.    _Chorus_--We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies of heaven--        Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb!   Let glory to them in the highest be given,        Henceforth and forever--amen and amen.    The Lord is extending the saints' understanding,        Restoring their judges and all as at first;   The knowledge and power of God are expanding;        The vail o'er the earth is beginning to burst.    _Chorus_--We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies of heaven!\" etc.  What a strange theme this, forty-seven years ago, before the age of our modern spiritual mediums, when the angels visited only the Latter-day Saints! In that day it would seem the angels only dared to come by stealth, so unpopular was their coming. But the _way_ was opened for the angels. What wonder that they have since come in hosts good and bad, and made their advent popular? Millions testify to their advent now; and \"modern spiritualism,\" though of \"another source,\" is a proof of Mormonism more astonishing than prophecy herself.  Yet is all this not more remarkable than the promise which Joseph Smith made to the world in proclaiming his mission. It was the identical promise of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54335"],["title","The Women of Mormondom (#5)"],["body","ist: \"These signs shall follow them that believe!\" These signs meant nothing short of all that extraordinary experience familiar to the Hebrew people and the early-day saints. We have no record that ever this sweeping promise was made before by any one but Jesus Christ. Yet Joseph Smith, filled with a divine assurance, dared to re-affirm it and apply the promise to all nations wherever the gospel of his mission should be preached. The most wonderful of tests is this. But the test was fulfilled. The signs followed all, and everywhere. Even apostates witness to this much.  There is nothing in modern spiritualism nearly so marvelous as was Mormonism in its rise and progress in America and Great Britain. It has indeed made stir enough in the world. But it had to break the way for coming ages. Revelation was at first a very new and strange theme after the more than Egyptian darkness in which the Christian nations had been for fifty generations. It was the light set upon the hill now; but the darkness comprehended it not. Yet was a spiritual dispensation opened again to the world. Once more was the lost key found. Mormonism was the key; and it was Joseph and his God-fearing disciples who unlocked the heavens. That fact the world will acknowledge in the coming times.    CHAPTER IV.  BIRTH OF THE CHURCH--KIRTLAND AS THE BRIDE, IN THE CHAMBERS OF THE WILDERNESS--THE EARLY GATHERING--\"MOTHER WHITNEY,\" AND ELIZA R. SNOW.  The birth-place of Mormonism was in the State of New York. There the angels first administered to the youthful prophet; there in the \"Hill Cumorah,\" near the village of Palmyra, the plates of the book of Mormon were revealed by Moroni; there, at Manchester, on the 6th of April, 1830, the \"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\" was organized, with six members.  But the divine romance of the sisterhood best opens at Kirtland. It is the place where this Israelitish drama of our times commenced its first distinguishing scenes,--the place where the first Mormon temple was built.  Ohio was the \"Great West.\" Kirtland, the city of the saints, with its temple, dedicated to the God of Israel, rose in Ohio.  Not, however, as the New Jerusalem of America, was Kirtland founded; but pioneer families, from New England, had settled in Ohio, who early received the gospel of the Latter-day Church.  Thus Kirtland became an adopted Zion, selected by revelation as a gathering place for the saints; and a little village grew into a city, with a temple.  Among these pioneers were the families of \"Mother Whitney,\" and Eliza R. Snow, and the families of \"Father Morley,\" and Edward Partridge, who became the \"first Bishop\" of Zion.  Besides these, there were a host of men and women soon numbered among the founders of Mormondom, who were also pioneers in Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois.  There is no feature of the Mormons more interesting than their distinguishing mark as pioneers. In this both their Church and family history have a national significance.  Trace their family migrations from old England to New England in the seventeenth century; from Europe to America in the nineteenth; then follow them as a people in their empire-track from the State of New York, where their Church was born, to Utah and California! It will thus be remarkably illustrated that they and their parents have been pioneering not only America but the world itself to the \"Great West\" for the last two hundred and fifty years!  As a community the Mormons have been emphatically the Church of pioneers. The sisters have been this equally with the brethren. Their very religion is endowed with the genius of migrating peoples.  So in 1830-31, almost as soon as the Church was organized, the prophet and the priesthood followed the disciples to the West, where the star of Messiah was rising.  As though the bride had been preparing for the coming! As though, womanlike, intuitively, she had gone into the wilderness--the chambers of a new civilization--to await the bridegroom.  For the time being Kirtland became the Zion of the West; for the time being Kirtland among cities was the bride.  But the illustration is also personal. Woman herself had gone to the West where the star of Messiah was looming. Daughters of the New Jerusalem were already in the chamber awaiting the bridegroom.  Early in the century, two had pioneered into the State of Ohio, who have since been, for a good lifetime, high priestesses of the Mormon temples. And the voice of prophesy has declared that these have the sacred blood of Israel in their veins. In the divine mysticism of their order they are at once of a kingly and priestly line.  There is a rare consistency in the mysticism of the Mormon Church. The daughters of the temple are so by right of blood and inheritance. They are discovered by gift of revelation in Him who is the voice of the Church; but they inherit from the fathers and mothers of the temple of the Old Jerusalem.  And so these two of the principal heroines of Mormondom--\"Mother Whitney\" and \"Sister Eliza R. Snow\"--introduced first as the two earliest of the Church who pioneered to the \"Great West,\" before the advent of their prophet, as well as introduced for the divine part which they have played in the marvelous history of their people.  These are high priestesses! These are two rare prophetesses! These have the gifts of revelation and \"tongues!\" These administer in \"holy places\" for the living and the dead.  It was about the year of our Lord 1806 that Oliver Snow, a native of Massachusetts, and his wife, R. L. Pettibone Snow, of Connecticut, moved with their children to that section of the State of Ohio bordering on Lake Erie on the north and the State of Pennsylvania on the east, known then as the \"Connecticut Western Reserve.\" They purchased land and settled in Mantua, Portage county.  Eliza R. Snow, who was the second of seven children, four daughters and three sons, one of whom is the accomplished apostle Lorenzo Snow, was born in Becket, Berkshire county, Mass., January 21st, 1804. Her parents were of English descent; their ancestors were among the earliest settlers of New England.  Although a farmer by occupation, Oliver Snow performed much public business, officiating in several responsible positions. His daughter Eliza, being ten years the senior of her eldest brother, so soon as she was competent, was employed as secretary in her father's office.  She was skilled in various kinds of needlework and home manufactures. Two years in succession she drew the prize awarded by the committee on manufactures, at the county fair, for the best manufactured leghorn.  When quite young she commenced writing for publication in various journals, which she continued to do for several years, over assumed signatures,--wishing to be useful as a writer, and yet unknown except by intimate friends.  \"During the contest between Greece and Turkey,\" she says, \"I watched with deep interest the events of the war, and after the terrible destruction of Missolonghi, by the Turks, I wrote an article entitled 'The Fall of Missolonghi.' Soon after its publication, the deaths of Adams and Jefferson occurred on the same memorable fourth of July, and I was requested through the press, to write their requiem, to which I responded, and found myself ushered into conspicuity. Subsequently I was awarded eight volumes of 'Godey's Lady's Book,' for a first prize poem published in one of the journals.\"  The classical reader will remember how the struggle between Greece and Turkey stirred the soul of Byron. That immortal poet was not a saint but he was a great patriot and fled to the help of Greece.  Precisely the same chord that was struck in the chivalrous mind of Lord Byron was struck in the Hebraic soul of Eliza R. Snow. It was the chord of the heroic and the antique.  Our Hebraic heroine is even more sensitive to the heroic and patriotic than to the poetic,--at least she has most self-gratification in lofty and patriotic themes.  \"That men are born poets,\" she continues, \"is a common adage. _I was born a patriot,_--at least a warm feeling of patriotism inspired my childish heart, and mingled in my earliest thoughts, as evinced in many of the earliest productions of my pen. I can even now recollect how, with beating pulse and strong emotion I listened, when but a small child, to the tales of the revolution.  \"My grandfather on my mother's side, when fighting for the freedom of our country, was taken prisoner by British troops, and confined in a dreary cell, and so scantily fed that when his fellow-prisoner by his side died from exhaustion, he reported him to the jailor as sick in bed, in order to obtain the amount of food for both,--keeping him covered in their blankets as long as he dared to remain with a decaying body.  \"This, with many similar narratives of revolutionary sufferings recounted by my grand-parents, so deeply impressed my mind, that as I grew up to womanhood I fondly cherished a pride for the flag which so proudly waved over the graves of my brave and valiant ancestors.\"  It was the poet's soul of this illustrious Mormon woman that first enchanted the Church with inspired song, and her Hebraic faith and life have given something of their peculiar tone to the entire Mormon people, and especially the sisterhood; just as Joseph Smith and Brigham Young gave the types and institutions to our modern Israel.  Sister Eliza R. Snow was born with more than the poet's soul. She was a prophetess in her very nature,--endowed thus by her Creator, before her birth. Her gifts are of race quality rather than of mere religious training or growth. They have come down to her from the ages. From her personal race indications, as well as from the whole tenor and mission of her life, she would readily be pronounced to be of Hebrew origin. One might very well fancy her to be a descendant of David himself; indeed the Prophet Joseph, in blessing her, pronounced her to be a daughter of Judah's royal house. She"]]]
