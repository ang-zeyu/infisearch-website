Cleopatra, on the contrary, shrank from meeting the man who had brought so much misfortune upon Mark Antony and herself, and inflicted upon her insults which were only too well calculated to make her doubt his clemency and truth.  On the other hand, she could not deny Dolabella's assertion that it would be far less easy for Octavianus to refuse her in person the wishes she cherished for her children's future than through mediators.  Proculejus had learned that Antony had named him to the Queen as the person most worthy of her confidence, and more keenly felt the wrong which, as the tool and obedient friend of Octavianus, he had inflicted upon the hapless woman.  The memory of his unworthy deed, which history would chronicle, had robbed the sensitive man, the author and patron of budding Roman poetry, of many an hour's sleep, and therefore he also now laboured zealously to oblige the Queen and mitigate her hard fate.  He, like the freedman Epaphroditus, who by Caesar's orders watched carefully to prevent any attempt upon her life, seemed to base great hopes on such an interview, and endeavoured to persuade her to request an audience from the Caesar.  Archibius said that, even in the worst case, it could not render the present state of affairs darker.  Experience, he said to Charmian, proved that no man of any feeling could wholly resist the charm of her nature, and to him at least she had never seemed more winning than now.  Who could have gazed unmoved into the beautiful face, so eloquent in its silent suffering, whose soul would not have been deeply touched by the sorrowful tones of her sweet voice?  Besides, her sable mourning robes were so well suited to the slight tinge of melancholy which pervaded her whole aspect.  When the fever flushed her cheeks, Archibius, spite of the ravages which grief, anxiety, and fear had made upon her charms, thought that he had never seen her look more beautiful.  He knew her thoroughly, and was aware that her desire to follow the man she loved into the realm of death was sincere; nay, that it dominated her whole being.  She clung to life only to die as soon as possible.  The decision which, after her resolve to build the monument, she had recognized in the temple of Berenike as the right one, had become the rule of conduct of her life. Every thought, every conversation, led her back to the past.  The future seemed to exist no longer.  If Archibius succeeded in directing her thoughts to approaching days she occupied herself wholly with her children's fate.  For herself she expected nothing, felt absolved from every duty except the one of protecting herself and her name from dishonour and humiliation.  The fact that Octavianus, when he doomed Caesarion to death, permitted the other children to return to her with the assurance that no harm should befall them, proved that he made a distinction between them and his uncle's son, and had no fears that they threatened his own safety. She might expect important results in their favour from an interview with Octavianus, so she at last authorized Proculejus to request an audience.  The Imperator's answer came the very same day.  It was his place to seek her--so ran the Caesar's message.  This meeting must decide her fate. Cleopatra was aware of this, and begged Charmian to remember the asp.  Her attendants had been forbidden to leave Lochias, but Epaphroditus permitted them to receive visitors.  The Nubian's merry, amusing talk had made friends for her among the Roman guards, who allowed her to pass in and out unmolested.  On her return, of course, she was searched with the utmost care, like every one who entered Lochias.  The decisive hour was close at hand.  Charmian knew what she must do in any event, but there was still one desire for whose fulfilment she longed.  She wished to greet Barine and see her boy.  To spare Iras, she had hitherto refrained from sending for Dion's wife. The sight of the mother and child might have reopened wounds still unhealed, and she would not inflict this sorrow upon her niece, who for a long time had once more been loyally devoted to her.  Octavianus did not hasten to fulfil his assurance.  But, at the end of a week, Proculejus brought the news that he could promise a visit from the Caesar that afternoon.  The Queen was deeply agitated, and desired before the interview to pay a visit to her tomb.  Iras offered to accompany her, and as Cleopatra intended to remain an hour or longer, Charmian thought it a favourable opportunity to see Barine and her boy.  Dion's wife had been informed of her friend's wish, and Anukis, who was to take her to Lochias, did not wait long for the mother and child.  Didymus's garden--now the property of the royal children--was the scene of the meeting.  In the shade of the familiar trees the young mother sank upon the breast of her faithful friend, and Charmian could not gaze her fill at the boy, or weary of tracing in his features a resemblance to his grandfather Leonax.  How much these two women, to whom Fate had allotted lives so widely different, found to tell each other!  The older felt transported to the past, the younger seemed to have naught save a present rich in blessing and a future green with hope.  She had good news to tell of her sister also.  Helena had long been the happy wife of Gorgias who, however, spite of the love with which he surrounded the young mistress of his house, numbered among his most blissful hours those which were devoted to overseeing the progress of the work on the mausoleum, where he met Cleopatra.  Time flew swiftly to the two women, and it was a painful surprise when one of the eunuchs on guard announced that the Queen had returned.  Again Charmian embraced her lover's grandson, blessed him and the young mother, sent messages of remembrance to Dion, begged Barine to think of her affectionately when she had passed from earth and, if her heart prompted her to the act, to anoint or adorn with a ribbon or flower the tombstone of the woman who had no friend to render her such a service.  Deeply moved by the firmness with which Charmian witnessed the approach of death, Barine listened in silence, but suddenly started as the sharp tones of a well-known voice called her friend's name and, as she turned, Iras stood before her.  Pallid and emaciated, she looked in her long, floating black robes the very incarnation of misery.  The sight pierced the heart of the happy wife and mother.  She felt as if much of the joy which Iras lacked had fallen to her own lot, and all the grief and woe she had ever endured had been transferred to her foe.  She would fain have approached humbly and said something very kind and friendly; but when she saw the tall, haggard woman gazing at her child, and noticed the disagreeable expression which had formerly induced her to compare her to a sharp thorn, a terrible dread of this woman's evil eye which might harm her boy seized the mother's heart and, overwhelmed by an impulse beyond control, she covered his face with her own veil.  Iras saw it, and after Barine had answered her question, \"Dion's child?\" in the affirmative, with a glance beseeching forbearance, the girl drew up her slender figure, saying with arrogant coldness \"What do I care for the child?  We have more important matters on our hearts.\"  Then she turned to Charmian to inform her, in the tone of an official announcement, that during the approaching interview the Queen desired her attendance also.  Octavianus had appointed sunset for the interview, and it still lacked several hours of the time.  The suffering Queen felt wearied by her visit to the mausoleum, where she had implored the spirit of Antony, if he had any power over the conqueror's heart, to induce him to release her from this torturing uncertainty and promise the children a happy fate.  To Dolabella, who had accompanied her from the tomb to the palace, she said that she expected only one thing from this meeting, and then won from him a promise which strengthened her courage and seemed the most precious boon which could be granted at this time.  She had expressed the fear that Octavianus would still leave her in doubt.  The youth spoke vehemently in Caesar's defence, and closed with the exclamation, \"If he should still keep you in suspense, he would be not only cool and circumspect--\"  \"Then,\" Cleopatra interrupted, \"be nobler, be less cruel, and release your father's friend from these tortures.  If he does not reveal to me what awaits me and you learn it, then--you will not say no, you cannot refuse me--then you, yes, you will inform me?\"  Promptly and firmly came the reply: \"What have I been able to do for you until now?  But I will release you from this torture, if possible.\"  Then he hastily turned his back, that he might not be compelled to see the eunuchs stationed at the palace gate search the garments of the royal captive.  His promise sustained the failing courage of the wearied, anxious Queen, and she reclined upon the cushions of a lounge to recover from the exhausting expedition; but she had scarcely closed her eyes when the pavement of the court-yard rang under the hoofs of the four horses which bore the Caesar to Lochias.  Cleopatra had not expected the visit so early.  She had just been consulting with her attendants about the best mode of receiving him.  At first she had been disposed to do so on the throne, clad in her royal attire, but she afterwards thought that she was too ill and weak to bear the heavy ornaments.  Besides, the man and successful conqueror would show himself more indulgent "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5481"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 09 (#5)"],["body","gracious to the suffering woman than to the princess.  There was much to palliate the course which she had pursued in former days, and she had carefully planned the defence by which she hoped to influence his calm but not unjust nature.  Many things in her favour were contained in the letters from Caesar and Antony which, after her husband's death, she had read again and again during so many wakeful nights, and they had just been brought to her.  Both Archibius and the Roman Proculejus had counselled her not to receive him entirely alone.  The latter did not express his opinion in words, but he knew that Octavianus was more readily induced to noble and lenient deeds when there was no lack of witnesses to report them to the world. It was advisable to provide spectators for the most consummate actor of his day.  Therefore the Queen had retained Iras, Charmian, and some of the officials nearest to her person, among them the steward Seleukus, who could give information if any question arose concerning the delivery of the treasure.  She had also intended, after she had somewhat recovered from the visit to the tomb, to be robed in fresh garments.  This was prevented by the Caesar's unexpected arrival.  Now, even had time permitted, she would have been unable to have her hair arranged, she felt so weak and yet so feverishly excited.  The blood coursed hotly through her veins and flushed her cheeks.  When told that the Caesar was close at hand, she had only time to raise herself a little higher on her cushions, push back her hair, and let Iras, with a few hasty touches, adjust the folds of her mourning robes. Had she attempted to advance to meet him, her limbs would have failed to support her.  When the Caesar at last entered, she could greet him only by a wave of her hand; but Octavianus, who had uttered the usual salutations from the threshold, quickly broke the painful silence, saying with a courteous bow:  \"You summoned me--I came.  Every one is subject to beauty--even the victor.\"  Cleopatra's head drooped in shame as she answered distinctly, yet in a tone of modest denial: \"I only asked the favour of an audience.  I did not summon.  I thank you for granting the request.  If it is dangerous for man to bow to woman's charms, no peril threatens you here.  Beauty cannot withstand tortures such as those which have been imposed on me-- barely can life remain.  But you prevented my casting it from me.  If you are just, you will grant to the woman whom you would not permit to die an existence whose burden will not exceed her power to endure.\"  The Caesar again bowed silently and answered courteously:  \"I intend to make it worthy of you.\"  \"Then,\" cried Cleopatra impetuously, \"release me from this torturing uncertainty.  You are not one of the men who never look beyond to-day and to-morrow.\"  \"You are thinking,\" said Octavianus harshly, \"of one who perhaps would still be among us, if with wiser caution--\"  Cleopatra's eyes, which hitherto had met the victor's cold gaze with modest entreaty, flashed angrily, and a majestic: \"Let the past rest!\" interrupted him.  But she soon mastered the indignation which had stirred her passionate blood, and in a totally different tone, not wholly free from gentle persuasion, she continued:  \"The provident intellect of the man whose nod the universe obeys grasps the future as well as the present.  Must not he, therefore, have decided the children's fate ere he consented to see their mother?  The only obstacle in your path, the son of your great uncle--\"  \"His doom was a necessity,\" interrupted the conqueror in a tone of sincere regret.  \"As I mourned Antony, I grieve for the unfortunate boy.\"  \"If that is true,\" replied Cleopatra eagerly, \"it does honour to the kindness of your heart.  When Proculejus wrested the dagger from my grasp he blamed me because I attributed to the most clement of conquerors harshness and implacability.\"  \"Two qualities,\" the Caesar protested, \"which are wholly alien to my nature.\"  \"And which--even if you possessed them--you neither could nor ought to use,\" cried Cleopatra, \"if you really mean the beautiful words you so often utter that, as the nephew and heir of the great Julius Caesar, you intend to walk in his footsteps.  Caesarion--there is his bust--was the image in every feature of his father, your illustrious model.  To me, the hapless woman now awaiting my sentence from his nephew's lips, the gods granted, as the most precious of all gifts, the love of your divine uncle.  And what love!  The world knew not what I was to his great heart, but my wish to defend myself from misconception bids me show it to you, his heir.  From you I expect my sentence.  You are the judge.  These letters are my strongest defence.  I rely upon them to show myself to you as I was and am, not as envy and slander describe me.--The little ivory casket, Iras!  It contains the precious proofs of Caesar's love, his letters to me.\"  She raised the lid with trembling hands and, as these mementoes carried her back to the past, she continued in lower tones:  \"Among all my  treasures  this  simple little coffer has been for half a lifetime my most valued jewel.  He gave it to me.  It was in the midst of the fierce contest here at the Bruchium.\"  Then, while unfolding the first roll, she directed Octavianus's attention to it and the remainder of the contents of the little casket, exclaiming:  \"Silent pages, yet how eloquent!  Each one a peerless picture, the powerful thinker, the man of action, who permits his restless intellect to repose, and suffers his heart to overflow with the love of youth! Were I vain, Octavianus, I might call each one of these letters a trophy of victory, an Olympic garland.  The woman to whom Julius Caesar owned his subjugation might well hold her head higher than the unhappy, vanquished Queen who, save the permission to die--\"  \"Do not part with the letters,\" said Octavianus kindly.  \"Who can doubt that they are a precious treasure--\"  \"The most precious and at the same time the advocate of the accused,\" replied Cleopatra eagerly; \"on them--as you have already heard--rests my vindication.  I will commence with their contents.  How terrible it is to make what is sacred to us and intended only to elevate our own hearts serve a purpose, to do what has always been repugnant to us!  But I need an advocate and, Octavianus, these letters will restore to the wretched, suffering beggar the dignity and majesty of the Queen.  The world knows but two powers to which Julius Caesar bowed--the thrall of the pitiable woman on this couch, and of all-conquering death.  An unpleasant fellowship--but I do not shrink from it; for death robbed him of life, and from my hand--I ask only a brief moment.  How gladly I would spare myself my own praises, and you the necessity of listening to them!  Yes, here it is: 'Through you, you irresistible woman,' he writes, 'I learned for the first time, after youth was over, how beautiful life can be.'\"  Cleopatra, as she spoke, handed Caesar the letter.  But while she was still searching hastily for another he returned the first, saying:  \"I understand only too well your reluctance to allow such confidential effusions to play the part of defender.  I can imagine their purport, and they shall influence me as if I had read them all.  However eloquent they may be, they are needless witnesses.  Is any written testimony required in behalf of charms whose magic is still potent?\"  A bewitching smile, which seemed like a confirmation of the haughty young conqueror's flattering words, flitted over Cleopatra's face.  Octavianus noticed it.  This woman indeed possessed enthralling charms, and he felt the slight flush that suffused his cheeks.  This unhappy captive, this suffering supplicant, could still draw into her net any man who did not possess the cool watchfulness which panoplied his soul.  Was it the marvellous melody of her voice, the changeful lustre of her tearful eyes, the aristocratic grace of the noble figure, the exquisite symmetry of the hands and feet, the weakness of the prostrate sufferer, strangely blended with truly royal majesty, or the thought that love for her had found earth's greatest and loftiest men with indissoluble fetters, which lent this fragile woman, who had long since passed the boundaries of youth, so powerful a spell of attraction?  At any rate, however certain of himself he might be, he must guard his feelings.  He understood how to bridle passion far better than the uncle who was so greatly his superior.  Yet it was of the utmost importance to keep her alive, and therefore to maintain her belief in his admiration.  He wished to show the world and the Great Queen of the East, who had just boasted of conquering, like death, even the most mighty, its own supremacy as man and victor.  But he must also be gentle, in order not to endanger the object for which he wanted her.  She must accompany him to Rome.  She and her children promised to render his triumph the most brilliant and memorable one which any conqueror had ever displayed to the senate and the people.  In a light tone which, however, revealed the emotion of his soul, he answered: \"My illustrious uncle was known as a friend of fair women.  His stern life was crowned with flowers by many hands, and he acknowledged these favours verbally and perhaps--as he did to you in all these letters--with the reed.  His genius was greater, at any rate more many-sided and mobile, than mine.  He succeeded, too, in pursuing different objects at the same time with equal devotion.  I am wholly absorbed in the cares of state, of government, and war.  I feel grateful when I can permit our poets to adorn my leisure for a brief space.  Overburdened with toil, I have no time to yield myself captive, as my uncle did in these very rooms, to the most charming of women.  If I could follow my own will, you would be the first from whom I would seek the gifts of Eros.  But it may not be!  We "]]]
