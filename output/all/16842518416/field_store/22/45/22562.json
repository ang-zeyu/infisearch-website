In the cotton patch you could hear us kids saying such things as, \"I picked more cotton than you did.\"  Or if we were hoeing you might hear something like, \"Come on, Slow Poke.\"  The plan worked well.  No one wanted to be outdone by a brother, especially a little brother.  And if a little brother could outshine a big brother, even just once in awhile, that was a real feather in the little one's cap.  Oh, yes!  There was hurry and there was pressure.  But it didn't seem to get us down as it does some people today.  We had no psychologists in those days to tell us that pressures would warp a kid's brain.  We didn't know that competition and hurry would drive us crazy until these educated people told us about it.  So we lived hard, we worked hard, and we played hard.  Then we were able to go to bed and sleep hard.  Never in my life did I ever hear Mama or Papa say, \"I didn't sleep well last night, because I felt tense and worried.\"  There was really nothing to worry about like there is today. They didn't worry that we kids might go away from home and get into trouble.  We didn't have to leave home to get into trouble. We kids made our own trouble right at home.  We had a lot of fun doing a lot of different things.  Most of our troubles were brought on accidentally, we didn't deliberately plan them.  There was no worry about the family losing anything, we had nothing to lose.  No one would steal from us because no one wanted what we had.  So, whatever pressures we might encounter during the day were dispelled during a night of welcome rest.  In the cotton patch Mama and Papa encouraged us to see who could pick 100 bolls first.  The first one to pick his 100 bolls would call out, \"hundred.\"  Then each of the others would call out the number of bolls they had picked during the same time.  This competition got more bales of cotton to the gin in a shorter period of time.  But, as in all activities where kids are involved, we sometimes had little disagreements.  I had this thing of humming or singing a song while I picked cotton and counted my bolls.  I found that the mental work I was doing was relaxing and it allowed my hands to do their work faster.  And now, 65 years later, I learn that I was doing something a little bit kin to what they call Yoga.  At any rate, it really worked for me.  I could pick cotton faster than a brother or two who were older than I was.  Now, I didn't necessarily use my system in order to get more of the family cotton picked.  I used it mainly just to beat my older brothers picking cotton, and that not for very long at a time.  But my little scheme backfired on me.  One of those brothers couldn't stand to be outdone by a younger brother.  He told Mama and Papa that I was lying and cheating, because he knew I couldn't count bolls while I sang a song.  But he was wrong.  I could.  Anyway, nothing I could say would make him believe me.  I began to become an outcast among some of my brothers early in life.  I believe there were times when some of them would have been glad to \"sell me into slavery\" as Joseph's brothers did him.  But my parents didn't seem to doubt my word.  I really believe they understood that I could do a thing or two that some of the others could not do--and perhaps were not at all interested in doing.  I believe little things like that were the beginning of a wee bit of an unconscious rift between some of my brothers and me, and at the same time, the making of a stronger bond between my parents and me.  Looking back, I remember many times when Papa and I were doing things together and there was no one else around.  I really don't know why I was the only one there a lot of times.  Maybe I just wanted to be in good company.  I loved and admired Papa and I thought he was the best and nicest man in the world.  Or perhaps I was with Papa because of my inquisitive mind concerning mechanical things, like,  \"How do you shoe a horse?\"  \"How do you tighten a loose wagon tire?\"  \"How do you make a row-binder do what you want it to do when the manufacturer couldn't seem to do it?\"  I watched him do all these things and many more.  And many of the things he did fascinated me.  The situation was much the same between Mama and me.  \"How do you churn milk and make butter?\"  \"How do you 'take up' the butter after it is churned?\"  \"How do you make those beautiful decorations on it later?\"  \"How do you weave a carpet on Grandma's loom?\"  It seems I was always watching a lot of these goings-on while the other kids were somewhere else doing whatever they liked to do. And Mama and Papa were never too busy to answer my questions.  I realize now how much more I could have learned if I had only known how and when to ask more questions.  It seems that my parents favored and petted me at times.  I'm not sure they did.  If they did, perhaps it was because they felt sorry for their little ugly duckling.  And maybe I only imagined they were especially nice to me.  Maybe they were that nice to everyone.  Perhaps they were nice to me just to have me around handy when they needed me to help them just a little bit.  This latter seems to be the most reasonable argument, after considering some of my stupid exploits and my senseless reasoning throughout my life.  Yet, it just might be possible that they were partial to me on account of the wen, and later on, my paralysis--these factors coupled with the fact that within the last four years along about the time I was born, they had suffered the loss of a two-year-old son, a two-week-old daughter, Mama's favorite brother, Hugh, and Grandpa Johnson.  Who can measure the thoughts of loving parents as they view their newborn child for the first time, anxious to know whether he or she is beautiful and healthy and without blemish.  And who knows the anxiety of parents who, after seeing their child with blemish, must wonder how his condition will affect his relationship with others, how it will affect his outlook on life, and whether it might grow worse and shorten his days.     CHAPTER 4  SOCIAL LIVING; LOVING, LISTENING, LEARNING  There were so many little stories unfolding simultaneously that I am going to be unable to keep them all up to date as I go along. While I have been telling about some of our working habits and our little family customs, I find that the story of my love life has been neglected.  I must go back a way now and bring some of my social living up to date.  Oh, yes!  I had a sweetheart.  Her name was Gladys, and I must tell you about her.  You see, when we moved to the Exum farm, I was a little boy barely five years old.  But then, when we had lived there a year and a half, I was no longer just a little kid.  I was getting to be a big boy, six and a half and going on seven.  And my ears were getting bigger also.  I began to hear about sweethearts. Susie was thirteen and was just the very one to explain it to me.  She told me once, jokingly, \"A sweetheart is a chicken heart baked in molasses.\"  But seriously, what she explained about sweethearts amounted to something like this, \"Sweethearts are one boy and one girl about the same age who like each other and like to go together and like to do things together.  He is her sweetheart and she is his sweetheart.\"  Now the Flints, who had moved onto our old farm, had a bunch of boys and girls and we all played together.  The one I liked best was Gladys.  She was just my size, she was six years old, and she and I liked to go play together.  So, when I learned what sweethearts were, I knew for a fact that Gladys was my sweetheart because we liked each other and played together.  Of course, I didn't tell anyone, not even Gladys.  I didn't feel any differently toward her.  We just went right on playing together as we had been doing.  But I had this newly acquired knowledge that she was my sweetheart.  No more than I knew or could understand about it all, I wondered why boys and girls had sweethearts at all.  They were just like other boys and girls except they were your own age.  I never heard of any parents who objected to their older boys and girls having sweethearts and dating.  (In those days we called it \"going together.\") But in our immediate community, there were some pretty strict rules to govern their behavior.  The \"good\" people in our community didn't allow their boys and girls to dance.  So, there were no dances in our neighborhood because there were no families that wanted to be branded as being \"not so good.\"  Instead of dances we had parties.  Many a Friday night some good farm couple would give a party.  These parties were always family affairs.  The young people didn't go to the parties alone.  Their parents took them to the parties and then the grown-ups took part in many of the games.  I remember two of the games they played.  They were \"snap\" and \"cross questions and crooked answers.\"  There were many others but I can't recall them just now.  I was only eleven when we moved out of that community, and we never had such parties at any place we lived after that.  One night at one of the parties, Frank's girl \"snapped\" me.  (We didn't call them girl-friends as we do today, just \"Girls.\") But I was so timid I just backed away like the bashful country kid that I was.  She told them she got \"stood-up\" and would have to pick someone else.  I wanted to play in the games, but I realized that I was much smaller than any of the others who took part in them, and I was afraid I might do something wrong and cause them to laugh at me.  Two of the party song-and-dance \"swings\" they did were \"Shoot the Buffalo\" and \"Farmer by the Mill.\"  These were the promenade type dances where they swung their partners kind of like in a square dance.  Mr. Flint was about the best man in the neighborhood at calling those dances.  Now I have gone and contradicted myself.  I first said we didn't have dances.  Now I'm telling you we danced.  But this was not the kind "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/542"],["title","The Life of Me: An Autobiography (#8)"],["body","dance where they waltzed around in each other's arms. They were party dances.  When the party activities got under way, the people were seated all around the room next to the walls.  Usually some were standing in the adjoining rooms also, looking through the doors, because the living room wasn't large enough to hold the crowd. When that many came to a party, it was considered a good party.  A large crowd was just what they wanted.  More people meant more games and more happy people playing games.  In general, when there was a large crowd, things moved along at a faster pace.  The game of \"snap\" was usually played by the young set--that is, the sweetheart set who enjoyed holding hands and chasing after each other.  The game was easy to get started.  All it took was a girl and a boy to stand in the middle of the room and hold hands, facing each other.  Then the girls would \"volunteer\" one of their crowd and push her forward to be \"it.\"  Then the \"it\" girl would circle the room looking for the boy she wanted for a partner.  When she found him, she would snap her fingers in front of his face, just as you would in school when you wanted to get the teacher's attention.  This snap told the boy that he was her chosen, at least for a few minutes.  As soon as she snapped her fingers, she would hurry to the couple in the middle of the room and the boy she \"snapped\" would chase after her.  His object was to touch the girl, and her object was to try to prevent his touching her.  She would try to prolong the chase by dodging and sometimes swinging around the couple in the center of the room.  And sometimes the couple would prolong the chase by favoring the girl.  They might raise their arms to let the girl go through between them and then lower their arms quickly to stop the boy. Or, if the boy was having a hard time catching her, they might let her start through between them and then lower their arms quickly and trap her in their arms.  As soon as the boy touched the girl, the chase was ended.  Then the couple who had held hands would leave and let the new couple hold hands in the center of the room while another chase took place.  This was not only a holding-hands game, at times it became a body- contact game.  And yet, not too much contact, because the grown- ups were watching.  Anyway, snap was a popular game at our parties.  Now, this Friday night the party might be at the Johnsons, but before the party was over, you could bet good money that the teen- agers would have talked another family into giving a party next Friday night.  These were strictly play parties.  There were no refreshments served, not a lot of cooking and fixing.  Just make sure the house is clean, the yard is clean, and there are plenty of places to park buggies, hacks, and wagons.  Then hope a big crowd begins gathering soon after sundown.  Parties were preferred over dances because it was considered immoral for a boy to put his arm around a girl before they were married.  Sweethearts could hold hands in the presence of adults, if it were in the process of playing a game.  But just to sit this one out and hold hands was unthinkable.  A \"good\" mother would never tell her daughter it was all right for her to hold hands in public, or to hug and kiss anywhere, on her way to church or anywhere else, either afoot or in a buggy-- not even at night.  Somehow, I just can't help but believe that parents knew these little things were going on between lovers, but they seemed to think that if they told their kids it was all right for them to do these things, it would be like saying \"sic 'em\" to a dog. Putting it another way, parents were saying, \"Don't ever let me catch you doing such things.\"  And the kids were not actually saying but were thinking, \"Okay, I'll try not to let you catch me when I do them.\"  Dances were looked down upon because they attracted boys who drank, and girls with loose morals.  There were some boys and girls who lived six or eight miles from us who were not wanted at some of the parties given in our neighborhood, and were not invited by some of our neighbors who were giving the parties.  But when my parents gave a party at our house, they invited everyone who would come.  They thought it unmannerly to invite certain ones and leave others out.  They seemed to figure that their integrity would demand respect from the worst of them--and it did.  There never was any trouble at our house--no drinking, no fighting, no \"cussing.\"  I remember one of those parties when some young people came in a buggy from quite a distance away.  I think I was about nine years old and, of course, I didn't know all about everything that went on around me but I knew enough to realize there were some bad feelings between their families and some of those in our immediate neighborhood.  The main reason seemed to be that those youngsters attended dances in other communities and some parents in our neighborhood sure didn't approve of that.  The incident I remember had to do with their buggy horse which got sick with a severe attack of colic while the party was going on.  Someone had wandered outside and had discovered the horse in great pain.  The boy who owned the animal had seen the disease before and knew how quickly it could kill a good horse.  So he offered to sell the animal to anyone for $10.  It would have been a bargain for Papa, because he knew exactly what to do to cure the horse.  And the horse was probably worth $50.  When Papa learned about the problem, he got a quart bottle, filled it about a quarter-full of soda and then added about a half-quart of kerosene.  Then he climbed up in a tree, pulled the horse's head high in the air with the bridle reins and poured the mixture down his throat.  Within ten minutes, the horse was without pain and resting comfortably, except for a mighty bad taste in his mouth.  I think the boy was truly grateful that Papa had not taken advantage of him by buying the horse.  Will Johnson knew that a good name was rather to be chosen than the value of a buggy horse.  Along with sweethearts, there were a few other things I didn't understand altogether.  One time during my younger days, I cut out a picture of a baby buggy from a Sears, Roebuck catalog.  I don't remember just how old I was at the time.  I was old enough to do a pretty good job of cutting out, but I didn't do so well with my reasoning.  I was disappointed to learn that the buggy wouldn't sit up and roll.  That was not altogether a case of stupidity but rather, a lack of research.  This was part of the research through which I learned about the third dimension.  It's hard to believe a kid that stupid could become so smart within the next few years and retain that smartness for the rest of his life.  We also learned--not through research, but from concerned parents, about the choice of words to use, the careful choice, I might add.  Some words were strictly forbidden.  The word \"bull\" was one of them.  We didn't dare use that word in the presence of Papa or Mama.  And if any of the other kids heard us use it, they would tattle on us.  So, we just didn't use it.  We were taught to use the word \"surley\" instead.  As late as 1940 I knew middle-aged men who would not use the word \"bull\" before a woman.  One old farmer said, \"I don't know what the world is coming to.  I believe the time will come when men and women will use the word 'bull' in mixed company and think nothing of it.\"  But that was in farming country.  In cattle country it was different.  I'll bet a ranch boy wouldn't have known what a surley was.  One of my rancher uncles was talking to a farmer who had some calves he wanted to sell to the rancher.  He told the rancher, \"Three of those calves are still nursing.\"  Well, my uncle and his daughter had to put forth an effort to hold back their laughter.  They were not used to nursing calves.  In cattle country calves don't nurse, they suck.  Continuing along that same line, up until I was a teenager, I never heard the words \"sex\" or \"male\" or \"female\" used except by some dirty-mouthed kid.  Even when I was in the seventh and eighth grades, when I had to fill out certain school papers and was told to put an M for male or an F for female, there was a wee bit of embarrassment or shyness associated with the use of gender words.  The use of the word \"sex\" was still guarded against, except in writing.  The word was never spoken in mixed company. The word \"gender\" was considered bad enough.  And speaking of dirty-mouthed kids--no one in our family ever used any kind of dirty words, at least not in my presence.  Some of the brothers I grew up with are in their seventies now and I can truthfully say, I can not recall ever having heard one of them \"cuss\" nor utter a dirty word.  We have all heard of that proverbial corner around which prosperity is lurking.  Well, at the Exum place we finally rounded that corner and bumped right into it.  We got a telephone.  I'm sure we didn't have a telephone at the Flint place.  But by about the time I started to school, almost everyone in our neighborhood had one.  There were maybe eight or ten parties on the same line.  We owned our own telephone, put up our own lines, and bought our own batteries.  Having so many on one line wasn't the best arrangement but it was better than no phone at all.  It was a big step forward at that time in the history of our community.  Every day at noon--straight up twelve o'clock--the operator would ring a long, long ring.  We could set our clocks by it and we could listen to the weather forecast immediately after the long ring.  I don't know where they got the weather information, probably from a record of what the weather did on that same day a year ago, or maybe from the almanac.  Anyway, wherever they got it, most of us listened to it and were stuck with it.  In the above paragraph I said the operator would ring.  That's not exactly right.  It's true, she was a woman operator.  And we kids"]]]
