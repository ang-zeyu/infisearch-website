He had fully expected to have the watch to carry home and display to his mother. As it was, he was in no hurry to go home, but remained for two hours skating with the other boys. He used his friend Linton's skates, Linton having an engagement which prevented his remaining.  It was five o'clock when Luke entered the little cottage which he called home. His mother, a pleasant woman of middle age, was spreading the cloth for supper. She looked up as he entered.  \"Well, Luke?\" she said inquiringly.  \"I haven't brought home the watch, mother,\" he said. \"Randolph Duncan won it by accident. I will tell you about it.\"  After he had done so, Mrs. Larkin asked thoughtfully. \"Isn't it a little singular that Tom should have got in your way?\"  \"Yes; I thought so at the time.\"  \"Do you think there was any arrangement between him and Randolph?\"  \"As you ask me, mother, I am obliged to say that I do.\"  \"It was a very mean trick!\" said Mrs. Larkin, resentfully.  \"Yes, it was; but poor Tom was well punished for it. Why, he's got a bunch on the back of his head almost as large as a hen's egg.\"  \"I don't pity him,\" said Mrs. Larkin.  \"I pity him, mother, for I don't believe Randolph will repay him for the service done him. If Randolph had met with the same accident I am not prepared to say that I should have pitied him much.\"  \"You might have been seriously injured yourself, Luke.\"  \"I might, but I wasn't, so I won't take that into consideration. However, mother, watch or no watch, I've got a good appetite. I shall be ready when supper is.\"  Luke sat down to the table ten minutes afterward and proved his words good, much to his mother's satisfaction.  While he is eating we will say a word about the cottage. It was small, containing only four rooms, furnished in the plainest fashion. The rooms, however, were exceedingly neat, and presented an appearance of comfort. Yet the united income of Mrs. Larkin and Luke was very small. Luke received a dollar a week for taking care of the schoolhouse, but this income only lasted forty weeks in the year. Then he did odd jobs for the neighbors, and picked up perhaps as much more. Mrs. Larkin had some skill as a dressmaker, but Groveton was a small village, and there was another in the same line, so that her income from this source probably did not average more than three dollars a week. This was absolutely all that they had to live on, though there was no rent to pay; and the reader will not be surprised to learn that Luke had no money to spend for watches.  \"Are you tired, Luke?\" asked his mother, after supper.  \"No, mother. Can I do anything for you?\"  \"I have finished a dress for Miss Almira Clark. I suppose she will want to wear it to church to-morrow. But she lives so far away, I don't like to ask you to carry it to her.\"  \"Oh, I don't mind. It won't do me any harm.\"  \"You will get tired.\"  \"If I do, I shall sleep the better for it.\"  \"You are a good son, Luke.\"  \"I ought to be. Haven't I got a good mother?\"  So it was arranged. About seven o'clock, after his chores were done--for there was some wood to saw and split--Luke set out, with the bundle under his arm, for the house of Miss Clark, a mile and a half away.  It was a commonplace errand, that on which Luke had started, but it was destined to be a very important day in his life. It was to be a turning-point, and to mark the beginning of a new chapter of experiences. Was it to be for good or ill? That we are not prepared to reveal. It will be necessary for the reader to follow his career, step by step, and decide for himself.  Of course, Luke had no thought of this when he set out. To him it had been a marked day on account of the skating match, but this had turned out a disappointment. He accomplished his errand, which occupied a considerable time, and then set out on his return. It was half-past eight, but the moon had risen and diffused a mild radiance over the landscape. Luke thought he would shorten his homeward way by taking a path through the woods. It was not over a quarter of a mile, but would shorten the distance by as much more. The trees were not close together, so that it was light enough to see. Luke had nearly reached the edge of the wood, when he overtook a tall man, a stranger in the neighborhood, who carried in his hand a tin box. Turning, he eyed Luke sharply.  \"Boy, what's your name?\" he asked.  \"Luke Larkin,\" our hero answered, in surprise.  \"Where do you live?\"  \"In the village yonder.\"  \"Will you do me a favor?\"  \"What is it, sir?\"  \"Take this tin box and carry it to your home. Keep it under lock and key till I call for it.\"  \"Yes, sir, I can do that. But how shall I know you again?\"  \"Take a good look at me, that you may remember me.\"  \"I think I shall know you again, but hadn't you better give me a name?\"  \"Well, perhaps so,\" answered the other, after a moment's thought. \"You may call me Roland Reed. Will you remember?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I am obliged to leave this neighborhood at once, and can't conveniently carry the box,\" explained the stranger. \"Here's something for your trouble.\"  Luke was about to say that he required no money, when it occurred to him that he had no right to refuse, since money was so scarce at home. He took the tin box and thrust the bank-bill into his vest pocket. He wondered how much it was, but it was too dark to distinguish.  \"Good night!\" said Luke, as the stranger turned away.  \"Good night!\" answered his new acquaintance, abruptly.  If Luke could have foreseen the immediate consequences of this apparently simple act, and the position in which it would soon place him, he would certainly have refused to take charge of the box. And yet in so doing it might have happened that he had made a mistake. The consequences of even our simple acts are oftentimes far-reaching and beyond the power of human wisdom to foreknow.  Luke thought little of this as, with the box under his arm, he trudged homeward.    CHAPTER V  LUKE RECEIVES AN INVITATION   \"What have you there, Luke?\" asked Mrs. Larkin, as Luke entered the little sitting-room with the tin box under his arm.  \"I met a man on my way home, who asked me to keep it for him.\"  \"Do you know the man?\" asked his mother, in surprise.  \"No,\" answered Luke.  \"It seems very singular. What did he say?\"  \"He said that he was obliged to leave the neighborhood at once, and could not conveniently carry the box.\"  \"Do you think it contains anything of value?\"  \"Yes, mother. It is like the boxes rich men have to hold their stocks and bonds. I was at the bank one day, and saw a gentleman bring in one to deposit in the safe.\"  \"I can't understand that at all, Luke. You say you did not know this man?\"  \"I never met him before.\"  \"And, of course, he does not know you?\"  \"No, for he asked my name.\"  \"Yet he put what may be valuable property in your possession.\"  \"I think,\" said Luke, shrewdly, \"he had no one else to trust it to. Besides, a country boy wouldn't be very likely to make use of stocks and bonds.\"  \"No, that is true. I suppose the tin box is locked?\"  \"Yes, mother. The owner--he says his name is Roland Reed--wishes it put under lock and key.\"  \"I can lock it up in my trunk, Luke.\"  \"I think that will be a good idea.\"  \"I hope he will pay you for your trouble when he takes away the tin box.\"  \"He has already. I forgot to mention it,\" and Luke drew from his vest pocket, the bank-note he had thrust in as soon as received. \"Why, it's a ten-dollar bill!\" he exclaimed. \"I wonder whether he knew he was giving me as much?\"  \"I presume so, Luke,\" said his mother, brightening up. \"You are in luck!\"  \"Take it, mother. You will find a use for it.\"  \"But, Luke, this money is yours.\"  \"No, it is yours, for you are going to take care of the box.\"  It was, indeed, quite a windfall, and both mother and son retired to rest in a cheerful frame of mind, in spite of Luke's failure in the race.  \"I have been thinking, Luke,\" said his mother, at the breakfast-table, \"that I should like to have you buy a Waterbury watch out of this money. It will only cost three dollars and a half, and that is only one-third.\"  \"Thank you, mother, but I can get along without the watch. I cared for it chiefly because it was to be a prize given to the best skater. All the boys know that I would have won but for the accident, and that satisfies me.\"  \"I should like you to have a watch, Luke.\"  \"There is another objection, mother. I don't want any one to know about the box or the money. If it were known that we had so much property in the house, some attempt might be made to rob us.\"  \"That is true, Luke. But I hope it won't be long before you have a watch of your own.\"  When Luke was walking, after breakfast, he met Randolph Duncan, with a chain attached to the prize watch ostentatiously displayed on the outside of his vest. He smiled complacently, and rather triumphantly, when he met Luke. But Luke looked neither depressed nor angry.  \"I hope your watch keeps good time, Randolph,\" he said.  \"Yes; it hasn't varied a minute so far. I think it will keep as good time as my silver watch.\"  \"You are fortunate to have two watches.\"  \"My father has promised me a gold watch when I am eighteen,\" said Randolph, pompously.  \"I don't know if I shall have any watch at all when I am eighteen.\"  \"Oh, well, you are a poor boy. It doesn't matter to you.\"  \"I don't know about that, Randolph. Time is likely to be of as much importance to a poor boy as to a rich boy.\"  \"Oh, ah! yes, of course, but a poor boy isn't expected to wear a watch.\"  Here the conversation ended. Luke walked on with an amused smile on his face.  \"I wonder how it would seem to be as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5417"],["title","Struggling Upward, or Luke Larkin's Luck (#3)"],["body","and self-satisfied as Randolph?\" he thought. \"On the whole, I would rather be as I am.\"  \"Good morning, Luke!\"  It was a girl's voice that addressed him. Looking up, he met the pleasant glance of Florence Grant, considered by many the prettiest girl in Groveton. Her mother was a widow in easy circumstances, who had removed from Chicago three years before, and occupied a handsome cottage nearly opposite Mr. Duncan's residence. She was a general favorite, not only for her good looks, but on account of her pleasant manner and sweet disposition.  \"Good morning, Florence,\" said Luke, with an answering smile.  \"What a pity you lost the race yesterday!\"  \"Randolph doesn't think so.\"  \"No; he is a very selfish boy, I am afraid.\"  \"Did you see the race?\" asked Luke.  \"No, but I heard all about it. If it hadn't been for Tom Harper you would have won, wouldn't you?\"  \"I think so.\"  \"All the boys say so. What could have induced Tom to get in the way?\"  \"I don't know. It was very foolish, however. He got badly hurt.\"  \"Tom is a friend of Randolph,\" said Florence significantly.  \"Yes,\" answered Luke; \"but I don't think Randolph would stoop to such a trick as that.\"  \"You wouldn't, Luke, but Randolph is a different boy. Besides, I hear he was trying for something else.\"  \"I know; his father offered him ten dollars besides.\"  \"I don't see why it is that some fare so much better than others,\" remarked Florence, thoughtfully. \"The watch and the money would have done you more good.\"  \"So they would, Florence, but I don't complain. I may be better off some day than I am now.\"  \"I hope you will, Luke,\" said Florence, cordially.  \"I am very much obliged to you for your good wishes,\" said Luke, warmly.  \"That reminds me, Luke, next week, Thursday, is my birthday, and I am to have a little party in the evening. Will you come?\"  Luke's face flushed with pleasure. Though he knew Florence very well from their being schoolfellows, he had never visited the house. He properly regarded the invitation as a compliment, and as a mark of friendship from one whose good opinion he highly valued.  \"Thank you, Florence,\" he said. \"You are very kind, and I shall have great pleasure in being present. Shall you have many?\"  \"About twenty. Your friend Randolph will be there.\"  \"I think there will be room for both of us,\" said Luke, with a smile.  The young lady bade him good morning and went on her way.  Two days later Luke met Randolph at the dry-goods store in the village.  \"What are you buying?\" asked Randolph, condescendingly.  \"Only a spool of thread for my mother.\"  \"I am buying a new necktie to wear to Florence Grant's birthday party,\" said Randolph, pompously.  \"I think I shall have to do the same,\" said Luke, enjoying the surprise he saw expressed on Randolph's face.  \"Are you going?\" demanded Randolph, abruptly.  \"Yes.\"  \"Have you been invited?\"  \"That is a strange question,\" answered Luke, indignantly. \"Do you think I would go without an invitation?\"  \"Really, it will be quite a mixed affair,\" said Randolph, shrugging his shoulders.  \"If you think so, why do you go?\"  \"I don't want to disappoint Florence.\"  Luke smiled. He was privately of the opinion that the disappointment wouldn't be intense.    CHAPTER VI  PREPARING FOR THE PARTY   The evening of the party arrived. It was quite a social event at Groveton, and the young people looked forward to it with pleasant anticipation. Randolph went so far as to order a new suit for the occasion. He was very much afraid it would not be ready in time, but he was not to be disappointed. At five o'clock on Thursday afternoon it was delivered, and Randolph, when arrayed in it, surveyed himself with great satisfaction. He had purchased a handsome new necktie, and he reflected with pleasure that no boy present--not even Linton--would be so handsomely dressed as himself. He had a high idea of his personal consequence, but he was also of the opinion that \"fine feathers make fine birds,\" and his suit was of fine cloth and stylish make.  \"I wonder what the janitor will wear?\" he said to himself, with a curl of the lip. \"A pair of overalls, perhaps. They would be very appropriate, certainly.\"  This was just the question which was occupying Luke's mind. He did not value clothes as Randolph did, but he liked to look neat. Truth to tell, he was not very well off as to wardrobe. He had his every-day suit, which he wore to school, and a better suit, which he had worn for over a year. It was of mixed cloth, neat in appearance, though showing signs of wear; but there was one trouble. During the past year Luke had grown considerably, and his coat-sleeves were nearly two inches too short, and the legs of his trousers deficient quite as much. Nevertheless, he dressed himself, and he, too, surveyed himself, not before a pier-glass, but before the small mirror in the kitchen.  \"Don't my clothes look bad, mother?\" he asked anxiously.  \"They are neat and clean, Luke,\" said his mother, hesitatingly.  \"Yes, I know; but they are too small.\"  \"You have been growing fast in the last year, Luke,\" said his mother, looking a little disturbed. \"I suppose you are not sorry for that?\"  \"No,\" answered Luke, with a smile, \"but I wish my coat and trousers had grown, too.\"  \"I wish, my dear boy, I could afford to buy you a new suit.\"  \"Oh, never mind, mother,\" said Luke, recovering his cheerfulness. \"They will do for a little while yet. Florence didn't invite me for my clothes.\"  \"No; she is a sensible girl. She values you for other reasons.\"  \"I hope so, mother. Still, when I consider how handsomely Randolph will be dressed, I can't help thinking that there is considerable difference in our luck.\"  \"Would you be willing to exchange with him, Luke?\"  \"There is one thing I wouldn't like to exchange.\"  \"And what is that?\"  \"I wouldn't exchange my mother for his,\" said Luke, kissing the widow affectionately. \"His mother is a cold, proud, disagreeable woman, while I have the best mother in the world.\"  \"Don't talk foolishly, Luke,\" said Mrs. Larkin; but her face brightened, and there was a warm feeling in her heart, for it was very pleasant to her to hear Luke speak of her in this way.  \"I won't think any more about it, mother,\" said Luke. \"I've got a new necktie, at any rate, and I will make that do.\"  Just then there was a knock at the door, and Linton entered.  \"I thought I would come round and go to the party with you, Luke,\" he said.  Linton was handsomely dressed, though he had not bought a suit expressly, like Randolph. He didn't appear to notice Luke's scant suit. Even if he had, he would have been too much of a gentleman to refer to it.  \"I think we shall have a good time,\" he said. \"We always do at Mrs. Grant's. Florence is a nice girl, and they know how to make it pleasant. I suppose we shall have dancing.\"  \"I don't know how to dance,\" said Luke, regretfully. \"I should like to have taken lessons last winter when Professor Bent had a class, but I couldn't afford it.\"  \"You have seen dancing?\"  \"Oh, yes.\"  \"It doesn't take much knowledge to dance a quadrille, particularly if you get on a side set. Come, we have an hour before it is time to go. Suppose I give you a lesson?\"  \"Do you think I could learn enough in that time to venture?\"  \"Yes, I do. If you make an occasional mistake it won't matter. So, if your mother will give us the use of the sitting-room, I will commence instructions.\"  Luke had looked at some dancers in the dining-room at the hotel, and was not wholly a novice, therefore. Linton was an excellent dancer, and was clear in his directions. It may also be said that Luke was a ready learner. So it happened at the end of the hour that the pupil had been initiated not only in the ordinary changes of the quadrille, but also in one contra dance, the Virginia Reel, which was a great favorite among the young people of Groveton.  \"Now, I think you'll do, Luke,\" said Linton, when the lesson was concluded. \"You are very quick to learn.\"  \"You think I won't be awkward, Linton?\"  \"No, if you keep cool and don't get flustered.\"  \"I am generally pretty cool. But I shall be rather surprised to see myself on the floor,\" laughed Luke.  \"No doubt others will be, but you'll have a great deal more fun.\"  \"So I shall. I don't like leaning against the wall while others are having a good time.\"  \"If you could dance as well as you can skate you would have no trouble, Luke.\"  \"No; that is where Randolph has the advantage of me.\"  \"He is a very great dancer, though he can't come up to you in skating. However, dancing isn't everything. Dance as well as he may, he doesn't stand as high in the good graces of Florence Grant as he would like to do.\"  \"I always noticed that he seemed partial to Florence.\"  \"Yes, but it isn't returned. How about yourself, Luke?\"  Luke, being a modest boy, blushed.  \"I certainly think Florence a very nice girl,\" he said.  \"I was sure of that,\" said Linton, smiling.  \"But I don't want to stand in your way, Linton,\" continued Luke, with a smile.  \"No danger, Luke. Florence is a year older than I am. Now, you are nearly two years older than she, and are better matched. So you needn't consider me in the matter.\"  Of course, this was all a joke. It was true, however, that of all the girls in Groveton, Luke was more attracted by Florence Grant than by any other, and they had always been excellent friends. It was well known that Randolph also was partial to the young lady, but he certainly had never received much encouragement.  Finally the boys got out, and were very soon at the door of Mrs. Grant's handsome cottage. It was large upon the ground, with a broad veranda, in the Southern style. In fact, Mrs. Grant was Southern by birth, and, erecting the house herself, had it built after the fashion of her Southern birthplace.  Most of the young visitors had arrived when Luke and Linton put in an appearance. They had been detained longer than they were aware by the dancing-lesson.  Randolph and Sam Noble were sitting"]]]
