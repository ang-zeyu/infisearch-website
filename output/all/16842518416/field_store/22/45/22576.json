Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst: but the water that I {36} shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. . . .  \"The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.  \"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.  \"The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when He is come. He will tell us all things.  [Sidenote: The testimony of the people of Sychar.]  \"Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am He.\" When she heard this remarkable declaration, the woman ran back to the city of Sychar and told the people what Jesus had said to her, asking them, \"Can this be the Christ?\" The people of Sychar went out themselves to see Jesus, and invited Him to stay with them. Jesus stayed there for two days, and many believed in Him because of His teachings. And when He left them to continue His journey to Galilee, the people said to the woman who had first met Jesus, \"Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the World.\"  {37} [Sidenote: Jesus taught always that He is the Christ.]  This experience of Jesus with the people of Sychar is full of interest and rich in meaning. We might spend much time in discussing it. But it is not necessary now to consider more than the fact that from the very beginning of His ministry, Jesus taught that He was really the Christ, the Savior of the world. He was not always so successful in getting the people to recognize Him--in getting them to know God and Jesus Christ whom He had sent--as He was here at Sychar. When at one time He bore the same testimony in the Temple, the priests and the people took up stones and would have stoned Him to death, had He not miraculously walked out of their midst. But always Jesus taught of Himself that He is the Christ.  [Sidenote: The answer to John.]  When the messengers of John the Baptist came to Him and asked, \"Art thou He that should come, or do we look for another?\" Jesus answered promptly, \"Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see: The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.\" These things were all signs of the coming of the Christ, and the answer was the same as if Jesus had said, \"Yes, I am He that should come; ye need not look for another.\"  [Sidenote: The confessions at the trials of Jesus.]  It was thus plainly and fearlessly that Jesus, at the end of His earthly life too, taught that He was the Redeemer of the world. When Jesus was haled before the high priest. {38} the high priest demanded, \"Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?\" Jesus answered boldly, \"I am: and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\" And to Pilate's question, \"Art thou the King of the Jews?\" Jesus replied, \"Thou sayest.\"  [Sidenote: And on the way to Emmaus.]  These answers and explanations are so clear to us now that it seems hardly possible the disciples of Jesus did not also understand them. Yet it was so; the disciples looked apparently for a powerful, earthly king. When Jesus was crucified, they were overwhelmed. For a while they did not know what to make of it. But Jesus Himself made all things clear. One day, after the crucifixion, two of the disciples were journeying toward Emmaus, talking about the strange things that had happened. Suddenly, the resurrected Savior joined them. Because these disciples had failed to understand the meaning of His mission on the earth, Jesus said to them, \"O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets. He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself.\" Thus did Jesus after His resurrection bear testimony to His teaching that He is verily the Christ, the Son of God.  [Sidenote: How shall we find out Christ?]  The knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, is, as we have already learned, necessary to gain eternal life, the greatest of all gifts. But how shall we come into possession of that knowledge? Shortly before His {39} death, Jesus taught His disciples thus: \"I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever.\" And a little later, \"When the Comforter is come, whom I will send you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of me.\" So, then, we may gain the knowledge, the testimony, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, through the inspiration of the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth. And to be influenced by the Spirit of Truth, we must ourselves worship in spirit and in truth. Sooner or later the testimony must be obtained, for it is decreed that every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ.  THE REFERENCES  John 4:1-42. Matt. 27:11.

Jesus had completed the years of preparation for His ministry of service. We know very little of what He did during the eighteen years from the time of His first visit to the temple to the time of His baptism. The historian Luke tells us that Jesus went down to Nazareth with His parents and was subject to them. \"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.\" The day of the baptism was momentous, however; for it was the day on which the special witness of Jesus made special recognition of Him as the Christ.  [Sidenote: The testimony at the baptism.]  John the Baptizer was performing the ordinance of baptism in the river Jordan for all those who requested it. Thither, then Jesus went; for He, too, wished to be baptized. But when Jesus approached, John felt that in Him was One greater than he; just such a One as he had himself predicted, whose shoestrings he was unworthy to untie. When, therefore, Jesus asked for baptism, John replied, \"I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?\"  \"And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered Him.  \"And Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straight-way out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto Him, and he (John) saw the Spirit of God {42} descending like a dove, and lighting upon Him. And, lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my Son, in whom I am well pleased.\"  [Sidenote: John's testimony.]  A little later, John bore testimony to those assembled about him, thus: \"I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and It abode upon Him. And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.\"  [Sidenote: Who the Comforter is.]  Now, this Spirit that John saw descending like a dove and lighting upon Jesus was the same Spirit that Jesus later promised--as we learned in the preceding chapter--and that was to testify of Him. Concerning this Spirit Jesus said also just before His crucifixion, \"I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.\"  Who, then, is this Spirit, this Comforter? Jesus tells plainly: \"The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name. He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\" The Holy Ghost, then, is a special witness to Jesus; and the Holy Ghost is a member of the Godhead in heaven. When Jesus commissioned the apostles after His resurrection to preach the Gospel, He said to them, \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing {43} them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\" It is further clear that, as a member of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost is a member separate and distinct from God and the Son; for at the baptism of the Son, all three were individually and separately present.  [Sidenote: The mission of the Holy Ghost.]  The duties of the Holy Ghost are many. When Nicodemus came by night to be instructed by Jesus, Jesus assured him that, \"except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;\" for, said He, \"that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\" This means, of course, that when one receives the gift of the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54292"],["title","What Jesus Taught (#5)"],["body","Ghost, one enters upon a new spiritual life. And in bringing about such a new spiritual life, the Holy Ghost convinces the sinner of his evil deeds, and leads him to the truth, testifying as we have already learned of the Christ.  [Sidenote: The Holy Ghost in Jesus and the apostles.]  Jesus, himself, was \"full of the Holy Ghost.\" After the ascension. His promise of a Comforter was literally fulfilled to the Apostles. On the day of Pentecost, they \"were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.\"  [Sidenote: The Holy Ghost amongst the Nephites.]  On the American continent, too, as you must remember, Jesus chose twelve apostles. The Holy Ghost rested mightily upon them, and the way in which Jesus conferred the Holy Ghost on them is interesting. The third Nephi records the incident in these words: \"It came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these sayings, {44} He touched with His hand the disciples whom He had chosen, one by one, even until He had touched them all, and spake unto them as He touched them.\" Moroni describes the incident more fully: \"The words of Christ, which He spake unto His disciples, the twelve whom He had chosen, as He laid His hands upon them. And He called them by name, saying, ye shall call on the Father, in my name, in mighty prayer; and after ye have done this, ye shall have power that on him whom ye shall lay your hands, ye shall give the Holy Ghost; and in my name shall ye give it, for thus do mine apostles.\"  [Sidenote: How to confer the Holy Ghost.]  As Jesus Himself did, then, amongst the Nephites, and as He instructed the Nephite apostles to do, so also did the Jewish apostles. They conferred the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. It is the proper way. When the Church was re-established by the great American, Joseph Smith, the ordinance of the laying on of hands was restored with it.  [Sidenote: Nature of the Holy Ghost.]  Now, you may be wondering, what kind of being is the Holy Ghost, that it may be conferred by the laying on of hands? Many people have wondered about the same thing. Indeed, even learned men have wondered so much that they have become utterly confused. Yet, here again, the truth is very simple. Jesus said to Joseph Smith, \"The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.\"  {45} [Sidenote: Importance of the Holy Ghost.]  You can readily see that the Holy Ghost is a very important personage. First, He is a member of the Godhead. Then, through His influence we are led from darkness into light, and are thus enabled to recognize the truth. Then He testifies of Jesus Christ, and of God who sent Him. Indeed, so important is the testimony of the Holy Ghost that Jesus Christ Himself asserted that all sins may be forgiven except the sin against the Holy Ghost. And to Joseph Smith, Jesus said that the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost consisted in the denying of the testimony that Jesus is the Christ, after having once received that testimony, and thus approving of His death. The denial of such a testimony would be the denial of the Holy Ghost also; for \"no man can know that Jesus is the Christ, but by the Holy Ghost.\"  THE REFERENCES  Matt. 3:13-16. John 3:34.

The barges in which his people were to cross the ocean were prepared; but he had been unable to devise a means of lighting them. So, with childlike faith and complete confidence he called upon the Father.  \"I know, O Lord,\" said the brother of Jared, \"that Thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever Thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with Thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light when we shall cross the sea . . . .  \"And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth His hand and touched the stones, one by one with His finger; and the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was like the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared fell down before the Lord, for he was struck with fear.\"  You may easily imagine that such a vision would amaze any man. And the brother of Jared, though he was a very good and righteous man, and a prophet of God, seems not to have suspected before this time that God and Jesus Christ had bodies of flesh as material {48} and tangible as man's. What the brother of Jared thought God to be, we do not know. But when the Lord saw that he had fallen to the ground in amazement, He said, \"Arise, why hast thou fallen?\"  \"And he saith unto the Lord, I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest He should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood.\"  But much as the brother of Jared was astonished at this marvelous revelation, there remained for him yet greater wonders. The Lord commended him for his great faith, which had made it possible for him to see the finger of the Lord. Then the Lord asked, \"Sawest thou more than this? And he answered Nay; Lord, show Thyself unto me.\"  \"Behold, the Lord showed Himself unto him, and said....Behold, I am He who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have light, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters. And never have I shown myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning, after mine own image.  \"Behold, this body which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit, and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit, will I appear unto my people in the flesh.\"  {49} [Sidenote: The pre-existence of Jesus.]  This marvelous vision, the brother of Jared beheld many hundreds of years before Jesus was born in Bethlehem. Do you think you understand the great truths that Jesus here revealed to the Jaredite prophet? First, it must be evident to everyone that Jesus had existence--that He lived and worked--before He was born in the flesh upon the earth. But what kind of existence was this pre-existence? It was an existence in the spirit state. And the spirit body of Jesus is in form and shape just like the mortal body; so that, when Jesus helped to form man. He formed him after the image of His own body. This is the second great truth we learn from the remarkable vision. And a third is, that Jesus was appointed \"from the foundation of the world\" to redeem mankind. In the pre-existence He labored for us; there He was chosen to redeem us. His mission upon the earth, and the sacrifice of His noble life, were but the completion of a plan formulated long before He was born.  [Sidenote: The spirits of all men eternal.]  Now, you may say, \"Of course, we know that Jesus lived before He was born in the flesh, and that He had a spirit of the same form and shape as His mortal body, and that He was chosen in that pre-existent life to redeem the world from sin. But it may not be so with man.\"  That is one of the wonderful things about life. We are here passing through only one small stage of it. Jesus taught that the spirits of all men are eternal just like His own. For Jesus truly recognized and understood His own pre-existence. Said He, once, as He prayed, \"And now, O Father, glorify Thou me with {50} Thine own self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was.\" And at another time He asked, \"What and if Ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where He was before? I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.\" Thus, with complete assurance He spoke of the time that had been before; and with the same assurance He accepted the teaching that man, too, existed before he was born in the flesh.  [Sidenote: The man born blind.]  One day, in the temple, Jesus had taught this very doctrine to the Jews. In answer to one of their questions. He had replied, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you. Before Abraham was I am.\" The answer provoked the Jews, and they took up stones to stone Him. \"But Jesus hid Himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.\"  Then follows a remarkable little story, touching the doctrine He had just presented in the temple, and here discussed in this chapter. \"As Jesus passed by, He saw a man which was blind from his birth. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\"  Now, we must remember that in those days people believed affliction to be always a punishment for some sin or other. We can easily understand that the parents of the man might have sinned; and through their sin, they might have"]]]
