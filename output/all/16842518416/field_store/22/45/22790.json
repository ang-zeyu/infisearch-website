She would have received a rebuff. It is horrible.\"  \"The disappointment of Paraetonium is added to the other burdens,\" observed Archibius.  \"A feather compared with the rest,\" cried Iras indignantly.  \"What a spectacle!  A shrivelled soul, never too large, in the body of a powerful giant.  Disaster crushes the courage of the descendant of Herakles.  The weakling will drag the Queen's splendid courage with him into the dust.\"  \"We will do our best to prevent it,\" replied Archibius firmly. \"The immortals have placed you and Charmian at her side to sustain her, if her own strength fails.  The time to test your powers has arrived.\"  \"I know my duty,\" replied Iras austerely.  \"Prove it!\" said Archibius earnestly.  \"You think you have cause for anger against Charmian.\"  \"Whoever treats my foes so tenderly can doubtless dispense with my affection.  Where is your ward?\"  \"That you shall learn later,\" replied Charmian advancing.  \"But when you do know, you will have still better reason to doubt my love; yet it was only to save one dear to me from misery, certainly not to grieve you, that I stepped between you and Barine.  And now let me say--had you wounded me to the quick, and everything dear to the Greek heart called to me for vengeance--I should impose upon myself whatever constraint might be necessary to deny the impulse, because this breast contains a love stronger, more powerful, than the fiercest hate.  And this love we both share.  Hate me, strive to wound and injure one at whose side you have hitherto stood like a daughter, but beware of robbing me of the strength and freedom which I need, to be and to offer to my royal mistress all the assistance in my power.  I have just been consulting my brother about leaving Cleopatra's service.\"  \"Now?\" Iras broke in vehemently.  \"No, no!  Not that!  It must not be! She cannot spare you now.\"  \"More easily, perhaps, than you,\" replied Charmian; \"yet in many things my services might be hard to replace.\"  \"Nothing under the sun could do it,\" cried Iras eagerly.  \"If, in these days of trouble, she should lose you too--\"  \"Still darker ones are approaching,\" interrupted Archibius positively. \"Perhaps you will learn all to-morrow.  Whether Charmian yields to her desire for rest, or continues in the service of the Queen, depends on you.  If you wish her to remain you must not render it too hard for her to do so.  We three, my child, are perhaps the only persons at this court to whom the Queen's happiness is more than their own, and therefore we should permit no incident, whatever name it may bear, to cloud our harmony.\"  Iras threw back her head with angry pride, exclaiming passionately: \"Was it I who injured you?  I do not know in what respect.  But you and Charmian--though you have so long been aware that this heart was closed against every love save one--stepped between me and the man for whom I have yearned since childhood, and built the bridge which united Dion and Barine.  I held the woman I hated in my grasp, and thanked the immortals for the boon; but you two--it is not difficult to guess the secret you are still trying to keep from me--you aided her to escape.  You have robbed me of my revenge; you have again placed the singer in the path where she must find the man to whom I have a better and older claim, and who perhaps may still be considering which of us two will be the better mistress of his house, if Alexas and his worthy brother do not arrange matters so that we must both content ourselves with thinking tenderly of a dead man.  That is why I believe that I am no longer indebted to you, that Charmian has more than repaid herself for all the kindness she has ever showed me.\"  With these words she hurried to the door, but paused on the threshold, exclaiming: \"This is the state of affairs; yet I am ready to serve the Queen hand in hand with you as before; for you two--as I have said--are necessary to her.  In other respects--I shall follow my own path.\"     CHAPTER XVII.  Cleopatra had sought the venerable Anubis, who now, as the priest of Alexander, at the age of eighty, ruled the whole hierarchy of the country.  It was difficult for him to leave his arm-chair, but he had been carried to the observatory to examine the adverse result of the observation made by the Queen herself.  The position of the stars, however, had been so unfavourable that the more deeply Cleopatra entered into these matters, the less easy he found it to urge the mitigating influences of distant planets, which he had at first pointed out.  In his reception-hall, however, the chief priest had assured her that the independence of Egypt and the safety of her own person lay in her hands; only--the planets showed this--a terrible sacrifice was required--a sacrifice of which his dignity, his eighty years, and his love for her alike forbade him to speak.  Cleopatra was accustomed to hear these mysterious sayings from his lips, and interpreted them in her own way. Many motives had induced her to seek the venerable prelate at this late hour.  In difficult situations he had often aided her with good counsel; but this time she was not led to him by the magic cup of Nektanebus, which the eight pastophori who accompanied it had that day restored to the temple, for since the battle of Actium the superb vessel had been a source of constant anxiety to her.  Cleopatra had now asked the teacher of her childhood the direct question whether the cup--a wide, shallow vessel, with a flat, polished bottom could really have induced Antony to leave the battle and follow her ere the victory was decided.  She had used it just before the conflict between the galleys, and this circumstance led Anubis to answer positively in the affirmative.  Long ago the marvellous chalice had been exhibited to her among the temple treasures, and she was told that every one who induced another person to be reflected from its shining surface obtained the mastery over his will.  Her wish to possess it, however, was not gratified, and she did not ask for it again until the limitless devotion and ardent love of Antony had seemed less fervent than of yore.  From that time she had never ceased to urge her aged friend to place the wondrous cup in her keeping.  At first he had absolutely refused, predicting that its use would bring misfortune upon her; but when her request was followed by an imperative command, and the goblet was entrusted to her, Anubis himself believed that this one vessel did possess the magic power attributed to it.  He deemed that the drinking-cup afforded the strongest proof of the magic art, far transcending human ability, of the great goddess by whose aid King Nektanebus--who, according to tradition, was the father of Alexander the Great--was said to have made the vessel in the Isis island of Philoe.  Anubis had intended to remind Cleopatra of his refusal, and show her the great danger incurred by mortals who strove to use powers beyond their sphere.  It had been his purpose to bid her remember Phaeton, who had almost kindled a conflagration in the world, when he attempted, in the chariot of his father, Phoebus Apollo, to guide the horses of the sun. But this was unnecessary, for he had scarcely assented to the question ere, with passionate vehemence, she ordered him to destroy before her eyes the cup which had brought so much misfortune.  The priest feigned that her desire harmonized with a resolution which he had himself formed.  In fact, before her arrival, he had feared that the goblet might be used in some fatal manner if Octavianus should take possession of the city and country, and the wonder-working vessel should fall into his hands.  Nektanebus had made the cup for Egypt.  To wrest it from the foreign ruler was acting in the spirit of the last king in whose veins had flowed the blood of the Pharaohs, and who had toiled with enthusiastic devotion for the independence and liberty of his people. To destroy this man's marvellous work rather than deliver it to the Roman conqueror seemed to the chief priest, after the Queen's command, a sacred duty, and as such he represented it to be when he commanded the smelting furnace to be fired and the cup transformed into a shapeless mass before the eyes of Cleopatra.  While the metal was melting he eagerly told the Queen how easily she could dispense with the vessel which owed its magic power to the mighty Isis.  The spell of woman's charms was also a gift of the goddess.  It would suffice to render Antony's heart soft and yielding as the fire melted the gold.  Perhaps the Imperator had forfeited, with the Queen's respect, her love--the most priceless of blessings.  He, Anubis, would regard this as a great boon of the Deity; \"for,\" he concluded, \"Mark Antony is the cliff which will shatter every effort to secure to my royal mistress undiminished the heritage which has come to her and her children from their ancestors, and preserve the independence and prosperity of this beloved land.  This cup was a costly treasure.  The throne and prosperity of Egypt are worthy of greater sacrifices.  But I know that there is none harder for a woman to make than her love.\"  The meaning of the old man's words Cleopatra learned the following morning, when she granted the first interview to Timagenes, Octavianus's envoy.  The keen-witted, brilliant man, who had been one of her best teachers and with whom, when a pupil, she had had many an argument, was kindly received, and fulfilled his commission with consummate skill.  The Queen listened attentively to his representations, showed him that her own intellect had not lost in flexibility, though it had gained power; and when she dismissed him, with rich gifts and gracious words, she knew that she could preserve "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5479"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 07 (#6)"],["body","independence of her beloved native land and retain the throne for herself and her children if she would surrender Antony to the conqueror or to him, as \"the person acting,\" or--these were Timagenes's own words--\"remove him forever from the play whose end she had the power to render either brilliant or fateful.\"  When she was again alone her heart throbbed so passionately and her soul was in such a tumult of agitation that she felt unable to attend the appointed meeting of the Council of the crown.  She deferred the session until the following day, and resolved to go out upon the sea, to endeavour to regain her composure.  Antony had refused to see her.  This wounded her.  The thought of the goblet and its evil influences had by no means passed from her memory with the destruction of the vessel caused by one of those outbursts of passion to which, in these days of disaster, she yielded more frequently than usual.  On the contrary, she felt the necessity of being alone, to collect her thoughts and strive to dispel the clouds from her troubled soul.  The beaker had been one of the treasures of Isis, and the memory of it recalled hours during which, in former days, she had often found composure in the temple of the goddess.  She wished to seek the sanctuary unnoticed and, accompanied only by Iras and the chief Introducer, went, closely veiled, to the neighbouring temple at the Corner of the Muses.  But she failed to find the object of her pilgrimage.  The throng which filled it to pray and offer sacrifices, and the fear of being recognized, destroyed her calmness.  She was in the act of retiring, when Gorgias, the architect, followed by an assistant carrying surveying instruments, advanced towards her.  She instantly called him to her side, and he informed her how wonderfully Fate itself seemed to favour her plan of building.  The mob had destroyed the house of the old philosopher Didymus, and the grey-haired sage, to whom he had offered the shelter of his home, was now ready to transfer the property inherited from his ancestors, if her Majesty would assure him and his family of her protection.  Then she asked to see the architect's plan for joining the museum to the sanctuary, and became absorbed in the first sketch, to which he had devoted part of the night and morning.  He showed it, and with eager urgency Cleopatra commanded him to begin the building as soon as possible and pursue the work night and day.  What usually required months must be completed in weeks.  Iras and the \"Introducer,\" clad in plain garments, had waited for her in the temple court and, joined by the architect, accompanied her to the unpretending litter standing at one of the side gates but, instead of entering it, she ordered Gorgias to attend her to the garden.  The inspection proved that the architect was right and, even if the mausoleum occupied a portion of it, and the street which separated it from the Temple of Isis were continued along the shore of the sea, the remainder would still be twice as large as the one belonging to the palace at Lochias.  Cleopatra's thorough examination showed Gorgias that she had some definite purpose in view.  Her inquiry whether it would be possible to connect it with the promontory of Lochias indicated what she had in mind, and the architect answered in the affirmative.  It was only necessary to tear down some small buildings belonging to the Crown and a little temple of Berenike at the southern part of the royal harbour.  The arm of the Agathodaemon Canal which entered here had been bridged long ago.  The new scene which would result from this change had been conjured before the Queen's mental vision with marvellous celerity, and she described it in brief, vivid language to the architect.  The garden should remain, but must be enlarged from the Lochias to the bridge. Thence a covered colonnade would lead to the palace.  After Gorgias had assured her that all this could easily be arranged, she gazed thoughtfully at the ground for a time, and then gave orders that the work should be commenced at once, and requested him to spare neither means nor men.  Gorgias foresaw a period of feverish toil, but it did not daunt him. With such a master builder he was ready to roof the whole city.  Besides, the commission delighted him because it proved that the woman whose mausoleum was to rise from the earth so swiftly still thought of enhancing the pleasures of existence; for, though she wished the garden to remain unchanged, she desired to see the colonnade and the remainder of the work constructed of costly materials and in beautiful forms.  When she bade him farewell, Gorgias kissed her robe with ardent enthusiasm.  What a woman!  True, she had not even raised her veil, and was attired in plain dark clothing, but every gesture revealed the most perfect grace.  The arm and hand with which she pointed now here, now there, again seemed to him fairly instinct with life; and he, who deemed perfection of form of so much value, found it difficult to avert his eyes from her marvellous symmetry.  And her whole figure!  What lines, what genuine aristocratic elegance, and warm, throbbing life!  That morning when Helena, now an inmate of his own home, greeted him, he had essayed to compare her, mentally, with Cleopatra, but speedily desisted.  The man to whom Hebe proffers nectar does not ask for even the best wine of Byblus.  A feeling of grateful, cheerful satisfaction, difficult to describe, stole over him when the reserved, quiet Helena addressed him so warmly and cordially; but the image of Cleopatra constantly thrust itself between them, and it was difficult for him to understand himself.  He had loved many women in succession, and now his heart throbbed for two at once, and the Queen was the brighter of the two stars whose light entranced him.  Therefore his honest soul would have considered it a crime to woo Helena now.  Cleopatra knew what an ardent admirer she had won in the able architect, and the knowledge pleased her.  She had used no goblet to gain him. Doubtless he would begin to build the mausoleum the next morning.  The vault must have space for several coffins.  Antony had more than once expressed the desire to be buried beside her, wherever he might die, and this had occurred ere she possessed the beaker.  She must in any case grant him the same favour, no matter in what place or by whose hand he met death, and the bedimmed light of his existence was but too evidently nearing extinction.  If she spared him, Octavianus would strike him from the ranks of the living, and she----Again she was overpowered by the terrible, feverish restlessness which had induced her to command the destruction of the goblet, and had brought her to the temple.  She could not return in this mood to meet her councillors, receive visitors, greet her children.  This was the birthday of the twins; Charmian had reminded her of it and undertaken to provide the gifts.  How could she have found time and thought for such affairs?  She had returned from the chief priest late in the evening, yet had asked for a minute description of the condition in which they found Mark Antony.  The report made by Iras harmonized with the state in which she had herself seen him during and after the battle.  Ay, his brooding gloom seemed to have deepened. Charmian had helped her dress in the morning, and had been on the point of making her difficult confession, and owning that she had aided Barine to escape the punishment of her royal mistress; but ere she could begin, Timagenes was announced, for Cleopatra had not risen from her couch until a late hour.  The object for which the Queen had sought the temple had not been gained; but the consultation with Gorgias had diverted her mind, and the emotions which the thought of her last resting-place had evoked now drowned everything else, as the roar of the surf dominates the twittering of the swallows on the rocky shore.  Ay, she needed calmness!  She must weigh and ponder over many things in absolute quietude, and this she could not obtain at Lochias.  Then her glance rested upon the little sanctuary of Berenike, which she had ordered removed to make room for a garden near at hand, where the children could indulge their love of creative work.  It was empty.  She need fear no interruption there.  The interior contained only a single, quiet, pleasant chamber, with the image of Berenike.  The \"Introducer\" commanded the guard to admit no other visitors, and soon the little white marble, circular room with its vaulted roof received the Queen.  She sank down on one of the bronze benches opposite to the statue.  All was still; in this cool silence her mind, trained to thought, could find that for which it longed--clearness of vision, a plain understanding of her own feelings and position in the presence of the impending decision.  At first her thoughts wandered to and fro like a dove ere it chooses the direction of its flight; but after the question why she was having a tomb built so hurriedly, when she would be permitted to live, her mind found the right track.  Among the Scythian guards, the Mauritanians, and Blemmyes in the army there were plenty of savage fellows whom a word from her lips and a handful of gold would have set upon the vanquished Antony, as the huntsman's \"Seize him!\" urges the hounds.  A hint, and among the wretched magicians and Magians in the Rhakotis, the Egyptian quarter of the city, twenty men would have assassinated him by poison or wily snares; one command to the Macedonians in the guard of the Mellakes or youths, and he would be a captive that very day, and to-morrow, if she so ordered, on the way to Asia, whither Octavianus, as Timagenes told her, had gone.  What prevented her from grasping the gold, giving the hint, issuing the command?  Doubtless she thought of the magic goblet, now melted, which had constrained him to cast aside honour, fame, and power, as worthless rubbish, in order "]]]
