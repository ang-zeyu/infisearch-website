It holds good among horses, and I suppose cattle of all kinds; it even holds good if we go down the scale of organic life, and apply it to fruit and flowers; but how about the wilder animals, and our forest trees?  Take the latter first--will the acorns of a garden-grown oak-tree, or the cone of a transplanted Scotch pine, produce such noble specimens as those that toss their giant arms in the forest or on mountain-side?  Or will a menagerie-bred lion, or tiger--feed them ever so well--ever reach the noble proportions of those animals who in freedom tread the African desert, or roam uncaged and untrammelled through the jungles of Eastern India?  What prison-born elephant ever reached in height to the shoulders even, of the gigantic bulls that my poor friend, Gordon Cumming, used to slay?  Do eagles, owls, the wilder hawks, alligators, or anacondas do anything else but degenerate in captivity?  But even admitting, hypothetically, that the rule would hold good as regards cats, there isn't such a very great difference in the size of the tame and wild cats after all.  I do not think that all the wild cats ever I saw in Scotland or elsewhere, would average over ten to twelve pounds; and twelve pounds is no unusual weight for our domestic cheety.  Another thing that has often struck me is this: the farther north you go in Scotland, and the nearer to the abode of the wild cat, the greater is the resemblance in head and tail, and often in colour, of the tame cat to the wild.  And, mark you, the domestic is often known to inter-breed with the wild cat, and the offspring can be tamed and reared.  This is considered nothing unusual in the Highlands.  CHAPTER THREE.  BREEDS AND CLASSES.  THE TORTOISESHELL.  The classification I propose of the domestic cat is an exceedingly simple one, as I think all classifications ought to be; it will, I trust, however, be found quite sufficient, and a useful one.  We have first, then, the two and only two distinct breeds mentioned above, viz:--One.  The European Cat.  Two.  The Asiatic.  From these two alone, if you get them of different colours, you can very easily manufacture all the varieties and various-coloured pussies you are ever likely to meet with, either on the show-benches or in domestic life.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ONE.  The European, short-haired, or Western Cats.  These I divide into five primary classes, namely--1, _Tortoiseshell_; 2, _Black_; 3, _White_; 4, _Blue_ or _Slate-colour_; and 5, the _Tabbies_.  The _Tortoiseshell_ I subdivide into secondary classes: 1, the pure Tortoiseshell; and 2, the Tortoiseshell-and-white.  The _Black_ is subdivided likewise into two: 1, pure Black; and 2, Black-and-white.  The _White_ has no subdivision, but is bred in with any or all the other classes.  The _Blue_ or _Slate-coloured Cat_.  These are subdivided into two: 1, the pure Blue; and 2, the Blue-and-white.  _Tabbies_ are easily subdivided into four classes, viz:--1, the Red Tabby; 2, the Brown Tabby; 3, the Blue or Silver Tabby; and 4, the Spotted Tabby.  There are other odd cats, such as the Manx or tailless cat, the hybrid, the six-clawed cat, and some curiously-coloured animals, which I shall mention in another place, for these have no right to have classes of their own, any more than black-and-tan Newfoundlands, or kittens with eight legs.  I shall take these in their order of rotation.  1.  _The Tortoiseshell Cat_.--This might also be called the black-and-tan cat.  If you want to get a good idea of the colour this cat is, or ought to be, take a keek through a lady's tortoiseshell back-hair comb.  That is about it; but you never see such perfection in pussy's coat.  For many a long year it was almost universally believed that there never was any such thing as a tortoiseshell male or Tom cat, or ever could be; and many an anxious search has many an old maid had over her newly-born litter of kits, to see if she would be fortunate enough to find the much-to-be-desired anomaly.  For, bear in mind, a belief used to be pretty current that 300 pounds--or was it 500 pounds?--would be paid over some counter, by some fool or fools unknown, to anyone who should be able to put the possibility of the existence of a tortoiseshell Tom beyond dispute--by producing one.  I saw an advertisement the other day in _The Live Stock Journal_, offering for sale a tortoiseshell Tom, at the low price of 100 pounds!  I hope, if only for poor Tom's sake, that somebody with more money than brains bought it--for the cat anyone paid 100 pounds for would, I should think, be certain of good milk and generous treatment.  I knew a poor old woman in Skye, and this old woman's pussy was as pussies love to be.  And lo! one night the old woman, in the silence of night, dreamed a dream.  She thought that the cat came to her bedside, and said to her, \"Arise, mistress, come and see.\"  That she followed pussy at once.  That pussy led her to the barn.  That there she found, cuddled together in a heap upon an old sack, no less than five tortoiseshell Toms.  She dreamt besides that she sold the lot for 1,000 pounds each, and bought a carriage and four, right off the reel, and set up for a lady of fashion on the spot.  Anxiously did the old woman watch for her cattie's accouchement, but much to her disappointment they all had white about them.  Next time that pussy was in the same way, her mistress had an old tortoiseshell comb nailed up above its bed.  Even this didn't do, so--for by this time the ancient dame had tortoiseshell Tom on the brain--she set out for Portree, a distance of fully sixteen miles, where she managed to procure a live tortoise as a playmate for her pet.  Pussy never took much to the tortoise; all she did was to sit and watch it, and whenever it protruded its scaly head, the cat smacked it in again.  This might have been the reason why her kittens had all white about them the third time.  The old woman didn't despair, however; she took to praying, and prayed in English, and prayed in Gaelic, and she told me seriously that she never doubted but that her prayers would one day be answered--_if_, she added, _it was for her good_.  I didn't doubt it either, but Tom never came ashore as long as I was in the island, neither was the old creature's snuff-box ever empty.  I have but little fancy for this breed myself.  They are usually sour-tempered, unfriendly little things to all save those who own and love them.  They are, moreover, not very prepossessing.  I speak of the cat as _I_ have found it, and I doubt not there are many exceptions.  _Merits_.--They are excellent and patient mousers, and the _best_ of hunters.  They are likewise good mothers.  They are as game as a bull and terrier--in fact they seem to fear nothing on four legs; and when they do take off the gloves to fight, I pity the animal they tackle, for what the tortoiseshell lacks in weight, she makes up for amply in courage.  They are very wise and sagacious, and faithful to the death to those who own them.  _Points_.--1.  _Size_: You don't look for a very large cat of the pure tortoiseshell breed, nor a very pretty one.  The larger the better to a certain extent.  I have known a small-sized tortoiseshell cat follow the rats even into their own burrows, again and again, until she had exterminated them. 2.  _Head_: The head is small and rather bullety, the ears moderately large and nicely cocked, and the eyes small, and the darker the better. 3.  _Colour and markings_: The colour is as near tortoiseshell as possible, and the markings must not only be deep and pretty, but very distinct in the centre, although blending insensibly where they meet, and artistically arranged.  You mustn't expect to find the colour or markings very nicely arranged on the male tortoiseshell. No white is allowed on this breed of cat.  Tortoiseshell Tom _is_ tortoiseshell Tom, and prefers to be judged alone and on his own merits; for, as a rule, his right there is none to dispute. 4.  _Pelage_ or _Coat_: Hair moderately short, but _very_ fine, glossy, and silken. N.B.--Knock off from five to eight points for _cinder-holes_.  I now give the points in a tabular form, with their full value.  Not, remember, that as a rule I go in for judging by points; still, a table of this sort has its value, as one can see just at a glance what is looked for in each breed, and what isn't:--  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Points of the Tortoiseshell Cat.  1.  Size, 5.  2.  Head, 10.  3.  Colour and markings, 25.  4.  Pelage, 10.  Total, 50.  The next pussy which demands a few passing remarks is _The Tortoiseshell-and-white_.  This is often a very beautiful cat, more especially when young, as, when old, they sometimes degenerate into very lazy habits, especially if they have a large amount of white about them. They are pretty, and they seem to know it, taking great delight in keeping the white portions of their fur as pure as snow.  I knew a cat something of this breed, who was nearly all white, excepting a beautiful tortoiseshell patch on the upper part of one thigh.  She was unexceptionably cleanly, and the frantic efforts she used to make to wash off that spot of black-and-amber were ridiculous to behold.  She would sit for hours admiring herself in the glass, and occasionally dipping her paw in her saucer of milk, until she spied that unhappy spot; to that she would at once devote a good half-hour, but finding no appreciable difference in it, she would start away in high dudgeon, swishing her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],["title","The Domestic Cat (#3)"],["body","about, like a lion in love.  That spot was the only barrier to pussy's bliss.  _Moral_: There's no such thing as perfect happiness here below--even to a cat.  CHAPTER FOUR.  THE BLACK CAT.  Next on the list of classification comes the _Black Cat_, subdivided into--1, the Pure Black; and 2, the Black-and-white.  1.  _The Pure Black_.--This is one of my pet breeds.  The pure black cat is such a noble, gentlemanly fellow, and if well-bred and trained--and he is capable of a very large amount of training--he is one of the best and most useful cats you can have in the house.  There is no namby-pambiness about black Tom, and no squeamishness either.  You can take him or tire of him, just as you please; it is all one to Tom. There is a certain independence about his every movement, and an assumption of dignity, as he saunters about the house, gazes at the fire of a winter's evening, or rolls himself in the sunniest spot of the garden in summer, that are both amusing and delightful.  Black Tom will give you a paw, but you may take it or leave it, just as suits you; and if you annoy him too much, he will very quickly cast his gloves and make you laugh with the wrong side of your mouth, as the saying is.  And it is quite astonishing, too, what a beautiful deep and cleanly-cut wound-- I speak feelingly, as a surgeon--Tom can make on the fleshy portion of your hand, or down the side of your nose.  For black Tom, and all the race of black cats, seem to have made up their minds ages ago not to stand any nonsense from man or beast.  But you mustn't run away with the idea that black Tom is a pugnacious animal, or fond of fighting for fighting's sake.  No, Tom is never aggressive; he stands a good deal before he is thoroughly roused, and, to tell the truth, I have more than once seen a tortoiseshell thrash a black cat double its size.  But if there is a lady cat in the play, the affections of a queen to be gained, or if black Tom has made up his mind to carry war into the heart of a rival's camp, doesn't he go at it with a will!  If the other cat will not surrender, ten to one all you'll find of that cat in the morning will be the front teeth, the wind of the battle having blown all the fluff away, while, if you cast your eyes upwards, you will see black Tom on the top of the wall making love to his Dinah, and looking as if butter wouldn't melt in his mouth.  Black Tom is generally most exemplary in the matter of cleanliness, personal or otherwise--there you have him again.  And he is as proud as Lucifer--for he is quite well aware that he _is_ good-looking.  If he were a man, he is just the sort of fellow who would wear a well-fitting coat, spotless linen, and well-fitting boots and gloves, and part his hair in the centre without appearing a cad.  You will seldom see cinder-holes in black Tom; if you do, you may lay your honour on it, that the animal is either aged and infirm, or suffering from some internal disorder.  The black cat might be called the Newfoundland of the feline race, not only in colour, but in nearly all his ways.  He is not the pussy, however, I like to see made a pet of by children, for two reasons-- first, he is too fine an animal to be crumpled and spoiled; and, secondly, because, like a good many Newfoundlands, he is liable at times to be just a little uncertain in temper.  Although he cannot save life, like his prototype, still black Tom makes the best of black guards, and will protect his master or mistress, or their property.  One or two that I happen to think of now, keep a watch on their master's wares just as a dog would.  One belonging to Mr Taylor, of Cumministon, \"clooked\" a little boy in the very act of stealing a piece of butter, and held him, growling fiercely the while, until his master came.  The same cat would keep the packet of groceries ordered by a customer, until the money was paid, and he was told it was all right.  The cunning and wiliness of the black cat is sometimes highly amusing.  I have known a cat of this breed feign death to escape a thrashing; that is, when being thrashed, he pretended that one of the blows had suddenly killed him, and would lie to all appearance stark and stiff on the floor for several minutes; but if you watched him narrowly you would presently see just a line of his cute brown eye, and as soon as the coast was clear, Tom would come to life again, and be off like a shot.  Black cats are sometimes thieves.  I know the reader would put it in more forcible language, but don't you expect for a single moment that I will say more against my pets than the exigencies of truth compel me to, so there!  I say they are at times just a _leetle_ addicted to appropriating what they have but small legal right to.  But there is this to be said in their favour--when they are thieves _they are swells at it_.  I have a black cat in my eye at this very moment, and if, my _dear_ lady, you are at all fond of that sort of thing, it would, simply do your heart good to watch that pussy stalking steak.  He is such an honest-looking cat, you see, and from the easy way he sits in the doorway opposite the butcher's, with his half-shut eyes and his dreamy air, you would feel convinced that the house was his home, that all the adjoining property belonged to him, and he had a vote in Parliament and a seat on the municipal bench.  But bide a wee till Blocks turns round to serve a customer, when pop! fuss!! honest Tom is round the corner with a pound of beef in his mouth, before you could say \"Muslin!\"  Oh! it's charming, I assure you, but rather rough on Blocks.  I must confess, too, that, at times, there is about a black Tom cat a look which you can only designate as Satanical--Mephistophelean, then, if you object to the other word--and I have no doubt it is this look of devil-beauty in Tom which has often led him to be suspected of being either an imp of darkness or possessed of one.  A witch, you know, is generally supposed to have as a companion a familiar spirit in the shape of a black cat.  Superstitions connected with the black cat are still common in some parts of the country and among sailors.  We had a black Tom in the _Penguin_ which led us many a pretty dance.  He was treated as a fiend, poor fellow, and behaved as such; and the captain was as much afraid of him as anybody else, and never failed to let go the life-buoy and lower a boat when Tom missed his footing and fell overboard, which the cat had a happy knack of doing periodically.  Tom was missed, though, one morning, and seen again no more.  He had doubtless fallen into the sea in the darkness of the middle watch.  This cat had a strange method of fishing, which is worthy of notice. You are, I suppose, aware that flying fish are caught by exposing a light on deck, which they always vault towards.  Black Tom's eyes had the same effect.  He would sit on the bulwarks and glare into the sea till a fish flew towards or over him, then he nabbed it nimbly.  Just before we came to the Cape, for the last time in that commission, I heard two blue-jackets conversing about this black Tom.  \"Look, see!\" one was saying, \"I think he were a devil, nothin' more and nothin' less; and I'll bet you five bob he were a devil.\"  \"Done,\" said the other sailor.  Three days after, both men were \"planked\" for coming off drunk.  They had been on shore drinking their bet beforehand.  Simple souls, they both came to me after punishment, to get my decision as to who should pay.  Their doctor, they thought, knew everything.  But very sadly were they put out, when I told them the bet could never be satisfactorily decided _in this world_.  \"Ah! doctor,\" said one, waggishly, \"it's a jolly good thing we drank the bet beforehand.\"  Black Tom's queen is usually a very lively lady, and up to any amount of fun and mischief.  _Merits_.--For house-hunting they are the _best_ cats you can have. They are very beautiful and graceful; and, indeed, a well-bred, well-trained black Tom is a veritable prince of the feline race.  The finest cat of this sort I ever saw was at Glasgow Show, \"Le Diable\" to name.  He _was_ a beauty.  What attitudes he did!  What grace in every movement! and such a colour and coat and eye!  I forget now who owned him, but I remember I gave him first prize after only one glance at the others.  Black cats are not so easily seen at night, and their hearing is extremely keen; so, likewise, is their eyesight.  As a rule, they kill rats and mice more for sport than anything else, and are fonder of tackling larger game.  In the field, however, their colour is against them, and makes them a good mark for the keeper's gun.  I prefer seeing black Tom in the parlour, or on a hosier's counter, or coiled up in a draper's window.  _Points_.--1.  _Size_: You want them large--as large an possible, and with great grace of motion. 2.  _Head_: The head is medium-sized, and not too bullety; a sharp nose, however, is an abomination in a black cat.  The ears must be rather longish, and shapely, and well-feathered internally, and set _straight_ on. 3.  _Eyes_: A brown eye is best, next best is hazel, which in turn is better than green, but green is better than yellow. 4.  _Colour_: All black; not even a toe must be white, nor _one hair of the whiskers_. 5.  _Pelage_: A beautiful, soft, though not too fine, fur, and inclining rather to length than otherwise, and as sheeny as a boatman beetle.

I have been asked to give a few hints as to the best and most useful classification for show purposes, and may as well do so here.  For a large show, the classes can hardly be better arranged than they are in the Crystal Palace catalogue, or that of the Edinburgh or Glasgow Shows. For smaller shows I beg to suggest the following:--  ONE.  Long-haired cats, any colour, male or female.  TWO.  Short-haired black and black-"]]]
