FLIGHT DENSITIES AND THEIR DETERMINATION   A. LUNAR OBSERVATIONS OF BIRDS AND THE FLIGHT DENSITY CONCEPT  The subject matter of this paper is wholly ornithological. It is written for the zoologist interested in the activities of birds. But its bases, the principles that make it possible, lie in other fields, including such rather advanced branches of mathematics as analytical geometry, spherical geometry, and differential calculus. No exhaustive exposition of the problem is practicable, that does not take for granted some previous knowledge of these disciplines on the part of all readers.  There are, however, several levels of understanding. It is possible to appreciate _what_ is being done without knowing _how_ to do it; and it is possible to learn how to carry out the successive steps of a procedure without entirely comprehending _why_. Some familiarity with the concepts underlying the method is essential to a full understanding of the results achieved, and details of procedure must be made generally available if the full possibilities of the telescopic approach are to be realized. Without going into proof of underlying propositions or actual derivation of formulae, I shall accordingly present a discussion of the general nature of the problem, conveyed as much as possible in terms of physical visualization. The development begins with the impressions of the student when he first attempts to investigate the movements of birds by means of the moon.   _What the Observer Sees_  Watched through a 20-power telescope on a cloudless night, the full moon shines like a giant plaster hemisphere caught in the full glare of a floodlight. Inequalities of surface, the rims of its craters, the tips of its peaks, gleam with an almost incandescent whiteness; and even the darker areas, the so-called lunar seas, pale to a clear, glowing gray.  Against this brilliant background, most birds passing in focus appear as coal-black miniatures, only 1/10 to 1/30 the apparent diameter of the moon. Small as these silhouettes are, details of form are often beautifully defined--the proportions of the body, the shape of the tail, the beat of the wings. Even when the images are so far away that they are pin-pointed as mere flecks of black against the illuminated area, the normal eye can follow their progress easily. In most cases the birds are invisible until the moment they \"enter,\" or pass opposite, the rim of the moon and vanish the instant they reach the other side. The interval between is likely to be inestimably brief. Some birds seem fairly to flash by; others, to drift; yet seldom can their passing be counted in seconds, or even in measureable fractions of seconds. During these short glimpses, the flight paths tend to lie along straight lines, though occasionally a bird may be seen to undulate or even to veer off course.  Now and again, in contrast to this typical picture, more eerie effects may be noted. Some of them are quite startling--a minute, inanimate-looking object drifting passively by like a corpuscle seen in the field of a microscope; a gigantic wing brushing across half the moon; a ghost-like suggestion of a bird so transparent it seems scarcely more than a product of the imagination; a bird that pauses in mid-flight to hang suspended in the sky; another that beats its way ineffectually forward while it moves steadily to the side; and flight paths that sweep across the vision in astonishingly geometric curves. All of these things have an explanation. The \"corpuscle\" is possibly a physical entity of some sort floating in the fluid of the observer's eye and projected into visibility against the whiteness of the moon. The winged transparency may be an insect unconsciously picked up by the unemployed eye and transferred by the _camera lucida_ principle to the field of the telescope. It may be a bird flying very close, so drastically out of focus that the observer sees right through it, as he would through a pencil held against his nose. The same cause, operating less effectively, gives a characteristic gray appearance with hazy edges to silhouettes passing just beneath the limits of sharp focus. Focal distortions doubtless also account for the precise curvature of some flight paths, for this peculiarity is seldom associated with distinct images. Suspended flight and contradictory directions of drift may sometimes be attributable to head winds or cross winds but more often are simply illusions growing out of a two-dimensional impression of a three-dimensional reality.  Somewhat more commonplace are the changes that accompany clouds. The moon can be seen through a light haze and at times remains so clearly visible that the overcast appears to be behind, instead of in front of, it. Under these circumstances, birds can still be readily discerned. Light reflected from the clouds may cause the silhouettes to fade somewhat, but they retain sufficient definition to distinguish them from out-of-focus images. On occasion, when white cloud banks lie at a favorable level, they themselves provide a backdrop against which birds can be followed all the way across the field of the telescope, whether or not they directly traverse the main area of illumination.   _Types of Data Obtained_  The nature of the observations just described imposes certain limitations on the studies that can be made by means of the moon. The speed of the birds, for instance, is utterly beyond computation in any manner yet devised. Not only is the interval of visibility extremely short, but the rapidity with which the birds go by depends less on their real rate of motion than on their proximity to the observer. The identification of species taking part in the migration might appear to offer more promise, especially since some of the early students of the problem frequently attempted it, but there are so many deceptive elements to contend with that the results cannot be relied upon in any significant number of cases. Shorn of their bills by the diminution of image, foreshortened into unfamiliar shape by varying angles of perspective, and glimpsed for an instant only, large species at distant heights may closely resemble small species a few hundred feet away. A sandpiper may appear as large as a duck; or a hawk, as small as a sparrow. A goatsucker may be confused with a swallow, and a swallow may pass as a tern. Bats, however, can be consistently recognized, if clearly seen, by their tailless appearance and the forward tilt of their wings, as well as by their erratic flight. And separations of nocturnal migrants into broad categories, such as seabirds and passerine birds, are often both useful and feasible.  It would be a wonderful convenience to be able to clock the speed of night-flying birds accurately and to classify them specifically, but neither of these things is indispensable to the general study of nocturnal migration, nor as important as the three kinds of basic data that _are_ provided by telescopes directed at the moon. These concern:--(1) the direction in which the birds are traveling; (2) their altitude above the earth; (3) the number per unit of space passing the observation station.  Unfortunately none of these things can be perceived directly, except in a very haphazard manner. Direction is seen by the observer in terms of the slant of a bird's pathway across the face of the moon, and may be so recorded. But the meaning of every such slant in terms of its corresponding compass direction on the plane of the earth constantly changes with the position of the moon. Altitude is only vaguely revealed through a single telescope by the size and definition of images whose identity and consequent real dimensions are subject to serious misinterpretation, for reasons already explained. The number of birds per unit of space, seemingly the easiest of all the features of migration to ascertain, is actually the most difficult, requiring a prior knowledge of both direction and altitude. To understand why this is so, it will be necessary to consider carefully the true nature of the field of observation.   _The Changing Field of Observation_  Most of the observations used in this study were made in the week centering on the time of the full moon. During this period the lunar disc progresses from nearly round to round and back again with little change in essential aspect or apparent size. To the man behind the telescope, the passage of birds looks like a performance in two dimensions taking place in this area of seemingly constant diameter--not unlike the movement of insects scooting over a circle of paper on the ground. Actually, as an instant's reflection serves to show, the two situations are not at all the same. The insects are all moving in one plane. The birds only appear to do so. They may be flying at elevations of 500, 1000, or 2000 feet; and, though they give the illusion of crossing the same illuminated area, the actual breadth of the visible space is much greater at the higher, than at the lower, level. For this reason, other things being equal, birds nearby cross the moon much more swiftly than distant ones. The field of observation is not an area in the sky but a volume in space, bounded by the diverging field lines of the observer's vision. Specifically, it is an inverted cone with its base at the moon and its vertex at the telescope.  Since the distance from the moon to the earth does not vary a great deal, the full"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37894"],["title","A Quantitative Study of the Nocturnal Migration of Birds (#3)"],["body","of the Great Cone determined by the diameter of the moon and a point on the earth remain at all times fairly constant. Just what they are does not concern us here, except as regards the angle of the apex (roughly 1/2°), because obviously the effective field of observation is limited to that portion of the Great Cone below the maximum ceiling at which birds fly, a much smaller cone, which I shall refer to as the Cone of Observation (Figure 1).      [Illustration: FIG. 1. The field of observation, showing        its two-dimensional aspect as it appears to the observer and        its three-dimensional actuality. The breadth of the cone is        greatly exaggerated.]      [Illustration: FIG. 2. Method for determining the diameter        of the cone at any point. The angular diameter of the moon        may be expressed in radians, or, in other words, in terms of        lengths of arc equivalent to the radius of a circle. In the        diagram, the arc between C and E, being equivalent to the        radius CO, represents a radian. If we allow the arc between A        and B to be the diameter of the moon, it is by astronomical        calculation about .009 radian, or .009 CO. This ratio will        hold for any smaller circle inscribed about the center O;        that is, the arc between A´B´ equals .009 C´O. Thus the width        of the cone of observation at any point, expressed in degrees        of arc, is .009 of the axis of the cone up to that point. The        cone is so slender that the arc between A and B is        essentially equal to the chord AB. Exactly the same        consideration holds true for the smaller circle where the        chord A´B´ represents part of the flight ceiling.]  The problem of expressing the number of passing birds in terms of a definite quantity of space is fundamentally one of finding out the critical dimensions of this smaller cone. The diameter at any distance from the observer may be determined with enough accuracy for our purposes simply by multiplying the distance by .009, a convenient approximation of the diameter of the moon, expressed in radians (see Figure 2). One hundred feet away, it is approximately 11 inches; 1000 feet away, nine feet; at one mile, 48 feet; at two miles, 95 feet. Estimating the effective length of the field of observation presents more formidable difficulties, aggravated by the fact that the lunar base of the Great Cone does not remain stationary. The moon rises in the general direction of east and sets somewhere in the west, the exact points where it appears and disappears on the horizon varying somewhat throughout the year. As it drifts across the sky it carries the cone of observation with it like the slim beam of an immense searchlight slowly probing space. This situation is ideal for the purpose of obtaining a random sample of the number of birds flying out in the darkness, yet it involves great complications; for the size of the sample is never at two consecutive instants the same. The nearer the ever-moving great cone of the moon moves toward a vertical position, the nearer its intersection with the flight ceiling approaches the observer, shortening, therefore, the cone of observation (Figure 3). The effect on the number of birds seen is profound. In extreme instances it may completely reverse the meaning of counts. Under the conditions visualized in Figure 3, the field of observation at midnight is only one-fourth as large as the field of observation earlier in the evening. Thus the twenty-four birds seen from 7 to 8 P. M., represent not twice as many birds actually flying per unit of space as the twelve observed from 11:30 to 12:30 A. M., but only half the amount. Figure 4, based on observations at Ottumwa, Iowa, on the night of May 22-23, shows a similar effect graphically. Curve A represents the actual numbers of birds per hour seen; Curve B shows the same figures expressed as flight densities, that is, corrected to take into account the changing size of the field of observation. It will be noted that the trends are almost exactly opposite. While A descends, B rises, and _vice-versa_. In this case, inferences drawn from the unprocessed data lead to a complete misinterpretation of the real situation.      [Illustration: FIG. 3. Temporal change in the effective        size of the field of observation. The sample sections, A and        B, represent the theoretical densities of flight at 8:20 and        12:00 P. M., respectively. Though twice as many birds are        assumed to be in the air at midnight when the moon is on its        zenith (Z) as there were at the earlier hour, only half as        many are visible because of the decrease in size of the cone        of observation.]      [Illustration: FIG. 4. Migration at Ottumwa, Iowa, on the        night of May 22-23, 1948. Curve A is a graphic representation        of the actual numbers of birds seen hourly through the        telescope. Curve B represents the same figures corrected for        the variation in the size of the cone of observation. The        dissimilarity in the two curves illustrates the deceptive        nature of untreated telescopic counts.]  Nor does the moon suit our convenience by behaving night after night in the same way. On one date we may find it high in the sky between 9 and 10 P. M.; on another date, during the same interval of time, it may be near the horizon. Consequently, the size of the cone is different in each case, and the direct comparison of flights in the same hour on different dates is no more dependable than the misleading comparisons discussed in the preceding paragraph.  The changes in the size of the cone have been illustrated in Figure 3 as though the moon were traveling in a plane vertical to the earth's surface, as though it reached a point directly over the observer's head. In practice this least complicated condition seldom obtains in the regions concerned in this study. In most of the northern hemisphere, the path of the moon lies south of the observer so that the cone is tilted away from the vertical plane erected on the parallel of latitude where the observer is standing. In other words it never reaches the zenith, a point directly overhead. The farther north we go, the lower the moon drops toward the horizon and the more, therefore, the cone of observation leans away from us. Hence, at the same moment, stationed on the same meridian, two observers, one in the north and one in the south, will be looking into different effective volumes of space (Figure 5).      [Illustration: FIG. 5. Geographical variation in the size        of the cone of observation. The cones A and B represent the        effective fields of observation at two stations situated over        1,200 miles apart. The portions of the great cones included        here appear nearly parallel, but if extended far enough would        be found to have a common base on the moon. Because of the        continental scale of the drawing, the flight ceiling appears        as a curved surface, equidistant above each station. The        lines to the zenith appear to diverge, but they are both        perpendicular to the earth. Although the cones are shown at        the same instant in time, and have their origin on the same        meridian, the dimensions of B are less than one-half as great        as those of A, thus materially decreasing the opportunity to        see birds at the former station. This effect results from the        different slants at which the zenith distances cause the        cones to intersect the flight ceiling. The diagram        illustrates the principle that northern stations, on the        average, have a better chance to see birds passing in their        vicinity than do southern stations.]  As a further result of its inclination, the cone of observation, seldom affords an equal opportunity of recording birds that are flying in two different directions. This may be most easily understood by considering what happens on a single flight level. The plane parallel to the earth representing any such flight level intersects the slanting cone, not in a circle, but in an ellipse. The proportions of this ellipse are very variable. When the moon is high, the intersection on the plane is nearly circular; when the moon is low, the ellipse becomes greatly elongated. Often the long axis may be more than twice the length of the short axis. It follows that, if the long axis happens to lie athwart the northward direction of flight and the short axis across the eastward direction, we will get on the average over twice as large a sample of birds flying toward the north as of birds flying toward the east.  In summary, whether we wish to compare different stations, different hours of the night, or different directions during the same hour of the night, no conclusions regarding even the relative numbers of birds migrating are warranted, unless they take into account the ever-varying dimensions of the field of observation. Otherwise we are attempting to measure migration with a unit that is constantly expanding or contracting. Otherwise we may expect the same kind of meaningless results that we might obtain by combining measurements in millimeters with measurements in inches. Some method must be found by which we can reduce all data to a standard basis for comparison.   _The Directional Element in Sampling_  In seeking this end, we must immediately reject the simple logic of sampling that may be applied to density studies of animals on land. We must not assume that, since the field of observation is a volume in space, the number of birds therein can be directly expressed in terms of some standard volume--a cubic mile, let us say. Four birds counted in a cone of observation computed as 1/500 of a cubic mile are not the equivalent of 500 × 4, or 2000, birds per cubic mile. Nor do four birds flying over a sample 1/100 of a square mile mathematically represent 400 birds passing over the"]]]
