Jack Rabbit did try to cut the line, too, but he was so excited he dropped his knife overboard, and Mr. 'Coon couldn't find his, and Mr. 'Possum didn't have any. So there they were, and there was Mr. Dog! Then Mr. Rabbit tried to bite the line off with his teeth, but he couldn't do that, either, for it was a big, strong line that he'd made himself, specially for large fish.  And all the time they were getting closer and closer to the shore, and Mr. Dog had lifted his line out of the water so it wouldn't be in his way, and was sitting there waiting, and smiling to see them come.  Then Jack Rabbit knew that something had to be done, and there was no time to lose. He was just about as scared as he could be, but he knew it wouldn't do any good to let on, so he sat up straight and smiled some, too, and looked at Mr. Dog and called out, big and friendly like:--  \"Hello, Mr. Dog! Here we come! Here we come with a nice dinner, Mr. Dog!\"  Then Mr. Dog laughed and called back:--  \"That's right, Mr. Rabbit. There's a sure enough nice dinner coming this time! Fish for the first course, Mr. Rabbit!\"  When Mr. 'Possum heard that he began to groan, and Jack Rabbit and Mr. 'Coon began to shiver, for each thought he knew pretty well what the next courses of Mr. Dog's dinner would be. But Mr. Rabbit didn't stop smiling or let on that he knew, and he called out again to Mr. Dog, quick:--  \"You'll have to help us if we have fish, Mr. Dog! He's a big one and you'll have to help us catch him!\"  And Mr. Dog called back again:--  \"Don't worry, Mr. Rabbit! I won't leave! I'll be on hand when you get here, Mr. Rabbit!\"  Then he rolled up his trousers a little and waded out into the shallow water, thinking he would nab Mr. Fish first and drag him out on shore, and then pull the boat right in after him.  Of course, that was a pretty good plan for Mr. Dog, only like some other good plans, it didn't work just as he expected it to. You see, he didn't quite know how big the fish was, nor how hard a big fish is to handle in shallow water. He made a quick grab at it when it got to him and then, right away, he had his hands full of business. That fish gave a flop with his tail that laid Mr. Dog over on his back and then another flop that set him on his feet again, and a side flop that smacked him against the water first one way and then the other, and made him breathe hard and choke and try to let go.  But Mr. Dog couldn't let go, for he'd got the fish line some way tangled in his teeth. So he began to snap and paw and swallow water, and fall down and get up again, and sprawl about in the swamp grass, trying to get back to shore.  [Illustration: THE FIGHT BETWEEN MR. DOG AND THE BIG FISH]  And while all this was going on Jack Rabbit and his friends had jumped out into the shallow water and took a little roundin's to shore, keeping out of Mr. Dog's way, and made tracks for the top of a hill, where they would be out of danger and see the fun at the same time. Then they all stood up there and watched the fight between Mr. Dog and the big fish, and Jack Rabbit sang out, as loud as ever he could:--  \"Don't leave, Mr. Dog! Stay with him, Mr. Dog! Hold him to it, Mr. Dog; you've got him! First course, Mr. Dog!\"  And Mr. Dog heard Jack Rabbit and got madder and madder every minute, till all of a sudden he got a lick on the side of the head from Mr. Fish's tail that made him see stars and broke the line. And away went the big fish out into deep water, while Mr. Dog crawled back to shore, wet and bruised from head to foot, and 'most dead.  Then Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum and Jack Rabbit, standing on top of the hill, gave a great big laugh, all together, and Mr. Rabbit called out:--  \"How did you like the first course, Mr. Dog?\"  That made them all laugh again, and then Mr. 'Coon called out:--  \"Are you ready for the second course, Mr. Dog?\"  And pretty soon Mr. 'Possum he called out:--  \"Are you ready for a nice roast now, Mr. Dog?\"  And that, of course, made them all laugh very loud, for Mr. 'Possum used slang now and then and meant by a \"roast\" that people would all make fun of Mr. Dog wherever he went; which they did, for a long time.  Even Mr. Robin, who was good friends with Mr. Dog, couldn't help calling out to him, now and then, as he went by:--  \"Are you ready for the next course, Mr. Dog?\"  And Mr. Dog would pretend not to hear and go hurrying by very fast, as if he were out on special and important business for Mr. Man.  [Illustration: LEANING OVER TO LIGHT HIS PIPE FROM MR. 'POSSUM'S]     MR. RABBIT EXPLAINS  AN EASTER STORY   \"WHY do we always have rabbits at Easter?\" asked the Little Lady. \"Is that a story, too?\"  The Story Teller lit his pipe, thinking all the time, and pretty soon he said: \"Why, yes, there is a story about that, and it goes this way\":--  One afternoon in the early spring Mr. Jack Rabbit and his friends were out for an airing. The Hollow Tree people were along, and Mr. Turtle, as usual. By and by they came to a log under a big tree and sat down for a smoke and talk. They talked about the weather at first and other things, till somebody mentioned Easter. Then they all had something to say about that.  \"What I object to,\" says Mr. Rabbit, when it came his time to talk, \"is this thing of people always saying that the Easter eggs belong to me.\"  \"Oh, but that's just a joke,\" says Mr. 'Coon, laughing.  \"I know it's just a joke, of course, but it's a pretty old joke, and I'm tired of it,\" says Jack Rabbit.  \"How did it get started anyway?\" asked Mr. 'Possum.  Then Mr. Rabbit took his pipe out of his mouth and leaned forward a little, so he could talk better.  \"I tell you how it got started,\" he says, \"and after that I don't want to hear any more of it. This is how it happened:--  [Illustration: THEY CAME TO A LOG UNDER A BIG TREE AND SAT DOWN FOR A SMOKE AND TALK]  \"Once upon a time, as much as twenty grandmothers back, I should think, there was a very nice family of Rabbits that lived in a grassy place on a hillside back of a big farmyard. There was quite a hole in the ground there, and they had a cozy home in it, and a soft bed for their little folk.  \"Now, every bright morning, Father and Mother Rabbit used to take the children out for a walk, and for a few lessons in running and hiding from Mr. Dog, who bothered about a good deal, and one day as they were coming home they heard a great cackling, and when they got to their house there was a nice fresh egg lying right in the children's bed. Some old hen from the farmyard had slipped in and laid it while they were gone. A good many hens, especially old hens, like to hide their nests that way, and this was one of that kind.  \"Well, of course all the young Rabbits claimed it, and Mother Rabbit at last gave it to the smallest and weakest one of the children, a little girl, who was always painting things with the juice of flower petals. And the very first thing that little girl did was to stain that egg all over with violet juice, not thinking what trouble it was going to cause our family forever after.  [Illustration: THEY HAD A COZY HOME AND A SOFT BED FOR THEIR LITTLE FOLK]  \"It was a nice blue egg when she got through with it, and the next day, when they all came back from their walk again there was another white egg right by it. The old hen had been there again and laid another while they were gone. The second little girl claimed that egg, of course, and she painted it a bright yellow with buttercup juice. Then the next day there was another egg, and the next day there was another egg, and the next day there was another egg, until there was one apiece for every one of the children, and some over.  \"And they all painted them. Some painted theirs pink or red with rose leaves or japonica, some painted them yellow with buttercups, and some blue or purple with violets, as the first little girl had done. They had so many at last that it crowded them out of their bed and they had to sleep on the floor.  [Illustration: A FEW LESSONS IN RUNNING AND HIDING]  \"And then, one Sunday, and it must have been Easter Sunday, they all went out walking again, and when they came back every one of those beautiful colored eggs was gone. The children cried and made a great fuss, but it was no use. Some of Mr. Man's boys out hunting hens' nests had found them and taken them all home with them.  \"And of course all those colored eggs set Mr. Man to wondering, and he came with his boys to the place where they had found them; and when they looked in out jumped the whole Rabbit family, helter skelter in every direction.  \"And right then,\" said Mr. Rabbit, leaning over to light his pipe from Mr. 'Possum's, \"right then Mr. Man declared those colored eggs were rabbit eggs, and he's kept on saying so ever since, though he knows better, and he knows I don't like it. He takes eggs and colors them himself now, and makes believe they're mine, and he puts my picture all over things about Easter time. I suppose he thinks I don't care, but I do, and I wish that little Miss Rabbit twenty grandmothers back had left that old hen's egg white as she found it.\"  [Illustration: IT WAS A NICE BLUE EGG WHEN SHE GOT THROUGH WITH IT]  \"It's too bad,\" says Mr. Crow. \"It's like that story they tell about the fox making me drop the cheese.\"  \"Or like Mr. Man making believe that the combs he uses are really made out of my shell,\" says Mr. Turtle.  Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum shook their heads. They had their troubles, too.     THE HOLLOW TREE POETRY CLUB  HOW MR. DOG CAME TO A POETRY CLUB, AND WHAT HAPPENED   ONCE upon a time, when it was getting along toward fall in the Hollow Tree, when Jack Rabbit and Mr. Robin and the others had come to live with the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow, there began to be long evenings, and the Hollow Tree people used to think of new ways to pass the time. They tried"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37363"],["title","Making Up with Mr. Dog (#3)"],["body","at first, and sleight-of-hand tricks. Then they tried doing things, and Mr. Turtle carried them all together twice around the big parlor room on his back. But even that wasn't so funny after the first evening, and Mr. Crow, who did most of the thinking, had to scratch his head and think pretty hard what to do next.  All at once he happened to remember that Jack Rabbit, who was the big man of the party, was also a first rate poet, and liked to read his own poetry better than anything. So, when he thought of that, he said:--  \"I'll tell you. We'll have a poetry club.\"  And of course that made Mr. Rabbit wake up right away.  \"What's that?\" he said. \"What kind of a thing is a poetry club?\"  \"Why,\" said Mr. Crow, \"it's a place where the members each write a poem and read it at the next meeting. You're the only real, sure enough poet, of course, and will be president, and write the best poem, but the rest of us can try, and you can tell us our mistakes. I've heard that Mr. Man has clubs, and they're ever so much fun.\"  [Illustration: HAD TO SCRATCH HIS HEAD AND THINK PRETTY HARD]  Jack Rabbit thought so, too, and all the others liked the plan. So they elected Mr. Rabbit president and then went to work on their poems. They couldn't have the first meeting very soon, for it took longer to write poems in those days than it does now, so before they got half ready the news got out some way, and even Mr. Dog had heard of it.  Poor Mr. Dog! It made him really quite ill to think he wasn't on very good terms with the Hollow Tree people, for he thought he could write pretty nice poetry, too, and he wanted to belong to that club worse than anything he could think of. He wanted to so bad that at last he told Mr. Robin that if they'd just let him come he'd promise anything they asked.  [Illustration: POOR MR. DOG]  They didn't want to let him, though, until Mr. Crow, who always felt kind of sorry for Mr. Dog, said he didn't see why Mr. Dog shouldn't come and look in through the window shutters, and that they could nail a seat for him on a limb just outside. They could pull him up to it with a rope and he could sit there and listen and applaud the poems all through without being able to do any damage to the poets, and he would be glad enough to be let down by the time they got done reciting.  So they sent him an invitation, and Mr. Dog was as happy as a king. He went right to work on his poem, and he worked all night and walked up and down the yard all day trying to think up rhymes for \"joyful\" and \"meeting,\" and a lot of other nice words. Even when he was asleep he dreamed about it, and said over some of the lines out loud and jerked his paws about as if he were reciting it and making motions. You see, Mr. Dog hadn't always done just right by the Hollow Tree people, and he was anxious to make a good impression and fix up things. He fixed himself all up, too, when the night came for the meeting, and took his poem under his arm and lit a cigar that he'd borrowed of Mr. Man for the occasion, and away he went.  The Hollow Tree people were on the look-out for him and had the rope down and ready. So Mr. Dog tied it around under his arms, and they pulled and pulled, and up he came. Then, when he got pretty close to the window, they closed the shutter and put the rope through and pulled him up still a little higher, so that he could reach the seat on the limb, which was fixed just right for him to sit there and lean on the window sill while he listened and looked in.  Of course, Mr. Dog wished he was inside, like the others, but he knew why he wasn't, and he was glad enough to be there at all. He peeked through the slats at the big room and smiled and said some nice things about how pretty the room looked, till they all got real sociable with him. Then Jack Rabbit called the meeting to order and made a few remarks.  He said the duties of his office had kept him from writing quite as long and as good a poem as he would have liked to write, but that he hoped they might be willing to hear what he had done. Then they all shouted, \"Yes, yes!\" and \"Hear, hear!\" and Mr. Rabbit bowed first to the ones inside and then to Mr. Dog outside, and began:--   THE JOYS OF POETRY  BY J. RABBIT          Oh, sweet the joys of poetry            In the merry days of spring,         When the dew is on the meadow            And the duck is on the wing!         For 'tis then, from Dan to Dover,            I'm a rover 'mid the clover,         Seeking rhymes the country over            With a ring, sing, swing--            With a ding, dong, ding,            And a ting a ling a ling--         For I'm the rhyming rover of the spring.          Oh, sweet the joys of poetry            In the pleasant summer time!         For 'tis then I have no trouble            To compose my gentle rhyme;         In a nooklet by the brooklet         I can think up quite a booklet,         As with fishing line and hooklet            I assist the fish to climb            To the music of my chime,            For with rollick and with rhyme         I'm the poet of the pleasant summer time.  [Illustration: MR. RABBIT BOWED]          Oh, sweet the joys of poetry            When any days have come,         When the autumn zephyrs whisper            Or the winter breezes hum!         For 'tis then my thoughts unfurling,         While the smoke goes upward curling,         Come a whirling, swirling, twirling,            With a rumty, tumty, tum,         Come a twirling, swirling, whirling,            Like a rattle of a drum.         Come a whirling, come a swirling;            For in spring or in the summer,            In the autumn or the winter            I'm the rumty, tumty, tummer         That rejoices in the seasons as they come.  Well, when Mr. Rabbit got through everybody sat still for a minute, till Mr. Dog called out for somebody to come and unwind him so he could get his breath again. Then they all commenced to laugh and shout and pound on the table. And Mr. Rabbit coughed and looked pleased and said it was easy enough to do when you knew how.  Then Mr. 'Possum, who was next on the program, said he hoped they'd let him off this time because he could only think of four lines, and that he was a better hand at the dinner table than he was at poetry, anyway. But they wouldn't do it, so he got up and looked foolish and swallowed two or three times before he could get started.   WHAT I LOVE  BY A. PUFFINGTON 'POSSUM          I love the fragrant chicken pie           That blooms in early spring;         I love a chicken stew or fry,           Or any old thing.  Mr. 'Possum's poem was short, but it went right to the spot, and the way they applauded almost made Jack Rabbit jealous. He said that it was 'most too true to be good poetry, but that it was good for a first effort, and that being short helped it. Then Mr. Robin spoke his piece:--   MOTHER AND ME  BY C. ROBIN          When the bud breaks out on the maple bough          Mother and me we build our nest--         A twig from the yard and a wisp from the mow           And four blue eggs 'neath the mother breast.         Up in the tree, mother and me,         Happy and blithe and contented are we.          When the daisies fall and the roses die,           An empty nest in the boughs to swing--         Four young robins that learn to fly           And a sweet adieu till another spring.         Then up in the tree, mother and me,         Happy once more and contented we'll be.  The applause wasn't so loud after Mr. Robin's poem, but they all said it was very pretty, and Mr. 'Possum even wiped his eyes with his handkerchief, because it made him remember something sad. Mr. Rabbit said that it ought to be \"Mother and I,\" but that it didn't make much difference, he supposed, about grammar, so long as it rhymed and sounded nice. Then Mr. Crow got up.  [Illustration: LOOKED FOOLISH AND SWALLOWED TWO OR THREE TIMES]   JUST NOTHING  BY J. CROW          While others may sing of the pleasures of spring,           Or winter or summer or fall,         I'll sing not of these, because, if you please,           I'll sing of just nothing at all.         Just nothing at all, because, oh, ho!         I'll sing of myself, an old black crow.          As black as a coal and as homely as sin--           What more can I tell you, I pray?         For when you have nothing to sing of, why, then,           Of course there is nothing to say.         Nothing to say at all, oh, ho!         Except good-by to the old black crow--         The rollicking old black crow!  They made a good deal of fuss over Mr. Crow's poem. They applauded, of course, but they said it wasn't so at all, and that Mr. Crow was a good deal more than \"just nothing.\" They said that it was he who had got up this party, and that he was the best man to plan and cook anywhere. Mr. 'Possum said he even liked Mr. Crow's April fool chicken pies, and then they all remembered and laughed, even to Mr. Crow himself. After that it was Mr. Squirrel's turn. Mr. Squirrel coughed twice and straightened his vest before he began, so they knew his poem wasn't to be funny.   THE FOOLISH LITTLE LAD  BY MR. GRAY SQUIRREL          Once on a time, the story goes,           A silly squirrel lad         One summer day did run away--           Which made his ma feel bad.          She hunted for him up and down           And round and round she ran--         Alas, that foolish squirrel boy           Was caught by Mr. Man.          For he had tried to climb a tree           As Mr. Man came past.         \"I'll make you climb!\" said Mr. Man,           And walked home pretty fast.          When he got there a boy came out           As Mr. Man went in.         That silly squirrel soon was put           Into a house of tin.          \"Now you can climb!\" said Mr. Man,           But when he did he found         That nice tin house, so bright and new,           Turned round and round and round.          And there he climbs"]]]
