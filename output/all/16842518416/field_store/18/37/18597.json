All knew that it was over; and Lady St Julians, giving up her quadrille, began to look about for seats in parliament for her sons.  “What a happiness it is to have a clever mother,” exclaimed Egremont, as he pondered over the returns of his election agent. Lady Marney, duly warned of the impending catastrophe, was experiencing all the advantages of prior information. It delighted her to meet Lady St Julians driving distractedly about town, calling at clubs, closeted with red tapers, making ingenious combinations that would not work, by means of which some one of her sons was to stand in coalition with some rich parvenu; to pay none of the expenses and yet to come in first. And all this time, Lady Marney, serene and smiling, had the daily pleasure of assuring Lady St Julians what a relief it was to her that Charles had fixed on his place. It had been arranged indeed these weeks past; “but then, you know,” concluded Lady Marney in the sweetest voice and with a blandishing glance, “I never did believe in that hay fever.”  In the meantime the impending event changed the whole aspect of the political world. The king dying before the new registration was the greatest blow to pseudo-toryism since his majesty, calling for a hackney coach, went down and dissolved parliament in 1831. It was calculated by the Tadpoles and Tapers that a dissolution by Sir Robert, after the registration of 1837, would give him a clear majority, not too great a one, but large enough: a manageable majority; some five-and-twenty or thirty men, who with a probable peerage or two dangling in the distance, half-a-dozen positive baronetcies, the Customs for their constituents, and Court balls for their wives, might be induced to save the state. 0! England, glorious and ancient realm, the fortunes of thy polity are indeed strange! The wisdom of the Saxons, Norman valour, the state-craft of the Tudors, the national sympathies of the Stuarts, the spirit of the latter Guelphs struggling against their enslaved sovereignty,--these are the high qualities, that for a thousand years have secured thy national developement. And now all thy memorial dynasties end in the huckstering rule of some thirty unknown and anonymous jobbers! The Thirty at Athens were at least tyrants. They were marked men. But the obscure majority, who under our present constitution are destined to govern England, are as secret as a Venetian conclave. Yet on their dark voices all depends. Would you promote or prevent some great measure that may affect the destinies of unborn millions, and the future character of the people,--take, for example, a system of national education,--the minister must apportion the plunder to the illiterate clan; the scum that floats on the surface of a party; or hold out the prospect of honours, which are only honourable when in their transmission they impart and receive lustre; when they are the meed of public virtue and public services, and the distinction of worth and of genius. It is impossible that the system of the thirty can long endure in an age of inquiry and agitated spirit like the present. Such a system may suit the balanced interests and the periodical and alternate command of rival oligarchical connections: but it can subsist only by the subordination of the sovereign and the degradation of the multitude; and cannot accord with an age, whose genius will soon confess that Power and the People are both divine.  “He can’t last ten days,” said a whig secretary of the treasury with a triumphant glance at Mr Taper as they met in Pall Mall; “You’re out for our lives.”  “Don’t you make too sure for yourselves,” rejoined in despair the dismayed Taper. “It does not follow that because we are out, that you are in.”  “How do you mean?”  “There is such a person as Lord Durham in the world,” said Mr Taper very solemnly.  “Pish,” said the secretary.  “You may pish,” said Mr Taper, “but if we have a radical government, as I believe and hope, they will not be able to get up the steam as they did in --31; and what with church and corn together, and the Queen Dowager, we may go to the country with as good a cry as some other persons.”  “I will back Melbourne against the field, now,” said the secretary.  “Lord Durham dined at Kensington on Thursday,” said Taper, “and not a whig present.”  “Ay; Durham talks very fine at dinner,” said the secretary, “but he has no real go in him. When there is a Prince of Wales, Lord Melbourne means to make Durham governor to the heir apparent, and that will keep him quiet.”  “What do you hear?” said Mr Tadpole, joining them; “I am told he has quite rallied.”  “Don’t you flatter yourself,” said the secretary.  “Well, we shall hear what they say on the hustings,” said Tadpole looking boldly.  “Who’s afraid!” said the secretary. “No, no, my dear fellow, you are dead beat; the stake is worth playing for, and don’t suppose we are such flats as to lose the race for want of jockeying. Your humbugging registration will never do against a new reign. Our great men mean to shell out, I tell you; we have got Croucher; we will denounce the Carlton and corruption all over the kingdom; and if that won’t do, we will swear till we are black in the face, that the King of Hanover is engaged in a plot to dethrone our young Queen:” and the triumphant secretary wished the worthy pair good morning.  “They certainly have a very good cry,” said Taper mournfully.  “After all, the registration might be better,” said Tadpole, “but still it is a very good one.”  The daily bulletins became more significant; the crisis was evidently at hand. A dissolution of parliament at any time must occasion great excitement; combined with a new reign, it inflames the passions of every class of the community. Even the poor begin to hope; the old, wholesome superstition still lingers, that the sovereign can exercise power; and the suffering multitude are fain to believe that its remedial character may be about to be revealed in their instance. As for the aristocracy in a new reign, they are all in a flutter. A bewildering vision of coronets, stars, and ribbons; smiles, and places at court; haunts their noontide speculations and their midnight dreams. Then we must not forget the numberless instances in which the coming event is deemed to supply the long-sought opportunity of distinction, or the long-dreaded cause of utter discomfiture; the hundreds, the thousands, who mean to get into parliament, the units who dread getting out. What a crashing change from lounging in St James’s street to sauntering on Boulogne pier; or, after dining at Brookes and supping at Crockford’s, to be saved from destruction by the friendly interposition that sends you in an official capacity to the marsupial sympathies of Sydney or Swan River!  Now is the time for the men to come forward who have claims; claims for spending their money, which nobody asked them to do, but which of course they only did for the sake of the party. They never wrote for their party, or spoke for their party, or gave their party any other vote than their own; but they urge their claims,--to something; a commissionership of anything, or a consulship anywhere; if no place to be had, they are ready to take it out in dignities. They once looked to the privy council, but would now be content with an hereditary honour; if they can have neither, they will take a clerkship in the Treasury for a younger son. Perhaps they may get that in time; at present they go away growling with a gaugership; or, having with desperate dexterity at length contrived to transform a tidewaiter into a landwaiter. But there is nothing like asking--except refusing.  Hark! it tolls! All is over. The great bell of the metropolitan cathedral announces the death of the last son of George the Third who probably will ever reign in England. He was a good man: with feelings and sympathies; deficient in culture rather than ability; with a sense of duty; and with something of the conception of what should be the character of an English monarch. Peace to his manes! We are summoned to a different scene.  In a palace in a garden--not in a haughty keep, proud with the fame, but dark with the violence of ages; not in a regal pile, bright with the splendour, but soiled with the intrigues, of courts and factions--in a palace in a garden, meet scene for youth, and innocence, and beauty--came the voice that told the maiden she must ascend her throne!  The council of England is summoned for the first time within her bowers. There are assembled the prelates and captains and chief men of her realm; the priests of the religion that consoles, the heroes of the sword that has conquered, the votaries of the craft that has decided the fate of empires; men grey with thought, and fame, and age; who are the stewards of divine mysteries, who have encountered in battle the hosts of Europe, who have toiled in secret cabinets, who have struggled in the less merciful strife of aspiring senates; men too, some of them, lords of a thousand vassals and chief proprietors of provinces, yet not one of them whose heart does not at this moment tremble as he awaits the first presence of the maiden who must now ascend her throne.  A hum of half-suppressed conversation which would attempt to conceal the excitement, which some of the greatest of them have since acknowledged, fills that brilliant assemblage; that sea of plumes, and glittering stars, and gorgeous dresses. Hush! the portals open; She comes! The silence is as deep as that of a noontide forest. Attended for a moment by her royal mother and the ladies of her court, who bow and then retire, VICTORIA ascends her throne; a girl, alone, and for the first time, amid an assemblage of men.  In a sweet and thrilling voice, and with a composed mien which indicates rather the absorbing sense of august duty than an absence of emotion, THE "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37600"],["title","The Fight for Constantinople: A Story of the Gallipoli Peninsula (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Cover art]      [Frontispiece: \"FLOATING SERENELY ON THE SURFACE WAS A SUBMARINE; ONE OF THE MOST MODERN OF THE GERMAN _UNTERSEEBOOTEN_\"]      The Fight for Constantinople  A Story of the Gallipoli Peninsula    BY  PERCY F.

I suppose I ought to call it your appointment.  It's to the _Hammerer_.  Why, my boy, you don't look very happy about it: what's up?\"  \"Nothing much, pater,\" replied the Sub, as he strove to conceal the shade of disappointment that flitted over his features.  \"I must take whatever is given me without demur----\"  \"Of course,\" promptly interposed his parent.  \"That's duty all the world over.\"  \"But at the same time I had hoped to get something, well--something not altogether approaching the scrap-iron stage.\"  \"Yes, the _Hammerer_ is a fairly old craft, I'll admit,\" said Colonel Crosthwaite.  \"I've just looked her up in Brassey's----\"  \"Launched in 1895, completed during the following year; of 14,900 tons; has a principal armament of four 12-inch guns, and a secondary battery of twelve 6-inch,\" added Dick, who had the details of most vessels of H.M. Navy and many foreign Powers at his fingers' ends.  \"She's a weatherly old craft, but it isn't likely she'll take part in an action with the German High Seas Fleet, when it does come out of the Kiel Canal.  Things are fairly quiet in the North Sea, except for a few isolated destroyer actions, and, of course, the _Blücher_ business. Aboard the _Hammerer_--one of the last line of defence--the chance of smelling powder will be a rotten one.\"  \"In the opinion of those in authority, Dick, these ships are wanted, and officers and men must be found to man them.  Everyone cannot be in the firing-line.\"  \"I'm not grumbling exactly,\" explained Dick.  \"Only----\"  \"Grumbling just a little,\" added his father.  \"Well, my boy, you may get your chance yet.  War was ever a strange thing for placing unknowns in the limelight, and this war in particular.  Now buck up and get your kit together.  It will mean an all-night railway journey, since you've to join your ship at Portsmouth at 9 a.m. to-morrow.\"  Dick Crosthwaite was on ten days' leave, after \"paying off\" the old _Seasprite_.  The outbreak of war had been responsible for his fairly rapid promotion, and having put in seven months as a midshipman on board the light cruiser _Seasprite_--which had been engaged in patrol work in the North Sea--he found himself promoted to Acting Sub-lieutenant.  His work on the cruiser was, in spite of the dreary and bleak climatic conditions, interesting and not devoid of incident.  He had not taken part in any action; his ship had escaped the attentions of hostile submarines and drifting mines.  There was a spice of risk about the business that appealed to him--a possibility that before long the _Seasprite_ would have a chance of using her guns in real earnest.  Then came orders for the light cruiser to proceed to Greenock and \"pay off\".  Her ship's company were given leave, which after months of strenuous watch and ward they thoroughly deserved, and Sub-lieutenant Crosthwaite found himself once more in his home in a secluded part of Shropshire.  Although he fully appreciated the brief spell of leisure, his active mind was dwelling upon the prospects in store for him.  With the certificates he had gained he considered, with all due respect for My Lords' discretion, that nothing short of an appointment on one of the super-Dreadnoughts or battle-cruisers would be a fitting reward for his zeal and activity.  Hence it came as a decided set-back when he found himself appointed to the old _Hammerer._  He knew the obsolescent battleship both by observation and repute.  He had seen her lying in one of the basins of the dockyard extensions at Portsmouth, looking the picture of neglect in her garb of grey mottled with the stains of rusty iron.  He had also seen a painting of her when she was in her prime.  That painting was an object of value to his uncle, Captain John Crosthwaite, R.N., for he had hoisted his pennant on the _Hammerer_ when she was the pride of the then Channel Fleet.  With her black hull, white upper works, and buff-coloured masts and funnels, she looked a totally different vessel from the grey monster that was on the point of being sent to the scrap-heap.  For twenty years she had existed without having fired a shot in anger; now on the eve of her career she was to be given a chance--a very faint chance, Dick thought--of doing her part against the enemies of King and country.  That same evening Sub-lieutenant Crosthwaite bade his mother and sisters good-bye, and, accompanied by the Colonel and Dick's two young brothers, drove to the station.  \"Au revoir, Dick!\" exclaimed his brother George, with all the dignity of a public-school boy of fourteen.  \"And don't forget to bring us home some war trophies,\" added twelve-year-old Peter.  Dick laughingly assented, then grasped his father's hand.  \"Good-bye, Dad,\" he said.  \"Good-bye, my lad; and don't forget to do your level best and keep our end up.  It's no use mincing matters: we've a tough, uphill job. Good-bye, my lad; and may God bless you!\"  Conscious that several pairs of eyes were upon them, father and son drew themselves up and saluted.  Dick entered the train and was whirled away, while Colonel Crosthwaite returned home for a brief twelve hours before he, too, would be on his way to his regiment--a promising unit of Kitchener's Army.  At half-past eight on the following morning Dick passed through the main gate of Portsmouth Dockyard.  Seamen and dockyard \"maties\" were everywhere, working with the utmost activity--for here at least there was no slacking.  Wagon-loads of stores came bounding along over the hard granite setts, drawn by stalwart bluejackets in working kit; no longer, as in the old piping times of peace, did the dockyard workmen amble quietly with their work.  Everything was done at the double.  It was a sign of the times, when the stress and strain of naval warfare requires promptness and activity.  Under the ruined buildings that formerly were surmounted by the semaphore tower--ruins that suggested the scene of a German raid--the Sub made his way to the South Railway Jetty, alongside of which was moored H.M.S. _Hammerer_, almost ready to proceed to sea.  In her new garb of neutral-grey the old ship looked smart and business-like.  In each of her two barbettes a pair of re-lined 12-inch guns grinned menacingly.  Her brasswork no longer glittered in the sunlight: it had been daubed over with the same hue of neutral paint. The only dashes of colour about her were the blue-and-gold uniforms of the officers, for she showed no flag.  It was yet too soon for the time-honoured custom of hoisting the white ensign with full naval honours.  Having duly reported himself, Dick was informed that he was to be in charge of the gun-room--the cradle of budding Nelsons, for the _Hammerer_ carried twelve midshipmen in addition to a clerk and two assistant clerks.  For the next three days the Sub had hardly a minute to call his own. It was a hasty, yet complete, commissioning, nothing being overlooked in the matter of detail; and during those three days the ship's company did a normal week's work.  Meals had to be hurriedly snatched.  Even the usual formal dinner had to be scrambled through, with grave danger to the digestions of the youthful officers.  What with coaling, shipping ammunition and stores, and generally \"shaking down\", Dick was glad to tumble into his bunk and sleep the sleep of healthy exhaustion, until aroused by his servant announcing that it was time to begin another day's arduous duty.  At length the _Hammerer_ was ready to sail to her unknown destination; for it was an understood thing that she was to proceed under sealed orders.  The Captain and most of the officers on duty were on the fore-bridge. Aft mustered the marine guard and the band, while the stanchion rails and gun-ports were packed with seamen in their white working-rig.  On the jetty were the dockyard Staff-captain's men, ready at the word of command to slip \"springs\" and hawsers; but the usual setting of the picture of a departing man-of-war was absent.  No throng of relatives and friends of the crew gathered on the farewell jetty.  The time of departure was a secret.  In war-time the great silent navy is shown to perfection; and no crowd of civilians is permitted to"]]]
