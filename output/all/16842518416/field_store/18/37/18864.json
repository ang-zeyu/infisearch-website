EXNING, AUGUST 10, 1796.     PREFACE.   When an author lays his book before the public, unless it be a work of genius, some account of his motives for so doing is generally expected. As this is a work that pretends to nothing but authenticity, and to be a plain relation of facts, I shall only premise, that, placed in a situation which gave me an opportunity of being witness to most of the principal transactions of the expedition under Sir CHARLES GREY and Sir JOHN JERVIS in the West Indies, and having leisure and inclination to minute down the occurrences as they presented themselves, I venture to appear before the public with such humble pretensions alone, as the result of that opportunity and leisure can give me.  My original intention reached no further than to publish a few views of some interesting subjects, which abound in the Caraibean Islands; but I selected those only which were rendered most so by particular events. Though I pretend not to the powers of an artist (being self-taught), yet I beg leave to urge in excuse for that want of spirit and picturesque effect which, I fear, is but too apparent in my drawings, that they are scrupulously exact, and accurately delineate the subjects they profess to represent.  When I at first communicated my design of publishing a few drawings, taken during the West India Expedition, many of my friends, and some of the officers who served with me, knowing that I had kept a journal of the transactions, desired me to add a short account of them to accompany the engravings.  To those, at all conversant with writing such accounts, it will not appear strange, that, as I proceeded to retrace those events which form the most prominent feature of my life, I found a pleasure in recognising many a transaction that had almost faded from my memory, and by degrees it increased under my hand, till it became of size sufficient to form a volume, and I was enabled to lay it before the public in a more respectable form than I at first intended. But, that I may not appropriate to myself merit belonging to another, I take a pleasure in avowing, that through the kindness of an officer, who, from his rank, is not more conspicuous than respected by the general tenor of his conduct, I have been favoured with the assistance of a journal by an ingenious and active officer of his division, which has greatly contributed to the embellishment of my work, by the communication of many local circumstances, impossible for me otherwise to have been acquainted with. The like assistance I have also to acknowledge from a friend who served under General Prescott during his gallant defence of Fort Matilda.  By the favour and indulgence of the Commander in Chief, I have been permitted to make extracts from the public order-book of the army; these form a large appendix, which, I trust, will not only confirm the accuracy of my narration, but will prove both useful and entertaining to the army in general.  Such has been the origin and progress of this publication; to the candour, therefore, of the public I commit myself, trusting that, as my ambition has been humble, I shall not be exposed to the severity of literary criticism for not having obtained that which I have never attempted.
