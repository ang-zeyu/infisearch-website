My study of these animals has led me to conclude that the smaller shrews of Arizona and New Mexico intergrade in a clinal fashion with the shrews of Colorado and in fact represent but one species. Since some individuals from Colorado are as small as larger individuals from this southwestern population of small animals, I conclude that such specimens are the basis for reports of _S. vagrans_ from Colorado. The shrews of the Sacramento Mountains resemble those of the Colorado Rockies more than they do the smaller shrews of western New Mexico and Arizona, possibly because the climate is similar in the Sacramento Mountains and the higher Colorado Rockies. There is less precipitation in the more western mountain ranges in New Mexico and in Arizona in April, May, and June than in the Colorado Rockies. These months are critical for the reproduction and growth of shrews.  As mentioned above, the shrews from east of the continental divide in Montana are smaller than those of the other mountains of the state, and it is upon such small animals that the name _Sorex vagrans_ has been based in this area. It is clear, however, that these smaller animals intergrade with the larger shrews of the more western mountains. The small size might be an adaptation to the lesser precipitation and harsher continental climate east of the continental divide in Montana.   Great Basin and Columbia Plateau Section  The vagrant shrews of the Great Basin and adjoining Columbia Plateau and Snake River Plains are smaller than their relatives in the Rocky Mountains and, by virtue of less gray in their pelage, are reddish in summer and blackish rather than grayish in winter. There is little significant geographic variation in shrews throughout this region, although owing to their restriction to the vicinity of water, the populations of shrews are more or less isolated from one another and each is somewhat different from the next. Those from nearest the Rockies are sometimes slightly larger and those from some places in Nevada are slightly paler than the average. This small reddish shrew is found all the way to the Pacific coast of California, Oregon, and Washington. In these coastal areas it is somewhat darker and sometimes a trifle larger than elsewhere. It intergrades with a somewhat larger, grayer shrew in the Sierra Nevada of California. Along the Wasatch front in Utah, this Great Basin shrew intergrades with the larger, grayer shrew of the Rockies. Owing to the abrupt change in elevation, the zone of intergradation is rather narrow horizontally. In the latitude of Salt Lake City, populations of intergrades occur at between 8,700 and 9,000 feet elevation. The lowland shrew occurs in the eastern part of the Snake River Plains, and along the valleys of the Bear and Salt rivers into Wyoming. Along the northern edge of the Snake River Plains and on the western edge of the mountains of central Idaho the transition from lowland to montane habitats is abrupt and in consequence the zone of contact between small and large shrews is narrow. In northern Idaho and northwestern Montana the transition from lowland to highland is more gradual. Tributaries of the Columbia River system, especially the Clark Fork, provide a path for movement of lowland forms into intermontane basins of western Montana. In addition, the vegetational zones are found at lower elevations, and there are boreal forests in the lowlands rather than only in the mountains as is the case in Utah and Colorado. In this area, therefore, the zone of intergradation between the smaller lowland shrew and the larger montane shrew is more gradual and gradually intergrading populations are found over a relatively large area. This has been well demonstrated for northwestern Montana by Clothier (1950). In southern British Columbia and northern Washington this shrew in the mountains is large and in the intermontane valleys is small. There is extensive interdigitation of valleys and mountain ranges, and, consequently, of life-zones in this region. In a few places, recognizably distinct populations of the vagrant shrew occur within a few miles of one another, but in other places there are populations of intergrades. West of the Cascades no evidence of intergradation has been found and the two kinds occur almost side by side and maintain their distinctness.  These Great Basin shrews dwell in hydrosere communities as do their Rocky Mountain counterparts. In this arid region such a habitat obviously is the only one habitable for a shrew of the _vagrans_ group. These shrews often maintain their predilection for such habitats when they reach the Pacific coast, and are commonly found in such places as coastal marshes, marshy meadows, and streamsides, while the woodlands are inhabited by other species.  These small shrews of the Great Basin and the small vagrant shrews of the Pacific Coast were called _Sorex vagrans_ by Jackson.   Summary of Geographic Variation  Large reddish shrews of the coast of California and southwestern Oregon become smaller and darker to the north. From southwestern British Columbia they again become larger as one proceeds northward along the coast to Wrangell, Alaska, and north of that they again become smaller. Moving inland from the coast the shrews become markedly smaller in Alaska and British Columbia. The smaller inland and montane form occurs south through the Rocky Mountains, becoming slightly smaller in central Montana, slightly larger in southeastern New Mexico, and slightly smaller in western New Mexico and in Arizona. This montane form intergrades with a smaller more reddish Great Basin shrew, the zone of intergradation roughly following the western slope of the Rocky Mountains. The Great Basin shrew occurs westward to the Pacific Coast; there the Great Basin shrew occurs with, although in part it is ecologically separated from, the large reddish coastal shrews.  There seems to be an intergrading chain of subspecies of one species, the end members of which (the small Great Basin form and the large coastal form) are so different in size and ecological niche that they are able to coexist without interbreeding. In southern British Columbia the morphological differences are not so marked as farther south along the Pacific Coast. There, in British Columbia, reproductive isolation is not complete and occasional populations of intergrades occur. In Montana extensive intergradation occurs in a broad zone of transitional habitat. Along the western edge of the Rockies from Idaho south to Utah the zone of transition from montane to basin habitat is sharp and the zone of intergradation, although present, is fairly narrow, perhaps because there is little intermediate habitat which logically might be expected to be most suitable for intergrading populations.  The oldest name applied to a shrew of the group under consideration is _Sorex vagrans_ Baird, 1858, the type locality of which is Willapa Bay, Pacific County, Washington. The name applies to the small vagrant shrew of this area, rather than to the larger forest dweller which has been known as _Sorex obscurus_. The name _S. vagrans_, in the specific sense, must therefore apply to all the shrews discussed which have heretofore been known by the names _S. pacificus_, _S. yaquinae_, _S. obscurus_, and _S. vagrans_.  A situation such as the one here described where well differentiated end members of a chain of subspecies overlap over an extensive geographic range throughout the year without interbreeding--thus reacting toward one another as do full species--so far as I know has not previously been found to exist in mammals. The overlapping end-members of the chain of subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_ really do coexist; specimens of the overlapping subspecies have been taken together at the same localities from California to British Columbia. I have taken a specimen of _S. v. vagrans_ and several of _S. v. setosus_ in the same woodlot at Fort Lewis, Pierce County, Washington. Two subspecies of deer, _Odocoileus hemionus_, in the Sierra Nevada of California, occur together over a sizeable area but for only a part of each year that does not include the breeding season (Cowan, 1936:156-157). In the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, the geographic ranges of several pairs of subspecies meet at certain places without intergradation of the two kinds. In these instances well marked ecological differences exist between the subspecies involved. In western Washington, for example, the geographic range of the lowland subspecies, _P. m. austerus_, interdigitates to the east and west with the range of the montane and coniferous forest-inhabiting subspecies, _P. m. oreas_, and the two kinds have not been shown to intergrade. _Peromyscus maniculatus artemesiae_ and _P. m. osgoodi_ come together without interbreeding in Glacier National Park, Montana. _P. m. artemesiae_ is almost entirely a forest-dwelling subspecies, whereas _osgoodi_ is an inhabitant of open country. The two kinds do not actually occur together ecologically although they occur together in buildings at the edge of the woods (A. Murie, 1933:4-5).     [Illustration: FIG. 5. Probable present geographic distribution       of _Sorex vagrans_. The range of _S. v. vagrans_ and its       derivatives _S. v. vancouverensis_, _S. v. halicoetes_, and       _S. v. paludivagus_, is shown by lines slanting in a different       direction than those which mark the range of all the other       subspecies of _S. vagrans_. The region in which _S. v. vagrans_       occurs together with other subspecies of _S. vagrans_ is shown       by the superposition of one pattern upon the other.]  Cases of sympatric existence of two subspecies of one species are known in birds and in reptiles.

In the first species the two end-members, the herring gull and the lesser black-backed gull, occur together over an extensive region from northern Europe and the British Isles throughout Fennoscandia. Fitch (1940) described a rassenkreis with overlapping subspecies in the garter snake _Thamnophis ordinoides_.  The geographic distribution of the species _Sorex vagrans_ is shown in figure 5. The geographic range of the Great Basin subspecies is shown by a different pattern of lines than the other subspecies of _S. vagrans_. In the region in which the geographic range of the Great Basin subspecies overlaps those of the subspecies of the Pacific Coast, the pattern of shading for the Great Basin subspecies is superimposed on the patterns for the other subspecies.     ORIGIN OF THE _SOREX VAGRANS_ RASSENKREIS   The distribution of the species _Sorex vagrans_ and that of its immediate ancestors obviously has not always been the same; during glacial ages much of the present range of the species in Canada and in some of the higher mountains of the United States was covered with ice and not available to the shrew. Furthermore, large areas that are now too hot and dry to permit the existence of_ S. vagrans_ were at one time habitable. If we are to speculate on the manner in which the _Sorex vagrans_ rassenkreis originated we must inquire into the nature and extent of these climatic changes.  The most recent epoch of geological time, the Pleistocene, is known to have been divided into a series of alternating glacial and interglacial ages. During the glacial ages continental and montane glaciers are judged to have covered much of Canada and the northern United States. Concurrently the major storm tracks of the west probably were shifted southward; in any event much of the now arid intermontane west was much better watered than it is today.  The increased precipitation, and probably glacial meltwater, formed large lakes in the closed basins of the Great Basin. There were boreal forests at lower elevations than there are today in comparable latitudes and continuous boreal habitat probably connected many of the isolated mountain ranges of the southwest. That probability is supported by the presence of boreal animals and plants on many of these isolated ranges today. A boreal tree squirrel, such as _Tamiasciurus_, could hardly be suspected of crossing a treeless, intermontane desert valley, miles wide.     [Illustration: FIGS. 6_a_-6_f_.

Glaciers retreated or disappeared, boreal forests became montane in much of the United States, and the lakes in the Great Basin were reduced or disappeared. One can envision that during such times boreal mammals were isolated, their geographic ranges were restricted, and Sonoran mammals expanded their ranges.  Evidence is more extensive concerning the number and extent of glacial ages in the eastern than in the western part of North America. This evidence suggests a division of the Pleistocene into four glacial ages and four interglacial ages, the fourth interglacial age corresponding to the present time. More information is available about the Wisconsinan, or last, glacial age, than about the earlier ones, because the last glaciation in many montane areas destroyed evidence of earlier glaciations. The names of currently recognized glacial and interglacial ages of the Pleistocene are listed below. The names of interglacial ages are in Italic type.      Wisconsinan     _Sangamonian_     Illinoian     _Yarmouthian_     Kansan     _Aftonian_     Nebraskan  We may think of these ages as an alternating series of cool moist and warm dry periods during which boreal mammals, and other organisms, alternately moved southward (disappearing in the glaciated regions) and northward into previously glaciated areas (while disappearing from southern areas except on isolated mountain ranges). _Sorex vagrans_ probably followed this pattern of movement and now is restricted to forested or well-watered places.  One possible series of events culminating in the formation of the _Sorex vagrans_ rassenkreis may be thought of as having begun during the Illinoian age. With much of Canada, and perhaps also many areas in the Rockies, Cascades, and the Sierra Nevada covered with glacial ice, the shrew-stock ancestral to _Sorex vagrans_ may well have occupied a more or less continuous range over the Colorado Plateau, the Columbian Plateau, the Great Basin, and in the forests of the Pacific Coast (as well as over part of eastern United States, as will be explained beyond; see fig. 7). At that time the species probably was a continuously interbreeding unit.     [Illustration: FIG. 7. Possible distribution in Illinoian       (inset) and Sangamonian times of the ancestor of the _Sorex       vagrans-ornatus-longirostris-veraepacis_ complex. Approximate       southern boundary of Illinoian glaciation marked by heavy       line.]  In the ensuing Sangamonian interglacial age all glaciers retreated or disappeared thereby opening up extensive areas in the north and in the higher mountains which were occupied by a boreal fauna, including _S. vagrans_. Concurrently the Great Basin, and probably also much of the Columbian Plateau, became dry, and desert conditions developed, perhaps much as they are today. Increasing aridity eliminated shrew habitat in most places between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada-Cascade mountain chain with the result that the geographic range of the species resembled an inverted \"U\", one arm lying along the Rocky Mountains and the other along the Cascade-Sierra Nevada axis; the connection between the two arms was in British Columbia (see fig. 7). At present _Sorex vagrans_ does occur in isolated places in the Great Basin, but its existence there is tenuous and seemingly dependent upon the occurrence of permanent water such as Ruby Lake and Reese River. With such an arrangement as this it can readily be seen that gene flow between the eastern and western arms of the \"U\" would be greatly reduced by distance; consequently differentiation between the two might be expected.     [Illustration: FIG. 8. Possible distribution of _Sorex vagrans_       at two different times in the Wisconsinan Age. Left, early       Wisconsinan; right, mid-Wisconsinan.]  Wisconsinan glaciation again rendered Canada uninhabitable, and it is quite possible that extensive areas in the Rocky Mountains, the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada were heavily glaciated. With the elimination of the northern part of the \"U\", the eastern and western arms became isolated, if not by the width of the Columbian Plateau at least by the glaciated Cascade Mountains. At the same time extensive areas on the Colorado Plateau and much of the area south to the Mexican highlands were again occupied by the species. Finally the Great Basin, again being well-watered, provided suitable habitat for, and was reoccupied by, _Sorex vagrans_ (see fig. 8). This reoccupation of the Great Basin took place probably from the Colorado Plateau and mountains of Arizona and Utah, since the present day shrews of the species _S. vagrans_ in the Great Basin closely resemble Rocky Mountain shrews but differ markedly from the large endemic subspecies of the Pacific Coast.  Finally, with the waning of Wisconsinan ice, the species again was able to occupy northern and montane areas as it had during Sangamonian times. Again dessication of the Great Basin caused drastic restriction of shrew habitat. The small, marsh-dwelling kind of wandering shrew which had developed there around the lakes of Wisconsinan time occupied suitable habitat all the way to the Pacific coast where its range came into contact with that of the western arm of the Sangamonian \"U.\"-pattern of shrew distribution (see fig. 9). The animals of this western segment and the new arrivals from the east were by this time so different from one another that the two kinds lived in the same areas without interbreeding. The descendants of the original western arm now are known as _Sorex vagrans sonomae_, _S. v. pacificus_, _S. v. yaquinae_, and _S. v. bairdi_. The newcomers from the east are known as _S. v. vagrans_, _S. v. halicoetes_, _S. v. paludivagus_ and _S. v. vancouverensis_.  In addition to occupying the Pacific Coast from San Francisco Bay north to the Fraser Delta, the Great Basin subspecies populated the Columbia Plateau and the western foothills of the central and northern Rockies. By so doing that subspecies came into secondary contact with its own parent stock with which it was still in reproductive continuity in Utah. In some places in British Columbia differentiation between the two kinds had proceeded to such an extent that some reproductive isolation was effected, but in many other places the two interbred. The Rocky Mountain form spread north and west and occupied the Cascades and coastal lowlands in southwestern British Columbia and in Washington. Here the differentiation between the Rocky Mountain subspecies and the Great Basin subspecies was great enough to cause complete reproductive isolation.     [Illustration: FIG. 9.
