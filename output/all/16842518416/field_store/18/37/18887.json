CHAPTER I.    _THE CLASSIFICATION OF INSECTS._   About forty years ago the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of St. Fernando in Chili arrested a certain M. Renous on a charge of witchcraft, because he kept some caterpillars which turned into butterflies.[1] This was no doubt an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],["title","On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#2)"],["body","case of ignorance; it is now almost universally known that the great majority of insects quit the egg in a state very different from that which they ultimately assume; and the general statement in works on entomology has been that the life of an insect may be divided into four periods.  Thus, according to Kirby and Spence,[2] “The states through which insects pass are four: the _egg_, the _larva_, the _pupa_, and the _imago_.” Burmeister,[3] also, says that, excluding certain very rare anomalies, “we may observe four distinct periods of existence in every insect,—namely, those of the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the imago, or perfect insect.” In fact, however, the various groups of insects differ widely from one another in the metamorphoses they pass through: in some, as in the grasshoppers and crickets, the changes consist principally in a gradual increase of size, and in the acquisition of wings; while others, as for instance the common fly, acquire their full bulk in a form very different from that which they ultimately assume, and pass through a period of inaction in which not only is the whole form of the body altered, not only are legs and wings acquired, but even the internal organs themselves are almost entirely disintegrated and re-formed. It will be my object, after having briefly described these changes, to throw some light on the causes to which they are due, and on the indications they afford of the stages through which insects have been evolved.  The following list gives the orders or principal groups into which the Class Insecta may be divided. I will not, indeed, here enter upon my own views, but will adopt the system given by Mr. Westwood in his excellent “Introduction to the Modern Classification of Insects,” from which also, as a standard authority, most of the figures on Plates I. to IV., when not otherwise acknowledged, have been taken. He divides insects into thirteen groups, and with reference to eight of them it may be said that there is little difference of opinion among entomologists. These orders are by far the most numerous, and I have placed them in capital letters. As regards the other five there is still much difference of opinion. It must also be observed that Prof. Westwood omits the parasitic Anoplura, as well as the Thysanura and Collembola.   ORDERS OF INSECTS ACCORDING TO WESTWOOD.     1. HYMENOPTERA   Bees, Wasps, Ants, &c.    2. STREPSIPTERA  _Stylops_, _Zenos_, &c.    3. COLEOPTERA    Beetles.    4. EUPLEXOPTERA  Earwigs.    5. ORTHOPTERA    Grasshoppers, Crickets, Cockroaches, &c.    6. THYSANOPTERA  _Thrips_.    7. NEUROPTERA    _Ephemeras_, &c.    8. TRICHOPTERA   _Phryganea_.    9. DIPTERA       Flies and Gnats.   10. APHANIPTERA   Fleas.   11. HETEROPTERA   Bugs.   12. HOMOPTERA     _Aphis_, _Coccus_, &c.   13. LEPIDOPTERA   Butterflies and Moths.  Of these thirteen orders, the eight which I have placed in capital letters—namely the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth, are much the most important in the number and variety of their species; the other five form comparatively small groups. The Strepsiptera are minute insects, parasitic on Hymenoptera: Rossi, by whom they were discovered, regarded them as Hymenopterous; Lamarck placed them among the Diptera; by others they have been considered to be most closely allied to the Coleoptera, but they are now generally treated as an independent order.  The Euplexoptera or Earwigs are only too familiar to most of us. Linnæus classed them among the Coleoptera, from which, however, they differ in their transformations. Fabricius, Olivier, and Latreille regarded them as Orthoptera; but Dr. Leach, on account of the structure of their wings, considered them as forming the type of a distinct order, in which view he has been followed by Westwood, Kirby, and many other entomologists.  The Thysanoptera, consisting of the Linnæan genus _Thrips_, are minute insects well known to gardeners, differing from the Coleoptera in the nature of their metamorphoses, in which they resemble the Orthoptera and Hemiptera. The structure of the wings and mouth-parts, however, are considered to exclude them from these two orders.  The Trichoptera, or Caddis worms, offer many points of resemblance to the Neuroptera, while in others they approach more nearly to the Lepidoptera. According to Westwood, the genus _Phryganea_ “forms the connecting link between the Neuroptera and Lepidoptera.”  The last of these small aberrant orders is that of the Aphaniptera, constituted for the family Pulicidæ. In their transformations, as in many other respects, they closely resemble the Diptera. Strauss Durckheim indeed said that “_la puce est un diptère sans ailes_.” Westwood, however, regards it as constituting a separate order.  As indicated by the names of these orders, the structure of the wings affords extremely natural and convenient characters by which the various groups may be distinguished from one another. The mouth-parts also are very important; and, regarded from this point of view, the Insecta have been divided into two series—the Mandibulata and Haustellata, or mandibulate and suctorial groups, between which, as I have elsewhere shown,[4] the Collembola (_Podura_, _Smynthurus_, &c.) occupy an intermediate position. These two series are:—  MANDIBULATA.    Hymenoptera.   Strepsiptera.   Coleoptera.   Euplexoptera.   Orthoptera.   Trichoptera?   Thysanoptera?  HAUSTELLATA.    Lepidoptera.   Diptera.   Aphaniptera.   Hemiptera.   Homoptera.  Again—and this is the most important from my present point of view—insects have sometimes been divided into two other series, according to the nature of their metamorphoses: “Heteromorpha,” to use the terminology of Prof. Westwood,[5] “or those in which there is no resemblance between the parent and the offspring; and Homomorpha, or those in which the larva resembles the imago, except in the absence of wings. In the former the larva is generally worm-like, of a soft and fleshy consistence, and furnished with a mouth, and often with six short legs attached in pairs to the three segments succeeding the head. In the Homomorpha, including the Orthoptera, Hemiptera, Homoptera, and certain Neuroptera, the body, legs, and antennæ are nearly similar in their form to those of the perfect insect, but the wings are wanting.”  HETEROMORPHA.    Hymenoptera.   Strepsiptera.   Coleoptera.   Trichoptera.   Diptera.   Aphaniptera.   Lepidoptera.  HOMOMORPHA.    Euplexoptera.   Orthoptera.   Hemiptera.   Homoptera.   Thysanoptera.   Neuroptera.  But though the Homomorphic insects do not pass through such striking changes of form as the Heteromorphic, and are active throughout life, still it was until within the last few years generally (though erroneously) considered, that in them, as in the Heteromorpha, the life fell into four distinct periods; those of (1) the egg, (2) the larva, characterized by the absence of wings, (3) the pupa with imperfect wings, and (4) the imago, or perfect insect.  I have, however, elsewhere[6] shown that there are not, as a matter of fact, four well-marked stages, and four only, but that in many cases the process is much more gradual.  The species belonging to the order Hymenoptera are among the most interesting of insects. To this order belong the gallflies, the sawflies, the ichneumons, and, above all, the ants and bees. We are accustomed to class the Anthropoid apes next to man in the scale of creation, but if we were to judge animals by their works, the chimpanzee and the gorilla must certainly give place to the bee and the ant. The larvæ of the sawflies, which live on leaves, and of the Siricidæ or long-tailed wasps, which feed on wood, are very much like caterpillars, having three pairs of legs, and in the former case abdominal pro-legs as well: but in the great majority of Hymenoptera the larvæ are legless, fleshy grubs (Plate II., Figs. 7-9); and the various modes by which the females provide for, or secure to, them a sufficient supply of appropriate nourishment constitutes one of the most interesting pages of Natural History.  The species of Hymenoptera are very numerous; in this country alone there are about 3,000 kinds, most of which are very small. In the pupa state they are inactive, and show distinctly all the limbs of the perfect insect, encased in distinct sheaths, and folded on the breast. In the perfect state they are highly organized and very active. The working ants and some few species are wingless, but the great majority have four strong membranous wings, a character distinguishing them at once from the true flies, which have only one pair of wings.  The saw-flies are so called because they possess at the end of the body a curious organ, corresponding to the sting of a wasp, but which is in the form of a fine-toothed saw. With this instrument the female sawfly cuts a slit in the stem or leaf of a plant, into which she introduces her egg. The larva much resembles a caterpillar, both in form and habits. To this group belongs the nigger, or black caterpillar of the turnip, which is often in sufficient numbers to do much mischief. Some species make galls, but the greater number of galls are formed by insects of another family, the Cynipidæ.  [Illustration: PLATE I.[7]—MATURE INSECTS.
