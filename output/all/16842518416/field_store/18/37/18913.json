V  One cannot but wonder what Hazlitt, who could not think of beauty, simplicity, or sensibility as qualities having any possible association with opera, would have said of a manner of writing for the lyric stage which ignores even those opportunities for musical effect which composers of unimpeachable artistic integrity have always held to be desirable and legitimate. There is an even richer invitation to the Spirit of Comedy in trying to imagine what Richard Wagner would have said to the suggestion of a lyric-drama in which the orchestra is not employed at its full strength more than three times in the course of a score almost as long as that of \"Tristan und Isolde,\" and in which the singers scarcely ever raise their voices above a _mezzo-forte_. Debussy's orchestra is unrivalled in musico-dramatic art for the exquisite justness with which it enforces the moods and action of the play. It never seduces the attention of the auditor from the essential concerns of the drama itself: never, as with Wagner, tyrannically absorbs the mind. Always in this unexampled music-drama there is maintained, as to emphasis and intensity, a scrupulous balance between the movement of the drama and the tonal undercurrent which is its complement: the music is absolutely merged in the play, suffusing it, colouring it, but never dominating or transcending it. It is for this reason that it deserves, as an exemplification of the ideal manner of constructing a music-drama, the hazardous epithet \"perfect\"; for it is, one cannot too often repeat, a work far more faithful to Wagner's avowed principles than are his own magnificently inconsistent scores. In this music there is no excess of gesture, there is none of Wagner's gorgeously expansive rhetoric: the \"Je t'aime,\" \"Je t'aime aussi\" of Debussy's lovers are expressed with a simplicity and a stark sincerity which could not well go further; and it is a curious and significant fact that the moment of their profoundest ecstasy, though it is artfully and eloquently prepared, is represented in the orchestra by a blank measure, a moment of complete silence. This, indeed, is almost the supreme distinction of Debussy's music-drama: that it should be at once so eloquent and so discreet: that it should be, in the exposition of its subject-matter, so rich and intense yet so delicately and heedfully reticent. After the grave speech and simple gestures of these naïve yet subtle and passionate tragedians, as Debussy has translated them into fluid tone, the posturings and the rhetoric of Wagner's splendid personages seem, for a time, violently extravagant, excessive, and overwrought. To attempt to resist the imperious sway which the most superb of musical romantics must always exert over his kingdom would be a futile endeavour; yet it cannot be denied that for some the method of Debussy as a musical dramatist will seem the more viable and the more sound, as it is grateful to the mind a little wearied by the drums and tramplings of Wagnerian conquests.  His use of the orchestra differs from Wagner's in degree rather than in kind. As he employs it, it is a veracious and pointed commentary on the text and the action of the play, underlining the significance of the former and colouring and intensifying the latter; but its comments are infinitely less copious and voluble than are Wagner's--indeed, their reticence and discretion are, as it has been said, extreme. Debussy's choric orchestra is often as remarkable for what it does not say as for what it does. Can one, for example, imagine Wagner being able to resist the temptation to indulge in some graphic and detailed tone-painting, at the cost of delaying the action and overloading the score, at the passage wherein _Golaud_, coming upon the errant and weeping _Mélisande_ in the forest, and seeing her crown at the bottom of the spring where she has thrown it, asks her what it is that shines in the water? Yet observe the curiously insinuating effect which results from Debussy's deft and reticent treatment of this episode--the _pianissimo_ chords on the muted horns, followed by a measure in which the voices declaim alone. And would not Wagner have wrung the last drop of emotion out of the death scene of _Mélisande_?--a scene for which Debussy has written music of almost insupportable poignancy, yet of a quality so reserved and unforced that it enters the consciousness almost unperceived as music.  The discursive and exegetical tendencies of Wagner are forgotten; nor are we reminded of the manner in which Strauss, in his \"Salome,\" overlays the speech and action of the characters with a dense, oppressive, and many-stranded web of tone. Yet always Debussy's musical comment is intimately and truthfully reflective of what passes visibly upon the stage and in the hearts of his dramatic personages; though often it transmits not so much the actual speech and apparent emotions of the characters, as that dim and pseudonymous reality,--\"the thing behind the thing,\" as the Celts have named it,--which hovers, unspoken and undeclared, in the background of Maeterlinck's wonderful play. We are reminded at times, in listening to this lucent and fluid current of orchestral tone, of Villiers de L'Isle-Adam's description of the voice of his _Elen_: \"... it was taciturn, subdued, like the murmur of the river Lethe, flowing through the region of shadows.\" This orchestra, seldom elaborate in thematic exfoliation, and still less frequently polyphonic in texture, is, for the most part, a voice that speaks in hints and through allusions. The huge and imperious eloquence of Wagner is not to be sought for here. Taine once spoke of the \"violent sorcery\" of Victor Hugo's style, and it is a phrase that comes often to the mind in thinking of the music of the titanic German. Debussy in his \"Pelléas\" has written music that is rich in sorcery; but it is not violent. In it inheres a capacity for expression, and a quality of enchantment in the result, that music had not before exerted--an enchantment that invades the mind by stealth yet holds it with enchaining power. In a curious degree the music is both contemplative and impassioned; its pervading note is that of still flame, of emotional quietude--the sweeping and cosmic winds of \"Tristan und Isolde\" are absent. Yet the dramatic fibre of the score is strong and rich; for all its fineness and delicacy of texture and its economy of accent, it is neither amorphous nor inert.   VI  _Tristan_ and _Isolde_, in moments of exalted emotion, utter that emotion with the frankest lyricism; _Pelléas_ and _Mélisande_, in moments of like fervour, still adhere to the unformed and unsymmetrical declamation in which their language is elsewhere couched. It is the orchestra which sings--which, passionately or meditatively, colours the dramatic moment. Wherein we come to what is perhaps the most extraordinary feature of this extraordinary score: the treatment of the voice-parts. Debussy's accomplishment in this respect, justly summarised, is this: He has released the orchestra from its thraldom to the methods of the symphonic poem (to which Wagner committed it) by making it a background, a support, rather than a thing of procrustean dominance, thus restoring liberty and transparency of dramatic utterance to the singing actors. He himself has succinctly stated the principles which guided him in his manner of writing for the voices in \"Pelléas.\" \"I have been reproached,\" he has said, \"because in my score the melodic phrase is always found in the orchestra, never in the voice. I wished--intended, in fact,--that the action should never be arrested; that it should be continuous, uninterrupted. I wanted to dispense with parasitic musical phrases. When listening to a [musico-dramatic] work, the spectator is wont to experience two kinds of emotion: the musical emotion on the one hand; and the emotion of the character [in the drama], on the other. Generally these are felt successively. I have tried to blend these two emotions, and make them simultaneous. Melody is, if I may say so, almost anti-lyric, and powerless to express the constant change of emotion or life. Melody is suitable only for the song [_chanson_], which confirms a fixed sentiment. I have never been willing that my music should hinder ... the changes of sentiment and passion felt by my characters. Its demands are ignored as soon as it is necessary that these should have perfect liberty in their gestures as in their cries, in their joys as in their sorrow.\"  Now Debussy in his public excursions as a critic is not always to be taken seriously; indeed, it is altogether unlikely that he has refrained from demonstrations of exquisite delight over the startled or contemptuous comment which some of his vivacious heresies concerning certain of the gods of music have evoked. These published appraisements of his are, of course, nothing more than impertinent, though at times apt and sagacious, _jeux d'esprit_. But when he speaks seriously, as in the defence of his practice which I have just quoted, of the menace of \"parasitic\" musical phrases in the voice-parts, and when he observes that melody, when it occurs in the speech of characters in music-drama, is \"almost anti-lyric,\" he speaks with penetration and truth. His practice, which illustrates it, amounts to this: He employs in \"Pelléas\" a continuous declamation, uncadenced, entirely unmelodic (in the sense in which melodious declamation has been understood). Save for a brief and particular instance, there is no melodic form whatsoever, from beginning to end of the score.

CHAPTER ONE.  THE YOUNG CHIEF OF ARRANDOON--THE RISING STORM--LOST IN THE SNOW.  It was winter.  Allan McGregor stood, gun in hand, leaning against a rock half-way down the mountain-side, and, with the exception of himself and the stately deer-hound that lay at his feet, there was no sign of any living thing in all the glen; and dreary and desolate in the extreme was the landscape all around him.  Glentroom in the summer time, when the braes were all green with the feathery birches, and the hillsides ablaze with the purple bloom of the heather, must have been both pleasant and romantic; but the birch-trees were now leafless and bare, the mountains were clad in snow, and the rock-bound lake, that lay far beneath, was leaden and grey like the sky itself, except where its waves were broken into foam by the snow-wind.  That snow-wind blew from the north, and there was a sound in its voice, as it sighed through the withered breckans and moaned fitfully among the rocks and crags, that told of a coming storm.  Allan was the young laird of Arrandoon.  All the glen had at one time belonged to his ancestors--ay, and all the land that could be seen, and all the lochs that could be counted from the peaks of Ben Lona.  His father, but two short years before the commencement of this strange story of adventure, had died, sword in hand, at the head of his regiment in distant Afghan, and left him--what?  A few thousand sheep, a few thousand acres of heather land on which to feed them, the title of chief, and yonder ancient castle, where dwelt his widowed mother and his sister.  Although he was a good Highland mile from his home, the castle, visible in every line and lineament from where he stood, formed quite a feature in the landscape.  A tall grey building, with many a quaint and curious window, and many a turret chamber, it was built on the spur of the mountain, around which swept a brown hill-stream, the third side, or base of the triangle, being bounded by a moat now dry, and a drawbridge never raised.  Far down beneath it was the grey loch, to which the noisy stream was hurrying.  Every old castle has its old story, and Arrandoon was no exception.  It had been built in troublous times--built when the wild clans of the McGregors were in their glory.  There the chiefs had dwelt, thence had they often sallied to tread the war-path or arouse the chase, and in its ancient halls many a gay revel had been held; but peace with the Lowlands, strange to say, had wrought the downfall of the chiefs of Arrandoon.  The country had been thrown open, Englishmen had visited the glens, and friendships had been formed between those who once were deadly foes.  In their own Highland homes the McGregors had entertained strangers in a regal fashion.  Herein was pride--the pride that goes before a fall.  When the chieftains went south, there, too, they would lord it, and herein lay more pride--the pride that caused the fall--for, alas and a lack-a-day! for the want of money land must be sold.  Thus the stranger crept into the country of the Gael, and gold did for the proud McGregors, what the sword itself could never achieve--it laid them low.  That was one chapter of this castle's story; the second is even a sadder one, for it tells of the days when, bereft of their lands, the proud chiefs of the McGregors, scorning trade, placed their claymores at the service of the reigning monarch, and fell in many a foreign land, fighting in a cause that was not their own, because fighting, they thought, was honourable, and fighting gave them bread.  And their wives and their little ones were left at home to mourn.  But no stranger saw the tears they shed.  It was towards this castle that the eyes of Allan McGregor were turned when first we see him; it was of the mournful history of his family he was thinking, as he stood on the hillside on this bleak, cold wintry evening.  \"Bah!\" he said to himself, \"the very game seem to forsake the glen. Just look here,\" he continued, addressing the dog, who looked up, wagging his tail, \"only two hares and a brace or two of birds, with a wild cat that we shot at hazard, didn't we, Bran?  And I'm sure we've walked fully twenty miles, haven't we, Bran?\"  \"Twenty miles fully,\" Bran seemed to say, speaking with his eyes and his tail.  \"And really, Bran, when my English college friends come to see me--as they will to-night, you know--I'll hardly have anything to give them to eat, leaving sport out of the question; will I, Bran?\"  Bran looked very serious at this, for he knew every inflection of his master's voice.  \"Ah, Bran, Bran! my dear old dog! it is very hard being a Highland chieftain with nothing to support one's dignity on.  Dignity, indeed! Why, Bran, I have positively to put mine in the pot and boil it for dinner.  Now rouse up, Bran; I want to speak to you, because I must have somebody to open my heart to.\"  Bran sat up on his haunches, and young Allan placed his hand on his head.  \"Yes, Bran, my heart seems strangely full of something, and I think, old dog, that it is hope! hope for better times to come.  You see our castle home down yonder, Bran?\"  The noble hound looked in the direction indicated, and again moved his tail.  \"Well, Bran, for many, many years there hasn't been a single wreath of smoke seen above any of the chimneys of that bonnie old house, except those that rise from the southern wing--the smallest wing, Bran, remember--and all the rest of the castle is going to wreck and ruin.  No wonder you half close your eyes, Bran; it is a sad serious business, and fine times the mice and the rats and the owls and the bats have been having in it, I can tell you!  \"But now just listen, old fellow!  All the time that you have been snoozing among the snow there, with your nose on top of the game-bag, I have been standing here thinking--thinking--thinking.  \"You would like to know what I have been thinking about, wouldn't you? Well, as you're a good, faithful dog, I'll tell you.  I've been thinking about the past, and old, old times, when McGregor of Arrandoon was the proudest chief that ever trod the heather.  That is more than a hundred years ago, Bran.  The present chief of Arrandoon is a very different sort of an individual.  To tell you the truth, my friend, your master is just as poor as peastraw, and there isn't much substance in that.  But, oh!  Bran, I've been thinking that, what if I myself, by my own exertions, could go somewhere and do something that would earn me wealth and fame?  To be sure I would like to be a soldier, but then mother says I must not leave her for the wars, and my poor father fought and bled for twenty long years, and there was nothing to send home but his sword. Heigho!  No, I cannot be a soldier, even if I would.  But something, Bran, I mean to do; something I mean to be, Bran.  I don't know yet, though, what that something will be, but my mother shall not die in poverty; of that I feel quite certain.  Pride caused the fall of the chiefs of Arrandoon; pride shall raise us once again.  The song says,--  \"`Whate'er a man dares he can do.'  \"And I mean to _dare_ and I mean to _do_, even if I go off to the gold-diggings.  But, oh!  Bran, only to think of getting back even a portion of my lands, that are now turned into shooting-grounds for the alien and stranger, to see sheep and lowing kine grazing where now only the heather grows, and the smoke curling upwards once more, from every chimney of our dear old home!  Isn't it a glorious thought, Bran?\"  Bran jumped up at once and shook himself.  Poor dog! he had no knowledge of a world beyond the glen, and probably the words in his master's heroic speech that he understood the best, were those about going somewhere and doing something.  So he shook himself, wagged his tail, looked up to the sky, down at the castle, then all round him, and finally up into his master's face, saying plainly enough,--  \"By all means, master.  I'm ready if you are.  What is it to be--hares, rabbits, deer, or wild cat?  I'm ready.\"  Young Allan laughed aloud, and again patted the rough honest head of the faithful hound.  And a very nice picture he and the dog would, just at that moment, have made, had an artist been there to transfer it to canvas.  McGregor was poor, I grant you, but he owned something better even than riches: he had youth and health and beauty--the beauty of manliness, and his were a face and figure that once seen were sure to be remembered.  \"Tall and stately, and strong as the oak, graceful as the bending willow,\"--this is something like the language that Ossian, or any other ancient Celtic bard, might have used in describing him.  I am sorry that I am not a Celtic bard, and that I must content myself with prosaically saying that Allan was handsome, and that the Highland garb which he wore--perhaps the most romantic of all costumes--well became him.  Reader, did ever you run down a mountain-side?  I can tell you that it is glorious fun.  You must know your mountain well though, and be sure no precipices are in your way.  Having made certain of this, off you go, just as Allan and his hound went now, with wild skips, and hops, and jumps; it is not running, it is positive kangarooing, and when you do leave the ground in a leap, you think you will never touch it again. But no fear must dwell in your heart during this mad race.  Once commenced, nothing can stop your wild career, till you find yourself at the foot and on level ground; and even then you have to run a goodly distance to expend the impulse that carried you downwards, or else you"]]]
