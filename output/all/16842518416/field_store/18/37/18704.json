That won't enable me to see the invisible.\"  \"But can't we have the rooms put back into something of the state they were in? The cook will remember----\"  \"No, no. That would be worse and worse; that would only be the housemaid's trail in turn overlaid by the cook's. You must leave things with me for a little, I think.\"  \"Then you don't give the case up?\" Mr. Kingscote asked anxiously.  \"Oh, no! I don't give it up just yet. Do you know anything of your brother's private papers--as they were before his death?\"  \"I never knew anything till after that. I have gone over them, but they are all very ordinary letters. Do you suspect a theft of papers?\"  Martin Hewitt, with his hands on his stick behind him, looked sharply at the other, and shook his head. \"No,\" he said, \"I can't quite say that.\"  We bade Mr. Douglas Kingscote good-day, and walked towards the station. \"Great nuisance, that setting to rights,\" Hewitt observed, on the way. \"If the place had been left alone, the job might have been settled one way or another by this time. As it is, we shall have to run over to your old lodgings.\"  \"My old lodgings?\" I repeated, amazed. \"Why my old lodgings?\"  Hewitt turned to me with a chuckle and a wide smile. \"Because we can't see the broken panel-work anywhere else,\" he said. \"Let's see--Chelsea, isn't it?\"  \"Yes, Chelsea. But why--you don't suppose the people who defaced the panels also murdered the man who painted them?\"  \"Well,\" Hewitt replied, with another smile, \"that would be carrying a practical joke rather far, wouldn't it? Even for the ordinary picture damager.\"  \"You mean you _don't_ think they did it, then? But what _do_ you mean?\"  \"My dear fellow, I don't mean anything but what I say. Come now, this is rather an interesting case despite appearances, and it _has_ interested me: so much, in fact, that I really think I forgot to offer Mr. Douglas Kingscote my condolence on his bereavement. You see a problem is a problem, whether of theft, assassination, intrigue, or anything else, and I only think of it as one. The work very often makes me forget merely human sympathies. Now, you have often been good enough to express a very flattering interest in my work, and you shall have an opportunity of exercising your own common sense in the way I am always having to exercise mine. You shall see all my evidence (if I'm lucky enough to get any) as I collect it, and you shall make your own inferences. That will be a little exercise for you; the sort of exercise I should give a pupil if I had one. But I will give you what information I have, and you shall start fairly from this moment. You know the inquest evidence, such as it was, and you saw everything I did in Ivy Cottage?\"  \"Yes; I think so. But I'm not much the wiser.\"  \"Very well. Now I will tell you. What does the whole case look like? How would you class the crime?\"  \"I suppose as the police do. An ordinary case of murder with the object of robbery.\"  \"It is _not_ an ordinary case. If it were, I shouldn't know as much as I do, little as that is; the ordinary cases are always difficult. The assailant did not come to commit a burglary, although he was a skilled burglar, or one of them was, if more than one were concerned. The affair has, I think, nothing to do with the expected wedding, nor had Mr. Campbell anything to do in it--at any rate, personally--nor the gardener. The criminal (or one of them) was known personally to the dead man, and was well-dressed: he (or again one of them, and I think there were two) even had a chat with Mr. Kingscote before the murder took place. He came to ask for something which Mr. Kingscote was unwilling to part with,--perhaps hadn't got. It was not a bulky thing. Now you have all my materials before you.\"  \"But all this doesn't look like the result of the blind spite that would ruin a man's work first and attack him bodily afterwards.\"  \"Spite isn't always blind, and there are other blind things besides spite; people with good eyes in their heads are blind sometimes, even detectives.\"  \"But where did you get all this information? What makes you suppose that this was a burglar who didn't want to burgle, and a well-dressed man, and so on?\"  Hewitt chuckled and smiled again.  \"I saw it--saw it, my boy, that's all,\" he said. \"But here comes the train.\"  On the way back to town, after I had rather minutely described Kingscote's work on the boarding-house panels, Hewitt asked me for the names and professions of such fellow lodgers in that house as I might remember. \"When did you leave yourself?\" he ended.  \"Three years ago, or rather more. I can remember Kingscote himself; Turner, a medical student--James Turner, I think; Harvey Challitt, diamond merchant's articled pupil--he was a bad egg entirely, he's doing five years for forgery now; by the bye he had the room we are going to see till he was marched off, and Kingscote took it--a year before I left; there was Norton--don't know what he was; 'something in the City,' I think; and Carter Paget, in the Admiralty Office. I don't remember any more at this moment; there were pretty frequent changes. But you can get it all from Mrs. Lamb, of course.\"  \"Of course; and Mrs. Lamb's exact address is--what?\"  I gave him the address, and the conversation became disjointed. At Farringdon station, where we alighted, Hewitt called two hansoms. Preparing to enter one, he motioned me to the other, saying, \"You get straight away to Mrs. Lamb's at once. She may be going to burn that splintered wood, or to set things to rights, after the manner of her kind, and you can stop her. I must make one or two small inquiries, but I shall be there half an hour after you.\"  \"Shall I tell her our object?\"  \"Only that I may be able to catch her mischievous lodgers--nothing else yet.\" He jumped into the hansom and was gone.  I found Mrs. Lamb still in a state of indignant perturbation over the trick served her four days before. Fortunately, she had left everything in the panelled room exactly as she had found it, with an idea of the being better able to demand or enforce reparation should her lodgers return. \"The room's theirs, you see, sir,\" she said, \"till the end of the week, since they paid in advance, and they may come back and offer to make amends, although I doubt it. As pleasant-spoken a young chap as you might wish, he seemed, him as come to take the rooms. 'My cousin,' says he, 'is rather an invalid, havin' only just got over congestion of the lungs, and he won't be in London till this evening late. He's comin' up from Birmingham,' he ses, 'and I hope he won't catch a fresh cold on the way, although of course we've got him muffled up plenty.' He took the rooms, sir, like a gentleman, and mentioned several gentlemen's names I knew well, as had lodged here before; and then he put down on that there very table, sir.\"--Mrs. Lamb indicated the exact spot with her hand, as though that made the whole thing much more wonderful--\"he put down on that very table a week's rent in advance, and ses, 'That's always the best sort of reference, Mrs. Lamb, I think,' as kind-mannered as anything--and never 'aggled about the amount nor nothing. He only had a little black bag, but he said his cousin had all the luggage coming in the train, and as there was so much p'r'aps they wouldn't get it here till next day. Then he went out and came in with his cousin at eleven that night--Sarah let 'em in her own self--and in the morning they was gone--and this!\" Poor Mrs. Lamb, plaintively indignant, stretched her arm towards the wrecked panels.  \"If the gentleman as you say is comin' on, sir,\" she pursued, \"can do anything to find 'em, I'll prosecute 'em, that I will, if it costs me ten pound. I spoke to the constable on the beat, but he only looked like a fool, and said if I knew where they were I might charge 'em with wilful damage, or county court 'em. Of course I know I can do that if I knew where they were, but how can I find 'em? Mr. Jones he said his name was; but how many Joneses is there in London, sir?\"  I couldn't imagine any answer to a question like this, but I condoled with Mrs. Lamb as well as I could. She afterwards went on to express herself much as her sister had done with regard to Kingscote's death, only as the destruction of her panels loomed larger in her mind, she dwelt primarily on that. \"It might almost seem,\" she said, \"that somebody had a deadly spite on the pore young gentleman, and went breakin' up his paintin' one night, and murderin' him the next!\"  I examined the broken panels with some care, having half a notion to attempt to deduce something from them myself, if possible. But I could deduce nothing. The beading had been taken out, and the panels, which were thick in the centre but bevelled at the edges, had been removed and split up literally into thin firewood, which lay in a tumbled heap on the hearth and about the floor. Every panel in the room had been treated in the same way, and the result was a pretty large heap of sticks, with nothing whatever about them to distinguish them from other sticks, except the paint on one face, which I observed in many cases had been scratched and scraped away. The rug was drawn half across the hearth, and had evidently been used to deaden the sound of chopping. But mischief--wanton and stupid mischief--was all I could deduce from it all.  Mr. Jones's cousin, it seemed, only Sarah had seen, as she admitted him in the evening, and then he was so heavily muffled that she could not distinguish his features, and would never be able to identify him. But as for the other one, Mrs. Lamb was ready to swear to him anywhere.  Hewitt was long in coming, and internal symptoms of the approach of dinner-time (we had had no lunch) had made themselves felt before a sharp ring at the door-bell foretold his arrival. \"I have had to wait for answers to a telegram,\" he said in explanation, \"but at any rate I have the information I wanted. And these are the mysterious"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37820"],["title","Chronicles of Martin Hewitt (#3)"],["body","nels, are they?\"  Mrs. Lamb's true opinion of Martin Hewitt's behaviour as it proceeded would have been amusing to know. She watched in amazement the antics of a man who purposed finding out who had been splitting sticks by dint of picking up each separate stick and staring at it. In the end he collected a small handful of sticks by themselves and handed them to me, saying, \"Just put these together on the table, Brett, and see what you make of them.\"  I turned the pieces painted side up, and fitted them together into a complete panel, joining up the painted design accurately. \"It is an entire panel,\" I said.  \"Good. Now look at the sticks a little more closely, and tell me if you notice anything peculiar about them--any particular in which they differ from all the others.\"  I looked. \"Two adjoining sticks,\" I said, \"have each a small semi-circular cavity stuffed with what seems to be putty. Put together it would mean a small circular hole, perhaps a knot-hole, half an inch or so in diameter, in the panel, filled in with putty, or whatever it is.\"  \"A _knot-hole_?\" Hewitt asked, with particular emphasis.  \"Well, no, not a knot-hole, of course, because that would go right through, and this doesn't. It is probably less than half an inch deep from the front surface.\"  \"Anything else? Look at the whole appearance of the wood itself. Colour, for instance.\"  \"It is certainly darker than the rest.\"  \"So it is.\" He took the two pieces carrying the puttied hole, threw the rest on the heap, and addressed the landlady. \"The Mr. Harvey Challitt who occupied this room before Mr. Kingscote, and who got into trouble for forgery, was the Mr. Harvey Challitt who was himself robbed of diamonds a few months before on a staircase, wasn't he?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Mrs. Lamb replied in some bewilderment. \"He certainly was that, on his own office stairs, chloroformed.\"  \"Just so, and when they marched him away because of the forgery, Mr. Kingscote changed into his rooms?\"  \"Yes, and very glad I was. It was bad enough to have the disgrace brought into the house, without the trouble of trying to get people to take his very rooms, and I thought----\"  \"Yes, yes, very awkward, very awkward!\" Hewitt interrupted rather impatiently. \"The man who took the rooms on Monday, now--you'd never seen him before, had you?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Then is _that_ anything like him?\" Hewitt held a cabinet photograph before her.  \"Why--why--law, yes, that's _him_!\"  Hewitt dropped the photograph back into his breast pocket with a contented \"Um,\" and picked up his hat. \"I think we may soon be able to find that young gentleman for you, Mrs. Lamb. He is not a very respectable young gentleman, and perhaps you are well rid of him, even as it is. Come, Brett,\" he added, \"the day hasn't been wasted, after all.\"  We made towards the nearest telegraph office. On the way I said, \"That puttied-up hole in the piece of wood seems to have influenced you. Is it an important link?\"  \"Well--yes,\" Hewitt answered, \"it is. But all those other pieces are important, too.\"  \"But why?\"  \"Because there are no holes in them.\" He looked quizzically at my wondering face, and laughed aloud. \"Come,\" he said, \"I won't puzzle you much longer. Here is the post-office. I'll send my wire, and then we'll go and dine at Luzatti's.\"  He sent his telegram, and we cabbed it to Luzatti's. Among actors, journalists, and others who know town and like a good dinner, Luzatti's is well known. We went upstairs for the sake of quietness, and took a table standing alone in a recess just inside the door. We ordered our dinner, and then Hewitt began:  \"Now tell me what _your_ conclusion is in this matter of the Ivy Cottage murder.\"  \"Mine? I haven't one. I'm sorry I'm so very dull, but I really haven't.\"  \"Come, I'll give you a point. Here is the newspaper account (torn sacrilegiously from my scrap-book for your benefit) of the robbery perpetrated on Harvey Challitt a few months before his forgery. Read it.\"  \"Oh, but I remember the circumstances very well. He was carrying two packets of diamonds belonging to his firm downstairs to the office of another firm of diamond merchants on the ground-floor. It was a quiet time in the day, and half-way down he was seized on a dark landing, made insensible by chloroform, and robbed of the diamonds--five or six thousand pounds' worth altogether, of stones of various smallish individual values up to thirty pounds or so. He lay unconscious on the landing till one of the partners, noticing that he had been rather long gone, followed and found him. That's all, I think.\"  \"Yes, that's all. Well, what do you make of it?\"  \"I'm afraid I don't quite see the connection with this case.\"  \"Well, then, I'll give you another point. The telegram I've just sent releases information to the police, in consequence of which they will probably apprehend Harvey Challitt and his confederate, Henry Gillard, _alias_ Jones, for the murder of Gavin Kingscote. Now, then.\"  \"Challitt! But he's in gaol already.\"  \"Tut, tut, consider. Five years' penal was his dose, although for the first offence, because the forgery was of an extremely dangerous sort. You left Chelsea over three years ago yourself, and you told me that his difficulty occurred a year before. That makes four years, at least. Good conduct in prison brings a man out of a five years' sentence in that time or a little less, and, as a matter of fact, Challitt was released rather more than a week ago.\"  \"Still, I'm afraid I don't see what you are driving at.\"  \"Whose story is this about the diamond robbery from Harvey Challitt?\"  \"His own.\"  \"Exactly. His own. Does his subsequent record make him look like a person whose stories are to be accepted without doubt or question?\"  \"Why, no. I think I see--no, I don't. You mean he stole them himself? I've a sort of dim perception of your drift now, but still I can't fix it. The whole thing's too complicated.\"  \"It is a little complicated for a first effort, I admit, so I will tell you. This is the story. Harvey Challitt is an artful young man, and decides on a theft of his firm's diamonds. He first prepares a hiding-place somewhere near the stairs of his office, and when the opportunity arrives he puts the stones away, spills his chloroform, and makes a smell--possibly sniffs some, and actually goes off on the stairs, and the whole thing's done. He is carried into the office--the diamonds are gone. He tells of the attack on the stairs, as we have heard, and he is believed. At a suitable opportunity he takes his plunder from the hiding-place, and goes home to his lodgings. What is he to do with those diamonds? He can't sell them yet, because the robbery is publicly notorious, and all the regular jewel buyers know him.  \"Being a criminal novice, he doesn't know any regular receiver of stolen goods, and if he did would prefer to wait and get full value by an ordinary sale. There will always be a danger of detection so long as the stones are not securely hidden, so he proceeds to hide them. He knows that if any suspicion were aroused his rooms would be searched in every likely place, so he looks for an unlikely place. Of course, he thinks of taking out a panel and hiding them behind that. But the idea is so obvious that it won't do; the police would certainly take those panels out to look behind them. Therefore he determines to hide them _in_ the panels. See here--he took the two pieces of wood with the filled hole from his tail pocket and opened his penknife--the putty near the surface is softer than that near the bottom of the hole; two different lots of putty, differently mixed, perhaps, have been used, therefore, presumably, at different times.\"  \"But to return to Challitt. He makes holes with a centre-bit in different places on the panels, and in each hole he places a diamond, embedding it carefully in putty. He smooths the surface carefully flush with the wood, and then very carefully paints the place over, shading off the paint at the edges so as to leave no signs of a patch. He doesn't do the whole job at once, creating a noise and a smell of paint, but keeps on steadily, a few holes at a time, till in a little while the whole wainscoting is set with hidden diamonds, and every panel is apparently sound and whole.\"  \"But, then--there was only one such hole in the whole lot.\"  \"Just so, and that very circumstance tells us the whole truth. Let me tell the story first--I'll explain the clue after. The diamonds lie hidden for a few months--he grows impatient. He wants the money, and he can't see a way of getting it. At last he determines to make a bolt and go abroad to sell his plunder. He knows he will want money for expenses, and that he may not be able to get rid of his diamonds at once. He also expects that his suddenly going abroad while the robbery is still in people's minds will bring suspicion on him in any case, so, in for a penny in for a pound, he commits a bold forgery, which, had it been successful, would have put him in funds and enabled him to leave the country with the stones. But the forgery is detected, and he is haled to prison, leaving the diamonds in their wainscot setting.  \"Now we come to Gavin Kingscote. He must have been a shrewd fellow--the sort of man that good detectives are made of. Also he must have been pretty unscrupulous. He had his suspicions about the genuineness of the diamond robbery, and kept his eyes open. What indications he had to guide him we don't know, but living in the same house a sharp fellow on the look-out would probably see enough. At any rate, they led him to the belief that the diamonds were in the thief's rooms, but not among his movables, or they would have been found after the arrest. Here was his chance. Challitt was out of the way for years, and there was plenty of time to take the house to pieces if it were necessary. So he changed into Challitt's rooms.  \"How long it took him to find the stones we shall never know. He probably tried many other"]]]
