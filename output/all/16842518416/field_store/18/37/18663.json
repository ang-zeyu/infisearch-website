He must never lose sight of the fact that, during the process of deposition, each separate layer was once the uppermost, and immediately in contact with the water in which aquatic animals lived. Each stratum, in fact, however far it may now lie beneath the surface, was once in the state of shingle, or loose sand or soft mud at the bottom of the sea, in which shells and other bodies easily became enveloped.  Rate of Deposition indicated by Fossils.—By attending to the nature of these remains, we are often enabled to determine whether the deposition was slow or rapid, whether it took place in a deep or shallow sea, near the shore or far from land, and whether the water was salt, brackish, or fresh. Some limestones consist almost exclusively of corals, and in many cases it is evident that the present position of each fossil zoophyte has been determined by the manner in which it grew originally. The axis of the coral, for example, if its natural growth is erect, still remains at right angles to the plane of stratification. If the stratum be now horizontal, the round spherical heads of certain species continue uppermost, and their points of attachment are directed downward. This arrangement is sometimes repeated throughout a great succession of strata. From what we know of the growth of similar zoophytes in modern reefs, we infer that the rate of increase was extremely slow, and some of the fossils must have flourished for ages like forest-trees, before they attained so large a size. During these ages, the water must have been clear and transparent, for such corals cannot live in turbid water.  Fossil Gryphæ, covered both on the outside and inside with fossil serpulæ. In like manner, when we see thousands of full-grown shells dispersed everywhere throughout a long series of strata, we cannot doubt that time was required for the multiplication of successive generations; and the evidence of slow accumulation is rendered more striking from the proofs, so often discovered, of fossil bodies having lain for a time on the floor of the ocean after death before they were imbedded in sediment. Nothing, for example, is more common than to see fossil oysters in clay, with Serpulæ, or barnacles (acorn-shells), or corals, and other creatures, attached to the inside of the valves, so that the mollusk was certainly not buried in argillaceous mud the moment it died. There must have been an interval during which it was still surrounded with clear water, when the creatures whose remains now adhere to it grew from an embryonic to a mature state. Attached shells which are merely external, like some of the Serpulæ (_a_) in Fig. 9, may often have grown upon an oyster or other shell while the animal within was still living; but if they are found on the inside, it could only happen after the death of the inhabitant of the shell which affords the support. Thus, in Fig. 9, it will be seen that two Serpulæ have grown on the interior, one of them exactly on the place where the adductor muscle of the _Gryphæa_ (a kind of oyster) was fixed.  Fig. 10: Serpula attached to a fossil. Fig. 11: Recent Spatangus with spines removed from one side. Some fossil shells, even if simply attached to the _ outside_ of others, bear full testimony to the conclusion above alluded to, namely, that an interval elapsed between the death of the creature to whose shell they adhere, and the burial of the same in mud or sand. The sea-urchins, or _Echini_, so abundant in white chalk, afford a good illustration. It is well known that these animals, when living, are invariably covered with spines supported by rows of tubercles. These last are only seen after the death of the sea-urchin, when the spines have dropped off. In Fig. 11 a living species of _Spatangus_, common on our coast, is represented with one half of its shell stripped of the spines. In Fig. 10 a fossil of a similar and allied genus from the white chalk of England shows the naked surface which the individuals of this family exhibit when denuded of their bristles. The full-grown _ Serpula_, therefore, which now adheres externally, could not have begun to grow till the _Micraster_ had died, and the spines became detached.  Fig. 12: Ananchytes from the chalk. Now the series of events here attested by a single fossil may be carried a step farther. Thus, for example, we often meet with a sea-urchin (_Ananchytes_) in the chalk (see Fig. 12) which has fixed to it the lower valve of a _Crania_, a genus of bivalve mollusca. The upper valve (_b_, Fig. 12) is almost invariably wanting, though occasionally found in a perfect state of preservation in white chalk at some distance. In this case, we see clearly that the sea-urchin first lived from youth to age, then died and lost its spines, which were carried away. Then the young _Crania_ adhered to the bared shell, grew and perished in its turn; after which the upper valve was separated from the lower before the _Ananchytes_ became enveloped in chalky mud.  Fig. 13: Fossil wood bored by Teredina.  Fig. 14: Recent wood bored by Teredo.  It may be well to mention one more illustration of the manner in which single fossils may sometimes throw light on a former state of things, both in the bed of the ocean and on some adjoining land. We meet with many fragments of wood bored by ship-worms at various depths in the clay on which London is built. Entire branches and stems of trees, several feet in length, are sometimes found drilled all over by the holes of these borers, the tubes and shells of the mollusk still remaining in the cylindrical hollows. In Fig. 14, _ e_, a representation is given of a piece of recent wood pierced by the _Teredo navalis_, or common ship-worm, which destroys wooden piles and ships. When the cylindrical tube _d_ has been extracted from the wood, the valves are seen at the larger or anterior extremity, as shown at _c._ In like manner, a piece of fossil wood (_a_, Fig. 13) has been perforated by a kindred but extinct genus, the _Teredina_ of Lamarck. The calcareous tube of this mollusk was united and, as it were, soldered on to the valves of the shell (_b_), which therefore cannot be detached from the tube, like the valves of the recent _Teredo._ The wood in this fossil specimen is now converted into a stony mass, a mixture of clay and lime; but it must once have been buoyant and floating in the sea, when the _ Teredinæ_ lived upon, and perforated it. Again, before the infant colony settled upon the drift wood, part of a tree must have been floated down to the sea by a river, uprooted, perhaps, by a flood, or torn off and cast into the waves by the wind: and thus our thoughts are carried back to a prior period, when the tree grew for years on dry land, enjoying a fit soil and climate.  Strata of Organic Origin.—It has been already remarked that there are rocks in the interior of continents, at various depths in the earth, and at great heights above the sea, almost entirely made up of the remains of zoophytes and testacea. Such masses may be compared to modern oyster-beds and coral-reefs; and, like them, the rate of increase must have been extremely gradual. But there are a variety of stone deposits in the earth’s crust, now proved to have been derived from plants and animals of which the organic origin was not suspected until of late years, even by naturalists. Great surprise was therefore created some years since by the discovery of Professor Ehrenberg, of Berlin, that a certain kind of siliceous stone, called tripoli, was entirely composed of millions of the remains of organic beings, which were formerly referred to microscopic Infusoria, but which are now admitted to be plants. They abound in rivulets, lakes, and ponds in England and other countries, and are termed Diatomaceæ by those naturalists who believe in their vegetable origin. The subject alluded to has long been well-known in the arts, under the name of infusorial earth or mountain meal, and is used in the form of powder for polishing stones and metals. It has been procured, among other places, from the mud of a lake at Dolgelly, in North Wales, and from Bilin, in Bohemia, in which latter place a single stratum, extending over a wide area, is no less than fourteen feet thick. This stone, when examined with a powerful microscope, is found to consist of the siliceous plates or frustules of the above-figured Diatomaceæ, united together without any visible cement. It is difficult to convey an idea of their extreme minuteness; but Ehrenberg estimates that in the Bilin tripoli there are 41,000 millions of individuals of the _Gaillonella distans_ (see Fig. 16) in every cubic inch (which weighs about 220 grains), or about 187 millions in a single grain. At every stroke, therefore, that we make with this polishing powder, several millions, perhaps tens of millions, of perfect fossils are crushed to atoms.  Figs 15 and 16: Gaillonella; Fig. 17: Bacillaria parodoxa A well-known substance, called bog-iron ore, often met with in peat-mosses, has often been shown by Ehrenberg to consist of innumerable articulated threads, of a yellow ochre colour, composed of silica, argillaceous matter, and peroxide of iron. These threads are the cases of a minute microscopic body, called _Gaillonella ferruginea_ (Fig. 15), associated with the siliceous frustules of other fresh-water algæ. Layers of this iron ore occurring in Scotch peat bogs are often called “the pan,” and are sometimes of economical value.  It is clear much time must have been required for the accumulation of strata to which countless generations of Diatomaceæ have contributed their remains; and these discoveries lead us naturally to suspect that other deposits, of which the materials have been supposed to be inorganic, may in reality be composed chiefly of microscopic"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3774"],["title","The Eskimo Twins (#0)"],["body","by Al Haines.

THE SUMMER DAY  SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS     THE ESKIMO TWINS   This is the true story of Menie and Monnie and their two little dogs, Nip and Tup.  Menie and Monnie are twins, and they live far away in the North, near the very edge.  They are five years old.  Menie is the boy, and Monnie is the girl. But you cannot tell which is Menie and which is Monnie,--not even if you look ever so hard at their pictures!  That is because they dress alike.  When they are a little way off even their own mother can't always tell. And if she can't, who can?  Sometimes the twins almost get mixed up about it themselves. And then it is very hard to know which is Nip and which is Tup, because the little dogs are twins too.  Nobody was surprised that the little dogs were twins, because dogs often are.  But everybody in the whole village where Menie and Monnie live was simply astonished to see twin babies!  They had never known of any before in their whole lives.  Old Akla, the Angakok, or Medicine Man of the village, shook his head when he heard about them. He said, \"Such a thing never happened here before. Seals and human beings never have twins! There's magic in this.\"  The name of the twins' father was Kesshoo. If you say it fast it sounds just like a sneeze.  Their mother's name was Koolee. Kesshoo and Koolee, and Menie and Monnie, and Nip and Tup, all live together in the cold Arctic winter in a little stone hut, called an \"igloo.\"  In the summer they live in a tent, which they call a \"tupik.\" The winters are very long and cold, and what do you think! They have one night there that is four whole months long!  For four long months, while we are having Thanksgiving, and Christmas, and even Lincoln's Birthday, the twins never once see the sun!  But at last one day in early spring the sun comes up again out of the sea, looks at the world for a little while, and then goes out of sight again. Each day he stays for a longer time until after a while he doesn't go out of sight at all!  Then there are four long months of daylight when there is never any bedtime. Menie and Monnie just go to sleep whenever they feel sleepy.  Although many Eskimos think twins bring bad luck, Kesshoo and Koolee were very glad to have two babies.  They would have liked it better still if Monnie had been a boy, too, because boys grow up to hunt and fish and help get food for the family.  But Kesshoo was the best hunter and the best kyak man in the whole village. So he said to Koolee, \"I suppose there must be girls in the world. It is no worse for us than for others.\"  So because Kesshoo was a brave fisherman and strong hunter, and because Koolee was clever in making clothing and shoes out of the skins of the animals which he brought home, the twins had the very best time that little Eskimo children can have.  And that is quite a good time, as you will see if you read all about it in this book.     I.  THE TWINS GO COASTING  THE TWINS GO COASTING  I.   One spring morning, very early, while the moon still shone and every one else in the village was asleep, Menie and Monnie crept out of the dark entrance of their little stone house by the sea.  The entrance to their little stone house was long and low like a tunnel. The Twins were short and fat. But even if they were short they could not stand up straight in the tunnel.  So they crawled out on all fours. Nip and Tup came with them. Nip and Tup were on all fours, too, but they had run that way all their lives, so they could go much faster than the twins. They got out first.  Then they ran round in circles in the snow and barked at the moon. When Menie and Monnie came out of the hole, Tup jumped up to lick Monnie's face. He bumped her so hard that she fell right into the snowbank by the entrance.  Monnie didn't mind a bit. She just put her two fat arms around Tup, and they rolled over together in the snow.  Monnie had on her fur suit, with fur hood and mittens, and it was hard to tell which was Monnie and which was Tup as they tumbled in the snow together.  Pretty soon Monnie picked herself up and shook off the snow. Then Tup shook himself, too. Menie was rolling over and over down the slope in front of the little stone house. His head was between his knees and his hands held his ankles, so he rolled just like a ball.  Nip was running round and round him and barking with all his might. They made strange shadows on the snow in the moonlight.  Monnie called to Menie. Menie straightened himself out at the bottom of the slope, picked himself up and ran back to her.  \"What shall we play?\" said Monnie.  \"Let's get Koko, and go to the Big Rock and slide downhill,\" said Menie.  \"All right,\" said Monnie. \"You run and get your sled.\"  Menie had a little sled which his father had made for him out of driftwood. No other boy in the village had one. Menie's father had searched the beach for many miles to find driftwood to make this sled.  The Eskimos have no wood but driftwood, and it is so precious that it is hardly ever used for anything but big dog sledges or spears, or other things which the men must have.  Most of the boys had sleds cut from blocks of ice. Menie's sled was behind the igloo. He ran to get it, and then the twins and the pups--all four--started for Koko's house.  Koko's house was clear at the other end of the village. But that was not far away, for there were only five igloos in the whole town.  First there was the igloo where the twins lived. Next was the home of Akla, the Angakok, and his two wives. Then there were two igloos where several families lived together. Last of all was the one where Koko and his father and mother and baby brother lived.  Koko was six. He was the twins' best friend.   II.  The air was very still. There was not a sound anywhere except the barking of the pups, the voices of Menie and Monnie, and the creaking sound of the snow under their feet as they ran.  The round moon was sailing through the deep blue sky and shining so bright it seemed almost as light as day.  There was one window in each igloo right over the tunnel entrance, and these windows shone with a dull yellow light.  In front of the village lay the sea. It was covered with ice far out from shore. Beyond the ice was the dark water out of which the sun would rise by and by.  There was nothing else to be seen in all the twins' world. There were no trees, no bushes even; nothing but the white earth, the shadows of the rocks and the snow-covered igloos, the bright windows, and the moon shining over all.   III.  Menie and Monnie soon reached Koko's igloo. Menie and Nip got there first. Monnie came puffing along with Tup just a moment after.  Then the twins dropped on their hands and knees in front of Koko's hut, and stuck their heads into the tunnel. Nip and Tup stuck their heads in, too.  They all four listened. There was not a sound to be heard except loud snores! The snores came rattling through the tunnel with such a frightful noise that the twins were almost scared.  \"They sleep out loud, don't they?\" whispered Monnie.  \"Let's wake them up,\" Menie whispered back.  Then the twins began to bark. \"Ki-yi, ki-yi, ki-yi, ki-yi,\" just like little dogs!  Nip and Tup began to yelp, too. The snores and the yelps met in the middle of the tunnel and the two together made such a dreadful sound that Koko woke up at once. When he heard four barks he knew right away that it must be the twins and the little dogs.  So he stuck his head into the other end of the tunnel and called, \"Keep still. You'll wake the baby! I'll be there in a minute.\"  Very soon Koko popped out of the black hole. He was dressed in a fur suit and mittens just like the twins.   IV.  The three children went along together toward the Big Rock. Monnie rode on the sled, and Menie and Koko pulled it. The Big Rock was very straight up and down on one side, and long and slanting on the other. The twins were going to coast down the slanting side.  They climbed to the top, and Menie had the first ride. He coasted down on his stomach with his little reindeer-skin kamiks (shoes) waving in the air.  Next Koko had a turn. What do you think he did? He stood straight up on the sled with the leather cord in his hand, and slid down that way! But then, you see, he was six.  When Monnie's turn came she wanted to go down that way, too. But Menie said, \"No. You'd fall off and bump your nose! You have hardly any nose as it is, and you'd better save it!\"  \"I have as much nose as you have, anyway,\" said Monnie.  \"Mine is bigger! I'm a boy!\" said Menie.  Koko measured their noses with his finger.  \"They are just exactly alike,\" he said.  Monnie turned hers up at Menie and said, \"What did I tell you?\"  Menie never said another word about noses. He just changed the subject. He said, \"Let's all slide down at once.\"  Koko and Menie sat down on the sled. Monnie sat on Menie. Then they gave a few hitches to the sled and off they went.  Whiz! How they flew!  The pups came running after them. In some places where it was very slippery the pups coasted, too! But they did not mean to. They did not like it. The sled was almost at the end of the slide when it struck a piece of ice. It flew around sideways and spilled all the children in the snow.  Just then Nip and Tup came sliding along behind them. They couldn't stop, so there they all were in a heap together, with the dogs on top!  Menie rolled over and sat up in the snow. He was holding on to the end of his nose. \"Iyi, iyi!\" he howled, \"I bumped my nose on a piece of ice!\"  Monnie sat up in the snow, too. She pointed her fur mitten at Menie's nose and laughed. \"Don't"]]]
