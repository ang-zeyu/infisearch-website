Menie sat on the ice and watched him and held Nip and Tup, one under each arm. When Koko got quite near the birds, he took careful aim and let fly an arrow at them.  It didn't hit any of the birds, but it frightened them. They flew up into the air and away to the north and alighted farther on. Koko followed them.  All at once Menie heard a queer little sound. It went \"Plop-plop-plop,\" and it sounded very near. Nip and Tup sniffed, and began to growl and nose around on the ice.  Menie knew what the queer noise meant, for his father had told him all about seal hunting. It meant that a seal-hole was near, and that a seal had come up to breathe. It was the seal that made the \"plopping\" noise.  Menie tried to keep the dogs still, but they wouldn't be kept still. They ran round with their noses on the snow, giving little anxious whines, and short, sharp barks.  The \"plop-plop\" stopped. The seal had gone down under the ice, but Menie meant to find the hole. He went out quite near the open water in his search. At last, just beyond a hummock of ice, he saw it! He crept carefully up to it.  He lay down on his stomach and peeped into the hole to see what it was like. He could not see a thing!  Then he stuck his lance down. His lance touched something soft that wiggled! Menie stood up. He was so excited that he trembled. He knew he had found a seal-hole with a live seal in the snow house!  With all his strength he struck his lance down through the snow. The snow house fell in and Menie fell with it, but he kept hold of his lance. The end of the lance was buried in the snow, but it was moving. Menie knew by this that he had stuck it into the seal!  He lay still and kept fast hold of his lance, and pressed down on it with all his might.  Nip and Tup were crazy with excitement. They jumped round and barked and tried to dig a hole in the snow with their forefeet.  At last the spear stopped wiggling. Then Menie carefully dug the snow away. There lay a little white seal! It was too young to swim away with its mother. That was why such a small boy as Menie had been able to kill it.  He dragged it out on the ice. He was so excited and so busy he did not notice how near he was to the open water.   IV.  All of a sudden there was a loud cracking noise, and Menie felt the ice moving under him! He looked back. There was a tiny strip of blue water between him and the shore!  The strip grew wider while he looked at it! Menie knew that he was adrift on an ice raft, and he was terribly frightened. Nip and Tup cuddled close to him and whined with fear.  Menie understood perfectly well that he might be carried far out to sea and never come back any more. He put his hands to his mouth and yelled with all his might!  Koko was still following the birds, and did not hear Menie's cries. Menie could see him running up the beach after the birds, and he could see his father working over his kyak near his home.  He even saw Monnie come out of the tunnel and go to watch her father at his work. They seemed very far away, and every moment the distance between them and the raft grew greater.  Menie screamed again and again. At the third scream he saw his father straighten up, shade his eyes with his hand, and look out to sea.  \"Oh,\" Menie thought. \"What if he shouldn't see me!\" He shouted louder than ever! He waved his arms! He even pinched the tails of Nip and Tup and made them bark. Then he saw his father wave his hand and dive into the tunnel.  In another instant he was out again and pulling on his skin coat. Then he took the kyak on his shoulders and ran with it to the beach. Monnie and Koolee came running after him.  They were doing the screaming now! Every one in the village heard the screams and came running down to the beach, too.  When Menie saw his father coming with the kyak, he wasn't afraid any more, for he was sure his father would save him. He wasn't even afraid about the cakes of ice that were floating in the water, though there is nothing more dangerous than to go out in a kyak among ice floes. One bump from a floating cake of ice is enough to upset any boat, and I don't like to think of what might happen if a kyak should get between two big cakes of ice.  Kesshoo ran with his kyak as far as he could on the ice. Then he got in and fitted the bottom of his skin jacket over the kyak hole and carefully slid himself into the open water.  Once in the water, how his paddle flew!  It seemed to Menie as if his father would never reach him! He sat very still on the ice pan with the dead seal beside him, and Nip and Tup huddled up against him.  At last Kesshoo came near enough so he could make Menie hear everything he said. \"Menie,\" he cried, \"if you do exactly what I tell you to, I can save you.  \"I will throw you my harpoon. You must drive it way down into the ice. Then by the harpoon line I will tow your ice pan back toward shore. When we get to the big ice I will find a place for you to land.  \"You must be ready, and when I give the word jump from your ice raft on to the solid ice.\"  Then Kesshoo threw his harpoon, and Menie drove it into the ice with all his might. Slowly Kesshoo drew the line taut, turned his kyak round, and started for the shore. The journey out had been dangerous, but the journey back was much more so, for Kesshoo could not dodge the floating ice nearly so well. He had to pick his way carefully through the clearest water he could find. Very cautiously they moved toward shore.   V.  They were getting quite near the place where the ice had broken with Menie, when suddenly, right near them, they saw the head and great, round eyes of a seal! It was the seal mother.  She had come back to find her breathing hole and her baby.  The moment Kesshoo saw her he seized his dart, which lay in its place on top of his kyak, and threw it with all his might at the seal.  The seal dived down into the sea, but a bladder full of air was attached to the line on the dart, and this bladder floated on the water, so Kesshoo could tell by watching it just where the seal was.  Kesshoo knew he had struck the seal, and although he was already towing the ice raft, he was determined to bring home the big seal, too!  He called to Menie. \"Sit still and wait until I come for you.\"  Then he quickly cut the harpoon line by which he was towing the ice raft, and set it adrift again. As soon as he was free he paddled away after the bladder, which was now bobbing along over the water at some little distance from the boat.  Menie sat perfectly still and watched his father. Kesshoo reached the bladder and began to pull on the line, but just at that moment the big seal turned round and swam right under the kyak!  In a second the kyak turned bottom side up in the water! Menie screamed. The people watching on the shore gave a great howl, and Koko's father started up the beach after his own kyak.  He thought perhaps Kesshoo could not manage both the ice raft and the seal, and he meant to go to help him.  But in one second Kesshoo was right side up again. No water could get into the kyak because Kesshoo's skin coat was drawn tight over the hole in the deck, and Kesshoo was in the coat!  Kesshoo often turned somersaults in the water in that way. Sometimes he even did it for fun! He said afterward that he could have turned the boat right side up again with just his nose, without using either his paddle or his arms, if only his nose had been a little bigger, and though he meant this for a joke, the twins believed that he really could do it.  The moment he was right side up again, Kesshoo gave chase once more to the bladder. The seal was very weak now, and Kesshoo knew that it would soon come to the surface and float and that then he could tow it in.  He had not long to wait. The bladder bobbed about for a while and then was still. Kesshoo drew up the line, and paddled back to the ice raft, towing the big seal after him.  \"Catch this,\" he said to Menie. He threw him the end of the line. \"Wind the line six times round the harpoon,\" he said, \"and hold tight to the end of it.\"  Menie did as he was told. Then Kesshoo tied together the two ends of the harpoon line, which he had cut, and began to tow the ice raft back to share again.  Menie kept tight hold of the other line and towed the seal!  Kesshoo paddled slowly and carefully along, until at last there was only a little strip of water between the kyak and the solid ice.  But how in the world could Menie get across that strip of water to safety?  The kyak was between him and the solid ice, and Menie could not possibly get into the kyak. Neither could he swim. But Kesshoo knew a way.  He came up closer to the solid ice. Then he gave a great sweep with his paddle and lifted his kyak right up on to it. He sprang out, and, seizing the harpoon line, pulled Menie's raft close up to the edge of the firm ice.  Menie was still holding tight to the line that held the big seal. Kesshoo threw him another line. Menie caught the end of it.  \"Now tie the big seal's line fast to that,\" Kesshoo said. Menie was a very small boy, but he knew how to tie knots. He did just what his father told him to.  \"Now,\" said his father, \"pull up the harpoon.\" Menie did so. \"Tie the harpoon line to the little seal.\" Menie did that. \"Now throw the harpoon to me,\" commanded Kesshoo.  Menie threw it with all his might. His father caught it, and stood on the firm ice, holding in his hands the line that the big seal was tied to, and the harpoon, with its line fastened to the little seal.  \"Now hold on to the little seal, and I will pull you right up against the solid ice, and when I say 'Jump,' you jump,\" said Kesshoo.  Slowly and very, carefully he pulled, until the raft grated against the solid ice.  \"Jump!\" shouted Kesshoo.  Menie jumped. The ice raft gave a lurch that nearly sent him into the water, but Kesshoo caught him and pulled him to safety.  A great shout of joy went up"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3774"],["title","The Eskimo Twins (#8)"],["body","the shore, and Menie was glad enough to shout too when he felt solid ice under his feet once more!  While he helped his father pull in the little seal, all the people came running out on to the ice to meet them, but Kesshoo sent back every one except Koko's father. He was afraid the ice might break again with so many people on it. Koko's father helped pull the big seal out of the water and over the ice to the beach.  Menie dragged his own little seal after him by the harpoon line, and when he came near the beach, the people all cried out, \"See the great hunter with his game!\" And Koolee was so glad to see Menie and so proud of her boy that she nearly burst with joy!  \"I knew the charm would work,\" she cried. \"Not only does he spy bears--he kills seals! And he only five years old!\"  She put her arms around him and pressed her flat nose to his. That's the Eskimo way of kissing.  Menie tried to look as if he killed seals and got carried away on an ice pan every day in the week, but inside he felt very proud, too.  When Kesshoo and Koko's father came up with the big seal, Koolee and the other women dragged it to the village, where it was skinned and cut up. Every one had a piece of raw blubber to eat at once, and the very first piece went to Menie.  While they were eating it, Koko came back. He had gone so far up the shore hunting little auks that he hadn't seen a thing that had happened. And he hadn't killed any little auks either.  Koko felt that things were very unequally divided in this world. He wanted to kill a seal and get lost on a raft and be a hero too.  But Koolee gave him a large piece of blubber, and that made him feel much more cheerful again. He just said to Monnie, \"If I had been with Menie, this never would have happened! I should not have let him get so near the edge of the ice! But then, you know, I am six, and he is only five, so, of course, he didn't know any better.\"  Everybody in the village had seal meat that night, and the Angakok had the head, which they all thought was the best part. He said he didn't feel very well, and his Tornak had told him nothing would cure him so quickly as a seal's head. So Koolee gave it to him.  The skin of the little white seal Koolee saved and dressed very carefully. She chewed it, all over, on the wrong side, and sucked out all the blubber, and made it soft and fine as velvet; and when that was done, she made out of it two beautiful pairs of white mittens for the twins.     VIII.  THE WOMAN-BOATS  THE WOMAN-BOATS  I.   During the long, dark hours of the winter Kesshoo found many pleasant things to do at home. He was always busy. He carved a doll for Monnie out of the ivory tusk of a walrus.  Monnie named the doll Annadore, and she loved it dearly. Koolee dressed Annadore in fur, with tiny kamiks of sealskin, and Monnie carried her doll in her hood, just the way Koko's mother carried her baby.  For Menie, his father made dog harnesses out of walrus hide. He made them just the right size for Nip and Tup.  Menie harnessed the little dogs to his sled. Then he and Monnie would play sledge journeys. Annadore would sit on the sled all wrapped in furs, while Menie drove the dogs, and Monnie followed after.  Nip and Tup did not like this play very well, and they didn't always go where they were told to. Once they dashed right over the igloo and spilled Annadore off.  Annadore rolled down one side of the igloo, while Nip and Tup galloped down the other. Annadore was buried in the snow and had to be dug out, so it was quite a serious accident, you see, but Nip and Tup did not seem to feel at all responsible about it.  Kesshoo made knives and queer spoons out of bone or ivory for Koolee, and for himself he made new barbs for his bladder-dart, new bone hooks for fishlines, and all sorts of things for hunting.  He made salmon spears, and bird darts, and fishlines, and he ornamented his weapons with little pictures or patterns. He carved two frogs on the handle of his snow knife, and scratched the picture of a walrus on the blade.  Sometimes Koolee carved things, too, but most of the time she was busy making coats or kamiks, or chewing skins to make them soft and fine for use in the igloo; or to cover the kyaks, or to make their summer tent.  Once during the winter the whole family went thirty miles up the coast by moonlight to visit Koolee's brother in another village. They went with the dog sledge, and it took them two days.  They had meat and blubber with them and plenty of warm skins, and when they got tired, Kesshoo made a snow house for them to rest in. The twins thought this was the best fun of all.   II.  When spring came on, there were other things to do. As the days grew longer, the ice in the bay cracked and broke into small pieces and floated away.  The water turned deep blue, and danced in the sunlight, and ice floated about in it. Often there were walrus on these ice-pans.  The twins sometimes saw their huge black bodies on the white ice, and heard their hoarse barks. Then all the men in the village would rush for their kyaks and set out after the walrus.  The men were brave and enjoyed the dangerous sport, but the women used to watch anxiously until they saw the kyaks coming home towing the walrus behind them.  Then they would rush down to the shore, help pull the kyaks up on the beach, where they cut the walrus in pieces and divided it among the families of the hunters.  When the snow had melted on the Big Rock, hundreds of sea-birds made their nests there and filled the air with their cries.  Sometimes Kesshoo went egg hunting on the cliff, and sometimes he set traps there for foxes, and he helped Menie and Koko make a little trap to catch hares. There was plenty to do in every season of the year.  At last the nights shortened to nothing at all. The long day had begun. The stone but, which they had found so comfortable in winter, seemed dark and damp now.  Menie and Monnie remembered the summer days when they did not have to dive down through a hole to get into their house, so Menie said to Monnie one day, \"Let's go and ask father if it isn't time to put up the tents.\"  They ran out to find him. He was down on the beach talking with Koko's father and the other men of the village.  On the beach were two very long boats. The men were looking them over carefully to see if they were water tight.  Koko was with the men. When he saw the twins coming, he tore up the slope to meet them, waving his arms and shouting, \"They're getting out the woman-boats! They're getting out the woman-boats!\"  This was glorious news to the twins. They ran down to the beach with Koko as fast as their legs could carry them.  They got there just in time to hear Koko's father say to Kesshoo, \"I think it's safe to start. The ice is pretty well out of the bay, and the reindeer will be coming down to the fiords after fresh moss.\"  All the men listened to hear what Kesshoo would say, and the twins listened, too, with all their ears.  \"If it's clear, I think we could start after one more sleep,\" said Kesshoo.   III.  The twins didn't wait to hear any more. They flew for home, and dashed down the tunnel and up into the room.  Koolee was gathering all the knives and spoons and fishing-things and sewing things, and dumping them into a large musk-ox hide which was spread on the floor.  The musk-ox hide covered the entrance hole. The first thing Koolee knew something thumped the musk-ox skin on the under side, and the knives and thimbles and needle cases and other things flew in all directions. Up through the hole popped the faces of Menie and Monnie!  \"Oh, Mother,\" they shouted. \"We're going off on the woman-boats! After only one more sleep, if it's pleasant! Father said so!\"  Koolee laughed. \"I know it!\" she said. \"I was just packing. You can help me. There's a lot to do to get ready.\"  The twins were delighted to help. They got together all their own treasures--the sled, and the fishing rods, the dog harnesses, and Annadore, and bound them up with walrus thongs. All but Annadore. Annadore rode in Monnie's hood as usual.  Koolee gathered all her things together again and wrapped them in the musk-ox hide. She took down the long narwhal tusks that the dog harnesses were hung on.  These were the tent poles. She and the twins carried all these things to the beach. The men stayed on the beach and packed the things away in the boats. The other women brought down their bundles from their igloos. There was room for everything in the two big boats.  Only the skins were left on the sleeping bench in the hut. When everything else was ready, Koolee and the twins went up on top of the igloo.  They pulled the moss and dirt out of the chinks between the stones that made the roof, and then Koolee pulled up the stones themselves and let them fall over to one side. This left the roof open to the sky.  \"What makes you do that?\" Menie asked.  \"So the sun and rain can clean house for us,\" said Koolee.  Everybody else in the village got ready in the same way.  At last Kesshoo came up from the beach and said to Koolee, \"Let us have some meat and a sleep and then we will start. Everything is ready. The boats are packed and it looks as if the weather would be clear.\"  Koolee brought out some walrus meat and blubber for supper, though it might just as well be called breakfast, for there was no night coming, and the twins ate theirs sitting on the roof of the igloo with their feet hanging down inside.  Once Menie's feet kicked his father's head. It was an accident, but Kesshoo reached up and took hold of Menie's foot and pulled him down on to the sleeping bench and rolled him over among the skins.  \"Crawl in there and go to sleep,\" he said.  Monnie let herself down through the roof by her hands and crept in beside Menie. Then Kesshoo and Koolee wrapped themselves in the warm skins and lay down, too.  It took Menie and Monnie some time to go to sleep, for they could look straight up through the roof at the sky, and"]]]
