The dear old gentleman was very kind, told Phil he was satisfied with the success of his probation, that he should see Laura when he liked, and, if all went well, should receive his reward in the spring. It must be a delightful sensation to know you have made a fellow-creature as happy as those words made Phil to-night.\"  John paused, and looked musingly at the matronly tea-pot, as if he saw a wondrous future in its shine.  Nan twinkled off the drops that rose at the thought of Laura's joy, and said, with grateful warmth,--  \"You say nothing of your own share in the making of that happiness, John; but we know it, for Philip has told Laura in his letters all that you have been to him, and I am sure there was other eloquence beside his own before father granted all you say he has.  Oh, John, I thank you very much for this!\"  Mrs. Lord beamed a whole midsummer of delight upon her son, as she saw the pleasure these words gave him, though he answered simply,--  \"I only tried to be a brother to him, Nan; for he has been most kind to me.  Yes, I said my little say to-night, and gave my testimony in behalf of the prisoner at the bar; a most merciful judge pronounced his sentence, and he rushed straight to Mrs. Leigh's to tell Laura the blissful news. Just imagine the scene when he appears, and how Di will open her wicked eyes and enjoy the spectacle of the dishevelled lover, the bride-elect's tears, the stir, and the romance of the thing. She'll cry over it to-night, and caricature it to-morrow.\"  And John led the laugh at the picture he had conjured up, to turn the thoughts of Di's dangerous sister from himself.  At ten Nan retired into the depths of her old bonnet with a far different face from the one she brought out of it, and John, resuming his hat, mounted guard.  \"Don't stay late, remember, John!\" And in Mrs. Lord's voice there was a warning tone that her son interpreted aright.  \"I'll not forget, mother.\"  And he kept his word; for though Philip's happiness floated temptingly before him, and the little figure at his side had never seemed so dear, he ignored the bland winds, the tender night, and set a seal upon his lips, thinking manfully within himself. \"I see many signs of promise in her happy face; but I will wait and hope a little longer for her sake.\"  \"Where is father, Sally?\" asked Nan, as that functionary appeared, blinking owlishly, but utterly repudiating the idea of sleep.  \"He went down the garding, miss, when the gentlemen cleared, bein' a little flustered by the goin's on.  Shall I fetch him in?\" asked Sally, as irreverently as if her master were a bag of meal.  \"No, we will go ourselves.\" And slowly the two paced down the leaf-strewn walk.  Fields of yellow grain were waving on the hill-side, and sere corn blades rustled in the wind, from the orchard came the scent of ripening fruit, and all the garden-plots lay ready to yield up their humble offerings to their master's hand.  But in the silence of the night a greater Reaper had passed by, gathering in the harvest of a righteous life, and leaving only tender memories for the gleaners who had come so late.  The old man sat in the shadow of the tree his own hands planted; its fruit boughs shone ruddily, and its leaves still whispered the low lullaby that hushed him to his rest.  \"How fast he sleeps! Poor father! I should have come before and made it pleasant for him.\"  As she spoke, Nan lifted up the head bent down upon his breast, and kissed his pallid cheek.  \"Oh, John, this is not sleep.\"  \"Yes, dear, the happiest he will ever know.\"  For a moment the shadows flickered over three white faces and the silence deepened solemnly. Then John reverently bore the pale shape in, and Nan dropped down beside it, saying, with a rain of grateful tears,--  \"He kissed me when I went, and said a last good-night!'\"  For an hour steps went to and fro about her, many voices whispered near her, and skilful hands touched the beloved clay she held so fast; but one by one the busy feet passed out, one by one the voices died away, and human skill proved vain.  Then Mrs. Lord drew the orphan to the shelter of her arms, soothing her with the mute solace of that motherly embrace.  \"Nan, Nan! here's Philip! come and see!\" The happy call re-echoed through the house, and Nan sprang up as if her time for grief were past.  \"I must tell them. Oh, my poor girls, how will they bear it?--they have known so little sorrow!\"  But there was no need for her to speak; other lips had spared her the hard task.  For, as she stirred to meet them, a sharp cry rent the air, steps rang upon the stairs, and two wild-eyed creatures came into the hush of that familiar room, for the first time meeting with no welcome from their father's voice.  With one impulse, Di and Laura fled to Nan, and the sisters clung together in a silent embrace, more eloquent than words. John took his mother by the hand, and led her from the room, closing the door upon the sacredness of grief.  \"Yes, we are poorer than we thought; but when everything is settled, we shall get on very well.  We can let a part of this great house, and live quietly together until spring; then Laura will be married, and Di can go on their travels with them, as Philip wishes her to do.  We shall be cared for; so never fear for us, John.\"  Nan said this, as her friend parted from her a week later, after the saddest holiday he had ever known.  \"And what becomes of you, Nan?\" he asked, watching the patient eyes that smiled when others would have wept.  \"I shall stay in the dear old house; for no other place would seem like home to me.  I shall find some little child to love and care for, and be quite happy till the girls come back and want me.\"  John nodded wisely, as he listened, and went away prophesying within himself,--  \"She shall find something more than a child to love; and, God willing, shall be very happy till the girls come home and--cannot have her.\"  Nan's plan was carried into effect.  Slowly the divided waters closed again, and the three fell back into their old life.  But the touch of sorrow drew them closer; and, though invisible, a beloved presence still moved among them, a familiar voice still spoke to them in the silence of their softened hearts.  Thus the soil was made ready, and in the depth of winter the good seed was sown, was watered with many tears, and soon sprang up green with a promise of a harvest for their after years.  Di and Laura consoled themselves with their favorite employments, unconscious that Nan was growing paler, thinner, and more silent, as the weeks went by, till one day she dropped quietly before them, and it suddenly became manifest that she was utterly worn out with many cares and the secret suffering of a tender heart bereft of the paternal love which had been its strength and stay.  \"I'm only tired, dear girls.  Don't be troubled, for I shall be up to-morrow,\" she said cheerily, as she looked into the anxious faces bending over her.  But the weariness was of many months' growth, and it was weeks before that \"to-morrow\" came.  Laura installed herself as nurse, and her devotion was repaid four-fold; for, sitting at her sister's bedside, she learned a finer art than that she had left.  Her eye grew clear to see the beauty of a self-denying life, and in the depths of Nan's meek nature she found the strong, sweet virtues that made her what she was.  Then remembering that these womanly attributes were a bride's best dowry, Laura gave herself to their attainment, that she might become to another household the blessing Nan had been to her own; and turning from the worship of the goddess Beauty, she gave her hand to that humbler and more human teacher, Duty,--learning her lessons with a willing heart, for Philip's sake.  Di corked her inkstand, locked her bookcase, and went at housework as if it were a five-barred gate; of course she missed the leap, but scrambled bravely through, and appeared much sobered by the exercise. Sally had departed to sit under a vine and fig-tree of her own, so Di had undisputed sway; but if dish-pans and dusters had tongues, direful would have been the history of that crusade against frost and fire, indolence and inexperience. But they were dumb, and Di scorned to complain, though her struggles were pathetic to behold, and her sisters went through a series of messes equal to a course of \"Prince Benreddin's\" peppery tarts. Reality turned Romance out of doors; for, unlike her favorite heroines in satin and tears, or helmet and shield, Di met her fate in a big checked apron and dust-cap, wonderful to see; yet she wielded her broom as stoutly as \"Moll Pitcher\" shouldered her gun, and marched to her daily martyrdom in the kitchen with as heroic a heart as the \"Maid of Orleans\" took to her stake.  Mind won the victory over matter in the end, and Di was better all her days for the tribulations and the triumphs of that time; for she drowned her idle fancies in her wash-tub, made burnt-offerings of selfishness and pride, and learned the worth of self-denial, as she sang with happy voice among the pots and kettles of her conquered realm.  Nan thought of John, and in the stillness of her sleepless nights prayed Heaven to keep him safe, and make her worthy to receive and strong enough to bear the blessedness or pain of love.  Snow fell without, and keen winds howled among the leafless elms, but \"herbs of grace\" were blooming beautifully in the sunshine of sincere endeavor, and this dreariest season proved the most fruitful of the year; for love taught Laura, labor chastened Di, and patience fitted Nan for the blessing of her life.  Nature, that stillest, yet most diligent of housewives, began at last that \"spring cleaning\" which she makes so pleasant that none find the heart to grumble as they do when "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3806"],["title","A Modern Cinderella; Or, The Little Old Shoe, and Other Stories (#5)"],["body","matrons set their premises a-dust.  Her hand-maids, wind and rain and sun, swept, washed, and garnished busily, green carpets were unrolled, apple-boughs were hung with draperies of bloom, and dandelions, pet nurslings of the year, came out to play upon the sward.  From the South returned that opera troupe whose manager is never in despair, whose tenor never sulks, whose prima donna never fails, and in the orchard bona fide matinees were held, to which buttercups and clovers crowded in their prettiest spring hats, and verdant young blades twinkled their dewy lorgnettes, as they bowed and made way for the floral belles.  May was bidding June good-morrow, and the roses were just dreaming that it was almost time to wake, when John came again into the quiet room which now seemed the Eden that contained his Eve. Of course there was a jubilee; but something seemed to have befallen the whole group, for never had they appeared in such odd frames of mind.  John was restless, and wore an excited look, most unlike his usual serenity of aspect.  Nan the cheerful had fallen into a well of silence and was not to be extracted by any Hydraulic power, though she smiled like the June sky over her head.  Di's peculiarities were out in full force, and she looked as if she would go off like a torpedo at a touch; but through all her moods there was a half-triumphant, half-remorseful expression in the glance she fixed on John.  And Laura, once so silent, now sang like a blackbird, as she flitted to and fro; but her fitful song was always, \"Philip, my king.\"  John felt that there had come a change upon the three, and silently divined whose unconscious influence had wrought the miracle.  The embargo was off his tongue, and he was in a fever to ask that question which brings a flutter to the stoutest heart; but though the \"man\" had come, the \"hour\" had not.  So, by way of steadying his nerves, he paced the room, pausing often to take notes of his companions, and each pause seemed to increase his wonder and content.  He looked at Nan.  She was in her usual place, the rigid little chair she loved, because it once was large enough to hold a curly-headed playmate and herself.  The old work-basket was at her side, and the battered thimble busily at work; but her lips wore a smile they had never worn before, the color of the unblown roses touched her cheek, and her downcast eyes were full of light.  He looked at Di.  The inevitable book was on her knee, but its leaves were uncut; the strong-minded knob of hair still asserted its supremacy aloft upon her head, and the triangular jacket still adorned her shoulders in defiance of all fashions, past, present, or to come; but the expression of her brown countenance had grown softer, her tongue had found a curb, and in her hand lay a card with \"Potts, Kettel & Co.\" inscribed thereon, which she regarded with never a scornful word for the \"Co.\"  He looked at Laura.  She was before her easel as of old; but the pale nun had given place to a blooming girl, who sang at her work, which was no prim Pallas, but a Clytie turning her human face to meet the sun.  \"John, what are you thinking of?\"  He stirred as if Di's voice had disturbed his fancy at some pleasant pastime, but answered with his usual sincerity,--  \"I was thinking of a certain dear old fairy tale called 'Cinderella.'\"  \"Oh!\" said Di; and her \"Oh\" was a most impressive monosyllable.  \"I see the meaning of your smile now; and though the application of the story is not very complimentary to all parties concerned, it is very just and very true.\"  She paused a moment, then went on with softened voice and earnest mien:--  \"You think I am a blind and selfish creature. So I am, but not so blind and selfish as I have been; for many tears have cleared my eyes, and much sincere regret has made me humbler than I was. I have found a better book than any father's library can give me, and I have read it with a love and admiration that grew stronger as I turned the leaves. Henceforth I take it for my guide and gospel, and, looking back upon the selfish and neglectful past, can only say, Heaven bless your dear heart, Nan!\"  Laura echoed Di's last words; for, with eyes as full of tenderness, she looked down upon the sister she had lately learned to know, saying, warmly,--  \"Yes, 'Heaven bless your dear heart, Nan!' I never can forget all you have been to me; and when I am far away with Philip, there will always be one countenance more beautiful to me than any pictured face I may discover, there will be one place more dear to me than Rome.  The face will be yours, Nan, always so patient, always so serene; and the dearer place will be this home of ours, which you have made so pleasant to me all these years by kindnesses as numberless and noiseless as the drops of dew.\"  \"Dear girls, what have I ever done, that you should love me so?\" cried Nan, with happy wonderment, as the tall heads, black and golden, bent to meet the lowly brown one, and her sisters' mute lips answered her.  Then Laura looked up, saying, playfully,--  \"Here are the good and wicked sisters;-where shall we find the Prince?\"  \"There!\" cried Di, pointing to John; and then her secret went off like a rocket; for, with her old impetuosity, she said,--  \"I have found you out, John, and am ashamed to look you in the face, remembering the past. Girls, you know when father died, John sent us money, which he said Mr. Owen had long owed us and had paid at last? It was a kind lie, John, and a generous thing to do; for we needed it, but never would have taken it as a gift.  I know you meant that we should never find this out; but yesterday I met Mr. Owen returning from the West, and when I thanked him for a piece of justice we had not expected of him, he gruffly told me he had never paid the debt, never meant to pay it, for it was outlawed, and we could not claim a farthing.  John, I have laughed at you, thought you stupid, treated you unkindly; but I know you now, and never shall forget the lesson you have taught me.  I am proud as Lucifer, but I ask you to forgive me, and I seal my real repentance so--and so.\"  With tragic countenance, Di rushed across the room, threw both arms about the astonished young man's neck and dropped an energetic kiss upon his cheek.  There was a momentary silence; for Di finally illustrated her strong-minded theories by crying like the weakest of her sex.  Laura, with \"the ruling passion strong in death,\" still tried to draw, but broke her pet crayon, and endowed her Clytie with a supplementary orb, owing to the dimness of her own.  And Nan sat with drooping eyes, that shone upon her work, thinking with tender pride,--\"They know him now, and love him for his generous heart.\"  Di spoke first, rallying to her colors, though a little daunted by her loss of self-control.  \"Don't laugh, John,--I couldn't help it; and don't think I'm not sincere, for I am,--I am; and I will prove it by growing good enough to be your friend.  That debt must all be paid, and I shall do it; for I'll turn my books and pen to some account, and write stories full of clear old souls like you and Nan; and some one, I know, will like and buy them, though they are not 'works of Shakespeare.' I've thought of this before, have felt I had the power in me; now I have the motive, and now I'll do it.\"  If Di had Proposed to translate the Koran, or build a new Saint Paul's, there would have been many chances of success; for, once moved, her will, like a battering-ram, would knock down the obstacles her wits could not surmount.  John believed in her most heartily, and showed it, as he answered, looking into her resolute face,--  \"I know you will, and yet make us very proud of our 'Chaos,' Di.  Let the money lie, and when you have a fortune, I'll claim it with enormous interest; but, believe me, I feel already doubly repaid by the esteem so generously confessed, so cordially bestowed, and can only say, as we used to years ago,--'Now let's forgive and so forget.\"  But proud Di would not let him add to her obligation, even by returning her impetuous salute; she slipped away, and, shaking off the last drops, answered with a curious mixture of old freedom and new respect,--  \"No more sentiment, please, John.  We know each other now; and when I find a friend, I never let him go.  We have smoked the pipe of peace; so let us go back to our wigwams and bury the feud.  Where were we when I lost my head? and what were we talking about?\"  \"Cinderella and the Prince.\"  As she spoke, John's eye kindled, and, turning, he looked down at Nan, who sat diligently ornamenting with microscopic stitches a great patch going on, the wrong side out.  \"Yes,--so we were; and now taking pussy for the godmother, the characters of the story are well personated,--all but the slipper,\" said Di, laughing, as she thought of the many times they had played it together years ago.  A sudden movement stirred John's frame, a sudden purpose shone in his countenance, and a sudden change befell his voice, as he said, producing from some hiding-place a little wornout shoe,--  \"I can supply the slipper;--who will try it first?\"  Di's black eyes opened wide, as they fell on the familiar object; then her romance-loving nature saw the whole plot of that drama which needs but two to act it. A great delight flushed up into her face, as she promptly took her cue, saying--  \"No need for us to try it, Laura; for it wouldn't fit us, if our feet were as small as Chinese dolls; our parts are played out; therefore 'Exeunt wicked sisters to the music of the wedding-bells.'\"  And pouncing upon the dismayed artist, she swept her out and closed the door with a triumphant bang.  John went to Nan, and, dropping on his knee as reverently as the herald of the fairy tale, he asked, still smiling, but with lips grown tremulous,--  \"Will Cinderella try the little shoe, and--if it fits--go with the Prince?\"  But Nan only covered up her face, weeping happy tears, while all the"]]]
