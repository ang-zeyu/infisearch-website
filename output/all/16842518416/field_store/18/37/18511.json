Without a word, Bindle turned and walked down the flagged path to the gate, and along Fenton Street in the direction of The Yellow Ostrich, leaving behind him a group of interested women, who would find in his tragedy material for a week's gossip.  His customary cheeriness had forsaken him. He realised that he was faced by a domestic crisis that frankly puzzled him--and he was hungry.  As he pushed open the hospitable swing-door of The Yellow Ostrich, he was greeted by a new and even more bewildering phase of the situation.  \"'Ere, Bindle,\" cried an angry voice, \"wot the blinkin' 'ell's your missis up to?\"  \"You may search me,\" was Bindle's lugubrious reply, as he moved across to the bar and ordered a pint of beer, some bread, and \"a bit o' the cheese wot works the lift.\"  \"You was agin us chaps striking,\" continued the speaker who had greeted Bindle on his entrance, a man with a criminal forehead, a loose mouth, and a dirty neck-cloth.  \"Wot's your complaint, mate?\" enquired Bindle indifferently, as he lifted his pewter from the counter, and took a pull that half emptied it of its contents.  \"Wot's your ruddy missis been up to?\" demanded the man aggressively.  \"Look 'ere, 'Enery, ole sport,\" said Bindle quietly, as he wiped his lips with the back of his hand, \"you ain't pretty, an' you ain't good; but try an' keep yer mouth clean when you speaks of Mrs. B. See?\"  A murmur of approval rose from the other men, with whom Bindle was popular and Henry Gilkes was not.  \"Wot's she mean a-goin' round to my missis an' gettin' 'er to bolt me out?\"  \"Bolt you out!\" cried Bindle, with a puzzled expression. \"Wotjer talkin' about?\"  \"When I goes 'ome to dinner,\" was the angry retort, \"there's a ticket on the blinkin' door sayin' my missis 'as struck. I'll strike 'er!\" he added malevolently. \"The lady next door tells me that it's your missis wot done it.\"  For a moment Bindle gazed at his fellow-sufferer, then he smacked his thigh with the air of a man who has just seen a great joke, which for some time has evaded him.  \"'Enery,\" he grinned, \"she's done it to me too.\"  \"Done wot?\" enquired Henry, who, as a Father of the Chapel, felt he was a man of some importance.  \"Locked me out, back _and_ front,\" explained Bindle, enjoying his mate's bewilderment. \"Wot about the solidarity of labour now, ole sport?\" he enquired.  Henry Gilkes had one topic of conversation--\"the solidarity of labour.\" Those who worked with him found it wearisome listening to his views on the bloated capitalist, and how he was to be overcome. They preferred discussing their own betting ventures, and the prospects of the Chelsea and Fulham football teams.  \"Done it to you!\" repeated Gilkes dully. \"Wot she done?\"  \"I jest nipped round to get a bit o' dinner,\" explained Bindle, \"and there was both doors bolted, an' a note a-sayin' that Mrs. B. 'ad struck. Personally, myself, I calls it a lock-out,\" he added with a grin.  Several of his hearers began to manifest signs of uneasiness. They had not been home since early morning.  \"I'll break 'er stutterin' jaw if my missis locks me out,\" growled a heavily-bearded man, known as \"Ruddy Bill\" on account of the intensity of his language.  \"Jest the sort o' thing you would do,\" said Bindle genially. \"You got a sweet nature, Bill, in spite of them whiskers.\"  Ruddy Bill growled something in his beard, while several of the other men drained their pewters and slipped out, intent on discovering whether or no their own domestic bliss were threatened by this new and unexpected danger.  From then on, the public bar of The Yellow Ostrich hummed with angry talk and threats of what would happen if the lords, who there gloried and drank deep, should return to their hearths and find manifestations of rebellion.  Two of the men, who had gone to investigate the state of their own domestic barometers, were back in half an hour with the news that they too had been locked out from home and beauty.  About three o'clock, Ruddy Bill returned, streams of profanity flowing from his lips. Finding himself bolted out, he had broken open the door; but no one was there. Now he was faced with a threat of ejectment from the landlord, who had heard of the wilful damage to his property, plus the cost of a new door.  Several times that afternoon the landlord of The Yellow Ostrich, himself regarded as an epicure in the matter of \"language,\" found it necessary to utter the stereotyped phrase, \"Now gents, if _you_ please,\" which, with him, meant that the talk was becoming unfit for the fo'c'sle of a tramp steamer.   II  Left to herself by the departure of Bindle for The Yellow Ostrich, Mrs. Bindle had, for some time, stood by the dresser deep in thought. She had then wrung-out the house-flannel, emptied the pail, placed them under the sink and once more returned to the dresser. Five minutes' meditation was followed by swift action.  First she took her bonnet from the dresser-drawer, then unhooking a dark brown mackintosh from behind the door, she proceeded to make her outdoor toilet in front of the looking-glass on the mantelpiece.  She then sought out ink-bottle and pen, and wrote her defiance with an ink-eaten nib. This accomplished, she bolted the front-door on the inside, first attaching her strike-notice. Leaving the house by the door giving access to the scullery, she locked it, taking the key with her.  Her face was grim and her walk was determined, as she made her way to the yard at which Bindle was employed. There she demanded to see the manager and, after some difficulty, was admitted.  She began by reproaching him and ordering him to stop the strike. When, however, he had explained that the strike was entirely due to the action of the men, she ended by telling him of her own drastic action, and her determination to continue her strike until the men went back.  The manager surprised her by leaning back in his chair and laughing uproariously.  \"Mrs. Bindle,\" he cried at length, as he wiped the tears from his eyes, \"you're a genius; but I'm sorry for Bindle. Now, do you want to end the strike in a few hours?\"  Mrs. Bindle looked at him suspiciously; but, conscious of the very obvious admiration with which he regarded her act, she relented sufficiently to listen to what he had to say.  Ten minutes later she left the office with a list of the names and addresses of the strikers, including that of the branch organising secretary of the Union. She had decided upon a counter-offensive.  Her first call was upon Mrs. Gilkes, a quiet little woman who had been subdued to meekness by the \"solidarity of labour.\" Here she had to admit failure.  \"I know what you mean, my dear,\" said Mrs. Gilkes; \"but you see, Mr. Gilkes wouldn't like it.\" There was a tremor of fear in her voice.  \"Wouldn't like it!\" echoed Mrs. Bindle. \"Of course he wouldn't like it. Bindle won't like it when he knows,\" her jaws met grimly and her lips disappeared. \"You're afraid,\" she added accusingly.  \"That's it, my dear, I am,\" was the disconcerting reply. \"I never 'ad no 'eart for a fight, that's why Mr. Gilkes 'as come it over me like 'e 'as. My sister, Mary, was sayin' only last Toosday--no it wasn't, it was We'n'sday, I remember because it was the day we 'ad sausages wot Mr. Gilkes said wasn't fresh. 'Amelia,' she says, 'you ain't got the 'eart of a rabbit, or else you wouldn't stand wot you do,'\" and, looking up into Mrs. Bindle's face, she added, \"It's true, Mrs. Gimble, although I didn't own it to Mary, 'er bein' my sister an' so uppish in 'er ways.\"  \"Well, you'll be sorry,\" was Mrs. Bindle's comment, as she turned towards the door. \"I'll be no man's slave.\"  \"You see, I 'aven't the 'eart, Mrs. Gimber.\"  \"Bindle!\" snapped Mrs. Bindle over her shoulder.  \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Spindle, my mistake.\"  Mrs. Bindle stalked along the passage, through the front door and out of the gate, leaving Mrs. Gilkes murmuring deprecatingly that she \"'adn't no 'eart for a fight.\"  Although she would not own it, Mrs. Bindle was discouraged by the failure of her first attempt at strike-breaking. But for her good-fortune in encountering Mrs. Hopton at her second venture, she might even have relinquished the part of Lysistrata and have returned home to prepare Bindle's dinner.  It was with something like misgiving that she knocked at No. 32 Wessels Street. This feeling was accentuated when the door was opened with great suddenness by an enormously big woman with a square chin, fighting eyes, and very little hair.  With arms akimbo, one elbow touching either side of the passage, as if imbued with the sentiments of Horatius Cocles, Mrs. Hopton stood with tightly-shut mouth regarding her caller. As soon as Mrs. Bindle had made her mission known, however, Mrs. Hopton's manner underwent an entire change. Her hands dropped from her hips, her fixed expression relaxed, and she stood invitingly aside.  \"I'm your woman,\" she cried. \"You come in, Mrs.----\"  \"Bindle!\" prompted Mrs. Bindle.  \"You come in, Mrs. Bindle, you got the woman you want in Martha 'Opton. Us women 'ave stood this sort of thing long enough. I've always said so.\"  She led the way into an airless little parlour, in which a case of wax-fruit, a dusty stuffed dog and a clothes-horse hung with the familiarities of Mrs. Hopton's laundry, first struck the eye.  \"I've always said,\" continued Mrs. Hopton, \"that us women was too meek and mild by half in the way we takes things. My man's a fool,\" she added with conviction. \"'E's that easily led by them arbitrators, that's wot I call 'em, that they makes 'im do just wotever they wants, dirty, lazy set o' tykes. Never done a day's work in their lives, they 'aven't, not one of 'em.\"  \"That's what I say,\" cried Mrs. Bindle, for once in her life finding a congenial spirit outside the walls of the Alton Road Chapel. \"I've locked up my house,\" she continued, \"and put a note on the door that I've struck too.\"  The effect of these words upon Mrs. Hopton was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37324"],["title","Mrs. Bindle: Some Incidents from the Domestic Life of the Bindles (#2)"],["body","ing. Her head went back like that of a chicken drinking, her hands rose once more to her hips, and her huge frame shook and pulsated as if it contained a high-power motor-engine. Mrs. Bindle gazed at her with widened eyes.  \"Her-her-her!\" came in deep, liquid gutturals from Mrs. Hopton's lips. \"Her-her-her!\" Then her head came down again, and Mrs. Bindle saw that the grim lips were parted, displaying some very yellow, unprepossessing teeth. Mrs. Hopton was manifesting amusement.  Without further comment, Mrs. Hopton left the room. In her absence, Mrs. Bindle proceeded to sum-up her character from the evidence that her home contained. The result was unfavourable. She had just decided that her hostess was dirty and untidy, without sense of decency or religion, when Mrs. Hopton re-entered. In one hand she carried a piece of paper, in the other a small ink-bottle, out of which an orange-coloured pen-holder reared its fluted length.  Clearing a space on the untidy table, she bent down and, with squared elbows and cramped fingers, proceeded to scrawl the words: \"I have struck too. M. Hopton.\"  Then, straightening herself, she once more threw back her head, and another stream of \"Her-her-her's\" gushed towards the ceiling.  \"Now I'll come with you,\" she said at length. Without waiting to don cloak or bonnet, she proceeded to pin the notice on the front door, which she bolted on the inside. She then left by the scullery door, locking it, just as Mrs. Bindle had done, and carrying with her the key.  Although Mrs. Bindle felt that she suffered socially from being seen with the lumbering, untidy Mrs. Hopton, she regarded it as a sacrifice to a just cause. It was not long, however, before she discovered that she had recruited, not a lieutenant, but a leader.  Seizing the list of names and addresses from her companion's hand, Mrs. Hopton glanced at it and turned in the direction of the street in which lived the timid Mrs. Gilkes. As they walked, Mrs. Bindle told the story of Mrs. Gilkes's cowardice, drawing from the Amazon-like Mrs. Hopton the significant words \"Leave 'er to me.\"  \"Now then, none of this,\" was her greeting to Mrs. Gilkes as she opened her front door. \"Out you comes and joins the strike-breakers. None o' your nonsense or----\" she paused significantly.  Mrs. Gilkes protested her cowardice, she grovelled, she dragged in her sister, Mary, and the wrathful Gilkes; but without avail. Almost before she knew what had happened, she was walking between Mrs. Hopton and Mrs. Bindle, the back-door key clasped in one hand, striving to tie the strings of her bonnet beneath a chin that was obviously too shallow for the purpose. In her heart was a great terror; yet she was conscious of a strange and not unpleasant thrill at the thought of her own daring. She comforted herself with Mrs. Hopton's promise of protection against her lord's anger.  The overpowering personality of Mrs. Hopton was too much for the other wives. The one or two who made a valiant endeavour to stand out were overwhelmed by her ponderous ridicule, which bordered upon intimidation.  \"'Ere, get a pen an' ink,\" she would cry and, before the reluctant housewife knew what had happened, she had announced that she too had struck, and Mrs. Hopton's army had been swelled by another recruit.  At one house they found the husband about to sit down to an early dinner. That gave Mrs. Hopton her chance.  \"You lazy, guzzling, good-for-nothing son of a God-damn loafer!\" she shouted, her deep voice throbbing with passion. \"Call yourself a man? Fine sort of man you are, letting your wife work and slave while you strike and fill your belly with beef and beer. I've seen better things than you thrown down the sink, that I 'ave.\"  At the first attack, the man had risen from the table in bewilderment. As Mrs. Hopton emptied upon him the vials of her anger, he had slowly retreated towards the scullery door. She made a sudden movement in his direction; he turned--wrenched open the door, and fled.  \"I'm sorry to interrupt you, Mrs.----\"  \"Bolton,\" said the neat little woman.  \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Bolton,\" said Mrs. Hopton; \"but we're going to break this 'ere strike, me and Mrs. Bindle and all these other ladies.\" She waved her hand to indicate the army she had already collected.  Then she went on to explain; but Mrs. Bolton was adamant against all her invitations to join the emancipationists.  \"I suppose we got to fight your battle,\" Mrs. Hopton cried, and proceeded to drench her victim with ridicule; but Mrs. Bolton stood fast, and the strike-breakers had to acknowledge defeat.  It was Mrs. Bindle's idea that they should hold a meeting outside the organising secretary's house. The suggestion was acclaimed with enthusiasm.  \"Let's get a tidy few, first,\" counselled Mrs. Hopton. \"It'll make 'im think 'arder.\"  At the end of an hour, even Mrs. Hopton was satisfied with the number of her supporters, and she gave the word for the opening of hostilities.  That afternoon, just as he was rising from an excellent meal, Mr. James Cunham was surprised to find that his neatly-kept front-garden was filled with women, while more women seemed to occupy the street. Neighbours came out, errand-boys called to friends, that they might not miss the episode, children paused on their way to school; all seemed to realise the dramatic possibilities of the situation.  Mrs. Hopton played a fugue upon Mr. Cunham's knocker, bringing him to the door in person.  \"Well, monkey-face,\" she boomed. There was a scream of laughter from her followers.  Mr. Cunham started back as if he had been struck.  \"Want to starve us, do you?\" continued Mrs. Hopton.  \"What's all this about?\" he enquired, recovering himself. He was a man accustomed to handling crowds, even unfriendly crowds; but never had he encountered anything like the cataract of wrathful contumely that now poured from Mrs. Hopton's lips.  \"Just 'ad a good dinner, I suppose,\" she cried scornfully. \"Been enjoyin' it, eh? Cut from the joint and two vegs, puddin' to follow, with a glass of stout to wash it down. That the meenyou, eh? What does it cost you when our men strike? Do you 'ave to keep 'alf a dozen bellies full on a pound a week?\"  There was a murmur from the women behind her, a murmur that Mr. Cunham did not like.  \"Nice little 'ouse you got 'ere,\" continued Mrs. Hopton critically, as she peered into the neat and well-furnished hall. \"All got out o' strikes,\" she added over her shoulder to her companions. \"All got on the do-nothin'-at-all-easy-purchase-system.\"  This time there was no mistaking the menace in the murmur from the women behind her.  \"You're a beauty, you are,\" continued Mrs. Hopton. \"Not much sweat about your lily brow, Mr. Funny Cunham.\"  Mr. Cunham felt that the time had come for action.  \"What's the meaning of this?\" he demanded. \"Why have you come here, and who are you?\"  \"Who are we?\" cried Mrs. Hopton scornfully. \"He asks who we are,\" she threw over her shoulder.  Again there was an angry murmur from the rank and file.  \"We're the silly fools wot married the men you brought out on strike,\" said Mrs. Hopton, looking the organising secretary up and down as if he were on show. \"Creases in 'is trousers, too,\" she cried. \"You ain't 'alf a swell. Well, we just come to tell you that the strike's orf, because we've struck. Get me, Steve?\"  \"We've declared a lock-out,\" broke in Mrs. Bindle with inspiration.  Back went Mrs. Hopton's head, up went her hands to her hips, and deep-throated \"Her-her-her's\" poured from her parted lips.  \"A lock-out!\" she cried. \"Her-her-her, a lock-out! That's the stuff to give 'em!\" and the rank and file took up the cry and, out of the plenitude of his experience, Mr. Cunham recognised that the crowd was hopelessly out of hand.  \"Are we down-hearted?\" cried a voice, and the shrieks of \"No!\" that followed confirmed Mr. Cunham in his opinion that the situation was not without its serious aspect.  He was not a coward and he stood his ground, listening to Mrs. Hopton's inspiring oratory of denunciation. It was three o'clock before he saw his garden again--a trampled waste; an offering to the Moloch of strikes.  \"Damn the woman!\" he cried, as, shutting the door, he returned to the room he used as an office, there to deliberate upon this new phase of the situation. \"Curse her!\"   III  It was nearly half-past ten that night when Bindle tip-toed up the tiled-path leading to the front door of No. 7 Fenton Street.  Softly he inserted his key in the lock and turned it; but the door refused to give. He stepped back to gaze up at the bedroom window; there was no sign of a light.  It suddenly struck him that the piece of paper on the door was not the same in shape as that he had seen at dinner-time. It was too dark to see if there was anything written on it. Taking a box of matches from his pocket, he struck a light, shielding it carefully so that it should shine only on the paper.  His astonishment at what he read caused him to forget the lighted match, which burnt his fingers.  \"Well, I'm blowed!\" he muttered. \"If this ain't it,\" and once more he read the sinister notice:       \"You have struck. We women have declared a lock-out.       \"E. BINDLE.\"  After a few minutes' cogitation, he tip-toed down the path and round to the back of the house; but the scullery door was inflexible in its inhospitality.  He next examined the windows. Each was securely fastened.  \"Where'm I goin' to sleep?\" he muttered, as once more he tip-toed up the path.  After a further long deliberation, he lifted the knocker, gave three gentle taps--and waited. As nothing happened, he tried four taps of greater strength. These, in turn, produced no response. Then he gave a knock suggestive of a telegraph boy, or a registered letter. At each fresh effort he stepped back to get a view of the bedroom window.  He fancied that the postman-cum-telegraph-boy's knock had produced a slight fluttering of the curtain. He followed it up with something that might have"]]]
