How softly the turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue—he could no longer feel the roadway beneath his feet!  Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene—perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have traveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him. At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how beautiful she is! He springs forwards with extended arms. As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon—then all is darkness and silence!  Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3750"],["title","Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 2 (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team of Charles Franks.      Letters of Franz Liszt, Volume 2: \"From Rome to the End\"  by Franz Liszt; letters collected by La Mara and translated by Constance Bache     CONTENTS    BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH FRONTISPIECE TO VOLUME II, HONORING LISZT TABLE OF LETTER CONTENTS THE LETTERS OF FRANZ LISZT, VOL. 2 INFO ABOUT THIS E-TEXT EDITION    BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH    The Austrio-Hungarian composer Franz Liszt (1811-1886) was a pianistic miracle. He could play anything on site and composed over 400 works centered around \"his\" instrument. Among his key works are his Hungarian Rhapsodies, his Transcendental Etudes, his Concert Etudes, his Etudes based on variations of Paganinini's Violin Caprices and his Sonata, one of the most important of the nineteenth century. He also wrote thousands of letters, of which 399 are translated into English in this second of a 2-volume set of letters (the first volume contains 260 letters).  Those who knew him were struck by his extremely sophisticated personality. He was surely one of the most civilized people of the nineteeth century, internalizing within himself a complex conception of human civility, and attempting to project it in his music and his communications with people. His life was centered around people; he knew them, worked with them, remembered them, thought about them, and wrote about them using an almost poetic language, while pushing them to reflect the high ideals he believed in. His personality was the embodiment of a refined, idealized form of human civility. He was the consummate musical artist, always looking for ways to communicate a new civilized idea through music, and to work with other musicians in organizing concerts and gatherings to perform the music publicly. He also did as much as he could to promote and compliment those whose music he believed in.  He was also a superlative musical critic, knowing, with few mistakes, what music of his day was \"artistic\" and what was not. But, although he was clearly a musical genius, he insisted on projecting a tonal, romantic \"beauty\" in his music, confining his music to a narrow range of moral values and ideals. He would have rejected 20th-century music that entertained cynical notions of any kind, or notions that obviated the concept of beauty in any way. There is little of a Prokofiev, Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Cage, Adams, and certainly none of a Schoenberg, in Liszt's music. His music has an ideological \"ceiling,\" and that ceiling is \"beauty.\" It never goes beyond that. And perhaps it was never as \"beautiful\" as the music of Mozart, Bach or Beethoven, nor quite as rational (Are all the emotions in Liszt's music truly \"controlled?\"). But it certainly was original and instructive, and it certainly will linger.    FRONTISPIECE TO VOLUME II, HONORING LISZT   I.  We welcome thee, from southern sunnier clime, To England's shore, And stretch glad hands across the lapse of time To the once more.  II.  Full twice two decades swiftly have rolled by Since thou wast here; A meteor flashing through our northern sky Thou didst appear.  III.  Thy coming now we greet with pleasure keen, And loyal heart, Adding tradition of what thou hast been To what thou art.  IV.  No laurel can we weave into the crown Long years entwine, Nor add one honour into the renown Already thine:  V.  Yet might these roses waft to thee a breath Of memory, Recalling thy fair Saint Elizabeth Of Hungary  VI.  We welcome her, from out those days of old, In song divine, But thee we greet a thousand fold, The song is thine!  --C.B.  [Presumably written by Constance Bache, this trite paean would likely not have appealed to Liszt, who repeatedly affirmed his humility.]    TABLE OF LETTER CONTENTS (LETTER NUMBER, FOLLOWED BY ADDRESSEE)    1.
