It will be noted that I have indicated most separations as having taken place in interglacial ages. They are generally regarded as periods of warmth and aridity and, therefore, probably are times of segmentation of the ranges of boreal mammals and hence times exceptionally favorable to the process of speciation. Glacial ages, characterized by extensive and continuous areas of boreal habitat, probably were times of relatively unrestricted gene flow between many populations of boreal mammals and hence not favorable to rapid speciation.   =Sorex vagrans=  Wandering Shrew  The size of the wandering shrew varies from small in the subspecies _monticola_ and _vagrans_ to large in the subspecies _pacificus_. The tail makes up from a little more than a third to almost half of the total length. The color pattern ranges from tricolored through bicolored to almost monocolored. Color ranges from reddish (Sayal or Snuff Brown) to grayish in summer pelage and from black to light gray in winter. Diagnostic dental characters include: 3rd upper unicuspid smaller than 4th, and unicuspids, except 5th, with a pigmented ridge extending from near apex of each tooth medially to cingulum and sometimes ending as internal cusplet. _S. vagrans_ differs from members of the _ornatus_ group in less flattened skull, and in more ventrally situated foramen magnum that encroaches more on the basioccipital and less on the supraoccipital. The wandering shrew differs from _S. trowbridgii_ and _S. saussurei_ in the dental characters mentioned above. These dental characters also serve to distinguish _S. vagrans_ readily from _S. cinereus_, _S. merriami_, and _S. arcticus_ which may occur with _vagrans_. The large marsh shrew and water shrew, _S. palustris_ and _S. bendiri_, can be distinguished at a glance from _S. vagrans_ by larger size and darker color.     [Illustration: FIG. 15. Diagrammatic representation of the       probable phylogeny of _Sorex vagrans_ and its near relatives.]  In the following treatment of the 29 subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_, the subspecies are arranged in geographic sequence, beginning with the southernmost large subspecies on the California coast and proceeding clockwise, north, east, south, and then west back to the starting point.   =Sorex vagrans sonomae= Jackson      _Sorex pacificus sonomae_ Jackson, Jour.

Washington, 31:127,     November 29, 1918.      _Sorex pacificus yaquinae_, V. Bailey, N. Amer. Fauna, 55:364,     August 29, 1936.  _Type._--Adult female, skin and skull; No. 73051 U. S. Biol. Surv. Coll., obtained on July 18, 1895, by B. J. Bretherton, from Yaquina Bay, Lincoln Co., Oregon.  _Diagnosis._--Size large for the species; average and extreme external measurements of 11 specimens from Oakridge, Lane Co., Oregon, are: total length, 125.3 (11-136); tail, 55.1 (49-61); hind foot, 14.9 (14-16). Color reddish in summer, browner or grayer in winter.  _Comparisons._--See account of _S. v. pacificus_ for comparison with that subspecies. Larger and more reddish than _S. v. bairdi_ with which it intergrades to the north and east. Much larger and more reddish than the sympatric _S. v. vagrans_.  _Remarks._--The name _yaquinae_ actually applies to a population of intergrades between _pacificus_ and _bairdi_. There is much variation over the range of the subspecies, and individuals from the western and southern parts are larger than those from the west slope of the Cascades. Specimens from Vida and McKenzie Bridge are smaller than those from Mapleton, Mercer, and the type locality but still seem closer to _yaquinae_ than to topotypes of _bairdi_. Between Marshfield and Umpqua on the one hand, and the Columbia River and the Cascade Mountains on the other, the size of _Sorex vagrans_ decreases quite rapidly from the large_ pacificus_ to the smaller _permiliensis_. Size decreases less rapidly northward along the coast than it does eastward toward the mountains; consequently, at any given latitude, coastal shrews are larger than mountain shrews. In this area of rapid change in size it is difficult to draw subspecific boundaries between _pacificus_, _yaquinae_, and _bairdi_, and this must be done somewhat arbitrarily.  Jackson (1928:141) remarked upon the possibility that intergradation between _pacificus_ and _yaquinae_ took place. He noted also the close resemblance between _yaquinae_ and _bairdi_, and stated (_loc. cit._) that specific affinity between the two might be demonstrated with more specimens. He had a series of eight specimens from Vida, Oregon, seven of which he assigned to _S. o. bairdi_ and one to _yaquinae_. I have examined these specimens and find no more variation between the largest and the smallest than would be expected in any normally variable series of shrews. Vernon Bailey (1936:364) arranged _yaquinae_ as a subspecies of _pacificus_ without giving his reasons for so doing.  _Specimens examined._--Total number, 65.

Elliott from Happy Lake, Olympic Mts., Clallam Co., Washington.  _Range._--Washington from the Cascades west; southwestern British Columbia west of 120° W Longitude north to Lund.  _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the species; average and extreme measurements of 20 specimens from the Olympic Mountains, Washington, are: total length, 117.3 (107-125); tail, 49.8 (41-54); hind foot, 13.4 (12-14). Color dark in both summer and winter.  _Comparisons._--For comparison with _permiliensis_ see account of that subspecies. Darker, longer-tailed, and somewhat larger cranially than _S. v. obscurus_ with which it intergrades in southwestern British Columbia. Smaller in all dimensions, but much the same color as _S. v. longicauda_ with which it intergrades along the British Columbian coast north of Lund. Larger, darker, less reddish, and longer-tailed than the sympatric _S. v. vagrans_.  _Remarks._--_S. v. setosus_ lives mostly in forests. According to Dalquest (1948:139) it is commonest at high altitudes in western Washington. In the Hudsonian Life-zone where shrew habitat is more restricted and marginal than it is at lower altitudes in the humid part of Washington, _setosus_ might be expected to compete with _S. v. vagrans_ and to supplant it. Records of occurrence in the Olympic Mountains suggest a degree of such separation there.  _Specimens examined._--Total number, 135.
