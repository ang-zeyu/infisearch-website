One summer morning, when the air was full of country sounds, of mowers in the meadow, black-birds by the brook, and the low of kine upon the hill-side, the old house wore its cheeriest aspect, and a certain humble history began.  \"Nan!\"  \"Yes, Di.\"  And a head, brown-locked, blue-eyed, soft-featured, looked in at the open door in answer to the call.  \"Just bring me the third volume of 'Wilhelm Meister,' there's a dear. It's hardly worth while to rouse such a restless ghost as I, when I'm once fairly laid.\"  As she spoke, Di PUlled up her black braids, thumped the pillow of the couch where she was lying, and with eager eyes went down the last page of her book.  \"Nan!\"  \"Yes, Laura,\" replied the girl, coming back with the third volume for the literary cormorant, who took it with a nod, still too content upon the \"Confessions of a Fair Saint\" to remember the failings of a certain plain sinner.  \"Don't forget the Italian cream for dinner. I depend upon it; for it's the only thing fit for me this hot weather.\"  And Laura, the cool blonde, disposed the folds of her white gown more gracefully about her, and touched up the eyebrow of the Minerva she was drawing.  \"Little daughter!\"  \"Yes, father.\"  \"Let me have plenty of clean collars in my bag, for I must go at once; and some of you bring me a glass of cider in about an hour;--I shall be in the lower garden.\"  The old man went away into his imaginary paradise, and Nan into that domestic purgatory on a summer day,--the kitchen.  There were vines about the windows, sunshine on the floor, and order everywhere; but it was haunted by a cooking-stove, that family altar whence such varied incense rises to appease the appetite of household gods, before which such dire incantations are pronounced to ease the wrath and woe of the priestess of the fire, and about which often linger saddest memories of wasted temper, time, and toil.  Nan was tired, having risen with the birds,--hurried, having many cares those happy little housewives never know,--and disappointed in a hope that hourly \"dwindled, peaked, and pined.\" She was too young to make the anxious lines upon her forehead seem at home there, too patient to be burdened with the labor others should have shared, too light of heart to be pent up  when earth and sky were keeping a blithe holiday. But she was one of that meek sisterhood who, thinking humbly of themselves, believe they are honored by being spent in the service of less conscientious souls, whose careless thanks seem quite reward enough.  To and fro she went, silent and diligent, giving the grace of willingness to every humble or distasteful task the day had brought her; but some malignant sprite seemed to have taken possession of her kingdom, for rebellion broke out everywhere. The kettles would boil over most obstreperously,--the mutton refused to cook with the meek alacrity to be expected from the nature of a sheep,--the stove, with unnecessary warmth of temper, would glow like a fiery furnace,--the irons would scorch,--the linens would dry,--and spirits would fail, though patience never.  Nan tugged on, growing hotter and wearier, more hurried and more hopeless, till at last the crisis came; for in one fell moment she tore her gown, burnt her hand, and smutched the collar she was preparing to finish in the most unexceptionable style.  Then, if she had been a nervous woman, she would have scolded; being a gentle girl, she only \"lifted up her voice and wept.\"  \"Behold, she watereth her linen with salt tears, and bewaileth herself because of much tribulation. But, lo! Help cometh from afar: a strong man bringeth lettuce wherewith to stay her, plucketh berries to comfort her withal, and clasheth cymbals that she may dance for joy.\"  The voice came from the porch, and, with her hope fulfilled, Nan looked up to greet John Lord, the house-friend, who stood there with a basket on his arm; and as she saw his honest eyes, kind lips, and helpful hands, the girl thought this plain young man the comeliest, most welcome sight she had beheld that day.  \"How good of you, to come through all this heat, and not to laugh at my despair!\" she said, looking up like a grateful child, as she led him in.  \"I only obeyed orders, Nan; for a certain dear old lady had a motherly presentiment that you had got into a domestic whirlpool, and sent me as a sort of life-preserver. So I took the basket of consolation, and came to fold my feet upon the carpet of contentment in the tent of friendship.\"  As he spoke, John gave his own gift in his mother's name, and bestowed himself in the wide window-seat, where morning-glories nodded at him, and the old butternut sent pleasant shadows dancing to and fro.  His advent, like that of Orpheus in hades, seemed to soothe all unpropitious powers with a sudden spell. The Fire began to slacken, the kettles began to lull, the meat began to cook, the irons began to cool, the clothes began to behave, the spirits began to rise, and the collar was finished off with most triumphant success.  John watched the change, and, though a lord of creation, abased himself to take compassion on the weaker vessel, and was seized with a great desire to lighten the homely tasks that tried her strength of body and soul.  He took a comprehensive glance about the room; then, extracting a dish from he closet, proceeded to imbrue his hands in the strawberries' blood.  \"Oh,  John, you needn't do that; I shall have time when I've turned the meat, made the pudding and done these things.  See, I'm getting on finely now:--you're a judge of such matters; isn't that nice?\"  As she spoke, Nan offered the polished absurdity for inspection with innocent pride.  \"Oh that I were a collar, to sit upon that hand!\" sighed John,--adding, argumentatively,  \"As to the berry question, I might answer it with a gem from Dr. Watts, relative to 'Satan' and idle hands,' but will merely say, that, as a matter of public safety, you'd better leave me alone; for such is the destructiveness of my nature, that I shall certainly eat something hurtful, break something valuable, or sit upon something crushable, unless you let me concentrate my energies by knocking on these young fellows' hats, and preparing them for their doom.\"  Looking at the matter in a charitable light, Nan consented, and went cheerfully on with her work, wondering how she could have thought ironing an infliction, and been so ungrateful for the blessings of her lot.  \"Where's Sally?\" asked John, looking vainly for the functionary who usually pervaded that region like a domestic police-woman, a terror to cats, dogs, and men.  \"She has gone to her cousin's funeral, and won't be back till Monday. There seems to be a great fatality among her relations; for one dies, or comes to grief in some way, about once a month. But I don't blame poor Sally for wanting to get away from this place now and then.  I think I could find it in my heart to murder an imaginary friend or two, if I had to stay here long.\"  And Nan laughed so blithely, it was a pleasure to hear her.  \"Where's Di?\" asked John, seized with a most unmasculine curiosity all at once.  \"She is in Germany with 'Wilhelm Meister'; but, though 'lost to sight, to memory clear'; for I was just thinking, as I did her things, how clever she is to like all kinds of books that I don't understand at all, and to write things that make me cry with pride and delight.  Yes, she's a talented dear, though she hardly knows a needle from a crowbar, and will make herself one great blot some of these days, when the 'divine afflatus' descends upon her, I'm afraid.\"  And Nan rubbed away with sisterly zeal at Di's forlorn hose and inky pocket-handkerchiefs.  \"Where is Laura?\" proceeded the inquisitor.  \"Well, I might say that she was in Italy; for she is copying some fine thing of Raphael's or Michael Angelo's, or some great creatures or other; and she looks so picturesque in her pretty gown, sitting before her easel, that it's really a sight to behold, and I've peeped two or three times to see how she gets on.\"  And Nan bestirred herself to prepare the dish Wherewith her picturesque sister desired to prolong her artistic existence.  \"Where is your father?\" John asked again, checking off each answer with a nod and a little frown.  \"He is down in the garden, deep in some plan about melons, the beginning of which seems to consist in stamping the first proposition in Euclid all over the bed, and then poking a few seeds into the middle of each.  Why, bless the dear man!  I forgot it was time for the cider. Wouldn't you like to take it to him, John? He'd love to consult you; and the lane is so cool, it does one's heart good to look at it.\"  John glanced from the steamy kitchen to the shadowy path, and answered with a sudden assumption of immense industry,--  \"I couldn't possibly go, Nan,--I've so much on my hands.  You'll have to do it yourself.  'Mr. Robert of Lincoln' has something for your private ear; and the lane is so cool, it will do one's heart good to see you in it.  Give my regards to your father, and, in the words of 'Little Mabel's' mother, with slight variation,--    'Tell the dear old body   This day I cannot run,   For the pots are boiling over   And the mutton isn't done.'\"  \"I will; but please, John, go in to the girls"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3806"],["title","A Modern Cinderella; Or, The Little Old Shoe, and Other Stories (#1)"],["body"," be comfortable; for I don't like to leave you here,\" said Nan.  \"You insinuate that I should pick at the pudding or invade the cream, do you?  Ungrateful girl, leave me!\" And, with melodramatic sternness, John extinguished her in his broad-brimmed hat, and offered the glass like a poisoned goblet.  Nan took it, and went smiling away.  But the lane might have been the Desert of Sahara, for all she knew of it; and she would have passed her father as unconcernedly as if he had been an apple-tree, had he not called out,--  \"Stand and deliver, little woman!\"  She obeyed the venerable highwayman, and followed him to and fro, listening to his plans and directions with a mute attention that quite won his heart.  \"That hop-pole is really an ornament now, Nan; this sage-bed needs weeding,--that's good work for you girls; and, now I think of it, you'd better water the lettuce in the cool of the evening, after I'm gone.\"  To all of which remarks Nan gave her assent; the hop-pole took the likeness of a tall figure she had seen in the porch, the sage-bed, curiously enough, suggested a strawberry ditto, the lettuce vividly reminded her of certain vegetable productions a basket had brought, and the bobolink only sung in his cheeriest voice, \"Go home, go home! he is there!\"  She found John--he having made a free-mason of himself, by assuming her little apron--meditating over the partially spread table, lost in amaze at its desolate appearance; one half its proper paraphernalia having been forgotten, and the other half put on awry.  Nan laughed till the tears ran over her cheeks, and John was gratified at the efficacy of his treatment; for her face had brought a whole harvest of sunshine from the garden, and all her cares seemed to have been lost in the windings of the lane.  \"Nan, are you in hysterics?\" cried Di, appearing, book in hand. \"John, you absurd man, what are you doing?\"  \"I'm helpin' the maid of all work, please marm.\" And John dropped a curtsy with his limited apron.  Di looked ruffled, for the merry words were a covert reproach; and with her usual energy of manner and freedom of speech she tossed \"Wilhelm\" out of the window, exclaiming, irefully.--  \"That's always the way; I'm never where I ought to be, and never think of anything till it's too late; but it's all Goethe's fault.  What does he write books full of smart 'Phillinas' and interesting 'Meisters' for?  How can I be expected to remember that Sally's away, and people must eat, when I'm hearing the 'Harper' and little 'Mignon?' John, how dare you come here and do my work, instead of shaking me and telling me to do it myself?  Take that toasted child away, and fan her like a Chinese mandarin, while I dish up this dreadful dinner.\"  John and Nan fled like chaff before the wind, while Di, full of remorseful zeal, charged at the kettles, and wrenched off the potatoes' jackets, as if she were revengefully pulling her own hair. Laura had a vague intention of going to assist; but, getting lost among the lights and shadows of Minerva's helmet, forgot to appear till dinner had been evoked from chaos and peace was restored.  At three o'clock, Di performed the coronation ceremony with her father's best hat; Laura retied his old-fashioned neckcloth, and arranged his white locks with an eye to saintly effect; Nan appeared with a beautifully written sermon, and suspicious ink-stains on the fingers that slipped it into his pocket; John attached himself to the bag; and the patriarch was escorted to the door of his tent with the triumphal procession which usually attended his out-goings and in-comings.  Having kissed the female portion of his tribe, he ascended the venerable chariot, which received him with audible lamentation, as its rheumatic joints swayed to and fro.  \"Good-bye, my dears! I shall be back early on Monday morning; so take care of yourselves, and be sure you all go and hear Mr. Emerboy preach to-morrow.  My regards to your mother. John.  Come, Solon!\"  But Solon merely cocked one ear, and remained a fixed fact; for long experience had induced the philosophic beast to take for his motto the Yankee maxim, \"Be sure you're right, then go ahead! He knew things were not right; therefore he did not go ahead.  \"Oh, by the way, girls, don't forget to pay Tommy Mullein for bringing up the cow: he expects it to-night.  And Di, don't sit up till daylight, nor let Laura stay out in the dew.  Now, I believe I'm off. Come, Solon!\"  But Solon only cocked the other ear, gently agitated his mortified tail, as premonitory symptoms of departure, and never stirred a hoof, being well aware that it always took three \"comes\" to make a \"go.\"  \"Bless me! I've forgotten my spectacles. They are probably shut up in that volume of Herbert on my table.  Very awkward to find myself without them ten miles away.  Thank you, John.  Don't neglect to water the lettuce, Nan, and don't overwork yourself, my little 'Martha.' Come--\"  At this juncture Solon suddenly went off, like \"Mrs. Gamp,\" in a sort of walking swoon, apparently deaf and blind to all mundane matters, except the refreshments awaiting him ten miles away; and the benign old pastor disappeared, humming \"Hebron\" to the creaking accompaniment of the bulgy chaise.  Laura retired to take her siesta; Nan made a small carbonaro of herself by sharpening her sister's crayons, and Di, as a sort of penance for past sins, tried her patience over a piece of knitting, in which she soon originated a somewhat remarkable pattern, by dropping every third stitch, and seaming ad libitum.  If John bad been a gentlemanly creature, with refined tastes, he would have elevated his feet and made a nuisance of himself by indulging in a \"weed;\" but being only an uncultivated youth, with a rustic regard for pure air and womankind in general, he kept his head uppermost, and talked like a man, instead of smoking like a chimney.  \"It will probably be six months before I sit here again, tangling your threads and maltreating your needles, Nan.  How glad you must feel to hear it!\" he said, looking up from a thoughtful examination of the hard-working little citizens of the Industrial Community settled in Nan's work-basket.  \"No, I'm very sorry; for I like to see you coming and going as you used to, years ago, and I miss you very much when you are gone, John,\" answered truthful Nan, whittling away in a sadly wasteful manner, as her thoughts flew back to the happy times when a little lad rode a little lass in a big wheelbarrow, and never spilt his load,--when two brown heads bobbed daily side by side to school, and the favorite play was \"Babes in the Wood,\" with Di for a somewhat peckish robin to cover the small martyrs with any vegetable substance that lay at hand. Nan sighed, as she thought of these things, and John regarded the battered thimble on his finger-tip with increased benignity of aspect as he heard the sound.  \"When are you going to make your fortune, John, and get out of that disagreeable hardware concern?\" demanded Di, pausing after an exciting \"round,\" and looking almost as much exhausted as if it had been a veritable pugilistic encounter.  \"I intend to make it by plunging still deeper into 'that disagreeable hardware concern;' for, next year, if the world keeps rolling, and John Lord is alive, he will become a partner, and then--and then--\"  The color sprang up into the young man's cheek, his eyes looked out with a sudden shine, and his hand seemed involuntarily to close, as if he saw and seized some invisible delight.  \"What will happen then, John?\" asked Nan, with a wondering glance.  \"I'll tell you in a year, Nan, wait till then.\" and John's strong hand unclosed, as if the desired good were not to be his yet.  Di looked at him, with a knitting-needle stuck into her hair, saying, like a sarcastic unicorn,--  \"I really thought you had a soul above pots and kettles, but I see you haven't; and I beg your pardon for the injustice I have done you.\"  Not a whit disturbed, John smiled, as if at some mighty pleasant fancy of his own, as he replied,--  \"Thank you, Di; and as a further proof of the utter depravity of my nature, let me tell you that I have the greatest possible respect for those articles of ironmongery.  Some of the happiest hours of my life have been spent in their society; some of my pleasantest associations are connected with them; some of my best lessons have come to me among them; and when my fortune is made, I intend to show my gratitude by taking three flat-irons rampant for my coat of arms.\"  Nan laughed merrily, as she looked at the burns on her hand; but Di elevated the most prominent feature of her brown countenance, and sighed despondingly,--  \"Dear, dear, what a disappointing world this is! I no sooner build a nice castle in Spain, and settle a smart young knight therein, than down it comes about my ears; and the ungrateful youth, who might fight dragons, if he chose, insists on quenching his energies in a saucepan, and making a Saint Lawrence of himself by wasting his life on a series of gridirons.  Ah, if I were only a man, I would do something better than that, and prove that heroes are not all dead yet. But, instead of that, I'm only a woman, and must sit rasping my temper with absurdities like this.\" And Di wrestled with her knitting as if it were Fate, and she were paying off the grudge she owed it.  John leaned toward her, saying, with a look that made his plain face handsome,--  \"Di, my father began the world as I begin it, and left it the richer for the useful years he spent here,--as I hope I may leave it some half-century hence.  His memory makes that dingy shop a pleasant place to me; for there he made an honest name, led an honest life and bequeathed to me his reverence for honest work.  That is a sort of hardware, Di, that no rust can corrupt, and which will always prove a better fortune than any your knights can achieve with sword and shield. I think I am not quite a clod, or quite without some aspirations above"]]]
