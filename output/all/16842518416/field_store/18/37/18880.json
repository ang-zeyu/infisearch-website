The open shows many slabs and table tombstones; and all round the margin, the place is girt by an array of aristocratic mausoleums appallingly adorned.  Setting aside the tombs of Roubiliac, which belong to the heroic order of graveyard art, we Scotch stand, to my fancy, highest among nations in the matter of grimly illustrating death.  We seem to love for their own sake the emblems of time and the great change; and even around country churches you will find a wonderful exhibition of skulls, and crossbones, and noseless angels, and trumpets pealing for the Judgment Day.  Every mason was a pedestrian Holbein: he had a deep consciousness of death, and loved to put its terrors pithily before the churchyard loiterer; he was brimful of rough hints upon mortality, and any dead farmer was seized upon to be a text.  The classical examples of this art are in Greyfriars. In their time, these were doubtless costly monuments, and reckoned of a very elegant proportion by contemporaries; and now, when the elegance is not so apparent, the significance remains.  You may perhaps look with a smile on the profusion of Latin mottoes—some crawling endwise up the shaft of a pillar, some issuing on a scroll from angels’ trumpets—on the emblematic horrors, the figures rising headless from the grave, and all the traditional ingenuities in which it pleased our fathers to set forth their sorrow for the dead and their sense of earthly mutability.  But it is not a hearty sort of mirth.  Each ornament may have been executed by the merriest apprentice, whistling as he plied the mallet; but the original meaning of each, and the combined effect of so many of them in this quiet enclosure, is serious to the point of melancholy.  Round a great part of the circuit, houses of a low class present their backs to the churchyard.  Only a few inches separate the living from the dead.  Here, a window is partly blocked up by the pediment of a tomb; there, where the street falls far below the level of the graves, a chimney has been trained up the back of a monument, and a red pot looks vulgarly over from behind.  A damp smell of the graveyard finds its way into houses where workmen sit at meat.  Domestic life on a small scale goes forward visibly at the windows.  The very solitude and stillness of the enclosure, which lies apart from the town’s traffic, serves to accentuate the contrast.  As you walk upon the graves, you see children scattering crumbs to feed the sparrows; you hear people singing or washing dishes, or the sound of tears and castigation; the linen on a clothes-pole flaps against funereal sculpture; or perhaps the cat slips over the lintel and descends on a memorial urn.  And as there is nothing else astir, these incongruous sights and noises take hold on the attention and exaggerate the sadness of the place.                            [Picture: Greyfriars]  Greyfriars is continually overrun by cats.  I have seen one afternoon, as many as thirteen of them seated on the grass beside old Milne, the Master Builder, all sleek and fat, and complacently blinking, as if they had fed upon strange meats.  Old Milne was chaunting with the saints, as we may hope, and cared little for the company about his grave; but I confess the spectacle had an ugly side for me; and I was glad to step forward and raise my eyes to where the Castle and the roofs of the Old Town, and the spire of the Assembly Hall, stood deployed against the sky with the colourless precision of engraving.  An open outlook is to be desired from a churchyard, and a sight of the sky and some of the world’s beauty relieves a mind from morbid thoughts.  I shall never forget one visit.  It was a grey, dropping day; the grass was strung with rain-drops; and the people in the houses kept hanging out their shirts and petticoats and angrily taking them in again, as the weather turned from wet to fair and back again.  A grave-digger, and a friend of his, a gardener from the country, accompanied me into one after another of the cells and little courtyards in which it gratified the wealthy of old days to enclose their old bones from neighbourhood.  In one, under a sort of shrine, we found a forlorn human effigy, very realistically executed down to the detail of his ribbed stockings, and holding in his hand a ticket with the date of his demise.  He looked most pitiful and ridiculous, shut up by himself in his aristocratic precinct, like a bad old boy or an inferior forgotten deity under a new dispensation; the burdocks grew familiarly about his feet, the rain dripped all round him; and the world maintained the most entire indifference as to who he was or whither he had gone.  In another, a vaulted tomb, handsome externally but horrible inside with damp and cobwebs, there were three mounds of black earth and an uncovered thigh bone.  This was the place of interment, it appeared, of a family with whom the gardener had been long in service.  He was among old acquaintances.  ‘This’ll be Miss Marg’et’s,’ said he, giving the bone a friendly kick.  ‘The auld ---!’  I have always an uncomfortable feeling in a graveyard, at sight of so many tombs to perpetuate memories best forgotten; but I never had the impression so strongly as that day. People had been at some expense in both these cases: to provoke a melancholy feeling of derision in the one, and an insulting epithet in the other.  The proper inscription for the most part of mankind, I began to think, is the cynical jeer, _cras tibi_.  That, if anything, will stop the mouth of a carper; since it both admits the worst and carries the war triumphantly into the enemy’s camp.  Greyfriars is a place of many associations.  There was one window in a house at the lower end, now demolished, which was pointed out to me by the gravedigger as a spot of legendary interest.  Burke, the resurrection man, infamous for so many murders at five shillings a-head, used to sit thereat, with pipe and nightcap, to watch burials going forward on the green.  In a tomb higher up, which must then have been but newly finished, John Knox, according to the same informant, had taken refuge in a turmoil of the Reformation.  Behind the church is the haunted mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie: Bloody Mackenzie, Lord Advocate in the Covenanting troubles and author of some pleasing sentiments on toleration.  Here, in the last century, an old Heriot’s Hospital boy once harboured from the pursuit of the police.  The Hospital is next door to Greyfriars—a courtly building among lawns, where, on Founder’s Day, you may see a multitude of children playing Kiss-in-the-Ring and Round the Mulberry-bush.  Thus, when the fugitive had managed to conceal himself in the tomb, his old schoolmates had a hundred opportunities to bring him food; and there he lay in safety till a ship was found to smuggle him abroad.  But his must have been indeed a heart of brass, to lie all day and night alone with the dead persecutor; and other lads were far from emulating him in courage.  When a man’s soul is certainly in hell, his body will scarce lie quiet in a tomb however costly; some time or other the door must open, and the reprobate come forth in the abhorred garments of the grave.  It was thought a high piece of prowess to knock at the Lord Advocate’s mausoleum and challenge him to appear.  ‘Bluidy Mackingie, come oot if ye dar’!’ sang the fool-hardy urchins.  But Sir George had other affairs on hand; and the author of an essay on toleration continues to sleep peacefully among the many whom he so intolerantly helped to slay.  [Picture: The Grassmarket] For this _infelix campus_, as it is dubbed in one of its own inscriptions—an inscription over which Dr. Johnson passed a critical eye—is in many ways sacred to the memory of the men whom Mackenzie persecuted.  It was here, on the flat tombstones, that the Covenant was signed by an enthusiastic people.  In the long arm of the church-yard that extends to Lauriston, the prisoners from Bothwell Bridge—fed on bread and water and guarded, life for life, by vigilant marksmen—lay five months looking for the scaffold or the plantations. And while the good work was going forward in the Grassmarket, idlers in Greyfriars might have heard the throb of the military drums that drowned the voices of the martyrs.  Nor is this all: for down in the corner farthest from Sir George, there stands a monument dedicated, in uncouth Covenanting verse, to all who lost their lives in that contention.  There is no moorsman shot in a snow shower beside Irongray or Co’monell; there is not one of the two hundred who were drowned off the Orkneys; nor so much as a poor, over-driven, Covenanting slave in the American plantations; but can lay claim to a share in that memorial, and, if such things interest just men among the shades, can boast he has a monument on earth as well as Julius Cæsar or the Pharaohs.  Where they may all lie, I know not.  Far-scattered bones, indeed!  But if the reader cares to learn how some of them—or some part of some of them—found their way at length to such honourable sepulture, let him listen to the words of one who was their comrade in life and their apologist when they were dead.  Some of the insane controversial matter I omit, as well as some digressions, but leave the rest in Patrick Walker’s language and orthography:—      ‘The never to be forgotten Mr. _James Renwick_ told me, that he was     Witness to their Public Murder at the _Gallowlee_, between _Leith_     and _Edinburgh_, when he saw the Hangman hash and hagg off all their     Five Heads, with _Patrick Foreman’s_ Right Hand: Their Bodies were     all buried at the Gallows Foot; their Heads, with _Patrick’s_ Hand,     were brought and put upon five Pikes on the _Pleasaunce-Port_. . . .     Mr. _Renwick_ told me also that it was the first"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/382"],["title","Edinburgh: Picturesque Notes (#6)"],["body"," Action that     his Hand was at, to conveen Friends, and lift their murthered Bodies,     and carried them to the West Churchyard of _Edinburgh_,’—not     Greyfriars, this time,—‘and buried them there.  Then they came about     the City . . . . and took down these Five Heads and that Hand; and     Day being come, they went quickly up the _Pleasaunce_; and when they     came to _Lauristoun_ Yards, upon the South-side of the City, they     durst not venture, being so light, to go and bury their Heads with     their Bodies, which they designed; it being present Death, if any of     them had been found.  _Alexander Tweedie_, a Friend, being with them,     who at that Time was Gardner in these Yards, concluded to bury them     in his Yard, being in a Box (wrapped in Linen), where they lay 45     Years except 3 Days, being executed upon the 10th of _October_ 1681,     and found the 7th Day of October 1726.  That Piece of Ground lay for     some Years unlaboured; and trenching it, the Gardner found them,     which affrighted him the Box was consumed.  Mr. _Schaw_, the Owner of     these Yards, caused lift them, and lay them upon a Table in his     Summer-house: Mr. _Schaw’s_ mother was so kind, as to cut out a     Linen-cloth, and cover them.  They lay Twelve Days there, where all     had Access to see them.  _Alexander Tweedie_, the foresaid Gardner,     said, when dying, There was a Treasure hid in his Yard, but neither     Gold nor Silver.  _Daniel Tweedie_, his Son, came along with me to     that Yard, and told me that his Father planted a white Rose-bush     above them, and farther down the Yard a red Rose-bush, which were     more fruitful than any other Bush in the Yard. . . . Many came’—to     see the heads—‘out of Curiosity; yet I rejoiced to see so many     concerned grave Men and Women favouring the Dust of our Martyrs.     There were Six of us concluded to bury them upon the Nineteenth Day     of _October_ 1726, and every One of us to acquaint Friends of the Day     and Hour, being _Wednesday_, the Day of the Week on which most of     them were executed, and at 4 of the Clock at Night, being the Hour     that most of them went to their resting Graves.  We caused make a     compleat Coffin for them in Black, with four Yards of fine Linen, the     way that our Martyrs Corps were managed. . . . Accordingly we kept     the aforesaid Day and Hour, and doubled the Linen, and laid the Half     of it below them, their nether jaws being parted from their Heads;     but being young Men, their Teeth remained.  All were Witness to the     Holes in each of their Heads, which the Hangman broke with his     Hammer; and according to the Bigness of their Sculls, we laid the     Jaws to them, and drew the other Half of the Linen above them, and     stufft the Coffin with Shavings.  Some prest hard to go thorow the     chief Parts of the City as was done at the Revolution; but this we     refused, considering that it looked airy and frothy, to make such     Show of them, and inconsistent with the solid serious Observing of     such an affecting, surprizing unheard-of Dispensation: But took the     ordinary Way of other Burials from that Place, to wit, we went east     the Back of the Wall, and in at _Bristo-Port_, and down the Way to     the Head of the _Cowgate_, and turned up to the Church-yard, where     they were interred closs to the Martyrs Tomb, with the greatest     Multitude of People Old and Young, Men and Women, Ministers and     others, that ever I saw together.’  And so there they were at last, in ‘their resting graves.’  So long as men do their duty, even if it be greatly in a misapprehension, they will be leading pattern lives; and whether or not they come to lie beside a martyrs’ monument, we may be sure they will find a safe haven somewhere in the providence of God.  It is not well to think of death, unless we temper the thought with that of heroes who despised it.  Upon what ground, is of small account; if it be only the bishop who was burned for his faith in the antipodes, his memory lightens the heart and makes us walk undisturbed among graves.  And so the martyrs’ monument is a wholesome, heartsome spot in the field of the dead; and as we look upon it, a brave influence comes to us from the land of those who have won their discharge and, in another phrase of Patrick Walker’s, got ‘cleanly off the stage.’     CHAPTER VI. NEW TOWN—TOWN AND COUNTRY.   It is as much a matter of course to decry the New Town as to exalt the Old; and the most celebrated authorities have picked out this quarter as the very emblem of what is condemnable in architecture.  Much may be said, much indeed has been said, upon the text; but to the unsophisticated, who call anything pleasing if it only pleases them, the New Town of Edinburgh seems, in itself, not only gay and airy, but highly picturesque.  An old skipper, invincibly ignorant of all theories of the sublime and beautiful, once propounded as his most radiant notion for Paradise: ‘The new town of Edinburgh, with the wind a matter of a point free.’  He has now gone to that sphere where all good tars are promised pleasant weather in the song, and perhaps his thoughts fly somewhat higher.  But there are bright and temperate days—with soft air coming from the inland hills, military music sounding bravely from the hollow of the gardens, the flags all waving on the palaces of Princes Street—when I have seen the town through a sort of glory, and shaken hands in sentiment with the old sailor.  And indeed, for a man who has been much tumbled round Orcadian skerries, what scene could be more agreeable to witness? On such a day, the valley wears a surprising air of festival.  It seems (I do not know how else to put my meaning) as if it were a trifle too good to be true.  It is what Paris ought to be.  It has the scenic quality that would best set off a life of unthinking, open-air diversion. It was meant by nature for the realisation of the society of comic operas.  And you can imagine, if the climate were but towardly, how all the world and his wife would flock into these gardens in the cool of the evening, to hear cheerful music, to sip pleasant drinks, to see the moon rise from behind Arthur’s Seat and shine upon the spires and monuments and the green tree-tops in the valley.  Alas! and the next morning the rain is splashing on the windows, and the passengers flee along Princes Street before the galloping squalls.                       [Picture: The Royal Institution]  It cannot be denied that the original design was faulty and short-sighted, and did not fully profit by the capabilities of the situation.  The architect was essentially a town bird, and he laid out the modern city with a view to street scenery, and to street scenery alone.  The country did not enter into his plan; he had never lifted his eyes to the hills.  If he had so chosen, every street upon the northern slope might have been a noble terrace and commanded an extensive and beautiful view.  But the space has been too closely built; many of the houses front the wrong way, intent, like the Man with the Muck-Rake, on what is not worth observation, and standing discourteously back-foremost in the ranks; and, in a word, it is too often only from attic-windows, or here and there at a crossing, that you can get a look beyond the city upon its diversified surroundings.  But perhaps it is all the more surprising, to come suddenly on a corner, and see a perspective of a mile or more of falling street, and beyond that woods and villas, and a blue arm of sea, and the hills upon the farther side.  Fergusson, our Edinburgh poet, Burns’s model, once saw a butterfly at the Town Cross; and the sight inspired him with a worthless little ode.  This painted country man, the dandy of the rose garden, looked far abroad in such a humming neighbourhood; and you can fancy what moral considerations a youthful poet would supply.  But the incident, in a fanciful sort of way, is characteristic of the place.  Into no other city does the sight of the country enter so far; if you do not meet a butterfly, you shall certainly catch a glimpse of far-away trees upon your walk; and the place is full of theatre tricks in the way of scenery.  You peep under an arch, you descend stairs that look as if they would land you in a cellar, you turn to the back-window of a grimy tenement in a lane:—and behold! you are face-to-face with distant and bright prospects.  You turn a corner, and there is the sun going down into the Highland hills.  You look down an alley, and see ships tacking for the Baltic.  For the country people to see Edinburgh on her hill-tops, is one thing; it is another for the citizen, from the thick of his affairs, to overlook the country.  It should be a genial and ameliorating influence in life; it should prompt good thoughts and remind him of Nature’s unconcern: that he can watch from day to day, as he trots officeward, how the Spring green brightens in the wood or the field grows black under a moving ploughshare.  I have been tempted, in this connexion, to deplore the slender faculties of the human race, with its penny-whistle of a voice, its dull cars, and its narrow range of sight.  If you could see as people are to see in heaven, if you had eyes such as you can fancy for a superior race, if you could take clear note of the objects of vision, not only a few yards, but a few miles from where you stand:—think how agreeably your sight would be entertained, how pleasantly your thoughts would be diversified, as you walked the Edinburgh streets!  For you might pause, in some business perplexity, in the midst of the city traffic, and perhaps catch the eye of a shepherd as he sat down to breathe upon a heathery shoulder of the Pentlands; or perhaps some urchin, clambering in a country elm, would put aside the leaves and show you his flushed and rustic visage; or a fisher racing seawards, with the tiller under his elbow, and the sail"]]]
