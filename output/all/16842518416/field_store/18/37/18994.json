They do not accept everything that comes in the current. They seem to know what they like as well as the higher animals, and act as if they were vexed with some of the particles, rejecting and sending them off with a rapid whirling motion.  The largest of these fairy-like trees are visible to the naked eye, but it will be necessary for a novice in such matters to use a good strong lens to be able to find them readily. They are attached to plants growing in water. I have always been most successful in finding them among the water-milfoil (_Myriophillum_) several species of which grow in New England and the Middle States. Some of the species are found in deep water, others in shallow ponds.  The Bladderworts (_Utricularia_) are also good plants to search among. They grow in similar places. On either of these plants we shall be sure to find a good many interesting creatures. If we fail to find the tree, we may secure other species of vorticella, all of which are very beautiful.  Do you know the _Utricularia_? I will devote the next chapter to these curious plants, and to the microscopic animals which they capture.  It will take a little practice to learn where and how to collect material for the microscope. We should not depend too much upon books in any branch of natural history. To be successful, you must observe for yourselves, experiment and examine independently, consulting books that you may name and classify, that you may recognize and name what you find. If you fail to find specimens in one spot, try another.  You should not fill your collecting bottles more than two thirds full of water, nor crowd too many plants in them. These little creatures must have air in order to live, as well as the higher animals.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]  The finest tree-vorticellas I ever found were in Florida, in the St. John's River. These trees were attached to long, floating stems of _Myriophillum verticillatum_, and were unlike any species that I ever found at the North. They were very large--in a microscopic sense--plainly visible to the naked eye, and it took only a moderate power to bring out their beauty.  _Vorticella nebulifera_ is quite common in swamps and ponds. We find it attached to a great number of water plants. This species is not built up in the form of a tree, but it is nevertheless beautiful and graceful. The delicate, slender stems start from a node, or rounded mass, sometimes fifty or more of these fairy like creatures in one colony, all attached to a common centre, swaying about, coiling their delicate transparent stems, and again uncoiling quick as a flash, apparently dallying and playing, but never interfering nor becoming entangled one with another.  The _Stentor_ is another member of the _Vorticellinæ_ family. It is one of the largest of the infusoria, plainly visible to the naked eye, and one of the most interesting and curious of all the strange animals in the microscopic world. It assumes various forms. When swimming, it looks round and plump (_Fig. 2_), and rushes through the water pell-mell, knocking the smaller animals right and left, always seeming to be in a great hurry, unless two friendly ones happen to meet, when they frequently stop and put their heads together a moment as if exchanging greetings, then away they sail again, dashing through the water, capturing and devouring the smaller creatures as they go. And now a couple meet that are very communicative--two gossips, no doubt! At all events, they put their heads together and conclude to have a good sociable time.  And they are sensible enough to know that they cannot stand around loose in the water or public highway. So they select a cosey spot and fasten their feet to a plant or some firm object, and stretch out their footstalks sometimes to a great length, making veritable trumpets of themselves. (_Fig. 3._)  And who knows what grave matters may be settled during these conclaves? or perhaps they are only rehearsing gossip, as they have had every possible chance to see what was going on among their neighbors.    [Illustration: THE STENTORS.--\"VERITABLE TRUMPETS.\"]  Sometimes one settles down alone near a group of others, and seems to proclaim in stentorian voice that it is reception day and he is ready to receive. Or perhaps he is simply a herald as his name indicates, whose business it is to conduct ceremonies and regulate affairs! At any rate, though our ears are too dull to catch the voices of these curious beings of a lower world--so near, and yet in another sense, so far away, it would be difficult to believe that these animated creatures have no means of communication and nothing to communicate.     PART II  THROUGH A MICROSCOPE  BY MARY TREAT   IX.--THE UTRICULARIA.  It seems strange that innocent-looking plants should capture and kill animals; but this is really what the Bladderworts (_Utricularia_) are all the time doing. They grow in ponds and swamps, some species in deep, still water, others in shallow ponds.  Fig. 1 shows a portion of the stem of _Utricularia clandestina_, natural size. The little bladders are so nearly transparent, that on bringing them under the microscope, or even under a good lens, you can see the numerous creatures that they have captured, some partly consumed, others still alive.  The bladders on these curious plants remind one of some of the _Entomostracans_ which Mr. Wells described in his fourth paper. Look at _Chydorus sphericus_ for instance, and then at the magnified bladder (_Fig. 2_) in this article. The branched horns at the mouth or entrance have very much the appearance of the antennæ of some of the minute animals, and the stem when it is attached to the main branch may be likened to a tail. But the way in which they capture and devour the pretty little creatures that come within their grasp makes them appear, even more than they look, like wicked animals.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. PORTION OF A STEM OF UTRICULARIA CLANDESTINA;   NATURAL SIZE.]  I have found almost every swimming animalculæ with which I am acquainted, caught in these vegetable traps; and when caught they never escape. Their entrance is easy enough; there is a sensitive valve at the mouth of the bladder, which, if they touch it, flies open and draws them in as quick as a flash. These downward-opening bladders not only entrap animalculæ, but, more wonderful still, the strong larvæ of insects. The larvæ most frequently caught are those of the mosquito and chironomus. Often the mosquito is caught tail first--the entire body inclosed and the head left sticking out. It always looks as if the victim might walk or wriggle out, but it never does; and you may be sure that it never backed in there of its own accord.  You all know how the mosquito larva wriggles in the water, and is known by the common name of \"wriggler,\" or sometimes inaccurately, \"wiggler.\" Now just as sure as the tail of this wriggler strikes the mouth of the bladder, just so sure is he caught--drawn in by some unknown power quicker than you can speak.  There is yet much to learn about these curious plants. How it is that the valve or trap can so firmly hold these strong larvæ is still a mystery. I have seen a mosquito larva caught by the head when the first joint of the body was too large to be admitted through the entrance of the bladder, and have patiently watched its frantic efforts to escape, but it was never released. The more it thrashed about, the tighter grew the fatal trap until death put an end to its struggles.  The chironomus larva is quite unlike that of the mosquito. The chironomus has brush-like feet which it can withdraw from sight--a sort of telescopic arrangement--or extend when it wishes to crawl along the plants, while the mosquito wriggles and swims.  The chironomus is caught more often even than the mosquito larva. At certain seasons of the year it is almost impossible to find a bladder without one or more of these victims entrapped.  They feed on the water plants, and seem to have a special liking for the long-branched antennæ which grow at the mouth of the bladders, and, all unconscious of the trap, on, on they go, their sickle-shaped jaws cutting the antennæ which they eat as they advance, until their heads reach the mouth of the bladder, when they heedlessly touch the valve and the trap is sprung and they are drawn within, never more to escape, but to be slowly devoured.  There is another interesting species of _Utricularia_, the _Purfurea_, quite different in many particulars from the first. It grows in deep, still water. The stems are long, sometimes two feet or more in length, and the branches radiate in every direction, so that one plant often covers quite a large surface of water. The flowering stems stand above the water, and each stem bears three or four very pretty violet purple flowers, and it blossoms nearly all summer.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. BLADDER OF U. CLANDESTINA MAGNIFIED TWENTY   DIAMETERS.]  The flowers are about half an inch broad and quite conspicuous. Most of the other species have yellow flowers.  There are no little thread-like leaves on this species, and the bladders are on the ends of the little branchlets, and they have no sharp-pointed antennæ as in the other species; but in their place is an elegant cluster of transparent glassy-like ornamental appendages. The ornaments are just above the entrance, and who knows but this is a contrivance set there to lure unwary creatures into the trap.  One of the most common little creatures that was caught in this trap, was the _Tardigrada_, or water bear. He looks like a tiny cub, but unlike his great namesake, he has eight legs, and he frequently slips out of his old skin and comes out in a new suit.  I often find them crawling in a forest of these plants, peering out of a thick jungle--now"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38428"],["title","Through a Microscope (#5)"],["body","a branch and out on a limb, holding fast with their long claws, and apparently looking around to see what they can find.  Now one seems to be attracted to this elegant glassy cluster of _Utricularia_. At all events he is soon pushing his head among the delicate stems, then stops a moment, standing perfectly still as if listening. Perhaps he hears the groans of his dying comrades, but all unheeding the warning, he steps forward, touches the fatal spring, when in he goes to perish with his comrades.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. CHIRONOMUS LARVA: BACK VIEW WITH FEET DRAWN IN   AND JAWS CLOSED; SIDE VIEW WITH FEET EXTENDED AND JAWS CLOSED.]  Young microscopists may like to know that the _Utricularia_ can be preserved in the house a long time by putting the stems or sprays in an open, shallow dish of water where they will grow readily. I have kept the plants months together in a large glass dish where they looked charmingly beautiful and were the admiration of all who saw them. It is very interesting to watch their growth. The ends of the growing sprays unroll like ferns, and with a magnifying glass you can see the development of the little bladders, and you may make discoveries--who knows? I know that for a long time it was a mystery to me how the bladders captured and imprisoned the little animals. Every day I saw they were entrapped and never escaped, and I studied and pondered over the matter a long time, and was so interested and determined to learn the secret that I spent night after night looking through the microscope, watching the strange, unwary creatures fall into the trap.  At last I concluded to adopt the following plan: I took sprays of the plants that I had grown in clear water that contained no animalcules, so that all the bladders were empty and quite transparent. In another dish I had put a great many masses of mosquito eggs. Mosquito eggs are found floating on almost any standing water, in dark, compact masses. In warm weather they hatch in a few hours. So you can understand how quickly I could swarm a small vessel of water with the mosquito larvæ by introducing the eggs where I wished them to hatch. When they were hatched I put some of the water in which was a large number of the tiny creatures into the live box with a spray of the plant containing empty bladders. I placed the box under the microscope and closely watched the manner of capture. I became certain that in almost every instance the larvæ were caught tail first. The tail is brush-like, and when it swept over the door or valve that leads into the bladder, I saw that the door would immediately fly open and always draw the larva in. I soon became satisfied that the valve was very sensitive when touched at the right point, but to this day I cannot tell what the power is that so quickly draws the creatures within. I earnestly hope that some young microscopists will yet be able to ferret out the cause of this singular power.  Those who have read Mr. Darwin's very interesting book on _Insectivorous Plants_, will have noticed that he says the valve of _Utricularia_ is not in the least sensitive, and that the little creatures force their way into the bladders--their heads acting like a wedge. But this is not the case, as Mr. Darwin himself was convinced some years before his death. In his usual kind, gracious manner he admitted that he was wrong, and gracefully says the valve must be sensitive, although he could never excite any movement. In a letter to me bearing date June 1st, 1875, he says:  \"I have read your article (in _Harpers Magazine_) with the greatest interest. It certainly appears from your excellent observations that the valve is sensitive.... I cannot understand why I could never with all my pains excite any movement. It is pretty clear I am quite wrong about the head acting like a wedge. The indraught of the living larva is astonishing.\"   X.--FREE SWIMMING ANIMALCULES.  The Brickmaker, Floscules, and Vorticellas are quiet peaceable citizens of the microscopic world, and seem to be impressed with the graver duties of life; they set up housekeeping and settle down for life moored to one spot. But there are many others that live a free-and-easy sort of life--a wandering gypsy kind of an existence, always on the move; and there is not much satisfaction in trying to follow these rovers if we wish to make a careful study of their structure.    [Illustration: SKELETON WATER WHEEL.]  So to be enabled to examine them you will be compelled to imprison them in the live-box and bring just as much pressure to bear upon them as they will stand without crushing, which with careful practice you may soon learn to do. But if you are simply making the acquaintance of these little creatures for amusement, it is more interesting and satisfactory to watch them while they are unrestrained, and see the curious feats they perform.  One of the most amusing of these little animals is the Skeleton Wheel-bearer (_Dinocharis pocillum_). His portrait is seen at _Figure 1_. He has a long foot consisting of three joints, and these joints are as perfect as those of our own knees and elbows, and can be moved as easily forward and sideways, but not backward. The joints and foot are not covered with any fleshy substance, from which fact--the joints being so conspicuous--it probably received the name Skeleton. Two long slender toes extend from the last joint, and from the tips of these the Skeleton can show us more wonderful feats than any circus performer.  The toes can be widely separated, or brought close together, like a pair of tongs. Sometimes he stands on the tip of one toe and throws his body forward, or from side to side with a rapid motion; then straightening himself up, he stands on the tips of both toes as if posing, remaining perfectly still for a few moments and giving us an opportunity to take a good look at his curious body which is encased in a pretty vase-shaped, three-sided transparent shell. The head extends from the top of the vase, and is surmounted with the usual cilia, or wheel, which we see among all the rotifera. When he is tired of posing, away he swims in a graceful, easy manner, with his long foot straightened out and the toes brought close together.  You sometimes will find these pretty creatures, especially in summer-time, very numerous in the sediment at the bottom of your collecting bottles. Often I have found dead specimens, and very beautiful objects they sometimes are. Great numbers of tiny scavengers have completely cleaned out all of the soft parts of the body in a most neat and perfect manner, leaving the beautiful shell and vertical column, that runs through it, and the foot and toes, entire and perfect in all of their parts.  Think of the minuteness of these scavengers--untold numbers of them preying upon the body of an object invisible to the naked eye; and yet this body is a mammoth by the side of one of the scavengers! The mind can scarcely grasp the minuteness of these tiny creatures--creatures that seem to enjoy existence, eating, and apparently playing and entertaining each other like the higher animals.    [Illustration: WHIPTAIL.]  The whiptail (_Mastigocerca carinata_) (_Fig. 2_) is another delicate pretty little creature, and, like the skeleton, is encased in a glassy shell. It has a long, tapering, spine-like foot, or, more properly speaking, a toe which is attached to a very short foot by means of a flexible joint which allows free motion. You often will find him in company with the Skeleton, and they seem to vie with each other in performing strange feats. The Whiptail, if possible, looks even more comical than the Skeleton when it stands on the tip of its long toe, a toe which is longer than the entire length of the body, now bending over and nibbling at the plants, now whisking around as if looking and inquiring into some passing object, then sailing through the water with a graceful, easy motion beyond sight.  _Brachionus pala_ is also a lovely creature encased in a delicate transparent shell. It is considerably larger than the Skeleton or Whiptail, and is just visible to the unassisted eye. If you drop it in a phial of clear water and hold it up to the light, you can distinctly see it gliding through the water like a revolving white speck. A moderate power of the microscope reveals its beauty. The shell is swelled at the sides, and narrow at the mouth, and round over the back, while the under side is flat.    [Illustration: LARGE ROTIFER.]  Like the Skeleton and Whiptail, the head of the little Brachion is seen protruding from the upper part of the shell; but instead of one wheel this charming little creature has two, and nothing can be more lovely than a sight of these fast revolving wheels, like two beautiful crowns.  The reason the wheel looks so strikingly beautiful in _Brachionus_ is owing to the long cilia which is longer in this genus than in other genera of this great family.  The foot of _Brachionus_ is more curious than that of the Skeleton. It is telescopic, and the little animal has the most perfect control over it. He can draw it within the body so that it looks like a ball, and again quickly thrust it out and whisk it around in all directions like a tail. It has two short toes at the end which can be separated or brought together at pleasure. And he can firmly anchor himself by the toes and stretch forward, showing you the great length of the foot. Now he rolls from side to side without letting go his hold and performs other strange feats, and all the while the wheels are rapidly revolving, he has stopped his headlong career through the water and has settled down to get his supper.  _Fig. 3_ represents one of the largest rotifers with which I am acquainted. I have never been able to find a description or engraving of it in any work on microscopy. But it is probably well known to microscopists, for it has a wide range. I have found it in New Hampshire, New Jersey and Florida.  You cannot"]]]
