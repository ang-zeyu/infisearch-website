ALCÉDO (Kingfisher). Bill long, straight, quadrangular, sharp;     wings short with the third primary the longest; tail very short.                                                                  _Page 132_     FAMILY CORACIIDÆ    (ROLLERS)  Bill corvine in shape; culmen rounded; nostrils near base of upper mandible and hidden by bristly feathers; tail feathers twelve.    54.

A tropical family of birds, many of which migrate to the temperate regions in summer. Not so decidedly climbers as the Woodpeckers and Creepers, yet having great power of clinging. Their flight is feeble, their food soft-bodied insects, varied in many cases with berries and other fruits, and some of the larger species will occasionally prey on mice, reptiles, and the eggs and young of birds.
