All were found at night in the rainy season. At a pond in the forest at Toocog these snakes were observed on low vegetation, on the ground, and in the water. Evidently they congregate at breeding choruses of frogs. One _Leptodeira_ contained a _Smilisca baudini_ and another contained eggs of _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_. The natives call this snake _nahuyaca_.   =Leptophis ahaetulla praestans= (Cope)        13 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  Both specimens were obtained from trees when they were felled. One individual (KU 55716) has a body length of 1345 mm. and a total length of 2035 mm. In life the entire snake was uniform bright green; the eye was yellow. In preservative the dorsum is dark blue, and the venter is green.   =Leptophis mexicanus mexicanus= Duméril, Bibron and Duméril        Chinajá, 1; 15 km. NW of Chinajá, 1; Sayaxché, 4.  All specimens came from low trees in the forest. The largest specimen is a male having a body length of 724 mm. and a total length of 1236 mm. In life the middorsum was a golden tan; the top of the head was a vivid green. One individual had ingested a _Smilisca baudini_. The local name is _bejuquillo_.   =Ninia sebae sebae= (Duméril, Bibron and Duméril)        Toocog, 1.  This specimen, a male having 144 ventrals and 55 caudals, was found beneath bark on a log in the forest. There is a black band five scales in length on the nape followed posteriorly by a red band six scales in length and then by a complete black band one and one-half scales in length. The rest of the body is dull red with 16 incomplete black bands one to one and one-half scales in length on the anterior two-thirds of the body.   =Oxybelis aeneus aeneus= (Wagler)        Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  One individual was found in a low tree; the other was in a bush. Both specimens are males; the largest has a body length of 754 mm. and a total length of 1286 mm. Bogert and Oliver (1945:388) distinguished _O. aeneus aeneus_ in Central and South America from _O. aeneus auratus_ in México in that the diameter of the eye is more than the length of the internasal, whereas in _O. aeneus auratus_ the diameter of the eye is less than the length of the internasal. Stuart (1958:27) stated that on the basis of this character three specimens from Tikal in northeastern El Petén definitely were _O. aeneus aeneus_. Of the present specimens from southern El Petén, one has an internasal:eye ratio of 1.08; the other has a ratio of 0.87. A careful review of these snakes is needed to verify the validity of the characters used to separate the subspecies and to determine areas of intergradation. The local name for the vine-snake is _bejuquillo_.   =Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis= Salvin        Chinajá, 1; Río San Román, 1.  These specimens are tentatively referred to _P. euryzonus_. KU 57160 is a female having 130 ventrals, 87 caudals, and 23 black rings on the body; KU 58150 is a juvenile having 128 ventrals, 79 caudals, and 27 black rings on the body. In both specimens the tip of the snout is yellow; a broad yellow band on the parietals and temporals is bordered posteriorly by a black band on the nape. The black rings on the body are not bordered by yellow, but black rings on the tail have yellow borders ventrally. In the red interspaces between the black rings, black flecks and spots, especially posteriorly, tend to form secondary black rings (Fig. 6a). According to Stuart (1948:71), _P. euryzonus aequalis_ has 25 to 27 black rings on the body, whereas _P. elapoides salvini_, which also occurs in El Petén, has 15 to 23 black rings.  [Illustration: FIG. 6. Dorsal color patterns of _Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis_ (A) and _Micrurus affinis apiatus_ (B).]  The specimen from the Río San Román contained a partly digested _Bolitoglossa moreleti mulleri_. Locally _Piocercus_ is called _coral_ or _coralillo_.   =Pseustes poecilonotus poecilonotus= (Günther)        Chinajá, 3; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  Two juveniles were on the forest floor; one juvenile and an adult were on low bushes. The juveniles have a tan dorsum with reddish brown blotches; the belly is gray, and the iris is cream-color above and brown below. The one adult is olive-brown above and creamy white below on the anterior three-fourths of the body; posteriorly it is black above and below. There are no paravertebral dark stripes nor pale spots on the dorsal scales.  Two specimens (one juvenile and the adult) when encountered compressed the anterior part of the body laterally and struck repeatedly. Locally the adults are called _sumbadora_.   =Sibon dimidiata dimidiata= (Günther)        20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 2.  Both snakes were obtained from trees when they were felled. In life the dorsum was pinkish orange with dark chocolate brown blotches narrowly edged with black.   =Sibon nebulata nebulata= (Linnaeus)        20 km. NW of Chinajá, 1.  This specimen, a male having a body length of 544 mm. and a tail length of 198 mm., was found in a felled tree. In life the belly was pink and black; the dorsal black blotches were narrowly outlined with pink.   =Spilotes pullatus mexicanus= (Laurenti)        Chinajá, 3; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1; Sayaxché, 1.  This large snake, locally called _mica_, seems to be equally at home on the ground and in low trees and bushes. It is fast moving for a large snake; two individuals escaped capture. The natives said that this snake eats other snakes, but examination of stomachs revealed no supporting evidence.   =Stenorrhina degenhardti= (Berthold)        Chinajá, 1.  This specimen, a female having 158 ventrals, 37 caudals, and a total length of 489 mm., was found on the forest floor. On the olive-brown dorsum are 27 irregular, narrow, dark brown, transverse bands. The head is uniform olive-brown; the chin and labials are cream-color. The venter is cream-color with a row of brown spots forming a midventral stripe. A large spider was found in the stomach.  I have refrained from assigning a subspecific name to this snake. Cursory examination of specimens from throughout México and Central America reveals a bewildering array of variation in coloration that suggests that the subspecies _mexicanus_ is not recognizable, or that two species occur sympatrically in parts of southern México and northern Central America.   =Tretanorhinus nigroluteus lateralis= Bocourt        Chinajá, 1.  A single male having 136 ventrals, 75 caudals, and a total length of 407 mm. was found by a stream in camp. The dorsum is pale grayish tan with 34 pairs of small chocolate brown spots, some of the anterior ones of which are connected across the back. A cream-colored lateral stripe is on the third and fourth dorsal scale-rows anteriorly and the second and third rows posteriorly. The lower dorsal scale rows are black. The venter is dark grayish brown with cream-colored flecks anteriorly and creamy gray posteriorly where the dark color is restricted to the midventral region and the lateral edges of ventrals and first dorsal scale-row.   =Xenodon rabdocephalus mexicanus= Smith        Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  Both individuals were found on the forest floor. An adult male having a total length of 420 mm. has a cream-colored venter with brown flecks. A juvenile having a total length of 172 mm. has a creamy white belly with black crossbands.  At the suggestion of L. C. Stuart, I am following Schmidt (1941:501) in placing _X. mexicanus_ as a subspecies of _X. rabdocephalus_.   =Micrurus affinis apiatus= (Jan)        20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 2; Sayaxché, 1.  All specimens were found beneath litter on the forest floor. All are males having 202 to 211 (average 205) ventrals, 53 to 56 (54.6) caudals, and 34 to 48 (41) primary black rings on the body. There are no yellow rings, and black spots in the red interspaces tend to form secondary black rings (Fig. 6b), the same as in _Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis_. The local name is _coral_ or _coralillo_.   =Bothrops atrox asper= (Garman)        15 km. NW of Chinajá, 1; Sayaxché, 1.  Although we found only two specimens, natives and workmen at the camp at Chinajá stated that the _barba amarilla_, as this snake is known locally, had been abundant when the camp had been established less than two years before our visit.   =Bothrops nasutus= Bocourt        12 km. NW of Chinajá, 1.  This specimen, a male having a total length of 415 mm., was found on the forest floor. The dorsum is brown with dark brown blotches separated middorsally by a narrow orange-tan stripe extending from the nape to the base of the tail. The belly is grayish tan with white flecks on the lateral edges of the ventrals. The local name is _nahuyaca_.   =Bothrops nummifer nummifer= (Rüppell)        15 km. NW of Chinajá, 2; Sayaxché, 1.  Two individuals were found on the forest floor, and one adult, having a total length of 953 mm., was removed from the stomach of a large _Drymarchon corais melanurus_. There is considerable variation in color and pattern. A juvenile (KU 58104), having a total length of 332 mm., has a tan dorsum with 19 interconnected dark brown, diamond-shaped, middorsal blotches, the lateral extensions of which are black; the belly is a cream-color with brown squares. An adult female (KU 55706), having a total length of 779 mm., has a dorsal coloration like the preceding specimen, except that the lateral extensions of the dorsal blotches are brown; the belly is a uniform cream-color. A second adult female (KU 55707), having a total length of 953 mm., has a brown dorsum with 21 interconnected black, diamond-shaped, middorsal blotches, the lateral extensions of which are black; the belly is a cream-color with black squares.  The local name for this species is _braza de piedra_.   =Bothrops schlegeli schlegeli= (Berthold)        Paso Subín, 1.

There were stories that it had once been more attractive, but that had been so long ago that no one remembered the time. It stood back in its gloomy, narrow strips of uncared-for, smoky gardens, whose broken iron railings were supposed to protect it from the surging traffic of a road which was always roaring with the rattle of busses, cabs, drays, and vans, and the passing of people who were shabbily dressed and looked as if they were either going to hard work or coming from it, or hurrying to see if they could find some of it to do to keep themselves from going hungry. The brick fronts of the houses were blackened with smoke, their windows were nearly all dirty and hung with dingy curtains, or had no curtains at all; the strips of ground, which had once been intended to grow flowers in, had been trodden down into bare earth in which even weeds had forgotten to grow. One of them was used as a stone-cutter's yard, and cheap monuments, crosses, and slates were set out for sale, bearing inscriptions beginning with \"Sacred to the Memory of.\" Another had piles of old lumber in it, another exhibited second-hand furniture, chairs with unsteady legs, sofas with horsehair stuffing bulging out of holes in their covering, mirrors with blotches or cracks in them. The insides of the houses were as gloomy as the outside. They were all exactly alike. In each a dark entrance passage led to narrow stairs going up to bedrooms, and to narrow steps going down to a basement kitchen. The back bedroom looked out on small, sooty, flagged yards, where thin cats quarreled, or sat on the coping of the brick walls hoping that sometime they might feel the sun; the front rooms looked over the noisy road, and through their windows came the roar and rattle of it. It was shabby and cheerless on the brightest days, and on foggy or rainy ones it was the most forlorn place in London.  At least that was what one boy thought as he stood near the iron railings watching the passers-by on the morning on which this story begins, which was also the morning after he had been brought by his father to live as a lodger in the back sitting-room of the house No. 7.  He was a boy about twelve years old, his name was Marco Loristan, and he was the kind of boy people look at a second time when they have looked at him once. In the first place, he was a very big boy--tall for his years, and with a particularly strong frame. His shoulders were broad and his arms and legs were long and powerful. He was quite used to hearing people say, as they glanced at him, \"What a fine, big lad!\" And then they always looked again at his face. It was not an English face or an American one, and was very dark in coloring. His features were strong, his black hair grew on his head like a mat, his eyes were large and deep set, and looked out between thick, straight, black lashes. He was as un-English a boy as one could imagine, and an observing person would have been struck at once by a sort of _silent_ look expressed by his whole face, a look which suggested that he was not a boy who talked much.  This look was specially noticeable this morning as he stood before the iron railings. The things he was thinking of were of a kind likely to bring to the face of a twelve-year-old boy an unboyish expression.  He was thinking of the long, hurried journey he and his father and their old soldier servant, Lazarus, had made during the last few days--the journey from Russia. Cramped in a close third-class railway carriage, they had dashed across the Continent as if something important or terrible were driving them, and here they were, settled in London as if they were going to live forever at No. 7 Philibert Place. He knew, however, that though they might stay a year, it was just as probable that, in the middle of some night, his father or Lazarus might waken him from his sleep and say, \"Get up--dress yourself quickly. We must go at once.\" A few days later, he might be in St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, or Budapest, huddled away in some poor little house as shabby and comfortless as No. 7 Philibert Place.  He passed his hand over his forehead as he thought of it and watched the busses. His strange life and his close association with his father had made him much older than his years, but he was only a boy, after all, and the mystery of things sometimes weighed heavily upon him, and set him to deep wondering.  In not one of the many countries he knew had he ever met a boy whose life was in the least like his own. Other boys had homes in which they spent year after year; they went to school regularly, and played with other boys, and talked openly of the things which happened to them, and the journeys they made. When he remained in a place long enough to make a few boy-friends, he knew he must never forget that his whole existence was a sort of secret whose safety depended upon his own silence and discretion.  This was because of the promises he had made to his father, and they had been the first thing he remembered. Not that he had ever regretted anything connected with his father. He threw his black head up as he thought of that. None of the other boys had such a father, not one of them. His father was his idol and his chief. He had scarcely ever seen him when his clothes had not been poor and shabby, but he had also never seen him when, despite his worn coat and frayed linen, he had not stood out among all others as more distinguished than the most noticeable of them. When he walked down a street, people turned to look at him even oftener than they turned to look at Marco, and the boy felt as if it was not merely because he was a big man with a handsome, dark face, but because he looked, somehow, as if he had been born to command armies, and as if no one would think of disobeying him. Yet Marco had never seen him command any one, and they had always been poor, and shabbily dressed, and often enough ill-fed. But whether they were in one country or another, and whatsoever dark place they seemed to be hiding in, the few people they saw treated him with a sort of deference, and nearly always stood when they were in his presence, unless he bade them sit down.  \"It is because they know he is a patriot, and patriots are respected,\" the boy had told himself.  He himself wished to be a patriot, though he had never seen his own country of Samavia. He knew it well, however. His father had talked to him about it ever since that day when he had made the promises. He had taught him to know it by helping him to study curious detailed maps of it--maps of its cities, maps of its mountains, maps of its roads. He had told him stories of the wrongs done its people, of their sufferings and struggles for liberty, and, above all, of their unconquerable courage. When they talked together of its history, Marco's boy-blood burned and leaped in his veins, and he always knew, by the look in his father's eyes, that his blood burned also. His countrymen had been killed, they had been robbed, they had died by thousands of cruelties and starvation, but their souls had never been conquered, and, through all the years during which more powerful nations crushed and enslaved them, they never ceased to struggle to free themselves and stand unfettered as Samavians had stood centuries before.  \"Why do we not live there,\" Marco had cried on the day the promises were made. \"Why do we not go back and fight? When I am a man, I will be a soldier and die for Samavia.\"  \"We are of those who must _live_ for Samavia--working day and night,\" his father had answered; \"denying ourselves, training our bodies and souls, using our brains, learning the things which are best to be done for our people and our country. Even exiles may be Samavian soldiers--I am one, you must be one.\"  \"Are we exiles?\" asked Marco.  \"Yes,\" was the answer. \"But even if we never set foot on Samavian soil, we must give our lives to it. I have given mine since I was sixteen. I shall give it until I die.\"  \"Have you never lived there?\" said Marco.  A strange look shot across his father's face.  \"No,\" he answered, and said no more. Marco watching him, knew he must not ask the question again.  The next words his father said were about the promises. Marco was quite a little fellow at the time, but he understood the solemnity of them, and felt that he was being honored as if he were a man.  \"When you are a man, you shall know all you wish to know,\" Loristan said. \"Now you are a child, and your mind must not be burdened."]]]
