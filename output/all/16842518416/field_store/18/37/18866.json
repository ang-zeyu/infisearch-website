A detachment of white and a detachment of black light dragoons, three battalions of grenadiers, three battalions of light infantry, the sixth, ninth, fifteenth, thirty-ninth, forty-third, fifty-sixth, fifty-eighth, sixty-fourth, sixty-fifth, and seventieth regiments, with detachments from the second, twenty-first, and sixtieth regiments. The troops were divided into three brigades; the first commanded by Lieutenant General Prescott, the second by Major General Thomas Dundas, and the third by Major General his Royal Highness Prince Edward (till whose arrival from Canada the command of this brigade was given to Lieutenant Colonel Sir Charles Gordon.) The total force that embarked for the attack of Martinique was six thousand and eighty-five, two hundred and twenty-four sick, and nine hundred and seventy-seven left sick at Barbadoes[4].       [4] An idea was started of raising four hundred white men in the      island of Barbadoes to augment the army; but there was not time to      arm and discipline them; therefore it was dropped. However, a      certain number of negroes were provided to attend the army, four      hundred of whom were sent from Dominica for that service; some more      were brought from St. Vincent's; and the council of Barbadoes made      an offer of supplying a large number of them to serve on very      liberal terms; but when the matter came to be investigated, the      terms were found to be far from equitable, and therefore were      rejected.--Mr. Baillie and Mr. Monro, two planters of Grenada, were      here introduced to the Commanders in Chief, and were received on      board the Boyne as guests, and treated with the greatest      hospitality; they proceeded with us on the expedition. Mr. Gibbs,      one of the council of Barbadoes, also accompanied us.     CHAPTER III.      THE FLEET SAILS FROM BARBADOES ... ANCHORS ON THE SOUTH COAST OF      MARTINIQUE ... CAPTURE OF A BATTERY ... GENERAL GREY LANDS WITH HIS      ARMY ... FLAG OF TRUCE FIRED ON BY THE ENEMY ... THE COMMANDERS IN      CHIEF ATTACK THE ISLAND AT THREE DIFFERENT PLACES AT THE SAME TIME.   On Monday, Feb. 3, 1794, the fleet of men of war, transports, storeships, &c. sailed from Carlisle Bay, and the next morning land was seen, which proved to be the island of St. Lucia, bearing west several leagues. On Wednesday, Feb. 5, we approached the island of Martinique on the south east coast, off the bay of Maran; two forts, one at Pointe du Jardin, the other at Pointe de la Borgnesse, which defended the entrance to that bay, began to fire on our ships as they approached; notwithstanding which, the Boyne and the rest of the fleet anchored by four P.M. not far from the battery on Pointe de la Borgnesse, Lieutenant Bowen having previously run along shore in a small schooner to sound the depth of water. Our troops were now preparing to land, and had filled several flat-boats which lay along-side the men of war, when the battery opened a heavy fire on them, which was quickly answered by the ships; the troops at the same time pushed in and landed, covered by the gun-boats: seeing which, and alarmed by some well-directed shot from the Boyne and Veteran, the enemy fled in disorder from the fort, which our troops immediately entered, and having hoisted the British colours, were saluted with three cheers from the fleet. A trench was found in the battery, communicating with the magazine, in which a train was laid, and a brand or match laid across it. Happily (by the exertions of the officers and men) this dastardly plot was prevented taking effect. The guns were immediately turned upon the enemy in their retreat, and against the town of St. Anne; but as this was a post of no great consequence, after they had spiked the guns and broke the carriages, the troops reimbarked[5].       [5] During the landing of our troops, Lieutenant Bowen, who was in      a gun-boat, perceived a number of the enemy collecting in the woods      near the shore, and being scarce noticed by them, was suffered to      approach without molestation, and having loaded his gun with      langrege, he dealt such destruction among them, that they fled in      all directions. A shot from the battery, which stuck in the      larboard bow of the Boyne, when cut out, proved to be a thirty-four      pounder, and to have been heated, but not sufficiently to do any      mischief by fire.  In the evening the enemy in the battery on Pointe du Jardin burnt the sugar plantations near them, as we suppose, out of revenge for our success at Pointe de la Borgnesse; from the dryness of the canes the fire spread with great rapidity, and did much damage. Near us was the village of St. Luce, where a two-gun battery, directed by the curé of St. Luce, seeming disposed to trouble us, the Veteran opened her lower deckers on it, and soon drove the enemy from thence[6].--On Thursday morning, Feb. 6, our troops landed at Trois Rivieres, in the bay of St. Luce, without opposition, to the number of two thousand four hundred and eighty-four men, under the direction of Lieutenant General Prescott. Sir Charles Grey and his suite then landed, and the whole army moved off from the landing-place in two divisions; the first division began to march about twelve at noon, the second division at five in the afternoon. Lieutenant Rogers of the Boyne soon after landed at the curé's battery at St. Luce, and found the two cannon there to be twenty-four pounders, that had belonged to the Raisonable man of war, wrecked some time since on this island. They destroyed these guns, and returned on board without any loss. This evening a gun-boat and flat-boat with seamen, under the command of Lieutenants Rutherford and Ogle of the Boyne, and Mr. Johnson, midshipman, attempted to cut out some vessels in the harbour near Maran, where they were much exposed both to the great guns and musquetry of the enemy; but they succeeded so far as to bring off two American schooners; two others saved themselves by running ashore close under the guns of Fort St. Etienne.       [6] The Generous Friends transport, laden with officers' baggage,      &c. dragged her anchor on the night of the 5th, struck against a      rock at the entrance of the bay, and was wrecked. Fortunately,      however, the hands on board and the baggage were saved.  On Feb. 7th the Admiral sent (with a flag of truce) Lieutenant Miln of the Boyne, accompanied by Lieutenant James of the fifteenth regiment, and the Chaplain of the Boyne, with a letter for the municipality or governor of Maran. As they approached the town they perceived hostile preparations making in the fort of St. Etienne; but, in hopes of preventing a flag of truce being insulted, Mr. Miln boarded one of the American ships that had been run aground the day before, intending, in case the captain of it was on board, to take him in his company. Being now within half gun-shot of the fort, the enemy began to fire on the boat, notwithstanding the flag of truce, and continued to do so, although Mr. Miln endeavoured to proceed towards the shore: but the enemy seeming determined to oppose his landing, and several of their shot falling close by the boat, he at length judged it most prudent to return. As he passed Pointe du Bourgnesse he perceived some negroes near the fort, and sent the two gentlemen who accompanied him armed, to endeavour to cut off their retreat, and to give them the papers which were to have been delivered to the commander at Maran; but the negroes, on perceiving them land, immediately made off towards the town: they however found a wounded man, whose leg had been broken by a cannon ball, with whom they left the papers, adding a note to express their surprise and indignation at a flag of truce being fired on[7].       [7] The French have since said that they fired on the boat because      it had a white flag hoisted: this was a most ridiculous objection;      for, though with them a mark of aristocracy, it has ever been      acknowledged by all nations as a signal of peace and cessation from      hostilities. However, we found it necessary afterwards to comply      with their wishes; and whenever a boat was sent from either party      on a truce, they carried the flag of the opposite party in the bow      of the boat, and their own colours abaft.  In the afternoon Mr. Miln went with the gun-boats against Maran, to form a diversion in favour of Lieutenants Rutherford and Rogers, who had landed with two companies of seamen to carry fresh provisions to Sir Charles Grey's army. This had the desired effect, as soon after a large body of troops came down from the hills to the town and fort, which might otherwise have fallen in with the seamen on their march.  The next day, Feb. 8, the Admiral sent another flag of truce by the same officer to the town of St. Anne. He took with him an American captain of a ship, in addition to his former complement; and having been so roughly handled the day before, he also ordered a gun-boat to attend. St. Anne's was entirely deserted. The American then proceeded a mile up the country to the house of a planter, who had left it; but finding his mulatto mistress there, he left the papers with her, to forward to the commanding officer at Maran. On this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38178"],["title","An Account of the Campaign in the West Indies, in the Year 1794 (#5)"],["body","the American told us he saw three hundred slaves, and every thing in perfect order; from whence we judged the owner of it had been a friend to the revolution, the houses and plantations of the royalists being universally destroyed. The enemy now entirely evacuated this part of the country, to throw themselves into Fort Bourbon; and in their retreat burnt several fine plantations, and murdered many slaves of the royalists with circumstances of the most horrid cruelty.  I should have mentioned that, on our approach to this island, the Commanders in Chief dispatched General Dundas with Commodore Thompson to the attack of Trinité, and another division under the command of Colonel Sir Charles Gordon, assisted by Captain Rogers of the Quebec, to Case de Navirre; while Sir Charles Grey, assisted by Lieutenant General Prescott, and under cover of the Boyne, &c. made good his landing at Trois Rivieres: thus, by making three attacks upon distant parts of the island at the same time, the force and attention of the enemy was divided; and by that spirited conduct, which animated all parties, more particularly by the unanimity which prevailed between the army and navy, they all happily succeeded. And here I must beg leave to observe, that where the commanders are united in friendship, and equally inspired with an earnest desire to serve their king and country, their example will always have such influence on the conduct of those under their command, that the same friendly intercourse will be sure to subsist between the subordinate ranks of the two services; and, from the Commanders in Chief to the private soldier and sailor, they will join hand and heart, and form a phalanx that nothing can withstand.     CHAPTER IV.      MARCH OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF FROM TROIS RIVIERES TO SALLEE ...      OCCURRENCES ON THE MARCH ... GENERAL WHYTE DETACHED ... TAKES      PIGEON ISLAND ... THE ADMIRAL ANCHORS OFF PIGEON ISLAND ...      DESCRIPTION OF THE BAY OF FORT ROYAL ... THE THIRD BRIGADE LANDS AT      CAS DE NAVIRES.   I have already said that his Excellency Sir Charles Grey, with Lieutenant General Prescott, and that part of the army which landed at Trois Rivieres, marched from thence on Feb. 6th across the country to La Riviere Sallée, a distance of two leagues, over very mountainous roads, and that evening they reached the town of the same name, situated on its banks, where the troops were lodged. They met with no opposition on their march, and lost only one man (a sergeant), who died of fatigue and heat. On the march the Commander in Chief detached Brigadier General Whyte, with the second battalion of light infantry commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Close, with two amuzettes, to force the batteries of Cape Solomon and Point a Burgos, in order to get possession of Pigeon Island, as our shipping could not go into the bay of Fort Royal till that was accomplished; nor indeed could our boats with provisions and ammunition go with safety round to the army at Riviere Sallée. On Feb. 7th General Whyte took two small pieces of cannon loaded, at a village in the bay of d'Arlet (one hundred and fifty mulattoes having fled at his approach); and immediately marching to the attack of the two posts above mentioned of Point Solomon and Burgos, the enemy surrendered at discretion, their retreat being cut off. In the interim the Commander in Chief received intelligence of a body of the enemy having crossed the bay from Fort Royal, and landed near Morne Charlotte Pied, where they took post to intercept the communication between General Whyte and head quarters at Sallée: on which he instantly dispatched Adjutant-General Colonel Dundas, with the seventieth regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, with two howitzers, to dislodge them. This was executed that night with great spirit, and the post taken possession of early the next morning, the enemy being completely defeated at the first charge. In this action Captain Nares of the seventieth regiment distinguished himself so as to gain the notice of the Commander in Chief in public orders[8].       [8] Vide Appendix, page 14.  Brigadier General Whyte (being now reinforced with a detachment of the royal artillery, some ordnance, mortars, &c.) Colonel Symes, with a detachment of the fifteenth regiment and two hundred seamen from the Admiral, armed with pikes and pistols, under the command of Lieutenants Rogers and Rutherford, ascended the heights on the 9th instant, and got possession of Mount Matharine, which commanded Pigeon Island, at the distance of not more than four hundred yards, where they erected their batteries. On this day his Excellency the Admiral sailed from Maran Bay, and anchored in Petite Ance d'Arlet, from whence he could send succours of men and ammunition to General Whyte; who accordingly instantly landed two companies of seamen, with several cannon, which they in vain attempted to drag over the hills to General Whyte's post, a distance of four or five miles; for the steepness and ruggedness of the roads, rendered every effort ineffectual. However he sent him a plentiful supply of shot and other ammunition, with one howitzer; and in the evening Lieutenant Miln was dispatched with a party, carrying provisions and spirits for the army. We found the country on the march from Ance d'Arlet to General Whyte's camp beautiful in a high degree, but the roads almost impassable: a succession of steep roads, through thick woods, at length brought us to the summit of a hill (on which our seamen were posted), commanding a fine view of the bay of Fort Royal, with Islet aux Ramieres, or Pigeon Island, in front; and on each side rose hills finely clothed with wood, on one of which our little army was posted. During the time we were there, the enemy on Pigeon Island annoyed us with their shells and shot, by which one of our seamen was killed, and another mortally wounded. The two five and a half inch howitzers, brought by the seventieth regiment from head quarters, being now placed in a battery under the direction of Captain de Rivigne of the royal artillery, so as to take the island in reverse, and Colonel Dornford having also joined with a company of artificers, the batteries were completed during the night of the 10th instant, and opened on Tuesday morning, February 11th, under the conduct of Major Manley, who kept up so incessant and well-directed a fire upon Pigeon Island, that in two hours the garrison struck their colours, and surrendered at discretion, having fifteen killed and twenty-five wounded. When our batteries opened, it consisted of two hundred and three men.  After the strong orders the Commander in Chief issued during the time he was preparing for the commencement of the campaign at Barbadoes, in which, among other things, he declared his determination to punish with the utmost severity any one who should presume to maraud or plunder the inhabitants, it is surprising that on the first day's march any soldier should have had the temerity to offend against that order: but we had a melancholy instance of it in William Milton of the tenth light dragoons, and Samuel Price of the black dragoons, who were tried and convicted of a robbery in the house of Jacques, an inhabitant of Sallée; and the General, being determined to put an early stop to such enormities, had the sentence put in execution, and they were both hanged in view of the whole army on February 8th[9].       [9] Vide Appendix, pages 10, 11, 12.  On the capture of Islet aux Ramieres, or Pigeon Island, the Admiral sailed with the rest of his fleet from Ance d'Arlet on Wednesday, Feb. 12th, and anchored in Fort Royal Bay, off Pigeon Island, by which means he could co-operate with his colleague, and supply the army with ammunition and provisions at pleasure. As the ships worked into the bay, several shells were thrown at them from Fort Louis, but happily without doing any mischief.--It is impossible to conceive a more beautiful scene than presented itself on our entrance into this fine bay. On the north side we saw Fort Louis and the town of Fort Royal; and immediately behind it, on the top of a steep hill, was the strong fortification of Fort Bourbon, which, with the tri-coloured flag waving on its walls, formed a conspicuous object in the landscape; the parapet being built of white stone, strongly contrasted with the vivid glow of verdure on the surrounding hills. To the westward rose majestically prodigious mountains, called Les Pitons du Carbet, the hills on the side of which were cultivated, while the mountains themselves were covered with wood to their summits. Eastward the bay opens to several bays and harbours, into which some noble rivers discharge themselves, and pleasant islands of different dimensions and forms, embellish the whole. Pigeon Island, or Islet aux Ramieres, is situated on the south side of the bay of Fort Royal, about two hundred yards from the shore, and is a steep rock, inaccessible except on one side by a ladder fixed against a perpendicular wall. The summit is about thirty yards above the level of the sea, and is three hundred paces round. It contained the following ordnance, viz. Eleven forty-two pounders, six thirty-two pounders, four thirteen-inch mortars, and one howitzer, with an immense quantity of stores and ammunition, and a large stove to heat shot; it also had good barracks. It is famous for having prevented Admiral Rodney with twelve sail of the line from entering the bay in 1782.  On the 12th of February the fifteenth regiment, led by Major Lyon, and commanded by Captain Paumier, surprised several hundreds of the enemy, very strongly posted on the heights of le Grande Bouclain, killed several of them, and took all their ammunition and arms, with their cattle.[10]       [10] Vide Appendix, page 16.  Sir Charles Gordon with the third brigade had landed on the 8th instant to leeward, on the side of Cas de Navires, under cover of a division of the fleet commanded by Captain Rogers in "]]]
