However, in part of the region near Gogebic Lake extensive arbor-vitae swamps are reported to occur. In the vicinity of Little Girl's Point arbor-vitae swamps are common, occupying the wet lower northern slopes of the high ridge.  In a swamp of this type three miles southeast of the point arbor-vitae is the dominant tree, reaching trunk diameters of two feet and more. Under the dense shade of the high forest crown there are many young trees of the same species, and the forest has evidently reached a temporary climax. Of other trees, a few small yellow birch, a few young firs and hemlocks, and one fallen white spruce (_Picea canadensis_) were noted. The ground is very wet and there are numerous tiny streams, which frequently disappear under the ground. Fallen trees and decaying logs on the ground make a thick tangle, very difficult to penetrate. The underbrush is scanty; mountain maple is rather common, and there are a few young black ashes. Much moss grows on the ground and on the decaying logs.  In a depression two miles south of Little Girl's Point is a mixed growth of arbor-vitae, black spruce, with a few black ashes. The trees are mostly small, none of them exceeding about eight inches in trunk diameter. In August the ground was very wet, there being standing water in some places, and the ground was heavily covered with sphagnum. This situation may be considered transitional between the black spruce bog and the arbor-vitae swamp. No traps for mammals were set in this situation.   _Bogs_  _Leather leaf bog habitat:_ In the northwestern corner of Fish-hawk Lake and at several places along the channel connecting Lindsley and Cisco lakes a heavy growth of leather leaf (_Chamaedaphne calyculata_) adjoins and overhangs the water, a considerable portion of the growth actually floating on the water. With the leather leaf is associated much sweet gale (_Myrica gale_) and alders, and these plants form almost the entire mat in some of the wetter areas. At other places sphagnum becomes abundant and the conditions approach those of a sphagnum bog. Other plants commonly found in the leather leaf bog in the Cisco Lake Region are the Labrador tea (_Ledum groenlandicum_), swamp laurel (_Kalmia potifolia_), wild rosemary (_Andromeda glaucophylla_), small cranberry (_Oxycoccus oxycoccus_), pitcher-plant (_Sarracenia purpurea_), and small trees of black spruce and tamarack. In a typical leather leaf bog on the Ontonagon River near the outlet from Thousand Island Lake a large beaver house is located.  _Sphagnum bog habitat:_ In a restricted sense the name is here applied to the part of a bog which is free from trees. It differs from the leather leaf bog in having a greater amount of sphagnum, for while the leather leaf bog when first developed over the water has little or no sphagnum, the sphagnum bog, as here considered, is almost entirely covered by sphagnum. The shrubs found in the two situations are apparently identical, except that the leather leaf is less abundant. A small bog of this type borders the edge of Mud Lake in the Cisco Lake Region, and small parts of many bogs are free from trees. So far as was determined, the mammal fauna is the same as that for the black spruce--tamarack bog, from which the only difference is the absence of trees.  _Black Spruce--Tamarack Bog habitat:_ The dominant bog tree in this region is the black spruce (_Picea mariana_), which is usually small and stunted. With the black spruces are a lesser number of small tamaracks (_Larix larcina_), which in places may be dominant. The ground is heavily covered with sphagnum, which is normally soaked with water. Shrubs are abundant, though usually not forming a closed mat. Of the shrubs the leather leaf is the most abundant, though Kalmia, Andromeda, Ledum, and blueberries are common. A few young white pines and red maples were noted. Sedges occur frequently, and the pitcher plant is very characteristic.   _Forests_  _Hemlock forest habitat:_ In the Cisco Lake Region groves of hemlock (_Tsuga canadensis_) frequently occupy the lower parts of steep slopes adjoining the lakes. One such area studied is made up of practically a pure stand of hemlocks, the trunks being from about 6 to 18 inches in diameter. A few very old yellow birches are present, and also a few young sugar maples and arbor-vitae, the latter chiefly near the water's edge. Shrubs and herbs are nearly absent, and the forest floor is covered by a thick carpet of dead needles. There are many decaying logs, usually covered by a thin coat of moss. In the Little Girl's Point Region nearly pure stands of large hemlocks cover many of the lower parts of steep slopes and also occur commonly on well-drained soil elsewhere. In the vicinity of the north end of Gogebic Lake a few small groves of hemlocks were noted, but the ground in general is so low and swampy that the species mostly occurs as a part of the mixed forest of the region. Animals are rare in the habitat.  _White pine forest habitat:_ White pine (_Pinus strobus_), which formerly was a common forest tree in northern Michigan, has now been mostly removed for lumber. Near Little Girl's Point a small natural grove of this species was studied, occupying a moderate southerly slope above a black spruce bog. The area is about 50 by 150 meters in size. White pines are by far the most numerous and dominant tree, the trunks measuring up to about five feet in diameter. In the grove yellow birch, some of large size, are common; toward the bottom of the slope hemlocks are also common; and near the edge of the bog there are a few arbor-vitae. Shrubs are almost absent, there being merely a few small seedlings of arbor-vitae, hemlock, and fir, mostly toward the bottom of the slope. A few scattered clumps of grass appear, but the forest floor is mostly covered only by a thick carpet of dry pine needles. Numerous dead limbs and sticks have fallen from the pines.  _Wet hardwood forest habitat:_ The land adjoining much of Gogebic Lake is low and poorly drained. Here is found a mixed forest dominated by sugar maple (_Acer saccharum_), black maple, hemlock, yellow birch (_Betula lutea_), linden, elm (_Ulmus americana_), ash (not black ash), and ironwood (_Ostrya virginiana_). The hardwoods are decidedly dominant over the conifers. The forest crown is high and closed, and the trees are large. The underbrush in general is scanty, though in some places there is a thick growth of mountain maple (_Acer spicatum_) and of sugar maple seedlings. Leatherwood (_Dirca palustris_), hazel, ferns, and a few young firs (_Abies balsamea_) also occur.  Some of the lower forests in the Cisco Lake Region approach the wet hardwood forest type, though none are extensive in area, and they are usually surrounded and dominated by the dry forest condition.  _Dry hardwood forest habitat:_ The highest development of the dry hardwood type of forest was found on the upper parts of the moderately high ridge near Little Girl's Point. The slopes in general are very gentle, but well drained. The forest here is dominated by the sugar maple (_Acer saccharum_), yellow birch (_Betula lutea_), and linden (_Tilia americana_). Hemlocks are rare, and only one elm was seen. The trees are large, the trunks frequently reaching diameters of two feet or more. The forest crown is high and heavy. Underbrush is scanty and low, being mostly young seedlings of sugar maple, though seedlings of linden are numerous. Other shrubs and herbs noted were the leatherwood (_Dirca palustris_), hazel (_Corylus rostrata_), yew (_Taxus canadensis_), gooseberry, ferns, false Solomon's seal, and grass. On the ground are many decaying leaves, these usually forming a heavy carpet; decaying logs and freshly fallen sticks are common.  In the Cisco Lake Region the drainage is not so good as in the vicinity of Little Girl's Point, and the forests of that district are of a type somewhat intermediate between the wet hardwood forest and the dry hardwood forest. In the Cisco Lake Region the topography is much broken, there being many small hills and ridges, and many small depressions, often poorly drained. In the damp depressions, if not wet enough for a bog, arbor-vitae and hemlock are common, while on the ridges sugar maple and linden are characteristic, though hemlock occurs here sparingly also. There is accordingly much local variation in tree forms, but the whole forest is decidedly of a hardwood type.  The dry hardwood forests of the Little Girl's Point Region are inhabited by many deer-mice, while only a few of this species are found in the wet hardwood forests near Gogebic Lake, bob-tailed shrews being there the most abundant mammal and red-backed voles being common, both of which are rare in the other districts. In the dry hardwood forest near Little Girl's Point four woodland jumping mice (Napaeozapus) were taken, while in the Cisco Lake Region only two were taken in a period twice as long, and at Gogebic Lake none were secured. These observations indicate that moisture conditions in hardwood forests have an important influence on the mammal fauna.   _Mountains_  _Rock-bluff habitat:_ Rock exposures are rare in the region studied. However there are several high hills with steep exposures of rock a short distance north of Ironwood and Bessemer. These hills could not be studied in the time available, and the only cliff examined was on a small range of hills northeast of the station of Lake Gogebic. On one of these hills is a nearly perpendicular rock cliff about 200 feet high and facing to the southward. The small talus slope at the bottom is overgrown with shrubs and trees, and on the small ledges and gullies of the face of the cliff a few small trees, shrubs, and herbs are also growing. The most conspicuous plants of the rock habitat are scrub oaks, aspens, and heaths. No trapping was done in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37753"],["title","Notes on the Mammals of Gogebic and Ontonagon Counties, Michigan, 1920 (#3)"],["body","bitat, and no notes on mammals were secured. Probably the mammal fauna is not very large.  _Mountain-heath habitat:_ A narrow, poorly developed belt of heath fringes the upper edge of the rock cliff examined north of Lake Gogebic. Characteristic plants are the blueberry and bearberry, mixed with creeping juniper and a few scattered grasses. The habitat is very narrow and is closely encroached upon by shrubs and trees, such as sumac, cherry, white pine, jack pine, oaks, aspens, and paper birch. Signs of fox were noted at the edge of the cliff, but no trapping was carried on here.   _Air_  _Aerial habitat:_ The only aerial mammals are the bats, of which four species were taken during the summer. The flying squirrel is not considered to be a true aerial form.   _Burns and Clearings_  Fires have been numerous throughout northern Michigan and a large part of the region is covered by various stages in the succession following fires or clearings. The areas studied were selected as representative of the natural conditions of the peninsula, but even in these districts there are many burned areas.  Many large areas have been heavily logged over, sometimes followed by fire, with a result similar to that of a fire. In the region studied there are numerous small clearings, some of which are in use as the residences of settlers, but most have been allowed to revert to a wild condition. The stages in succession on an abandoned clearing seem to be similar to those following a fire, and they are here considered together.  _Herbaceous stage:_ After a fire in a forest in this region the first vegetation to spring up seems to be the herbs, of which the fireweed (_Chamaenerion angustifolium_) is most prominent. A number of areas dominated by this type of vegetation were seen, but the type seems to be short-lived, and is probably quickly replaced by shrubs and tree seedlings. The stages in succession following a fire in swampy areas may be somewhat different from that in a hardwood region, but no data was obtained. No opportunity presented itself to study the mammals of the herbaceous stage, and I have no records for the species found there.  _Shrub stage:_ Following a fire or clearing in a hardwood area the herbaceous stage is apparently quickly followed by a thick growth of shrubs and young trees. The characters of the shrub growth vary considerably with the texture of the soil, amount of soil moisture, slope, and completeness of burning. The growth is usually quite thick, though in some clearings where the growth has been kept down for some time there may be open grassy patches. In small clearings near Fish-hawk Lake the raspberry (_Rubus strigosus_) is a characteristic species, but near Little Girl's Point it is much less common. A large area of shrub studied near Little Girl's Point is on a rather steep slope facing to the north, though part is at the bottom of the hill on a very gentle slope. There are no large trees, but saplings up to 2-1/2-inch trunks occur; most, however, are smaller. The quaking and large-toothed aspens (_Populus tremuloides_ and _P. grandidentata_), paper and yellow birches (_Betula papyrifera_ and _B. lutea_), sugar maple, and linden are common seedlings. Shrubs, such as the sumac (_Rhus hirta_), wild cherry (_Prunus pennsylvanica_), raspberry, willows (Salix spp.), mountain maple, red-berried elder (_Sambucus racemosa_), and hazel are common. A few herbs, like the fireweed, golden-rod, and pearly everlasting, occur in open places.  A number of mammals are found in the shrub stage, but they are far less abundant than in mature hardwood forest.  _Paper birch--aspen stage:_ The continued growth of the young trees in the shrub stage leads to the production of a sapling forest of the more quickly growing species, the paper birches and aspens. Often one or other of these species becomes dominant to the practical exclusion of the other, but sometimes both occur together. On the slopes near the lakes of the Cisco Lake chain aspens are rare, and the sapling forests on the clearings and burns are almost a pure stand of paper birch. Near Watersmeet, however, the aspen seems to be the dominant form, and few paper birches were seen. Near Gogebic Lake, also, the quaking aspen is the dominant form, though paper birches are common in the sapling forests. The growth in these sapling forests is very thick, and the ground is nearly bare of vegetation, though it is heavily covered with dead sticks and small logs. In a thick growth of quaking aspens, on wet ground studied near Gogebic Lake, a number of alders and paper birches, a few young trees of sugar maple and arbor-vitae, and a rare elm occur. A scanty undergrowth of mountain maple and numerous sugar maple seedlings is present. Few mammals are found in this stage of the forest.  On the western slope of Birch Point on Cisco Lake there is a good stand of paper birches, growing in an open stand with much grass in the spaces between the trees. This place has been much used for camping and it may be that the development of the grass is the result of opening the forest by clearing out some of the trees. Among the birches are numerous young firs and white pines, with a few young sugar maples, and a rare arbor-vitae. The birches show many signs of age, and would evidently, if undisturbed, soon give way to a forest dominated by the pines and firs. In the grass among these trees deer-mice, red-backed voles, and jumping mice (Zapus) were taken. Signs of snowshoe hare were seen.  _Young hardwood forest stage:_ On the eastern slope of a low ridge at Birch Point, Cisco Lake, a young hardwood forest is rapidly replacing a former growth of paper birches which has followed a fire. In this growth numerous old paper birches still persist, but they are being strongly crowded by a thick growth of vigorous young sugar maples, some of which have trunk diameters up to about eight inches, and which form a dense shade. Among the maples are numerous young firs and a few young hemlocks and arbor-vitae. The ground is mostly bare, being scantily covered by leaves. The soil is moist, but there is no grass and little brush. In this habitat deer-mice were taken, and one red squirrel was seen.   _Artificial Conditions_  _Overflow swamp habitat:_ Due to the rise in water-level of the lakes of the Cisco Lake chain many low areas of forest have been flooded and killed. Many of the dead trunks of these trees still remain standing, mixed with fallen and decaying logs in the water. Locally these habitats are called \"overflow swamps,\" a name here adopted for the habitat. There is little living vegetation in these swamps, an occasional water lily being almost the only plant present. Porcupines commonly walk out on the logs of the swamp to secure the water lily leaves, and probably the mink occasionally runs over the logs in its movements along the waterways.  _Cultivated-field habitat:_ Cleared fields occur only sparingly in the regions visited, and these fields are small in size. No study of their inhabitants was made, though silver-haired bats were collected while they were flying over a small clearing in the Little Girl's Point Region.  _Edificarian habitat:_ Towns and buildings are not very common in northern Michigan. In and around a cabin on Lindsley Lake a number of deer-mice were trapped, and signs that porcupines had invaded the cabin were noted.     ANNOTATED LIST OF MAMMALS  _Condylura cristata._ Star-nosed Mole.      Tall-sedge, 2. Two were trapped September 3 and 5, 1920, in a short, open runway in very moist soil at the edge of a small ditch running through tall sedges in a beaver meadow near Gogebic Lake, Ontonagon County.  _Sorex personatus personatus._ Masked Shrew.      Grassy-meadow, 2.     Black spruce--tamarack bog, 2.     Wet hardwood forest, 3.     Dry hardwood forest, 3.     Shrub stage, 2.  In the Cisco Lake Region in July, one was taken in a small black spruce bog, two in a narrow tongue of grass between tall sedges and sphagnum bordering Mud Lake, three in the wetter parts of the hardwood forest, and three in the upland, well-drained hardwood forest. Near Little Girl's Point in August, two were taken in a growth of shrubs in a burn. Near Gogebic Lake, Ontonagon County, one was taken September 4 in a black spruce bog.  _Sorex richardsonii._ Richardson Shrew.      Tall-sedge, 15.     Grassy-meadow, 1.     Sphagnum bog, 1.  This species was found only in or near tall sedges growing in moist or marshy situations. In the Cisco Lake Region six were taken near Mud Lake in July. Four of these were taken in tall sedges, one in grass alongside the sedges, and one in sphagnum between the sedges and the lake. August 30 to September 5, eleven were taken in tall sedges in a beaver meadow near Gogebic Lake, Ontonagon County.  An adult female trapped at Mud Lake, July 30, contained five large embryos. There were two pairs of inguinal and one pair of abdominal mammae. Another adult female trapped in the same place, July 22, had two pairs of inguinal mammae, but no abdominal mammae were found.  The latter individual was moulting, patches of new fur having replaced the old on the top of the head midway between the ears and eyes, between the shoulders, and on the rump. The other female mentioned above, taken July 30, had nearly completed her moult.  Only two specimens have been previously recorded from Michigan, one from Alger County and the other from Chippewa County.[2]  _Neosorex palustris palustris._ Marsh Shrew, Water Shrew.      Tall-sedge, 1.     Ditch-border, 3.  September 1 a marsh shrew was trapped in the tall sedges of a beaver meadow near Gogebic Lake, Ontonagon County. Most of the body had been eaten by some carnivore. Other specimens were taken on each of the two succeeding days, and a fourth on September 5.  The first specimen taken was trapped eight feet from a tiny stream which flowed through the marshy sedges. Two of the others were taken on the muddy bank of the stream near the"]]]
