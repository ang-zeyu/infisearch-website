My saving plan exception scorns[7].     Man's will?--Nay, mine alone. As recompense, I claim the right                                 550     To sit on yonder Throne!\"  Ceased Lucifer. The breathless hush     Resumed and denser grew. All eyes were turned; the general gaze     One common magnet drew. A moment there was solemn pause--     Listened eternity, While rolled from lips omnipotent     The Father's firm decree:  \"Jehovah, thou my Messenger[8]!                                  560     Son Ahman, thee I send; And one shall go thy face before,[9]     While twelve thy steps attend. And many more on that far shore     The pathway shall prepare, That I, the first, the last may come,     And earth my glory share.  \"After and ere thy going down,     An army shall descend-- The host of God, and house of him                                570     Whom I have named my friend[10]. Through him, upon Idumea[11],     Shall come, all life to leaven, The guileless ones, the sovereign sons,     Throned on the heights of heaven.  \"Go forth, thou Chosen of the Gods,     Whose strength shall in thee dwell! Go down betime and rescue earth,     Dethroning death and hell. On thee alone man's fate depends,                                580     The fate of beings all. Thou shalt not fail, though thou art free--     Free, but too great to fall.  \"By arm divine, both mine and thine,     The lost thou shalt restore, And man, redeemed, with God shall be,     As God forevermore. Return, and to the parent fold     This wandering planet bring[12], And earth shall hail thee Conqueror,                             590     And heaven proclaim thee King.\"  'Twas done. From congregation vast,     Tumultuous murmurs rose; Waves of conflicting sound, as when     Two meeting seas oppose. 'Twas finished. But the heavens wept;     And still their annals tell How one was choice of Elohim,     O'er one who fighting fell.  ---  A stranger star that came from far                               600     To fling its silver ray, Where, cradled in a lowly cave,     A lowlier infant lay; And led by soft sidereal light,     The orient sages bring Bare gifts of gold and frankincense,     To greet the homeless King.  O wondrous grace! Will gods go down     Thus low that men may rise? Imprisoned here the Mighty One,                                  610     Who reigned in yonder skies? Hark to that chime!--What tongue sublime     Now tells the hour of noon[13]? O dying world! art welcoming     Life's life--Light's sun and moon[14]?  Proclaim Him, prophet harbinger!     Make plain the Mightier's way, Thou sharer of His martyrdom!     Elias? Yea and Nay[15]. The crescent moon, that knew the Sun,                            620     Ere stars had learned to shine[16]; The waning moon, that bathed in blood,     Ere sank the Sun divine.  \"Glory to God!--good will to man!--     Peace, peace!\"--triumphal tone. \"Why peace?\" Is discord then no more?     Are earth and heaven as one? Peace to the soul that serveth Him,     The monarch manger-born; There, ruler of unnumbered realms;                               630     Here, throneless and forlorn.  He wandered through the faithless world,     A prince in shepherd guise; He called his scattered flock, but few     The Voice did recognize; For minds upborne by hollow pride,     Or dimmed by sordid lust, Ne'er look for kings in beggar's garb,     For diamonds in the dust.  Wept He above a city doomed[17],                                 640     Her temple, walls, and towers, O'er palaces where recreant priests     Usurped unhallowed powers. \"I am the way, the life, the light!\"     Alas! 'twas heeded not. Ignored--nay, mocked--God scorned by man!--     And spurned the truth He taught.  O bane of damning unbelief!     When, when till now so rife? Thou stumbling stone, thou barrier 'thwart                       650     The gates of endless life! O love of self, and mammon lust,     Twin portals to despair, Where bigotry, the blinded bat,     Flaps through the midnight air!  Through these, gloom-wrapt Gethsemane[18]!     Thy glens of guilty shade Grieved o'er the sinless Son of God,     By gold-bought kiss betrayed; Beheld Him unresisting dragged,                                  660     Forsaken, friendless, lone, To halls where dark-browed hatred sat     On judgment's lofty throne.  As sheep before His shearers, dumb,     Those patient lips were mute; The clamorous charge of taunting tongues     He deigned not to dispute. They smote with cruel palm a face     Which felt yet bore the sting; Then crowned with thorns His quivering brow,                     670     And, mocking, hailed him \"King!\"  Transfixt He hung,--O crime of crimes!--     The God whom worlds adore. \"Father forgive them!\" Drained the dregs;     Immanuel[19]--no more. No more where thunders shook the earth,     Where lightnings tore the gloom, Saw that unconquered Spirit spurn     The shackles of the tomb.  Far-flaming might, a sword of light,                             680     A falchion from its sheath, It cleft the realms of darkness, and     Dissolved the bands of death. Hell's dungeons burst, wide open swung     The everlasting bars, Whereby the ransomed soul shall win     Those heights beyond the stars.     CANTO FOUR  Night And The Wilderness[1]   A World o'ershadowed by an Eagle's wings[2], From Scythian snows to hot Hamitic sands, From Ganges on to Tiber and the Thames.                          690  Where goeth forth, unwittingly the tool Of Truth Eterne, a pathway to prepare, The law and legion of imperial Rome, Mighty to crush and to consolidate, Humbling the hard, the haughty, making way For peace to flow[3] wider than war can wound Servant unknowingly of Him she slew, In pandering to Judah's jealousy.  Victim now Victor, conqueror captive led, Debtor to justice, darkness serving day,                         700 Upon her knotted neck Jehovah's heel, Her iron hand the Nazarene's defense, Holding in quell the hierarchal hate, Curbing the cruel wrath of Greek and Jew; Israel from Israel's madness made secure-- Lamb from the Lion, by the She-Wolf's might[4].  Ere rose the Iron-Limbed[5], all conquering, Throned on the wreck of empires earlier born, Wrought well for Him the brazen loin of power, The pard-like phalanx, swift, invincible,                        710 Spreading the glories of a sapient tongue, The wing whereon a higher wisdom flew, Till teemed, of Aryan clans, the Asian kin[6], Seedlings of Japheth, sire of the Gentile world. Soul-widening word, broad-sown by Grecia's hand, To blossom on a furrowed heathen ground.  Servant, erstwhile, the silver-breasted realm, Kingdom of Kurush[7], shepherd of the King, Whose sword, that gave the Jew deliverance, To golden Babylon the guillotine.                                720  Whoe'er hath swayed, or yet shall sway, the world, By tongue or pen, by sword or sceptered rule, Hath served, or yet shall serve, the sovereign aim Of Him who wills the welfare of mankind; For or against, promoting still His plan, Helping, not hindering, a conquering Cause.  Gone the great Sun--set but to rise again, More glorious from a night of martyrdom; Set here to rise on realms and times untold; All worlds, God's lofty vineyards[8], visiting.                  730  Linger the spirit Moon and speaking Stars[9], Crowning with light the Woman Wonderful[10].  Fair as the morn, though tearful as the eve; Risen as from the rocky sepulchre, Where slept betimes the body of her Lord; Clothed, crowned, and shod, with glory's symboling[11]; Ere winging to the vast invisible, Returning to the restful wilderness, She bides to hope, to labor, and endure, All depths, all heights, with Him inheriting.                    740  Henceforth with her another Comforter, Vicegerent[12] of the vanished Majesty, Of heavenly Three, the unembodied One[13], Proceeding from the presence of the Sire, To manifest the meaning of the Son; Giver of gifts from Him, the glory-crowned, Fountain of memory and of prophecy.  After and ere,[14] Messiah's Minister, Creative hand, omnific arm of God; Holder with Christ of resurrection's key,                        750 The quickener of the living and the dead. Lamp of the worlds, life of the universe, Eternal spring of energy divine-- Life, Light, and Love, magnetic mystery, Whereby all things upheld and heavenward drawn.  Prophet still pleading[15] in the wilderness, The promise of a perfect yet to come; Proclaimer of the heavenly commonweal, Kingdom upon and yet not of the earth, Whose portal none can enter, none can see,                       760 Save born anew--born of a dual birth, By mystic fatherhood and motherhood Begotten sons and daughters unto God, Whose Spirit, omnipresent, immanent, Unwearied, strives by countless ministries, By might of word, by miracle of deed, Mankind to win, wooing while hope remains.  Henceforth with her that holy gift and guide, Truth's high revealer and interpreter; Henceforth with her the Father and the Son,                      770 Absent, yet present by the Comforter; Of great lights twain, the lesser, ruling night, Moon to that Sun, whose realm the rounded Day.  Resplendent night, while flame those fluent stars[16], That still a spotless brow bediadem; Circling forever round their central Light, And, Him withdrawn, repeating from afar, And gladdening with His rays a gloom-hung world.  As set that Sun, sinking in seas of blood, Sinking to soar above a mightier morrow,                         780 Follow the lingering stars, save haply one[17], Through mystic night of ages sparkling lone, And speaking in high splendor things to come. Most lustrous of the living lamps of God, 'Mid human lights, divinely luminant. Rarest of twelve, remaining oracle, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37718"],["title","Elias: An Epic of the Ages (#4)"],["body","unto a wondrous destiny; Pilot of peoples, nations, tribes and tongues, Leading the lost[18] ones from captivity. Beloved of Love--life's King, death's Conqueror,                 790 Tarrying by will of Him through troubled time, Lighting the way unto eternity.  And thou, e'en thou, O Woman Wonderful! Safe for a season from the She-Wolf's maw, Far borne, east, west, on power's imperial wings, Nourished 'neath Caesar's shield, till Caesar's sword Hath turned upon and made thee desolate. Thou too must pass--not perish--in thy time. Betrayed to foes without, by false within, E'en as thy Lord thou sufferest martyrdom.                       800  But what avails to baffle Him or bind? Vain, dragon, vain thy deluge of deceit, Thy flood of lies, thou false one from of old! Vain, wrath of devils and of men combined, Bent to defile the sacred Bride of Christ. Triumphs the Man-Child[19], heaven now summons home; Triumphs the Woman in the wilderness, 'Scaping the jaws, the hungering gates of hell, That 'gainst the mortal part alone prevail; Body, not spirit, crushed and all o'ercome.                      810  Throned upon higher worlds, she reigneth still; And here shall rise unto the regnant place, When rolls the stone upon the image doomed, When God hath fanned with fire His threshing floor.  Till then proud Japheth sways[20], while Jacob mourns, Fainting 'neath yokes and fardels, prostrate, prone, With Judah undermost, the last of all The trampled tribes to taste of liberty. Haply ordained a lesser power to wield, Antaeus-like[21], from touching of the ground;                   820 Bent, curst, yet clutching, and by might of gold Conquering his dust-adoring conqueror[22].  For God, through all, remembers Abraham, Ordained of old His lineal house to be. Came not the Christ their covenant to fulfill? Who but an Israel might offer Him? Whose hand than Judah's might Jehovah slay? \"His blood be on our head\"--Ay, rests it there! Weightier than worlds by that high death redeemed.  World-wandering Saul! Was this thy symboling:                    830 The Jew struck blind that Gentile hosts might see[23]?  Predestined Israel, martyred, immolate[24], That nations, blood-besprent, might look and live; A burden-bearer for the universe, Outcast and homeless for humanity, Descending like his Lord all else below, And yet with Him to rise all else above, Extremes of woe and weal encompassing, Wisdom by sweet and bitter made more wise.  From blight springs blessing, and from darkness day;             840 E'en Canaan's neck from 'neath the yoke[25] shall come. Japheth shall feel the Spirit minister, And Jacob see and hear his risen Lord[26].  Departed now the Woman Wonderful, Gone with the spirit gift and guiding power; O'ercome, world-conquered, sinks degenerate The washed one to his wallowing in the mire[27]; A drowsy dreamer of the self-same dreams Dispelled erewhile by lightnings of her eye;  The heaven-lit torch[28] that made the pathway plain             850 O'er rugged mount, through mazy catacomb, Now dimmed with incense from Diana's shrine[29], And dashed in pieces 'gainst a pagan throne, Where prematurely changed was cross for crown, And Christ's flock fleeced by shearing compromise[30].  God still with man, though not with man's misrule; Still with the just, though Christian-pagan turn His prurient ear to fables, from the truth, And, virtueless as Judah's pharisee, And graceless as Iscariot, self-hung,                            860 Parts in the midst, as wide as East from West[31], False church and faithless empire, faction-torn, Twain as the imaged legs of Babel's dream, A split colossus, fallen 'twixt Greece and Rome.  God still with man, though not with man's misrule, Never with thee, daughter of force and fraud, Mother of guile--thy refuge and thy shame! Never with thee, thou wanton by the way, Roaming tradition's tangled wilderness, Lost in a night that seemeth to thee day;                        870 In crooked paths that fain would straight appear; Warming thy withered fingers o'er the coals Alive 'mid ashes of the ancient fires, Where She was wont[32] to kindle faith, hope, love, And flash the beacon o'er a wandering world. There holding to thy heart an empty urn, There cherishing a name, a memory, Mumbling vain prayers, \"Lord, Lord,\" protesting still, And still forgetful of thy Lord's command!  Nay, not with thee, thou crimson courtesan[33],                  880 Robed in the horrid hue of countless crimes! Fierce dragon's maw, thrice-cruel murderess, Thy hands a-reek with blood of innocence, With blood of prophets, blood of priests and kings, Whose martyred souls sue vengeance, judgment-sworn! Vengeance on thee, thou slaughterer of saints, Vengeance on him, thy sceptered paramour, Whose princes ten (while Mammon's host shall wail), Loathing where once they loved all lustfully, And lived, as thou hast lived, deliciously,                      890 When found no more God's wheat 'mid Satan's tares, When thou art saltless, saintless, savorless, When thou art ripened unto rottenness, Shall give thy crumbling body to be burned.  Nay, Anti-Christ, presuming tyranny, Never with thee, usurping power of sin! Plotting to sway Jehovah's sovereignty, To rear thy throne where His alone shall stand; Perdition, warring 'gainst the Saints of God, And overcoming till the Judgment sits[34],                       900 When swift-winged morn shall overtake the night, And glory lift the gloom[35] of centuries.  Meanwhile the mission of the Moonlike One[36], Brooding above the waters of the world, Stronger than storms, mightier than wind or wave, Moving on mortal seas, on human souls; Dynamic impulse of Divinity, Impelling to all action[37] wise, sublime.  That high Ambassador of Elohim, The Spirit Messenger Omnipotent,                                 910 Declare His goings-forth, His sendings tell.  Ye patriarchs and prophets of old time! Ye seers and bards of sacred Israel! Elect of God, earth-wandering witnesses, Sowers on goodly and on stony ground! Souls mercy-sent, man's erring steps to win From folly's paths of wickedness and strife, To wisdom's way of purity and peace! Shepherds to fold and feed a wolf-torn flock, Holding the hallowed keys that loose and bind!                   920 Tell me--are ye alone truth's harbingers? Are ye alone forerunners of the Light?  Nay, for as kings and conquerors they come; Anon, as champions of democracy; Founders of faiths and stern iconoclasts; Sword, tongue and pen of progress and reform. The fountain lights of literature, whose rays Spill their white splendor on the hills of fame; Masters of melody, whose strains awake The slumbering memories of eternity;                             930 Pilgrims to continents and climes unknown, Uncurtained for the play of liberty, Now nearing the finale of her dreams, Dreams that shall waken to reality; Waste-winners; probers of the polar way; Invention's wizards, wielding magic might-- Launching fleet words on atmospheric wave, Cleaving with bird-like wing the shoreless blue, Outspeeding speed, outblazing brilliancy, Thrilling the world with lightning's vivid wand,                 940 Ruling all realms with scintillating sway; Sages in art, in science past profound, Subduing matter and exploring mind, Sounding the depths of psychic mystery, Scaling thought's pinnacles, that pierce the night, To greet the early glintings of the morn. These also are the mighty, kin to those, Divinest of Jehovah's messengers. Each hath his freedom, and succeeds or fails, But all subserve the Will Omnipotent.                            950  What though some wayward son of Deity[38], Builder, o'erthrower, of imperial thrones, In wrongful act of rightful agency, Here drench with blood, here pave with shattered bones, To heights of crumbling power and futile fame! Is God then mocked? Made void His vast design? Creator foiled by creature? Vain the fear! Speeds ne'er to earth a spoiler of His plan, Nor spares His rod a recreant messenger.  Whate'er betide, the soul that sins atones:                      960 The grievous sceptre and the slaughtering sword, The bloodstained ax, the gory guillotine, The tyrant wrong, the tyrant-trampling right, Join to make justice of the direst doom.  All oracles of light, all arms of power, Preparers of the way one face before; Their strength but part of His omnipotence, Their fault God-given lest man be deified, And pride in him dethrone humility.  Declare His truth, His generations tell,                         970 O'er whom the many marveled, some to say Elias, slain of Herod, lives again; While some said Jeremias[39]. Who say ye, Man-hated, though God-missioned ministers, Unctioned with fire, anointed from on High! Guardians yet watchful o'er the widening fold! Who say ye was your Master, Teacher, Friend?  \"Word that was God, is God, and shall be aye; Sire by the spirit, and by flesh the Son; In glory with the Father ere the world,                          980 And now with that same glory glorified. Image and likeness of creation's cause, Mirror and model of humanity[40], Of man the parent and the prototype. Lover of light, hating and righting wrong; Anointed Lord of Lords and Sire 'mid Sons; The Sole-begotten, He that doeth here All He hath seen erstwhile the Father do. Elias? Nay, Messiah, Saviour, King, That Greater whom Elias said would come.\"                        990  Sufficeth it. What now, ye learned ones, School-taught, self-sent, man-missioned ministers, Creators of a vain divinity! Daring the thunders of the decalogue, Disputing Moses, Christ, and prophets all, Gird up your loins and answer--What of God? \"God?--Mystery incomprehensible[41]; All things made He from nothing\"--Hold, enough! Night and gross darkness--darken it no more.  Yet give to man his meed. Hath he not kept,                     1000 Albeit in empty urn, the Name of Names, And toiled and suffered sore transmitting it From sire to son through shaded centuries?"]]]
