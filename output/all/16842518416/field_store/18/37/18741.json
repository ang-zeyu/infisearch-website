Nearly half a century ago, Stebbins worked out a way of measuring the altitude of migrating birds by the principle of parallax. In this method, the distance of a bird from the observers is calculated from its apparent displacement on the moon as seen through two telescopes. Stebbins and his colleague, Carpenter, published the results of two nights of observation at Urbana, Illinois (Stebbins, 1906; Carpenter, 1906); and then the idea was dropped until 1945, when Rense and I briefly applied an adaptation of it to migration studies at Baton Rouge. Results have been inconclusive. This is partly because sufficient work has not been done, partly because of limitations in the method itself. If the two telescopes are widely spaced, few birds are seen by both observers, and hence few parallaxes are obtained. If the instruments are brought close together, the displacement of the images is so reduced that extremely fine readings of their positions are required, and the margin of error is greatly increased. Neither alternative can provide an accurate representative sample of the altitudinal distribution of migrants at a station on a single night. New approaches currently under consideration have not yet been perfected.  Meanwhile the idea of uniform vertical distribution of migrants must be dismissed from serious consideration on logical grounds. We know that bird flight cannot extend endlessly upward into the sky, and the notion that there might be a point to which bird density extends in considerable magnitude and then abruptly drops off to nothing is absurd. It is far more likely that the migrants gradually dwindle in number through the upper limits at which they fly, and the parallax observations we have seem to support this view.  Under these conditions, there would be a lighter incidence of birds in the sample triangle than in the upright triangle beside it (Figure 11, Diagram III). Compensation can be made by deliberately scaling down the computed size of the sample area below its actual size. A procedure for doing this is explained in Figure 11. If it were applied to present altitudinal data, it would place the computational flight ceiling somewhere below 4000 feet. In arriving at the flight densities used in this paper, however, I have used an assumed ceiling of one mile. When the altitude factor is thus assigned a value of 1, it disappears from the formula, simplifying computations. Until the true situation with respect to the vertical distribution of flight is better understood, it seems hardly worthwhile to sacrifice the convenience of this approximation to a rigorous interpretation of scanty data. This particular uncertainty, however, does not necessarily impair the analytical value of the computations. Provided that the vertical pattern of migration is more or less constant, flight densities still afford a sound basis for comparisons, wherever we assume the upper flight limits to be. Raising or lowering the flight ceiling merely increases or reduces all sample cones or triangles proportionately.  A more serious possibility is that the altitudinal pattern may vary according to time or place. This might upset comparisons. If the divergencies were severe enough and frequent enough, they could throw the study of flight densities into utter confusion.  This consideration of possible variation in the altitudinal pattern combines with accidents of sampling and the concessions to perfect accuracy, explained on pages 379-385, to give to small quantities of data an equivocal quality. As large-scale as the present survey is from one point of view, it is only a beginning. Years of intensive work and development leading to a vast accumulation of data must elapse before the preliminary indications yet discernible assume the status of proved principles. As a result, much of the discussion in Part II of this paper is speculative in intent, and most of the conclusions suggested are of a provisional nature. Yet, compared with similar procedures in its field, flight density study is a highly objective method, and a relatively reliable one. In no other type of bird census has there ever been so near a certainty of recording _all_ of the individuals in a specified space, so nearly independently of the subjective interpretations of the observer. The best assurance of the essential soundness of the flight density computations lies in the coherent results and the orderly patterns that already emerge from the analyses presented in Part II.   B. OBSERVATIONAL PROCEDURE AND THE PROCESSING OF DATA  At least two people are required to operate an observation station--one to observe, the other to record the results. They should exchange duties every hour to avoid undue eye fatigue. Additional personnel are desirable so that the night can be divided into shifts.  Essential materials and equipment include: (1) a small telescope; (2) a tripod with pan-tilt or turret head and a mounting cradle; (3) data sheets similar to the one illustrated in Figure 12. Bausch and Lomb or Argus spotting scopes (19.5 ×) and astronomical telescopes up to 30- or 40-power are ideal. Instruments of higher magnification are subject to vibration, unless very firmly mounted, and lead to difficulties in following the progress of the moon, unless powered by clockwork. Cradles usually have to be devised. An adjustable lawn chair is an important factor in comfort in latitudes where the moon reaches a point high overhead.      [Illustration: FIG. 12.

Information on the weather should include temperature, description of cloud cover, if any, and the direction and apparent speed of surface winds. Care should be taken to specify whether the telescope used has an erect or inverted image. The entry under \"Remarks\" in the heading should describe the location of the observation station with respect to watercourses, habitations, and prominent terrain features.  The starting time is noted at the top of the \"Time\" column, and the observer begins the watch for birds. He must keep the disc of the moon under unrelenting scrutiny all the while he is at the telescope. When interruptions do occur as a result of changing positions with the recorder, re-adjustments of the telescope, or the disappearance of the moon behind clouds, the exact duration of the \"time out\" must be set down.      [Illustration: FIG. 13. The identification of coördinates.        These diagrams illustrate how the moon may be envisioned as a        clockface, constantly oriented with six o'clock nearest the        horizon and completely independent of the rotation of the        moon's topographic features.]      [Illustration: FIG. 14. The apparent pathways of the birds        seen in one hour. The observations are those recorded in the        11:00-12:00 P. M. interval on April 24-25, 1948, at        Progreso, Yucatán (see Table 1).]  Whenever a bird is seen, the exact time must be noted, together with its apparent pathway on the moon. These apparent pathways can be designated in a simple manner. The observer envisions the disc of the moon as the face of a clock, with twelve equally spaced points on the circumference marking the hours (Figure 13). He calls the bottommost point 6 o'clock and the topmost, 12. The intervals in between are numbered accordingly. As this lunar clockface moves across the sky, it remains oriented in such a way that 6 o'clock continues to be the point nearest the horizon, unless the moon reaches a position directly overhead. Then, all points along the circumference are equidistant from the horizon, and the previous definition of clock values ceases to have meaning. This situation is rarely encountered in the northern hemisphere during the seasons of migration, except in extreme southern latitudes. It is one that has never actually been dealt with in the course of this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37894"],["title","A Quantitative Study of the Nocturnal Migration of Birds (#7)"],["body","tudy. But, should the problem arise, it would probably be feasible to orient the clock during this interval with respect to the points of the compass, calling the south point 6 o'clock.  When a bird appears in front of the moon, the observer identifies its entry and departure points along the rim of the moon with respect to the nearest half hour on the imaginary clock and informs the recorder. In the case of the bird shown in Figure 13, he would simply call out, \"5 to 10:30.\" The recorder would enter \"5\" in the \"In\" column on the data sheet (see Figure 12) and 10:30 in the \"Out\" column. Other comment, offered by the observer and added in the remarks column, may concern the size of the image, its speed, distinctness, and possible identity. Any deviation of the pathway from a straight line should be described. This information has no bearing on subsequent mathematical procedure, except as it helps to eliminate objects other than birds from computation.  The first step in processing a set of data so obtained is to blue-pencil all entries that, judged by the accompanying remarks, relate to extraneous objects such as insects or bats. Next, horizontal lines are drawn across the data sheets marking the beginning and the end of each even hour of observation, as 8 P. M.-9 P. M., 9 P. M.-10 P. M., etc. The coördinates of the birds in each one-hour interval may now be plotted on separate diagrammatic clockfaces, just as they appeared on the moon. Tick marks are added to each line to indicate the number of birds occurring along the same coördinate. The slant of the tick marks distinguishes the points of departure from the points of entry. Figure 14 shows the plot for the 11 P. M.-12 P. M. observations reproduced in Table 1. The standard form, illustrated in Figure 15, includes four such diagrams.  Applying the self-evident principle that all pathways with the same slant represent the same direction, we may further consolidate the plots by shifting all coördinates to the corresponding lines passing through the center of the circle, as in Figure 15. To illustrate, the 6 to 8, 5 to 9, 3 to 11, and 2 to 12 pathways all combine on the 4 to 10 line. Experienced computers eliminate a step by directly plotting the pathways through center, using a transparent plastic straightedge ruled off in parallel lines.      [Illustration: FIG. 15. Standard form for plotting the        apparent paths of flight. On these diagrams the original        coördinates, exemplified by Figure 14, have been moved to        center. In practice the sector boundaries are drawn over the        circles in red pencil, as shown by the white lines in Figure        19, making it possible to count the number of birds falling        within each zone. These numbers are then tallied in the        columns at the lower right of each hourly diagram.]       TABLE 1.--Continuation of Data in Figure 12, Showing Time                 and Readings of

Closed station   ------------------------------+------------------------------  We now have a concise picture of the apparent pathways of all the birds recorded in each hour of observation. But the coördinates do not have the same meaning as readings of a horizontal clock on the earth's surface, placed in relation to the points of the compass. They are merely projections of the birds' courses. An equation is available for reversing the effect of projection and discovering the true directions of flight. This formula, requiring thirty-five separate computations for the pathways reproduced in Figure 12 alone, is far too-consuming for the handling of large quantities of data. A simpler procedure is to divide the compass into sectors and, with the aid of a reverse equation, to draw in the projected boundaries of these divisions on the circular diagrams of the moon. A standardized set of sectors, each 22-1/2° wide and bounded by points of the compass, has been evolved for this purpose. They are identified as shown in Figure 16. The zones north of the east-west line are known as the North, or N, Sectors, as N_{1}, N_{2}, N_{3}, etc. Each zone south of the east-west line bears the same number as the sector opposite, but is distinguished by the designation S.
