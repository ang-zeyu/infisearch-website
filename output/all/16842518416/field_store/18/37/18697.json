One might think that four or five thousand years would exhaust the olfactory qualities of anything; but experience teaches us that these smells remain, and that their secrets are unknown to us. Today they are as much mysteries as they were when the embalmers put the body in the bath of natron....   All at once I sat up.  I had become lost in an absorbing reverie.  The Egyptian smell had seemed to get on my nerves—on my memory—on my very will.  At that moment I had a thought which was like an inspiration.  If I was influenced in such a manner by the smell, might it not be that the sick man, who lived half his life or more in the atmosphere, had gradually and by slow but sure process taken into his system something which had permeated him to such degree that it had a new power derived from quantity—or strength—or....  I was becoming lost again in a reverie.  This would not do.  I must take such precaution that I could remain awake, or free from such entrancing thought.  I had had but half a night’s sleep last night; and this night I must remain awake.  Without stating my intention, for I feared that I might add to the trouble and uneasiness of Miss Trelawny, I went downstairs and out of the house.  I soon found a chemist’s shop, and came away with a respirator.  When I got back, it was ten o’clock; the Doctor was going for the night.  The Nurse came with him to the door of the sick-room, taking her last instructions.  Miss Trelawny sat still beside the bed.  Sergeant Daw, who had entered as the Doctor went out, was some little distance off.  When Nurse Kennedy joined us, we arranged that she should sit up till two o’clock, when Miss Trelawny would relieve her.  Thus, in accordance with Mr. Trelawny’s instructions, there would always be a man and a woman in the room; and each one of us would overlap, so that at no time would a new set of watchers come on duty without some one to tell of what—if anything—had occurred.  I lay down on a sofa in my own room, having arranged that one of the servants should call me a little before twelve.  In a few moments I was asleep.  When I was waked, it took me several seconds to get back my thoughts so as to recognise my own identity and surroundings.  The short sleep had, however, done me good, and I could look on things around me in a more practical light than I had been able to do earlier in the evening.  I bathed my face, and thus refreshed went into the sick-room.  I moved very softly.  The Nurse was sitting by the bed, quiet and alert; the Detective sat in an arm-chair across the room in deep shadow.  He did not move when I crossed, until I got close to him, when he said in a dull whisper:  “It is all right; I have not been asleep!”  An unnecessary thing to say, I thought—it always is, unless it be untrue in spirit.  When I told him that his watch was over; that he might go to bed till I should call him at six o’clock, he seemed relieved and went with alacrity.  At the door he turned and, coming back to me, said in a whisper:  “I sleep lightly and I shall have my pistols with me.  I won’t feel so heavy-headed when I get out of this mummy smell.”  He too, then, had shared my experience of drowsiness!  I asked the Nurse if she wanted anything.  I noticed that she had a vinaigrette in her lap.  Doubtless she, too, had felt some of the influence which had so affected me. She said that she had all she required, but that if she should want anything she would at once let me know.  I wished to keep her from noticing my respirator, so I went to the chair in the shadow where her back was toward me.  Here I quietly put it on, and made myself comfortable.  For what seemed a long time, I sat and thought and thought.  It was a wild medley of thoughts, as might have been expected from the experiences of the previous day and night.  Again I found myself thinking of the Egyptian smell; and I remember that I felt a delicious satisfaction that I did not experience it as I had done.  The respirator was doing its work.  It must have been that the passing of this disturbing thought made for repose of mind, which is the corollary of bodily rest, for, though I really cannot remember being asleep or waking from it, I saw a vision—I dreamed a dream, I scarcely know which.  I was still in the room, seated in the chair.  I had on my respirator and knew that I breathed freely.  The Nurse sat in her chair with her back toward me.  She sat quite still.  The sick man lay as still as the dead.  It was rather like the picture of a scene than the reality; all were still and silent; and the stillness and silence were continuous. Outside, in the distance I could hear the sounds of a city, the occasional roll of wheels, the shout of a reveller, the far-away echo of whistles and the rumbling of trains.  The light was very, very low; the reflection of it under the green-shaded lamp was a dim relief to the darkness, rather than light.  The green silk fringe of the lamp had merely the colour of an emerald seen in the moonlight. The room, for all its darkness, was full of shadows.  It seemed in my whirling thoughts as though all the real things had become shadows—shadows which moved, for they passed the dim outline of the high windows. Shadows which had sentience. I even thought there was sound, a faint sound as of the mew of a cat—the rustle of drapery and a metallic clink as of metal faintly touching metal.  I sat as one entranced.  At last I felt, as in nightmare, that this was sleep, and that in the passing of its portals all my will had gone.  All at once my senses were full awake.  A shriek rang in my ears.  The room was filled suddenly with a blaze of light.  There was the sound of pistol shots—one, two; and a haze of white smoke in the room.  When my waking eyes regained their power, I could have shrieked with horror myself at what I saw before me.     Chapter IV  The Second Attempt   The sight which met my eyes had the horror of a dream within a dream, with the certainty of reality added.  The room was as I had seen it last; except that the shadowy look had gone in the glare of the many lights, and every article in it stood stark and solidly real.  By the empty bed sat Nurse Kennedy, as my eyes had last seen her, sitting bolt upright in the arm-chair beside the bed.  She had placed a pillow behind her, so that her back might be erect; but her neck was fixed as that of one in a cataleptic trance.  She was, to all intents and purposes, turned into stone.  There was no special expression on her face—no fear, no horror; nothing such as might be expected of one in such a condition.  Her open eyes showed neither wonder nor interest. She was simply a negative existence, warm, breathing, placid; but absolutely unconscious of the world around her.  The bedclothes were disarranged, as though the patient had been drawn from under them without throwing them back.  The corner of the upper sheet hung upon the floor; close by it lay one of the bandages with which the Doctor had dressed the wounded wrist. Another and another lay further along the floor, as though forming a clue to where the sick man now lay. This was almost exactly where he had been found on the previous night, under the great safe.  Again, the left arm lay toward the safe.  But there had been a new outrage, an attempt had been made to sever the arm close to the bangle which held the tiny key.  A heavy “kukri” knife—one of the leaf-shaped knives which the Gurkhas and others of the hill tribes of India use with such effect—had been taken from its place on the wall, and with it the attempt had been made. It was manifest that just at the moment of striking, the blow had been arrested, for only the point of the knife and not the edge of the blade had struck the flesh.  As it was, the outer side of the arm had been cut to the bone and the blood was pouring out.  In addition, the former wound in front of the arm had been cut or torn about terribly, one of the cuts seemed to jet out blood as if with each pulsation of the heart.  By the side of her father knelt Miss Trelawny, her white nightdress stained with the blood in which she knelt.  In the middle of the room Sergeant Daw, in his shirt and trousers and stocking feet, was putting fresh cartridges into his revolver in a dazed mechanical kind of way.  His eyes were red and heavy, and he seemed only half awake, and less than half conscious of what was going on around him.  Several servants, bearing lights of various kinds, were clustered round the doorway.  As I rose from my chair and came forward, Miss Trelawny raised her eyes toward me. When she saw me she shrieked and started to her feet, pointing towards me.  Never shall I forget the strange picture she made, with her white drapery all smeared with blood which, as she rose from the pool, ran in streaks toward her bare feet.  I believe that I had only been asleep; that whatever influence had worked on Mr. Trelawny and Nurse Kennedy—and in less degree on Sergeant Daw—had not touched me. The respirator had been of some service, though it had not kept off the tragedy whose dire evidences were before me.  I can understand now—I could understand even then—the fright, added to that which had gone before, which my appearance must have evoked.  I had still on the respirator, which covered mouth and nose; my hair had been tossed in my sleep.  Coming suddenly forward, thus enwrapped and dishevelled, in that horrified crowd, I must have had, in the strange mixture of lights, an extraordinary and terrifying appearance.  It was well that I recognised all this in time to avert another catastrophe; for the half-dazed, mechanically-acting Detective put in the cartridges and had raised his revolver to shoot at me when I succeeded in wrenching off the respirator and shouting to him to hold his hand.  In this also he acted mechanically; the red, half-awake eyes had not in them even then the intention of conscious"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3781"],["title","The Jewel of Seven Stars (#7)"],["body","tion.  The danger, however, was averted.  The relief of the situation, strangely enough, came in a simple fashion. Mrs. Grant, seeing that her young mistress had on only her nightdress, had gone to fetch a dressing-gown, which she now threw over her.  This simple act brought us all back to the region of fact. With a long breath, one and all seemed to devote themselves to the most pressing matter before us, that of staunching the flow of blood from the arm of the wounded man.  Even as the thought of action came, I rejoiced; for the bleeding was very proof that Mr. Trelawny still lived.  Last night’s lesson was not thrown away.  More than one of those present knew now what to do in such an emergency, and within a few seconds willing hands were at work on a tourniquet.  A man was at once despatched for the doctor, and several of the servants disappeared to make themselves respectable.  We lifted Mr. Trelawny on to the sofa where he had lain yesterday; and, having done what we could for him, turned our attention to the Nurse.  In all the turmoil she had not stirred; she sat there as before, erect and rigid, breathing softly and naturally and with a placid smile. As it was manifestly of no use to attempt anything with her till the doctor had come, we began to think of the general situation.  Mrs. Grant had by this time taken her mistress away and changed her clothes; for she was back presently in a dressing-gown and slippers, and with the traces of blood removed from her hands.  She was now much calmer, though she trembled sadly; and her face was ghastly white. When she had looked at her father’s wrist, I holding the tourniquet, she turned her eyes round the room, resting them now and again on each one of us present in turn, but seeming to find no comfort.  It was so apparent to me that she did not know where to begin or whom to trust that, to reassure her, I said:  “I am all right now; I was only asleep.”  Her voice had a gulp in it as she said in a low voice:  “Asleep!  You! and my Father in danger!  I thought you were on the watch!”  I felt the sting of justice in the reproach; but I really wanted to help her, so I answered:  “Only asleep.  It is bad enough, I know; but there is something more than an “only” round us here.  Had it not been that I took a definite precaution I might have been like the Nurse there.”  She turned her eyes swiftly on the weird figure, sitting grimly upright like a painted statue; and then her face softened.  With the action of habitual courtesy she said:  “Forgive me!  I did not mean to be rude.  But I am in such distress and fear that I hardly know what I am saying.  Oh, it is dreadful!  I fear for fresh trouble and horror and mystery every moment.”  This cut me to the very heart, and out of the heart’s fulness I spoke:  “Don’t give me a thought!  I don’t deserve it.  I was on guard, and yet I slept.  All that I can say is that I didn’t mean to, and I tried to avoid it; but it was over me before I knew it.  Anyhow, it is done now; and can’t be undone.  Probably some day we may understand it all; but now let us try to get at some idea of what has happened.  Tell me what you remember!”  The effort to recollect seemed to stimulate her; she became calmer as she spoke:  “I was asleep, and woke suddenly with the same horrible feeling on me that Father was in great and immediate danger.  I jumped up and ran, just as I was, into his room.  It was nearly pitch dark, but as I opened the door there was light enough to see Father’s nightdress as he lay on the floor under the safe, just as on that first awful night. Then I think I must have gone mad for a moment.”  She stopped and shuddered. My eyes lit on Sergeant Daw, still fiddling in an aimless way with the revolver.  Mindful of my work with the tourniquet, I said calmly:  “Now tell us, Sergeant Daw, what did you fire at?”  The policeman seemed to pull himself together with the habit of obedience.  Looking around at the servants remaining in the room, he said with that air of importance which, I take it, is the regulation attitude of an official of the law before strangers:  “Don’t you think, sir, that we can allow the servants to go away?  We can then better go into the matter.”  I nodded approval; the servants took the hint and withdrew, though unwillingly, the last one closing the door behind him.  Then the Detective went on:  “I think I had better tell you my impressions, sir, rather than recount my actions. That is, so far as I remember them.”  There was a mortified deference now in his manner, which probably arose from his consciousness of the awkward position in which he found himself.  “I went to sleep half-dressed—as I am now, with a revolver under my pillow.  It was the last thing I remember thinking of.  I do not know how long I slept.  I had turned off the electric light, and it was quite dark.  I thought I heard a scream; but I can’t be sure, for I felt thick-headed as a man does when he is called too soon after an extra long stretch of work. Not that such was the case this time. Anyhow my thoughts flew to the pistol.  I took it out, and ran on to the landing.  Then I heard a sort of scream, or rather a call for help, and ran into this room.  The room was dark, for the lamp beside the Nurse was out, and the only light was that from the landing, coming through the open door.  Miss Trelawny was kneeling on the floor beside her father, and was screaming.  I thought I saw something move between me and the window; so, without thinking, and being half dazed and only half awake, I shot at it.  It moved a little more to the right between the windows, and I shot again.  Then you came up out of the big chair with all that muffling on your face.  It seemed to me, being as I say half dazed and half awake—I know, sir, you will take this into account—as if it had been you, being in the same direction as the thing I had fired at.  And so I was about to fire again when you pulled off the wrap.”  Here I asked him—I was cross-examining now and felt at home:  “You say you thought I was the thing you fired at.  What thing?”  The man scratched his head, but made no reply.  “Come, sir,” I said, “what thing; what was it like?”  The answer came in a low voice:  “I don’t know, sir.  I thought there was something; but what it was, or what it was like, I haven’t the faintest notion.  I suppose it was because I had been thinking of the pistol before I went to sleep, and because when I came in here I was half dazed and only half awake—which I hope you will in future, sir, always remember.”  He clung to that formula of excuse as though it were his sheet-anchor.  I did not want to antagonise the man; on the contrary I wanted to have him with us. Besides, I had on me at that time myself the shadow of my own default; so I said as kindly as I knew how:  “Quite right! Sergeant.  Your impulse was correct; though of course in the half-somnolent condition in which you were, and perhaps partly affected by the same influence—whatever it may be—which made me sleep and which has put the Nurse in that cataleptic trance, it could not be expected that you would pause to weigh matters.  But now, whilst the matter is fresh, let me see exactly where you stood and where I sat. We shall be able to trace the course of your bullets.”  The prospect of action and the exercise of his habitual skill seemed to brace him at once; he seemed a different man as he set about his work.  I asked Mrs. Grant to hold the tourniquet, and went and stood where he had stood and looked where, in the darkness, he had pointed.  I could not but notice the mechanical exactness of his mind, as when he showed me where he had stood, or drew, as a matter of course, the revolver from his pistol pocket, and pointed with it.  The chair from which I had risen still stood in its place.  Then I asked him to point with his hand only, as I wished to move in the track of his shot.  Just behind my chair, and a little back of it, stood a high buhl cabinet.  The glass door was shattered.  I asked:  “Was this the direction of your first shot or your second?”  The answer came promptly.  “The second; the first was over there!”  He turned a little to the left, more toward the wall where the great safe stood, and pointed.  I followed the direction of his hand and came to the low table whereon rested, amongst other curios, the mummy of the cat which had raised Silvio’s ire.  I got a candle and easily found the mark of the bullet.  It had broken a little glass vase and a tazza of black basalt, exquisitely engraved with hieroglyphics, the graven lines being filled with some faint green cement and the whole thing being polished to an equal surface.  The bullet, flattened against the wall, lay on the table.  I then went to the broken cabinet.  It was evidently a receptacle for valuable curios; for in it were some great scarabs of gold, agate, green jasper, amethyst, lapis lazuli, opal, granite, and blue-green china. None of these things happily were touched.  The bullet had gone through the back of the cabinet; but no other damage, save the shattering of the glass, had been done.  I could not but notice the strange arrangement of the curios on the shelf of the cabinet.  All the scarabs, rings, amulets, &c. were arranged in an uneven oval round an exquisitely-carved golden miniature figure of a hawk-headed God crowned with a disk and plumes.  I did not wait to look further at present, for my attention was demanded by more pressing things; but I determined to make a more minute examination when I should have time.  It was evident that some of the strange Egyptian smell clung to these old curios; through the broken glass came an added whiff of spice and gum and bitumen, almost stronger than those I had already noticed as coming from others in the room.  All this had really taken but a few minutes.  I was surprised when my eye met, through the chinks between the dark window blinds and the window cases, the brighter light of the"]]]
