Fauvel. “A father not only pardons, he forgets. Do I not know the terrible temptations that beset a young man in a city like Paris? There are some inordinate desires before which the firmest principles must give way, and which so pervert our moral sense as to render us incapable of judging between right and wrong. Speak, Prosper, Speak!”  “What do you wish me to say?”  “The truth. When an honorable man yields, in an hour of weakness, to temptation, his first step toward atonement is confession. Say to me, Yes, I have been tempted, dazzled: the sight of these piles of gold turned my brain. I am young: I have passions.”  “I?” murmured Prosper. “I?”  “Poor boy,” said the banker, sadly; “do you think I am ignorant of the life you have been leading since you left my roof a year ago? Can you not understand that all your fellow-clerks are jealous of you? that they do not forgive you for earning twelve thousand francs a year? Never have you committed a piece of folly without my being immediately informed of it by an anonymous letter. I could tell the exact number of nights you have spent at the gaming-table, and the amount of money you have squandered. Oh, envy has good eyes and a quick ear! I have great contempt for these cowardly denunciations, but was forced not only to heed them, but to make inquiries myself. It is only right that I should know what sort of a life is led by the man to whom I intrust my fortune and my honor.”  Prosper seemed about to protest against this last speech.  “Yes, my honor,” insisted M. Fauvel, in a voice that a sense of humiliation rendered still more vibrating: “yes, my credit might have been compromised to-day by this M. de Clameran. Do you know how much I shall lose by paying him this money? And suppose I had not had the securities which I have sacrificed? you did not know I possessed them.”  The banker paused, as if hoping for a confession, which, however, did not come.  “Come, Prosper, have courage, be frank. I will go upstairs. You will look again in the safe: I am sure that in your agitation you did not search thoroughly. This evening I will return; and I am confident that, during the day, you will have found, if not the three hundred and fifty thousand francs, at least the greater portion of it; and to-morrow neither you nor I will remember anything about this false alarm.”  M. Fauvel had risen, and was about to leave the room, when Prosper arose, and seized him by the arm.  “Your generosity is useless, monsieur,” he said, bitterly; “having taken nothing, I can restore nothing. I have searched carefully; the bank-notes have been stolen.”  “But by whom, poor fool? By whom?”  “By all that is sacred, I swear that it was not by me.”  The banker’s face turned crimson. “Miserable wretch!” cried he, “do you mean to say that I took the money?”  Prosper bowed his head, and did not answer.  “Ah! it is thus, then,” said M. Fauvel, unable to contain himself any longer. “And you dare--. Then, between you and me, M. Prosper Bertomy, justice shall decide. God is my witness that I have done all I could to save you. You will have yourself to thank for what follows. I have sent for the commissary of police: he must be waiting in my study. Shall I call him down?”  Prosper, with the fearful resignation of a man who abandons himself, replied, in a stifled voice:  “Do as you will.”  The banker was near the door, which he opened, and, after giving the cashier a last searching look, said to an office-boy:  “Anselme, ask the commissary of police to step down.”     III  If there is one man in the world whom no event can move or surprise, who is always on his guard against deceptive appearances, and is capable of admitting everything and explaining everything, it certainly is a Parisian commissary of police.  While the judge, from his lofty place, applies the code to the facts submitted to him, the commissary of police observes and watches all the odious circumstances that the law cannot reach. He is perforce the confidant of disgraceful details, domestic crimes, and tolerated vices.  If, when he entered upon his office, he had any illusions, before the end of a year they were all dissipated.  If he does not absolutely despise the human race, it is because often, side by side with abominations indulged in with impunity, he discovers sublime generosities which remain unrewarded.  He sees impudent scoundrels filching public respect; and he consoles himself by thinking of the modest, obscure heroes whom he has also encountered.  So often have his previsions been deceived, that he has reached a state of complete scepticism. He believes in nothing, neither in evil nor in absolute good; not more in virtue than in vice.  His experience has forced him to come to the sad conclusion that not men, but events, are worth considering.  The commissary sent for by M. Fauvel soon made his appearance.  It was with a calm air, if not one of perfect indifference, that he entered the office.  He was followed by a short man dressed in a full suit of black, which was slightly relieved by a crumpled collar.  The banker, scarcely bowing to him, said:  “Doubtless, monsieur, you have been apprised of the painful circumstance which compels me to have recourse to your assistance?”  “It is about a robbery, I believe.”  “Yes; an infamous and mysterious robbery committed in this office, from the safe you see open there, of which my cashier” (he pointed to Prosper) “alone possesses the key and the word.”  This declaration seemed to arouse the unfortunate cashier from his dull stupor.  “Excuse me, monsieur,” he said to the commissary in a low tone. “My chief also has the word and the key.”  “Of course, that is understood.”  The commissary at once drew his own conclusions.  Evidently these two men accused each other.  From their own statements, one or the other was guilty.  One was the head of an important bank: the other was a simple cashier.  One was the chief: the other was the clerk.  But the commissary of police was too well skilled in concealing his impressions to betray his thoughts by any outward sign. Not a muscle of his face moved.  But he became more grave, and alternately watched the cashier and M. Fauvel, as if trying to draw some profitable conclusion from their behavior.  Prosper was very pale and dejected. He had dropped into a seat, and his arms hung inert on either side of the chair.  The banker, on the contrary, remained standing with flashing eyes and crimson face, expressing himself with extraordinary violence.  “And the importance of the theft is immense,” continued M. Fauvel; “they have taken a fortune, three hundred and fifty thousand francs. This robbery might have had the most disastrous consequences. In times like these, the want of this sum might compromise the credit of the wealthiest banking-house in Paris.”  “I believe so, if notes fall due.”  “Well, monsieur, I had this very day a heavy payment to make.”  “Ah, really!”  There was no mistaking the commissary’s tone; a suspicion, the first, had evidently entered his mind.  The banker understood it; he started, and said, quickly:  “I met the demand, but at the cost of a disagreeable sacrifice. I ought to add further that, if my orders had been obeyed, the three hundred and fifty thousand francs would not have been in.”  “How is that?”  “I never desire to have large sums of money in my house over-night. My cashier had positive orders to wait always until the last moment before drawing money from the Bank of France. I above all forbade him to leave money in the safe over-night.”  “You hear this?” said the commissary to Prosper.  “Yes, monsieur,” replied the cashier, “M. Fauvel’s statement is quite correct.”  After this explanation, the suspicions of the commissary, instead of being strengthened, were dissipated.  “Well,” he said, “a robbery has been perpetrated, but by whom? Did the robber enter from without?”  The banker hesitated a moment.  “I think not,” he said at last.  “And I am certain he did not,” said Prosper.  The commissary expected and was prepared for those answers; but it did not suit his purpose to follow them up immediately.  “However,” said he, “we must make ourselves sure of it.” Turning toward his companion:  “M. Fanferlot,” he said, “go and see if you cannot discover some traces that may have escaped the attention of these gentlemen.”  M. Fanferlot, nicknamed the Squirrel, was indebted to his prodigious agility for this title, of which he was not a little proud. Slim and insignificant in appearance he might, in spite of his iron muscles, be taken for a bailiff’s under clerk, as he walked along buttoned up to the chin in his thin black overcoat. He had one of those faces that impress us disagreeably--an odiously turned-up nose, thin lips, and little, restless black eyes.  Fanferlot, who had been on the police force for five years, burned to distinguish himself, to make for himself a name. He was ambitious. Alas! he was unsuccessful, lacking opportunity--or genius.  Already, before the commissary spoke to him, he had ferreted everywhere; studied the doors, sounded the partitions, examined the wicket, and stirred up the ashes in the fireplace.  “I cannot imagine,” said he, “how a stranger could have effected an entrance here.”  He walked around the office.  “Is this door closed at night?” he inquired.  “It is always locked.”  “And who keeps the key?”  “The office-boy, to whom I always give it in charge before leaving the bank,” said Prosper.  “This boy,” said M. Fauvel, “sleeps in the outer room on a sofa-bedstead, which he unfolds at night, and folds up in the morning.”  “Is he here now?” inquired the commissary.  “Yes, monsieur,” answered the banker.  He opened the door and called:  “Anselme!”  This boy was the favorite servant of M. Fauvel, and had lived with him for ten"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3803"],["title","File No. 113 (#3)"],["body","ars. He knew that he would not be suspected; but the idea of being connected in any way with a robbery is terrible, and he entered the room trembling like a leaf.  “Did you sleep in the next room last night?” asked the commissary.  “Yes, monsieur, as usual.”  “At what hour did you go to bed?”  “About half-past ten; I had spent the evening at a cafe near by, with monsieur’s valet.”  “Did you hear no noise during the night?”  “Not a sound; and still I sleep so lightly, that, if monsieur comes down to the cash-room when I am asleep, I am instantly awakened by the sound of his footsteps.”  “Monsieur Fauvel often comes to the cash-room at night, does he?”  “No, monsieur; very seldom.”  “Did he come last night?”  “No, monsieur, I am very certain he did not; for I was kept awake nearly all night by the strong coffee I had drunk with the valet.”  “That will do; you can retire,” said the commissary.  When Anselme had left the room, Fanferlot resumed his search. He opened the door of the private staircase.  “Where do these stairs lead to?” he asked.  “To my private office,” replied M. Fauvel.  “Is not that the room whither I was conducted when I first came?”  inquired the commissary.  “The same.”  “I would like to see it,” said Fanferlot, “and examine the entrances to it.”  “Nothing is more easy,” said M. Fauvel, eagerly; “follow me, gentlemen, and you come too, Prosper.”  M. Fauvel’s private office consisted of two rooms; the waiting-room, sumptuously furnished and beautifully decorated, and the study where he transacted business. The furniture in this room was composed of a large office-desk, several leather-covered chairs, and, on either side of the fireplace, a secretary and a book-shelf.  These two rooms had only three doors; one opened on the private stairway, another into the banker’s bedroom, and the third into the main vestibule. It was through this last door that the banker’s clients and visitors were admitted.  M. Fanferlot examined the study at a glance. He seemed puzzled, like a man who had flattered himself with the hope of discovering some indication, and had found nothing.  “Let us see the adjoining room,” he said.  He passed into the waiting-room, followed by the banker and the commissary of police.  Prosper remained alone in the study.  Despite the disordered state of his mind, he could not but perceive that his situation was momentarily becoming more serious.  He had demanded and accepted the contest with his chief; the struggle had commenced; and now it no longer depended upon his own will to arrest the consequences of his action.  They were about to engage in a bitter conflict, utilizing all weapons, until one of the two should succumb, the loss of honor being the cost of defeat.  In the eyes of justice, who would be the innocent man?  Alas! the unfortunate cashier saw only too clearly that the chances were terribly unequal, and was overwhelmed with the sense of his own inferiority.  Never had he thought that his chief would carry out his threats; for, in a contest of this nature, M. Fauvel would have as much to risk as his cashier, and more to lose.  He was sitting near the fireplace, absorbed in the most gloomy forebodings, when the banker’s chamber-door suddenly opened, and a beautiful girl appeared on the threshold.  She was tall and slender; a loose morning gown, confined at the waist by a simple black ribbon, betrayed to advantage the graceful elegance of her figure. Her black eyes were large and soft; her complexion had the creamy pallor of a white camellia; and her beautiful dark hair, carelessly held together by a tortoise-shell comb, fell in a profusion of soft curls upon her exquisite neck. She was Madeleine, M. Fauvel’s niece, of whom he had spoken not long before.  Seeing Prosper in the study, where probably she expected to find her uncle alone, she could not refrain from an exclamation of surprise.  “Ah!”  Prosper started up as if he had received an electric shock. His eyes, a moment before so dull and heavy, now sparkled with joy as if he had caught a glimpse of a messenger of hope.  “Madeleine,” he gasped, “Madeleine!”  The young girl was blushing crimson. She seemed about to hastily retreat, and stepped back; but, Prosper having advanced toward her, she was overcome by a sentiment stronger than her will, and extended her hand, which he seized and pressed with much agitation.  They stood thus face to face, but with averted looks, as if they dared not let their eyes meet for fear of betraying their feelings; having much to say, and not knowing how to begin, they stood silent.  Finally Madeleine murmured, in a scarcely audible voice:  “You, Prosper--you!”  These words broke the spell. The cashier dropped the white hand which he held, and answered bitterly:  “Yes, this is Prosper, the companion of your childhood, suspected, accused of the most disgraceful theft; Prosper, whom your uncle has just delivered up to justice, and who, before the day is over, will be arrested, and thrown into prison.”  Madeleine, with a terrified gesture, cried in a tone of anguish:  “Good heavens! Prosper, what are you saying?”  “What, mademoiselle! do you not know what has happened? Have not your aunt and cousins told you?”  “They have told me nothing. I have scarcely seen my cousins this morning; and my aunt is so ill that I felt uneasy, and came to tell uncle. But for Heaven’s sake speak: tell me the cause of your distress.”  Prosper hesitated. Perhaps it occurred to him to open his heart to Madeleine, of revealing to her his most secret thoughts. A remembrance of the past chilled his confidence. He sadly shook his head, and replied:  “Thanks, mademoiselle, for this proof of interest, the last, doubtless, that I shall ever receive from you; but allow me, by being silent, to spare you distress, and myself the mortification of blushing before you.”  Madeleine interrupted him imperiously:  “I insist upon knowing.”  “Alas, mademoiselle!” answered Prosper, “you will only too soon learn my misfortune and disgrace; then, yes, then you will applaud yourself for what you have done.”  She became more urgent; instead of commanding, she entreated; but Prosper was inflexible.  “Your uncle is in the adjoining room, mademoiselle, with the commissary of police and a detective. They will soon return. I entreat you to retire that they may not find you here.”  As he spoke he gently pushed her through the door, and closed it upon her.  It was time, for the next moment the commissary and Monsieur Fauvel entered. They had visited the main entrance and waiting-room, and had heard nothing of what had passed in the study.  But Fanferlot had heard for them.  This excellent bloodhound had not lost sight of the cashier. He said to himself, “Now that my young gentleman believes himself to be alone, his face will betray him. I shall detect a smile or a wink that will enlighten me.”  Leaving M. Fauvel and the commissary to pursue their investigations, he posted himself to watch. He saw the door open, and Madeleine appear upon the threshold; he lost not a single word or gesture of the rapid scene which had passed.  It mattered little that every word of this scene was an enigma. M. Fanferlot was skilful enough to complete the sentences he did not understand.  As yet he only had a suspicion; but a mere suspicion is better than nothing; it is a point to start from. So prompt was he in building a plan upon the slightest incident that he thought he saw in the past of these people, who were utter strangers to him, glimpses of a domestic drama.  If the commissary of police is a sceptic, the detective has faith; he believes in evil.  “I understand the case now,” said he to himself. “This man loves the young lady, who is really very pretty; and, as he is quite handsome, I suppose his love is reciprocated. This love-affair vexes the banker, who, not knowing how to get rid of the importunate lover by fair means, has to resort to foul, and plans this imaginary robbery, which is very ingenious.”  Thus to M. Fanferlot’s mind, the banker had simply robbed himself, and the innocent cashier was the victim of an odious machination.  But this conviction was, at present, of little service to Prosper.  Fanferlot, the ambitious, who had determined to obtain renown in his profession, decided to keep his conjectures to himself.  “I will let the others go their way, and I’ll go mine,” he said. “When, by dint of close watching and patient investigation I shall have collected proof sufficient to insure certain conviction, I will unmask the scoundrel.”  He was radiant. He had at last found the crime, so long looked for, which would make him celebrated. Nothing was wanting, neither the odious circumstances, nor the mystery, nor even the romantic and sentimental element represented by Prosper and Madeleine.  Success seemed difficult, almost impossible; but Fanferlot, the Squirrel, had great confidence in his own genius for investigation.  Meanwhile, the search upstairs completed, M. Fauvel and the commissary returned to the room where Prosper was waiting for them.  The commissary, who had seemed so calm when he first came, now looked grave and perplexed. The moment for taking a decisive part had come, yet it was evident that he hesitated.  “You see, gentlemen,” he began, “our search has only confirmed our first suspicion.”  M. Fauvel and Prosper bowed assentingly.  “And what do you think, M. Fanferlot?” continued the commissary.  Fanferlot did not answer.  Occupied in studying the safe-lock, he manifested signs of a lively surprise. Evidently he had just made an important discovery.  M. Fauvel, Prosper, and the commissary rose, and surrounded him.  “Have you discovered any trace?” said the banker, eagerly.  Fanferlot turned around with a vexed air. He reproached himself for not having concealed his impressions.  “Oh!” said he, carelessly, “I have discovered nothing of importance.”  “But we should like to know,” said Prosper.  “I have merely convinced myself that"]]]
