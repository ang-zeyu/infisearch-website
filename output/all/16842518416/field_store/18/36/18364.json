Dad erected a shelter over him, made of boughs, to keep the sun off.  Two or three times a day he cut greenstuff for him--which the cows ate.  He humped water to him which he sullenly refused to drink; and did all in his power to persuade Farmer to get up and go on with the ploughing.  I don't know if Dad knew anything of mesmerism, but he used to stand for long intervals dumbly staring the old horse full in the eyes till in a commanding voice he would bid him, \"Get up!\" But Farmer lacked the patriotism of the back-block poets.  He was obdurate, and not once did he \"awake,\" not to mention \"arise\".  This afternoon, as Dad approached his dumb patient, he suddenly put down the bucket of water which he was carrying and ran, shouting angrily.  A flock of crows flew away from Farmer and \"cawed\" from a tree close by. Dad was excited, and when he saw that one of the animal's eyes was gone and a stream of blood trickled over its nose he sat down and hid his face in his big rough hands.  \"CAW, CAW!\" came from the tree.  Dad rose and looked up.  \"CURSE you!\" he hissed--\"you black wretches of hell!\"  \"CAW, CAW, CAW\"  He ran towards the tree as though he would hurl it to the ground, and away flew the crows.  Joe arrived.  \"W-w-wuz they at him, Dad?\"  Dad turned on him, trembling with rage.  \"Oh, YOU son of the Devil!\" he commenced.  \"YOU worthless pup, you! Look there!  Do you see that?\" (He pointed to the horse.) \"Did n't I tell you to mind him? Did n'--\"  \"Yes,\" snivelled Joe; \"but Anderson's dog had a k-k-k-angaroo bailed up.\"  \"DAMN you, be off out of this!\" And Dad aimed a block of wood at Joe which struck him on the back as he made away.  But nothing short of two broken legs would stop Joe, who the next instant had dashed among the corn like an emu into a scrub.  Dad returned to the house, foaming and vowing to take the gun and shoot Joe down like a wallaby.  But when he saw two horses hanging up he hesitated and would have gone away again had Mother not called out that he was wanted.  He went in reluctantly.  Red Donovan and his son, Mick, were there.  Donovan was the publican, butcher, and horse-dealer at the Overhaul.  He was reputed to be well-in, though some said that if everybody had their own he would n't be worth much.  He was a glib-tongued Irishman who knew everything--or fondly imagined he did--from the law to horse-surgery.  There was money to be made out of selections, he reckoned, if selectors only knew how to make it--the majority, he proclaimed, did n't know enough to get under a tree when it rained.  As a dealer, he was a hard nut, never giving more than a \"tenner\" for a twenty pound beast, or selling a ten pound one for less than twenty pounds.  And few knew Donovan better than did Dad, or had been taken in by him oftener; but on this occasion Dad was in no easy or benevolent frame of mind.  He sat down, and they talked of crops and the weather, and beat about the bush until Donovan said:  \"Have you any fat steers to sell?\"  Dad had n't.  \"But,\" he added, \"I can sell you a horse.\"  \"Which one?\" asked Donovan, for he knew the horses as well as Dad did--perhaps better.  \"The bay--Farmer.\"  \"How much?\"  \"Seven pounds.\" Now, Farmer was worth fourteen pounds, if worth a shilling--that is, before he took sick--and Donovan knew it well.  \"Seven,\" he repeated ponderingly.  \"Give you six.\"  Never before did Dad show himself such an expert in dissimulation.  He shook his head knowingly, and enquired of Donovan if he would take the horse for nothing.  \"Split the difference, then--make it six-ten?\"  Dad rose and looked out the window.  \"There he is now,\" he remarked sadly, \"in the gully there.\"  \"Well, what's it to be--six-ten or nothing?\" renewed Donovan.  \"All right, then,\" Dad replied, demurely, \"take him!\"  The money was paid there and then and receipts drawn up.  Then, saying that Mick would come for the horse on the day following, and after offering a little gratuitous advice on seed-wheat and pig-sticking, the Donovans left.  Mick came the next day, and Dad showed him Farmer, under the bushes. He was n't dead, because when Joe sat on him he moved.  \"There he is,\" said Dad, grinning.  Mick remained seated on his horse, bewildered-looking, staring first at Farmer, then at Dad.  \"Well?\" Dad remarked, still grinning.  Then Mick spoke feelingly.  \"YOU SWINDLING OLD CRAWLER!\" he said, and galloped away.  It was well for him he got a good start.  For long after that we turned the horses and cows into the little paddock at night, and if ever the dog barked Dad would jump up and go out in his shirt.  We put them back into the paddock again, and the first night they were there two cows got out and went away, taking with them the chain that fastened the slip-rails.  We never saw or heard of them again; but Dad treasured them in his heart.  Often, when he was thoughtful, he would ponder out plans for getting even with the Donovans--we  knew it was the Donovans.  And Fate seemed to be of Dad's mind; for the Donovans got into \"trouble,\", and were reported to be \"doing time.\" That pleased Dad; but the vengeance was a little vague.  He would have liked a finger in the pie himself.  Four years passed.  It was after supper, and we were all husking corn in the barn.  Old Anderson and young Tom Anderson and Mrs. Maloney were helping us.  We were to assist them the following week.  The barn was illuminated by fat-lamps, which made the spiders in the rafters uneasy and disturbed the slumbers of a few fowls that for months had insisted on roosting on the cross-beam.  Mrs. Maloney was arguing with Anderson.  She was claiming to have husked two cobs to his one, when the dogs started barking savagely. Dad crawled from beneath a heap of husks and went out.  The night was dark.  He bade the dogs \"Lie down.\"  They barked louder.  \"Damn you--lie down!\" he roared. They shut up.  Then a voice from the darkness said:  \"Is that you, Mr. Rudd?\"  Dad failed to recognise it, and went to the fence where the visitor was. He remained there talking for fully half-an-hour.  Then he returned, and said it was young Donovan.  \"DONOVAN!  MICK Donovan?\" exclaimed Anderson.  And Mother and Mrs. Maloney and Joe echoed \"MICK Donovan?\"  They WERE surprised.  \"He's none too welcome,\" said Anderson, thinking of his horses and cows. Mother agreed with him, while Mrs. Maloney repeated over and over again that she was always under the impression that Mick Donovan was in gaol along with his bad old father.  Dad was uncommunicative.  There was something on his mind.  He waited till the company had gone, then consulted with Dave.  They were outside, in the dark, and leant on the dray.  Dad said in a low voice:  \"He's come a hundred mile to-day, 'n' his horse is dead-beat, 'n' he wants one t' take him t' Back Creek t'morrer 'n' leave this one in his place...Wot d'y' think?\"  Dave seemed to think a great deal, for he said nothing.  \"Now,\" continued Dad, \"it's me opinion the horse is n't his; it's one he's shook--an' I've an idea.\"  Then he proceeded to instruct Dave in the idea. A while later he called Joe and drilled him in the idea.  That night, young Donovan stayed at Shingle Hut.  In the morning Dad was very affable.  He asked Donovan to come and show him his horse, as he must see it before thinking of exchanging.  They proceeded to the paddock together.  The horse was standing under a tree, tired-looking. Dad stood and looked at Donovan for fully half-a-minute without speaking.  \"Why, damn it!\" he exclaimed, at last, \"that's MY OWN horse...You don't mean...S'help me!  Old Bess's foal!\"  Donovan told him he was making a mistake.  \"Mistake be hanged!\" replied Dad, walking round the animal.  \"Not much of a mistake about HIM!\"  Just here Dave appeared, as was proper.  \"Do you know this horse?\" Dad asked him.  \"Yes, of course,\" he answered, surprisedly, with his eyes open wide, \"Bess's foal!--of course it is.\"  \"There you are!\" said Dad, grinning triumphantly.  Donovan seemed uneasy.  Joe in his turn appeared.  Dad put the same question to him.  Of course Joe knew Bess's foal--\"the one that got stole.\"  There was a silence.  \"Now,\" said Dad, looking very grave, \"what have y' got t' say?  Who'd y' get him off?  Show's y'r receipt.\"  Donovan had nothing to say; he preferred to be silent.  \"Then,\" Dad went on, \"clear out of this as fast as you can go, an' think y'rself lucky.\"  He cleared, but on foot.  Dad gazed after him, and, as he left the paddock, said:  \"One too many f' y' that time, Mick Donovan!\"  Then to Dave, who was still looking at the horse:  \"He's a stolen one right enough, but he's a beauty, and we'll keep him; and if the owner ever comes for him, well--if he is the owner--he can have him, that's all.\"  We had the horse for eighteen months and more.  One day Dad rode him to town.  He was no sooner there than a man came up and claimed him.  Dad objected.  The man went off and brought a policeman.  \"Orright\"--Dad said--\"TAKE him.\"  The policeman took him.  He took Dad too.  The lawyer got Dad off, but it cost us five bags of potatoes.  Dad did n't grudge them, for he reckoned we'd had value.  Besides, he was even with the Donovans for the two cows.     Chapter XI.  A Splendid Year For Corn.   We had just finished supper.  Supper! dry bread and sugarless tea.  Dad was tired out and was resting at one end of the sofa; Joe was stretched at the other, without a pillow, and his legs tangled up among Dad's. Bill and Tom squatted in the ashes, while Mother tried to put the fat-lamp into burning order by poking it with a table-fork.  Dad was silent; he seemed sad, and lay for some time gazing at the roof. He might have been watching the blaze of the glorious moon or counting the stars through the gaps in the shingles, but he was n't--there was no such sentiment in Dad.  He was thinking how his long years of toil and worry had been rewarded again and again by disappointment--wondering if ever there "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36791"],["title","The Mormon Puzzle, and How to Solve It (#0)"],["body","MORMON PUZZLE;   _AND HOW TO SOLVE IT._     BY REV. R. W. BEERS, A.M.,   PASTOR OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, ELKTON, MD.     \"A disposition to reserve, and an ability to improve, taken   together, would be my standard of a statesman\"--EDMUND BURKE.     FUNK & WAGNALLS, PUBLISHERS.   CHICAGO: TIMES BUILDING.   NEW YORK:1 8 & 20 ASTOR PLACE.   LONDON: 44 FLEET STREET.   1887       Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1886,   By FUNK & WAGNALLS,   In the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington, D. C.       To my Parents,   TO WHOSE SELF-SACRIFICE AND DEVOTION I OWE SO MUCH,   THIS VOLUME IS LOVINGLY   Dedicated.     PREFACE.   The following pages have at least the merit of being addressed to a subject of living interest to the American people. Perhaps with the single exception of the labor problem, the Mormon problem is the most important question before the people of our country at the present time. It is a problem which has thus far been unsolvable by the moralist, the statesman, and the politician. It still remains a PUZZLE. No feasible plan has yet been hit upon for getting rid of it.  From the past failures to solve it, it would seem that the problem has either not been studied from the proper standpoint, or has been misunderstood. Accordingly, we instituted a careful study of the problem in all its different phases, and endeavored to conduct our investigation in a fair and impartial manner. In doing so we consulted the leading authorities, both Mormon and non-Mormon, and must here acknowledge our indebtedness especially to \"New Light on Mormonism,\" by Mrs. Ellen E. Dickinson; \"Illiteracy and Mormonism,\" by Henry Randall Waite; Professor Coyner's \"Handbook on Mormonism;\" Schaff-Herzog's \"Encyclop熛ia of Religious Knowledge;\" and back files of the _Independent_, _Christian Union_, and _Deseret News_--all of which were freely used in the preparation of this volume.  It has the merit of being the product of about two years' careful thought and research. Most of the writings on Mormonism at the present day are the result of a few days' study of the subject on the field of Utah; but, apart from the insufficient time which such authors devote to the study of so knotty a problem, their minds are very apt to be warped by the people among whom their lot is cast during their short visit there, and they almost inevitably present a one-sided view of the question.  Thus, some have fallen into the hands of _the Mormons_; and they have returned from Utah delighted, and let fall from their lips naught but encomiums for the priesthood and apologies for the Mormon system. Many of our legislators have in this way been the dupes of the Mormon priesthood. On this subject the much-lamented _Mary Clemmer_ wrote the following pungent lines:  \"Legislators constantly passing to and from California find Salt Lake City a most attractive stopping-place. The Mormon hierarchy, sly, cunning, astute, to the last limit of human nature, is ever sharply on the lookout for these potent summer visitors. 'Prophets' and 'apostles' board every train of cars that enters Utah bearing an important traveller. The freedom of the city, the hospitality of the show 'happy families,' who are never taken by surprise on an off-day of misery, is lavished upon the ingenuous guest.... The facts impressed upon his senses, as well as his understanding, are those of great industry, thrift, wealth, prosperity--of shrewd men and of seemingly happy women. Indeed, their supreme occupation while with him is to prove to him that they _are_ happy, while the men are equally busy in spreading before him the vast resources of both the Church and the Territory. This man, who is one of many men whose voice and vote tells upon human affairs, leaves the Territory at last deeply in debt personally for favors received and mentally somewhat dazed by the material profitableness of a religious system that he wishes to denounce, but does not pretend to understand.\"  On the other hand, many have fallen into the hands of _bitter non-Mormons_ during their brief stay in Utah; and their minds have been filled with horrible stories of the brutalities and crimes of the Mormon people. They have returned disgusted, and have uttered harsh tirades against the whole Mormon system and all who believe in it, declaring that it should be utterly exterminated, even by the sword. Of their utterances and writings the official organ of the Mormon Church, the _Deseret News_, in its issue of July 21st, 1886, reasonably complains. It says: \"Salt Lake City is not Utah, and conversation with a little knot of anti-Mormons does not impart much accurate information on 'Mormonism.' The books that are written by tourists who come in by the cars, take a hack, a ride around town, a sniff at the lake, a glance at the Temple, and a guess at the situation, and who make up their data from other publications and the yarns of persons who take delight in filling up travellers with blood-curdling Munchausenisms, are not likely to correct the public mind on a subject about which there is more misinformation than almost any other.... And these books are not any less reliable than the remarks and tales and remedies that fall from the lips of men who spend a few weeks in a given locality in one Utah town, and then go to the world and air their great experience and knowledge about the 'Mormons' through 'a protracted residence in Utah.'\"  It was our desire to avoid both Scylla and Charybdis--to treat the subject with an unbiased mind--to get the real facts, and then propound, if possible, a solution to the problem. We have not been in actual contact either with Mormons or non-Mormons. We have not been on the field of Utah at all, and believe that the value of this volume as an impartial study is thereby greatly enhanced. Furthermore, while we have avoided the narrow views of the subject which would almost inevitably have resulted from a personal visit to Utah, we have been in communication both with leading Mormons and non-Mormons on the field, and have in that way acquired all the _reliable_ information which could have been obtained by a _long residence_ there.  The result of our long and careful study, which was prosecuted while we were engaged in regular pastoral duties, was first given to the members of our own congregation in a series of lectures on week-day evenings; and while they have since then been enlarged and carefully revised, they still have the free oratorical style which, though inexcusable in a work prepared exclusively for publication, may be pardoned in an oral lecture.  The solution of the \"_Mormon Puzzle_\" to which we have arrived is given forth with the firm conviction that it is practicable, and if carried out in its various parts would peaceably overcome all the bad qualities belonging to Mormonism, which are the sole cause of the puzzle now before the people of our country. Nevertheless, we do not anticipate for our views the indorsement of the extremists on either side; but we believe they will commend themselves to the fair-minded people of our land; at least, it is hoped that all minds open to conviction may find something in these pages worthy of their serious thought. We only ask that the reader may adopt the precept of Bacon: \"Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; but to weigh and consider.\"  THE AUTHOR.
