In       both eye-pieces the prism is so adjusted as to       accomplish total reflection of the image, thus doing       away with loss of light and with secondary reflections,       such disturbing features of those forms of drawing       apparatus of which a mirror forms an essential part.  [Illustration]    92. This =drawing eye-piece= is employed with the stand       in the vertical position. The reflected image lies at       the side of the microscope, the rays passing off at an       acute angle from the reflecting prism near the top of       the eye-piece. The eye-piece slips into the tube of the       microscope like any ordinary eye-piece and is held in       position by a thumb-screw. The drawing field is at once       visible without further adjustment, and the picture is       clear and sharp. The brightness of the drawing field may       be regulated by smoked glass plates mounted in two       moveable metal arms                                        =8.--=  [Illustration: Drawing eye-piece for drawing with inclined stand.]    93. This =drawing eye-piece= is similar in construction       to that just described, but is so arranged as to throw       the image vertically downwards behind the microscope       when the latter is inclined at an angle of 45 degrees.       In this case also the picture reflected is clear and       sharp, devoid of all disturbing secondary images. As the       image is reflected vertically downwards upon the table,       no special drawing stand is necessary as there is no       distortion of the picture. The intensity of the light       may be modified by smoked glass plates mounted in two       moveable metal arms                                       =10.--=        For a description of these drawing eye-pieces and of the       principles involved in their construction reference may       be had to the Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche       Mikroskopie, XII, 1895.  [Illustration: Abbe's Drawing Apparatus.]    94. In =Abbe's Drawing Apparatus= the drawing field is       reflected by a mirror at the side of the instrument and       by a prism which fits over the eye-piece of the       microscope. The prism is supported on a vertical hinge       so that it may be readily turned out of the axis of the       microscope without disconnecting the whole apparatus       from the stand. It is shown turned to the side in the       figure. A cylindrical cap accompanies the apparatus       which fits over the prism holder and has six lateral       windows in which are smoked glasses of various       intensity, serving to regulate the lightness of the       reflected drawing field                                   =12.--=  [Illustration: Drawing Board No. 95. Drawing Board after Giesenhagen.]        The =Drawing boards= serve two purposes. They afford a       smooth plane surface for the drawing paper and they are       so arranged that they may be inclined at such an angle       as to receive the rays of the reflected image at right       angle to their surface, thus doing away with any       distortion of the image on the paper.    95. This =drawing board= is especially adapted for use       with drawing eye-piece No. 92. When in the position       indicated in the figure its drawing surface forms an       angle of 12° to the horizontal                             =2.--=    96. In =Giesenhagen's drawing board= the drawing surface       may be adjusted at various angles and may be raised and       lowered                                                    =4.--=        For drawing eye-piece No. 93 and the Abbe drawing       apparatus the surface of the drawing board should be       horizontal.  [Illustration: Drawing apparatus after v. Tubeuf.]    97. The =drawing apparatus= after v. Tubeuf serves for       drawing objects from nature. By means of a prism mounted       in a metal box, the object is reflected into the eye in       such a manner that its image appears erected on the       drawing surface. This is quite an advantage when drawing       from nature but is unimportant when using a drawing       apparatus on the microscope. Two smoked glasses mounted       in moveable metal arms serve to moderate the intensity       of the light. On the side of the prism nearest the eye       is a small wheel diaphragm attached to regulate the size       of the opening. The apparatus is mounted on a heavy       nickel-plated stand with vertical and lateral       adjustments controlled by thumb-screws                    =12.--=       =Mechanical Stages.=  [Illustration: Mechanical stage No. 98.]    98. =Mechanical stage= adapted to Stands I, Ia and Ib.       The stage is readily attached to the microscope by means       of a small screw, _C_, which screws into a thread in the       microscope just behind its stage, and binds the       mechanical stage firmly in position and always in the       same position. It may be again removed by simply       unscrewing this set screw.        The movements of the stage are at right angles to one       another, are accomplished by carefully constructed rack       and pinion adjustments and the exact position of each       adjustment is indicated by vernier scales. The extent of       the lateral movement is 50 mm; that of the other 30 mm.        This stage permits the careful and systematic       examination of large specimens and its construction is       so perfect that by means of the vernier scales the most       minute objects may be readily replaced in the field of       vision, even after removal and readjustment of the       stage, provided only that their location when in the       field of vision as indicated by the scales had been       noted                                                     =28.--=    99. =Large mechanical stage= for stand, _A_, adapted for       slides 50×100 mm; both movements by rack and pinion       adjustments                                               =32.--=  [Illustration: Mechanical stage No. 100.]   100. =Mechanical Stage No. 100.= When a mechanical stage       is ordered subsequently to a microscope outfit and under       such circumstances that its correct adjustment to the       stand by a skillful mechanic is impossible we advise the       purchase of this more readily adjusted mechanical stage,       which may readily be attached to Stands I, Ia, Ib, IIa       and IIb by means of a thumb-screw. It is as carefully       constructed as Mechanical Stage No. 98 and serves the       same purpose in every particular                          =28.--=  100a. =New Mechanical stage=, simplified form                   =20.--=  [Illustration: Mechanical stage No. 100a.]   101. =Warm stage= after Schultze. This consists of a       metal stage to which long lateral arms are attached,       through which the heat from one or more small lamps is       conducted to the central part of the stage and the       object. The apparatus is also provided with a condenser,       which affords illumination sufficient for the use of       high power objectives, and with a thermometer indicating       the exact temperature of the centre of the stage, which       may be carried as high as 100° C.                         =12.--=  [Illustration: Schultze's Warm Stage No. 101.]   102. =Warm stage= after Pfeiffer. It consists of a glass       chamber through which warm water may be made to flow. A       small cell is ground in its surface thus permitting its       use as a moist chamber                                     =6.--=   103. =Warm stage= after Stricker. This stage consists of       a metal chamber, through which warm water is made to       flow when in use, and is provided also with a condenser       and thermometer. It may be screwed firmly to any of the       square microscope stages                                  =14.--=  [Illustration: Stricker's Warm stage No. 103.]   104. =Warm stage= after Errera, permitting rapid changes       from low to high temperature and vice-versa.        It includes 2 vessels for cold and hot water, mounted on       tripods, with rubber-tubing etc.                          =24.--=     =Photo-micrographic Apparatus.=  [Illustration: Photo-micr"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35916"],["title","A History of the Growth of the Steam-Engine (#0)"],["body","+-------------------------------------------------------------------+   |                                                                   |   |                       TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:                        |   |                                                                   |   |                                                                   |   |Formatting and coding information:                                 |   |  - Text in italics is marked with underscores as in _text_.       |   |  - Bold-face text is marked =text=.                               |   |  - Superscript x and subscript x are represented as ^{x} and _{x},|   |    respectively.                                                  |   |  - sqrt(x) represents the square root of x.                       |   |  - [oe] and [OE] represent the oe-ligatures.                      |   |  - Greek letters are written between square brackets, as in [tau] |   |    or [theta].                                                    |   |  - Overlined 1 is represented as [=1].                            |   |  - [<] represents a 'rotated [Delta]'.                            |   |                                                                   |   |General remarks:                                                   |   |  - Footnotes have been moved to directly below the paragraph they |   |    refer to.                                                      |   |  - In-line multiple line formulas have been changed to in-line    |   |    single-line formulas, with brackets added when needed.         |   |  - The Table of Contents has been corrected to conform to the text|   |    rather than to the original Table of Contents.                 |   |  - The table on operating costs of trains gives 'Other expenses   |   |    per square mile.'
