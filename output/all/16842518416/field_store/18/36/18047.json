All that is useful, great, and good; all that is calculated to sustain, comfort, instruct, edify, purify, refine, or exalt intelligences; originated by this science, and this science alone, all other sciences being but branches growing out of _this--root_.  Some of the facts stated in the foregoing, are beautifully illustrated in Theological history, of which the following is an imperfect summary--  God spake, and the worlds were framed by His word.  He spake, darkness dispersed, and light prevailed.  He commanded, and the elements--water and earth, separated, and assumed their proper bounds.  He commanded, and the earth brought forth vegetable and animal life in countless variety.  He commanded, and man, male and female, took upon them a tabernacle of flesh, and prepared to multiply and perpetuate their species in the new creation.  \"The Lord God planted a garden,\" and thus introduced agriculture.  \"He made coats of skins,\" hence the tailor's art.  The Lord God commanded and gave pattern for Noah's Ark, thus introducing the art of shipbuilding.  He revealed the patterns for the Tabernacle in the wilderness, with all its arrangements and furniture; and afterwards developed the entire plan and all the designs of that most stupendous of all works of art--the great Temple of Solomon, with all its furniture; thus developing and improving the art of architecture.  The Lord God wrote with His own finger on the \"tables of stone,\" on Mount Sinai; thus showing that the science of letters was cultivated and used by the highest Intelligence of the eternal heavens.  The Lord God has revealed by Ezekiel the Prophet, a plan for the survey and division of Palestine to the Twelve Tribes of Israel, on their return to the land of their fathers; also for laying out the new city of Jerusalem, with its squares, blocks, public grounds, and suburbs, and its temple.  Thus Theology includes the surveyor's art, and the planning of cities, as well as temples, and shows that these arts are cultivated in heaven, and that the very highest Intelligence of the Heaven of heavens, stoops, or condescends, to grace these arts by His own particular attention and example.  In the Revelation of John the Apostle, on the Isle of Patmos, we have a specimen, a masterpiece, a climax of all that is great and grand in design, and splendid and glorious in execution, in cities, thrones, palaces, streets, pavements, outgrounds, gates, walks, squares, fountains, rivulets, gardens, fruits, groves, specimens of dress, poetry, song, music, marriage, bridal dress, feasting, books, literature, public worship, prophesying, prayer, and praise, as existing in and around the palaces of the New Jerusalem, the capital of heaven, the seat of government of the Eternal King.  The very gates of the city are numbered and named, together with the particular names of the precious stones forming the foundations thereof; the gold which composed the pavement of the streets--all are portrayed in the description.  And what is still more marvellous, all this surpassing grandeur of design, and stupendous wisdom and display in execution, were explored, comprehended, and described by a poor, illiterate fisherman, by the aid of the science and arts of Theology.  Having reviewed some of the works of the great Head--the President or First Teacher in the school of Theology, we will still continue the historic illustrations of this wonderful science, as developed and exemplified by the most eminent students and professors of the same.  By this science Adam obtained from his Father, the promise of the eternal dominion over the planet on which he was placed.  By this science Enoch overcame death, and ascended to a higher sphere of immortality and eternal life, without even being separated from his fleshly tabernacle.  By this science Noah foretold the flood, prepared to meet the event, and, with his family, survived the same, and became the greatest landed proprietor since Adam.  By the perversion and unlawful use of this science king Nimrod built the stupendous Tower of Babel, but was frustrated, and his works were destroyed before their completion.  By this science various tongues and languages were instituted, and colonies--the germs of nations, planted beyond the seas and in all the earth.  By this science Abraham escaped the idolatry and priestcraft of the Egyptians, and of the world around him; obtained a good land secured to him and his seed by an immutable oath, covenant, and an everlasting, unchangeable title.  By this science he conversed with angels, and was favoured with a personal interview with the Great Head and Founder of the science, who became his guest, and, after eating and drinking with him, blessed him and his wife, promised them an heir in their old age, and finally, on parting, told him His design on Sodom and its neighbourhood.  By this science Lot escaped the flames of Sodom, the knowledge being communicated by two angels.  By this science Isaac and Jacob also obtained promises, and conversed with angels.  By it Joseph was exalted from a dungeon to a palace, for the salvation, from famine, of a nation and of his father's house.  By this science Moses performed his wonders in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness.  By the perversion and unlawful use of this science the magicians of Egypt withstood Moses for a time, and performed their enchantments.  By this science Joshua controlled the motions of the earth, and lengthened out the day by a simple command.  By this science the walls of Jericho were levelled with the earth, and the city was taken.  By this science the Jordan river was divided, while a nation crossed dry shod, to take possession of the promised land.  By this science Elijah controlled the heavens, that it rained not for three years and six months in Palestine. And by it he called forth and restored rain.  By it he overthrew the priests of Baal, and the kingdom of Ahab; put an end to the royal family of this idolatrous king; and placed Jehu on the throne.  By it he rose, like Enoch, to a higher sphere, without returning to dust.  By this science Samuel prophesied, raised up a mighty king and nation, and afterwards dethroned Saul, and exalted an obscure shepherd boy to the throne of Israel.  By this science Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and others, foretold the fate of Babylon, Egypt, Tyre, Jerusalem, and other cities and nations; and the exact career and final doom of Nebuchadnezzar, Belteshazzar, Cyrus, and other great and important personages, who were destined in turn to influence and decide the fate of nations.  By this science the furnace of fire was overcome, and the months of lions were closed, that no harm should befall the holy men of God.  By this science Zachariah, Elizabeth, John the Baptist, Simeon, Anna, Joseph, Mary, the wise men from the east, and the shepherds of Judea, enjoyed visions, communion with angels, and the spirit of prophecy, so as to understand and welcome with joy the events of the birth and approaching ministry of Jesus Christ, when, as yet, all those not versed in this science, were in darkness on the subject, and as liable to reject the Saviour as to receive him.  Dreams and visions, enjoyed by means of this science, led and protected the Son of God in all his career of mortal life.  Finally--By this same power a mighty angel descended, shook the earth, frightened the Roman guards, rolled away the great stone, broke the seal of the tomb, and called to life the sleeping body of Jesus Christ.  By this power the risen Jesus, eating, drinking, and conversing with his disciples, after his resurrection, commissioned and instructed them in the same science, ordained them to act in the same, and to impart its power to others, in all the world, with signs following them that believed.  By this science he ascended to the Father, and lives for ever in the flesh, to shed forth the gifts and powers of the same science, according to his own will, and the will of his Father, to reign henceforth until he descends to the earth, conquers death in a last great conflict, and puts all enemies under his feet.  By this same power his Apostles, being clothed with the full powers of the same on the day of Pentecost, ministered the powers and knowledge of this science to others, both Jew and Gentile, insomuch that the sick were healed, the blind saw, the dumb spake, the deaf heard, the lame walked, devils were cast out, and the dead were raised, while everywhere, dreams, visions, the ministering of angels, and the gift of prophecy were enjoyed.     CHAPTER II.  DECLINE AND LOSS OF THIS SCIENCE AMONG THE JEWS.       O horrid! awful! melancholy sight!     A nation, wont to soar 'mid realms of light,     Degraded, fallen, sunk in dark despair,     The hiss, the scorn, the bye-word everywhere;     No eye to pity, and no arm to save,     Till wearied nature finds an exile's grave.  It now becomes our painful task to trace the decline of the science of Theology and its powers among the nations, and to review the awful consequences of such decline.  We will commence with the Jewish nation.  The science of Theology, as we have just reviewed, was enjoyed, and its powers were wonderfully developed, under the several dispensations called Patriarchal, Mosaic, and Jewish.  There had, however, been a great decline, a retrogression of the powers and knowledge of the same, previous to their restoration by John the Baptist and Jesus Christ.  This was owing to the general prevalence of sectarian principles, divisions, precepts, commandments, and doctrines of men, by which the Law and the Prophets were made void, and a veil was thrown over them, or over the hearts of men, by which means they were misunderstood, or rather, not understood at all.  It therefore became the duty of Jesus Christ and his Apostles and Elders, as well as of his forerunner, to reprove those sects, denounce their doctrines and traditions,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35470"],["title","Key to the Science of Theology (#2)"],["body"," and restore that which was lost in this great science.  This restoration was at first confined strictly to the nation of the Jews. But seeing they turned from it, and judged themselves unworthy of eternal life, preferring their own powerless forms and doctrines, to the science of revelation, miracles, visions, and prophecy, which had ever illuminated the pathway of their more ancient fathers, the Apostles turned from them, by the commandment of the Lord, and translated this science, with its keys and legitimate powers, to the Gentiles.  The nation had rejected and slain the Messiah, stoned the Prophets, and imprisoned and even murdered many of the Apostles and Elders; and Jesus had already, in tears of anguish, announced their doom--  \"_O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord_.\"  Again, on another occasion, the Messiah uttered his voice, saying--\"_There shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled_.\"  Again he spake, concerning the Temple, saying--\"_There shall net be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down_.\"  All these things, foretold by the science of Theology, were fulfilled in that generation. And Jerusalem has been destroyed, trodden down by the Gentiles, and the Jews have remained in captivity among the nations until now.  Our readers will readily discern the entire loss of the science and powers of Theology among this nation; the time, circumstances, and reasons of its decline; and the time or circumstances which will restore it unto them.  They lost it when, by the hand of the Apostles, it was taken from them and given to the Gentiles.  The result was, the destruction of their city and temple, and of their national existence.  Their temple, priesthood, and offerings were no longer attended by divine power. Its outward forms were, therefore, of no possible use.  From that very time to the present--One thousand eight hundred and fifty-one of the Christian era, the voice of a Prophet has not been heard among the Jews.  Angels have not ministered unto them.  There has been no vision from the Lord.  No dream or interpretation.  No answer by Urim or Thummim.  No Prophet.  No voice.  No sound.  No reproof.  No comforting whisper.  All is silence--stillness--solemn blackness of despair.  All is as the similitude and shadow of death.  Oh the weariness, the painful suspense, the watchings, the wanderings, the anxieties, the pains and sorrows of eighteen centuries! Oh the mist of ages which has shrouded a nation as it were in the gloom of an endless night!  When--O when, will their day dawn, and the day star of their ancient science appear above the horizon, disperse the cloud, and usher in the morning of a brighter day?  _When the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled_.  When they shall welcome a messenger in the name of the Lord.     CHAPTER III.  PROGRESS, DECLINE, AND FINAL LOSS OF THE SCIENCE OF THEOLOGY AMONG THE GENTILES--FORESHADOWINGS OF ITS RESTORATION FOR THE USHERING IN OF THE MILLENNIUM.       Oh Mystic Babel, long has been thy reign!     What direful evils follow in thy train!     The veil is rent--thy mystery revealed,     Angels cry wo! and God thy doom has sealed.     The nations, from thy long and dreary night,     Are waking now to everlasting light.  Returning to the Gentile Church, we find the science of Theology, with all its miraculous powers of visions, dreams, angels, revelations, prophecy, healings, &c., everywhere enjoyed. It had abated none of its powers, in its transition from Jew to Gentile. The wild branches, being engrafted into the good old stock, immediately partook of the root and fatness of the tame olive tree, and thus was produced the natural fruit.  But Paul, the great Apostle of the Gentiles, in his writings to the Romans, cautioned them to beware lest they should fall away after the same example as the Jews had done before them.  Said he--\"_If God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee_.\"  John the Apostle also predicted the rise and universal sway of a certain mystical power, a Babel of spiritual or religious confusion, in short--\"_Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth_.\"  This power should bear rule among all nations. The kings and rulers of the earth should be drunken with the wine of her fornication. The merchants of the earth should become rich through the abundance of her delicacies.  This power should, according to the Prophet Daniel and the Apostle John, \"_wear out the Saints of the Most High_;\" \"_change times and laws_;\" \"_be drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus_;\" \"_destroy the mighty and the holy people_;\" \"_make war with the Saints, and overcome them_\" until a set time.  All these predictions, and many others, foretell the doom of the Gentile Church--its destruction from the earth, and the consequent decline and cessation of the science of Theology, and of its powers and blessings in the Gentile world.  Connected with these predictions, we have the most positive prophetic declarations of Holy Writ concerning the overthrow and entire destruction of this same mystical power, which had made war with the Saints.  Its judgments are set forth as far more terrible than those which befell Jerusalem. Plague, pestilence, sword, earthquake, and the flame of devouring fire will cause her to cease to be.  Then will usher in the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ. Then will the Saints of the Most High take the kingdom, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven.  Thus are to be revived the ancient powers and blessings, the knowledge and wisdom, of the science of Theology.  In the fulfilment of the foregoing predictions, the science of Theology declined, and passed away from among the Gentiles, just in proportion as the Church, or the Saints of the Most High, were warred against and overcome.  For years, centuries, ages, there has been no voice from heaven among the Gentiles, any more than among the Jews. They have fallen \"_after the same example of unbelief_,\" notwithstanding the caution of their great Apostle.  No Gentile Prophet has arisen and uttered his voice.  No kind angel has ministered to them.  No vision from the Lord.  No answer.  No inspired dream.  No voice.  No sound from the heavens.  No revelation has burst upon the silence of midnight darkness which has brooded over the nations.  Or, if such voice, such vision, such Prophet has occasionally burst forth with the testimony of Jesus, the spirit of prophecy, his testimony has been unheeded by the mass of the people called Christians, his voice silenced in death, or himself and his followers have been banished from society, to wander in the mountains, forests, caves, or deserts of the earth; or, on the other hand, compelled to drag out an existence in the solitude of the dungeon.  Ages, centuries have passed, and Oh! what suffering! what torture! what rivers of tears! what oceans of blood! what groanings! what strong crying and tears on the earth! what prayers in heaven!  \"How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood, on them that dwell on the earth?\"  The fire consumed.  The sword devoured.  Hell's artillery bellowed.  Devils hugely grinned.  Widows and orphans mourned.  Heaven wept.  Saints prayed.  Justice stood aghast.  Mercy, retiring, dropped a tear of blood.  Angels, starting, half-drew their glittering swords.  And the Gods, in solemn council, decreed a just vengeance.  Protest upon protest! reforms and re-reforms; revolutions, struggles, exertions of every kind, of mere human invention, have been tried, and tried in vain. The science of Theology, with all its keys and powers, once lost, could never, consistent with the ancient Prophetic testimony, be restored to either Jew or Gentile, until the full time should arrive--\"_The times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets, since the world began_.\"  The time for _a mighty angel to fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach to them who dwell on the earth; to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people_. (See John's revelation.)  The time of judgment for \"_Mystery Babylon_.\"  The times of \"_the fulness of the Gentiles_.\"  The times for the grafting in again of the Jews, and all the natural branches of Israel.  Then, and not till then, could the science, the keys, the powers of Theology, be restored to man.  No individual or combined human action could obtain or restore again these keys--this science.  A mighty angel held the keys of this science for the last days. A mighty angel was to restore the keys of the ancient Priesthood, Apostleship, power and blessings. A voice from heaven was to reveal the time, and send forth the cry--\"_Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities_.\"  All the darkness of the middle ages; all the priestcraft or kingcraft of every age, since the slaughter of the Apostles; all the oppressions, persecutions, or abuses of power; all the extravagancies and idleness on the one hand, and all the sufferings and miseries of the toiling millions for want of the comforts of life, on the other; all the ignorance, superstitions, errors, divisions and contentions which have transpired in the "]]]
