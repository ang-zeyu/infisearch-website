With as much dignity as their dishevelled appearance would permit, Denbigh and his companions allowed themselves to be taken on deck, where they had to cool their heels at the pleasure of their captors. It was a bright moonlight night.  The air was decidedly chilly for the Tropics.  A heavy dew was falling.  The lightly-clad men--for the sub-lieutenants were in pyjamas--realized that there was a grave risk of tropical fever.  The ship was once more under way.  With a true seaman's instinct Denbigh glanced aloft.  By the relative position of the moon--since no stars were visible--he was able to fix the approximate course of the vessel.  She was steering roughly sou'-sou'-east.  Far away to the nor'ard a masthead lamp was blinking--calling in Morse to know why they had been summoned.  Denbigh gave a grunt of satisfaction.  For once von Riesser's plan had gone awry.  He had feared to treacherously torpedo an unsuspecting merchantman since there were hostile eye-witnesses on board the _Pelikan_.  Presently the kapitan, clad in a greatcoat over his white uniform, appeared at the head of the bridge-ladder.  \"You there, von Langer?\" he called.  \"Yes, sir,\" replied the ober-leutnant.  \"Shall I bring the prisoners to you?\"  \"No, I'll see them in my cabin,\" replied von Riesser.  \"Tell off a couple of hands to guard the prisoners and another half-dozen to wait outside in case there is any trouble.  I'll be there in a few minutes.\"  The kapitan's quarters were situated aft on the upper deck.  They comprised a large cabin, used for meals and recreation, and a sleeping cabin opening from it.  Denbigh and his companions were marched into the outer cabin and told to take up a position facing von Riesser's empty arm-chair and separated from it by a long mahogany table.  The cabin was plainly furnished.  In addition to the arm-chair and table there were two sideboards, a large book-rack, and half a dozen cane chairs.  On the table lay a pile of Dutch charts.  Books for navigation and sailing directions in the same language occupied the shelves in company with a few American novels.  Everything German, with one exception, had been studiously eliminated, in order to baffle the curiosity of a British boarding-officer in the event of the supposed _Zwaan_ being held up.  The exception was a large oil painting of the Kaiser in the uniform of a German Admiral of the Fleet.  The portrait was framed in a massive oak frame securely fixed to the bulkhead between the two cabins.  The only other picture was a sepia-toned photograph of the Queen of Holland, in a narrow, plain gilt frame.  When it became necessary to hide the features of the All Highest War Lord from the eyes of the strafed English, who had practically contrived to drive the War Lord's battleships from the face of the five oceans, von Riesser took the risk of committing lese majesté by placing the portrait of Queen Wilhelmina over that of the Emperor Wilhelm II.  Then, to all appearances, the captain's cabin of the _Zwaan_ was loyally adorned by a photograph of the Queen of the Netherlands in a deep oak frame with a thin gold slip.  In the circumstances, however, it was not considered necessary to eclipse the All Highest War Lord, so the three British subs found themselves confronted by the painted features of the modern Attila.  The door was thrown open.  Von Langer and the two seamen clicked their heels and saluted as von Riesser entered with the dramatic effect of which Prussians are so fond.  Gravely saluting the Emperor's portrait and then returning his subordinates' mark of respect the kapitan took his seat.  \"You know why you are here?\" asked von Riesser abruptly, lowering his brows and looking sternly at the three British officers.  \"We do not,\" replied Denbigh.  \"In fact, it is rather unusual to turn a fellow out of his bunk at one in the morning.\"  \"Do not bandy words, Herr Denbigh,\" snapped the kapitan.  \"You have been causing trouble.\"  \"Is it causing trouble to take steps to avoid being gassed or chloroformed?\" asked O'Hara.  \"Yes,\" almost shouted the kapitan.  \"If we think it desirable that our prisoners should be put to sleep it is not for them to resist.\"  \"In that case there's no more to be said,\" declared the Irishman.  \"You are top-dog----\"  \"You call me a dog, you English swine!\" almost howled the now infuriated Prussian.  O'Hara burst out into violent laughter.  Denbigh smiled broadly, while around Stirling's firm lips hovered the suspicion of a grim smile. Their utter indifference to the ravings of their captor took von Riesser by surprise.  \"I may as well tell you,\" began Denbigh, seizing his opportunity, \"that I can speak German perhaps as well as you can speak English.  I overheard your conversation outside our cabin an hour or so ago, and we know what you proposed to do to the ship which you were luring.  I suppose you call those tactics frightfulness.  I call them low-down, skulking treachery.  How a man who professes to be a sailor, who has lived a free and healthy life upon the sea, could belittle himself to act as you propose to do, and possibly have done, passes my understanding.  I give you fair warning, Kapitan von Riesser, that, should we be set free by an English cruiser, you will have a grave indictment to answer.\"  Von Riesser did not reply for a few moments.  He was greatly agitated. Once or twice he glanced anxiously at his ober-leutnant, as if curious to know whether von Langer understood Denbigh's words.  Then he, too, laughed, but it was not a natural outburst of an unburdened and evenly-balanced mind.  \"You threaten?\" he asked.  \"Well, I can threaten also.  Suppose I decide to put into operation the principle of your worthy Prime Minister?  One of his maxims, oft quoted in the Press, is, I believe, 'Wait and see'?\"  \"It ought to be particularly applicable in your case,\" rejoined Denbigh coolly.  \"Ach!  And in yours.  What is to prevent me from ordering a weight to be put about your neck and cast you into the sea?  Weight and sea. Himmel, that is great!\"  He roared at his own joke, while von Langer, although unable to comprehend the significance, showed his servile approbation by laughing in a minor key.  \"I don't think that it would make very much difference if you did,\" replied Denbigh.  \"You see, the _Nichi Maru's_ people know that you carried us off.  Some day you will have to answer some rather searching questions if you could not produce us.\"  Again von Riesser pondered.  He was beginning to feel horribly annoyed with himself for having ever received the three British officers on board the _Pelikan_.  He was plunging deeper and deeper into the mire. He lacked the determination to cut the Gordian Knot.  By way of an excuse he scribbled a note and tossed it to von Langer.  \"Take that to the officer of the watch,\" he said carelessly.  The ober-leutnant quitted the cabin.  The two impassive seamen remained.  They, fortunately, knew no English, save a few catch phrases picked up when lying in dock in that dim period before the War.  \"Suppose we cry quits,\" resumed von Riesser.  \"I am ready to apologize for having exceeded my rights in dealing with you.  After all there's no great harm done.  I'll admit I planned to trap yonder vessel.  You must have misunderstood me when I said that I had intended to torpedo her.  We use our torpedoes only in cases of extreme necessity.  Are you willing to forget this night?\"  \"We would like to talk the matter over between ourselves,\" replied Denbigh.  \"If you have no objection, we will give our reply at noon to-morrow.\"  \"I agree,\" said von Riesser, with a meekness that quite surprised Denbigh and his companions.  He gave an order to the two seamen.  They turned and left the cabin.  Two minutes later the British officers were back in their own quarters. Time had been called after the first round, and the Prussian had not come out top-dog.     CHAPTER V  The Pursuit of the _Pelikan_  \"One thing that puzzles me,\" remarked Stirling during the following forenoon, \"is why they didn't clap us below under hatches, instead of trying to stupefy us.  It would have been far less trouble.\"  \"I must say that I share your thoughts,\" said Denbigh.  \"These Germans are no fools.  They are pretty thorough in whatever they take up, whether it's a diabolical scheme or otherwise.  It might be that there's something below that they don't want us to see, and rather than run a risk in that direction, they prefer to lock us up in the cabin.\"  \"That's all very well,\" rejoined O'Hara.  \"But it won't wash.  Old von Langer let it out in the course of conversation that this ship has already been examined by one of our cruisers.\"  \"Then perhaps the boarding-officer wasn't cute enough.  It's a tribute to our sagacity, old man,\" said Stirling.  \"However, time and events will prove.  By Jove, the fateful hour approaches!  What will von Riesser say to our decision?\"  At eight bells the three British officers were told to proceed to the kapitan's cabin.  This time von Riesser was alone.  He looked flustered and worried.  \"Sit down, gentlemen,\" he began.  \"You must look upon this as a private and confidential chat.  Now, to go straight to the point: are you prepared, in the event of your being given honourable treatment and allowed the greatest liberty possible, to maintain silence upon last night's affair?\"  Denbigh, as spokesman, did not think it advisable to give a direct reply.  \"Do you, on your part, promise to refrain from treacherous attacks upon Allied merchantmen?\" he asked.  \"I think I can give that guarantee,\" replied von Riesser.  \"If I do so, will you write a certificate to the effect that, to the best of your belief, I, as commander of the ship, am acting in accordance with the present accepted rules of naval warfare?  That, I think, will square matters.\"  \"We cannot do that,\" declared Denbigh.  \"We are willing to give a certificate to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36499"],["title","Rounding up the Raider: A Naval Story of the Great War (#6)"],["body","that you acted with discretion.\"  The kapitan smiled grimly.  \"There is a certain amount of latitude in that,\" he replied.  \"I suppose you will then say nothing of last night's business.\"  \"Since we have no direct evidence of what you have done, we cannot very well state a case,\" said Denbigh.  \"The thing is this: are you going to torpedo any merchantmen without warning?\"  \"No,\" replied von Riesser.  \"Very well.  We have forgotten last night,\" declared Denbigh.  \"Should occasion arise we will give you the required certificate.\"  \"And should occasion not arise,\" thought von Riesser, \"I will make it pretty hot for these young cubs.  Once safely in port in our African colony, I will show them what it means to thwart a Prussian officer.\"  With these sentiments in his mind and a smile on his face the kapitan dismissed his prisoners.  During the afternoon there was a thick haze.  It was impossible to distinguish anything beyond a distance of about a mile from the ship. Sea and sky were merged into an ill-defined blurr.  The glass, too, was falling rapidly.  That and the presence of the mist betokened an imminent change in the weather.  Suddenly there was a rift in the curtain of vapour.  At less than two miles away on the _Pelikan's_ port bow were two vessels, one being in tow of the other.  The subs were quick to recognize the leading craft.  She was a British cruiser of the \"Eclipse\" class--a vessel of 5600 tons, and with a nominal speed of 19 knots.  But the craft in tow was a puzzle to them. She was low-lying, with a raised superstructure amidships, one funnel, and a tall mast fitted with a fire-control platform.  From her for'ard turret two huge guns, seemingly out of all proportion to the rest of the ship, protruded.  The muzzles, instead of being inclined upwards, were depressed.  Although Denbigh and his companions could not distinguish details owing to the distance of the vessel, the German officers, by means of their telescopes and binoculars, could see that the muzzles of the guns were resting on large chocks bolted to the deck, while the protruding part of the weapons were additionally secured by stout hawsers.  The mysterious craft was apparently deserted.  Everything was battened down, for the decks were swept by the long Atlantic waves.  \"By Jove!\" ejaculated O'Hara.  \"She must be one of our monitors.  Now, where is she off to, I should like to know?  There's something in the wind.\"  [Illustration: \"BY JOVE!\" EJACULATED O'HARA, \"SHE MUST BE ONE OF OUR MONITORS.\"]  Kapitan von Riesser could have answered the question.  He stood on the bridge, glasses glued to his face and rage in his heart.  There could be but one solution.  The monitor was bound for the Indian Ocean, to take part in the forthcoming operations against the Germans in East Africa.  \"Donnerwetter!\" muttered von Riesser.  \"These accursed English.  They may throw away their opportunities on land, but they know how to do things at sea.\"  \"Shall I carry on, sir?\" asked the officer of the watch.  \"No, port helm,\" ordered the kapitan.  Then realizing that the carrying out of this command might arouse the suspicions of the British cruiser, he had the _Pelikan_ steadied on her helm.  The course would bring her within a mile of the cruiser and her tow.  \"The cheek!\" exclaimed Stirling.  \"Old von Riesser's going to play a game of bluff.\"  \"I vote we semaphore,\" suggested O'Hara impulsively.  \"We'd do the trick before they could stop us.\"  The Irishman, however, had no opportunity of putting his plan into effect, for at that moment a petty-officer informed the subs that it was the kapitan's pleasure they should go below.  They found the port-hole closed and locked.  Von Riesser was not a man to take needless risks.  A hoist of bunting fluttered from the cruiser's signal yard-arm.  It was a message in the International Code: \"E C--what ship is that?\"  Promptly the Dutch ensign was hoisted, while simultaneously the \"number\" of the real _Zwaan_ was made.  From the cruiser came another signal.  Von Riesser had no occasion to consult the code-book.  It was \"I D--Heave-to, or I fire.\"  \"Hard a-port!\" he shouted, and telegraphed for full speed ahead.  Round swung the _Pelikan_, listing until five feet of her underbody showed clear.  Even as she did so a couple of 12-pounders spat venomously, the shells passing perilously close to the towering hull.  Down fluttered the Dutch ensign.  The British cruiser ceased firing. Ahead lay a bank of fog.  Von Riesser knew that he was in a tight corner, and it was in tight corners that the better qualities of the man showed themselves.  For a few moments he stood motionless.  Every second the _Pelikan_ was slipping farther and farther away from the cruiser, which, hampered by her tow, was unable to stand in pursuit.  Her skipper was somewhat mystified.  According to the rules of the game the _Pelikan_ had struck, yet he knew that of necessity the immense bulk must carry considerable way.  The British cruiser had no doubts of the blue liner with the broad black band, for the survivors of the _Nichi Maru_ had been picked up by one of the patrolling vessels.  Once more that mixed blessing, wireless telegraphy, had been brought into service, and a description of the raider sent far and wide.  Already a number of light cruisers were on their way from Simon's Bay to intercept the _Pelikan_, while the blockading squadron off the east coast of Africa had been warned of the likely attempt on the part of the fugitive to gain one of the little-known and unfrequented rivers of the last of Germany's overseas possessions.  Von Riesser alternately kept glancing ahead and astern.  The haze was beginning to envelop the monitor and her escort.  He shouted an order to a petty officer.  The man doubled aft, bawling as he ran.  Then from the ensign staff fluttered the Black Cross of the Imperial German Navy.  The cruiser's reply was a salvo from her quick-firers.  Two shells struck home, one bursting on the poop and blowing the emblem of Germany to atoms, besides causing considerable damage to the deck.  A second burst amidships, shattering a couple of ventilators, splintering one of the boats, and destroying the greater portion of the bridge.  Fragments of metal and splinters of wood flew in all directions.  Kapitan von Riesser narrowly escaped being hit.  As it was, one of his officers and two seamen were killed outright, five others being seriously wounded, while the kapitan was thrown to the deck by the concussion.  For a few minutes the _Pelikan_ was enveloped in smoke and spray thrown up by the shells that exploded on either side; but before the cruiser could get in another effective shot the raider was lost in the mist.  Von Riesser guessed, and rightly, that the cat was out of the bag, otherwise the cruiser would not have hoisted that peremptory demand to heave-to.  He realized that his position was a hazardous one. Thousands of miles from a friendly port, sought by perhaps a score of British cruisers, and, moreover, running short of coal, the _Pelikan_ stood a very small chance of dropping anchor in East African waters, except as a prize.  On the other hand, Fate, in the guise of the mist, had dealt kindly with the _Pelikan_.  For the rest of the day she steamed westward. Down below the firemen toiled like Trojans, shovelling coal into the glowing furnaces.  On deck the crew worked hard, clearing away the debris left by the British cruiser's shells.  The wireless staff were busy \"jamming\" the numerous messages thrown out from various vessels, that were converging on the monitor and her escort for the purpose of cutting off the audacious _Pelikan_.  About an hour before sunset the mist cleared.  The sea was still calm, although high overhead the ragged and greasy clouds betokened the approach of a southerly gale.  The setting sun, a ball of bright yellow, set in a pale greenish-yellow sky, threw its slanting rays across the damaged bridge, almost blinding the look-out with its brilliance.  \"Sail on the starboard bow,\" reported one of the watchers.  Von Riesser, who had practically recovered from the shock of being capsized by the explosion, had not left the bridge.  He immediately gave orders to starboard the helm.  At the present juncture he would not risk meeting even an unarmed tramp laden with military stores.  The stranger was the British light cruiser _Actæon_, of 3000 tons, and with a speed of slightly over 20 knots.  Pelting towards the scene of the encounter between the _Pelikan_ and her foiled antagonist, the _Actæon_ was unwittingly approaching the fugitive.  She, having the advantage of the light, recognized the German liner almost before the latter had noticed her presence.  As the _Pelikan_ swung round, the _Actæon_ followed suit, both vessels being now on slightly converging courses and about six miles apart.  It was a question as to which of the two was the speediest ship--a question, seemingly, that events only could prove.  The sun set.  The short period of tropical twilight gave place to pitch-black night, for the moon, now two days after the full, had not yet risen.  On board the _Pelikan_ all lights that might be visible from outside were extinguished, save for one white light shown aft.  The pursuing vessel displayed no lights, but her approximate position could be fixed by means of the dull-red glow of the flames that issued from her three funnels.  \"Do you think she's gaining, von Langer?\" asked the kapitan anxiously, after an interval of almost unbroken silence as far as the officers on the _Pelikan's_ bridge were concerned.  \"I am not sure,\" replied the ober-leutnant.  \"We do not appear to be gaining on her.  It may be that we are just holding our own.\"  \"Unless we can shake her off completely before sunrise we stand little chance,\" said von Riesser moodily.  \"We cannot stand up to her.  Those guns would send us to the bottom in a quarter of an hour, long before we came within torpedo range.\"  \"If"]]]
