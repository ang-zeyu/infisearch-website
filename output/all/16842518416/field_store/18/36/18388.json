If my proposition pleases you, send them to me by the Austrian Embassy, marking the price that you would like to have for them. As regards any passages to be altered, if there are any, you need only mark them with a red pencil, according to your plan which I know so well, and I will point them out to the editor with the utmost care. Give me at the same time some news about music and pianists in Vienna; and finally tell me, dear Master, which of your compositions you think would make the best effect in society.  I close by sending you my heartfelt greetings, and begging you once more to pardon the shameful silence I have kept towards you: be assured that it has given me as much pain as yourself!  Your very affectionate and grateful pupil,  F. Liszt  December 23rd, 1828  P.S.--Please answer me as soon as possible, for I am longing for a letter from you; and please embrace your excellent parents from me. I add my address (Rue Montholon, No. 7bis).    2. To De Mancy in Paris  [Autograph in the possession of M. Etienne Charavay in Paris.]  December 23rd, 1829  My Dear M. de Mancy,  I am so full of lessons that each day, from half-past eight in the morning till 10 at night, I have scarcely breathing time. Please excuse me therefore for not coming, as I should have liked to do, to lunch with Madame de Mancy, but it is quite impossible. The only thing I could do would be to come about 10 o'clock, if that would not be too late for a wedding day, and in that case I will beg M. Ebner [Carl Ebner, a Hungarian, a talented violinist (1812-1836)] to come with me. I don't write you a longer letter, for there is a pupil who has been waiting for me for an hour. Besides, we are not standing on ceremony. Ever yours,  F. Liszt    3. To Carl Czerny  [Autograph in the Musical Society's Archives in Vienna. Printed in a German translation: \"La Mara, Letters of Musicians extending over Five Centuries.\" II. Leipzig, B. and H. 1887.]  My dear and beloved Master,  It would be impossible to explain to you the why and wherefore of my leaving you so long without news of me. Moreover, I have now only five minutes in which to write to you, for Mr. Luden, a pianist from Copenhagen, is starting shortly, and for fear of delaying his journey I must be brief; but what is postponed is not lost, so cheer up, for very soon you will get a great thick letter from me, which I will take care to prepay, as I should not like to ruin you.  Among all the circles of artists where I go in this country I plead your cause tremendously: we all want you to come and stay some time in Paris; it would certainly do you a great deal of good, and you are so widely esteemed that you will doubtless be well satisfied with the reception you will meet with here. If you ever entertain this idea, write to me, I entreat you, for I will do for you what I would do for my father. I have been making a special study of your admirable sonata (Op. 7), and have since played it at several reunions of connoisseurs (or would-be connoisseurs): you cannot imagine what an effect it made; I was quite overcome by it. It was in a burst of enthusiasm caused by the Prestissimo, that Mr. Luden begged for a few words of introduction to you; I know your kindness, indeed I could never forget it. I therefore commend him in all confidence of your goodness, until the time when I am so happy as to embrace you myself and to show you (however feebly) all the gratitude and admiration which fill me.  F. Liszt  Paris, August 26th, 1830    4. To Alphonse Brot in Paris  [Autograph in the possession of M. Etienne Charavay in Paris.]  (Paris, Beginning of the 30th year.)  It would give us great pleasure, my dear M. Brot, if you would come and dine with us without ceremony tomorrow, Monday, about 6 o'clock; I do not promise you a good dinner,--that is not the business of us poor artists; but the good company you will meet will, I trust, make up for that. Monsieur Hugo [the poet] and Edgard Quinet [French writer and philosopher] have promised to come. So do try not to disappoint us, for we should miss you much. My good mother told me to press you to come, for she is very fond of you. Till tomorrow then! Kind regards and thanks.  F. Liszt  I have been at least six times to you without having the pleasure of seeing you.  61, Rue de Provence.    5. Monsieur Pierre Wolff (Junior), Rue de la Tertasse, Geneva, Switzerland  [Autograph in the possession of M. Gaston Calmann-Levy in Paris.]  Nous disons: \"Il est temps. Executons, c'est l'heure.\" Alors nous retournons les yeux--La Mort est la! Ainsi de mes projets.--Quand vous verrai-je, Espagne, Et Venise et son golfe, et Rome et sa campagne,  Toi, Sicile, que ronge un volcan souterrain, Grece qu'on connait trop, Sardaigne qu'on ignore, Cites de l'Aquilon, du Couchant, de l'Aurore, Pyramides du Nil, Cathedrales du Rhin! Qui sait?-- jamais peut-etre!  [We say: \"Now it is time. Let's act, for 'tis the hour.\" Then turn we but our eyes--lo! death is there! Thus with my plans. When shall I see thee, Espagna, And Venice with her gulf, and Rome with her Campagna; Thou, Sicily, whom volcanoes undermine; Greece, whom we know too well, Sardinia, unknown one, Lands of the north, the west, the rising sun, Pyramids of the Nile, Cathedrals of the Rhine! Who knows? Never perchance!]  Earthly life is but a malady of the soul, an excitement which is kept up by the passions. The natural state of the soul is rest!  Paris, May 2nd [1832]  Here is a whole fortnight that my mind and fingers have been working like two lost spirits, Homer, the Bible, Plato, Locke, Byron, Hugo, Lamartine, Chateaubriand, Beethoven, Bach, Hummel, Mozart, Weber, are all around me. I study them, meditate on them, devour them with fury; besides this I practice four to five hours of exercises (3rds, 6ths, 8ths, tremolos, repetition of notes, cadences, etc., etc.). Ah! provided I don't go mad, you will find an artist in me! Yes, an artist such as you desire, such as is required nowadays!  \"And I too am a painter!\" cried Michael Angelo the first time he beheld a chef d'oeuvre...Though insignificant and poor, your friend cannot leave off repeating those words of the great man ever since Paganini's last performance. Rene, what a man, what a violin, what an artist! Heavens! what sufferings, what misery, what tortures in those four strings!  Here are a few of his characteristics:--  [Figure: Liszt here writes down several tiny excerpts from musical scores of Paganini's violin music, such as his famous \"Caprices\"]  As to his expression, his manner of phrasing, his very soul in fact!----  May 8th [1832]  My good friend, it was in a paroxysm of madness that I wrote you the above lines; a strain of work, wakefulness, and those violent desires (for which you know me) had set my poor head aflame; I went from right to left, then from left to right (like a sentinel in the winter, freezing), singing, declaiming, gesticulating, crying out; in a word, I was delirious. Today the spiritual and the animal (to use the witty language of M. de Maistre) are a little more evenly balanced; for the volcano of the heart is not extinguished, but is working silently.--Until when?--  Address your letters to Monsieur Reidet, the receiver-general at the port of Rouen.  A thousand kind messages to the ladies Boissier. I will tell you some day the reasons which prevented me from starting for Geneva. On this subject I shall call you in evidence.  Bertini is in London; Madame Malibran is making her round of Germany; Messemaecker (how is he getting on?) is resting on his laurels at Brussels; Aguado has the illustrious maestro Rossini in tow.--Ah--Hi--Oh--Hu!!!    6. To Ferdinand Hiller  [This letter, published by F. Niecks (\"F. Chopin, Man and Musician,\" Vol. 1. German by Langhans. Leipzig, Leuckart, 1890), was written by Liszt and Chopin jointly, and was also signed by Chopin's friend Franchomme, the violoncellist. The part written by Chopin is indicated here by parentheses ().--Addressed to the well-known composer and author, afterwards Director of the Conservatorium and Concert Society at Cologne (1811-1885).]  This is the twentieth time, at least, that we have tried to meet, first at my house, then here, with the intention of writing to you, and always some visit, or some other unforeseen hindrance, has occurred. I don't know whether Chopin will be strong enough to make excuses to you; for my part, it seems to me that we have been so unmannerly and impertinent that no excuses are now permissible or possible.  We sympathized most deeply in your bereavement, and more deeply did we wish that we could be with you in order to soften, as far as possible, the grief of your heart. [Hiller had lost his father.]  (He has said it all so well that I have nothing to add to excuse me specially for my negligence or idleness, or whim or distraction, or--or--or--You know that I can explain myself better in person, and, this autumn, when I take you home late by the boulevards to your mother, I shall try to obtain your pardon. I am writing to you without knowing what my pen is scribbling, as Liszt is at this moment playing my Studies, and transporting me away from all suitable ideas. I wish I could steal his manner of rendering my own works. With regard to your friends who are staying in Paris, I have often seen, during this winter and spring, the Leo family [August Leo, banker in Paris], and all that follows. There have been evenings at certain ambassadresses' houses, and there was not a single one at which somebody living at Frankfort was not mentioned. Madame Eichthal sends you many kind messages--Plater [Count Plater, Chopin's countryman, and a friend also of Liszt], the whole family were very sorry for your departure, and begged me to give you their condolences.) Madame d'Apponyi [Apponyi, the Austrian ambassador in Paris] was very much vexed with me for not having taken you there before your departure; she hopes "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],["title","Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#3)"],["body","when you come back you will be sure to remember the promise you made me. I will say as much of a certain lady who is not an ambassadress.  Do you know Chopin's wonderful Studies?--(They are admirable! and moreover they will last only until yours appear) = an author's little piece of modesty!!! (A little piece of rudeness on the part of the regent, for--to explain the matter fully--he is correcting my spelling) according to the method of Monsieur Marlet.  You will come back in the month of (September, isn't it? tr)y [Tach]ez] to let us know the day; we have determined to give you a serenade or charivari [mock serenade]. The company of the most distinguished artists of the capital = M. Franchomme (present), Madame Petzold, and the Abbe Bardin [passionate lover of music, who had a great many artists to see him], the leaders of the Rue d'Amboise (and my neighbors), Maurice Schlesinger [music publisher], uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, and--and (\"en plan du troisienae,\" etc.).

If you have a moment to spare, give us news of yourself, which would be most welcome. Paris, Rue de la Chaussee d'Antin, No. 5. At present I am occupying Franck's lodging [Dr. Hermann Franck, author, friend of Chopin and of many other celebrities; editor also for a short time, in the forties, of Brockhaus's \"Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung\"]--he is gone to London and Berlin. I am most happy in the rooms which were so often our meeting-place. Berlioz sends greetings.  As to pere Baillot, he is in Switzerland, at Geneva. So now you can guess that I can't send you the Bach concerto.  June 20th, 1833)    7. To Abbe F. de Lamennais  [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.-- Addressed to the celebrated French author (1782-1854), who followed his brilliant apology of Catholicism, \"Essai sur l'Indifference en Matiere de Religion\" (Essay on Indifference in Matters of Religion, 1817-1823), by the \"Paroles d'un Croyant\" (Words of a Believer, 1834), a veritable \"Ode to revolution in the sublimest biblical style,\" and sought to bring religious and political liberty into accord with true religiousness. The latter work made an unheard-of sensation, but brought upon him the anathema of the Church. He obtained a great influence over Liszt, who was on intimate terms with him.]  Four months have actually passed, dear Father, since we parted, and I feel very sad at not getting a word from you!--at the same time I do not wish to complain, for it seems to me that you can never doubt my deep and filial affection...Much more, I even know that you have been willing to accept it, and, however humble it may be, to count it for something...What more then can I desire?...  Eugene, whose brotherly friendship becomes dearer to me day by day, has often given me good tidings of you. The last time I saw him he told me confidentially that you were working at a sort of Introduction, or developed Preface to your works.--Although I know perfectly well that my interest counts for nothing in this matter, I may be permitted nevertheless to tell you how glad I am to know that you are occupied with this work. To yourself, first of all, I think you owe it--your name and glory will shine out all the more powerfully for it. And, secondly, for the public it will be a work of art the more (and this commodity becomes rather rare as time goes on), and which will besides have the double advantage of aiding and fixing them in the understanding of your past works, whilst at the same time preparing them for, and initiating them into, your future thoughts.  And, lastly, for us who love you, and who would glory and be proud to be one day called your disciples, we rejoice in it because the world will learn to know you better by this means, and because it will probably be another opportunity for us to show our sympathetic admiration as well as our unalterable devotion for you.  Unless something very unforeseen occurs, I shall come again and beg you to receive me for a few days towards the middle of July; I trust sufficiently to your sincerity to tell me that you would rather not have me if my individuality would trouble or bother you too much.--Before that, I shall have the honor of sending you a little work, to which I have had the audacity to tack a great name--yours.--It is an instrumental De profundis. The plain-song that you like so much is preserved in it with the Faburden. Perhaps this may give you a little pleasure, at any rate, I have done it in remembrance of some hours passed (I should say \"lived\") at La Chenaie.  Farewell, dear Father. I don't give you any news of Paris,--you know all that. You know that Ballanche wants to be an Academician, and accepts Salvandy and Dupaty as competitors,--you know the little check of January,--the miserable petty intrigues of court and newspaper and vestry;--in a word, you know how men are wanting in noble and generous sentiments, and how they make the most of their own ignoble ends and interests, to which their words and actions yet give the lie.  Farewell once more, dear Father. Think as often as possible of all the good you have done, and of that which men have a right to expect of you. Think sometimes also of the help and the wealth of affection that you have showered on me in particular, and may the remembrance of this be sweet to you!...  Yours ever, for life--from heart and soul,  F. Liszt  January 14th, 1835  Tomorrow morning I have to leave for two months. If you should be so good as to write to me before my return, please address always, 61, Rue de Provence. My mother will take care that I have your kind letter.    8. To his Mother  [From a copy, by Mr. Vladimir Stassoff of St. Petersburg, the original of which is in Russia. The letter in itself is unimportant, but it is the only one to Liszt's mother which the editor could get, and gives a fresh proof of the devotion of the artist to his mother.]  Dear Mother,  Please send me at once, without any delay, the Pianist's Glossary, which you will get at Lemonier's, Rue de l'Echelle.  Simply put it in a cover, and put it in the post (General Office), and I shall get it, at latest, by Monday or Tuesday.--  Address to Mr. Hermann Cohen, Grande Rue, No. 8.  [Cohen was a frequently mentioned pupil and favorite of Liszt's who was born at Hamburg in 1820, much thought of as a pianist in Paris, and immortalised as \"Puzzi\" by George Sand (\"Lettres d'un Voyageur\"); he followed Liszt to Geneva, and gave lessons there. In 1850 he entered the order of Carmelites, and, under the name of Pater Augustin, died in Berlin in January 1871, whither he had gone with French prisoners.]  I have an immense deal to do this morning, so that I have barely time to tell you that I love you with all my heart, and that I rejoice above everything at the prospect of seeing you again soon--that is to say, in six or eight months.  F. Liszt  You will hear of me from Mr. Pinondel, who passed a day with us.    9. To the Abbe F. de Lamennais, La Chenaie  [Autograph in the possession of Mr. Marshall in London.]  [Paris, May 28th, 1836--according to the stamp of the post office]  Dear and venerable Father,  I shall expect you. Whatever sorrow there is in the depth of my soul, it will be sweet and consoling to me to see you again.  You are so wonderfully good to me! and I should suffer so much by being so long away from you!--  Au revoir then, once more--in eight days at latest it will be, will it not? I do nothing else than keep expecting you.  Yours, with the deepest respect and most sincere devotion,  F. Liszt    10. To Mademoiselle Lydie Pavy, of La Glaciere, Lyons  [Autograph in the possession of M. Etienne Charavay in Paris.]  St. Gervais, August 22nd [1836].  Your postscript deserves a punishment, and here it comes dated from St. Gervais. I do not know whether your charming sister-in- law, Madame Pavy, will consider this stamp of St. Gervais worthy to appear in her collection; be that as it may, it gives me no less a pleasure to converse a little with you who are always so charming, so versatile, so excellent, and, permit me to say, so kind to me.  Mademoiselle Merienne, whom I saw only quite lately (for you must know that during the whole month of July, of glorious memory, I have barely condescended to go down once or twice to Geneva; I was living in a little bit of a house on the mountain, whence, let me say parenthetically, it would have been quite easy for me to hurl sermons and letters at you); Mademoiselle Merienne (what shall I say to you after such an enormous parenthesis?), somewhat like (by way of a new parenthesis) those declaimed discourses of Plantade or Lhuillier, which put a stop to music whilst nevertheless admitting that there is such a thing, whether at the beginning or at the end--Mademoiselle Merienne--au diable Mademoiselle Merienne! You guess by this time that she gave me tidings of you, that she is a delightful and enchanting person, that she makes admirable portraits, and that mine, amongst others, has been a wonderful success. Etc., etc., and always etc...  And yet I do wish to talk to you about this good Mademoiselle Merienne, for she said a heap of charming things to me for your sake, which will certainly not astonish you. But how to set about it after all this preamble of parentheses? Ah, I have it!--In three or four weeks I shall come and knock at your door.--And then? Well, then we will chatter away at our ease. So much the worse for you if you are not satisfied with my cunning stratagem. Now let us talk business; yes, seriously, let us talk business!  Has your "]]]
