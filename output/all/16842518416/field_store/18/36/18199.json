Our party here consists of English, Irish, German, & Americans-2 of the first- 4 of the second- 1 of the third- & a house full of the last-- This strange man is an everlasting talker- He knows every body & every thing about them- He has been repeating one of M^r Pierpont Edwards' speeches to me- & one of M^r Hilhouse's-Not one second elapses between his words-He is a very pompous fellow & takes great pains to display what he does know- He has been a schoolmaster-& now I suspect is crazy & running away with a girl he calls his wife- but who seems to be nobody---- It rain'd very fast last night- & is more muddy than ever--     Monday night- a mile west of the mountains-   Rejoice with me my dear Elizabeth, that we are at length over all the mountains, so call'd-- I do not suppose we shall be much better off than we were before, as it respects roads- for I had just as lieve go over a mountain, as to go over the same distance of any part of the road we have had this fortnight or three weeks- But it sounds well to say we are over the mountains-- We cross'd Chesnut Ridge, the 7th & last M^{tn} this afternoon- It is 5 miles over--12 miles we have come to day-- There is a pretty prospect of hills as you come down the M^{tn}- One house on the top of it-- We have taken a great deal of pains to get rid of company to day, by going forward & staying behind- but it is an _unpossibility_ (M^r Newington) I am more out of patience than ever-- We came on to the 4^{th} tavern after we got down,- because we thought those behind us, would stop sooner- M^{rs} Jackson & her tribe were with us-but we thought all the rest were out of the reach of us- This is a little hut, one window in front- but it is neat & comfortable inside, & we were all quietly seated round the fire, congratulating ourselves on our escape, when in came the young doctor- I thought we should all scream out- M^{rs} Jackson told him she thought we had lost him- he said he lik'd not to have found us- I wish with all my heart, they had got fast in the mud a little while. The rattlebrain'd fellow is not here, to talk us to death-- He pass'd us on the road, singing & screaming, advising us to go back & learn hog latin- alias German- or dutch-- We are now 41 miles from Pitt----     Nov^{br} 21^{st} Tuesday Night-A mile from Greensburg-Penn-   We have had better roads to day, but only came 10 miles-- Last night we had good beds, but were oblig'd to sleep in the room with the D^r & his father-M^r & M^{rs} W- of course, as we have determin'd not to sleep out of their room again-- The landlord & his wife were extremely clever- they gave us a great many apples & some cherry bounce- Such treatment, after being refus'd even the privilege of getting any victuals,- as we were the night before, was very welcome-- The landlord has been a waggoner-\"Only look at that now\"-A clever waggoner! I cannot but think his cleverness (is there such a word?) came after he gave up his waggon---- After riding a little way, we overtook M^r Smith again, & found he had been fighting with a waggoner, who began to insult him, by calling him a damn'd Yankee-before they ended M^r S- whipt 3 of them- I was glad they got whipt, for almost every one deserves it-- M^r S- lamented we were not there to see the fun- He declar'd, or rather swore, he would not leave us again, but would stand by and fight for all- He lets his wife ride alone, & he walks on to talk to every one that will listen to him-- As for the D^r, he is \"nothing but a pester\"- Susan & I took a great deal of pains to go either before or behind to get rid of his company, but it does no good, for he will either wait, or walk faster- I had a great mind to ask him, if he expected to lose his wife soon-We pass'd thro Greensburg, a pretty little town, situated on a high hill- the other waggons had gone on, & were bating in the town- but M^r W- did not stop, so the D^r follow'd on & left his father, & waited at another place for us to bait- We were only able to come a mile farther, as the horses fail'd-The rest of the company had gone on, expecting us to follow- The D^r came in here with us & I thought intended to stay, by his actions, but he at length walk'd on to join the rest of his company-- We have escap'd hearing M^r S- talk, which I would not be oblig'd to do for 9 pence an hour-  Wednesday morn- I have not spent so pleasant an evening this long time as the last- Will you believe me, when I tell you we heard some waggoners conversing upon religious subjects- instead of swearing & cursing- One is an Irish waggoner, & appears to be sensible, well inform'd man- & what is more, has read his bible- 2 clever waggoners! I think I will never condemn a whole race again- I can now, even believe it possible to find a clever Dutchman in Pennsylvania. I hope we shall lose all our company this morning- but I expect they will wait for us- This is a good tavern- We have had sun shine for 2 days past- The weather, as it respects heat & cold, is very variable- but it invariably rains every day--     Thursday Morn- Sewel's tavern-Versailes-township-   Yesterday morning, we did not set out till quite late, but had the good fortune to overtake all our company within an hour or two, & were oblig'd once more to put up with them- We had also, a considerable addition to our party-- We were oblig'd to walk a great deal, & just at night, I happen'd to be on before the waggon some distance & prevented M^r W- from stopping at a private house, which we pass'd- I did not think of his wishing it till M^{rs} J-mentioned it, I then set out to return, but saw the waggon coming & sat down on a log- We did not reach a tavern till some time after dark- & M^r W-got hurt & his waggon got set-, & he feels unpleasantly towards me, & thinks me the whole cause of his trouble-- The whole family feel & treat me differently this morning, & I can not think myself to blame- for we are oblig'd to walk almost all the time, & if we are behind the waggon M^r W- always is angry-- M^{rs} W- Susan & I, were oblig'd to walk, till we found a house, & if the young D^r had not been with us, I don't know but we should have pass'd the night in the woods - but he was so good as to assist us - The gentlemen all reach'd the tavern before us, & when M^r W- came & told his trouble, they very kindly went back & assisted him-- There were but two beds to be had, so M^r Smith gave up his place to me, & M^r & M^{rs} W took the other-- The gentlemen were very noisy all night, as they could not lie down-- I am much better pleas'd with M^r & M^{rs} Smith, than I was before- He is a lawyer- & I believe knows more, than I at first suspected-- He is a great talker, & has a story for everything- We came 14 miles yesterday-- To day I am so dreadfully lame that every step I take, almost brings tears- my feet are sore with walking-     Nov-24- Friday morn- Turtle Creek-Penn-   One misfortune follows another, and I fear we shall never reach our journey's end-- Yesterday we came about 3 miles-- After coming down an awful hill, we were oblig'd to cross a creek; but before we quite came to it, the horses got mired, & we expected every moment one of them would die-but Erastus held his head out of water, while M^r W-was attempting to unharness them, & M^{rs} W- & Susan were on the bank, calling for help-- I sat by, to see the horse breathe his last; but was happily disappointed in my expectation-- No assistance could be got- till M^r W- waded though the water, & then 2 men with 3 horses came over-- We came to this Inn, & M^r W- thought it best to stay till this morning- All our company have gone on- M^r Smith invited me to ride with his wife, on to Pitts'^g- & I on some accounts, wish I had accepted his invitation-indeed I could scarcely get beside it--  We found a gentleman (Doctor I presume by his looks-) here, who was very sociable & staid an hour with us- He appear'd to be a man of good information & considerable politeness-- We found the landlord very good natur'd & obliging, & his wife directly the contrary-- We find the men generally, much more so than their wives-- We are 12 miles from Pitt----& here like to be- The landlord offers to keep Susan & me, till spring, & let the old folks go on-- We got into the slough of Despond yesterday-& are now at the foot of the hill Difficulty- which is half a mile long- one waggon is already fast in the mud on it- & M^r W- is afraid to attempt it himself--I think I will winter here----     Friday eve- 9 miles past Pitts'^g- Penn-   This morning we set out once more & proceeded 4 miles- It was snowing very fast, & one of our horses was taken sick & could scarcely get that little distance-M^r W- was oblig'd to whip it almost every step to keep it from lying down-- We could not ride at all & stopt at the first tavern we came to--We are afraid the horse will die & then what will become of us?---- I am more than ever discouraged-  Sat-morn- Our horse is better & we are going to set out again----     Nov^{br} 26- Saturday night- 3-1/2 miles beyond Pittsburg-   Just as we were getting into the waggon this morning, M^r W- found he had left his great coat 4 miles back, & went back on foot after it, while we proceeded to Pitts- which we reach'd about noon-- M^r W- came about an hour after---- After getting well warm, Susan & I were going out to view the town, when M^r W- came & hurried us away, as he wished to cross the river before night- From the little we did see of the town, I was extremely disappointed at its appearance- It is not one half as large as I suppos'd- but I am unable to give you any account of it, from my own observation-- It is situated at the confluence of the 2 rivers, the Alleghany, & Monongahela- The town suffer'd very much by the flood- One house floated down the river- its inhabitants were in the upper part of it calling for assistance-none could be render'd & what became of them I did not learn- I believe it is not known- "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3613"],["title","Miscellaneous Pieces (#0)"],["body","from the 1845 Thomas Nelson “Works of the Puritan Divines (Bunyan)” edition by David Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org                    [Picture: Bunyan’s cottage at Elstow]                                 MISCELLANEOUS PIECES   CONTENTS                                          Page Of the Trinity and a Christian           245 Of the Law and a Christian               251 Bunyan’s Last Sermon                     257 Bunyan’s Dying Sayings                   267     OF THE TRINITY AND A CHRISTIAN.    _How a young or shaken Christian should demean himself under the weighty   thoughts of the Doctrine of the Trinity or Plurality of Persons in the                             eternal Godhead_.  THE reason why I say a _young_ or _shaken_ Christian, is, because some that are not young, but of an ancient standing, may not only be assaulted with violent temptations concerning gospel-principles, but a second time may become a child, a babe, a shallow man, in the things of God: especially, either when by backsliding he hath provoked God to leave him, or when some new, unexpected, and (as to present strength) over weighty objection doth fall upon the spirit, by means of which great shakings of mind do commonly attend such a soul in the most weighty matters of the concerns of faith, of which this is one that I have supposed in the above-mentioned question: Wherefore passing other things, I will come directly to that, and briefly propose some helps to a soul in such a case.  I.  The first preparative.  _First_, Then, be sure thou keep close to the Word of God for that is the revelation of the mind and will of God, both as to the truth of what is either in himself or ways, and also as to what he requireth and expecteth of thee, either concerning faith in, or obedience to, what he hath so revealed.  Now for thy better performing of this, I shall give thee in brief these following directions.  1.  Suffer thyself, by the authority of the Word, to be persuaded that the Scripture indeed is the Word of God the Scriptures of truth, the words of the Holy One; and that they therefore must be every one true, pure, and for ever settled in heaven.  2.  Conclude therefore from the former doctrine, that that God whose words they are, is able to make a reconciliation and most sweet and harmonious agreement with all the sayings therein, how obscure, cross, dark, and contradictory soever they seem to thee.  To understand all mysteries, to have all knowledge, to be able to comprehend with all saints, is a great work; enough to crush the spirit, and to stretch the strings of the most capacious, widened soul that breatheth on this side glory, be they notwithstanding exceedingly enlarged by revelation.  Paul, when he was caught up to heaven, saw that which was unlawful, because impossible, for man to utter.  And saith Christ to the reasoning Pharisee, “If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things?”  It is great lewdness, and also insufferable arrogancy, to come to the Word of God, as conceiting already that whatever thou readest must either by thee be understood, or of itself fall to the ground as a senseless error.  But God is wiser than man, wherefore fear thou him, and tremble at his word, saying still, with godly suspicion of thine own infirmity, What I see not, teach thou me; and, Thou art God only wise; but as for me, I am as a beast before thee.  3.  Take heed of taking a part of the Word only, lest thou thereby go away with the truth as mangled in pieces.  For instance, where thou readest, “The Lord our God is one Lord,” there take heed that thou dost not thence conclude, then there are not three persons in the Godhead: when thou readest of “the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,” then take heed of concluding there must therefore either be three Gods, or else that Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are not true God, but the Father only.  Wherefore to help thee here, observe,  II.  The second preparative.  1.  That the Christian religion requireth credit concerning every doctrine contained in the Word; credit, I say, according to the true relation of every sentence that the Holy Ghost hath revealed for the asserting, maintaining, or vindicating that same truth.  2.  And therefore, hence it is that a Christian is not called a doer, a reasoner, an objector, and perverse disputer, but a believer.  Be thou an example to “the believers;” and, “believers” were “added to the church,” &c.  3.  Therefore, know again, that the Word, if it saith and expresseth that this or that is so and so, as to the matter in hand, thou art bound and obliged, both by the name, profession, and the truth, unto which thou hast joined thyself, to assent to, confess, and acknowledge the same, even then when thy carnal reason will not stoop thereto.  “Righteous art thou, O God,” saith Jeremiah, “yet let me plead with thee; Wherefore do the wicked live?”  Mark, first he acknowledgeth that God’s way with the wicked is just and right, even then when yet he could not see the reason of his actions and dispensations towards them.  The same reason is good as to our present case: and hence it is that the apostle saith, the spiritual armour of Christians should be much exercised against those high towering and self-exalting imaginations, that within our own bosoms do exalt themselves against the knowledge of God; that every thought or carnal reasoning may be not only taken, but brought a captive into obedience to Christ; that is, be made to stoop to the Word of God, and to give way and place to the doctrine therein contained, how cross soever our thoughts and the Word lie to each other.  And it is observable that he here saith, “they exalt themselves against the knowledge of God;” which cannot be understood, that our carnal, natural reason doth exalt itself against an eternal deity, simply considered; for that nature itself doth gather from the very things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead: it must be then that they exalt themselves against that God as thus and thus revealed in the Word, to wit, against the knowledge of one God, consisting of three persons, Father, Son, and Spirit; for this is the doctrine of the Scriptures of truth: and therefore it is observable these thoughts must be brought captive, and be made subject in particular to the Lord Jesus Christ, as to the second person in the Godhead: for the Father is ever acknowledged by all that profess the least of religion; but the Son is that stumbling-stone and rock of offence, against which thousands dash themselves in pieces; though in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and in him dwells the fulness of the Godhead bodily.     OF THE LAW AND A CHRISTIAN.   THE law was given twice upon Mount Sinai, but the appearance of the Lord, when he gave it the second time, was wonderfully different from that of his, when at the first he delivered it to Israel.  1.  When he gave it the first time, he caused his terror and severity to appear before Moses, to the shaking of his soul and the dismaying of Israel; but when he gave it the second time, he caused all his goodness to pass before Moses, to the comfort of his conscience and the bowing of his heart.  2.  When he gave it the first time, it was with thunderings and lightnings, with blackness and darkness, with flame and smoke, and a tearing sound of the trumpet; but when he gave it the second time, it was with a proclamation of his name to be merciful, gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgressions, and sins.  3.  When he gave it the first time, Moses was called to go up to receive it through the fire, which made him exceedingly fear and quake: but when he went to receive it the second time, he was laid in a clift of the rock.  4.  From all which I gather, that, though as to the matter of the law, both as to its being given the first time and the second, it binds the unbeliever under the pains of eternal damnation (if he close not with Christ by faith); yet as to the manner of its giving at these two times, I think the first doth more principally intend its force as a covenant of works, not at all respecting the Lord Jesus; but this second time not (at least in the manner of its being given) respecting such a covenant, but rather as a rule or directory to those who already are found in the clift of the rock Christ; for the saint himself, though he be without law to God, as it is considered the first or old covenant, yet even he is not without law to him as considered under grace; not without law to God, but under the law to Christ.  5.  Though, therefore, it be sad with the unbeliever, because he only and wholly standeth under the law as it is given in fire, in smoke, in blackness, and darkness, and thunder; all which threaten him with eternal ruin if he fulfil not the utmost tittle thereof; yet the believer stands to the law under no such consideration, neither is he so at all to hear or regard it, for he is now removed from thence to the blessed mountain of Zion—to grace and forgiveness of sins; he is now, I say, by faith in the Lord Jesus, shrouded under so perfect and blessed a righteousness, that this thundering law of Mount Sinai cannot find the least fault or diminution therein, but rather approveth and alloweth thereof, either when or wherever it find it.  This is called the righteousness of God without the law, and also said to be witnessed by both the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God, which is by faith in Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference.  6.  Wherefore, whenever thou who believest in Jesus, dost hear the law in its thundering and lightning fits, as if it would burn up heaven and earth, then say thou, I am freed from this law, these thunderings have nothing to do with my soul; nay, even this law, while it thus thunders"]]]
