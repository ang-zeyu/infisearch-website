ALI PACHA alpac10.txt or alpac10.zip [Etext #2753]  Albania was one of the most difficult provinces to manage.  Its inhabitants were poor, brave, and, the nature of the country was mountainous and inaccessible.  The pashas had great difficulty in collecting tribute, because the people were given to fighting for their bread.  Whether Mahomedans or Christians, the Albanians were above all soldiers.  Descended on the one side from the unconquerable Scythians, on the other from the ancient Macedonians, not long since masters of the world; crossed with Norman adventurers brought eastwards by the great movement of the Crusades; they felt the blood of warriors flow in their veins, and that war was their element.  Sometimes at feud with one another, canton against canton, village against village, often even house against house; sometimes rebelling against the government their sanjaks; sometimes in league with these against the sultan; they never rested from combat except in an armed peace.  Each tribe had its military organisation, each family its fortified stronghold, each man his gun on his shoulder.  When they had nothing better to do, they tilled their fields, or mowed their neighbours', carrying off, it should be noted, the crop; or pastured their, flocks, watching the opportunity to trespass over pasture limits.  This was the normal and regular life of the population of Epirus, Thesprotia, Thessaly, and Upper Albania.      MURAT murat10.txt or murat10.zip [Etext #2755]  On the 18th June, 1815, at the very moment when the destiny of Europe was being decided at Waterloo, a man dressed like a beggar was silently following the road from Toulon to Marseilles.  Arrived at the entrance of the Gorge of Ollioulles, he halted on a little eminence from which he could see all the surrounding country; then either because he had reached the end of his journey, or because, before attempting that forbidding, sombre pass which is called the Thermopylae of Provence, he wished to enjoy the magnificent view which spread to the southern horizon a little longer, he went and sat down on the edge of the ditch which bordered the road, turning his back on the mountains which rise like an amphitheatre to the north of the town, and having at his feet a rich plain covered with tropical vegetation, exotics of a conservatory, trees and flowers quite unknown in any other part of France.      THE COUNTESS OF SAINT GERAN geran10.txt or geran10.zip [Etext #2754]  \"Could not, for instance,\" said the marquis, \"a confinement be effected without pain?\"  \"I don't know about that, but this I do\" know, that I shall take very good care not to practise any method contrary to the laws of nature.\"  \"You are deceiving me: you are acquainted with this method, you have already practised it upon a certain person whom I could name to you.\"  \"Who has dared to calumniate me thus?  I operate only after the decision of the Faculty.  God forbid that I should be stoned by all the physicians, and perhaps expelled from France!\"      MARQUISE DE BRINVILLIERS brinv10.txt or brinv10.zip [Etext #2756]  When the prayer was done and the doctor raised his head, he saw before him the executioner wiping his face.  \"Well, sir,\" said he, \"was not that a good stroke?  I always put up a prayer on these occasions, and God has always assisted me; but I have been anxious for several days about this lady.  I had six masses said, and I felt strengthened in hand and heart.\" He then pulled out a bottle from under his cloak, and drank a dram; and taking the body under one arm, all dressed as it was, and the head in his other hand, the eyes still bandaged, he threw both upon the faggots, which his assistant lighted.  \"The next day,\" says Madame de Sevigne, \"people were looking for the charred bones of Madame de Brinvilliers, because they said she was a saint.\"      MARQUISE DE GANGES gange10.txt or gange10.zip [Etext #2758]  The beginnings of this union were perfectly happy; the marquis was in love for the first time, and the marquise did not remember ever to have been in love.  A son and a daughter came to complete their happiness. The marquise had entirely forgotten the fatal prediction, or, if she occasionally thought of it now, it was to wonder that she could ever have believed in it.  Such happiness is not of this world, and when by chance it lingers here a while, it seems sent rather by the anger than by the goodness of God.  Better, indeed, would it be for him who possesses and who loses it, never to have known it.       VANINKA vanin10.txt or vanin10.zip [Etext #2757]  About the end of the reign of the Emperor Paul I--that is to say, towards the middle of the first year of the nineteenth century--just as four o'clock in the afternoon was sounding from the church of St.  Peter and St. Paul, whose gilded vane overlooks the ramparts of the fortress, a crowd, composed of all sorts and conditions of people, began to gather in front of a house which belonged to General Count Tchermayloff, formerly military governor of a fair-sized town in the government of Pultava.  The first spectators had been attracted by the preparations which they saw had been made in the middle of the courtyard for administering torture with the knout.  One of the general's serfs, he who acted as barber, was to be the victim.  Although this kind of punishment was a common enough sight in St. Petersburg, it nevertheless attracted all passers-by when it was publicly administered.  This was the occurrence which had caused a crowd, as just mentioned, before General Tchermayloff's house.

Although in some respects more technical in their subjects and style than Darwin’s “Journal,” the books here reprinted will never lose their value and interest for the originality of the observations they contain. Many parts of them are admirably adapted for giving an insight into problems regarding the structure and changes of the earth’s surface, and in fact they form a charming introduction to physical geology and physiography in their application to special domains. The books themselves cannot be obtained for many times the price of the present volume, and both the general reader, who desires to know more of Darwin’s work, and the student of geology, who naturally wishes to know how a master mind reasoned on most important geological subjects, will be glad of the opportunity of possessing them in a convenient and cheap form.  The three introductions, which my friend Professor Judd has kindly furnished, give critical and historical information which makes this edition of special value.  G.T.B.

GEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON SOUTH AMERICA     CRITICAL INTRODUCTION.   Of the remarkable “trilogy” constituted by Darwin’s writings which deal with the geology of the “Beagle,” the member which has perhaps attracted least attention, up to the present time is that which treats of the geology of South America. The actual writing of this book appears to have occupied Darwin a shorter period than either of the other volumes of the series; his diary records that the work was accomplished within ten months, namely, between July 1844 and April 1845; but the book was not actually issued till late in the year following, the preface bearing the date “September 1846.” Altogether, as Darwin informs us in his “Autobiography,” the geological books “consumed four and a half years’ steady work,” most of the remainder of the ten years that elapsed between the return of the “Beagle,” and the completion of his geological books being, it is sad to relate, “lost through illness!”  Concerning the “Geological Observations on South America,” Darwin wrote to his friend Lyell, as follows:—“My volume will be about 240 pages, dreadfully dull, yet much condensed. I think whenever you have time to look through it, you will think the collection of facts on the elevation of the land and on the formation of terraces pretty good.”  “Much condensed” is the verdict that everyone must endorse, on rising from the perusal of this remarkable book; but by"]]]
