Answer this question first,\" says my good reader.  \"If it be a fair one, I will.\"  \"Was, then, the obnoxious mode of collecting the tax the sole cause of discontent:  or was the tax itself (two pounds for three months) objected to at the same time?\"  \"I think the practical miner, who had been hard at work night and day, for the last four or six months, and, after all, had just bottomed a shicer, objected to the tax itself, because he could not possibly afford to pay it. And was it not atrocious to confine this man in the lousy lock-up at the Camp, because he had no luck?\"  Allow me, now, in return, to put a very important question, of the old Roman stamp, 'Cui bono?' that is, Where did our licence money go to? That's a nut which will be positively cracked by-and-bye.     Chapter XIII.    Ubi Caro, Ibi Vultures.   One morning, I woke all on a sudden.--What's up?  A troop of horse galloping exactly towards my tent, and I could hear the tramping of a band of traps. I got out of the stretcher, and hastened out of my tent.  All the neighbours, in night-caps and unmentionables, were groping round the tents, to inquire what was the matter.  It was not yet day-light.  There was a sly-grog seller at the top of the hill; close to his store he had a small tent, crammed with brandy cases and other grog, newly come up from town.  There must have been a spy, who had scented such valuable game.  The Commissioner asked the storekeeper, who by this time was at the door of his store:  \"Whose tent is that?\" indicating the small one in question.  \"I don't know,\" was the answer.  \"Who lives in it? who owns it? is anybody in?\" asked the Commissioner.  \"An old man owns it, but he is gone to town on business, and left it to the care of his mate who is on the nightshift,\" replied the storekeeper.  \"I won't peck up that chaff of yours, sir.  Halloo! who is in?  Open the tent;\" shouted the Commissioner.  No answer.  \"I say, cut down this tent, and we'll see who is in;\" was the order of the Commissioner to two ruffianly looking troopers.  No sooner said than done; and the little tent was ripped up by their swords. A government cart was, of course, ready in the gully below, and in less than five minutes the whole stock of grog, some two hundred pounds sterling worth, or five hundred pounds worth in nobblers, was carted up to the Camp, before the teeth of some hundreds of diggers, who had now collected round about.  We cried \"Shame! shame!\" sulkily enough, but we did not interfere; first, because the store had already annoyed us often enough during the long winter nights; second, because the plunderers were such Vandemonian-looking traps and troopers, that we were not encouraged to say much, because it would have been of no use.  As soon, however, as the sun was up, and all hands were going to work, the occurrence not only increased the discontent that had been brewing fast enough already, but it rose to excitement; and such a state of exasperated feelings, however vented in the shouting of 'Joe,' did certainly not prepare the Eureka boys to submit with patience to a licence-hunt in the course of the day.  First and foremost:  it is impossible to prevent the sale of spirits on the diggings; and not any laws, fines, or punishment the government may impose on the dealers or consumers can have an effect towards putting a stop to sly-grog selling.  A miner working, as during the past winter, in wet and cold, must and will have his nobbler occasionally; and very necessary, too, I think.  No matter what the cost, he will have it; and it cannot be dispensed with, if he wish to preserve his health:  he won't go to the Charley Napier Hotel, when he can get his nobbler near-handy, and thereby give a lift to Pat or Scotty.  Secondly:  I hereby assert that the breed of spies in this colony prospered by this sly-grog selling.  \"We want money,\" says some of the 'paternals' at Toorak.  \"Oh! well, then,\" replies another at Ballaarat, \"come down on a few storekeepers and unlicensed miners and raise the wind.  We can manage a thousand or two that way.  Let the blood-hounds on the scent, and it is done.\"  And so a scoundrel, in the disguise of an honest man, takes with him another worse devil than himself, and goes round like a roaring lion, seeking what he may devour.  If I had half the fifty pounds fine inflicted on sly-grog sellers, and five pounds fine on unlicensed diggers, raised on Ballaarat at this time, I think my fellow-colonists would bow their heads before me.  Great works!  Thirdly:  An act of silver and gold lace humanity was going the rounds of our holes, above and below.  A person is found in an insensible state, caused by loss of blood, having fallen, by accident, on a broken bottle and cut an artery in his head. He is conveyed to the Camp hospital.  After some few hours, because he raves from loss of blood, and at a time when he requires the closest attention, he is unceremoniously carried into the common lock-up, and there left, it is said, for ten hours, lying on the floor, without any attention being paid to his condition by the hospital authorities, and then it was only by repeated representations of his sinking state, to other officials, that he was conveyed to the hospital, where he expired in two hours afterwards!  \"Below!\"  \"Haloo!\"  \"Jim; the miners of Ballaarat demand an investigation.\"  \"And they must have it, Joe.\"  Such was the scene in those days, performed at every shaft, in Gravel-pits, as well as on the Eureka.     Chapter XIV.    Flagitur Vulcano Si Fulmina Parata.   Here is a short resume of events which led to the popular demonstration on Tuesday, October 17th, 1854.  Two men, old friends, named Scobie and Martin, after many years separation, happened to meet each other in Ballaarat.  Joy at the meeting, led them to indulge in a wee drop for 'Auld lang Syne.'  In this state of happy feeling, they call at the Eureka Hotel, on their way home, intending to have a finishing glass.  They knock at the door, and are refused admittance, very properly, on account of their drunkenness.  They leave, and proceed on their way, not, perhaps without the usual colonial salutations. At about fifty yards from the hotel, they hear a noise behind them, and retrace their steps.  They are met by persons, unknown, who inflict blows on them, which render one insensible and the other lifeless.  A coroner's inquest was held on the body, the verdict of which was, \"that deceased had died from injuries inflicted by persons unknown;\" but public feeling seemed to point to Mr. Bentley, the proprietor of the Eureka Hotel; who, together with his wife and another party, were charged with the murder, tried at the police court, and acquitted.  The friends of deceased, considering that both the inquest and the trial were unfairly conducted, agreed to meet on Tuesday, October 17th, on the spot where the man was murdered, and devise measures to discover the guilty parties, and to bring them to justice.  Accordingly, at an early hour, the hill on which is situated the Eureka Hotel was thronged by thousands; so great was the excitement.  THOMAS KENNEDY, was naturally enough the lion of the day.  A thick head, bold, but bald, the consequence perhaps not of his dissipation; but of his worry in by gone days.  His merit consists in the possession of the chartist slang; hence his cleverness in spinning, a yarn never to the purpose, but blathered with long phrases and bubbling with cant.  He took up the cause of the diggers, not so much for the evaporation of his gaseous heroism, as eternally to hammer on the unfortunate death of his country-man Scobie, for the sake of 'auld lang syne.'  When pressed by the example of others to burn his license, at the subsequent monster meeting, he had none to burn, because he had a wife and four children dependent on him for support, and therefore I do not know what to say further.  These and other resolutions were carried unanimously:-  \"That this meeting, not being satisfied with the manner in which the proceedings connected with the death of the late James Scobie, have been conducted, either by the magistrates or by the coroner, pledges itself to use every lawful means to have the case brought before other, and more competent authorities.  \"That this meeting deems it necessary to collect subscriptions for the purpose of offering a reward for the conviction of the murderers, and defraying all other expenses connected with the prosecution of the case.\"     Chapter XV.    Nam Tua Res Agitur, Paries Cum Proximus Ardet.   The one pervading opinion among the multitude of miners and others who had been attracted thither, appeared to be that Bentley was the murderer; and loud were the cries, the hooting, and groans against him.  It would appear that the Camp authorities contemplated some little disturbance, and consequently all the available force of police and mounted troopers were on guard at the hotel and made a very injudicious display of their strength.  Not only did they follow, but ride through, the crowd of people at the meeting; and it is to this display of their strength that must be attributed the fire, and other outbursts of indignation.  Miners who have stood the working of a Canadian or Gravel-pit shicer, scorn danger in any form.  The crowd, excessively irritated on seeing the large display of the hated police force began to shout and yell.  Presently, a stone came from the mass, and passing near the head of one of the officials, broke a pane of glass in one of the windows of the hotel.  The sound of the falling glass appeared to act like magic on the multitude; and bottles, stones, sticks, and other missiles, were speedily put in requisition to demolish the windows, until not a single pane was left entire, while every one that was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3546"],["title","The Eureka Stockade (#5)"],["body","drew a cheer from the crowd.  The police, all this time, were riding round and round the hotel, but did not take any vigorous measures to deter the people from the sport they appeared to enjoy so much.  The crowd advance nearer--near enough to use sticks to beat in the casements.  They make an entrance, and, in a moment, furniture, wearing apparel, bedding, drapery, are tossed out of the windows; curtains, sheets, etc., are thrown in the air, frightening the horses of the troopers, who have enough to do to keep their saddles; the weather-boards are ripped off the side of the house, and sent spinning in the air.  A real Californian takes particular care of, and delights in smashing the crockery.  Mr. Rede, the resident Commissioner, arrives, and endeavours to pacify the people by speechifying, but it will not do.  He mounts the sill of where was once a window, and gesticulates to the crowd to hear him.  An egg is thrown from behind a tent opposite, and narrowly misses his face, but breaks on the wall of the house close to him.  The Commissioner becomes excited, and orders the troopers to take the man in charge; but no trooper appears to relish the business.  A cry of \"Fire!\" is raised; a horse shies and causes commotion.  Smoke is seen to issue from one of the rooms of the ground-floor.  The police extinguish it; and an attempt is made to form a cordon round the building.  But it is too late.  Whilst the front of the hotel occupies the attention of the majority of the crowd, a few are pulling down the back premises.  Mr. Rede sends for the detachment of the gallant 40th now stationed on Ballaarat.  A shout is raised:--\"The 40th are coming.\"  \"Don't illuminate till they come.\"  \"They shall see the sight.\"  \"Wait till they come.\"  Smash go the large lamps in front of the hotel.  The troopers ride round and caracole their horses.  \"Where's the red-coats?\"  \"There they come, yonder up the hill!\"  \"Hurrah! three cheers.\"  The 40th arrive; they form into line in front of the hotel, swords drawn. \"Hurrah! boys! no use waiting any longer.\"--\"Down she comes.\" The bowling alley is on fire.--Police try to extinguish the flames--rather too warm.--It's too late.--The hotel is on fire at the back corner; nothing can save it.--\"Hip, hip hurrah!\" is the universal shout.  I had opportunities enough to observe in London, that a characteristic of the British race is to make fun of the calamity of fire, hence I did not wonder, how they enjoyed this, their real sport on the occasion.  A gale of wind, which blowed at this exact time, announcing the hurricane that soon followed, was the principal helper to the devouring of the building, by blowing in the direction most favourable to the purpose.  The red-coats wheel about, and return to the Camp.  Look out! the roof of the back part of the hotel, falls in!  \"Hurrah! boys, here's the porter and ale with the chill off.\"  Bottles are handed out burning hot--the necks of two bottles are knocked together!--Contents drunk in colonial style.--Look out! the roof, sides and all fall in!--An enormous mass of flame and smoke arises with a roaring sound.--Sparks are carried far, far into the air, and what was once the Eureka Hotel, is now a mass of burning embers!  The entire diggings, in a state of extreme excitement.--The diggers are lords and masters of Ballaarat; and the prestige of the Camp is gone for ever.     Chapter XVI.    Loquar In Amaritudine Animoe.  Meoe   Now my peace of mind being destroyed, I had recourse to the free British press, for information, wishing to hear what they said in Melbourne.  At this time the Morning Herald was in good demand; but the 'Geelong Advertiser' had the swayn on the goldfields.  Geelong had a rattling correspondent on Ballaarat, who helped to hasten the movement fast enough.  As I did not know this correspondent of the 'Geelong Advertiser' personally, so I can only guess at his frame of mind.  I should say the following ingredients entered into the factory of his ideas:-  1st.  The land is the Lord's and all therein; but man must earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.  Therefore, in the battle of life, every man must fight his way on the old ground, \"help yourself and God will help you.\"  2nd.  In olden times, wherever there was a Roman there was life.  In our times, wherever there is a Britain there is trade, and trade is life.  But with the lazy,--who, either proud or mean, is always an incapable, because generally he is a drunkard, and therefore a beggar, there is no possible barter; and, inasmuch as man does not live on bread alone, for a fried sole is a nice thing for breakfast, so also it must be confessed that the loaves and fishes do not condescend to jump into one's mouth all dressed as they ought to be.  Therefore--and this is the zenith of the 'Geelong Advertiser's' practical correspondent--be not perplexed, if the loaves and fishes wont pop fast enough into your mouth particularly; let Mahomed's example be instantly followed:  go yourself to the loaves and fishes, and you will actually find that they are subject to the same laws of matter and motion as everything else on earth.  3rd.  The application.  For what did any one emigrate to this colony? To sweat more?  Well, times were hard enough for the poor in old Europe. Let him sweat more, but for whom?  For himself of course, and good luck to him. Is there not plenty of Victoria land for every white man or black man that intends to grow his potatoes?  Oh! leave the greens-growing to the well-disposed, to the well affected, ye sturdy sons who pant after the yellow-boy.  \"Take your chance, out of a score of shicers, there is one 'dead on it,'\" says old Mother Earth from the deep.  Sum total.--With the hard-working gold-digger, there is a solid barter possible.  Hurrah! for the diggers.  'The Argus' persisting in 'our own conceit,' and misrepresenting, perverting, and slandering the cause of the diggers, ran foul, and went fast to leeward. Experience having instructed me at my own costs, that there cannot possibly exist much sympathy between flunkies and blueshirts, I can only guess at the compound materials hammered in the mortar of 'The Argus' reporter on Ballaarat:--  lst.  The land is the Queen's, and the inheritance of the Crown.  2nd.  Who dares to teach the golden-lace the idea how to shoot?  3rd.  Let learning, commerce, even manners die, But leave us our old nobility.  4th.  'Sotto voce':--In this colony, however, make money; honestly if possible, of course, but make money; or else the 'vagabonds' here would humble down a gentleman to curry-powder diet.  5th.  To put on a blue shirt, and rush in with the Eureka mob! fudge: 'odi profanum vulgus et arceo.'  There are millions of tons of gold dug out already, as much anyhow, as anyone can carry to Old England, and live as a lord, with an occasional trip to Paris and Naples, to make up for the time wasted in this colony.  Sum total.--Screw out of the diggers as much as circumstances will admit; they have plenty of money for getting drunk, and making beasts of themselves, the brutes!  To be serious; should a copy of this book be forgotten somewhere, and thereby be spared for the use of some southern Tacitus, let him bewail the perfidious mendacity of our times, whose characteristic is SLANDER, which proceeds from devil GROG; and the pair generate THE PROSPERITY OF THE WICKED. Here is a sample:-  On Saturday, September 29th, 1854, the members of the Local Court, Ballaarat, held a public meeting on the usual spot, Bakery-hill, for the purpose of taking the sense of their fellow miners, respecting the admittance or nonadmittance of the legal profession to advise or plead in said court.-- See report in The Star, a new local paper, No. V, Tuesday, October 2nd.  Messrs. Ryce and Wall having addressed the meeting in their usual honest, matter-of-fact way:-   \"Great Works\" was shouted and immediately appeared C. Raffaello, member of the Local Court.  He hoped, that if there were any Goodenough present that they would see and not mislay their notes while he briefly brought three things before the meeting; the first concerned the meeting and himself, the second concerned himself, and the third concerned those present. The first was easily disposed of--have I, as I promised, done my duty as member of the Local Court to your satisfaction? (Yes, and cheers.) Very well, the second matter concerns myself--personally he was under no obligations to the lawyers--the services he received at the trial was done to him as a state prisoner, and not to Carboni Raffaello individually; when individually, he requested to be supplied with six pennyworth of snuff by Mr. Dunne, it was promised, but it never came to him.  It would not have cost much to have supplied him, and it would have greatly obliged him, as habit had rendered snuff-taking necessary to him. With the permission of those present he would take a pinch now.  (He took a pinch amidst laughter and cheers.)  The admission of lawyers into the Local Court would give rise to endless feuds, where valuable interests were concerned, and so much time would be lost in useless litigation.  As he had no wish through any personal obligation to see the lawyers in the Local Court, and as he considered that it was for the advantage of the miners that they should not be admitted, he opposed their entrance.  The third matter concerned those present.  What did they come to Australia for?  Why, to improve their prospects in reality, though on shipboard they might say it was to get rid of the 'governor,' or to get clear of an ugly wife, and now that you are here are you to allow the Ballaarat lawyers to fleece you of your hard earnings?  Not being fond of yabber-yabber he would simply ask:  are you fairly represented by us?  (Yes, yes.) If so then support us, and if we do not represent you we will resign.  Don't say yes if you don't mean it, for I do not like yabber-yabber.   I beg to assert, that the above report"]]]
