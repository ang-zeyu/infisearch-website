The following facts related by actual witnesses will not therefore appear incredible.  Before the Mormons settled in the vicinity, no shop for the sale of spirituous liquors had been established in Montrose. After their arrival two of their preachers commenced a grog-shop in that place, which was principally supported by the \"Latter-day Saints.\" In September 1841, the prophet being in Montrose, became intoxicated at this shop. While in this condition he told the by-standers \"that he could drink them all drunk,\" and requested the shop-keeper to treat all his friends at his expense.  On another occasion, having been discharged from arrest, through informality in the writ requiring his apprehension for high treason against the State of Missouri, Smith gave a party at Monmouth, and, after a regular frolic with his lawyers and friends, became thoroughly intoxicated. On being asked how it was that he, a prophet of the Lord, could get drunk, he replied, that it was necessary that he should do so, in order to prevent his followers from worshipping him as a God.  While intoxicated at Montrose, at another time, he was heard by several persons saying to himself, \"I am a P.R.O.F.I.T. I am a P.R.O.F.I.T.\"--spelling (or rather mis-spelling) the word deliberately, and repeating the letters in solemn succession.  About two years since, at a political convention held in Nauvoo, the prophet became intoxicated, and was led home by his brother Hyrum. On the following Sunday, he acknowledged the fact in public. He said that he had been tempted, and had drunk too much; but that he had yielded to the temptation for the following reason:--Several of the elders had got drunk, and had never made confession; but he was desirous of getting drunk and confessing it, in order to set the elders a good example.  The language of the prophet is gross in the extreme. A Mormon, for example, having made some remarks derogatory to \"the elect lady,\" Mrs. Smith, the prophet was dreadfully exasperated. He endeavoured to find out the name of the offender; but, being unable to do so, he alluded to the subject in a sermon, preached in the open air, at Montrose, on the 9th of May, 1841. He said, \"I hope I may never find out that person; for if I do, my appetite shall never be satisfied till I have his blood; and if he ever crosses my threshold I will send him to hell.\"  I have already stated some circumstances which may appear to reflect on the common honesty of some of the Mormons. Mr. K. mentioned that he had lived five years among heathen Indians, and had never been robbed by them of the most trifling article. During the three years which have elapsed since the settlement of the Mormons at Montrose and Nauvoo, _fourteen robberies_, to the amount of two thousand dollars, have been committed upon his property. 1st, His store was robbed of goods worth five hundred dollars; 2nd, his warehouse was plundered of one barrel of pork, two barrels of sugar, and five kegs of lard; 3rd, his smoke-house was despoiled of thirty-three hams and eleven shoulders; the 4th robbery deprived him of a barrel and a half of salt; the 5th, of another barrel of salt; the 6th, of a saddle, bridle, and martingale, which were taken from his stable; 7thly, four wheels were taken from his waggon; 8thly, three saddles and bridles and a martingale from his stable; 9thly, sixty bushels of wheat from his granary; 10thly, six boxes of glass, a hundred and fifty pounds of bacon, and two boxes of axes, from his warehouse; 11th, six more barrels of salt; 12th, between three and four hundred bushels of Indian corn; 13th, one wheel was stolen from his chariot within an enclosure; and, 14th, his store was robbed of forty-two pieces of dark prints, five or six pieces of satinette, and other articles, worth about four hundred dollars.  Joseph Smith, alluding to these robberies in a sermon, said that he \"did not care how much was taken from Mr. K. and his brother.\" He cited the example of Christ and his apostles, who, he said, when hungry, scrupled not to steal corn while walking in the fields. He added the following words,--\"The world owes me a good living; if I cannot get it otherwise, I will steal it, and catch me at it if you can.\"  He has, however, thought fit to disavow these principles. In the \"Times and Seasons\" of Dec. 1, 1841, we have the following official document:    \"State of Illinois, } SS.   Hancock County.     }  \"Before me, John C. Bennett, Mayor of the City of Nauvoo, personally came Joseph Smith, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (commonly called Mormons), who, being duly sworn according to law, deposeth and saith, that he has never, directly or indirectly, encouraged the purloining of property, or taught the doctrine of stealing, or any other evil practice; and that all such vile and unlawful acts will ever receive his unqualified and unreserved disapproval, and the most vigorous opposition of the Church over which he presides; and further this deponent saith not.    \"JOSEPH SMITH,    \"President of the Church of Latter-day   Saints.\"  After this follows an account of two unlucky Mormons, who seem to be selected as scape-goats. Being officers of the Nauvoo legion, they are tried by court martial, found guilty of theft, and sentenced to be cashiered. Joseph Smith solemnly approves of this sentence, and the proceedings are published in the \"Times and Seasons.\" About the same time, five Mormons are gazetted as being expelled from the church for larceny.  The following circumstance was mentioned as a specimen of the manner in which these singular heretics endeavour to rid themselves of the imputation of thievishness universally cast upon them. In the winter of 1841, a Mormon was committed to the penitentiary on a charge of horse-stealing. Upon this, the \"Saints\" denied that he was a Mormon. Two Mormon preachers, however, offered themselves as bail for the prisoner, and having effected his liberation, speedily decamped. When the spring session of the court of Lee County for 1842 had arrived, it appeared that the accused had followed their example, for neither he nor his securities were to be found.  The sufferings experienced by many of the English emigrants at Nauvoo were described as truly appalling. Nauvoo is one of the most unhealthy spots on the Mississippi, between New Orleans and the Falls of St. Anthony. This insalubrity is produced by the low islands adjoining the city, which are frequently overflowed. Sufficient evidence of the unhealthiness of the place is furnished in the following extract from a \"revelation given to Joseph Smith, January 19th, 1841,\" and published in the \"Times and Seasons\" for June 1st, 1841:  \"Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant, Joseph Smith,--I am well pleased with your offerings and acknowledgements which you have made; for unto this end have I raised you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth. * * * * * Let no man go from this place who has come here _a_ssaying to keep my commandments. If they live here, let them live unto me, and if they die, let them die unto me; for they shall rest from all their labour here, and shall continue their works. Therefore, let my servant William put his trust in me, and cease to fear concerning his family, because of the sickness of the land. If ye love me, keep my commandments, and the sickness of the land shall redound to your glory.\"  I was informed again and again in Montrose, that nearly half of the English who emigrated to Nauvoo in 1841 died soon after their arrival. Far from the graves of their fathers, remote from the ministers of the true faith, they ended their days in want and wretchedness, and were buried without that respectful solemnity which in England is not denied even to the pauper from the workhouse.  In his sermon of the 9th of May, 1841, the following words of _most Christian consolation_ were delivered by the prophet to the poor deluded English.  \"Many of the English who have lately come here have expressed great disappointment on their arrival. Such persons have every reason to be satisfied in this beautiful and fertile country. If they choose to complain, they may; but I don't want to be troubled with their complaints. If they are not satisfied here, I have only to say this to them,--Don't stay whining about me, but go back to England and be d--d.\"  One of Joseph's missionaries, having returned from a mission to England, preached a sermon at Nauvoo on Sunday, July 4th, 1840. Having given an account of his proceedings during his absence, and alluded to the converts whom he had persuaded to settle near Nauvoo, he proceeded to speak as follows:--\"I have not had an opportunity to visit these English brethren since my return. I cannot spend my time in visiting them. If they are as much dissatisfied as they are said to be, I have only this to say to them,--You had better go back to England; but if you go, go like men and be d--d, and don't whine about it.\"  The Secretary for the territory of Iowa was present on this occasion, and remarked to my informant, that he was astonished at hearing these expressions from the very man who had brought these poor people a distance of six thousand miles.  The method in which the Mormons baptize is a perfect burlesque on the holy initiatory sacrament of the gospel. On one occasion, a hundred and sixty-five persons were baptized by immersion at Nauvoo, some for the remission of sins, and some for their deceased friends, which is their baptism for the dead. This business was done by seven elders, who enjoyed it as a capital frolic. One of these elders baptized a woman six times during the same day. Not satisfied with this, she presented herself a seventh time, when the elder jocosely remarked, \"What! haven't you got wet enough already?\" A very tall man offering himself, the elder, who is very"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36499"],["title","Rounding up the Raider: A Naval Story of the Great War (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Cover art]      [Frontispiece: DENBIGH AND HIS COMPANIONS ARE RESCUED BY A MONITOR _Page_ 207.  _Frontispiece_]      ROUNDING UP  THE RAIDER   A Naval Story of the Great War    BY  PERCY F.

The three chums had just been reading the \"miles made good\" announcement that, printed in English and Japanese, was daily exhibited in various parts of S.S. _Nichi Maru_.  \"Hostile submarines permitting,\" remarked Denbigh with a laugh, after he had taken good care that no lady passengers were within earshot.  \"Rot!\" ejaculated Stirling.  \"We've cleared them out of the Channel pretty well.  It's part of the work of the British Navy under----\"  \"Stop it!\" interrupted O'Hara good-humouredly.  \"I know what you were going to say: that old tag from the Articles of War.  I propose that every time the word submarine is mentioned by anyone of us while on board this vessel the delinquent shall be suitably punished as soon as the sun's over the fore-yard.\"  \"Hear, hear!  I second that,\" agreed Stirling.  \"No more 'shop'.  We'll get plenty of that in a few weeks' time.  I fancy My Lords won't let us kick our heels in idleness for long, and honestly, the sooner we settle down to business the better.\"  The three chums were Sub-lieutenants, homeward bound from a portion of a certain group of islands off the coast of New Guinea, having till recently the high-sounding title of the Bismarck Archipelago.  The youthful but none the less glorious Australian Navy had quickly changed the colour of that portion of the map, but the climate was a more formidable foe than the former German garrison.  Thus the three young officers, who had been \"lent\" to the recently-formed navy, had the misfortune to be stricken with fever.  After a long convalescence, which by a pure coincidence lasted almost exactly the same time in each of the three cases, Denbigh, Stirling, and O'Hara were ordered to return to England and to resume their duties with the navy of the Motherland.  They had travelled by an intermediate boat to Singapore, whence, in order to save delay, they had proceeded by a Japanese liner, the _Nichi Maru_, bound from Nagasaki to London.  It was a case of misdirected zeal, for, owing to the torpedoing of a large Japanese liner in the Mediterranean, the _Nichi Maru_ had been ordered to take the longer passage round the Cape instead of the usual route via the Suez Canal.  \"Hulloa!  What's the excitement?\" enquired Denbigh, pointing in the direction of the bridge.  The chums had gained the promenade deck, whence most of the navigating bridge of the liner could be seen.  There was evidently something to warrant his exclamation, for the dapper little Japanese officer of the watch was steadily keeping his binoculars upon some distant object.  \"There's a smudge of smoke away to the nor'east'ard,\" announced Stirling.  \"The mild excitement of sighting a vessel will help to push the hands of the clock.  Now if someone will kindly suggest a sweepstake on the nationality of yonder craft----\"  The door of the wireless room opened.  The sharp peculiar cackle of the instruments announced that an exchange of messages was in progress.  A messenger made his way to the bridge.  Almost immediately after, the captain hurried from his cabin.  Evidently \"something was in the wind\", for the appearance of the imperturbable commander of the _Nichi Maru_ at this time of day was rather unusual.  \"We're altering helm,\" declared O'Hara after a brief interval.  \"Since we can speak with that vessel without the necessity of having to close, it points to something of the nature of a serious mishap.\"  The rest of the passengers were now making their way on deck.  By an inexplicable intuition the presence of the still invisible vessel had made itself felt.  None of the officers had communicated the news that the _Nichi Maru_ was in touch with another craft, yet in five minutes the decks were crowded with a medley of Europeans and Asiatics.  \"Do you know what is wrong, sir?\" asked Denbigh, addressing one of the Japanese officers who happened to be making his way aft.  The Jap shook his head.  Like most of the _Nichi Maru's_ officers he spoke English.  The question was plain to him, but with Oriental reticence he politely evaded it.  \"I'll get my glasses,\" announced O'Hara.  \"And mine, while you are about it,\" said Denbigh.  \"And mine, too,\" added the Scot.  O'Hara quickly returned with the desired articles.  Bringing their binoculars to bear upon the smudge on the horizon the three Subs made the discovery that there was a two-masted, three-funnelled vessel lying apparently hove-to.  Smoke was issuing from her after-funnel in dense clouds, that rose slowly in the still sultry air.  \"She's flying an ensign,\" remarked the Irishman.  \"Yes, straight up and down like a wet dishclout,\" added Stirling.  \"For all the good it's doing it needn't be there.\"  \"Perhaps her propeller shaft is broken,\" suggested one of the passengers, an English merchant who had given up a good position in Tokio to return home in order to \"do his bit\".  \"Hardly,\" replied Denbigh.  \"She's bound to be a twin screw, and it isn't likely that both engines would break down.\"  \"I don't know so much about that,\" said O'Hara, pointing aft, where a crowd of Japanese seamen were engaged in preparing a large flexible steel hawser.  \"It looks as if we were going to take her in tow.  And it's a long, long way to Las Palmas, worse luck.\"  \"She's a Dutchman,\" declared Stirling.  \"I can make out the red, white, and blue ensign.  I wouldn't mind betting she's one of the Rotterdam and Batavia liners.\"  The three British officers relapsed into silence, devoting their whole attention upon the disabled liner which was now momentarily looming larger and larger as the _Nichi Maru_ hastened to her aid.  Presently the engine-room telegraph bell clanged and the Japanese vessel's engines began to slow down.  Two of the boats were swung out ready to be lowered, while the four ship's surgeons stood by, ready to be taken to the helpless Dutchman.  \"Bad boiler-room accident,\" exclaimed one of the European passengers, who had learnt the news from a Japanese petty-officer.  \"Boiler accident be hanged!\" ejaculated Denbigh, excitedly.  \"We're done in, you fellows.  That vessel's no Dutchman.\"  As if in confirmation of the Sub's announcement the tricolour of Holland was smartly lowered, its place being taken by that shame-faced and palpable imitation of the good old British White Ensign--the Black Cross of Germany.  Simultaneously portions of the vessel's plating swung outboard, revealing a battery of six fifteen-centimetre Krupp guns.  \"_Nichi Maru_, ahoy!\" shouted a guttural voice in English, for the two vessels were now within megaphone-hailing distance.  \"Surrender instantly, or we send you to the bottom.\"  There was a pause, while the officer who had shouted the message was being prompted.  \"Make no attempt to use your wireless,\" he continued.  \"That will not save you.  It will make things very bad for"]]]
