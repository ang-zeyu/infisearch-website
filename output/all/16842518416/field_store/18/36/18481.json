Belief in the unreality of the world of sense arises with irresistible force in certain moods--moods which, I imagine, have some simple physiological basis, but are none the less powerfully persuasive. The conviction born of these moods is the source of most mysticism and of most metaphysics. When the emotional intensity of such a mood subsides, a man who is in the habit of reasoning will search for logical reasons in favour of the belief which he finds in himself. But since the belief already exists, he will be very hospitable to any reason that suggests itself. The paradoxes apparently proved by his logic are really the paradoxes of mysticism, and are the goal which he feels his logic must reach if it is to be in accordance with insight. It is in this way that logic has been pursued by those of the great philosophers who were mystics--notably Plato, Spinoza, and Hegel. But since they usually took for granted the supposed insight of the mystic emotion, their logical doctrines were presented with a certain dryness, and were believed by their disciples to be quite independent of the sudden illumination from which they sprang. Nevertheless their origin clung to them, and they remained--to borrow a useful word from Mr Santayana--\"malicious\" in regard to the world of science and common sense. It is only so that we can account for the complacency with which philosophers have accepted the inconsistency of their doctrines with all the common and scientific facts which seem best established and most worthy of belief.  The logic of mysticism shows, as is natural, the defects which are inherent in anything malicious. While the mystic mood is dominant, the need of logic is not felt; as the mood fades, the impulse to logic reasserts itself, but with a desire to retain the vanishing insight, or at least to prove that it _was_ insight, and that what seems to contradict it is illusion. The logic which thus arises is not quite disinterested or candid, and is inspired by a certain hatred of the daily world to which it is to be applied. Such an attitude naturally does not tend to the best results. Everyone knows that to read an author simply in order to refute him is not the way to understand him; and to read the book of Nature with a conviction that it is all illusion is just as unlikely to lead to understanding. If our logic is to find the common world intelligible, it must not be hostile, but must be inspired by a genuine acceptance such as is not usually to be found among metaphysicians.  Traditional logic, since it holds that all propositions have the subject-predicate form, is unable to admit the reality of relations: all relations, it maintains, must be reduced to properties of the apparently related terms. There are many ways of refuting this opinion; one of the easiest is derived from the consideration of what are called \"asymmetrical\" relations. In order to explain this, I will first explain two independent ways of classifying relations.  Some relations, when they hold between A and B, also hold between B and A. Such, for example, is the relation \"brother or sister.\" If A is a brother or sister of B, then B is a brother or sister of A. Such again is any kind of similarity, say similarity of colour. Any kind of dissimilarity is also of this kind: if the colour of A is unlike the colour of B, then the colour of B is unlike the colour of A. Relations of this sort are called _symmetrical_. Thus a relation is symmetrical if, whenever it holds between A and B, it also holds between B and A.  All relations that are not symmetrical are called _non-symmetrical_. Thus \"brother\" is non-symmetrical, because, if A is a brother of B, it may happen that B is a _sister_ of A.  A relation is called _asymmetrical_ when, if it holds between A and B, it _never_ holds between B and A. Thus husband, father, grandfather, etc., are asymmetrical relations. So are _before_, _after_, _greater_, _above_, _to the right of_, etc. All the relations that give rise to series are of this kind.  Classification into symmetrical, asymmetrical, and merely non-symmetrical relations is the first of the two classifications we had to consider. The second is into transitive, intransitive, and merely non-transitive relations, which are defined as follows.  A relation is said to be _transitive_, if, whenever it holds between A and B and also between B and C, it holds between A and C. Thus _before_, _after_, _greater_, _above_ are transitive. All relations giving rise to series are transitive, but so are many others. The transitive relations just mentioned were asymmetrical, but many transitive relations are symmetrical--for instance, equality in any respect, exact identity of colour, being equally numerous (as applied to collections), and so on.  A relation is said to be _non-transitive_ whenever it is not transitive. Thus \"brother\" is non-transitive, because a brother of one's brother may be oneself. All kinds of dissimilarity are non-transitive.  A relation is said to be _intransitive_ when, if A has the relation to B, and B to C, A never has it to C. Thus \"father\" is intransitive. So is such a relation as \"one inch taller\" or \"one year later.\"  Let us now, in the light of this classification, return to the question whether all relations can be reduced to predications.  In the case of symmetrical relations--_i.e._ relations which, if they hold between A and B, also hold between B and A--some kind of plausibility can be given to this doctrine. A symmetrical relation which is transitive, such as equality, can be regarded as expressing possession of some common property, while one which is not transitive, such as inequality, can be regarded as expressing possession of different properties. But when we come to asymmetrical relations, such as before and after, greater and less, etc., the attempt to reduce them to properties becomes obviously impossible. When, for example, two things are merely known to be unequal, without our knowing which is greater, we may say that the inequality results from their having different magnitudes, because inequality is a symmetrical relation; but to say that when one thing is _greater_ than another, and not merely unequal to it, that means that they have different magnitudes, is formally incapable of explaining the facts. For if the other thing had been greater than the one, the magnitudes would also have been different, though the fact to be explained would not have been the same. Thus mere _difference_ of magnitude is not _all_ that is involved, since, if it were, there would be no difference between one thing being greater than another, and the other being greater than the one. We shall have to say that the one magnitude is _greater_ than the other, and thus we shall have failed to get rid of the relation \"greater.\" In short, both possession of the same property and possession of different properties are _symmetrical_ relations, and therefore cannot account for the existence of _asymmetrical_ relations.  Asymmetrical relations are involved in all series--in space and time, greater and less, whole and part, and many others of the most important characteristics of the actual world. All these aspects, therefore, the logic which reduces everything to subjects and predicates is compelled to condemn as error and mere appearance. To those whose logic is not malicious, such a wholesale condemnation appears impossible. And in fact there is no reason except prejudice, so far as I can discover, for denying the reality of relations. When once their reality is admitted, all _logical_ grounds for supposing the world of sense to be illusory disappear. If this is to be supposed, it must be frankly and simply on the ground of mystic insight unsupported by argument. It is impossible to argue against what professes to be insight, so long as it does not argue in its own favour. As logicians, therefore, we may admit the possibility of the mystic's world, while yet, so long as we do not have his insight, we must continue to study the everyday world with which we are familiar. But when he contends that our world is impossible, then our logic is ready to repel his attack. And the first step in creating the logic which is to perform this service is the recognition of the reality of relations.  Relations which have two terms are only one kind of relations. A relation may have three terms, or four, or any number. Relations of two terms, being the simplest, have received more attention than the others, and have generally been alone considered by philosophers, both those who accepted and those who denied the reality of relations. But other relations have their importance, and are indispensable in the solution of certain problems. Jealousy, for example, is a relation between three people. Professor Royce mentions the relation \"giving\": when A gives B to C, that is a relation of three terms.[15] When a man says to his wife: \"My dear, I wish you could induce Angelina to accept Edwin,\" his wish constitutes a relation between four people, himself, his wife, Angelina, and Edwin. Thus such relations are by no means recondite or rare. But in order to explain exactly how they differ from relations of two terms, we must embark upon a classification of the logical forms of facts, which is the first business of logic, and the business in which the traditional logic has been most deficient.

A complete description of the existing world would require not only a catalogue of the things, but also a mention of all their qualities and relations.

FITCH and LEWIS L. SANDIDGE   On the 590-acre University of Kansas Natural History Reservation where our study was made, the opossum, _Didelphis marsupialis virginiana_ Kerr, is the largest predatory animal having a permanently resident population. The coyote, raccoon and red fox also occur on the area but each ranges widely, beyond the Reservation boundaries. With the passing nearly a century ago of the larger animals of the original fauna, the buffalo, elk, deer, antelope, wild turkey, gray wolf and others, lesser herbivores and carnivores including the opossum and animals of similar size fell heir to their key positions of predominance at the peak of the food pyramid. These smaller animals, however, exert less powerful effects in controlling the general aspect of the biotic community, and affect it in different directions. The over-all ecology is greatly altered. The flora and fauna both are undergoing successional changes which will continue for a long time and probably will culminate in a biotic community much different from the original climax.  The opossum plays an important part in this process of change; being relatively large, numerous, and of omnivorous habits, it variously influences, directly and indirectly, the populations of its plant and animal associates, through a complex web of interrelationships. Several excellent field- and laboratory-studies of the opossum have been published (Hartman, 1928, 1952; Lay, 1942; Reynolds, 1945; Wiseman and Hendrickson, 1950) and the life history of this remarkable marsupial is already well known. The purpose of our study, therefore, was to gain a better understanding of the ecological relationships of the opossum in the particular region represented by the study area. To accomplish this, we gathered data concerning the animal's responses to climate and varying weather conditions; its annual cycle of breeding, growth and activity, movements, principal food sources, numbers, population turnover, and natural enemies. Although we did gain a somewhat better understanding of the opossum's ecology, results are remarkably meager in proportion to the large amount of time expended. The hours of work daily in setting and tending a line of live-traps ordinarily were rewarded with only a few records, sometimes none. Comparable time and effort directed to the study of smaller and more abundant kinds of animals has been far more productive of data. Field work was carried on in parts of 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1952.     [Illustration: FIGURE 1. Map of the University of Kansas       Natural History Reservation showing locations where opossums       were live-trapped.]  Because opossums are nocturnal and rarely seen in the course of their regular activities, the present study is based mainly on information gained by live-trapping them. Several different sizes of traps of the type described by Fitch (1951) were used. The most successful were 2' ﾗ 8\" ﾗ 8\" in dimensions although many of the larger ones were also used. They were constructed of hardware cloth having a half-inch mesh. Live-trapping was begun in October 1949 by Fitch with a line of about a dozen traps. In the following month Sandidge joined in the field work. The trapping was continued throughout the winter and spring of 1949-1950 and was resumed the following fall and more traps were added from time to time until a maximum line of approximately 60 was attained. Sandidge's participation ended in December, 1950. The live-trapping was continued on a reduced scale by Fitch through the winter and spring of 1951 and some was done sporadically in the fall, winter and spring of 1951 to 1952.  Traps were baited with a variety of foods such as carcasses of small vertebrates, meat scraps, canned dog food, ground horse meat and bacon grease. At each capture, sex, weight, and individual formula of the opossum, based on toe-clipping and ear-clipping (Fitch, 1952), were recorded. Also recorded was the exact site of capture as located in one of 84 divisions of the Reservation and estimated in feet from some named landmark. Notes on breeding condition, pelage, injuries, parasites and general appearance were also taken at the time of capture. For opossums caught in 1951 and 1952, the hind foot measurement was recorded.  Often, attempt was made to follow the released opossum to determine the direction and distance of its homeward travel but this was difficult because of brushy terrain and secretive habits of the animal. An opossum being followed would almost invariably take refuge in a tree if it caught sight of the observer. Other information regarding the animal's habits was obtained from tracks in snow or soft soil and from the distribution and contents of scats. Carcasses of opossums which had fallen victim to predators were found on a few occasions and in some instances clues as to the identity of the predator were obtained. One hundred and seventeen opossums were live-trapped and handled a total of 276 times. Six of these were dead when first found in the traps. The remaining 111 were marked and released. In addition, 207 pouch-young carried by adult females were recorded and 115 of these were individually marked by toe-clipping. Some of the opossums that were marked while in the mother's pouch were subsequently recaptured when they were well-grown, independent young, or adults, affording information on growth and dispersal.     HABITAT   The habitats of the Reservation have been described briefly by Fitch (1952) and by Leonard and Goble (1952). More than half the area consists of steep wooded slopes with mixed second growth forest, consisting of elm, hickory, oak, walnut, ash, honey locust, hackberry and osage orange, in about that order of abundance, with thickets of blackberry, crabapple, wild plum and grape. Fallow fields and pastures of the upland and valley floors alternate with the woodland. The varied habitat provides numerous different food sources. Along the edges of the hilltops there is a nearly continuous limestone outcrop with a lower outcrop paralleling it. These rock ledges, well distributed throughout the area, provide an abundance of den sites and most of the opossums definitely trailed to a home base were found to be utilizing dens in the rock ledges. Two small creeks on the area have some water for most of the year. As compared with wooded bottomland of larger stream courses in Douglas County and those counties adjoining it, the Reservation area probably supports a relatively low population density of opossums. \"Sign\" has been found in much greater abundance in near-by areas supporting a heavier woodland.  Every part of the Reservation is used by opossums, but their activity is concentrated in the woodland, and all dens found were in woodland. Most parts of the fields are within 100 yards of the edge of the woodland and no point is more than 700 feet from the edge. Most of the opossums' foraging in fields was concentrated along the edge; otherwise they tended to follow creeks and gullies and they follow well worn trails more often than they do in the woods. Within the woodland, activity tended to be concentrated along the small streams, and along the rock ledges where den sites were plentiful. Throughout the annual cycle, and from year to year, there were minor shifts in areas of concentrated activity depending on seasonal changes in food sources such as thickets of wild plum, crabapple, blackberry and grape, with fruits ripening at slightly different times of year. The areas adjoining the Reservation offer somewhat similar habitat conditions, part woodland, part pasture land and some cultivated fields with corn or other crops which provide food sources for the opossum.  Under original conditions the area that is now the Reservation probably was marginal habitat for opossums, consisting mainly of open grassland with trees in small and scattered clumps, if indeed they were present at all. There has been steady encroachment of shrubs and trees, originally chiefly confined to near-by bottomlands such as those of the Kaw and Wakarusa valleys. Concurrently, the original hardwood forest of the bottomlands has mostly disappeared, and the land has been taken over for intensive agricultural use. The new upland forest provides a habitat different in many respects from the original bottomland forest. The species composition, in trees and other plants, is somewhat different, with more xeric types, especially on steep south slopes. Logs and large old hollow trees are scarce. The lack of such potential den sites is compensated for by the abundance of holes and crevices along hilltop rock ledges.     BEHAVIOR   Undisturbed opossums were seen in the course of their normal activities on only a few occasions, and behavior is known to us mainly from the sign and from observations made on those that were live-trapped. Ordinarily those taken in live-traps were found curled up in deep sleep from which they did not arouse until touched or until the trap was moved or jarred. Reactions to humans varied greatly in individuals and was not necessarily correlated with age or sex. Adult males were uniformly hostile to the trapper and reacted"]]]
