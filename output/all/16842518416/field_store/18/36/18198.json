so the waggoners & our own party, were oblig'd to lead & pilot us, over the stream & thro' a most shocking place as I ever saw- The men were all very civil- they are waiting      this line is the shape of a Pensylvania waggon--      with                            of us---- We fare          their               the rest                waggons, like  worse & worse, & still M^r W- & his wife, tell us this is nothing to what will come- I do not fully believe them, for we cannot endure much more & live--Susan & young M^{rs} Jackson have been quite unwell all day-- I never felt in better health, & my spirits are pretty good, considering all things-- We are not able to get beds here, & are to sleep on the floor to night- There is another family here, with several little children-- They say there has been a _heap_ of people moving this fall;- I don't know exactly how many a heap is, or a _sight_ either, which is another way of measuring people-- I would be _apt_ to think it was a _terrible_ parcel, to use the language of the people round me---- I have such an enormous appetite the whole time, that I have been in some fear of starving- for food of every kind, is very scarce with us- Money will not procure it, & nothing else I am sure, will- for they love money better than life, if possible-- 4 Sabbaths we have pass'd on the road, & I suppose 2 or 3 more will pass before we get among people who \"remember the sabbath day to keep it holy\"-- We find no books to read, only at the bakers to day I found part of a bible, a methodist hymn book & a small book containing an account of the progress of Methodism throughout the country; in letters from Ministers & others----We left M^r Beach & family, at the tavern we left to day-- I hope tomorrow to write you from a comfortable place 6 or 8 miles at least from the next mountain--  Monday morn- We have now I think met with as bad as can befal us-- Never, never did I pass such a night---- We could get no bed & for a long time expected to be oblig'd to set up all night- but we could get no room nor fire to stay by, & the landlady was so kind as to give up her bed to us; so M^rs W & Susan went to bed there, while I went to bed with M^rs Jackson in another room- I took off my frock & boots, & had scarcely lain down, when one of the wretches came into the room & lay down by me on the outside of the bed- I was frighten'd almost to death & clung to M^{rs} Jackson who did not appear to mind it- & I lay for a quarter of an hour crying, & scolding & trembling, begging of him to leave me-At last, when persuaded I was in earnest, he begg'd of me not to take it amiss, as he intended no harm & only wish'd to become acquainted with me-- A good for nothing brute, I wonder what he suppos'd I was- I don't know of any thought word or action of mine that could give him reason to suppose I would authorise such abominable insolence---- The man & his wife, who are here, & their family, John Jackson & his wife, & M^{rs} Jackson, were all in the room-The moment he left the room, I put on my frock & was going in to M^{rs} W & Susan, but I could not get to them without going thro' the room where all the waggoners were, & M^{rs} Jackson did not think it safe, so I got on another part of the bed where none of them could come near me, & had been there about 10 minutes when M^{rs} W & Susan came into the room both crying, & as much frighten'd as I had been, for one of the creatures had been into their room, & they could scarcely get him out- M^r W- was in the waggon, & the landlord was so afraid of these wag^gs that he did not dare stay in his own house, for they threaten'd to put him into the creek, if he did not continue giving them liquor- I wish they had put him in- a mean sneaking fellow!-- His poor wife was then oblig'd to bear it all, & she was very much distress'd on our account- She was not to blame for any thing that happen'd, for as long as her husband suffer'd it, she could not prevent it-At last M^{rs} W- went to bed with M^{rs} Jackson & me, & Susan lay down with John & his wife- We lay but a few minutes, when one of them came into our room again crawling on his hands & knees- M^{rs} W & I sprung & run out into the mud in our stocking feet & were going to call M^r W.- but the creatures came out to us & begg'd us not to, & pledg'd their honor (of which you may suppose they possess'd a great share) that we should not be disturb'd more- & tenderness for M^r W- who we knew would be sick to day if depriv'd of rest, at length determin'd us to go back; but we did not go to bed again till just morning, when some of us slept nearly or quite an hour- which was every wink of sleep we could obtain during the whole night- The fellows were all but one, very still afterwards- Indeed there was but 2 who made any disturbance, & only one of those was very bad- but one, was a complete child of the evil one- the vilest, worst, most blasphemous wretch, that ever liv'd-- M^r W- came back to the house before 2 oclock, & this morning, threaten'd them with a prosecution- They are quite angry- they are in the employ of this man who is moving; he is a merchant & they carry his goods to Pitts^g--     Nov^{br}-12^{th} Monday night- Nail Shop-on the 4^{th} Mountain   We have got 8-1/2 miles on our journey to day, & now it rains again-- If I could describe to you our troubles from roads, waggoners & creeks, I would,- but it is impossible-- The waggoners set out just before we did & the bad one being foremost has taken all the pains in his power to hinder our progress, by driving as slow as possible & stopping every other moment- The road was too narrow to pass them, unless they would turn out for us- all but one did, but he swore he would not- We came by them as they stopp'd at noon, & put up to night at an inn on the mountain, out of the direct road, where we should peaceably pass the night- but the waggoners have follow'd us, & the house is full- They are not in our room-- Our party now consists of M^{rs} Jackson's, M^r Beach's & M^r W's familys-- The woman who is with M^r Beach, is such a foolish old creature, that we are all out of patience with her----She is aunt to them, I believe---- If I were to choose, I would never have company on a long journey- such company at least- Our chairs here are taken from us for the Waggoners---- Our road over the mountains, has not even a good prospect to render it pleasant-- I have been repeating to Susan all day, \"Comfort damsel &c\"- M^{rs} Jackson is scolding because she has no chair to set on.- M^r W- tells her, \"Fret not thyself because of evil doers\"---- There is another impassable creek a head, & a hundred waggons waiting to cross it- Our prospect brightens fast-dont you think so? good night--     Tuesday eve- Nov- 13^{th}- 4 miles east of Bedford- Penn-   We have at length escap'd the waggoners & Mr Beach- The former did not trouble us last night at all in the night- When we went to bed they watch'd us narrowly, & after we were in bed we heard them talking about us, enquiring of each other where we slept &c- We were in the room with M^r & M^{rs} Wolcott, directly over the room they were in, but still I felt afraid of them- The worst one is quite mad, & says he intends if possible, to give us more trouble than he has done already- The other is quite asham'd of his conduct & I suspect would be willing to make any amends in his power- He told this to M^{rs} Jackson who is much too familiar with them, & I believe it was owing entirely to that, that they conducted so- for the rest of us always avoid even the sight of them, as much as possible; & much more any conversation with them-- We got up very early indeed & set out before breakfast, because the horses could have no hay, & we have got quite out of their reach--We cross'd a little stream call'd the Juniaatta- I spell the names as they are pronounced, but I do not spell them right, I am sure, nor can I find out how they are spelt many of them- The river is long & narrow- It takes a winding course thro' the mountains, & is a very pretty stream-- We rode some distance on its banks, & the road been tolerable, it would have been pleasant- I have said so much about the badness of the roads that you will hardly believe me when I tell you we seen some of the worst to day we have ever found- & some, as good as any in this state---- I should not have suppos'd it possible for any thing to pass it- M^{rs} W said it seem'd like going into the lower regions, but I had always an idea, that road was smooth & easy- I am sure if it was as bad as that, it would have fewer travellers-We went down however till we came to a lower region-It was really awful-- We saw some men to day, mending the roads- I did not think a Pennsylvanian ever touch'd a road or made a bridge, for we are oblig'd to ride thro' every stream we come to-We have been nearly 20 miles to day; & have been oblig'd to walk up hill, till we are all very tir'd- I felt too much so to write, but I am unwilling to omit it- We are now, comfortably & quietly seated, in a private house- I only wish now, we could get rid of what company we have left- but that we cannot do----     Wednesday night. A private house-10 miles w- of Bedford   We cross'd the Juniaatta again to day, with a great deal of trouble, after waiting on its banks about 3 hours- It is astonishing how the last week's rain, rais'd every stream & overflow'd every place-The like here, has not been known for 30 years it is said-- A waggoner last week, with 4 horses, was drown'd crossing a creek- He was advis'd by those who were by, not to venture- & answer'd \"he would be damn'd to hell if he did not cross it\"- he made the attempt & in a few minutes was sent into eternity, & probably to that awful place---- It has been raining very fast this afternoon, & we put "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36126"],["title","A Journey to Ohio in 1810, as Recorded in the Journal of Margaret Van Horn (#7)"],["body","at a little log hut, a few miles west of Bedford- we came about 10 miles to day- The house is very small & there is scarcely room to move-     Thursday night-- Allegany M^{tn} Nov- 16-   We have had a warm & pleasant day till towards night, when it began to rain, as it has done every day for a fortnight- We are now at a tavern half a mile from the top of the Allegany Mt-this Mountain is 14 miles over- At the highest part of it is a most beautiful prospect of mountains- 5 or 6 ridges one after the other-- We clamber'd up a high rock near to the highest part, but found the prospect little better than the one from the road- I wish I could describe it to you- We have had no prospect of any consequence from any of the mountains before- I have been quite disappointed at not seeing any--We found winter green berrys in abundance on it-I pick'd a sprig of ivy from the top, which I will send you- call it laurel & preserve it, as it came from the very _backbone of America_, as they all tell us--We have walk'd a great deal to day, & indeed we are oblig'd to every day, for the whole country seems one continued m^{tn}- I thought we had reach'd the top of this, for we began to descend a little; but we have half a mile more to ascend yet---- This house is full of travvellers & wag'^{nrs} but all are very peacable-There is a curiosity in the house- a young lady who has come from N Connecticut _unmarried_-- after staying in Warren a year--a thing I never before heard of, & had begun to think impossible. I feel quite encouraged by it- & do not believe the place as dangerous as is generally reported---- I find in every family a _Paggy_- every body is dutch-- the children & girls, are all very much attracted by my little black buttons, & the manner in which my frock is made-& the Wag'^{rs} by the colour of it- There will be little of it left by the time I get to Warren, for it is almost gone--     Friday night- Allegany M^{tn}--   After a comfortable nights rest, we set out on foot to reach the height of the m^{tn}- It rain'd fast for a long time, & at length began snowing- We found the roads bad past description,- worse than you can possibly imagine- Large stones & deep mud holes every step of the way- We were oblig'd to walk as much as we possibly could, as the horses could scarcely stir the waggon the mud was so deep & the stones so large---- It has grown so cold that I fear we shall all perish tomorrow- We suffer'd with cold excessively, to day- From what I have seen and heard, I think the State of Ohio will be well fill'd before winter,-Waggons without number, every day go on- One went on containing _forty_ people- We almost every day, see them with 18 or 20- one stopt here to night with 21-- We are at a baker's, near a tavern which is fill'd with movers & waggoners- It is a comfortable place, but rather small- One old man has been in examining my writing, & giving his opinion of it in dutch, to a young fellow who was with him- He said he could not read a word of any thing-- He found fault with the ink, but commended the straitness & facility with which I wrote- in english- I was glad he had not on his specs---- We came but 10 miles to day, & are yet on the Allegany- It is up hill almost all the way down the mountains-- I do not know when we are down them for my part--_I'm thinking_ as they say here, we shall be oblig'd to winter on it, for I _reckon_ we shall be unable to proceed on our journey, on account of roads, weather, &c-- We are on the old Pennsylvania road- the Glade road is said to be ten times worse than this-That is utterly impossible- We thought we should escape the waggoners this way; but find as many of them as ever- they are a very great annoyance---- What would the old man say hereto?-- I am very tir'd, so good night--     Saturday eve-2 miles from Laurel Hill-Penn-   We came but 9 or 10 miles to day, & are now near the 6^{th} Mountain- in a tavern fill'd with half drunken noisy waggoners-- One of them lies singing directly before the fire; proposing just now to call for a song from the young ladies---- I can neither think nor write he makes so much noise with his _love songs_; I am every moment expecting something dreadful & dare not lay down my pen lest they should think me listening to them- They are the very worst wretches that ever liv'd, I do believe,--I am out of all patience with them- The whole world nor any thing in it, would tempt me to stay in this State three months- I dislike everything belonging to it--I am not so foolish as to suppose there are no better people in it than those we have seen; but let them be ever so good, I never desire to see any of them----We overtook an old waggoner whose waggon had got set in the mud, & I never heard a creature swear so- & whipt his horses till I thought they would die--I could not but wonder at the patience and forbearance of the Almighty, whose awful name was so blasphem'd-- We also overtook a young _Doctor_-who is going with his father to Mad river in the state of Ohio---- He has been studying physic in New Jersey,- but appears to be an uneducated man from the language he makes use of----I believe both himself & his father are very clever- I heard them reproving a swearer-- He dresses smart, & was so polite as to assist us in getting over the mud-- Susan & I walk'd on before the waggon as usual, & he overtook us and invited us into the house & call'd for some brandy sling- we did not drink, which he appear'd not to like very well, & has scarcely spoken to us since---- He thinks himself a gentleman of the _first chop_, & takes the liberty of coining words for himself- Speaking of the people in this state, he said they were very ignorant & very _superstitionary_ --perhaps you have heard the word before- I never did--  Sunday morn- We had good beds last night, contrary to my expectation,- and we are going on our journey this morning- It is extremely cold & very bad riding or walking- M^r W- has been so long detain'd by bad weather & riding, that he thinks himself justifiable in riding on the sabbath- I thought so some time ago--  Sunday noon- We are on the top of Laurel Hill, the 6^{th} mountain-- We women & girls, have walk'd between 5 & 6 miles this morning-- We left the waggons getting along very slowly, & came on to a house to warm us- It is a log hut & full of children, as is every one we come to-- The wind whistles about us, & it looks very much like snow---- One waggon got set this morning, & hinder'd us this long time-- The young Doctor & his father are still in company with us-- The former, who has got over his pouting fit, leaves his father to drive,- while he walks on with the ladies- he is not with us just now-- He has not conquer'd the antipathy I bear a young physician-- or rather a _young Doctor_-- How little it seems like the sabbath-- I would not write if I could do any thing else-- but I can not even think good thoughts----     Sunday eve-- Nov-19^{th}-- Foot of Laurel Hill--Penn--   I wish my dear Elizabeth, you could be here for half an hour, & hear the strangest man talk, that you or I ever saw in this world-- He is either mad or a fool-- I don't know which, but he looking over me & telling me I _can_ make a writer-- He is the most rating, ranting fellow-- I wish you could hear him----I begin to think him mad-- His name is Smith-- He & his wife are journeying either to New Orleans or the Ohio---- I never was more diverted than to hear him (he is certainly crazy-- repeating a prayer & a sermon & forty other things in a breath) talk about the Dutchmen in Pennsylvania-- He & his wife came amongst them one evening & stopt at several houses to get entertainment, but was sent on by each one to the tavern-- He began by stating his religious tenets, & at length after every body & thing was created, he says the _under Gods_ (of whom he supposes there were a great number) took some of the skum & stir'd it up, & those fellows came out--or rather Hell boil'd over & they were form'd of the skum----I believe he has been studying all his life for hard words & pompous speeches, & he rattled them off at a strange rate-- His language is very ungrammatical--but the Jacksons are all in raptures with him--They cannot understand his language (nor indeed could any one else) & therefore concluded he must be very learned- Their observations are almost as diverting as his conversation- I could make them believe in ten minutes, that I was a girl of great larnin-if I were to say over Kermogenious- Heterogenious & a few such words without any connection--no matter if I do but bring them in some how-- We are over the 6^{th} mountain & at an Inn at the foot of it- This m^{tn} is called worse than any of them- it is only about 6 miles over- We have only come 8 to day, & I have not been in the waggon- The horses once or twice got set, & cast &c- we have had a deal of bad luck-- There is a great many travellers here-the house is full---- The young D^r told me he was married, to day-- I like him rather better than I did, before, & ventured to walk on a mile or two with him- He gave me the history of his courtship &c-and some information respecting the part of Ohio he is going to, that was quite interesting-- Susan chose to ride down the hill, & I outwalk'd M^{rs} W, so we were quite alone till we reach'd this house- M^{rs} Jackson & Eliza had gone on before us, and I every moment expected to overtake them, but did not see them till we got here-- I am very tir'd & have laughed myself into a headache; so I can write no more to night.  Monday morn- Last night we were again cheated out of our beds, & oblig'd to pass the night as we could, & that was most uncomfortably- I was quite unwell with the headache, & had waited for a bed an hour & a half longer than I felt able to set up; & when I found I could get none, I had a long crying spell-- This morning I feel almost sick-- M^r W-is so much afraid of making trouble, that he will wait till every body else is served, &"]]]
