The extension of the upright supporting column is       accomplished by two sliding motions, the lower,       controlled by a set screw only, being intended for       coarser adjustments, the upper, controlled by rack and       pinion, for finer adjustments. A millimeter scale and a       vernier serve to indicate the degrees of the various       motions, so that vertical motion of the microscope tube       to the extent of 1/10 mm may be accomplished.        The microscope tube carries a spirit level and revolves       upon a horizontal disc. The objective, consisting of two       separable doublets, permits three degrees of       magnification of 5, 9 and 48 cm focal distance       respectively. A rack and pinion adjustment serves as       adjustment of the microscope tube. A micrometer, 1 cm       long and divided into 100, in the diaphragm of the       ocular still further increases the availability of the       instrument for making fine and accurate measurements.        The instrument serves as a useful aid in many physical       and physiological investigations.        Price, including objective, ocular and micrometer         =40.--=       =Microscopes for Mineralogical Research.=   We construct two Microscopes for mineralogical investigations. Both are adapted for determining the axes of elasticity and for the differentiation of isotropic and anisotropic bodies. Stand I alone is adapted for determining the optical axes and their angles.  Only such objectives, condensers and oculars are available for mineralogical examinations as have been shown after careful examination in polarized light to be free from polarization.  [Illustration: Mineralogical Stand I.]     =Mineralogical Stand I.=    37. This microscope corresponds in its dimensions to       Stand Ia as described on page 31. Coarse adjustment by       rack and pinion, fine adjustment by micrometer-screw,       the milled head of which has 50 divisions, each       representing a motion of the objective of 1/100 mm. The       condenser, iris-diaphragm and polarizer can be raised       and lowered by rack and pinion. A triple condenser       facilitates the observation of the axial lines in the       microscope. It is so arranged as to be easily replaced       by a simple diaphragm-carrier. By means of a collar       attached to the end of the tube the objective is brought       into coincidence with the centre of the revolving stage.       This revolving stage is divided into 360 degrees and       fitted with a vernier and index. Two scales on the       stage, at right angles to each other, permit accurate       location of specimens. The Nicol prism, which serves as       a polarizer, can, after turning the iris-diaphragm       aside, be drawn out from under the latter. The zero       position of the Nicol prism is indicated by a line, as       well as the angles 90, 180, 270°. The analyser is       mounted in metal and is firmly fixed above the eye-       piece. The analyser rotates on a disc graduated to 360       deg. The front of the tube has a movable window which       provides access to the inner tube. In the latter is an       opening for the introduction of a Bertrand lens. This       lens serves the purpose of magnifying the interference       figures produced by the converging rays of polarized       light. This lens and the eye-piece can be raised or       lowered by rack and pinion. In the analyzer is a slide       for the insertion of gypsum and quartz plates at an       angle of 45 degrees.        In many investigations it is advisable to employ an       analyzer introduced laterally into the tube, instead of       the one mentioned above.        The following parts are supplied to complete the outfit:         Triple nose-piece.          Eye-piece 0, with Bertrand's quartered quartz plate.          Eye-piece I with cross-lines, Brezina's Calcspath-plate,         cleft perpendicularly to its axis, made to fit over         eye-piece I, Klein's gypsum and quartz plates for         insertion in the opening over the objective.

The base and pillar are in one piece, neatly       japanned black. The coarse adjustment is by rack and       pinion.        The stage is revolving and graduated on the edge into       360 degrees. A pointer indicates its position.        The polarizer has stop at zeropoint and also marks at 90°,       180° and 270°. It is held in a spring-sleeve and the       substage can be raised and lowered by lateral screw, or       may be swung to one side. The condenser is mounted in       separate arm above the polarizer and swings out of the       optical axis by means of a lever, if parallel instead of       convergent rays are desired.        The analyzer fits into an opening of the tube above the       objectives and can be instantly thrown in or out of the       optical axis. There is a slot below the analyzer for the       insertion of quartz and gypsum plates.        By means of a collar with two centering screws attached to       the end of the tube, the objective may be brought into the       optical axis.

Pfeiffer.]  =The Dissecting microscope with erected image according to Prof. R. Pfeiffer= has been constructed in such a way that all parts extending on both sides can be folded or turned, so that the instrument fits in a very small case.  The base consists of two parts which may be folded. The stage can be brought in a position vertical to the optical axis and the metal hand rests laid on top of the stage. They are connected with the latter by joints. The mirror can also be turned and put parallel to the pillar.  A round glassplate is set in the stage, below which is an iris diaphragm to properly regulate the illumination.  The adjustment is by rack and pinion.  Two rightangle prisms are mounted inside the tube in such a manner that the image obtained by the objective is reflected into the eye-piece and appears erected.  The eye-piece is of the Ramsden form. Three objectives of different magnifying power with specially long working-distances have been constructed Nos. 1, 2, 3.
