In the month of April 1792 I returned to Paris, where I again met Bonaparte,      --[Bonaparte is said, on very doubtful authority, to have spent five    or six weeks in London in 1791 or 1792, and to have \"lodged in a    house in George Street, Strand. His chief occupation appeared to be    taking pedestrian exercise in the streets of London--hence his    marvellous knowledge of the great metropolis which used to astonish    any Englishmen of distinction who were not aware of this visit. He    occasionally took his cup of chocolate at the 'Northumberland,'    occupying himself in reading, and preserving a provoking taciturnity    to the gentlemen in the room; though his manner was stern, his    deportment was that of a gentleman.\" The story of his visit is    probably as apocryphal as that of his offering his services to the    English Government when the English forces wore blockading the coast    of Corsica,]--  and our college intimacy was fully renewed. I was not very well off, and adversity was hanging heavily on him; his resources frequently failed him. We passed our time like two young fellows of twenty-three who have little money and less occupation. Bonaparte was always poorer than I. Every day we conceived some new project or other. We were on the look-out for some profitable speculation. At one time he wanted me to join him in renting several houses, then building in the Rue Montholon, to underlet them afterwards. We found the demands of the landlords extravagant--everything failed.  At the same time he was soliciting employment at the War Office, and I at the office of Foreign Affairs. I was for the moment the luckier of the two.  While we were spending our time in a somewhat vagabond way,      --[It was before the 20th of June that in our frequent excursions    around Paris we went to St. Cyr to see his sister Marianne (Elisa).    We returned to dine alone at Trianon.--Bourrienne.]--  the 20th of June arrived. We met by appointment at a restaurateur's in the Rue St. Honore, near the Palais Royal, to take one of our daily rambles. On going out we saw approaching, in the direction of the market, a mob, which Bonaparte calculated at five or six thousand men. They were all in rags, ludicrously armed with weapons of every description, and were proceeding hastily towards the Tuilleries, vociferating all kinds of gross abuse. It was a collection of all that was most vile and abject in the purlieus of Paris. \"Let us follow the mob,\" said Bonaparte. We got the start of them, and took up our station on the terrace of the banks of the river. It was there that he witnessed the scandalous scenes which took place; and it would be difficult to describe the surprise and indignation which they excited in him. When the King showed himself at the windows overlooking the garden, with the red cap, which one of the mob had put on his head, he could no longer repress his indignation. \"Che coglione!\" he loudly exclaimed. \"Why have they let in all that rabble! They should sweep off four or five hundred of them with the cannon; the rest would then set off fast enough.\"  When we sat down to dinner, which I paid for, as I generally did, for I was the richer of the two, he spoke of nothing but the scene we had witnessed. He discussed with great good sense the causes and consequences of this unrepressed insurrection. He foresaw and developed with sagacity all that would ensue. He was not mistaken. The 10th of August soon arrived. I was then at Stuttgart, where I was appointed Secretary of Legation.  At St. Helena Bonaparte said, \"On the news of the attack of the Tuilleries, on the 10th of August, I hurried to Fauvelet, Bourrienne's brother, who then kept a furniture warehouse at the Carrousel.\" This is partly correct. My brother was connected with what was termed an 'enterprise d'encan national', where persons intending to quit France received an advance of money, on depositing any effects which they wished to dispose of, and which were sold for them immediately. Bonaparte had some time previously pledged his watch in this way.  After the fatal 10th of August Bonaparte went to Corsica, and did not return till 1793. Sir Walter Scott says that after that time he never saw Corsica again. This is a mistake, as will be shown when I speak of his return from Egypt.      --[Sir Walter appears to have collected his information for the Life    of Napoleon only from those libels and vulgar stories which    gratified the calumnious spirit and national hatred. His work is    written with excessive negligence, which, added to its numerous    errors, shows how much respect he must have entertained for his    readers. It would appear that his object was to make it the inverse    of his novels, where everything is borrowed from history. I have    been assured that Marshal Macdonald having offered to introduce    Scott to some generals who could have furnished him with the most    accurate, information respecting military events, the glory of which    they had shared, Sir Walter replied, \"I thank you, but I shall    collect my information from unprofessional reports.\"--Bourrienne.]--  Having been appointed Secretary of Legation to Stuttgart, I set off for that place on the 2d of August, and I did not again see my ardent young friend until 1795. He told me that my departure accelerated his for Corsica. We separated, as may be supposed, with but faint hopes of ever meeting again.  By a decree of the 28th of March of 1793, all French agents abroad were ordered to return to France, within three months, under pain of being regarded as emigrants. What I had witnessed before my departure for Stuttgart, the excitement in which I had left the public mind, and the well-known consequences of events of this kind, made me fear that I should be compelled to be either an accomplice or a victim in the disastrous scenes which were passing at home. My disobedience of the law placed my name on the list of emigrants.  It has been said of me, in a biographical publication, that \"it was as remarkable as it was fortunate for Bourrienne that, on his return, he got his name erased from the list of emigrants of the department of the Yonne, on which it had been inscribed during his first journey to Germany. This circumstance has been interpreted in several different ways, which are not all equally favourable to M. de Bourrienne.\"  I do not understand what favourable interpretations can be put upon a statement entirely false. General Bonaparte repeatedly applied for the erasure of my name, from the month of April 1797, when I rejoined him at Leoben, to the period of the signature of the treaty of Campo-Formio; but without success. He desired his brother Louis, Berthier, Bernadotte, and others, when he sent them to the Directory, to urge my erasure; but in vain. He complained of this inattention to his wishes to Bottot, when he came to Passeriano, after the 18th Fructidor. Bottot, who was secretary to Barras, was astonished that I was not erased, and he made fine promises of what he would do. On his return to France he wrote to Bonaparte: \"Bourrienne is erased.\" But this was untrue. I was not erased until November 1797, upon the reiterated solicitations of General Bonaparte.  It was during my absence from France that Bonaparte, in the rank of 'chef de bataillon', performed his first campaign, and contributed so materially to the recapture of Toulon. Of this period of his life I have no personal knowledge, and therefore I shall not speak of it as an eye-witness. I shall merely relate some facts which fill up the interval between 1793 and 1795, and which I have collected from papers which he himself delivered to me. Among these papers is a little production, entitled 'Le Souper de Beaucaire', the copies of which he bought up at considerable expense, and destroyed upon his attaining the Consulate. This little pamphlet contains principles very opposite to those he wished to see established in 1800, a period when extravagant ideas of liberty were no longer the fashion, and when Bonaparte entered upon a system totally the reverse of those republican principles professed in 'Le Souper de Beaucaire.      --[This is not, as Sir Walter says, a dialogue between Marat and a    Federalist, but a conversation between a military officer, a native    of Nismes, a native of Marseilles, and a manufacturer from    Montpellier. The latter, though he takes a share in the    conversation, does not say much. 'Le Souper de Beaucaire' is given    at full length in the French edition of these Memoirs, tome i. pp.    319-347; and by Iung, tome ii. p. 354, with the following remarks:    \"The first edition of 'Le Souper de Beaucaire' was issued at the    cost of the Public Treasury, in August 1798. Sabin Tournal, its    editor, also then edited the 'Courrier d'Avignon'. The second    edition only appeared twenty-eight years afterwards, in 1821,    preceded by an introduction by Frederick Royou (Paris: Brasseur    Aine, printer, Terrey, publisher, in octavo). This pamphlet did not    make any sensation at the time it appeared. It was only when    Napoleon became Commandant of the Army of Italy that M. Loubet,    secretary and corrector of the press for M. Tournal, attached some    value to the manuscript, and showed it to several persona. Louis    Bonaparte, later, ordered several copies from M. Aurel. The    pamphlet, dated 29th duly 1793, is in the form of a dialogue between    an officer of the army, a citizen of Nismes, a manufacturer of    Montpellier, and a citizen of Marseilles. Marseilles was then in a    state of insurrection against the Convention. Its forces had seized    Avignon, but had been driven out by the army of Cartesna, which was    about to attack Marseilles itself.\" In the dialogue the officer    gives"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35699"],["title","Fontainbleau; a comic opera.

WILLIAM SAVAGE, PRINTER,   LONDON.     REMARKS.   The title of this play gives a sensation of both pain and pleasure.--Fontainbleau was a favourite residence of a number of the French kings, and the spot where the princes of the blood resorted, with all the nobility of the land, when the sports of the field, or the course, were the particular objects of their pastime. Pastime is a word no longer used in the vocabulary of the court of France--Every moment has now its impending cares, and teems with the fate of empires!  At the time this opera was written, (in 1784) the late Duke of Orleans frequently visited England, and was remarkable for his passionate attachment to British modes and manners. The character of Colonel Epaulette, in this drama, was supposed to be founded on this, his highness's extravagant partiality. There is that trait, indeed, of the duke's propensity, in Epaulette; but in all other respects, the colonel neither soars, nor grovels, with his royal archetype, in any one action of notoriety.  The author would not take the liberty to characterise a foreigner, without dealing, at the same time, equally free with one of his own countrymen. The part of Lackland was taken more exactly from life, than that of Epaulette, from a gentleman well known abroad by every English traveller; and whose real name is so very like the fictitious one here adopted, that a single letter removed, would make the spelling just the same.  The reader will observe in this Lackland, so much of debased nature, and of whimsical art; so much of what he has probably met with upon journeys, or amongst common intruders at home, that he will regret, that the author, in his delineation, swerves now and then from that standard of truth, to which he, possibly, at first meant to adhere; and for the sake of dramatic effect, has made this hero, in effrontery, proceed somewhat too far beyond its usual limits.  The family of the Bulls, especially Miss Bull and her father, are likewise portraits rather too bold; but they are humorous pictures, and, no doubt, perfect copies of such citizens, as inhabited London a few centuries past.  Squire Tallyho gives, like them, some idea of former times; for his manners do not exactly correspond with those of the modern gentlemen of the turf.  Lapoche is, perhaps, an exact Frenchman of the time in which he was drawn; and, as such, the most agreeable object for an Englishman's ridicule. The mistakes which occur, to both Mr. and Mrs. Bull, in respect to this insignificant, and that pompous man, Epaulette, are incidents of very rich humour, though they place the opera more in that class of the drama, which is called farce, than in that of comedy. Such is the incident, but more excellent in its kind, of Lackland's courtship of Miss Dolly, and her equal affection for her three suitors.  The real lovers, in this piece, would all be extremely insipid, but that they all sing; and music is called, \"the voice of love.\"  When music had fewer charms for the British nation, operas were required to possess more of interesting fable than at present is necessary--for now, so rapturous is the enjoyment derived from this enchanting art, even by the vulgar, that plot, events, and characters of genuine worth, would be cast away in a production, where music had a share in bestowing delight.

Ecod, ma'am, he said he'd make you bounce.  _Mrs. Casey._ Make me bounce! A shabby, spunging----though without a second coat, the fellow's as proud as a Galway merchant.--Make me bounce in my own house!--pretty well, that, upon my honour!  _Lack._ [_Within._] What! house!  _Mrs. Casey._ Run, don't you hear?  _Lack._ [_Within._] Where is that infernal----  _2 Waiter._ Infernal! that's you, ma'am, he's calling.  _Mrs. Casey._ Hush! here he is.

Ah! the beginning of a good song at the latter end of a bottle is a capital thing for a house--Now, here, during the race time, I'll give you your board at the table d'hÃ´te, and money in your pocket to pay the reckoning, if you'll only be a good jolly fellow, and encourage the company to drink, by a funny song, or a comical story.  _Lack._ What! live by entertaining a company?  _Mrs. Casey._ Yes; that's what I call earning your bread like a gentleman.  _Lack._ Make me your decoy-duck? Mrs. Casey, you're a widow, you'll oblige me if you'll marry somebody immediately.  _Mrs. Casey._ And why so, pray?  _Lack._ Madam, that I might have the superlative honour of twisting your husband by the nose.

Come to sport here at the races, eh? flush?  _Henry._ Why, 'faith, Lackland, as to cash, my affairs, at present, are little better than your own.  _Lack._ Ahem! Egad, that's rather unlucky for us both.  _Henry._ But my mind, my dear Charles! I am this moment the most unhappy--in a word, you see me here an exile, fled from the hands of justice!--You remember my sister Rosa?  _Lack._ What, little romping Rose, that used to steal our fish, and throw our cards in the fire?
