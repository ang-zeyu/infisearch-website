PREFACE  TO THE SECOND EUROPEAN EDITION.   When the following Work was first published in America, in 1837, it was but little known, and seemed to meet with little or no encouragement. Months passed away, and very few copies were sold or read. But, to the astonishment of the author, it worked itself into notice more and more, by the blessing of God, and by virtue of its own real merits; till, in two years, the first edition, consisting of three thousand copies, was all sold, and many more were called for. A new edition was published in 1839, consisting of two thousand five hundred copies; these were also disposed of. Other three editions have since been published, making in all thirteen thousand copies now disposed of, and the demand is still increasing both in America and Europe.  It has already found its way into most of the American States, and into the provinces of the Canadas, as well as many parts of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. It has visited the cottages of the humble, and the parlors of the great; and from the best information we have on the subject, very few have risen from its perusal without a deep and settled conviction of the truth of its principles.  The author has now in his possession the testimony of hundreds of people, from different states and nations, all bearing witness that this Work has been a means, in the hands of God, of saving them from infidelity, from sectarian error and delusion, and of guiding them into the light of TRUTH.  All these considerations, and an intense desire to impart the truth to mankind as widely as possible, have induced the author to send forth this new edition; which he greatly desires may prove a blessing to thousands who are yet grovelling in darkness and superstition, and lead them to the true fold of God.  If there be anything to admire, or anything praiseworthy in this Work, the author has no claim to the honor or the praise; it is justly due to Him who is the Source and Fountain of all TRUTH. The author was a husbandman, inured to the plow--unpolished by education, untaught in the schools of modern Sectarianism, (falsely called \"Divinity\")-- reared in the wilds of America, with a mind independent, untrammelled and free. He drank of the pure fountain of Truth, unsullied and unmixed, as it unfolded in majesty of light and splendor from the opening heavens in all the simplicity of its nature. As such it has flowed from his pen in the following volume; not veiled in mystery; not dressed in the pomp of high-sounding names, and titles, and learned terms; not adorned in the gay attire of eloquence flowing from the imagination and the passions; but standing forth in the undress of its own native modesty, as if conscious of the purity and innocence of its nature.  He is indebted not only to the _Spirit_ of Truth for the principles contained in this Work, but also to several men, who have been made the instruments in the hands of God, to reveal the knowledge of God to this generation, and to be the founders and leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Among the foremost of these, he would make honorable mention of President Joseph Smith, by whose instrumentality most of these glorious truths (so well known to the ancients) have been restored to the knowledge of the world--and whose zeal, labors, sufferings, and subsequent murder, will stand forth as a bright memorial to all succeeding ages, and be celebrated by happy millions yet unborn.  With an assurance that the principles of this Work will yet prevail over the whole earth, this new edition of the VOICE OF WARNING is now sent forth; and should the author be called to sacrifice his life for the cause of Truth, he will have the consolation that it will be said of him, as it was said of Abel, viz: \"HE, BEING DEAD, YET SPEAKETH.\"                                                 PARLEY P. PRATT.  Manchester, England,     Dec. 4, 1846.     PREFACE  TO THE FIRST AMERICAN EDITION.  During the last nine years, the public mind has been constantly agitated, more or less, through all parts of our country, with the cry of \"Mormonism, Mormonism, Delusion, Imposture, Fanaticism,\" etc., chiefly through the instrumentality of the press. Many of the newspapers of the day have been constantly teeming with misrepresentations and slanders of the foulest kind, in order to destroy the influence and character of an innocent society in its very infancy; a society of whose real principles many of them know nothing at all. Every species of wickedness has been resorted to, and all manner of evil has been spoken against them falsely; insomuch, that in many places, houses and ears are closed against them, without the possibility of being heard for a moment.  Were this the only evil, we might have less cause of complaint; but in consequence of this we have been assaulted by mobs, some of our houses have been torn down or burned, our goods destroyed, and fields of grain laid waste. Yea, more--some of us have been stoned, whipped, and shot; our blood has been caused to flow, and still smokes to heaven, because of our religious principles, in this our native land, the boasted land of liberty and equal law! while we have sought in vain for redress. Officers of state have been deaf to the voice of Innocence, imploring at their feet for justice and protection in the enjoyment of rights as American citizens.  Under these circumstances, what could be done? How were we to correct the public mind? We were few in number, and our means of giving information very limited; the columns of most of the papers were closed against us, their popularity being at stake the moment our principles were admitted. It is true we published a monthly paper, in which our principles were clearly set forth; but its circulation was limited to a few thousands. Under these circumstances, had we the tongue of angels, and the zeal of Apostles, with our hearts expanded wide as eternity, with the intelligence of heaven, and the love of God burning in our bosoms; and commissioned to bear as joyful tidings as ever were borne by Michael, the Archangel, from the regions of glory; yet, it would have been as impossible for us to have communicated the same to the public, as it was for Paul, when he stood in the midst of Ephesus, to declare the glad tidings of a crucified and risen Redeemer, when his voice was lost amid the universal cry of \"Great is Diana of the Ephesians!\"  Go, lift your voice to the tumultuous waves of the ocean, or try to reason amid the roar of cannon while the tumult of war is gathering thick around, or speak to the howling tempest while it pours a deluge over the plains; let your voice be heard amid the roar of chariots rushing suddenly over the pavements; or, what is still less useful, converse with a man who is lost in slumbers, or reason with a drunkard while he reels to and fro under the influence of the intoxicating poison, and those will convince you of the impossibility of communicating truth to that soul who is willing to make up his judgment upon popular rumor, or to be wafted gently down the current of public opinion, without stopping for a moment to listen, to weigh, to hear both sides of the question, and judge for himself.  One of the greatest obstacles in the way of the spread of truth, in every age, is the tide of public opinion. Let one ray of light burst upon the world in any age, and it is sure to come in contact with the traditions and long-established usages of men, and their opinions; or with some religious craft, so that, like the Ephesians, they counsel together what shall be done; their great goddess will be spoken against, her magnificence despised, her temple deserted; or, what is still worse, their craft is in danger, for by this they have their wealth. Call to mind the Apostles in contact with the Jewish Rabbis, or with Gentile superstitions; in short, at war with every religious establishment on the earth. Witness the popular clamor: \"If we let them thus alone, all men will believe on them, and the Romans will come and take away our place and nation.\" \"These men that turn the world upside down have come hither also.\" \"What new doctrine is this, for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears?\" \"These men do exceedingly trouble our city, and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive, being Romans.\" \"What will this babbler say, he seems to be a setter forth of strange gods?\" And many other such like sayings.  Or, let us for a moment contemplate the events of later date; for instance, the Mother Church against the reformers of various ages; see them belied, slandered, degraded, whipped, stoned, imprisoned, burned, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],["title","A Voice of Warning (#1)"],["body","in various ways, while the ignorant multitude were made to believe they were the very worst of men.  Again, think for a moment of the struggles of Columbus, an obscure individual of limited education, but blessed with a largeness of heart, a noble genius, a mind which disdained to confine itself to the old beaten track; accustomed to think for itself, it burst the chains which, in ages past, had held in bondage the nations of the earth; it soared aloft, as it were on eagle's wings; it outstripped and left far behind the boasted genius of Greece and Rome; it penetrated the dark mysteries which lay concealed amid the western waters. Behold him struggling for eight years against the learned ignorance of the courts and councils of Europe, while the sneer of contempt, the finger of scorn, and the hiss of derision, were the solid arguments opposed to his theory.  But what was the result when, after many a fruitless struggle, an expedition was fitted out, consisting of three small vessels? A new world presented itself to the wondering nations of the East, destined, at no distant period, to become the theatre of the most glorious and astonishing events of the last days. This fact was no sooner demonstrated than their philosophical, geographical, and religious objections vanished in a moment; haughty ignorance and bigotry were for once constrained to cast their honors in the dust, and bow their reverend heads at the feet of real worth, and learn, in humble silence, that one fact, clearly demonstrated, was worth ten thousand theories and opinions of men.  Having said so much to impress upon the human mind the necessity of hearing, and then judging, I would only add, that the object of this publication is to give the public correct information concerning a religious system, which has penetrated every State from Maine to Missouri, as well as the Canadas, in the short space of nine years; organizing Churches and Conferences in every region, and gathering in its progress from fifty to a hundred thousand disciples; having, at the same time, to sustain the shock of an overwhelming, religious influence, opposed to it by the combined powers of every sect in America. What but the arm of Omnipotence could have moved it forward amid the rage of mobs? having to contend with the prejudice of the ignorant and the pen of the learned; at war with every creed and craft in Christendom; while the combined powers of earth and hell were hurling a storm of persecution, unparalleled in the history of our country.  This Work is also intended as a warning voice, or proclamation of truth, to all people into whose hands it may fall, that they may understand, and be prepared for the great day of the Lord. Opinion and guesswork in the things of God are worse than useless; facts, well demonstrated, can alone be of service to mankind. And as the Holy Ghost can alone guide us into all truth, we pray God the Eternal Father, in the name of Jesus Christ His Son, that the Spirit of Truth may inspire our hearts in inditing this matter; that we may be able to write the truth in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that it may be the word of God, the everlasting Gospel, the power of God unto salvation, to the Gentile first, and also to the Jew.     A VOICE OF WARNING AND INSTRUCTION TO ALL PEOPLE.   CHAPTER I.  ON PROPHECY ALREADY FULFILLED.       We have also a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well     that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place,     until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: knowing     this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private     interpretation; for the prophecy came not in old time by the will     of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved upon by the     Holy Ghost.--PETER.  In order to prove anything from Scripture, it is highly necessary in the first place to lay down some certain, definite, infallible rule of interpretation, without which the mind is lost in uncertainty and doubt, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.  The neglect of such a rule has thrown mankind into the utmost confusion and uncertainty in all their biblical researches. Indeed, while mankind are left at liberty to transform, spiritualize, or give any uncertain or private interpretation to the word of God, all is uncertainty.  \"Whatsoever was written aforetime, was written for our profit and learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.\" Now, suppose a friend from a distance should write us a letter, making certain promises to us on certain conditions, which, if we obtained, would be greatly to our profit and advantage: of course it might be said the letter was written for our profit and learning, that through patience and comfort of the letter we might have hope to obtain the things promised. Now if we clearly understood the letter, and knew what to expect, then it would afford us comfort and hope; whereas, if there was any doubt or uncertainty on our minds in the understanding of the same, then could we derive no certain comfort or hope from the things written, not knowing what to hope for; consequently the letter would not profit us at all. And so it is with the Scriptures. No prophecy or promise will profit the reader, or produce patience, comfort, or hope in his mind until clearly understood, that he may know precisely what to hope for. Now, the predictions of the Prophets can be clearly understood, as much so as the almanac when it foretells an eclipse; or else the Bible of all books is of most doubtful usefulness. Far better would it have been for mankind, if the great Author of our existence had revealed nothing to His fallen creatures, than to have revealed a book which would leave them in doubt and uncertainty, to contend with one another, from age to age, respecting the meaning of its contents. That such uncertainty and contention have existed for ages, none will deny. The wise and learned have differed, and do still widely differ, from each other, in the understanding of prophecy. Whence then this difference? Either Revelation itself is deficient, or else the fault is in mankind. But to say Revelation is deficient, would be to charge God foolishly; God forbid: the fault must be in man. There are two great causes for this blindness, which I will now show:  First, mankind have supposed that direct inspiration by the Holy Ghost was not intended for all ages of the Church, but was confined to primitive times; the \"Canon of Scripture being full,\" and all things necessary being revealed; the Spirit which guides into all truth was no longer for the people: therefore they sought to understand, by their own wisdom, and by their own learning, what could never be clearly understood, except by the Spirit of Truth: for the things of God knoweth no man, except by the Spirit of God.  Secondly, having lost the Spirit of Inspiration, they began to institute their own opinions, traditions, and commandments; giving constructions and private interpretations to the written word, instead of believing the things written. And the moment they departed from its literal meaning, one man's opinion, or interpretation, was just as good as another's; all were clothed with equal authority, and from thence arose all the darkness and misunderstanding on these points, which have agitated the world for the last seventeen hundred years.  Among the variety of commodities which attract the attention of mankind, there is one thing of more value than all others. A principle which, if once possessed, will greatly assist in obtaining all other things worth possessing, whether it were power, wealth, riches, honors, thrones, or dominions. Comparatively few have ever possessed it, although it was within the reach of many others, but they were either not aware of it, or did not know its value. It has worked wonders for the few who have possessed it. Some it enabled to escape from drowning, while every soul who did not possess it was lost in the mighty deep. Others it saved from famine, while thousands perished all around them; by it men have often been raised to dignity in the state; yea, more, some have been raised to the throne of empires. The possession of it has sometimes raised men from a dungeon to a palace; and there are instances in which those that possessed it were delivered from the flames, while cities were consumed, and every soul, themselves excepted, perished. Frequently, when a famine or the sword has destroyed a city or nation, they alone who possessed it escaped unhurt. By this time the reader inquires, What can this be? Inform me, and I will purchase it, even at the sacrifice of all I possess on earth. Well, kind reader, this treasure is FOREKNOWLEDGE! a knowledge of things future! Let a book be published, entitled, \"A Knowledge of the Future,\" and let mankind be really convinced that it did give a certain, definite knowledge of future events, so that its pages unfold the future history of the nations, and of many great events, as the history of Greece or Rome does unfold the past, and a large edition would immediately sell at a great sum per copy; indeed, they would be above all price. Now, kind reader, the books of the Prophets, and the Spirit of Prophecy were intended for this very purpose. Well did the Apostle say, \"Covet earnestly the best gifts; but rather that ye prophesy.\"  Having said so much, we will now enter into the wide expanded field which lies before us, and search out the treasures of wisdom and knowledge which have been shining for ages like a light in a dark place. We will explore regions unknown to many; we will gaze upon the opening glories which present themselves on every side, and feast our souls with knowledge which is calculated in its nature to enlarge the heart, to exalt the mind, and to raise the affections above the little, mean, grovelling things of the world, and to make one wise unto salvation."]]]
