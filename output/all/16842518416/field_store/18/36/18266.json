Jan stuck hid head in the door, just as she got the bellows to start the fire again. \"What did I tell you!\" he shouted, running out his tongue derisively.  \"Scat!\" said Marie, shaking the bellows at him, and Jan sauntered away toward the pasture with Pier's halter over his arm.  Pier had been eating grass for two nights and a day without doing any work, and it took Jan some time to catch him and put the halter over his head. When at last he returned from the pasture, red and tired, but triumphant, leading Pier, Marie and her mother had already finished their breakfast.  \"Look what a man we have!\" cried Mother Van Hove as Jan appeared. \"He has caught Pier all by himself.\"  \"He lifted me clear off my feet when I put his halter on,\" said Jan proudly, \"but I hung on and he had to come!\"  \"Marie,\" cried her mother, \"our Jan has earned a good breakfast! Cook an egg for him, while I hitch Pier to the cart. Then, while he and I work in the field, you can put the house in order. There is only one more load to bring in, and we can do that by ourselves.\"  By noon the last of the wheat had been garnered, and this time Jan drove Pier home, while his mother sat on the load. In the afternoon the three unloaded the wagon and stowed the grain away in the barn to be threshed; and when the long day's work was over, and they had eaten their simple supper of bread and milk, Mother Van Hove and the children went together down the village street to see their neighbors and hear the news, if there should be any.  There were no daily papers in Meer, and now there were no young men to go to the city and bring back the gossip of the day, as there had used to be. The women, with their babies on their arms, stood about in the street, talking quietly and sadly among themselves. On the doorsteps a few old men lingered together over their pipes. Already the bigger boys were playing soldier, with paper caps on their heads, and sticks for guns. The smaller children were shouting and chasing each other through the little street of the village. Jan and Marie joined in a game of blindman's buff, while Mother Van Hove stopped with the group of women.  \"If we only knew what to expect!\" sighed the Burgomeister's wife, as she shifted her baby from one arm to the other. \"It seems as if we should know better what to do. In a day or two I shall send my big boy Leon to the city for a paper. It is hard to wait quietly and know nothing.\"  \"Our good King and Queen doubtless know everything,\" said the wife of Boer Maes. \"They will do better for us than we could do for ourselves, even if we knew all that they do.\"  \"And there are our own brave men, besides,\" added Mother Van Hove. \"We must not forget them! We are not yet at war. I pray God we may not be, and that we shall soon see them come marching home again to tell us that the trouble, whatever it is, is over, and that we may go on living in peace as we did before.\"  \"It seems a year since yesterday,\" said the Burgomeister's wife.  \"Work makes the time pass quickly,\" said Mother Van Hove cheerfully. \"Jan and I got in the last of our wheat to-day. He helped me like a man.\"  \"Who will thresh it for you?\" asked the wife of Boer Maes.  \"I will thresh it myself, if need be,\" said Mother Van Hove with spirit. \"My good man shall not come home and find the farm-work behind if I can help it.\" And with these brave words she said good-night to the other women, called Jan and Marie, and turned once more down the street toward the little house on the edge of the village. Far across the peaceful twilight fields came the sound of distant bells. \"Hark!\" said Mother Van Hove to the Twins--\"the cathedral bells of Malines! And they are playing 'The Lion of Flanders!'\"  (three lines of music)  sang the bells, and, standing upon the threshold of her little home, with head held proudly erect, Mother Van Hove lifted her voice and joined the words to the melody. \"They will never conquer him, the old Lion of Flanders, so long as he has claws!\" she sang, and the Twins, looking up into her brave and inspired face, sang too.    VI  AT THE CHURCH  Several days passed quietly by in the little village of Meer. The sun shone, and the wind blew, and the rains fell upon the peaceful fields, just as if nothing whatever had happened. Each day was filled to the brim with hard work. With the help of the Twins, Mother Van Hove kept the garden free of weeds and took care of the stock. She even threshed the wheat herself with her husband's flail, and stored the grain away in sacks ready for the mill. Each evening, when the work was done, the three went down the village street together. One evening, just at dusk, they found nearly the whole village gathered in front of the priest's house next to the church. Leon, the Burgomeister's oldest boy, had been to Malines that day and had brought back a paper.  The priest was reading from it to the anxious group gathered about him. \"Oh, my children,\" he was saying, as Mother Van Hove and the Twins joined the group, \"there is, no doubt, need for courage, but where is there a Belgian lacking in that? Even Julius Caesar, two thousand years ago, found that out! The bravest of all are the Belgians, he said then, and it is none the less true to-day! The Germans have crossed our eastern frontier. It is reported that they are already burning towns and killing the inhabitants if they resist. God knows what may be before us. Our good King Albert has asked Parliament to refuse the demands of the Germans. In spite of their solemn treaty with us, they demand that we permit them to cross Belgium to attack France. To this our brave King and Parliament will never consent; no true Belgian would wish them to. There is, then, this choice either to submit absolutely to the invasion of our country, or to defend it! The army is already in the field.\"  There was a moment of heavy silence as he finished speaking. Then the voice of the Burgomeister's wife was heard in the stillness. \"Oh, Mynheer Pastoor,\" she said to the priest, \"what shall we do? There is no place to go to we have no refuge!\"  \"God is our refuge and strength, my children,\" said the priest, lifting his eyes to heaven. \"We have no other! You must stay here, and if the terrible Germans come, hide yourselves away as best you can, until they have passed by. Do not anger them by resisting. Bow your heads to the storm and have faith in God that it may soon pass over.\" He turned and led the way toward the little church as he spoke. \"Come,\" he said, \"let us pray before God's holy altar, and if the enemy comes, seek refuge in the church itself. Surely even the Germans will respect the sanctuary.\"  Solemnly the people filed into the little church, lighted only by the candles on the altar, and knelt upon the hard floor. The priest left them there, praying silently, while he went to put on the robes of his offices. Then once more he appeared before the altar, and led the kneeling congregation in the litany.  \"From war and pestilence and sudden death, Good Lord, deliver us,\" he prayed at last, and all the people responded with a fervent \"Amen.\"  That night, when she put her children to bed, Mother Van Hove fastened a chain with a locket upon it about Marie's neck. \"Listen, ma Mie,\" she said, \"and you, too, my little Jan. God only knows what may be before us. This locket contains my picture. You must wear it always about your neck, and remember that your mother's name is Leonie Van Hove, and your father's name is Georges Van Hove. If by any chance--which God forbid--we should become separated from one another, keep the locket on your neck, and our names in your memory until we meet again; for if such a thing should happen, do not doubt that I should find you, though I had to swim the sea to do it! For you, my Jan, I have no locket, but you are a man, a brave man, now! You must take care of yourself and your sister, too, if need should arise, and above all, remember this--only the brave are safe. Whatever happens, you must remember that you are Belgians, and be brave!\"  The children clung to her, weeping, as she finished. \"There, there,\" she said soothingly: \"I had to tell you this so you would be ready to do your best and not despair, whatever might happen, but be sure, my lambs, nothing shall harm you if I can help it, and nothing shall separate us from one another if God so wills. Now, go to sleep!\"  She kissed them tenderly, and, quite comforted, they nestled down in their beds and soon were asleep. She herself slept but little that night. Long after the children were quiet, she sat alone on the kitchen step in the darkness with Fidel by her side, and listened to the faint sounds of distant guns, and watched the red light in the sky, which told her of the burning of Louvain.    VII  THE TIDAL WAVE OF GERMANS  The next morning dawned bright and clear, and Mother Van Hove and the Twins went about their work as usual. The sunshine was so bright, and the whole countryside looked so peaceful and fair, it was impossible to believe that the terrors of the night could be true.  \"To-day we must begin to gather the potatoes,\" said Mother Van Hove after breakfast. \"Jan, you get the fork and hoe and put them in the wagon, while I milk the cow and Marie puts up some bread and cheese for us to take to the field.\" She started across the road to the pasture, with Fidel at her heels, as she spoke. In an instant she was back again, her eyes wide with horror. \"Look! Look!\" she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3642"],["title","The Belgian Twins (#4)"],["body","ed.  The dazed children looked toward the east as she pointed. There in the distance, advancing like a great tidal wave, was a long gray line of soldiers on horseback. Already they could hear the sound of music and the throb of drums; already the sun glistened upon the shining helmets and the cruel points of bayonets. The host stretched away across the plain as far as the eye could reach, and behind them the sky was thick with the smoke of fires.  \"The church! the church!\" cried Mother Van Hove. \"No, there is not time. Hide in here, my darlings. Quickly! Quickly!\"  She tore open the door of the earth-covered vegetable cellar as she spoke, and thrust Jan and Marie inside. Fidel bolted in after them. \"Do not move or make a sound until all is quiet again,\" she cried as she closed the door.  There was not room for her too, in the cellar, and if there had been, Mother Van Hove would not have taken it, for it was necessary to close the door from the outside. This she did, hastily, throwing some straw before it. Then she rushed into the house and, snatching up her shining milk-pans, flung them upon the straw, as if they were placed there to be sweetened by the sun. No one would think to look under a pile of pans for hidden Belgians, she felt sure.  Nearer and nearer came the hosts, and now she could hear the sound of singing as from ten thousand brazen throats, \"Deutschland, Deutschland uber Alles,\" roared the mighty chorus, and in another moment the little village of Meer was submerged in the terrible gray flood.  At last, after what seemed to the imprisoned children like a year of darkness and dread, and of strange, terrifying noises of all kinds, the sound of horses' hoofs and marching feet died away in the distance, and Jan ventured to push open the door of the cavern a crack, just intending to peep out. Immediately there was a crash of falling tinware. Jan quickly drew back again into the safe darkness and waited. As nothing further happened, he peeped out again. This time Fidel, springing forward, flung the doors wide open, and dashed out into the sunshine with a joyous bark.  In a moment more Jan and Marie also crawled out of their hiding-place after him. For an instant, as they came out into the daylight, it seemed to the children as if they had awakened from a dreadful dream. There stood the farmhouse just as before, with the kitchen door wide open and the sun streaming in upon the sanded floor. There were only the marks of many feet in the soft earth of the farmyard, an empty pigpen, and a few chicken feathers blowing about the hen house, to show where the invaders had been and what they had carried away with them. Jan and Marie, followed by Fidel, ran through the house. From the front door, which opened on the road; they could see the long gray line sweeping across the fields toward Malines.  \"The storm has passed,\" cried Marie, sobbing with grief, \"just as Mynheer Pastoor said it would! Mother! Mother, where are you?\" They ran from kitchen to bedroom and back again, their terror increasing at every step, as no voice answered their call. They searched the cellar and the loft; they looked in the stable and barn, and even in the dog-house. Their mother was nowhere to be found!  \"I know where she must be,\" cried Jan, at last. \"You know Mynheer Pastoor said, if anything happened, we should hide in the church.\" Led by this hope, the two children sped, hand in hand, toward the village. \"Bel is gone!\" gasped Jan, as they passed the pasture bars. \"Pier, too,\" sobbed Marie. Down the whole length of the deserted village street they flew, with Fidel following close at their heels. When they came to the little church, they burst open the door and looked in. The cheerful sun streamed through the windows, falling in brilliant patches of light upon the floor, but the church was silent and empty. It was some time before they could realize that there was not a human being but themselves in the entire village; all the others had been driven away like sheep, before the invading army. When at last the terrible truth dawned upon them, the two frightened children sat down upon the church steps in the silence, and clung, weeping, to each other. Fidel whined and licked their hands, as though he, too, understood and felt their loneliness.  \"What shall we do? What shall we do?\" moaned Marie.  \"There's nobody to tell us what to do,\" sobbed Jan. \"We must just do the best we can by ourselves.\"  \"We can't stay here alone!\" said Marie.  \"But where can we go?\" cried Jan. \"There's no place for us to go to!\"  For a few minutes the two children wept their hearts out in utter despair, but hope always comes when it is most needed, and soon Marie raised her head and wiped her eyes.  \"Don't you remember what Mother said when she put the locket on my neck, Jan?\" she asked. \"She said that she would find us, even if she had to swim the sea! She said no matter what happened we should never despair, and here we are despairing as hard as ever we can.\"  Jan threw up his chin, and straightened his back. \"Yes,\" he said, swallowing his sobs, \"and she said I was now a man and must take care of myself and you.\"  \"What shall we do, then?\" asked Marie.  Jan thought hard for a moment. Then he said: \"Eat! It must be late, and we have not had a mouthful to-day.\"  Marie stood up. \"Yes,\" said she; \"we must eat. Let us go back home.\"  The clock in the steeple struck eleven as the two children ran once more through the deserted street and began a search for food in their empty house.  They found that the invaders had been as thorough within the house as without. Not only had they carried away the grain which their mother had worked so hard to thresh, but they had cleaned the cupboard as well. The hungry children found nothing but a few crusts of bread, a bit of cheese, and some milk in the cellar, but with these and two eggs, which Jan knew where to look for in the straw in the barn, they made an excellent breakfast. They gave Fidel the last of the milk, and then, much refreshed, made ready to start upon a strange and lonely journey the end of which they did not know. They tied their best clothes in a bundle, which Jan hung upon a stick over his shoulder, and were just about to leave the house, when Marie cried out, \"Suppose Mother should come back and find us gone!\"  \"We must leave word where we have gone, so she will know where to look for us, of course,\" Jan answered capably.  \"Yes, but how?\" persisted Marie. \"There's no one to leave word with!\"  This was a hard puzzle, but Jan soon found a way out. \"We must write a note and pin it up where she would be sure to find it,\" he said.  \"The very thing,\" said Marie.  They found a bit of charcoal and a piece of wrapping-paper, and Jan was all ready to write when a new difficulty presented itself. \"What shall I say?\" he said to Marie. \"We don't know where we are going!\"  \"We don't know the way to any place but Malines,\" said Marie; \"so we'll have to go there, I suppose.\"  \"How do you spell Malines?\" asked Jan, charcoal in hand.  \"Oh, you stupid boy!\" cried Marie. \"M-a-l-i-n-e-s, of course!\"  Jan put the paper down on the kitchen floor and got down before it on his hands and knees. He had not yet learned to write, but he managed to print upon it in great staggering letters:--  \"DEAR MOTHER  WE HAVE GONE TO MALINES TO FIND YOU.  JAN AND MARIE.\"   This note they pinned upon the inside of the kitchen door.  \"Now we are ready to start,\" said Jan; and, calling Fidel, the two children set forth. They took a short cut from the house across the pasture to the potato-field. Here they dug a few potatoes, which they put in their bundle, and then, avoiding the road, slipped down to the river, and, following the stream, made their way toward Malines.  It was fortunate for them that, screened by the bushes and trees which fringed the bank of the river, they saw but little of the ruin and devastation left in the wake of the German hosts. There were farmers who had tried to defend their families and homes from the invaders. Burning houses and barns marked the places where they had lived and died. But the children, thinking only of their lost mother, and of keeping themselves as much out of sight as possible in their search for her, were spared most of these horrors. Their progress was slow, for the bundle was heavy, and the river path less direct than the road, and it was nightfall before the two little waifs, with Fidel at their heels, reached the well-remembered Brussels gate.  Their hearts almost stopped beating when they found it guarded by a German soldier. \"Who goes there?\" demanded the guard gruffly, as he caught sight of the little figures.  \"If you please, sir, it's Jan and Marie,\" said Jan, shaking in his boots.  \"And Fidel, too,\" said Marie.  The soldier bent down and looked closely at the two tear-stained little faces. It may be that some remembrance of other little faces stirred within him, for he only said stiffly, \"Pass, Jan and Marie, and you, too, Fidel.\" And the two children and the dog hurried through the gate and up the first street they came to, their bundle bumping along behind them as they ran.  The city seemed strangely silent and deserted, except for the gray-clad soldiers, and armed guards blocked the way at intervals. Taught by fear, Jan and Marie soon learned to slip quietly along under cover of the gathering darkness, and to dodge into a doorway or round a corner, when they came too near one of the stiff, helmeted figures.  At last, after an hour of aimless wandering, they found themselves in a large, open square, looking up at the tall cathedral spires. A German soldier came suddenly out of the shadows, and the frightened children, scarcely knowing what they did, ran up the cathedral steps and flung themselves against the door. When the soldier had passed by, they reached cautiously up, and by dint of pulling with their united strength succeeded at last in getting the door open. They thrust their bundle"]]]
