He pulled her tail and cut the hair off her heels with a knife; then he gave her some corn to eat, and told Joe he was to have a bundle of thistles cut for her every night.  Now and again, while grooming her, Dad would step back a few paces and look upon her with pride.  \"There's great breeding in the old mare,\" he would say, \"great breeding; look at the shoulder on her, and the loin she has; and where did ever you see a horse with the same nostril?  Believe me, she'll surprise a few of them!\"  We began to regard Bess with profound respect; hitherto we had been accustomed to pelt her with potatoes and blue-metal.  The only thing likely to prejudice her chance in the race, Dad reckoned, was a small sore on her back about the size of a foal's foot. She had had that sore for upwards of ten years to our knowledge, but Dad hoped to have it cured before the race came off with a never-failing remedy he had discovered--burnt leather and fat.  Every day, along with Dad, we would stand on the fence near the house to watch Dave gallop Bess from the bottom of the lane to the barn--about a mile.  We could always see him start, but immediately after he would disappear down a big gully, and we would see nothing more of the gallop till he came to within a hundred yards of us.  And would n't Bess bend to it once she got up the hill, and fly past with Dave in the stirrups watching her shadow!--when there was one:  she was a little too fine to throw a shadow always.  And when Dave and Bess had got back and Joe had led her round the yard a few times, Dad would rub the corn-cob over her again and apply more burnt-leather and fat to her back.  On the morning preceding the race Dad decided to send Bess over three miles to improve her wind.  Dave took her to the crossing at the creek--supposed to be three miles from Shingle Hut, but it might have been four or it might have been five, and there was a stony ridge on the way.  We mounted the fence and waited.  Tommy Wilkie came along riding a plough-horse.  He waited too.  \"Ought to be coming now,\" Dad observed, and Wilkie got excited.  He said he would go and wait in the gully and race Dave home.  \"Race him home!\" Dad chuckled, as Tommy cantered off, \"he'll never see the way Bess goes.\" Then we all laughed.  Just as someone cried \"Here he is!\" Dave turned the corner into the lane, and Joe fell off the fence and pulled Dad with him.  Dad damned him and scrambled up again as fast as he could.  After a while Tommy Wilkie hove in sight amid a cloud of dust.  Then came Dave at scarcely faster than a trot, and flogging all he knew with a piece of greenhide plough-rein. Bess was all-out and floundering.  There was about two hundred yards yet to cover.  Dave kept at her--THUD! THUD! Slower and slower she came. \"Damn the fellow!\" Dad said; \"what's he beating her for?\"  \"Stop it, you fool!\" he shouted.  But Dave sat down on her for the final effort and applied the hide faster and faster.  Dad crunched his teeth. Once--twice--three times Bess changed her stride, then struck a branch-root of a tree that projected a few inches above ground, and over she went--CRASH!  Dave fell on his head and lay spread out, motionless.  We picked him up and carried him inside, and when Mother saw blood on him she fainted straight off without waiting to know if it were his own or not. Both looked as good as dead; but Dad, with a bucket of water, soon brought them round again.  It was scarcely dawn when we began preparing for a start to the races. Dave, after spending fully an hour trying in vain to pull on Mother's elastic-side boots, decided to ride in his own heavy bluchers.  We went with Dad in the dray.  Mother would n't go; she said she did n't want to see her son get killed, and warned Dad that if anything happened the blame would for ever be on his head.  We arrived at the Overhaul in good time.  Dad took the horse out of the dray and tied him to a tree.  Dave led Bess about, and we stood and watched the shanty-keeper unpacking gingerbeer.  Joe asked Dad for sixpence to buy some, but Dad had n't any small change.  We remained in front of the booth through most of the day, and ran after any corks that popped out and handed them in again to the shanty-keeper.  He did n't offer us anything--not a thing!  \"Saddle up for the Overhaul Handicap!\" was at last sung out, and Dad, saddle on arm, advanced to where Dave was walking Bess about.  They saddled up and Dave mounted, looking as pale as death.  \"I don't like ridin' in these boots a bit,\" he said, with a quiver in his voice.  \"Wot's up with 'em?\" Dad asked.  \"They're too big altogether.\"  \"Well, take 'em off then!\"  Dave jumped down and pulled them off-leaving his socks on.  More than a dozen horses went out, and when the starter said \"Off!\" did n't they go!  Our eyes at once followed Bess.  Dave was at her right from the jump--the very opposite to what Dad had told him.  In the first furlong she put fully twenty yards of daylight between herself and the field--she came after the field.  At the back of the course you could see the whole of Kyle's selection and two of Jerry Keefe's hay-stacks between her and the others.  We did n't follow her any further.  After the race was won and they had cheered the winner, Dad was n't to be found anywhere.  Dave sat on the grass quite exhausted.  \"Ain't y' goin' to pull the saddle off?\" Joe asked.  \"No,\" he said.  \"I AIN'T.  You don't want everyone to see her back, do you?\"  Joe wished he had sixpence.  About an hour afterwards Dad came staggering along arm-in-arm with another man--an old fencing-mate of his, so he made out.  \"Thur yar,\" he said, taking off his hat and striking Bess on the rump with it; \"besh bred mare in the worl'.\"  The fencing-mate looked at her, but did n't say anything; he could n't.  \"Eh?\" Dad went on; \"say sh'ain't?  L'ere-ever y' name is--betcher pound sh'is.\"  Then a jeering and laughing crowd gathered round, and Dave wished he had n't come to the races.  \"She ain't well,\" said a tall man to Dad--\"short in her gallops.\" Then a short, bulky individual without whiskers shoved his face up into Dad's and asked him if Bess was a mare or a cow.  Dad became excited, and only that old Anderson came forward and took him away there must have been a row.  Anderson put him in the dray and drove it home to Shingle Hut.  Dad reckons now that there is nothing in horse-racing, and declares it a fraud.  He says, further, that an honest man, by training and racing a horse, is only helping to feed and fatten the rogues and vagabonds that live on the sport.     Chapter VII.  Cranky Jack.   It was early in the day.  Traveller after traveller was trudging by Shingle Hut.  One who carried no swag halted at the rails and came in. He asked Dad for a job.  \"I dunno,\" Dad answered--\"What wages would you want?\" The man said he would n't want any.  Dad engaged him at once.  And SUCH a man!  Tall, bony, heavy-jawed, shaven with a reaping-hook, apparently.  He had a thick crop of black hair--shaggy, unkempt, and full of grease, grass, and fragments of dry gum-leaves.  On his head were two old felt hats--one sewn inside the other.  On his back a shirt made from a piece of blue blanket, with white cotton stitches striding up and down it like lines of fencing.  His trousers were gloom itself; they were a problem, and bore reliable evidence of his industry.  No ordinary person would consider himself out of work while in them.  And the new-comer was no ordinary person.  He seemed to have all the woe of the world upon him; he was as sad and weird-looking as a widow out in the wet.  In the yard was a large heap of firewood--remarkable truth!--which Dad told him to chop up.  He began.  And how he worked!  The axe rang again--particularly when it left the handle--and pieces of wood scattered everywhere.  Dad watched him chopping for a while, then went with Dave to pull corn.  For hours the man chopped away without once looking at the sun.  Mother came out.  Joy!  She had never seen so much wood cut before.  She was delighted.  She made a cup of tea and took it to the man, and apologised for having no sugar to put in it.  He paid no attention to her; he worked harder.  Mother waited, holding the tea in her hand.  A lump of wood nearly as big as a shingle flew up and shaved her left ear.  She put the tea on the ground and went in search of eggs for dinner.  (We were out of meat--the kangaroo-dog was lame.  He had got \"ripped\" the last time we killed.)  The tea remained on the ground.  Chips fell into it.  The dog saw it. He limped towards it eagerly, and dipped the point of his nose in it. It burnt him.  An aged rooster strutted along and looked sideways at it. HE distrusted it and went away.  It attracted the pig--a sow with nine young ones.  She waddled up, and poked the cup over with her nose; then she sat down on it, while the family joyously gathered round the saucer. Still the man chopped on.  Mother returned--without any eggs.  She rescued the crockery from the pigs and turned curiously to the man.  She said, \"Why, you've let them take the tea!\"  No answer.  She wondered.  Suddenly, and for the fiftieth time, the axe flew off.  The man held the handle and stared at the woodheap.  Mother watched him.  He removed his hats, and looked inside them.  He remained looking inside them.  Mother watched him more closely.  His lips moved.  He said, \"LISTEN TO THEM!  THEY'RE COMING!  I KNEW THEY'D FOLLOW!\"  \"Who?\" asked Mother, trembling slightly.  \"THEY'RE IN THE WOOD!\" he went on.  \"Ha, ha!  I've got them.  They'll never get out; NEVER GET OUT!\"  Mother fled, screaming.  She ran inside and called the children.  Sal assisted her.  They trooped in like wallabies--all but Joe.  He was away earning money.  He was getting a shilling a week from Maloney, for chasing cockatoos from the corn.  They closed and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3677"],["title","On Our Selection (#5)"],["body","the doors, and Sal took down the gun, which Mother made her hide beneath the bed.  They sat listening, anxiously and intently.  The wind began to rise.  A lump of soot fell from the chimney into the fireplace--where there was no fire.  Mother shuddered. Some more fell.  Mother jumped to her feet.  So did Sal.  They looked at each other in dismay.  The children began to cry.  The chain for hanging the kettle on started swinging to and fro.  Mother's knees gave way.  The chain continued swinging.  A pair of bare legs came down into the fireplace--they were curled round the chain.  Mother collapsed. Sal screamed, and ran to the door, but could n't open it.  The legs left the chain and dangled in the air.  Sal called \"Murder!\"  Her cry was answered.  It was Joe, who had been over at Maloney's making his fortune.  He came to the rescue.  He dropped out of the chimney and shook himself.  Sal stared at him.  He was calm and covered from head to foot with soot and dirt.  He looked round and said, \"Thought yuz could keep me out, did'n'y'?\"  Sal could only look at him. \"I saw yuz all run in,\" he was saying, when Sal thought of Mother, and sprang to her.  Sal shook her, and slapped her, and threw water on her till she sat up and stared about.  Then Joe stared.  Dad came in for dinner--which, of course, was n't ready.  Mother began to cry, and asked him what he meant by keeping a madman on the place, and told him she KNEW he wanted to have them all murdered.  Dad did n't understand.  Sal explained.  Then he went out and told the man to \"Clear!\" The man simply said, \"No.\"  \"Go on, now!\" Dad said, pointing to the rails.  The man smiled at the wood-heap as he worked.  Dad waited.  \"Ain't y' going?\" he repeated.  \"Leave me alone when I'm chopping wood for the missus,\" the man answered; then smiled and muttered to himself.  Dad left him alone and went inside wondering.  Next day Mother and Dad were talking at the barn.  Mother, bare-headed, was holding some eggs in her apron.  Dad was leaning on a hoe.  \"I am AFRAID of him,\" Mother said; \"it's not right you should keep him about the place.  No one's safe with such a man.  Some day he'll take it in his head to kill us all, and then--\"  \"Tut, tut, woman; poor old Jack!  he's harmless as a baby.\"  \"All right,\" (sullenly); \"you'll see!\"  Dad laughed and went away with the hoe on his shoulder to cut burr.  Middle of summer.  Dad and Dave in the paddock mowing lucerne.  Jack sinking post-holes for a milking-yard close to the house.  Joe at intervals stealing behind him to prick him with straws through a rent in the rear of his patched moleskins.  Little Bill--in readiness to run--standing off, enjoying the sport.  Inside the house sat Mother and Sal, sewing and talking of Maloney's new baby.  \"Dear me,\" said Mother; \"it's the tiniest mite of a thing I ever saw; why, bless me, anyone of y' at its age would have made three of--\"  \"MIND, Mother!\" Sal shrieked, jumping up on the sofa.  Mother screamed and mounted the table.  Both gasped for breath, and leaning cautiously over peeped down at a big black snake which had glided in at the front door. Then, pale and scared-looking, they stared across at each other.  The snake crawled over to the safe and drank up some milk which had been spilt on the floor.  Mother saw its full length and groaned.  The snake wriggled to the leg of the table.  \"Look out!\" cried Sal, gathering up her skirts and dancing about on the sofa.  Mother squealed hysterically.  Joe appeared.  He laughed.  \"You wretch!\" Mother yelled.  \"Run!--RUN, and fetch your father!\"  Joe went and brought Jack.  \"Oh-h, my God!\"--Mother moaned, as Jack stood at the door, staring strangely at her.  \"Kill it!--why don't he kill it?\"  Jack did n't move, but talked to himself.  Mother shuddered.  The reptile crawled to the bedroom door.  Then for the first time the man's eyes rested upon it.  It glided into the bedroom, and Mother and Sal ran off for Dad.  Jack fixed his eyes on the snake and continued muttering to himself. Several times it made an attempt to mount the dressing-table.  Finally it succeeded.  Suddenly Jack's demeanour changed.  He threw off his ragged hat and talked wildly.  A fearful expression filled his ugly features. His voice altered.  \"You're the Devil!\" he said; \"THE DEVIL!  THE DEVIL!  The missus brought you--ah-h-h!\"  The snake's head passed behind the looking-glass.  Jack drew nearer, clenching his fists and gesticulating.  As he did he came full before the looking-glass and saw, perhaps for the first time in his life, his own image.  An unearthly howl came from him.  \"ME FATHER!\" he shouted, and bolted from the house.  Dad came in with the long-handled shovel, swung it about the room, and smashed pieces off the cradle, and tore the bed-curtains down, and made a great noise altogether.  Finally, he killed the snake and put it on the fire; and Joe and the cat watched it wriggle on the hot coals.  Meanwhile, Jack, bare-headed, rushed across the yard.  He ran over little Bill, and tumbled through the wire-fence on to the broad of his back. He roared like a wild beast, clutched at space, spat, and kicked his heels in the air.  \"Let me up!---AH-H-H!--let go me throat!\" he hissed.  The dog ran over and barked at him.  He found his feet again, and, making off, ran through the wheat, glancing back over his shoulder as he tore along.  He crossed into the grass paddock, and running to a big tree dodged round and round it.  Then from tree to tree he went, and that evening at sundown, when Joe was bringing the cows home, Jack was still flying from \"his father\".  After supper.  \"I wonder now what the old fool saw in that snake to send him off his head like that?\" Dad said, gazing wonderingly into the fire.  \"He sees plenty of them, goodness knows.\"  \"That was n't it.  It was n't the snake at all,\" Mother said; \"there was madness in the man's eyes all the while.  I saw it the moment he came to the door.\" She appealed to Sal.  \"Nonsense!\" said Dad; \"NONSENSE!\" and he tried to laugh.  \"Oh, of course it's NONSENSE,\" Mother went on; \"everything I say is nonsense.  It won't be nonsense when you come home some day and find us all on the floor with our throats cut.\"  \"Pshaw!\" Dad answered; \"what's the use of talking like that?\" Then to Dave:  \"Go out and see if he's in the barn!\"  Dave fidgetted.  He did n't like the idea.  Joe giggled.  \"Surely you're not FRIGHTENED?\" Dad shouted.  Dave coloured up.  \"No--don't think so,\" he said; and, after a pause, \"YOU go and see.\"  It was Dad's turn to feel uneasy.  He pretended to straighten the fire, and coughed several times.  \"Perhaps it's just as well,\" he said, \"to let him be to-night.\"  Of course, Dad was n't afraid; he SAID he was n't, but he drove the pegs in the doors and windows before going to bed that night.  Next morning, Dad said to Dave and Joe, \"Come 'long, and we'll see where he's got to.\"  In a gully at the back of the grass-paddock they found him.  He was ploughing--sitting astride the highest limb of a fallen tree, and, in a hoarse voice and strange, calling out--\"Gee, Captain!--come here, Tidy!--WA-AY!\"  \"Blowed if I know,\" Dad muttered, coming to a standstill.  \"Wonder if he is clean mad?\"  Dave was speechless, and Joe began to tremble.  They listened.  And as the man's voice rang out in the quiet gully and the echoes rumbled round the ridge and the affrighted birds flew up, the place felt eerie somehow.  \"It's no use bein' afraid of him,\" Dad went on.  \"We must go and bounce him, that's all.\" But there was a tremor in Dad's voice which Dave did n't like.  \"See if he knows us, anyway.\"--and Dad shouted, \"HEY-Y!\"  Jack looked up and immediately scrambled from the limb.  That was enough for Dave.  He turned and made tracks.  So did Dad and Joe.  They ran. No one could have run harder.  Terror overcame Joe.  He squealed and grabbed hold of Dad's shirt, which was ballooning in the wind.  \"Let go!\" Dad gasped.  \"DAMN Y', let me GO!  \"--trying to shake him off. But Joe had great faith in his parent, and clung to him closely.  When they had covered a hundred yards or so, Dave glanced back, and seeing that Jack was n't pursuing them, stopped and chuckled at the others.  \"Eh?\" Dad said, completely winded--\"Eh?\"  Then to Dave, when he got some breath:  \"Well, you ARE an ass of a fellow.  (PUFF!).  What th' DEVIL did y' RUN f'?\"  \"Wot did I run f'?  What did YOU run f'?\"  \"Bah!\" and Dad boldly led the way back.  \"Now look here (turning fiercely upon Joe), don't you come catching hold of me again, or if y' DO I'll knock y'r d--d head off!...Clear home altogether, and get under the bed if y're as frightened as THAT.\"  Joe slunk behind.  But when Dad DID approach Jack, which was n't until he had talked a great deal to him across a big log, the latter did n't show any desire to take life, but allowed himself to be escorted home and locked in the barn quietly enough.  Dad kept Jack confined in the barn several days, and if anyone approached the door or the cracks he would ask:  \"Is me father there yet?\"  \"Your father's dead and buried long ago, man,\" Dad used to tell him.  \"Yes,\" he would say, \"but he's alive again.  The missus keeps him in there\"--indicating the house.  And sometimes when Dad was not about Joe would put his mouth to a crack and say:  \"Here's y'r FATHER, Jack!\"  Then, like a caged beast, the man would howl and tramp up and down, his eyes starting  out of his head, while Joe would bolt inside and tell Mother that \"Jack's getting out,\", and nearly send her to her grave.  But one day Jack DID get out, and, while Mother and Sal were ironing came to the door with the axe on his shoulder.  They dropped the irons and shrank into a corner and cowered piteously--too scared even to cry out.  He took no notice of them, but, moving stealthily on tip-toes, approached the bedroom door and peeped in.  He paused just a moment to grip the axe with both hands.  Then with a howl and a bound he entered the room and shattered the "]]]
