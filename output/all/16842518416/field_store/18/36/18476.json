The chlorides of iron are FeCl2 and Fe2Cl6. In the latter, it might be supposed that the quantivalence of Fe is 3, but the graphic symbol shows it to be 4.

A Radical is a Group of Elements which has no separate existence, but enters into combination like a single atom; e.g. (NO3) in the compounds HNO3 or KNO3; (SO4) in H2SO4. In HNO3 the radical has a valence of 1, to balance that of H, H-NO3). In H2SO4, what is the valence of (SO4)? Give it in each of these radicals, noting first that of the first element: K(NO3), Na2(SO4), Na2(CO3), K(ClO3), H3(PO4), Ca3(PO4)2, Na4(SiO4).  Suppose we wish to know the symbol for calcium phosphate. Ca and PO4 are the two parts. In H3(PO4) the radical is a triad, to balance H3. Ca is a dyad, Ca==(P04). The least common multiple of the bonds (2 and 3) is 6, which, divided by 2 (no. Ca bonds), gives 3 (no. Ca atoms to be taken). 6 / 3 (no. (PO4) bonds) gives 2 (no. PO4 radicals to be taken). Hence the symbol Ca3(P04)2. Verify this by writing graphically.  Write symbols for the union of Mg and (SO4), Na and (PO4), Zn and (NO3), K and (NO3), K and (SO4), Mg and (PO4), Fe and (SO4) (both valences of Fe), Fe and (NO3), taking the valences of the radicals from HNO3, H2SO4, H3PO4.  Chapter XII.  ELECTRO-CHEMICAL RELATION OF ELEMENTS.  58. Examine untarnished pieces of iron, silver, nickel, lead, etc.; also quartz, resin, silk, wood, paper. Notice that from the first four light is reflected in a different way from that of the others. This property of reflecting light is known as luster. Metals have a metallic luster which is peculiar to themselves; and this, for the present, may be regarded as their chief characteristic. Are they at the positive or negative end of the list? See page 43. How is it with the non-metals? This arrangement has a significance in chemistry which we must now examine. The three appended experiments show how one metal can be withdrawn from solution by a second, this second by a third, the third by a fourth, and so on. For expedition, three pupils can work together for the three following experiments, each doing one, and examining the results of the others.  59. Deposition of Silver.  Experiment 35.--Put a ten-cent Ag coin into an evaporating-dish, and pour over it a mixture of 5 cc. HNO3 and 10 cc. H2O. Warm till all, or nearly all, the Ag dissolves. Remove the lamp. 3 Ag + 4 HNO3 = 3 AgNO3 + 2 H2O + NO. Then add 10 cc. H2O, and at once put in a short piece of Cu wire, or a cent. Leave till quite a deposit appears, then pour off the liquid, wash the deposit thoroughly, and remove it from the coin. See whether the metal resembles Ag. 2 AgNO3 + Cu =?60. Deposition of Copper.  Experiment 36.--Dissolve a cent or some Cu turnings in dilute HNO3, as in Experiment 35, and dilute the solution. 3 Cu + 8 HN09 - 3 Cu (NOA+4 H2O+2 NO.)  Then put in a clean strip of Pb, and set aside as before, examining the deposit finally. Cu(NO3), + Pb - ?  61. Deposition of Lead.  Experiment 37.--Perform this experiment in the same manner as the two previous ones, dissolving a small piece of Pb, and using a strip of Zn to precipitate the Pb. 3 Pb + 8 HNO3 - 3 Pb (NO4)2 + 4 Ha0 + 2 NO. Pb (NO3) 2 + Zn = ? h.  62. Explanation. -These experiments show that Cu will replace Ag in a solution of AgNO3, that Pb will replace and deposit Cu from a similar compound, and that Zn will deposit Pb in the same way. They show that the affinity of Zn for (NO3) is stronger than either Ag, Cu, or Pb. We. express this affinity by saying that Zn is the most positive of the four metals, while Ag is the most nega- tive. Cu is positive to Ag, but negative to Pb and Zn. Which of the four elements are positive to Pb, and which negative? Mg would withdraw Zn from a similar solution, and be in its turn withdrawn by Na. The table on page 43 is founded on this relation. A given element is positive to every element above it in the list, and negative to all below it.  Metals are usually classed as positive, non-metals as negative. Each in union with O and 1=I gives rise to a very important class of compounds,=--the negative to acids, the positive to bases.  In the following, note whether the positive or the negative element is written first:--HCl, Na20,-As2S3, -MgBr2, Ag2S. Na2SO4 is made up of two parts, Na2 being positive, the radical SO4 negative. Like elements, radicals are either positive or negative. In the following, separate the positive element from the negative radical by a vertical line: Na2CO3, NaNO3, ZnSO4, KClO3.  The most common positive radical is NH4, ammonium, as in NH4Cl. It always deports itself as a metal. The commonest radical is the negative OH, called hydroxyl, from hydrogen- oxygen. Take away H from the symbol of water, H-O-H, and hydroxyl --(OH) with one free bond is left. If an element takes the place of H, i.e. unites with OH, the compound is called a hydrate. KOH is potassium hydrate. Name NaOH, Ca(OH)2, NH4OH, Zn(OH)2, Al2(OH)6. Is the first part of each symbol above positive or negative?  H has an intermediate place in the list. It is a constituent of both acids and bases, and of the neutral substance, water.  ORDER.  --   Negative or Non-Metallic Elements. Acid-forming with H(usually OH).

The following experiment is to be performed only by the teacher, but pupils should make drawings and explain.  63. Decomposition of Water.  Experiment 38.--Arrange \"in series\" two or more cells of a Bunsen battery (Physics, page 164), [References are made in this book to Gage's Introduction to Physical Science.] and attach the terminal wires to an electrolytic apparatus (Fig. 19) filled with water made slightly acid with H2SO4. Construct a diagram of the apparatus, marking the Zn in the liquid +, since it is positive, and the C, or other element, -. Mark the electrode attached to the Zn -, and that attached to the C +; positive electricity at one end of a body commonly implies negative at the other. Opposites attract, while like electricities repel each other. These analogies will aid the memory. At the + electrode is the - element of H2O, and at the - electrode the + element. Note, page 43, whether H or O is positive with reference to the other, and write the symbol for each at the proper electrode. Compare the diagram with the apparatus, to verify your conclusion. Why does gas collect twice as fast at one electrode as at the other? What does this prove of the composition of water? When filled, test the gases in each tube, for O and H, with a burning stick. Electrical analysis is called electrolysis.  If a solution of NaCl be electrolyzed, which element will go to the + pole? Which, if the salt were K2SO4? Explain these reactions in the electrolysis of that salt. K2SO4 = K2 + S03 + O. SO4 is unstable, and breaks up into SO3 and O. Both K and SO3 have great affinity for water. K2 + 2 H2O = 2 KOH + H2. S03 + H2O = H2SO4.  The base KOH would be found at the - electrode, and the acid H2SO4 at the + electrode.  The positive portion, K, uniting with H2O forms a base; the negative part, S03, with H2O forms an acid. Of what does this show a salt to be composed?  64. Conclusions.--These experiments show (1) that at the + electrode there always appears the negative element, or radical, of the compound, and at the - electrode the positive element; (2) that these elements unite with those of water, to make, in the former case, acids, in the latter, bases; (3) that acids and bases differ as negative and positive elements differ, each being united with O and H, and yet producing compounds of a directly opposite character; (4) that salts are really compounded of acids and bases. This explains why salts are usually inactive and neutral in character, while acids and bases are active agents. Thus we see why the most positive or the most negative elements in general have the strongest affinities, while those intermediate in the list are inactive, and have weak affinities; why alloys of the metals are weak compounds; why a neutral substance, like water, has such a weak affinity for the salts which it holds in solution; and why an aqueous solution is regarded as a mechanical mixture rather than a chemical compound. In this view, the division line between chemistry and physics is not a distinct one. These will be better understood after studying the chapters on acids, bases and salts.  Chapter XIV.  UNION BY VOLUME.  66. Avogadro's Law of Gases.--Equal volumes of all gases, the temperature and pressure being the same, have the same number of molecules. This law is the foundation of modern chemistry. A cubic centimeter of O has as many molecules as a cubic centimeter of H, a liter of N the same number as a liter of steam, under similar conditions. Compare the number of molecules in 5 l. of N2O with that in 10 l. Cl. 7 cc. vapor of I to 6 cc. vapor of S. The half-molecules of two gases have, of course, the same relation to each other, and in elements the half-molecule is usually the atom.  The molecular volumes--molecules and the surrounding space--of all gases must therefore be equal, as must the half-volumes. Notice that this law applies only to gases, not to liquids or solids. Let us apply it to the experiment for the electrolysis of water. In this we found twice as much H by volume as O. Evidently, then, steam has twice as many molecules of H as of O,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],["title","An Introduction to Chemical Science (#8)"],["body","twice as many half-molecules, or atoms. If the molecule has one atom of O, it must have two of H, and the formula will be H2O.  Suppose we reverse the process and synthesize steam, which can be done by passing an electric spark through a mixture of H and O in a eudiometer over mercury; we should need to take twice as much H as O. Now when 2 cc. of H combine thus with 1 cc. of O, only 2 cc.of steam are produced. Three volumes are condensed into two volumes, and of course three molecular volumes into two, three atomic volumes into two. This may be written as follows:--  H + H + O = H2O.  This is a condensation of one-third.  If 2 l. of chlorhydric acid gas be analyzed, there will result 1 l. of H and 1 l. of Cl. The same relation exists between the molecules and the atoms, and the reaction is:--  HCl = H + Cl.  Reverse the process, and 1 l. of H unites with 1 l. of Cl to produce 2 l. of the acid gas; there is no condensation, and the symbol is HCl. In seven volumes HCl how many of each constituent?  The combination of two volumes of H with one volume of S is found to produce two volumes of hydrogen sulphide. Therefore two atoms of H combine with one of S to form a molecule whose symbol is H2S.  H + H + S = H2S.  What is the condensation in this case?  PROBLEMS.  (1) How many liters of S will it take to unite with 4 l. of H? How much H2S will be formed?  (2) How many liters of H will it take to combine with 5 l. of S? How much H2S results?  (3) In 6 l. H2S how many liters H, and how much S? Prove.  (4) In four volumes H2S how many volumes of each constituent?  (5) If three volumes of H be mixed with two volumes of S, so as to make H2S, how much will be formed? How much of either element will be left? An analysis of 2 cc. of ammonia gives 1 cc. N and 3 cc. H. The symbol must then be NH3, the reaction,--  NH3 = N + H + H + H.  What condensation in the synthesis of NH3?  In 12 cc. NH3 how many cubic centimeters of each element? In 2 1/2 cc? How much H by volume is required to combine with nine volumes of N? How many volumes of NH3 are produced?  In elements that have not been weighed in the gaseous state, as C, the evidence of atomic volume is not direct, but we will assume it. Thus two volumes of marsh gas would separate into one of C and four of H. What is its symbol and supposed condensation? Two volumes of alcohol vapor resolve into two of C, six of H, and one of O. What is its symbol? its condensation?  The symbol itself of a compound will usually show what its condensation is; e.g. HCl, HBr, HF, etc., have two atoms; hence there will be no shrinkage. In H2O, SO2, CO2, the molecule has three atoms condensed into the space of two, or one-third shrinkage. In NH3 four volumes are crowded into the space of two, a condensation of one-half.  P, As, Hg, Zn, have exceptional atomic volumes.  Chapter XV.  ACIDS AND BASES.  66. What Acids Are.  Experiment 39.--Pour a few drops of chlorhydric acid, HCl, into a clean evaporating-dish. Add 5 cc. H2O, and stir. Touch a drop to the tongue, noting the taste. Dip into it the end of a piece of blue litmus paper, and record the result. Thoroughly wash the dish, then pour in a few drops of nitric acid, HNO3, and 5 cc. H2O, and stir. Taste, and test with blue litmus. Test in the same way sulphuric acid, H2SO4. Name two characteristics of an acid. In a vertical line write the formulae of the acids above. What element is common to them all? Is the rest of the formula positive or negative?  67. An Acid is a substance composed of H and a negative element or radical. It has usually a sour taste, and turns blue litmus red. Litmus is a vegetable extract obtained from lichens in Southern Europe. Acids have the same action on many other vegetable pigments. Are the following acid formulae, and why? H2SO3, HBr, HNO2, H3PO3, H4SiO4. Most acids have O as well as H. Complete the symbols for acids in the following list, and name them, from the type given:--    HCl, chlorhydric acid.    HN03, nitric acid. ?Br,      ?            ?Cl?       ? ?I,          ?            ?Br?       ? ?F,          ?             ?I?        ? H3PO4, phosphoric acid.    H3PO3, phosphorous acid. ?As?      ?             ?As?       ?  Complete these equations:--  H2SO3 - H2O = ?       |       2 HN03 - H2O = ? H2SO4 - H2O = ?       |       2 HNO2 - H2O = ? H2CO3 - H2O = ?       |       2 H3AsO4 - 3 H2O = ?   Are the products in each case metallic or non-metallic oxides? They are called anhydrides. Notice that each is formed by the withdrawal of water from an acid. Reverse the equations; as, SO3 + H2O = ?  68. An Anhydride is what remains after water has been removed from an acid; or, it is the oxide of a non- metallic element, which, united with water, forms an acid. SO2 is sulphurous anhydride, SO2 sulphuric anhydride, the ending ic meaning more O, or negative element, than ous. Name the others above.  Anhydrides were formerly called acids,--anhydrous acids, in distinction from hydrated ones, as CO2 even now is often called carbonic acid.  Experiment 40.--Hold a piece of wet blue litmus paper in the fumes of SO2, and note the acid test. Try the same with dry litmus paper.  Experiment 41.--Burn a little S in a receiver of air containing 10 cc. H2O, and loosely covered, as in the O experiment. Then shake to dissolve the SO2. H2O + SO2 = H2SO3. Apply test paper.  69. Naming Acids.--Compare formulae H2SO3 and H2SO4. Of two acids having the same elements, the name of the one with least O, or negative element, ends in ous, the other in ic. H2SO3 is sulphurous acid, H2SO4, sulphuric acid. Name H3PO4 and H3PO3; H3AsO3 and H3ASO4; HNO2 and HNO3.  If there are more than two acids in a series, the prefixes hypo, less, and per, more, are used. The following is such a series: HClO, HClO2, HClO3, HClO4.  HClO3 is chloric acid; HClO2, chlorous; HClO, hypochlorous; HClO4 perchloric. Hypo means less of the negative element than ous; per means more of the negative element than ic. Name: H3PO4 (ic), H3PO3, H3PO2. Also HBrO (HBrO2 does not exist), HBrO3 (ic), HBrO4.  What are the three most negative elements? Note their occurrence in the three strongest and most common acids. Hereafter note the names and symbols of all the acids you see.  70. What Bases Are.  Experiment 42.--Put a few drops of NH4OH into an evaporating- dish. Add 5 cc. H2O, and stir. Taste a drop. Dip into it a piece of red litmus paper, noting the effect. Cleanse the dish, and treat in the same way a few drops NaOH solution, recording the result. Do the same with KOH. Acid stains on the clothing, with the exception of those made by HNO3, maybe removed by NH4OH. H2SO4, however, rapidly destroys the fiber of the cloth.  Name two characteristics of a base. In the formulae of those bases, what two common elements? Name the radical. Compare those symbols with the symbol for water, HOH. Is (OH) positive or negative? Is the other part of each formula positive or negative? What are two constituents, then, of a base? Bases are called hydrates. Write in a vertical line five positive elements. Note the valence of each, and complete the formula for its base. Affix the names. Can you see any reason why the three bases above given are the strongest?  Taking the valences of Cr and Fe, write symbols for two sets of hydrates, and name them. Try to recognize and name every base hereafter met with.  A Base is a substance which is composed of a metal, or positive radical, and OH. It generally turns red litmus blue, and often has an acrid taste.  An Alkali is a base which is readily soluble in water. The three principal alkalies are NH4OH, KOH, and NaOH.  Alkali Metals are those which form alkalies. Name three.  An Alkaline Reaction is the turning of red litmus blue.  An Acid Reaction is the turning of blue litmus red.  Experiment 43.--Pour 5 cc. of a solution of litmus in water, into a clean t.t. or small beaker. Pour 2 or 3 cc. of HCl into an evaporating-dish, and the same quantity of NH4OH into another dish. Take a drop of the HCl on a stirring-rod and stir the litmus solution with it. Note the acid reaction. Clean the rod, and with it take a drop (or more if necessary) of NH4OH, and add this to the red litmus solution, noting the alkaline reaction. Experiment in the same way with the two other principal acids and the two other alkalies.  Litmus paper is commonly used to test these reactions, and hereafter whenever the term LITMUS is employed in that sense, the test-paper should be understood. This paper can be prepared by dipping unglazed paper into a strong aqueous solution of litmus.  CHAPTER XVI.  SALTS.  71. Acids and Bases are usually Opposite in Character.--When two forces act in opposition they tend to neutralize each other. We may see an analogy to this in the union of the two opposite classes of compounds, acids and bases, to form salts.  72. Neutralization.  Experiment 44.--Put into an evaporating-dish 5 cc. of NaOH solution. Add HCl to this from a t.t., a few drops at a time, stirring the mixture with a glass rod (Fig. 20), and testing it with litmus paper, until the liquid is neutral, i.e. will not turn the test paper from blue to red, or red to blue. Test with both colors. If it turns blue to red, too much acid has been added; if red to blue, too much base. When it is very nearly neutral, add the reagent, HCl or NaOH, a drop at a time with the stirring-rod. It must be absolutely neutral to both colors. Evaporate the water by heating the dish over asbestus paper, wire gauze, or sand, in an iron plate (Fig. 21) till the residue becomes dry and white. Cool the residue, taste, and name it. The equation is: HCl + NaOH = NaCl + HOH or H2O. Note which elements, positive or negative, change places. Why was the liquid boiled? The residue is a type of a large class of compounds, called salts.  (Fig. 20)                           (Fig. 21)  Experiment 45. -- Experiment in the same way with KOH solution and H2SO4, applying the same tests. H2SO4 + 2 KOH = K2SO4 + 2 HOH. What is the solid"]]]
