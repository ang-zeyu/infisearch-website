Occurring sympatrically with _Ptychohyla euthysanota euthysanota_ are several species of _Plectrohyla_, all of which differ in having a bony prepollex, rather rugose skin on the dorsum, and more squat bodies. Other sympatric species are _Ptychohyla schmidtorum schmidtorum_, which lacks a tarsal fold and nuptial spines and has a red eye in life, _Hyla salvadorensis_, which has a green dorsum and lacks spinous nuptial tuberosities, and _Hyla sumichrasti_, a small yellow frog usually lacking vomerine teeth.   _Life History._--This subspecies breeds in clear, swift mountain streams. Males call from stems and leaves of plants at the edge of, or overhanging, the streams. The breeding call consists of a soft \"wraack,\" repeated at intervals of three to four seconds. Each note has a duration of 0.60 to 0.65 seconds and has 91 to 102 pulses per second; the dominant frequency falls between 3000 and 3200 cycles per second.  Tadpoles in various stages of development were found at Finca La Paz, Guatemala, in late July. This indicates that there is either extreme differential growth, or, more probably, an extended breeding season. A tadpole having a body length of 6.8 mm. and a total length of 19.1 mm. has a short median first upper tooth-row; lower tooth-rows 3-6 are only two-thirds as long as lower rows 1 and 2. Two recently metamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 14.2 and 14.8 mm.; they are colored like the adults.  _Remarks._--The type specimen of _Hyla euthysanota_ Kellogg (1928:123) is a female; therefore, when Taylor (1944) proposed the name _Ptychohyla_ for hylids having ventrolateral glands in breeding males, he was unaware that _Hyla euthysanota_ was a member of this group. In his description of _Hyla rozellae_, Taylor (1942) did not compare his specimens with _Hyla euthysanota_, but instead placed _H. rozellae_ with _H. loquax_ and _H. rickardsi_. The type series of _H. rozellae_ consists of one large adult female and several metamorphosing young. Taylor (1949:16) based the description of _Ptychohyla bogerti_ on two males and compared these specimens with _P. adipoventris_ Taylor [= _P. leonhardschultzei_ (Ahl)]. Thus, in a period of 22 years the females of this species were given two names and the male another. Stuart (1954:169) suggested that _Hyla euthysanota_ and _Hyla rozellae_ were _Ptychohyla_. Now that sufficient specimens are available from throughout the range it is possible to determine that the various named populations are conspecific.  _Distribution._--This subspecies inhabits cloud forests at elevations of 660 to 2200 meters on the Pacific slopes of the Sierra Madre from extreme eastern Oaxaca and western Chiapas, México, through Guatemala to northern El Salvador; probably it occurs also in southwestern Honduras. Aside from the specimens listed below, three in the Frankfurt Museum from Depto.

Hist., 13:351, April 27, 1961.   _Diagnosis._--Dorsum usually pale tan; venter white with scattered brown or black flecks; a thin white stripe on upper lip and another above anal opening; no distinct white stripe on flanks.  _Description._--The following description is based on KU 58049 from Linda Vista, Chiapas, México (Pl. 13). Adult male having a snout-vent length of 38.0 mm.; tibia length, 19.5 mm.; tibia length/snout-vent length, 51.3 per cent; foot length, 15.7 mm.; head length, 11.8 mm.; head length/snout-vent length, 31.1 per cent; head width, 11.7 mm.; head width/snout-vent length, 30.8 per cent; diameter of eye, 3.8 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 2.1 mm.; tympanum/eye, 55.2 per cent. Snout in lateral profile nearly square, slightly rounded above, and in dorsal profile bluntly rounded; canthus pronounced; loreal region concave; lips thick, rounded, and slightly flaring; nostrils protuberant; internarial distance, 3.1 mm.; top of head flat; interorbital distance, 3.8 mm., and approximately a fourth broader than width of eyelid, 3.1 mm. A moderately heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye above tympanum to point above insertion of forelimb, covering upper edge of tympanum; tympanum round, its diameter equal to its distance from eye. Forearm moderately robust, having a distinct dermal fold on wrist; dermal fold, but no row of tubercles along ventrolateral surface of forearm; pollex only slightly enlarged, bearing triangular patch of small horn covered spines (94 on right, 100 on left); fourth finger slightly longer than second; subarticular tubercles round, none bifid; discs moderate in size, that of third finger equal to diameter of tympanum; vestige of web between first and second fingers; other fingers one-third webbed. Heels broadly overlap when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation reaches to middle of eye; weak tarsal fold on distal two-thirds of tarsus; inner metatarsal tubercle large, elliptical, and flat; outer metatarsal tubercle small and round; no dermal fold from heel to disc of fifth toe; subarticular tubercles round; length of digits from shortest to longest 1-2-5-3-4; third toe webbed to base of disc; fifth toe webbed to middle of penultimate phalanx; fourth toe webbed to proximal end of penultimate phalanx; no fold of skin from inner metatarsal tubercle to base of disc on first toe; discs much smaller than on fingers. Anal opening near upper edge of thighs; short anal flap bordered above by thin dermal fold; small tubercles and heavy dermal fold lateral to anal opening. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of fore limbs and shanks smooth; that of throat, belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs granular. Ventrolateral glands weakly developed, not reaching axilla or groin and broadly separated midventrally. Tongue ovoid, shallowly notched posteriorly, and barely free behind; vomerine teeth 2-2, situated on small triangular elevations between ovoid inner nares; openings to vocal sac large, one situated along inner posterior edge of each mandibular ramus.  Dorsal ground-color of head, body, and limbs pale pinkish tan with the greatest part of head and body covered by large gray interconnected blotches; black flecks over most of dorsum; grayish brown transverse bands on shanks; dorsal surfaces of first and second fingers pale grayish yellow; dorsal surfaces of third and fourth fingers and webbing on hand pale grayish tan; anterior surfaces of thighs pale flesh-color; posterior surfaces of thighs pale grayish yellow; dorsal surfaces of tarsi and toes pale grayish tan with black flecks; webbing of feet pale gray; faint creamy white stripes along ventrolateral edges of tarsi and forearms; a very thin white line along edge of upper lip; a narrow grayish white stripe above anal opening; axilla gray; throat, chest, belly, and ventral surfaces of forelimbs pale grayish white; ventral surfaces of hind limbs cream color; flanks gray flecked with brown; ventral surfaces of feet grayish tan; ventrolateral glands pinkish tan; anterior one-half of chin flecked with brown.  In life the dorsum was pale tan (Pinkish Buff); the dark markings on dorsum dull brown (Tawny-Olive); tarsi pale tan (Pale Pinkish Buff); flanks pinkish tan (Pale Cinnamon-Pink); iris coppery bronze (Capucine Orange).  _Variation._--The few specimens from a limited geographic region preclude any analysis of geographic variation. All specimens, except the one described above, have the fifth toe webbed to the base of the disc. Many individuals have a bifid subarticular tubercle beneath the fourth finger. The shape of the posterior edge of the tongue varies from nearly straight and shallowly notched to bluntly rounded and emarginate. Two females (KU 58050-1) have more pointed snouts in dorsal profile than do males.  Some specimens, such as KU 58048, are notably darker than the specimen described above; in dark specimens the dorsum is brown with dark brown markings; all fingers and the webbing on the hand are brown. The tarsi and feet are like those in the specimen described above, but the posterior surfaces of the thighs are yellowish tan heavily suffused with brown;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],["title","A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#6)"],["body"," the venter is cream color. In life KU 58048 had a brown (Verona Brown) dorsum with dark brown (Chocolate) markings. KU 58047 is slightly darker than KU 58048 and has scattered small white flecks on the dorsum. All specimens have the thin white line on the upper lip, but in some individuals it is indistinct. The grayish white line above the anus is present in all specimens.  _Description of Tadpole._--The following description is based on KU 60049 from Río Hondo, 9.5 kilometers south of Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán, Chiapas, México (Figs. 4B and 6B). No limb buds; total length, 36.2 mm.; body length, 11.1 mm.; body length/total length, 30.6 per cent. Body moderately depressed, slightly wider than deep, ovoid in dorsal profile; mouth directed ventrally; eyes small, directed dorsolaterally; nostrils slightly protuberant and directed anteriorly, somewhat closer to eye than snout; spiracle sinistral and posteroventrad to eye; anal tube dextral. Caudal fin low, acutely rounded posteriorly; depth of caudal musculature slightly more than one-half greatest depth of caudal fin; caudal musculature extending nearly to tip of tail.  Mouth large; lips having deep lateral folds; two complete rows of papillae on lips; five or six rows of papillae laterally. Beaks moderately developed, bearing small peglike serrations; moderately wide lateral projections on upper beak; tooth-rows 4/6; upper rows subequal in length; fourth row interrupted medially; length of lower rows 1-4 subequal to upper rows; fifth and sixth lower rows decreasing in length; first lower row interrupted medially.  Body brown above; tip of snout cream color; venter creamy white; caudal musculature creamy tan; caudal fin transparent; cream-colored crescent-shaped mark on posterior edge of body and anterior part of caudal musculature, bordered posterodorsally by dark brown blotch; four dark brown blotches on dorsum of anterior part of caudal musculature; scattered brown flecks on caudal musculature and fin; eye silvery bronze in life.  _Variation._--The variation in size and proportions is given in Table 2. All specimens have 4/6 tooth-rows; in some the first lower row is interrupted medially. Specimens from Jacaltenango and two kilometers west of San Pedro Necta, Depto. Huehuetenango, Guatemala, have weakly developed sixth lower tooth-rows.  The cream-colored crescent-shaped mark is distinct in all specimens; the dorsal blotches on the anterior part of the caudal musculature are narrow and do not extend far onto the sides of the tail. The blotches are most distinct in small tadpoles and sometimes indistinct in large ones.  _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla euthysanota macrotympanum_ can be distinguished from both _P. spinipollex_ and _P. leonhardschultzei_ by the absence of bold black and white marbling on the flanks, as well as by the characters given in the diagnosis; furthermore, from the former it differs in having more and smaller horny nuptial tuberosities and from the latter by having the snout, in lateral profile, rounded above instead of angulate. _Ptychohyla euthysanota macrotympanum_ differs from _P. e. euthysanota_ by normally having a paler dorsum, narrower stripe on upper lip, and no distinct lateral stripe.  _Ptychohyla euthysanota macrotympanum_ occurs sympatrically with _Plectrohyla guatemalensis_ and _P. matudai matudai_. Each of the last two has a bony prepollex, rather rugose skin on the dorsum, and more squat body. Other sympatric species are _Hyla walkeri_, which has a green dorsum with brown markings and a rather pointed snout, and _Hyla sumichrasti_, a small yellow frog usually lacking vomerine teeth.  _Life History._--This species breeds in clear mountain streams in mixed pine and broad-leafed forest. Males call from trees and bushes along the streams. The breeding call consists of a soft \"wraack,\" repeated three to nine times with intervals of 2.7 to 3.4 seconds between notes. Each note has a duration of 0.60 to 0.65 second, and a rate of 92 to 100 pulses per second; the dominant frequency falls between 3000 and 3200 cycles per second (Pl. 11B). The call is indistinguishable from that of _P. e. euthysanota_.  Tadpoles in various stages of development were found in the Río Hondo, Chiapas, on June 16, 1960. The smallest tadpole has a total length of 24.1 mm.; in this individual the sixth lower tooth row has barely started to develop. A metamorphosing frog taken at the same time has a snout-vent length of 19.8 mm., a short remnant of the tail, and the mouth and tongue developed, whereas another individual having a snout-vent length of 17.8 mm. and a tail 31.0 mm. in length still has larval teeth. Three completely metamorphosed juveniles collected by L. C. Stuart at Jacaltenango, Guatemala, on June 6 and 7, 1955, have snout-vent lengths of 16.0, 16.0, and 16.1 mm.  _Remarks._--Tanner (1957:52) based the description of _Hyla macrotympanum_ on a single female, which, of course, lacked the characters diagnostic of _Ptychohyla_. On the basis of general external characters Tanner suggested that _Hyla macrotympanum_ was related to _H. miotympanum_, from which it differed in having a larger tympanum and a bifid subarticular tubercle beneath the fourth finger. The collection of additional females, together with males of the species, has shown that _Hyla macrotympanum_ is a _Ptychohyla_.  Intergradation between _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ and _P. macrotympanum_ has not been demonstrated. Currently their ranges are separated by the dry valleys of the Río Grijalva and Río Cuilco. The similarity in structure of the adults and tadpoles and the indistinguishable breeding calls are the basis for considering the two populations subspecies.  _Distribution._--This species occurs in mixed pine and broad-leafed forests at elevations of 700 to 1700 meters on the southern slopes of the Chiapan Highlands and Sierra de Cuchumatanes, in Guatemala. These forests are on the south facing slopes north of the valleys of the Río Grijalva and Río Cuilco.  _Specimens examined._--MEXICO: _Chiapas_: 6 km. NE of Chiapa de Corzo, TCWC 16183; 16 km.
