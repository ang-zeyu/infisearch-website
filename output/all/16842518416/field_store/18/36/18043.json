A broken nose, with the desired accomplishment of a pair of black eyes, and in all cases, when manageable, a good smash in the regions either of the teeth, or of the ribs--both, if possible, preferred--was supposed to improve the transaction so much, that, what with the tooth dropping, or the rib cracking, or both, as aforesaid, it was considered 'settled.'  Thus originated the special title of 'rowdy mob,' or Tipperary, in reference to the Irish.  Let us have the title clear.  The 'shepherding,' that is the squatting by one man women and children had not got hold of this 'Dolce far niente' yet--the ground allotted by law to four men; and the astuteness of our primitive shepherds having found it cheap and profitable to have each claim visibly separated from the other by some twenty-feet wall, which was mutually agreed upon by themselves alone, to call it 'spare ground,' was now a grown-up institution.  Hence, whenever the gutter, 120 feet below, took it into its head to bestir and hook it, the faithful shepherds would not rest until they were sure to snore in peace a foot and a half under ground from the surface, and six score feet from 'bang on the gutter.'  This Ballaarat dodge would have been innocent enough, were it not for 'Young Ireland,' who, having fixed headquarters on the Eureka, was therefore accused of monopolising the concern.  Now, suppose Paddy wanted to relish a 'tip,' that is, a drop of gin on the sly, then Scotty, who had just gulped down his 'toddy,' which was a drop of auld whisky, would take upon himself the selfish trouble to sink six inches more in Paddy's hole, which feat was called 'jumping;' and thus, broken noses, and other accomplishments, as aforesaid, grew in proportion to tips, and 'toddy' drunk on the sly.  I frequently saw horrid scenes of blood; but I was now an old chum and therefore knew what was what in colonial life.  I had a Cameleon for a neighbour, who, in the garb of an Irishman, flung his three half-shovels out of a hole on the hill punctually every morning, and that was his work before breakfast.  Then, a red shirt on his back, and a red cap on his head, he would, in the subsequent hour, give evidence of his scorning to be lazy by putting down some three inches deeper another hole below in the gully.  'Full stop;' he must have a 'blow,' but the d----d things--his matches--had got damp, and so in a rage he must hasten to his tent to light the pipe; that is, to put on the Yankee garb and complete his forenoon work in a third hole of his, whose depth and shape recommended him as a first rate grave-digger.  And what has all this bosh to do with the Eureka Stockade?     Chapter VIII.    Fiat Fustitia, Ruat Coelum.   As an old Ballaarat hand, I hereby assert, that much of the odium of the mining community against red-tape, arose from the accursed practice of jumping.  One fact from the 'stubborn-things' store.  The Eureka gutter was fast progressing down hill towards the Eureka gully.  A party of Britishers had two claims; the one, on the slope of the hill, was bottomed on heavy gold; the other, some four claims from it, and parallel with the range, was some ninety feet deep, and was worked by day only, by three men:  a fourth man would now and then bring a set of trimmed slabs from the first hole aforesaid, where he was the principal 'chips.' There was a Judas Iscariot among the party. One fine morning, a hole was bottomed down the gully, and proved a scheisser. A rush, Eureka style, was the conseqence; and it was pretended now that the gutter would keep with the ranges, towards the Catholic church.  A party of Yankees, with revolvers and Mexican knives--the garb of 'bouncers' in those days--jumped the second hole of the Britishers, dismantled the windlass, and Godamn'd as fast as the Britishers cursed in the colonial style.  The excitement was awful.  Commissioner Rede was fetched to settle the dispute.  An absurd and unjust regulation was then the law; no party was allowed to have an interest in two claims at one and the same time, which was called 'owning two claims.' The Yankees carried the day. I, a living witness, do assert that, from that day, there was a 'down' on the name of Rede.  For the commissioners, this jumping business was by no means an agreeable job. They were fetched to the spot:  a mob would soon collect round the disputed claim; and for 'fair play,' it required the wisdom of Solomon, because the parties concerned set the same price on their dispute, as the two harlots on the living child.  I.  The conflicting evidence, in consequence of hard swearing, prompted by gold-thirst, the most horrible demon that depraves the human heart, even a naturally honest heart.--II.  The incomprehensible, unsettled, impracticable ordinances for the abominable management of the gold-fields; which ordinances, left to the discretion--that is, the caprice; and to the good sense--that is, the motto, 'odi profanum vulgus et arceo;' and to the best judgment--that is the proverbial incapability of all aristocractical red-tape, HOW TO RULE US VAGABONDS.  Both those reasons, I say, must make even the most hardened bibber of Toorak small-beer acknowledge and confess, that the perfidious mistake at head-quarters was, their persisting to make the following Belgravian 'billet-doux' the 'sine qua non' recommendation for gold-lace on Ballaarat (at the time):--   (ADDRESS)  \"To the Victorian Board of Small Beer,  \"Toorak (somewhere in Australasia, i.e., Australia Felix--inquire from the natives, reported to be of blackskin, at the southern end of the globe.)  \"Belgravia, First year of the royal projecting the Great Exhibition, Hyde Park.  \"LADY STARVESEMPSTRESS, great-grand-niece of His Grace the Duke Of CURRY-POWDER, begs to introduce to FORTYSHILLING TAKEHIMAWAY, Esquire, of Toorak, see address, her brother-in-law, POLLIPUSS, WATERLOOBOLTER, tenth son of the venerable Prebendary of North and South Palaver, Canon of St. Sebastopol in the east, and Rector of Allblessedfools, West End--URGENT.\"   In justice, however, to Master Waterloobolter, candidate for gold-lace, it must not be omitted that he is a Piccadilly young sprat, and so at Julien's giant 'bal-masque', was ever gracious to the lady of his love.  \"Miss Smartdeuce, may I beg the honour of your hand for the next waltz? surely after a round or two you will relish your champagne.\"  \"Yes,\" with a smothered \"dear,\" was the sigh-drawn reply.  Who has the power to roar the command, \"Thus far shalt thou go, and no further,\" to the flood of tears from forlorn Smartdeuce, when her soft Waterloobolter bolted for the gold-fields of Australia Felix.  To be serious.  How could any candid mind otherwise explain the honest boldness of eight out of nine members of the first Local Court, Ballaarat, who, one and all, I do not say dared, but I say called upon their fellow miners to come forward to a public meeting on the old spot, Bakery-hill.  September, Saturday, 30th, 1855.  Said members had already settled at that time 201 disputes, and given their judgement, involving some half a million sterling altogether, for all what they knew, and yet not one miner rose one finger against them, when they imperatively desired to know whether they had done their duty and still possessed the confidence of their fellow diggers! They (said members) are practical men, of our own adopted class, elected by ourselves from among ourselves, to sit as arbitrators of our disputes, and our representatives at the Local Court.  That's the key, for any future Brougham, for the history of the Local Courts on the gold-fields.  It has fallen to my lot, however, to put the Eureka Stockade on record; and, from the following 'Joe' chapter must begin any proper history of that disgracefully memorable event.     Chapter IX.    Abyssus, Abyssum Invocat.   \"Joe, Joe!\" No one in the world can properly understand and describe this shouting of \"Joe,\" unless he were on this El Dorado of Ballaarat at the time.  It was a horrible day, plagued by the hot winds.  A blast of the hurricane winding through gravel pits whirled towards the Eureka this shouting of \"Joe.\" It was the howl of a wolf for the shepherds, who bolted at once towards the bush:  it was the yell of bull-dogs for the fossikers who floundered among the deep holes, and thus dodged the hounds:  it was a scarecrow for the miners, who now scrambled down to the deep, and left a licensed mate or two at the windlass.  By this time, a regiment of troopers, in full gallop, had besieged the whole Eureka, and the traps under their protection ventured among the holes.  An attempt to give an idea of such disgusting and contemptible campaigns for the search of licences is really odious to an honest man.  Some of the traps were civil enough; aye, they felt the shame of their duty; but there were among them devils at heart, who enjoyed the fun, because their cupidity could not bear the sight of the zig-zag uninterrupted muster of piles of rich-looking washing stuff, and the envy which blinded their eyes prevented them from taking into account the overwhelming number of shicers close by, round about, all along.  Hence they looked upon the ragged muddy blue shirt as an object of their contempt.  Are diggers dogs or savages, that they are to be hunted on the diggings, commanded, in Pellissier's African style, to come out of their holes, and summoned from their tents by these hounds of the executive?  Is the garb of a digger a mark of inferiority?  'In sudore vultus lue vesceris panem'* is then an infamy now-a-days!  [*"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3546"],["title","The Eureka Stockade (#3)"],["body","the sweat of thy brow thou shalt eat bread.]  Give us facts, and spare us your bosh, says my good reader.--Very well.  I, CARBONII RAFFAELLO, da Roma, and late of No. 4, Castle-court, Cornhill, City of London, had my rattling 'Jenny Lind' (the cradle) at a water-hole down the Eureka Gully.  Must stop my work to show my licence.  'All right.'  I had then to go a quarter of a mile up the hill to my hole, and fetch the washing stuff.  There again--\"Got your licence?\"  \"All serene, governor.\" On crossing the holes, up to the knees in mullock, and loaded like a dromedary, \"Got your licence?\" was again the cheer-up from a third trooper or trap. Now, what answer would you have given, sir?  I assert, as a matter of fact, that I was often compelled to produce my licence twice at each and the same licence hunt.  Any one who knows me personally, will readily believe that the accursed game worried me to death.     Chapter X.    Jam Non Estis Hospites Et Advenoe   It is to the purpose to say a few words more on the licence-hunting, and have done with it.  Light your pipe, good reader, you have to blow hard.  Our red-tape, generally obtuse and arrogant, this once got rid of the usual conceit in all things, and had to acknowledge that the digger who remained quietly at his work, always possessed his licence.  Hence the troopers were despatched like bloodhounds, in all directions, to beat the bush; and the traps who had a more confined scent, creeped and crawled among the holes, and sneaked into the sly-grog tents round about, in search of the swarming unlicensed game.  In a word, it was a regular hunt.  Any one who in Old England went fox-hunting, can understand pretty well, the detestable sport we had then on the goldfields of Victoria. Did any trooper succeed in catching any of the 'vagabonds' in the bush, he would by the threat of his sword, confine him round a big gum-tree; and when all the successful troopers had done the same feat, they took their prisoners down the gully, where was the grand depot, because the traps were generally more successful.  The commissioner would then pick up one pound, two pounds, or five pounds, in the way of bail, from any digger that could afford it, or had friends to do so, and then order the whole pack of the penniless and friendless to the lock-up in the camp.  I am a living eye-witness, and challenge contradiction.  This job of explaining a licence-hunt is really so disgusting to me, that I prefer to close it with the following document from my subsequently gaol-bird mate, then reporter of the 'Ballaarat Times':--   Police Court, Tuesday, October 24th.  HUNTING THE DIGGER.--Five of these fellows were fined in the mitigated trifle of 5 pounds, for being without licences.  The nicest thing imaginable is to see one of these clumsy fellows with great beards, shaggy hair, and oh! such nasty rough hands, stand before a fine gentleman on the bench with hands of shiny whiteness, and the colour of whose cambric rivals the Alpine snow. There the clumsy fellow stands, faltering out an awkward apology, \"my licence is only just expired, sir--I've only been one day from town, sir--I have no money, sir, for I had to borrow half a bag of flour the other day, for my wife and children.\"  Ahem, says his worship, the law makes no distinctions--fined 5 pounds.  Now our reporter enjoys this exceedingly, for he is sometimes scarce of news; and from a strange aberration of intellect, with which, poor fellow, he is afflicted, has sometimes, no news at all for us; but he is sure of not being dead beat at any time, for digger-hunting is a standing case at the police office, and our reporter is growing so precocious with long practice, that he can tell the number of diggers fined every morning, without going to that sanctuary at all.--'Ballaarat Times', Saturday, October 28, 1854.     Chapter XI.    Salvum Fac Populum Tuum Domine.   The more the pity--I have not done yet with the accursed gold licence. I must prevail on myself to keep cooler and in good temper.  Two questions will certainly be put to me:-  1st.  Did the camp officials give out the licence to the digger at the place of his work, whenever required, without compelling him to leave off work, and renew his licence at the camp?  2nd.  It was only one day in each month that there was a search for licences, was it not?  Why therefore did not the diggers make it a half-holiday on the old ground, that \"all work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy.\"  The first question is a foolish one, from any fellow-colonist who knows our silver and gold lace; and is a wicked one, from any digger who was on Ballaarat at the time.  'Fellah' gave the proper answer through the 'Ballaarat Times', October 14th;--here it is:--   To the Editor of the 'Ballaarat Times', October 14, 1854.  Sir,  Permit me to call your attention to the miserable accommodation provided for the miner, who may have occasion to go to the Camp to take out a licence.  Surely, with the thousands of pounds that have been expended in government buildings, a little better accommodation might be afforded to the well disposed digger, who is willing to pay the odious tax demanded of him by government, and not be compelled to stand in the rain or sun, or treated as if the 'distinguished government official' feared that the digger was a thing that would contaminate him by a closer proximity; so the 'fellah' is kept by a wooden rail from approaching within a couple of yards of the tent.  In consequence, many persons mistaking the licence-office for the commissioner's water-closet, a placard has been placed over the door.  I am, Sir, yours &c.,  FELLAH DIGGER,  Who had to walk a few miles to pay away the money he had worked hard for, and was kept a few hours standing by a rail--not sitting on a rail, Mary.   Now I mean to tackle in right earnest with the second question, provided I can keep in sufficiently good temper.  On the morning of Thursday, the 22nd June, in the year of Grace, One thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, His Excellency SIR CHARLES HOTHAM, Knight Commander of the Most Noble Military Order of the Bath, landed on the shores of this fair province, as its Lieutenant-Governor, the chosen and commissioned representative of Her Most Gracious Majesty, the QUEEN! Never (writes the Melbourne historian of that day) never in the history of public ovations, was welcome more hearty, never did stranger meet with warmer welcome, on the threshold of a new home:  VICTORIA WELCOMES VICTORIA'S CHOICE, was the Melbourne proclamation.  The following is transcribed from my diary:-   \"Saturday, August 26th, 1854:  His Excellency dashed in among us 'vagabonds' on a sudden, at about five o'clock p.m., and inspected a shaft immediately behind the Ballaarat Dining Rooms, Gravel-pits.  A mob soon collected round the hole; we were respectful, and there was no 'joeing.' On His Excellency's return to the camp, the miners busily employed themselves in laying down slabs to facilitate his progress.  I was among the zealous ones who improvised this shabby foot-path.  What a lack! we were all of us as cheerful as fighting-cocks.--A crab-hole being in the way, our Big-Larry actually pounced on Lady Hotham, and lifting her up in his arms, eloped with her ladyship safely across, amid hearty peals of laughter, however colonial they may have been.--Now Big Larry kept the crowd from annoying the couple, by properly laying about him with a switch all along the road.  \"His Excellency was hailed with three-times-three, and was proclaimed on the Camp, now invaded by some five hundred blue shirts, the 'Diggers' Charley.'  \"His Excellency addressed us miners as follows:-  \"Diggers I feel delighted with your reception--I shall not neglect your interests and welfare--again I thank you.  \"It was a short but smart speech we had heard elsewhere, he was not fond of 'twaddle,' which I suppose meant 'bosh.' After giving three hearty cheers, old Briton's style to 'Charley,' the crowd dispersed to drink a nobbler to his health and success.  I do so this very moment.  Eureka, under my snug tent on the hill, August 26, 1854. C.R.\"   Within six short months, five thousand citizens of Melbourne, receive the name of this applauded ruler with a loud and prolonged outburst of indignation!  Some twenty Ballaarat miners lie in the grave, weltering in their gore! double that number are bleeding from bayonet wounds; thirteen more have the rope round their necks, and two more of their leading men are priced four hundred pounds for their body or carcase.  'Tout cela, n'est pas precisement comme chez nous, pas vrai?'  Please, give me a dozen puffs at my black-stump, and then I will proceed to the next chapter.     Chapter XII.    Sufficit Diei Sua Vexatio.   Either this chapter must be very short, or I had better give it up without starting it at all.  Up to the middle of September, 1854, the search for licences happened once a month; at most twice:  perhaps once a week on the Gravel Pits, owing to the near neighbourhood of the Camp.  Now, licence-hunting became the order of the day.  Twice a week on every line; and the more the diggers felt annoyed at it, the more our Camp officials persisted in goading us, to render our yoke palatable by habit.  I assert, as an eye-witness and a sufferer, that both in October and November, when the weather allowed it, the Camp rode out for the hunt every alternate day.  True, one day they would hunt their game on Gravel-pits, another day, they pounced on the foxes of the Eureka; and a third day, on the Red-hill:  but, though working on different leads, are we not all fellow diggers?  Did not several of us meet again in the evening, under the same tent, belonging to the same party? It is useless to ask further questions.  Towards the latter end of October and the beginning of November we had such a set of scoundrels camped among us, in the shape of troopers and traps, that I had better shut up this chapter at once, or else"]]]
