Barcroft and his companion merely recognised the dead airman as an opponent worthy of their steel, and as such he was entitled to the homage that one brave man pays to another. Of his past record they knew nothing. Their tribute was the spontaneous acknowledgment of a well-contested fight.  Slowly the seaplane taxied until one of the floats was within a foot or so of the Hun airman's corpse. Agilely Kirkwood swung himself over the side of the fuselage and swarmed down one of the supporting struts to the broad float.  \"Ugh!\" he soliloquised. \"The fellow's grinning at me.\"  Securing the body the A.P. deftly opened the leather jacket. From the inner breast pocket he withdrew a bulky pocket-book, a map and an envelope, sealed and addressed and enclosed in oiled silk. Further search produced a gunmetal watch. On the lid was inscribed in High German characters: \"War substitute in lieu of gold watch patriotically surrendered by Unter-leutnant E. von Bülow und Helferich.\" A purse completed the list of articles found on the body.  \"Buck up!\" exclaimed Barcroft. \"It will be dark in another twenty minutes.\"  Thus abjured Kirkwood opened the valve of the dead airman's inflated jacket. Slowly the corpse sank beneath the surface to find a temporary resting-place on the bed of the North Sea. Night had fallen by the time the seaplanes had returned to their parent ship and had been safely housed. The \"Hippodrome,\" steaming with screened lights and escorted by the vigilant destroyers, resumed her belated run for home waters.  Barcroft and Kirkwood, in the large and well-lighted wardroom, were examining the \"effects\" of their victim, while a crowd of flying-officers stood round to watch the proceedings.  The A.P. had separated the Hun's personal belongings and was making them up into a parcel, to be sealed and delivered to the dead aviator's relatives when opportunity occurred. It was a point of etiquette faithfully carried out by the airmen of both sides whenever circumstances made it possible.  Barcroft was studiously scanning the documents that were not of a personal nature. The map was a German production, and comprised a large scale area of Kent. Probably it was based upon the British Ordnance Survey, supplemented by details gathered by the swarm of Hun spies who more or less openly infested the length and breadth of the British Isles, prior to the memorable month of August 1914. Yet there was clear evidence of the map being brought up to date, recently-erected munition factories and other places of military importance being faithfully recorded. The margin was embellished with photographic reproductions of views of conspicuous landmarks taken from a considerable altitude.  \"Jolly rummy how these Boche birds get hold of these views,\" commented Fuller. \"I swear they didn't take them unless they've been running daylight trips in noiseless and practically invisible 'planes. It's their strafed organisation that is so wonderful. Knock holes in that and it's all up with Hunland. Hullo, Billy, what's the excitement?\"  Barcroft, holding up a paper he had taken from the pocket-book, was studying it with the deepest interest, while his face was dimpled with lines of suppressed laughter.  \"By Jove!\" he exclaimed. \"Won't the governor be bucked? Listen to this, you fellows. I'll have to go slow, as some of the tongue-splitting words take a bit of translating:  \"'It is my Royal and Imperial command that steps be taken to secure the person of the Englishman Peter Barcroft, residing at Rivers dale House, near Alderdene, in the county of Kent, the said Peter Barcroft having published or caused to be published books that--that--(can't quite make out what's Schriftsteller? Ah! I have it) of which he is the author, the same books treating Us with libellous contempt. To the good German who succeeds in producing the said Peter Barcroft alive on German soil will be paid the reward of twenty thousand marks. In the event of the said Peter Barcroft being slain by the act of one of my subjects the reward will be ten thousand marks.--Wilhelm, I.R.'\"  \"So that's what Unter-leutnant E. von Bülow und Helferich was on the stunt for,\" remarked Fuller. \"Yes, by smoke! there's a red circle drawn round the village of Alderdene. Billy, my festive, your pater will have to look out for himself.\"  \"Perhaps the Hun has already wiped Riversdale House out of existence,\" said Barcroft with a hearty laugh.  His brother officers looked at him in astonishment. His levity, at the possibility of his parent's annihilation by a few hundred pounds of high explosive, seemed altogether out of place.  \"Steady, old man,\" exclaimed Tarleton, the senior \"flight-luff.\"  \"Can't help it,\" continued Barcroft, vainly endeavouring to suppress his mirth. \"Fancy a Boche going all that way on a fruitless errand, even supposing he did drop a plum within half a mile of the house. The governor vacated the show last quarter-day, and it's still empty. There isn't another house within a couple of miles of it, and it belongs to a regular pig of a lawyer-josser who's at loggerheads with everybody. Let's hope, if the house is pulverised, that it isn't insured against hostile aircraft. I'm not vindictive, but it would serve the bounder right.\"  \"Where's your governor now?\" enquired Fuller.  \"Eh? Entering for the Kaiser's Stakes, old man? Well, here's a clue. He's moved to Tarleigh, a little show somewhere in Lancashire. About six or seven miles from Barborough, I believe, and the same distance from anywhere else. At any rate, I'm off there directly I get my leave. By Jove, won't the old man feel honoured!--a price set on his head by Irresponsible Bill. He'll feel as proud as Punch. By the bye--don't all speak at once--who's pinched my matches?\"     CHAPTER III  CONCERNING PETER BARCROFT   \"AND Billy arrives by the ten-fifty. No, I don't think I'll wait here for three hours and then stand a chance of missing him. I'll get back home and give him a fitting welcome to the new house.\"  Thus meditated Peter Barcroft as he paced up and down the crowded up-platform of Barborough Station. He had studied with varying emotions a poster depicting a flabby, pigeon-toed child with one hand over that part of the human form known to infants as a \"tummy\" and supposed to be ejaculating, \"I feel so jolly here.\" Even that mild excitement paled, and Mr. Barcroft pined for the congenial warmth of his study. The platform was cold and draughty, offering no inducements to linger for the arrival of the sure-to-be belated \"ten-fifty.\"  Peter Barcroft was a thick-set man of fortyfive. In height he was a good two inches shorter than his airman son. He was clean shaven. Had he removed his Norfolk cap it might have been noticed that his iron-grey hair showed thin on his temples and was conspicuously absent on the top of his head. His forehead was high, and in conjunction with two vertical wrinkles extending upwards from the inner ends of his eyebrows, gave the appearance of a deep thinker. Otherwise there was little about him to give one the idea that he was engaged in literary pursuits. According to popular notions he ought to be wearing shabby clothes of eccentric, out-of-date cut; he should affect a weird type of soft collar and a flowing tie; his hair ought to be long and wavy. But Peter Barcroft had none of these qualifications. To judge him by appearances he was just an ordinary middle-aged man of powerful physique and retaining many of the qualities of a bygone athletic age.  He had been living only a fortnight in Lancashire. Why he migrated from Kent was a mystery to the friends he had left behind. Perhaps he did not know himself, unless it was surrender to a sudden, almost eccentric desire for pastures new.  Up to a certain point he possessed the artistic temperament. He worked only when it suited him, and generally seized every plausible excuse to \"knock off.\" Yet, when he did settle to his task he wrote at a tremendous rate, and so vilely that often he was quite unable to decipher his own caligraphy. In financial matters he was as careless as a man could possibly be. Rarely he knew the state of his current account. Trivial matters in everyday life would send him into a towering rage, while the loss of a couple of hundred pounds hardly troubled him in the least degree. He would ransack the house to find a favourite pipe which he had mislaid, or waste half a day searching in vain for a certain pen which he felt sure he had left in such-and-such a place. On the other hand, when a valuable and almost new overcoat was stolen from the hall he just shrugged his shoulders and soon forgot all about it.  During the fortnight he had been the tenant of Ladybird Fold, Peter Barcroft had either \"sacked\" or had been \"sacked\" by three housemaids and two cooks, to the consternation and despair of his wife. The servant problem, probably more acute in the manufacturing district of Lancashire than anywhere else in the kingdom, was in this case rendered even more difficult by Peter's display of irritation at the manifold but trivial delinquencies of his staff of menials.  Mrs. Barcroft had gone on a visit to a relative in Cheshire on the strength of a vague report that there was a girl who might be willing to take the vacant place of housemaid at Ladybird Fold-His wife's absence for two days had given Peter the excuse to \"knock off.\" It was one of his avowed peculiarities that he could not write a stroke unless his wife were with him in the study. So Mr. Barcroft had gone for a jaunt in his light car.  After the splendidly-surfaced gravelled or tarmac roads of Kent the greasy granite setts and bumpy slag roads of the north came as an unpleasant surprise to the easy-going Peter. A couple of punctures in addition to a slight collision with a \"lurry\"--a type of vehicle hitherto known to him as a lorry--did not improve his peace of mind, while what ought to have been the climax to a day of mishaps"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35362"],["title","Billy Barcroft, R.N.A.S.: A Story of the Great War (#3)"],["body"," the sudden failure of the magneto at a desolate spot on the western slope of the Pennine Hills.  But unruffled Peter pushed the car on to the side of the road and tramped stolidly into the nearest village--a good three miles. Here, in an interview with the decrepit motor-engineer (Barcroft guessed rightly that he was too _passé_ even for munition making), he learnt that at least a month must elapse before the magneto could be re-wired. He received the intelligence with equanimity, for in his pocket was a telegram to the effect that Billy was coming home that night. Nothing else mattered.  \"Which is the Tarleigh train?\" enquired Mr. Barcroft of a porter.  \"Next one in on this side,\" replied the man gruffly.  Half a minute later the train rumbled into the station. Mr. Barcroft, realising that up to the present he had not mastered the intricate system of train-service of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, and having had many previous experiences of being misinformed by surly servants of the various railway companies, addressed himself to a passenger who was about to enter a carriage.  \"Tarleigh? Yes, you're quite right. At any rate, I'm for Blackberry Cross.\"  \"Thank you,\" replied Peter.  \"Motorist?\" enquired the other laconically. \"Yes; had a breakdown.\"  The ice was broken. The studied, almost taciturn reserve of the typical level-headed Lancashire man was not proof against the claims of motoring. Before the train glided out of the station the two passengers were deep in the subject of cars and their peculiarities.  \"Dash it all! we seem a long time getting to Two Elms,\" remarked the stranger.  He drew aside the blind and peered into the darkness. At that moment the train rumbled under a broad bridge.  \"Sorry!\" he exclaimed. \"We're already half way between Blackberry Cross and Tarleigh. We must have taken the wrong train: it's a non-stop to Windyhill.\"  \"Don't mention it,\" rejoined Peter affably. \"I'm quite enjoying your society. An hour or so won't make very much difference provided I can get home before eleven. I hope you won't be inconvenienced?\"  The stranger laughed.  \"I'm secretary of the Tarleigh and Blackberry Cross Golf Club,\" he explained. \"Entwistle--Philip Entwistle--is my name. By profession I am what is commonly known as a vet. It's our Annual General Meeting, and I'm due there at eight.\"  \"'Fraid it will have to stop at the due,\" said Mr. Barcroft grimly. \"It's 7.30 already.\"  \"You'll be all right,\" continued Entwistle. \"There's a train back from Windyhill at 10.5, You're a stranger to the district?\"  \"Fairly so,\" admitted Peter. \"I've take Ladybird Fold for three years.\"  \"Your name doesn't happen to be Norton--Andrew Norton?\"  \"No,\" was the reply. \"Barcroft's my name. I know Norton. He's a newcomer. Only been here a week, I believe; and in that time he's frozen on to me. Kind of companionship in a strange land, so to speak. He seems a very decent sort; in fact, I rather like him. He's my nearest neighbour and he lives at least half a mile from Ladybird Fold.\"  \"What is he?\" asked Entwistle. \"Independent?\"  \"So I should imagine. He has plenty of time on his hands, and spends a good part of it with me, except when I have to choke him off. He'll be sitting in my study when I get home, for a dead cert. Already he's made it a practice of looking me up at ten o'clock of an evening, after I've knocked off. You see,\" he added apologetically. \"I have to work.\"  \"At what?\" enquired his companion, the Lancashire thirst for knowledge ever in the foreground.  \"I am a professional liar,\" announced Peter with mock gravity.  \"A what? Oh, I suppose you mean that you're a lawyer?\"  \"Heaven forbid!\" protested Mr. Barcroft piously. \"You misunderstand me. I am a novelist. Modesty forbids me to give you my _nom de Plume_. At present, however, I am engaged upon a book of a technical character dealing with the conduct of the war. Perhaps some of my theories will be a bit startling when pushed on to the British Public, but they'll be vindicated.\"  \"Hang it all!\" exclaimed Entwistle. \"I have heard of you already.\"  \"Have you really?\" enquired Peter. Professional vanity--although he was not afflicted with \"swollen head\"--made him perhaps justifiably keen on hearing outside opinions of his literary efforts.  \"Yes,\" continued his companion. \"It was the Vicar of Tarleigh. He was in Wheatcroft's place--down the bottom of Blackberry Hill and while he was talking to the old man a car came along driven by you. In it were two sheep dogs barking like fury. I think I am right in the description?\"  Peter nodded appreciatingly.  \"Says the vicar, 'And what might that terrific disturbance mean?' 'Eh, parson,' replied Old Wheatcroft, 'tis but that there novel-writing chap as lives in Ladybird Fold.' So you see they've got you posted up all right. But here we are,\" he continued, as the train came to a standstill. \"It's a jolly draughty station to hang about.\"  \"It is,\" admitted Barcroft. \"But fortunately there's very little wind. A proper Zeppelin night.\"  \"Suppose so,\" admitted Entwistle. \"You see, we don't worry very much about those gentry. Now, in Yorkshire, for instance, it would be otherwise, but we are on the right side of the Pennines. I don't for one moment think that a Zep. will ever get so far as this.\"  Peter shrugged his shoulders. On that matter, he preferred to maintain silence.  Up and down the bleak platform the two men paced until Entwistle, glancing at his watch in the feeble glimmer of a shaded lamp, exclaimed--\"Twenty-five to eleven. Bless my soul, the time has gone quickly. That confounded train is late.\"  Before Barcroft could offer any remark the platform lights were turned off. Simultaneously, the electric signal lamps ceased to give forth their red and green warning.  \"What's up?\" demanded Entwistle. \"Failure of the gas works and the Company's electric light station?\"  \"Hanged if I know,\" declared Peter. \"It strikes me very forcibly that we'll have to walk those seven miles. I suppose it means twelve for you? A taxi, or even a humble four-wheeler is an impossibility in this forsaken hole.\"  A man, stumbling across the rails in the darkness, clambered upon the platform within a yard of the two would-be passengers.  \"Sorry, sir,\" he muttered apologetically.  \"What's all this about?\" enquired Entwistle. \"Why have the lights gone out? Are there no more trains to-night?\"  \"No, sir, no more trains yet awhile,\" replied the porter, for such he was. \"They've just got a warning through. Them swine of Zeps. is somewheres about.\"     CHAPTER IV  WHEN THE ZEPPELIN WAS OUT   \"WE'LL have to foot it, man,\" declared Entwistle decidedly. \"Unless we can get a car to pick us up on the road. Zeppelins, by smoke! Whoever would have thought it? I didn't; not this side of the Pennines.\"  \"So I believe you said,\" replied Peter Barcroft, as the two men swung down the inclined approach to the station and gained the setts of the dingy street. \"Still, they may be miles away. These official warnings are the pattern of eccentricity. You know the road?\"  \"Yes fortunately Dash it all! I don't mind the excitement. It's my wife I'm thinking about, if they should come to Barborough. Ever seen a Zep., Barcroft?\"  \"Several,\" replied Peter. \"They are fairly common objects down in Kent. Get quite accustomed to them. Latterly I have slept soundly, in spite of the noise of the engines. Of course they didn't drop any bombs in that particular district. In point of fact they eventually dumped their dangerous cargo into some fields a few miles from anywhere. Our lighting restrictions are far more stringent than they are up here. Barborough is a blaze of light compared, say, with Tangtable or Cobley, the nearest large towns to Alderdene, where I used to live.\"  \"You used to sleep through it,\" repeated Mr. Entwistle. \"That reminds me. I noticed that when we were walking up and down the platform just now you invariably got round to my left as we turned. Are you deaf in one ear?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Peter. \"Stone deaf in my left. A really valuable asset when one has to be in the presence of bores, or enduring curtain lectures and the like.\"  \"Then we may congratulate ourselves,\" was his companion's response. \"I, too, am deaf, only in my right ear. When I was at school at Scarborough a brute of a master hiked me up by my ears. Result, deafness in one of them. Yes, I agree, it's very convenient at times.\"  By now they had breasted the steep rise out of Windyhill and had gained the bleak summit of the lofty ridge. In ordinary circumstances would be seen the twinkling lights from scores of factories--\"works\" as these are termed locally--in the five distinct valleys that radiate from this particular spur. All was now in utter darkness, save for a feeble glimmer from an isolated signal-box at the entrance to a deep cutting.  \"That chap's looking for trouble,\" declared Barcroft, indicating the dim patch of luminosity. \"They would spot that for a distance of ten miles. I say, isn't the atmosphere clear for this part of the country, and in autumn, too. It's the first absolutely fine night I have seen since I've lived here--ideal for Zeps., too. No wind to speak of and pitch dark. Listen.\"  The two men stopped abruptly. Above the faint rumble of the evening breeze could be distinguished a subdued and distinct hum.  \"That's the brute,\" declared Peter. \"It's a Zep, sure enough.\"  \"Certain?\" asked Entwistle anxiously.  \"Rather--and it's coming this way.\"  In silence the two pedestrians waited. Nearer and nearer came the now increasing buzzing of the engines of the immense gas-bag. Vainly they attempted to detect the elongated airship. With heads thrown back they strove to pierce the black vault above. The \"thing\" was there, but it was invisible from where they stood. Only by the sinister sounds did they know of its presence. Then with the same rapidity as the unseen had approached the whirr grew fainter and fainter until it was heard no longer.  \"Phew!\" ejaculated"]]]
