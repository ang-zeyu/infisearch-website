For the broad historical setting and the details of organization the works of Bancroft, Bolton, Priestley, and Cutter will be found entirely adequate.  All the important diaries are presented, with two exceptions. One is Argüello's account of his expedition to the upper Sacramento and Trinity rivers in 1821. This manuscript is now being translated and annotated as a separate work by Professor Robert F. Heizer, of the University of California, and Professor Donald C. Cutter, of the University of Southern California. The other is the Estudillo expedition to the southern San Joaquin Valley in 1818. The Estudillo documents have already been translated and edited by Dr. Anna H. Gayton (1936) and can readily be obtained.  In addition to the well-known, formal reports to the Central Authority I have translated several excerpts from letters and memoirs. The contemporary correspondence occasionally discusses briefly or extensively expeditions of interest concerning which we have no other knowledge. For completeness, therefore, these accounts must be included. Concerning the memoirs some reservation is necessary. This type of document furnishes a great deal of material for the later period of 1820-1840. There are, however, a number of passages which refer quite clearly to events in the preceding decade. These are the reminiscences of old men, talking about campaigns and battles which occurred more than half a century earlier. The raconteurs were mostly rather ignorant, their memory faulty, their attitude boastful. Their command of fact is definitely unreliable, their personal viewpoint highly colored and biased. Their accounts are nevertheless valuable for the picture they give of the day-to-day personal contact between the white men and the natives, and for the many interesting sidelights on the life and the land of the Central Valley in its original condition.  The author wishes to acknowledge with thanks a grant made by the Institute of Social Sciences, of the University of California, for photocopying and clerical assistance.     I. EARLY EXPEDITIONS, 1776-1803   During the initial period of settlement and exploration in California, from 1769 to 1776, several important and well-known expeditions entered the area, among them those of Portola, Anza, Fages, and Cañizares. As a result the coastal strip and the vicinity of San Francisco Bay became well known. The interior did not receive so much attention. Following Anza only two recorded expeditions went into the Central Valley, that of Moraga, described by Palóu (Bolton, 1926) and that of Fages, the account of which has been translated by Priestley (1913).  In the meantime, and during the first two decades of Spanish occupation of coastal California, individuals were slowly penetrating the interior. Most of these left no record or trace, except on the health and emotional outlook of the natives. Many of them were deserters from the army, whose enlisted ranks contained many from the lowest strata of Mexican society. Along the coast trouble with desertion began with the Portola expedition itself (see Crespi's diary) and was commented upon by both military and clerical writers for many years thereafter. Most of the absconding soldiers stayed within the mission area but some reached the interior valley. The earliest clear examples are cited by Garcés in the diary of his famous trip in 1776. In the upper San Joaquin Valley, east of Bakersfield, he was told of two Spanish soldiers who had been killed by the Indians for molesting women (Coues, 1900, p. 288) and found a Spaniard married to an Indian woman (Coues, 1900, p. 295).   EXCERPTS FROM OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE  A number of letters in the official correspondence of the late eighteenth century refer to fugitive deserters. Of these several may be quoted, primarily by way of illustration since a complete presentation of such data would be very difficult. Documents cited are all in the Bancroft Library, Berkeley, unless otherwise stated.  It should be noted that the style in a great many of the transcripts is indirect. The copyist made a paraphrase of the original letter and prefaced his statement with the word \"that.\" Thus in the first letter below the copyist wishes it understood that the original letter said that Sebastian Albitre ran away ... and so on. In some documents the indirection is ignored and the text is translated directly. As a rule, however, it is preferable to retain the circumlocution employed by Bancroft's transcriber.    _Blotter of Governor Fages_   November 7, 1785   (Cal. Arch., Prov. Rec., II: 348)      That Sebastian Albitre ran away and with him the soldier of the     Presidio, Mariano Yepez; that after a few days the mistress of the     latter disappeared from her mission at Santa Clara; that he sent out     two parties to chase them as far as the Sierra Nevada; these parties     returned because their horses were badly exhausted; the pursuit will     be resumed in June.    _Governor to Commandant at Santa Barbara_   October 9, 1795   (Cal. Arch., Prov. Rec., IV: 302)      He should offer presents, or whatever they like, to the Indians,     so that they will catch Avila, who, as is known, is running as a     fugitive in the Tulare Valley with several Christians from San Juan     Bautista. He should make every effort to catch this man.    _Marcos Briones to Hermenegildo Sal_   San Luis Obispo, January 8, 1797   (Cal. Arch., Prov. St. Pap., XVI: 239)      Says that the Father[1] sent some Christian Indians in search of a     Gentile woman in order that she might be married to a Christian who     had been her husband when they were heathen. That on the return with     the Indian woman they passed by a rancheria where an old Gentile,     accompanied by his two sons, killed Toribio, one of those who had     gone after the Gentile woman. The latter was suspected of having     poisoned her Christian daughter who died in this mission. That today     he is setting out with three soldiers and some Christian Indians to     apprehend the culprits.    _Marcos Briones to Sal_   San Luis Obispo, January 14, 1797   (Cal. Arch., Prov. St. Pap., XVI: 238-239)      That on the 8th inst. he set out from this garrison in search of the     malefactors, as the governor had ordered him and he could not find     them. That in one rancheria, among those which he entered, an     old Indian woman told him that the Gentiles of that vicinity had     assembled opposite the Nacimiento [River] looking for the [road to     the] Tulares. That he turned back on account of lack of provisions     but intends to return [to the Tulares] on the 19th in order to     pacify that gathering of Gentiles.    _Marcos Briones to Sal_   San Luis Obispo, January 8, 1797   (Cal. Arch., Prov. St. Pap., XVI: 239)      He says that on the 18th he set out to apprehend the Gentile Indians     who had killed Toribio, the Christian Indian of this Mission. That     he fell upon a rancheria at the edge of the Valley of the Tulares,     where he knew was the chief of the malefactors, whom he succeeded     in catching. He brought him in company with two others whom he (the     malefactor) had forced to burn the corpse of the defunct Toribio.     That he arrived at this mission the 23rd and asked the said criminal     why he killed Toribio. He [the Indian] replied that it was because a     Christian [Indian], one of those who accompanied the deceased, had     come close to his house and had said: \"Is the old robber[2] here? If     he is, why doesn't he come out?\" Whereupon he and his son chased the     Christians as far as the place where they killed the said Toribio.   HERMENEGILDO SAL'S EXPEDITION, 1796  The first formally organized exploration, subsequent to Anza and Fages, was apparently carried out by an army officer, Hermenegildo Sal, in 1796. He was a lieutenant in command of the Monterey garrison and conducted a party into the Stockton area. He left no personal diary but did write a letter to the Governor. It is the transcript, or rather paraphrase, of the letter by one of Bancroft's workers which is here presented.    _Report of Hermenegildo Sal_   San Francisco, January 31, 1796   (Cal. Arch., Prov. St. Pap., XIV: 14-16)      Report in which Lieutenant Hermenegildo Sal sets forth what he has     learned concerning various matters, in order to communicate it to     the Governor of the Province.      That leaving the mission of Santa Clara or the town of San José, in     a northerly direction, at about 15 leagues, one reaches the Río del     Pescadero,[3] which has good water, depth and current, and is so     called because fishing is done in it for salmon. That at one-quarter     league [farther on] is the Río de San Francisco Jabier, wider than     the preceding and with more water, for the latter reaches to the     bottom of the saddle pad. That at about two leagues [farther on] is     the Río de San Miguel, larger than the two others, and deeper, for     the water reaches to the back bow of the saddle. That the three have     no trees where they cross the valley of the Tulares. That at about     five leagues [farther on][4] is the Río de la Pasión, populated with     ash, alder, and other trees, and with a very deep channel.      That between the two last rivers is a fine oak park, in the area     toward the Sierra Madre which runs toward the north and is called     Sierra Nevada.      That, going through the oak park and leaving on the left hand the     tule swamps, there is a region of fresh-water lakes so spaced     that there are pockets of solid ground in which are encountered     rancherias inhabited by Gentiles. [These are] brave and strong, have     small dragnets with stone sinkers, and make"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36387"],["title","Colonial Expeditions to the Interior of California Central Valley, 1800-1820 (#2)"],["body","with flour from     tule roots and from acorns like that which they presented to Captain     Fernando de Rivera.[5]      That these four rivers run from east to west and discharge into the     bay of the port of San Francisco. That when the tide rises salt     water is carried into them far upstream.[6]      That the Sierra Madre is distant from the Río de la Pasión a matter     of eight leagues. That the natives take two days to cross it. That     all the countryside abounds with fresh grass, tule swamps, and lakes     where deer breed. That before reaching the rivers, on the right hand     lies the territory of San Juan,[7] a short distance from the Sierra     Nevada, and visible from the presidio.      That the names of the four rivers were given by Captain Fernando     Rivera, commander of these presidios, when he passed by there during     the month of December, 1776.      (Under the heading \"Information secured ... from the Christian     Indians of the Mission of San Francisco,\" is the following report.)      That the first Indian told him that his people traded with a \"nation     of dark Indians\" and that the latter have priests.[8]      (What follows is copied verbatim.)      The second [Indian] gave news of the nations Julpones,[9]     Quinenseat, Taunantoc, and Quisitoc: the first are on the shore of     the estuary. The second are on the other side of the rivers; they     are tall and blond. The third trade with glass beads like ours. The     last are bald. He says the land is very hot and the Indians stay all     day in the lakes, the water of which is boiling, and this is the     reason why their hair falls out. The Indian reasserts that those     people have heads like their hands, but they are born with hair like     everyone else.      An Indian woman named Delfina told the mayor-domo, Diego Olbera, and     his wife: \"One day, having crossed the rivers and traveled five     days, soldiers and priests are encountered who give the Indians     pieces of cotton cloth, blankets, axes and knives.\" That there are     [i.e., they had] wheels and, as she stated, the latter were from     carts or wagons, giving the appearance that this was their mode of     travel.      That the above is the news which he has been able to secure and     which he is transmitting [to the Governor].     II. EXPEDITIONS, 1804-1805   In 1804, and probably in 1805, there were various penetrations of the valley. Chief of these was the visit of Father Fray Juan Martin to the village of Bubal. Since this trip was entirely unauthorized, it was not described until 1815. This silence for ten years is significant, since it opens up the possibility that many other such informal expeditions occurred--without having been written up afterward.   FATHER MARTIN'S VISIT TO CHOLAM, 1804  Father Martin's trip to Cholam did not actually reach the valley, but attained its borders. It is worth recording as showing the type of activity characteristic of the period.    _José de la Guerra, Commandant, to Governor Arrillaga_   Monterey, January 29, 1804   (Prov. St. Pap., Benicia, Military, XXXIV: 266-267)      Communicates that Father Juan Martin, minister of San Miguel,     protected by one soldier, went to a village called Cholam and asked     the chief of all the villages thereabouts, named Guchapa, to give     him some children to baptize. This was refused by the chief, who     told the Father and the soldier to get out immediately or it would     go badly with them, for he \"was not afraid of the soldiers, who     were cowards, and he knew with certainty that they would die like     everyone else.\"      Commandant Guerra sent a sergeant, a corporal, and thirteen soldiers     to take the chief, Guchapa, prisoner. The expedition set out     December 22. It returned January 10 bringing as captives Chief     Guchapa, his son, two other chieftains, and two Christians. (The     commandant says he includes the report of the sergeant, but it is     not to be found. He talks of \"the heroic struggle of Guchapa and the     good passage provided them by the Indian Cojapa.\")      The commandant continues saying that Guchapa made the proposition     that he would bring out all the Christian Indians there were in his     villages. This was accepted and he left his son as hostage. \"I     dismissed him with some presents which I gave him as a reward for     his good behavior with the troops and waited a little while for his     return. This was in order to grant them forgiveness together with     the warning that in the future they should hold in respect the     troops and the Fathers. This was the least which it seems to me     should be done and said.\"[1]   FATHER MARTIN'S VISIT TO BUBAL, 1805    _Fray Juan Martin to P. P. Fray José Señan_   San Miguel, April 26, 1815   (Santa Barbara Arch., VI: 85-89)      My venerated Father President Fray José Señan: good health!      Under date of 4 April, this year, the Reverend Father Prefect     requested us to inform Your Reverence concerning the state of the     heathen Indians near this mission, particularly as pertains to their     inclination to receive Holy Baptism.      In complying with my orders I will state with candor that the desire     of the neighboring heathens is great, for twelve years have already     passed during which they have manifested good will, now to the     soldiers on the various occasions when the troops have gone out, now     to the Fathers who have likewise gone, and now also to the neophytes     on the very numerous occasions when they have gone visiting to the     Tulares. Their favorable disposition will continue if the fugitives     from the north do not set them against us. Thus the most recent     mission Indians to return from leave, who came from one of the     Valley villages called Tache, informed us that Indians had arrived     on horseback from the north saying that the Fathers were simply     going to kill the Indians. Satan will do his utmost to gain     possession of more than 4,000 souls[2] who will be started on the     road to salvation if a mission is established in the nearby Tulare     Valley. This I said in substance many times to Governor Don José     Joaquin de Arrillaga, may he rest in peace.      Although I saw him to be inclined to establish missions on the     rivers, and in spite of the high regard in which I held this     gentleman, nevertheless on one occasion when he asked me what I     thought about new foundations in the Tulare Valley, I spoke thus:     \"Sir, why do you wish to place missions where they are not wanted?     And why do you neglect the villages of Bubal, Tache, Chuntache,     Notonto, and Telame, which do want them? So that they may kill     soldiers and priests and thus deprive us of the spiritual conquest?     Aside from the primary reason that they are sons of God, if those     who wish and beg for missions do not receive them, they will take up     arms against all the soldiers who enter their territory.\" Witnesses     to this truth are Father Pedro Muñoz, Señor Moraga and in part I     myself. In order that Your Reverence may fully understand this I     shall set forth what I saw in the year 1804 in the village of Bubal     where I went with no more protection than two soldiers.      Repeatedly I was informed by the neophytes who had been inhabitants     of the villages of the Tulare Valley that the people of the region     wanted to see me, that they were well disposed, and that they would     give me their children to baptize. Finally they said that I might go     without fear and I confess that I went with no permission from     anyone.      So I left in the month of November in the year mentioned and at the     end of the third day I arrived at the first suburb of the village     Bubal, to which I gave the name La Salve. On first seeing us the     heathen concealed their women in some little huts but as soon as     they saw that we were coming in peace they brought the women out in     order to make a fire and cook food for the Father.[3] This they did,     using sticks which had been brought for more than eight leagues for     the purpose of farming the [Zª ..., meaning unintelligible] when     they gathered with their neighbors for some ceremony. They did not     burn these sticks although they knew it was certain to be very cold,     because for many leagues around one cannot find even small brush.      In the evening the people from the main village came to invite me to     the place where they lived, saying that where I was there were no     people, nor children to give me, and therefore I should come without     fail. I promised I would go the following day, and I did so. As soon     as I arrived they presented me with their little sons so that I     might carry them away to be baptized. There were so many that the     soldiers who accompanied me objected strongly, pointing out that     there were no fewer than two hundred children, and that we must     leave them. Seeing such a harvest, Your Reverence may well imagine     how happy I was at the prospect of gaining so many infant souls for     paradise. But Satan, always the fiend, brought it about that for the     moment we did not gain a single one.      It happened that the chief was not at this place (which I called La     Dolorosa). It was necessary for me to send for him for I did not     venture to take them [the children] away without his sanction. There     arrived a heathen, whom I took to be the chief. As the reason for my     coming was made clear to him, which was to make them Sons of God,     my request affected him very badly. He began to rail against the     soldiers and their weapons in such a crazy fashion that the poor     people who had given me their children, probably scared, fled in a     body and I was left with no one. This man was one of those who with     a bow in his hand fears nobody. His name is Chapé. The following     day I condemned as"]]]
