Nay, the more rapid and extensive is the progress of the various special sciences, the more imperative and insistent becomes the need to collect and collate their separate findings, to interrogate them one and all as to whether and how far these findings fit in with the facts and conditions of human life and existence, to determine what light and aid they contribute to the solution of the great and ever recurring questions of the _whence_? and _whither_? and _why_? of man and the universe. One who is a sincere scientist as well as an earnest philosopher has written _à propos_ of this necessity in the following terms:—       The farther science has pushed back the limits of the discernible     universe, the more insistently do we feel the demand within us for     some satisfactory explanation of the whole. The old, eternal     problems rise up before us and clamour loudly and ever more loudly     for some newer and better solution. The solution offered by a     bygone age was soothing at least, if it was not final. In the     present age, however, the problems reappear with an acuteness that     is almost painful: the deep secret of our own human nature, the     questions of our origin and destiny, the intermeddling of blind     necessity and chance and pain in the strange, tangled drama of our     existence, the foibles and oddities of the human soul, and all the     mystifying problems of social relations: are not these all so many     enigmas which torment and trouble us whithersoever we turn? And     all seem to circle around the one essential question: Has human     nature a real meaning and value, or is it so utterly amiss that     truth and peace will never be its portion?(41)   A final difficulty against philosophical research is suggested by the thought that if the philosopher has to take cognizance of all the conclusions of all the special sciences his task is an impossible one, inasmuch as nowadays at all events it would take a lifetime to become proficient in a few of these sciences not to speak of all of them.  There is no question, however, of becoming proficient in them; the philosopher need not be a specialist in any positive science; his acquaintance with the contents of these sciences need extend no farther than such established conclusions and such current though unverified hypotheses as have an immediate bearing on ultimate or philosophical problems.  Moreover, while it would be injurious both to philosophy and to science, as is proved by the history of both alike, to separate synthetic from analytic speculation by a divorce between philosophy and science; while it would be unwise to ignore the conclusions of the special sciences and to base philosophical research _exclusively_ on the data of the plain man’s common and unanalysed experience, it must be remembered on the other hand that the most fundamental truths of speculative and practical philosophy, the truths that are most important for the right and proper orientation of human life, can be established and defended independently of the special researches of the positive sciences. The human mind had not to await the discovery of radium in order to prove the existence of God. Such supreme truths as the existence of God, the immortality of the human soul, the freedom of the human will, the existence of a moral law, the distinction between right and wrong, etc., have been _always_ in possession of the human race. It has been, moreover, confirmed in its possession of them by Divine Revelation. And it has not needed either the rise or the progress of modern science to defend them. These fundamental rational truths constitute a _philosophia perennis_: a fund of truth which is, like all truth, _immutable_, though our human insight into it may develop in depth and clearness.  But while this is so it is none the less true that philosophy, to be progressive in its own order, must take account of every new fact and conclusion brought to light in every department of scientific—and historical, and artistic, and literary, and every other sort of—research. And this for the simple reason that every such accession, whether of fact or of theory, is an enlargement of human experience; as such it clamours on the one hand for philosophical interpretation, for explanation in the light of what we know already about the ultimate grounds and causes of things, for admission into our world-outlook, for adjustment and co-ordination with the previous contents of the latter; while, on the other hand, by its very appearance on the horizon of human experience it may enrich or illumine, rectify or otherwise influence, this outlook or some aspect of it.(42)  If, then, philosophy has to take account of advances in every other department of human research, it is clear that its mastery at the present day is a more laborious task than ever it was in the past. In order to get an intelligent grasp of its principles in their applications to the problems raised by the progress of the sciences, to newly discovered facts and newly propounded hypotheses, the student must be familiar with these facts and hypotheses; and all the more so because through the medium of a sensational newspaper press that has more regard for novelty than truth, these facts and hypotheses are no sooner brought to light by scientists than what are often garbled and distorted versions of them are circulated among the masses.(43)  Similarly, in order that a sound system of speculative and practical philosophy be expounded, developed, and defended at the present time, a system that will embrace and co-ordinate the achieved results of modern scientific research, a system that will offer the most satisfactory solutions of old difficulties in new forms and give the most reasonable and reliable answers to the ever recurring questionings of man concerning his own nature and destiny—it is clear that the insufficiency of individual effort must be supplemented by the co-operation of numbers. It is the absence of fulness, completeness, adequacy, in most modern systems of philosophy, their fragmentary character, the unequal development of their parts, that accounts very largely for the despairing attitude of the many who nowadays despise and turn away from philosophical speculation. Add to this the uncertain voice with which these philosophies speak in consequence of their advocates ignoring the implications of the most stupendous fact in human experience,—the Christian Revelation. But there is one philosophy which is free from these defects, a philosophy which is in complete harmony with Revealed Truth, and which forms with the latter the only true _Philosophy of Life_; and that one philosophy is the system which, assimilating the wisdom of Plato, Aristotle and all the other greatest thinkers of the world, has been traditionally expounded in the Christian schools—the _Scholastic_ system of philosophy. It has been elaborated by no one man, and is the original fruit of no one mind. Unlike the philosophies of Kant or Hegel or Spencer or James or Comte or Bergson, it is not a “one-man” philosophy. It cannot boast of the novelty or originality of the many eccentric and ephemeral “systems” which have succeeded one another so rapidly in recent times in the world of intellectual fashion; but it has ever possessed the enduring novelty of the _truth_, which is ever ancient and ever new. Now although this philosophy may have been mastered in its broad outlines and applications by specially gifted individuals in past ages, its progressive exposition and development, and its application to the vastly extended and ever-growing domains of experience that are being constantly explored by the special sciences, can never be the work of any individual: it can be accomplished only by the earnest co-operation of Christian philosophers in every part of the civilized world.(44)  In carrying on this work we have not to build from the beginning. “It has sometimes been remarked,” as Newman observes,(45) “when men have boasted of the knowledge of modern times, that no wonder we see more than the ancients because we are mounted upon their shoulders.” Yes; the intellectual toilers of to-day are heirs to the intellectual wealth of their ancestors. We have tradition: not to despise but to use, critically, judiciously, reverently, if we are to use it profitably. Thomas Davis has somewhere said that they who demolish the past do not build up for the future. And we have the Christian Revelation, as a _lamp_ to our _feet_ and a _light_ to our _paths_(46) in all those rational investigations which form the appointed task of the philosopher. Hence,       Let knowledge grow from more to more,       But more of reverence in us dwell;       That mind and soul, according well,     May make one music as before,     But vaster.(47)      CHAPTER I. BEING AND ITS PRIMARY DETERMINATIONS.   1. OUR CONCEPT OF BEING: ITS EXPRESSION AND FEATURES.—The term “_Being_” (Lat. _ens_; Gr. ὤν; Ger. _Seiend_; Fr. _étant_) as present participle of the verb _to be_ (Lat. _esse_; Gr. ἔιναι; Ger. _Sein_; Fr. _être_) means _existing_ (_existens_, _existere_). But the participle has come to be used as a noun; and as such it does not necessarily imply actual existence _hic et nunc_. It does indeed imply some relation to actual existence; for we designate as “being” (in the substantive sense) only whatever we conceive as actually existing or at least as capable of existing; and it is from the participial sense, which implies actual existence, that the substantive sense has been derived. Moreover, the intelligible use of the word “being” as a term implies a reference to some actually existing sphere of reality.(48) It is in the substantive meaning the term will be most frequently used in these pages, as the context"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35722"],["title","Ontology, or the Theory of Being (#8)"],["body","show. When we speak of “a being” in the concrete, the word has the same meaning as “thing” (_res_) used in the wide sense in which this latter includes persons, places, events, facts and phenomena of whatsoever kind. In the same sense we speak of “a reality,” this term having taken on a concrete, in addition to its original abstract, meaning. “Being” has also this abstract sense when we speak of “the being or reality of things”. Finally it may be used in a collective sense to indicate the sum-total of all that is or can be—all reality.  (_a_) The notion of being, spontaneously reached by the human mind, is found on reflection to be the _simplest_ of all notions, defying every attempt at analysis into simpler notions. It is involved in every other concept which we form of any object of thought whatsoever. Without it we could have no concept of anything.  (_b_) It is thus the first of all notions _in the logical order_, _i.e._ in the process of rational thought.  (_c_) It is also the _first_ of all notions _in the chronological order_, the first which the human mind forms in the order of time. Not, of course, that we remember having formed it before any other more determinate notions. But the child’s awakening intellectual activity must have proceeded from the simplest, easiest, most superficial of all concepts, to fuller, clearer, and more determinate concepts, _i.e._ from the vague and confused notion of “being” or “thing” to notions of definite modes of being, or kinds of thing.  (_d_) This direct notion of being is likewise the _most indeterminate_ of all notions; though not of course entirely indeterminate. An object of thought, to be conceivable or intelligible at all by our finite minds, must be rendered definite in some manner and degree; and even this widest notion of “being” is rendered intelligible only by being conceived as positive and as contrasting with absolute non-being or nothingness.(49)       According to the Hegelian philosophy “pure thought” can apparently     think “pure being,” _i.e._ being in absolute indeterminateness,     being as not even differentiated from “pure not-being” or absolute     nothingness. And this absolutely indeterminate confusion (we may     not call it a “synthesis” or “unity”) of something and nothing, of     being and not-being, of positive and negative, of affirmation and     denial, would be conceived by our finite minds as the objective     correlative of, and at the same time as absolutely identical with,     its subjective correlative which is “pure thought”. Well, it is     with the human mind and its objects, and how it thinks those     objects, that we are concerned at present; not with speculations     involving the gratuitous assumption of a Being that would     transcend all duality of subject and object, all determinateness     of knowing and being, all distinction of thought and thing. We     believe that the human mind can establish the existence of a     Supreme Being whose mode of Thought and Existence transcends all     human comprehension, but it can do so only as the culminating     achievement of all its speculation; and the transcendent Being it     thus reaches has nothing in common with the monistic ideal-real     being of Hegel’s philosophy. In endeavouring to set out from the     high _a priori_ ground of such an intangible conception, the     Hegelian philosophy starts at the wrong end.   (_e_) Further, the notion of being is the _most abstract_ of all notions, poorest in intension as it is widest in extension. We derive it from the data of our experience, and the process by which we reach it is a process of abstraction. We lay aside all the differences whereby things are distinguished from one another; we do not consider these differences; we prescind or abstract from them mentally, and retain for consideration only what is common to all of them. This common element forms the explicit content of our notion of being.  It must be noted, however, that we do not _positively exclude_ the differences from the _object_ of our concept; we cannot do this, for the simple reason that the differences too are “being,” inasmuch as they too are modes of being. Our attitude towards them is _negative_; we merely abstain from considering them explicitly, though they remain in our concept implicitly. The separation effected is only mental, subjective, notional, formal, negative; not objective, not real, not positive. Hence the process by which we narrow down the concept of being to the more comprehensive concept of this or that generic or specific mode of being, does not add to the former concept anything really new, or distinct from, or extraneous to it; but rather brings out explicitly something that was implicit in the latter. The composition of being with its modes is, therefore, only _logical_ composition, not real.  On the other hand, it would seem that when we abstract a generic mode of being from the specific modes subordinate to the former, we _positively exclude_ the differentiating characteristics of these species; and that, conversely, when we narrow down the genus to a subordinate species we do so by _adding on_ a differentiating mode which was not contained even implicitly in the generic concept. Thus, for example, the differentiating concept “rational” is not contained even implicitly in the generic concept “animal”: it is added on _ab extra_ to the latter(50) in order to reach the specific concept of “rational animal” or “man”; so that in abstracting the generic from the subordinate specific concept we prescind _objectively_ and _really_ from the differentiating concept, by positively excluding this latter. This kind of abstraction is called objective, real, positive; and the composition of such generic and differentiating modes of being is technically known as _metaphysical_ composition. The different modes of being, which the mind can distinguish at different levels of abstraction in any specific concept—such as “rational,” “sentient,” “living,” “corporeal,” in the concept of “man”—are likewise known as “metaphysical grades” of being.       It has been questioned whether this latter kind of abstraction is     always used in relating generic, specific, and differential modes     of being. At first sight it would not appear to be a quite     satisfactory account of the process in cases where the generic     notion exhibits a mode of being which can be embodied only in one     or other of a number of alternative specific modes by means of     _differentiae_ not found in any things lying outside the genus     itself. The generic notion of “plane rectilinear figure” does not,     of course, include explicitly its species “triangle,”     “quadrilateral,” “pentagon,” etc.; nor does it include even     implicitly any definite one of them. But the concept of each of     the differentiating characters, _e.g._ the _differentia_     “three-sidedness,” is unintelligible except as a mode of a “plane     rectilinear figure”.(51) This, however, is only accidental, _i.e._     due to the special objects considered;(52) and even here there     persists this difference that whereas what differentiates the     species of plane rectilinear figures is not explicitly and     formally plane-rectilinearity, that which differentiates finite     from infinite being, or substantial from accidental being, is     itself also formally and explicitly _being_. But there are other     cases in which the abstraction is manifestly objective. Thus, for     example, the differentiating concept “rational” does not even     implicitly include the generic concept “animal,” for the former     concept may be found realized in beings other than animals; and     the differentiating concept “living” does not even implicitly     include the concept “corporeal,” for it may be found realized in     incorporeal beings.   (_f_) Since the notion of being is so simple that it cannot be analysed into simpler notions which might serve as its _genus_ and _differentia_, it _cannot_ strictly speaking _be defined_. We can only describe it by considering it from various points of view and comparing it with the various modes in which we find it realized. This is what we have been attempting so far. Considering its fundamental relation to existence we might say that “Being is that which exists or is at least capable of existing”: _Ens est id quod existit vel saltem existere potest._ Or, considering its relation to its opposite we might say that “Being is that which is not absolute nothingness”: _Ens est id quod non est nihil absolutum._ Or, considering its relation to our minds, we might say that “Being is whatever is thinkable, whatever can be an object of thought”.  (_g_) The notion of being is so universal that it transcends all actual and conceivable determinate modes of being: it embraces infinite being and all modes of finite being. In other words it is _not itself a generic, but a transcendental notion_. Wider than all, even the widest and highest genera, it is not itself a genus. A genus is determinable into its species by the addition of differences which lie outside the concept of the genus itself; being, as we have seen, is not in this way determinable into its modes.  2. IN WHAT SENSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT EXIST OR CAN EXIST SAID TO BE “REAL” OR TO HAVE “BEING”?—A generic concept can be predicated _univocally_, _i.e._ in the same sense, of its subordinate species. These latter differ from one another by characteristics which lie outside the concept of the genus, while they all agree in realizing the generic concept itself: they do not of course realize it in the same way,(53) but as such it is really and truly in each of them and is predicated in the same sense of each. But the characteristics which differentiate all genera and species from one another, and from the common notion of being, in which they all agree, are likewise _being_. That in which they differ is being, as well as"]]]
