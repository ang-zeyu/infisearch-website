She saw them swoop past on their huge black wings with a solemn flapping.  Then, as each little Fox approached the tree, the Foxes who were there already screamed, and swore in dreadfully bad language at the visitor.  For every little Fox on the tree was afraid some other Flying Fox would eat all the figs, and as each visitor arrived he was assailed with cries of, \"Get away you're not wanted here!\"  \"This is my branch, my figs!\"  \"Go and find figs for yourself!\"  \"These figs are not half ripe like the juicy ones on the other side of the tree!\"  Then the new-comer Flying Fox, with a spiteful squeal, would pounce down on a branch already occupied, and angry spluttering and screams would arise, followed by a heavy fall of fighting Foxes tumbling with a crash through the trees.  Then out into the open sky swept dozens of black wings, accompanied by abusive swearing from dozens of wicked little brown Foxes; and, as they settled again on the tree, all the fighting would begin again, so that the squealing, screaming, and swearing never ended.  As Dot was listening to the fighting of the Flying Foxes, she heard a sound near her that alarmed her greatly.  It was impossible to say what the noise was like.  It might have been the braying of a donkey mixed up with the clattering of palings tumbled together, and with grunts and snorts.  Dot started to her feet in fright, and would have run away, only she was afraid of being lost worse than ever, so she stood still and looked round for the terrible monster that could make such extraordinary sounds.  The grunts and clattering stopped, and the noise died away in a long doleful bray, but she could not see where it came from.  Having peered into the dark shadows, Dot went more into the open, and sat with her back to a fallen tree, keeping an anxious watch all round.  \"Perhaps,\" she thought, \"It is the blacks.  What would they do if they found me?  What will happen if they have killed my dear Kangaroo?\"  And she covered her face with her hands as this terrible thought came into her head. Soon she heard something coming towards her stealthily and slowly.  She would not look up she was so frightened.  She was sure it was some fierce looking black man, with his spear, about to kill her. She shut her eyes closer, and held her breath.  \"Perhaps,\" she thought, \"he will not see me.\"  Then a cold shiver went through her little body, as she felt something claw hold of her hair, and she thought she was about to be killed.  She kept her eyes shut, and the clawing went on, and then to her astonishment she heard an animal voice say in wondering tones:  \"Why, it's fur!  How funny it looked in the moonlight!\"  Then Dot opened her eyes very wide and looked round, and saw a funny native Bear on the tree trunk behind her.  He was quite clearly to be seen in the moonlight.  His thick, grey fur, that looked as if he was wrapped up to keep out the most terribly cold weather; his short, stumpy, big legs, and little sharp face with big bushy ears, could be seen as distinctly as in daylight.  Dot had never seen one so near before, and she loved it at once, it looked so innocent and kind.  \"You dear little native Bear!\" she exclaimed, at once stroking its head.  \"Am I a native Bear?\" asked the animal in a meek voice.  \"I never heard that before.  I thought I was a Koala.  I've always been told so, but of course one never knows oneself.  What are you?  Do you know?\"  \"I'm a little girl,\" replied Dot, proudly.  The Koala saw that Dot was proud, but as it didn't see any reason why she should be, it was not a bit afraid of her.  \"I never heard of one or saw one before,\" it said, simply.  \"Do you burrow, or live in a tree?\"  \"I live at home,\" said Dot; but, wishing to be quite correct, she added, \"that is, when I am there.\"  \"Then, where are you now?\" asked the Koala, rather perplexed.  \"I'm not at home,\" replied Dot, not knowing how to make her position clear to the little animal.  \"Then you live where you don't live?\" said the Koala; \"Where is it?\" and the little Bear looked quite unhappy in its attempt to understand what Dot meant.  \"I've lost it,\" said Dot.  \"I don't know where it is.\"  \"You make my head feel empty,\" said the Koala, sadly.  \"I live in the gum tree over there.  Do you eat gum leaves?\"  \"No.  When I'm at home I have milk, and bread, and eggs, and meat.\"  \"Dear me!\" said the Koala.  \"They're all new to one.  Is it far?  I should like to see the trees they grow on.  Please show me the way.\"  \"But I can't,\" said Dot; \"they don't grow on trees, and I don't know my way home.  It's lost, you see.\"  \"I don't see,\" said the native Bear.  \"I never can see far at night, and not at all in daylight.  That is why I came here.  I saw your fur shining in the moonlight, and I couldn't make out what it was, so I came to see. If there is anything new to be seen, I must get a near view of it. I don't feel happy if I don't know all about it.  Aren't you cold?\"  \"Yes, I am, a little, since my Kangaroo left me,\" Dot said.  \"Now you make my head feel empty again,\" said the Koala, plaintively. \"What has a Kangaroo got to do with your feeling cold?  What have you done with your fur?\"  \"I never had any,\" said Dot, \"only these curls,\" and she touched her little head.  \"Then you ought to be black,\" argued the Koala.  \"You're not the right colour.  Only blacks have no fur, but what they steal from the proper owners.  Do you steal fur?\" it asked in an anxious voice.  \"How do they steal fur?\" asked Dot.  The Koala looked very miserable, and spoke with horror.  \"They kill us with spears, and tear off our skins and wear them, because their own skins are no good.\"  \"That's not stealing,\" said Dot; \"that's killing;\" and, although it seemed very difficult to make the little Bear understand, she explained:  \"Stealing is taking away another person's things; and when a person is dead he hasn't anything belonging to him, so it's not stealing to take what belonged to him before, because it isn't his any longer--that is, if it doesn't belong to anyone else.\"  \"You make my head feel empty,\" complained the Koala.  \"I'm sure you're all wrong; for an animal's skin and fur is his own, and it's his life's business to keep it whole.  Everyone in the bush is trying to keep his skin whole, all day long, and all night too.  Good gracious!  What is the matter up there?\"  A terrible hullabaloo between a pair of Opossums up a neighbouring gum tree arrested the attention of both Dot and the Koala.  Presently the sounds of snarling, spitting, and screaming ended, and an Opossum climbed out to the far end of a branch, where the moonlight shone on his grey fur like silver.  There he remained snapping and barking disagreeable things to his mate, who climbed up to the topmost branch, and snarled and growled back equally unpleasant remarks.  \"Why don't you bring in gum leaves for to-morrow, instead of sleeping all day and half the night too?\" shouted the Opossum on the branch to his wife. \"You know I get hungry before daylight is over, and hate going out in the light.\"  \"Get them yourself, you lazy loon!\" retorted the lady Opossum.  \"If you disturb my dreams again this way, I'll make your fur fly.\"  \"Take care!\" barked back her husband, \"or I'll bring you off that branch pretty quickly.\"  \"You'd better try!\" sneered his wife.  \"Remember how I landed you into the billabong the other night!\"  The taunt was too much for the Opossum on the branch; he scuttled up the tree to reach his mate, who sprang forward from her perch into the air. Dot saw her spring with her legs all spread out, so that the skinny flaps were like furry wings.  By this means she was able to break her fall, and softly alighting on the earth, a moment after, she had scrambled up another tree, followed by her mate.  From tree to tree, from branch to branch, they fled or pursued one another, with growls, screams, and splutters, until they disappeared from sight.  \"How unhappy those poor Opossums must be, living in the same tree,\" said Dot; \"why don't they live in different trees?\"  \"They wouldn't be happy,\" observed the Koala, \"they are so fond of one another.\"  \"Then why do they quarrel?\" asked Dot.  \"Because they live in the same tree of course,\" said the Koala.  \"If they lived in different trees, and never quarrelled, they wouldn't like it at all.  They'd find life dull, and they'd get sulky.  There's nothing worse than a sulky possum.  They are champions at that.\"  \"They make a dreadful noise with their quarrelling,\" said Dot.  \"They are nearly as bad as the Flying Foxes over there.  I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?\"  \"I expect what you heard was from me,\" said the Koala; \"I had just awakened, and when I saw the moon was up I felt pleased.\"  \"Was all that sound and many noises yours?\" asked Dot with astonishment, as she regarded the shaggy little animal on the tree trunk.  The Koala smiled modestly.  \"Yes!\" it said; \"when I am pleased there is no creature in the bush can make such a noise, or so many different noises at once.  I waken every one for a quarter of a mile round.  You wouldn't think it, to see me as I am, would you?\" The Koala was evidently very pleased with this accomplishment.  \"It isn't kind of you to wake up all the sleeping creatures,\" said Dot.  \"Why not?\" asked the Koala.  \"You are a night creature, I suppose, or you wouldn't be awake now.  Well, don't you think it unfair the way everything is arranged for the day creatures?\"  \"But then,\" said Dot, \"there are so many more day creatures.\"  \"That doesn't make any difference,\" observed the Koala.  \"But it does,\" said Dot.  \"How?\" asked the native Bear.  \"Because if you had the day it wouldn't be any good to you, and if"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3703"],["title","Dot and the Kangaroo (#8)"],["body","had the night it wouldn't be any good to them.  So your night couldn't be their day, and their day couldn't be your night.\"  \"You make my head feel empty,\" said the Koala.  \"But you'd think differently if a flock of Kookooburras settled on your tree, and guffawed idiotically when you wanted to sleep.\"  \"As you don't like being waked yourself, why do you wake others then?\" asked Dot.  \"Because this is a free country,\" said the Koala.  While Dot was trying to understand why the Koala's reason should suffice for one animal making another's life uncomfortable, she was rejoiced to see the Kangaroo bound into sight.  She forgot all about the Koala, and rushed forward to meet it.     CHAPTER VII.   \"I'm so glad you have come back!\" she exclaimed.  The Kangaroo was a little breathless and excited.  \"We are not in danger at present,\" she said, \"but one never knows when one will be, so we must move; and that will be more dangerous than staying where we are.\"  \"Then let us stay,\" said Dot.  \"That won't do,\" replied the Kangaroo, \"This is the conclusion I have jumped to.  If we stay here, the blacks might come this way and their dingo dogs hunt us to death.  To get to a safe place we must pass their camp.  That is a little risky, but we must go that way.  We can do this easily if the dogs don't get scent of us, as all the blacks are prancing about and making a noise, having a kind of game in fact, and they are so amused that we ought to get past quite safely.  I've done it many times before at night.\"  Dot looked round to say good-bye to the Koala, but the little animal had heard the Kangaroo speak of blacks, and that word suggested to its empty little head that it must keep its skin whole, so, without waiting to be polite to Dot, it had sneaked up its gum tree and was well out of sight.  Without wasting time, Dot settled in the Kangaroo's pouch, and they started upon their perilous way.  For some distance the Kangaroo hopped along boldly, with an occasional warning to Dot to shut her eyes as they plunged through the bushes; but after crossing a watercourse, and climbing a stiff hill, she whispered that they must both keep quite silent, and told Dot to listen as she stopped for a moment.  Dot could hear to their right a murmuring of voices, and a steady beating sound.  \"Their camp is over there,\" said the Kangaroo, \"that is the sound of their game.\"  \"Can't we go some other way?\" asked Dot.  \"No,\" answered the Kangaroo, \"because past that place we can reach some very wild country where it would be hard for them to pursue us.  We shall have to pass quite close to their playground.\"  So in perfect silence they went on.  The Kangaroo seemed to Dot to approach the whereabouts of the black fellows as cautiously as when they had visited the water-hole the first night.  Dot's little heart beat fast as the sound of the blacks' corroboree became clearer and clearer, and they neared the scene of the dance.  Soon she could hear the stamping of feet, the beating of weapons together, and the wild chanting; and sometimes there were the whimperings of dogs, and the cry of children at the camp a little distance from the corroboree ground.  The Kangaroo showed no signs of fear at the increasing noise of the blacks, but every sound of a dog caused it to stop and twist about its big ears and sensitive nose, as it sniffed and listened.  Soon Dot could see a great red glare of firelight through the trees ahead of their track, and she knew that in that place the tribe of black men were having a festive dance.  If they had gone on their way it is possible that they would have slipped past the blacks without danger.  But although the Kangaroo is as timid an animal as any in the bush, it is also very curious, and Dot's Kangaroo wished to peep at the corroboree.  She whispered to Dot that it would be nice for a little Human to see some other Humans after being so long amongst bush creatures, and said, also, that there would be no great danger in hopping to a rock that would command a view of the open ground where the corroboree was being held.  Of course Dot thought this would be great fun, so the Kangaroo took her to the rock, where they  peeped through the trees and saw before them the weird scene and dance.  Dot nearly screamed with fright at the sight.  She had thought she would see a few black folk, not a crowd of such terrible people as she beheld. They did not look like human beings at all, but like dreadful demons, they were so wicked and ugly in appearance.  The men who were dancing were without clothes, but their black bodies were painted with red and white stripes, and bits of down and feathers were stuck on their skin.  Some had only white stripes over the places where their bones were, which made them look like skeletons flitting before the fire, or in and out of the surrounding darkness.  The dancing men were divided from the rest of the tribe by a row of fires, which, burning brightly, lit the horrid scene with a lurid red light.  The firelight seemed to make the ferocious faces of the dancers still more hideous. The tribe people were squatting in rows on the ground, beating boomerangs and spears  together, or striking bags of skin with sticks, to make an accompaniment to the wailing song they sang.  Sometimes the women would cease beating the skin bags, to clap their hands and strike their sides, yelling the words of the corroboree song as the painted figures, like fiends and skeletons, danced before the row of fires.  It was a terrifying sight to Dot.  \"Oh, Kangaroo!\" she whispered, \"they are dreadful, horrid creatures.\"  \"They're just Humans,\" replied the Kangaroo, indulgently.  \"But white Humans are not like that,\" said Dot.  \"All Humans are the same underneath, they all kill Kangaroos,\" said the Kangaroo.  \"Look there!  They are playing at killing us in their dance.\"  Dot looked once more at the hideous figures as they left the fire and behaved like actors in a play.  One of the black fellows had come from a little bower of trees, and wore a few skins so arranged as to make him look as much like a Kangaroo as possible, whilst he worked a stick which he pretended was a Kangaroo's tail, and hopped about.  The other painted savages were creeping in and out of the bushes with their spears and boomerangs as if they were hunting, and the dressed-up Kangaroo made believe not to see them, but stooped down, nibbling grass.  \"What an idea of a Kangaroo!\" sniffed Dot's friend, \"why, a real Kangaroo would have smelt or heard those Humans, and have bounded away far out of sight by now.\"  \"But it's all sham,\" said Dot; \"the black man couldn't be a real Kangaroo.\"  \"Then it just shows how stupid Humans are to try and be one,\" said her friend.  Humans think themselves so clever, she continued, \"but just see what bad Kangaroos they make--such a simple thing to do, too!  But their legs bend the wrong way for jumping, and that stick isn't any good for a tail, and it has to be worked with those big, clumsy arms. Just see, too, how those skins fit!  Why it's enough to make a Kangaroo's sides split with laughter to see such foolery!\"  Dot's friend peeped at the black's acting with the contempt to be expected of a real Kangaroo, who saw human beings pretending to be one of those noble animals.  Dot thought the Kangaroo had never looked so grand before.  She was so tall, so big, and yet so graceful:  a really beautiful creature.  \"Well, that's over!\" remarked the Kangaroo, as one of the blacks pretended to spear the dressed-up black fellow, and all the rest began to dance around, whilst the sham Kangaroo made believe to be dead. \"Well, I forgive their killing such a silly creature!  There wasn't a jump in it.\"  After more dancing to the singing and noise of the on-lookers, a black fellow came from the little bower in the dim back-ground, with a battered straw hat on, and a few rags tied round his neck and wrist, in imitation of a collar and cuffs.  The fellow tried to act the part of a white man, although he had no more clothes on than the old hat and rags.  But, after a great deal of dancing, he strutted about, pulled up the rag collar, made a great fuss with his rag cuffs, and kept taking off his old straw hat to the other black fellows, and to the rest of the tribe, who kept up the noise on the other side of the fires.  \"Now this is better!\" said the Kangaroo, with a smile.  \"It's very silly, but Willy Wagtail says that is just the way Humans go on in the town. Black Humans can act being white Humans, but they are no good as Kangaroos.\"  Dot thought that if men behaved like that in towns it must be very strange. She had not seen any like the acting black fellow at her cottage home. But she did not say anything, for it was quite clear in her little mind that black fellows, Kangaroos, and willy wagtails had a very poor opinion of white people.  She felt that they must all be wrong; but, all the same, she sometimes wished she could be  a noble Kangaroo, and not a despised human being.  \"I wish I were not a white little girl,\" she whispered to the Kangaroo.  The gentle animal patted her kindly with her delicate black hands.  \"You are as nice now as my baby Kangaroo,\" she said sadly, \"but you will have to grow into a real white Human.  For some reason there have to be all sorts of creatures on the earth.  There are hawks, snakes, dingoes and humans, and no one can tell for what good they exist.  They must have dropped on to this world by mistake for another, where there could only have been themselves.  After all,\" said the kind animal, \"It wouldn't do for every one to be a Kangaroo, for I doubt if there would be enough grass; but you may become an improved Human.\"  \"How could I be that?\" asked Dot, eagerly.  \"Never wear kangaroo leather boots--never use kangaroo skin rugs, and\"--here  it hesitated a little, as though the subject were a most unpleasant one to mention.  \"Never do what?\" enquired Dot, anxious to know all that she should do, so as to "]]]
