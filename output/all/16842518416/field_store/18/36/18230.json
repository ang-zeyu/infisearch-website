Nevertheless, the behavior of no species of the genus has been studied extensively. The papers of Montagna and Tomkins are the only works that mention behavior and natural history in any detail. There has been an increasing awareness of the importance of ethological data and of their usefulness in systematics. For these reasons, I made a comparative study of the breeding behavior of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow (_Ammospiza caudacuta_) and the Seaside Sparrow (_Ammospiza maritima_) in New Jersey in the spring and summer of 1955.  The Seaside Sparrow is restricted to the Gulf- and Atlantic-coasts of North America, breeding north to Massachusetts. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow breeds south to North Carolina. The overlap of the breeding ranges of the two species is therefore small. Furthermore the forms breeding in the coastal states are restricted to tidal marshes, and the geographically peripheral colonies of each species are small. Irregular nesting is the case for the northernmost colonies of the Seaside Sparrow, on Cape Cod (Griscom, 1944:317), and the same is probably true for the colonies of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow on Pea Island, North Carolina, as indicated by Montagna's failure to locate any breeding birds in July, 1941 (Montagna, 1942b: 256). The center of overlap of the ranges of the two species is in New Jersey where both forms are abundant and can best be studied comparatively.       MATERIALS AND METHODS      The adult sparrows were captured and banded, and sometimes the     nestlings were banded. The standard funnel trap, baited with seeds,     proved useless for capturing birds of the Genus _Ammospiza_,     although migrant Savannah Sparrows (_Passerculus sandwichensis_)     readily entered. A Japanese bird net, twenty-five feet long, was     used successfully. Eighty-five Sharp-tailed Sparrows and forty     Seaside Sparrows were banded at two localities.      All of the adult sparrows were banded with United States Fish and     Wildlife Service numbered bands and colored celluloid bands. The     colored bands I used were obtained from the Hinton Supply Company     of New York City, which manufactures them for cage birds. The firm     makes them in seven colors, sold at reasonable prices. With seven     colors, the number of combinations, using only one colored band and     one aluminum band per bird, is forty-two.      In addition, I dyed many adults and all nestlings. Alcoholic     solutions of Victoria Blue B S concentrate and Alizarine Red S     concentrate were used. The males were dyed red, the females blue;     various areas of the body were colored in order further to     individualize the birds. Although the dyes disappeared in less than     a month, the markings were helpful on many occasions.      When an adult bird was captured I always sexed it and ordinarily     weighed and measured it. The nestlings were weighed and measured     daily at intervals of 24 hours. I built a corral of hardware cloth     around one Sharp-tailed Sparrow nest in order to measure the young     after they left the nest. The sex of any adult was ascertained by     examining the cloacal area, as described by Salt (1954:61-75). Sex     as determined by this method was corroborated by internal     examination of the specimens collected.      A pan balance accurate to one-tenth of a gram was used for     weighing. The adults were weighed in a cloth sack, the sack being     weighed each time to prevent error owing to variable moisture and     other factors.      Dragging the marsh with a rope was ineffectual in finding nests.     The birds flushed long before the rope neared them. I found nests     of the sparrows by using a blind. From a blind I would determine     the approximate location of a nest by watching the movements of the     adult birds. Then I would either make a direct search of the     vegetation or move the blind closer to find the actual site.      Many hours were spent in blinds. I had two in operation throughout     the breeding season, and it was from these that most of the data on     behavior were accumulated. Observations were made by means of a 7 x     50 coated binocular and on occasions by means of a 19.6x spotting     telescope.       DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA      The intensive work was carried out on the marshes west of the town     of Lavallette in Ocean County, New Jersey. Further observations     were made at other localities in the county, in particular at the     Chadwick marshes (plate 6), one mile north of the Lavallette site,     where many of the Ammospizas were banded. The breeding Ammospizas     of the localities are the nominate races, _A. c. caudacuta_     (Gmelin) and _A. m. maritima_ (Wilson).      Characteristic of the sand beaches of the Atlantic coast of the     United States are offshore bars which, when exposed, form long bays     parallel to the coastline. These bays become surrounded by marshes     that in turn are inhabited by the two species of _Ammospiza_. The     birds prefer the marshes closest to the ocean (plate 6). I made     trips to the marshes on the mainland side of upper Barnegat Bay and     found only a few Sharp-tailed Sparrows and no Seaside Sparrows in     residence.      The island of the Lavallette marshes that I worked on was     approximately 1400 feet long and 600 feet wide. One-third of the     east central end of the island was covered with sand fill, pumped     there several years before the study was begun (plate 1, fig. b).     The island was also ditched. The four east-west ditches are spaced     125 feet apart; the two ditches perpendicular to these are 340 feet     apart and are situated in the western portion of the island. These     ditches, originally dug as a means of decreasing the mosquito     population, are one foot wide and almost three feet deep. The     excavated earth is deposited in a row paralleling the ditch. The     entire island, excluding the sand fill is not more than two feet     above normal high tide. In August, 1955, abnormally high water, a     result of hurricane \"Connie\", rose four to five feet and covered     all but the tops of the bushes and a few mounds of sand. Low tides     expose no mud flats for the edges of the marsh are nearly vertical     banks and the water along the edges is more than one foot deep.      The average temperature for July, compiled over a 34 year period at     the Asbury Park weather station is 72.6°F. The average     precipitation from May through August, acquired over the same     length of time, is between 3.5 and 4.5 inches per month.      In spring and summer the prevailing winds are from the south and     southwest. Therefore, the south and west shores of the island are     subject to greater inundations by water. The fact that the island     is unprotected by neighboring islands from the open expanse of the     bay on this side is also of importance in this respect. The north     and east shores, on the lee side of the island, are guarded from     the open bay by nearby land. The exposed southern shores, where     there was open mud and sparse patches of cord-grass, were the     preferred feeding areas of the Seaside Sparrows. Lack of exposed     and open feeding areas may account for the absence of this species     in areas that otherwise seem to fulfill the requirements of the     species.      Two major drift lines were present on the island: one within a few     feet of the waterline consisted mostly of dead eel grass (Zostera     marina), and the other, situated close to the cattail strip,     contained a variety of flotsam (pl. 2, fig. a).
