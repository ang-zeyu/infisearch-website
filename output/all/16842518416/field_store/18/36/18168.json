ROBERTS 1902     PREFACE.   Corianton was first published as a serial in the Contributor, 1889. At that time the story was well received by a large circle of readers and the Author was urged by many of his friends to continue in that line of composition, as much good might come of it. A call came to engage in other work, however, and the delightful field just entered had to be abandoned. During the years that have intervened since the first publication of the story, many have inquired if Corianton would not appear in booklet form, to which the Author always replied in the affirmative, but without being able to say when the time of publication would come. Since the simple Nephite story, however, promises to become famous through Mr. O. U. Bean's dramatization of it, many--I may say very many--have expressed a desire of forming the acquaintance of Corianton as he first appeared; and hence the Author presents Corianton, the Nephite.     CORIANTON.   CHAPTER ONE.  THE PRISONER.   The summer's sun was just struggling through the mists that overhung the eastern horizon, and faintly gilding the towers and housetops of Zarahemla, as a party of seven horsemen, evidently weary with the night's travel, were seen slowly moving along the foot of the hill Manti, in the direction of the above named city.  The manner in which the party traveled was evidently by pre-arrangement, and for a purpose. Two rode in advance and two in the rear, while the other three rode abreast, the one in the middle being closely guarded by those who rode beside him. A second look showed that his arms were securely bound behind him, and the guard on each side held the powerful horse he rode by means of a strap of raw-hide fastened to the bridle. The prisoner was the most, in fact the only person of striking appearance in the little cavalcade, the others being rather heavy, dull men of serious countenance; the prisoner, however, had an air of boldness and cool defiance which contrasted sharply with the humble aspect of his guards. He sat his horse with an easy grace which gave less evidence of fatigue from the long ride through the sultry night than that exhibited by his guards; the man, indeed, seemed especially adapted for endurance. The head, too, was massive and the countenance striking; the brilliancy of the bold black eyes challenged contest or flashed back defiance, while the peculiar expression about the mouth, half scornful smile, half sneer, seemed to breathe contempt for all things on which he looked.  The party now came in full view of the city. \"At last,\" with mocked solemnity, exclaimed he that was bound, \"the soldiers of Christ and their prisoner behold the holy city, where dwells the great prophet--even God's High Priest, who smites with the words of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips slays the wicked!\" and the speaker laughed scornfully, but his guards made no reply.  \"Methinks ye soldiers of the king that is to be, give scant homage to a shrine so holy as this--why, think men, this is the abode of God's vicegerent, the headquarters of heaven on earth so to speak! And yet ye move on in full view of this holy shrine unbowed! Down slaves, and worship the place of my sanctuary--so run the words of holy prophets, is it not so?\"  Still no answer.  \"Yet uncovered and unbowed? Ah, I forgot, you are from the land of Gideon, where dwells another of these holy prophets--and, it may be, that to worship at this shrine would be treason to your own High Priest! O, thou bright-eyed goddess of liberty, what distraction, what fears must disturb the breasts of the poor, craven wretches who worship aught but thee!\"  Further remarks of the scoffer were cut short by the guards in advance urging their horses into a brisk gallop, an example followed by the rest of the party. The good broad road, down which they dashed, sloped gently from the western base of the hill Manti to the gate in the east wall of the city. The road had been cut through a primeval forest, and the strips of woodland on either side of it, still untouched by the woodman's ax, made of it a grand avenue. Here and there to the right and left were lanes leading off to the fields beyond, toward which agricultural laborers were slowly moving to begin the toil of the day. These turned to look with unconcealed wonder upon the strange party as it dashed past them, and some few turned back to the city, bent on finding out who the prisoner was and what was afoot.  As the party drew rein near the gate, two guards armed with heavy swords and long spears, challenged their entrance, and demanded their business.  \"Great God!\" exclaimed the prisoner, \"and this is the people who boast of their freedom! This is the free city of Zarahemla! and yet here stands the minions of the High Priest and the Chief Judge to question whence ye come and why!\"  \"We come from the city of Gideon,\" said one of the guards of the prisoner, in answer to the questions, \"we have in charge Korihor, the anti-Christ, who seeks to destroy religion and subvert all government; we\"--  \"Thou liest, almost as well as a high priest,\" broke in the prisoner; \"I seek but to root out of men's minds the false traditions of the fathers concerning God and Christ, and to make them free! I only\"--  \"You will do well,\" quietly replied he whom he had interrupted, \"to make your defense before the High Priest and Chief Judge of the city, and not before your own and the city guards.\" Then turning to the guards of the gate he continued: \"We have brought Korihor from the city of Gideon where he was tried\"--  \"For his virtues,\" broke in the prisoner.--  --\"for his offenses,\" continued the guard, not heeding the interruption, \"but the Chief Judge at Gideon hath sent him to the Chief Judge of the whole land in this city, to hear his case, and he\"--  \"And God's High Priest,\" spoke up the prisoner, \"I charge thee, guard, leave not out the holy prophet, I long to meet in sharp contest the vicegerent on earth of your Christ that is to be--'according to the holy prophets.'\"  \"Well, then, we seek the High Priest and Chief Judge before whom this man is to be tried,\" said the guard, evidently vexed with the mocking tone of the scoffer.  \"Pass on,\" said the guard at the gate: \"Com,\" said he to his companion, \"conduct these men to the Judgment Hall, give their prisoner to the keeper of the prison, then direct them to the house of the chief judge; I shall wait until you return; and I pray God that this bold man may be silenced, for before now he hath disturbed the quiet of our city not a little.\"  As the party passed through the massive gateway, Korihor turned to look back at the guard, and raising his voice, said to the crowd which had gathered there rather than to the one whom he addressed, \"Guard, tell your good people as they pass in and out of the city, that Korihor, their friend, who would see them free, is in bonds for liberty's sake, and is soon to be tried before an imperious High Priest and a tyrant judge, for honest disbelief in the foolish traditions of their fathers--tell them this, and ask them if the time has came when all men must be slaves to superstition!\" There was an instant buzz of excitement in the crowd, for Korihor was not unknown in Zarahemla. A few months before he had been through that city and had spoken boldly against the prophets and the traditions respecting the coming and Atonement of Christ. Since then he had been traveling through the land of Jershon among the people of Ammon, there he met with little success; for that people bound him and banished him from their lands. From thence he went into the land of Gideon where he sought, as in other places, to stir up sedition. He was brought before the High Priest and Chief Judge of that city, and they being in doubt as to what they ought to do with him, bound him and sent him to the High Priest over the whole church, and to the Chief Judge of the whole land, both of whom resided in the city of Zarahemla.     CHAPTER TWO.  ZARAHEMLA.   The city of Zarahemla which our party of horsemen and their prisoner had entered, was the capital and metropolis of the Nephite Republic. Its exact location cannot be definitely fixed. According to the Book of Mormon it was situated on the west bank of tho river Sidon, a noble stream, supposed to be identical with the river Magdalena. It rises in the great mountain chain of western South America, and flows directly north through an immense valley to the sea. The city Zarahemla was originally founded by the descendants of a colony of Jews that escaped from Jerusalem, after the destruction of that city by King Nebuchadnezzar, early in the sixth century B. C. With the colony of Jews that escaped was Mulek, the son of King Zedekiah, and the colony took its name from him. They landed in the northern continent of the western world and afterwards drifted southward into the valley of Sidon, and there founded a city, but what name they gave it is not known. Having brought no records with them from Jerusalem, and being in possession of none of those incentives to the preservation of civilization, it is not surprising that they deteriorated to semi-civilized and irreligious conditions. Serious wars broke out among them at times, but they preserved themselves a people, and by the year 200 B. C., had become very numerous. It was about this time that their chief city was discovered by a migrating host of Nephites from the South, led by Mosiah I, whom God had commanded to gather together the more righteous part of the people of Nephi and take them into the land northward. A double purpose was served in this movement: first, the righteous Nephites were relieved from the oppressions practiced upon them by their more vicious brethren; second, they carried"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35974"],["title","Corianton: A Nephite Story (#1)"],["body","enment, and especially the knowledge of God, to a numerous people. At the time of the arrival of the Nephites in the valley of the Sidon, one Zarahemla was the recognized leader of the descendants of the people of Mulek. It was a Nephite custom to name their cities after the men who founded them, and the surrounding country after the name of the chief city therein. In this instance the Nephites doubtless named the city after the chief man they found there, \"Zarahemla,\" and the surrounding country \"the land of Zarahemla.\" But as suggested, this may not have been the name of the city previous to the advent of the Nephites. The two peoples readily united under the form of government known at that time among the Nephites, viz., a limited and at times elective monarchy. Mosiah, the Nephite leader, became king of the united people. He caused that the people of Zarahemla should be taught in the knowledge of their forefathers; and in reverence for the God of Israel. Both peoples were greatly benefited by this union. The people of Zarahemla so strengthened the Nephites in numbers as to make them strong enough to resist any attempted invasion of Lamanites; while to the people of Zarahemla the Nephites brought their civilization, their ideas of government, and enlightenment through means of education.  At the time of the opening of our story, 75 B. C., something of a republican form of government or reign of Judges had supplanted the before mentioned monarchy. King Mosiah I. was succeeded by his son Benjamin, and he by his son, under the title of Mosiah II. It was the reign of the last mentioned king that the remarkable revolution took place which resulted in the establishment of the Nephite Republic in place of the kingly form of government which under various modifications had existed from the first Nephi, until about 91 B. C., or some sixteen years previous to the events recorded in the preceding chapter. The revolution seems to have occurred at that time in consequence of the sons of the second Mosiah refusing to accept the kingly dignity. They had consecrated their lives to the service of the Church, and had departed on missionary expeditions among the Lamanites. The good King Mosiah II was fearful that if the people elected a king, as was their light under certain contingencies, his sons might subsequently seek to take possession of the throne they had abdicated, and thus bring on civil war. In his anxiety to avoid the possibility of so great a calamity he proposed a change in the constitution by which the kingly form of government should be abolished, and a species of republic established in its place. The principal feature of the new constitution was the provision for the election of a Chief Judge and subordinate Judges, graded most likely according to the importance of the city or district of country over which their administration extended. All the judges were endowed with executive as well as judicial power; from the subordinate judges appeals could be taken to the superior judges; while an easy means of impeachment was provided as a corrective of corrupt administration. The revolution proposed was carried out peacefully under the wise supervision of Mosiah II, who stipulated, when proposing the constitutional change, that he would continue as king until his death, at which event the new government was to go into force. The first election was held within the lifetime of Mosiah II. Alma, the presiding High Priest of the Church, was elected Chief Judge, so that he united in his person both priestly and civil power. Alma was a remarkable character. He was the son of the Nephite High Priest of the same name. In his youthful days he had been exceedingly wayward, and had united with the sons of King Mosiah II, in their efforts to overthrow what they called the superstition of their fathers. Being young men of marked abilities and pleasing address, the mischief they did was appalling. The very pillars of the Church seem to be shaken by their audacious boldness of declamation against it. And it was only through the visitation of an angel who appeared before them in all the glorious brightness, of that heaven from which he had descended, and the administration of sharp reproofs, that they were turned from their sinful ways, and stopped from persecuting the Church of Christ. As is frequently the case with characters of this description, from being violent scoffers of religion and bitter enemies of the Church, they became ardent supporters of both, and, as already stated, the sons of Mosiah II, abdicated their right to the Nephite throne and consecrated their lives to the service of the Church, of which Alma became the High Priest upon the death of his father, Alma; and, as we have seen, was made Chief Judge also of the republic. He did not hold the double office long, however; for finding that the office of Chief Judge so occupied his time that it forced neglect upon his duties as High Priest, he resigned his civil position after eight years of service, that he might devote himself exclusively to his ministerial calling. Nephihah was elected to the office of Chief Judge, and held that position at the opening of our story. By this action of Alma's the office of High Priest was separated from that of Chief Judge, still there appears to have been some participation in the affairs of government by the High Priest.  Not that there was a union of church and state as that term is usually understood, for the Church was recognized as being separated from the state; but while they were distinct societies, they were close neighbors, and nearly interested in one another; they lived separate, but not estranged; and each helped the other at need. And hence it happened that the High Priest at times sat with the Chief Judge in cases involving the interests of the Church.     CHAPTER THREE.  THE BROTHERS.   Meantime our party passed down one of the principal streets of the ancient city, into the market square. Here many were engaged in unpacking fruits and vegetables from huge baskets strapped across the backs of asses, and arranging them under awnings to preserve them from the scorching rays of the sun. In the richest profusion were piles of fruits and vegetables, luscious grapes and fragrant bananas, lemons, limes, figs, dates, bread-fruit and a variety of vegetables such as the tropics alone can produce. Purchasers were already thronging to the market, and as our party from the city of Gideon passed on, Korihor shouted to them, as he had done to the crowd at the gate, which resulted in quickly gathering a throng of men who eagerly questioned the guards as to the man's offense--\"alleged offense, you mean,\" he cried, \"for I am guilty of no crime, except we have fallen on those evil days to which the idle traditions of our fathers tend, when to disbelieve the words of ancient dotards styling themselves prophets, and giving expression to one's honest thoughts has become a crime; or when resisting the oppression of judges, who ever have one ear turned to a priest to learn what superstition teaches is the word of God, be a wrong; and when to be the friend of liberty, a foe to tyranny whether in priest or judge--and an enemy to an enslaving superstition, is considered worthy of bonds and the prison.\"  This and much more that he said as he passed along, surrounded by his guards, produced no little excitement in the crowd, for in those ancient days and distant climes, as well as in our own day those who persuaded men they were not well governed had many willing followers; and then as now demagogues, blasphemers and the enemies of law and order knew what a tower of strength the cry of freedom gave to a cause, however unworthy or destructive of the very thing in the interest of which, ostensibly, they worked.  Having passed through the marketsquare and through a narrow, irregular street, with massive, two-story stone houses on either side, which marked the most ancient part of the city, the guards suddenly turned to the right into a large square, on one side of which stood an immense structure of hewn stone with a wide, high porch, supported by massive pillars, and approached by a broad flight of stone steps. This was the Hall of Justice, as indicated in an inscription carved in the stone above the porch. To the right of the building extended a high stone wall in which was hung a heavy wooden door, plentifully studded with iron spikes. To this door the guard who had led the party from the east gate of the city directed his footsteps, and taking a small wooden mallet suspended by a chain fastened to the door post, he struck the door three smart blows, and a moment later a small wicket in the upper part of the door was opened and a harsh voice demanded what was wanted.  \"A guard of horsemen from the city of Gideon bring with them to the judgment seat of the High Priest and Chief Judge, one Korihor, charged with seeking to breed sedition and subvert the government; they deliver him to the care of the keeper of the prison--open the door and admit him at once--the people are becoming excited and may raise a tumult.\" The latter clause of the sentence was delivered hurriedly and in an undertone. There was a profuse rattling of chains, the falling of an iron bar, and the door swung open with a grating sound. Meantime the guards of Korihor had assisted him to dismount and with their prisoner before them, and leading their horses, passed into the prison-yard. A number of men pressed close after them, but were denied admittance by the gate keeper, who drove them back and closed and barred the door.  Seeing Korihor safely bestowed, and their horses cared for, the guards from Gideon were conducted across the square fronting the Hall of Justice, to the house of the Chief Judge, and presented to him the communication or commitment from the High Priest and Chief Judge of Gideon.  The crowd which had been attracted by the unusual spectacle of the small"]]]
