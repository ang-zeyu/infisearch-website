From _G. b. lutescens_, _jugossicularis_ differs in less buffy coloration and deeper zygomatic plate of maxilla.  _Remarks._--_G. bursarius jugossicularis_ and _G. bursarius industrius_ intergrade in the southern part of Meade County. Some specimens from this area show a coloration resembling that of _G. b. jugossicularis_; nevertheless, one specimen from Morton County has the occiput anterodorsally inclined as in _G. b. industrius_.    Specimens examined from Hamilton County correspond closely to _G. b.   jugossicularis_; they agree with it both in color and in cranial   characters.       _Specimens examined._--Total number, 20, distributed as      follows: _Hamilton County_: 1 mi.

H. Hildebrand, original number 16.    _Distribution in Kansas._--Southwestern Kansas from Meade   County eastward certainly to Pratt and Clark counties; from   Pawnee County southward probably to the Oklahoma boundary.    _Diagnosis._--Size of body medium; color of upper parts Cinnamon   Brown; skull with occiput strongly inclined anterodorsally in   males.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Three views of the skull of the type   specimen of _Geomys bursarius industrius_. A. Lateral view; B.   Dorsal view; C. Ventral view. All natural size.]    _Description._--Color: Upper parts Cinnamon Brown, slightly   reddish, but in some specimens collected in September, in   Pawnee County, near (15´ _i_) Ochraceous-Tawny; underparts   usually Wood Brown, somewhat whitish anteriorly; forefeet   white; hind feet and approximately distal half of tail whitish.   Size: Medium (see measurements), total length averaging not   more than 271 mm. in males and 254 in females; hind foot   averaging not more than 35 mm. in males and less than 32 in   females. Skull: In males, least width of braincase equal to   distance from alveolus of incisor to anterior border of   alveolus of first upper molar, occiput strongly inclined   anterodorsally, temporal impressions usually united in a low   sagittal crest, zygomatic arch heavy and curved at level of   jugal bone. In adult females least width of braincase   approximately equal to distance from alveolus of incisor to   anterior border of alveolus of first upper molar (not   premolar); occiput less inclined anterodorsally   than in males; temporal ridges not forming a sagittal crest. In   young females the width of the braincase is more than the   distance between the alveoli of the incisor and first molar.  _Comparisons._--_G. lutescens industrius_ differs from _G. lutescens lutescens_ in: Color darker; least width of braincase not equal to (usually more than) the distance from the alveolus of incisor to the anterior border of the alveolus of the first upper molar.  _G. lutescens industrius_ differs from _G. lutescens jugossicularis_ in: Color slightly darker, the former being Cinnamon Brown instead of Vinaceous Cinnamon, with hairs basally Deep Neutral Gray in upper parts and underparts. Skull: Jugular part of zygomatic arch more curved (convex dorsally) and occiput far more inclined anterodorsally; lower part of mastoidal ridge more prominent.  For comparison with _G. l. major_, see account of that subspecies.  _Remarks._--Judging from the known specimens of this subspecies, it has the smallest geographic range of any of the subspecies in Kansas, but additional collecting in Hodgeman County and counties to the north and west of it may extend the known range in those directions; collecting in Comanche County and in adjoining parts of Oklahoma may extend the known range to the southward.  The anterodorsal inclination of the occiput in males is the one cranial character in which _industrius_ differs from all of the subspecies with adjoining geographic ranges. The existence of this unique (among adjoining subspecies) cranial character is the principal reason for according subspecific status to this animal. Although it has other characters which are fairly uniform over a considerable geographic area, these other characters, namely, Cinnamon Brown color of the upper parts and medium size of the body, after all, are conditions intermediate between those in _jugossicularis_ to the west and those in the darker and larger animals assigned to _major_ to the eastward. Considering the intermediate geographic position of _industrius_, the color and size are approximately what a person would predict by study of only the animals to the west and those to the east. Therefore, the color and size probably are indicative of intergradation between _jugossicularis_ and _major_. Still, there is the anterodorsally inclined occiput in males--a character of a unique sort--and this influences us to give subspecific status to this animal with full recognition of the fact that it is a \"weak\" subspecies as compared with any one of the adjoining subspecies.  Hooper (1940:2) in naming as new _Geomys lutescens jugossicularis_ referred to his new subspecies a skin-only from Meade County State Park. Our more abundant material from there shows the cranial conformation to be that of _industrius_ to which we accordingly assign the specimens. However, with only a skin available, we, too, would have used the name _jugossicularis_ because the color is paler than in other specimens of _industrius_ and this paleness indicates intergradation between the two named subspecies. Specimens from Pratt County are slightly darker than _industrius_ thereby indicating intergradation between _industrius_ and _major_.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 58, distributed as   follows: _Pawnee County_: Jct.

Top of head, and   sometimes back, darker than rest of upper parts, but no well   defined black stripe; underparts varying from whitish to nearly   Buffy Brown; fore and hind feet and approximately distal half   of tail white. Size: Large (see measurements). Skull: Sagittal   crest absent in females and barely present in males; least   width of braincase more than distance from alveolus of incisor   to middle of lateral border of P^4 at alveolar border. Length   of auditory bulla (from anteroventral edge of paroccipital   process of exoccipital to hamulus of peterygoid), in each sex,   more than 8 mm.; occiput usually vertical when skull is laid   top down; zygomatic arch broadly and squarely spreading,   divergent anteriorly; rostrum averaging less than twice as long   as wide.  _Comparisons._--From _G. bursarius lutescens_, _major_ differs in color darker, premaxillae extending slightly farther posteriorly; temporal impressions usually forming a more well-marked sagittal crest in males; ventral side of zygomatic arch, at level of jugal bone, more curved.  From _G. bursarius majusculus_, _major_ differs in slightly lighter color, smaller size of body; in males, total length less than 284 mm.; hind foot 34 or less; basilar length of skull less than 42; in females total length less than 264, hind foot no more than 33, and basilar length less than 39.  From _G. bursarius industrius_, _major_ differs in color, being Prout's Brown, instead of Cinnamon Brown (less Fuscous); body averaging 10 per cent longer; total length in males from 9 to 9.7 per cent longer, hind foot 9.7 per cent longer on the average; skull averaging larger in all parts measured. Occiput less inclined anterodorsally; top nearly flat, less arched than that of _G. b. industrius_; auditory bulla averaging slightly larger and less inflated.  _Remarks._--Specimens of this subspecies from Norman, Cleveland County, Oklahoma, and Canton, Dewey County, Oklahoma, and most of those from Kansas, are more Fuscous than topotypes and tend toward"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36653"],["title","Subspeciation in Pocket Gophers of Kansas, [KU. Vol. 1 No. 11] (#3)"],["body",". bursarius majusculus_. Specimens from McPherson County have a darker dorsal stripe resembling that of _G. bursarius majusculus_. One adult from Little Salt Marsh, Stafford County, is pale, closely resembling topotypes.  Most of the cranial characters, nevertheless, are constant in all available specimens, except that in specimens of each sex from the type locality the basilar length averages 4 to 5 per cent shorter. In the constancy of size of the relatively large auditory bullae and in the nearly flat dorsal profile of the cranial part of the skull, the specimens from Kansas agree with the specimens from the type locality.  Specimens from Harper County have the occiput slightly inclined anterodorsally and thus are reminiscent of _industrius_ which has an even greater inclination of the occiput. Probably the appearance in dilute fashion of this character in Harper County is properly to be interpreted as intergradation with _industrius_. If so, the actual intergradation may be to the northwest _via_ Pratt County since specimens from Barber County, immediately west of Harper and lying between Harper County and the range of _industrius_, do not have the occiput so inclined.  Of a pair of adults from eight miles west of Rosalia, Butler County, the female is indistinguishable in color from adults of _G. b. industrius_ from northern Meade County and from two specimens from eleven miles west of Clarendon, Donley County, Texas, near the type locality of _G. b. major_. The male from eight miles west of Rosalia is darker as compared either with _G. b. industrius_ or _G. b. major_ and the coloration of the upper parts resembles those in _G. b._ _majusculus_; the underparts are only slightly paler than the upper parts as in _majusculus_. Measurements of the skulls are intermediate between the averages for _G. b. majusculus_ and those for _G. b. major_. These specimens from eight miles west of Rosalia are intermediate structurally, and since they are intermediate geographically between _G. b. majusculus_ and _G. b. major_, they suggest intergradation of the two subspecies. The specimens in question are referred to _major_ because the size is nearer that of _major_. It is mainly the intermediate nature of these two specimens from Butler County, and the intermediate nature of the specimens from McPherson County, Kansas, that have caused us to treat _G. b. majusculus_ as only subspecifically distinct from the more western subspecies, _major_.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 77, as follows: _Ellsworth   County_: 2 mi.

SUBSPECIES OF THE SPECIES GEOMYS BURSARIUS   If _Geomys lutescens major_ Davis is correctly judged to intergrade with _Geomys bursarius majusculus_ Swenk, the name for the full species will be _Geomys bursarius_ because _bursarius_ is the oldest name among those available. Some new combinations of names are required. According to our present understanding, the eleven kinds of pocket gophers named below are properly to be arranged as subspecies of the species _Geomys bursarius_:    _Geomys bursarius bursarius_ (Shaw). Type from unknown locality   in Upper Mississippi Valley.    _Geomys bursarius majusculus_ Swenk. Type from Lincoln,   Lancaster County, Nebraska.    _Geomys"]]]
