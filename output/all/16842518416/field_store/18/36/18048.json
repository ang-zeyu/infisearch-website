Nor will the \"_Christian_\" world ever attain to any considerable degree of knowledge, power, or union in religious progress, until they discover their loss of this science, become sensible of the need of its restoration, and humble themselves as in the dust, and welcome a messenger who comes in the name of the Lord, with a commission from heaven, and with keys committed by the Angels of God--a new Apostolic commission, a restoration of the Kingdom and Church, and power and gifts of God; a new dispensation, universally proclaimed in all the world, with power and signs following; and the whole consummated by the glorious restoration of Israel and Judah to their own land and nationality, and to the true fold of God; together with the second advent of Messiah and all his Saints with him, to overthrow \"Mystery Babylon,\" and reign on the earth.  Such are the events, such is the remedy for the past and present evils.     CHAPTER IV.  RISE, PROGRESS, DECLINE, AND LOSS OF THE SCIENCE OF THEOLOGY ON THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, AS BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY THE LATE DISCOVERY OF ANCIENT AMERICAN RECORDS.       The spirit world is moved, the silence broken,     The ancient Seers from out the ground have spoken.     The appointed years on time's fleet wings have fled.     And voices whisper from the ancient dead.     Volumes of truth the sacred archives yield.     The past, the glorious future, stand revealed.  We are now, of necessity, carried back in our research to the cradle of nations, the Tower of Babel, in order to trace the history of this wonderful science, from the first emigration of a colony to the western hemisphere, till its final decline and overthrow, for the knowledge of which we are indebted to many ancient records, written by the fathers, or ancient students and professors of this science, on the western hemisphere.  Among these we will make honourable mention of the Prophets Jared, Ether, Lehi, Nephi, Mosiah, Alma, Abinadi, Mormon, and Moroni, who wrote and prophesied in the western hemisphere, during the several ages intervening between the time of the dispersion at Babel, and the fifth century of the Christian era.  By the science of Theology Jared and his brother led a colony from the great tower to the sea coast, conversing with the Lord, and walking by the light of His revelations on the way.  By this science they were instructed in the building of eight barges similar to the ark of Noah.  By this science their leader saw God, face to face, and talked with Him in plain humility, as one man talks with another, thus obtaining a knowledge of His future coming and Kingdom, and of the great events of all ages and generations.  By this science they were preserved on the great waters three hundred and forty-four days, and were then landed, with their eight barges, in the western hemisphere, together with their women, children, cattle, and seeds of every kind.  By this science they became a great nation, peopling the entire continent, and enjoying all the blessings of civilization and heavenly light.  By the abuse and neglect of it they were at length exterminated, in the days of their Prophet Ether, who lived about six hundred years before Christ came in the flesh.  By this science the Prophets Lehi and Nephi came out with a colony from Jerusalem, in the days of Jeremiah the Prophet, and after wandering for eight years in the wilderness of Arabia, came to the sea coast, built a vessel, obtained from the Lord a compass to guide them on the way, and finally landed in safety on the coast of what is now called Chili, in South America.  By this science they also became a great nation, enjoyed many visions, had the ministering of angels, and of many Prophets, by which means they knew of the coming, birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.  By this science they also enjoyed a personal visit of the risen Redeemer, who descended from heaven in their presence, taught them his Gospel, chose and ordained twelve of their number as Apostles, and prophesied many things.  By this science these twelve and others established the Gospel, Church, and ordinances of God throughout the entire western hemisphere.  By this science their sick were healed, demons were expelled, the lame walked, the blind saw, the dumb spake, the deaf heard, and their dead were raised.  By this science three of those Apostles, having a change wrought upon them, tarried in the flesh upon the earth, ministered the Gospel and its blessings nearly four hundred years, and then withdrew from the people because of their iniquity, took away the keys of Apostleship and of the Gospel, and its powers, sealed up the records, and caused the work of healing, and of gifts and miracles, to cease from among the people, because of iniquity, bloodshed, and persecution.  By this science they yet live in the flesh upon the earth, holding keys of Apostleship and power upon the western hemisphere, being now about one thousand eight hundred years old.  By this science (being held in reserve above the powers of mystery Babylon,) they will soon go forth, prophesying, preaching the Gospel, and doing mighty signs and wonders in the midst of all nations, in order to complete and mature the Gentile fulness, and restore the tribes of Israel. Nor is this all--John, the beloved disciple among the Jews, is yet alive in the flesh, and is held in reserve, to \"_prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings_\" as it is written.  But to return to our history of the western hemisphere. After the science of Theology had ceased to be cultivated and enjoyed among this branch of Israel, terrible wars and bloodshed ensued. Governments and civilization were broken up, cities and countries were overthrown, all records and vestiges of truth were diligently sought and destroyed, as far as obtained.  And, finally, the whole face of the country was soaked, as it were, in blood, and strewed with the dead and dying.  The wild beasts of the forest and fowls of heaven devoured their flesh, and their bones were left to moulder unburied.  In other instances bodies were heaped up, and covered with mounds of earth.  All government became extinct, and the countries overrun by tribes and bands of robbers at war with each other.  In this situation the records of Moroni leave them, in the fifth century of the Christian era, and much in the same situation, with some exceptions, the Europeans found them after the lapse of another thousand years.  Oh! who can contemplate the disgusting deformity, the dark features, the filthy habits, the idleness, the cruelty, the nakedness, the poverty, the misery, the sufferings, the ignorance of the descendants of this once favoured branch of the royal blood of Abraham and Joseph, and not weep for very anguish, while his bosom yearns, and the fountains--the depths of his inmost soul, are stirred and moved within him!  Reader, _all these things have come upon them, on account of the abuses, the consequent decline, and final loss of the keys and powers, of the science of Theology_.  But comfort your heart, their redemption is at the door.     CHAPTER V.  KEYS OF THE MYSTERIES OF THE GODHEAD.       Eternal Father, Being without end!     Thy glorious fulness who can comprehend!     Thine own infinitude alone is fraught     With attributes to swell a human thought,     To grasp thy knowledge, or thy nature scan.     As Father of the endless race of man.  \"_This is life eternal: to know the only true and living God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent_.\"  Since the decline of the science of Theology, a mystery, dark and deep, has shrouded the human mind, in regard to the person and nature of the Eternal Father, and of Jesus Christ, His son.  Councils of the fathers, and wise men of Christendom, have assembled again and again, in order to solve the mystery of Godliness, and fix some standard or creed upon which all parties might rest and be agreed.  This, however, was not in their power. It is impossible for the world by its wisdom to find out God. \"_Neither knoweth any man the Father save the son, and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him_.\"  The key to the science of Theology, is the key of divine revelation. Without this key, no man, no assemblage of men, ever did, or ever will know the Eternal Father, or Jesus Christ.  When the key of revelation was lost to man, the knowledge of God was lost. And as life eternal depended on the knowledge of God, of course the key of eternal life was also lost.  Oh the mysteries, the absurdities, the contentions, the quarrels, the bloodshed, the infidelity, the senseless and conflicting theories, which have grown and multiplied among sectaries on this subject!  Among these theories, we will notice one, which is, perhaps, more extensively received by different sects than any other. The language runs thus--\"_There is one only living and true God, without body, parts, or passions; consisting of three persons--the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost_.\"  It is painful to the human mind to be compelled to admit, that such wonderful inconsistencies of language or ideas, have ever found place in any human creed. Yet, so it is.  It is but another way of saying, that there is a God who does not exist, a God who is composed of nonentity, who is the negative of all existence, who occupies no space, who exists in no time, who is composed of no substance, known or unknown, and who has no powers or properties in common with any thing or being known to exist, or which can possibly be conceived of, as existing either in the heavens or on the earth.  Such a God could never be seen, heard, or felt, by any being in the universe.  There never has been a visible idol worshipped among men, which was so powerless as this \"_God "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35470"],["title","Key to the Science of Theology (#4)"],["body","body, parts, or passions_.\"  The god of Egypt, the crocodile, could destroy.  The images of different nations could be felt and seen.  The Peruvian god, the Sun, could diffuse its genial warmth, light, and influence.  But not so with the God without \"_body, parts, or passions_.\"  That which has no parts, has no whole.  Beings which have no passions, have no soul.  Before we can introduce the keys and powers of practical Theology to the understanding of men in this age, we must, of necessity, place within their comprehension some correct ideas of the true God.  It is written that, \"_without faith it is impossible to please Him_.\" Those who do not please Him, can never partake of the powers and gifts of the science of Theology, because the keys and powers of this science emanate from Him as a free gift, but they are never given to those with whom He is not well pleased. The individual who would partake of this power, must therefore have faith in Him. But how can he believe in a being of whom he has no correct idea?  So vague, so foreign from the simple, plain truth, are the ideas of the present age, so beclouded is the modern mind with mysticism, spiritual nonentity, or immateriality in nearly all of its ideas of the person or persons of the Deity, that we are constrained to use the language of an ancient Apostle, as addressed to the learned of Athens--\"_Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship. Him declare I unto you_.\"  Although there are facts in our own existence, which are beyond our present comprehension or capacity, which is true, in a higher sense, in relation to the Godhead, still the limited knowledge we are able to comprehend in relation to ourselves, may at least be rational, and be as clearly conveyed and understood as any other subject. So with our knowledge of Deity. Although there are facts beyond our reach in relation to His existence, attributes, and power, yet that which we may know and comprehend or express of Him, should be divested of all mystery, and should be as clearly conceived, expressed, and conveyed as any other item of truth or of science.  Jesus Christ, a little babe like all the rest of us have been, grew to be a man, was filled with a divine substance or fluid, called the Holy Spirit, by which he comprehended and spake the truth in power and authority; and by which he controlled the elements, and imparted health and life to those who were prepared to partake of the same.  This man died, being put to death by wicked men.  He arose from the dead the third day, and appeared to his disciples. These disciples, on seeing him, supposed him to be a spirit only.  They may have possessed some of the vague ideas of men in more modern times, in regard to an immaterial existence beyond the grave: an existence unconnected with any real or tangible matter, or substance.  But their risen Lord adopted the most simple means of dispersing their _mysticism_, their _spiritual vagaries_ or _immateriality_. He called upon them to handle him and see, \"_For_\" said he, \"_a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have_.\"  They accordingly handled him, examined the prints of the nails in his hands and feet, and the mark of the spear in his side. But, as if this was not enough in order to familiarize them still more with the facts of a material or tangible immortality, he ate and drank with them--partaking of a broiled fish and an honey-comb.  In short, he was with them for forty days, in which he walked, talked, ate, drank, taught, prophesied, commanded, commissioned, reasoned with and blessed them, thus familiarizing to them that immortality and eternal life which he wished them to teach in all the world.  He then ascended up in their presence, toward that planet where dwelt his Father and their Father, his God and their God.  While he was yet in sight in the open firmament, and they stood gazing upward, behold! two men stood by them in white raiment, and said--  \"_Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven_.\"  Here, then, we have a sample of an immortal God--a God who is often declared in the Scriptures to be like his father, \"_being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person_,\" and possessing the same attributes as his Father, in all their fulness; a God not only possessing body and parts, but flesh and bones, and sinews, and all the attributes, organs, senses, and affections of a perfect man.  He differs in nothing from his Father, except in age and authority, the Father having the seniority, and, consequently, the right, according to the Patriarchal laws of eternal Priesthood, to preside over him, and over all his dominions, for ever and ever.  While on the one hand, this God claims affinity and equality, as it were, with his Father, he claims, on the other hand, affinity and equality with his brethren, on the earth, with this difference, however, that his person is a specimen of Divine, eternal Humanity, immortalized, and with attributes perfected; while his brethren who dwell in mortal flesh, although children of the same royal Parent in the heavens, are not yet immortalized, as it regards their fleshly tabernacles, and are not perfected in their attributes; and although joint heirs, are younger, he being the first born among many brethren in the spiritual world. They are therefore subject to him.  But every man who is eventually made perfect--raised from the dead, and filled, or quickened, with a fulness of celestial glory, will become like them in every respect, physically, and in intellect, attributes or powers.  The very germs of these Godlike attributes, being engendered in man, the offspring of Deity, only need cultivating, improving, developing, and advancing by means of a series of progressive changes, in order to arrive at the fountain \"_Head_,\" the standard, the climax of Divine Humanity.  The difference between Jesus Christ and his Father is this--one is subordinate to the other, does nothing of himself, independently of the Father, but does all things in the name and by the authority of the Father, being of the same mind in all things. The difference between Jesus Christ and another immortal and celestial man is this--the man is subordinate to Jesus Christ, does nothing in and of himself, but does all things in the name of Christ, and by his authority, being of the same mind, and ascribing all the glory to him and his Father.  On account of the double relationship of Jesus Christ--with God the Father on one hand, and with man on the other, many have adopted the creed, that \"_Two whole and perfect natures_\" were blended in the person of Jesus Christ; that he was every way a God, and every way a man; as if God and man were two distinct species. This error came by reason of not knowing ourselves. For just in proportion as we comprehend ourselves in our true light, and our relationships and affinities with the past, present and future, with time and eternity, with Gods, angels, spirits and men, who have gone before us, and who will come after us, so, in proportion, we may be able to benefit by the keys of the mysteries of the Godhead, or, in other words, to know and comprehend Jesus Christ and his Father.  Gods, angels and men, are all of one species, one race, one great family widely diffused among the planetary systems, as colonies, kingdoms, nations, &c.  The great distinguishing difference between one portion of this race and another, consists in the varied grades of intelligence and purity, and also in the variety of spheres occupied by each, in the series of progressive being.  An immortal man, possessing a perfect organization of spirit, flesh, and bones, and perfected in his attributes, in all the fulness of celestial glory, is called _a God_.  An immortal man, in progress of perfection, or quickened with a lesser degree of glory, is called _an angel_.  An immortal spirit of man, not united with a fleshly tabernacle, is called a spirit.  An immortal man, clothed with a mortal tabernacle, is called a man.  It may then consistently enough be said, that there are, in a subordinate sense, a plurality of Gods, or rather of the sons of God; although there is one Supreme Head, who is over all, and through all, and in all His sons, by the power of His Spirit.  Jesus Christ and his Father are two persons, in the same sense as John and Peter are two persons. Each of them has an organized, individual tabernacle, embodied in material form, and composed of material substance, in the likeness of man, and possessing every organ, limb, and physical part that man possesses.  There is no more mystery connected with their oneness, than there is in the oneness of Enoch and Elijah, or of Paul and Silas.  Their oneness consists of a oneness of spirit, intelligence, attributes, knowledge, or power.  If Enoch, Elijah, Abraham, Peter, Paul, and millions of others ever attain to the immortal life, and their fleshly tabernacles be quickened by a fulness of celestial life and light, intelligence and power, then it can be said of them, _they are one, as the Father and Son are one_.  It could then be said of each of them, in him dwells all the fulness of the powers and attributes of the Eternal God, or, in other words, he possesses endless life, together with all intelligence, knowledge, light, and power. He therefore has the same mind as all the others--is in communication and in perfect union with each and all of them.  All these are Gods, or sons of God--they are the Kings, Princes, Priests, and Nobles of Eternity. But over them all there is a Presidency or Grand Head, who is the Father of all. And next unto him is Jesus Christ, the eldest born, and first heir of all the realms of light.  Every person knows, by reflection, that intelligence may be imparted without diminishing the store possessed by the giver. Therefore it follows, that millions of"]]]
