But I must get something to this cut--Have you no 'pothecaries here in France?

B._ [_Bows ridiculously._] A-la-mode de Paree!  _Miss Dolly B._ Bless me, papa, what's the matter?  _Lady B._ What, have you been fighting, Sir John?                                               [_Looking at his Forehead._  _Sir J. B._ Fighting! no, my Lady Bull--I got upon Kick-him-Jenny, she threw me off, and broke my head.

B._ Oh, very well--Mrs. Casey, get me yesterday's Ledger.  _Lady B._ Ledger! Oh, now, he's got to Garraway's--I tell you again, you are not at Margate, raffling for twopenny toys.  _Miss Dolly B._ Or dancing in your boots, at Dandelion, papa--La now, do, pa, get into the mode, like us!  _Sir J. B._ Thank you, daughter, but I'm not quite so modish.  _Lady B._ But, consider, my dear, if Colonel Epaulette does us the honour of a visit, how he'll be shocked at your appearance!  _Sir J. B._ Thank you, thank you, wife; but I don't think I'm quite so shocking.  _Lady B._ Then, if he does introduce us to the prince--Sir John, to tell you a secret, I have already sent for one Mr. Lapoche, a celebrated French tailor, to make you a new suit of clothes for the occasion.  _Sir J. B._ A French tailor for me!--very well, very well, ladies.       _Enter FIRST WAITER._  _Waiter._ Mr. Lackland, madam; would you chuse to see him?  _Sir J.

B._ [_Looking at him with Surprise._] Shabby!--Eh!--Why, in the name of--Oh! ho!--Ha! ha! ha!--recovered the arables, or another old fool from Throgmorton Street?  _Lack._Oh, pray don't let my presence disconcert any body--Ladies, I dined with my friend Tallyho, and Colonel Epaulette; the colonel understanding that I admitted Sir John here, to some share of my notice, begged I'd make his respects, and that he'd wait on you immediately.  _Lady B._ Now, Miss Bull, summon all the graces.  _Miss Dolly B._ Oh, lud! and the powder's all--the duchess's barber must titivate me up directly.  _Lack._ Miss, don't mind me--people say I'm particular--but I'm the most condescending--Bull, be seated.  _Sir J. B._ Bull! I will not be seated.  _Lack._ Yes, she is a fine girl, indeed.  _Sir J. B._ Who, Doll? Yes, Doll's a dev'lish fine girl, and I shall give fourscore thousand pounds with her.  _Lack._ What!--[_Aside._] This may prove a good hit--but such a vulgar family!--Hearkye--pray--[_With Haughtiness and Contempt._] You've kept shop?  _Sir J. B._ Fifteen years--the Grasshopper, on Garlick Hill.  _Lack._ And you sold raisins, and--  _Sir J. B._ Yes, I did, and figs too.  _Lady B._ D'ye hear him?  _Lack._ [_Aside._] Hem! Yes, I'll marry her--a dowdy--he's a seller of figs--yet, fourscore thousand--  _Sir J. B._ And yet, do you know----  _Lack._ [_Puts him back gently._] Softly--Ma'am, [_To MISS DOLLY BULL._]--upon my soul, you're a very fine creature!  _Miss Dolly B._ Sir! [_Aside._] Lord, I like him, vastly!  _Lack._ I say, ma'am, I--but, hold--I had best begin with a compliment to the mother though--Ma'am,--[_Looks first at LADY BULL, then at SIR JOHN._]--Figs! [_Stifling a Laugh._] Ma'am, your dress is extremely elegant--admirably fancied--and----  _Sir J. B._ Yet if I was to advise----  _Lack._ [_Puts him back, without looking at him._] Be quiet, Bull--with so many native charms--difficult to say, whether ornaments grace the person, or the person ornaments the dress.  _Miss Dolly B._ He's vastly well bred, mamma.  _Lady B._ Yes, but speaks English too plain for a gentleman.  _Lack._ Miss Bull's spirit and good humour, is the emblem of English liberty, and your ladyship, [_Bows._] the Ninon de l'Enclos of Britain.  _Sir J. B._ [_Aside._] Ninon-don--talks French--I lent him a guinea too--well!  _Lack._ I presume, ladies, you go to the ball to-night--if disengaged, miss, I should be proud of the honour of your hand.  _Miss Dolly B._ Yes, sir, with all my heart, sir.  _Sir J. B._ Your heart, hussy! didn't you promise Squire Tallyho?  _Miss Dolly B._ True, papa; but then, I hadn't seen this gentleman.  _Lady B._ Haven't I hopes of Colonel Epaulette, for you?  _Miss Dolly B._ "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35699"],["title","Fontainbleau; a comic opera.

B._ Yes, and I dare say----  _Lack._ Softly, my honest fellow.  _Sir J. B._ [_Stamping._] What d'ye mean, friend--honest fellow! I don't believe you know who you're talking to!--[_Aside._] Oh, oh!
