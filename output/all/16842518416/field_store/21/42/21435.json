He would try to save the fellow's life if he could--he had got him into this predicament, it was up to him to get the chap safely out of it.  \"Well now,\" Yandor was saying, \"I'm beginning to believe you will be a valuable man in our group. I'll think about it some more, and see you sometime tomorrow and we'll talk further about it. But I'm only promising to talk,\" he added hurriedly, \"I'm not saying what my decision will be.\"  \"That's all I could ask for now, for I know I can prove my worth.\" He rose and bowed courteously. \"So I'll see you at your place of business in the morning.\"  \"You know where it is?\" surprisedly.  \"But of course.\"  As soon as he was out of the house, Hanlon went carefully to the weed-infested vacant lot where Auldin had dumped Ondo's body. When he saw the gangster returning, Hanlon quickly hid behind a great flowertree.  Hanlon had brought the bird back to Yandor's house, and now made it perch where it could look through a window. Through the bird's eyes he saw the two inside, talking together for some minutes, Yandor apparently very angry, Auldin on the defensive. Then the slender mobster slunk from the house, and started back toward the downtown section. Hanlon made the bird follow him, to make sure Auldin was really going home, and was not circling about to try to find out what Hanlon was doing or where he was going.  Then the SS man went to the vacant lot to find Ondo sitting up, holding his aching head. Almost roughly he jerked him to his feet.  \"Look, you phidi,\" Hanlon made his voice deadly menacing, \"I don't like people who go around trying to find out about me and my business. Yandor merely insisted that I see to it that you left town immediately, but I'm not that soft-hearted. I'm going to kill you, then I'll know you've done your last snooping.\"  He reached toward his pocket, as though for a knife or flamegun.  The man was a small, terror-stricken rat. But he was not entirely lacking in the universal will to live. Suddenly he half-stooped, then jumped forward, his shoulder crashing into Hanlon's body. The young Corpsman could have maintained his balance, but he let himself fall, as though he had been knocked down by the blow.  Ondo took off like a scared dara, and in brief seconds was out of sight. Hanlon waited several minutes, then went down the street toward his rooming house, grinning to himself. He was happy that it could be worked out this way.  He was sure this Ondo would leave Stearra without delay. Hanlon's hint about that was enough, he was sure--especially since he knew Ondo was convinced that he would be killed out of hand if he ever allowed himself to be seen hereabouts again.  As he walked swiftly along, Hanlon released the bird from its mental spell, for it was now apparent Auldin was really going downtown, or home. But before releasing the bird, Hanlon guided it back to a comfortable perch in a tree, and put it to sleep.  He could not help feeling gratitude--yet still with an awed sense of wonder--about his ability to control animal minds. He remembered so vividly that day on the great spaceliner _Hellene_, when he had discovered this tremendous ability with the little puppy ... what was its name...? oh, yes, Gypsy. And the still greater thrill when he was experimenting later with the dogs on the kennel deck, and had found that he could not only read their complete minds and control their nerves and muscles to make them follow his bidding, but that he could also _dissociate_ a portion of his mind, put it in their brains and leave it there, connected with the balance of his own mind merely by a slender thread of consciousness, yet able to think and act independently.  But it certainly came in mighty handy in his work as a secret serviceman, and he was thankful to whatever powers may be that had given him this ability to do these amazing things. Now if he could only learn how to read and control the whole mind and body of a human, instead of being able to read only their surface thoughts!  But he was trying to learn to be content with what he had, and to use it thankfully.  Yet he never ceased trying to learn more--to be able to do more along these lines.  Finally back in his room Hanlon grinned again to himself as he began undressing. He felt good. He had put it over again. He was sure he was \"in\".  He sat down on a chair and removed the special shoes he was wearing. These native Estrellans were very man-like in shape as well as mentality, but there were enough structural differences so it had taken the expert cosmetician many hours to fix him up to look like one of them. These shoes, for instance, because Estrellans had unusually large feet, were really shoes-within-shoes, to fit his feet correctly inside and yet appear large enough on the outside not to attract attention.         *       *       *       *       *  _In the spaceship high above, intent thoughts had been coursing through the mind of the being. Finally, certain commands were impressed upon the mind of the Estrellan native the being controlled, that would set in motion a new train of events._  _The native cringed as those thoughts came into his mind. They were not the kind of things he would ever consider, of himself. They outraged his every sense of right and justice. It made him actually, physically sick even to contemplate them, and he wondered briefly how he had ever come to get such ideas._  _Yet something, he could not guess what, forced him to do them, despite his every struggling, heartsick effort not to obey the commands he did not even know were commands._     CHAPTER 5   As SSM George Hanlon continued undressing, he recalled his parting with his father on Simonides.  \"How soon do I start?\" he had asked, boyishly eager, at the close of their interview. \"Right away?\"  \"Whoa, son, not so fast,\" the admiral laughed. \"You'll have to have a series of inoculation-shots against the Estrellan diseases. Then you'll have to learn a lot, and especially, you'll have to be disguised to look like a native, which isn't easy. Here are reels of the language, customs and geography. Get a room in the hotel here and sleep-learn them. I think you'll find the language not too hard--it's a simple, uncomplicated one, outside of their habit of putting the verbs ahead of the nouns, and then the adjectives or adverbs. As to their way of thought--well, that's far different. Even with your ability to read their minds, I'll bet you have trouble in really understanding them for some time. I'm not always sure I do, even yet.\"  \"Tough, eh?\"  \"That they are. You can't work them like you do humans--their concepts seem not at all like ours in so many things. We can get in serious trouble through misunderstanding their apparently straight-forward words. So go slow and easy.\"  \"I'll watch for that, dad, and bone up on the rest as fast as I can. Meanwhile, how's about going out and wrapping ourselves around a couple of thick steaks--or some of that good _poyka_ at the Golden Web? I'd like to see Hooper again.\"  \"The grub I'll buy. But Curt isn't here--he's one of the boys working Estrella with me.\"  The lessons learned in time, Hanlon visiphoned Admiral Hawarden at Base, who sent the cosmetician to him at the hotel. The shoes had been only part of the job. There was the smock-coat, which Hanlon was now removing in his room in Stearra. Estrellans had narrow, sloping shoulders, so a tailor had made special clothes--the coat almost like a knee-length, slipover sweater only of a heavy cloth like homespun, with shoulders whose cut and padding gave them the proper sloping look. There was also the divided-skirt sort of pantaloons, that gathered at the ankle.  As he undressed Hanlon looked at himself in the mirror, and grinned. Trevor had dyed his skin all over--not the dark red of Terran Indians, not yet the black of negroes nor the brown of Malayans, but a sort of deep pink. Hanlon had been warned not to take either tub or shower baths, but had been supplied with a bottle of a special chemical.  Naked at last, he scratched luxuriously and stretched hugely. He poured a bowlful of water, added seven drops of the chemical, then gave himself a sponge bath.  As he was washing his face he noticed with amusement the way his ears had been built up with plastic to almost twice their natural size, and the way his nose had been made so much broader--like a giant ape's it spread over half the width of his face.  He was careful not to pull off any of the hair that had been so painstakingly glued to his body to simulate the general hairiness of the Estrellans. And, of course, he had neither shaved nor had a haircut since being assigned this job, and his beard was growing nicely. But it, and the body hair, was the most uncomfortable part of his imposture--the darned stuff itched, but bad. He scratched.  Anyway, he thought thankfully, Trevor had really done a job on him. No one yet met here had seemed to notice anything out of the way with him, as far as his looks went. He had easily passed everywhere as a real native.  A two-man speedster had brought him to this planet, and had landed him just outside this city they called Stearra, in the dead of night. His father, he knew, had preceded him by nearly two weeks, was here somewhere, as were Manning and Hooper, the two other S S men assigned here. A sneak boat came every two weeks, and stayed at a designated spot near the principal city on each continent from midnight until three in the morning, in case any of the men wanted to send messages or needed assistance of any kind.  Undressed--and scratched--and washed--and scratched--Hanlon lay down on his bed and gave himself up to thoughts of the coming interview at Ino Yandor's office. He tried to analyze what he had learned and its possible connection with whatever it was that was keeping Estrella from joining the Federation of Planets; from becoming the fifty-eighth member of that far-flung union of self-governing worlds.  It seemed to him he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50863"],["title","Alien Minds (#8)"],["body","made a good start--although he was slightly dissatisfied with the speed at which he was _not_ getting ahead. Yet he had felt all along--and still so thought--that with his way of working his best course lay through the criminal gangs of Stearra--that by working up through them he would eventually come to the ones who were behind all this. And he was sure this Ino Yandor was his best lead to date, even though it seemed strange that an entertainment agent would be the top man in the criminal world.  His father had not been too certain that this was a logical channel of investigation, but was quite willing to let Hanlon try it--the Corps _had_ to have that information, and each man of the secret service should work the way that seemed best to him. Nor could the admiral argue against Hanlon's insistence that this sudden rise of hitherto-unknown criminal activity just at this time was not purely coincidental.  But the whole thing was such a seemingly insoluble puzzle. From his own investigation since he had arrived--from the \"feel\" of the city and its inhabitants to his sensitive perceptions--Hanlon knew the people on the whole were such swell folks; the kind that would make wonderful Federation citizens, even if they did look so peculiar and animal-like to Terrans. Any race with a religion and a code of living based on such common decencies and high-principled honesties as theirs, was bound to be a good one.  From all he had been able to learn, Hanlon thought the Ruler, Elus Amir, a decent fellow and extremely capable. Amir certainly had shown by his actions all during his tenure of office that while their system of government was a sort of limited autocracy, that he, at least, was trying to make it a benevolent one. Unless all the information Hanlon and the S S had gathered was haywire, this Amir was certainly not behind all this sudden opposition. He had seemed--especially at first--to be very much in favor of joining.  Then who in the name of Snyder was?  Suddenly a new idea brought Hanlon upright on the bed.  Was Amir merely a tool--like the emperor of Sime had been under Bohr? Was there someone here who was comparable to that devilish Highness? Somebody with Bohr's brains and driving lust for power and ever more power?  Hanlon sucked in his breath in sudden wonder--and worry. Was this unknown another alien from the same, or some other advanced and far-away planet as yet unknown to the Corps, working to take over Estrella and possibly--or finally--the rest of the Federated Planets and the whole galaxy?  It took Hanlon a long time to go to sleep... nor had he found the answers to his puzzle when he finally did drop off.         *       *       *       *       *  When George Hanlon appeared in Ino Yandor's office just before midday, the dapper impresario ushered his visitor into an inner room and closed the door.  \"I think Ondo has left town--or died. For I have heard nothing more of him, nor have any of my men. You were right about a killing that could be traced to me being bad for my carefully-built reputation. Well now, about your working for me. You said you knew something about the entertainment business. What can you do?\"  \"Well, I can't sing or posture, and I'm not much good at acrobatics. I can whistle a little, and....\"  \"'Blow'? What is that?\" Yandor used his definition of the word Hanlon had translated as meaning \"whistle.\"  Oh, oh. Hanlon knew he had blundered. In an effort to cover up he said, \"This,\" and puckered up his lips and whistled a few discordant notes, concealing the fact that he was an excellent whistler, and could do perfectly dozens of bird-call imitations.  \"No, I'm afraid that is nothing our people would care for.\"  \"Then how about an animal act?\"  This was the crucial point. Hanlon had given a lot of thought to this, and had worked out the idea he thought might apply here. It certainly would go big back on Terra, he knew, but he was not yet conversant enough with Estrellan theatrical acts--even though he had gone to the theatre several times to study them--to know if these strange people would like it or not. But he had to get in the good graces of Yandor.  \"What sort of an animal act do you have in mind?\" the impresario asked doubtfully. \"Our audiences are very particular. It has to be good, very good, and unusual.\"  \"I think they'll like mine,\" confidently. \"I have eight pet roches, and as....\"  \"Roches!\" Yandor looked incredulous. \"You mean you've actually trained some roches?\"  \"That's right. I've trained them as a hobby. I drill 'em just like our Ruler's residence guards do--and other things as well. I'm sure the people will like the act. I'll bring 'em down and show you what they can do.\"  \"Well now,\" still hesitantly, \"that may be all right. It sounds most unusual, to say the least. I'll look at them, say, the day after tomorrow--yes, I think I'll have time then.\"  \"Thank you, nyer. Then, after I've shown you what I can do about that, we can talk about ... other things.\"  There was a flash of anger in the snapping, black eyes. \"Don't press me, Anlo. I go slow about things like this, and I'll want to know all about you first.\"  \"Sure, I know that. I didn't mean to hurry you--I just wanted to remind you I was still thinking about the main thing, not merely about a little matter like being an animal trainer.\"  He left the offices then, and started toward home. But on the way he began thinking about that man, Ovil Esbor, he had heard mentioned. He took a couple of hours out, then, to investigate many minds to see what he could learn about the fellow.  He found that his initial information was correct--Esbor was a small-time, local politician, but was also connected with many other businesses about the city. He ran a sort of employment agency as his business \"front\", but there were rumors that he was also a \"fence\" for stolen goods, a panderer and narcotics agent, and many other illegal things.  These latter, however, Hanlon registered in his mind as merely rumors, not facts, for he could get no direct evidence of them, even though he \"read\" about such things in many minds. But he was convinced that the man was one about whom he should learn a lot more, as he had time for such investigation. He felt sure that Esbor fitted in somewhere in the chain of criminals Hanlon was so sure was tied in with the group who were trying to keep Estrella out of the Federation.  He went back to his apartment then, and to the training of his roches. He was well satisfied with them--he liked them as pets, and they had learned to like him. When he first came in they swarmed all over him, and all of them had a good romp before he got them down to serious business.  He was also quite happy about the way things were going. He was putting it over again, for he felt certain that through Yandor he could get the dope he needed on the higher-ups. Yandor had never even so much as denied that he had other irons in the fire than his theatrical business. And from vague ideas Hanlon had seen in the man's mind from time to time, he felt surer than ever that he was on the right track.  That evening he again went out for some fresh air. As he was strolling aimlessly down the street he saw an elderly Estrellan native approaching. The fellow seemed very friendly, wanting to stop and chat--and Hanlon found himself grinning inwardly at the old man's garrulous good nature, so like that of Terran elders, something he had not before found here.  The young S S man touched the other's mind almost as a matter of course at the outset, and discovered that the man had lived in Stearra all his life, but was now a lonesome old widower, all his family and friends gone on before him or moved away. Here was a good chance, Hanlon thought, both to be nice to an oldster and to get some more general and perhaps specific information.  \"Will you do me the honor to have a drink with me, nyer?\" he asked courteously the first time the old chap gave him an opening. \"There is a very nice place where men drink close by.\"  \"That's mighty kind of you, yunner, mighty kind. Don't many people act that way to me any more. But there was a time ...\" his voice trailed off, but Hanlon read in his thoughts of the days when the fellow was an important and popular man in this city.  As they walked along the street to the drinking place, Hanlon listened with half an ear to the old fellow's chatter, while he was thinking swiftly. It had not taken him long to learn that in this secret service business he had to take information wherever, and from whomever, it was to be gained. And this old geezer ought to be quite a mine of gossip. Hanlon hoped he could steer it into channels of real information.  Once seated at a small table, and their glasses of mykkyl before them, Hanlon broke into the monologue to say engagingly, \"I've been in Stearra such a short time, nyer, that I don't know much about it. And since I intend to make it my home from now on, I want to know all I can about things and people here.\"  \"Heh, heh, you came to the right place for that, yunner. Where you from?\"  \"I was born in Lura, over on the Eastern Continent. But I found there was not much chance for a young fellow to make his fortune over there--everything is owned by a few rich people who keep all the businesses in their own families. So I came here.\"  \"Yes, you did right. There are plenty of chances for bright young fellows to make fortunes here in Stearra. Hey ah, I remember well ...\" and the old fellow started in on what Hanlon knew would be a long, uninteresting resume of his past life. So he interrupted with a question, or rather, a request.  \"Please tell me who are the most important people here, and what you know about them.\"  For nearly an hour he kept the old fellow on this topic, in spite of the innumerable lapses when the man started wandering in his reminiscences.  Once, when Hanlon had ventured to ask directly about Yandor, he learned a very interesting fact that he gave"]]]
