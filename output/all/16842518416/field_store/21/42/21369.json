He'd shot his marva years before, gone down to earth, spent his millions in a few wild years and returned to Venus dead broke. In twenty years hunting he had never made another kill. Marva were as hard to find as they were valuable.  \"Guess you just weren't quite bad enough!\" Baba clicked to Johnny. \"My claws are dry. Let's go before your mother finds us.\"  Johnny crawled down to the little bear.  \"We gotta think of something else bad to do. It's that or just plain refuse to go. But then they'd think something was funny, sure as shooting!\"  \"There's lots of ripe meat fruit in the tree,\" Baba clicked, and grinned. \"Maybe you could drop one on Captain Thompson!\"  \"Oh boy!\" Johnny exclaimed in excitement. Then he frowned. \"Aw, he probably won't come by here again.\"  \"Somebody will!\" Baba said. \"Let's keep an eye out.\"  The two of them posted themselves in different parts of the tree and watched for possible targets for ripe meat fruit. No one seemed to want to walk under the tree. Finally Johnny caught sight of a short fat bald-headed man and a tall redhaired man leaving the Hunters Hotel together. One was Trader Harkness, who all but ran the colony, and the other, his bodyguard, Rick Saunders. They seemed to be headed for the trading post and would have to pass directly under Johnny's tree to get there. Baba saw them at the same time.  \"How about Trader Harkness?\" the little bear clicked. \"Do you think he'd be a good target?\"  \"A kind of dangerous one,\" Johnny clicked back, his heart racing. \"But where's that meat fruit?\"  There wasn't any question about his getting into enough trouble this time. He just hoped he wouldn't get into too much trouble!  Trader Harkness was a very important man, but Johnny didn't like him. He had started as a hunter and then had turned trader. By killing off most of his opposition, he had become the only important trader on Venus. If he hadn't wanted a walled settlement to protect his goods, the colony might have failed. A hunter would stop at nothing to get what he needed and the colony had had more than one of its tanks ambushed and stolen to hunt marva.  A red, ripe meat fruit was not hard to find. Johnny wrenched one from the branch and held it carefully by its long stem. The size of a small melon, green meat fruit must be cooked before eating. Once ripe, their thin skins are plump full of a sweet strong-smelling paste--a natural high protein baby food.  \"There's plenty more,\" Johnny clicked softly. \"Think we ought to get Rick, too?\"  \"He's too good a friend,\" Baba clicked back. \"Besides he might not give me any more chocolate.\"  Johnny agreed with a laugh, and pushed leaves aside so he could see. He shivered. Below him came the most powerful man on Venus--a short, immensely fat man, who waddled forward rather than walked. On earth he would have been laughed at, but on Venus he was feared and respected. He liked that respect and demanded it.  Johnny swallowed hard. The man he was going to drop the fruit on had once been ambushed by five hunters--none of them had survived.     CHAPTER THREE  _A Dangerous Target_   As the two men moved closer to Johnny's and Baba's meat tree, they appeared to be arguing about something. The trader glittered as he waddled forward. His armor was of the clearest, brightest marvaplast plastic, and his fingers were studded with marva jewel rings. They stopped just a few feet away from the tree. Johnny could tell the trader was angry. Though he was keeping himself under tight control, his heavy jaw was set and his little black eyes flashed under his smooth, hairless brow.  \"I'll put it to you straight, Rick,\" the trader's heavy voice rumbled up to Johnny. \"I couldn't stay in business a year if I did as you asked me to.\"  The redhaired bodyguard was flushed. \"Well, then, I guess I'll have to do it,\" he said in a tight, defiant voice. \"If you won't warn the colonists, I will.\"  Harkness' jaw tightened. \"Better think it over, Rick.\" His voice was still controlled and level. He gripped Rick's shoulder with a pudgy, jeweled hand. \"Remember, those hunters trusted me. They figure my bodyguard wouldn't do anything I told him not to. If you warn the colonists, I'll have to make it clear you were on your own.\" His voice held a threat.  \"What do you mean?\" Rick demanded, pushing the hand from his shoulder.  \"The least I would do would be to fire you back to Earth,\" he said ominously.  Johnny drew in his breath. He knew how much Rick wanted to stay on Venus. The trader got his bodyguards by paying their way to Venus. He agreed to stake them for hunting if they did good work for a year. Otherwise they were sent back to Earth. It was said that men who crossed Trader Harkness never made it alive.  \"I'm sorry, Trader,\" Rick said, \"but I'll take my chances. If you don't like what I do, I'll join the colony.\"  \"I should have guessed it,\" the trader said contemptuously, \"when you began hanging around that worthless Jeb.\" The trader paused and then the threat in his voice was no longer veiled. \"Believe me, Saunders, join that colony and you'll regret it.\" The heavy man turned slowly and moved toward his trading post.  Fascinated, Johnny had all but forgotten the meat fruit in his hand. The trader was almost past him when he remembered. With a little toss Johnny let go of the juicy fruit. For an instant he thought he had thrown too far, but the trader waddled forward just right.  With a sickening plop the red fruit exploded on the top of Trader Harkness' shining headglobe. Dripping purple gobs splattered through the air slits, smearing the stone-bald head. A strong sweet smell floated up to Johnny. For a moment Harkness stood perfectly still in shocked amazement.  Then the tremendous man began to dance about in sheer rage and discomfort.  \"Water!\" he yelled, his rumbling voice rising to a shrill cry. \"Get some water!\" He was bouncing up and down in an odd way, his clenched fists hitting the air. All his dignity was gone.  Johnny stared open-mouthed, awed by his own daring. Rick Saunders stool still a second, and then broke into a guffaw.  \"I tell you, get me some water!\" Trader Harkness roared. Three or four hunters and Jeb, the old guard, came running up. They took one look and they, too, broke into laughter. Jeb was carrying a fire bucket.  \"Never thought I'd ever get this chance, Will,\" Jeb cackled, and sloshed a bucket of water over Harkness. The water splashed on the bald head and washed the bits of fruit down the trader's neck and under his armor. The big man stood there dumb with anger.  Johnny's throat ached with the laughs he'd kept back. He glanced up to the branch where Baba sat. The little bear's fur was shivering with fun. His eyes opened wide, and with a whir of clicks meaning, \"Watch me, Johnny,\" he leaped into space. He kicked up a flurry of dust as he bounced to the ground and up to his feet in front of the trader and the other men. By this time the crowd had grown to a dozen men.  Baba stopped a moment to make sure everyone was watching him. Then the round little bear began a dancing, bouncing waddle up and down. He clenched his forepaws into little fists and beat the air. His face was screwed up into a mighty frown. It was a perfect imitation of the trader. The men's laughter swelled to a roar.  \"Rick!\" Harkness' voice rumbled out, tight and cold with rage. \"Shoot it!\"  The laughter stopped suddenly, almost as if it had been switched off. It had been so long since anyone had made fun of the trader that the man had lost his head.  \"I can't do that!\" Rick's lean brown face was horrified. Then he became angry. \"I wouldn't shoot a kid's pet!\"  \"Well, I will!\" Moving with more speed than it seemed a large man could muster, the trader's hand snaked toward his holster.  Baba saw the joke had gone too far. He leaped into the air, came down with a bounce and shot up the tree beside Johnny before the trader could level the gun at him.  Johnny's mouth went dry. Already the trader was searching the tree for Baba, his pistol up, the safety switch off. The men stood in shocked silence.  \"He's right beside me, Mr. Harkness!\" Johnny shouted, and crawled into full view. \"C'mon, Baba, get on my shoulder. He can't shoot _me_.\" As Johnny came into full view, the trader's face grew angrier yet. \"Baba didn't drop that meat fruit, Mr. Harkness,\" Johnny said firmly. \"I did.\"  \"Kid's got guts,\" one of the hunters muttered.  As Johnny slid down to the ground, he saw his mother pushing her way through the group of men. Her lips were tight together, her face white.  \"You're going to get it,\" Baba clicked. \"Here come your pa and Captain Thompson, too.\"  Mrs. Watson strode straight up to Trader Harkness, her eyes blazing.  \"You ought to be ashamed!\" she said to the man. Then she turned on Johnny. \"And so had you, young man. No planet-fall for you!\"  Johnny's heart leaped. He'd done it at last!  \"Now, Mr. Harkness,\" Johnny's mother's voice was very low, \"what Baba and Johnny did was very wrong. I apologize for them. And Johnny will certainly be punished. Nevertheless, I never want to hear of you or anyone else threatening Baba again. Is that clear?\"  Taken aback, the trader nodded.  \"That goes for the whole family, Mr. Harkness.\" Johnny's father stepped forward straight and tall and put his arm around his wife's shoulder. \"Not to mention the colony,\" he went on. \"We have a pretty big stake in that bear.\"  The fat, short trader seemed suddenly as cold as ice. His heavy jaw thrust out and his little black eyes looked straight at Johnny's father.  \"Valuable or not, I don't have to put up with insults. Not from those two or any of you. If that's the kind of thanks I get for ten years of working with you, I'm through. You can fight your own battles now.\" He jerked his head around toward Rick. \"C'mon!\"  \"I'm staying,\" the young man said.  \"All right. Stay.\" The smooth bald head swiveled back to the Watson family. \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50702"],["title","Venus Boy (#3)"],["body","this man I'd fire him back to Earth. But let him stay. After the hunters have picked your bones, I'll take care of him.\" He turned, and with heavy footsteps walked away. His slow waddle did not seem funny now. The hunters in the crowd stood for a moment, and then followed him.  Captain Thompson addressed Johnny's father. \"That sounded like a declaration of war.\"  Johnny's father nodded grimly. \"I think our colony is getting too big for him,\" he said slowly. \"He's been looking for a way to break with us and Johnny gave him just the kind of excuse he needed.\"  \"Yep,\" said Jeb. \"But don't be too hard on Johnny. Maybe it's just as good it happened now when we got marva claws to buy us some extra fire power.\"  \"You might not have those claws long enough to do any good,\" Rick Saunders cut in. \"I was just going to warn you. Four hunters just asked Harkness in on a plan to rob the stockade. The trader turned 'em down, but....\"  \"Which four hunters?\" Captain Thompson broke in.  A shadow passed over Rick's face. \"I don't know which ones.\" He looked at Mr. Watson eagerly. \"I want to help, though. I'm hoping you'll take me on as a guard.\"  \"We can sure use you.\" Jeb stepped up and slapped the young man on the back.  Mr. Watson appeared to consider for a moment. He looked Rick up and down, and then glanced at Captain Thompson, who nodded.  \"All right, Rick,\" he said. \"You go on over to the guard barracks and Jeb'll check you out. When you're through, report to Captain Thompson.\"  Rick Saunders grinned. Old Jeb threw an arm around his shoulder and they walked off together.  When they were out of hearing Captain Thompson turned to Johnny's father. \"I don't know if I like this,\" he said. \"Harkness may have planted that man on us. I'm certainly not going to let him get anywhere near our claws. I'll keep an eye on Saunders personally.\"  \"But, gosh,\" Johnny broke in, \"I heard him arg....\"  \"I think, Johnny,\" said his father sternly, \"you've said and done enough for one day. The trader is a proud man and by making a fool of him you've given the colony a deadly enemy.\" He turned back to Captain Thompson. \"We'd better change our plans, Captain. It looks like we should double, maybe even triple the guard....\"     CHAPTER FOUR  _The Third Secret_   Three hours later, boy and bear were trudging through the marshberry fields toward New Plymouth Rock. Johnny's bottom was still warm from his recent session with a strap. The boy was in full armor. A leather harness was strapped to the little bear's furry blue back.  The last 'copter had long since left for the rocket field and, except for guards, the settlement was nearly empty. Because of this Johnny had been forbidden to leave his house. A lone person without a gun was supposed to be just what the arrow-birds were looking for. But Johnny wasn't afraid. He had his third secret.  Johnny reached up and carefully picked one of the apple-sized marshberries for himself. It was a rich ripe yellow color.  \"They are just right this year,\" Johnny said to Baba.  The little bear nodded gravely. Both he and Johnny had worked hard in those fields. Everyone did. Marshberries prevented a disease called colds that Johnny had never had, and were the only crop the colonists could send back to Earth. They had to be ripe for the yearly rocket or a year's work was wasted.  Johnny trudged on under the weight of his armor while Baba bounced along beside him. A mile away loomed New Plymouth Rock. The huge mesa-like rock made up one corner of the settlement's barrier against the animals. The thick concrete walls of the settlement, topped with live wires, were joined to the rock on two sides. On its summit, stood a stunted diamond-wood tree. This was Johnny's and Baba's destination.  Baba jumped high in the air, made himself into a ball and bounded on ahead.  \"Hurry up!\" he clicked.  \"Hungry for nuts, eh?\" Johnny asked.  \"Crunchy ones,\" the little bear clicked back, turning a somersault in the air. \"Come on, hurry!\"  Johnny made a face at Baba. \"Bear,\" he said, \"you're certainly getting bossy lately.\"  Baba did another somersault, bounced, and landed on Johnny's shoulder with a thump, almost knocking the boy down. He put his nose in Johnny's ear.  \"I'm a grown-up,\" he clicked in heavy tones. \"Hear my beautiful new voice?\"  Johnny hunched his shoulders hard, spilling Baba to the ground. Then he grabbed him by the harness, and stood up. While Baba squeaked piteously, Johnny swung him round and round. At the top of one of the swings he let go, tossing Baba high into the air.  \"Help! Help!\" clicked Baba, beating paws into the air, and screwing up his face. Just before he hit the ground he made himself into a ball. He hit with a smack and bounced higher than Johnny had thrown him. Both of them were laughing when he stopped bouncing.  \"Gosh, I wish we could have done that for the Earthies!\" Johnny said  The two fell silent, both thinking of the fun they were missing at the rocket field.  They were coming to the end of the marshberry fields. Before them were the great boulders surrounding New Plymouth Rock. Johnny had made the harness Baba was wearing for forays among the boulders--forbidden forays, for arrow-birds nested there. Baba, with his strong nails and bouncy body, could go straight up the face of rocks. He was small enough to ride on Johnny's shoulder, but he was powerful too. By hanging on to Baba's harness, Johnny could go straight up and over large boulders, armor and all.  \"Let's go right by the nests,\" Baba clicked. \"I want to be sure, right off.\"  \"O. K., worry bear, you lead the way.\" Johnny began to chant, \"Grandpapa Baba sat in a corner, 'fraid that his shadow would burn in the fire.\"  Baba bounced over the smaller rocks in the way. Johnny, weighed down with headglobe and armor, made his way slowly over them and between them. Baba helped Johnny over one steep place and then stayed beside him. It was hard going and Johnny's clothes were drenched with sweat under his armor before they clambered down the last boulder and on to a little flat place. They were already high above the level of the settlement. On one side they were surrounded by high red boulders. On the other side loomed the sheer cliff of New Plymouth Rock.  Far above them, from many round holes in the rock, came strange squeaking sounds. Here were the arrow-bird nests! Johnny was deathly afraid. He'd seen what an arrow-bird could do when it shot itself at a man.  \"Get ready, Baba,\" he whispered.  \"Those are just babies up there,\" Baba clicked. \"No danger yet!\"  \"Let's climb up and get rid of them!\" Johnny suggested. \"Then there won't be any here to....\"  \"No!\" Baba interrupted.  \"But why? I'd be protected by my armor and....\"  \"No!\" Baba clicked more firmly. There was a stern but puzzled expression on the little bear's face. \"The arrow-birds are my friend-pets, I must not hurt them.\" He used a word in the clicking language which meant both friend and pet. It was something like the word \"kikac,\" which he called Johnny--\"friend-pet-brother.\"  \"All right,\" Johnny said, \"but I don't understand.\"  \"You mustn't harm them, either,\" Baba said. \"Remember, I brought you here. Otherwise you wouldn't know where the nests were. Even if you just tell the grownups and they kill them--well, it would be wrong. I would have--\"  Baba was interrupted by a high whistling, shrieking noise, and the whir of wings. So quick you couldn't have followed his motions, Johnny squatted down, curled his feet under him, thrust his hands and forearms into special armor pockets. Six strangely shaped creatures were diving straight at him.  Arrow-birds! A dirty greenish yellow, they were long and slender, over a foot long. One could not tell where their heads left off and their necks began. They were shaped like long arrow points. Their gossamer-thin wings were a blur of motion.  Johnny braced himself so that if they hit him he would not be knocked over. In a fraction of a second they dived within fifty feet of him.  \"Go away friend-pets,\" Baba clicked, as loudly and as fast as he could. \"Go away! Bother us not!\" He repeated his cry in a kind of chant, so rapidly it was almost a trill.  The shrieking whistle changed to a low hum. The arrow-birds pulled out of their dive. They floated in mid-air, their wings awhir. One had almost reached Johnny and was hovering in the air only a couple of yards away. It bent its neck out of arrow position and looked straight at him. Its little purple eyes glittered against the yellow green skin of its head.  Then, like a flash, they were gone.  \"Whew!\" Johnny breathed. He took his hands out of his armor and stood up. He turned around just in time to see the flight of arrow-birds crawl into the holes in the rocks that were their nests. This was Johnny's third secret.  The arrow-birds obeyed Baba!  Right after Baba's voice had changed and his jewel claws had come in, the two had made this astonishing discovery. They had stumbled upon this nesting place, and the arrow-birds, frightened for their nests, had slashed down at Johnny for the first time in his life. But Baba had cried out desperately in his new deep clicks for them to go away--and they had. It was like magic.  Staring up at the sheer cliff, Johnny was excited, but afraid. Such a climb was too dangerous to do just for the fun of it, but Johnny thought he might have a way of saving Baba. Even when they were much younger the little bear had been willing to leave Johnny in order to climb for diamond-wood nuts fresh from the tree. It was the ideal place for Baba to hide. If Johnny could climb up with him they would be able to visit often-and Baba was so fond of fresh nuts he might be willing to use it for a hideout.  Johnny hadn't told Baba about his plan. If they could make it to the top he would tell the bear then.  The high shrieking whistle began again.  Johnny suddenly had an idea.  \"Friend-pets, friend-pets, bother me not. Bother me not,\" Johnny clicked quickly, shaping deep clicks "]]]
