From some point far overhead a musical humming became audible. It was not the rasping roar of an aëroplane motor, but a deep, truly melodious note that seemed to grow rapidly in volume. The soft-voiced conversations on the upper deck were hushed. Every one listened to the strange sound from above. It grew and became clear and distinct. The source seemed to come nearer. At last the sound came from a spot directly overhead, then passed over and toward the Narrows.  A cold breeze beat down suddenly. It was not a cool sea breeze, but a current of air coming down from directly above the Coney Island steamer. It was actively, actually cold. A chorus of exclamations arose, full of the wit of the American a-holidaying.  \"Br-r-r-r! I feel a draft!\"  \"Say, Min, are you givin' me the cold shoulder?\"  \"Sadie, d'you want to borrow all of my coat or only the sleeve?\"  And one young man caused a ripple of laughter by remarking:  \"Feels like my mother-in-law was around somewhere.\"  People hastened to put on such wraps as they had with them. On the lower decks there arose a sound of tired voices, saying with variations only in the names called:  \"Johnnie, button up your coat. It's getting cold.\"  The cold wave lasted only for a few moments, however. As the steamer forged ahead the strata of cold air seemed to be left behind, and the humming sound grew fainter. If the passengers on the boat had listened, they might have heard a faint splash in the water behind them, but as it was the sound went unnoticed. The humming died away. The boat went on and docked, and the passengers dispersed to their homes. Every one of them woke the next morning to find himself or herself locally celebrated.  Half an hour after the Coney Island boat had docked a tramp steamer was nosing her way out of the Narrows. She was traveling at half speed, the air was clear, the channel was well buoyed, and there seemed no possibility of any harm or danger befalling her. The lookout leaned over the bow negligently, watching and listening to the indignant interchange of whistle signals between two small tugs in a dispute over the right of way. He dropped his eyes and stiffened, then turned toward the pilot house and shouted frantically, but too late. The shout had hardly left his lips before there was a shock and grinding sound, mingled with the raucous shriek of rent and tormented iron plates. The tramp steamer shuddered and stopped, and began to sink a trifle by the head. At the first intimation of danger the man on the bridge had ordered the water-tight doors, closed, and now he rang for full speed astern. The tramp swung free of the unknown obstruction, but the two bow compartments were flooded and the steamer's stern was lifted until the propeller thrashed helplessly in a useless mixture of air and water. Her whistle bellowed an appeal for help. \"_Want immediate assistance!_\"  Half a dozen tugs, including the two that had been quarreling by whistle, responded to the stricken steamer's call. Their small sirens sent cheery messages promising instant aid, and they began to tear across the water toward her. One tug reached the helpless vessel's side. A second rushed up and began to pull the unwieldy tramp away from the unknown obstacle. The lights of a third could be seen very near, when there was a crash and a frantic bellow from the tug. It also had struck the obstruction against which the tramp had run. The tramp bellowed anew.  A destroyer shot down the river with a searchlight unshipped, her crew standing by to rescue any persons who could be reached by lifeboats. She swung up and saw the tramp being hauled and pulled at by busy, puffing tugs. The long pencil of light danced over the surface of the water to find the derelict or wreck that had caused the trouble. Back and forth it swept, and then stopped with a jerk as if the operator could not believe his eyes.  Floating soggily in the water of New York harbor, in late August--the hottest time of the year--a wide cake of ice lay glistening under the searchlight rays! The harbor waves ran up to the edge of the ice cake and stopped. Beyond their stopping point the surface was still and glassy. The cake floated heavily in the water and showed no sign of cracks or fissures. It was evidently of considerable thickness.  A second searchlight reënforced the first. The two white beams moved back and forth, incredulously examining the expanse of ice. It was hundreds of yards across. At last one of the beams passed something at the center of the cake and hastily returned to the thing it had seen. Rising calmly and quietly from what seemed to be a small crater at the center of the ice cake, a plume of steam floated placidly into the air. It was a huge plume, precisely like the flowing of a white ostrich feather, rising from a small orifice in the center of the mass of frozen sea water.  A wail from the siren of the tug that had run against the ice cake caused the searchlights to turn in its direction. The engine had ceased to run and a cloud of escaping steam was pouring from the tug's funnel. Men on the deck gesticulated frantically. The destroyer ran as close as the commander dared, and he shouted through a mega-phone. It was impossible to distinguish words in the confused shouts that came back from half a dozen throats at once, but the searchlights soon showed the cause of the excitement. The men on the tug pointed over the side. The small harbor waves rolled unconcernedly up to a point some twenty feet from the stern of the tug, but there they stopped abruptly. The tug had become inclosed in the ice floe. As those on the destroyer watched, the twenty feet became thirty and the thirty forty. The ice cake was increasing in size with amazing rapidity.  A boat put off from the destroyer, and the commander shouted to the crew of the tug to take to the ice. There was a moment's hesitation, and then they jumped over the side and ran to the edge of the floe. The lifeboat touched the edge and was instantly frozen fast, but the sailors managed to break it free again by herculean efforts. It went back to the destroyer, whose wireless almost instantly began to crackle. Two other destroyers dashed down from the Brooklyn Navy Yard and turned their searchlights on the strange visitor in the harbor. The semaphore of the first destroyer on the scene began to flash, and the three lean naval craft began to circle around the huge ice cake, warning away all other craft and constantly measuring and re-measuring the size of the mass of ice. One of the destroyers at last slipped outside the Narrows and stayed there, patrolling back and forth to keep other vessels from running foul of the strange and as yet inexplicable phenomenon.  By daybreak the Battery was a black mass of people. They looked eagerly toward the Narrows, but could see nothing but a wall of mist, from which the gray shape of a destroyer now and then emerged. High in the air, however, the plume of steam was visible. It was now more than a thousand feet high and was dense and white. The first rays of the sun had gilded the top, while the ground below was still dim and dark, but now it rose in calm and quietness to an unprecedented height, mystifying the people who looked at it and causing a sudden silence to fall upon them all. A warm, moist sea breeze had blown in from the ocean during the night and had been changed to fog as it passed over the expanse of ice, so that the ice itself was hidden from view, but the tall plume of steam told of some mysterious menace to humanity that the crowd assembled at the Battery feared without understanding.  As the mass of people watched the supremely calm column of steam rising high in the air of that August morning, newsboys began to circulate among them, their strident cries sounding strangely among the silent multitude. The Narrows were frozen solidly from shore to shore, and all entrance to and egress from New York harbor was blocked. Small craft could go out behind Staten Island through the Kill van Kull, and some vessels could use the other channel which goes from the East River into the Sound, but the great Ambrose Channel---one-third the size of the Panama Canal--and the broad opening that made New York the greatest port on the Atlantic coast was closed. The growth of the ice cake had greatly lessened, so that it could be predicted that it would not expand far beyond its present size, but its origin and the means by which it resisted the disintegrating effect of the August warmth were utterly unknown. The cause of the plume of steam from the center of the ice cake was an unfathomable mystery.  Suddenly, from the empty sky, there came a deep, musical humming. Instinctively people looked up. The humming grew louder and more distinct, while curious eyes swept the sky.  Then a black speck appeared below one of the fleecy white clouds and dropped toward the earth. A thousand feet, two thousand feet it fell, then checked and hung steadily in the air. Those who looked with the naked eye could only discern that it seemed like a wingless black splinter suspended above the earth, but those who had glasses saw the whir of dark disks above a black, stream-lined body. A small cabin was placed amidships, and a misshapen globe hung from chains below. It was still for several minutes. The passenger or passengers seemed to be inspecting the earth below, and particularly the ice cake, with deliberation and care. Then it began to rise with the same deliberation and certainty, swung around, and sped off with incredible speed toward the northeast. The humming sound grew fainter and died away, but the crowd standing on the Battery began to murmur with a nameless sense of fear.     CHAPTER II.   New York was frightened, and the newspapers as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50585"],["title","A Thousand Degrees Below Zero (#1)"],["body","appeared did not allay that fear. The conservative _Tribunal_ ran a scare head: HAS THE GLACIAL AGE COME AGAIN? and printed underneath a résumé of the phenomena up to the time of going to press--which did not include the appearance of the black flyer--with an interview from a prominent scientist. An enterprising reporter had routed the worthy gentleman out of bed and rushed him to the scene of the expanding ice cake in a fast motor boat, taking down in shorthand his comments on the matter. The scientist had been much puzzled, but spoke at length nevertheless. He said in part:      Has the glacial age come again? I do not know. I can only say that     we have no certain knowledge of the original cause of the glacial     period  and we cannot say definitely that it did not begin in     precisely this fashion. We have volcanos which radiate incredible     quantities of heat to the country surrounding them. No phenomenon     like this has occurred before, but it may be that some unknown     cause may bring to the surface a condition the antithesis of a     volcano, which, instead of radiating heat, will bring on local     glacierlike conditions. One might go farther and suggest that the     earth may alternate between periods of volcanic activity, during     which it is warm and conditions are favorable for habitation and     growth, and periods of this new antivolcanic activity during which     frigidity is normal, and mankind may be forced to take refuge in     the tropic zones. Still, I cannot say definitely.  The eminent scientist went on for two full columns, during which he refused to say anything definite, but suggested so many alarming possibilities that every one who read the _Tribunal_ was thrown into a state of mind not far from panic. He offered no explanation of the plume of steam.  When the appearance of the black flyer became known in the newspaper offices, city editors threw up their hands. The less conservative printed the wildest explanations. They put forth a virulent-organism theory, which, it must be admitted, was no farther from the truth than most of the others. The story began with an interview with the boatswain in charge of the boat crew from the destroyer:      We were ordered to take the men off the ice and to take especial     care not to be nipped ourselves. We rowed carefully toward the edge     of the ice cake, with the light of the searchlights to guide us. We     would see where the floe began, when the waves dropped back from     it. I've been in Northern seas, but I never saw anything like that.     The edge of the ice wasn't smooth and worn away by the waves. It     was rough with frost crystals that reached out like fingers     grabbing at the things near by. When we came close to the edge some     of the men in my boat were scared, and I don't blame them. I'd     dipped my hand overboard and the water was warm--and twenty feet     away there was that mass of ice! We backed up to the ice cake and     took off the men. I was looking over the side of the life boat, and     saw those long crystals forming and growing while I watched. They     were huge, from two feet long for the largest to three or four     inches for the smallest. They reached out and reached out terribly.     The stern of the boat was touching the ice, and I saw them reaching     for the hull like the tentacles of an octopus. They fastened on and     began to grow thicker. We took oars and smashed them, feeling     frightened as one is frightened in a nightmare. As fast as we broke     them they formed again, and the men on the ice seemed to be rotten     slow getting into the boat, though I don't doubt but they were     hurrying all they knew how. When they were all aboard we had to     work like mad to get clear.  The paper went on to expound its own idea of what had happened:      The sinister growth of the ice crystals is significant There has     always been notice of and comment upon the striking similarity     between the growth of crystals and the growth of plants. Until now     all scientific text-books have said that crystals could only grow     in a supersaturate solution of their own substance, and claimed     that they were not organic growths--in the sense of growths caused     by an intelligence within the crystal. Is it not possible that the     scientists have been wrong? Is it not possible that crystals are     growths in the same way that plants are growths? Granting that, what     is to keep a scientist from isolating and cultivating the crystal     embryo? We have done that with germs, and with the life germs in     eggs and plants. We can even use a process of parthenogenesis and     create monsters from the unfertilized eggs of frogs and sea urchins.     Why could not this scientist experiment until the life germ of the     ice crystal could be developed and enlarged? Why could not this     development continue until the germ could not only create its     crystals under the most favorable conditions of temperature, but     _at the normal temperature of water_? At the Harvard laboratories     water has been, kept liquid far below its normal freezing-point,     and under tremendous pressure has been found to remain ice at a     temperature of one hundred degrees Fahrenheit! Can we doubt that     this appearance of ice at this extraordinary season is due to the     malicious activities of a foreign government, envious of our     magnificent merchant marine and commerce?  The explanation was ingenious, but though the scientific facts quoted were quite correct the inference was hardly justifiable. Water can and does reach a temperature several degrees below 32° Fahrenheit without solidifying--as may be proved by putting a glass of water in a cold room in winter--but the slightest jar causes the instantaneous formation of ice crystals, and in a little while the whole mass is solid. The fact of \"hot\" ice must also be admitted, but it requires a pressure of rather more than fifty tons to the square inch, and is rarely attempted.  This paper also was forced to admit as inexplicable the plume of steam which rose from a thousand to fifteen hundred feet into the air. In any event, the claim that a certain unfriendly foreign government was trying to ruin the commerce of the United States was effectively squashed by cablegrams from Gibraltar, Folkestone, and Yokohama. Three great icebergs had formed in the Straits of Gibraltar and extended until they joined, when a solid mass of ice made a bridge that once more rejoined the continents of Africa and Europe, from Ceuta to the Rock. The plumes of steam were visible here, too. Three mighty columns of white mist rose at equal distances across the gap.  Folkestone harbor was a mass of ice. A great transatlantic liner had been caught in the expanding berg, and the huge hull had been crushed like so much cardboard. The passengers and crew had escaped across the ice. The great steam plume made a wonderful sight for miles around. Yokohama was similarly visited. Three battleships of the Japanese fleet were frozen in and their hulls cracked and broken. The plume of steam--nearly two thousand feet high--had aroused the latent superstition of the Japanese and was being exorcised in every Shinto temple in the kingdom.  The panic which was engendered by the mysteries of the icebergs and the unknown motives of the men so obviously responsible for their appearance grew in intensity. New York was in a blue funk. The police felt the tremor that means that at any moment the crowds thronging the streets might break and from sheer panic become uncontrollable. Every patrolman wore a worried frown and worked like mad to keep the crowds moving, moving always. The strain was becoming greater, however, and troops were being hastily moved into the city when an announcement was made by the British foreign office:      It has been decided to make public a communication received at the     foreign office bearing on the blocking of Folkestone harbor, the     Straits of Gibraltar, Yokohama, and New York. The communication is     dated from \"The Dictatorial Residence,\" and reads as follows:      \"TO THE PREMIER OF GREAT BRITAIN: You are informed that the     blocking of Folkestone harbor, as well as that of the Straits of     Gibraltar, New York, and Yokohama, is evidence of my intention and     power to assume control of the governments of the world as dictator.     Present administrations and systems of government will continue in     power under my direction and subject to my commands. The machinery     of the League of Nations is to be used to enforce my decrees. You     will readily understand that the same means I used to block the     harbors and straits now frozen over can be extended indefinitely.     Rivers can be made to cease to flow, lakes to irrigate, and all     commerce and agriculture forced to suspend its activity. This will     be done, if it is made necessary by the refusal of the governments     of the world to accede to my demands. Given under my hand at the     dictatorial residence,      \"(Signed) WLADISLAW VARRHUS.\"      The foreign office offers this communication to allay the fears of     the public that a new glacial period may be imminent, but at the     same time it wishes to assure the British people that the demands     of the writer are not taken seriously. It is evident that the maker     of such absurd demands is insane, and though he may be able to     cause perhaps serious inconvenience to commerce, a means of     nullifying his invention will be forthcoming in a short while.     British scientists are studying the Folkestone phenomena and are     confident of a prompt solution of the problem.  Though it might have been expected that such an announcement as that of the intention of an unknown and probably insane man to make himself ruler of the world would have caused even greater panic, the reverse was actually the case.
