Look, Hal, change all the dials, change the dials, set them to deep melt and regeneration. One week. This is like leukemia. Got it? This is like leukemia.\"  June rose. It was time for her to take over the job. She leaned across his desk and spoke into the speaker system. \"Doctor Walton talking,\" she said. \"This is to the women. Don't let any of the men work any more; they'll kill themselves. See that they all go into the tanks right away. Set the tank dials for deep regeneration. You can see how from the ones that are set.\"  Two exhausted and frightened women clattered in the doorway with a stretcher. Their hands were scratched and oily from helping to set up tanks.  \"That order includes you,\" she told Max sternly and caught him as he swayed.  Max saw the stretcher bearers and struggled upright. \"Ten more minutes,\" he said clearly. \"Might think of an idea. Something not right in this setup. I have to figure how to prevent a relapse, how the thing started.\"  He knew more bacteriology than she did; she had to help him think. She motioned the bearers to wait, fixed a breathing mask for Max from a cylinder of CO_{2} and the opened one of oxygen. Max went back to his desk.  She walked up and down, trying to think, remembering the hamsters. The melting sickness, it was called. Melting. She struggled with an impulse to open a tank which held one of the men. She wanted to look in, see if that would explain the name.  Melting Sickness....  Footsteps came and Pat Mead stood uncertainly in the doorway. Tall, handsome, rugged, a pioneer. \"Anything I can do?\" he asked.  She barely looked at him. \"You can stay out of our way. We're busy.\"  \"I'd like to help,\" he said.  \"Very funny.\" She was vicious, enjoying the whip of her words. \"Every man is dying because you're a carrier, and you want to help.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He stood nervously clenching and unclenching his hands. \"A guinea pig, maybe. I'm immune. All the Meads are.\"  \"Go away.\" God, why couldn't she think? What makes a Mead immune?  \"Aw, let 'im alone,\" Max muttered. \"Pat hasn't done anything.\" He went waveringly to the microscope, took a tiny sliver from his finger, suspended it in a slide and slipped it under the lens with detached habitual dexterity. \"Something funny going on,\" he said to June. \"Symptoms don't feel right.\"  After a moment he straightened and motioned for her to look. \"Leucocytes, phagocytes--\" He was bewildered. \"My own--\"  She looked in, and then looked back at Pat in a growing wave of horror. \"They're not your own, Max!\" she whispered.  Max rested a hand on the table to brace himself, put his eye to the microscope, and looked again. June knew what he saw. Phagocytes, leucocytes, attacking and devouring his tissues in a growing incredible horde, multiplying insanely.  _Not his phagocytes! Pat Mead's!_ The Meads' evolved cells had learned too much. They were contagious. And not Pat Mead's.... How much alike _were_ the Meads?... Mead cells contagious from one to another, not a disease attacking or being fought, but acting as normal leucocytes in whatever body they were in! The leucocytes of tall, red-headed people, finding no strangeness in the bloodstream of any of the tall, red-headed people. No strangeness.... A toti-potent leucocyte finding its way into cellular wombs.  The womblike life tanks. For the men of the _Explorer_, a week's cure with deep melting to de-differentiate the leucocytes and turn them back to normal tissue, then regrowth and reforming from the cells that were there. From the cells that _were_ there. _From the cells that were there...._  \"Pat--\"  \"I know.\" Pat began to laugh, his face twisted with sudden understanding. \"I understand. I get it. I'm a contagious personality. That's funny, isn't it?\"  Max rose suddenly from the microscope and lurched toward him, fists clenched. Pat caught him as he fell, and the bewildered stretcher bearers carried him out to the tanks.         *       *       *       *       *  For a week June tended the tanks. The other women volunteered to help, but she refused. She said nothing, hoping her guess would not be true.  \"Is everything all right?\" Elsie asked her anxiously. \"How is Jerry coming along?\" Elsie looked haggard and worn, like all the women, from doing the work that the men had always done.  \"He's fine,\" June said tonelessly, shutting tight the door of the tank room. \"They're all fine.\"  \"That's good,\" Elsie said, but she looked more frightened than before.  June firmly locked the tank room door and the girl went away.  The other women had been listening, and now they wandered back to their jobs, unsatisfied by June's answer, but not daring to ask for the actual truth. They were there whenever June went into the tank room, and they were still there--or relieved by others; June was not sure--when she came out. And always some one of them asked the unvarying question for all the others, and June gave the unvarying answer. But she kept the key. No woman but herself knew what was going on in the life tanks.  Then the day of completion came. June told no one of the hour. She went into the room as on the other days, locked the door behind her, and there was the nightmare again. This time it was reality and she wandered down a path between long rows of coffinlike tanks, calling, \"Max! Max!\" silently and looking into each one as it opened.  But each face she looked at was the same. Watching them dissolve and regrow in the nutrient solution, she had only been able to guess at the horror of what was happening. Now she knew.  They were all the same lean-boned, blond-skinned face, with a pin-feather growth of reddish down on cheeks and scalp. All horribly--and handsomely--the same.  A medical kit lay carelessly on the floor beside Max's tank. She stood near the bag. \"Max,\" she said, and found her throat closing. The canned voice of the mechanical mocked her, speaking glibly about waking and sitting up. \"I'm sorry, Max....\"  The tall man with rugged features and bright blue eyes sat up sleepily and lifted an eyebrow at her, and ran his hand over his red-fuzzed head in a gesture of bewilderment.  \"What's the matter, June?\" he asked drowsily.  She gripped his arm. \"Max--\"  He compared the relative size of his arm with her hand and said wonderingly, \"You shrank.\"  \"I know, Max. I know.\"  He turned his head and looked at his arms and legs, pale blond arms and legs with a down of red hair. He touched the thick left arm, squeezed a pinch of hard flesh. \"It isn't mine,\" he said, surprised. \"But I can feel it.\"  Watching his face was like watching a stranger mimicking and distorting Max's expressions. Max in fear. Max trying to understand what had happened to him, looking around at the other men sitting up in their tanks. Max feeling the terror that was in herself and all the men as they stared at themselves and their friends and saw what they had become.  \"We're all Pat Mead,\" he said harshly. \"All the Meads are Pat Mead. That's why he was surprised to see people who didn't look like himself.\"  \"Yes, Max.\"  \"Max,\" he repeated. \"It's me, all right. The nervous system didn't change.\" His new blue eyes held hers. \"My love didn't, either. Did yours? Did it, June?\"  \"No, Max.\" But she couldn't know yet. She had loved Max with the thin, ironic face, the rumpled black hair and the twisted smile that never really hid his quick sympathy. Now he was Pat Mead. Could he also be Max? \"Of course I still love you, darling.\"  He grinned. It was still the wry smile of Max, though fitting strangely on the handsome new blond face. \"Then it isn't so bad. It might even be pretty good. I envied him this big, muscular body. If Pat or any of these Meads so much as looks at you, I'm going to knock his block off. Understand?\"         *       *       *       *       *  She laughed and couldn't stop. It wasn't that funny. But it was still Max, trying to be unafraid, drawing on humor. Maybe the rest of the men would also be their old selves, enough so the women would not feel that their men were strangers.  Behind her, male voices spoke characteristically. She did not have to turn to know which was which: \"This is one way to keep a guy from stealing your girl,\" that was Len Marlow; \"I've got to write down all my reactions,\" Hal Barton; \"Now I can really work that hillside vein of metal,\" St. Clair. Then others complaining, swearing, laughing bitterly at the trick that had been played on them and their flirting, tempted women. She knew who they were. Their women would know them apart, too.  \"We'll go outside,\" Max said. \"You and I. Maybe the shock won't be so bad to the women after they see me.\" He paused. \"You didn't tell them, did you?\"  \"I couldn't. I wasn't sure. I--was hoping I was wrong.\"  She opened the door and closed it quickly. There was a small crowd on the other side.  \"Hello, Pat,\" Elsie said uncertainly, trying to look past them into the tank room before the door shut.  \"I'm not Pat, I'm Max,\" said the tall man with the blue eyes and the fuzz-reddened skull. \"Listen--\"  \"Good heavens, Pat, what happened to your hair?\" Shelia asked.  \"I'm Max,\" insisted the man with the handsome face and the sharp blue eyes. \"Don't you get it? I'm Max Stark. The melting sickness is Mead cells. We caught them from Pat. They adapted us to Minos. They also changed us all into Pat Mead.\"  The women stared at him, at each other. They shook their heads.  \"They don't understand,\" June said. \"I couldn't have if I hadn't seen it happening, Max.\"  \"It's Pat,\" said Shelia, dazedly stubborn. \"He shaved off his hair. It's some kind of joke.\"  Max shook her shoulders, glaring down at her face. \"I'm Max. Max Stark. They all look like me. Do you hear? It's funny, but it's not a joke. Laugh for us, for God's sake!\"  \"It's too much,\" said June. \"They'll have to see.\"  She opened the door and let them in. They hurried past her to the tanks, looking at forty-six identical blond faces, beginning "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50774"],["title","Contagion (#6)"],["body","call in frightened voices:  \"Jerry!\"  \"Harry!\"  \"Lee, where are you, sweetheart--\"  June shut the door on the voices that were growing hysterical, the women terrified and helpless, the men shouting to let the women know who they were.  \"It isn't easy,\" said Max, looking down at his own thick muscles. \"But you aren't changed and the other girls aren't. That helps.\"  Through the muffled noise and hysteria, a bell was ringing.  \"It's the airlock,\" June said.  Peering in the viewplate were nine Meads from Alexandria. To all appearances, eight of them were Pat Mead at various ages, from fifteen to fifty, and the other was a handsome, leggy, red-headed girl who could have been his sister.  Regretfully, they explained through the voice tube that they had walked over from Alexandria to bring news that the plane pilot had contracted melting sickness there and had died.  They wanted to come in.         *       *       *       *       *  June and Max told them to wait and returned to the tank room. The men were enjoying their new height and strength, and the women were bewilderedly learning that they could tell one Pat Mead from another, by voice, by gesture of face or hand. The panic was gone. In its place was a dull acceptance of the fantastic situation.  Max called for attention. \"There are nine Meads outside who want to come in. They have different names, but they're all Pat Mead.\"  They frowned or looked blank, and George Barton asked, \"Why didn't you let them in? I don't see any problem.\"  \"One of them,\" said Max soberly, \"is a girl. _Patricia_ Mead. The girl wants to come in.\"  There was a long silence while the implication settled to the fear center of the women's minds. Shelia the beautiful felt it first. She cried, \"No! Please don't let her in!\" There was real fright in her tone and the women caught it quickly.  Elsie clung to Jerry, begging, \"You don't want me to change, do you, Jerry? You like me the way I am! Tell me you do!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The other girls backed away. It was illogical, but it was human. June felt terror rising in herself. She held up her hand for quiet, and presented the necessity to the group.  \"Only half of us can leave Minos,\" she said. \"The men cannot eat ship food; they've been conditioned to this planet. We women can go, but we would have to go without our men. We can't go outside without contagion, and we can't spend the rest of our lives in quarantine inside the ship. George Barton is right--there is no problem.\"  \"But we'd be changed!\" Shelia shrilled. \"I don't want to become a Mead! I don't want to be somebody else!\"  She ran to the inner wall of the corridor. There was a brief hesitation, and then, one by one, the women fled to that side, until there were only Bess, June and four others left.  \"See!\" cried Shelia. \"A vote! We can't let the girl in!\"  No one spoke. To change, to be someone else--the idea was strange and horrifying. The men stood uneasily glancing at each other, as if looking into mirrors, and against the wall of the corridor the women watched in fear and huddled together, staring at the men. One man in forty-seven poses. One of them made a beseeching move toward Elsie and she shrank away.  \"No, Jerry! I won't let you change me!\"  Max stirred restlessly, the ironic smile that made his new face his own unconsciously twisting into a grimace of pity. \"We men can't leave, and you women can't stay,\" he said bluntly. \"Why not let Patricia Mead in. Get it over with!\"  June took a small mirror from her belt pouch and studied her own face, aware of Max talking forcefully, the men standing silent, the women pleading. Her face ... her own face with its dark blue eyes, small nose, long mobile lips ... the mind and the body are inseparable; the shape of a face is part of the mind. She put the mirror back.  \"I'd kill myself!\" Shelia was sobbing. \"I'd rather die!\"  \"You won't die,\" Max was saying. \"Can't you see there's only one solution--\"  They were looking at Max. June stepped silently out of the tank room, and then turned and went to the airlock. She opened the valves that would let in Pat Mead's sister."]]]
