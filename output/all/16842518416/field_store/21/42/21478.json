When I heard of a clash of arms on the other side of the river, I jumped on my swiftest steed. See how fast I rode. It shook down all my hair.\" She showed him her black hair streaming almost to her knees. \"When I reached the lines they said you barely escaped death today,\" her voice broke.  \"I suppose I should have been killed if it hadn't been for Amalickiah! Your brother saved my life.\"  \"Dear Amalickiah! You must tell me.\"  As he recited the incidents of the day she drank in his words with her soul in her eyes.  Strange spectacle that, of Zorabel, the charmer. She had recognized Moroni as the coming man and had deliberately set out to fascinate him. But as she entrapped him with her hundred coquetries, she found herself in the toils. The fresh young general had stirred her as no other man ever had and the proud Zorabel was now avowedly the abject slave of love.  In her sweet presence the exigencies of the camp were forgotten, the turmoil of the day faded away, and Moroni felt a calm descend on his spirit.  II.  MORONI RAISES THE STANDARD OF LIBERTY.  Moroni sat in his study bent over a message which read, \"Amalickiah has stirred up an insurrection to gain the kingdom,\" when a young lawyer entered and accosted him. The newcomer had formerly been the general's secretary and an affectionate familiarity existed between them.  \"What is it now?\" asked Moroni pushing his papers aside, for something in the other's air suggested matters of import.  [Illustration: MORONI RAISES THE STANDARD OF LIBERTY.]  \"Only this, sir. I found out by accident that there was a meeting of the judges of the lower court called to which I was not bid. I took means to investigate and found that they have all pledged themselves to support Amalickiah as king on the strength of his empty promises to increase their power.\"  \"I was afraid of this,\" sighed Moroni. His eye traveled to the door whence a young captain entered with angry stride.  The stern young blade was vibrant with vehemence as he saluted and announced, \"There is a defection in the army, sir. The soldiers have been stirred up with tales of civil war. The men, spoiling with inaction, hail the idea of a clash with delight. Already they are taking sides. Amalickiah has won over the rougher element with promises of loot.\"  \"What have you done?\"  \"Put the rebels in irons. But the insurrection is spreading, and I can't imprison the whole army.\"  \"You have done well. Let us hear what Sherum has to say.\" A servant with disheveled hair, his garments almost torn from his back, and his eyes rolling wildly in his head, had rushed in and thrown himself at the feet of the general.  It was a moment before the panting wretch could get his breath. Between gasps he managed to ejaculate, \"The city has gone mad. Howling mobs are blocking the streets. As I returned from the charcoal vender's I ventured to enquire what it was all about. They jeered at me and when I refused to cry, 'Long live King Amalickiah, cuffed me from hand to hand.\"  Moroni knew enough about the management of men to realize that turbulent conditions require desperate remedies. Unless the revolution was stopped Amalickiah would be swept into office on the flood tide of a riot.  His face darkened. \"Was it for this that my people fought the bloody wars with the Lamanites? Resisted the yoke of bondage to become thralls of a Nephite king, because perchance, Amalickiah would have it so?\" he muttered bitterly.  \"Teancum, go back to the barracks. Order the soldiers to prepare to march and the first one who tries to desert make an example of. Let fly an arrow and shoot him in the back.\"  Filled with the valor of his emprize, Teancum saluted his chief in silence and strode out.  \"Sherum, arise, and bid Horeb bring here my full armor. You,\" he continued, turning to the lawyer, \"go tell the town criers to summon the people to a mass meeting at the palace of justice. Say that Moroni would speak with them.\"  Tearing off the white cotton mantle that hung from his shoulders he took it over to the longest spear that rested against the wall. Quickly he lashed the white flag to the pole with thongs of buckskin. Then hastily thrusting his brush into the ink pot that stood near, he wrote on the white banner in bold letters, \"In memory of our God, our religion and freedom, our peace, our wives, and our children.\"  Before he had finished his body servant entered bowed under the weight of his harness. With firm, deft touch he encased his master in the glittering metal. First he adjusted the breast plate, and then fastened the heavy armor that shielded the vital organs. He handed his chief his shield dented with the fray of many battles and lastly crowned him with the great helmet which bore on its crest the winged serpent.  He knew that one man could not quell the insurrection. He felt that he was but a weak instrument. Before he ventured out Moroni bowed himself down and prayed mightily that the Lord would pour down on the people the blessing of liberty.  Filled with the new strength that earnest prayer always imparts, he seized the title of liberty, and walked boldly out into the howling mob in the street.  When the people saw Moroni clad in martial array and read what was on his torn flag, the clamor died on their lips. Many quickly separated themselves from the crowd and followed the general.  When he reached the palace of justice and ascended the stairs to the portico, he found the square below filled with a surging multitude and from all directions others were hurrying. Men who had fought in the wars with Moroni were fastening on their armor as they ran, and women pulled children by the hand.  Moroni stepped forward and grasped the standard of liberty as he cried in a loud voice, \"Behold whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let them come forth in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a covenant that they will maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord God may bless them.\"  At this many of the people rent their garments and trampled them under foot as they cried, \"So may our enemies trample us under foot if we fall into transgression.\"  Moroni reminded them that was what would probably happen. Then he launched into speech while the populace hung spell-bound on every word. The vast concourse stood silent while his utterance rang out. Never had such a eulogy been paid to liberty, never such a tribute to their God. In glowing words he pictured what they had endured for their religion, what they had suffered in the recent wars for their freedom. Scarcely one in that vast multitude but what had sacrificed for both. As the orator ended with the appeal, \"Will you who have so bitterly resented the Lamanitsh yoke bend the knee to a Nephite king?\" an ominous shout arose and he knew that the populace was with him. General Moroni was still the idol of the people and Amalickiah stood impugned.  As the speaker, sucked of his strength, turned to descend, someone plucked at his arm. He recognized the big servant of Zorabel who delivered the message.  \"My mistress would speak with you. She begs that you will come to her.\"  \"Tell your mistress Zorabel that I shall come, but not yet.\"  With that he dismissed the messenger and made his way to the barracks where there was much that demanded the attention of the commander-in-chief for the rest of the afternoon.  It was evening when he at last made his way toward the house of Zorabel. In her apartment the oil already flamed in its brazen cruet. So vast was the room that the light did not penetrate to its further corners, but it served to illumine its magnificence. The walls were carved in grotesque designs brilliantly colored. Prominent among the engravings was the winged serpent of Moroni, and by its side the leopard of Amalickiah. On the floor, over the couches, at the door, were displayed richest blankets of heaviest woof and rainbow hue. Nor were there lacking evidences of the personality of Moroni, for his gifts were placed with loving care. On an alabaster stand lay a book of papyrus filled with picture writing in colored inks, depicting the scenes of the conflicts Moroni had taken part in. Against the wall stood a buckskin shield won from a famous Lamanite chief. Her own divan was graced by the skin of an ocelot that Moroni had brought from one of his foraying expeditions.  Another woman would have paled in such gorgeous surroundings, but Zorabel dominated the whole. In crimson robes, the wealth of her raven hair bound in fillets of gold, she was the throbbing heart of the scene. Her own heart beat unevenly beneath the white bosom which was circled with a necklace of jade. She had placed the bangles there wondering if his man's brain would remember under what circumstances he had given them to her. She had neglected no detail that night that would help in the desperate enterprise on which she was bound.  There was a tread in the corridor and Moroni stood in the doorway. As she looked at him all her reproaches for his tardiness died on her lips and her woman's tenderness gushed forth.  \"You are ill.\"  After the exertions of the day Moroni's features were drawn, his face pallid, and the life had gone out of him. Quickly she went to him and he enveloped her in his arms.  \"Come,\" she said at last, \"you are shaking as if you had the ague. I will give you some wine.\" She poured an amber liquid into a goblet and held it to his lips as he sat down weakly.  \"It has been a terrible day,\" she moaned.  \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"Was that what you wanted to see me about?\"  \"I always want to see you, but I wished to talk to you, about--\" she hesitated, \"Amalickiah.\"  \"I had to oppose him,\" said Moroni wearily.  \"Yes, and defeated him. You won the people over to your side.\"  \"He would be king.\"  \"He is ambitious but he cannot help it.\"  \"But he should learn that he cannot jeopardize the liberty of a nation to gratify his vaulting ambition.\"  \"He"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50958"],["title","Representative Women of Deseret: A Book of Biographical Sketches (#0)"],["body","(MormonTextsProject.org), with thanks to Renah Holmes and Villate Brown McKitrick for proofreading.        REPRESENTATIVE  WOMEN OF DESERET,  A BOOK OF  BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES,  TO ACCOMPANY THE PICTURE BEARING THE SAME TITLE.   COMPILED AND WRITTEN BY  AUGUSTA JOYCE CROCHERON,  _Author of \"WILD FLOWERS OF DESERET;\"_  AND DEDICATED TO  _The originals of this Picture and Book, their co-laborers in the Church, and every true heart that will receive their testimonies._    O, Spirits dear! Ye light the path   That else were lone and dim;   I follow where your sainted feet   Lead onward, up to Him,   And hear above life's discords, still,--   Your heav'n inspired hymn.  SALT LAKE CITY: PRINTED BY J. C. GRAHAM & CO. 1884.    INTRODUCTORY.  In presenting this picture, REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF DESERET, before the public, an explanation may be appropriate that the object may be rightly understood. The picture is intended to represent the Latter Day Saints Women's Organizations rather than to draw attention to those intellectual gifts and acquirements which in this connection are but secondary to the spiritual or missionary labors of those represented. As in Salt Lake City is the head of these organizations, so these spiritual laborers were selected by the precedence they hold.  Throughout our Territory, indeed beyond, are many as sincere and faithful, noble women, well deserving of every honor contained herein, but there is of necessity a limit in the present work and that which would have been a pleasure to the author became an impossibility at this time, but it is the purpose in due season to present another work which will be of interest to our people.  It is not the purpose of the compiler of these sketches to present a complete history of the subjects of the picture, to which this book is merely an accompaniment to acquaint the many who are strangers to them with their labors and their virtues, to show as it were, what manner of people these \"Mormons\" are. To do full justice to the originals would require more space and ability than are mine. But if the eyes of the stranger may thereby be opened to a knowledge of their purity, integrity and faith in God, their heroic firmness and the trials they have endured without wavering in allegiance to their cause; if any may be convinced that this people are in earnest and in the right, and that God is with them; if they can realize that for men, Mormonism is not a cloak, a subterfuge and a selfish system; that our women are not from the dregs of civilization, led and controlled by stronger minds without a knowledge within themselves for their course, it will prove a joy and delight, a sweet return for my humble but earnest efforts. O, that these truthful testimonies falling upon hearts that are as blocks of ice toward us, might, like burning bullets melt their way therein, until, like Joseph's brethren, they should weep for injuries these have borne!  And to the young of our people, if this work shall cause them to appreciate their honored parents more by the nobility they have proven; if it shall cause them to weigh the object for which these sacrifices were endured against the poor temptations of the present time; if they shall question themselves, shall my parent's sacrifices count for naught? shall their example and their labors be lost on me? their hopes meet disappointment? If that command, \"honor thy father and thy mother\" shall prevail, and the sweet testimony of the Holy Spirit convince and strengthen them in the same service and faith unto their God, still sweeter and richer shall be the reward.  That this work may go forth from my humble home as a missionary, a silent worker of great good is my fervent hope.  A. J. C.    PREFACE.  In presenting the picture and book, REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF DESERET, to the public, I desire to first express my thanks to the ladies of the picture for their kindness and confidence.  I thank Sister Eliza R. Snow Smith for her approval and sanction; Sister Emmeline B. Wells for her steadfast encouragement, and Bishop Hiram B. Clawson for his kind interest and advice. Published, as it has been, in part by subscription, I thank also my generous patrons.  Through a disappointment, so many embarrassments occurred that at one time I felt that no inducement, however beautiful, could again tempt me to so great (in my circumstances) an undertaking; but for me the Lord in His goodness opened the way; and towards James R. Miller, Dr. A. Farr and Zina D. H. Young, each, my heart thus expresses itself:    As Hagar in her lone despair   Gazed hopeless o'er the desert drear,   Nor saw until her steps were led,   The living waters, sweet and clear;   So I who strove through tedious days   'Mid hopes that fled and fears that frowned--   Turned at thy name, and in thy heart,   The boon I sought so long was found.    Not hers alone the story old--   The earth is thronged with hearts distressed   That little dream how close beside   The angel walks--to save and bless.  In compiling the brief sketches of Eliza R. Snow Smith, Zina D. H. Young, M. I. Horne and Prescendia L. Kimball, I am indebted to the editor of the _Woman's Exponent_, their biographer. Several autobiographies follow, and looking it all over, the thought rises--_how little I have done after all!_ I have scarcely more than furnished the thread on which their gems were strung. Often I have paused, sorrowful that this work must be so brief: so much remains to be told. I have had sincerest joy in this labor, and if my efforts should be regarded as conferring any honor upon these ladies, it has been a greater honor to me to be accorded the privilege of tendering it, and of enjoying their acquaintance and friendship.  In conclusion, I would again refer to our First Lady, E. R. S. Smith; in a short time will appear her latest and largest book, an autobiography and history with genealogical record of her family, and dedicated to her noble brother, Apostle Lorenzo Snow. On her eightieth birthday, January 21, 1884, Sister Eliza was the recipient of a large surprise party given in honor of the day, in appreciation, love and respect of herself and labors, in the Social Hall, a building of histrionic association in the annals of Salt Lake City. It is wonderful indeed to contemplate the still youthful spirit, energy and ability of this lady; ever serene, gentle, forbearing with others; so carefully hiding her own weariness and leaving unmentioned whatever might trouble her; that the idea would never suggest itself to those not _intimately_ associated with her, that she has anything to do but preside, receive and enjoy the loving expressions from her friends.  Hoping this volume may entertain and benefit the reader, and that all errors in _book-making_ may be graciously pardoned, I will subscribe myself, dear public--Your Servant and Friend, AUGUSTA JOYCE CROCHERON.

Snow was born in Becket, Berkshire Co., Mass. Her parents were Oliver Snow of Mass., and Rosetta L. Pettibone, of Conn. They were of English descent, their parents having emigrated to America at an early period. In 1806, the family removed to Mantua, Portage Co., Ohio.\" Mr. and Mrs. Snow bestowed great care upon the education of their daughter, intellectual and domestic. She began her literary labors when quite young, her contributions over a _nom de plume_ receiving much admiration.  Her grandfather was a revolutionary soldier, and his reminiscences created impressions upon her youthful mind that became part of her nature, developing into an intense national devotion.  \"Two volumes of her 'Religious, Historical, Political' poems have been published, the First in Liverpool, England, in 1856, the Second in Salt Lake City.\" Her poems are life like and embody most of our Church history. To select her best poems would make a volume. The one by which she is best known, perhaps, is, \"O, My Father, thou that dwellest,\" and ranks in its individuality and popularity as a Latter Day Saints' doctrinal hymn, with \"The Spirit of God like a fire is burning.\" It is safe to say that these two hymns have wielded an influence beyond our power to estimate, in conveying the spirit of the Gospel to the hearts of the hearers. I have witnessed throngs of people standing outside a \"Mormon\" place of worship, listening to the singing forgetful for the time of their own personal affairs. They have fixed themselves upon the memory of all who ever heard them. \"O My Father\" contains doctrine that was new to the world, it was the essence of Mormonism. Every Mormon child is familiar with it and would recognize it in any country. It has been sung to many tunes, several have been composed for it. Of these, I once heard Pres. Brigham Young, in the St. George Temple, designate his preference thus: \"Will the Parowan choir please sing 'O My Father,' to that sweet, gentle air I love so well?\" The air was \"Gentle Annie,\" a strange choice it sounded, but the effect proved the correctness of his taste.  \"Sister Eliza early devoted her attention to the Scriptures and in her girlhood formed the acquaintance of the famous preacher and scholar, Alexander Campbell, and other noted divines. In 1835, she went to Kirtland, Ohio, and boarded in the family of the Prophet Joseph, teaching a select school for young ladies. Miss Snow returned home to visit her parents but on the 1st of January, 1837, bade farewell to her paternal home, to share the joys or the "]]]
