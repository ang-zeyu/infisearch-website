Mime sits in front of the anvil, busily hammering     at a sword._  MIME          [_Who has been hammering with a small hammer, stops         working._      Slavery! worry!     Labour all lost!     The strongest sword     That ever I forged,     That the hands of giants     Fitly might wield,     This insolent urchin     For whom it is fashioned Can snap in two at one stroke, As if the thing were a toy!          [_Mime throws the sword on the anvil         ill-humouredly, and with his arms akimbo gazes         thoughtfully on the ground._      There is one sword     That he could not shatter:     Nothung's splinters     Would baffle his strength,     Could I but forge     Those doughty fragments     That all my skill     Cannot weld anew. Could I but forge the weapon, Shame and toil would win their reward!          [_He sinks further back his head bowed in thought._  Fafner, the dragon grim, Dwells in the gloomy wood; With his gruesome and grisly bulk     The Nibelung hoard     Yonder he guards. Siegfried, lusty and young, Would slay him without ado;     The Nibelung's ring     Would then become mine. The only sword for the deed Were Nothung, if it were swung By Siegfried's conquering arm;     And I cannot fashion     Nothung, the sword!          [_He lays the sword in position again, and goes on         hammering in deep dejection._      Slavery! worry!     Labour all lost!     The strongest sword     That ever I forged     Will never serve     For that difficult deed.     I beat and I hammer     Only to humour the boy; He snaps in two what I make, And scolds if I cease from work.          [_He drops his hammer._  SIEGFRIED          [_In rough forester's dress, with a silver horn         hung by a chain, bursts in boisterously from the         wood. He is leading a big bear by a rope of bast,         and urges him towards Mime in wanton fun._      Hoiho! Hoiho!          [_Entering._      Come on! Come on!     Tear him! Tear him!     The silly smith!          [_Mime drops the sword in terror, and takes refuge         behind the forge; while Siegfried, shouting with         laughter, keeps driving the bear after him._  [Illustration: Mime at the anvil. See p. 2]  MIME      Hence with the beast!     I want not the bear!  SIEGFRIED      I come thus paired     The better to pinch thee; Bruin, ask for the sword!  MIME      Hey! Let him go!     There lies the weapon;     It was finished to-day.  SIEGFRIED  Then thou art safe for to-day!          [_He lets the bear loose and strikes him on the         back with the rope._      Off, Bruin!     I need thee no more.          [_The bear runs back into the wood._  MIME [_Comes trembling from behind the forge._      Slay all the bears     Thou canst, and welcome;     But why thus bring the beasts     Home alive?  SIEGFRIED [_Sits down to recover from his laughter._  For better companions seeking Than the one who sits at home, I blew my horn in the wood, Till the forest glades resounded.     What I asked with the note     Was if some good friend My glad companion would be. From the covert came a bear Who listened to me with growls, And I liked him better than thee, Though better friends I shall find.     With a trusty rope     I bridled the beast, To ask thee, rogue, for the weapon.          [_He jumps up and goes towards the anvil._  MIME          [_Takes up the sword to hand it to Siegfried._  I made the sword keen-edged; In its sharpness thou wilt rejoice.          [_He holds the sword anxiously in his hand;         Siegfried snatches it from him._  What matters an edge keen sharpened, Unless hard and true the steel?          [_Testing the sword._      Hei! What an idle,     Foolish toy!     Wouldst have this pin     Pass for a sword?          [_He strikes it on the anvil, so that the splinters         fly about. Mime shrinks back in terror._      There, take back the pieces,     Pitiful bungler!     'Tis on thy skull     It should have been broken!     Shall such a braggart     Still go on boasting,     Telling of giants     And prowess in battle,     Of deeds of valour,     And dauntless defence?--     A sword true and trusty     Try to forge me,     Praising the skill     He does not possess?     When I take hold     Of what he has hammered,     The rubbish crumbles     At a mere touch!     Were not the wretch     Too mean for my wrath,     I would break him in bits     As well as his work-- The doting fool of a gnome!-- And end the annoyance at once!          [_Siegfried throws himself on to a stone seat in a         rage. Mime all the time has been cautiously keeping         out of his way._  MIME      Again thou ravest like mad,     Ungrateful and perverse.     If what for him I forge     Is not perfect on the spot,     Too soon the boy forgets     The good things I have made!     Wilt never learn the lesson     Of gratitude, I wonder?     Thou shouldst be glad to obey him     Who always treated thee well.          [_Siegfried turns his back on Mime in a bad temper,         and sits with his face to the wall._  Thou dost not like to be told that!          [_He stands perplexed, then goes to the hearth in         the kitchen._  But thou wouldst fain be fed. Wilt eat the meat I have roasted, Or wouldst thou prefer the broth? 'Twas boiled solely for thee.          [_He brings food to Siegfried, who, without turning         round, knocks both bowl and meat out of his hand._  SIEGFRIED  Meat I roast for myself; Sup thy filthy broth alone!  MIME [_In a wailing voice, as if hurt._      This is the reward     Of all my love!     All my care     Is paid for with scorn.     When thou wert a babe     I was thy nurse,     Made the mite clothing     To keep him warm,     Brought thee thy food,     Gave thee to drink,     Kept thee as safe     As I keep my skin;     And when thou wert grown     I waited on thee,     And made a bed     For thy slumber soft.     I fashioned thee toys     And a sounding horn,     Grudging no pains,     Wert thou but pleased.     With counsel wise     I guided thee well,     With mellow wisdom     Training thy mind.     Sitting at home,     I toil and moil;     To heart's desire     Wander thy feet.     Through thee alone worried,     And working for thee,     I wear myself out,     A poor old dwarf!          [_Sobbing._      And for my trouble     The sole reward is     By a hot-tempered boy          [_Sobbing._      To be hated and plagued!  [Illustration: Mime and the infant Siegfried See p. 8]   SIEGFRIED          [_Has turned round again and has quietly watched         Mime's face, while the latter, meeting the look,         tries timidly to hide his own._  Thou hast taught me much, Mime, And many things I have learned; But what thou most gladly hadst taught me A lesson too hard has proved-- How to endure thy sight.     When with my food     Or drink thou dost come, I sup off loathing alone;     When thou dost softly     Make me a bed, My sleep is broken and bad;     When thou wouldst teach me     How to be wise, Fain were I deaf and dumb.     If my eyes happen     To fall on thee,     I find all thou doest     Amiss and ill-done;     When thou dost stand,     Waddle and walk,     Shamble and shuffle,     With thine eyelids blinking,     By the neck I want     To take the nodder,     And choke the life     From the hateful twitcher. So much, O Mime, I love thee!     Hast thou such wisdom,     Explain, I pray thee, A thing I have wondered at:     Though I go roaming     Just to avoid thee, Why do I always return?     Though I love the beasts     All better than thee--     Tree and bird     And the fish in the brook,     One and all     They are dearer than thou-- How is it I always"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],["title","Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#1)"],["body","turn? Of thy wisdom tell me that.  MIME          [_Tries to approach him affectionately._  My child, that ought to show thee That Mime is dear to thy heart.  SIEGFRIED  I said I could not bear thee; Forget not that so soon.  MIME          [_Recoils, and sits down again apart, opposite         Siegfried._]  The wildness that thou shouldst tame Is the cause, bad boy, of that. Young ones are always longing After their parents' nest; What we love we all long for, And so thou dost yearn for me; 'Tis plain thou lovest thy Mime,     And always must love him. What the old bird is to the young one, Feeding it in its nest Ere the fledgling can flutter, That is what careful, clever Mime To thy young life is,     And always must be.  SIEGFRIED  Well, Mime, being so clever, This one thing more also tell me:          [_Simply._      The birds sang together     So gaily in spring,  [Illustration: \"And there I learned                 What love was like\"                            See p. 11]          [_Tenderly._  The one alluring the other;     And thou didst say,     When I asked thee why, That they were wives with their husbands.      They chattered so sweetly,     Were never apart;     They builded a nest     In which they might brood;     The fluttering young ones     Came flying out, And both took care of the young.     The roes in the woods, too,     Rested in pairs, The wild wolves even, and foxes.     Food was found them and brought     By the father, The mother suckled the young ones.     And there I learned     What love was like;     A whelp from its mother     I never took.     But where hast thou, Mime,     A wife dear and loving, That I may call her mother?  MIME [_Angrily._      What dost thou mean?     Fool, thou art mad! Art thou then a bird or a fox?  SIEGFRIED      When I was a babe     Thou wert my nurse,     Made the mite clothing     To keep him warm;     But tell me, whence     Did the tiny mite come?     Could babe without mother     Be born to thee?  MIME [_Greatly embarrassed._      Thou must always     Trust what I tell thee.     I am thy father     And mother in one.  SIEGFRIED  Thou liest, filthy old fright! The resemblance 'twixt child and parent I often have seen for myself. I came to the limpid brook,     And the beasts and the trees     I saw reflected;     Sun and clouds too,     Just as they are, Were mirrored quite plain in the stream.     I also could spy     This face of mine,     And quite unlike thine     Seemed it to me;     As little alike     As a fish to a toad: And when had fish toad for its father?  MIME [_Very angrily._  How canst thou talk Such terrible stuff?  SIEGFRIED [_With increasing animation._      Listen! At last     I understand What in vain I pondered so long: Why I roam the woods And run to escape thee, Yet return home in the end.          [_He springs up._  I cannot go till thou tell me What father and mother were mine.  MIME  What father? What mother? Meaningless questions!  SIEGFRIED          [_Springs upon Mime, and seizes him by the throat._      To answer a question     Thou must be caught first;     Willingly     Thou never wilt speak;     Thou givest nothing     Unless forced to.     How to talk     I hardly had learned     Had it not by force     Been wrung from the wretch.     Come, out with it,     Mangy old scamp! Who are my father and mother?  [Illustration: Siegfried sees himself in the stream. See p. 12.]  MIME          [_After makings signs with his head and hands, is         released by Siegfried._  Dost want to kill me outright! Hands off, and the facts thou shalt hear, As far as known to myself.     O ungrateful     And graceless child, Now learn the cause of thy hatred!     Neither thy father     Nor kinsman I, And yet thou dost owe me thy life!     To me, thy one friend,     A stranger wert thou;     It was pity alone     Sheltered thee here; And this is all my reward. And I hoped for thanks like a fool!  A woman once I found Who wept in the forest wild; I helped her here to the cave, That by the fire I might warm her. The woman bore a child here; Sadly she gave it birth. She writhed about in pain; I helped her as I could. Bitter her plight; she died. But Siegfried lived and throve.  SIEGFRIED [_Slowly._  My poor mother died, then, through me?  MIME  To my care she commended thee; 'Twas willingly bestowed. The trouble Mime would take! The worry kind Mime endured!     \"When thou wert a babe     I was thy nurse....\"  SIEGFRIED  That story I often have heard. Now say, whence came the name       Siegfried?  MIME      'Twas thus that thy mother     Told me to name thee,     That thou mightst grow     To be strong and fair.     \"I made the mite clothing     To keep it warm....\"  SIEGFRIED  Now tell me, what name was my mother's?  MIME  In truth I hardly know.     \"Brought thee thy food,     Gave thee to drink....\"  SIEGFRIED  My mother's name thou must tell me.  MIME  Her name I forget. Yet wait! Sieglinde, that was the name borne By her who gave thee to me.     \"I kept thee as safe     As I keep my skin....\"  SIEGFRIED          [_With increasing urgency._  Next tell me, who was my father?  MIME [_Roughly._  Him I have never seen.  [Illustration: Mime finds the mother of Siegfried in the forest. See p. 13]  SIEGFRIED  But my mother told it thee, surely.  MIME      He fell in combat     Was all that she said.     She left the fatherless     Babe to my care.     \"And when thou wert grown     I waited on thee,     And made a bed     For thy slumber soft\"...  SIEGFRIED      Still, with thy tiresome     Starling song! That I may trust thy story, Convinced thou art not lying, Thou must produce some proof.  MIME  But what proof will convince thee?  SIEGFRIED  I trust thee not with my ears, I trust thee but with mine eyes: What witness speaks for thee?  MIME          [_After some thought takes from the place where         they are concealed the two pieces of a broken sword._  I got this from thy mother: For trouble, food, and service This was my sole reward. Behold, 'tis a splintered sword! She said 'twas borne by thy father In the fatal fight when he fell.  SIEGFRIED [_Enthusiastically._      And thou shalt forge     These fragments together, And furnish my rightful sword!     Up! Tarry not, Mime;     Quick to thy task!     If thou hast skill,     Thy cunning display.     Cheat me no more     With worthless trash;     These fragments alone     Henceforth I trust.     Lounge o'er thy work,     Weld it not true,     Trickily patching     The goodly steel, And thou shalt learn on thy limbs How metal best should be beat!     I swear that this day     The sword shall be mine; My weapon to-day I shall win!  MIME [_Alarmed._  What wouldst thou to-day with the sword?  SIEGFRIED      Leave the forest     For the wide world, Never more to return.     Ah, how fair     A thing is freedom! Nothing holds me or binds! No father have I here, And afar shall be my home; Thy hearth is not my house, Nor my covering thy roof.     Like the fish     Glad in the water,     Like the finch     Free in the heavens,     Off I will float,     Forth I will fly,     Like the wind o'er the wood     Wafted away, Thee, Mime, beholding no more!          [_He runs into the forest._  MIME [_Greatly alarmed._      Stop, boy! Stop, boy!     Whither away?     Hey! Siegfried!     Siegfried! Hey!          [_He looks after the retreating figure for some         time in astonishment; then he goes back to the         smithy and sits down behind the anvil._      He storms away!     And I sit here:     To crown my cares     Comes still this new one;     My plight is piteous indeed!     How help myself now?     How hold the boy here?     How lead the young madcap     To Fafner's lair?     And how weld the splinters     Of obstinate steel?     In no furnace fire     Can they be melted,     Nor can Mime's hammer     Cope with their hardness.          [_Shrilly._      The Nibelung's hate,     Need and sweat Cannot make Nothung whole, Never will weld it anew.          [_Sobbing, he sinks in despair on to a stool behind         the anvil._  WANDERER (WOTAN)          [_Enters from the wood by the door at the back of         the cave. He wears a long dark blue cloak, and, for         staff, carries a spear. On his head is a round,         broad-brimmed slouched hat._  All hail, cunning smith! A seat by thy hearth     Kindly grant     The wayworn guest.  MIME [_Starting up in alarm._      Who seeks for me here     In desolate woods, Finds my home in the forest wild?  WANDERER [_Approaching very slowly step by step._  Wanderer names me the world, smith. From far I have come;     On the earth's back ranging,     Much I have roamed.  MIME      If Wanderer named,     Pray wander from here Without halting for rest.  WANDERER  Good men grudge me not welcome; Many gifts I have received.     By bad hearts only     Is evil feared.  MIME      Ill fate always     Dwelt by my side; Thou wouldst not add to it, surely!  WANDERER [_Slowly coming nearer and nearer._      Always searching,     Much have I seen;     Things of weight     Have told to many;     Oft have rid men     Of their troubles, Gnawing and carking cares.  MIME      Though thou hast searched,     And though much thou hast found, I need neither seeker nor finder.     Lonely am I,     And lone would be; Idlers I harbour not here.  WANDERER [_Again coming a little nearer._      There were many     Thought they were wise,     Yet what they needed     Knew not at all;     Useful lore was     Theirs for the asking, Wisdom was their reward.  MIME          [_More and more anxious as he sees the Wanderer         approach._      Idle knowledge     Some may covet; I know enough for my needs.          [_The Wanderer reaches the hearth._      My own wits suffice,     I want no more, So, wise one, keep on thy way.  WANDERER [_Sitting down at the hearth._      Nay, here at thy hearth     I vow by my head To answer all thou shalt ask.     My head is thine,     'Tis forfeit to"]]]
