Designed for the Instruction and Encouragement of Young Latter-day Saints.   JUVENILE INSTRUCTOR OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Utah. 1887.    PREFACE.  It affords us much pleasure to be able to present to the public the Thirteenth Book of the FAITH-PROMOTING SERIES. The favor shown these little publications by both old and young among the Latter-day Saints encourages us in the belief that they are read with interest, and, we trust, with profit. The principal object in issuing them has been and is to increase faith in the hearts of those who peruse them, by showing how miraculously God has overruled everything for the benefit of those who try to serve Him.  If, by our efforts, faith can be implanted or increased in the hearts of any we will certainly feel that our labors have not been in vain.  We trust this little work will find its way into many homes and afford pleasure and instruction to all who read it.  THE PUBLISHERS.    CONTENTS.  LEAVING HOME.  CHAPTER I.

By Robert Aveson.  CHAPTER I.  BIRTH-PLACE--PARENTAGE--WILLIAM H. SCOTT--AN INTERVIEW WITH A BAPTIST MINISTER--A TESTIMONY TO THE TRUTH OF \"MORMONISM.\"  The writer, the second son of Thomas and Ann Aveson, was born in the town of Bradford, Yorkshire, England, on August 22nd, 1847.  My father was an honest, hard-working man; he was not a believer in any particular religion. My mother was more religiously inclined; her maiden name was Fawcett. Both my father and mother were strict in training their family, which consisted of nine children (seven sons and two daughters), five of whom are now dead.  In the early part of 1860 we removed from Bradford to Malton, in Yorkshire, staying there only about six weeks, and then went to reside at Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, a very pretty town at that time. We arrived there February 29th, 1860.  On the 11th of February, 1862, I was engaged to work at Mr Joseph Gould's printing office in Middlesbrough. My wages were three shillings per week. Mr. Gould was a printer himself and did most of the work. He had only one other employee working for him, and that was a boy named Richard Sedgwick, through whom I procured my situation, and whose acquaintance I had made a few months previously.  On the 5th of the following May I was bound apprentice to Mr. Gould. After I signed the indenture, Mr. Brown, one of the witnesses to it, said to me:  \"There, my boy, you have tied a knot with your hand which you can't unloose with your tongue.\"  The indenture stated that my wages should be three shillings and sixpence per week the first year, with a yearly raise of one shilling per week until I had served my time, which was seven years.  About a week after this, a young man, named William Henry Scott, was engaged to work for Mr. Gould, and shortly afterwards was bound apprentice to him for three years. Mr. Scott was from Seaham Harbor, county of Durham, where his parents and their family resided.  The following August, Richard Sedgwick left Mr. Gould's employ and went to work for a Mr. Thomas Carter, picture-frame maker, and was afterwards bound apprentice to him.  William H. Scott was a fine, courteous young man, to whom I became very much attached. He had resided in Middlesbrough only a short time when his brother John wrote to him from Seaham Harbor, stating that his mother and himself had become members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and earnestly desired William to investigate the principles and doctrines of that Church. He told his brother to go to a man named Anderson, who was a Latter-day Saint and a resident of Middlesbrough.  Notwithstanding William had recently become identified with the Methodists, he went, according to request, and had an interview with Brother Anderson regarding this new religion; and becoming convinced of the truth of \"Mormonism,\" was baptized a member of the Church.  Brother W. H. Scott became a useful member of what was then known as the Middlesbrough and Stockton branch. We often conversed together on the first principles of the latter-day gospel.  At this time (the Summer of 1862) I was feeling more religiously inclined than I had ever before. One reason for this, probably, was because a religious revival was in progress. The Wesleyans, Primitive Methodists and other religious sects were very energetic and obtained many converts.  About a year and a half previously my mother had become a member of the Wesleyan Reformers, and I had told her that I did not think it would be long before I should join one of the religious sects.  I was a regular attendant at a Baptist chapel and Sunday school, and firmly believed that the principles and doctrines promulgated by the Baptists were nearer like those the Savior taught than were set forth by any other religious denomination I was acquainted with, and my mind was fully made up to identify myself with that body.  One Summer evening in 1862, I attended a Baptist prayer meeting with the firm intention of becoming converted to their faith and afterwards applying for baptism. I was under the impression that they made converts in the same way the Methodists did, but found I was mistaken.  At the close of the meeting I spoke to one of the members, and asked him why they did not make converts at their prayer meetings. He said that was not their mode of receiving members; he told me that when he joined the Baptists he prayed to his Heavenly Father for the forgiveness of his sins, and after doing so he felt an inward feeling of happiness, which proved to him that his sins were forgiven; he said after informing his minister to that effect he was baptized. The young man asked me to see the minister. I did as he wished me, and the minister appointed the following Saturday evening for an interview with him.  According to promise, I went to his house at the appointed time and was invited into the parlor. The minister's name was William Bontems. He appeared to me to be a very good man. We were alone in the parlor and conversed together for quite a while. He told me I must pray to the Lord and get forgiveness of my sins, and then I could receive baptism. Another appointment was made for me to see him in one week from that day.  I went home, thinking seriously over the matter. That night I retired to rest a little earlier than usual. As soon as I entered my bed-room I prayed most fervently and humbly to my Heavenly Father, asking"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49401"],["title","Eventful Narratives (#1)"],["body"," to forgive my sins and to produce that happy feeling within my bosom which others realized before receiving baptism. I spent about fifteen minutes, at least, in prayer but experienced no happy feeling whatever.  Next evening I again engaged in secret prayer, but realized no benefit. I tried this for a week, with no marked effect. At the end of the week I again went to the minister: told him I had prayed every night, but found no relief; and asked him if he could not pray for me. He replied:  \"If all the ministers in the world were to pray for you they could not save you.\"  After further conversation he requested me to continue my prayers, believing the Lord would answer. I did as he told me several nights more, but without success.  As soon as William H. Scott was identified with the Latter-day Saints he became a zealous and energetic member, and was desirous that all those whom he was acquainted with should embrace the gospel. Working together in the same establishment--in the same room--we had a good opportunity to converse upon any topic that presented itself. I told William concerning my interviews with the Baptist minister, and that I had been praying nightly to the Lord to obtain forgiveness of my sins, but, seemingly, without effect.  William listened attentively and eagerly to my story. He had wished, hoped and even prayed that I should be convinced of the latter day gospel. But I told him I could not see clearly into the principles taught by the Latter-day Saints.  One evening shortly after this (the early part of August, I think) feeling as if my continued prayers for a newness of heart were in vain, I made up my mind to try once more, and if I experienced no difference, would give up the idea of becoming identified with the Baptists and would try the \"Mormons.\"  That same morning while at work, William conversed with me again on the principles advocated by the Latter-day Saints, and smilingly said:  \"You'll have to join the `Mormons.'\"  While conversing with him I experienced a heavenly feeling; a mist came over me, I felt within me an influence I had never before realized. The principles and doctrines of the latter-day gospel came clearly before me. The Spirit of the Lord was with me, and I received a testimony of the truth of \"Mormonism\"--a testimony which I shall never forget. I was supremely happy, rejoicing with \"joy unspeakable.\" I told William I was ready for baptism and asked him to introduce me to the Saints the next Sunday.    CHAPTER II.  THE FIRST LATTER-DAY SAINT MEETING--WILLIAM H. SCOTT HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH MY MOTHER--SHE FORBIDS ME HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE \"MORMONS.\"  It was on the Sunday following when I attended the first Latter-day Saint meeting, having received permission to do so from my parents. That morning I went as usual to the Baptist Sunday school, but did not enjoy myself as much as heretofore. This I attributed to my lack of faith in their doctrines. Knowing \"Mormonism\" to be true, I could gain no satisfaction from any other source.  The place where the Latter-day Saint meeting was to be held was at a small village called Eston, about four miles from Middlesbrough. Our company left town for that place about 1 o'clock p.m., and consisted of William Littlefair, president of the Middlesbrough and Stockton branch, Thomas Watson, secretary of the branch, William H. Scott and myself. It was one of the happiest afternoons I ever spent. We were soon out of town, tripping along through lovely green fields bedecked with flowers of various kinds. Being very much interested in the conversation of President Littlefair and the other brethren--of course it was mostly pertaining to the gospel--the time passed away quickly and we soon arrived at Eston, where the meeting was to be held at the house of a sister named Fewster.  The meeting was opened with an appropriate hymn, then prayer by one of the brethren. The sacrament was administered, and the hymn commencing,       \"O, God, the Eternal Father,       Who dwells amid the sky,\"  was sung.  The time was mostly occupied by President Littlefair. As this was the first meeting attended by me and the first time I had heard the gospel preached I listened attentively to the words of the speakers.  After meeting we partook of tea with Sister Fewster, during which we enjoyed a pleasant, sociable chat. Then we returned homeward, arriving in Middlesbrough about 6 o'clock in the evening.  While penning this brief narrative I cannot help reflecting upon the present time. Passing along to my Sunday meetings I often see a number of boys, about my age at that time, and some older ones, loitering about the streets, breaking the Sabbath, neglecting to attend worship, and many who never even visit Sunday school. They have not the love for their religion, which filled my heart at their age. These remarks apply not only to the young, but also to others more advanced in years, who often neglect their meetings, excusing themselves on one frivolous pretext or another.  William H. Scott told President Littlefair that I desired baptism. The president said as I was under age that rite could not be administered to me. It was necessary for me to first obtain permission from my parents. Thinking the best way to get their consent would be for William to talk to my mother on the subject of \"Mormonism,\" I arranged an interview with her. Accordingly, William went and conversed with her on the first principles of the gospel. It was on a Thursday night. She was interested and listened attentively to the teachings of the young preacher, for he was but a young man, seventeen years of age. At the close of the interview it was agreed upon that in a week's time he should pay her another visit. The appointment was promptly kept, and at its close William gained my mother's consent to my baptism. The next night, Friday, my father, on being consulted, said he was willing for me to do as I pleased.  As everything seemed to be working in my favor, I sought my mother's consent, before retiring to rest on Saturday night, to attend another meeting of the Saints, which was to be held in the afternoon of the next day. Judge of my surprise on being told by her that she did not wish me to have anything more to do with so deluded a people, giving them a bad name and saying:  \"I would rather bury you in the churchyard than have you join the Mormons.\"  Too full of grief to make any reply to her remarks, with drooping head and aching heart I slowly went up stairs to my bed chamber and there knelt and prayed humbly and fervently to my Heavenly Father, while the tears rolled down my cheeks.  Restlessly I lay upon my bed. \"I would rather bury you in the churchyard than have you join the Mormons.\" Oh, how these words rang in my ears! I had never been so tried before in my life. The knowledge that \"Mormonism\" was true was firm in my heart, for I had received a testimony and was very anxious to get baptized; but my hopes now were blighted. What course should I pursue? I was young--just approaching my fifteenth birthday--and still under the control of my parents, whom I desired to obey in all things. But could I give up \"Mormonism\" and deny the testimony I had received? No, the Lord helping me, I would never do that.  Then, again, my temporal position weighed upon my heart. I had recently been apprenticed in the printing business for seven years; and the laws of the country compelled me to serve out this time.  And thus query after query arose in my mind for some length of time, until at last, tired out, sleep closed my eyelids.  Instead of going to Sunday school on the following morning I went to see W. H. Scott and related to him what had transpired. He sympathized with me in my troubled state, advice to me was:  It afterwards came to my knowledge that my mother had been making inquiries of her minister and members of the Wesleyan Reformers in regard to what kind of people the \"Mormons\" were and what was their belief; and the false statements she received in reply accounted for the unkind answer she gave me.  I went to the Latter day Saints' meeting whenever opportunity offered, but was very cautious not to inform my parents.  Sometimes I attended meetings at Eston and Stockton (both places being about four miles from home) as well as at Middlesbrough.  I soon left my former Sunday school and began attending another of the same persuasion, but differing on some points of doctrine. Then I attended the Unitarian school, where their exercises partook of a secular as well as of a religious nature. From there I went to the Wesleyans; but wherever I roamed no true spiritual enjoyment could be found as at the meetings of the Latter-day Saints.    CHAPTER III.  A COMPANION--HOW I SAVED MY EMIGRATION MONEY--AN IMPORTANT LETTER FROM AMERICA.  My acquaintance with the Sedgwick family, which had been interrupted as related in a previous chapter, was again renewed in the Summer of 1863. From that time the friendship existing between Richard, and myself was of the most intimate character. It was not long before the subject of \"Mormonism\" was broached to Richard, and he was soon convinced of the truth of the latter-day gospel. Being also under age he was placed in the same condition as myself--neither of us could avail ourselves of the ordinance of baptism.  Like the rest of the Saints, after embracing the gospel, the spirit of gathering came strongly upon us, and we felt desirous of emigrating at some future day to the land of Zion. In order to do this, it became necessary for Richard and myself to obtain means for that purpose.  About the latter part of 1862, my employer, Mr. Joseph Gould, purchased a weekly newspaper, called the _Middlesbrough News_. It was printed on Thursday nights, and necessitated my working most of that night every week. The money obtained by overwork enabled me to make deposits in the Perpetual Emigration Fund, the first instalment being eleven shillings. This was on December"]]]
