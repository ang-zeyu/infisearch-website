You are the Mr. Kai of the Chinese Embassy here, are you not?\"  \"You are absolutely correct,\" the other smiled, and signalled to the waiter to transfer his meal to their table. \"Quite correct and, indeed, kind. We of China do not like to take our meals alone. And it is the same when we are in foreign lands, too. So I must thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generous hospitality.\"  \"Well, to be truthful, sir,\" Dawson chuckled, \"the pleasure really is all ours. You'd be surprised how sick Freddy and I get of hearing each other sound off.\"  \"Eh?\" the English youth grunted, and shot Dave a hostile look. \"Sound off, you say?\"  Soo Wong Kai laughed softly and leaned toward Freddy.  \"The American way of saying, throwing the bull, Captain Farmer,\" he said. \"Or, as you English would have it, swinging the gate. In China we have an expression which, when translated, means, counting the locusts. There are billions and billions of locusts in China, you see. So to say that one is counting the locusts is to mean that one is simply talking to hear oneself. Or sounding off. Or throwing the bull. Or swinging the gate. You see?\"  \"I've got a hunch you've kind of been around here and there, eh, Mr. Kai?\" Dave grinned at him. \"And--oh, my gosh! Pardon me, sir!\"  The Chinese looked at Dave and raised his thin brows in innocent puzzlement.  \"For what, may I ask, Captain Dawson?\" he said. \"For what reason should you exclaim and ask my pardon? I fear I do not quite understand.\"  Dawson swallowed, and licked his lower lip quickly.  \"I suddenly remembered seeing your picture in the London _Times_, and reading about you, sir,\" Dave presently said. \"You're Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's new Minister of War, aren't you? And the head of the Military Mission that recently arrived in England?\"  \"That's true.\" The Chinese nodded and smiled. \"But I still fail to see why you must beg my pardon.\"  \"Well, for being sort of flip with my talk, sir,\" Dave said. \"You're a high government official, and--well, after all--\"  \"After all, are we not both men, Captain?\" the other interrupted quietly. \"And are we not fighting the same foe, each in his own way? Believe me, Captain, it is I who look up to you, because of the great and fine things you have accomplished in the name of liberty and world happiness. You, and your true friend, here. And millions of other brave soldiers, too. Yes, I am a high government official, as you say, but the higher a man gets the more he respects and admires those who do the fighting, and shed the blood. They are the ones who are winning this war, not we aged ones who are serving our respective countries in some official capacity. _Youth_ will win this struggle, Captain. And youth will win the peace, too. But--\"  Soo Wong Kai paused. His face remained grave, but as he leaned slightly toward Dawson there was a merry twinkle in his eyes.  \"But what do you say we skip it, eh?\" he chuckled. \"Out the window with who's who, and why. Until we must part, let's just be three guys named Joe, huh?\"  Both Dave and Freddy gulped hard, and then burst out laughing.  \"Fair enough, it's a deal!\" Dawson cried. \"But I repeat what I said just now. You've sure been around, Mr. Kai. But plenty!\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Clocks Won't Wait_   For the next hour the English air ace, the Yank air ace, and the new Chinese Minister of War would hardly have noticed a German Luftwaffe bomb coming down through the dining-room ceiling. None came down, of course, because the good old R.A.F. patroled the night skies outside, and German night fliers had long since realized that the R.A.F. boys could beat them to the punch any day in the week, and twice on Sundays. Under pressure from the Chinese official, Freddy and Dave recounted some of the experiences they'd had during the war. And under polite pressure from them, Soo Wong Kai told them many interesting stories of China.  \"That's one country I sure want to visit before I die,\" Dave said after a short silence. \"It must be very wonderful in China. I've read quite a bit about it, but I guess if you piled all the books about China one on top of the other you wouldn't even begin to scratch the surface, eh? If you get what I mean, sir?\"  \"Yes, I do, Captain,\" the other replied. \"And I'm afraid you're quite right. There has been a great deal written about China, but it would take ten times as much to tell the story of the real China--the China of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his people.\"  \"There's a soldier!\" Freddy Farmer spoke up with a vigorous nod. \"What a splendid leader, and what splendid troops he now commands. I quite agree with Dave, sir. I, too, hope to visit China some day.\"  \"And may that day come soon,\" Soo Wong Kai said gravely. \"Soon, because of the things you will see in China. And soon, because of the honor such a visit would be to my country. China has come a long way, and she still has a long, long road to travel. But we shall travel that road, and we shall attain the goal at the end of that road. But there I go sounding off, when I can easily see that you two gentlemen are doing me the great honor of being polite. So--\"  \"No, you're wrong, sir!\" Dawson spoke up quickly. \"I'm enjoying every second of this talk. And I know Freddy is, too. Believe me, sir, and this is the truth: If I'm given the chance--which you can bet on that I won't be--of picking the next front to fight on, I'll pick China right off the bat.\"  \"Hear, hear!\" Freddy Farmer added his bit quickly. \"Quite, sir. We were almost there, when we were in Burma just before the States came into the war. However, as Dawson says, if we have our choice next time, it will most certainly be China.\"[1]  [Footnote 1: _Dave Dawson at Singapore._]  \"And a happy day that will be for my struggling countrymen,\" Soo Wong Kai said softly. \"We have there, now, the Flying Tigers. True and brave airmen they are. And China will never be able to repay her debt to those gallant boys. What they have done for China is something no nation and no people could ever hope to repay in full. And to have you two fight on the China front would be much the same thing. Do not look at me so, for it is the truth when I say that I have heard your names, and your deeds, mentioned deep in my country. So, should your orders ever carry you to China, all that China has to offer is yours for the asking. And--Ah! But the truth embarrasses you, eh?\"  Dawson grinned, and wished that some of the redness would go out of his face. He liked praise just as much as the next fellow, but Soo Wong Kai was sure hitting on all sixteen cylinders.  \"Well, there's a couple of other fellows or so fighting in this war, too, sir,\" he said with a little laugh. \"But thanks just the same, sir.\"  \"And thank you, Captains, for a most pleasant meeting,\" the Minister of War said as he rose to his feet. \"I shall always remember this happy event. And it will be my perpetual wish that some day we will meet again in my country. Again, thank you. And I bid you a heartfelt good evening, Captains.\"  Both Dawson and Freddy leaped to their feet, stammered out their thanks, shook hands with the Chinese, and remained at attention as he walked away and out of the dining-room.  \"Well, quite an event, what?\" the English youth breathed after they had reseated themselves. \"Quite a splendid chap, eh? A very decent sort.\"  \"Tops, and how!\" Dave grunted, and pointed at their empty plates. \"Go on and say it, pal. I can read it in your eyes.\"  \"Say what?\" Freddy demanded. \"And just what can you read in my eyes, I'd like to know?\"  \"What you're thinking, and wishing,\" Dave said with a straight face. \"That he'd brought along one of his official buddies.\"  \"You still aren't making sense!\" Freddy snapped. \"Speak up! Get it off your blasted chest, whatever it is.\"  \"As if you didn't know!\" Dawson snorted. \"If he'd brought along one of his official buddies, why then there would have been more meat ration coupons, of course. And you could have worked them for a second helping of roast beef. Don't try to kid a pal, pal! You were kind of thinking that, weren't you?\"  \"No, my little man,\" Freddy replied softly, and slowly reached for a dish of pudding he hadn't touched yet. \"But would you care to have me _show_ you what I'm thinking _now_?\"  \"Do, sweetheart!\" Dave growled, and reached for his own pudding. \"And you'll be combing pudding out of your hair, too. So--Sweet tripe, Freddy! Let's dive in and finish this. We're due out at Croydon Airport in a little over an hour. And we haven't packed, or paid the bill yet. And you can bet your sweet life that that Newfoundland-bound bomber isn't going to wait for us.\"  \"Right as rain!\" Freddy echoed behind a heaping spoon of pudding. \"Darned decent of the Air Ministry to give us a ride by air, instead of having us make the crossing by water. A magic world, isn't it, Dave! By this time tomorrow night we'll be dining in New York City. Magic isn't the word.\"  \"No, it's speed!\" Dawson snapped. \"Can the chatter, pal, and just shovel it in. And I'll match you for the check.\"  \"No, Dave, I'll pay it.\"  \"What?\" Dawson gasped. \"Am I hearing things?\"  \"I said that I would pay the check,\" Freddy replied. \"No! Not because I am big-hearted, either. Simply to save the trouble of tossing coins with you--and losing _as usual_.\"  \"Oh, well, don't feel too bad, pal,\" Dave grinned at him. \"You'll catch on to how it's done, some day. Then you can make up for lost time. However, just to prove that I'm a nice guy, I'll pay the check myself.\"  That last caused Freddy Farmer to go speechless. And he remained speechless while Dawson took the check from the waiter and paid it in full, plus tip.  \"Wonderful!\" the English youth breathed softly. \"I have just witnessed the miracle of miracles, and I don'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50259"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Flying Tigers (#2)"],["body","believe I have the strength to get out to Croydon Airport.\"  \"Oh, Big-Hearted Dawson, they call me,\" Dave grinned. \"Besides, I feel pretty swell right now. And who wouldn't when he was about to head back to the good old U.S.A.! Well, let's go, youngster. That bomber won't wait.\"  A few minutes over an hour later the two youths climbed out of the taxi in front of the Croydon Airport Administration Building, parked their suitcases outside and went inside to report to Group Captain Bainsworth, R.A.F. Commandant of the field. The senior officer smiled, and nodded as they came to attention and saluted.  \"Knew you chaps would be along presently,\" he said. \"Squadron Leader Hixon, your pilot, was in here a moment ago fretting that you wouldn't show up in time. I assured him that chaps going on leave are never late. You've proved that truth again. Well, Dawson, I fancy you're a bit bucked up to be going back to the States, what?\"  \"Right on top of the world, sir,\" the Yank air ace informed him. \"Not that I don't like England, you understand, sir, but--\"  \"Quite,\" the senior officer broke in with a smile. \"Any chap wants to see his native land. And you, Farmer? Glad to be going along?\"  Freddy half shrugged, and let a little sigh slide off his lips.  \"It's quite wonderful out in the States, sir,\" he said. \"But--well, I try to be a good soldier and go where I have to. And this time, it happens to be the States. Of course, I could do with a bit more interesting company, but--\"  The English youth shrugged again and made a little gesture with his hands. The group captain chuckled, and Dave shot Freddy a you-wait-until-we're-outside look. Then he grinned broadly.  \"Well,\" the group captain presently said, \"I guess the aircraft is about ready. I'll go along out to it with you. Good luck, both of you. And--well, have a marvelous time. Yes, quite! Be sure and have a marvelous time. And the very best of luck.\"  The way the senior officer seemed to hesitate in saying the last couple of sentences had a queer effect on Dawson. He gave the man's face a keen look, but could read nothing there. Then, with Freddy, he thanked him for his good wishes, and walked with him out of the Administration Building, and over to where a revved up Lockheed \"Hudson\" bomber was waiting at the far end of the field. They walked almost three quarters of the way in silence, but when they got close to the waiting bomber Group Captain Bainsworth slowed up to a halt and faced them.  \"I say, a moment, you two,\" he said quietly. \"A favor I want you to do for me. After you reach New York, you'll be going on down to Washington to say hello to Colonel Welsh, of U. S. Intelligence, no doubt. Well, I have a letter I'd like you to deliver for me. It was sent out here about half an hour ago. Better stick it away out of sight. Best not to let anyone know you're carrying it, you know. Here.\"  Dawson happened to be standing closest, so he took the sealed envelope that Group Captain Bainsworth slipped out of his pocket and handed over. Dave didn't look at it, though. He looked at the group captain, licked his lips, and frowned slightly.  \"Yes, glad to, sir,\" he said. \"But--well, there's the matter of the censors, sir. On the American side, I mean. I may have to turn it over to them for inspection. That be all right, sir?\"  \"Decidedly not, Dawson!\" the senior officer replied gravely. \"Let no one see it. But don't worry. Take a look at the name and address, and you'll understand why there's no need to show it to anybody but the right party.\"  Dave held up the envelope and glanced at what was written on the outside. Freddy Farmer took a look, too. And they both stiffened and caught their breath. The envelope was addressed to--      The Hon. Cordell Hull     Secretary of State     Washington, D. C.  \"Jumping catfish!\" Dawson choked out before he could check his tongue. \"But--but why doesn't this go by diplomatic pouch, sir?\"  \"I don't know myself, Dawson,\" the group captain told him. \"For a good reason, no doubt. I simply know that it arrived here half an hour ago, along with instructions to turn it over to you two chaps for delivery. Perhaps you'll learn the reasons in Washington. Perhaps not, too. No matter, though. Just take it along, and don't let anybody get so much as a look at it. Well, let's get on over to the aircraft.\"  \"Yes, sure,\" Dave mumbled, and slid the sealed envelope into an inside pocket. \"It will be delivered, sir, without anybody else getting a look at it--not even the censors.\"  \"Splendid, splendid!\" murmured the senior officer almost absently. \"That's the thing to do. Quite!\"  A few moments later Dave and Freddy were in the bomber and Squadron Leader Hixon was slowly opening up the engines to move the aircraft forward toward the take-off runway.  \"All aboard, pal!\" Dave called out cheerfully to Freddy Farmer. \"A late breakfast in Newfoundland, lunch in the air on the way down the Canadian coast, and dinner in little old Manhattan! Boy, oh boy! And then sixty days of having fun!\"  \"Except when we have to make those blasted speeches for War Bonds!\" Freddy Farmer growled out as a tag line.     CHAPTER THREE  _Simmering Doom_   At almost the exact moment the Lockheed Hudson bomber cleared the runway at Croydon Airport, and went nosing up into the night-shrouded sky, a man entered the lobby door of a certain hotel in the West End section of London, and took the elevator to the fourteenth floor. There he got off, turned to the right, and walked along the corridor until he reached the sixth door on the left. He faced it, and hesitated a moment while he shot a sharp piercing glance back along the corridor. Satisfied that he was alone, he reached out a bony forefinger and stabbed the hotel suite button four times in rapid succession.  Thirty seconds ticked by, and then the door was opened a scant inch. There was no light to be seen through the door opening, only pitch darkness. And then a voice inside grunted, and the door was swung open wider.  \"Come in quickly, please!\" a soft, hissing voice commanded out of the darkness.  The man passed through into the darkness, and moved a little to the side so that the door could be closed. He heard the latch click. And then at a second click light flooded the suite sitting-room in which he stood. He turned his head and met the eyes of the man who had opened the door. He smiled coldly, and the corners of his mouth were a little drawn and tight.  \"You are nervous tonight, _Herr_ Kyoto?\" he muttered thickly.  The one addressed as _Herr_ Kyoto smiled broadly, but only with his lips.  \"It is better to be nervous than to be a fool, my friend,\" he said in his soft hissing voice. \"A fool dies soon. And a dead fool is of no use to his country, be he Japanese or German. You agree, yes?\"  The man who had entered the hotel suite shrugged his massive shoulders, slipped out of his heavy coat and threw it over a chair as he let his big frame drop into another one.  \"Perhaps yes, and perhaps no,\" he grunted, and watched the other glide across the rug and settle like a butterfly in a chair that would comfortably have held three of his half-pint size. \"I cannot speak for you Japanese, only for Nazis. And a man who can be a fool cannot be a Nazi. At least, he can merely be one in name only. But I speak just words. You may have a reason for your seeming nervousness? It is possible that you are not so safe in London as you would like to believe, eh?\"  The Japanese smiled again, and once again it was only with his lips. His eyes were still like those of a cobra on ice. He reached out his thin right hand and rubbed the ball of his thumb back and forth across the ends of his other four fingers.  \"During my stay of twelve years here in England, my true German friend,\" he said, \"I have spent much money so that all would be well when the day arrived. My money, my lips, and my hands have done all that was necessary to prove that I am Japanese only by birth. It is known, and believed, by all those of importance in England that instant death awaits me should I ever return to Japan. That is as I wished, and planned it to be. True, yes, I am often stopped on the street. I am often politely conducted to the nearest police station by some fool English official. But my papers are all in order. They have been so for years. And so it is always an apology and my continued freedom in less than five minutes. However, perhaps being nervous yourself causes you to think that I am? Perhaps that is what you mean?\"  The German's face became hard and brutal. He thrust out his right arm to its full length, with his fingers extended.  \"So!\" he said harshly. \"You don't see any trembling or quivering of the fingers, do you? No, and naturally so. I have no time to be nervous--about anything. I have time only to serve _Der Fuehrer_, and the Fatherland.\"  \"As in like manner I serve my Heaven-born Emperor, and Japan!\" the half-pint breathed out. \"However, you and I need have no worry about the other. Nor was this meeting arranged so that we might discuss such impossible things. It was arranged for you to make a report to me, yes? And you have a report to make, please?\"  The Nazi lowered his head for a moment, and a look of angry contempt glowed in his eyes. However, when he raised his head again his twinkling eyes matched the smile on his lips.  \"Yes, and a most interesting report, _Herr_ Kyoto,\" he said. Then, after a quick glance at his wrist watch, he went on, \"At this moment the airplane is in the air and flying westward. They are both aboard. And one of them must carry the document that was delivered to the commandant of the Croydon Airport. My agent also told me over the telephone that this commandant walked out to the airplane with them. He saw the commandant hand something to one of them, to the one named Dawson, so he believes. But because of the distance, and the bad light, my agent could not tell which of them received what the commandant gave. However, that"]]]
