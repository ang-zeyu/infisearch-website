The engine was a tangled mass of junk, and not worth salvage efforts. Besides, the pontoon was filling fast, and it wouldn't be long before the craft would be three quarters submerged and a menace to navigation in those waters. Yes, it was best to blow it up and sink it below the surface of the China Sea. Yet a plane had always been to Dave something that was almost alive, and human. It always hurt a little bit to see one of man's air creations destroyed. Yes, even when destruction was necessary.  And so as the time bomb plopped down into the cockpit Dave swallowed hard, gave the doomed plane a quick little salute of honor, and then faced the Sergeant again.  \"Say, is Air Vice Marshal Bostworth at Singapore, Sergeant?\" he asked. \"Boy, I've got the yen to tear a mile wide strip off him when we meet. We've been floating around for over five hours. Did you know that? He said that.... What's the matter?\"  Dave stopped short and asked the last because the Sergeant had suddenly stiffened and gone pale under the heavy tan on his face.  \"Fancy you can speak to the Air Vice Marshal personally, sir,\" the Sergeant said in a hoarse whisper. \"He's just behind you, waiting in the navigation compartment.\"  \"He's _what_?\" Dave gasped and felt his knees go rubbery and weak.     CHAPTER FIVE  _Official Explanations_   It was only the matter of a couple of seconds, but it seemed to Dave Dawson that it was a hundred years before he could dig up strength enough to turn around. When he did he saw the tall, thin faced figure of Air Vice Marshal Bostworth seated in the navigator's chair not ten feet from where he stood. The high ranking officer's eyes were slightly narrowed, and there was a glittering chill in their depths that made Dave wonder if he hadn't better just push open the Catalina's hull door and jump out to the sharks. Maybe they would be easier on him.  \"Come in, you two, and shut the door!\" the senior officer suddenly snapped. Then looking past the two rescued pilots, he added, \"That's all, Sergeant. Tell Flight Lieutenant Baker to take off and go to maximum ceiling and cruise about until further orders. Hop to it, man!\"  The Sergeant sprang into action, and so did Dave and Freddy. They stepped quickly into the navigation room and closed the door behind them. Dave gulped a couple of times and took the plunge.  \"Sorry, sir, I guess I spoke out of turn,\" he said lamely. \"It was dumb.\"  Air Vice Marshal Bostworth gave him a look that could cut right through steel.  \"Very dumb, Flight Lieutenant, to use your native tongue!\" he snapped. Then wiping the anger from his face, and grinning, he said, \"But, I can't say I blame you. Would have been a bit put out, myself, if I'd been in your place. However, it was something that couldn't be helped. But sit down, sit down, you two. A spot of coffee, or tea, or rum, or something? It must have been a bit of an ordeal for you.\"  \"Nothing for me, sir,\" Freddy spoke up. \"I'm quite all right, sir.\"  \"Me, too,\" Dave said with a nod. \"But, holy.... I mean, it was certainly a surprise to learn that you were out here, sir. I thought the Harkness' captain was kidding me at first. And as for what's happened since he told us, well.... Well, we're both in a sweet flat spin.\"  The senior officer started to speak but checked himself as there came the faint _crump_ of the exploding time bomb above the roar of the Catalina's engines as the pilot up forward took her off the water and aloft. As though by mutual agreement all three in the navigation room glanced down out of the porthole at the disc of frothy white water that marked where the Fairey Swordfish had met her end.  \"Well, that's one less plane England has,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth said with a sad note in his voice.  \"And I'd rather not meet up with Captain Standers for a while,\" Dave grunted. \"Darn that submarine! It....\"  He cut himself off short as the Air Vice Marshal whirled around and stared at him wide eyed.  \"Submarine?\" the senior officer echoed sharply. \"What the devil are you talking about? Weren't you shot down by plane? A plane with R.A.F. markings? That's what I imagined.\"  \"Plane?\" Dave himself echoed. \"Gosh, no! We saw some signals, and wondered what....\"  \"Wait a minute,\" the Air Vice Marshal stopped him. \"Perhaps you'd better begin at the beginning, and tell me everything. Every little detail, and don't leave out a thing. Start with when Captain Standers, of the Harkness, summoned you to his quarters to give you my orders for a two hour patrol.\"  Dave glanced at Freddy, but the English youth shook his head.  \"You tell it, Dave,\" he said.  Dave shrugged, stared at his two hands for a moment to get things arranged in his own mind, and then told detail for detail of their movements and actions from the time they were summoned by the commander of the Harkness, right up to when they scrambled aboard the patrol Catalina. Air Vice Marshal Bostworth listened in silence, but the frown on his face deepened as Dave talked along. And by the time the Yank born R.A.F. ace had finished his little speech there was both anger and worry glowing in the senior officer's eyes. Even when Dave finally stopped talking he didn't say a thing for several long moments. He sat puffing hard on a thin stemmed pipe he clutched between his teeth and scowled darkly at the clouds of blue smoke that curled upward.  \"Damnedest thing ever!\" he finally muttered. \"A Jap sub, eh? Of course it was a Jap, right enough. We've suspected that they've been sneaking close into these waters whenever they got the chance. But to come to the surface and blast away at you chaps! Well.... Well, I'll be blessed if that isn't a new one. Quite sure you couldn't make head nor tail out of their heliograph signals, eh?\"  \"Quite, sir,\" Freddy said quietly.  \"Not a single blink meant a thing,\" Dave said with a curt shake of his head. \"They certainly weren't any Morse letters or numbers that I ever learned.\"  \"A code of their own, no doubt,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth grunted. \"Well, before I start my little tale let me explain why you had to float around so long. Only I and the Admiral commanding knew that I'd radioed those orders to the Harkness, you see? I had expected to be at the Air Base to meet you but I got tied up on an inspection tour of some emergency fields on the Johore side, and didn't get back until long after I expected to. It gave me a bit of a start, I can tell you, not to find you waiting, and to see the Harkness riding at anchor in the Strait. Went aboard at once and received another start when I learned you had taken off. So I hurried ashore, routed out this Catalina crew, and came hunting for you. Thank God, we got to you in time!\"  \"We were beginning to feel less happy by the second, sir,\" Dave said with an apologetic grin. \"But one thing I can't figure is, why weren't there patrol planes out? Why didn't some other plane pick us up long before then? But we didn't see a single plane or surface ship during the whole time. We.... Hey! England's not at war with Japan, is she?\"  \"Not a declared war by either side, anyway,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth replied gravely. \"However, we are watching each other like a couple of strange cats. And if you want my opinion on the matter I think the Japs are going to have a go at us inside of ten days at the most.\"  Dave stiffened slightly and glanced at the calendar hanging on the compartment wall. It told him that today was the sixth of December, Nineteen Hundred and Forty-One. He looked at Freddy and gave him a sly wink, and then turned to the Air Vice Marshal.  \"Then that's why you came out from England in a hurry, eh?\" he murmured. \"The Japs are actually going to be saps, huh?\"  The Air Intelligence officer smiled faintly at Dawson's remark, but shook his head and raised a cautioning finger.  \"That is the spirit, Dawson,\" he said, \"but don't be carried away by the belief that the Japs would ... would be push-overs, as they say in your country. As a matter of fact, the one mistake we have made most in this blasted war, and during the years leading up to it, too, has been to underestimate the strength and ability of the enemy. The Japs may be saps, as you say, but that won't stop them from attacking if they think they hold the winning hand. And I'm afraid they do believe they hold it.\"  \"But they would be bashing their crazy heads against a stone wall!\" Freddy Farmer protested. \"I mean if they dared to have a go at Singapore. I've always been told that Singapore is every bit as impregnable as Gibraltar.\"  \"From sea attack, yes,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth said. \"But from the air? That is something else again. And as far as Singapore is concerned, the greatest weakness in its defense is not on the Island at all.\"  \"Not on the Island, sir?\" Dave Dawson echoed. \"I don't think I get you.\"  \"The water supply,\" the senior officer said. \"It comes from Johore on the mainland side of the Strait, and is piped over the causeway. Blast Singapore's water supply and the lads on the Island would have a pretty bad time of it. However, that's neither here nor there for the moment. Dawson, you asked just a moment ago why didn't some other plane pick you up before this one. I'll tell you. Because there weren't any other planes in the air. I recalled all patrols early this morning, and grounded all planes.\"  The Air Vice Marshal paused for a moment, and although a thousand questions hovered on the boys' lips, they knew enough to hold their tongues.  \"It's hard to tell the story,\" Bostworth continued presently with a frown, \"because there are so many parts of it that we don't know a thing about. In a nutshell, it's this. Everything we do out here is known in detail in Berlin, Rome, and Tokio within a few hours. The blighters couldn't be better informed if we broadcast every move we make over the radio. They are finding out everything, worse luck. That was why I was sent out here. To find the leak, or leaks,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],["title","Dave Dawson at Singapore (#6)"],["body"," plug 'em up. As you both know, the population of Singapore is as mixed in nationalities as any other spot in the whole world. I'll wager that you could find a man from every country in the world within the limits of Singapore. Not only is it a great naval base of England's, it is also one of the great trading ports of the world. And you can be very sure that the city, itself, and the waterfront, is a thriving place for spies, right now more than ever before.\"  The senior officer paused for breath and stared thoughtfully out one of the portholes. The Catalina was still climbing steadily, but it had not reached an altitude where it was necessary to reach for the small portable oxygen kits fitted to the wall.  \"I've been out here almost a week,\" the Air Intelligence officer suddenly went on, \"and what little I've discovered leads me to believe that all information about our military preparations is leaving Singapore by air. No, not radio. I mean by plane. By British plane.\"  \"A dirty rat in the R.A.F., sir?\" Dave gasped as though the very thought of such a thing were a sacrilege.  \"We've caught the type several times in the past,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth said grimly. \"Yes, to be perfectly frank with you. I've checked and rechecked the service history of every single member of Singapore R.A.F. personnel, from the Brass Hats right down to the lowest grade aircraftsman, but a fine lot of good it's done me. I can't find a single thing that even begins to look suspicious. Yet I'm sure there are one or more Axis secret agents out here wearing the R.A.F. uniform.\"  The senior officer stopped to raise a silencing hand as Dave started to interrupt.  \"I know that sounds crazy,\" he said. \"I mean, that the spy is in the R.A.F. out here. But here is my reason for thinking so. Rather, my reasons for thinking so. I've made a few tests. I've let certain bits of information become known, and then used a secret gadget we've perfected that can pick up any kind of radio broadcast on any wave-length within a radius of two hundred miles. And can do it while nearby powerful stations are operating. But we didn't hear a single broadcast of which we didn't know the code and couldn't decipher easily. I've checked all ship movements, and all movements of troops going over the causeway. And all civilians, too. However, all the information I had purposely let slip reached the Berlin Government in a very short time. That was reported to me by my own agents. So I was sure all of the information left here by plane. It must have. But.... But I must confess I didn't even dream they did it the way your experience seems to prove they do it.\"  \"Then that two hour patrol we were supposed to have made, and did make?\" Dave said with a puzzled frown. \"You expected us to spot the spy in his plane tearing off to pass on the information to somebody else? But maybe we might not have given him a single glance. At least, not a second glance.\"  Air Vice Marshal Bostworth shook his head and struck a match to fire up his dead pipe.  \"No, not exactly that,\" he said presently. \"I let out a rather valuable bit of information concerning coming reenforcements out here, and then grounded all planes. Used the excuse of general overhaul and inspection. At the same time I arranged for you chaps to buzz around over the Strait. First, I wanted to see if our little spy friend would risk it to fly off with his bit of information in the face of my grounding order. If he did, we could jolly well radio you chaps his direction and orders to head him off at all cost. Secondly, if the blighter didn't try to sneak off ... which he didn't, blast him ... I wanted you chaps out there to spot any plane of _any_ type that might attempt to contact you in the air. In other words I was counting on you chaps to help me get a line on the _other_ plane that I believed was flying out each day from Japanese controlled Indo-China to contact their man in our forces. I was hoping for a description of the plane, what direction it came from, and so forth. I had thought up a little stunt to pull.... But that's out, now. Our friend isn't contacting another plane. He is, of course, contacting a submarine. A Jap sub, no doubt, but I'll wager a thousand pounds it's commanded by a trained Nazi. So you see, when you didn't show up, and I found you floating on the water, I thought that you'd had a bit of a go with this supposedly other plane, and come off second best. Good lord, though, that submarine was bold as brass to surface and actually blaze away at you! To me that means they're getting very cocky. And of course I'm speaking of the Jap johnnies.\"  \"Contacts a Jap tin can, huh, and probably drops his information by signal buoy?\" Dave murmured more to himself. \"The sub slips on to sea and radioes the stuff to its nearest base.\"  \"Correct,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth said with a curt nod. \"And from that particular base it is relayed on to Tokio. And from Tokio it goes to Berlin. And Hitler knows all about the very latest things we've accomplished out here. And Tokio has another bit of information on what she'll be up against when she attacks us.\"  \"And she will, you feel sure, sir?\" Freddy Farmer spoke for the first time in many minutes.  \"Unfortunately, there isn't the slightest doubt of it,\" the Air Intelligence officer replied. \"Yes, we expect war, rather, we expect an attack, and very soon. We're getting ready for it just as fast as we can. However, our forces are not strong, particularly in the air, and what we've got to find out ... and it'll probably require a miracle to find it out ... is just where, when, and how the Japs plan to strike. I don't think it will be by sea. And I don't think it will be by land down the Malay Peninsula _unless_ they are forced to. I have a feeling they will attempt a quick knockout by air. That perhaps they'll have a go at Hongkong and Singapore at the same time. I don't know. If only I could catch the sly beggar who's getting out all the information, I could put a plan to work that might get very good results that will tip the Japs' hand as to just what they will try once they get the go-ahead word from Berlin. But....\"  The Air Vice Marshal sighed heavily and gave an angry shake of his head.  \"But so long as the leak remains,\" he grated through clenched teeth, \"we're definitely in the soup. And heaven only knows what may come of it. We haven't the fighting strength we need to beat off an all out attack. And I'm very much afraid we're not going to get reenforcements in time.\"  The Air Vice Marshal fell silent for a few moments, stared unseeing off into space, and absently tapped the stem of his pipe against his strong teeth. Eventually he grunted as though he had reached some kind of a decision, and switched his gaze to the two R.A.F. youths.  \"We've got to find out what the Japs, coached by the Nazis of course, are planning,\" he said slowly. \"I think there's a way we can do it. True, it's about one chance in a thousand of succeeding. And.... Well, the attempt could well possibly cost the lives of a couple of brave chaps.\"  The Intelligence Officer emphasized the last with a faint gesture of his hand, and for the next minute or so there was no sound in the navigation compartment save the muffled roar of the engines outside. Dave looked at Freddy, caught his grim nod, and turned to the Air Vice Marshal.  \"Well, I know a couple of fellows who would like to take a crack at it, sir,\" he said in a quiet, steady voice.     CHAPTER SIX  _The Devil's Den_   The Air Ministry official looked at them, smiled and seemed to let clamped air out of his lungs.  \"I knew, of course, that you'd say that,\" he said. \"But I was not exaggerating when I said you might pay for your efforts with your lives. Strictly speaking, it is not an Air Force job. I mean, there may or may not be any flying attached to it. The task is very definitely Intelligence work. Lord knows any one of us Intelligence chaps out here in the Far East would be only too glad to have a go at it. However, every British Intelligence Johnnie in these parts is well known to Axis agents here. Just as we have a pretty good idea who is working against us ... though we haven't yet laid them all by the heels.\"  The Air Vice Marshal paused and gave an angry shake of his head as though he were getting himself all mixed up.  \"I'd better tell what little I know,\" he said, \"and perhaps between us we can fill some of the holes with close guesses. Well, here goes. In the city of Singapore, near the waterfront, there is a street called Bukum Street. It is actually little more than an alley crowded on both sides with rickety two story frame buildings with open store fronts on the lower floors. They say that when you want to find Bukum Street you don't bother to ask a native policeman. You simply stand still and sniff. Then follow the most terrible smell of them all, and at its source you will find Bukum Street.  \"Halfway along the waterfront side of Bukum Street there is a little spice and coffee shop very appropriately called the Devil's Den. It is owned and operated by a man named Serrangi who looks as old as the city itself. He is a Sumatran, as far as we can find out, but I fancy he has a little of all the bloods of the Far East in his veins. He is a hideous looking creature. Face terribly scarred, and he has a cast in his right eye. But he is more diabolically clever than Satan, himself. We know that he is a thief, that he would murder any one for you for the price of a few pennies, and, that there is no intrigue brewing in which he hasn't got at least the tip of his finger. But, to our discredit, if you wish, the British Singapore authorities haven't been able to catch him redhanded in a single thing. Personally, I think we should throw the beggar in prison, and be done with it. Unfortunately, though, the white man's laws do not operate that way. Also, Serrangi has a tremendous influence with the native population. To punish"]]]
