It's so hard for me to think. Mother, mother! That's why I came downtown. I wanted a friend. I have something for you to give to mother.”  “Rats,” I said. “I'll take you to her. What are you talking about?”  But he shook his head.  “I wish that you were telling the truth, Harry. But it's no use--not after tonight. All the doctors in the world could not save me. I'm not sick, boys, far from it.”  Hobart spoke up.  “What is it, Chick? I have a suspicion. Am I right?”  Chick looked up; he closed his eyes.  “All right, Hobart, what's your suspicion?”  Fenton leaned over. It seemed to me that he was peering into the other's soul. He touched his forearm.  “Chick, old boy, I think I know. But tell me. Am I right? It's the Blind Spot.”  At the words Watson opened his eyes; they were full of hope and wonder, for a moment, and then, as suddenly of a great despair. His body went to a heap. His voice was feeble.  “Yes,” he answered, “I am dying--of the Blind Spot”     VII  THE RING   It was a terrible thing; death stalking out of the Blind Spot. We had almost forgotten. It had been a story hitherto--a wonderful one to be sure, and one to arouse conjecture. I had never thought that we were to be brought to its shivering contact. It was out of the occult; it had been so pronounced by the professor; a great secret of life holding out a guerdon of death to its votaries. Witness Chick Watson, the type of healthy, fighting manhood--come to this. He opened his eyes feebly; one could see the light; the old spirit was there--fighting for life. What was this struggle of soul and flesh? Why had the soul hung on? He made another effort.  “More drink,” he asked; “more drink. Anything to hold me together. I must tell you. You must take my place and--and--fight the Blind Spot! Promise that--”  “Order the drinks,” I told Hobart. “I see Dr. Hansen over there. Even if we cannot save him we must hold him until we get his story.”  I went and fetched Hansen over.  “A strange case,” he murmured. “Pulse normal; not a trace of fever. Not sick, you say--” Hobart pointed to his head. “Ah, I see! I would suggest home and a bed.”  Just here Watson opened his eyes again. They rested first upon the doctor, then upon myself, and finally upon the brandy. He took it up and drank it with eagerness. It was his third one; it gave him a bit more life.  “Didn't I tell you, boys, that there is not a doctor on earth that can save me? Excuse me, doc. I am not sick. I told them. I am far past physic; I have gone beyond medicine. All I ask is stimulant and life enough to tell my story.”  “My boy,” asked the doctor kindly, “what ails you?”  Watson smiled. He touched himself on the forehead.  “Up here, doc. There are things in the world with which we may not tamper. I tried it. Somebody had to do it and somebody has to do it yet. You remember Dr. Holcomb; he was a great man; he was after the secret of life. He began it.”  Dr. Hansen started.  “Lord!” he exclaimed, looking at us all; “you don't mean this man is mixed up in the Blind Spot?”  We nodded. Watson smiled; again he dropped back into inertia; the speech he had made was his longest yet; the brandy was coming into effect.  “Give him brandy,” the doctor said; “it's as good as anything. It will hold him together and give him life for a while. Here.” He reached into his pocket and flicked something into the glass. “That will help him. Gentlemen, do you know what it means? I had always thought! I knew Dr. Holcomb! Crossing over the border! It may not be done! The secret of life is impossible. Yet--”  Watson opened his eyes again; his spirit seemed suddenly to flicker into defiance.  “Who said it was impossible? Who said it? Gentlemen, it IS possible. Dr. Holcomb--pardon me. I do not wish to appear a sot; but this brandy is about the only thing to hold me together. I have only a few hours left.”  He took the glass, and at one gulp downed the contents. I do not know what the doctor had dropped into it. Chick revived suddenly, and a strange light blazed up in his eyes, like life rekindled.  “Ah, now I am better. So?”  He turned to us all; then to the doctor.  “So you say the secret of life is impossible?”  “I--”  Chick smiled wanly. “May I ask you: what it is that has just flared up within me? I am weak, anaemic, fallen to pieces; my muscles have lost the power to function, my blood runs cold, I have been more than two feet over the border. And yet--a few drinks of brandy, of stimulants, and you have drawn me back, my heart beats strongly, for an hour. By means of drugs you have infused a new life--which of course is the old--and driven the material components of my body into correlation. You are successful for a time; so long as nature is with you; but all the while you are held aghast by the knowledge that the least flaw, the least disarrangement, and you are beaten.  “It is your business to hold this life or what you may. When it has gone your structures, your anatomy, your wonderful human machine is worthless. Where has it come from? Where has it gone? I have drunk four glasses of brandy; I have a lease of four short hours. Ordinarily it would bring reaction; it is poison, to be sure; but it is driving back my spirit, giving me life and strength enough to tell my story--in the morning I shall be no more. By sequence I am a dead man already. Four glasses of brandy; they are speaking. Whence comes this affinity of substance and of shadow?”  We all of us listened, the doctor most of all. “Go on,” he said.  “Can't you see?” repeated Watson. “There is affinity between substance and shadow; and therefore your spirit or shadow or what you will is concrete, is in itself a substance. It is material just as much as you are. Because you do not see it is no proof that it is not substance. That pot palm yonder does not see you; it is not blessed with eyes.”  The doctor looked at Watson; he spoke gently.  “This is very old stuff, my boy, out of your abstract philosophy. No man knows the secret of life. Not even yourself.”  The light in Watson's eyes grew brighter, he straightened; he began slipping the ring from his finger.  “No,” he answered. “I don't. I have tried and it was like playing with lightning. I sought for life and it is giving me death. But there is one man living who has found it.”  “And this man?”  “Is Dr. Holcomb!”  We all of us started. We had every one given the doctor up as dead. The very presence of Watson was tragedy. We did not doubt that he had been through some terrible experience. There are things in the world that may not be unriddled. Some power, some sinister thing was reaching for his vitality. What did he know about the professor? Dr. Holcomb had been a long time dead.  “Gentlemen. You must hear my story; I haven't long to tell it. However, before I start here is a proof for a beginning.”  He tossed the ring upon the table.  It was Hobart who picked it up. A beautiful stone, like a sapphire; blue but uncut and of a strange pellucid transparency--a jewel undoubtedly; but of a kind we have never seen. We all of us examined it, and were all, I am afraid, a bit disappointed. It was a stone and nothing else.  Watson watched us. The waiter had brought more brandy, and Watson was sipping it, not because he liked it, he said, but just to keep himself at the proper lift.  “You don't understand it, eh? You see nothing? Hobart, have you a match? There, that's it; now give me the ring. See--” He struck the match and held the flame against the jewel. “Gentlemen, there is no need for me to speak. The stone will give you a volume. It's not trickery, I assure you, but fact. There, now, perfect. Doctor, you are the sceptic. Take a look at the stone.”  The doctor picked it up casually and held it up before his eyes. At first he frowned; then came a look of incredulity; his chin dropped and he rose in his chair.  “My God,” he exclaimed, “the man's living! It--he--”  But Hobart and I had crowded over. The doctor held the ring so we could see it. Inside the stone was Dr. Holcomb!  It was a strenuous moment, and the most incredible. We all of us knew the doctor. It was not a photograph, nor a likeness; but the man himself. It was beyond all reason that he could be in the jewel; indeed there was only the head visible; one could catch the expression of life, the movements of the eyelids. Yet how could it be? What was it? It was Hobart who spoke first.  “Chick,” he asked, “what's the meaning? Were it not for my own eyes I would call it impossible. It's absurd on the face. The doctor! Yet I can see him--living. Where is he?”  Chick nodded.  “That's the whole question. Where is he? I know and yet I know nothing. You are now looking into the Blind Spot. The doctor sought the secret of life--and found it. He was trapped by his own wisdom!”     VIII  THE NERVINA   For a moment we were silent. The jewel reposed upon the table. What was the secret of its phenomena? I could think of nothing in science that would explain it. How had Watson come into its possession? What was the tale he had to tell? The lean, long finger that clutched for brandy! What force was this that had driven him to such a verge? He was resigned; though he was defiant he had already conceded his surrender. Dr. Hansen spoke.  “Watson,” he asked, “what do you know about the Blind Spot?”  “Nothing.”  We all turned to Chick. Hobart ordered more brandy. The doctor's eyes went to slits. I could not but wonder.  “Chick,” I asked, “who is Rhamda Avec?”  Watson turned.  “You saw him a few minutes ago? You saw him with me? Let me ask you.”  “Yes,” I answered, “I saw him. Most people did. Is he invisible? Is he really the phantom they say?”  Somehow the mention of the name made him nervous; he looked cautiously about the room.  “That I don't know, Harry. It--If I can only get my wits together. Is he a phantom? Yes, I think so. I can't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4922"],["title","Bar-20 Days (#0)"],["body","BAR-20 DAYS  By Clarence E. Mulford    AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED TO “M. D.”      BAR-20 DAYS    CHAPTER I  ON A STRANGE RANGE  Two tired but happy punchers rode into the coast town and dismounted in front of the best hotel. Putting up their horses as quickly as possible they made arrangements for sleeping quarters and then hastened out to attend to business. Buck had been kind to delegate this mission to them and they would feel free to enjoy what pleasures the town might afford. While at that time the city was not what it is now, nevertheless it was capable of satisfying what demands might be made upon it by two very active and zealous cow-punchers. Their first experience began as they left the hotel.  “Hey, you cow-wrastlers!” said a not unpleasant voice, and they turned suspiciously as it continued: “You've shore got to hang up them guns with the hotel clerk while you cavorts around on this range. This is _fence_ country.”  They regarded the speaker's smiling face and twinkling eyes and laughed. “Well, yo're the foreman if you owns that badge,” grinned Hopalong, cheerfully. “We don't need no guns, nohow, in this town, we don't. Plumb forgot we was toting them. But mebby you can tell us where lawyer Jeremiah T. Jones grazes in daylight?”  “Right over yonder, second floor,” replied the marshal. “An' come to think of it, mebby you better leave most of yore cash with the guns--somebody'll take it away from you if you don't. It'd be an awful temptation, an' flesh is weak.”  “Huh!” laughed Johnny, moving back into the hotel to leave his gun, closely followed by Hopalong. “Anybody that can turn that little trick on me an' Hoppy will shore earn every red cent; why, we've been to Kansas City!”  As they emerged again Johnny slapped his pocket, from which sounded a musical jingling. “If them weak people try anything on us, we may come between them and _their_ money!” he boasted.  “From the bottom of my heart I pity you,” called the marshal, watching them depart, a broad smile illuminating his face. “In about twenty-four hours they'll put up a holler for me to go git it back for 'em,” he muttered. “An' I almost believe I'll do it, too. I ain't never seen none of that breed what ever left a town without empty pockets an' aching heads--an' the smarter they think they are the easier they fall.” A fleeting expression of discontent clouded the smile, for the lure of the open range is hard to resist when once a man has ridden free under its sky and watched its stars. “An' I wish I was one of 'em again,” he muttered, sauntering on.  Jeremiah T. Jones, Esq., was busy when his door opened, but he leaned back in his chair and smiled pleasantly at their bow-legged entry, waving them towards two chairs. Hopalong hung his sombrero on a letter press and tipped his chair back against the wall; Johnny hung grimly to his hat, sat stiffly upright until he noticed his companion's pose, and then, deciding that everything was all right, and that Hopalong was better up in etiquette than himself, pitched his sombrero dexterously over the water pitcher and also leaned against the wall. Nobody could lose him when it came to doing the right thing.  “Well, gentlemen, you look tired and thirsty. This is considered good for all human ailments of whatsoever nature, degree, or wheresoever located, in part or entirety, _ab initio_,” Mr. Jones remarked, filling glasses. There was no argument and when the glasses were empty, he continued: “Now what can I do for you? From the Bar-20? Ah, yes; I was expecting you. We'll get right at it,” and they did. Half an hour later they emerged on the street, free to take in the town, or to have the town take them in,--which was usually the case.  “What was that he said for us to keep away from?” asked Johnny with keen interest.  “Sh! Not so loud,” chuckled Hopalong, winking prodigiously.  Johnny pulled tentatively at his upper lip but before he could reply his companion had accosted a stranger.  “Friend, we're pilgrims in a strange land, an' we don't know the trails. Can you tell us where the docks are?”  “Certainly; glad to. You'll find them at the end of this street,” and he smilingly waved them towards the section of the town which Jeremiah T. Jones had specifically and earnestly warned them to avoid.  “Wonder if you're as thirsty as me?” solicitously inquired Hopalong of his companion.  “I was just wondering the same,” replied Johnny. “Say,” he confided in a lower voice, “blamed if I don't feel sort of lost without that Colt. Every time I lifts my right laig she goes too high--don't feel natural, nohow.”  “Same here; I'm allus feeling to see if I lost it,” Hopalong responded. “There ain't no rubbing, no weight, nor nothing.”  “Wish I had something to put in its place, blamed if I don't.”  “Why, now yo're talking--mebby we can buy something,” grinned Hopalong, happily. “Here's a hardware store--come on in.”  The clerk looked up and laid aside his novel. “Good-morning, gentlemen; what can I do for you? We've just got in some fine new rifles,” he suggested.  The customers exchanged looks and it was Hopalong who first found his voice. “Nope, don't want no rifles,” he replied, glancing around. “To tell the truth, I don't know just what we do want, but we want something, all right--got to have it. It's a funny thing, come to think of it; I can't never pass a hardware store without going in an' buying something. I've been told my father was the same way, so I must inherit it. It's the same with my pardner, here, only he gets his weakness from his whole family, and it's different from mine. He can't pass a saloon without going in an' buying something.”  “Yo're a cheerful liar, an' you know it,” retorted Johnny. “You know the reason why I goes in saloons so much--you'd never leave 'em if I didn't drag you out. He inherits that weakness from his grandfather, twice removed,” he confided to the astonished clerk, whose expression didn't know what to express.  “Let's see: a saw?” soliloquized Hopalong. “Nope; got lots of 'em, an' they're all genuine Colts,” he mused thoughtfully. “Axe? Nails? Augurs? Corkscrews? Can we use a corkscrew, Johnny? Ah, thought I'd wake you up. Now, what was it Cookie said for us to bring him? Bacon? Got any bacon? Too bad--oh, don't apologize; it's all right. Cold chisels--that's the thing if you ain't got no bacon. Let me see a three-pound cold chisel about as big as that,”--extending a huge and crooked forefinger,--“an' with a big bulge at one end. Straight in the middle, circling off into a three-cornered wavy edge on the other side. What? Look here! You can't tell us nothing about saloons that we don't know. I want a three-pound cold chisel, any kind, so it's cold.”  Johnny nudged him. “How about them wedges?”  “Twenty-five cents a pound,” explained the clerk, groping for his bearings.  “They might do,” Hopalong muttered, forcing the article mentioned into his holster. “Why, they're quite hocus-pocus. You take the brother to mine, Johnny.”  “Feels good, but I dunno,” his companion muttered. “Little wide at the sharp end. Hey, got any loose shot?” he suddenly asked, whereat Hopalong beamed and the clerk gasped. It didn't seem to matter whether they bought bacon, cold chisels, wedges, or shot; yet they looked sober.  “Yes, sir; what size?”  “Three pounds of shot, I said!” Johnny rumbled in his throat. “Never mind what size.”  “We never care about size when we buy shot,” Hopalong smiled. “But, Johnny, wouldn't them little screws be better?” he asked, pointing eagerly.  “Mebby; reckon we better get 'em mixed--half of each,” Johnny gravely replied. “Anyhow, there ain't much difference.”  The clerk had been behind that counter for four years, and executing and filling orders had become a habit with him; else he would have given them six pounds of cold chisels and corkscrews, mixed. His mouth was still open when he weighed out the screws.  “Mix 'em! Mix 'em!” roared Hopalong, and the stunned clerk complied, and charged them for the whole purchase at the rate set down for screws.  Hopalong started to pour his purchase into the holster which, being open at the bottom, gayly passed the first instalment through to the floor. He stopped and looked appealingly at Johnny, and Johnny, in pain from holding back screams of laughter, looked at him indignantly. Then a guileless smile crept over Hopalong's face and he stopped the opening with a wad of wrapping paper and disposed of the shot and screws, Johnny following his laudable example. After haggling a moment over the bill they paid it and walked out, to the apparent joy of the clerk.  “Don't laugh, Kid; you'll spoil it all,” warned Hopalong, as he noted signs of distress on his companion's face. “Now, then; what was it we said about thirst? Come on; I see one already.”  Having entered the saloon and ordered, Hopalong beamed upon the bartender and shoved his glass back again. “One more, kind stranger; it's good stuff.”  “Yes, feels like a shore-enough gun,” remarked Johnny, combining two thoughts in one expression, which is brevity.  The bartender looked at him quickly and then stood quite still and listened, a puzzled expression on his face.  _Tic--tickety-tick--tic-tic_, came strange sounds from the other side of the bar. Hopalong was intently studying a chromo on the wall and Johnny gazed vacantly out of the window.  “What's that? What in the deuce is that?” quickly demanded the man with the apron, swiftly reaching for his bung-starter.  _Tickety-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic_, the noise went on, and Hopalong, slowly rolling his eyes, looked at the floor. A screw rebounded and struck his foot, while shot were rolling recklessly.  “Them's making the noise,” Johnny explained after critical survey.  “Hang it! I knowed we ought to 'a' got them wedges!” Hopalong exclaimed, petulantly, closing the bottom of the sheath. “Why, I won't have no gun left soon 'less I holds it in.” The complaint was plaintive.  “Must be filtering through the stopper,” Johnny remarked. “But"]]]
