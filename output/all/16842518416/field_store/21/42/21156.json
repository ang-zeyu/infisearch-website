I suppose you had something salt for breakfast, Samuel?\" queried Miss Dearborn with sarcasm.  \"I had m-m-mackerel, j-just like Reb-b-becca.\" (Irrepressible giggles by the school.)  \"I judged so. Stand by the other side of the pail, Samuel.\"  Rebecca's head was bowed with shame and wrath. Life looked too black a thing to be endured. The punishment was bad enough, but to be coupled in correction with Seesaw Simpson was beyond human endurance.  Singing was the last exercise in the afternoon, and Minnie Smellie chose Shall we Gather at the River? It was a baleful choice and seemed to hold some secret and subtle association with the situation and general progress of events; or at any rate there was apparently some obscure reason for the energy and vim with which the scholars shouted the choral invitation again and again:--    \"Shall we gather at the river,   The beautiful, the beautiful river?\"  Miss Dearborn stole a look at Rebecca's bent head and was frightened. The child's face was pale save for two red spots glowing on her cheeks. Tears hung on her lashes; her breath came and went quickly, and the hand that held her pocket handkerchief trembled like a leaf.  \"You may go to your seat, Rebecca,\" said Miss Dearborn at the end of the first song. \"Samuel, stay where you are till the close of school. And let me tell you, scholars, that I asked Rebecca to stand by the pail only to break up this habit of incessant drinking, which is nothing but empty-mindedness and desire to walk to and fro over the floor. Every time Rebecca has asked for a drink to-day the whole school has gone to the pail one after another. She is really thirsty, and I dare say I ought to have punished you for following her example, not her for setting it. What shall we sing now, Alice?\"  \"The Old Oaken Bucket, please.\"  \"Think of something dry, Alice, and change the subject. Yes, The Star Spangled Banner if you like, or anything else.\"  Rebecca sank into her seat and pulled the singing book from her desk. Miss Dearborn's public explanation had shifted some of the weight from her heart, and she felt a trifle raised in her self-esteem.  Under cover of the general relaxation of singing, votive offerings of respectful sympathy began to make their appearance at her shrine. Living Perkins, who could not sing, dropped a piece of maple sugar in her lap as he passed her on his way to the blackboard to draw the map of Maine. Alice Robinson rolled a perfectly new slate pencil over the floor with her foot until it reached Rebecca's place, while her seat-mate, Emma Jane, had made up a little mound of paper balls and labeled them \"Bullets for you know who.\"  Altogether existence grew brighter, and when she was left alone with the teacher for her grammar lesson she had nearly recovered her equanimity, which was more than Miss Dearborn had. The last clattering foot had echoed through the hall, Seesaw's backward glance of penitence had been met and answered defiantly by one of cold disdain.  \"Rebecca, I am afraid I punished you more than I meant,\" said Miss Dearborn, who was only eighteen herself, and in her year of teaching country schools had never encountered a child like Rebecca.  \"I hadn't missed a question this whole day, nor whispered either,\" quavered the culprit; \"and I don't think I ought to be shamed just for drinking.\"  \"You started all the others, or it seemed as if you did. Whatever you do they all do, whether you laugh, or miss, or write notes, or ask to leave the room, or drink; and it must be stopped.\"  \"Sam Simpson is a copycoat!\" stormed Rebecca \"I wouldn't have minded standing in the corner alone--that is, not so very much; but I couldn't bear standing with him.\"  \"I saw that you couldn't, and that's the reason I told you to take your seat, and left him in the corner. Remember that you are a stranger in the place, and they take more notice of what you do, so you must be careful. Now let's have our conjugations. Give me the verb 'to be,' potential mood, past perfect tense.\"    \"I might have been           \"We might have been   Thou mightst have been       You might have been   He might have been           They might have been.\"  \"Give me an example, please.\"    \"I might have been glad   Thou mightst have been glad   He, she, or it might have been glad.\"  \"'He' or 'she' might have been glad because they are masculine and feminine, but could 'it' have been glad?\" asked Miss Dearborn, who was very fond of splitting hairs.  \"Why not?\" asked Rebecca  \"Because 'it' is neuter gender.\"  \"Couldn't we say, 'The kitten might have been glad if it had known it was not going to be drowned'?\"  \"Ye--es,\" Miss Dearborn answered hesitatingly, never very sure of herself under Rebecca's fire; \"but though we often speak of a baby, a chicken, or a kitten as 'it,' they are really masculine or feminine gender, not neuter.\"  Rebecca reflected a long moment and then asked, \"Is a hollyhock neuter?\"  \"Oh yes, of course it is, Rebecca\"  \"Well, couldn't we say, 'The hollyhock might have been glad to see the rain, but there was a weak little hollyhock bud growing out of its stalk and it was afraid that that might be hurt by the storm; so the big hollyhock was kind of afraid, instead of being real glad'?\"  Miss Dearborn looked puzzled as she answered, \"Of course, Rebecca, hollyhocks could not be sorry, or glad, or afraid, really.\"  \"We can't tell, I s'pose,\" replied the child; \"but _I_ think they are, anyway. Now what shall I say?\"  \"The subjunctive mood, past perfect tense of the verb 'to know.'\"    \"If I had known            \"If we had known   If thou hadst known        If you had known   If he had known            If they had known.  \"Oh, it is the saddest tense,\" sighed Rebecca with a little break in her voice; \"nothing but IFS, IFS, IFS! And it makes you feel that if they only HAD known, things might have been better!\"  Miss Dearborn had not thought of it before, but on reflection she believed the subjunctive mood was a \"sad\" one and \"if\" rather a sorry \"part of speech.\"  \"Give me some more examples of the subjunctive, Rebecca, and that will do for this afternoon,\" she said.  \"If I had not loved mackerel I should not have been thirsty;\" said Rebecca with an April smile, as she closed her grammar. \"If thou hadst loved me truly thou wouldst not have stood me up in the corner. If Samuel had not loved wickedness he would not have followed me to the water pail.\"  \"And if Rebecca had loved the rules of the school she would have controlled her thirst,\" finished Miss Dearborn with a kiss, and the two parted friends.    VI  SUNSHINE IN A SHADY PLACE  The little schoolhouse on the hill had its moments of triumph as well as its scenes of tribulation, but it was fortunate that Rebecca had her books and her new acquaintances to keep her interested and occupied, or life would have gone heavily with her that first summer in Riverboro. She tried to like her aunt Miranda (the idea of loving her had been given up at the moment of meeting), but failed ignominiously in the attempt. She was a very faulty and passionately human child, with no aspirations towards being an angel of the house, but she had a sense of duty and a desire to be good,--respectably, decently good. Whenever she fell below this self-imposed standard she was miserable. She did not like to be under her aunt's roof, eating bread, wearing clothes, and studying books provided by her, and dislike her so heartily all the time. She felt instinctively that this was wrong and mean, and whenever the feeling of remorse was strong within her she made a desperate effort to please her grim and difficult relative. But how could she succeed when she was never herself in her aunt Miranda's presence? The searching look of the eyes, the sharp voice, the hard knotty fingers, the thin straight lips, the long silences, the \"front-piece\" that didn't match her hair, the very obvious \"parting\" that seemed sewed in with linen thread on black net,--there was not a single item that appealed to Rebecca. There are certain narrow, unimaginative, and autocratic old people who seem to call out the most mischievous, and sometimes the worst traits in children. Miss Miranda, had she lived in a populous neighborhood, would have had her doorbell pulled, her gate tied up, or \"dirt traps\" set in her garden paths. The Simpson twins stood in such awe of her that they could not be persuaded to come to the side door even when Miss Jane held gingerbread cookies in her outstretched hands.  It is needless to say that Rebecca irritated her aunt with every breath she drew. She continually forgot and started up the front stairs because it was the shortest route to her bedroom; she left the dipper on the kitchen shelf instead of hanging it up over the pail; she sat in the chair the cat liked best; she was willing to go on errands, but often forgot what she was sent for; she left the screen doors ajar, so that flies came in; her tongue was ever in motion; she sang or whistled when she was picking up chips; she was always messing with flowers, putting them in vases, pinning them on her dress, and sticking them in her hat; finally she was an everlasting reminder of her foolish, worthless father, whose handsome face and engaging manner had so deceived Aurelia, and perhaps, if the facts were known, others besides Aurelia. The Randalls were aliens. They had not been born in Riverboro nor even in York County. Miranda would have allowed, on compulsion, that in the nature of things a large number of persons must necessarily be born outside this sacred precinct; but she had her opinion of them, and it was not a flattering one. Now if Hannah had come--Hannah took after the other side of the house; she was \"all Sawyer.\" (Poor Hannah! that was true!) Hannah spoke only when spoken to, instead of first, last, and all the time; Hannah at fourteen was a member of the church; Hannah liked to knit; Hannah was, probably, or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/498"],["title","Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (#8)"],["body","have been, a pattern of all the smaller virtues; instead of which here was this black-haired gypsy, with eyes as big as cartwheels, installed as a member of the household.  What sunshine in a shady place was aunt Jane to Rebecca! Aunt Jane with her quiet voice, her understanding eyes, her ready excuses, in these first difficult weeks, when the impulsive little stranger was trying to settle down into the \"brick house ways.\" She did learn them, in part, and by degrees, and the constant fitting of herself to these new and difficult standards of conduct seemed to make her older than ever for her years.  The child took her sewing and sat beside aunt Jane in the kitchen while aunt Miranda had the post of observation at the sitting-room window. Sometimes they would work on the side porch where the clematis and woodbine shaded them from the hot sun. To Rebecca the lengths of brown gingham were interminable. She made hard work of sewing, broke the thread, dropped her thimble into the syringa bushes, pricked her finger, wiped the perspiration from her forehead, could not match the checks, puckered the seams. She polished her needles to nothing, pushing them in and out of the emery strawberry, but they always squeaked. Still aunt Jane's patience held good, and some small measure of skill was creeping into Rebecca's fingers, fingers that held pencil, paint brush, and pen so cleverly and were so clumsy with the dainty little needle.  When the first brown gingham frock was completed, the child seized what she thought an opportune moment and asked her aunt Miranda if she might have another color for the next one.  \"I bought a whole piece of the brown,\" said Miranda laconically. \"That'll give you two more dresses, with plenty for new sleeves, and to patch and let down with, an' be more economical.\"  \"I know. But Mr. Watson says he'll take back part of it, and let us have pink and blue for the same price.\"  \"Did you ask him?\"  \"Yes'm.\"  \"It was none o' your business.\"  \"I was helping Emma Jane choose aprons, and didn't think you'd mind which color I had. Pink keeps clean just as nice as brown, and Mr. Watson says it'll boil without fading.\"  \"Mr. Watson 's a splendid judge of washing, I guess. I don't approve of children being rigged out in fancy colors, but I'll see what your aunt Jane thinks.\"  \"I think it would be all right to let Rebecca have one pink and one blue gingham,\" said Jane. \"A child gets tired of sewing on one color. It's only natural she should long for a change; besides she'd look like a charity child always wearing the same brown with a white apron. And it's dreadful unbecoming to her!\"  \"'Handsome is as handsome does,' say I. Rebecca never'll come to grief along of her beauty, that's certain, and there's no use in humoring her to think about her looks. I believe she's vain as a peacock now, without anything to be vain of.\"  \"She's young and attracted to bright things--that's all. I remember well enough how I felt at her age.\"  \"You was considerable of a fool at her age, Jane.\"  \"Yes, I was, thank the Lord! I only wish I'd known how to take a little of my foolishness along with me, as some folks do, to brighten my declining years.\"  There finally was a pink gingham, and when it was nicely finished, aunt Jane gave Rebecca a delightful surprise. She showed her how to make a pretty trimming of narrow white linen tape, by folding it in pointed shapes and sewing it down very flat with neat little stitches.  \"It'll be good fancy work for you, Rebecca; for your aunt Miranda won't like to see you always reading in the long winter evenings. Now if you think you can baste two rows of white tape round the bottom of your pink skirt and keep it straight by the checks, I'll stitch them on for you and trim the waist and sleeves with pointed tape-trimming, so the dress'll be real pretty for second best.\"  Rebecca's joy knew no bounds. \"I'll baste like a house afire!\" she exclaimed. \"It's a thousand yards round that skirt, as well I know, having hemmed it; but I could sew pretty trimming on if it was from here to Milltown. Oh! do you think aunt Mirandy'll ever let me go to Milltown with Mr. Cobb? He's asked me again, you know; but one Saturday I had to pick strawberries, and another it rained, and I don't think she really approves of my going. It's TWENTY-NINE minutes past four, aunt Jane, and Alice Robinson has been sitting under the currant bushes for a long time waiting for me. Can I go and play?\"  \"Yes, you may go, and you'd better run as far as you can out behind the barn, so 't your noise won't distract your aunt Mirandy. I see Susan Simpson and the twins and Emma Jane Perkins hiding behind the fence.\"  Rebecca leaped off the porch, snatched Alice Robinson from under the currant bushes, and, what was much more difficult, succeeded, by means of a complicated system of signals, in getting Emma Jane away from the Simpson party and giving them the slip altogether. They were much too small for certain pleasurable activities planned for that afternoon; but they were not to be despised, for they had the most fascinating dooryard in the village. In it, in bewildering confusion, were old sleighs, pungs, horse rakes, hogsheads, settees without backs, bed-steads without heads, in all stages of disability, and never the same on two consecutive days. Mrs. Simpson was seldom at home, and even when she was, had little concern as to what happened on the premises. A favorite diversion was to make the house into a fort, gallantly held by a handful of American soldiers against a besieging force of the British army. Great care was used in apportioning the parts, for there was no disposition to let anybody win but the Americans. Seesaw Simpson was usually made commander-in-chief of the British army, and a limp and uncertain one he was, capable, with his contradictory orders and his fondness for the extreme rear, of leading any regiment to an inglorious death. Sometimes the long-suffering house was a log hut, and the brave settlers defeated a band of hostile Indians, or occasionally were massacred by them; but in either case the Simpson house looked, to quote a Riverboro expression, \"as if the devil had been having an auction in it.\"  Next to this uncommonly interesting playground, as a field of action, came, in the children's opinion, the \"secret spot.\" There was a velvety stretch of ground in the Sawyer pasture which was full of fascinating hollows and hillocks, as well as verdant levels, on which to build houses. A group of trees concealed it somewhat from view and flung a grateful shade over the dwellings erected there. It had been hard though sweet labor to take armfuls of \"stickins\" and \"cutrounds\" from the mill to this secluded spot, and that it had been done mostly after supper in the dusk of the evenings gave it a still greater flavor. Here in soap boxes hidden among the trees were stored all their treasures: wee baskets and plates and cups made of burdock balls, bits of broken china for parties, dolls, soon to be outgrown, but serving well as characters in all sorts of romances enacted there,--deaths, funerals, weddings, christenings. A tall, square house of stickins was to be built round Rebecca this afternoon, and she was to be Charlotte Corday leaning against the bars of her prison.  It was a wonderful experience standing inside the building with Emma Jane's apron wound about her hair; wonderful to feel that when she leaned her head against the bars they seemed to turn to cold iron; that her eyes were no longer Rebecca Randall's but mirrored something of Charlotte Corday's hapless woe.  \"Ain't it lovely?\" sighed the humble twain, who had done most of the labor, but who generously admired the result.  \"I hate to have to take it down,\" said Alice, \"it's been such a sight of work.\"  \"If you think you could move up some stones and just take off the top rows, I could step out over,\" suggested Charlotte Corday. \"Then leave the stones, and you two can step down into the prison to-morrow and be the two little princes in the Tower, and I can murder you.\"  \"What princes? What tower?\" asked Alice and Emma Jane in one breath. \"Tell us about them.\"  \"Not now, it's my supper time.\" (Rebecca was a somewhat firm disciplinarian.)  \"It would be elergant being murdered by you,\" said Emma Jane loyally, \"though you are awful real when you murder; or we could have Elijah and Elisha for the princes.\"  \"They'd yell when they was murdered,\" objected Alice; \"you know how silly they are at plays, all except Clara Belle. Besides if we once show them this secret place, they'll play in it all the time, and perhaps they'd steal things, like their father.\"  \"They needn't steal just because their father does,\" argued Rebecca; \"and don't you ever talk about it before them if you want to be my secret, partic'lar friends. My mother tells me never to say hard things about people's own folks to their face. She says nobody can bear it, and it's wicked to shame them for what isn't their fault. Remember Minnie Smellie!\"  Well, they had no difficulty in recalling that dramatic episode, for it had occurred only a few days before; and a version of it that would have melted the stoniest heart had been presented to every girl in the village by Minnie Smellie herself, who, though it was Rebecca and not she who came off victorious in the bloody battle of words, nursed her resentment and intended to have revenge.    VII  RIVERBORO SECRETS  Mr. Simpson spent little time with his family, owing to certain awkward methods of horse-trading, or the \"swapping\" of farm implements and vehicles of various kinds,--operations in which his customers were never long suited. After every successful trade he generally passed a longer or shorter term in jail; for when a poor man without goods or chattels has the inveterate habit of swapping, it follows naturally that he must have something to swap; and having nothing of his own, it follows still more naturally that he must swap something"]]]
