Every facility     is offered in the city and adjacent country, in Hancock county,     for the successful prosecution of the mechanical arts, and the     pleasing pursuits of agriculture. The waters of the Mississippi     can be successfully used for manufacturing purposes, to an almost     unlimited extent.      \"Having been instrumental in the hands of our Heavenly Father     in laying a foundation for the gathering of Zion, we would say,     let all those who appreciate the blessings of the Gospel, and     realize the importance of obeying the commandments of heaven, who     have been blessed of heaven with the possession of this world's     goods, first prepare for the general gathering, let them dispose     of their effects as fast as circumstances will possibly admit,     without making too great sacrifice, and remove to our city and     county--establish and build up manufactories in the city, purchase     and cultivate farms in the county--this will secure our permanent     inheritance, and prepare the way for the gathering of the poor.     This is agreeable to the order of heaven, and the only principle on     which the gathering can be effected--let the rich, then, and all     who can assist in establishing this place, make every preparation     to come on without delay, and strengthen our hands, and assist in     promoting the happiness of the Saints. This cannot be too forcibly     impressed on the minds of all, and the elders are hereby instructed     to proclaim this word in all places where the Saints reside,     in their public administrations, for this is according to the     instructions we have received from the Lord.\"  Now, this shows that the Saints \"scattered abroad\" were commanded of the Lord to gather at Nauvoo and in Hancock county, Illinois. It will go without saying that all the faithful Latter-day Saints would take advantage of this commandment and therefore the faithful Saints, or the great majority of them would soon be located at Nauvoo. Again in this same volume, page 434, we find another proclamation to the Saints abroad, signed by President Joseph Smith, in which he says:      \"The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day     Saints, anxious to promote the prosperity of said Church, feel it     their duty to call upon the Saints who reside out of this county     to make preparations to come in, without delay. This is important     and should be attended to by all who feel an interest in the     prosperity of this the corner stone of Zion. Here the Temple must     be raised, the university be built, and other edifices erected     which are necessary for the great work of the last days; and which     can only be done by a concentration of energy and enterprise. Let     it therefore be understood, that all the stakes, excepting those     in this county and in Lee county, Iowa, are discontinued, and the     Saints instructed to settle in this county as soon as circumstances     will permit.\"  This was on May 24, 1841, and we find in the same volume, page 520, an epistle from the Twelve to the \"Saints scattered abroad,\" in which the following is found:      \"We say to all Saints who desire to do the will of heaven, arise,     and tarry not, but come up hither to the places of gathering as     speedily as possible, for the time is rapidly approaching when     the Saints will have occasion to regret that they have so long     neglected to assemble themselves together and stand in holy places     awaiting those tremendous events which are so rapidly approaching     the nations of the earth.      \"It will be recollected that in a recent communication from the     First Presidency, all places of gathering are discontinued,     excepting Hancock county, Ill., and Zarahemla in Lee county, I. T.,     opposite Nauvoo.\"  At the conference of the Church held in October, 1841, Almon W. Babbitt was disfellowshipped for persuading Saints who were emigrating to Nauvoo to remain and build up Kirtland, Ohio, as the minutes say, \"until such time as he shall make satisfaction.\" This shows how important this doctrine of gathering was. Therefore the great bulk of the Latter-day Saints, at the time of the martyrdom, were located at Nauvoo and its vicinity.  It is in order now to show that these Latter-day Saints sustained President Brigham Young and the Twelve.  On the 8th day of August, following the martyrdom, a special conference was held in Nauvoo at which time the claims of Sidney Rigdon and the rightful claim of the Twelve Apostles were presented for the vote of the Latter-day Saints. At this conference President Young, in addressing the Saints said:      \"I will ask you as quorums, Do you want Brother Rigdon to stand     forward as your leader, your guide, your spokesman? President     Rigdon wants me to bring up the other question first, and that is,     Does the Church want, and is it their only desire to sustain the     Twelve as the First Presidency of this people? * * * * All that are     in favor of this, in all the congregation of the Saints manifest     it by holding up the right hand. (There was a universal vote.) If     there are any of the contrary mind, every man and every woman who     does not want the Twelve to preside, lift up your hands in like     manner, (no hands up.) This supersedes the other question, and     trying it by quorums.\" (History of the Church, Aug. 8, 1844.)  Also at the general conference held the following October the Apostles were again unanimously sustained by the vote of the Church as the presiding quorum and Presidency of the Church. (Times and Seasons, 5:692). Mark you this was by the unanimous vote of the Saints.[2]  Now, in the exodus from Nauvoo these Saints--the great bulk of the Church, continued to be true and faithful and followed the Twelve Apostles.  Governor Thomas Ford, in his \"History of Illinois,\" states that in 1846 there were 16,000 Church members with the Twelve on the plains of Iowa, while the 1,000 that remained, a small remnant, were those who were unable to sell their property, or who having no property to sell, were unable to get away. (History of \"Reorganized\" Church iii:164). And this remnant followed as soon as they were able.  In the census report for 1850--three years after the settlement of Salt Lake valley, we learn that the population of Utah was 11,380, all Mormons. That same year the population of Pottawattomie county, Iowa, was 7,828, all Mormons, the Latter-day Saints at Kanesville. Thus we see that 19,208 members of the Church who had followed President Brigham Young in the exodus from Nauvoo, were located at these two places. And that is not all, there were other settlements of the Saints at Garden Grove, Mount Pisgah, St. Louis, and other places where temporary settlements for the Saints were formed during that exodus. These also later gathered to Utah. Thus we see that almost the entire membership of the Church as it stood in 1844, is accounted for in the following of President Brigham Young and the Twelve. That the Church was not threatened with dissolution the following statistics will show--I have not at hand the increase of membership of the Church during that period in the United States, but the increase in Great Britain is as follows: In the year 1844, the population of the Church in the British Isles was 7,797. Six years after the martyrdom--December, 1850--that membership had increased to 30,747. This does not show much of a dissolution or falling away.   WHO FORSOOK THE CHURCH?  I do not intend to convey the idea that there was not a falling away, an apostasy, at the time of the martyrdom and the exodus from Nauvoo, for there were many who forsook the cause, but compared with the Church membership, they were but few. Who were they? Did the faithful Saints forsake the Church at that time? Did those who risked their lives--who were shot with the Prophet and Patriarch forsake the Church? No! We do not find the faithful Latter-day Saints, who had the Gospel rooted in their hearts turning away. Then who were those who forsook the cause? I will tell you.  In the parable of the sower the Savior said:      \"Behold a sower went forth to sow; and when he sowed some seed fell     by the wayside, and the fowls came and devoured them up. Some fell     upon stony places where they had not much earth; and forthwith they     sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth; and when the sun     was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they     withered away.\"  In explaining this parable He said:      \"But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he     that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; yet hath he     not root in himself, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation     or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is     offended.\"  These were they who forsook the Church in the exodus from Nauvoo. Not the faithful who had been tried and proved and not found wanting, who had an abiding testimony of the truth. Now, let us see what Gen. Thomas L. Kane has to say on this subject. He visited Nauvoo about this time and also the camps of Israel. In the postscript to the second edition of his lecture on \"The Mormons\" he says, page 86:      \"The Mormons as I saw them, though a majority, were but a portion     of the Church as it flourished in Illinois. When the persecution     triumphed there, and no alternative remained for the steadfast in     the faith but the flight out of Egypt into the wilderness, as it     was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],["title","Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#2)"],["body","med, all their fair weather friends forsook them.\" * * * * *      \"So the Mormons have been as it were, broken and screened by     calamity. Their designing leaders have left them to seek after     fortunes elsewhere. Those that remain of the old stock are the     masses, always honest in the main and sincere even in delusion; and     their guides are a few tried and trusty men, little initiated in     the plotting of synagogues, and more noted for services rendered     than bounties received. They are the men whom I saw on the prairie     trail, sharing sorrow with the sorrowful, and poverty with the     poor; the chief of them all, a man of rare natural endowment, to     whose masterly guidance they are mainly indebted for their present     prosperity, driving his own ox team and carrying his sick child in     his arms.\"  We have the statement of Sidney Rigdon, one of those who forsook the cause. It is found in his Messenger and Advocate for June, 1846, pages 474-5, and a portion of his statement I will now read:      \"Their camp [that is the camp of the exiles, the pioneers] is in     the western part of Iowa, some 200 miles west of Nauvoo. Their     situation according to our informant, is as miserable as it well     could be. Their stock of provisions they took with them, is getting     fast reduced, so much so, that they can proceed no further; neither     can they go back. They are there without shelter, other than tents     and wagons, and their tents so indifferent that they will not shed     the rain, which has been incessantly falling since their arrival.     In this awful condition is to be found the aged and infirm, the     mother and tender infant. When our informant left, they were     going to fence in some 300 or 400 acres of land, for the purpose     of raising a crop of corn to try and preserve life. The remains     of their furniture, which in part consists of beds and bedding,     they are sending off to Missouri to exchange for corn and bacon to     sustain life. * * * * This said Young professed to be a follower     of Christ, and hold communion with Him, and to receive revelations     from Him; but where are his pretensions now? He has got, according     to our informant, some 800 or 1,000 people far into the wilds,     without food, without shelter, and himself being judge, without     object. * * * A state of wretchedness beyond this is not easily     conceived of. Our informant says when he left, which was some three     weeks since [and I may add that it is quite evident from this     account why he left] the mud, by reason of the incessant rains, was     six inches deep round their camp.\"  I suppose that there are some present this afternoon who realize the hardships through which the pioneers had to pass that tried men's souls and that only the faithful were able to endure.  I have now shown that the great majority of the Latter-day Saints followed President Brigham Young and were true to the Church. We get a good idea of the number who scattered from the testimony of William W. Blair.   FEW JOINED REORGANITES.  Of the members of the Church who were in fellowship in 1844-6, the \"Reorganized\" Church has received no more, and likely less than 1,000 converts, which fact shows that the apostasy was not so great in 1844-6 as has been stated by the Senator from Michigan and members of the \"Reorganization.\" This statement is based on the testimony of William W. Blair, one of the original members of the \"Reorganized\" Church, as he testified before the United States court of appeals for the Western district of Missouri, in 1894, in the temple lot suit, which was for the possession of property in the hands of the \"Church of Christ,\" or \"Hedrickites.\"  Before that court Mr. Blair, who was for many years a member of the presidency of the \"Reorganized\" Church, testified that \"1,000 was probably too high an estimate for the members of the original Church, that had joined the 'Reorganized' Church.\" He could \"approximately say,\" that 1,000 had joined the \"Reorganized\" Church, and \"possibly that estimate was too large.\" (Record pp. 180, 181).   ORIGIN OF \"REORGANIZED\" CHURCH.  We will now consider the origin of this \"Reorganized\" Church. Many people have been lead to believe that this society had its origin at the martyrdom, or immediately following the martyrdom. But this is not the fact. Properly it did not come into existence until 1860--16 years after the martyrdom, but the two men who were mainly responsible for the organization commenced their work in 1852-3. These men were Jason W. Briggs and Zenas H. Gurley. Perhaps a brief outline of their lives would be interesting.  Jason W. Briggs who was really the founder of the \"Reorganized\" Church, or, who perhaps did more than any other one man to bring about that sect, was born June 25, 1821, at Pompey, Onondaga county, N. Y. It is said he joined the Church at Potosi, Wis., about 1841, but most of the history of this man we get through the records of the \"reorganization.\" His home was at Beloit, Wis., from 1842 to 1854.[3] He remained with the Church under the leadership of President Young and the Twelve until the year 1846 (Reorg. Hist., 3:737). It is interesting to note in this regard that the exodus commenced February 4, 1846, so we are quite safe in saying that this man was one of \"the fair weather friends.\"  After the exodus he joined James J. Strang, and in his organization labored in the ministry quite extensively (Reorganite History 3; 737), filling short missions to various parts of New York and in Wisconsin.  In September of 1849, with B. G. Wright, he organized the Waukesha branch of Mr. Strang's church (Hist. Reorganized Church, 3; 737-8). Now, remember this was in September, 1849, and the organization of this branch was in the Strangite church. About this same time he also organized the Beloit branch for the same organization.[4]  In 1850 he left Mr. Strang's organization and joined with William Smith, who had himself been a follower of Mr. Strang until excommunicated from that organization. In William Smith's church Mr. Briggs accepted the position of \"apostle;\" but at the time of the disintegration of William Smith's church in 1851, he withdrew, and in 1852 joined with Zenas H. Gurley. These two men then organized what was called at the time the \"New Organization of the Church,\" but today known as the \"Reorganized\" Church.  In 1886, together with the family of Zenas H. Gurley,[5] Mr. Briggs withdrew from the \"Reorganization,\" which he had begotten. (Saints' Herald, 33; 248-9). His reasons for withdrawing we will consider later.  Zenas H. Gurley was more active in the Church previous to the martyrdom. He was ordained a Seventy in Nauvoo in 1844, and when the Twenty-first quorum of Seventy was organized, April 6, 1845, he was chosen as the senior president, he being the oldest of the presidents chosen. He was a native of New York state, born May 29, 1801, and was therefore 43 years of age in 1844.  We know something about this man's career between the martyrdom and the exodus from the minutes of this quorum of Seventy. And as this record contains some very interesting items I will read a few of them here. In the minutes of November 2, 1845, we read:      \"President Zenas H. Gurley apologized for his absence the two last     meetings. He then enlarged upon the subject (i. e., the subject     before the quorum). He said he had received the assurance of     an addition of power of the Priesthood upon every accession of     authority he had received. We ought to be the best men living in     consideration of our privileges as members of the Church of Jesus     Christ of Latter-day Saints, enlightened as it was with divine     revelation, He exhorted the brethren not to aspire but to rise upon     their own merits and to visit the poor in their afflictions.\"  In the minutes of November 9, we are informed that President Erastus H. Derby, one of the presidents of that quorum, said:      \"Brother Brigham advised and counseled the Saints to get ready for     emigration in May, 1846. If he (Derby) possessed the wealth of the     whole nation he would not stay behind the Church going into the     wilderness.\"  Immediately following these remarks, Zenas H. Gurley arose and said, as the minutes read, that \"He confirmed the same.\" That is, he too would rather forsake the wealth of the whole nation than fail to go with the Church into the wilderness. Then continuing his remarks, he said:      \"Small prototypes of great national events were given by command     of God, by the ancient prophets, and the like would probably     nowadays distinguish what God is about to do in the earth. * * *     Certain characters have been elected from before time to fulfill     certain purposes in the earth, called though they were from all     nations, tongues, and ranks. * * * The order of free masonry was     outrageously violated by the people of Hancock; but the pledges,     obligations and vows of the Latter-day Saints would, if adhered to,     exalt them to thrones dominions and power.\"  This was in relation to temple work. On the 21st of December, 1845, he said:      \"He remembered forcibly the sayings of the first presidents of     Seventy, that we should so live that no charge can be brought     against us. A few years ago the men in high standing in this     Church (the Twelve) were as little as we are. They obtained their     exaltation by patient submission to right, and minding their own     business. * * * There are many young men in this quorum able to     travel a great way. You will be called on to go, also to receive     your endowment. Keep always meek and a teachable spirit. The willow     always bends in the breeze and is also firm in the root. Though     many have gone out from the Church.\"--now remember this--\"YET     it increases as fast as ever and evinces to the world as great     affinity and identity to the eternal plan of Jehovah as"]]]
