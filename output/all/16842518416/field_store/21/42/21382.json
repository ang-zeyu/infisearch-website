He fled precipitately into the house and came out again--trembling more violently--with limes.  \"Never can train blacks properly,\" Graham grumbled, as he sliced a lime in half and squeezed it into his tumbler. \"Now, a Japanese servant is perfect.\"  He poured his gin and the seltzer fizzed into the glass. He lifted it to his lips and drained it.  \"Japan?\" I asked. \"I've never been there.\"  \"I have,\" said Graham morosely. \"Been everywhere. England, America, Japan, India. All rotten places.\"  \"No rottener than this,\" I said disgustedly. \"I had three weeks of fever up in the Kongo, with a Belgian Kongo Company agent after me the whole time. I'm still shaky from it. When I can go back to white man's country again----\"  I stopped. Graham was lighting a cigarette, and I noticed that the flame wavered as he held the match. There are some men who are cold sober up to a certain point, and then what they have drunk takes hold of them all at once. Graham was such a person. When he spoke again his words were slurred and sluggish.  \"White man's country,\" he repeated uncertainly, and then made an effort to speak clearly. \"I'm goin' back some day. Got dear old home, family servants, broad lawn--everything. Not mine though. Younger son. Had to win hearth an' saddle of m'own. Arthur's got it all, damn him. Always was lucky beggar. Got all family estates, all income, I got nothing. Then I liked girl. Second cousin. Arthur got her, or goin' to. Engaged. Damn lucky beggar. Always was lucky chap. Steady and dependable. Damn stodgy, I think. Told him so. Called him a ---- ---- an' he kicked me out. All because I got into trouble and signed his name to somethin', to get out.\"  \"Easy there, Graham,\" I warned. \"I don't want to hear anything, you know.\"  \"You better not,\" he said suddenly, in a clear voice. He turned beastlike eyes on me. \"If anybody tries to pry into my affairs, they don't get far.\"  I blew a cloud of smoke over the railing of the veranda and said nothing. Through the moonlit night the throbbing of the drums came clearly to us sitting there. They beat on steadily, monotonously, hypnotically. There was something strangely menacing in the rhythmic, pulsing rumble. The cries of night birds and insects, and occasionally an animal sound, seemed natural and normal, but the muttering of those drums with that indescribable hollow tone they possess, seemed to portend a strange event.  \"Juju,\" said Graham abruptly, \"is the key to the African mind. I don't give a damn for the natives. All I care about is what I can get out of this country, but I say that juju is the key to the African mind.\"  I smoked on a moment in silence. \"I'd rather not meddle with it,\" I remarked. \"Sooner or later it means ground glass in your coffee of a morning. Just before I left Ticao, Da Cunha found some in his. He shot his cook and then found it was another boy entirely.\"  \"I'd have whipped him to death with a _chiboka_,\" said Graham viciously.  \"That's what Da Cunha did,\" I informed him mildly. \"But the governor's made him leave Ticao for six months. He's over in Mozambique.\"  \"My boys'll never dare try to poison me,\" declared Graham. He leaned toward me in drunken confidence. \"They believe that if they did----\"  \"The procession has started again,\" I said, interrupting him. \"I hear the yelling.\"  It was so. The drums still beat monotonously and rhythmically, but beneath their deep bass muttering, a faint, high, continuous sound could be heard. The procession seemed to be making its way back to the village.  \"I'm goin' to bed,\" announced Graham sharply. \"You go t' bed too. Don't sit out here an' smoke. Go to bed.\"  He stood up and waited for me to enter the house. Puzzled, and rather annoyed, I went inside. I heard Graham walk heavily and uncertainly through to the rear and heard him speak to several of the servants. The contrast between his rasping, harsh tones and the frightened voices of his servants was complete. They were very evidently in deadly fear of him.  The sound of the procession grew louder and louder. Something about it perplexed me for a moment, but then I realized that it was not making direct for the village. It was coming toward the house. I frowned a moment, and looked to make sure that my automatic was handy and in proper working order.  The procession was very near. I looked out of the window and saw the twinkling lights of the torches through the bush. The drums were thunderous now, but the beat was not the war beat. It was purely ceremonial. The yelling was high-pitched and continuous.  The head of the procession emerged from the bush and advanced across the clearing about the house. It swung and headed for the rear of the house, and the long line of capering, torch-bearing humanity followed it.  The witch doctor came into view, and the girl. Her panic had reached its pitch now. I have never seen such ultimate fear as was expressed on that girl's face, outlined by the flickering light of the torches. The procession moved until the end had passed beyond the rear corner of the casa, then turned, and evidently turned again.  I saw it moving back toward the village. A pregnant fact impressed me. The native girl was missing. She had evidently been left behind somewhere about the rear of the house. The yelling mass of black humanity capered and shrilled its way down the cleared way to the village and gathered in front of the juju house.  Then some dance or ceremony seemed to begin. What it was, I do not know. I was very tired and presently I went to sleep. But the drums beat steadily, all night long. They entered the fabric of my dreams and made my rest uneasy. It could not have been long before morning when I awoke with a start and found myself sitting up with every nerve tense. There was no sound, but I had a feeling as if I had been awakened by a scream, somewhere about the house.     CHAPTER II.  THE SEEKER OF VENGEANCE.   The consul listened gravely while I told him about it. He had asked me to give all the information I could about Graham. We were on the porch of the consulate and the whole city of Ticao was spread out before us. The sea pounded restlessly against the low bluffs upon which the city was built, and surged angrily about the peninsula on which the fort is situated.  \"I woke in the middle of the night,\" I concluded, \"feeling that there had been a scream somewhere in the house, but not another sound came. I couldn't get to sleep again, and in the morning I noticed that the girl who had seemed to be the center of interest in the juju procession had been installed as a servant at the house. Another one of the servants had vanished. The new girl looked pitifully scared, perpetually panic-stricken, though the rest of the servants look frightened enough, in all conscience. That's all I know.\"  The consul tugged thoughtfully at his mustache.  \"Now why----\" he began, and stopped. \"The mail boat dropped two Englishwomen here on her last trip, a Mrs. Braymore and a Miss Dalforth. Charming women, both of them. They are calling on the governor's wife this afternoon. They came to me and asked me to assist them in getting up to Graham's plantation. They told me he was Miss Dalforth's cousin.\"  I nodded, frowning. \"He said that his cousin--second cousin--would possibly turn up. His brother is up in the Kongo somewhere trying to bag gorillas and is going to come from there on through and stop at his place. Miss Dalforth is probably the second cousin and is engaged to the brother who is hunting.\"  \"Hm.\" The consul looked somewhat relieved. \"I see. But why on earth should two women want to go up there? Do you think they'd be safe?\"  \"I don't know,\" I said dubiously. \"There's no fort anywhere near, and the natives are scared stiff. They might bolt, but Graham seems to have them thoroughly in hand. If the ladies once reached the plantation, they'd probably be safe enough, and Graham's brother could bring them down to the coast again. The plantation is a queer place, though. I think there's juju in the air. I'd discourage them from going, if I could.\"  \"I've tried,\" said the consul. \"I've informed them what sort the Portuguese traders are, and told them I simply wouldn't let them go up alone, or with one of those chaps as escort. I didn't know anything about Graham. They inquired around for an escort, and one of the missionaries mentioned you.\"  \"As a respectable person?\" I asked with a smile.  The consul nodded, matching my smile. \"They have quite decided that you are to escort them to Graham's plantation. I don't think you'll refuse,\" he added, when I shook my head. \"Miss Dalforth impressed me as a young woman accustomed to having her way. She saw the governor and smiled at him, and he agreed that you would be the best possible person. In fact, he said he would ask you himself.\"  \"I'm not leaving for a month,\" I told him. \"I've had enough of the back country for at least that long, and my carriers need a rest.\"  \"We'll see,\" said the consul ruefully. \"I'll wager she has you setting out in a week.\"  He was nearly right at that. I was introduced to the two of them, and Miss Dalforth was all that he had said. I had to give my bearers a rest, however, and it was two weeks before we set out.  It was a hindrance, having women with me. They traveled in an ox cart, and at nearly every stream the wheels had to be taken off and a tarpaulin fixed about the body of the wagon to make it into a raftlike float, in which they were ferried across. Had Miss Dalforth--or Alicia, as I heard Mrs. Braymore call her--had Alicia been less charming, or less anxious to cause as little trouble as possible, I would have cursed them nearly the entire time. As it was, I bore the delays with equanimity.  They were delighted the first day when we went up the trail to Venghela. I showed them the street lamp at which the great slave trail from the interior"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50719"],["title","Juju (#2)"],["body",", and they looked dubious. When I showed them the Padre Silvestre's mission, with its three villages of redeemed slaves, they grew a little bit white and quiet.  The padre tried to persuade them not to go on, but as luck would have it, a runner came in on his way to Ticao with a message from Graham. His brother had arrived from the interior. That strengthened their resolution. We continued the journey.  While on the trail I could not speak to them, being busily engaged in the supervision of my caravan. At night, however, we conversed. It was good to hear cultivated white women talk again and talk about something besides the slave traffic, the missionary women's sole topic when they find a listener who can be trusted not to repeat their views to the governor.  The natives are kidnaped or captured far in the interior, brought down to the coast, and frankly sold. Then they are interviewed and, after making a mark upon a bit of printed paper, are considered to have made a contract to serve a white man for four years at one milreis--about a dollar--a month.  To call it slave traffic is highly insulting to the Portuguese, but to call it the _servaçal_ system is inadequate. They are _servaçaes_, or _contrahidos_, which means contract laborers, in theory, but in practice they are slaves. They never see their native villages again. The slave trail from the interior is littered with the manacles used to confine them, and there are gruesome relics all along the way, of those natives who were unable to bear the hardships of the journey.  I told them of these things. I told them of how the Padre Silvestre sacrificed his very soul to keep his villagers from being sold again as _servaçaes_, how the blacks rose on Da Vega's plantation and sacked it, and all I knew of the whole disgusting system. I had no intention of making myself a hero--and my conscience still hurts me when I think of some of the things I grew absolutely accustomed to--but I did allow myself to show my feelings on the subject of Portuguese government.  Alicia listened, and one night when I had explained to them precisely what it means for a black to be sent to the island of San Felipe or Gomé, she held out her hand to me very gravely.  \"I think it is very brave of you,\" she said, \"to stay here and do what you can to help the poor blacks.\"  I stared at her, tempted to laugh. \"My dear young lady,\" I told her, \"I am an outlaw, practically, who trades with the Kongo natives and attempts to elude the Belgian officials as much as possible. I'm tolerated here in Ticao because I bribe the Portuguese. I'm no hero. To the Belgians I am practically what an I. D. B. is in the Transvaal. And you know what an illicit diamond buyer is considered.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" she said firmly. \"I think you stay here to help the poor natives.\"  She was so beautifully sincere in attributing the noblest motives to me that I could not laugh at her. Her blessed incomprehension made me forbear to kick Mboka, who is my official gun bearer and lieutenant, when he lost the bolt of my best rifle and threw away the weapon to conceal his misdoing. I had to kick him twice over the day following for the lapse, when he took advantage of my lenience and stole half of my jam.  She was a charming girl. Mrs. Braymore was suffering in the journeying and stoically relapsed into silence to conceal her emotion, but Alicia was perpetually lively and eager for new things of interest.  She soon grew to adopt a tone of frank friendliness with me, and I had to remind myself more than once that she was engaged to Graham's brother, and that it would not do for me to fall in love with her. It was odd about her engagement, though. She spoke of her fiancé quite simply, but without any excess of affection. In fact, she confessed that she thought of him more as a brother than anything else. All three of them, Graham, his brother and Alicia, had been raised together and were very much like brothers and sister.  I told myself sternly that, no matter how she felt about her fiancé, she was engaged to him, and I had better forget that she was delightful to look upon and an amazingly good companion. I could not manage it, however, and the last week of the trip was not easy for me. I had to be friendly and no more.  In a way I was very glad when we saw two khaki sun helmets coming toward us, though I was much depressed at the thought of parting from Alicia. I had sent a runner on ahead, and Graham and his brother met us some four miles down the trail. I was pleasantly surprised at the sight of Graham's brother. Years before he had been at a little English seaside resort where I was spending the summer and we had grown very friendly. He kissed Alicia in a brotherly fashion and shook hands with me.  \"I perpetrate a bromide,\" he said quizzically. \"The world is a small place.\"  \"Arthur Graham!\" I exclaimed. \"I knew you in Clovelly six years ago.\"  \"You're right,\" he said cheerfully. \"How are you now? Then you were flirting mildly with a buxom Devon lassie.\"  \"And now we meet in darkest Africa,\" I said, smiling. \"Let's move on.\"  We went forward again, Alicia, in the ox cart, gayly retailing to the two brothers our adventures on the trip up. I was rather surprised to notice that both of them were heavily armed, and it bothered me a little. It looked as if there were trouble with the natives. Each of the two brothers carried a heavy repeating rifle besides an automatic pistol in his belt, and Arthur looked decidedly worn, though I saw that he was trying to conceal it from Alicia.  My suspicion was confirmed when I observed that, though he tried not to let Alicia see it, he was keenly searching the way ahead of us with his eyes. He seemed particularly worried when we passed near a tree and his grasp on his rifle tightened. Even after we were well away from it, he looked back nervously.  We passed around the village and reached the casa by another route, Alicia chatting cheerfully with all of us from her seat in the cart. Evan Graham seemed quite at ease and entered into her talk with real interest, but Arthur--who as her fiancé should have been overjoyed to see her--was nervous and preoccupied. His rifle was never far from a position in readiness to fling it to his shoulder, and his eyes roved restlessly about with a species of dread in them. I walked close to him.  \"Arthur,\" I said in a low tone that Alicia would not catch. \"You're nervous. Natives?\"  \"They're acting queerly, but it's worse than that,\" he said in the same low tone, glancing at Alicia to make sure her attention was elsewhere. \"I'd give anything I possess to have Alicia somewhere else. I'll tell you later. Just keep your eyes open and, if you see anything, shoot quickly.\"  Evan did not seem to be worried. He was strolling leisurely along, using his rifle as a walking stick, talking casually to Alicia. His manners were very good and his voice was soft, very unlike the rasping snarl I had heard him use to his servants. Looking closely at him, I could see unmistakable signs that he had been drinking heavily of late. He seemed quite sober to-day, though. The contrast between his careless attitude and Arthur's worried air was striking. We saw one or two natives on our way to the house, and they promptly hid themselves in the bush. Arthur paid no attention to them. Whatever the trouble might be, it was not the blacks that he feared, though he had said they were acting queerly.  He led me aside almost as soon as we reached the casa. I told Mboka to pile and count the loads, and sent the carriers to the quarters they would find ready for them. Evan was inside the house, installing Alicia and Mrs. Braymore in their rooms, and showing them the servants who would wait on them. Arthur came over to me with a worried frown.  \"I say, Murray,\" he told me nervously. \"I'd ask you to take Alicia back to the coast to-morrow if I dared, but she's here now, and it would be just as dangerous for her to go back.\"  \"What's the matter?\" I demanded. \"It isn't the natives. What _is_ the matter?\"  He looked about anxiously. \"I shot a female gorilla up in the Kongo,\" he said jerkily, \"and her mate got away. He's followed my caravan ever since, up to two weeks ago. Then I hit him with a lucky shot, but he escaped. You know they will try to kill the slayer of their mate.\"  \"I know,\" I replied. \"One of them followed me for three weeks once, until I bushwhacked and killed him.\"  \"I shot this female,\" said Arthur quickly. \"I shot her through the hip and she screamed for her mate. She couldn't get away. He came crashing through the trees, and I fired at him. I thought he'd vanished and went up to the female. I finished her off, and then the male came for me. I shot him through the arm and he made off. All that night he moaned and shrieked around my camp. My boys were badly frightened. Next morning he dropped from a tree inside the camp, knocked the heads of two of my carriers together, and crushed in their skulls. I rushed out with a gun and he disappeared. Three days later he dropped straight out of a tree almost over my head and made for me. One of my boys was cleaning a spear, directly in the path of the gorilla. He tried to run the beast through, but it stopped long enough to break his neck and by that time I'd got a gun. The gorilla disappeared again. From that time on it haunted me. If one or two of my boys strayed from the camp, they didn't come back. The beast has killed six of my best carriers and my gun bearer. And I never got a fair shot at it! I fired at it two weeks ago and I found blood where it had been, but no sign of the beast itself. Since then I've been left in peace.\"  \"The animal may have dropped the trail, or it may be dead,\" I commented thoughtfully, \"but I don't blame you for wanting to be careful.\"  \"The thought of that huge ape perhaps lurking outside, perhaps about to drop down at any moment, with Alicia here,\" said Arthur desperately, \"it's enough to drive a man"]]]
