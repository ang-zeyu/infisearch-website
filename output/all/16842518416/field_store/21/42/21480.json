She says; \"Thus died my martyred mother.\"  Sister Zina was married in Nauvoo, and had two sons, but this not proving a happy union, she subsequently separated from her husband. Joseph Smith taught her the principle of marriage for eternity, and she accepted it as a divine revelation, and was sealed to the Prophet for time and eternity, after the order of the new and everlasting Covenant.  Sister Zina was a member of the first organization of the Relief Society at Nauvoo, and when the Temple was ready for the ordinances to be performed, received there her blessings and endowments. After the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph and Hyrum, she was united in marriage for time to Brigham Young, and with the Saints left Nauvoo in the month of February, crossing the Mississippi on the ice. Arriving at Mt. Pisgah, a resting place for the exiles, Father Huntington was called to preside and Zina D., with her two little boys remained with him temporarily. Sickness visited the camp, and deaths were so frequent that help could not be obtained to make coffins. Many were buried with split logs at the bottom of the grave and brush at the sides, that being all that could be done by mourning friends. Her father was taken sick, in eighteen days he died. After these days of trial she went to Winter Quarters, and was welcomed into the family of Brigham Young. With them, she in May 1848, began the journey to this valley, walking, driving team, cooking beside camp-fires, and in September arrived here, living in tents and wagons until log houses could be built. Here, April 3rd, 1850, was born Zina, daughter of Brigham Young and Zina D. Young.  When the Relief Society was reorganized in Utah by President Brigham Young, Sister Zina was one of the first identified with that work, as Treasurer, and when Sister Eliza was called to preside over all the Relief Societies, she chose Zina as her Counselor.  One of the most useful fields of her labor, has been sericulture. She has raised cocoons, attending to them with her own hands, and had charge of a large cocoonery and mulberry orchard belonging to President Young. When the Silk Association was organized, June 15th, 1876, she was chosen President. Great good was accomplished, mulberry trees were planted and cocoons raised in every part of the Territory where the climate would permit. A good article of silk was manufactured with home machinery.\" Sister Zina also took a course of medical studies, being perhaps the first to adopt the wish of President Young, for as many of the sisters as would be useful for the practice in the many settlements, among their own sex; to qualify themselves. Ladies came from different settlements, stimulated by her example. \"In all departments of woman's labor for the public good, Sister Zina had been found at her post doing her share of active work in the best manner possible. She has traveled among the different settlements visiting organized societies, or assisting Sister Eliza or the local authorities in organizing. \"At a Mass Meeting of ladies held in this city, November 16th, 1878, Sister Zina delivered a very eloquent impromptu address.\" I was one of the reporters on that occasion, and noting the increasing earnestness in her voice and words, raised my eyes to her standing just before the table we were using. Suddenly, as though her words struck home like an electric shock, several gentlemen sitting at my right hand, clutching the arms of their chairs, started as though they would rise to their feet; their faces burning with the truths they heard, their eyes fixed upon her fearless face and uplifted hands. I can never forget that moment. It was more than eloquence, it was inspiration. I will quote that portion of her address.  \"The principle of our religion that is assailed is one that lies deep in my heart. Could I ask the heavens to listen; could I beseech the earth to be still, and the brave men who possess the spirit of a Washington to hear what I am about to say. I am the daughter of a Master Mason! I am the widow of a Master Mason, who, when leaping from the window of Carthage Jail pierced with bullets, made the Masonic sign of distress; but, gentlemen, (addressing the representatives of the press that were present) those signs were not heeded except by the God of heaven. That man, the Prophet of the Almighty, was massacred without mercy! Sisters, this is the first time in my life that I have dared to give utterance to this fact, but I thought I could trust my soul to say it on this occasion; and I say it now in the fear of Israel's God, and I say it in the presence of these gentlemen and I wish my voice could be heard by the whole brotherhood of Masons throughout our proud land. That institution I honor. If its principles were practiced and strictly adhered to would there be a trespass upon virtue? No indeed. Would the honorable wife or daughter be intruded upon with impunity? Nay, verily. Would that the ladies of America, with the honorable Mrs. Hayes at their head; would that the Congress of the United States, the law makers of our nation, could produce a balm for the many evils which exist in our land through the abuse of virtue, or could so legislate that virtue could be protected and cherished as the life which heaven has given us. We in common with many women throughout our broad land would hail with joy the approach of such deliverance, for such is the deliverance that woman needs. The principle of plural marriage is honorable; it is a principle of the Gods, it is heaven born. God revealed it to us as a saving principle; we have accepted it as such, and we know it is of him for the fruits of it are holy. Even the Saviour, Himself, traces his lineage back to polygamic parents. We are proud of the principle because we know its true worth, and we want our children to practice it, that through us a race of men and women may grow up possessing sound minds in sound bodies, who shall live to the age of a tree.\" \"During the summer of 1879, Sister Zina decided to take a trip to the Sandwich Islands for her health, and was accompanied by Miss Susa Young. She had the opportunity of meeting many persons of note to whom she imparted correct information regarding our people; distributing tracts and books. Great respect was paid her and many ovations. She assisted the native members of our church in getting an organ for their meetings, and contributed liberally for other benevolent purposes.\" \"On her return she spent most of her time attending meetings of the various organizations. Sericulture was not forgotten or neglected. She also continued her labors in the House of the Lord. In the fall of 1880, Sisters Zina and Eliza went to St. George, to labor in the Temple, and visit the organizations of the women and children, wherever practicable. They held meetings by the way, often camped out over night, and traveled thus over one thousand miles. Returning March 31st, 1881, they were met at the depot by a party of thirty ladies, in carriages, who escorted them to the Lion House where a reception of welcome home awaited them.  August 20th, 1881, Sister Zina, accompanied by her foster son, Lieut. Willard Young, started for New York to gather up the records of her relatives. Dr. E. B. Ferguson was going to pursue her medical studies further in some branches, to be of greater service among the people. Previous to their going, they were blest and set apart by the First Presidency of the Church, to speak upon the principles of our faith if opportunity presented.  Sister Zina was cordially received by her relatives, and invited to speak in Sunday School and Temperance Meetings. Visited New York City, and listened to many celebrated divines. Attended the Woman's Congress at Buffalo, N. Y., but was refused five minutes to represent the women of Utah. Visited Watertown, N. Y., then to Vermont, and thence to Albany Co., and spoke in several meetings. Sister Zina returned to New York to attend the N. W. S. A. Convention, without opportunity of addressing them. She however assisted the brethren in organizing a Relief Society in New York. With Lieut. Willard Young she visited West Point. Mrs. Young returned to this city March 7th, received by her daughters and many friends, the return being the occasion for a most delightful party. On the Friday following, the Relief Society Conference convened, and her many friends had the opportunity of welcoming her home.  Picture and words are alike powerless to convey the beauty of her face, her spirit and her life. Each succeeding year adds a tenderer line to her face, a sweeter, gentler intonation to her voice, a more perceptible power to her spirit from the celestial fountains of faith; widens the circle of her friends, strengthens and deepens their love for her, and brings a richer harvest of noble labors to her name. Could I say more? I could not say less of her who has for eighteen years been my most intimate friend, my counselor, my second mother. A mother, not to me alone, to her belongs in its sweetest, widest sense, the name--a \"mother in Israel.\"    MARY ISABELLA HORNE,  TREASURER OF THE PRESIDING BOARD OF THE L. D. S. WOMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS.  \"I was born November 20th, 1818, in the town of Rainshaw, County of Kent, England. I am the daughter of Stephen and Mary Ann Hales, and the eldest daughter of a large family. My parents were honest, industrious people. I was taught to pray when very young, to be honest and truthful, to be kind to my associates, and to do good to all around us. My early years were spent in attending school and in assisting my mother in domestic duties.\"  \"Mrs. Horne's father was a Methodist, and her mother a member of the Church of England. Mrs. Horne as a child, had very strong religious tendencies, and when requested"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50958"],["title","Representative Women of Deseret: A Book of Biographical Sketches (#4)"],["body"," her Sabbath School teacher to commit to memory two or three verses from the Bible, she would learn a whole chapter or perhaps two, and recite without being prompted.  \"When only in her eleventh year, she became so fascinated with the Bible that her leisure hours after the labors of the day were over, were employed in reading and studying the history and incidents, the sublime parables and teachings contained in that sacred work; thus prepared to receive in due time the Gospel of the new and last dispensation. In 1832, Mrs. Horne's parents decided to emigrate, and concluded to go to upper Canada. April 6th, they left England with a family of five sons and two daughters.  \"One little boy died upon the way. On the 16th of June, they arrived in York, strangers in a strange land, where the cholera was making fearful ravages, but the Lord preserved them all in health. The following spring, 1833, the family removed to the country, about eight miles from York. Mrs. Hales' health was delicate and the care of the whole family devolved upon Mary Isabella, only fifteen years of age.  \"In the spring of 1834, she attended a Methodist camp meeting in the neighborhoood, where she first met Mr. Joseph Horne, and two years afterward, Joseph Horne and Mary Isabella were united in marriage on the 9th of May, 1836.\"  Only about one month of their wedded life had passed when they heard a rumor that a man professing to be sent of God, to preach to the people would hold a meeting about a mile distant.  Mr. and Mrs. Horne attended this meeting and there they first heard the Gospel, proclaimed by Elder Orson Pratt, but little knew how the course of their life would be changed by receiving this great light. Mrs. Horne was baptized in July, 1836, by Elder Orson Hyde, and ever after her house was a home for the elders, and a place where meetings were held. In the latter part of the summer of 1837, she first saw the Prophet Joseph, also Sidney Rigdon and Thomas B. Marsh.\" She says: \"On shaking hands with the Prophet Joseph Smith, I received the holy spirit in such great abundance that I felt it thrill my whole system from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet. I had never beheld so lovely a countenance, nobility and goodness were in every feature. I said to myself, 'O Lord, I thank thee for granting the desire of my girlish heart in permitting me to associate with prophets and apostles.'\" \"In March 1838, while the weather was still wintry, Mr. and Mrs. Horne bade farewell to their home, and with a few saints started for the gathering-place of the people of God.  \"At Huntsville, Mrs. Horne was introduced to Father and Mother Smith; Father Smith was the Patriarch of the church, and under his hands she received a patriarchal blessing. In August, with a babe less than a month old, they removed to Far West, and were obliged to go into a log house without doors or windows. It was about this time that the excitement in Missouri raged, and persecution was at its height. Mrs. Horne was alone much night and day, her husband being on guard. In the spring of 1839, Mrs. Horne and family left Missouri as exiles, and sought an asylum in Quincy, Ill., where for awhile they had peace. While in Quincy, Mrs. Horne was one of those favored ones who had the privilege of entertaining and waiting upon the Prophet Joseph and Hyrum, the Patriarch. In the month of March, Mr. and Mrs. Horne moved to Nauvoo by wagon, over the then wild prairies. They lived in a lumber shanty for eight months, and in November Mr. Horne moved his family into his own house, still unfinished. Here in 'Nauvoo the beautiful,' Mr. Horne through diligent labor at last succeeded in establishing a flourishing business and his family were looked upon by the Saints as quite well situated. On the 2nd of April, 1844, Mrs. Horne received a patriarchal blessing under the hands of Hyrum Smith, the patriarch of the Church.\" On the 27th of the June following, occurred the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum. Mrs. Horne says, \"On the 28th day of June, I took my last look on earth of Joseph and Hyrum Smith! May I never experience another day similar to that. I do not wish to recall the scene.\" On the 9th of July was born her fifth son. In January, 1846, Mrs. Horne went into the Nauvoo Temple, receiving the ordinances of the House of the Lord, and assisted in administering to others. In February Mr. Horne closed his business and bade adieu to their home and camped with the Saints on Sugar Creek, Iowa.  In March moved on to Garden Grove, and then to Mt. Pisgah. Here, Mrs. Horne had born to her a daughter, born in a wagon. When the babe was three days old, Mrs. Horne started again on her way, arriving at Council Bluffs about the last of June, moving into a log cabin. Here she was so sick it was feared she would not recover. Elder Orson Pratt administered to her and prophesied she would do a good work in Israel. In June of the same year, she left with the first company across the plains that followed the pioneers to the valley of Salt Lake. That was indeed a remarkable journey and all those who traveled hither at that time deserve the title of pioneers. They opened the way and braved the perils of the desert and the experience of living in this sterile land. They ploughed and planted and fought against the fearful odds of crickets, grasshoppers and death. The company in which Mrs. Horne traveled, arrived here October 6th, 1847, and as soon as the Fort was completed she moved into it, and lived in a log cabin two years, enduring all the exigencies incident to the settling of a new Indian country, among which were living on short rations, a part of which was roots and thistles. On the 16th of January, 1849, another daughter was added to the family. As soon as possible after arriving in a new and destitute country, Mr. and Mrs. Horne made themselves a home in the Fourteenth Ward, which they still retain. \"In speaking of her first knowledge of the order of celestial marriage, she says, she has had strong testimony for herself that it is of God. Mrs. Horne has borne herself nobly in all the different phases of plural domestic relations.\" Mrs. Horne was a member of the Relief Society in Nauvoo, and in the first organization of the Fourteenth Ward in this city, was a counselor to President Phoebe W. Woodruff.  In May, 1858, Mrs. Horne moved as far south as Parowan, her husband being called on a mission still further south, in \"Dixie.\" Against every disadvantage, Mrs. Horne performed this journey of two hundred and fifty miles, this mother with her ten children, the youngest a babe of six months. In September their mission was fulfilled and Mrs. Horne returned home, Mr. Horne returning from his mission soon after. December 12th, 1867, Mrs. Horne was chosen by Bishop A. Hoagland, of the Fourteenth Ward, to preside over the Relief Society in that ward. It was a great surprise to her, she was at that time very timid.  Under the wise management of the President, the society increased in numbers, great good was accomplished in the relief of the poor and afflicted, and means multiplied in the Treasury. A two story brick building has been erected by the society, part of which is rented for a store, and the upper story used for meetings. The society also own a good granary and a quantity of wheat. Mrs. Horne's success as a leader was so apparent and her course so consistent, President Young had such confidence in her, he gave her a very important mission among the sisters; this was called Retrenchment. In due time a meeting was held in the Fifteenth Ward Schoolhouse, and from there adjourned to the Fourteenth Ward Assembly Rooms, and from that time until the present, Mrs. Horne has presided at these regular semi-monthly meetings of the Ladies' General Retrenchment Associations. When President Young instructed Sister Eliza to go through the Territory and organize the young ladies into associations for mutual improvement, Mrs. Horne was called to assist. She has organized many of the Young Ladies Associations, also Primary Associations. At the time of the passage of the Cullom Bill in January, 1876, a grand Mass Meeting was called to convene in the Old Tabernacle, Salt Lake City. Mrs. Horne took an active part in the proceedings, being one of the committee to draft resolutions. In February following, the bill was passed, granting suffrage to the women of Utah. Mrs. Horne was one of a committee of ladies who waited upon Governor S. A. Mann to express the gratitude of Mormon women for his signing of the document. December 1877, Mrs. Horne was chosen to preside over the Relief Societies of this stake of Zion. She was elected a delegate from Salt Lake County, to the Territorial Convention held in this city, commencing October 9th, and was called upon to address them. Mrs. Horne was one of the committee appointed to wait upon the delegate nominated at the Convention, and inform him of the honor conferred upon him.  When Mrs. Horne was sixty years of age, upon the demise of her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lydia Weiler Horne, she took the babe six weeks old to raise. This after rearing a family, and seeing each take honored places in the world.  Mrs. Horne has been an officer and worker in the silk industry from the beginning. At the organization of the board of officers for the Deseret Hospital, May 1882, Mrs. Horne was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee.  November 20th, 1882, was the forty-sixth anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. Horne's wedding day. At the reception they held, an elegant photograph album was presented from lady friends, each of whom was to contribute her picture. Congratulations from children, Mayor Jennings and Judge Miner, with loving and sincere good wishes from all, for the future, made this a day long to be remembered.\"  I am indebted to the pen of Emmeline B.
