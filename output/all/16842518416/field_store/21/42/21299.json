There was never any telling, with FitzMaugham. The old man had been terribly devious in every maneuver he made.  The room had the dry, crisp smell of the detecting devices that had been used--the close-to-the-ground, ugly metering-robots that had crawled all over the floor, sniffing up footprints and stray dandruff flakes for analysis, the chemical cleansers that had mopped the blood out of the rug. Walton cursed at the air-conditioner that was so inefficiently removing these smells from the air.  The annunciator chimed. Walton waited impatiently for a voice, then remembered that FitzMaugham had doggedly required an acknowledgment. He opened the channel and said, \"This is Walton. In the future no acknowledgment will be necessary.\"  \"Yes, sir. There's a reporter from _Citizen_ here, and one from Globe Telefax.\"  \"Tell them I'm not seeing anyone today. Here, I'll give them a statement. Tell them the Gargantuan task of picking up the reins where the late, great Director FitzMaugham dropped them is one that will require my full energy for the next several days. I'll be happy to hold my first official press conference as soon as Popeek is once again moving on an even keel. Got that?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Good. Make sure they print it. And--oh, listen. If anyone shows up today or tomorrow who had an appointment with Director FitzMaugham, tell him approximately the same thing. Not in those flowery words, of course, but give him the gist of it. I've got a lot of catching up to do before I can see people.\"  \"Certainly, Director Walton.\"  He grinned at the sound of those words, _Director Walton_. Turning away from the annunciator, he took out his agenda and checked off number one, _Cancel FitzMaugham's appointments_.  Frowning, he realized he had better add a seventh item to the list: _Appoint new assistant administrator_. Someone would have to handle his old job.  But now, top priority went to the item ticketed zero on the list: _Finish Prior affair_. He'd never be in a better position to erase the evidence of yesterday's illegality than he was right now.  \"Connect me with euthanasia files, please.\"  A moment later a dry voice said, \"Files.\"  \"Files, this is Acting Director Walton. I'd like a complete transcript of your computer's activities for yesterday morning between 0900 and 1200, with each separate activity itemized. How soon can I have it?\"  \"Within minutes, Director Walton.\"  \"Good. Send it sealed, by closed circuit. There's some top-level stuff on that transcript. If the seal's not intact when it gets here, I'll shake up the whole department.\"  \"Yes, sir. Anything else, sir?\"  \"No, that'll be--on second thought, yes. Send up a list of all doctors who were examining babies in the clinic yesterday morning.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He waited. While he waited, he went through the top layer of memoranda in FitzMaugham's desk.  There was a note on top which read, _Appointment with Lamarre, 11 June--1215. Must be firm with him, and must handle with great delicacy. Perhaps time to let Walton know._  Hmm, that was interesting, Walton thought. He had no idea who Lamarre might be, but FitzMaugham had drawn a spidery little star in the upper-right-hand corner of the memo sheet, indicating crash priority.  He flipped on the annunciator. \"There's a Mr. Lamarre who had an appointment with Director FitzMaugham for 1215 today. If he calls, tell him I can't see him today but will honor the appointment tomorrow at the same time. If he shows up, tell him the same thing.\"  His watch said it was time to dispose of another fragment of Fred's message. He stuffed it into the disposal chute.  A moment later the green light flashed over the arrival bin; FitzMaugham had not been subject, as Walton had been in his previous office, to cascades of material arriving without warning.  Walton drew a sealed packet from the bin. He examined the seal and found it untampered, which was good; it meant the packet had come straight from the computer, and had not even been read by the technician in charge. With it was a typed list of five names--the doctors who had been in the lab the day before.  Breaking open the packet, Walton discovered seven closely-typed sheets with a series of itemized actions on them. He ran through them quickly, discarding sheets one, two, and three, which dealt with routine activities of the computer in the early hours of the previous day.  Item seventy-three was his request for Philip Prior's record card. He checked that one off.  Item seventy-four was his requisition for the key to the clinic's gene-sorting code.  Item seventy-five was his revision of Philip Prior's records, omitting all reference to his tubercular condition and to the euthanasia recommendation. Item seventy-six was the acknowledgment of this revision.  Item seventy-seven was his request for the boy's record card--this time, the amended one. The five items were dated and timed; the earliest was 1025, the latest 1037, all on June tenth.  Walton bracketed the five items thoughtfully, and scanned the rest of the page. Nothing of interest there, just more routine business. But item ninety-two, timed at 1102, was an intriguing one:  _92: Full transcript of morning's transactions issued at request of Dr. Frederic Walton, 932K104AZ._  Fred hadn't been bluffing, then; he actually had possession of all the damning evidence. But when one dealt with a computer and with Donnerson micro-memory-tubes, the past was an extremely fluid entity.  \"I want a direct line to the computer on floor twenty,\" he said.  After a brief lag a technician appeared on the screen. It was the same one he had spoken to earlier.  \"There's been an error in the records,\" Walton said. \"An error I wouldn't want to perpetuate. Will you set me up so I can feed a direct order into the machine?\"  \"Certainly, sir. Go ahead, sir.\"  \"This is top secret. Vanish.\"  The technician vanished. Walton said, \"Items seventy-three through seventy-seven on yesterday morning's record tape are to be deleted, and the information carried in those tubes is to be deleted as well. Furthermore, there is to be no record made of this transaction.\"  The voicewrite on floor twenty clattered briefly, and the order funneled into the computer. Walton waited a moment, tensely. Then he said, \"All right, technician. Come back in where I can see you.\"  The technician appeared. Walton said, \"I'm running a check now. Have the machine prepare another transcript of yesterday's activities between 0900 and 1200, and also one of today's doings for the last fifteen minutes.\"  \"Right away, sir.\"  While he waited for the new transcripts to arrive, Walton studied the list of names on his desk. Five doctors--Gunther, Raymond, Archer, Hsi, Rein. He didn't know which one of them had examined the Prior baby, nor did he care to find out. All five would have to be transferred.  Meticulously, he took up his stylus and pad again, and plotted a destination for each:      _Gunther ... Zurich._     _Raymond ... Glasgow._     _Archer ... Tierra del Fuego._     _Hsi ... Leopoldville._     _Rein ... Bangkok._  He nodded. That was optimum dissemination; he would put through notice of the transfers later in the day, and by nightfall the men would be on their way to their new scenes of operation. Perhaps they would never understand why they had been uprooted and sent away from New York.  The new transcripts arrived. Impatiently Walton checked through them.  In the June tenth transcript, item seventy-one dealt with smallpox statistics for North America 1822-68, and item seventy-two with the tally of antihistamine supply for requisitions for Clinic Three. There was no sign of any of Walton's requests. They had vanished from the record as completely as if they had never been.  Walton searched carefully through the June eleventh transcript for any mention of his deletion order. No, that hadn't been recorded either.  He smiled, his first honest smile since FitzMaugham's assassination. Now, with the computer records erased, the director dead, and the doctors on their way elsewhere, only Fred stood in the way of Roy's chance of escaping punishment for the Prior business.  He decided he'd have to take his chances with Fred. Perhaps brotherly love would seal his lips after all.     VI   The late Director FitzMaugham's files were spread over four floors of the building, but for Walton's purposes the only ones that mattered were those to which access was gained through the director's office alone.  A keyboard and screen were set into the wall to the left of the desk. Walton let his fingers rest lightly on the gleaming keys.  The main problem facing him, he thought, lay in not knowing where to begin. Despite his careful agenda, despite the necessary marshaling of his thoughts, he was still confused by the enormity of his job. The seven billion people of the world were in his hands. He could transfer fifty thousand New Yorkers to the bleak northern provinces of underpopulated Canada with the same quick ease that he had shifted five unsuspecting doctors half an hour before.  After a few moments of uneasy thought he pecked out the short message, _Request complete data file on terraforming project_.  On the screen appeared the words, _Acknowledged and coded; prepare to receive_.  The arrival bin thrummed with activity. Walton hastily scooped out a double handful of typed sheets to make room for more. He grinned in anguish as the paper kept on coming. FitzMaugham's files on terraforming, no doubt, covered reams and reams.  Staggering, he carted it all over to his desk and began to skim through it. The data began thirty years earlier, in 2202, with a photostat of a letter from Dr. Herbert Lang to FitzMaugham, proposing a project whereby the inner planets of the solar system could be made habitable by human beings.  Appended to that was FitzMaugham's skeptical, slightly mocking"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50441"],["title","Master of Life and Death (#7)"],["body","; the old man had kept everything, it seemed, even letters which showed him in a bad light.  After that came more letters from Lang, urging FitzMaugham to plead terraforming's case before the United States Senate, and FitzMaugham's increasingly more enthusiastic answers. Finally, in 2212, a notation that the Senate had voted a million-dollar appropriation to Lang--a miniscule amount, in terms of the overall need, but it was enough to cover preliminary research. Lang had been grateful.  Walton skimmed through more-or-less familiar documents on the nature of the terraforming project. He could study those in detail later, if time permitted. What he wanted now was information on the current status of the project; FitzMaugham had been remarkably silent about it, though the public impression had been created that a team of engineers headed by Lang was already at work on Venus.  He shoved whole handfuls of letters to one side, looking for those of recent date.  Here was one dated 1 Feb 2232, FitzMaugham to Lang: it informed the scientist that passage of the Equalization Act was imminent, and that Lang stood to get a substantial appropriation from the UN in that event. A jubilant reply from Lang was attached.  Following that came another, 10 May 2232, FitzMaugham to Lang: official authorization of Lang as an executive member of Popeek, and appropriation of--Walton's eyes bugged--five billion dollars for terraforming research.  Note from Lang to FitzMaugham, 14 May: the terraforming crew was leaving for Venus immediately.  Note from FitzMaugham to Lang, 16 May: best wishes, and Lang was instructed to contact FitzMaugham without fail at weekly intervals.  Spacegram from Lang to FitzMaugham, 28 May: arrived at Venus safely, preparing operation as scheduled.  The file ended there. Walton rummaged through the huge heap, hoping to discover a later communiqué; by FitzMaugham's own request, Lang should have contacted Popeek about four days ago with his first report.  Possibly it had gone astray in delivery, Walton thought. He spent twenty minutes digging through the assorted material before remembering that he could get a replacement within seconds from the filing computer.  He typed out a requisition for any and all correspondence between Director FitzMaugham and Dr. Herbert Lang that was dated after 28 May 2232.  The machine acknowledged, and a moment later replied, _This material is not included in memory banks_.  Walton frowned, gathered up most of his superfluous terraforming data, and deposited it in a file drawer. The status of the project, then, was uncertain: the terraformers were on Venus and presumably at work, but were yet to be heard from.  The next Popeek project to track down would be the faster-than-light spaceship drive. But after the mass of data Walton had just absorbed, he found himself hesitant to wade through another collection so soon.  He realized that he was hungry for the sight of another human being. He had spent the whole morning alone, speaking to anonymous underlings via screen or annunciator, and requisitioning material from an even more impersonal computer. He wanted noise, life, people around him.  He snapped on the annunciator. \"I'm calling an immediate meeting of the Popeek section chiefs,\" he said. \"In my office, in half an hour--at 1230 sharp. Tell them to drop whatever they're doing and come.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Just before they started to arrive, Walton felt a sudden sick wave of tension sweep dizzyingly over him. He pulled open the top drawer of his new desk and reached for his tranquilizer tablets. He suffered a moment of shock and disorientation before he realized that this was FitzMaugham's desk, not his own, and that FitzMaugham forswore all forms of sedation.  Chuckling nervously, Walton drew out his wallet and extracted the extra benzolurethrin he carried for just such emergencies. He popped the lozenge into his mouth only a moment before the spare figure of Lee Percy, first of the section chiefs to arrive, appeared in the screener outside the door.  \"Roy? It's me--Percy.\"  \"I can see you. Come on in, Lee.\"  Percy was in charge of public relations for Popeek. He was a tall, angular man with thick corrugated features.  After him came Teddy Schaunhaft, clinic coordinator; Pauline Medhurst, personnel director; Olaf Eglin, director of field agents; and Sue Llewellyn, Popeek's comptroller.  These five had constituted the central council of Popeek. Walton, as assistant administrator, had served as their coordinator, as well as handling population transfer and serving as a funnel for red tape. Above them all had been FitzMaugham, brooding over his charges like an untroubled Wotan; FitzMaugham had reserved for himself, aside from the task of general supervision, the special duties attendant on handling the terraforming and faster-than-light wings of Popeek.  \"I should have called you together much earlier than this,\" Walton said when they were settled. \"The shock, though, and the general confusion--\"  \"We understand, Roy,\" said Sue Llewellyn sympathetically. She was a chubby little woman in her fifties, whose private life was reported to be incredibly at variance with her pleasantly domestic appearance. \"It's been rough on all of us, but you were so close to Mr. FitzMaugham....\"  There was sympathetic clucking from various corners of the room. Walton said, \"The period of mourning will have to be a brief one. What I'm suggesting is that business continue as usual, without a hitch.\" He glanced at Eglin, the director of field agents. \"Olaf, is there a man in your section capable of handling your job?\"  Eglin looked astonished for a moment, then mastered himself. \"There must be five, at least. Walters, Lassen, Dominic--\"  \"Skip the catalogue,\" Walton told him. \"Pick the man you think is best suited to replace you, and send his dossier up to me for approval.\"  \"And where do _I_ go?\"  \"You take over my slot as assistant administrator. As director of field agents, you're more familiar with the immediate problems of my old job than anyone else here.\"  Eglin preened himself smugly. Walton wondered if he had made an unwise choice; Eglin was competent enough, and would give forth one hundred percent effort at all times--but probably never the one hundred two percent a really great administrator could put out when necessary.  Still, the post had to be filled at once, and Eglin could pick up the reins faster than any of the others.  Walton looked around. \"Otherwise, activities of Popeek will continue as under Mr. FitzMaugham, without a hitch. Any questions?\"  Lee Percy raised an arm slowly. \"Roy, I've got a problem I'd like to bring up here, as long as we're all together. There's a growing public sentiment that you and the late director were secretly Herschelites.\" He chuckled apologetically. \"I know it sounds silly, but I just report what I hear.\"  \"I'm familiar with the rumor,\" Walton said. \"And I don't like it much, either. That's the sort of stuff riots are made of.\"  The Herschelites were extremists who advocated wholesale sterilization of defectives, mandatory birth control, and half a dozen other stringent remedies for overpopulation.  \"What steps are you taking to counteract it?\" Walton asked.  \"Well,\" said Percy, \"we're preparing a memorial program for FitzMaugham which will intimate that he was murdered by the Herschelites, who hated him.\"  \"Good. What's the slant?\"  \"That he was too easygoing, too humane. We build up the Herschelites as ultrareactionaries who intend to enforce their will on humanity if they get the chance, and imply FitzMaugham was fighting them tooth and nail. We close the show with some shots of you picking up the great man's mantle, etcetera, etcetera. And a short speech from you affirming the basically humanitarian aims of Popeek.\"  Walton smiled approvingly and said, \"I like it. When do you want me to do the speech?\"  \"We won't need you,\" Percy told him. \"We've got plenty of stock footage, and we can whip the speech out of some spare syllables you left around.\"  Walton frowned. Too many of the public speeches of the day were synthetic, created by skilled engineers who split words into their component phonemes and reassembled them in any shape they pleased. \"Let me check through my speech before you put it over, at least.\"  \"Will do. And we'll squash this Herschelite thing right off the bat.\"  Pauline Medhurst squirmed uneasily in her chair. Walton caught the hint and recognized her.  \"Uh, Roy, I don't know if this is the time or the place, but I got that transfer order of yours, the five doctors....\"  \"You did? Good,\" Walton said hurriedly. \"Have you notified them yet?\"  \"Yes. They seemed unhappy about it.\"  \"Refer them to FitzMaugham's book. Tell them they're cogs in a mighty machine, working to save humanity. We can't let personal considerations interefere, Pauline.\"  \"If you could only explain why--\"  \"Yeah,\" interjected Schaunhaft, the clinic coordinator suddenly. \"You cleaned out my whole morning lab shift down there. I was wondering--\"  Walton felt like a stag at bay. \"Look,\" he said firmly, cutting through the hubbub, \"_I_ made the transfer. I had reasons for doing it. It's your job to get the five men out where they've been assigned, and to get five new men in here at once. You're not required to make explanations to them--nor I to you.\"  Sudden silence fell over the office. Walton hoped he had not been too forceful, and cast suspicion on his actions by his stiffness.  \"Whew!\" Sue Llewellyn said. \"You really mean business!\"  \"I said we were going to run Popeek without a hitch,\" Walton replied. \"Just because you know my first name, that doesn't mean I'm not going to be as strong a director as FitzMaugham was.\"  _Until the UN picks my successor_, his mind added. Out loud he said, \"Unless you have any further questions, I'll ask you now to return to your respective sections.\"  He sat slumped at his desk after they were gone, trying to"]]]
