Moroni appeared to him again while he was viewing the sacred treasure, and forbade him taking the plates from their place of concealment, as the time had not yet come for him to take possession of them. He was required to meet the angel at that place in one year from that time, and from year to year, until the time should come for the record to be given to him for translation.  These annual visits at Cumorah continued until the 22nd of September, 1827, when the plates were committed to his keeping with instructions to translate them. He received a strict commandment to show them to no man, except such as God would appoint to see them, and bear witness of their existence and the truth of what they contained; nor was he to have any other object in view in obtaining and translating the record than the glory of God and the establishment of his Church in the earth.  With the assistance of a man of the name of Martin Harris, and another of the name of Oliver Cowdery, the latter acting as his scribe, Joseph translated the record in about two years and a half, and published it at Palmyra, New York, early in the spring of 1830.  The stone box in which the record had been preserved, and the record itself, is thus described by Joseph Smith:   Convenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario County, New York,  stands a hill of considerable size, and the most elevated of any in  the neighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not far from the  top, under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in  a stone box. This stone was thick and rounding in the middle on the  upper side, and thinner towards the edges, so that the middle part of  it was visible above the ground, but the edge all round was covered  with earth. Having removed the earth, and obtained a lever, which I  got fixed under the edge of the stone, and with a little exertion  raised it up, I looked in, and there indeed did I behold the plates,  the Urim and Thummim and the breast-plate, as stated by the messenger.  The box in which they lay was formed by laying stones together in  some kind of cement. In the bottom of the box were laid two stones  crossways of the box, and on these stones lay the plates, and the  other things with them.[F]  [Footnote F: Millennial Star, Supplement to Vol. 14, p.6.]  These records were engraven on plates which had the appearance of gold; each plate was six inches wide and eight inches long, and not quite so thick as common tin. They were filled with engravings, in Egyptian characters, and bound together in a volume as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed. The characters on the unsealed part were small, and beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many signs of antiquity in its construction and much skill in the art of engraving.[G]  [Footnote G: Letter to Mr. Wentworth.]  The following is a summary of this interesting record as given by the Prophet in his letter to Mr. Wentworth:   In this important and interesting book the history of ancient America  is unfolded, from its first settlement by a colony that came from  the Tower of Babel, at the confusion of languages, to the beginning  of the fifth century of the Christian era. We are informed by these  records that America in ancient times had been inhabited by two  distinct races of people. The first was called Jaredites and came  directly from the Tower of Babel. The second race came directly  from the city of Jerusalem, about six hundred years before Christ.  They were principally Israelites, of the descendants of Joseph. The  Jaredites were destroyed about the time that the Israelites came from  Jerusalem, who succeeded them in the inheritance of the country. The  principal nation of the second race fell in battle towards the close  of the fourth century (A.D.) The remnant are the Indians that now  inhabit this country. This book also tells us that our Savior made  his appearance upon this continent after his resurrection; that he  planted the gospel here in all its fullness, and richness, and power,  and blessing; that they had apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers and  evangelists; the same order, the same priesthood, the same ordinances,  gifts, powers and blessings, as were enjoyed on the eastern continent;  that the people were cut off in consequence of their transgressions;  that the last of their prophets who existed among them were commanded  to write an abridgment of their prophecies, history, etc., and to hide  it up in the earth, and that it should come forth and be united with  the Bible for the accomplishment of the purposes of God in the last  days.  The Book of Mormon was not brought forth without serious opposition. The commandment not to show the plates to anyone except those whom God should appoint to be witnesses of their existence and their truth, necessarily enjoined secrecy upon Joseph Smith, and involved more or less of mystery in his movements; and yet it became necessary for some to know of his having the records, or else how could he obtain the necessary assistance to translate them? These prohibitions upon the Prophet and the necessary secrecy they involved, gave rise to a perfect flood of misrepresentations and slanders; enemies pursued him at every turn; the vilest calumnies were circulated both with respect to himself and his family; they were charged with the grossest ignorance, superstition, idleness, and all things that go to the making of vicious and low characters; and yet it is evident from the testimony of those who personally knew them, that the Smiths, while poor, were nevertheless people of upright lives, kind neighbors, and good citizens. This is not said for the purpose of claiming for Joseph Smith exemption from many boyish follies, and the common weaknesses of humanity--the existence of these weaknesses, in fact, he himself freely admits and deplores; and as much has been made of his own admissions on that head, I think it proper that what he has said upon the subject should be given in full, and hence I republish here a letter of his to Oliver Cowdery which the Prophet wrote upon hearing that Cowdery, in 1834, was about to publish a series of letters on the subject of \"Early Scenes in the Church.\" Following is the letter:   _Oliver Cowdery:_   DEAR BROTHER: Having learned from the first number of the _Messenger  and Advocate,_ that you were not only about to \"give a history of the  rise and progress of the Church of the Latter-day Saints,\" but that  said history would necessarily embrace my life and character, I have  been induced to give you the time and place of my birth; as I have  learned that many of the opposers of those principles which I have  held forth to the world, profess a personal acquaintance with me,  though when in my presence, represent me to be another person in age,  education, and stature, from what I am.   I was born (according to the record of the same, kept by my parents)  in the town of Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, on the 23rd of  December, 1805.   At the age of ten my father's family removed to Palmyra, New York,  where, and in the vicinity of which, I lived, or made it my place of  residence, until I was twenty-one; the latter part in the town of  Manchester.   During this time, as is common to most or all youths, I fell into many  vices and follies; but as my accusers are and have been forward to  accuse me of being guilty of gross and outrageous violations of the  peace and good order of the community, I take the occasion to remark  that, though as I have said above, \"as is common to most, or all,  youths, I fell into many vices and follies,\" I have not, neither can  it be sustained, in truth, been guilty of wronging or injuring any  man or society of men; and those imperfections to which I allude, and  for which I have often had occasion to lament, were a light, and too  often, vain mind, exhibiting a foolish and trifling conversation.   This being all, and the worst, that my accusers can substantiate  against my moral character, I wish to add that it is not without a  deep feeling of regret that I am thus called upon in answer to my own  conscience, to fulfill a duty I owe to myself, as well as to the cause  of truth, in making this public confession of my former uncircumspect  walk, and trifling conversation and more particularly, as I often  acted in violation of those holy precepts which I knew came from God.  But as the \"Articles and Covenants\" of this Church are plain upon  this particular point, I do not deem it important to proceed further.  I only add, that I do not, nor never have, pretended to be any other  than a man \"subject to passion,\" and liable, without the assisting  grace of the Savior, to deviate from that perfect path in which all  men are commanded to walk.   By giving the above a place in your valuable paper, you will confer a  lasting favor upon myself, as an individual, and, as I humbly hope,  subserve the cause of righteousness.   I am, with feelings of esteem, your fellow-laborer in the Gospel of  our Lord, JOSEPH SMITH.  It is clear from this letter that Joseph Smith, while acknowledging his imperfections, does not accuse himself of any dark crimes of a nature to disqualify him for his subsequently exalted station or the great work to which he was called. He goes no further than to confess to lightness and vanity of mind, resulting in \"a foolish and trifling conversation;\" but even that, on account of his quick conscience and innocent life, occasioned him much remorse.  While the Book of Mormon was in process of translation, namely, in May, 1829, the question of baptism came up between Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. They repaired to the woods to inquire of the Lord concerning it, when an angel from heaven appeared to them and announced himself to be John the Baptist, of the New Testament, now raised from the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49526"],["title","The Missouri Persecutions (#3)"],["body","ead, and sent to them by the Apostles Peter, James and John, under whose direction he acted, to confer upon them the Aaronic Priesthood.[H] He placed his hands upon their heads and said:  [Footnote H Elsewhere the writer has said concerning this event: \"When the work reached that stage of development that men could be taught repentance, and receive baptism for the remission of sins, who so qualified or who with more propriety could be sent to deliver the keys of the priesthood that is especially appointed to cry repentance and administer baptism, than _the_ teacher of repentance and _the_ Baptist?\"--_New Witness for God, p. 221._]   Upon you, my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer  the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministration  of angels and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism for the  remission of sins, and this shall never be taken from the earth  until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in  righteousness.  They were then commanded to each baptize the other, which they did, and thus baptism for the remission of sins, under divine authority, was again commenced on earth. This ordination received under the hands of the angel gave them the right and power to preach the gospel, call men to repentance, and baptize them for a remission of their sins. This they began to do and in a short time quite a number had been baptized.  Soon after this first ordination, namely, some time in the month of June, 1829, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were again visited by angels. The ancient Apostles Peter, James and John came to them on the banks of the Susquehanna River, between Harmony, Susquehanna County, and Colesville, Broome County, and conferred upon them the holy Apostleship, the keys of the higher or Melchisedek Priesthood, which gave them power not only to preach the gospel and administer baptism, but to lay on hands for the Holy Ghost, together with right to all the offices in The Church. This Priesthood gave them power to organize The Church, set in order the affairs thereof in all the world, and preside over it as God's representatives.  The authority of God thus restored to earth, the way was prepared for the organization of The Church. Still the young men to whom had been entrusted these great powers waited further direction from the Lord, and did not proceed with so great an undertaking until he commanded them.  At length the commandment came, and the 6th day of April, 1830, was appointed as the day on which to effect the organization of The Church. A number of the people who had been baptized met with Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, on the day appointed, at the house of Peter Whitmer, Sen., in Fayette, Seneca County, New York, to effect that organization. The meeting was opened by solemn prayer, after which, according to previous instructions from the Lord, the Prophet Joseph called upon the brethren present to know if they would accept himself and Oliver Cowdery as their teachers in religion, and if they were willing that they should proceed to organize The Church according to the commandment of the Lord. To this the converts to the faith consented by unanimous vote. Joseph then ordained Oliver an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ; after which Oliver ordained Joseph an Elder of said Church. The sacrament was administered, and those who had been previously baptized were confirmed members of The Church, and received the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. Some enjoyed the gift of prophecy, and all rejoiced exceedingly.  While The Church was yet assembled a revelation was received from the Lord, directing that a record be kept, and that in it Joseph Smith be called a Seer, a Translator, a Prophet, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, an Elder of The Church; and The Church was commanded to give heed to all his words and commandments which he should receive from the Lord, accepting his word as the word of God in all patience and faith. On condition of their doing this, the Lord promised them that the gates of hell should not prevail against The Church; but on the contrary he would disperse the powers of darkness before them, and shake the very heavens for their good.  In addition to the ordination of Joseph and Oliver to be Elders in The Church, as stated above, other brethren were called and ordained to different offices in the Priesthood as the Spirit directed. \"And after a happy time,\" says the Prophet, \"spent in witnessing and feeling for ourselves the power and blessings of the Holy Ghost, through the grace of God bestowed upon us, we dismissed with the pleasing knowledge that we were now individually, members of, and acknowledged of God, The Church of Jesus Christ, organized in accordance with commandments and revelations given by him to ourselves in the last days, as well as according to the order of The Church as recorded in the New Testament.\"  On Sunday, the 11th of April, the public ministry of The Church may be said to have begun. Oliver Cowdery on that day preached the first public discourse of the new dispensation then opening. Of the nature of the discourse we know little or nothing. The meeting was held by previous appointment at the house of Mr. Peter Whitmer, in Fayette, and was largely attended by people of the neighborhood, and the preaching was certainly successful, as upon the same day, and doubtless as a result of the explanations, teachings, doctrines and spirit of the discourse, a number came forward for baptism, and a few days later a number more--thirteen in all. And so the work grew and prospered.  Fayette, in Seneca County, New York, and Colesville, Broome County, in the same State, were the centers of activity for The Church in those early days. In both places meetings were occasionally held, and baptisms were frequent, in the clear, beautiful waters of Seneca Lake. What historical associations will yet gather about these localities! Fayette! Seneca Lake! I venture to predict that these places will in the ages to come be as famous as Capernaum and Lake Gennesaret. The latter were the scenes of Christ's early ministry. The former the scenes of Joseph Smiths. The latter were identified with the Dispensation of the Meridian of Time. The former with the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times. Capernaum and Gennesaret are associated with memories of the Christ, with Simon Peter, with John, with Andrew and Nathaniel, and Mary of Magdala. Fayette and Seneca with Joseph Smith, with Oliver, with David Whitmer, with Joseph Knight and Newel, his son, with Emily Coburn and others. Gennesaret was but the widening of the Jordan; Seneca but one of the river valleys once occupied and modified by the glaciers which in ancient times filled that land.[I] The site of the ancient Capernaum is now unknown; so, too, the Fayette of our Church history is no more; but of the latter as of the former, and of Seneca as of Gennesaret it may be said: If every vestige of human habitation should disappear from beside it, and the jackal and the hyena should howl about the shattered fragments where Joseph once taught, yet the fact that he chose it as the scene of his ministry will give a sense of sacredness and pathos to its lovely waters till Time shall be no more.  [Footnote I: Enc. Brit., Art. New York.]  On the first of June The Church held its first conference as an organized body. At that conference--held in Fayette--more brethren were ordained to the various offices of the Priesthood; a number who had been baptized were confirmed; the sacrament was administered, and many spiritual manifestations were enjoyed, such as beholding heavenly visions and prophesying.  Thus The Church was organized and well started upon its career, the history of which was to be so thrilling; the success of which was to be so great; and the final victory of which over every opposing power is assured by the promises of God.    CHAPTER II.  THE MISSION TO THE LAMANITES.  The Book of Mormon, the coming forth of which has already been detailed, contains many promises to the Lamanites--that is, to the American Indians, whom it reveals to be the remnants of mighty nations that once inhabited the Americas, and also proclaims them to be descendants of the house of Israel. Their present fallen state arises from their departure from the ways of the Lord, and the instructions and doctrines of their ancient prophets; the very blackness of their skin is the result of God's curse upon them for their unrighteousness; yet are they promised that they shall know their origin--the favored race from which they are descended; it is promised that the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them, and they shall regard it as a blessing from the hand of the Lord; \"and their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes, and many generations shall not pass away among them save they shall be a white and delightsome people.\" [A] It is promised that Zion, the New Jerusalem, shall be built upon the land of their fathers--the Americas--which, according to the Book of Mormon, is a land especially dedicated to the seed of Joseph, of Egyptian fame, the son of Jacob, \"and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh;\" and in this great work of building up the Zion of God, the Lamanites are assigned a special part, which will be a manifestation of God's favor towards them.[B]  [Footnote A: II Nephi, chap. 30.]  [Footnote B Book of Mormon, Ether 13, and III Nephi 20.]  Very naturally, of course, those who accepted the Book of Mormon as true, possessed a lively interest in this people, that is, in the Lamanites; and anxiously looked forward to the commencement of the fulfillment of the words of their ancient prophets concerning them; and hence at the close of a conference held in the last days of September, and which also extended into the early days of October, \"a great desire,\" says the Prophet, \"was manifested by several elders respecting the remnants of the"]]]
