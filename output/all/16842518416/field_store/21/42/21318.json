She knew I'd come back changed--or mad--or not at all. I think--I think she wanted me to betray you again.\"  \"Adric!\" Narayan reached out quickly and grabbed my arm, hard, above the elbow, till I cried out with the pain of that steely grip and twisted away, rubbing numbed flesh. \"Adric--\" Narayan repeated, unsteadily, \"Why do you say--betray me again? Betray me? Adric--it was your hand that freed me! Zandru! Adric--\" he begged, \"_How much_ have you forgotten?\"     CHAPTER SEVEN  Battle in my Brain   The fire in the other room had burned down to an ember. Without a glance my way, Narayan mended the fire; sat down, his legs stretched toward the little blaze, his shin in his hands; waiting. I could not stand still. I walked, restless, around the room, speaking in little jerks and half-sentences.  \"You are the Dreamer,\" I said, \"I--I remember a little. I remember being bound to you. I remem-member when I--freed you. Not knowing what it might mean, not knowing you could have slain me on the ground of sacrifice.\"  \"No!\" Narayan was as motionless as Gamine's veils, but his voice was harsh, strident. \"No, Adric, never that! We cannot--kill each other, you and I. I could order you killed, I suppose, but I--I would never do that unless there was no other way. Adric--is there any other way for me, for you?\"  A bitterness spoke in my voice; neither side trusted Adric, both wanted his allegiance. I tried to trim my words carefully between the two personalities that were battling for mastery in me.  \"It was Karamy,\" I said, \"who took Adric from you, and sent him, half-mad, back to the Crimson Tower. Karamy's magic stripped him of power, and sent him, gone mad, back to stargazing in Narabedla. But it was _not_ Karamy's--\" the voice that was not quite mine shook, suddenly, with my own weariness and the blank terror I'd been keeping at bay, \"It wasn't Karamy who sent _me_ here, I'm not Adric. You were perfectly right. I'm no more Adric than--than you are. I'm in Adric's body, yes. He moves me like a puppet! I have his memories, his--some of his thoughts--but he--\" my voice cracked suddenly on a note of panic; I knew I sounded like a hysterical kid, but I couldn't stop my own crackup once it had broken loose. \"I'm not Adric, I'm not! I don't belong here at all! I don't--\"  Narayan jumped up from the bench and I heard his hurrying steps, then his steel hands were hard on my shoulders, swinging me around to face him. \"All right,\" he said, \"Steady. It's all right.\"  I drew a long breath and let it out again. \"Thanks,\" I said briefly, shamed. \"I'll be all right now.\"  Narayan shrugged wearily. \"It's all right. I guessed you weren't Adric, of course, from the beginning. But I didn't think Adric, when it came to the test, would really do that to me. I had his promise. I suppose, for him, it was an easy way out. A perfect way of escape.\" He sank down on the bench again, dropping his head in his hands. After a little, he looked up, and his voice sounded tired. \"This is difficult,\" he said. \"My men think you are Adric. I'd never be able to convince them you aren't. Would you mind--pretending? You'll have to; otherwise--\" he paused, and I saw disquiet in his face. He was not a man who would enjoy threatening, but I could understand his situation. They didn't know me from Adam; I was just an outsider who messed things up by resembling Adric. Well, I was stuck. I hadn't liked the Narabedlans enough to give a hang what Narayan meant to do to them. Narayan, by comparison, looked pretty decent. And there was no other way to save my skin. Adric wasn't too popular, it seemed and in Adric's body I hadn't a chance. I laughed. \"I'll try,\" I told him. \"But what's this all about?\"  Narayan looked up again. \"That's right. You wouldn't know. You have some of Adric's memory, I suppose, but not all. You remember who I am?\"  \"Not entirely--\" I told him. I remembered some things. Narayan had been born, some thirty years ago, into a respectable country family who were appalled to discover they had given birth to a mutant Dreamer, and were only too glad to deliver him to the Narabedlans for the enforced stasis. I told Narayan.  \"You remember the old Dreamer who served your House?\"  I nodded. He had become old, mortal, weak--and had been eliminated. I bowed my head, although I had no personal guilt.  Afterward, Narayan and I had been bound. \"I slept in the Dreamer's Keep--\" Narayan sounded reflective, almost guilty, \"I was wakened, and--given sacrifice. I learned to use my power and to give it up to Adric.\" A brooding horror was in the grey eyes; I realized that Narayan dwelt in his own personal private hell with the memory of what he had done under the spell of Narabedla. \"Adric was--strong.\"  Yes, I thought; Adric had called on Narayan's new power without counting cost. What wonder the memory maddened Narayan? The young Dreamer seemed to win his silent fight for self-control. \"Well, you--Adric, I mean--freed me. I found my sister again; Cynara. I was like a child; I had to learn to live, to be alive again. I had been trained to use my power only through the Sacrifice. I had to learn to use it without. It wasn't easy.\"  \"Why?\" I asked thoughtlessly. Narayan's eyes froze me. \"To use that power,\" he said in a tense, controlled voice, \"Took human life.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Outside the door I could hear the noises of the camp; the light of their watch-fires crept in through the cracks. It was too dark to see Narayan's face now, but I heard him moving restlessly about the room. \"I have harnessed the power somewhat,\" he said, \"I can use it, myself, a little. Not much. Adric helped me; so did my sister. She had been taken for Sacrifice, but you--Adric--redeemed her. Then--we were able to throw an illusion around Cynara. She is not of Narabedla; but we made it seem as if she had always been there, in Rainbow City. We could do that because Evarin is weak, and because Karamy did not care. It was Rhys who made the Illusion.\"  \"Rhys!\" The old Dreamer, the only one born in Narabedla--  \"Yes; Gamine is careless with Rhys and lets him wake too long. Rhys and I have been in contact for a long time.\"  I was hearing scraps of conversation from a vast abyss of time and space, when I had been drawn in electric coma through Karamy's Time Ellipse. _They will know, Narayan will know._ That had been old Rhys. And Adric; _What have I to do with Narayan?_ Adric had been--still was--playing a fancy double game with Narayan; I started to open my lips to tell the young Dreamer about it, but he was still talking. \"Rhys will not act, not directly, against Rainbow City. But he did that much for us, and Gamine and Cynara are friends. We forgot--we all forgot--that Adric's allegiance belonged to Narabedla first. Until he vanished.\" I heard the brooding heaviness in Narayan's voice. These men had been friends. Narayan went on, \"I sent Brennan today, to find out. He didn't come back.\"  I lowered my head and miserably told him what had happened to Brennan. Narayan's face in a flicker of firelight looked drawn and haggard. \"He was a--brave man,\" Narayan said at last. \"But I don't blame you. After the interchange, I think, there was a time when you went on living Adric's life. Thinking his thoughts. But now, I think, he will grow weaker in you. I _hope_. You--who are you, in your own world?\"  I shrugged. The words would have meant nothing to Narayan. \"My name's Mike Kenscott.\"  \"Mi-ek,\" Narayan repeated, turning the strange word on his tongue. \"The men will call you Adric. I'd better, too. Later--\" he shrugged. I didn't say anything; I was still convinced that I hadn't seen the last of Adric. But I didn't want to tell Narayan this. I liked the man.  Without warning, Narayan switched on lights. \"It's near dawn, and you must be worn out. We've taught them to stay clear of the forests at night, so we're safe enough here. They can't do much till they've been to the Dreamers Keep, in any case.\" With a sudden boyish friendliness he put out his hand and I took it. \"I'm glad you're not Adric. He might be hard to handle now--if he's changed so much.\"  As if the lights had been a signal, fat Raif came without knocking into the room. Narayan crossed his hostile stare at me. \"He's all right, Raif,\" the Dreamer said. The fat face broke into a sudden, elephantine smile. \"I'd better apologize, Adric. I had orders.\"  \"Find him a place to sleep,\" Narayan suggested, and I followed Raif up a flight of low stairs into an inner room. There was a bed there, clean, but tumbled as if it had had another occupant not long ago. Raif said, \"Kerrel's gone with Cynara. You can sleep here.\"  I kicked off my boots and crawled between the blankets, suddenly too weary even to answer. I had been two days without sleep, and most of that time I had been under exhausting physical and mental strain. I saw Raif cautiously finger his weapons and sensed that whatever Narayan said, he was reserving judgment. He didn't take chances, this outside lieutenant of Narayan's. Sleepily I said, \"You can put that up, my friend. I'm not going to move till I've had a good, long--\"  I didn't even finish the sentence to myself. Instead I went to sleep.  I had slept for hours. I came abruptly out of confused dreams to hear a shrill voice and to feel small hands pulling me upright. Cynara! \"Wake up, Adric--\" she wailed, \"Karamy and Evarin are riding today--hunting _you_!\"  I sat up, dizzy-brained, far from alert. \"Cynara! How--\"  \"Oh, never mind that--\" her voice was impatient, \"What can we _do_?\"  I didn't know. I was still stupid with sleep, but I put a reassuring arm around her shoulders. \"Don't be afraid,\" I told her, then, releasing her, bent and began to pull on my boots. I heard the swift pound of steps on the stairs, and Narayan shoved open the door, dragging a brown tunic over his head as he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50571"],["title","The Green Odyssey (#0)"],["body","GREEN ODYSSEY                           by Philip José Farmer                            Make friends fast.                             --_Handbook For The Shipwrecked_                             Ballantine Books                                New York                            Copyright 1957, by                           Philip José Farmer               Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 57-10603                 Printed in the United States of America                             BALLANTINE BOOKS, INC.                            101 Fifth Avenue,                            New York 3, N.

To Nan Gerding     DANGER! THRILLS! ADVENTURE!   Alan Green was not exactly a hero. In fact he liked peace just as well as the next man. Not that he was really afraid of that crazy, hot-blooded hound-dog Alzo, or even of the hound's gorgeous owner, the Duchess Zuni--who was also hot-blooded (to say nothing of the Duke). After all, these things were understood on this backward, violent planet, and a man could manage, provided he was alert twenty-four hours a day.  And as a matter of fact, Alan was only normally apprehensive of his Junoesque, tempestuous (but altogether lovable) wife Amra. Delightful, demanding Amra--and her five uproarious kids. The trouble was, he was tired. And homesick.  So when he heard of two other downed spacemen, he hitched a ride with a piratical merchant-captain on a windroller destined to carry him to the spaceship and thence to the peaceful green hills of Earth. But he had reckoned without the vagaries of the windroller, pirates, the \"traveling islands,\" the rascally Captain, and various flora and fauna peculiar to this planet--all of which, it now seemed, regarded Alan with unnerving malevolence.  And worst of all, Amra was determined that he should be a hero. Amra won.     1   For two years Alan Green had lived without hope. From the day the spaceship had crashed on this unknown planet he had resigned himself to the destiny created for him by accident and mathematics. Chances against another ship landing within the next hundred years were a million to one. Therefore it would do no good to sit around waiting for rescue. Much as he loathed the idea, he must live the rest of his life here, and he must squeeze as much blood as he could out of this planet-sized turnip. There wasn't much to squeeze. In fact, it seemed to him that he was the one losing the blood. Shortly after he'd been cast away he'd been made a slave.  Now, suddenly, he had hope.  Hope came to him a month after he'd been made foreman of the kitchen slaves of the Duke of Tropat. It came to him as he was standing behind the Duchess during a meal and directing those who were waiting upon her.  It was the Duchess Zuni who had not so subtly maneuvered him from the labor pens to his coveted, if dangerous, position. Why dangerous? Because she was very jealous and possessive, and the slightest hint of lack of attention from him could mean he'd lose his life or one limb or another. The knowledge of what had happened to his two predecessors kept him extremely sensitive to her every gesture, her every wish.  That fateful morning he was standing behind her as she sat at one end of the long breakfast table. In one hand he held his foreman's wand, a little white baton topped by a large red ball. With it he gestured at the slaves who served food, who poured wine and beer, who fanned away the flies, who carried in the household god and sat it on the god chair, who played something like music. Now and then he bent over the Duchess Zuni's long black hair and whispered phrases from this or that love poem, praising her beauty, her supposed unattainability, and his burning, if seemingly hopeless, passion for her. Zuni would smile, or repeat the formula of thanks--the short one--or else giggle at his funny accent.  The Duke sat at the other end of the table. He ignored the by-play, just as he ignored the so-called secret passage inside the walls of the castle, which Green used to get to the Duchess's apartments. Custom demanded this, just as custom demanded that he should play the outraged husband if she got tired of Green or angry at him and accused him publicly of amorous advances. This was enough to make Green jittery, but he had more than the Duke to consider. There was Alzo.  Alzo was the Duchess's watchdog, a mastiff-like monster with shaggy red-gold hair. The dog hated Green with a vindictiveness that Green could only account for by supposing that the animal knew, perhaps from his body-odor, that he was not a native of this planet. Alzo rumbled a warning deep in his chest every time Green bent over the Duchess or made a too-sudden movement. Occasionally he rose to his four feet and nuzzled the man's leg. When that happened Green could not keep from breaking out into a sweat, for the dog had twice bitten him, playfully, so to speak, and severely lacerated his calf. As if that weren't bad enough, Green had to worry that the natives might notice that his scars healed abnormally fast, almost overnight. He'd been forced to wear bandages on his legs long after the new skin had come in.  Even now, the nauseating canine was sniffing around Green's quivering hide in the hope of putting the fear of the devil in him. At that moment the Earthman resolved that, come the headsman's ax, rack, wheel, or other hellish tortures, he was going to kill that hound. It was just after he made that vow that the Duchess caused him to forget altogether the beast.  \"Dear,\" said Zuni, interrupting the Duke in the midst of his conversation with a merchant-captain, \"what is this I hear about two men who have fallen from the sky in a great ship of iron?\"  Green quivered, and he held his breath as he waited for the Duke's reply.  The Duke, a short, dark many-chinned man with white hair and very thick bristly salt-and-pepper eyebrows, frowned.  \"Men? Demons, rather! Can men fly in an iron ship through the air? These two claimed to have come from the stars, and you know what that means. Remember Oixrotl's prophecy: _A demon will come, claiming to be an angel_. No doubt about these two! Just to show you their subtlety, they claim to be neither demon nor angels, but men! Now, there's devilish clever thinking. Confusing to anybody but the most clear-headed. I'm glad the King of Estorya wasn't taken in.\"  Eagerly Zuni leaned forward, her large brown eyes bright, and her red-painted mouth open and wet. \"Oh, has he burned them already? What a shame! I should think he'd at least torture them for a while.\"  Miran, the merchant-captain, said, \"Your pardon, gracious lady, but the King of Estorya has done no such thing. The Estoryan law demands that all suspected demons should be kept in prison for two years. Everybody knows that a devil can't keep his human disguise more than two years. At the end of that time he reverts to his natural flesh and form, a hideous sight to behold, blasphemous, repulsive, soul-shaking.\"  Miran rolled his one good eye so that only the white showed and made the sign to ward off evil, the index finger held rigidly out from a clenched fist. Jugkaxtr, the household priest, dived under the table, where he crouched praying, secure in the knowledge that demons couldn't touch him while he knelt beneath the thrice-blessed wood. The Duke swallowed a whole glass of wine, apparently to calm his nerves, and belched.  Miran wiped his face and said, \"Of course, I wasn't able to find out much, because we merchants are regarded with deep suspicion and scarcely dare to move outside the harbor or the marketplace. The Estoryans worship a female deity--ridiculous, isn't it?--and eat fish. They hate us Tropatians because we worship Zaxropatr, Male of Males, and because they must depend on us to bring them fish. But they aren't close-mouthed. They babble on and on to us, especially when one has given them wine for nothing.\"  Green finally released his breath in a sigh of relief. How glad he was that he had never told these people his true origin! So far as they knew he was merely one of the many slaves who came from a distant country in the North.  Miran cleared his throat, adjusted his violet turban and yellow robes, pulled gently at the large gold ring that hung from his nose and said, \"It took me a month to get back from Estorya, and that is very good time indeed, but then I am noted for my good luck, though I prefer to call it skill plus the favor given by the gods to the truly devout. I do not boast, O gods, but merely give you tribute because you have smiled upon my ventures and have found pleasing the scent of my many sacrifices in your nostrils!\"  Green lowered his eyelids to conceal the expression of disgust which he felt must be shining from them. At the same time, he saw Zuni's shoe tapping impatiently. Inwardly he groaned, because he knew she would divert the conversation to something more interesting to her, to her clothes and the state of her stomach and/or complexion. And there would be nothing that anybody could do about it, because the custom was that the woman of the house regulated the subject of talk during breakfast. If only this had been lunch or dinner! Then the men would theoretically have had uncontested control.  \"These two demons were very tall, like your slave Green, here,\" said Miran, \"and they could not speak a word of Estoryan. Or at least they claimed they couldn't. When King Raussmig's soldiers tried to capture them they brought from the folds of their strange clothes two pistols that only had to be pointed to send silent and awesome and sure death. Everywhere men dropped dead. Panic overtook many, but there were brave soldiers who"]]]
