But pardon me for interrupting, my good man. What's the bad, bad hunch about this time?\"  \"Okay, I can take it.\" Dave grinned at him. But the grin quickly faded. \"Maybe it isn't a hunch,\" he said. \"Maybe it's just me. But I'm wondering if Old Man Jinx isn't catching up to us, Freddy?\"  \"Rubbish!\" the British-born air ace snorted. \"Positively ridiculous. Just because I had a little trouble with that Lightning, and brought it in for a terrible landing? Why--\"  \"And my crate couldn't fly for beans!\" Dawson interrupted. \"Plus the fact that it took us years to finally get away from North Africa. Plus the fact that we almost cashed in our chips in that pea soup fog. Plus--Oh nuts! Don't pay any attention to me. I've just turned into a wet smack of late. Call me Old Woman Dawson, pal.\"  \"I'd call you a lot of things, only there are ladies at the next table!\" Freddy Farmer said, and gave him the stern eye. \"You're just wound up a bit, Dave. Relax, old thing. Lord knows that's what you've told me enough times. Look, I've got a surprise, Dave!\"  \"Hold it!\" Dawson cried, and raised both hands in protest. \"If you think you're going to drag me halfway across London to see some weather-beaten joint where one of your famous kings stopped for tea and crumpets, you're--\"  \"The Holborn!\" Freddy stopped him. \"It's a theatre, and there's a very funny show playing there. Part American cast, too. I got the tickets this afternoon without saying anything to you. Well, what about it? Shall we go, or just sit here and mope about your blasted hunches?\"  \"Part American cast?\" Dawson echoed.  \"Yes, but they don't spoil the show too much, I hear!\" Freddy snapped at him. \"Well, is it a go?\"  \"On one condition,\" Dave said, and gave Farmer a very grave look.  \"And that is?\" the English youth walked into the trap.  \"That you wait until it's over before you ask me to explain the jokes and tag lines!\" Dawson said with a chuckle. Then quickly, \"Now, now, little man! Food's scarce in England. Put down that plate!\"  \"As if I'd waste a crumb on the likes of you!\" Freddy Farmer growled, but he did release his sudden hold on his plate. \"Now if there were a hammer or a length of lead pipe handy. Oh well, probably neither would make an impression on your thick skull!\"  Dawson laughed at the look on Freddy's face, and as he resumed eating his meal he suddenly realized that his mood of gloom and depression had gone. He felt swell; sitting right on top of the world.  As it was still early evening, the two aces took their time finishing the meal. But finally they settled the check and wandered out into the blacked out streets of London. As they reached the Strand they both impulsively paused and peered at the shadowy sky line. It was a long time since the Luftwaffe had given up the attempt to force stout-hearted London to its knees, but many scars of those weeks and months of nightly sky horror were still visible. No, there were not heaps of bomb rubble all about. On the contrary, Londoners had pitched to with a will and cleaned up their beloved city. The scars that Dawson and Freddy Farmer saw were simply the gaping holes where once a building, or a theater, or a row of shops, had been. In other words, it was not what they saw that sent their thoughts flying back to the blitz of London; it was the familiar things that they didn't see. And would never see again.  \"The dirty beggars!\" Freddy Farmer said in a low, strained voice. \"The dirty dogs for doing this to London!\"  \"Yeah,\" Dawson murmured. \"But they're getting paid back, pal. And how they're getting paid back! Before we're through they'll wish they'd never been born.\"  \"What a pity,\" young Farmer grunted.  \"Huh, pity?\" Dawson echoed sharply. \"Because we're smacking them plenty, and--\"  \"No,\" Freddy interrupted. \"I mean, what a pity any of them were ever born in the first place. So help me, I don't believe I'll ever live to see the day when just hearing the word Nazi won't make my blood boil, and make me see red.\"  \"And that goes for millions of people, Freddy,\" Dawson said. \"But right now, nuts to the future. Shall we try to flag a taxi in this sprawled out coal mine, or is the Holborn near enough to walk?\"  \"It's not far, so let's walk,\" young Farmer said. \"It will be like old times, perhaps.\"  \"Okay, Grandpa!\" Dawson laughed. \"But watch your step, and don't trip over your beard. And by all means, don't let us get lost, see?\"  \"Lost?\" Freddy Farmer snorted. \"Why, you could dump me down in any part of London, and I'd--\"  \"Which might not be such a bad idea at that!\" Dawson chuckled. \"Okay, my handsome guide, let's get going.\"  Keeping close to each other, they strolled up the Strand toward Aldwych Circle and Kingsway. They took their time, which was the best thing to do in London's blackout. Time and time again they almost bumped into persons coming their way. And more than once their teeth clicked as they went down off a curbstone they didn't see until too late. Eventually, though, they turned into Kingsway and started along toward High Holborn where the theater was located.  After a couple of blocks, however, they ran into a detour. And after a block or so the detour ran into another detour. And some ten minutes after that Dawson nudged his shoulder against Freddy Farmer's.  \"I don't want to imply anything, kind sir,\" he said, \"but you do happen to know where the heck we are, don't you?\"  \"Of course!\" the English youth snapped. \"This is Serle Street close by Lincoln's Fields. Second right and then first left will bring us right out on High Holborn at Chancery Lane.\"  \"Well, all those names make it _sound_ as if you knew what you're talking about,\" Dawson murmured.  \"Don't be silly!\" Freddy snapped. \"Would you get lost in a blackout in your precious New York?\"  \"Could happen, could happen,\" Dawson grunted. \"But I'm just hoping it isn't happening here.\"  \"No fear of that, my little man,\" Freddy assured him. \"Take hold of Pater's hand, and he'll lead you.\"  However, Dawson refused to do that. Fifteen minutes later, as the pair came to a cross street, Freddy Farmer paused and rubbed a hand down the side of his face.  \"Blast it, there shouldn't be a cross street here!\" he muttered.  \"Oh, oh!\" Dawson groaned. \"And my mother warned me, too!\"  \"Oh, shut up!\" Farmer growled. \"It's probably a new one they've made since I was here last.\"  Dawson didn't say anything. A small metal plate on the step post of the first building of the cross street caught his eye. He moved closer and snapped on his small pocket flashlight for an instant. When he came back to Freddy his voice was brittle.  \"And how were things in 1810 when you were here last, pal?\" he snapped. \"That's when that post plate says that building was built. Made the street since the blitz, huh? Or was there a blitz in 1810?\"  \"Oh, good grief, Dave, I'm afraid--!\" Freddy Farmer began.  \"I'm not _afraid_ we're lost!\" Dawson cut in. \"I'm dead certain, dope. Give me a shilling!\"  \"Why?\" Freddy demanded.  \"I'm going to toss it,\" Dawson said. \"Heads we go to the right, tails we go to the left.\"  \"But what about straight ahead?\" Farmer asked.  \"I've had enough of going straight ahead on this street!\" Dawson growled. \"For all you know it may go right off the edge of a cliff. But okay. If the shilling lands edge up we go straight ahead. Flash your beam on the sidewalk, Freddy.\"  Young Farmer did that. Dawson flipped the coin, which made a tinkling sound as it hit the sidewalk and bounced around. Finally it came to rest with the King's head showing.  \"We turn right,\" Dawson grunted, and picked up the shilling. \"And I'll just keep this as a little souvenir of the night's travels. Of all the--!\"  \"I'm sorry, Dave, blast it all!\" Freddy Farmer groaned. \"I guess the London streets aren't what they used to be.\"  \"In more ways than one, pal!\" Dave murmured. \"But dry your tears, little fellow. It's okay. Maybe we'll bump into a taxi at the next corner, or one of your London Bobbies who can give us a bearing and put us on the beam.\"  If the two air aces had turned left at that cross street they would have met a patrolling Bobbie within the next two hundred yards. But they turned right, and in so doing walked straight into the beginning of their greatest battle with Death, and Satan's forces of evil and ruthless destruction!     CHAPTER THREE  _The Dead Can't Breathe_   It was no doubt their imagination, but as Freddy Farmer and Dave Dawson walked along the street to the right they both felt as though it was even more blacked out. They could hardly see a dozen steps in front of them. On both sides the street was lined by a solid row of four or five story city dwellings, not one of which showed so much as a tiny pin point of light. Perhaps they were filled with men, women, and children, but as far as Freddy and Dave could tell they might well have been lost in the very heart of a completely dead city. They didn't even meet anybody on the sidewalk. In fact, they didn't meet anything but darkness, and more darkness. Clouds had crawled across the face of the sky, so it was only by straining their eyes that they were able to make out the silhouettes of the building tops. And to add to all that, the street seemed to go on and on, with not one single intersection.  Finally Dave drew to a halt, and made sounds in his throat.  \"Well, I guess we're even now, kid,\" he said with a groan. \"Because if you didn't lose us before, I sure have lost us now. This doggone street is like a subway tunnel with no end.\"  \"Quite!\" Freddy murmured. \"I almost wish the Luftwaffe would come over, so we could have some light and maybe see something. This is definitely a mess.\"  \"With all the trimmings,\" Dawson added. \"Look. Let's put it that that shilling gave us a bum steer. Let's go back and try the other way for a while. We're not going to meet anything this way, that's a cinch.\"  \"Right-o with me,\" young Farmer said. Then suddenly he grabbed Dawson's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50635"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Eighth Air Force (#3)"],["body","m. \"Wait a minute!\"  \"For what?\" Dave grunted. \"You got to sneeze?\"  \"Shut up!\" Freddy snapped, and exerted pressure with his fingers. \"I thought I heard footsteps back there, coming our way.\"  They both listened intently and heard nothing but their own breathing.  \"You and your big ears!\" Dave finally growled. \"Footsteps on this street, my eye! There can't be two _other_ dopes in London tonight. Let's go, and--\"  But Dawson never finished the sentence. At that instant two shadowy figures seemed to appear by magic right out of the darkness.  \"So?\" a deep voice growled. \"You would try to escape us?\"  For a moment Dawson stood like a man struck to stone, his eyes popping, and his mouth sagging. It had stunned him to see the two shadowy figures appear out of thin night-black air. And it stunned him to feel the firm pressure of a gun muzzle against his ribs. But what stunned him most was to hear the voice _speaking German_!  \"What, what?\" he finally blurted out in English. \"Hey! What's the big idea? Is this a stick-up?\"  \"Silence, dogs, both of you!\" the voice hissed. \"You are fools to try to make jokes. We have followed you all the way from the hotel. We _know_! You are stupid to think you could escape us!\"  \"But see here, you're altogether balmy!\" Freddy Farmer spoke the first words that came to his lips. \"We're not trying to escape anybody. We're lost, and--\"  A sharp hard slap cut off the rest of Freddy Farmer's words. Dawson started to leap forward instinctively, but an arm was hooked about his neck, and the gun muzzle was practically snapping one of his ribs in two. For a brief instant colored light spun around in front of his eyes, and blind rage tempted him to risk a bullet from the gun as he attempted a Commando trick to rid himself of his attacker. But in the darkness he couldn't see how Freddy was making out, and there was the chance that Freddy might pay for the trick with his life. And so he let his coiled muscles relax, and stood perfectly still.  A moment later the hooked arm was removed from about his neck, but the pressure of the gun muzzle remained the same.  \"That is good,\" the voice growled in his ear. \"My orders are not to kill you unless I am forced to. So do not be foolish, as I do not feel patient tonight.\"  Dawson ignored the man's words and strained his eyes to see the spot where Freddy Farmer and the other shadowy figure were standing so close together they looked like the form of one very fat man.  \"You okay, pal?\" he asked, keeping his voice steady.  \"Quite, old thing,\" Freddy Farmer replied calmly. But to Dawson Freddy's voice sounded very muffled.  \"Silence!\" Dawson's \"playmate\" rasped, still speaking in German. \"Not a word, or a sound, you swine. I warn you. Hans! Make your dog silent so that he will not trouble me! And then go back and get the car. Hurry.\"  A cry of instinctive alarm rose to Dawson's lips, but before he could let it out it was all over. There was blurred lightning-like movement, then a sickening _thud_, and Freddy Farmer slowly sank to the sidewalk. Blazing rage flared up in Dawson, but cold, common sense held him in rigid check. This was no moment to be a blockheaded hero. The odds were far too great against him. And so he continued to remain perfectly still as the second shadowy figure faded away to become instantly lost in the darkness.  Seconds that seemed minutes long ticked by, and an almost uncontrollable urge to yell at the top of his voice seized hold of Dawson. He curbed the urge, however, and was suddenly of half a mind to speak in German to the man cracking his ribs with the gun muzzle. In fact, his lips moved to speak the words, but he stilled them at the last split second as something seemed to tell him not to speak in German.  \"I don't know what this is all about, Mister,\" he said in a low voice, \"but you've got the wrong two guys. Just who do you think I am, anyway?\"  \"I _know_ who you are, Karl Stoltz!\" the other grated. \"It is no use. Nothing you can say or do will help you!\"  Dawson started to tell the man to put it in English, as he did not understand German. But suddenly he realized that Freddy and he had both plainly shown that they understood German. So to act ignorant would simply be stupid.  \"So I'm Karl Stoltz, eh?\" he finally echoed in German. Then switching to English, he said, \"And just who in heck is Karl Stoltz? Reach into my upper left pocket, Mister, and you'll find all my papers. And you won't find the name of Karl Stoltz on any of them!\"  \"Of course not, you stupid fool!\" the other retorted. \"But we know who you are. And so does Herr Baron. He will be glad to see you, Karl Stoltz. _Ja, ja!_ _Very_ glad!\"  Dawson started to speak, but at that instant he saw the two slit headlights of a car coming along the street. It slid up to the curb with no more than a soft mechanical whisper of sound, and came to a stop. The door opened, and a shadowy figure stepped out, gathered the limp Freddy Farmer up in his arms, and dumped the English-born air ace down onto the floor of the car, as though he were no more than a wet sack of meal.  \"You--!\" Dawson began savagely.  But that's as far as he got. A crack on the side of his head sent stars and comets spinning, and seemed to paralyze his entire body from head to foot. By the time he was able to shake off the paralytic spell, and take stock of things, he found himself beside Freddy Farmer on the floor of the car. A pair of heavy booted feet were resting on the small of his back, and the car was in motion and pulling away from the curb.  The first thing he did when complete consciousness returned was to move his head as close to Freddy as he could, hold his breath, and strain his ears. Almost instantly a great wave of relief flooded through him. He could hear Freddy Farmer's regular breathing. At least the blow Freddy had received had not cracked his skull and killed him. He was just out cold, that was all.  Was that all? It was more than enough. It was too much. And as the car rolled on almost silently down the pitch dark street Dawson mentally promised himself that the instant he was given the opportunity he would pay it all back to these two rats, and with plenty of interest.  However, his flash of silent anger died as various thoughts concerning the utterly incredible business began to pass through his brain. Utterly incredible, maybe, but a very definite reality just the same. That it was a case of mistaken identity was as plain as the nose on anybody's face. But that the two kidnappers were obviously Nazi agents right there in London was something you just couldn't laugh off. Nor could he laugh off the fact that Freddy and he had stumbled into something that was deadly serious. The reasons, and what have you, were completely beyond him. He believed that they were being taken to someone known as Herr Baron. But from there on it was all just a lot of blanks that no amount of imagination could possibly fill in.  He checked his rambling thoughts as he felt Freddy Farmer stir, and then heard him groan and mumble.  \"Blast the dirty blighter!\" young Farmer got out. \"Good gosh, my head!\"  \"Take it easy, Freddy,\" Dave murmured. \"You got clipped good. But if you can talk, it can't be too bad. Just try--\"  The two heavy booted feet clumping down made Dawson feel for an instant that his spine had been snapped.  \"Silence, dogs!\" a harsh voice said. \"You will have your chance to talk later!\"  Dawson cut short the blistering retort that rose to his lips. Then, after he had got full control of the seething anger within himself, he inched one hand over until he could feel Freddy Farmer's right leg. Then, using a short jab of a finger for a dot, and a longer jab for a dash, he signalled his pal in International Morse code....  \"Chin up, pal. It's all very screwy, but we can't do a thing about it yet. Just play dumb, and wait for the break.\"  A couple of moments passed, and then Dawson felt Freddy Farmer signalling a reply message.  \"Right you are. But when and if the break does come, I'm going to give it to the dirty beggars. I think they are Nazi agents.\"  \"You can say that again!\" Dawson signalled. \"And a couple of tough eggs, too. So watch it. Play it their way until we find out what's what.\"  Young Farmer signalled back that he would do just that. And then the two air aces stopped their silent signalling, and grimly waited for further developments.  However, they had to wait quite a while. A good forty-five minutes passed before the car's speed was slackened. Then it turned sharp right, bumped over something, and went down a steep incline, after which it traveled a short distance on the level before it finally came to a full stop. From the movements of the car Dawson was pretty sure that they had turned off a main street into a short inclined driveway that ended at a garage. And when a moment later he heard the sound of doors rolling shut he knew that he had figured correctly.  And then a switch was snapped, and the interior of the car was filled with yellow light.  It blinded him for a moment, even though he was lying down face to the car floor and away from the light. But as soon as he could adjust his eyes to the sudden change he turned his head and looked at Freddy Farmer. Freddy was a little pale around the edges, and there was a tiny trickle of blood from his nose, but the hard, glittering look in his eyes indicated that his feelings had been hurt far, far more than his cracked nose and clipped head.  \"Atta boy, Freddy!\" Dave whispered softly. \"Just hold it that way, but _hold_ it!\"  Young Farmer had only the chance to nod slightly. Before he could whisper in reply the heavy booted feet were removed from the small of Dawson's back, and harshly spoken German words filled their ears.  \"Get up, and get out, swine! Herr Baron is waiting! Get up, dogs--or must I help you?\"  An altogether fitting comment hovered on Dawson's lips, but he did not permit himself the satisfaction of saying it. Instead he"]]]
