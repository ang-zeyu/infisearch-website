May I rule my people    In glory, and like Thee be good and righteous!    To you, boyars, I look for help.

Now let us go to kneel before the tombs    Of Russia's great departed rulers. Then    Bid summon all our people to a feast,    All, from the noble to the poor blind beggar.    To all free entrance, all most welcome guests.     (Exit, the Boyars following.)     PRINCE VOROTINSKY. (Stopping Shuisky.)    You rightly guessed.     SHUISKY.           Guessed what?     VOROTINSKY.                Why, you remember--    The other day, here on this very spot.     SHUISKY. No, I remember nothing.     VOROTINSKY.                    When the people    Flocked to the Virgin's Field, thou said'st--     SHUISKY.                           'Tis not    The time for recollection. There are times    When I should counsel you not to remember,    But even to forget. And for the rest,    I sought but by feigned calumny to prove thee,    The truelier to discern thy secret thoughts.    But see! The people hail the tsar--my absence    May be remarked. I'll join them.     VOROTINSKY.                    Wily courtier!     NIGHT  Cell in the Monastery of Chudov (A.D. 1603)     FATHER PIMEN, GREGORY (sleeping)     PIMEN (Writing in front of a sacred lamp.)    One more, the final record, and my annals    Are ended, and fulfilled the duty laid    By God on me a sinner. Not in vain    Hath God appointed me for many years    A witness, teaching me the art of letters;    A day will come when some laborious monk    Will bring to light my zealous, nameless toil,    Kindle, as I, his lamp, and from the parchment    Shaking the dust of ages will transcribe    My true narrations, that posterity    The bygone fortunes of the orthodox    Of their own land may learn, will mention make    Of their great tsars, their labours, glory, goodness--    And humbly for their sins, their evil deeds,    Implore the Saviour's mercy.--In old age    I live anew; the past unrolls before me.--    Did it in years long vanished sweep along,    Full of events, and troubled like the deep?    Now it is hushed and tranquil. Few the faces    Which memory hath saved for me, and few    The words which have come down to me;--the rest    Have perished, never to return.--But day    Draws near, the lamp burns low, one record more,    The last. (He writes.)     GREGORY. (Waking.) Ever the selfsame dream! Is 't possible?    For the third time! Accursed dream! And ever    Before the lamp sits the old man and writes--    And not all night, 'twould seem, from drowsiness,    Hath closed his eyes. I love the peaceful sight,    When, with his soul deep in the past immersed,    He keeps his chronicle. Oft have I longed    To guess what 'tis he writes of. Is 't perchance    The dark dominion of the Tartars? Is it    Ivan's grim punishments, the stormy Council    of Novgorod? Is it about the glory    Of our dear fatherland?--I ask in vain!    Not on his lofty brow, nor in his looks    May one peruse his secret thoughts; always    The same aspect; lowly at once, and lofty--    Like some state Minister grown grey in office,    Calmly alike he contemplates the just    And guilty, with indifference he hears    Evil and good, and knows not wrath nor pity.     PIMEN. Wakest thou, brother?     GREGORY.             Honoured father, give me    Thy blessing.     PIMEN.      May God bless thee on this day,    Tomorrow, and for ever.     GREGORY.              All night long    Thou hast been writing and abstained from sleep,    While demon visions have disturbed my peace,    The fiend molested me. I dreamed I scaled    By winding stairs a turret, from whose height    Moscow appeared an anthill, where the people    Seethed in the squares below and pointed at me    With laughter. Shame and terror came upon me--    And falling headlong, I awoke. Three times    I dreamed the selfsame dream. Is it not strange?     PIMEN. 'Tis the young blood at play; humble thyself    By prayer and fasting, and thy slumber's visions    Will all be filled with lightness. Hitherto    If I, unwillingly by drowsiness    Weakened, make not at night long orisons,    My old-man's sleep is neither calm nor sinless;    Now riotous feasts appear, now camps of war,    Scuffles of battle, fatuous diversions    Of youthful years.     GREGORY.         How joyfully didst thou    Live out thy youth! The fortress of Kazan    Thou fought'st beneath, with Shuisky didst repulse    The army of Litva. Thou hast seen the court,    And splendour of Ivan. Ah! Happy thou!    Whilst I, from boyhood up, a wretched monk,    Wander from cell to cell! Why unto me    Was it not given to play the game of war,    To revel at the table of a tsar?    Then, like to thee, would I in my old age    Have gladly from the noisy world withdrawn,    To vow myself a dedicated monk,    And in the quiet cloister end my days.     PIMEN. Complain not, brother, that the sinful world    Thou early didst forsake, that few temptations    The All-Highest sent to thee. Believe my words;    The glory of the world, its luxury,    Woman's seductive love, seen from afar,    Enslave our souls. Long have I lived, have taken    Delight in many things, but never knew    True bliss until that season when the Lord    Guided me to the cloister. Think, my son,    On the great tsars; who loftier than they?    God only. Who dares thwart them? None. What then?    Often the golden crown became to them    A burden; for a cowl they bartered it.    The tsar Ivan sought in monastic toil    Tranquility; his palace, filled erewhile    With haughty minions, grew to all appearance    A monastery; the very rakehells seemed    Obedient monks, the terrible tsar appeared    A pious abbot. Here, in this very cell    (At that time Cyril, the much suffering,    A righteous man, dwelt in it; even me    God then made comprehend the nothingness    Of worldly vanities), here I beheld,    Weary of angry thoughts and executions,    The tsar; among us, meditative, quiet    Here sat the Terrible; we motionless    Stood in his presence, while he talked with us    In tranquil tones. Thus spake he to the abbot    And all the brothers: \"My fathers, soon will come    The longed-for day; here shall I stand before you,    Hungering for salvation; Nicodemus,    Thou Sergius, Cyril thou, will all accept    My spiritual vow; to you I soon shall come    Accurst in sin, here the clean habit take,    Prostrate, most holy father, at thy feet.\"    So spake the sovereign lord, and from his lips    Sweetly the accents flowed. He wept; and we    With tears prayed God to send His love and peace    Upon his suffering and stormy soul.--    What of his son Feodor? On the throne    He sighed to lead the life of calm devotion.    The royal chambers to a cell of prayer    He turned, wherein the heavy cares of state    Vexed not his holy soul. God grew to love    The tsar's humility; in his good days    Russia was blest with glory undisturbed,    And in the hour of his decease was wrought    A miracle unheard of; at his bedside,    Seen by the tsar alone, appeared a being    Exceeding bright, with whom Feodor 'gan    To commune, calling him great Patriarch;--    And all around him were possessed with fear,    Musing upon the vision sent from Heaven,    Since at that time the Patriarch was not present    In church before the tsar. And when he died    The palace was with holy fragrance filled.    And like the sun his countenance outshone.    Never again shall we see such a tsar.--    O, horrible, appalling woe! We have sinned,    We have angered God; we have chosen for our ruler    A tsar's assassin.     GREGORY.         Honoured father, long    Have I desired to ask thee of the death    Of young Dimitry, the tsarevich; thou,    'Tis said, wast then at Uglich.     PIMEN.                        Ay, my son,    I well remember. God it was who led me    To witness that ill deed, that bloody sin.    I at that time was sent to distant Uglich    Upon some mission. I arrived at night.    Next morning, at the hour of holy mass,    I heard upon a sudden a bell toll;    'Twas the alarm bell. Then a cry, an uproar;    Men rushing to the court of the tsaritsa.    Thither I haste, and there had flocked already    All Uglich. There I see the young tsarevich    Lie slaughtered: the queen mother in a swoon    Bowed over him, his nurse in her despair    Wailing; and then the maddened people drag    The godless, treacherous nurse away. Appears    Suddenly in their midst, wild, pale with rage,    Judas Bityagovsky. \"There, there's the villain!\"    Shout on all sides the crowd, and in a trice    He was no more. Straightway the people rushed    On the three fleeing murderers; they seized    The hiding miscreants and led them up    To the child's corpse yet warm; when lo! A marvel--    The dead child all at once began to tremble!    \"Confess!\" the people thundered; and in terror    Beneath the axe the villains did confess--    And named Boris.     GREGORY.       How many summers lived    The murdered boy?     PIMEN.          Seven summers; he would now    (Since then have passed ten years--nay, more--twelve years)    He would have been of equal age to thee,    And would have reigned; but God deemed otherwise.    This is the lamentable tale wherewith    My chronicle doth end; since then I little    Have dipped in worldly business. Brother Gregory,    Thou hast illumed thy mind by earnest study;    To thee I hand my task.

The matin bell. Bless, Lord, Thy servants!    Give me my crutch.     (Exit.)     GREGORY.         Boris, Boris, before thee    All tremble; none dares even to remind thee    Of what befell the hapless child; meanwhile    Here in dark cell a hermit doth indite    Thy stern denunciation. Thou wilt not    Escape the judgment even of this world,    As thou wilt not escape the doom of God.     FENCE OF THE MONASTERY*          *This scene was omitted by Pushkin from the published         version of the play.     GREGORY and a Wicked Monk     GREGORY. O, what a weariness is our poor life,    What misery! Day comes, day goes, and ever    Is seen, is heard one thing alone; one sees    Only black cassocks, only hears the bell.    Yawning by day you wander, wander, nothing    To do; you doze; the whole night long till daylight    The poor monk lies awake; and when in sleep    You lose yourself, black dreams disturb the soul;    Glad that they sound the bell, that with a crutch    They rouse you. No, I will not suffer it!    I cannot! Through this fence I'll flee! The world    Is great; my path is on the highways never    Thou'lt hear of me again.     MONK.                   Truly your life    Is but a sorry one, ye dissolute,    Wicked young monks!     GREGORY.          Would that the Khan again    Would come upon us, or Lithuania rise    Once more in insurrection. Good! I would then    Cross swords with them! Or what if the tsarevich    Should suddenly arise from out the grave,    Should cry, \"Where are ye, children, faithful servants?    Help me against Boris, against my murderer!    Seize my foe, lead him to me!\"     MONK.                       Enough, my friend,    Of empty babble. We cannot raise the dead.    No, clearly it was fated otherwise    For the tsarevich--But hearken; if you wish    To do a thing, then do it.     GREGORY.                 What to do?     MONK. If I were young as thou, if these grey hairs    Had not already streaked my beard--Dost take me?     GREGORY. Not I.     MONK.        Hearken; our folk are dull of brain,    Easy of faith, and glad to be amazed    By miracles and novelties. The boyars    Remember Godunov as erst he was,    Peer to themselves; and even now the race    Of the old Varyags is loved by all. Thy years    Match those of the tsarevich. If thou hast    Cunning and hardihood--Dost take me now?     GREGORY. I take thee.     MONK.               Well, what say'st thou?     GREGORY.                                 'Tis resolved.    I am Dimitry, I tsarevich!     MONK.                    Give me    Thy hand, my bold young friend. Thou shalt be tsar!     PALACE OF THE PATRIARCH  PATRIARCH, ABBOT of the Chudov Monastery     PATRIARCH. And he has run away, Father Abbot?     ABBOT. He has run away, holy sovereign, now three days ago.     PATRIARCH. Accursed rascal! What is his origin?     ABBOT. Of the family of the Otrepievs, of the lower nobility    of Galicia; in his youth he took the tonsure, no one    knows where, lived at Suzdal, in the Ephimievsky    monastery, departed from there, wandered to various    convents, finally arrived at my Chudov fraternity;    but I, seeing that he was still young and inexperienced,    entrusted him at the outset to Father Pimen, an old man,    kind and humble. And he was very learned, read our    chronicle, composed canons for the holy brethren; but,    to be sure, instruction was not given to him from the    Lord God--     PATRIARCH. Ah, those learned fellows! What a thing to    say, \"I shall be tsar in Moscow.\" Ah, he is a vessel of    the devil! However, it is no use even to report to the    tsar about this; why disquiet our father sovereign?    It will be enough to give information about his flight to    the Secretary Smirnov or the Secretary Ephimiev.    What a heresy: \"I shall be tsar in Moscow!\"...    Catch, catch the fawning villain, and send him to    Solovetsky to perpetual penance. But this--is it not    heresy, Father Abbot?     ABBOT. Heresy, holy Patriarch; downright heresy.     PALACE OF THE TSAR  Two Attendants     1ST ATTENDANT. Where is the sovereign?     2ND ATTENDANT.                  In his bed-chamber,    Where he is closeted with some magician.     1ST ATTENDANT. Ay; that's the kind of intercourse he loves;    Sorcerers, fortune-tellers, necromancers.    Ever he seeks to dip into the future,    Just like some pretty girl. Fain would I know    What 'tis he would foretell.     2ND ATTENDANT.             Well, here he comes.    Will it please you question him?     1ST ATTENDANT.                How grim he looks!     (Exeunt.)     TSAR. (Enters.) I have attained the highest power. Six years    Already have I reigned in peace; but joy    Dwells not within my soul. Even so in youth    We greedily desire the joys of love,    But only quell the hunger of the heart    With momentary possession. We grow cold,    Grow weary and oppressed! In vain the wizards    Promise me length of days, days of dominion    Immune from treachery--not power, not life    Gladden me; I forebode the wrath of Heaven    And woe. For me no happiness. I thought    To satisfy my people in contentment,    In glory, gain their love by generous gifts,    But I have put away that empty hope;    The power that lives is hateful to the mob,--    Only the dead they love. We are but fools    When our heart vibrates to the people's groans    And passionate wailing. Lately on our land    God sent a famine; perishing in torments    The people uttered moan. The granaries    I made them free of, scattered gold among them,    Found labour for them; furious for my pains    They cursed me! Next, a fire consumed their homes;    I built for them new dwellings; then forsooth    They blamed me for the fire! Such is the mob,    Such is its judgment! Seek its love, indeed!    I thought within my family to find    Solace; I thought to make my daughter happy    By wedlock. Like a tempest Death took off    Her bridegroom--and at once a stealthy rumour    Pronounced me guilty of my daughter's grief--    Me, me, the hapless father! Whoso dies,    I am the secret murderer of all;    I hastened Feodor's end, 'twas I that poisoned    My sister-queen, the lowly nun--all I!    Ah! Now I feel it; naught can give us peace    Mid worldly cares, nothing save only conscience!    Healthy she triumphs over wickedness,    Over dark slander; but if in her be found    A single casual stain, then misery.    With what a deadly sore my soul doth smart;    My heart, with venom filled, doth like a hammer    Beat in mine ears reproach; all things revolt me,    And my head whirls, and in my eyes are children    Dripping with blood; and gladly would I flee,    But nowhere can find refuge--horrible!    Pitiful he whose conscience is unclean!     TAVERN ON THE LITHUANIAN FRONTIER  MISSAIL and VARLAAM, wandering friars; GREGORY in secular attire; HOSTESS     HOSTESS. With what shall I regale you, my reverend    honoured guests?     VARLAAM. With what God sends, little hostess. Have you    no wine?     HOSTESS. As if I had not, my fathers! I will bring it at    once. (Exit.)     MISSAIL. Why so glum, comrade? Here is that very    Lithuanian frontier which you so wished to reach.     GREGORY. Until I shall be in Lithuania, till then I shall not    Be content.     VARLAAM. What is it that makes you so fond of Lithuania!    Here are we, Father Missail and I, a sinner, when we fled    from the monastery, then we cared for nothing. Was it    Lithuania, was it Russia, was it fiddle, was it dulcimer?    All the same for us, if only there was wine. That's the    main thing!     MISSAIL. Well said, Father Varlaam.     HOSTESS. (Enters.)    There you are, my fathers. Drink to your health.     MISSAIL. Thanks, my good friend. God bless thee. (The    monks drink. Varlaam trolls a ditty: \"Thou passest    by, my dear,\" etc.) (To GREGORY) Why don't you join    in the song? Not even join in the song?     GREGORY. I don't wish to.     MISSAIL. Everyone to his liking--     VARLAAM. But a tipsy man's in Heaven.* Father Missail!    We will drink a glass to our hostess. (Sings: \"Where    the brave lad in durance,\" etc.) Still, Father Missail,    when I am drinking, then I don't like sober men; tipsiness    is one thing--but pride quite another. If you want    to live as we do, you are welcome. No?--then take    yourself off, away with you; a mountebank is no    companion for a priest.          [*The Russian text has here a play on the words which cannot         be satisfactorily rendered into English.]     GREGORY. Drink, and keep your thoughts to yourself,*    Father Varlaam! You see, I too sometimes know how    to make puns.          [*The Russian text has here a play on the words which cannot         be satisfactorily rendered into English.]     VARLAAM. But why should I keep my thoughts to myself?     MISSAIL. Let him alone, Father Varlaam.     VARLAAM. But what sort of a fasting man is he? Of his    own accord he attached himself as a companion to us;    no one knows who he is, no one knows whence he comes--    and yet he gives himself grand airs; perhaps he has a    close acquaintance with the pillory. (Drinks and sings:    \"A young monk took the tonsure,\" etc.)     GREGORY. (To HOSTESS.) Whither leads this road?     HOSTESS. To Lithuania, my dear, to the Luyov mountains.     GREGORY. And is it far to the Luyov mountains?     HOSTESS. Not far; you might get there by evening, but for    the tsar's frontier barriers, and the captains of the    guard.     GREGORY. What say you? Barriers! What means this?     HOSTESS. Someone has escaped from Moscow, and orders    have been given to detain and search everyone.     GREGORY. (Aside.) Here's a pretty mess!     VARLAAM. Hallo, comrade!"]]]
