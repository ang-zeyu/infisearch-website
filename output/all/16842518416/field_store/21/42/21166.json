It was then stretched in a frame and the three \"thunder birds,\" the clouds, and a few flowers in the foreground were painted in wax. The bills, eyes and legs of the birds were painted in with orange dye.  The roadway, parts of the rocks, drapery on the Indian maiden, some of her decoration, and parts of the foliage, were painted directly on the silk with yellow or orange dye.  The remaining foliage, more decoration worn by the maiden, the grass, leaves on the flowers and the stems were painted green.  These shapes were stopped out with wax. Much painting in of shapes was done with wax. This gave a finish and jewel-like quality to the work as it progressed.  Before the material was dyed it was soaked in warm water the same temperature as the dye-bath. The piece was then dyed in a bath of blue. It was worked constantly for about ten minutes. It was removed from the dye and rinsed in clear warm water.  After rinsing, the material was placed flat between layers of bath towels and much of the moisture removed. The drying was finished by hanging over a waxed line.  The sky and the blue of the border were next stopped out, leaving for the next bath the pony, the remainder of the Indian maiden, the tree trunks and other shapes in the foreground.    [Illustration: DETAILS FROM OLD SARONGS {p. 95}]  The frame was placed in an upright position after the custom of Javanese workers. While waxing, the light shone through and every uncovered spot was easily seen. A medium sized soft brush was used for stopping out the large spaces.  Great care was taken to drain the excess wax from the brush. This is more necessary when the work is erect, as it prevents the wax from running down the goods.  The third dye-bath was prepared with red and a little yellow. A piece of the fabric dyed with the last dipping was dyed in this bath to test the color. The material when dyed in this bath was a rich, red-purple.  After partly drying with bath towels the piece was stretched on the frame to finish drying.  When thoroughly dry the entire surface was waxed except the mane and tail of the horse, the hair of the maiden, a few of the jewels, some details in the foreground, and the ground of the border.  All the broken places in the wax were carefully mended for the final dipping. The colors for the bath were dark green and black. The piece was finished by rinsing in warm water, then in cold, and finally by a gasoline bath.  The work extended over a period of two weeks.  It is a finished piece, rare and beautiful in its illumination.     CHAPTER V  DYEING FOR PLAYS AND PAGEANTS   The play bases its claim in the school curriculum on the very essence of human nature. The art of being someone or something else in thought and action under a setting of conditions and through a flow of events is practiced by all of us. It is the eternal expression of playful and imitative childhood, and, though restraints enter with maturity, it never leaves us. Witness the audience we give to the stage.    [Illustration: {COSTUME FROM A PLAY} {p. 97}]  This has been recognized in the study of the play in literature and in the production of the school play. The application of the art training of the school in giving the play its setting and costumes is of the greatest value. The life of a school finds expression, through co-operation of all departments, in its own community theater.  Dyeing is an important consideration in a dramatic production. Colorful costumes and properties have a large part in making a play.    [Illustration: MINIATURE STAGES, PLAIN AND DECORATED BY CHILDREN       {p. 98}]    [Illustration: STAGE SCENES IN MINIATURE {p. 99}]  The possibilities of continuous play without scene shifting, by drawing unobtrusive curtains alternately to the right and to the left--creating atmosphere by the merest suggestion--is simple when dyes and dyeing enter into the plans of the setting. The old heavy painted scenery is not a part of the new drama.  The ground cloth and colored lights also offer opportunities for the service of the dyer.  Costumes are more easily created when soft old materials are dyed, and it requires but little experience to discover how the beauty and effectiveness of a play are enhanced thereby.  The proscenium arch takes its place in the illusion, when the imagination is stimulated by color decoration.  There should be an intimate co-operation between the community of little theater and craft workers.  The relation of the little theater to those who do handicraft is stated by Mr. George Somnes, Director of the Little Theater of Indianapolis, as follows:  \"Too much stress cannot be laid upon the importance of all-over dyeing, batiks, and other pattern dyeing, and their application in the work of the little theater.  \"Preeminently the little theater stands for the giving of the theater back to the artist, be he producer, musician, scene designer, costume designer, dancer or author. There is the endeavor to establish each little theater group as a means of community expression. The use of color in its relation to the play and lights, as scenery and in costumes, is so obvious and necessary that it needs scarcely more than mention. As experimentation is necessary and desirable, there must be at the bottom an actual foundation and knowledge upon which to experiment and build.    [Illustration: MINIATURE STAGECRAFT {p. 100}]  \"School plays and pageants could be improved many hundred percent if the knowledge of color and its application were made more general. Not only would children be taught that green and red go together, but they would be taught just _what_ greens and reds form the various combinations--they could find out under what lights certain colors react best.  \"Give us more artists and craftsmen and we will have a real theater; give us local artists and craftsmen and we will have a Community Theater.\"  In the following item from \"The Workshop,\" the magazine issued by the Little Theater Society of Indiana, the editor writes to the community of the dyed costumes used in \"Dierdre of the Sorrows.\"  \"The Little Theater Society feels it very significant that they are able to call attention to the use of color in the present production and to mention that its application in this play is the work of local artists. The Waldcraft Studios have generously given time, service and experience to help make this production complete. Does not that sound hopeful for our development, and by example, are there not more people in other fields who can give their time, knowledge and experience to the development of something which when it is completed as an institution will belong to you?\"    [Illustration: MINIATURE STAGE, PLAIN AND DRAPED WITH BATIKED       HANGINGS {p. 103}]  The illustrations shown in this chapter are, (1) a plain miniature stage constructed of pasteboard and upon which the study of the decoration for a school play may well begin, (2) two stages that have been thus decorated, (3) two scenes in a play with miniature jointed dolls wearing real dyed costumes made by children, (4) several children at work designing and constructing for plays, (5) a group of scenes from a play given in a backyard, for which the costumes were especially dyed, (6) another miniature stage made of wood, shown plain and decorated with dyed hangings for a play, and (7) some character parts from the Little Theater of Indianapolis, for which special dyeing was done.  The miniature pasteboard stages, page 98, were decorated with opaque water colors by school children. These illustrate the preliminary step in decorating a stage with dyed textiles. They would reproduce in batiks.  The first decorated stage is planned to play \"Treasure Island.\" The decoration over the proscenium arch is \"The little ship that is headed south-west,\" and the border,      \"Fifteen men on a dead man's chest,     Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.\"  The background colors are blue and black, the ship white and the fifteen men red and white.  The other stage is planned for a patriotic entertainment. The colors for this occasion are conventional.  The miniature stage in wood (page 103) and the ensemble pictured suggests dyeing of stage properties.    [Illustration: SCENES FROM AN OUT-OF-DOOR PLAY {p. 105}]  The proscenium arch of this little stage was decorated for the study of the play \"Restoring the Mourners.\" The dramatic story tells of the exile of the Miami Indians from Indiana to Kansas. When this event took place there were seventeen states in the Union. The Indians called these states the \"Seventeen Fires\" (Council Fires). These \"fires\" were treated symbolically in the border at the top of the proscenium arch.  The fires, realistic in color, were painted in and stopped out with wax. The panels were dyed blue. The spaces back of the fires and the council were stopped out with wax and the whole dyed a deep purple. This stage construction is suitable for the end of a room or hall where there is no balcony or for out-of-doors.  The curtain, seen through the proscenium arch and enlarged on page 108, is an interesting batik dyed in values of red, blue and purple.  The decoration was painted realistically on the white silk and covered with wax.  The bottom of the piece for about four or five inches was kept in the dye-bath until most of the color was exhausted. A small amount of red was added to the bath and little by little the material was immersed in the bath until about two-thirds of the goods were dyed.  The top of the material was dyed blue in like manner.  The bottom is a brilliant red, the top a bright blue and the center different values of purple and pale lavender.  The pictures of Mr. George Somnes and Mrs. Eugene Fife as Naisi and Dierdre, in \"Dierdre of the Sorrows,\" page 107, illustrate some of the hand-dyed costumes for this play.    [Illustration: HAND DYED COSTUMES FROM THE LITTLE THEATER {p."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49823"],["title","Batik and Other Pattern Dyeing (#8)"],["body"," 107}]  Mrs. Fife's cloak was a beautiful clear blue; her dress a dark red; the tie-dyed veil a deep purple; the design an intense yellow-gold.  There was no attempt to show batik in the decoration. The wax resist was the easiest means of decorating the costume.  Mr. Somnes' cloak was a purple gray with symbolic designs painted in wax. His boots were dyed brown.  These costumes were made of old material. All of the costumes were dyed to suggest contact with the elements.    [Illustration: A SCENE CURTAIN {p. 108}]     CHAPTER VI  TIE-DYED WORK   This beautiful and fascinating art of textile decoration, applied to draperies and articles of dress, has been practiced in many countries for centuries. Old pieces have been found in South America, in Peru and Bolivia. In the Philippines and in provinces of India the work may still be seen, the art having been handed down from generations unknown.    [Illustration: {TIE-DYED FABRIC} {p. 109}]  The essential process consists in dyeing the cloth in a dye-bath after having wound parts of it more or less tightly with string or cord, which serves as a resist to prevent the color from reaching those parts of the fabric. The result is a white or, if the cloth has been previously dyed, a light colored pattern on a darker background.  The method is capable of more elaborate work. There may be several dyeings, beginning with lighter colors and passing to those of darker values, and between the dyeings additional tying or untying or both.    [Illustration: PORTION OF A CHUNDRI SHOWING TIE-DYED WORK DONE IN       INDIA {p. 110}]  For example, a cloth is dyed light gray, then a pattern tied into it, after which it is put through a light blue dye-bath. This gives a light gray design upon a grayed blue background. But suppose now that a part only of the tying is removed, some additional tying done in the grayed blue field, and a third dye-bath used, this time a light red. The background becomes a grayed purple and in the design are gray, grayed blue and grayed red.  There may be a great variety of designs, depending upon the manner of tying the individual unit and the spacing of these units with relation to each other.  The Oriental work is characterized by very small individual ties and the arrangement of many of these into some geometrical or pictorial pattern. The grouping of these little ties accurately and uniformly into lines and design clusters challenges wonder and admiration. But even with the dexterity acquired by these people the process is slow and laborious.  The illustration (page 110) shows a piece of tie-dyed work from India. The material is cotton. Careful examination shows it to have been done in the following manner: The cloth, which is very thin, was folded to form four thicknesses. Then at each point where a tie was desired the four thicknesses were pressed or drawn up and wound very tightly with string, the very tip of the fabric being left exposed to take the dye like the background. After dyeing and removing the ties the cloth was unfolded, showing the four repeats. The upper left quadrant was uppermost in the tying, and shows the dark centers very distinctly. Then came in order the upper right showing small dark centers, the lower right showing few dark centers, and the lower left showing none at all.    [Illustration: A TIE-DYED PATTERN BY HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL {p. 112}]    [Illustration: PORTION OF A TIE-DYED SILK SCARF {p. 113}]  As with other crafts that have come to us from the East, we have not chosen to imitate their marvelous perfections of detail. It has rather been to our liking to work out space and color adjustments in a manner more in keeping with our national temperament. And it is not without its measure of success in artistic and pleasing results.  The illustration on page 112 is the work of a school boy. The material was cotton, dyed old rose before the tying was done. After the tying it was dyed deep blue. The space relations are very good.  The work upon such a piece should proceed in the following manner. First the cloth should be prepared for dyeing in the manner indicated in the chapter on dyeing. The centers of the ties should next be located. Sometimes the cloth is merely gathered at each center and tied, but with larger patterns it is often folded in some definite way. The border in this piece was made by gathering across the entire piece and tying.  If the tying is very tight the outlines will be sharp. With a little looseness in the ties the color will creep in, the results of which are often very beautiful. A tie that is too loose, however, is in danger either of coming off in the dye-bath, or it may allow the color to penetrate to the extent of destroying the design.  Too prolonged treatment in the dye-bath, or dyeing at too high a temperature, may cause too much penetration of color into the tied spaces.    [Illustration: A TIE-DYED BORDER {p. 115}]    [Illustration: PORTION OF A TIE-DYED SCARF {p. 115}]  On page 113 is shown a portion of a silk scarf. In this case the white cloth was gathered at the respective centers, without any definite plan of folding, and tied rather tightly with a few winds of string about an inch or more from the center. The piece was then dyed a soft gray yellow. Then more winding was done so as to leave only the tips exposed. The next dye-bath was a soft blue somewhat stronger than the yellow. The color qualities are beautiful. The border shows the penetration of the blue color in a very happy manner.  The border design on page 115 shows the result of a definite manner of folding the cloth before tying.  The portion of a scarf illustrated on page 115 shows one large pattern beginning at the center of the scarf. The scarf was gathered or folded from the center and tied at intervals. The color is delicate old rose, especially beautiful for evening wear.  Sometimes small objects, such as marbles or glass beads, are placed at the center of the tied spots and the cloth tied around them.  A very interesting development of tie-dyed work and one which greatly increases the variety of designs is what we may term stick tying, _i.e._, tying over sticks.  The sticks for this purpose are those commonly used by school children in stick printing. These are sold by all the leading school art supply houses. These sticks are treated so they will not absorb color, which makes them especially suitable for tie-dyed work. They are of different shapes, squares, circles, triangles, oblongs, etc. On these shapes the cloth may be folded in different ways, giving an element of geometrical symmetry, which, however, is always softened in the dye-bath as the color makes its little incursions into the tied spots.    [Illustration: EXAMPLES OF STICK TYING {p. 117}]    [Illustration: STICK TIED PATTERNS {p. 117}]  Stick tying is not only a good craft problem but also splendid for the school room for both boys and girls.  It is best to lay out the design on the cloth by stick printing with a very light tint of the color to be used in the first dyeing, and using, of course, the end of the stick over which the cloth is to be tied. This insures a proper direction of the axes of the tied spots.  On page 117 are shown a number of tyings over the different sticks, and also some dyed spots resulting from tying in several ways. Any school boy can devise other stick ties, and he will be delighted with some of the effects produced by his inventions.  We also show (page 119) a silk scarf tied over sticks, with a border at each end, ready for the dye-bath. On page 120 is this same scarf after dyeing. The work was carried out in the following manner: The stick used was a flat oblong one-eighth inch thick, five-eighths inch wide and one inch long. The cloth was stick printed with light yellow to locate the centers for the ties. The end of the stick was placed at the center, the cloth folded equally on the two sides, and the tying done as shown on the first stick (page 117).  The entire scarf was dipped in warm water before dyeing. This conformed to our directions for dyeing and also caused the ties to tighten. The piece was first dyed yellow, then without any change in the tying it was dyed green.    [Illustration: A PIECE OF STICK TYING READY FOR THE DYE-BATH       {p. 119}]    [Illustration: UNITS OF THE PATTERN FROM THE ABOVE TYING {p. 119}]    [Illustration: A SILK DRAPERY DECORATED BY STICK TYING {p. 120}]    [Illustration: A STICK-TIED LINING FOR JACKET {p. 121}]  After a thorough rinsing the two yellow green bands around the stick were protected by additional tying and the upper and lower ties removed, exposing two white bands. Then followed a red dyeing, another rinsing, the removal of all ties, and a final dyeing in a very dilute golden yellow.  The result is a ground color of rich, beautiful brown. In the tied spots are bands of gold, of orange-red, of yellow-green and of brown, also a brown center. Along the edges of these bands the colors have crept in, one here and another there, to produce a beautiful iridescence. The same colors are repeated in the borders.  The lining of the jacket, page 121, is a beautiful piece of stick tying on pongee silk. The colors here are yellow, green and grayed purple, as well as the original color of the pongee. These were three dye-baths, yellow, blue and red.    [Illustration: {TIE-DYED FABRIC} {p. 122}]     CHAPTER VII  STICK PRINTING, BLOCK PRINTING AND STENCIL DYEING   It has been seen how versatile the batik method is as a means of illuminating fabrics, also how design is the controlling element in all good batik work. In both the space and color relations the batik worker has control of the entire surface subject only to the limitations imposed by the mediums in which he is working.    [Illustration: {STENCIL DESIGN} {p. 123}]  It follows that a knowledge of the principles of design must underlie good batik work as well as a knowledge of dyes.
