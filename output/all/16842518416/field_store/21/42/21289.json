Perhaps in the plane, and the note was pinned to him.\"  \"Yes, I guess you're right there, Dawson,\" Squadron Leader Markham said with a frown. \"I guess he was killed before he was put into the plane. Yes, they made that flight for the express purpose of dumping him overboard. Well, I'll get in touch with Intelligence at once. Corporal Sharron! You and two men take him over to the hospital hut. And one of you stand guard outside. I'll....\"  The C.O. cut himself off and glanced upward as there came the unmistakable sound to every listening ear of British airplane engines. The plane was a Bristol Blenheim bomber powered with two Mercury IV 920 h.p. engines. The craft was not on a bombing mission, however. In fact, it wasn't even attached to the Bomber Command. A single glance at the markings on the fuselage proved that to all eyes. The plane carried Staff markings of the Air Ministry.  Squadron Leader Markham glanced at his watch and grunted.  \"Hours sooner than I expected,\" he murmured. Then with a glance at the pilots gathered about him, he said, \"Air Ministry has cooked up a little job for us, chaps. Don't know what it's all about, but that's Group Captain Ball come to tell me. Stay around close as he may want to talk to you. Dawson! And you, too, Farmer. Stay here with me. Perhaps Group Captain Ball may want to hear the story on this business first hand. I suggest the rest of you wait in the mess. I'll send for you later, Corporal Sharron.\"  The gathering broke up, leaving the O.C., Dawson, and young Freddy Farmer to greet the Blenheim's passengers. The big craft slid down to a beautiful landing, was taxied over, and braked to a stop. The fuselage door opened and two men stepped out. One wore R.A.F. blue, and the other wore army khaki. The former was Group Captain Ball, and Dave recognized him immediately. The latter wore the insignia of a full colonel on his shoulder straps, but he was a total stranger as far as either Dave or Freddy were concerned.  The pair walked over, and the two pilots and the C.O. saluted smartly.  \"Glad to see you, sir,\" Markham said and shook Group Captain Ball's hand. \"Didn't expect you so soon. You know Flying Officers Dawson and Farmer, eh?\"  The Air Ministry official bored the two lads with a glance and smiled faintly.  \"But, of course,\" he said. \"Fact is.... But that can wait until later. Markham, this is Colonel Trevor, of Intelligence. Colonel Trevor, I'd like you to meet Squadron Leader.... Eh? What's the matter?\"  The Intelligence officer had suddenly shoved Group Captain Ball to one side and was down on his knees beside the dead man. He crouched there motionless for a half minute or so, then got to his feet and fixed Squadron Leader Markham with a brittle stare.  \"How did this man get here?\" he asked sharply. \"He's been shot through the head!\"  Eighty-Four's senior officer squared his jaw just a bit and returned the other's hard stare.  \"We noted that fact, too, Colonel,\" he said evenly. \"A Messerschmitt was reported by spotters. My pilots went after it. Dawson, here, made contact with the enemy aircraft. As he was about to open fire this man was thrown out with his parachute opened. Dawson shot down the enemy aircraft, and then noting something peculiar about the man going down by parachute, he followed him to the ground and landed, Flying Officer Farmer landed also. They found the man just as you see him. Dawson flew him back here with the idea of contacting Intelligence. You recognize him, Colonel?\"  The Intelligence officer didn't answer. He turned to Dave, and the Yank born ace couldn't miss the look of worry and strain that had come into the man's dark eyes. He seemed on the point of exploding all over the place, but he didn't. He visibly clamped down hard on his inner emotions and spoke to Dave.  \"Tell me the story in your own words!\" he demanded.  The Intelligence officer's harsh tone of voice rubbed Dave's fur the wrong way. The Yank deliberately looked at Markham, and waited until the Squadron Leader nodded his head. Then for the third time Dave told his story. The Intelligence officer listened with a face set hard as granite. His only expression was in his eyes. And their expression was that of a man who is helplessly watching the efforts of weeks and months slip away from his grasp and dissolve in thin air.  \"Who is he, sir?\" Dave couldn't help blurting out as he finished.  \"My brother,\" Colonel Trevor said with startling bluntness. \"And the good right hand of British Intelligence.\"  The man emphasized his words with a curt nod, and then looked at Group Captain Ball.  \"This tears it!\" he said in a flat voice. \"Knocks the blasted props right out from under the whole thing. He was the main link. Everything depended on the messages he could get through to me. That he was caught, and brought back here so that we could confirm his death, means.... Well, it must mean that they've been onto him for some time. Perhaps, even, that he sent me information that they _wanted_ him to send. Blast the Nazis, anyway!\"  No one said anything for a moment or two, Markham, Dawson, and Freddy Farmer being completely in the dark, kept their mouths shut for obvious reasons. Group Captain Ball didn't say anything because he was deep in thought weighing Colonel Trevor's words. Presently he stuck out his lower lip and gave a little half shake of his head.  \"Possibly, Colonel,\" he said and fixed his thoughtful eyes on the distant horizon. \"And then again, possibly not. You forget that we checked everything through other channels, and found it to be true. I fancy the Nazis sent him back ... this way ... in the hope that you would take just that attitude. Would come to that conclusion at once.\"  The Intelligence officer frowned in perplexity and dragged a thumbnail along the angle of his jaw.  \"Then they don't know how much he sent through, eh?\" he murmured, as though summing it up to himself. \"Then this is a trick to make us believe they've had him under their eye all along, when actually they only unmasked him in the last day or so?\"  \"Frankly, yes,\" Group Captain Ball said. \"Consider the matter in this light, Colonel. If they have known about him for some time, what was there for them to gain by giving him rope, and letting him send through all that information? They couldn't possibly guess what our objective might be, for the plain reason we haven't yet made up our own minds. No, the risk would be too great, for them. He held too high a position in the Nazi Gestapo. Once caught the obvious thing would be to shoot him on the spot. An old Nazi custom, by the way. Certainly, shoot him and let British Intelligence worry as to what's happened to him. But, no. They shot him and brought him over here so that we could be _sure_ he was dead. Why? Because they don't _know_ what he was up to. By doing this they hope to convince us they know all about it. You follow me?\"  Colonel Trevor nodded slowly, and a tiny glimmer of hope seeped into his eyes.  \"Thank you, sir,\" he said quietly. \"I guess the shock sent my brain into a bit of a spin. Right you are. We'll carry on as we planned. Your squadron office a good place where we can talk, Markham?\"  The O.C. of Eighty-Four started slightly at the sudden question popped at him, then nodded.  \"Certainly, Colonel,\" he said. \"My Adjutant's there, but I'll get rid of him. And ... er, what do you want us to do about your brother, Colonel?\"  The Intelligence officer squared his shoulders and forced himself to look down at the dead man.  \"If you could have him placed in the hospital hut, Markham,\" he said softly. \"I'll arrange transportation elsewhere, later. Yes, if you could have him taken to the hospital hut. And, by the way, I don't want anybody, not even your medico, to touch him. There'll be an ... er, autopsy performed later.\"  Markham gave him a shrewd look, and then nodded.  \"Just as you wish, Colonel,\" he said. \"I'll give Corporal Sharron instructions, now, and then we'll go along to my office.\"  The O.C. of Eighty-Four called over the waiting non-com, gave him his orders, and then walked away with Colonel Trevor, and Group Captain Ball. Dave watched them until they were out of sight in the Squadron office. Then he turned suddenly to Freddy and started whipping his hand up and down the front of the English youth's tunic. Freddy knocked his hand away and went back a step.  \"You're not my valet!\" he cried. \"Drop it, my lad. What in the world do you think you're doing?\"  Dave grinned and reached out to whip the front of Freddy's tunic again.  \"A game that was all the rage in the States,\" Dave said. \"It was called, Handy. You make motions with your hands and the others try to guess what it means. This one is in two words, Freddy. Guess. I'll give you a tip. It's American slang.\"  \"Good grief, the chap's gone balmy again!\" Freddy groaned and beat off Dave's hand once more. \"Stop it, you crazy clown. Rubbish to your insane Yank games. What do you mean, two words? What two words?\"  \"What we just got, Freddy,\" Dave said. \"Come on! Be a sport and see if you can guess it. Then I'll let you try one on me.\"  \"I will not!\" Freddy snorted. \"Of all the silly rot! But what did we just get?\"  \"Okay, if you have to act dumb,\" Dave growled. \"The two words are, brush off. That's what we just got. The old brush-off. And not with as much as a thank you kindly. I don't think I like that Colonel Trevor. Too darn chummy, if you ask me.\"  \"He does sort of spill all over a chap, doesn't he,\" Freddy said with a half grin. Then wiping the grin away, \"Can't blame him, though, for being a bit uppish. It must have been a shock, seeing his brother like that. Poor beggar. But, I say, Dave, did you hear Group Captain Ball speak of him holding a high position in the Nazi Gestapo? What do you know about that!\"  \"Everything,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50400"],["title","Dave Dawson, Flight Lieutenant (#5)"],["body","also absolutely nothing,\" Dave grunted and looked over at the hospital hut where Corporal Sharron and his detail had taken the dead man. \"And did you hear him say there'd be an autopsy later, but sort of stumble over his words? I wonder what he meant by that? The bullet hole is proof enough how he died. This thing has all the ear-marks of a Scotland Yard case, or something. Or is that sort of thing a part of Intelligence routine?\"  Freddy Farmer cocked his head to one side and shrugged his shoulders.  \"Blessed if I know,\" he said. \"And blessed if I'm going to stay here looking like some department store window dummy. I just realized that I'm very hungry. How about you? Shall we have a spot of something or other before the next scramble alarm sounds?\"  \"The guy's stomach!\" Dave groaned. \"Nice juicy mystery on all sides, and the dope can only think of his _in_sides! Oh, well. Okay! I'd better go along and see that you leave something for night mess. But take it easy, Freddy. I heard Markham telling Adjutant Phipps something about transferring you to bombers for a spell. I think it was your name he mentioned. Of course, maybe....\"  \"What?\" Freddy gasped in stunned alarm. \"Dave! There's a chance I may be transferred to bombers? You heard that? But.... But, why?\"  Dave grinned and jabbed Freddy in the stomach with his thumb.  \"That,\" he said. \"If it gets too big to fit into a Spitfire, where else can it go but into a bomber, huh?\"  Freddy Farmer made gurgling sounds in his throat, and lunged. But Dave slipped away from his grasp and dashed for the mess lounge.     CHAPTER FIVE  _Nazi Intrigue_   With a helpful snack of food safely tucked away, Dave and Freddy were in the mess lounge thumbing through some magazines and papers when the squadron office orderly found them.  \"The C.O. wants to see you two officers at once,\" he said.  \"You wouldn't have any idea, eh, Sergeant?\" Dave asked and gave him a searching look.  \"Did he look mad, or anything like that, when he sent you after us?\" Freddy Farmer wanted to know.  The Sergeant grinned and shook his head.  \"I don't think so, sir,\" he said. Then gravely, \"Fact is, sir, he struck me as looking a bit worried, if you know what I mean. Like as if something had upset him. But, no, he didn't look mad.\"  \"Well, thank goodness for that!\" Dave breathed and looked at Freddy. \"I guess it doesn't mean bombers for you yet, pal. Thanks, Sergeant. We're on our way right now. Pull in your stomach, Freddy, and let's go.\"  \"Some day I'll die laughing at your silly jokes!\" the English youth growled, but he impulsively pulled in his stomach and pushed back his shoulders as he dropped into step.  A couple of minutes later they entered the Squadron Office. Markham was there, and so were Colonel Trevor, and Group Captain Ball. They started to salute but Group Captain Ball stopped them with a wave of his hand.  \"We'll forget formality for the time being, Gentlemen,\" he said with a smile. \"Make yourselves comfortable. We want to talk to you two for a spell. There, that's the idea.\"  The Group Captain nodded as the two boys seated themselves, then glanced at Markham.  \"You want me to do the talking, Markham, or would you rather?\" he asked.  The Squadron Leader instantly shook his head.  \"You, of course, sir,\" he said. \"You naturally know all the details better than I do.\"  \"As you wish, then,\" Group Captain Ball grunted, and looked back at Dave and Freddy. \"Well, what with the Balkans already in this blasted war, and a Nazi attack on Russia almost certain within a month or so, old Adolf is going to need all the troops he can get.\"  The Air Ministry official stopped short and smiled at the surprised look on the boys' faces. He chuckled, and nodded.  \"Oh, quite!\" he said. \"We've known for some time that Hitler was going to strike at Russia. When he does it will of course be quite a surprise to the rest of the world. Particularly to your civilian military experts back in America, Dawson. They've been having a jolly fine time on the radio and in the newspapers solving the Stalin riddle. Yes, I fancy they'll be the most surprised of the lot. And they'll be very annoyed at Adolf for not playing the game according to their views. However, be that as it may, we know definitely that Hitler _is_ going to make war on Russia, and soon!\"  The Group Captain paused and plucked at his lower lip as though deciding upon his next words.  \"Tremendous in size as the German army is,\" he said presently, \"it is not big enough for Hitler to wage intensive warfare on two fronts. He has not enough men, or enough material. It will be absolutely essential for him to withdraw a certain number of his forces from the occupied countries. And, when I say forces, I mean the Luftwaffe forces in particular. Now, if Hitler were to withdraw a large portion of his ground and air forces from the occupied countries what, in your opinion, would be the result, eh?\"  The Group Captain happened to be looking straight at Dave, so it was the Yank born R.A.F. ace who answered.  \"It would present a perfect opportunity for a British invasion of the Continent, sir,\" he said after a moment's thought.  \"And you, Farmer?\" the Group Captain asked, turning to the English youth.  Freddy flushed and looked slightly embarrassed, but he nodded his head.  \"I say the same as Dawson, sir,\" he replied. \"It would be a perfect opportunity for us to invade the Continent ... _provided_ we have sufficient troops, guns, and planes for the job.\"  \"And do you believe we have, Farmer?\" the Air Ministry official shot at him.  Freddy opened his mouth to speak, then closed it and shrugged.  \"I don't know, sir,\" he said after a short moment of hesitation. \"Frankly, I have not the knowledge whether we are well enough equipped, or not.\"  \"Exactly!\" Group Captain Ball cried and poked the air with his finger for emphasis. \"You do not know, and neither do thousands and thousands of others. Only a mere handful of men know the true strength of Britain's armed forces today. And Adolf Hitler _is not one of that group_. In other words, Hitler does _not know_ whether or not we would strike at him with an invasion of the Continent once he removes the bulk of his forces from the occupied countries. At the same time, though, Hitler is not such a fool ... insane as the man is ... as to leave himself wide open for an attack from our side of the Channel.\"  \"But if he withdraws the troops, and...?\" Dave began and stopped short.  \"He will withdraw his troops,\" Group Captain Ball interrupted. \"Never fear. The beggar has to, or run the risk of possible defeat on the eastern front. But how can he withdraw the major portion of his forces from the occupied countries, and still feel safe from attack by England? That has been the problem we have been struggling with for the past five weeks. Ever since his bandits marched into Yugoslavia. And we think we've got an inkling of the correct answer.\"  The Group Captain paused and looked at Colonel Trevor.  \"I think you'd better carry on from there, Colonel,\" he said. \"You've been in charge of that end of the thing.\"  The Intelligence officer nodded, studied his fingernails for a moment, and then looked up. The glint of worry, or sadness, was still in his eyes, but in them also was the glitter of hard boiled determination.  \"Some three weeks ago,\" he began, \"British Intelligence received word from one of its members who has been in Germany since long before the start of the war. This communication received was the first that had come through from this agent in some four months. He had been recorded in our files as missing or dead. So it was a great joy to all concerned to learn that he was still alive and operating.\"  Colonel Trevor paused to crush out the cigarette he was smoking, and clear his throat.  \"That agent was my brother,\" he continued presently. \"The dead man you saw thrown out of that Messerschmitt, Dawson. Today ... today was the first time he had been in England for four years! All that time he was in Germany, serving England. He actually became a member of their cursed Gestapo, and as such obtained much information about Hitler's plans that was of inestimable value to us. However, in those days we did not have a government in power that believed Adolf Hitler was nothing but a liar and a dirty murderer. Consequently practically all of my brother's reports were shelved, and ignored completely. He stuck at his job, however, and after we once got into the war ... and there was a fighting Prime Minister at Number Ten Downing Street ... my brother's efforts began to help us no end. But never mind that, now. It's all past history. It's events since receiving that communication about three weeks ago that we're interested in right now.\"  The Intelligence officer stopped talking again. Questions hovered on Dave's lips, but he had sense enough to keep his mouth shut. He waited outwardly calm, but inwardly on fire, for the Colonel to continue.  \"In that first communication,\" the Intelligence officer presently took up the thread of his talk, \"we learned for the first time of Hitler's plan to attack Russia, and of his intention to withdraw a large portion of his forces from the occupied countries. But, also, my brother included a sharp warning that an attempt by us to invade the Continent would be a risky venture with a very small chance of succeeding in our favor. Naturally, we in Intelligence wondered why our chances would be so slim. Assuming, of course, that we had the guns, planes, and men to tackle the job. However, there was no reason given in my brother's first communication. Only a sharp warning not to attempt the invasion, and a hint that there would be a second message coming through in a short time.  \"Well, it was five days before the second communication came through. And as luck would have it, it didn't help us very much. There was a repeat warning against an invasion attempt, but no concrete reason other than a veiled implication"]]]
