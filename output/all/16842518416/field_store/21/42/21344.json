And if I haven't mentioned it, thanks, pal. I was sort of close to getting lead poisoning just about then.\"  \"And we were both close to getting heaven knows what,\" young Farmer said. His face became hard, and deadly serious. \"To me it's still like a mad dream. Imagine it, Dave! Right here in London. It just can't be true! Balmy things like this just don't happen!\"  \"I know, of course not,\" Dawson grunted, and dropped to his knees beside the prostrate Hans. \"But Erich, there, wouldn't believe you, Freddy. _He_ found out. Let's search these rats for anything we can find, and then get out of here fast. I guess British Intelligence would like to hear what we have to tell them.\"  \"There's a phone in the next room, Dave,\" Freddy said, as he recalled the fact. \"The one that Erich used. Let's just tie them up, and then get on the phone. Intelligence may want them just as they are.\"  \"Maybe, but I'm a curious cuss,\" Dawson said with a dogged shake of his head. \"Truss up that bird with his belt, and then go phone the big shots. Me, I'm going to see what these birds have on them, if anything. I--Ye gods! Did Herr Baron's face slip!\"  Dave gulped out the last as he got his first really good look at Herr Baron's face. Freddy had half rolled the limp figure over, and at first look Herr Baron seemed to have been hit square in the face by a pan of soggy bread dough. His nose was over on one cheek, and his jaw was twice as big on one side at it was on the other, his eyebrows pointed straight up, and his lips looked twisted all out of shape.  \"Good grief, the floor must have done that!\" Freddy Farmer gasped as he looked down. \"Make-up paste, no less, Dave. Why--why, he hasn't really got any real face. It's horrible!\"  \"Just truss him up and leave him, Freddy,\" Dawson said, and swallowed hard several times. \"I guess the rat was in some kind of an accident, and did his own plastic surgery with make-up paste, or whatever that stuff is. Sweet tripe! This thing gets screwier and screwier. Truss him up, and then get British Intelligence over here in a hurry. We'll--Hey, I'm nuts! We don't even know where we are!\"  \"That's simple, old thing,\" Freddy said, and lashed Herr Baron's arms behind his back with the man's own belt. \"A fine detective you'd make. British Intelligence can simply trace my call, that's all, and be over here in no time.\"  \"Call me dunce, and get going, pal!\" Dawson said with a sigh of relief. \"Sure, of course, kid. Boy, maybe old age is slowing me down at that.\"  \"Not judging from what I saw just recently!\" Freddy Farmer said, as he got to his feet, and headed for the side door of the room. \"Be back in a jiffy, old thing.\"  Dave just grunted, completed his job of making sure that Hans would give no trouble should he come to, and then went systematically through the man's pockets. He collected the usual amount of personal belongings, but the man's papers were very interesting. They were all made out and officially stamped to identify him as a born Englishman, by the name of John Dobbler, with an East London address.  Dawson thumbed through them for a moment, and then stuffed them into his pocket and moved over to Erich's dead body. And what he found in the dead man's pockets made him realize all the more to what pains Nazi agents go. There was nothing on Erich's person to indicate that he was a Nazi. But everything to prove that he was one Harold Cabot, an Englishman who lived at an address in the Cheapside part of London. As a matter of fact, Erich's papers went Hans' one better. Erich also had identification as an Air Raid Warden.  \"An Air Raid Warden, the dirty skunk!\" Dawson grated, and put Erich's papers into his pocket, too. \"I wonder how many of the poor devils he left to die under piles of bomb rubble?\"  With a look of scorn and loathing for the dead man, he got to his feet and went over to the prostrate form of the man referred to as Herr Baron. The false face still looked the same, and the Yank air ace tried not to look at it as he went through the pockets of the man's uniform. What he found so amazed him and angered him that for a moment he trembled with loathing and blazing anger. Herr Baron's papers, all strictly official and military, showed that he was an American colonel in the Yank Air Forces, that he was commanding officer of such and such group, but that of recent date he was attached to Air Forces Intelligence in England.  \"The dirty--!\" Dawson began, and then words failed him.  He put a hand to his forehead, and closed his eyes tight for a moment. Like Freddy Farmer, he was almost inclined to believe that all this just hadn't happened. That he was having a wild, crazy dream, and that he would wake up soon to find that everything was all right. But it wasn't a dream; it was cold, stark truth, incredible as it seemed. Three Nazis of no less than Herr Himmler's brood, yet two carried perfect identification as Englishmen. And the third, definite identification as a colonel serving in the U. S. Army Air Forces.  \"But it just doesn't make sense!\" Dawson muttered, and stared at Herr Baron's picture with the official Air Forces stamp imprinted on it. \"How in the world did he get away with it? If I could tell that his face was faked, anybody else could have spotted the same thing. I don't see how the--\"  He cut the rest short as something peculiar about the man's left tunic lapel caught his eye. He reached out a hand and felt of the lapel. His heart leaped, and in the next instant he had whipped out his jackknife and was slashing at the lapel seams. When he had cut an opening big enough, he thrust his fingers inside and felt a thin inch by inch and a half leather-covered book. He pulled it out to see that it was a worn address and memo book that had several pages missing. And when he thumbed through those that were left it was to discover that they were filled with countless numbers. Some of them in groups, and some of them but a single number. All were written in a fine hand with a needle-sharp indelible pencil.  \"Code, of course,\" he grunted. \"British Intelligence will break it down soon enough, and--\"  Dawson stopped and sat up straight.  \"Speaking of British Intelligence,\" he grunted, \"what's Freddy doing on that telephone? Making a date with the operator?\"  As there was only one way to get the answer to his question, he got to his feet, went over to the side door and pushed it open.  \"Hey, Freddy, what--?\" he began, and stopped short.  The room beyond was a well furnished bedroom. Included in the furnishing were twin beds with a little night table between them. On the night table there was a French phone, but the instrument was in its pronged cradle. Most important of all, though, there wasn't hide nor hair of Freddy Farmer. Dawson gaped for a moment as though he couldn't believe his eyes. Then he shook himself out of his trance and leaped into the room.  \"Freddy!\" he yelled, and looked wildly about. \"Hey! Where are you, Freddy?\"  Four walls sent back the echo of his voice, and that was all. There was no other reply to his yell. He noticed what was obviously the bathroom door on the other side of the room, and to the right of the twin beds. In three leaps he crossed the room and yanked the door open. It led to the bathroom right enough, but there was still no Freddy Farmer to be seen.  \"What the heck?\" he gasped, and his heart started to chill slightly. \"Where is the guy, anyway? He couldn't have just disappeared through solid walls. Ah!\"  The last slipped off his lips as a blast of cool night air blew against his face, and he saw that the window over the bathtub was open. A split second later he saw the prints of more than one pair of feet on the edge of the bathtub. One look and he was up on the edge of the bathtub himself, and sticking his head and shoulder out the window. For a moment he couldn't see a thing because of the darkness of night. Even the light that poured through into the bathroom from the bedroom, and out the opened window, didn't reveal anything in those first few seconds.  Then as his eyes quickly adjusted themselves he saw that there was a flat roof some four feet below the level of his eyes. It was really the main roof of the building; the apartment he was in being the English conception of a penthouse. To the right and left were the motionless darker shadows of chimneys and building ventilation vents. He opened his mouth to call out Freddy's name when suddenly off to his right came the scuffing of feet on the gravel-topped roof, and then the clear bark of a gun and a sharp cry of anger or pain.  The bark of the gun was still ringing in Dawson's ears as he went head first through the opened window and landed heavily on all fours on the gravel roof. He paused a second to get his breath; then, with Hans' Luger clutched in his hand, he went sneaking silently forward toward the spot whence had come the scuffing of feet, the sharp cry, and the shot. He bumped into a vent pipe that he didn't see in the darkness, and almost went to his knees. As he fought to maintain his balance he plainly heard running feet a short distance off to his right. He jerked his head around in time to see a running shadow etched against the London sky. He whirled and brought up his gun.  \"Hold it!\" he rasped out. \"Hold it, and get your hands up!\"  The running shadow ducked down, and in practically the same instant the night stabbed red flame, and a wasp of death whined by Dawson's face almost before he heard the crack of the shot. He ducked instinctively, and lost the running shadow before he could return the fire.  \"Keep low, Dave!\" he heard Freddy Farmer's voice to his left. \"Two of the beggars, and they are both armed. Keep low and watch the fire escape on the rear side. Only way they can get off--\"  If Freddy Farmer said any more Dawson didn't hear it. He was in the act of turning and moving toward the rear"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50635"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Eighth Air Force (#7)"],["body"," the building roof when something moved in front of him, and a thunderbolt slashed down out of nowhere to hit him on the head. As his knees turned to rubber, and buckled, he flung out his arms in a desperate effort to grab hold of something that would help him remain on his feet. But there was nothing but thin air there to grab hold of, and he fell headlong on the roof. Whether he was hit by another thunderbolt, or it was just hitting the gravel-topped roof, he didn't know, but in the next second he had lost consciousness of everything. Everything, save that he was spilling down into a huge bottomless hole that was filled with pitch darkness and utter silence. And then even that was no more.     CHAPTER SIX  _When England Stood Alone!_   A thousand little demons romping through Dave Dawson's head with sharp pointed spears gradually dragged the Yank air ace back to consciousness. He opened his eyes, and then instantly closed them as the sun itself seemed to be perched on the end of his nose. He groaned and sucked air into his aching lungs.  \"Steady, Dave, old fellow,\" he heard Freddy Farmer say. \"You got bashed a good one that time. Anybody else's head would have been caved right in. But just take it easy. Everything's all right now.\"  \"Yeah, everything's just dandy!\" Dawson heard his own voice mutter. \"What happened? Did I jump without my 'chute, or--Hold everything!\"  Dawson choked out the rest, opened his eyes, and forced them to stay open until the so-called sun perched on his nose didn't bother him any more. It was then he found himself stretched out on one of the twin beds, with the ceiling light directly overhead. Freddy Farmer, whose uniform looked as if it had been passed through a meat chopper in a terrible hurry, was seated on the edge of the bed with a damp towel in his hands. Dawson started to sit up, but Freddy pushed him on the chest to force him back, and then put the damp towel across his forehead.  \"Stay put, Dave,\" he said. \"I guess you didn't hear me tell you to keep low.\"  \"Sure I did,\" Dawson grunted as the cool towel on his forehead seemed to drive most of the little demons from his brain. \"But some guy was keeping even lower, and he let me have it. But, look, I'm okay. I've got to sit up. That ceiling light is burning holes in my face. No, Freddy. I'm really okay. I'll feel better if I just sit up. Gosh, I wonder what that lug used, a sledge hammer?\"  Despite Freddy Farmer's disapproving look, and his restraining gesture, Dawson sat up on the bed, and struggled silently for a moment until the room stopped going around. Then when he could see clearly he looked at his flying pal.  \"Okay, what's the story?\" he said. \"And what bunch of cats did that clawing job on your uniform? Boy, you sure look like you'd been through something!\"  \"More than I could handle, blast it all!\" Freddy Farmer said, as a red flush started up his neck. \"I had just made my phone call to British Intelligence at the War Office when I saw that bathroom door move. I yelled and told whoever was there to come out, or I'd fire. Silly, of course, but the blasted words just popped off my tongue.\"  Young Farmer paused for a moment for breath. The redness was in his face by now.  \"Of course, whoever it was didn't oblige,\" he continued bitterly. \"I heard scraping noises beyond the door, and leaped over to it gun in hand, and all that sort of cinema hero stuff. I kicked open the door just in time to see some chap's hand disappear from the bathroom window sill. I pulled the door shut to cut off the light in here, and scrambled out the window myself. Nothing happened for a bit, and then I heard two voices whispering. Couldn't make out what they said, or in what language they were saying it. I leaped in that direction and bumped square into a blasted chimney. Then I heard running feet to my right. Rather than bother calling out I just gave a snap shot in the general direction. I hit one of them, because I heard a yelp of pain. And--\"  \"And that was just about the time I reached the roof,\" Dave Dawson said as Freddy ran out of breath. \"One of them fired at me. Then you called out. And then, bingo! One of them must have circled around to my side somehow, and let me have it on the head. Then what?\"  \"Then the very unsatisfactory ending,\" Freddy Farmer said gloomily. \"I heard them both at the rear of the roof. I went toward there as silently, and as fast as I could. I bumped into you. While I was trying to find out if you were dead, both of the blighters went down the fire escape and lost themselves. The only thing for me to do then was to get you back through the window and in here where I could have a look at you. And that took some doing. You weigh a ton, Dave. I sincerely recommend a strict diet. Lord, but you're heavy when you're unconscious.\"  But Dawson wasn't listening. He was scowling at his scratched and dirty hands, and at his own uniform that was almost as badly torn as Freddy's.  \"I wonder who they were?\" he presently said aloud. \"You didn't get a look at either of them?\"  \"Only that one chap's hand,\" Freddy replied. \"The rest was just moving shadows. It was my fault for making a mess of it, Dave. I shouldn't have let that chap get out the bathroom window. How--?\"  The fuzzy note of the front door buzzer stopped the rest of Freddy Farmer's sentence. Both boys looked at each other, and then got up off the bed in a hurry.  \"The guys from British Intelligence!\" Dawson said, and headed for the living room door. \"From the time it took them to get here, this joint must be up in Scotland!\"  \"Well, we'll soon know where it is, anyway, thank heaven!\" Freddy Farmer breathed as he followed Dawson through the door into the living room. \"I certainly--_oof!_\"  Young Farmer's lungs were emptied of air as he plowed face first into Dawson, who had pulled up to an abrupt stop. With an effort Freddy held his balance and stared past Dawson.  \"What--?\" he began. Then, with a gasp, \"I say, Dave, what did you do with them?\"  \"I didn't!\" Dawson mumbled, and stared popeyed at the completely vacant living room. \"I--They--I mean, one was dead, and the other two were trussed up for keeps. But they _aren't here_, Freddy! They've gone! Doggone it! That guy, Erich, was dead, I tell you. But he's upped and walked away. Away where?\"  The door buzzer rang again, more insistently this time, but neither of the youths paid any attention to it. Like men struck dumb they gaped at the living room floor where the figures of three Nazis should have been, but where actually there were only some bloodstains to mark where they had once been.  \"I think I'm going nuts!\" Dave mumbled, and drew a hand across his forehead. \"Stark raving nuts. Now you see it, and now you don't. I--Hey! The buzzer!\"  With a yelp Dawson snapped out of his trance, raced to the foyer door, went through it and hurried to the front door and unlocked it. And just in time, too. A British colonel out in the hallway was just stepping back, service revolver in hand, preparatory to shooting out the lock. The officer lowered his gun the instant he saw Dawson, but his eyes widened at what he saw.  \"What the devil's going on, Captain?\" he demanded. \"We traced a phone call from this apartment. We're British Intelligence.\"  The officer nodded to a captain and a lieutenant standing just behind him. Dawson swung the door open wider and stepped to one side.  \"Yes, sir, I know,\" he said. \"And plenty's happened. You'd better come in, sir.\"  \"Quite,\" the colonel grunted, and walked into the foyer, followed by his two junior officers. \"Where to now?\"  \"This way, sir,\" Dave said as he led the way toward the living room. \"But I guess there's some explaining to do first.\"  Dawson was continuing talking, but decided not to and led the way into the living room. Marked relief showed on Freddy Farmer's face as he saw the snappy British uniforms. He stiffened and clicked his heels, but did not salute as he did not have his hat on. Then suddenly his dirtied face cracked in a glad and welcoming smile.  \"_You_, sir!\" he cried. \"Did you take my call, sir? But it's so long, sir, that of course I wouldn't have recognized your voice.\"  \"What's that?\" the colonel said sharply. Then his jaw dropped and his face lighted up. He looked from Farmer to Dave Dawson, all smiles. \"Well, bless me!\" he cried. \"It has been years and years, hasn't it? And what you've two done for the cause since then!\"  As the colonel grasped Freddy Farmer's outstretched hand Dave looked at him in puzzled amazement. Then memory came rushing back in a hurry.  \"Well, knock me for a--!\" he gulped, and then checked himself. \"Colonel Fraser, Chief of British Intelligence! Gee, sir, but it's good to see you. Why--why, it was way back in Forty that you sent us on that show at Antwerp, wasn't it?\"  \"Absolutely, Dawson!\" the colonel said as he shook hands. \"And a splendid job you two did. My word! Fancy meeting you two. I heard you were with the Yanks and going great guns. But let me introduce my officers. Captain Small and Lieutenant Faintor, I want you to meet two chaps who did an awful lot for England back in the dark days. Captains Farmer, and Dawson.\"  There was hand shaking all around, and then Colonel Fraser got right down to cases again.  \"But what's all this?\" he demanded, and waved a hand at their torn uniforms. \"What happened? You said something on the wire about catching three Nazi agents, and needing help at once. We came hopping it across London, but the blasted blackout, and the detours, took time. Now, what's it all about?\"  \"That's the sad part of the story, sir,\" Dawson said, making a wry face. \"But we'll give all of it to you that we can.\"  Some ten minutes later Dawson and Freddy Farmer had finished their combined word picture of their crazy adventure. Colonel Fraser and his two junior officers listened in wide-eyed silence. By the time the two U. S. Army Air Forces aces finished speaking a strange look had come into Colonel Fraser's eyes, and"]]]
