His face was lined and wrinkled from countless hours on the bridge in fair weather and bad. And it was the color of well tanned saddle leather, save a spot on each cheek that was apple red. The eyes were small and set wide apart, but in their depths was a glint that gave you the feeling the man could see right through six inch steel armor. All in all, Captain Standers looked quite capable of leaping overboard and shoving his cruiser back into deep water should it ever run aground.  He swept the two R.A.F. youths with his gimlet eyes as they entered his quarters and saluted.  \"At ease, Gentlemen,\" he said in a voice that could double for a foghorn. \"Be seated. It seems that news of your coming to Singapore has traveled ahead of you. I have a wireless, here, from Air Vice Marshal Bostworth, of Singapore Air Base. He has made a request regarding you two.\"  \"Air Vice Marshal Bostworth, of Singapore Base!\" Dawson gasped as the Cruiser's captain paused for breath. \"But there must be some mistake, sir. I mean, we saw Air Vice Marshal Bostworth just before we left England. It was he who okayed our request for transfer to duty with the Far East Fleet Air Arm.\"  Captain Standers snorted softly and gave Dawson a look as though he were some school kid who had fumbled his homework.  \"Quite, Flight Lieutenant,\" he said. \"But we've been at sea close to three weeks. It's quite possible to _fly_ from London to Singapore, via Egypt, in less than half that time.\"  \"Yes, sir, of course,\" Dave murmured as his face burned. \"I.... Well, it sort of startled me, sir.\"  \"Quite so,\" the Harkness' commander grunted. \"That is neither here nor there, however. The wireless is from Air Vice Marshal Bostworth, and it was sent from R.A.F. Base at Singapore. The request is for you two pilots to take one of the Harkness' planes aloft and cruise over the Singapore Strait for two hours and then proceed to the R.A.F. Base on the Island. Air Vice Marshal Bostworth will meet you there. You've got that all clear?\"  Freddy and Dave looked at each other, and their thoughts were identical. Was somebody trying to kid somebody, or something? Why in the world were they to take one of the Harkness' Bristol powered Fairey \"Swordfishes\" aloft and use up gas and oil for an hour or two? Why not go right on into the Johore Strait Naval Anchorage aboard the Harkness, and then step ashore to meet the Air Vice Marshal? It certainly didn't make sense, and the bewildered look that spread over each youth's face said as much to Captain Standers. He shrugged and made a little gesture with his hand.  \"Don't bother asking me questions,\" he said. \"I haven't the faintest idea what the answers should be. Sounds like so much R.A.F. rubbish, I fancy. However, the request has the approval of the Base Admiral, so there's only one thing I can do about it. Assign you to one of our planes, and let you go your way.\"  \"Begging your pardon, sir,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up, his face slightly crimson, \"but was that all to the message? Just that we go aloft and spend two hours in the air before landing at Singapore R.A.F. Base?\"  \"That was all, definitely,\" the Cruiser's captain replied. \"As a matter of fact, I didn't believe it myself and had the first message checked. The repeat was the same, however. Also, both messages were in a new emergency code. You say you saw Air Vice Marshal Bostworth just before you left England?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" the boys replied in one voice.  \"I see,\" the senior officer murmured. Then flinging them a keen look, \"He didn't mention anything about coming out to Singapore himself? Didn't say he might have a job for you two to do out here? The three of us know that Air Vice Marshal Bostworth is connected with Air Intelligence. And, naturally, your service records are not exactly deep dark secrets. You aren't, perhaps, as ignorant of what all this crazy business means as you appear to be, eh?\"  The two R.A.F. pilots grinned, but they both shook their heads.  \"Sorry, sir, but it's as much of a mystery to us,\" Freddy Farmer spoke for them. \"Air Vice Marshal Bostworth didn't even give us an inkling that he might be coming out here. It really is surprising news to us, sir.\"  Captain Standers hesitated as though about to speak, then thought better of it and pushed up onto his feet.  \"Well, one can't know about everything in this blasted war, I fancy,\" he grunted. \"You two had better get on with it. Use the plane on Catapult Number Three. I've already told the signal officer to make ready. Good luck. And, by the way!\"  \"Yes, sir?\" the two pilots murmured as the Cruiser's commander paused and scowled at his gnarled hands.  \"When you finally land at Singapore R.A.F. Base,\" he finally said, \"please mention to Air Vice Marshal Bostworth that I'd jolly well like to have the plane back before we put to sea again. Planes are hard enough to get as it is. Well, luck to you anyway.\"  Some twenty minutes later Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer were seated in a pontoon fitted, Bristol Pegasus engined Fairey \"Swordfish\" mounted on the starboard launching arm of Number Three catapult. The engine was ticking over and the Signal Officer standing on the flight bridge was ready to \"shoot\" the plane off into the air as soon as Dave at the controls gave him the signal.  Checking his engine instruments for the last time, the Yank R.A.F. ace turned in the seat and looked back at his English pal.  \"All set for the mystery ride, Freddy?\" he called out.  Young Farmer made a face and nodded.  \"Let her go, Dave,\" he replied. \"But I certainly hope these two hours whizz by, so's we can land at Singapore Base and find out what in the world this all means!\"  \"You and me both!\" Dave grunted. \"I've been given a lot of screwy orders in my time, but this one is certainly tops. Oh, well, we'll get a nice look at this neck of the Far East, anyway. Okay! Hold your hat. The balloon's going up!\"  Turning front, Dave nodded to the waiting signal officer, and automatically braced his body and put his head firmly against the back rest, so that it wouldn't be snapped back when the launching \"trigger\" was pulled. A couple of seconds later the Swordfish's engine was roaring out its mighty song of power and straining at the locking-dogs that held it on the catapult arm. Another second and it was as though an invisible giant had slammed the rear end of the plane with the side of a barn door, or something. The Swordfish leaped forward like a scared cat. It shot off the end of the catapult arm, sank toward the water for a brief instant, then rose upward as the whirling prop bit into the air and produced flying speed.  Once clear and curving upward, Dave throttled slightly and held the nose on a gentle climb toward Heaven. He turned and grinned at Freddy and then glanced down back at the Harkness cutting through the sun flooded waters of the China Sea like a perfectly streamlined battle grey fish. For a moment signal flags that spelled out G-O-O-D L-U-C-K fluttered in the wind, then they were hauled down and the Harkness began falling far astern of the climbing plane. Dave looked front again, leveled off at a comfortable six thousand feet and relaxed comfortably in the seat.  \"Ladies and Gentlemen!\" came Freddy Farmer's voice to his ears. \"On the far left you have the British owned island of Singapore. Just above it is the Malay Peninsula where they produce about eighty per cent of all the rubber in the world. And tin, also. A bit more to the north is French Indo-China. Far to the right are the Philippines. And way in back of you are the Dutch East Indies, including Borneo and Sumatra. If you smoke cigars, Ladies and Gentlemen, you should be doubly interested in Sumatra because the famous Sumatra leaf used as an outside wrapper for many, many brands of cigars comes from Sumatra. Personally, I'm not very interested because I do not smoke cigars. However....\"  \"However, shut up, Professor!\" Dave interrupted with a laugh. \"We can see it all, and we studied all about these parts when we were in school. But ... there is one question I would like to ask the learned Professor.\"  \"Certainly, my child, certainly,\" Freddy Farmer replied. \"Go right ahead. What do you want to know?\"  \"Boy, are you sticking your chin out!\" Dave chuckled. \"Okay! Why _are_ we flying around up here, Professor?\"  \"Good Lord, I should have suspected that!\" Freddy Farmer groaned. \"Well, it's a secret. A very deep dark secret. Only one man knows. And so far he hasn't told anybody. He.... Hey, Dave!\"  \"Don't shout, I haven't jumped out, yet,\" Dave cried and turned quickly around. \"What...?\"  Dave stopped short and stared hard at his pal. Freddy Farmer was leaning way forward to the right and gaping puzzle eyed down at the rolling surface of the China Sea far ahead. He didn't switch his gaze to Dave's face. He simply made a little movement with one hand and kept his eyes riveted on something ahead.  \"Take a look way out there, Dave!\" he shouted. \"I thought I saw some flashes of light.\"  \"Light?\" Dawson echoed sharply. \"This time of day? Are you nuts, or just seeing things?\"  \"I saw something!\" the English youth said. \"At least I'd be willing to swear to it. Sort of flashes of light, as though some surface ship were signaling by mirror. You know, by heliograph.\"  Dave didn't make any comment to that for a moment or two. He had turned front and was sweeping the waters ahead and below with his eyes. However, that was all he saw. Just a limitless expanse of robin's egg blue water that was streaked and smeared with the gold of the blazing sun. True, the rays of the sun bouncing off the rolling blue swells seemed to shower up clusters of golden specks in all directions that dazzled his eyes. But no matter how hard he strained his eyes he could see not the slightest sign of a surface ship, to say nothing of the telltale ribbon of smoke trailing back from her stacks. Eventually he gave it up and turned to look at his pal"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],["title","Dave Dawson at Singapore (#2)"],["body","n.  \"Is this some kind of a gag?\" he demanded. \"Or did you really see something? Maybe it was just sunbeams dancing off the water, huh?\"  Freddy Farmer wiped a hand across his eyes, sighed and shrugged.  \"Maybe,\" he said in a puzzled voice. \"But, if so, it's the first time I ever saw sunbeams send out dots and dashes.\"  \"Dots and dashes?\" Dave echoed. \"Did you catch any of them? The letters, I mean?\"  \"Too fast,\" Freddy said with a shake of his head. \"And what little I did catch didn't mean any letters in the Morse Code. But ... maybe I was just seeing things. Sorry.\"  Dave grinned and winked, and turned front once more.  \"Think nothing of it, my little pal,\" he said. \"Even the best of us make mistakes now and....\"  Dave clamped his lips shut on the last, sat up straight in the seat and stared hard down at the water to his right and some four or five miles away. Perhaps it actually was a sunbeam dancing back up at him, but for a brief instant he was certain he had seen four or five rapid flashes of light down on the surface of the water. Another moment and he was positive beyond all shadow of a doubt. There was a light flashing down there on the water. Rather it was the reflection of the sun's rays on a heliograph mirror. However, the flashes were both long and short, and Dave didn't have to look twice to realize perfectly well that some kind of a message was being flashed from down there on the water.  \"But how, and who's doing it?\" Dave gulped out the question aloud. \"Unless I'm completely nuts, or stone blind, there's nothing but water down there. Hey, Freddy!\"  \"Yes, I see it, too,\" the English youth spoke up. \"Thought I'd let you see it for yourself this time. What do you make of it, Dave? A bit weird, isn't it?\"  \"And a lot more than that!\" Dave grunted and was uncomfortably conscious of an eerie tingling at the back of his neck. \"I don't see a darn thing else but water and that flashing light. Hey! Do you suppose it could be a sheet of metal, or something, that's being caught by the sun as it rides those swells?\"  \"It could be, but I'm sure it isn't!\" Freddy Farmer replied in a tight voice. \"Dave, those are real dot and dash signals. Three dots--two dashes, then one dot and four dashes. Neither of those are Morse Code letters. Or International Morse, either. But, I'll eat my parachute pack if those aren't some kind of signals.\"  \"Check and double check!\" Dave grunted and scowled.  On impulse he took his eyes off the strange flashing signals far below and ahead, and twisting all the way around in the seat he took a good look at the surrounding heavens. Finally, he lowered his eyes to meet Freddy Farmer's puzzled gaze.  \"Notice something else, Freddy, that seems to be a little out of whack?\" he asked.  The English born R.A.F. ace took a quick look around, and shook his head.  \"Can't say I do,\" he said. \"Unless you mean us tooting around up here for no apparent reason ... at least, not to us. Why? What do you mean?\"  Dave made a little gesture with one hand that included a sweep of the surrounding air.  \"Just that,\" he said. \"Full of nothing but sky and air. How come? How come we're the only plane that's burning gas and oil in these parts? Why isn't there a sign of any Singapore Base planes out on patrol? Particularly the U-boat patrol planes. Don't they care any more if supply ships heading for Singapore get torpedoed? In short, where is everybody?\"  \"By jove, that's right, Dave!\" Freddy Farmer breathed with a catch in his voice. \"Of course, they may have scared U-boats and surface raiders away from here for good, yet.... Yet you'd think they'd still maintain some kind of daylight patrol just in case.\"  \"Took the words right out of my mouth,\" Dawson said with a grave nod. \"Of course, it is the month of December, and maybe they've declared a truce out here until Xmas comes and goes. But it's darn queer. No planes in the air. No ships on the water. Even the Harkness is out of sight, now. Just us.\"  \"And those queer light flashes down there,\" Freddy Farmer added. \"Dave! I think we should....\"  \"Doggone right!\" Dave cut in and shoved the stick forward. \"We'll take us a better look anyway. Hang on, pal! These Swordfish jobs lose altitude in plenty hurry!\"     CHAPTER THREE  _The Voice of Doom_   Dave wasn't kidding when he said that an aerial torpedo carrying Fairey Swordfish can go down in a hurry. The plane streaked seaward like a meteor in high gear. Dave held it in its steep dive until the rolling blue swells of the China sea came rushing up a little too close for comfort. Skillfully working the controls, he leveled off and shot the plane forward toward the spot where they had first noticed the weird flashes of light.  There were no flashes of light to be seen now, however. There was nothing but sun flooded rolling water. Dave stared hard, and so did Freddy Farmer, too. But it was just a waste of eyesight for all the good it did them.  \"That makes us nuts, Freddy!\" Dave sang out. \"I don't see a thing, do you?\"  \"Not a thing!\" Freddy called to him. \"I fancy it must have been the sun's rays playing tricks on the water.\"  \"Well, some trick, is all I've got to say,\" Dave grunted and climbed the Swordfish slightly for a better look. \"The same combinations of dots and dashes were repeated over and over again.\"  \"I know,\" Freddy said. \"Like a blasted call signal on the short-wave radio. If they'd been different and jumbled up then you could put it down to sunlight bouncing off the water, but ... _Dave!_ To the left! To the left! See that spot of white water? Foam? Dave! There's something there!\"  Dave had already snapped his eyes to the left and was staring at a patch of foamy white water on the surface of the seemingly limitless stretch of rolling blue. The white foamy patch was there for a very good reason. It was the telltale wake left by a diving submarine. And even as Dave realized that he caught sight of a long cigar shaped shadow sliding forward just under the surface of the water.  \"That's a submarine, Dave!\" Freddy Farmer's excited voice confirmed Dawson's belief at practically the same instant. \"It was on the surface and signalling us, but we couldn't see anything but the flash signals.\"  \"Sure, so what?\" Dave growled and veered the Swordfish around toward the shadow of the undersea craft. \"But why signal _us_? And, also, why signal us and then dive when we start to come down? Our markings are plain enough.\"  \"Maybe it's a German U-boat!\" Freddy cried excitedly.  \"Maybe,\" Dave said with a shrug. \"But it still doesn't make sense. _Why_ was the guy signalling to us?\"  \"Maybe he wasn't signalling to us,\" Freddy Farmer ventured.  Dave snorted and made a little gesture with his free hand.  \"Then who was he signalling to?\" he demanded. \"The man in the moon above us? I took a good look, Freddy. I'll swear on a ten foot stack of bibles that we're the only plane aloft in these parts. No, that underwater boat was signalling to us, and....\"  He left the rest hanging in midair as he suddenly saw the moving shadow of the submarine grow clearer and clearer as it rose to the surface. A moment later the surface of the blue water boiled white and the conning tower mast and hatch rose up into view. Another moment and the whole bridge and decks were awash. Like a man in a dream Dave blinked his eyes at the strange sight. It was a submarine sure enough, but it was of a type he had never seen in his life. And what was even more astonishing, it was painted a dull greenish blue to make it blend in well nigh perfectly with the surrounding waters.  \"Good Lord!\" Freddy Farmer gasped. \"What is it? Nazi, or one of our new types? And look at those two bow guns, Dave. And.... Dave! Look at those seamen spill out of that opened conning tower hatch! They're coming out like blasted rabbits. Get closer to the thing. It's like something out of a fairy story book.\"  Dave Dawson only half heard his friend's exclamations, for all of his attention and his eyes were fixed on the strange craft just off and below the left wings. Just as Freddy Farmer had said, the figures of seamen were popping out of the opened conning tower hatch like rabbits out of a hat. They looked neither German nor English. They were all short and stocky, and they moved about as though operated by strings held by invisible hands.  Wide eyed, Dave stared at them; watched them pop out and go scrambling down the bridge ladder and forward toward the bow. And then things happened so fast that both Dave and Freddy were too stunned and paralyzed to even think, let alone move. The two forward guns were swung around toward them, covers were ripped off, and in the next instant the muzzle of each gun belched out smoke and flame, and the Swordfish heeled over drunkenly on the opposite wings as though it had crashed full out into an invisible brick wall suspended in the sky.  A thousand steel fists hammered against Dave's body and his brain became filled with flashing white light. As though from a million miles away he heard the wild, excited yells from Freddy Farmer's lips. He heard also the scream of the Bristol Pegasus engine over-revving. And, although he was not conscious of doing so, he reached out and cut the ignition and hauled back the throttle with a single movement of his hand.  Then, just as suddenly as the flashing white light had filled his brain, the light disappeared, and he realized that the plane was cutting crazily down sidewise toward the rolling blue swells that were now perilously close. The engine cowling looked as though it had been hit by a twenty-ton tank. The metal was hanging in gleaming ribbons. And as for the engine itself, one whole side of the powerful radial engine was just so much mangled junk.  Sight and action became one for Dave. Even as he saw what the exploding shell from the mysterious submarine's gun had done, he slammed on opposite control hard and slowly got the Swordfish back onto even keel. But shell fragments had parted a couple of the"]]]
