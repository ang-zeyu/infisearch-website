The shipping news continued to give sparsely phrased notice of the location and size of the silver sea. Two naval vessels were assigned to observe it, reporting regularly to the meteorological bureau.  It must be recorded to the credit of that much-maligned department of weather forecasts and maritime information that it was probably the first body to see the possibilities of evil that lay in the silver sea.  It had quantities of the silvery mass of animalcules brought to it for study, and set its scientists to work to try and find a means of destroying them. Fish would not eat them. They seemed to possess some repulsive taste that led all the carnivorous fishes to avoid them at all costs. Placed in an aquarium with a huge sea bass that was exceptional for its voracity, the sea bass avoided the tiny, jellylike mass as it would the plague.  The silver globule of jelly multiplied in size, and still the sea bass avoided it, retreating to the farthest corners of its tank to keep from coming in contact with the little animalcules. At last the aquarium was a shimmering mass of silvery, sticky jelly, and the bass was unable to retreat farther. It was found gasping out its life outside the tank, having leaped from the water to escape from the omnipresent silver menace.  The silver sea grew in size. It began to figure in the news again, when passengers on the transatlantic liners noticed that the steamers were taking a route much farther to the north than was customary. It was admitted at the steamship offices that the detour was made for the purpose of avoiding, the now vast silver sea.  Late in March people along the eastern coast of the United States began to remark upon a musklike, slimy smell that was faintly discernible in the sea breeze. A steamer, going from New York to Bermuda, reported seeing a patch of the silvery jelly only three hundred miles from the eastern coast. The disagreeable, musklike smell was strong and noticeable.  The newspapers woke to the possibilities of the silver sea. Ships could not navigate in its jellied waters, nor fish swim. It covered thousands of square miles now, and was growing with an ominous steadiness that foreboded ill.  The seaside resorts along the Atlantic coast were practically abandoned. Tourists would not stay where that foul, slimy, musklike scent was borne to them constantly on the sea breeze. The patches that were the forerunners of the silver sea itself appeared along the coast. At last the horizon disappeared.  The silver sea had come close, indeed, to the shore. Then every newspaper burst into huge headlines. For the different papers they were phrased differently, but the burden of each, displayed in the largest possible type, was                        COASTAL NAVIGATION STOPPED!      America's Communication With the World Cut Off By Silver     Sea.--Harbor Blocked from Maine to Georgia.--Authorities Helpless     to Fight Silver Menace.  Then the world began to be afraid.     IV.   Davis was unwontedly silent as Gerrod drove him out to the tiny cottage to which he had been invited.  \"Evelyn's expecting you,\" said Gerrod as the little motor car wound up a hill between banks of fragrant trees that line the road on either side. \"We rather looked for you last week, but you wired, you know.\"  \"Yes, I know,\" said Davis gloomily. \"I went somewhere else.\"  Gerrod smiled. Davis was sufficiently his friend to break an engagement and admit it frankly, and besides Gerrod more than suspected where Davis had gone.  \"How is Miss Morrison?\" he asked.  \"She's all right,\" said Davis still more gloomily. \"But damn her father!\"  Gerrod raised his eyebrows and said nothing until they arrived at the cottage with the little built-on laboratory. Evelyn came out at the sound of the motor and shook hands with Davis.  \"We were beginning to be afraid the competition was too much for us,\" she said with a smile.  Davis looked at her and tried to smile in return, but the result was a dismal failure.  \"Oh, I'm glad to be here now,\" he said dolefully.  Gerrod made a sign to Evelyn not to refer to Nita again until he could speak to her, and helped Davis carry his two suit cases into the house.  \"Your usual room, of course,\" he said cheerfully. \"Dinner is served at the same hour as before, and you can do just as you please until you feel like coming down. I'll be in the laboratory.\"  Davis went heavily upstairs, his usually cheerful face suffused with gloom. Evelyn glanced at Gerrod.  \"What's the matter?\" she asked quickly. \"Has he quarreled with Nita?\"  Gerrod shook his head, smiling.  \"I asked about her, and he answered by damning her father. I suspect he has run against a little paternal opposition.\"  Evelyn's eyes twinkled and she laughed.  \"Best thing in the world for them,\" she declared. \"When he's ripe for it I'll take a hand. Nita Morrison was a classmate of mine in college and I know her well enough to help along.\"  Gerrod chuckled.  \"He was like a funeral all the way out. We'll let him alone until he wants to talk, and then you can advise him all you like. But just now I want to get back at those small animals that are raising so much particular Cain.\"  He went into the laboratory and slipped off his coat. He had a number of test tubes full of the silvery animalcules and was examining them under all sorts of test conditions to determine their rate of growth and multiplication.  He was rather hopeful that he would be able to demonstrate that after a certain period they would--because of their extremely close packing together--either die from inability to obtain nourishment or be poisoned from their own secretions.  He was looking curiously at a phenomenon that always puzzled him when Davis came into the room. His expression was that of a man utterly without hope.  \"What've you got there?\" he asked listlessly.  \"Some of our silvery little pets,\" said Gerrod cheerfully. \"I'm studying them in their native lair. Have you looked at them under a microscope?\"  \"No.\"  Gerrod smeared a bit of the silvery mess on a glass slide and put it under a microscope. He worked busily for a moment or so, adjusting the focus, and then waved Davis toward the eyepiece.  \"They're funny little beasts. Look them over.\"  Davis looked uninterestedly, but in a moment even his gloom was lightened by the interest of the sight he saw. The enlargement of the microscope was so great that only a few of the tiny animals were visible, but each of them was clearly and brilliantly outlined.  They were little jellylike creatures, roughly spherical in shape, with their bodies protected by almost infinitely thin, silicious shells that possessed a silvery luster. From dozens of holes in the fragile shells protruded fat, jellylike tentacles that waved and moved restlessly, forever in search of food.  Under the microscope the shells were partly transparent, and within the jellylike body inside the shell could be seen a single dark spot.  \"That blotch in their shells seems to be the nucleus, or else their stomach. I can't quite make out if they're one-celled animals like am[oe]b√¶, or if they're really complex creatures.\"  \"Rum little beggars,\" said Davis without removing his gaze from the eyepiece. \"They're separate animals, anyway. Odd that they should make a jellylike mass.\"  \"Move the slide about a little,\" suggested Gerrod. \"You'll see how they do that. You're looking at individuals now. Sometimes--and I think it's when food gets scarce--they twine their tentacles together and the tentacles actually seem to join, as if they were welded into one. In fact, as far as nourishment goes, they do seem to become a single organism. That's when they're so noticeably jellylike.\"  Davis watched them curiously for a few moments, and then straightened up. He moved restlessly about the room.  \"The funny thing,\" said Gerrod cheerfully, ignoring Davis' evident gloom, \"is that they seem to be able to move about. See this test tube? They've climbed up the sides of the glass until they almost reach the top.\"  \"I know,\" said Davis uninterestedly. \"When we took the crew off that yacht, they showed us where the jellylike mass seemed to be slowly creeping up the sides of the ship. Looked like exaggerated capillary action.\"  Gerrod listened with a thoughtful frown.  \"I wonder----\" he began, but Davis turned to him suddenly.  \"Look here, Teddy, I'm in a mess. I want your advice.\"  Gerrod put down his test tubes and sat on one of the tables in the laboratory, swinging his legs and preparing to be properly sympathetic with Davis' plight, which he already knew perfectly well.  \"Go ahead.\"  \"It's like this,\" said Davis reluctantly. \"I liked Nita tremendously the first time I saw her, and she seemed to like me, too. I called on her, and she seemed to like me better. And I kept on calling. I must have pretty well infested her house, but she didn't seem to mind it, you know----\"  Gerrod nodded sympathetically.  \"I know.\"  \"Well,\" said Davis savagely, \"I found out I was pretty badly gone on her, and last week I was just getting up the nerve to propose--and I _know_ she wouldn't have been displeased--when that infernal father of hers began to interfere.\"  \"He asked you quite pleasantly,\" said Gerrod with a faint smile, \"exactly why it was that you were coming around so often.\"  \"And I told him,\" said Davis, suddenly plunged into gloom again. \"It was rather premature, because I hadn't talked to Nita, but I told her father I wanted to marry her, and I loved her and all that.\"  \"And her father,\" suggested Gerrod, \"asked what your prospects were, and the rest of it. It takes a millionaire to be really middle class.\"  \"That's what he did,\" admitted Davis miserably. \"I told him my pay amounted to something, and I had about two or three thousand a year income from stocks and bonds and such things, and he laughed at me. Told me how much Nita cost him. Damn "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50622"],["title","The Silver Menace (#5)"],["body","it, I don't care about how much Nita pays for dresses!\"  \"We men are deuced impractical,\" said Gerrod with a smile. \"But what was her father's next move?\"  \"Oh\"--Davis looked as if he could weep--\"he was polite and all that, and said how much he liked me and such rot. Then he asked me not to see Nita again until I was in a position to offer her the things she had been raised to expect. You see the idea. He put it that he didn't want Nita to learn to care for me unless it were possible for me to make her happy and so on. It made me sick.\"  \"I know.\" Gerrod nodded again. \"He practically put you on honor to preserve Nita's happiness at the cost of your own.\"  \"Damn him, yes!\" Davis clenched his fists. \"But Nita does care something about me. I know she does!\"  Gerrod watched Davis with eyes from which he had banished every trace of a twinkle, until Davis had calmed down a little. Then he said cheerfully:  \"Let's go ask Evelyn about it. His late majesty, King Solomon, once remarked that women should have the wisdom of the serpent, among other qualifications. We'll see if Evelyn comes up to Solomon's specifications.\"  He led the morose Davis out of the room.         *       *       *       *       *  The great American public became alarmed and rather resentful when its harbors were blocked by the silvery jelly. It felt, though, that the Silver Menace was more of an imposition on the part of mother nature than anything else.  Passenger traffic with Europe could be maintained by air, and freight could probably be routed through the far Northern seas to which the Silver Menace had not yet penetrated. The public considered it an annoyance, and those who were accustomed to go to the seashore lot their vacations were disgusted that the mountains would receive them that summer.  They were quite sure they did not want to go down where that slimy, disgusting, musklike odor from the stilly, silent silver sea would make their days unpleasant and the nights unendurable. Fresh fish, too, became almost prohibitive in price, as the fishing fleets were immured in the harbors that had now become mirrorlike masses of the disgusting jelly.  The public resented those things, but was not really afraid. It was not until nearly a week, after the closing of the harbors had passed that the world was informed of the Silver Menace's real threat to the human race, and began to feel little shivers of horror-stricken apprehension when it looked at the morning papers.  The news was at first passed about in swift, furtive rumors, but half believed as something too horrible to be credited. The rumors grew, however, and became more circumstantial, but the newspapers remained silent.  It is known now that the government had ordered that no hint of the new danger be allowed to become public, while its scientists worked night and day to discover a means of combating this silent, relentless threat that menaced our whole existence. Whispers flew about and became magnified, but the facts themselves could not be magnified.  At last the government could keep silence no longer, and the world was informed of the true malignity of the Silver Menace. The silvery jelly had reached the American coasts, invaded and conquered the harbors, and was even then rapidly solidifying the rivers, but its threat did not end there.  Just as it had crept up the sides of Gerrod's test tubes, and as it had overwhelmed the yacht, now it crept up the beaches. Slowly and inexorably die slimy masses of jelly crept above the water line. The beaches were buried below thick blankets of sticky, shimmering animalcules and still the menace grew.  They overwhelmed all obstacles placed in their path. The whole green, fertile earth was threatened with burial beneath a mantle of slimy, silvery, glistening horror!

Gerrod watched Davis walking hastily down to the little summerhouse, and laughed.  \"Evelyn,\" he said, still chuckling, \"you have truly the wisdom of the serpent and the gentleness of the dove. Davis falls in love with Nita. Nita's father forbids Davis the house, and then you resurrect a college friendship and invite Nita down here so their little romance can be completed. Why are women so willing to go to so much trouble for mere men?\"  Evelyn slipped her arm in her husband's, and smiled up at him.  \"Well-l-l,\" she said in mock hesitation, \"perhaps this time it was because Davis is so handsome I wanted to keep out of the temptation of falling in love with him myself.\"  Gerrod looked after Davis. He had vanished inside the little vine-covered summerhouse, where Nita was waiting. Evelyn lifted her lips invitingly, and Gerrod responded to the invitation instantly. Both of them laughed together.  \"As a husband of some six months' standing,\" said Gerrod with severity, \"I protest against this undignified conduct you encourage me to continue.\"  Evelyn rubbed her cheek against his.  \"We really ought to be getting back to work on those silly animals,\" she said reluctantly. \"It's beginning to look rather serious. It may be just panic, though.\"  \"Don't believe it.\" Gerrod was in earnest. \"They've covered all the beaches with their sticky slime, and they're creeping inland. The rivers are choked with them, and floods are already threatening to become destructive.\"  \"But it's so silly!\" protested Evelyn. \"Just because some little animalcule decides to multiply and keep on multiplying----\"  \"We have to get to work,\" finished Gerrod. \"Come on into the laboratory.\"  They went into their workshop arm in arm. Evelyn and her husband worked together upon the problems in which they were interested, and indeed Evelyn was nearly as capable a physicist as was Gerrod. Her suggestions had helped him immensely when he and Davis battled with the cold bombs Varrhus had used in his attempt to bring the whole earth under his sway. Now they were laboring together to try to find a means of combating the silver menace that threatened the world.  \"You're sure there's no exaggeration in the fear that the silver animals will actually grow up on solid ground?\" asked Evelyn as she slipped into the long white apron that covered her from head to foot.  \"Not much chance,\" said Gerrod, shaking his head. \"I went down to Davis' aviation station last week. They've had to abandon the hangars nearest the water. The slimy stuff has covered the whole beach and is still creeping up. The smell is over everything, and the animals grow and grow. They've reached one of the buildings and crawled up the sides. They plastered the walls with a thick coating and even covered the roof. Height doesn't seem to bother them. They'll creep up a straight wall, and nothing seems to stop them.\"  \"Well, they don't grow very fast,\" said Evelyn slowly. \"There's still a lot of time left to fight them in.\"  \"Don't believe it. They covered the Atlantic in three months. How long will they take to cover the continent?\"  \"You make me shiver,\" protested Evelyn.  \"I'm doing a little shivering myself,\" said Gerrod grimly. \"Every river in the United States is choked up with them, and they grow upstream without the least difficulty. They're creeping up the banks of the streams just as they creep over the beaches. The banks of the Hudson are a mass of silvery slime that's still expanding.\"  Evelyn began to look a trifle worried.  \"But how far can they go from the rivers--from water?\"  \"They have gone three miles inland,\" said Gerrod grimly, \"along the Carolina coast, where the shore slopes down gently to the sea. Up in Maine there are places where they have only covered a quarter of a mile. In both places, though, they are still creeping inland.\"  He picked up one of the test tubes.  \"Something must be done to stop them. How does the cauterizing seem to work?\"  \"Not at all; it doesn't even make them pause.\"  Since their discovery that the jelly formation was caused by the tiny animalcules fusing themselves into one organism, Gerrod had thought of searing the edge of the silvery mass with a hot flame. The heat had baked and killed the animalcules for a distance of some two or three inches into the mass, and he had hoped that by that means their growth might be stopped. They had simply absorbed the seared portion into themselves as food, however, and grown on outward as before. Their means of reproduction made such a proceeding perfectly possible. Under favorable conditions of moisture and food, each of the animalcules multiplied itself by as many times as the number of tentacles it possessed. The animals themselves were tiny, jellylike creatures incased in a spherical, silicious shell from dozens of holes in which fat, restless tentacles protruded. Normally the tentacles provided the microscopic creature with the means of securing its food. Gerrod had discovered now that it was by those tentacles that they reproduced. One of the tentacles began to swell and grow a round spot at the tip. A shimmering, silvery shell appeared around the swollen portion. Within an hour from the appearance of the shimmer that showed that the protecting shell had been formed tiny, fat, jellylike tentacles protruded themselves from openings in the newly formed shell. With almost incredible rapidity the creature grew to the size of its single parent. Then the connecting tentacles snapped and a new silvery animalcule prepared to reproduce in its turn.  \"And Davis is just as oblivious of the Silver Menace as if it did not exist,\" remarked Gerrod suddenly some time later, apropos of nothing.  Evelyn smiled indulgently and did not answer. She was trying to find if it were not possible that upon exhaustion of the food supply the animalcules would attack each other and so destroy themselves. She had sealed up small quantities of the evil-smelling jelly in test tubes where they"]]]
