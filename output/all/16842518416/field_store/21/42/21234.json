Then scattering shots rattled out.  \"Dick, the rebels are fighting somebody,\" burst out Thorne, excitedly. \"The little federal garrison still holds its stand. Perhaps it is attacked again.  Anyway, there's something doing over the line.  Maybe the crazy Greasers are firing on our camp.  We've feared it--in the dark.... And here I am, away without leave--practically a deserter!\"  \"Go back!  Go back, before you're too late!\" cried Mercedes.  \"Better make tracks, Thorne,\" added Gale.  \"It can't help our predicament for you to be arrested.  I'll take care of Mercedes.\"  \"No, no, no,\" replied Thorne.  \"I can get away--avoid arrest.\"  \"That'd be all right for the immediate present.  But it's not best for the future.  George, a deserter is a deserter!... Better hurry. Leave the girl to me till tomorrow.\"  Mercedes embraced her lover, begged him to go.  Thorne wavered.  \"Dick, I'm up against it,\" he said.  \"You're right.  If only I can get back in time.  But, oh, I hate to leave her!  Old fellow, you've saved her!  I already owe you everlasting gratitude.  Keep out of Casita, Dick.  The U.S. side might be safe, but I'm afraid to trust it at night.  Go out in the desert, up in the mountains, in some safe place. Then come to me in camp.  We'll plan.  I'll have to confide in Colonel Weede.  Maybe he'll help us.  Hide her from the rebels--that's all.\"  He wrung Dick's hand, clasped Mercedes tightly in his arms, kissed her, and murmured low over her, then released her to rush off into the darkness.  He disappeared in the gloom.  The sound of his dull footfalls gradually died away.  For a moment the desert silence oppressed Gale.  He was unaccustomed to such strange stillness.  There was a low stir of sand, a rustle of stiff leaves in the wind.  How white the stars burned!  Then a coyote barked, to be bayed by a dog.  Gale realized that he was between the edge of an unknown desert and the edge of a hostile town. He had to choose the desert, because, though he had no doubt that in Casita there were many Americans who might befriend him, he could not chance the risks of seeking them at night.  He felt a slight touch on his arm, felt it move down, felt Mercedes slip a trembling cold little hand into his.  Dick looked at her. She seemed a white-faced girl now, with staring, frightened black eyes that flashed up at him.  If the loneliness, the silence, the desert, the unknown dangers of the night affected him, what must they be to this hunted, driven girl?  Gale's heart swelled.  He was alone with her.  He had no weapon, no money, no food, no drink, no covering, nothing except his two hands.  He had absolutely no knowledge of the desert, of the direction or whereabouts of the boundary line between the republics; he did not know where to find the railroad, or any road or trail, or whether or not there were towns near or far.  It was a critical, desperate situation.  He thought first of the girl, and groaned in spirit, prayed that it would be given him to save her.  When he remembered himself it was with the stunning consciousness that he could conceive of no situation which he would have exchanged for this one--where fortune had set him a perilous task of loyalty to a friend, to a helpless girl.  \"Senor, senor!\" suddenly whispered Mercedes, clinging to him. \"Listen! I hear horses coming!\"    III  A FLIGHT INTO THE DESERT  UNEASY and startled, Gale listened and, hearing nothing, wondered if Mercedes's fears had not worked upon her imagination.  He felt a trembling seize her, and he held her hands tightly.  \"You were mistaken, I guess,\" he whispered.  \"No, no, senor.\"  Dick turned his ear to the soft wind.  Presently he heard, or imagined he heard, low beats.  Like the first faint, far-off beats of a drumming grouse, they recalled to him the Illinois forests of his boyhood.  In a moment he was certain the sounds were the padlike steps of hoofs in yielding sand.  The regular tramp was not that of grazing horses.  On the instant, made cautious and stealthy by alarm, Gale drew Mercedes deeper into the gloom of the shrubbery.  Sharp pricks from thorns warned him that he was pressing into a cactus growth, and he protected Mercedes as best he could.  She was shaking as one with a severe chill. She breathed with little hurried pants and leaned upon him almost in collapse.  Gale ground his teeth in helpless rage at the girl's fate. If she had not been beautiful she might still have been free and happy in her home.  What a strange world to live in--how unfair was fate!  The sounds of hoofbeats grew louder.  Gale made out a dark moving mass against a background of dull gray.  There was a line of horses. He could not discern whether or not all the horses carried riders. The murmur of a voice struck his ear--then a low laugh.  It made him tingle, for it sounded American.  Eagerly he listened.  There was an interval when only the hoofbeats could be heard.  \"It shore was, Laddy, it shore was,\" came a voice out of the darkness. \"Rough house!  Laddy, since wire fences drove us out of Texas we ain't seen the like of that.  An' we never had such a call.\"  \"Call?  It was a burnin' roast,\" replied another voice.  \"I felt low down.  He vamoosed some sudden, an' I hope he an' his friends shook the dust of Casita.  That's a rotten town Jim.\"  Gale jumped up in joy.  What luck!  The speakers were none other than the two cowboys whom he had accosted in the Mexican hotel.  \"Hold on, fellows,\" he called out, and strode into the road.  The horses snorted and stamped.  Then followed swift rustling sounds--a clinking of spurs, then silence.  The figures loomed clearer in the gloom.. Gale saw five or six horses, two with riders, and one other, at least, carrying a pack.  When Gale got within fifteen feet of the group the foremost horseman said:  \"I reckon that's close enough, stranger.\"  Something in the cowboy's hand glinted darkly bright in the starlight.  \"You'd recognize me, if it wasn't so dark,\" replied Gale, halting. \"I spoke to you a little while ago--in the saloon back there.\"  \"Come over an' let's see you,\" said the cowboy curtly.  Gale advanced till he was close to the horse.  The cowboy leaned over the saddle and peered into Gale's face.  Then, without a word, he sheathed the gun and held out his hand.  Gale met a grip of steel that warmed his blood.  The other cowboy got off his nervous, spirited horse and threw the bridle.  He, too, peered closely into Gale's face.  \"My name's Ladd,\" he said.  \"Reckon I'm some glad to meet you again.\"  Gale felt another grip as hard and strong as the other had been.  He realized he had found friends who belonged to a class of men whom he had despaired of ever knowing.  \"Gale--Dick Gale is my name,\" he began, swiftly.  \"I dropped into Casita to-night hardly knowing where I was.  A boy took me to that hotel.  There I met an old friend whom I had not seen for years. He belongs to the cavalry stationed here.  He had befriended a Spanish girl--fallen in love with her.  Rojas had killed this girl's father--tried to abduct her.... You know what took place at the hotel. Gentlemen, if it's ever possible, I'll show you how I appreciate what you did for me there.  I got away, found my friend with the girl.  We hurried out here beyond the edge of town.  Then Thorne had to make a break for camp.  We heard bugle calls, shots, and he was away without leave.  That left the girl with me.  I don't know what to do.  Thorne swears Casita is no place for Mercedes at night.\"  \"The girl ain't no peon, no common Greaser?\" interrupted Ladd.  \"No.  Her name is Castaneda.  She belongs to an old Spanish family, once rich and influential.\"  \"Reckoned as much,\" replied the cowboy.  \"There's more than Rojas's wantin' to kidnap a pretty girl.  Shore he does that every day or so. Must be somethin' political or feelin' against class.  Well, Casita ain't no place for your friend's girl at night or day, or any time. Shore, there's Americans who'd take her in an' fight for her, if necessary.  But it ain't wise to risk that.  Lash, what do you say?\"  \"It's been gettin' hotter round this Greaser corral for some weeks,\" replied the other cowboy.  \"If that two-bit of a garrison surrenders, there's no tellin' what'll happen.  Orozco is headin' west from Agua Prieta with his guerrillas.  Campo is burnin' bridges an' tearin' up the railroad south of Nogales.  Then there's all these bandits callin' themselves revolutionists just for an excuse to steal, burn, kill, an' ride off with women.  It's plain facts, Laddy, an' bein' across the U.S. line a few inches or so don't make no hell of a difference.  My advice is, don't let Miss Castaneda ever set foot in Casita again.\"  \"Looks like you've shore spoke sense,\" said Ladd.  \"I reckon, Gale, you an' the girl ought to come with us.  Casita shore would be a little warm for us to-morrow.  We didn't kill anybody, but I shot a Greaser's arm off, an' Lash strained friendly relations by destroyin' property. We know people who'll take care of the senorita till your friend can come for her.\"  Dick warmly spoke his gratefulness, and, inexpressibly relieved and happy for Mercedes, he went toward the clump of cactus where he had left her.  She stood erect, waiting, and, dark as it was, he could tell she had lost the terror that had so shaken her.  \"Senor Gale, you are my good angel,\" she said, tremulously.  \"I've been lucky to fall in with these men, and I'm glad with all my heart,\" he replied.  \"Come.\"  He led her into the road up to the cowboys, who now stood bareheaded in the starlight.  They seemed shy, and Lash was silent while Ladd made embarrassed, unintelligible reply to Mercedes's thanks.  There were five horses--two saddled, two packed, and the remaining one carried only a blanket.  Ladd shortened the stirrups on his mount, and helped Mercedes up into the saddle.  From the way she settled herself and took the few restive prances of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50217"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Pacific Fleet (#0)"],["body","DAWSON WITH THE PACIFIC FLEET                           _by_ R.

For a full five minutes he had been gaping at the sight, not moving a muscle, not making a sound, and practically holding his breath all of the time. At his side and with an arm thrown across the English-born R.A.F. ace's shoulders was Dave Dawson, grinning from ear to ear, and getting the kick of his life out of the spell that a first look at Gotham had cast upon his bosom pal, and hard-hitting flying partner.  Finally he couldn't wait any longer to hear what Freddy had to say.  \"Well?\" he encouraged.  \"Well, what?\" Freddy murmured in little more than a whisper.  \"What do you think of the old town, huh?\" Dave asked with a happy chuckle.  The English youth blinked, swallowed hard, and gave a little uncertain shake of his head.  \"Unbelievable, incredible!\" he finally got out. \"Are--are those really buildings down there? The New York skyscrapers I've heard so much about?\"  By way of making his question clear, Freddy pointed at the towering heaps of stone that formed the Wall Street and midtown sections of the city. Dave squinted down and grunted.  \"Those little shacks?\" he echoed. \"Why, those are just the little huts where the poor people live. Wait until you see the real buildings. How high are we, anyway? Hope the pilot of this thing stays over three thousand feet. Be tough to smack into a skyscraper, you know.\"  Freddy Farmer snorted and dug an elbow into Dawson's ribs.  \"Oh, come off it, funny lad!\" he snapped. \"That one wasn't even worth a quiet smile. Point out some of the buildings, will you? The Empire State Building. Where is it, anyway?\"  Dawson pointed it out to his friend, and then went on to point out many of the other buildings of Manhattan that were famous the world around.  \"But the Empire State tops them all,\" he said at the end of his little tourist guide speech. \"Funny thing about it, though. The Empire State is the tallest building in the world, but it's not the highest. Ever realize that?\"  Freddy took his eyes off the view just long enough to give him a quizzical stare.  \"The tallest, but not the highest?\" he said. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\"  \"It's a fact,\" Dawson said gravely. \"Didn't you know you've got buildings in England higher than the Empire State?\"  The English youth sighed and gave a little shrug of his shoulders.  \"I always felt there was something funny about America,\" he grunted. \"But I never knew that seeing your homeland affected you Yanks this way. We have buildings in England taller than your Empire State? What utter rubbish!\"  \"I didn't say taller, I said _higher_!\" Dawson chuckled. \"Take the city hall out in Denver, Colorado. Denver's a mile above sea level, but New York is just about sea level. Catch on? The Denver City Hall is over four thousand feet _higher_ than the Empire State. Try that on your friends when you get back to England.\"  \"Blasted likely I will!\" Freddy snorted. \"They'd have me locked up sure for a balmy one. But don't talk about getting back to England. Good grief! I've only just arrived in America. And speaking of coming to America, I'd certainly like to know--\"  \"Yeah, me too,\" Dave cut in, and suddenly leaned closer to the window glass. \"Hello, Sweetheart!\" he cried, and threw a kiss. \"Have you been lonesome for me, Sweet? Well, here I am, Precious. And am I tickled pink to see you!\"  As Dawson talked and went through the motions of throwing kisses, Freddy Farmer paled slightly and glanced anxious-eyed about the Clipper's lounge to see if any of the other passengers were watching. They weren't, however. They were all too busy filling their own eyes with New York. Finally Freddy turned back to Dave.  \"Are you all right, Dave?\" he asked. \"Not air sick, or anything? Then for pity's sake, stop all this rot! Where in the world do you think you are? On the stage? And what in heaven's name are you acting out?\"  \"Acting nothing!\" Dawson snapped. \"The real thing, pal! I'm just saying hello to my girl, my sweetheart. I haven't seen her for a couple of years, you know. There she is down there. See her?\"  The English youth looked eagerly out the window again, but his eagerness disappeared at once, and he groaned softly.  \"As though you could see anybody from this height!\" he growled. \"You've just gone plain balmy with joy at being back in your own country. But I'm telling you right now that if you keep it up, I'm going to quit you and go back to England even if I have to swim it. Frankly, I think I must have been a little balmy myself to have come over here with you in the first place. See your girl waiting for you? Rot! Matter of fact, I recall your telling me that you didn't have any girl.\"  \"I haven't,\" Dawson said with a grin. \"Only this lady is very special. She's the sweetheart of every returning American. Always waits in the same place, holding up a torch so you can find your way in. There she is, down there. See her? Over two million Yanks threw goodbye and hello kisses at her in the last war. She was born in France, but she's been Yank ever since the day she came over. Freddy, meet my very special sweetheart. Isn't she something, though?\"  Pulling the English youth closer to the window, Dave Dawson pointed a finger down at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. Freddy stared at it long and silently. Then presently he nodded and smiled at Dawson.  \"No, I guess you're not so balmy as I thought,\" he said. \"I see what you mean and I quite agree. She is, indeed, the sweetheart of all you Yank chaps. She stands for the most cherished thing in all of your great country: Liberty!\"  \"Yes,\" Dave said gravely. \"And I hope and pray that before long what she stands for will extend around the world and to each of the Poles.\"  \"Amen!\" Freddy Farmer breathed softly. Then, as his young face grew hard and grim: \"It will come, Dave. Maybe you, and I, and thousands of chaps like us, may not live to see it. But it will come, just as sure as there is a sun in the heavens by day, and stars by night. I'm not one of those heavy-thinking blokes who can spill out wonderful words by the yard, but ever since this blasted mess started I haven't once had even the tiniest feeling that Hitler and his murderers would win in the end. And now that the United States is in it, I simply feel that victory will be ours just that much sooner.\"  \"Feel the same way,\" Dave murmured, and stared unseeing out the window. \"But it's going to be a scrap, and a tough one. Those dirty Japs got the jump on us. And they're in high gear right now, while Uncle Sam is still shifting into first. But it won't be long before the old guy with the whiskers gets rolling. And when he does, Mr. Jap, and Adolf, and Muzzy the Fuzzy, you're going to catch it from all sides--and plenty! And--Hold everything! I sound like a Congressman dedicating a post office, or something. Let's change the subject. Gosh, Freddy, but you look funny in civilian clothes.\"  \"Oh, do I?\" the English youth flared up and flushed. \"Well, let me tell you, my little man, you'd never take any prizes at a fashion show for men. You'd--\"  \"Get down off your ear, pal!\" Dave stopped him with a chuckle. \"I didn't mean that the way you took it. I mean that I've been so used to seeing you in uniform that it seems sort of cockeyed to see you in civies. They're a swell fit, and you'll knock the ladies of Broadway and Fifth Avenue for a loop. So don't get hot under the collar.\"  \"Well, that's a little better!\" Freddy growled. Then, with a sheepish grin: \"To tell the truth, I feel just as strange as I must look. It's really a very nice suit of clothes, but I feel all out of place wearing it. That is--\"  \"I know what you mean,\" Dave chuckled. \"Feel that way, too. As if a Wing Commander, or somebody, were liable to pop up out of nowhere and bawl the pants off me for not being dressed for a rush take-off and a scramble. Well, anyway, never a dull moment for us, hey, Freddy?\"  The English youth laughed and shook his head, then ran a fingertip along the bottom of the window and furrowed his brows in a puzzled scowl.  \"No, never a dull moment,\" he said. \"But I wish that some of those moments could be explained to us now and then. I--we"]]]
