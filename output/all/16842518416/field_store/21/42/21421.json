Finding              one worth living for is the genuine problem!   In the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet of a star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stood counting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any significance in the number. He had no idea.  \"What do you make of it?\" he asked.  Lieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to scratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.  \"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all built out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways, maybe?\"  Steffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weathered stone jutted out of the sand before him.  \"No inscriptions,\" he pointed out.  \"They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there's not another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it much of a civilization.\"  \"You don't think these are native?\"  Ball said he didn't. Steffens nodded.  Standing there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of great age. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old--_too_ old. He reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone ridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed that the buildings had no airlocks.  Ball's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"  Steffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"  \"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These things are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And you can see that the rock itself is native--\" he indicated the ledge beneath their feet--\"and was cut out a long while back.\"  \"How long?\"  Ball toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\"  \"Make a rough estimate.\"  Ball looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled wryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\"  Steffens whistled.  Ball pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell from that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind _at least_ several thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a fraction of that force.\"  The two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been in interstellar space for three hundred years and this was the first uncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It was an historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.  Man had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built these had been in space for thousands of years.  Which ought to give _them_, thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell of a good head-start.         *       *       *       *       *  While the excav crew worked steadily, turning up nothing, Steffens remained alone among the buildings. Ball came out to him, looked dryly at the walls.  \"Well,\" he said, \"whoever they were, we haven't heard from them since.\"  \"No? How can you be sure?\" Steffens grunted. \"A space-borne race was roaming this part of the Galaxy while men were still pitching spears at each other, _that_ long ago. And this planet is only a parsec from Varius II, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these get to Varius? Or did they get to Earth? How can you know?\"  He kicked at the sand distractedly. \"And most important, where are they now? A race with several thousand years....\"  \"Fifteen thousand,\" Ball said. When Steffens looked up, he added: \"That's what the geology boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the least.\"  Steffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When he realized now how really old they were, a sudden thought struck him.  \"But why buildings? Why did they have to build in stone, to last? There's something wrong with that. They shouldn't have had a need to build, unless they were castaways. And castaways would have left _something_ behind. The only reason they would need a camp would be--\"  \"If the ship left and some of them stayed.\"  Steffens nodded. \"But then the ship must have come back. Where did it go?\" He ceased kicking at the sand and looked up into the blue-black midday sky. \"We'll never know.\"  \"How about the other planets?\" Ball asked.  \"The report was negative. Inner too hot, outer too heavy and cold. The third planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but _it_ has a CO_{2} atmosphere.\"  \"How about moons?\"  Steffens shrugged. \"We could try them and find out.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The third planet was a blank, gleaming ball until they were in close, and then the blankness resolved into folds and piling clouds and dimly, in places, the surface showed through. The ship went down through the clouds, falling the last few miles on her brakers. They came into the misty gas below, leveled off and moved along the edge of the twilight zone.  The moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The third planet, a hot, heavy world which had no free oxygen and from which the monitors had detected nothing, was all that was left. Steffens expected nothing, but he had to try.  At a height of several miles, the ship moved up the zone, scanning, moving in the familiar slow spiral of the Mapping Command. Faint dark outlines of bare rocks and hills moved by below.  Steffens turned the screen to full magnification and watched silently.  After a while he saw a city.  The main screen being on, the whole crew saw it. Someone shouted and they stopped to stare, and Steffens was about to call for altitude when he saw that the city was dead.  He looked down on splintered walls that were like cloudy glass pieces rising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center of the city, there was a huge, charred hole at least three miles in diameter and very deep. In all the piled rubble, nothing moved.  Steffens went down low to make sure, then brought the ship around and headed out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun. The rocks rolled by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then there were more cities--all with the black depression, the circular stamp that blotted away and fused the buildings into nothing.  No one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen a war, for there had not been war on Earth or near it for more than three hundred years.  The ship circled around to the dark side of the planet. When they were down below a mile, the radiation counters began to react. It became apparent, from the dials, that there could be nothing alive.  After a while Ball said: \"Well, which do you figure? Did our friends from the fourth planet do this, or were they the same people as these?\"  Steffens did not take his eyes from the screen. They were coming around to the daylight side.  \"We'll go down and look for the answer,\" he said. \"Break out the radiation suits.\"  He paused, thinking. If the ones on the fourth planet were alien to this world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one of the other planets here. They had starships and were warlike. Then, thousands of years ago. He began to realize how important it really was that Ball's question be answered.  When the ship had gone very low, looking for a landing site, Steffens was still by the screen. It was Steffens, then, who saw the thing move.  Down far below, it had been a still black shadow, and then it moved. Steffens froze. And he knew, even at that distance, that it was a robot.  Tiny and black, a mass of hanging arms and legs, the thing went gliding down the slope of a hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a full second, saw the dull ball of its head tilt upward as the ship came over, and then the hill was past.         *       *       *       *       *  Quickly Steffens called for height. The ship bucked beneath him and blasted straight up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck. Steffens remained by the screen, increasing the magnification as the ship drew away. And he saw another, then two, then a black gliding group, all matched with bunches of hanging arms.  Nothing alive but robots, he thought, _robots_. He adjusted to full close up as quickly as he could and the picture focused on the screen. Behind him he heard a crewman grunt in amazement.  A band of clear, plasticlike stuff ran round the head--it would be the eye, a band of eye that saw all ways. On the top of the head was a single round spot of the plastic, and the rest was black metal, joined, he realized, with fantastic perfection. The angle of sight was now almost perpendicular. He could see very little of the branching arms of the trunk, but what had been on the screen was enough. They were the most perfect robots he had ever seen.  The ship leveled off. Steffens had no idea what to do; the sudden sight of the moving things had unnerved him. He had already sounded the alert, flicked out the defense screens. Now he had nothing to do. He tried to concentrate on what the League Law would have him do.  The Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was forbidden under any circumstances. But could a bunch of robots be called a race? The Law said nothing about robots because Earthmen had none. The building of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any rate, Steffens thought, he had made contact already.  While Steffens stood by the screen, completely bewildered for the first time in his space career, Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly. From the bright new bruise on his cheek, Steffens guessed that the sudden climb had caught"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50827"],["title","Orphans of the Void (#1)"],["body","unaware. The exec was pale with surprise.  \"What were they?\" he said blankly. \"Lord, they looked like robots!\"  \"They were.\"  Ball stared confoundedly at the screen. The things were now a confusion of dots in the mist.  \"Almost humanoid,\" Steffens said, \"but not quite.\"  Ball was slowly absorbing the situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly at Steffens.  \"Well, what do we do now?\"  Steffens shrugged. \"They saw us. We could leave now and let them quite possibly make a ... a legend out of our visit, or we could go down and see if they tie in with the buildings on Tyban IV.\"  \"_Can_ we go down?\"  \"Legally? I don't know. If they are robots, yes, since robots cannot constitute a race. But there's another possibility.\" He tapped his fingers on the screen confusedly. \"They don't have to be robots at all. They could be the natives.\"  Ball gulped. \"I don't follow you.\"  \"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet--the brains of them, at least, protected in radiation-proof metal. Anyway,\" he added, \"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\"  Ball shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from the screen, strode nervously across the Main Deck, thinking.  The Mapping Command, they called it. Theoretically, all he was supposed to do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking for the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of human colonization. Make a check and nothing else. But he knew very clearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this robot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the other, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of duty.  And there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him, that the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and gone.  He stopped in the center of the deck. A whole new line of thought opened up. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an outpost?  _An outpost!_  He turned and raced for the bridge. If he went in and landed and was lost, then the League might never know in time. If he went in and stirred up trouble....  The thought in his mind was scattered suddenly, like a mist blown away. A voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice that seemed to say:  \"_Greetings. Do not be alarmed. We do not wish you to be alarmed. Our desire is only to serve...._\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Greetings, it said! Greetings!\" Ball was mumbling incredulously through shocked lips.  Everyone on the ship had heard the voice. When it spoke again, Steffens was not sure whether it was just one voice or many voices.  \"We await your coming,\" it said gravely, and repeated: \"Our desire is only to serve.\"  And then the robots sent a _picture_.  As perfect and as clear as a tridim movie, a rectangular plate took shape in Steffens' mind. On the face of the plate, standing alone against a background of red-brown, bare rocks, was one of the robots. With slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the hanging arms of its side, of its _right_ side, and extended it toward Steffens, a graciously offered hand.  Steffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized right away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. The robot mind had helped.  When the picture vanished, he knew that the others had seen it. He waited for a while; there was no further contact, but the feeling of the robot's urging was still strong within him. He had an idea that, if they wanted to, the robots could control his mind. So when nothing more happened, he began to lose his fear.  While the crew watched in fascination, Steffens tried to talk back. He concentrated hard on what he was saying, said it aloud for good measure, then held his own hand extended in the robot manner of shaking hands.  \"Greetings,\" he said, because it was what _they_ had said, and explained: \"We have come from the stars.\"  It was overly dramatic, but so was the whole situation. He wondered baffledly if he should have let the Alien Contact crew handle it. Order someone to stand there, feeling like a fool, and _think_ a message?  No, it was his responsibility; he had to go on:  \"We request--we respectfully request permission to land upon your planet.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Steffens had not realized that there were so many.  They had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there were hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving even as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with fantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety. Most of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal. Others threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none touched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now saw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black thing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture. Steffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through the glove of his suit.  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now Steffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was less friendly now, less--Steffens could not understand--somehow less _interested_, as if the robot had been--expecting someone else.  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission to land.\"  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He tried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they _should_ seem inhuman. But....  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above, jets throbbing gently.  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the robot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his mind, there was no need to ask.  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense and uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was obviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men to come on out of the skiff.  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard the one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is our--custom--not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we observed that you were in ignorance of our real--nature--and were about to leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you might base your decision upon sufficient data.\"  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete access to your mind, and would perhaps be--dismayed--to learn that we have been gathering information from you. We must--apologize. Our only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only that information was taken which is necessary for communication and--understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your request.\"  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed as violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he retreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way different from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots was immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens guessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake, because they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The picture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen, had probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and the others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary lapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed almost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to examine the first robot in detail.  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen. The most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of the head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the metal chest. Symbols in row upon row--numbers, perhaps--were upon the chest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued in orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the base of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was a remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on the nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude that the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at that, although the answer seemed illogical.  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the symbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.         *       *       *       *       *  After a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the ship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met by the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side, humbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of the robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them stood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun like a vast, metallic field of black wheat.  The robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to _feel_ their pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless faces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were still reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had built them well.  Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear plastic of his helmet with "]]]
