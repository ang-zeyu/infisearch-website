No accidental was like any other.  The self-deception was vicious precisely because the accidentals _were_ qualified. Of all the billions of solar citizens _they alone could make the long journey there and return_. But there were other factors that ruled them out. It was never safe to discuss the first reason with them because the second would have to be explained. Cameron himself wasn't sadistic and no one else was interested enough to inform them.     2   Docchi sat beside the pool. It would be pleasant if he could forget where he was. It was pastoral though not quite a scene from Earth. The horizon was too near and the sky was shallow and only seemed to be bright. Darkness lurked outside.  A small tree stretched shade overhead. Waves lapped and made gurgling sounds against the banks. But there was no plant life of any kind, and no fish swam in the liquid. It looked like water but wasn't--the pool held acid. And floating in it, all but submerged, was a shape. The records in the hospital said it was a woman.  \"Anti, they turned us down,\" said Docchi bitterly.  \"What did you expect?\" rumbled the creature in the pool. Wavelets of acid danced across the surface, stirred by her voice.  \"I didn't expect that.\"  \"You don't know the Medicouncil very well.\"  \"I guess I don't.\" He stared sullenly at the fluid. It was faintly blue. \"I have the feeling they didn't consider it, that they held the request for a time and then answered no without looking at it.\"  \"Now you're beginning to learn. Wait till you've been here as long as I have.\"  Morosely he kicked an anemic tuft of grass. Plants didn't do well here either. They too were exiled, far from the sun, removed from the soil they originated in. The conditions they grew in were artificial. \"Why did they turn us down?\" said Docchi.  \"Answer it yourself. Remember what the Medicouncil is like. Different things are important to them. The main thing is that we don't have to follow their example. There's no need to be irrational even though they are.\"  \"I wish I knew what to do,\" said Docchi. \"It meant so much to us.\"  \"We can wait, outlast the attitude,\" said Anti, moving slowly. It was the only way she could move. Most of her bulk was beneath the surface.  \"Cameron suggested waiting.\" Reflectively Docchi added: \"It's true we are biocompensators.\"  \"They always bring in biocompensation,\" muttered Anti restlessly. \"I'm getting tired of that excuse. Time passes just as slow.\"  \"But what else is there? Shall we draw up another request?\"  \"Memorandum number ten? Let's not be naive. Things get lost when we send them to the Medicouncil. Their filing system is in terrible shape.\"  \"Lost or distorted,\" grunted Docchi angrily. The grass he'd kicked already had begun to wilt. It wasn't hardy in this environment. Few things were.  \"Maybe we ought to give the Medicouncil a rest. I'm sure they don't want to hear from us again.\"  Docchi moved closer to the pool. \"Then you think we should go ahead with the plan we discussed before we sent in the petition? Good. I'll call the others together and tell them what happened. They'll agree that we have to do it.\"  \"Then why call them? More talk, that's all. Besides I don't see why we should warn Cameron what we're up to.\"  Docchi glanced at her worriedly. \"Do you think someone would report it? I'm certain everyone feels as I do.\"  \"Not everyone. There's bound to be dissent,\" said Anti placidly. \"But I wasn't thinking of people.\"  \"Oh that,\" said Docchi. \"We can block that source any time we need to.\" It was a relief to know that he could trust the accidentals. Unanimity was important and some of the reasons weren't obvious.  \"Maybe you can and maybe you can't,\" said Anti. \"But why make it difficult, why waste time?\"  Docchi got up awkwardly but he wasn't clumsy once he was on his feet. \"I'll get Jordan. I know I'll need arms.\"  \"Depends on what you mean,\" said Anti.  \"Both,\" said Docchi, smiling. \"We're a dangerous weapon.\"  She called out as he walked away. \"I'll see you when you leave for far Centauri.\"  \"Sooner than that, Anti. Much sooner.\"  Stars were beginning to wink. Twilight brought out the shadows and tracery of the structure that supported the transparent dome overhead. Soon controlled slow rotation would bring near darkness to this side of the asteroid. The sun was small at this distance but even so it was a tie to the familiar scenes of Earth. Before long it would be lost.         *       *       *       *       *  Cameron leaned back and looked speculatively at the gravity engineer, Vogel. The engineer could give him considerable assistance. There was no reason why he shouldn't but anyone who voluntarily had remained on the asteroid as long as Vogel was a doubtful quantity. He didn't distrust him, the man was strange.  \"I've been busy trying to keep the place running smoothly. I hope you don't mind that I haven't been able to discuss your job at length,\" said the doctor, watching him closely.  \"Naw, I don't mind,\" said Vogel. \"Medical directors come and go. I stay on. It's easier than getting another job.\"  \"I know. By now you should know the place pretty well. I sometimes think you could do my work with half the trouble.\"  \"Ain't in the least curious about medicine and never bothered to learn,\" grunted Vogel. \"I keep my stuff running and that's all. I don't interfere with nobody and they don't come around and get friendly with me.\"  Cameron believed it. The statement fit the personality. He needn't be concerned about fraternization. \"There are a few things that puzzle me,\" he began. \"That's why I called you in. Usually we maintain about half Earth-normal gravity. Is that correct?\"  The engineer nodded and grunted assent.  \"I'm not sure why half gravity is used. Perhaps it's easier on the weakened bodies of the accidentals. Or there may be economic factors. Either way it's not important as long as half gravity is what we get.\"  \"You want to know why we use that figure?\"  \"If you can tell me without getting too technical, yes. I feel I should learn everything I can about the place.\"  The engineer warmed up, seeming to enjoy himself. \"Ain't no reason except the gravity units themselves,\" Vogel said. \"Theoretically we can get anything we want. Practically we take whatever comes out, anything from a quarter to full Earth gravity.\"  \"You have no control over it?\" This contradicted what he'd heard. His information was that gravity generators were the product of an awesome bit of scientific development. It seemed inconceivable that they should be so haphazardly directed.  \"Sure we got control,\" answered the engineer, grinning. \"We can turn them off or on. If gravity varies, that's too bad. We take the fluctuation or we don't get anything.\"  Cameron frowned; the man knew what he was doing or he wouldn't be here. His position was of only slightly less importance than that of the medical director--and where it mattered the Medicouncil wouldn't tolerate incompetence. And yet----  The engineer rumbled on. \"You were talking how the generators were designed especially for the asteroid. Some fancy medical reason why it's easier on the accidentals to have a lesser gravity plus a certain amount of change. Me, I dunno. I guess the designers couldn't help what was built and the reason was dug up later.\"  Cameron concealed his irritation. He wanted information, not a heart to heart confession. Back on Earth he _had_ been told it was for the benefit of the accidentals. He'd reserved judgment then and saw no reason not to do so now. \"All practical sciences try to justify what they can't escape but would like to. Medicine, I'm sure, is no exception.\"  He paused thoughtfully. \"I understand there are three separate generators on the asteroid. One runs for forty-five minutes while two are idle. When the first one stops another one cuts in. The operations are supposed to be synchronized. I don't have to tell you that they're not. Not long ago you felt your weight increase suddenly. I know I did. What is wrong?\"  \"Nothing wrong,\" said the engineer soothingly. \"You get fluctuations while one generator is running. You get a gravity surge when one generator is supposed to drop out but doesn't. The companion machine adds to it, that's all.\"  \"They're supposed to be that way? Overlapping so that for a time we have Earth or Earth and a half gravity?\"  \"Better than having none,\" said Vogel with heavy pride. \"Used to happen quite often, before I came. You can ask any of the old timers. I fixed that though.\"  He didn't like the direction his questions were taking him. \"What did you do?\" he asked suspiciously.  \"Nothing,\" said the engineer uncomfortably. \"Nothing I can think of. I guess the machines just got used to having me around.\"  There were people who tended to anthropomorphize anything they came in contact with and Vogel was one of them. It made no difference to him that he was talking about insensate machines. He would continue to endow them with personality. \"This is the best you can say, that we'll get a wild variation of gravity, sometimes none?\"  \"It's not _supposed_ to work that way but nobody's ever done better with a setup like this,\" said Vogel defensively. \"If you want you can check the company that makes these units.\"  \"I'm not trying to challenge your knowledge and I'm not anxious to make myself look silly. I do want to make sure I don't overlook anything. You see, I think there's a possibility of sabotage.\"  The engineer's grin was wider than the remark required.  Cameron swiveled the chair around and leaned on the desk. \"All right,\" he said tiredly, \"tell me why the idea of sabotage is so funny.\"  \"It would have to be someone living here,\" said the big engineer. \"He wouldn't like it if it jumped up to nine G, which it could. I think he'd let it alone. But there are better reasons. Do you know how each gravity unit is put together?\"  \"Not in detail.\"  The gravity"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50736"],["title","Address: Centauri (#3)"],["body","unit was not a unit. It was built in three parts. First there was a power source, which could be anything as long as it supplied ample energy. The basic supply on the asteroid was a nuclear pile, buried deep in the core. Handicap Haven would have to be taken apart, stone by stone, before it could be reached.  Part two were the gravity coils, which actually originated and directed the gravity. They were simple and very nearly indestructible. They could be destroyed but they couldn't be altered and still produce the field.  The third part was the control unit, the real heart of the gravity generating system. It calculated the relationship between the power flowing through the coils and the created field in any one microsecond. It used the computed relationship to alter the power flowing in the next microsecond to get the same gravity. If the power didn't change the field died instantly. The control unit was thus actually a computer, one of the best made, accurate and fast beyond belief.  The engineer rubbed his chin. \"Now I guess you can see why it doesn't always behave as we want it to.\"  He looked questioningly at Cameron, expecting a reply. \"I'm afraid I can't,\" said the doctor.  \"If it was one of your patients you'd understand,\" said Vogel. \"Fatigue. The gravity control unit is an intricate computer and it gets tired. It has to rest an hour and a half to do forty-five minutes work. It can't keep running all the time any more than any delicate machine can. It has to be shut down to clear the circuits.  \"Naturally they don't want anyone tinkering with it. It's sealed and non-repairable. Crack the case open and it disintegrates. But first you've got to open it. Now I know that it can be done, but not without a lot of high-powered equipment that I could detect if it was anywhere on the asteroid.\"  In spite of the engineer's attitude it didn't seem completely foolproof. But Cameron had to admit that it was probable none of the accidentals could tamper with it. \"I'll forget about gravity,\" he said. \"Next, what about hand weapons? What's available?\"  \"Nothing. No knives even. Maybe a stray bar or so of metal.\" Vogel scratched his head. \"There is something that's dangerous though. I dunno whether you could classify it as a weapon.\"  Cameron was instantly alert. \"If it's dangerous someone can find a way to use it. What is it?\"  \"The asteroid itself. Nobody can physically touch any part of the gravity system. But I've often wondered if an impulse couldn't be squeezed into the computer. If anybody can do that he can change direction of the field.\" Vogel's voice was grave. \"Somebody could pick up Handicap Haven and throw it anywhere he wanted. At Earth, say. Thirty miles in diameter is a big hunk of rock.\"  This was the kind of information Cameron had been looking for, though the big engineer seemed to regard the occasion as merely a long overdue social call. \"What's the possibility?\"  Vogel grinned. \"Thought I'd scare you. Used to wake up sweating myself. Got so bad I had to find out about it.\"  \"Can or can't it be done?\" demanded the doctor.  \"Naw. It's too big to take a chance with. They got monitors set up all over, moons of Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus. This or any other gravity computer gets dizzy, the monitor overrides it. If that fails they send a jammer impulse and freeze it up tight. It can't get away until the monitor lets loose.\"  Cameron's mind was already busy elsewhere. Vogel was loquacious and would talk all night if encouraged. It wasn't that he lacked information but he had no sense of what was important. \"You don't know how you've helped me,\" the doctor said, standing up. \"We'll have to get together again.\"  He watched the engineer depart for the gravity generating chamber below the surface of the asteroid. The day had started badly and wasn't getting better. Docchi to Thorton to Vogel. All the shades of shortsightedness, the convalescent's, authority's, and finally the technician who refused to see beyond his dials. A fine progression, but somewhere the curve ought to turn upward.  The post on Handicap Haven wasn't pleasant but there were advantages--advancement was proportional to the disagreeableness of the place. After shepherding accidentals for a year any other assignment would be a snap. Ten months to go before the year was over and if Cameron could survive with nothing to mar his administration he was in line for something better, definitely better. This was where the Medicouncil sent promising young doctors.  Cameron flipped on the telecom. \"Connect me with the rocket dome. Get the pilot.\"  When the robot answered it wasn't encouraging. \"There's no answer. I'm sorry. I'll notify you when he comes in.\"  \"Trace him,\" he snapped. \"If he's not near the rocket he's somewhere in the main dome. I don't care how you do it, get him.\"  A few seconds of silence followed. The answer was puzzling. \"There's no record that the pilot has left the rocket dome.\"  His heart skipped and his breathing was constricted. He spoke carefully. \"Scan the whole area. Look every place, even if you think he can't be there. I've got to have the pilot.\"  \"Scanning isn't possible. The system is out of operation in that area. I'm trying to check why.\"  That was bad. He could feel muscles tighten that he didn't know he had. \"All right. Send out repair robots.\" They'd get the job done--they always did. But they were intolerably slow and just now he needed speed.  \"Mobile repair units were dispatched as soon as scanning failed to work. Is this an emergency? If so I can alert the staff.\"  He thought about it. He needed help, plenty of it. But was there any one he could depend on? Vogel? He'd probably be ready for action. But to call on him would leave the gravity generating plant unprotected. And if he told the engineer what he suspected, Vogel would insist on mixing in with it. He was too vital where he was.  Who else? The sour middle-aged nurse who'd signed up because she wanted quick credits toward retirement? She slept through most of her shift and considering her efficiency perhaps it was just as well she did. Or the sweet young trainee--her diploma said she'd completed her training, but you couldn't lie to a doctor--who had bravely volunteered because someone ought to help poor unfortunate men? Not a word about women of course. She always walked in when Cameron was examining a patient, male, but she had the deplorable habit of swooning when she saw blood. Fainting was too vulgar for her and, as Cameron had once told her, so was the profession of her choice.  These were the people the emergency signal would alert. He would do better to rely on robots. They weren't much help but at least they wouldn't get hysterically in his way. Oh yes, there was the pilot too, but he couldn't be located.  The damned place was undermanned and always had been. Nobody wanted to be stationed here except those who were mildly psychotic or inefficient and lazy. There was one exception. Ambitious young doctors had been known to ask for the position. Mentally Cameron berated himself. Ambition wasn't far from psychosis, or at times it could produce results as bad. If anything serious happened here he'd begin and end his career bandaging scratches at a children's playground.  \"This is not an emergency,\" he said. \"However leave word in gravity with Vogel. Tell him to put on his electronic guards. I don't want him to let anyone get near the place.\"  \"Is that all?\"  \"Send out six geepees. I'll pick them up near the entrance to the rocket dome.\"  \"Repair robots are already in the area. Will they do as well?\"  \"They won't. I want general purpose robots for another reason. Send the latest huskiest models we have.\" They were not bright but they were strong and could move fast. He clicked off the picture. What did he have to be afraid of? For the most part they were a beaten ragged bunch of humans. He would feel sorry for them if he wasn't apprehensive about his future.     3   Docchi waited near the rocket dome. He wasn't hiding but he did make himself inconspicuous among the carefully nurtured shrubbery. Plants failed to give the illusion of an Earth landscape--in part because some of them were Venusian or Martian imports--but at least the greenery added to the oxygen supply of the asteroid.  \"That's a good job,\" commented Docchi. \"I thought Nona could do it.\"  Jordan could feel him relax as he watched the event. \"A mechanical marvel,\" he agreed. \"But we can gab about that later. I think you ought to get going.\"  Docchi glanced around and then went boldly into the passageway that connected the main dome with the much smaller rocket dome that was adjacent to it. Normally it was never completely dark in the inhabited part of the asteroid, modulated twilight was considered more conducive to the slumber of the grievously infirm. It was the benevolent Medicouncil's theory that a little light would keep away bad dreams. But this wasn't twilight as they neared the rocket dome. It was a full scale rehearsal for the darkness of interstellar space.  Docchi stopped at the emergency airlock which loomed formidably solid in front of them. \"Let's hope,\" he said. \"We can forget about it if Nona didn't manage to cut _this_ out of the circuit.\"  \"She seemed to understand, didn't she? What more do you want?\" Jordan twisted around Docchi and reached out. The great slab moved easily in the grooves. It was open. \"The trouble with you is that you lack confidence, in yourself and in genius.\"  Docchi didn't answer. He was listening intently, trying to interpret the faint sounds ahead of him.  \"Okay, I hear it,\" whispered Jordan. \"Let's get way inside before he comes near us.\"  Docchi went cautiously into the darkness of the rocket dome, feeling his way. He'd never recover in time if he stumbled and fell. He tried to force the luminescence into his face. Occasionally he could control his altered metabolism, and now was the time he needed it.  He was nervous and that"]]]
