He would remain a lonely Flying Dutchman of the sky, until the end of the war permitted finishing the ship that would bring him relief. Or forever--whichever came first.  It was inevitable that the Asians would get the idea that he was spying on them as he passed in his regular orbit far above their heads. In reality, this was sheer nonsense; he was much too high to make out any military details of any importance whatsoever. Also, they were taking full advantage of his broadcasts of scientific information, which could be obtained by tuning in to the bands he used.  In an effort to remove this imagined menace from the sky above them, the Asians fired a rocket torpedo at his satellite.  Colonel Grant, reporting later on what had happened, said, \"That torpedo must have been on its way, when the little man appeared on my satellite. He told me about the rocket that was coming my way. I told him this was very interesting but that I didn't see what the hell I could do about it. The station had no power and couldn't be moved. I didn't even have a chute, and even if I had had one I couldn't have used it. Anybody who jumped from that height would have frozen to death long before he reached enough air to sustain life. Describe the little man for you? Sure, general. He looked like a miniature Moses, white beard, glittering eyes and everything else. No, general, I never saw Moses. Clothes? A loin cloth, general. No, sir I am not making light of the dignity of this court, I am telling in the words at my command what I saw happen with my own eyes.\"  At this point, the colonel's voice became a little stiff. The general shut up. A man who had done what Grant had done might snap a general's head off and get away with it.  \"What happened next? The miniature Moses told me he was going to land the satellite. He said that even if they missed with this torpedo they would be sure to try again, for no reason except to give the morale of their own people a big boost.\"  \"Land the satellite, colonel?\" the general asked again. \"But as I understand it, the station was without power!\"  \"You understand the situation correctly, general. But that was what he said and that was what he did. In as neat a landing as I ever saw. And if you don't believe me, you can go look for yourself.\"  The space satellite sitting in the middle of a Kansas wheat field was evidence that could not be ignored. It was solid, it was metal, it was real. Colonel Grant might have gone wacky from the stress of remaining too long in space, but the station, at least, had remained sane. Power must have been used to move it. But what power?  Colonel Grant could not answer the question of what happened to the miniature Moses after the station had been landed. He flung up his hands. \"Moses went the same way he came, without me seeing him.\"  On the basis of Grant's report, an investigation was begun. A vast mass of data was assembled, some of it dating from the time of Jal Jonnor, but when no practical results were immediately forthcoming, the project was shelved, at least temporarily. Its manpower was desperately needed for other purposes. Men fighting for their lives have no time to think of the future.  This dusty, forgotten mass of data was exhumed by a tall, lean man named Kurt Zen, a colonel of intelligence, who had a reputation for daring even among that elite band of men who daily looked death in the face.  Zen was assigned to this investigation, not only because of his reputation, but because the stories of the new people had increased in number to the point where they had to be given some credence. Also, they became more fantastic in content. For instance, a bomber pilot insisted that a woman had ridden on the wing of his ship all the way to Asia, dropping from the plane in the highlands of western China. Zen regarded this story as obvious hallucination. Much of the data about the new people belonged in this category. He morosely wondered if it was possible to tell where reality left off and hallucination began. The colonel soon discovered that his job was not going to be as easy as he'd hoped.  Aside from the stories told by the soldiers--and the Asian fighting men also had their tales to tell--only one thing was certain: if the new people existed at all, they were very elusive. Only the grave of the man who had founded the group, old Jal Jonnor, was still to be found in the high Sierras of California. Zen did not go looking for this grave, but he saw photographs of it. He also studied the biographies that had been compiled on this colossal but enigmatical figure. Were the grave and the thick files the only remaining evidence that at least one human had dared to dream of a new day? Zen did not think so. Most of all, he longed to capture one of the new people for questioning.  Then, in a daring coup that was intended to strike a spearhead at the heart of America, Cuso, the top Asian fighting leader, and thousands of tough Asian paratroopers floated down into the mountains between British Columbia and the United States.  Cuso and his men, hiding out in the high mountain ranges, resisted all efforts to dislodge them. They became a festering thorn in the side of America, a threat that was not quite big enough to take seriously, or slight enough to overlook. He was hidden so deep in the mountain caverns that he could not be bombed out and the terrain was so rugged that his paratroopers could withstand the assault of a full army.  As his men began making forays into the lower ranges, searching for food and women, the inhabitants of the area fled in terror.  This was the situation when Kurt Zen accompanied a body of troops up the last fairly good trail toward Cuso's hidden lair. Neither the troops nor Cuso really interested him. What interested him was an army nurse with the medical detachment. He suspected this nurse was one of the new people.  In months of patient, painstaking work, she was the only good lead to this group that he had uncovered.  He was going up a steep mountain trail, with troops ahead and behind, when something that sounded like a wounded lion began to cough in the sky overhead.     II   Kurt Zen heard the lion cough in the sky overhead. He knew that it would hit in about four minutes and that it would seem to open a tunnel upward from hell, that the mountains would shake and tremble, that the air would vibrate and rattle as if a dozen thunderbolts had exploded at the same instant, and that a good number of the troops laboriously circling the incline of the ridge above would die.  He knew that more of them would die a horrible lingering death as a result of the radioactivity that would be released by the blast.  \"Pardon me, Nedra,\" he said to the nurse, who was just ahead of him.  She had stopped to stare upward.  \"Hit the dirt!\" Zen yelled at the troops. A few had already heard the lion cough in the sky and had begun to take cover, following the pattern of experienced fighters who never need an order to dive for the nearest hole. He saw, as he shouted, that the number who had already begun to hit the dirt was pitifully few and he knew the reason for this. Most of these men were green conscripts on their first fighting mission, the results of digging deep into a population that had already been scoured to the bone for manpower--and for everything else. Conscripts were likely to stare at the sky and die with their mouths open.  \"What is it?\" the girl asked. \"What's wrong?\"  \"Don't you hear that blooper in the sky overhead?\"  \"No. That is, I heard something make a noise up there. But--\" Mixed emotions moved across her face but fear was not among them. Instead, she seemed to be curious. \"But what is a blooper?\"  From a nurse, or from any living American, such a question was incredible. Zen stared at her in amazement.  \"Did I say the wrong thing, ask the wrong question?\"  \"You sure did,\" Zen answered. \"Come on.\"  \"But where are we going?\"  \"There!\" He nodded toward a prospect hole, one of the many that had been dug in these mountains by miners. As soon as he had heard the blooper cough its interrupted rocket blast when it changed direction in the sky, he had instantly looked for a hiding place. This tunnel seemed to fill the bill.  \"Is something going to happen?\" the nurse asked.  \"In less than two minutes you will find out,\" he answered. His long legs had already started taking him toward the hole. After hesitating for an instant, the nurse hastily followed him.  The prospect hole extended less than ten feet into the side of the mountain and was not timbered. This was good. It meant no heavy beams would collapse around their heads when the hills began to shake. A quick examination revealed that the stone of the roof seemed to be solid. Zen stopped within three feet of the entrance.  \"Why don't we go farther back?\" the nurse asked.  \"We're in far enough for protection from bits of flying metal but not too far to dig ourselves out if the roof should collapse--I hope,\" Zen answered.  Somewhere outside a man screamed, in terror.  The thing in the sky coughed again, closer now. BRRROOOMMM----BrrroooMMM----BrOOOm!  The blooper struck.  The sound was that of the simultaneous firing of many cannon. The walls of the prospect tunnel seemed to twist and wave. Loose stones dropped from the roof and a fine dust seemed to extrude from the walls. A boulder half as big as a small house hurtled past the entrance, snapping pines like matchsticks. A slide of loose rocks followed it. In the distance another slide could be heard growling back at the sky as it grew to avalanche proportions.  The nurse's fingers tightened on Zen's arm, then relaxed. Every nerve in his body was as taut as a steel wire as he waited for her reaction. Other than the tightening and relaxing of her fingers, there was none. Her hands remained on his arm and she remained in the tunnel with him. To Kurt Zen, this was disappointing.  \"What kind of nerves"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50138"],["title","Doomsday Eve (#2)"],["body","you have? Most women would have been in my arms and would have had their noses buried in my chest.\"  \"I'm sorry, colonel, if my education in how to be afraid has been neglected.\" She coughed at the dust.  \"Aren't you really afraid, Nedra?\" he asked.  \"No.\"  \"Then you aren't an ordinary human!\" The instant he had blurted out the words, he was sorry he had spoken. It was possible to give away too much too soon.  \"Then what am I?\" Her voice was calm.  He dodged her question. \"Aren't you even afraid to die?\"  \"When so many have died already, why should I hesitate to join them?\" the nurse answered. She released his arm and brushed dust from the shoulders of her uniform. She glanced up at him and it seemed that some kind of a radiation flowed from her eyes, a wave of it that sent a tingle over his entire skin surface. Outside, another smaller boulder went bouncing past the entrance to the tunnel. Fumbling in his pockets for cigarettes, Zen found a crumpled package. He offered one to the nurse but she thanked him and refused it. He did not insist. Cigarettes were too precious to waste on people who didn't really want them. Outside, another man began to scream. The nurse moved automatically in that direction. He caught her arm and held her back.  \"Wait until the rocks stop rolling, Nedra.\"  She did not protest. Looking up at him, she said, \"You think I'm one of the new people, don't you?\"  Zen coughed and swore at the cigarette, insisting that the tobacco was moist. This was a lie and both knew it. But--what to say? Her question was a complete stunner. \"What makes you think that?\" he asked, desperate for words.  \"I just think it. It's true, isn't it?\"  As an intelligence officer, Zen was accustomed to asking the questions, but this nurse had completely turned the tables on him. He took a deep drag on the cigarette. \"I don't know. Are you?\" He made his voice as casual as was possible.  Her eyes studied him. The trace of a smile came over her face and tugged at the comers of her lips. \"Do you mind if I ask you a question?\"  \"Go right ahead.\" The man had stopped screaming outside but another boulder was going past. In the distance, the avalanche was trying to grind to a halt but it sounded as if millions of tons of rock were on the move to a safer location.  \"Are _you_ one of the new people?\" the nurse asked.  The cough was real this time. Zen could not suppress his surprise. \"What on earth makes you ask a question like that?\"  \"I just felt like asking it,\" the nurse replied. \"Am I wrong?\"  \"Who are the new people?\"  \"Why, everybody has heard of them. They're the new race that is going to provide the nucleus for new growth after all ordinary men and women have been destroyed in this war.\" Surprise showed in her violet eyes. \"Do you mean you have never heard of them?\"  \"I've heard the usual rumors that are afloat,\" Zen said, shrugging. \"But all the stories have impressed me as a pack of lies. Really, I think the enemy has started most of them, to get us to relax our war effort.\"  \"Do you honestly think that?\" Her voice had a puzzled note in it. \"I mean, honestly and truly.\"  \"I think what the evidence tells me to think, nothing less. In this case, I have seen none of the so-called evidence.\"  Shrugging, Zen moved toward the opening of the tunnel, then drew back as a mass of rock crashed outside. \"It's raining boulders out there,\" he said. \"What do you know about the so-called new people?\"  \"Not much,\" she answered.  \"You're a very lovely liar, but the fact that you are lovely doesn't make you any less a liar,\" Zen said. She was very beautiful with her violet eyes and bronze hair, but an overworked intelligence officer could not be concerned with these things.  \"Thank you, colonel,\" she said. \"But I do not relish being called a liar.\" Her face showed hurt, just the right amount of it, but at the same time her eyes laughed at him. \"However, I guess there is nothing I can do about it, is there?\" Somehow she contrived to look like a small girl who has been unjustly accused of some deed she has not committed.  In the distance the avalanche had ground to a halt. Now, no more boulders were bounding down the hill. A vast, puzzled silence held the mountains. In that silence, Zen fancied he could hear the thoughts of the frightened men who had remained alive thus far, and were wondering how to prolong their precarious existence. They were also wondering if staying alive was worth the effort involved. Why not give up now and be done with all tragedy, with all tears, with all trying to find the road to the future?  Up the trail a man began to scream.  Like a homing pigeon that has finally found the right direction, the nurse moved toward the sound. Zen caught her arm again. Looking puzzled, she stopped. \"Please, colonel. I am needed up there.\" She nodded up the slope in the direction of the screaming man.  \"You are probably needed by many others,\" he commented.  She did not seem to understand. \"But I am a nurse. It is my duty to help those who are wounded.\"  \"I know.\" He was a little startled to find himself in sympathy with this impulse. \"But, not yet.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because that slope is still too hot to be safe.\" He held up his left wrist. Instead of a watch, he wore a miniature radiation counter there. The needle was creeping up toward the red line.  \"The radiation count is about forty right here at the mouth of this prospect hole,\" he pointed out.  \"That is interesting,\" the nurse said. The tone of her voice said it was not important.  \"Halfway up the slope, it will hit a hundred. At the top of the ridge, where the explosion took place, the count may reach a thousand.\" In his opinion, he had said enough.  In her opinion, he had not said anything at all. \"That makes no difference. Wounded men are up there. I am a nurse. My duty is clear to me.\"  \"If you try to help them under these circumstances, you will become a casualty yourself.\"  \"But what of the men who need help?\"  \"They will simply have to get out of the radiation zone themselves, or wait until the area is clear and help can reach them.\"  \"You are heartless!\"  \"Not at all,\" he denied. \"If anything could be done to help them I would be doing it. Don't you understand what has happened? That was an Asian N bomb that exploded. In an N bomb the immediate effect is minor. The real purpose of the weapon is to spray the area with high intensity radiation, to make the ground unfit for living for months. Any living creature caught within the direct blast of the radiation is doomed, and neither you, nor I, nor the medics, can do anything to help them--\" He broke off as another man began screaming up the slope.  The nurse was irresolute. \"But that man needs help,\" she pointed out.  \"Certainly he needs help,\" Zen agreed.  \"Well--\"  Zen watched her carefully. She seemed to understand his words but something else pulled at her far more strongly: the screaming of the injured man. Each time the soldier cried out, she started in his direction.  \"Well, well, thank you, colonel.\" Turning, she moved with a sure stride up the slope.  Zen swore under his breath and started after her, then caught the motion as the question rose in him as to why she should throw her life away. She knew the meaning of radiation in lethal quantities. Unquestionably, she also knew what would happen to any normal human who ventured into a hot zone.  Was she, then, a normal human being? Was he actually witnessing one of the miracles performed by the new people? If she came off the mountain slope alive, it would certainly prove something. Zen cursed again. She was going where he could not safely follow. If she returned unharmed, he had enough proof to warrant following her to the ends of the earth, if need be.     III   The radio transmitter inside Zen's pack was small but very powerful. It did not look like a radio transmitter at all; there was no antenna and no apparent source of power. Only the tiny earphone and the throat microphone revealed its true nature.  He slipped the phone into his ear, fitted the microphone against his throat, then picked up the piece of plastic tubing that was red on one end and green on the other. Wires ran from each end of this tube to the small box that housed the transmitter.  \"Red goes to the right hand,\" he muttered. \"Green to the left. Or is it the other way around?\" Making up his mind that red went to the right, he closed his fingers around the ends of the plastic tube, then watched the tiny meter on top of the small box that contained the transmitter.  The needle moved on the dial.  \"Calling nine dash nine,\" he spoke. \"This is six one calling nine dash nine.\" He repeated the call three times, then sat back on his haunches to await an answer.  \"Come in six one,\" the earphone said. \"What color is red?\"  \"It's green this week,\" Zen answered promptly.  \"What color was it last week?\"  \"Last week? Um. Oh, yes. No color.\"  \"And that means--\"  \"White. This is Kurt Zen, colonel, intelligence, reporting. Connect me immediately with General Stocker.\"  Satisfied with the identity of the caller, the operator said, \"Just a minute, colonel, I'll see if the general will talk to you.\"  \"Tell him it's important,\" Zen urged.  \"They always say that,\" the operator sighed. \"I'll put you through as soon as I can.\"  \"Kurt, boy, where are you?\" General Stacker's voice boomed into a distant microphone. The general's voice always boomed, he was always hearty, he was always sure that while things might look black right now, they would work out all right in the end. By the time the booming voice reached Zen's earphone, it had been transformed into a tinny squeak. Kurt thought he detected an uneasy note in the squeak and he wondered if the general had finally glimpsed the end, and was finding it not quite as he had supposed.  \"In hell, general,\" Zen answered. He swiftly told where he was and what had happened. \"Cuso's blooper knocked out the last pass by which we can bring an effective force against him."]]]
