It was like meeting a movie hero in the flesh, or a hero out of the pages of a book--Deer-slayer, John Clayton, Lord Greystoke.  She waited in the doorway to the laboratory and made no move to join them, merely acknowledged the two with a nod and a smile and a casual lift of the hand. They nodded and smiled back.  \"Hello, June,\" said Pat and continued telling his tale, but as they passed he lightly touched her arm.  \"Oh, pioneer!\" she said mockingly and softly to his passing profile, and knew that he had heard.         *       *       *       *       *  That night she had a nightmare. She was running down a long corridor looking for Max, but every man she came to was a big bronze man with red hair and bright blue eyes who grinned at her.  The pink hamster! She woke suddenly, feeling as if alarm bells had been ringing, and listened carefully, but there was no sound. She had had a nightmare, she told herself, but alarm bells were still ringing in her unconscious. Something was wrong.  Lying still and trying to preserve the images, she groped for a meaning, but the mood faded under the cold touch of reason. Damn intuitive thinking! A pink hamster! Why did the unconscious have to be so vague? She fell asleep again and forgot.  They had lunch with Pat Mead that day, and after it was over Pat delayed June with a hand on her shoulder and looked down at her for a moment. \"I want you, June,\" he said and then turned away, answering the hails of a party at another table as if he had not spoken. She stood shaken, and then walked to the door where Max waited.  She was particularly affectionate with Max the rest of the day, and it pleased him. He would not have been if he had known why. She tried to forget Pat's blunt statement.  June was in the laboratory with Max, watching the growth of a small tank culture of the alien protoplasm from a Minos weed, and listening to Len Marlow pour out his troubles.  \"And Elsie tags around after that big goof all day, listening to his stories. And then she tells me I'm just jealous, I'm imagining things!\" He passed his hand across his eyes. \"I came away from Earth to be with Elsie.... I'm getting a headache. Look, can't you persuade Pat to cut it out, June? You and Max are his friends.\"  \"Here, have an aspirin,\" June said. \"We'll see what we can do.\"  \"Thanks.\" Len picked up his tank culture and went out, not at all cheered.         *       *       *       *       *  Max sat brooding over the dials and meters at his end of the laboratory, apparently sunk in thought. When Len had gone, he spoke almost harshly.  \"Why encourage the guy? Why let him hope?\"  \"Found out anything about the differences in protoplasm?\" she evaded.  \"Why let him kid himself? What chance has he got against that hunk of muscle and smooth talk?\"  \"But Pat isn't after Elsie,\" she protested.  \"Every scatter-brained woman on this ship is trailing after Pat with her tongue hanging out. Brant St. Clair is in the bar right now. He doesn't say what he is drinking about, but do you think Pat is resisting all these women crowding down on him?\"  \"There are other things besides looks and charm,\" she said, grimly trying to concentrate on a slide under her binocular microscope.  \"Yeah, and whatever they are, Pat has them, too. Who's more competent to support a woman and a family on a frontier planet than a handsome bruiser who was born here?\"  \"I meant,\" June spun around on her stool with unexpected passion, \"there is old friendship, and there's fondness, and memories, and loyalty!\" She was half shouting.  \"They're not worth much on the second-hand market,\" Max said. He was sitting slumped on his lab stool, looking dully at his dials. \"Now _I'm_ getting a headache!\" He smiled ruefully. \"No kidding, a real headache. And over other people's troubles yet!\"  Other people's troubles.... She got up and wandered out into the long curving halls. \"I want you June,\" Pat's voice repeated in her mind. Why did the man have to be so overpoweringly attractive, so glaring a contrast to Max? Why couldn't the universe manage to run on without generating troublesome love triangles?         *       *       *       *       *  She walked up the curving ramps to the dining hall where they had eaten and drunk and talked yesterday. It was empty except for one couple talking forehead to forehead over cold coffee.  She turned and wandered down the long easy spiral of corridor to the pharmacy and dispensary. It was empty. George was probably in the test lab next door, where he could hear if he was wanted. The automatic vendor of harmless euphorics, stimulants and opiates stood in the corner, brightly decorated in pastel abstract designs, with its automatic tabulator graph glowing above it.  Max had a headache, she remembered. She recorded her thumbprint in the machine and pushed the plunger for a box of aspirins, trying to focus her attention on the problem of adapting the people of the ship to the planet Minos. An aquarium tank with a faint solution of histamine would be enough to convert a piece of human skin into a community of voracious active phagocytes individually seeking something to devour, but could they eat enough to live away from the rich sustaining plasma of human blood?  After the aspirins, she pushed another plunger for something for herself. Then she stood looking at it, a small box with three pills in her hand--Theobromine, a heart strengthener and a confidence-giving euphoric all in one, something to steady shaky nerves. She had used it before only in emergency. She extended a hand and looked at it. It was trembling. Damn triangles!  While she was looking at her hand there was a click from the automatic drug vendor. It summed the morning use of each drug in the vendors throughout the ship, and recorded it in a neat addition to the end of each graph line. For a moment she could not find the green line for anodynes and the red line for stimulants, and then she saw that they went almost straight up.  There were too many being used--far too many to be explained by jealousy or psychosomatic peevishness. This was an epidemic, and only one disease was possible!  The disinfecting of Pat had not succeeded. Nucleocat Cureall, killer of all infections, had not cured! Pat had brought melting sickness into the ship with him!  Who had it?  The drugs vendor glowed cheerfully, uncommunicative. She opened a panel in its side and looked in on restless interlacing cogs, and on the inside of the door saw printed some directions.... \"To remove or examine records before reaching end of the reel--\"  After a few fumbling minutes she had the answer. In the cafeteria at breakfast and lunch, thirty-eight men out of the forty-eight aboard ship had taken more than his norm of stimulant. Twenty-one had taken aspirin as well. The only woman who had made an unusual purchase was herself!  She remembered the hamsters that had thrown off the infection with a short sharp fever, and checked back in the records to the day before. There was a short rise in aspirin sales to women at late afternoon. The women were safe.  It was the men who had melting sickness!  Melting sickness killed in hours, according to Pat Mead. How long had the men been sick?         *       *       *       *       *  As she was leaving, Jerry came into the pharmacy, recorded his thumbprint and took a box of aspirin from the machine.  She felt all right. Self-control was working well and it was pleasant still to walk down the corridor smiling at the people who passed. She took the emergency elevator to the control room and showed her credentials to the technician on watch.  \"Medical Emergency.\" At a small control panel in the corner was a large red button, precisely labeled. She considered it and picked up the control room phone. This was the hard part, telling someone, especially someone who had it--Max.  She dialed, and when the click on the end of the line showed he had picked the phone up, she told Max what she had seen.  \"No women, just the men,\" he repeated. \"That right?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Probably it's chemically alien, inhibited by one of the female sex hormones. We'll try sex hormone shots, if we have to. Where are you calling from?\"  She told him.  \"That's right. Give Nucleocat Cureall another chance. It might work this time. Push that button.\"  She went to the panel and pushed the large red button. Through the long height of the _Explorer_, bells woke to life and began to ring in frightened clangor, emergency doors thumped shut, mechanical apparatus hummed into life and canned voices began to give rapid urgent directions.  A plague had come.         *       *       *       *       *  She obeyed the mechanical orders, went out into the hall and walked in line with the others. The captain walked ahead of her and the gorgeous Shelia Davenport fell into step beside her. \"I look like a positive hag this morning. Does that mean I'm sick? Are we all sick?\"  June shrugged, unwilling to say what she knew.  Others came out of all rooms into the corridor, thickening the line. They could hear each room lock as the last person left it, and then, faintly, the hiss of disinfectant spray. Behind them, on the heels of the last person in line, segments of the ship slammed off and began to hiss.  They wound down the spiral corridor until they reached the medical treatment section again, and there they waited in line.  \"It won't scar my arms, will it?\" asked Shelia apprehensively, glancing at her smooth, lovely arms.  The mechanical voice said, \"Next. Step inside, please, and stand clear of the door.\"  \"Not a bit,\" June reassured Shelia, and stepped into the cubicle.  Inside, she was directed from cubicle to cubicle and given the usual buffeting by sprays and radiation, had blood samples taken and was injected with Nucleocat and a series of other protectives. At last she was directed through another door into a tiny cubicle with a chair.  \"You are to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50774"],["title","Contagion (#4)"],["body"," here,\" commanded the recorded voice metallically. \"In twenty minutes the door will unlock and you may then leave. All people now treated may visit all parts of the ship which have been protected. It is forbidden to visit any quarantined or unsterile part of the ship without permission from the medical officers.\"  Presently the door unlocked and she emerged into bright lights again, feeling slightly battered.  She was in the clinic. A few men sat on the edge of beds and looked sick. One was lying down. Brant and Bess St. Clair sat near each other, not speaking.  Approaching her was George Barton, reading a thermometer with a puzzled expression.  \"What is it, George?\" she asked anxiously.  \"Some of the women have slight fever, but it's going down. None of the fellows have any--but their white count is way up, their red count is way down, and they look sick to me.\"  She approached St. Clair. His usually ruddy cheeks were pale, his pulse was light and too fast, and his skin felt clammy. \"How's the headache? Did the Nucleocat treatment help?\"  \"I feel worse, if anything.\"  \"Better set up beds,\" she told George. \"Get everyone back into the clinic.\"  \"We're doing that,\" George assured her. \"That's what Hal is doing.\"  She went back to the laboratory. Max was pacing up and down, absently running his hands through his black hair until it stood straight up. He stopped when he saw her face, and scowled thoughtfully. \"They are still sick?\" It was more a statement than a question.  She nodded.  \"The Cureall didn't cure this time,\" he muttered. \"That leaves it up to us. We have melting sickness and according to Pat and the hamsters, that leaves us less than a day to find out what it is and learn how to stop it.\"  Suddenly an idea for another test struck him and he moved to the work table to set it up. He worked rapidly, with an occasional uncoordinated movement betraying his usual efficiency.  It was strange to see Max troubled and afraid.  She put on a laboratory smock and began to work. She worked in silence. The mechanicals had failed. Hal and George Barton were busy staving off death from the weaker cases and trying to gain time for Max and her to work. The problem of the plague had to be solved by the two of them alone. It was in their hands.  Another test, no results. Another test, no results. Max's hands were shaking and he stopped a moment to take stimulants.  She went into the ward for a moment, found Bess and warned her quietly to tell the other women to be ready to take over if the men became too sick to go on. \"But tell them calmly. We don't want to frighten the men.\" She lingered in the ward long enough to see the word spread among the women in a widening wave of paler faces and compressed lips; then she went back to the laboratory.  Another test. There was no sign of a micro-organism in anyone's blood, merely a growing horde of leucocytes and phagocytes, prowling as if mobilized to repel invasion.         *       *       *       *       *  Len Marlow was wheeled in unconscious, with Hal Barton's written comments and conclusions pinned to the blanket.  \"I don't feel so well myself,\" the assistant complained. \"The air feels thick. I can't breathe.\"  June saw that his lips were blue. \"Oxygen short,\" she told Max.  \"Low red corpuscle count,\" Max answered. \"Look into a drop and see what's going on. Use mine; I feel the same way he does.\" She took two drops of Max's blood. The count was low, falling too fast.  Breathing is useless without the proper minimum of red corpuscles in the blood. People below that minimum die of asphyxiation although their lungs are full of pure air. The red corpuscle count was falling too fast. The time she and Max had to work in was too short.  \"Pump some more CO_{2} into the air system,\" Max said urgently over the phone. \"Get some into the men's end of the ward.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She looked through the microscope at the live sample of blood. It was a dark clear field and bright moving things spun and swirled through it, but she could see nothing that did not belong there.  \"Hal,\" Max called over the general speaker system, \"cut the other treatments, check for accelerating anemia. Treat it like monoxide poisoning--CO_{2} and oxygen.\"  She reached into a cupboard under the work table, located two cylinders of oxygen, cracked the valves and handed one to Max and one to the assistant. Some of the bluish tint left the assistant's face as he breathed and he went over to the patient with reawakened concern.  \"Not breathing, Doc!\"  Max was working at the desk, muttering equations of hemoglobin catalysis.  \"Len's gone, Doc,\" the assistant said more loudly.  \"Artificial respiration and get him into a regeneration tank,\" said June, not moving from the microscope. \"Hurry! Hal will show you how. The oxidation and mechanical heart action in the tank will keep him going. Put anyone in a tank who seems to be dying. Get some women to help you. Give them Hal's instructions.\"  The tanks were ordinarily used to suspend animation in a nutrient bath during the regrowth of any diseased organ. It could preserve life in an almost totally destroyed body during the usual disintegration and regrowth treatments for cancer and old age, and it could encourage healing as destruction continued ... but they could not prevent ultimate death as long as the disease was not conquered.  The drop of blood in June's microscope was a great, dark field, and in the foreground, brought to gargantuan solidity by the stereo effect, drifted neat saucer shapes of red blood cells. They turned end for end, floating by the humped misty mass of a leucocyte which was crawling on the cover glass. There were not enough red corpuscles, and she felt that they grew fewer as she watched.  She fixed her eye on one, not blinking in fear that she would miss what might happen. It was a tidy red button, and it spun as it drifted, the current moving it aside in a curve as it passed by the leucocyte.  Then, abruptly, the cell vanished.  June stared numbly at the place where it had been.  Behind her, Max was calling over the speaker system again: \"Dr. Stark speaking. Any technician who knows anything about the life tanks, start bringing more out of storage and set them up. Emergency.\"  \"We may need forty-seven,\" June said quietly.  \"We may need forty-seven,\" Max repeated to the ship in general. His voice did not falter. \"Set them up along the corridor. Hook them in on extension lines.\"  His voice filtered back from the empty floors above in a series of dim echoes. What he had said meant that every man on board might be on the point of heart stoppage.         *       *       *       *       *  June looked blindly through the binocular microscope, trying to think. Out of the corner of her eyes she could see that Max was wavering and breathing more and more frequently of the pure, cold, burning oxygen of the cylinders. In the microscope she could see that there were fewer red cells left alive in the drop of his blood. The rate of fall was accelerating.  She didn't have to glance at Max to know how he would look--skin pale, black eyebrows and keen brown eyes slightly squinted in thought, a faint ironical grin twisting the bluing lips. Intelligent, thin, sensitive, his face was part of her mind. It was inconceivable that Max could die. He couldn't die. He couldn't leave her alone.  She forced her mind back to the problem. All the men of the _Explorer_ were at the same point, wherever they were.  Moving to Max's desk, she spoke into the intercom system: \"Bess, send a couple of women to look through the ship, room by room, with a stretcher. Make sure all the men are down here.\" She remembered Reno. \"Sparks, heard anything from Reno? Is he back?\"  Sparks replied weakly after a lag. \"The last I heard from Reno was a call this morning. He was raving about mirrors, and Pat Mead's folks not being real people, just carbon copies, and claiming he was crazy; and I should send him the psychiatrist. I thought he was kidding. He didn't call back.\"  \"Thanks, Sparks.\" Reno was lost.  Max dialed and spoke to the bridge over the phone. \"Are you okay up there? Forget about engineering controls. Drop everything and head for the tanks while you can still walk.\"  June went back to the work table and whispered into her own phone. \"Bess, send up a stretcher for Max. He looks pretty bad.\"  There had to be a solution. The life tanks could sustain life in a damaged body, encouraging it to regrow more rapidly, but they merely slowed death as long as the disease was not checked. The postponement could not last long, for destruction could go on steadily in the tanks until the nutritive solution would hold no life except the triumphant microscopic killers that caused melting sickness.  There were very few red blood corpuscles in the microscope field now, incredibly few. She tipped the microscope and they began to drift, spinning slowly. A lone corpuscle floated through the center. She watched it as the current swept it in an arc past the dim off-focus bulk of the leucocyte. There was a sweep of motion and it vanished.  For a moment it meant nothing to her; then she lifted her head from the microscope and looked around. Max sat at his desk, head in hand, his rumpled short black hair sticking out between his fingers at odd angles. A pencil and a pad scrawled with formulas lay on the desk before him. She could see his concentration in the rigid set of his shoulders. He was still thinking; he had not given up.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Max, I just saw a leucocyte grab a red blood corpuscle. It was unbelievably fast.\"  \"Leukemia,\" muttered Max without moving. \"Galloping leukemia yet! That comes under the heading of cancer. Well, that's part of the answer. It might be all we need.\" He grinned feebly and reached for the speaker set. \"Anybody still on his feet in there?\" he muttered into it, and the question was amplified to a booming voice"]]]
