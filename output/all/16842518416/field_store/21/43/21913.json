And you're Johnny--right?\"  \" ... Right.\"  \"You know,\" Greta said, \"you're cute.\"  Behind her the party was still going on, but its volume seemed to have diminished a little. Or maybe, Johnny thought, he was getting used to it. \"You're cute too,\" he said awkwardly, not knowing any more what he did want to do, or where he wanted to be. Her grasp on his arm was the main fact in the world.  \"Thanks,\" she said. \"Here.\"  And as suddenly as that she was in his arms, plastered up against him, pressed to him as tightly as he could imagine, her mouth on his, her hands locked behind his neck: he was choking, he couldn't breathe, he couldn't move....  The door behind him opened and shoved him gently across his back.  He fell, and he fell on top of her.  It seemed as if the entire party had stopped to watch him. There was no noise. There was no sound at all. He climbed to his feet to face the eyes and found they were not on him, but behind him.  A tiny white-haired woman stood there, her mouth one thin line of disapproval. \"Well,\" she said. \"Having a good time?\"         *       *       *       *       *  In Dodd's mind, then and later, the sign began.  That was, as far as he could ever remember, the first second he had even seen it. It was there, behind his eyes, blinking on and off, like a neon sign. Sometimes he paid no attention to it, but it was always there, always telling him the same thing.  _This is the end._  _This is the end._  _This is the end._  He looked into that ancient grim face and the sign began. And from then on it never stopped, never stopped at all--  Until, of course, the end.         *       *       *       *       *                            PUBLIC OPINION ONE      Being an excerpt from a speech delivered by Grigor Pellasin     (Citizen, white male, age forty-seven, two arrests for Disorderly     Conduct,  occupation variable, residence variable) in the district     of Hyde Park, city of London, country of England, planet Earth of     the Confederation, in the year of the Confederation two hundred and     ten, on May fourteenth, from two-thirty-seven P. M. (Greenwich)     until three-forty-six P. M. (Greenwich), no serious incidents     reported.  They all talk about equality, friends, and you know what equality is? Equality is a license to rob you blind and steal you blind, to cut you up and leave the pieces for the garbage collector, to stuff what's left of you down an oubliette, friend, and forget about you. That's what equality is, friends, and don't you let them tell you any different.  Why, years ago there used to be servants, people who did what you told them. And the servants got liberated, friends, they all got freedom and equality so they were just like us. Maybe you can remember about those servants, because they're all in the history books, and the historical novels, and maybe you do a little light reading now and then, am I right about that?  Well, sir, those servants got themselves liberated, and do you think they liked it? Do you think they liked being free and equal?  Oh, don't ask the government, friends, because the government is going to tell you they liked it just fine, going to tell you they loved it being just like everybody else, free and equal and liberated at last.  The government's going to tell you a lot of things, and my advice is, friends, my advice is do some looking and listening for yourself and think it all out to the right conclusions. Otherwise you're just letting the government do all your thinking for you and that's something you don't want.  No, friends, you do your own thinking and you figure out whether they liked being free, these servants.  You know what being free meant for them?  It meant being out of work.  And how do you think they liked that?  Now, maybe here among us today, among you kind people listening to what I've got to say to you, maybe there are one or two who've been out of work during their lifetimes. Am I right? Well, friends, you tell the others here what it felt like.  It felt hopeless and dragged-out and like something you'd never want to go through again, am I right?  Of course I'm right, friends. But there was nothing you could do about being out of work. If you were out of work that was that, and you were through, no chance, no place to move.  These servants, friends, they liked being servants. I know that's hard to believe because everybody's been telling you different all your lives, but you just do a little independent thinking, the way I have, and you'll see. It was a good job, being a servant. It was steady and dependable and you knew where you stood.  Better than being out of work? You bet your last credit, you bet your very last ounce of bounce on that, friends.  And better than a lot of other things, too. They were safe and warm and happy, and they felt fine.  And then a lot of busybodies came along and liberated them.  Well, friends, some of them went right back and asked to be servants again--they did so. It's a historical fact. But that was no good: the machines had taken over and there was no room for them.  They were liberated for good.  And the lesson you learn from that, friends, is just this: don't go around liberating people until you know what they want. Maybe they're happier the way they are.  Now, out on a far planet there's a strange race. Maybe you've heard about them, because they work for us, they help get us the metals we need to keep going. They're part of the big line of supply that keeps us all alive, you and me both.  And there are some people talking about liberating those creatures, too, which aren't even human beings. They're green and they got one eye apiece, and they don't talk English except a little, or any Confederation tongue.  Yet even so there are people who want to liberate those creatures.  Now, you sit back and think a minute. Do those creatures want to be liberated? Is it like liberating you and me, who know what's what and can think and make decisions? Because being free and equal means voting and everything else. Do you want these green creatures voting in the same assemblies as yours?  If it were cruel to keep them the way they are, working on their own world and being fed and kept warm and safe, why, I'd say go ahead and liberate them. But what's cruel about it, friends?  They're safe--safer than they would be on their own.  They're fed well and kept warm.  And remember those servants, friends. Maybe the greenies like their life, too. It's their world and their metal--they have a right to help send it along.  You don't want to act hastily, friends, now do you?  My advice to you is this: just let the greenies alone. Just let them be, the way they want to be, and don't go messing around where there's no need to mess around. Because if anybody starts to do that, why, it can lead to trouble, friends, to a whole lot of unnecessary bother and trouble.  Am I right?     5   \"I don't mind parties, Norma, not ordinary parties. But that one didn't look like an ordinary party.\"  Norma stood her ground in front of the desk. This, after all, was important \"But, Dr. Haenlingen, we--\"  \"Don't try to persuade me,\" the little old woman said sharply. \"Don't try to cozen me into something: I know all the tricks, Norma. I invented a good third of them, and it's been a long time since I had to use a textbook to remember the rest.\"  \"I'm not trying to persuade you of anything.\" The woman wouldn't listen, that was the whole trouble: in the harsh bright light of morning she sat like a stone statue, casting a shadow of black on the polished desk. This was Dr. Haenlingen--and how did you talk to Dr. Haenlingen? But it was important, Norma reminded herself again: it was perfectly possible that the entire group of people at the party would be downgraded, or at the least get marked down on their records. \"But we weren't doing anything harmful. If you have a party you've got to expect people to--oh, to get over-enthusiastic, maybe. But certainly there was nothing worth getting angry about. There was--\"  \"I'm sure you've thought all this out,\" Dr. Haenlingen said tightly. \"You seem to have your case well prepared, and it would be a pleasure to listen to you.\"  \"But--\"  \"Unfortunately,\" the woman continued in a voice like steel, \"I have a great deal of work to do this morning.\"  \"Dr. Haenlingen--\"  \"I'm sorry,\" she said, but she didn't sound sorry in the least. Her eyes went down to a pile of papers on the desk. A second passed.  \"You've got to listen to me,\" Norma said. \"What you're doing is unfair.\"  Dr. Haenlingen didn't look up. \"Oh?\"  \"They were just--having fun,\" Norma said. \"There was nothing wrong, nothing at all. You happened to come in at a bad moment, but it didn't mean anything, there wasn't anything going on that should have bothered you....\"  \"Perhaps not,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"Unfortunately, what bothers me is not reducible to rule.\"  \"But you're going to act on it,\" Norma said. \"You're going to--\"  \"Yes?\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"What am I going to do?\"  \"Well, you--\"  \"Downgrade the persons who were there?\" Dr. Haenlingen asked. \"Enter remarks in the permanent records? Prevent promotion? Just what am I supposed to have in mind?\"  \"Well, I thought--I--\"  \"I plan,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"nothing whatever. Not just at present. I want to think about what I saw, about the people I saw. At present, nothing more.\"  There was a little silence. Norma felt herself relax. Then she asked: \"At present?\"  Dr. Haenlingen looked up at her, the eyes ice-cold and direct. \"What action I determine to take,\" she said, \"will be my responsibility. Mine alone. I do not intend to discuss it, or to attempt to justify it, to you or to anyone.\"  \"Yes, Dr. Haenlingen.\" Norma stood awkwardly. \"Thank you--\"  \"Don't thank me--yet,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"Go and do your own work. I've got quite a lot to oversee here.\" She went back to her papers."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51855"],["title","Slave Planet (#5)"],["body","turned, stopped and then walked to the door. At the door she turned again but Dr. Haenlingen was paying no visible attention to her. She opened the door, went out and closed it behind her.  In the corridor she took one deep breath and then another.  The trouble was, you couldn't depend on the woman to do anything. She meant exactly what she had said: \"For the present.\" And who could tell what might happen later?  Norma headed for her own cubicle, where she ignored the papers and the telephone messages waiting for her and reached for the intercom button instead. She pushed it twice and a voice said:  \"What happened?\"  \"It's not good, Greta,\" Norma said. \"It's--well, undecided, anyhow: we've got that much going for us.\"  \"Undecided?\" the voice asked.  \"She said she wouldn't do anything--yet. But she left it open.\"  \"Oh. Lord. Oh, my.\"  Norma nodded at the intercom speaker. \"That's right. Anything's possible--you know what she's like.\"  \"Oh, Lord. Do I.\"  \"And--Greta, why did you have to be there, right by the door, with that strange type--as if it had been set up for her? Right in front of her eyes....\"  \"An accident,\" Greta said. \"A pure by-God accident. When she walked in, when I saw her, believe me, Norma, my blood ran absolutely cold. Temperature of ice, or something colder than ice.\"  \"Just that one look, just that one long look around.\" Norma said, \"and she was gone. As if she'd memorized us, every one of us, filed the whole thing away and didn't need to see any more.\"  \"I would have explained. But there wasn't any time.\"  \"I know,\" Norma said. \"Greta, who was he, anyhow?\"  \"Him?\" Greta said. \"Who knows? A friend of Cendar's--you know Cendar, don't you?\"  \"Albin Cendar?\"  \"That's the one. He--\"  \"But he's not from Psych.\" Norma said.  \"Neither is his friend, I guess,\" Greta said. \"But they come over, you know that--Cendar's always around.\"  \"And you had to invite them....\"  \"Invite?\" Greta said. \"I didn't invite anybody. They were there, that's all. Cendar always shows up. You know that.\"  \"Great,\" Nonna said. \"So last night he had to bring a friend and the friend got grabby--\"  \"No,\" Greta said. \"He was--well, confused maybe. Never been to a party of ours before, or anyhow not that I remember. I was trying to--loosen him up.\"  \"You loosened everybody up,\" Norma said.  There was a silence.  \"I'm sorry,\" Norma said. \"All right. You couldn't have known--\"  \"I didn't know anything,\" Greta's voice said. \"She was there, that's all.\"  \"I wonder whether Dr. Haenlingen knew him,\" Norma said. \"The new one, I mean.\"  \"His name was Johnny something,\" Greta said.  \"We'll just have to wait and find out,\" Norma said. \"Whatever she's going to do, there isn't any way to stop it. I did the best I could--\"  \"Sure you did,\" Greta said. \"We know that. Sure.\"  \"Cendar and his friends--\" Norma began.  \"Oh, forget about that,\" Greta said. \"Who cares about them?\"     6   The party had meant nothing, nothing at all, and Albin told himself he could forget all about it.  If Haenlingen wanted to take any action, he insisted, she'd take it against her own division. The Psych people would get most of it. Why, she probably didn't even know who Albin Cendar was....  But the Psych division knew a lot they weren't supposed to know. Maybe she would even....  Forget about it, Albin told himself. He closed his eyes for a second and concentrated on his work. That, at least, was something to keep him from worrying: the whole process of training was something he could use in forgetting all about the party, and Haenlingen, and possible consequences.... He took a few breaths and forced his mind away from all of that, back to the training.  Training was a dreary waste of time, as a matter of fact--except that it happened to be necessary. There was no doubt of that: without sufficient manual labor, the metal would not be dug, the smelters would not run, the purifying stages and the cooling stages and even the shipping itself would simply stop. Automation would have solved everything, but automation was expensive. The Alberts were cheap--so Fruyling's World used Alberts instead of transistors and cryogenic relays.  And if you were going to use Alberts at all, Albin thought, you sure as hell had to train them. God alone knew what harm they could do, left alone in a wilderness of delicate machinery without any instructions.  All the same, \"dreary\" was the word for it. (An image of Dr. Haenlingen's frozen face floated into his mind. He pushed it away. It was morning. It was time for work.)  He met Derban at the turn in the corridor, perhaps fifty feet before the Alberts' door. That wasn't strictly according to the rules, and Albin knew it: he had learned the code as early as anyone else. But the rules were for emergencies--and emergencies didn't happen any more. The Alberts weren't about to revolt.  He was carrying his Belbis beam, of course. The little metal tube didn't look like much, but it was guaranteed to stop anything short of a spaceship in its tracks, and by the very simple method of making holes. The Belbis beam would make holes in nearly anything: Alberts, people or most materials. It projected a quarter-inch beam of force in as near a straight line as Einsteinian physics would allow, and it was extremely efficient. Albin had been practicing with it for three years, twice a week.  Everybody did. Not that there's ever been a chance to use it.  And there wasn't going to be a chance, Albin decided. He exchanged a word or two absently with Derban and they went to the door together. Albin reached for the door but Derban's big brown hand was already on it. He grinned and swung the door open.  Air conditioning had done something to minimize the reek inside, but not much. Albin devoted most of his attention to keeping his face a complete mask. The last thing he wanted was to retch--not in front of the Alberts, who didn't really exist for him, but in front of Derban. And the party (which he wasn't going to think about) hadn't left his stomach in perfect shape.  The Alberts, seeing these masters enter stirred and rose. Albin barked at them in a voice that was only very slightly choked: \"Form a line. Form a line.\"  The Alberts milled around, quite obviously uncertain what a line was. Albin gripped his beam tighter, not because it was a weapon but just because he needed something handy to take out his anger on.  \"Damn it,\" he said tightly, \"a line. Form a straight line.\"  \"It's only their second day,\" Derban said in a low voice. \"Give them time.\" Albin could barely hear him over the confused babble of the Alberts. He shook his head and felt a new stab of anger.  \"One behind the other,\" he told the milling crowd. \"A line, a straight line.\"  After a little more confusion, Albin was satisfied. He sighed heavily and beckoned with his beam: the Alberts started forward, through the door and out into the corridor.  Albin went before, Derban behind, falling naturally into step. They came to the great elevator and Albin pushed a stud. The door slid open.  The Alberts, though, didn't want to go in. They huddled, looking at the elevator with big round eyes, muttering to themselves and to each other. Derban spoke up calmly: \"This is the same room you were in yesterday. It won't hurt you. Just go through the door. It's all right.\" But the words had very little effect. A few of the Alberts moved closer and then, discovering that they were alone, hurriedly moved back again. The elevator door remained open, waiting.  Albin, ready to shriek with rage by now, felt a touch at his arm. One of the Alberts was standing near him, looking up. Its eye blinked: it spoke. \"Why does the room move?\" The voice was not actually unpleasant, but its single eye stared at Albin, making him uncomfortable. He told himself not to blow up. Calm. _Calm._  \"The room moves because it moves,\" he said, a little too quickly. \"Because the masters tell it to move. What do you want to know for?\"  \"I want to learn,\" the Albert said calmly.  \"Well, don't ask questions,\" Albin said. He kept one eye on the shifting mob. \"If there's anything good for you to know, you'll be told. Meanwhile, just don't ask any questions.\"  The Albert looked downcast. \"Can I learn without questions?\"  Albin's control snapped. \"Damn it, you'll learn what you have to!\" he yelled. \"You don't have to ask questions--you're a slave. A slave! Get that through your green head and shut up!\"  The tone had two effects. First, it made the Albert near him move back, staring at him still with that single bright eye. Second, the others started for the elevator, apparently pushed more by the tone than the words. A master was angry. That, they judged, meant trouble. Acceding to his wishes was the safest thing to do.  And so, in little, frightened bunches, they went in. When they were all clear of the door, Albin and Derban stepped in, too, and the doors slid shut. Derban took a second to mutter secretly: \"You don't have to lose your temper. You're on a hell of a thin edge this morning.\"  Albin flicked his eyes over the brown face, the stocky, stolid figure. \"So I'm on a thin edge,\" he said. \"Aren't you?\"  \"Training is training,\" Derban said. \"Got to put up with it, because what can you do about it?\"  Albin grinned wryly. \"I told somebody else that, last night,\" he said. \"Man named Dodd--hell, you know Johnny Dodd. Told him he needed some fun. Holy jumping beavers--fun.\"  \"Maybe you need some,\" Derban said.  \"Not like last night, I don't,\" Albin said, and the elevator door opened.  Now others took over, guiding the Alberts to their individual places on the training floor. Each had a small room to himself, and each room had a spy-TV high up in a corner as a safeguard.  But the spy-eyes were just as much good as the beams, Albin thought. They were useless precautions: rebellion wasn't about to happen. It made more sense, if you thought about it, to worry the way Johnny Dodd worried, about the Confederation--against which spy-eyes and Belbis"]]]
