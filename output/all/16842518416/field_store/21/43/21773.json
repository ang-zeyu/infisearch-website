How can all share a single emotional experience?\"  His researches delved deeply into the Hrrshtk compositions, and a tentative theory based on the Most Common Harmonic, now shown to have been totally mistaken, led to the T85 discoveries.  The Hrrshtk notes, however, found long afterward, provide the real answer.  Among a pile of sketches and musical fragments was found a long list--or, rather, a series of lists. In the form of a Galactic Dictionary, the paper is divided into many columns, each headed with the name of a different planet.  Rather than describe this document, we are printing an excerpt from it herewith:      DENEB III  TERRA    MARS       FOMALHAUT II  SIRIUS VII     Love       Anger    Hunger     Sadness       Madness     Hate       Joy      F'rit      Prayer        Love     Prayer     Madness  Sadness    Full          Joy     Vilb       NPE      Non-F'rit  Golk          NPE  In completed form, the document contains over one hundred and fifty separate listings for race, and over six hundred separate emotional or subject headings. In some places (like the Terra and Sirius listing for Vilb, above), the text is marked NPE, and this has been taken to mean No Precise Equivalent. For instance, such a marking appears after the Denebian _shhr_ for both Terra and Mars, although Sirius has the listing _grk_ and Fomalhaut _plarat_ in the desert.  Hrrshtk may be hailed, therefore, as the discoverer of the Doctrine of Emotional Equivalency, later promulgated in a different form by Space Patrol Psychiatrist Rodney Garman. Further, the document alluded to above explains a phrase in Hrrshtk's noted letter to Dibble Young, which has puzzled commentators since its first appearance.  Hrrshtk is here alluding to the composition of his Revolutionary Ode, which all Terra knows as the most perfect expression of true love to be found in music:  \"It's a Revolutionary Ode to me, my friend--but not to you. As we say here, one man's mood is another man's passion.\"         *       *       *       *       *  _SEPTEMBER 1_: On this date in the year 9909, Treth Schmaltar died on his home planet of Wellington V. All the Galaxy knows his famous Symphonic Storm Suite; less known, but equally interesting, is the history and development of its solo instrument.  The natives of Wellington V feed on airborne plankton, which is carried by the vibrations of sound or speech. This was a little-known fact for many years, but did account for the joy with which the first explorers on Wellington V were greeted. Their speech created waves that fed the natives.  When eating, the natives emit a strange humming noise, due to the action of the peculiar glottis. These facts drove the first settlers, like Treth Schmaltar, to the invention of a new instrument.  This was a large drumlike construction with a small hole in its side through which airborne plankton could enter. Inside the drum, a Wellingtonian crouched. When the drum was beaten, the air vibrations drove plankton into the native's mouth, and he ate and hummed.  (A mechanical device has since replaced the native. This is, of course, due to the terrific expense of importing both natives and plankton to other planets than Wellington V for concerts.)  Thus, a peculiarity of native life led not only to the Symphonic Storm Suite, but to such lovely compositions as Schmaltar's Hum-Drum Sonata.         *       *       *       *       *  _SEPTEMBER 30_: The victimization of the swanlike inhabitants of Harsh XII, perhaps the most pitiful musical scandal of the ages, was begun by Ferd Pill, born on this date in 8181. Pill, who died penitent in a neuterary of the Benedictine Order, is said to have conceived his idea after perusing some early Terran legends about the swan.  He never represented himself as the composer, but always as the agent or representative of a Harsh XII inhabitant. In the short space of three years, he sold over two hundred songs, none of great length but all, as musicians agree to this day, of a startling and almost un-Hnau-like beauty.  When a clerk in the records department of Pill's publishers discovered that Pill, having listed himself as the heir of each of the Harsh XII composers, was in fact collecting their money, an investigation began.  That the composers were in fact dead was easily discovered. That Pill was their murderer was the next matter that came to light.  In an agony of self-abasement, Pill confessed his crime. \"The Harshians don't sing at all,\" he said. \"They don't make a sound. But--like the legendary swan of old Terra--they do deliver themselves of one song in dying. I murdered them in order to record these songs, and then sold the recordings.\"  Pill's subsequent escape from the prison in which he was confined, and his trip to the sanctuary of the neuterary, were said to have been arranged by the grateful widow of one of the murdered Harshians, who had been enabled by her mate's death to remarry with a younger and handsomer Harshian.         *       *       *       *       *  _DECEMBER 5_: Today marks the birthday of Timmis Calk, a science teacher of Lavoris II.  Calk is almost forgotten today, but his magnificent Student Orchestra created a storm both of approval and protest when it was first seen in 9734. Critics on both sides of what rapidly became a Galaxywide controversy were forced, however, to acknowledge the magnificent playing of the Student Orchestra and its great technical attainments.  Its story begins with Calk himself and his sweetheart, a lovely being named Silla.  Though Calk's love for Silla was true and profound, Silla did not return his affectionate feelings. She was an anti-scientist, a musician. The sects were split on Lavoris II to such an extent that marriage between Calk and his beloved would have meant crossing the class lines--something which Silla, a music-lover, was unwilling to contemplate.  Calk therefore determined to prove to her that a scientist could be just as artistic as any musician. Months of hard work followed, until finally he was ready.  He engaged the great Drick Hall for his first concert--and the program consisted entirely of classical works of great difficulty. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony opened the program, and Fenk's Reversed Ode closed it. Calk had no time for the plaudits of critics and audience; he went searching for Silla.  But he was too late. She had heard his concert--and had immediately accepted the marriage proposal of a childhood sweetheart.  Calk nearly committed suicide. But at the last moment, he tossed the spraying-bottle away and went back to Silla.  \"Why?\" he said. \"Why did you reject me, after hearing the marvelous music which I created?\"  \"You are not a musician, but a scientist,\" Silla said. \"Any musician would have refrained from _growing_ his orchestra from seeds.\"  Unable to understand her esthetic revulsion, Calk determined there and then to continue his work with the Student Orchestra (it made a great deal more money than science-teaching). Wrapping his rootlets around his branches, he rolled away from her with crackling dignity."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51623"],["title","Always a Qurono (#0)"],["body","A Qurono                               By JIM HARMON                           Illustrated by RITTER             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                      Galaxy Magazine August 1962.

All you need do is              geoplanct. All you need know is when to stop!   Barnhart sauntered right into the middle of them. He covertly watched the crew close in around him and he never twitched an eyelash. _Officers must never panic_, he reminded himself, and manipulated the morning sighting on the nearest sun through the Fitzgerald lens. It was exactly 900:25:30, Galactic Time.  He jotted the reading in, satisfied. The warm breath tickling the back of his neck was unnerving. If he showed fear and grabbed a blaster from the locker he could probably control them, but he was devastingly aware that a captain must never show fear.  \"Captain Barnhart,\" Simmons, the mate, drawled politely, \"do you still plan on making the jump at 900 thirty?\"  The captain removed his eyeglasses and polished the lenses.  \"Simmons,\" he said in comforting, confiding tones, \"you are well aware that regulations clearly state that a spaceship that phases in on a star in major trans-spot activity is required to re-phase within twenty-four hours to avoid being caught in turbulence.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Simmons said. \"But, as I have stated before, it is my belief that regulation means that a ship should phase to avoid the _possibility_ of being caught in an energy storm. We landed right in the middle of one. As you are aware, sir, if we phase now there is an excellent chance we will warp right into the sun!\"  Barnhart shook his lean, bronze head wearily. \"Simmons, the Admiralty has gone through this thousands of times. Obviously they know our danger is greater by staying where we are. Why, Ignatz 6Y out there may _nova_! We'll have to take our chances.\"  \"No, sir.\" Simmons thrust his pale, blue-veined jaw at him, his light eyes Nordicly cold below a blond cropping. \"The storm spots are dying down. We aren't phasing yet.\"  Barnhart drew himself up and looked down at the mate. Behind Simmons, York moved closer. The captain was suddenly aware of York's low forehead and muscular, free-swinging arms. It was probably sheer bias, but he had frequently entertained the idea that Englishmen were closer to our apelike ancestor than most people ... the way they ran around painted blue when everybody was civilly wearing clothes and all. Obviously York was incapable of thinking for himself and was willing to do anything Simmons commanded him to do.  It became transparent to Barnhart that they were going to mutiny to avoid following their duty as clearly outlined in regulations. Judging from York's twitching knuckles, they were going to resist by strangling him.  Barnhart wondered if this was the time to show fear and unlock a weapon to defend himself.  York clamped onto him before he could decide on the proper interpretation of the regulations and just as his mind settled on the irresolvable question: If a captain must never show fear, why was he given the key to a hand weapons locker to use when in fear of his life?         *       *       *       *       *  Barnhart gazed around the purple clearing with clouded eyes. He trembled in near traumatic shock. It was almost too much to bear.  Regulations clearly stated that no officer was to be _marooned_ on a .9 Earth-type planet at fourteen-forty Galactic Time, early evening local.  Or (he brushed at his forehead) he was damned certain they at least strongly _implied_ it.  But fear was such a foreign element to his daily routine he discarded it.  The scene took him back to his boyhood.  He sorted out the survival supplies, lifting even the portable nuclear generator effortlessly under the .67 gravity, and remembered how he used to go camping regularly every month when he was a Boy Scout. He had been a bookish child, too obsessed with reading, they told him. So he had put himself on a regular schedule for play. Still, it never seemed to make people like him much better. After he established his routine he didn't try to change it--he probably couldn't make things better and he certainly couldn't stand them any worse.  Barnhart paused in his labors and stripped off his soaked uniform shirt, deciding to break out his fatigues. As the wet sleeve turned wrong side out he noticed his wristwatch showed fifteen hundred hours.  As usual he fetched his toothbrush from the personals kit and started to scrub his teeth.  This was when he saw his first qurono in the act of geoplancting.  It was a deeply disturbing experience.         *       *       *       *       *  Barnhart and the lank, slick-bodied alien ignored each other every morning while the marooned captain had his coffee and the native chronoped; each afternoon while Barnhart laid down for a nap and the other xenogutted; and of course before retiring while Barnhart brushed his teeth and the alien did his regular stint of geoplancting.  The captain sat about arranging living quarters on the planet. The crew of the _Quincey_ had provided him with every necessity except communications gear. Still he was confident he would find a way back and see that Simmons and the rest got the punishment clearly called for in Regulation C-79, Clause II.  This driving need to have the regulation obeyed was as close as he could get to anger.  His lot was a rough and primitive one, but he sat down to doing the best with things that he could. Using the nuclear reactor, he synthesized a crude seven-room cottage. He employed an unorthodox three-story architecture. This gave him a kind of observation tower from which he could watch to see if the natives started to get restless. Traditionally, this would be a bad sign.  Humming to himself, he was idly adding some rococo work around the front door when thirteen-hundred-thirty came up and he stopped for his nap. At the edge of the now somewhat larger clearing the alien was xenogutting in the indigo shadows of a drooping bush-tree. Since he hadn't furnished the house yet, Barnhart stretched out on the grass. Suddenly he sat upright and shot a glance at the alien. Could this sort of thing be regarded as restless activity?  He was safe so long as the aliens maintained their regular routine but if they started to deviate from it he was in trouble.  He tossed around on the velvet blades for some minutes.  He got to his feet.  The nap would have to be by-passed. As much as he resented the intrusion on his regular routine he would have to find some other natives. He had to know if all the aliens on the planet xenogutted each afternoon as he was having his nap.  The thought crossed his mind that he might not wake up some afternoon if his presence was causing the aliens to deviate dangerously from their norm.         *       *       *       *       *  The most unnerving thing about the village was that there were exactly ten houses and precisely one hundred inhabitants. Each house was 33.3 feet on a side. The surfaces were hand-hewn planking or flat-sided logs. There were four openings: each opposing two were alternately one foot and an alarming ten feet high. Barnhart couldn't see the roof. The buildings appeared square, so he supposed the houses were 33.3 feet tall.  At the end of the single packed, violet-earthed street facing up the road was a large sign of some unidentifiable metal bearing the legend in standard Galactic:      THIS IS A VILLAGE OF QURONOS  Barnhart received the information unenthusiastically. He had never before encountered the term. The sign might as well have told him the place was a town of jabberwockies.  The single scarlet sun with its corona of spectrum frost was drawing low on the forest-covered horizon. Barnhart, dry of mouth and sore of foot, had not encountered yet a single one of the hundred inhabitants. He had missed his nap and his dinner, and now (he ran his tongue over his thick-feeling teeth) he was about to miss his nightly brushing of his teeth. He had taken only a minimum survival kit with him--which did not include a smaller personals kit.  His wristwatch, still on good, reliable ship's time, recorded nearly fifteen hundred hours straight up. His body chemistry was still operating on the Captain's Shift, whereby he spent part of the time with both the day and night shifts. It was nearly time for him to go to bed. Fortunately it was almost night on the planet.  He was searching out his portable force field projector from some loose coins and keys when the one hundred quronos came out of their houses and began geoplancting.      _Fifth Day Marooned_      _The Journal of     Captain T. P. Barnhart,     Late of the U.G.S. Quincey_      It becomes apparent that I may never leave alive this planet whose     name and co-ordinates have been kept from me. By reason, justice     and regulations, the men who put me here must pay (see formal     attached warrant against First Mate O. D. Simmons and the remainder     of my crew). For this reason and in the interest of science I am     beginning this journal, to which I hope to continue contributing     from time to time, barring sudden death.      At this writing I am in a village of ten houses identified as a     settlement of quronos. These tall, hairless humanoids have     performed an intricate series of indescribable actions since I     first encountered them. My problem, as is apparent, is to decide     whether these actions constitute their normal daily routine or     whether I have instigated this series of actions.      If the latter is the case: where will it all end?      _1700: Fifth day_  Barnhart was not used to being ignored.  It was certainly not a part of his normal routine. Often in his life he had been scorned and ridiculed. Later, when he earned a captaincy in the"]]]
