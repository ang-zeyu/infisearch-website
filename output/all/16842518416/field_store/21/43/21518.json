Come along, and you’ll be able to sympathize with all poor souls who have to play gooseberry often. But where are all the victims?”  “Oh, I was tired of them all and simply couldn’t be bothered with any of them today. Besides, I’ve been feeling a little blue—just a pale, elusive azure. It isn’t serious enough for anything darker. I wrote Alec and Alonzo last week. I put the letters into envelopes and addressed them, but I didn’t seal them up. That evening something funny happened. That is, Alec would think it funny, but Alonzo wouldn’t be likely to. I was in a hurry, so I snatched Alec’s letter—as I thought—out of the envelope and scribbled down a postscript. Then I mailed both letters. I got Alonzo’s reply this morning. Girls, I had put that postscript to his letter and he was furious. Of course he’ll get over it—and I don’t care if he doesn’t—but it spoiled my day. So I thought I’d come to you darlings to get cheered up. After the football season opens I won’t have any spare Saturday afternoons. I adore football. I’ve got the most gorgeous cap and sweater striped in Redmond colors to wear to the games. To be sure, a little way off I’ll look like a walking barber’s pole. Do you know that that Gilbert of yours has been elected Captain of the Freshman football team?”  “Yes, he told us so last evening,” said Priscilla, seeing that outraged Anne would not answer. “He and Charlie were down. We knew they were coming, so we painstakingly put out of sight or out of reach all Miss Ada’s cushions. That very elaborate one with the raised embroidery I dropped on the floor in the corner behind the chair it was on. I thought it would be safe there. But would you believe it? Charlie Sloane made for that chair, noticed the cushion behind it, solemnly fished it up, and sat on it the whole evening. Such a wreck of a cushion as it was! Poor Miss Ada asked me today, still smiling, but oh, so reproachfully, why I had allowed it to be sat upon. I told her I hadn’t—that it was a matter of predestination coupled with inveterate Sloanishness and I wasn’t a match for both combined.”  “Miss Ada’s cushions are really getting on my nerves,” said Anne. “She finished two new ones last week, stuffed and embroidered within an inch of their lives. There being absolutely no other cushionless place to put them she stood them up against the wall on the stair landing. They topple over half the time and if we come up or down the stairs in the dark we fall over them. Last Sunday, when Dr. Davis prayed for all those exposed to the perils of the sea, I added in thought ‘and for all those who live in houses where cushions are loved not wisely but too well!’ There! we’re ready, and I see the boys coming through Old St. John’s. Do you cast in your lot with us, Phil?”  “I’ll go, if I can walk with Priscilla and Charlie. That will be a bearable degree of gooseberry. That Gilbert of yours is a darling, Anne, but why does he go around so much with Goggle-eyes?”  Anne stiffened. She had no great liking for Charlie Sloane; but he was of Avonlea, so no outsider had any business to laugh at him.  “Charlie and Gilbert have always been friends,” she said coldly. “Charlie is a nice boy. He’s not to blame for his eyes.”  “Don’t tell me that! He is! He must have done something dreadful in a previous existence to be punished with such eyes. Pris and I are going to have such sport with him this afternoon. We’ll make fun of him to his face and he’ll never know it.”  Doubtless, “the abandoned P’s,” as Anne called them, did carry out their amiable intentions. But Sloane was blissfully ignorant; he thought he was quite a fine fellow to be walking with two such coeds, especially Philippa Gordon, the class beauty and belle. It must surely impress Anne. She would see that some people appreciated him at his real value.  Gilbert and Anne loitered a little behind the others, enjoying the calm, still beauty of the autumn afternoon under the pines of the park, on the road that climbed and twisted round the harbor shore.  “The silence here is like a prayer, isn’t it?” said Anne, her face upturned to the shining sky. “How I love the pines! They seem to strike their roots deep into the romance of all the ages. It is so comforting to creep away now and then for a good talk with them. I always feel so happy out here.”  “‘And so in mountain solitudes o’ertaken     As by some spell divine, Their cares drop from them like the needles shaken     From out the gusty pine,’”   quoted Gilbert.  “They make our little ambitions seem rather petty, don’t they, Anne?”  “I think, if ever any great sorrow came to me, I would come to the pines for comfort,” said Anne dreamily.  “I hope no great sorrow ever will come to you, Anne,” said Gilbert, who could not connect the idea of sorrow with the vivid, joyous creature beside him, unwitting that those who can soar to the highest heights can also plunge to the deepest depths, and that the natures which enjoy most keenly are those which also suffer most sharply.  “But there must—sometime,” mused Anne. “Life seems like a cup of glory held to my lips just now. But there must be some bitterness in it—there is in every cup. I shall taste mine some day. Well, I hope I shall be strong and brave to meet it. And I hope it won’t be through my own fault that it will come. Do you remember what Dr. Davis said last Sunday evening—that the sorrows God sent us brought comfort and strength with them, while the sorrows we brought on ourselves, through folly or wickedness, were by far the hardest to bear? But we mustn’t talk of sorrow on an afternoon like this. It’s meant for the sheer joy of living, isn’t it?”  “If I had my way I’d shut everything out of your life but happiness and pleasure, Anne,” said Gilbert in the tone that meant “danger ahead.”  “Then you would be very unwise,” rejoined Anne hastily. “I’m sure no life can be properly developed and rounded out without some trial and sorrow—though I suppose it is only when we are pretty comfortable that we admit it. Come—the others have got to the pavilion and are beckoning to us.”  They all sat down in the little pavilion to watch an autumn sunset of deep red fire and pallid gold. To their left lay Kingsport, its roofs and spires dim in their shroud of violet smoke. To their right lay the harbor, taking on tints of rose and copper as it stretched out into the sunset. Before them the water shimmered, satin smooth and silver gray, and beyond, clean shaven William’s Island loomed out of the mist, guarding the town like a sturdy bulldog. Its lighthouse beacon flared through the mist like a baleful star, and was answered by another in the far horizon.  “Did you ever see such a strong-looking place?” asked Philippa. “I don’t want William’s Island especially, but I’m sure I couldn’t get it if I did. Look at that sentry on the summit of the fort, right beside the flag. Doesn’t he look as if he had stepped out of a romance?”  “Speaking of romance,” said Priscilla, “we’ve been looking for heather—but, of course, we couldn’t find any. It’s too late in the season, I suppose.”  “Heather!” exclaimed Anne. “Heather doesn’t grow in America, does it?”  “There are just two patches of it in the whole continent,” said Phil, “one right here in the park, and one somewhere else in Nova Scotia, I forget where. The famous Highland Regiment, the Black Watch, camped here one year, and, when the men shook out the straw of their beds in the spring, some seeds of heather took root.”  “Oh, how delightful!” said enchanted Anne.  “Let’s go home around by Spofford Avenue,” suggested Gilbert. “We can see all ‘the handsome houses where the wealthy nobles dwell.’ Spofford Avenue is the finest residential street in Kingsport. Nobody can build on it unless he’s a millionaire.”  “Oh, do,” said Phil. “There’s a perfectly killing little place I want to show you, Anne. _it_ wasn’t built by a millionaire. It’s the first place after you leave the park, and must have grown while Spofford Avenue was still a country road. It _did_ grow—it wasn’t built! I don’t care for the houses on the Avenue. They’re too brand new and plateglassy. But this little spot is a dream—and its name—but wait till you see it.”  They saw it as they walked up the pine-fringed hill from the park. Just on the crest, where Spofford Avenue petered out into a plain road, was a little white frame house with groups of pines on either side of it, stretching their arms protectingly over its low roof. It was covered with red and gold vines, through which its green-shuttered windows peeped. Before it was a tiny garden, surrounded by a low stone wall. October though it was, the garden was still very sweet with dear, old-fashioned, unworldly flowers and shrubs—sweet may, southern-wood, lemon verbena, alyssum, petunias, marigolds and chrysanthemums. A tiny brick wall, in herring-bone pattern, led from the gate to the front porch. The whole place might have been transplanted from some remote country village; yet there was something about it that made its nearest neighbor, the big lawn-encircled palace of a tobacco king, look exceedingly crude and showy and ill-bred by contrast. As Phil said, it was the difference between being born and being made.  “It’s the dearest place I ever saw,” said Anne delightedly. “It gives me one of my old, delightful funny aches. It’s dearer and quainter than even Miss Lavendar’s stone house.”  “It’s the name I want you to notice especially,” said Phil. “Look—in white letters, around the archway over the gate. ‘Patty’s Place.’ Isn’t that killing? Especially on this Avenue of Pinehursts and Elmwolds and Cedarcrofts? ‘Patty’s Place,’ if you please! I adore it.”  “Have you any idea who Patty is?” asked Priscilla.  “Patty Spofford is the name of the old lady who owns it, I’ve discovered. She lives there with her niece, and they’ve lived there for hundreds of years, more or less—maybe a little less, Anne.

ROBINSON                    Illustrated by ELIZABETH MacINTYRE             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                  Galaxy Science Fiction February 1951.

You'd never imagine              space travel starting this way, for instance!   I suppose there's a guy like McCleary in every office.  Now I'm not a hard man to get along with and it usually takes quite a bit more than overly bright remarks from the office boy to bother me. But try as I might, I could never get along with McCleary. To be as disliked as he was, you have to work at it.  What kind of guy was he? Well, if you came down to the office one day proud as Punch because of something little Johnny or Josephine had said, it was a sure cinch that McCleary would horn in with something his little Louie had spouted off that morning. At any rate, when McCleary got through, you felt like taking Johnny to the doctor to find out what made him subnormal.  Or maybe you happened to buy a new Super-eight that week and were bragging about the mileage, the terrific pickup, and how quickly she responded to the wheel. Leave it to McCleary to give a quick run-down on his own car that would make you feel like selling yours for junk at the nearest scrap heap.  Well, you see what I mean.  But by far the worst of it was when vacation time rolled around. You could forgive a guy for topping you about how brainy his kids are, and you might even find it in your heart to forget the terrific bargain he drove to work in. But vacation time was when he'd really get on your nerves. _You_ could pack the wife and kids in Old Reliable and roll out to the lake for your two weeks in August. You might even break the bank and spend the two weeks at a poor man's Sun Valley. But no matter where you went, when you came back, you'd have to sit in silence and listen to McCleary's account of his Vacation in the Adirondacks, or his Tramp in the Canadian Wilds, or maybe even the Old French Quarter.  The trouble was he always had the photographs, the ticket stubs, and the souvenirs to prove it. Where he got the money, I'll never know. Sometimes I'd tell the wife about it and she'd sniff and wonder what kind of shabby house they lived in that they could afford all the other things. I never looked him up myself. Tell you the truth, I was afraid I'd find the McClearys lived on Park Avenue.         *       *       *       *       *  Now you look forward to a vacation all year, but particularly during the latter part of July, when, what with the heat and the stuffy office, you begin to feel like a half-done hotdog at a barbecue. I was feeling even worse than usual as I was faced with spending my two weeks in my own backyard, most of my vacation dough having gone to pay the doctor. The only thing I minded was having McCleary find out about it and seeing that phony look of sympathy roll across his fat face while he rambled on about the vacation _he_ was going to have.  It was lunch time and we had just finished talking about the latest on television and what was wrong with the Administration and who'd win the pennant when Bob Young brought up the subject of vacations. It turned out he was due for a trip to the Ozarks and Donley was going after wall-eye pike in northern Wisconsin. I could sense McCleary prick up his ears clear across the room.  \"How about you, Bill?\" Donley asked me. \"Got any plans?\"  I winked heavily and jerked a thumb warningly toward McCleary, making sure McCleary couldn't see the gesture.  \"My vacation is really going to be out of the world this time,\" I said. \"Me and the wife are going to Mars. Dry, you know. Even better than Arizona for her sinus.\"  Even with the wink they were caught off guard for a minute.  \"Mars?\" Donley said feebly, edging his chair away. \"Yeah, sure. Great place. Never been there myself, though.\"  Young just gaped, then grinned as he caught on. \"I understand it's a wonderful spot,\" he chipped in.  I casually peeled a hard-boiled egg the wife had packed in my lunch bucket and leaned back in my swivel chair. \"It's really swell,\" I said dreamily, but loud enough so McCleary couldn't help but overhear. \"Drifting down the Grand Canal at evening, the sun a faint golden disk behind the crystal towers of Marsport....\" I let my voice drift into a long sigh and reached for Donley's sack of grapes.  About this time McCleary had gnawed his way through a big pastrami sandwich and waddled over. He stood there expectantly, but we carefully ignored him.  \"Always wanted to go myself,\" Donley said in the same tone of voice he would have used to say he'd like to go to California someday. \"Pretty expensive, though, isn't it?\"  \"Expensive?\" I raised a studiedly surprised eyebrow. \"Oh, I suppose a little, but it's worth it. The wife and I got a roomette on the _Princess of Mars_ for $139.50. That's one way, of course.\"  \"Mars!\" Young sighed wistfully.  There was a moment of silence, with all three of us paying silent tribute to the ultimate in vacations. McCleary slowly masticated a leaf of lettuce, his initial look of suspicion giving way to half-belief.  \"Let's hear some more about it,\" Young said enthusiastically, suddenly recovering from his reverie.  \"Oh, there isn't much more,\" I said indifferently. \"We plan to stay at the Redsands hotel in Marsport--American plan. Take in Marsport, with maybe a side trip to Crystallite. If we have time we might even take a waterway cruise to the North Pole....\"         *       *       *       *       *  I broke off and dug Donley in the ribs.  \"Man, you never fished until you have a Martian flying fish at the end of the line!\" I grabbed a ruler off the desk and began using it as an imaginary rod and reel. \"Talk about fight ... oh, sorry, Mac.\" My ruler had amputated part of a floppy lettuce leaf that hung from McCleary's sandwich.  I settled down in my chair again and started paying attention to my lunch. \"Nothing like it,\" I added between mouthfuls of liverwurst.  \"How about entertainment?\" Young winked slyly.  \"Well, you know--the wife will be along,\" I said. \"But some of the places near the Grand Canal--and those Martian Mist Maidens! Brother, if I was unattached....\"  \"There ain't any life on Mars,\" McCleary said, suspicious again.  All three of us looked at him in shocked silence.  \"He says there's no life on Mars!\" Donley repeated.  \"You ever been there, McCleary?\" I asked sarcastically.  \"No, but just the same....\"  \"All right,\" I cut in, \"then you don't know whether there is or isn't. So kindly reserve your opinion until you know a little about the subject under discussion.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I turned back to Donley and Young.  \"Really a wonderful place for your health. Dry, thin air, nice and cool at night. And beautiful! From Marsport you can see low-slung mountains in the distance, dunes of soft, red sand stretching out to them. If I were you, Bob, I'd forget all about the Ozarks and sign up on the rocket.\"  \"There ain't any rockets going to Mars,\" McCleary said obstinately.  \"Isn't,\" I corrected. \"I mean, there is. Besides, McCleary, just because you never heard of something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\"  \"The government's still working on V-2,\" McCleary said flatly. \"They haven't even reached the moon yet.\"  I sighed softly, acting disgusted at having to deal with somebody as stupid as McCleary. \"Mac, that's the government and besides they're dealing with military rockets. And did you ever hear of the government perfecting something before private industry? Who perfected the telephone, the radio, television? The government? No, private industry, of course! Private industry has always been ahead of the government on everything, including rockets. Get on the stick, Mac.\"  McCleary started in on his lettuce leaf again, looking very shrewd.  \"How come I never heard of it before now?\" he asked, springing the clincher argument.  \"Look, Mac, this is relatively new. The company's just starting, can't afford to take full-page ads and that sort of thing. Just give 'em time, that's all. Why, a couple of years from now you'll be spending your vacation on Venus or Jupiter or some place like that. From now on California and the Bahamas will be strictly old hat.\"  McCleary looked half-believing.  \"Where'd you get your tickets?\"  I waved vaguely in the direction of downtown. \"Oh, there must be at least a couple of agencies downtown. Might even be able to find them in the phone book. Look under _Interplanetary Rocket Lines_ or something like that. You might have a little difficulty, of course. Like I say, they're not too well advertised.\"  McCleary was about to say something more, but then the one o'clock bell rang and we went back to the office grind.         *       *       *       *       *  Well, McCleary didn't say anything more about it the next day, even though we'd throw in a chance comment about Mars every now and then, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, but Mac didn't rise to the bait. We gradually forgot about it.  The next couple of weeks came and went and then my two weeks in August. Like I said before, my vacation dough had gone to pay the doctor, so I stayed at home and watered the begonias.  The Monday morning after vacation, we were all back in the office, if anything looking more fagged than we had when we left. When lunch time rolled around, Donley and Young and I piled our lunches on Donley's desk--his desk was near a window on the north side of the building so we could get the breeze--and talked about what we had done during vacation.  McCleary ambled up and like it usually does after McCleary comes around, the conversation just naturally died down. After a two minute silence I"]]]
