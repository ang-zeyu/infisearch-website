He ate and afterward walked to the rocketport. It was a long distance and formerly he might have complained, but now he didn't mind it. The miles seemed to have shrunk to furlongs.  He found the big _Interplanet_ sign and examined the place minutely from the outside. Once he had worked there, technically he still did. Some memories came back, but not many. He needed at least an hour inside to enable him to forget the hospital and its psychotherapy.  Once cleared, he would be free for a while to concentrate on what to do about Erica.  The hospital evidently had yet to call in the police. He was still safe on the streets, but the medicos must have notified _Interplanet_ and all other places at which he might show up. However, the company was too big for everyone to know about him this soon. More likely there would be only a few who could have information on him as yet. The trick was to bypass those individuals who might try to detain him and still get where he wanted.  Normally, he'd go to the front office after an accident. This time, he went to the side gate and when the guard looked at him questioningly, mumbled, \"Reporting for duty.\" Which got him through.  Inside, there were more memories awaiting him. Depending on them, he walked rapidly through hall after hall and finally found the desk he sought. The man behind it looked up. \"Are you sure you're in the right place?\" he asked.  Merrol would soon know. \"Reporting for duty,\" he stated.  This reply elicited a puzzled expression. \"The devil you are. We haven't hired anyone new.\"  \"I'm not new. I've been injured, and this is my first time back. Dan Merrol's my name.\"  \"Okay, where's your slip?\"  \"Slip?\" he asked, stalling. This was something he ought to know about, but didn't.  \"Sure, the release from the front office after an injury.\"  \"They said they'd send it down,\" he replied, holding his breath.         *       *       *       *       *  The clerk pawed through the stack. \"They don't send nothing down,\" he growled. \"I'll call and find out.\" His hand reached out and then he relaxed. \"No use bothering them, it'll get here tomorrow.\" He looked up and laughed. \"Red tape,\" he said by way of explanation. \"Why should I doubt you? If you said they released you, then they did.\"  Merrol was glad to see one man who wasn't impressed by office routines. Still, his behavior was a little puzzling.  The man screened on. The communication unit was behind the desk, tilted so he couldn't see it. The volume was low, but Dan could hear the conversation from this end. \"Got a case for you. Name is Dan Merrol. I don't know, he's before my time.\"  The reply was faint and Dan didn't catch it. But the clerk added, \"He seems okay. What? Sure he's got a release. Would I send him in?\"  He cut the connection and looked up. \"Go over to Psych. They'll test you. If you pass, we'll put you back on schedule.\" He started to turn away and saw Merrol standing there. \"What's the matter?\"  \"I don't know where Psych is.\"  \"I see. We must have moved things since you were here.\" The man got up and pointed. \"Down there and turn left at the second corner. You can't miss.\"  The examiner was scanning a card as he entered. \"Lots of experience,\" he commented. \"We'll pass over the written stuff. That's for kids, to make sure they've studied their lessons. After you've been out this long, you can almost feel a course faster than anyone can figure it.\"  It was a relief. Merrol didn't know how much theory he remembered, but was sure he could still lift a ship as well as the next man.  The examiner made a notation on the card and tossed it into a machine that snapped it up and clicked furiously over it. \"Let's take the biggest thing first, if you're up to it.\"  \"I feel fine.\" It was not true, but it was the customary answer. Anything else, and he'd be shunted off into a series of meaningless tests, each designed to verify the results of previous tests. An ingenious scheme rigged up by the psych crew in their spare time to see how complicated they could make any given system. Answered straightforwardly, they rushed a man through with a minimum of officiousness.  \"Okay, let's take the trip.\"  He accompanied Dan into a room unlike the others. For one thing, it might have been the control room of a ship. Forward, there was the usual clear view. The stars were there too, in an adaptation of the planetarium. Outside, arranged to give any effect from top acceleration to free fall, were a number of gravity coils. Except for the pilot--and Merrol would play that role--there was a full complement of officers who were invisible.         *       *       *       *       *  The tester flicked on a machine. \"I'll give you Mars, because that's your usual run. This is a short drive, because you're in a favorable position. Got it?\"  Merrol nodded and climbed into the seat, facing the instruments.  \"I've turned on the best crew simulators, better than you'd ever actually get. Don't worry about them, just take the data and flit the way you think you should.\" The tester clamped a mike inches away and adjusted the visio-recorders firmly on his head, where electron beams could sneak in and tap his optic centers. \"The first trip after you've been away is rough, but you'll make it.\"  Merrol strapped himself in and hoped the other man was right.  The examiner went to the door, turned and grinned. \"Watch out for the interplanetary goose,\" he called and snapped the switch.  Merrol was now in a ship. In the back of his mind there was some doubt of his ability, but it didn't reach as far as his fingers. Rockets vibrated beneath him. Outside, he could see the glazed earth-slick. He touched the power and climbed above the clouds. The sky turned black and there were stars.  He checked position. The tester had given him a setup. The Moon was out of the way and the run to Mars was the shortest on record. If he couldn't handle this, he wasn't a pilot.  The seat jabbed him suddenly. That's what he'd been warned about--he'd been expecting it and still wasn't prepared. The tempathy drugs flooded into him and the needle was withdrawn.  Takeoff and landing were always rehearsed on the pilot's own time. The ends of a voyage were critical and it was essential to have an undistorted reaction. Besides, neither took long.  The time between one planet and the next was long and nothing much happened, so it could be shortened without deleterious effect on the results. Tempathy drugs shortened it, though not completely. Part of a man's consciousness went along at normal speed and the rest, that which counted in jockeying rockets, was enormously telescoped.  It telescoped on Merrol. He couldn't see. Rather, part of him could but, for the other fraction, images passed in front of his eyes too fast for his mind to evaluate. Weeks flipped past in minutes. It was a dream world turned inside out--the roles of consciousness and unconsciousness were reversed.  There was something wrong with the sounds he half-heard. He could get emotions, though he couldn't separate them into sense. There were additional voices that shouldn't be there--the mechanical crew spoke to him giving silent data--but there were other actual voices, fearful or consolatory. He tried to speak, but his vocal cords were preempted.  He was doing it all, speaking, moving the controls, directing the ship between planets. It ought to be easier than takeoff, but it wasn't. He shouldn't be afraid of anything he might find out there--which was nothing--but that didn't alter conditions. He was profoundly disturbed, and he hoped the tester noticed it.  The examiner did spot trouble. He opened the door and reversed the switch. Lights went on, and another needle speared him, counteracting the effects of the tempathy drugs. Slowly the ship disappeared, space along with it, and the room whirled back into view and settled down. Something handed him back his eyes and ears.  \"Easy,\" said the man. \"Sit there. You don't have to move. We'll find out what's wrong. It may not be serious at all.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Unhooking the visio-recorder, the tester also swung the mike away. \"You were doing fine,\" he said. \"Never saw anything smoother. About here, though, you seemed to be having difficulty. We'll slow it down and see what it was.\"  He snapped the reels in place and darkened the room. On the screen was the vision-port and, through it, a view of Mars. A fleck of light glittered, grew, became a cloud, a swarm. A swarm?  \"God!\" said the tester, bewildered. \"A billion butterflies! How could you imagine butterflies, twenty million miles from a planet?\"  Merrol squirmed--he didn't know either. What was wrong with him to make him dream up butterflies?  The examiner switched the film off and the lights on. \"So you missed them--why, I don't know.\" He fiddled with another machine. \"We'll slow down the sound, synchronize the two of them later, but maybe by itself the sound will give us a clue as to what happened.\"  \"What's that?\" It came from the sound track, but it was Merrol's voice.  \"Those are lepidoptera.\" Another voice, also his, though of different pitch and timbre--his, because he was the only one there to speak. \"I've always dreamed of discovering a new species and at last I have, since these can fly through space. What strange adaptations they have made. Aren't they beautiful?\"  He answered. \"They won't be when I plow through them. The rockets will fry them.\"  \"Turn aside!\" shouted the lepidopterist. \"You can't destroy them.\"  \"I'm going to act as if this were not happening,\" said a cultured voice. \"_Bang-bang!_\"  \"This is upsetting,\" said a different person. \"Since I have no instrument, I'll listen with my memory to a Bach concerto. Unfortunately, it ends in the middle of the third movement, as though it has been sliced through with a knife that separated one note cleanly from the next. Still, it's better to have "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51295"],["title","The Man Who Was Six (#5)"],["body","than nothing.\"  \"Your computers are awfully slow,\" said the fifth. \"I'll figure out a new course for us.\"  \"Gimme the controls,\" said the wrestler. \"I'll turn the ship, if I hafta do it with my bare hands.\"  The examiner snapped off the sound and busied himself with things that may have been necessary. \"You don't have to sit there,\" he said after a while. \"Wait outside.\" He glanced down, \"Be careful when you move, the control column will fall off. Didn't know it could be broken.\"  As he got out of the seat, the examiner slapped his back. \"Tell you what, fellow--don't wait--go now to the Compensation Board and see about retirement.\"   IV  Merrol sat in the room where he had been sitting for a day and a half since the psych test. He had walked out immediately, found a room and was still in it. It wasn't comfortable, sitting. Whichever position was right for the bend of one knee was wrong for the other.  He had depended on the test to get him out of a jam, but the stratagem had failed. If he had passed, he'd have been another experienced pilot for the _Interplanet_ string and that meant something. Experienced men were valuable and I. P. would have gone to bat for him.  Not everyone could pass the test and, while it didn't prove that the man who did was one hundred per cent sane, it was a big argument in that direction. It was evidence that would have to be respected publicly, whatever private doubts a psychotherapist might have.  Unwittingly, he had provided additional ammunition against himself. When the results of the test sifted through the layers of red tape to the front office, _Interplanet_ would contact the hospital, which would then really want to orient him to a frazzle.  Orientation sounded nice but it was not for Merrol. If they could orient everyone he would come in contact with as well--but how much insulation could a man build up against involuntary laughter? It was fine to be a comedian on the screen and then step out of character and relax--but what if you couldn't stop? Nobody could adjust to the constant expectation of hysterical mirth. But wasn't that a reason to undergo psychotherapy, so they could blunt the edges of his own reactions? It ought to be, but somehow it wasn't. He didn't dare submit.  There was a difference, apparently determined by sex, in the way people behaved toward him. No man had thus far done more than smile respectfully while he was near. What they did later, he could guess. Face to face, they seemed to be reserved and incredulous until they learned to accept him as a member of their species and sex and then--how _did_ they act? It would take more than casual thinking to puzzle _that_ out.  Women saw the big joke instantly and giggled, and he couldn't blame them. Seconds later, they smirked contritely and tried to touch him, as if contact could atone for their behavior. _They_ noticed appearance at all times, whereas men didn't as a rule of their own sex.  He paused to re-examine his thoughts. Something seemed to be missing in his analysis. What it was, he couldn't tell. It would have to come out later, as he mingled more with people--if he ever did.         *       *       *       *       *  And that wasn't all. He had been a pilot, but never would be one again. His skill had been destroyed by the intrusion of five other personalities, who each brought his own odd bit of useless knowledge to the whole Merrol. He should have expected it, but he hadn't, nor had the doctors.  It was obvious--the brain slices that had replaced his own damaged tissues had to be in healthy condition or they'd never have functioned properly--and what did those medical fools think was the function of any brain? He was in command of the group brain because his was the dominant fraction, but when he sat down and thought about it, what good did it do? He was sitting down and it didn't do any good, so he got up.  He took two paces across the room and looked out the window, into windows that looked into his. Compensation was coming to him. Ultimately, he'd divide it with Erica and go away. She must know by now that the man she had spent the night with was actually her own husband. Intellectually she must have decided to accept him.  He wasn't noble, though. Much as he wanted her, he knew he couldn't live with anyone who had to stifle her laughter when he stepped out of the bath or into bed.  He walked the carpet aimlessly until, through the window, he caught a word from the telecast in the next apartment. He thought it sounded familiar. He yanked the louvers closed and grunted, but it didn't help--the word bothered him. He reached out the long arm to turn on his own screen.  A face came into view and a man's voice whispered. Merrol turned up the volume, but it didn't get any louder. It was the low-pressure soothing type. Whatever he was selling, it was a welcome change.  The announcer smiled reassuringly. \"Actually, I'm talking to one person. The rest of you may listen or not for the next five minutes, after which I'll have something to say to you.\" It was a clever approach to insure that the audience didn't switch programs.  \"Dan Merrol, this is a personal message to you.\" Merrol sat up.  \"We'd call you if we could, but this is a large city and you've simply vanished. We have operatives trying to trace you, but with no success up to now.\" The announcer leaned forward confidentially.  \"Now, Dan, before you become alarmed, let me say you've done nothing wrong. In fact, at _Interplanet_, we think you've done everything right--but I'll come to that later.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Interplanet? Then it wasn't the hospital or the police. What could I. P. want of him?  \"No doubt the test you took was somewhat of a shock. Don't blame the psych examiner for the conclusions he formed--he can't be expected to know more than the leading psychologists. You're probably curious as to what this test has to do with you and _Interplanet_. We hope so--we want you to keep on listening.  \"The test proved you're no longer a competent pilot--but it also indicated something much bigger. Dan, _you_ are the answer to a problem that has been bothering us for generations. Before the accident, you knew nothing of music or any life science, your math was adequate but not deep, you often felt awkward in the presence of others when you had no need to and you lacked confidence in your physical ability.  \"Suddenly, you gained something of each and, when we contacted your doctors, we were able to surmise how it happened. Now you ask--what good does this do you and what is the problem to which this is the answer?  \"Simply this--_specialization_. You know what constitutes a rocket crew--pilot, radio man, engineer and several lesser technicians, each of whom knows only his own job. Although you'll never sit at the controls again--through you, we can help others.\"  The announcer lowered his voice now. \"You can unlock specialization for us. In the future, each man will concentrate on what particular aptitudes he has, then share it, via surgery, with others whose knowledge complements his own. To do this, we need to study you further and, of course, we'll pay you well for the opportunity. In addition, you'll still get your compensation. Please come and talk it over with us.  \"Frankly, we're a little worried about what you may be thinking. If you have any thoughts of self-destruction because of what must seem a strange condition, put them aside. You're much saner than the average man.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Merrol listened, smiling at the remark. No matter what they thought, he couldn't seriously contemplate suicide. There were too many others to dissuade him.  Nevertheless, it was hard to understand and accept the sudden change of his status. He had formerly been a mere employee, but now....  The announcer hadn't finished. \"In the beginning, Dan, I said you had done everything right, whether you knew it or not. After we learned what we did from your test, we checked through our files and found that we had a few other accident cases on record in which part of the brain had been replaced. In each case there was a faint trace of another personality, which we could detect when we knew what to look for. We rechecked each person we could locate. Unfortunately, the latent personalities and their share of knowledge had been submerged beyond recovery by the rigorous psychotherapy the accident victim had undergone after surgery.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The imaginary Wysocki's theorem of self-therapy. He never knew of anyone by that name, nor had he got it from one of the other five. But, however nonsensically he had invented it to express the needs he felt at the time, it was, in fact, not nonsense. When it came to that, who knew anything about six minds packaged together--and what could have been done to him in ignorance?  The announcer was finished talking to Dan Merrol alone. \"Remember, all of you,\" he said briskly. \"This man is neither a criminal nor insane. He is extremely withdrawn, as a result of unpleasant experiences. If you can induce him to come to _Interplanet_, or lead our representatives to him, you will receive a substantial reward. Here is his picture.\"  Merrol turned off the screen and scowled. He didn't like that last. He intended to take their offer, but he wanted to be free to walk the streets. He could settle that easily enough by just calling _Interplanet_. They'd send someone down to whisk him away. That would solve all his problems--or would it?  Certainly, it eliminated orientation or any form of psychotherapy. After what had happened to the others, the psychologists would be content merely to observe what went on in his mind. They wouldn't want to give him much privacy, but he'd have to insist on it. They'd listen.  This could be just a job, a very good job while it lasted--say three or four years--until they had learned all they need to know. Perhaps there"]]]
