But halfway there, both came to a halt, breathless and staring.  A powerful bearded man strode into the classroom.  Paul and Miss Terry fell back as he advanced. He was a man of about fifty, his bushy hair shot with gray, his eyes cold and blue. He was followed by two younger men who studied Paul and Miss Terry with interest. All three wore rough work clothing.  The bearded man pointed at Paul. \"There's the boy,\" he said quietly. \"Take him.\"  Paul let out a shriek of terror and fled into a corner as the two men advanced. He clawed futilely as they laid hands on him. \"For God's sake, shut up,\" one of the men said with more disgust than anger. He pinioned Paul's arms while the other man bound them together with a strip of cloth.  Miss Terry meanwhile had collapsed into her chair. One of Paul's captors glanced at her and spoke to the bearded man. \"What about her?\"  The bearded man stepped close to Miss Terry and put a hand on her shoulder. She recoiled as from a snake. \"How old are you?\" he asked. Miss Terry made some inarticulate squeaks and the man spoke more sharply. \"When were you born?\"  \"Two thousand four,\" she managed to stutter.  The bearded man considered this and shook his head. \"Over fifty. By that time they're hopeless. Leave her and bring the boy.\"  Miss Terry let out an agonized wail of protest and fainted across her desk. One of the men slung Paul over his shoulder and the bearded leader led the group from the room.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Amazing,\" murmured Staghorn. \"Absolutely amazing. One never knows what to expect.\"  \"Pure gibberish,\" said Peccary, then betrayed his interest by saying, \"Can you follow them?\"  \"I'm trying to.\" Staghorn worked at the geographic adjustment and finally got the screen focused on the corridor again. It was deserted. The bearded man and his companions had already departed. Staghorn touched the controls again, the screen flickered and once more the little park came into focus. But now it, too, was deserted. None of the ragged men and women were in sight, neither in the park nor on the street beyond. Staghorn twisted the focus in all directions without discovering anyone.  \"That whistle we heard was obviously some kind of alarm,\" he said. \"Everyone must be in hiding--from the Atavars, whoever they are. I strongly suspect that bearded fellow of being one.\"  \"You might as well shut it off, Staghorn,\" Dr. Peccary said coldly. \"It's too much nonsense for any sane man to swallow. And unless that machine can provide a full and satisfactory explanation as to why my Y Hormone will bring about the conditions depicted on that screen, I see no reason to keep the hormone off the market.\"  Staghorn turned from the controls to study his companion. \"The only possible way that Humanac could give us the entire background of events leading up to what we've just seen would be to set the time control to the present and then leave the machine running until it arrived at this same period again. That would take a hundred years, and I'm not going to sit here that long. What's more, I'm not going to touch your Y Hormone even if you do put it on the market.\"  \"There'll be plenty who will!\"  \"That's what Humanac says, yes.\"  Dr. Peccary gestured despairingly. After all, he did have a conscience. \"I simply don't believe my hormone can be responsible!\"  \"I'll remind you that your picture was on the classroom wall and that the sixth rule read by that boy indicated that he was supposed to start using your hormone when he reached the age of twenty-one. That would be about the age to stop growing older.\"  \"That boy is nothing but a mathematical probability!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"That's all you and I are,\" Staghorn said owlishly. \"Mathematical probabilities. Despite Omar, nothing exactly like either of us has ever existed before or will exist again.\"  \"But damn it, Staghorn....\" Dr. Peccary sat down, his face in his hands. \"It's worth millions! I've invested years of work and all the money I could scrape together. I don't see anything wrong in a scientist's profiting by his discoveries. And to keep it off the market just because that insane computer says that a hundred years from now--\" He broke off, glaring at Humanac's screen which was still focused on the deserted park. \"It simply doesn't make sense! The machine doesn't give any reasons for anything. If there were a way I could talk directly to some of those mathematical probabilities, question them, ask them what it's all about....\" He was on his feet, striding back and forth before the computer again.  \"Perhaps there is a way,\" Staghorn said quietly.  \"Eh?\"  \"I said that it may be possible for you to talk with them.\"  \"How?\"  \"By making your mind a temporary part of the computer.\"  Peccary studied the huge machine apprehensively--its ranks of memory units, its chambers of flickering tubes, the labyrinth of circuits. \"How would you go about it?\"  \"I put you in the transmitter,\" Staghorn said. He stepped away from the console and slid back a panel to reveal a niche with a seat in it. Above the seat was a sort of helmet that resembled a hair drier in a beauty parlor, except that it was studded with hundreds of tiny magnets and transistors. Staghorn indicated the helmet. \"This picks up and amplifies brain waves. I've used it to record the cephalic wave pattern of about a hundred men and women. The recordings are built into the computer, enabling Humanac to assign a mathematical evaluation to the influence of human emotion in making historic decisions. In your case, instead of making a recording of your brain waves, I'd feed the impulses directly into Humanac's memory units.\"  \"And what would happen then?\"  \"I'm not altogether sure,\" said Staghorn, and it seemed to Peccary that Staghorn was finding a definite relish in his uncertainty. \"I've never tried the experiment before.\"  \"I might get electrocuted?\"  \"No. There's no danger of that happening. The current that activates the transmitter comes from your own brain, and as you know, such electrical impulses are extremely feeble. That isn't what worries me.\"  \"Well then, what does?\"  \"In some ways Humanac behaves peculiarly like a living organism. For example, there's one prediction it can never make. Several times I've fed into it the hypothetical information that the two opposing factions of the world have declared war. Naturally everyone would like to know about the outcome of such a war.\" Staghorn paused, gazing lovingly at his majestic creation.  \"And what happens?\" Dr. Peccary said impatiently.  \"Nothing. That's just it. The moment I turn Humanac into the future to get a prediction, the screen goes dead. Do you know why it goes dead?\" Staghorn looked at Peccary with a pleased smile and didn't wait for Peccary to cue him. \"It goes dead because, if war were declared, Humanac would be the first target for enemy bombs. When it predicts a future event, it has to take all factors into consideration. If one of those factors is its own destruction, it can predict nothing beyond that moment.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Peccary repeated this sentence in his mind while he slowly digested its meaning. What it seemed to mean was that, although Staghorn and Peccary thought of Humanac as only a complicated machine, Humanac's opinion of itself was altogether otherwise. It could foresee its own death.  \"I often wonder,\" mused Staghorn, \"about those people we see wandering around on Humanac's screen. To us they're only images made by a stream of electrons hitting the end of a cathode ray tube. Their space and time is an illusion. All the same, Humanac comprises an entire system--a system modeled as accurately as possible on our own. It's just possible that the boy we saw, Paul, was experiencing a real terror.\"  Dr. Peccary examined Staghorn in amazement. He had often suspected that Staghorn's genius was tinged with madness. \"You're not suggesting that those ... those images are conscious?\"  \"Ah! What is consciousness?\"  \"I didn't come here to get into a metaphysical argument.\"  \"No, but it's only fair for me to suggest the possible emotional hazzards involved in hooking you up to Humanac. Because you have to admit that _you'll_ be conscious during the experiment.\"  \"Certainly. But I'll be sitting right there.\" Peccary pointed to the seat in the transmitter unit.  \"In a sense, yes. Very well, take your seat.\"  Peccary eyed the helmet uneasily. \"I'm not sure I want to do this.\"  \"But you do want to make millions from the Y Hormone. And you want to enjoy it with a clear conscience. Perhaps it's as you say--there may be other factors involved. By knowing what they are you may be able to negate their influence.\" Staghorn's voice was a soft purr as he took Dr. Peccary's arm and urged him into the transmitter unit. Peccary sat down. The seat was small and hard.  \"Just bear one thing in mind,\" Staghorn said. \"Don't get lost. It will be best if you stay in the little park where I can see you and where you'll be in focus. Unless you're in focus it might be impossible to--ah--disengage you.\"  Dr. Peccary could find no meaning whatsoever in this statement, except confirmation of his suspicion that Staghorn was mad. He felt this so strongly that he started to rise from his seat and escape from the transmitter cell. But at that moment Staghorn lowered the helmet onto his head. The sensation he experienced was so novel and startling that he remained seated. For a second or two he could feel the tiny metallic contacts on the inside of the helmet pressing against his skull, but this sensation of physical pressure vanished almost at once. It was replaced by one of headlessness. His body up to his chin still seemed to be sitting in the transmitter--but his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51801"],["title","The Immortals (#3)"],["body","had lost completely its sense of localization in the head.  He could think clearly enough, but had no notion as to the spot where his thoughts originated. Indeed, the whole concept of relative position seemed ridiculous. At the same instant he felt tall as a mountain and as low as a rug. His mind could fill the entire universe, while resting neatly in a thimble. He could also see Staghorn, for his eyes continued to function and transmit optical patterns, but precisely where he was while receiving these patterns he couldn't possibly say.  He heard Staghorn remark, \"Fine. The connection is perfect. It's always better when the subject is bald. I'm going to switch you over into Humanac's circuits now.\"  Staghorn's hand moved across the controls and one of his long fingers flipped a switch.         *       *       *       *       *  This was the last Dr. Peccary saw of Roger Staghorn. Instantly he found himself standing in the center of the small park in his home town. His reaction was not one of alarm. Quite to the contrary, his immediate thought was one of surprise that he wasn't alarmed. Standing there in the little square felt entirely normal and proper.  Next he was jolted by the realization that he must be an image on Humanac's screen. He quickly looked about in all directions, half expecting to see Staghorn's huge face peering down from the sky like God. There was no sign of Staghorn, however. The world about him was as three-dimensional as any he'd ever known. He was in his home town a hundred years after he'd last seen it.  Good lord! He was a hundred and forty-two years old!  This realization was followed by a host of others. Like a man coming out of amnesia, his past began filling with memories. He was rich. He was the richest man on earth. His Y Hormone was used the world over. A mile away, on the outskirts of town, he could see a portion of his huge production plant. He lived in a majestic palace surrounded by every manner of automatic protective device. Protection? From what? And how had he dared to venture out here in the park alone? But wait ... wait. It was all an illusion. Actually he was only an image on Humanac's screen, a mathematical probability.  He must keep that fact firmly in mind, or he might lose his mental balance.  He gazed about at the town, dismayed by its appearance. Not a person in sight. Not even an automobile. Of course, the motor car might have become obsolete during the passage of a hundred years. There must be some new mode of transportation--something undreamed of a century ago!  While he was wondering what this might be, he heard a clop-clop-clopping and was astonished to see three horsemen approaching the square. As they came closer he recognized them as the bearded man and his two companions.  The boy Paul was bound firmly behind one of the saddles.  A strange panic arose in Dr. Peccary's breast, but he managed to suppress it with a reminder that this was all illusion. He was here for purposes of information; he must have the courage to get it. So he forced himself to the curb at the edge of the park. When the riders were within speaking distance, he managed to hail them with, \"Hey, you!\"  His nervousness made his words harsh. But then, there was no reason why he should speak politely to kidnapers. He saw that Paul was conscious. The boy had a gag over his mouth but his eyes were open.         *       *       *       *       *  The three riders reined in their horses and looked at Peccary with frank curiosity.  \"Here's one that didn't hide,\" one of them remarked, in a tone that Dr. Peccary decided was disrespectful. He stepped forward boldly.  \"May I ask what you intend to do with that boy?\" he demanded.  \"He wants to know what we intend to do with the boy,\" said the same man.  \"Yes, I heard what he said,\" the bearded man remarked quietly. He hadn't ceased to study Peccary with his piercing blue eyes. Now he urged his horse closer. \"You must be a stranger here, son?\"  \"Not exactly,\" said Peccary. \"As a matter of fact, I was born here. That was some time ago and it's true I haven't been here recently.\" The way the bearded man stared at him made him extremely nervous. \"But I'm sure that kidnaping is against the law. If you don't release that boy I'll have to--to make a citizen's arrest!\" Peccary knew that his words sounded ridiculous. From the way the three riders exchanged glances it was evident that they thought the same thing.  \"He's going to make a citizen's arrest,\" commented the one who liked to repeat whatever Peccary said.  \"Hush,\" said the bearded leader. And then to Peccary, \"What's your name, son?\"  \"Clarence Peccary. If you don't do as I say I'll--\" He stopped short, his heart leaping as the force of his indiscretion struck him.  The three men had been struck also.  The two younger ones were already on the ground, one on either side of him. Only the bearded man remained mounted. He leaned forward. \"I thought you looked familiar. You're _Doctor_ Peccary of the Y Hormone?\" His voice was a menacing whisper. Peccary finally answered with a slow nod.  \"He must have flipped, running around alone like this,\" a man beside him said. \"However, let's never insult fortune!\"  This was the last Dr. Peccary heard. For at that instant one of the men--he never knew which--struck him forcibly over the head with a blunt instrument.   III  At Humanac's controls Roger Staghorn leaped to his feet in alarm as he saw what was happening on the screen.  Peccary had collapsed now. The two men were draping him across the bearded man's saddle. There wasn't an instant to lose! Staghorn leaped to the transmitter cell where Peccary's material body was seated, his eyes peacefully closed. Staghorn flipped the switch to disengage Peccary's consciousness from Humanac's circuits.  Nothing happened. Peccary's body remained as before, blissfully asleep.  Good lord, of course nothing happened! How could it? Peccary had just been knocked cold; at the moment he didn't _have_ any consciousness! Staghorn opened the circuit again and whirled back to the control console.  He looked at the screen. All three men were mounted again. The bearded leader gestured them on.  They set spurs to their horses and galloped away, taking the unconscious Peccary with them.  \"No!\" Staghorn shouted at the fleeing images. \"No, Dr. Peccary! Stay in focus!\" The horsemen paid no heed--nor did Staghorn expect them to, rationally. His shouts were only involuntary expressions of despair. Grasping the geographic locator, he twiddled it wildly, managing to keep the three riders in focus for several blocks as they sped down a street of the deserted town.  Then they rounded a corner and he lost them.  By the time he got a focus on the area around the corner they were gone. For several minutes he continued to search, shifting the focal point all over town, but in vain. Dr. Clarence Peccary was lost inside Humanac's labyrinthean brain!  Staghorn was stunned. There would be no difficulty in keeping Peccary's physical body alive indefinitely by intravenous feeding, but it was as good as dead while separated from its sense of identity. Worse yet were the probable consequences to Humanac of having a free soul loose in its mathematical universe. These were too dire to contemplate. The machine's reliability might be altogether ruined and Staghorn's life work destroyed. Under the circumstances there was but one course of action. He had to find Dr. Peccary and get him back into focus, so that he could be disengaged from the computer.  First Staghorn focused the geographic locator on the town square, the point from which Peccary had been abducted; from there he could begin tracking him. Next he set the time control so that it would automatically disengage the transmitter units in exactly three hours.  Whether or not he could find Dr. Peccary in that period of time Staghorn had no way of knowing; but at least he should be able to get himself back into focus at the proper moment. Then, in case he'd failed to find Peccary, he could reset the time clock and try again.  Next he opened a second transmitter unit, sat down on the little seat and pulled the helmet down on his head. As sensations of vastness and lost dimensions spread through him, he reached out and pressed down the switch that would pour his own brain impulses into Humanac's circuits.         *       *       *       *       *  Instantly, as with Dr. Peccary, Staghorn found himself standing in the little park.  He examined his hands and slapped his sides a few times, taking time to assimilate the fact that he felt perfectly solid. Ah, Bishop Berkeley was right all the time! The universe was subjective--a creation of consciousness!  He left off these speculations and recalled himself to his mission.  Glancing around, he saw that people were beginning to reappear. They came up from basements and out of the doors of the dilapidated houses and buildings. If there had been a panic, there was no sign of it now. The men and women moved indolently, returning toward the park and the sunlit streets. All were so much the same age and of such similar beauty that it was difficult to distinguish individual members of the same sex. But he finally recognized the girl Dr. Peccary had identified as Jenny Cheever. She had an attractive strawberry birthmark on her hip.  She strolled back into the park accompanied by a young man. The two of them took possession of the bench where Jenny had been seated earlier. They sat well apart from each other, silently contemplating the other passers-by.  Feeling that his knowledge of Jenny's name constituted a sort of introduction, Staghorn approached the couple. The man paid no attention to him but Jenny watched him curiously. Staghorn was not a man over whom women swooned, and it occurred to him that she found something odd about his dark suit and thick spectacles. He seemed to be the only man in town wearing either.  \"How do you do,\" he said to her. \"I"]]]
