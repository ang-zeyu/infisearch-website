She'd be safer in hyperspace in his ship than anywhere else in the universe. And a large metropolis might provide distractions to take her mind off--shadows. \"How would you like to go to Burdon?\"  \"That would be real nice!\" But she was not as enthusiastic about it as he had expected.         *       *       *       *       *  She laid a hesitant hand on his arm. \"Honey,\" she began tentatively, \"you--you seem to spend so much time all by yourself. Do I bore you?\"  \"Of course not, dear,\" he said awkwardly. \"It just seems that way to you. Pressure of business....\"  \"But why do you play chess with yourself all the time?\"  \"I've spent so much time in space that I got into the habit of playing alone. Many spacemen do that.\"  She bit her painted lip. \"Sometimes--sometimes when you're alone in your room, I hear your voice. Why do you talk to yourself?\"  It was an effort for him to meet the beautiful, blank blue eyes. \"When you're alone a lot of the time, sweetheart, you have to hear the sound of a voice even if it's your own, or you start hearing voices.\"  \"But you have me,\" she said. \"You're _not_ alone. But you still do it.\"  \"Old habits are hard to break, dear.\"  She looked up at him, trying to force her way past the wall in his eyes. God help her, he thought, if she ever succeeds. \"Would you like me to learn to play chess?\"  \"Would you like to?\"  \"I--don't know,\" she murmured doubtfully. \"I've never been much good at mind things. But I want to be _everything_ to you.\"  \"You are, sweetheart.\" He stooped and kissed her. \"Don't force yourself to do anything you don't want to for my sake. I'm used to playing alone.\"  \"But I want you to do things with _me_!\"  \"I'll do everything else with you,\" he promised.  He went to his room and shut the door behind him. But she had heard him talking there, so sounds must carry through. When they got a place of their own, he would have the walls and doors sound-proofed. Meanwhile, it would be safer to go to the ship.  As he came out of the hotel door, he collided with a man who looked familiar. It took him a moment to identify the sullen, startled face as belonging to that newest member of his crew, young Something Raines.  \"Hello there,\" he said. \"Were you coming to see me?\"  \"N-no, sir. I was just coming in for a--a pack of Earth smokesticks. I can't stand those _stinking_ native brands!\" The boy spoke with a viciousness so unsuited to the subject that it was almost funny. He flushed, perhaps realizing this, perhaps remembering that Mattern was reputed to hail from this sector. \"It's a question of what you're used to, see?\" he mumbled.  \"Of course,\" Mattern agreed pleasantly. \"This is your first time on Erytheia, is it?\"  \"Yes, my first time here.\"  \"Are you enjoying it?\"  \"Well, I dunno exactly.\" There was doubt in the boy's blue eyes. Something in them seemed familiar, more familiar than just recognizing one of his own crewmen. He had a look of--who? Of Lyddy? But that was absurd.         *       *       *       *       *  The doubt in Raines' face had changed to fear, and Mattern realized that he himself must have been just standing there, staring at him. He laughed. \"You're supposed to _enjoy_ Erytheia; it's a pleasure planet.\"  \"Well,\" the boy said, choosing his words with care, \"it's a pretty enough place, but it's set up more for people with money. I mean there's nothing here for fellows like me; the pleasure's for the rich people only. Even the smokesticks cost almost twice as much as anywhere else.\"  \"We'll probably be leaving soon, so you'll only have to stick it a little while longer.\" Mattern's hand went to his pocket, then fell to his side as he saw the look on the boy's face. If Raines was proud, Mattern would not offend him by offering him money. \"Maybe you'll find Burdon more to your liking.\"  \"Oh, _yes_, sir!\" The young spaceman's face was virtually radiant. _He must have a girl on Burdon_, Mattern thought, amused.  As he walked over to the landing field where his ship was moored, he was troubled by the memory of the boy's voice. Not that it was familiar--but there was the faintest hint of a Far Planets accent. Provincials as a rule didn't go to the terrestrial space schools, but it was, of course, possible. Raines must have had an Earth education, because Mattern followed the rule of the Marine service and never hired a man who didn't have a degree from one of the space schools. He must look at the boy's records as soon as he got a chance.  _The Hesperian Queen_ was not a small vessel. She was one of the newest, fastest, most fully automated models. Moreover, she was large and she glittered like a dwarf star. Lyddy would get a surprise when she came to see the ship.  Mattern greeted the crew member on watch and went up to his luxuriously appointed cabin--suite, really. Inside, a chessboard was set up, as its counterpart was set up in his hotel room, one side in the light from a porthole, the other in a corner full of shadows.  The pieces were not only in position, but a game had been started. Mattern sat down on the bright side and moved a piece.  \"Lyddy's aware of you,\" he told the shadows. \"She has no idea of what you are, of course. But she knows you're around, kqyres. She's half seen you and it's beginning to bother her. It's beginning to bother me, too.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Part of the shifting grayness flowed over the board. When it receded, a knight had changed its place. \"Truly, I have tried to be careful,\" a quiet, rather tired voice said out of a darkness at the heart of the shadows, an area that was tenuously substant. \"Is it certain that you yourself have not in some way given her cause for suspicion?\"  \"Quite certain. I've watched myself night and day.\" Mattern smiled ruefully. \"Which is damned hard when you're on your honeymoon.\"  \"Is there anyone else who might have spoken of these things to her?\" the kqyres asked.  \"No one.\" Then Mattern remembered the young spaceman he had met coming into the hotel, who seemed to have a look of Lyddy. But that was nonsensical. Looking _like_ her didn't mean talking _to_ her. In any case, what would Raines know that he could tell her? Silly to be so suspicious. The Golden Apple _was_ one of the few places in Erytheia City where one could get Earth smokesticks. \"No one,\" Mattern repeated. \"No one at all.\"  The patterns shifted and darkened. \"Then I must be getting careless. I am growing old.\"  \"Anyone can make a slip,\" Mattern said reassuringly. \"Just try to be a little more careful, that's all.\" He moved a rook.  The grayness crept out over the board, touched a bishop, hesitated, and moved to a pawn. _He is getting old_, Mattern thought pityingly, as he took the pawn. _Once I could never beat him. Now I win two games out of three._  \"But you are content with the woman?\" his partner asked anxiously. \"You are not disappointed with her in any way? She pleases you as much today as she did when first you set eyes on her?\"  \"Of course she does! You'd think it was you who'd been dreaming of her all these years, not me.\"  \"I suppose we shared those dreams....\"  \"And you'd never seen her.\" Mattern stared intently at the shadow. \"Are you disappointed, then?\"  \"Of course not. You know that to me a human woman is merely an object of art. And she _is_ very beautiful. But I thought she might not have come up to your expectations. Reality often falls short of dreams.\" The shadow's voice tautened. \"Has she changed much?\"  \"Very little,\" Mattern said, absorbed once more in the game. \"You'd think only a year or two had passed. Surprising how women do it.\"  The shadow sighed. \"Surprising,\" it agreed, its voice relaxing. \"But then the female sex is mysterious.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They played on a while in silence. The kqyres finally spoke. \"You will need a lot of money to provide an establishment fitting for so lovely a lady.\"  \"I have a lot of money,\" Mattern said. \"More than enough.\"  The kqyres flickered so violently that Mattern's eyes hurt. \"Not enough for the things she deserves to have. Jewels, palaces, planets....\"  \"One thing I know would make it a lot more comfortable for her,\" Mattern suggested. \"If only you didn't have to be close to me all the time, kqyres. If only you could stay on the ship even when I'm not there. Not that I don't enjoy your company,\" he added quickly, \"but she seems to be highly strung.\"  \"Do you think I like the situation any better than you? But this is the way the mbretersha has ordered it.\"  \"I suppose she knows what she's doing,\" Mattern sighed. In any case, the mbretersha's orders were absolute and could not be contravened--otherwise, at least one universe might be destroyed. There were still so many things he didn't understand and was not likely to learn.  \"Strange,\" he went on pensively, \"that Lyddy should have seen you, when I hardly can, and I _know_ you're here.\" He knew, too, that the kqyres was deliberately vibrating out of phase, so that the horror of his appearance in this continuum would be spared not only those he chanced to meet, but also himself. There was always the danger of passing a mirror. Knowing how the kqyres looked in his own universe, knowing how he himself looked in the kqyres' universe, Mattern didn't doubt that any revelation would be a frightful one. However, he couldn't help being curious.  \"I still think someone must have told her where to stare,\" the shadow said, \"and what for.\"  \"Don't be absurd!\" Mattern snapped, outraged at the idea that his carefully kept secret might not be a secret at all. \"Just try to be careful when she's around. Vibrate harder, or something.\"  \"I shall do my poor best.\" The shadowy one hesitated. \"Do you not think that if perhaps you were to tell her the truth--\"  \"Lord,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51844"],["title","Someone to Watch Over Me (#2)"],["body","o!\" Mattern exclaimed. \"She'd take a fit!\"  \"Once you would not have spoken of her that way,\" the kqyres said reproachfully.  \"I didn't mean it the way it sounded,\" Mattern tried to explain. \"It's just that--well, by now I hardly remember what the truth is myself.\"   III  Did that truth go back fifteen years, to the time he had met the kqyres, twenty years to the time he had first seen Lyddy? Or even further back than that? Did it go back, say, twenty-four years, to the time when he was sixteen and had killed his stepfather? He could still see Karl Brodek lying there with his head crushed, could still feel the terror rising in him at what he had done....  Then he had turned and fled the small community on Fairhurst--one of the Clytemnestra planets--and made for the capital, where he shipped out on one of the small tramp freighters that voyaged among the planets of that system. None of the four other planets was human-inhabitable, but two had mining stations, and one had a native civilization advanced enough to make trading practicable, though not very profitable.         *       *       *       *       *  For the next four years, he drifted from one tenth-rate ship to another, one ill-paid job to another. In all this time, he never left the Clytemnestra System. As soon as he was satisfied that his former neighbors were not going to set the law on his trail, he had no desire to go away. It wasn't place-liking that kept him; it was dread of the Jump.  Most spacemen never do quite get over their dread of the hyperspace Jump, but with Len the dread amounted almost to a mania. He was ashamed of the feeling, especially since he suspected he'd picked up that extra dollop of terror from the creatures on the native planet.  Self-respecting colonials didn't associate with non-humans, but during those first years of fear that his fellow men were hunting him, he'd felt safe only with the flluska. He learned a little of their language, and he spent such spare time as he had on Liman, their planet. He couldn't breathe the atmosphere, but there were the trading domes; nobody minded if he used them when there was no trade going on.  The flluska were a religious people, with gods and demons similar to those of the terrestrial cosmogonies. Only, while their gods lived conventionally in the sky, their demons lived in hyperspace. Len was too unsophisticated himself to wonder how so primitive a people could have evolved such a concept as hyperspace in their theology. He merely grew to share their terror of it.  The year Len was twenty, the _Perseus_, one of the star freighters that made the long haul from Castor to Capella, found itself in Fairhurst Station short one deckhand. The man they'd shipped out with was in jail, waiting to see whether a manslaughter or assault charge was going to be lodged against him. The ship could not afford to wait. The station was scoured for a replacement and Len Mattern was the best man they could find.  Normally the starships did not take on untrained hands. Even the lowliest crewman was supposed to have spent a minimum number of years at the space schools, because in theory, all promotions came from the ranks, even in the merchant service. But in spite of his lack of training, they offered him the job. The bigline ships never liked to sail shorthanded; in case of trouble, that could be a basis for legal action.         *       *       *       *       *  Len knew the opportunity offered him was a dazzling one--not only far more money than he'd ever seen before, but the chance of breaking out of the system. He was afraid though, terribly afraid. \"I've never made the Jump,\" he told the second officer in a quavering voice.  \"You'll never be a real spaceman until you do.\" The second officer was patient, because he knew Mattern was his only chance of making the crew up to its full complement.  \"I've heard tell that--things change their shapes in Hyperspace.\"  \"Maybe they do; maybe it's their real shapes you see out there. Who's to tell what the truth is?\"  Len licked dry lips and tried again. \"They say there're people--beings, anyway--_living_ in hyperspace.\" That tale he had heard from spacemen who had made the Jump. Even if he'd believed in the flluska's demons, he would have had the good sense not to admit such a thing to a starship officer--a man of sophistication from the Near Planets, perhaps even Earth herself. Still, spacemen were notorious myth-spinners. Perhaps he had made a fool of himself, anyway.  But the second officer wasn't laughing. \"Federation law says we should have nothing to do with the creatures of hyperspace. If we leave them alone, they don't bother us.\"  It would have been better if the officer had laughed at him and said there was nothing in hyperspace but space. \"Will we see them?\"  \"Does a ship going through ordinary space see any of us?\" the officer returned. \"The creatures of hyperspace live on their own planets, and we give those planets a wide berth. Simple as that.\" He added, \"What are you so afraid of, boy? Not a ship's been lost in hyperspace for over two centuries, and there haven't been any blowups for years.\"  \"Blowups?\" Len repeated.  \"Accidents. A technical term. You've taken worse risks shipping out in those tincan tramps.\"  Finally, Len gave in--to his own common sense more than to the officer's--and signed up for the voyage. He filled out the necessary forms--hundreds of them, it seemed like. When it came to each line for next of kin, he left a blank on every one.  \"Haven't you any relatives at all?\" the second officer asked, surprised.  \"Not a one.\" Len didn't bother to mention that half-brother back on Fairhurst; a five-year-old kid isn't much kin to speak of. Besides, the boy probably didn't even know he had a brother--he'd been less than a year old when Len left. One of the barren women must have adopted him and brought him up as her own.         *       *       *       *       *  So Len Mattern filled out all the papers and was inscribed on the ship's rolls. And he made the terrible jump through hyperspace for the first time.  People who traveled on spaceships only as passengers never could understand why the Jump was invariably referred to as \"terrible.\" That was because before the ship made the Jump they'd be given drugs, in their cocktails, in their food at dinner, or in their drinking water--and the next day they'd wake up and find they had slept right through the whole thing, so it couldn't be so awful. Of course those who traveled around the universe a lot were bound to catch on. Someday they'd miss a meal or not drink anything and they'd find themselves awake while the ship was Jumping. But the shipping lines didn't take any chances and the aberrant passengers would also find themselves locked in their cabins with smooth metal shutters where the mirrors used to be.  But one thing that couldn't be helped: They couldn't be stopped from looking down at themselves and seeing extra arms and legs; or finding no arms and legs at all, but tentacles instead; or that their skin had turned into shining scales or that there was an extra eye in the back of their head. And when the time came for another Jump, they would _ask_ to be drugged.  However, crewmen couldn't be drugged. They had to be awake to tend the ship. The credo of the Space Service was that you couldn't trust a machine to itself any more than you could trust an extraterrestrial, a non-human. If a man wasn't in charge, ultimately everything would go to pot. That was part of the space tradition, like the primitive axes that hung on the bulkheads, so a man could smash his way to the modern fire-fighting equipment. Except, of course, that if fire really broke out, it would be quicker to press the button that sent the automatic fire-fighting machines into immediate action. But still the axes hung there, because they had always hung there--and, like all the metal on the ship, they had to be kept polished.  Each time a ship made the Jump, the crewmen stayed awake. They saw space and time change before their eyes. They saw their own fellows turn into monsters. It was an awful thing to see, even though they knew it wasn't actually a change, but a shift to another aspect of themselves. Worse than the seeing was the _feeling_. It was like being turned inside out, organ by organ--your heart and your liver and your guts and all the rest, each carefully turned inside out, the way a woman takes off her gloves, smoothing each one with great precision. The hellish part was that it didn't hurt. A man felt as if he were being twisted and wrenched apart, and it didn't hurt, and it was the wrongness of that more than anything else that--well, that was why the pay was so high on the starships. So many of them went mad.         *       *       *       *       *  All this Len Mattern had heard of and had expected--though no amount of expectation could have braced him for that kind of reality. But there was more to it than he had heard, and it was the extra part that the second officer seemed curiously anxious to deny. \"You saw nobody--nothing at the portholes,\" he told Mattern after that first Jump. \"You just imagined it.\"  Mattern had been a spaceman long enough to be able to distinguish imagination from reality. Perhaps the creatures of hyperspace did live on planets, but it seemed they did not breathe the atmosphere of those planets as human beings breathe air, and so they were not confined to them. They could move around freely in the starless dusk of their universe. And, if there was a pact, then they must be intelligent creatures--though he would have known that anyway, for they spoke to him. He could hear them through the tight walls of the ship--less in his ears than his mind--cajoling, entreating, _promising_. And he shut his ears and his mind, because he was afraid.  At the end of the voyage, he was offered a permanent berth on the _Perseus_. \"We don't usually take crewmen from the Far Planets,\" the second"]]]
