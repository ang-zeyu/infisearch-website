I need more.\"  \"I'll figure it,\" replied Carson over the beamphone. He didn't seem interested. After a moment, he said indifferently, \"Fifteen hundred credits for standard rations to crop time. Then you'll need more.\"  \"It's robbery!\" raged Lon. \"I can't expect more than four thousand credits for my crop! You've got three thousand charged against me now!\"  Carson yawned. \"True. A new generator, fifteen hundred; new food supplies fifteen hundred. If your crop turns out all right, you'll start the new season with two thousand credits charged up as a loan against your land.\"  Lon Simpson strangled on his fury. \"You'll take all my leaves and I'll still owe you! Then credit for seed and food and--If I need to buy more machinery, you'll own my farm _and_ crop next crop time! Even if my crop is good! Your damned Company will own my farm!\"  \"That's your lookout,\" Carson said without emotion. \"Being a _thanar_ farmer was your idea, not mine. Shall I send out the food?\"  Lon Simpson bellowed into the beamphone. He heard clicking, then Cathy's voice. It was at once reproachful and sympathetic.  \"Lon! Please!\"         *       *       *       *       *  But Lon couldn't talk to her. He panted at her, and hung up. It is essential to a young man in love that he shine, somehow, in the eyes of the girl he cares for. Lon was not shining. He was appearing as the Galaxy's prize sap. He'd invested a sizable fortune in his farm. He was a good farmer--hard-working and skilled. In the matter of repairing generators, he'd proved to be a genius. But he was at the mercy of the Cetis Gamma Company's representative. He was already in debt. If he wanted to go on eating, he'd go deeper. If he were careful and industrious and thrifty, the Trading Company would take his crop and farm in six more months and then give him a job at day-labor wages.  He went grimly to the kitchen of his home. He looked at the trivial amount of food remaining. He was hungry. He could eat it all right now.  If he did--  Then, staring at the food in the kitchen locker, he blinked. An idea had occurred to him. He was blankly astonished at it. He went over and over it in his mind. His expression became dubiously skeptical, and then skeptically amazed. But his eyes remained intent as he thought.  Presently, looking very skeptical indeed, he went out of the house and unwound more copper wire from the remnant of the disassembled generator. He came back to the kitchen. He took an emptied tin can and cut it in a distinctly peculiar manner. The cuts he made were asymmetrical. When he had finished, he looked at it doubtfully.  A long time later he had made a new gadget. It consisted of two open coils, one quite large and one quite small. Their resemblance to each other was plain, but they did not at all resemble any other coils that had been made for any other purpose whatsoever. If they looked like anything, it was the \"mobiles\" that some sculptors once insisted were art.  Lon stared at his work with an air of helplessness. Then he went out again. He returned with the forked stick that had proved to be a generator. He connected the wires from that improbable contrivance to the coils of the new and still more unlikely device. The eccentrically cut tin can was in the middle, between them.  There was a humming sound. Lon went out a third time and came back with a mass of shrubbery. He packed it in the large coil.  He muttered to himself, \"I'm out of my head! I'm crazy!\"  But then he went to the kitchen locker. He put a small packet of frozen green peas in the tin can between the two coils.  The humming sound increased. After a moment there was another parcel of green peas--not frozen--in the small coil.  Lon took it out. The device hummed more loudly again. Immediately there was another parcel of green peas in the small coil. He took them out.  When he had six parcels of green peas instead of one, the mass of foliage in the large coil collapsed abruptly. Lon disconnected the wires and removed the debris. The native foliage looked shrunken, somehow, dried-out. Lon tossed it through the window.         *       *       *       *       *  He put a parcel of unfrozen green peas on to cook and sat down and held his head in his hands. He knew what had happened. He knew how.  The local flora on Cetis Gamma Two naturally contained the same chemical elements as the green peas imported from Earth. Those elements were combined in chemical compounds similar, if not identical to, those of the Earth vegetation. The new gadget simply converted the compounds in the large coil to match those in the sample--in the tin can--and assembled them in the small coil according to the physical structure of the sample. In this case, as green peas.  The device would take any approximate compound from the large coil and reassemble it--suitably modified as per sample--in the small coil. It would work not only for green peas, but for roots, barks, herbs, berries, blossoms and flowers.  It would even work for _thanar_ leaves.  When that last fact occurred to him, Lon Simpson went quietly loony, trying to figure out how he had come to think of such a thing. He was definitely crocked, because he picked up the beamphone and told Cathy all about it. And he was not loony because he told Cathy, but because he forgot his earlier suspicions of why there was a central station for beamphones in Cetopolis, instead of a modern direct-communication system.  In fact, he forgot the system in operation on Cetis Gamma Two--the Company's system. It had been designed to put colonists through the wringer and deposit them at its own farm to be day-laborers forever with due regard to human law. But it was a very efficient system.  It took care of strokes of genius, too.  That night, Carson, listening boredly to the record of all the conversations over the beamphone during the day, heard what Lon had told Cathy. He didn't believe it, of course.  But he made a memo to look into it.  Rhadampsicus stretched himself. Out on the ninth planet, the weather was slightly warmer--almost six degrees Kelvin, two hundred and sixty-odd degrees centigrade below zero--and he was inclined to be lazy. But he was very handsome, in Nodalictha's eyes. He was seventy or more feet from his foremost eye stalk to the tip of his least crimson appendage, and he fluoresced beautifully in the starlight. He was a very gallant young bridegroom.  When he saw Nodalictha looking at him admiringly, he said with his customary tenderness:  \"It was fatiguing to make him go through it, darling, but since you wished it, it is done. He now has food to share with the female.\"  \"And you're handsome, too, Rhadampsicus!\" Nodalictha said irrelevantly.  She felt as brides sometimes do on their honeymoons. She was quite sure that she had not only the bravest and handsomest of husbands, but the most thoughtful and considerate.  Presently, with their eye stalks intertwined, he asked softly:  \"Are you weary of this place, darling? I would like to watch the rest of this rather rare phenomenon, but if you're not interested, we can go on. And truly I won't mind.\"  \"Of course we'll stay!\" protested Nodalictha. \"I want to do anything you want to. I'm perfectly happy just being with you.\"  And, unquestionably, she was.         *       *       *       *       *  Carson, though bored, was a bit upset by the recorded conversation he'd listened to. Lon Simpson had been almost incoherent, but he obviously meant Cathy to take him seriously. And there were some things to back it up.  He'd reported his generator hopelessly useless--and hadn't bought a new one. He'd reported all his food spoiled--and hadn't bought more. Carson thought it over carefully. The crop inspection helicopter reported Simpson's fields in much better shape than average, so his tractor was obviously working.  Carson asked casual, deadpan questions of other colonists who came into the Company store. Most of them were harried, sullen and bitter. They were unanimously aware of the wringer they were being put through. They knew what the Company was doing to them and they hated Carson because he represented it. But they did answer Carson's casual questions about Lon Simpson.  Yes, he'd tried to borrow food from them. No, they couldn't lend it to him. Yes, he was still eating. In fact he was offering to swap food. He was short on fruit and long on frozen green peas. Then he was long on fruit and frozen green peas and short on frozen sweet corn and strawberries. No, he didn't want to trade on a big scale. One package of frozen strawberries was all he wanted. He gave six packages of frozen peas for it. He gave six packages of frozen strawberries for one package of frozen sweet corn. He'd swapped a dozen parcels of sweet corn for one of fillet of flounder, two dozen fillet of flounder for cigarettes, and fifty cartons of cigarettes for a frozen roast of beef.  It didn't make sense unless the conversation on the beamphone was right. If what Lon had told Cathy was true, he'd have his frozen food locker filled up again by now. He had some sort of device which converted the indigestible local flora and fauna into digestible Earth products. To suspect such a thing was preposterous, but Carson suspected everyone and everything.  As representative of the Company, Carson naturally did its dirty work. New colonists bought farms from the central office on Earth and happily took ship to Cetis Gamma Two. Then Carson put them through their instruction course, outfitted them to try farming on their own, and saw to it that they went bankrupt and either starved or took jobs as farmhands for the Company, at wages assuring that they could never take ship away again.  It was a nasty job and Carson did it very well, because he loved it.  While he still debated Lon's insane boasts to Cathy over the beamphone system, he prepared to take over the farm of another colonist. That man had been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51102"],["title","The Sentimentalists (#4)"],["body","in debt than Lon, and he'd been less skilled at repairs, so it was time to gather him in. Carson called him to Cetopolis to tell him that the Company regretfully could not extend further credit, would have to take back his farm, house, and remaining food stores, and finish the cultivation of his _thanar_ leaf crop to repay itself for the trouble.  The colonist, however, said briefly: \"Go to hell.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He started to leave Carson's air-cooled office. Carson said mildly:  \"You're broke. You'll want a job when you haven't got a farm. You can't afford to tell me to go to hell.\"  \"You can't take my farm unless my fields are neglected,\" the colonist said comfortably. \"They aren't. And my _thanar_ leaf crop is going to be a bumper one. I'll pay off all I owe--and we colonists are planning to start a trading company of our own, to bring in good machinery and deal fairly.\"  Carson smiled coldly.  \"You forget something,\" he said. \"As representative of the Trading Company, I can call on you to pay up all your debts at once, if I have reason to think you intend to try to evade payment. I do think so. I call on you for immediate payment in full. Pay up, please!\"  This was an especially neat paragraph in the fine print of the colonists' contract with the Company. Any time a colonist got obstinate he could be required to pay all he owed, on the dot. And if he had enough to pay, he wouldn't owe. So the Trading Company could ruin anybody.  But this colonist merely grinned.  \"By law,\" he observed, \"you have to accept _thanar_ leaves as legal tender, at five credits a kilo. Send out a truck for your payment. I've got six tons in my barn, all ready to turn in.\"  He made a most indecorous gesture and walked out. A moment later, he put his head back in.  \"I forgot,\" he commented politely. \"You said I couldn't afford to tell you to go to hell. With six tons of _thanar_ leaves on hand, I'm telling you to--\"  He added several other things, compared to which telling Carson to go to hell was the height of courtesy. He went away.  Carson went a little pale. It occurred to him that this colonist was a close neighbor of Lon Simpson. Maybe Lon had gotten tired of converting _dhil_ weed and shiver leaves into green peas and asparagus, and had gotten to work turning out _thanar_.         *       *       *       *       *  Carson went to Lon's farm. It was a very bad road, and any four-wheeled vehicle would have shaken itself to pieces on the way. The gyrocar merely jolted Carson severely. The jolting kept him from noticing how hot the weather was. It was really extraordinarily hot, and Carson suffered more because he spent most of his time in an air-conditioned office. But for the same reason he did not suspect anything abnormal.  When he reached Lon's farm, he noticed that the _thanar_ leaves were growing admirably. For a moment, sweating as he was, he was reminded of tobacco plants growing on Maryland hillsides. The heat and the bluish-green color of the plants seemed very familiar. But then a cateagle ran hastily up a tree, out on a branch, and launched its crimson furry self into midair. That broke the spell of supposedly familiar things.  Carson turned his gyrocar in at Lon Simpson's house. There were half a dozen other colonists around. Two of them drove up with farm trucks loaded with mixed foliage. They had pulled up, cut off and dragged down just about anything that grew, and loaded their truck with it. Two other colonists were loading another cart with _thanar_ leaves, neatly bundled and ready for the warehouse.  They regarded Carson with pleased eyes. Carson spoke severely to Cathy.  \"What are you doing here? You're supposed to be on duty at the beamphone exchange! You can be discharged--\"  Lon Simpson said negligently, \"I'm paying her passage. By law, anybody can pay the passage of any woman if she intends to marry him, and then her contract with the company is ended. They had rules like that in ancient days--only they used to pay in tobacco instead of _thanar_ leaves.\"  Carson gulped. \"But how will you pay her fare?\" He asked sternly. \"You're in debt to the Company yourself.\"  Lon Simpson jerked his thumb toward his barn. Carson turned and looked. It was a nice-looking barn. The aluminum siding set it off against a backing of shiver trees, _dhil_ and giant _sketit_ growth. Carson's eyes bugged out. Lon's barn was packed so tightly with _thanar_ leaves that they bulged out the doors.  \"I need to turn some of that stuff in, anyhow,\" said Lon pleasantly. \"I haven't got storage space for it. By law you have to buy it at five credits a kilo. I wish you'd send out and get some. I'd like to build up some credit. Think I'll take a trip back to Earth.\"  At this moment, there was a very peculiar wave of heat. It was not violent, but the temperature went up about four degrees--suddenly, as if somebody had turned on a room heater.  But still nobody looked up at the sun.         *       *       *       *       *  Rattled, Carson demanded furiously if Lon had converted other local foliage into _thanar_ leaves, as he'd made his green peas and the other stuff he'd told Cathy about on the beamphone. Lon tensed, and observed to the other colonists that evidently all beamphones played into recorders. The atmosphere became unfriendly. Carson got more rattled still. He began to wave his arms and sputter.  Lon Simpson treated him gently. He took him into the house to watch the converter at work. One of the colonists kept its large coil suitably stuffed with assorted foliage. There was a \"hand\" of cured, early--best quality--_thanar_ leaves in an erratically cut tin can. Duplicates of that hand of best quality _thanar_ were appearing in the small coil as fast as they were removed, and fresh foliage was being heaped into the large coil.  \"We expect,\" said Lon happily, \"to have a bumper crop of the best grade of _thanar_ this year. It looks like every colonist on the planet will be able to pay off his debt to the Company and have credit left over. We'll be sending a committee back to Earth to collect our credits there and organize an independent cooperative trading company that will bring out decent machinery and be a competitive buying agency for _thanar_. I'm sure the Company will be glad to see us all so prosperous.\"  It was stifling hot by now, but nobody noticed. The colonists were much too interested in seeing Carson go visibly to pieces before them. He was one of those people who seem to have been developed by an all-wise Providence expressly to be underlings for certain types of large corporations. Their single purpose in life is to impress their superiors in the corporation that hires them. But now Carson saw his usefulness ended. Through his failure, in some fashion, the Company's monopoly on _thanar_ leaves and its beautiful system of recruiting labor were ruined. He would be discharged and probably blacklisted.  If he had looked up toward the western sky, squinted a little, and gazed directly at the local sun, he would have seen that his private troubles were of no importance at all. But he didn't. He went staggering to his gyrocar and headed back for Cetopolis.  It was a tiny town, with plank streets, a beamphone exchange, and its warehouses over by the spaceport. It was merely a crude and rather ugly little settlement on a newly colonized planet. But it had been the center of an admirable system by which the Cetis Gamma Trading Company got magnificently rich and dispensed _thanar_ leaf (a milligram a day kept old age away) throughout all humanity at the very top price the traffic would bear. And the system was shaky now and Carson would be blamed for it.  Behind him, the colonists rejoiced as hugely as Carson suffered. But none of them got the proper perspective, because none of them looked at the sun.  About four o'clock in the afternoon, it got suddenly hotter again, as abruptly as before. It stayed hotter. Something made Cathy look up. There was a thin cloud overhead, just the right thickness to act something like a piece of smoked glass. She could look directly at the sun through it, examine the disk with her naked eye.  But it wasn't a disk any longer. Cetis Gamma was a bulging, irregularly shaped thing twice its normal size. As she looked, it grew larger still.         *       *       *       *       *  Out on the ninth planet, Rhadampsicus was absorbed in his contemplation of Cetis Gamma. With nothing to interfere with his scanning, he could follow the developments perfectly. There had been first one gigantic prominence, then two, which separated to opposite sides of its equator. Then two other prominences began to grow between them.  For two full days, the new prominences grew, and then split, so that the sun came to have the appearance of a ball of fire surrounded by a ring of blue-white incandescence.  Then came instability. Flame geysers spouting hundreds of thousands of miles into emptiness ceased to keep their formation. They turned north and south from the equatorial line. The outline of the sun became irregular. It ceased to be round in profile, and even the appearance of a ring around it vanished. It looked--though this would never have occurred to Rhadampsicus--very much like a fiercely glowing gigantic potato. Its evolution of heat went up incredibly. It much more than doubled its rate of radiation.  Rhadampsicus watched each detail of the flare-up with fascinated attention. Nodalictha dutifully watched with him. But she could not maintain her interest in so purely scientific a phenomenon.  When a thin streamer of pure blue-white jetted upward from the sun's pole, attaining a speed of six hundred and ninety-two miles per second, Rhadampsicus turned to her with enthusiasm.  \"Exactly in the pattern of a flare-up according to Dhokis' theory!\" he exclaimed. \"I have always thought he was more nearly right than the modernists. Radiation pressure can build up in a closed system such as"]]]
