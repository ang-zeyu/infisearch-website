It probed to the bottom of his soul.  It swallowed him whole. It dissected his consciousness, tore it to shreds, then yanked away even the shreds. He seemed to be falling into a black hole that had no end.  Ronson did not know how long the blackness lasted. The first sense to come back was hearing. Somewhere near him he heard a grunt. Then the sense of feeling came back and he realized he was lying naked on sand. He didn't much want to open his eyes. Finally he forced them open. His vision was blurred and vague. When it cleared he saw the source of the grunt.  The sound had come from Tal Bock, squatting on the sand near him. Tal Bock was also naked. Unlike Ronson, the millions of microscopic hands in the darkness had not left even a wrist watch on the Martian.  \"Happy--ah--wind time,\" Ronson said. Tal Bock grunted, but did not answer.  \"Where are we?\"  \"Hell,\" Tal Bock said. He got up and walked into the shrubbery behind him.  Ronson rose. He was shaky, his legs seemed too long to reach the sand, a subjective impression that almost amused him, but didn't quite. To the left another Martian was squatting cross-legged on the sand. Ronson looked, then looked again. He moved toward the Martian to make certain.  It was the leper who had been on the street outside the dive. Without the rags, the Martian was hardly recognizable. The sores provided a certain means of identification. There was no mistaking them.  \"How did you get here?\" Ronson asked.  The leper made a weak gesture with his hands which said, \"Go away.\" His attitude was resigned but about his manner was an air of expectancy.  Ronson discovered that the place in which he had found himself was a cavern about half a mile in diameter. It was adequately lighted though the light sprang from no source that he could detect. The place was pleasant enough. There was water here. It flowed in little rills set in stonework. Grass and desert shrubs grew here. The air was moist, with a fragrant sweetness somewhere about it.  Something was in the air besides the moisture and the fragrant sweetness. It was intangible, almost imperceptible. Ronson cocked his head, trying to catch this something. It was always out of the range of his sensory perception, an intangible, elusive quality that perplexed him.  \"Subliminal,\" he thought. \"Maybe super-sonic sound just above the range of hearing.\"  Why super-sonic sound? He did not know. He felt dazed. There was a heavy feeling through his whole body. Why was he here? He had been told he would see Les Ro. There was also talk about a man proving if he was worthy--  He did not like this thinking. He tried to shut it off, but it was a persistent gadfly that returned to buzz again and again in his brain.  The out-of-hearing sound seemed to buzz with it, slipping in and out of hearing too fast for the mind to grasp it. Each time it slipped into hearing for the fractional part of a second, it brought a flick of agony with it. At the touch, he became almost giddy. Alarm bells rang suddenly inside his head. The note went out of hearing again, the giddiness passed, the alarm bells went into silence.  In the shrubbery ahead of him, a figure moved--Kus Dorken.  Two of the worst killers on Mars were here in this place. A leper. A human. Unease came up inside Jim Ronson, a sharp stab of it. Inside his chest a surge of pain broke through the barriers he had erected around it, reminding him of what was there.  He had come here seeking relief for that surge of pain. Instead of getting what he had asked for, he had been thrust into place. With two killers and a leper and--A shout broke into his thinking. A Martian was running along the walls, seeking for an exit. It was Te Hold. Te Hold had recovered from the effect of the thormoline and had been brought here. Ronson watched the Martian run along the walls, searching desperately for a way out. Te Hold screamed as he ran but he didn't find an exit. The screams died out as he reached the far end of the oval, then grew stronger as he came back again upon his own steps.  Kus Dorken slid out of sight. Tal Bock was somewhere in that shrubbery too, where, Ronson didn't know. And didn't care. A feeling of hopelessness was coming up in him. He moved back to the leper, squatted on the sand beside the man, asked a question.  The leper's eyes flicked at him in response but there was no other answer. An ecstacy was in the eyes now. The leper was so lost in this ecstacy that such things as grunted noises from a member of an alien race made no impression on him. Ronson envied him. The leper was close to death but he was so lost in some inner ecstacy that death was unimportant to him.  \"Did Les Ro's Messenger promise you that you would be cured of your leprosy?\" Ronson asked, persisting.  The leper nodded. Again his hand waved in the \"Go away,\" gesture.  \"Go away and let you die in peace?\" Ronson said.  \"Just go away,\" the leper answered.  Ronson rose to his feet, angry. What farce was being perpetrated here? What--The super-sonic note came into hearing. Pain stabbed at his chest.  He lifted his hand involuntarily. The sight of the dial on his wrist watch forced itself through the pulses of pain.  As a part of his research into cell structure, Ronson had worked extensively with radioactivity. In order to protect himself, he had had a microscopically small radiation detector built into the watch itself. Three tiny glow tubes were set into the dial. If the green tube glowed, radiation was present but was safe. If the amber light glowed, be wary. If the red light glowed, _get out fast_!  The red light was glowing now. As Ronson stared, it winked out. Before he could take his eyes away from the dial, the red light flicked on again. The super-sonic note came with it. A flick of very real pain came with the note. The red light flicked out, the note vanished. The pain was gone.  \"Regular pulsations of radiation are being poured through this place!\" Ronson whispered.  It was being done deliberately. The whole cavern was being flooded periodically with bursts of radiation. This meant deliberate intention, purpose, plan. He did not know what impact this radiation might have on Martian flesh but he could guess the effect it might have on human tissue.  Fear came up in him, a flood of it. Anger followed it. The lights on his watch danced. Pain, agony, and the shrill note of the super-sonic came again. Grimly, he began to prowl the cavern, searching for the source of the radiations. The radiation counter in his watch led him to it, by the increased intensity of its glow. The radiations were coming from a single spot in the wall of the cavern. So far as he could tell, the wall was solid stone at this place, but he had seen solid stone walls dissolve in this madhouse. Behind this spot there was intelligent direction of the bursts of radiation.  Back there Les Ro, or someone with him, was playing games of life and death with--  Te Hold came past him, screaming. The Martian was beginning to stumble as he ran. The screams were only gasping sounds in his throat.  Voices rose in shouted argument somewhere in the shrubbery. Ronson moved away.  \"What's going on there?\" he asked the leper.  \"Tal Bock--and Kus Dorken--have disagreed--as to which is the bigger killer--and therefore which is the more worthy. They fight--to decide the problem.\"  The words were quietly spoken. The tone said the matter was of no importance. After he had finished speaking, the leper's eyes went back to the inner ecstacy that he seemed to be watching. Or was it _future_ ecstacy that he was imagining?  \"I hope there is a heaven for Martians,\" Ronson said. So far as he knew, only in heaven could this leper's health be restored. Was the same true for him?  Voices screamed in the shrubbery. Giving ground before the heavy blows Tal Bock was striking at him, Kus Dorken came stumbling backward. He slipped in the sand and fell heavily. Tal Bock leaped at him. Kus Dorken screamed once, a sound that gasped into silence as Tal Bock's fingers closed over his throat. For a time, they threshed in the sand. Then Kus Dorken went limp. Viciously Tal Bock slapped his foe across the face. When there was no response, he poured sand into Kus Dorken's mouth, scooping it up in handfuls and cramming it down his foe's gullet.  Tal Bock got to his feet. The scream that ripped from his lips was pure triumph. Utterly naked, he stood beside the body of his victim, shaking his fist at the roof of the cavern, screaming defiance at the universe.  Ronson fervidly hoped that the radiation flowing through the Martian would strike him dead. The scream went into silence. Tal Bock's gaze fell on the leper, he moved in that direction. Viciously he kicked the leper.  The sick Martian slipped from his squatting position and lay inert.  Ronson moved forward. With all the strength that he possessed, he hit Tal Bock behind the ear. As he struck the blow, the super-sonic note screamed through him.  Ronson's blow knocked Tal Bock sprawling. Like a gigantic cat, the Martian came to his feet.  _Ping!_  Tal Bock moved toward Ronson in little short steps. He was like a cat getting ready to pounce. The grin on his face said he was going to anticipate destroying this human.  _Ping!_  Tal Bock lost his footing. He fell heavily and tried to rise. A confused expression was on his face. The effort to rise was more than he could manage. Collapsing, he lay without moving.  \"Jim! Here! Quick!\" The voice came from the shrubbery. His first thought was that he was hallucinating. Jennie Ware and Sam Crick could not be there in that shrubbery, fully clothed, Jennie beckoning frantically to him, Crick with a needle gun in his hand.  They came to him, on the run. Jennie caught one arm, Crick caught the other. Supporting him between them, they ran through the shrubbery. In the opposite wall, a hole showed, an honest opening,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52009"],["title","New Lamps (#5)"],["body"," not a light-swirling mirage. Inside it, Crick swung shut a door. A Martian lay on the floor of the tunnel.  \"How--how did you get here?\" Ronson gasped.  Crick nodded to the Martian on the floor. \"We persuaded Tocko to bring us. He knew a little more about this place than he ever let on. After he brought us here, we gave him a needle, to keep him quiet while we rescued you.\" The tall adventurer grinned as he spoke.  \"Come on, Jim. We know the way out of here. If we get out before they discover what has happened--\" The girl was all frantic motion moving toward escape.  \"I'm not going,\" Ronson said.  \"What?\" the girl gasped.  Ronson turned to Crick. \"Do you have an extra gun?\"  \"Of course. But, Jim--\"  \"Lend it to me, will you? I may need it before I'm finished here.\"  \"Eh?\" Crick was startled.  Ronson explained what he meant. Crick's face grew grim. He took an extra needle gun out of his coat pocket. \"I guess maybe you could use a little help on this job, Jim. Eh, Jennie?\" He glanced at the girl.  Fear was on her face. She wanted to run, to get away, forever, from this place of horror. But some things were more important than running.  \"We'll make it a threesome,\" she said.  \"Good girl!\" Ronson spoke.  A passage circled the oval cavern. With Ronson in the lead, they followed it until they came to the spot from which the radiations were being poured into the cavern. Here was a large room. The passage led directly into it.  Inside the room was a tremendous array of complex electrical apparatus. Ronson had never seen anything as good as this in even the best laboratories back on Earth. He could not even guess the purpose of most of the equipment, it had been designed by a Martian mind and constructed by Martian hands--with a Martian goal in view.  Set in the middle of the room were the control panels of the equipment. Directly above the panels was a smoky visio screen that revealed dimly what was happening in the cavern. Just rising from his place at the controls was--the Messenger.  He looked up and into the muzzle of the needle gun Ronson was holding. A tiny startled reaction played across his poised face, disturbing the many wrinkles there, then was gone. A smile replaced it.  \"Ah, yes. I had just discovered you were missing and I was starting to look for you.\"  Behind him, Ronson heard Jennie Ware catch her breath. He knew she was thinking that they should have run while they had the chance.  \"We saved you the trouble, Les Ro,\" Ronson said.  The startled reaction was more pronounced this time. \"You guessed?\"  \"That Les Ro and his Messenger were one and the same? It was obvious when you did not need to communicate what I had said to Les Ro. How many others are here with you?\"  The question was important. Their own survival depended on the number of Martians here.  The startled reaction was very real this time. \"No one else is here?\"  \"You are alone!\"  \"I am alone. Many times I have longed--\"  \"Watch him Jim.\" Crick whispered. \"This doesn't smell right to me.\"  \"Do you mean to tell me that you alone built this apparatus?\" Ronson gestured toward the array of equipment in the room.  \"This? This is only a part. It was a long task. Many weary years I have spent here--\"  \"He's telling the truth, Jim,\" Jennie Ware whispered.  \"But one pair of hands, to build all of this.\" Shock was in Ronson, perhaps even greater shock than he had experienced in the cavern. He stared at Les Ro. Respect was in him and admiration, if not liking. \"Then you are indeed a genius. The rumors were partly right, after all.\"  \"Thank you.\"  \"But why couldn't you get someone to help you?\"  Sadness showed on Les Ro's face. \"You have seen the people in the drinking room below. Which of them could understand how an electron circles in its orbit? Many times I have tried to train the brightest of them. The result was inevitable failure. That is why, when you came--\" Longing came into Les Ro's eyes.  \"Watch him, Jim,\" Crick whispered.  \"I know it doesn't track,\" Ronson said. His voice grew grim and hard. Bitterness boiled in it. He was facing his own frustration here, in the failure of his deep hopes in coming to this place. A touch of pain moving through his chest told him what that failure meant to him. He gestured toward the cavern. \"Out there I saw Martians destroying each other. In this, they were wiser than they knew. The ones who died quickly were lucky. The choice was between a quick death and slow, horrible death from the radiation pouring through that place.\"  Pain and consternation showed on Les Ro's face. He seemed to hear only Ronson's last words. \"How did you detect the radiation?\"  \"With this.\" Ronson nodded toward his watch.  \"This is wonderful. You humans actually have a reliable method of detecting radiation! I have striven so hard to build such a device. Let me see it.\" He moved toward Ronson as if nothing else were of any importance in comparison to the detector.  \"Stand back. Kus Dorken and Te Hold and the leper would not have thought the radiation pouring through them was wonderful, if they had known about it. Nor will Tal Bock, before he dies.\"  Real pain darkened the fine patina of the Martian's face. \"Do you really believe this of me?\"  \"I saw it happen,\" Ronson answered. \"I was there. I saw Tal Bock destroy Kus Dorken--\"  \"One moment, please.\" Les Ro's hand moved among the controls. Ronson's hand tightened on the trigger. He held off firing. Somewhere a relay thudded home. Power surged. The wall in the front of the room began to glow with light.  \"Wait, please! Walt!\"  The leper came first through the swirling mistiness. He walked erect, his back straight and his head up. The light of eager anticipation was still in his eyes but something new had been added now--realization.  \"But Tal Bock killed him. I saw it,\" Ronson whispered.  \"No,\" Les Ro gently negated. \"When Tal Bock attacked him, I put him into a trance condition, to save him.\"  Ronson hardly heard the answer. His eyes were fixed on something else. \"The sores--\" The sores were not gone but they had diminished in size. Replacing the rotten tissue, new flesh had already begun to form.  \"This is what he asked, when he came to me,\" Les Ro said. \"This is what he got.\"  \"But this is a miracle.\"  Again Les Ro denied the statement. \"This is natural law in operation, though to you the laws may be unknown. Watch.\"  The leper would have dropped to his knees and kissed Les Ro's hand, but the Martian forbade it, sending him to wait elsewhere.  Te Hold came through the swirling light--a Te Hold who was without fear. Then, Kus Dorken came. He was still spitting sand out of his mouth but the bluster and the bravado and the anger were gone from him. He was a new Kus Dorken. Inside, he had been subtly changed. Flowing outward, the change showed on his face as a gentle kindliness.  \"He was a killer when I saw him first,\" Jennie Ware said. \"Now--he looks like a saint.\"  Les Ro smiled at her. \"He will be a saint, from now on. He knows how to be one, now. As to Tal Bock, he has not yet recovered from your needles. When he does recover, he will come out of the cavern a saint too.\"  \"But why didn't you tell me about this?\" Ronson whispered. \"Why did you just thrust me, and presumably the others too, in there without warning. Why didn't you tell us?\"  \"To have told you, might have defeated my purpose, or prolonged its achievement. I put all who come to me in the cavern. There, the killer will try to kill, the coward will run, the brave man will fight. As the killer tries to kill, he will use the reaction patterns he has known all his life. As he uses them, I throw bursts of energy at him. I disconnect the kill patterns. The energy penetrates right down to the levels of the cells, and even goes lower than that, changing old patterns--\"  \"New lamps for old,\" the girl whispered.  Ronson was silent. His thinking was perturbed, almost bewildered. What Les Ro had said made sense. Reaction patterns had to change down to and through the cellular level. If the patterns were struck by bursts of radiant energy--but this was the method nature used! This was the method of the _something_ they had sought but which had always eluded them. The change in the cells that was called cancer--again pain flicked through his chest--more often than not this change was brought about by radiant energy operating on cellular structure! Les Ro had organized this something, this wild talent of nature, and was making it do useful work.  \"But it did not work for me,\" Ronson protested.  \"Human cellular structure and Martian cellular structure are different,\" Les Ro answered. \"This is the first opportunity I have had to work with humans. More time is needed to produce the changes in them. That is all.\" A beatific smile lit the face of the old Martian. It went slowly away as his eyes came to focus on the girl. Ronson turned, gasped when he saw what she was doing.  She was stripping herself. Without embarrassment and shame, she took off her clothes. She stood before them, naked.  \"A human woman!\" Les Ro said.  \"Outside, I'm a woman,\" Jennie Ware answered. \"But inside I've got more of the organization of a man than a woman. The result has been that all my life there's been a fight within me. Instead of being a woman, I have only succeeded in being a bitch, all jangle of nerves, always trying to do what the men did, but knowing I really couldn't, because I was a woman. I'm tired of this. I'm sick and tired of it!\" Her voice grew frantic for a moment. Then she was calm again.  \"I want to be a woman. Do you think that if I went in there--\" she gestured toward the cavern, \"that you could help me be a--woman?\" The appeal in her eyes and in her voice begged for one answer.  \"I have never worked with a human woman--\"  \"Then use me as a guinea pig!\" As if the answer were predetermined, her chin up, with not a look behind her, she moved through the misty light and out of sight--like Eve stepping into the Garden of Eden in the dawn of a"]]]
