There's been nothing to shoot.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Backing away, they held their spades like spears. The brush crackled and an anteater emerged. It was followed by a wild pig. The three beasts converged on the men, backing them toward the dense wall of the jungle.  \"They're herding us,\" Cable said, his voice going shrill.  \"Take it easy,\" Sorensen said. \"The cassowary is the only one we have to watch out for.\"  \"Aren't anteaters dangerous?\"  \"Only to ants.\"  \"The hell you say,\" Cable said. \"Bill, the animals on this island have gone crazy. Remember Eakins' mouse?\"  \"I remember it,\" Sorensen said. They had reached the far edge of the clearing. The beasts were in front of them, still advancing, with the cassowary in the center. Behind them lay the jungle--and whatever they were being herded toward.  \"We'll have to make a break for it,\" Sorensen said.  \"That damned bird is blocking the trail.\"  \"We'll have to knock him over,\" Sorensen said. \"Watch out for his feet. Let's go!\"  They raced toward the cassowary, swinging their spades. The cassowary hesitated, unable to make up its mind between targets. Then it turned toward Cable and its right leg lashed out. The partially deflected blow sounded like the flat of a meat cleaver against a side of beef. Cable grunted and collapsed, clutching his ribs.  Sorensen stabbed, and the honed edge of his spade nearly severed the cassowary's head from its body. The wild pig and the anteater were coming at him now. He flailed with his spade, driving them back. Then, with a strength he hadn't known he possessed, he stooped, lifted Cable across his shoulders and ran down the path.  A quarter of a mile down he had to stop, completely out of breath. There were no sounds behind him. The other animals were apparently not following. He went back to the wounded man.  Cable had begun to recover consciousness. He was able to walk, half-supported by Sorensen. When they reached the camp, Sorensen called everybody in for a meeting. He counted heads while Eakins taped up Cable's side. Only one man was missing.  \"Where's Drake?\" Sorensen asked.  \"He's across the island at North Beach, fishing,\" said Tom Recetich. \"Want me to get him?\"  Sorensen hesitated. Finally he said, \"No. I'd better explain what we're up against. Then we'll issue the guns. _Then_ we'll try to find Drake.\"  \"Man, what's going on?\" Recetich asked.  Sorensen began to explain what had happened at Site 4.         *       *       *       *       *  Fishing provided an important part of the expedition's food and there was no work Drake liked better. At first he had gone out with face mask and spear gun. But the sharks in this corner of the world were numerous, hungry and aggressive. So, regretfully, he had given up skin diving and set out handlines on the leeward side of the island.  The lines were out now, and Drake lay in the shade of a palm tree, half asleep, his big forearms folded over his chest. His dog, Oro, was prowling the beach in search of hermit crabs. Oro was a good-natured mutt, part airdale, part terrier, part unknown. He was growling at something now.  \"Leave the crabs alone,\" Drake called out. \"You'll just get nipped again.\"  Oro was still growling. Drake rolled over and saw that the dog was standing stiff-legged over a large insect. It looked like some kind of scorpion.  \"Oro, leave that blasted--\"  Before Drake could move, the insect sprang. It landed on Oro's neck and the jointed tail whipped out. Oro yelped once. Drake was on his feet instantly. He swatted at the bug, but it jumped off the dog's neck and scuttled into the brush.  \"Take it easy, old boy,\" Drake said. \"That's a nasty-looking wound. Might be poisoned. I better open it up.\"  He held the panting dog firmly and drew his boat knife. He had operated on the dog for snake bite in Central America, and in the Adirondacks he had held him down and pulled porcupine quills out of his mouth with a pair of pliers. The dog always knew he was being helped. He never struggled.  This time, the dog bit.  \"Oro!\" Drake grabbed the dog at the jaw hinge with his free hand. He brought pressure to bear, paralyzing the muscles, forcing the dog's jaws open. He pulled his hand out and flung the dog away. Oro rolled to his feet and advanced on him again.  \"Stand!\" Drake shouted. The dog kept coming, edging around to get between the ocean and the man.  Turning, Drake saw the bug emerge from the jungle and creep toward him. His dog had circled around and was trying to drive him toward the bug.  Drake didn't know what was going on, and he decided he'd better not stay to find out. He picked up his knife and threw it at the bug. He missed. The bug was almost within jumping distance.  Drake ran toward the ocean. When Oro tried to intercept him, he kicked the dog out of the way and plunged into the water.  He began to swim around the island to the camp, hoping he'd make it before the sharks got him.   III  At the camp, rifles and revolvers were hastily wiped clean of cosmoline and passed around. Binoculars were taken out and adjusted. Cartridges were divided up, and the supply of knives, machetes and hatchets quickly disappeared. The expedition's two walkie-talkies were unpacked, and the men prepared to move out in search of Drake. Then they saw him, swimming vigorously around the edge of the island.  He waded ashore, tired but uninjured. He and the others put their information together and reached some unhappy conclusions.  \"Do you mean to say,\" Cable demanded, \"that a _bug_ is doing all this?\"  \"It looks that way,\" Sorensen said. \"We have to assume that it's able to exercise some kind of thought control. Maybe hypnotic or telepathic.\"  \"It has to sting first,\" Drake said. \"That's what it did with Oro.\"  \"I just can't imagine a scorpion doing all that,\" Recetich said.  \"It's not a scorpion,\" Drake said. \"I saw it close up. It's got a tail like a scorpion, but its head is damn near four times as big, and its body is different. Up close, it doesn't look like anything you ever saw before.\"  \"Do you think it's native to this island?\" asked Monty Byrnes, a treasure-seeker from Indianapolis.  \"I doubt it,\" Drake said. \"If it is, why did it leave us and the animals alone for three months?\"  \"That's right,\" Sorensen said. \"All our troubles began just after the schooner came. The schooner must have brought it from somewhere.... Hey!\"  \"What is it?\" Drake asked.  \"Remember that scorpion the skipper tried to squash? It came out of the detector crate. Do you think it could be the same one?\"  Drake shrugged his shoulders. \"Could be. Seems to me our problem right now isn't finding out where it came from. We have to figure out what to do about it.\"  \"If it can control animals,\" Byrnes said, \"I wonder if it can control men.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They were all silent. They had moved into a circle near the copra shed, and while they talked they watched the jungle for any sign of insect or animal life.  Sorensen said, \"We'd better radio for help.\"  \"If we do that,\" Recetich said, \"somebody's going to find out about the _Santa Teresa_ treasure. We'll be overrun in no time.\"  \"Maybe so,\" Sorensen said. \"But at the worst, we've cleared expenses. We've even made a small profit.\"  \"And if we don't get help,\" Drake said, \"we may be in no condition to take anything out of here.\"  \"The problem isn't as bad as all that,\" Byrnes said. \"We've got guns. We can take care of the animals.\"  \"You haven't seen the bug yet,\" Drake said.  \"We'll squash it.\"  \"That won't be easy,\" Drake said. \"It's faster than hell. And how are you going to squash it if it comes into your hut some night while you're asleep? We could post guards and they wouldn't even see the thing.\"  Brynes shuddered involuntarily. \"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we'd better radio for help.\"  Eakins stood up. \"Well, gents,\" he said, \"I guess that means me. I just hope the batteries on the ketch are up to charge.\"  \"It'll be dangerous going out there,\" Drake said. \"We'll draw lots.\"  Eakins was amused. \"We will? How many of you can operate a transmitter?\"  Drake said, \"I can.\"  \"No offense meant,\" Eakins said, \"but you don't operate that set of yours worth a damn. You don't even know Morse for key transmission. And can you fix the set if it goes out?\"  \"No,\" Drake said. \"But the whole thing is too risky. We all should go.\"  Eakins shook his head. \"Safest thing all around is if you cover me from the beach. That bug probably hasn't thought about the ketch yet.\"  Eakins stuck a tool kit in his pocket and strapped one of the camp's walkie-talkies over his shoulder. He handed the other one to Sorensen. He hurried down the beach past the launch and pushed the small dinghy into the water. The men of the expedition spread out, their rifles ready. Eakins got into the dinghy and started rowing across the quiet lagoon.  They saw him tie up to the ketch and pause a moment, looking around. Then he climbed aboard. Quickly he slid back the hatch and went inside.  \"Everything all right?\" Sorensen asked.  \"No trouble yet,\" Eakins said, his voice sounding thin and sharp over the walkie-talkie. \"I'm at the transmitter now, turning it on. It needs a couple of minutes to warm up.\"  Drake nudged Sorensen. \"Look over there.\"  On the reef, almost hidden by the ketch, something was moving. Using binoculars, Sorensen could see three big gray rats slipping into the water. They began swimming toward the ketch.  \"Start firing!\" Sorensen said. \"Eakins, get out of there!\"  \"I've got the transmitter going,\" Eakins said. \"I just need a couple of minutes more to get a message off.\"         *       *       *       *  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51833"],["title","Meeting of the Minds (#4)"],["body","     *  Bullets sent up white splashes around the swimming rats. One was hit; the other two managed to put the ketch between them and the riflemen. Studying the reef with his binoculars, Sorensen saw an anteater cross the reef and splash into the water. It was followed by a wild pig.  There was a crackle of static from the walkie-talkie. Sorensen called, \"Eakins, have you got that message off?\"  \"Haven't sent it,\" Eakins called back. \"Listen, Bill. We _mustn't_ send any messages! That bug wants--\" He stopped abruptly.  \"What is it?\" Sorensen asked. \"What's happening?\"  Eakins had appeared on deck, still holding the walkie-talkie. He was backing toward the stern.  \"Hermit crabs,\" he said. \"They climbed up the anchor line. I'm going to swim to shore.\"  \"Don't do it,\" Sorensen said.  \"Gotta do it,\" Eakins said. \"They'll probably follow me. All of you come out here and _get that transmitter_. Bring it ashore.\"  Through his binoculars, Sorensen could see a solid gray carpet of hermit crabs crawling down the deck and waterways of the ketch. Eakins jumped into the water. He swam furiously toward shore, and Sorensen saw the rats turn and follow him. Hermit crabs swarmed off the boat, and the wild pig and the anteater paddled after him, trying to head him off before he reached the beach.  \"Come on,\" Sorensen said. \"I don't know what Eakins figured out, but we better get that transmitter while we have a chance.\"  They ran down the beach and put the launch into the water. Two hundred yards away, Eakins had reached the far edge of the beach with the animals in close pursuit. He broke into the jungle, still clinging to his walkie-talkie.  \"Eakins?\" Sorensen asked into the walkie-talkie.  \"I'm all right,\" Eakins said, panting hard for air. \"Get that transmitter, and don't forget the batteries!\"  The men boarded the ketch. Working furiously, they ripped the transmitter off its bulkhead and dragged it up the companionway steps. Drake came last, carrying a twelve-volt battery. He went down again and brought up a second battery. He hesitated a moment, then went below for a third time.  \"Drake!\" Sorensen shouted. \"Quit holding us up!\"  Drake reappeared, carrying the ketch's two radio direction finders and the compass. He handed them down and jumped into the launch.  \"OK,\" he said. \"Let's go.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They rowed to the beach. Sorensen was trying to re-establish contact with Eakins on the walkie-talkie, but all he could hear was static. Then, as the launch grounded on the beach, he heard Eakins' voice.  \"I'm surrounded,\" he said, very quietly. \"I guess I'll have to see what Mr. Bug wants. Maybe I can swat him first, though.\"  There was a long silence. Then Eakins said, \"It's coming toward me now. Drake was right. It sure isn't like any bug _I've_ ever seen. I'm going to swat hell out of--\"  They heard him scream, more in surprise than pain.  Sorensen said, \"Eakins, can you hear me? Where are you? Can we help?\"  \"It sure _is_ fast,\" Eakins said, his voice conversational again. \"Fastest damned bug I've ever seen. Jumped on my neck, stung me and jumped off again.\"  \"How do you feel?\" Sorensen asked.  \"Fine,\" Eakins said. \"Hardly felt the sting.\"  \"Where is the bug now?\"  \"Back in the bush.\"  \"The animals?\"  \"They went away. You know,\" Eakins said, \"maybe this thing doesn't work on humans. Maybe--\"  \"What?\" Sorensen asked. \"What's happening now?\"  There was a long silence. Then Eakins' voice, low-pitched and calm, came over the walkie-talkie.  \"We'll speak with you again later,\" Eakins said. \"We must take consultation now and decide what to do with you.\"  \"_Eakins!_\"  There was no answer from the other end of the walkie-talkie.   IV  Returning to their camp, the men were in a mood of thorough depression. They couldn't understand what had happened to Eakins and they didn't feel like speculating on it. The ravaging afternoon sun beat down, reflecting heat back from the white sand. The damp jungle steamed, and appeared to creep toward them like a huge and sleepy green dragon, trapping them against the indifferent sea. Gun barrels grew too hot to touch, and the water in the canteens was as warm as blood. Overhead, thick gray cumulus clouds began to pile up; it was the beginning of the monsoon season.  Drake sat in the shade of the copra shed. He shook off his lethargy long enough to inspect the camp from the viewpoint of defense. He saw the encircling jungle as enemy territory. In front of it was an area fifty yards deep which they had cleared. This no man's land could perhaps be defended for a while.  Then came the huts and the copra shed, their last line of defense, leading to the beach and the sea.  The expedition had been in complete control of this island for better than three months. Now they were pinned to a small and precarious beachhead.  Drake glanced at the lagoon behind him and remembered that there was still one line of retreat open. If the bug and his damned menagerie pressed too hard, they could still escape in the ketch. With luck.  Sorensen came over and sat down beside him. \"What are you doing?\" he asked.  Drake grinned sourly. \"Planning our master strategy.\"  \"How does it look?\"  \"I think we can hold out,\" Drake said. \"We've got plenty of ammo. If necessary, we'll interdict the cleared area with gasoline. We certainly aren't going to let that bug push us off the island.\" He thought for a moment. \"But it's going to be damned hard digging for treasure.\"  Sorensen nodded. \"I wonder what the bug wants.\"  \"Maybe we'll find out from Eakins,\" Drake said.         *       *       *       *       *  They had to wait half an hour. Then Eakins' voice came, sharp and shrill over the walkie-talkie.  \"Sorensen? Drake?\"  \"We're here,\" Drake said. \"What did that damned bug do to you?\"  \"Nothing,\" Eakins said. \"You are talking to that bug now. My name is the Quedak.\"  \"My God,\" Drake said to Sorensen, \"that bug must have hypnotized him!\"  \"No. You are not speaking to a hypnotized Eakins. Nor are you speaking to a creature who is simply using Eakins as a mouthpiece. Nor are you speaking to the Eakins who was. You are speaking to many individuals who are one.\"  \"I don't get that,\" Drake said.  \"It's very simple,\" Eakins' voice replied. \"I am the Quedak, the totality. But my totality is made up of separate parts, which are Eakins, several rats, a dog named Oro, a pig, an anteater, a cassowary--\"  \"Hold on,\" Sorensen said. \"Let me get this straight. This is _not_ Eakins I'm speaking to. This is the--the Quedak?\"  \"That is correct.\"  \"And you control Eakins and the others? You speak through Eakins' mouth?\"  \"Also correct. But that doesn't mean that the personalities of the others are obliterated. Quite the contrary, the Quedak state is a federation in which the various member parts retain their idiosyncrasies, their individual needs and desires. They give their knowledge, their power, their special outlook to the Quedak whole. The Quedak is the coordinating and command center; but the individual parts supply the knowledge, the insights, the special skills. And together we form the Great Cooperation.\"  \"Cooperation?\" Drake said. \"But you did all this by force!\"  \"It was necessary in the beginning. Otherwise, how would other creatures have known about the Great Cooperation?\"  \"Would they stay if you released your control over them?\" Drake asked.  \"That is a meaningless question. We form a single indivisible entity now. Would your arm return to you if you cut it off?\"  \"It isn't the same thing.\"  \"It is,\" Eakins' voice said. \"We are a single organism. We are still growing. And we welcome you wholeheartedly into the Great Cooperation.\"  \"To hell with that,\" Drake said.  \"But you must join,\" the Quedak told them. \"It is the Quedak Mission to coordinate all sentient creatures into a single collective organism. Believe me, there is only the most trifling loss of the individuality you prize so highly. And you gain so much more! You learn the viewpoints and special knowledge of all other creatures. Within the Quedak framework you can fully realize your potentialities--\"  \"No!\"  \"I am sorry,\" the Quedak said. \"The Quedak Mission must be fulfilled. You will not join us willingly?\"  \"Never,\" Drake said.  \"Then _we_ will join _you_,\" the Quedak said.  There was a click as he turned off the walkie-talkie.         *       *       *       *       *  From the fringe of the jungle, several rats appeared. They hesitated, just out of rifle range. A bird of paradise flew overhead, hovering over the cleared area like an observation plane. As the men watched, the rats began to run forward in long zigzags.  \"Start firing,\" Drake called out. \"But go easy with the ammo.\"  The men began to fire. But it was difficult to sight on the quick-moving rats against the grayish-brown clearing. And almost immediately, the rats were joined by a dozen hermit crabs. They had an uncanny knack for moving when no one was watching them, darting forward, then freezing against the neutral background.  They saw Eakins appear on the fringe of the jungle.  \"Lousy traitor,\" Cable said, raising his rifle.  Sorensen slapped the muzzle of the rifle aside. \"Don't do it.\"  \"But he's helping that bug!\"  \"He can't help it,\" Sorensen said. \"And he's not armed. Leave him alone.\"  Eakins watched for a few moments, then melted back into the jungle.  The attack by the rats and crabs swept across half of the cleared space. Then, as they came closer, the men were able to pick their targets with more accuracy. Nothing was able to get closer than twenty yards. And when Recetich shot down the bird of paradise, the attack began to falter.  \"You know,\" Drake said, \"I think we're going to be all right.\"  \"Could be,\" said Sorensen. \"I don't understand what the Quedak is trying to accomplish. He knows we can't be taken like this. I should think--\"  \"Hey!\" one of the men called out. \"Our boat!\"  They turned and saw why the Quedak had ordered the attack. While it had occupied"]]]
