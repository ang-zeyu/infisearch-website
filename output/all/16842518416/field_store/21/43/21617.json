Just how many girls _are_ there in this raiding party?\"  His first Invader--and he had dropped his weapon!  Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie paused suddenly. This girl--whatever _that_ was--seemed to think him one of her own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn delay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before he killed her. That would make the soldiers accept him!  He stalled, seeking a gambit. \"How would _I_ know how many girls there are?\"  Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl said. \"I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either. Roddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?\"  Boat? What was a boat? \"How would I know?\" he repeated, voice tight with fear of discovery.  If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper was friendly enough. \"Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then. They shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn't it, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn't have to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?\"  \"I wouldn't know,\" Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and rising. \"How did you get in?\"  \"Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the dust and they led me here. Where were you?\"  \"Scouting around,\" Roddie said vaguely. \"How did you know I was a man when I came back?\"  \"Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these androids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!\"  Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find him whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the manhole would help him now to redeem himself....         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'd like to get a look at you,\" he said.  The girl laughed self-consciously. \"It's getting gray out. You'll see me soon enough.\"  But she'd see _him_, Roddie realized. He had to talk fast.  \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked.  \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the Gate, I guess--you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll think it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it over from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!\"  Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even her own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there _were_ a way over the bridge....  \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\"  \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I--I don't want to be alone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?\"  Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed her--_if_ nothing happened when she saw him.  Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand.  A giggle broke the pause. \"It's nice of you to wait and let me go first up the ladder,\" the girl said. \"But where the heck is the rusty old thing?\"  \"I'll go first,\" said Roddie. He might need the advantage. \"The ladder's right behind me.\"  He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from street level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously fingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.  She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her shapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet that were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.  Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that would make things easy when the time came.  He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a full mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he looked too long.  Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of fear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst into sudden laughter.  \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big, strong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and carrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable character I have ever known!\"  He'd passed inspection, then--so far. He expelled his withheld breath, and said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\"  \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't say odd.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When they started down the street, she was nervous despite Roddie's assertion that he knew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if she felt some of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, shared his visions of what the soldiers might do if they found him brazenly strolling with an Invader. They might not believe he was only questioning a prisoner.  Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable.  For that very reason, because he didn't know what precautions would do any good, he took a chance and walked openly to the bridge by the most direct route. In time this apparent assurance stilled Ida's fears, and she began to talk.  Many of the things she said were beyond his experience and meaningless to him, but he did note with interest how effective the soldiers had been.  \"It's awful,\" Ida said. \"So few young men are left, so many casualties....  \"But why do you--we--keep up the fight?\" Roddie asked. \"I mean, the soldiers will never leave the city; their purpose is to guard it and they _can't_ leave, so they won't attack. Let them alone, and there'll be plenty of young men.\"  \"Well!\" said Ida, sharply. \"You need indoctrination! Didn't they ever tell you that the city is our home, even if the stupid androids do keep us out? Don't you know how dependent we are on these raids for all our tools and things?\"  She sounded suspicious. Roddie shot her a furtive, startled glance. But she wasn't standing off to fight him. On the contrary, she was too close for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and shoulder every few steps, and if he edged away, she followed.  He went on with his questioning. \"Why are _you_ here? I mean, sure, the others are after tools and things, but what's _your_ purpose?\"  Ida shrugged. \"I'll admit no girl has ever done it before,\" she said, \"but I thought I could help with the wounded. That's why I have no weapon.\"  She hesitated, glanced covertly up at him, and went on with a rush of words. \"It's the lack of men, I guess. All the girls are kind of bored and hopeless, so I got this bright idea and stowed away on one of the boats when it was dark and the fog had settled down. Do you think I was being silly?\"  \"No, but you do seem a little purposeless.\"  In silence they trudged through a vast area of charred wood and concrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over the water hid Alcatraz, but in-shore visibility was better, and they could see the beginning of the bridge approach.  A stone rattled nearby. There was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, and clung to Roddie's arm.  \"Behind me!\" he whispered urgently. \"Get behind me and hold on!\"  He felt Ida's arms encircling his waist, her chin digging into his back below the left shoulder. Facing them, a hundred feet away, stood a soldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile.  \"It's all right,\" Roddie said, his voice breaking.  There was a long, sullen, heart-stopping stare. Then the soldier turned and walked away.  Ida's grip loosened, and he could feel her sag behind him. Roddie turned and held her. With eyes closed, she pressed cold blue lips to his. He grimaced and turned away his head.  Ida's response was quick. \"Forgive me,\" she breathed, and slipped from his arms, but she held herself erect. \"I was so scared. And then we've had no sleep, no food or water.\"  Roddie was familiar with these signs of weakness, proud of appearing to deny his own humiliating needs.  \"I guess you're not as strong as me,\" he said smugly. \"I'll take care of you. Of course we can't sleep now, but I'll get food and water.\"  Leaving her to follow, he turned left to the ruins of a supermarket he had previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by setting a pace Ida couldn't match. By the time she caught up with him, he had grubbed out a few cans of the special size that Molly always chose. Picking two that were neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, he smashed an end of each with his hammer, and gave Ida her choice of strained spinach or squash.  \"Baby food!\" she muttered. \"Maybe it's just what we need, but to eat baby food with a man wearing a diaper.... Tell me, Roddie, how did you happen to know where to find it?\"  \"Well, this is the northern end of the city,\" he answered, shrugging. \"I've been here before.\"  \"Why did the soldier let us go?\"  \"This watch,\" he said, touching the radium dial. \"It's a talisman.\"  But Ida's eyes had widened, and the color was gone from her face. She was silent, too, except when asking him to fill his fast-emptied can with rain-water. She didn't finish her own portion, but lay back in the rubble with feet higher than her head, obviously trying to renew her strength.  And when they resumed their walk, her sullen, fear-clouded face showed plainly that he'd given himself away.  But to kill her now, before learning how she planned to cross the supposedly impassable bridge, seemed as purposeless and impulsive as Ida herself. Roddie didn't think, in any case, that her death would satisfy the soldiers. With new and useful information to offer, he might join them as an equal at last. But if his dalliance with this enemy seemed pointless, not even Molly's knitting needles could protect him.  He was sure the soldiers must be tracking the mysterious emanations of his watch dial, and had trouble to keep from glancing over his shoulder at every step. But arrival at the bridge approach ended the need"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51241"],["title","Bridge Crossing (#2)"],["body"," this self-restraint. Here, difficult going demanded full attention.         *       *       *       *       *  He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to look as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of concrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the unwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked girders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads made a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you belong!\"  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I belong here!\"  Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her.  She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and out among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they thrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable anchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling support wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was trapped.  He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly would, to finish the job....  But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she dashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved steel surface.  For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the ever-steepening catenary until--because there were no guard-ropes or handgrips--she simply fell. That would solve his problem.  Except it wouldn't be _his_ solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to his friends.  He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog that billowed in straight from the ocean. At first he ran erect along the top of the yard-wide cylinder of twisted metal, but soon the curve steepened. He had to go on all fours, clinging palm and sole.  Blood was on the cable where she'd passed. More blood stained it when he'd followed.  But because his friends knew neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie would admit none either. Nor would he give in to the fear that dizzied him at every downward look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only his holds, till he rammed Ida's rear with his head.         *       *       *       *       *  She had stopped, trembling and gasping. Roddie clung just below her and looked dazedly around. There was nothing in sight but fog, pierced by the rapier of rusted wire supporting them. Neither end of it was in sight.  Upward lay success, if death were not nearer on the cable. No soldier had ever come even this far, for soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never left the city, were not built to do so. But _he_ was here; with luck, he could capitalize on the differences that had plagued him so long.  \"Go on!\" he ordered hoarsely. \"Move!\"  There was neither answer nor result. He broke off an end of loosened wire and jabbed her rear. Ida gasped and crawled on.  Up and up they went, chilled, wet, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted. Never had Roddie felt so thoroughly the defects of his peculiar non-mechanical construction.  Without realizing it, he acquired a new purpose, a duty as compelling as that of any soldier or fire-watcher. He had to keep that trembling body of his alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead.  He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog thinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last hundred feet to sanctuary.  They were completely spent. Without word or thought they crept within the tower, huddled together for warmth on its dank steel deck, and slept for several hours.         *       *       *       *       *  Roddie awoke as Ida finished struggling free of his unconscious grip. Limping, he joined her painful walk around the tower. From its openings they looked out on a strange and isolated world.  To the north, where Ida seemed drawn as though by instinct, Mount Tamalpais reared its brushy head, a looming island above a billowy white sea of fog. To the south were the Twin Peaks, a pair of buttons on a cotton sheet. Eastward lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding, tallest of the peaks and most forbidding.  But westward over the ocean lay the land of gold--of all the kinds of gold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small portion of the setting sun glared above the fog-bank; the rest seemed to have been broken off and smeared around by a child in love with its color.  Fascinated, Roddie stared for minutes, but turned when Ida showed no interest. She was intent on the tower itself. Following her eyes, Roddie saw his duty made suddenly clear.  Easy to make out even in the fading light was the route by which Invaders could cross to the foot of this tower on the remaining ruins of the road, climb to where he now stood, and then descend the cable over the bridge's gap and catch the city unaware. Easy to estimate was the advantage of even this perilous route over things that scattered on the water and prevented a landing in strength. Easy to see was the need to kill Ida before she carried home this knowledge.  Roddie took the hammer from his waist.  \"Don't! Oh, don't!\" Ida screamed. She burst into tears and covered her face with scratched and bloodied hands.  Surprised, Roddie withheld the blow. He had wept, as a child, and, weeping, had for the first time learned he differed from his friends. Ida's tears disturbed him, bringing unhappy memories.  \"Why should you cry?\" he asked comfortingly. \"You know your people will come back to avenge you and will destroy my friends.\"  \"But--but my people are your people, too,\" Ida wailed. \"It's so senseless, now, after all our struggle to escape. Don't you see? Your friends are only machines, built by our ancestors. We are Men--and the city is ours, not theirs!\"  \"It _can't_ be,\" Roddie objected. \"The city surely belongs to those who are superior, and my friends are superior to your people, even to me. Each of _us_ has a purpose, though, while you Invaders seem to be aimless. Each of _us_ helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and end it by destroying it. _My_ people must be the true Men, because they're so much more rational than yours.... And it isn't rational to let you escape.\"  Ida had turned up her tear-streaked face to stare at him.  \"Rational! What's rational about murdering a defenseless girl in cold blood? Don't you realize we're the same sort of being, we two? Don't--don't you remember how we've been with each other all day?\"  She paused. Roddie noticed that her eyes were dark and frightened, yet somehow soft, over scarlet cheeks. He had to look away. But he said nothing.  \"Never mind!\" Ida said viciously. \"You can't make me beg. Go ahead and kill--see if it proves you're superior. My people will take over the city regardless of you and me, and regardless of your jumping-jack friends, too! Men can accomplish anything!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Scornfully she turned and looked toward the western twilight. It was Roddie's turn to stand and stare.  \"Purpose!\" Ida flung at him over her shoulder. \"Logic! Women hear so much of that from men! You're a man, all right! Men _always_ call it logic when they want to destroy! Loyalty to your own sort, kindness, affection--all emotional, aren't they? Not a bit logical. Emotion is for creating, and it's so much more logical to destroy, isn't it?\"  She whirled back toward him, advancing as if she wanted to sink her teeth into his throat. \"Go ahead. Get it over with--if you have the courage.\"  It was hard for Roddie to look away from that wrath-crimsoned face, but it was even harder to keep staring into the blaze of her eyes. He compromised by gazing out an opening at the gathering dusk. He thought for a long time before he decided to tuck his hammer away.  \"It isn't reasonable to kill you now,\" he said. \"Too dark. You can't possibly get down that half-ruined manway tonight, so let's see how I feel in the morning.\"  Ida began to weep again, and Roddie found it necessary to comfort her.  And by morning he knew he was a Man."]]]
