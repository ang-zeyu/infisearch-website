There he killed enough to furnish food for all the company, and when he returned with it they were all glad.  After this they traveled on for several days. At the next stopping place Ishmael died, and was buried there. His daughters mourned very much over his loss, and they complained of Lehi for bringing them from Jerusalem. Laman and Lemuel were still not satisfied, and they found fault with their father, and wanted to kill him and Nephi and then go back to their old home.  But the Lord was with Nephi. His Holy Spirit rested upon him when he spoke to his brothers, and by reasoning with them he persuaded them to obey their father Lehi.  The next stopping place for this little colony or company of people was near the shore of the Arabian Sea or Indian Ocean, a long, long way from Jerusalem. Here was a beautiful country in which there was to be found plenty of food of different kinds. They named this place Bountiful, because so much fruit and honey was found there. They had spent eight years in the wilderness traveling between Jerusalem and this place near the great ocean.  From this story we can learn some good lessons. It shows us that the Lord is ever watching over His children. When Lehi and his company were in want of food He knew of their suffering, but He wanted to try them. When they had been tried enough He showed them how to obtain the food they needed. On this journey the company learned that it was necessary to trust in the Lord and have faith in Him, for they saw that the brass ball which was given them by the Lord to direct them would work only according to their faith.  Points to be remembered in this story: Lehi instructed by the Lord to continue on his journey--He finds a brass ball by his tent door--It points out the direction in which the company should travel--The colony start again on their journey--They stop at times to catch wild animals to eat--Use bows and arrows to shoot with--Nephi breaks his bow, and the company are without food--Nephi makes a wooden bow and goes to the tops of the mountain, where he finds plenty of animals--At another stopping place Ishmael dies, Laman and Lemuel want to kill Lehi and Nephi--Nephi by the power of the Lord gets them to obey their father--The company continue their travels and come to the great sea, now called the Arabian Sea, or Indian Ocean--Here they find plenty of food--The Lord always watches over His children--He lets them suffer in order to try them--It is necessary to trust in the Lord always.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  NEPHI BUILDS A SHIP.  After arriving at the place which they called Bountiful, near the great ocean, Lehi and his company pitched their tents and rested for many days. Here the Lord spoke to Nephi and told him to go to a mountain. Nephi obeyed the voice of the Lord. When he was upon the mountain he prayed, and the Lord told him he was to build a ship that the people might be carried in it across the ocean, to the land of promise.  The Lord promised Nephi that He would show him how to build this ship. Nephi had no tools with which to make a ship, and he did not know how he should get along with the work. But the Lord showed him where he might find iron ore out of which to make tools.  Nephi then made out of the skins of animals a bellows, such as blacksmiths use to blow the fire. He then made a fire by striking two stones together. He did not have matches, such as we use to make a light.  While the company were traveling in the wilderness they did not make much fire. The Lord did not desire them to make much fire or light. He caused their food to taste sweet without cooking.  [Image captioned \"NEPHI AND HIS BRETHREN BUILDING A SHIP.\"]  This the Lord did that they might know that He was their Leader, and that it was by His power they were fed and cared for.  After making a fire, Nephi melted the iron ore to get the iron out of it, and then he made tools from the iron.  When Nephi's brothers saw that he was going to build a ship and cross the ocean in it they made fun of him and called him foolish. They did not believe he could build a ship, nor did they think he could cross the great waters in the ship if he should build one. They were not willing to help him, as they did not believe he was instructed by the Lord.  Nephi reasoned with his brethren when he found they did not believe the Lord had instructed him to build the ship. He reminded them of how the Lord delivered their forefathers out of Egypt, and how He had led their father Lehi and family from Jerusalem, and cared for them on their way. Nephi also spoke to them about their wickedness and their unbelief. This made them angry again, and they wanted to throw him into the sea. As they were about to take hold of him Nephi commanded them in the name of the Lord to not touch him. He was filled with the Spirit of the Lord, and told them if they touched him the Lord would smite them, or strike them so that they would wither.  For several days after this they did not dare to touch Nephi. Then the Lord told him to stretch his arm out towards his brethren, and He would shake them. This Nephi did and the Lord shook them so much that they were willing to believe in Him. They then fell down and were going to worship Nephi, but he told them to worship the Lord and honor their father and mother.  The brothers were now willing to help Nephi build the ship.  From time to time, as He promised, the Lord instructed Nephi about how he should make the vessel, and Nephi and his brethren got out timber and worked it according to the instructions they received.  [Image captioned \"STYLES OF SHIPS USED IN OLDEN TIMES.\"]  When the ship was finished they saw that it was good, and the work on it was very fine; and those who laughed at Nephi and said he could not build a ship were humble now, and they believed the Lord had guided and instructed him.  Now that the ship was built, the Lord told Lehi to take his family and all who were with him and get into it. So after preparing much fruit, and meat, and honey, and other provisions which they needed they all got into the ship, and started out on their journey or voyage.  They still had to be led by the Lord, as they did not know which way to travel. When the ship was launched or loosened from the shore the wind blew it in the direction of the land to which the Lord desired to take them.  We learn from this story that Lehi and his company were led in the wilderness much in the same way as the children of Israel were, when they left Egypt. The children of Israel were forty years in the wilderness going from Egypt to Jerusalem. The distance between these two places was not so very far. The reason they were so long in going was because the Lord desired to teach them certain lessons before they ended their journey, and it took all this time to prepare them to enter the land to which they were being led. Lehi and his company were eight years going from Jerusalem to the sea shore where they built the ship. They too, might have traveled faster, but some of them were disobedient and complained very much. They did not have patience enough and did not trust in the Lord as they should nor believe that He was leading them. The Lord wanted them to learn these things and so He caused them to remain a long time in the wilderness, where they received an experience which was valuable to them.  Points to be remembered in this story: Nephi is commanded by the Lord to build a ship, with which to cross the ocean--He melts ore and gets iron to make tools--His brothers call him foolish and refuse to help him--He reasons with them and they try to throw him into the sea--Nephi commands them to not touch him or the Lord will smite them--The Lord shakes them; they then believe what their brother has told them and are willing to help him build a ship--When the ship is finished all the people in the company go into it and they start on their voyage--The journey of Lehi and his company was like that of the children of Israel when they left Egypt.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  ARRIVAL ON THE PROMISED LAND.  After sailing on the ocean for several days Nephi's brothers, Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, with their wives, began to make themselves merry. They sang, and danced, and spoke with much rudeness. They seemed by their actions to have forgotten how the Lord had cared for them and guided them through the wilderness.  Nephi was afraid their actions would offend the Lord, and he spoke to them about their behavior. But as before, this made them angry, and they said they would not be ruled over by their younger brother. Laman and Lemuel took Nephi and bound him with cords and treated him very cruelly. Nephi was bound so tightly that he could not move.  As soon as Nephi was bound the liahona, or brass ball, failed to direct them in the course they should take, and a great storm arose. The ship was driven backward for three days, and those on board began to be frightened, as they were in danger of being drowned.  But Laman and Lemuel were so wicked at heart that they would not release Nephi. Their father talked with them, but this did not soften their hearts. Lehi and Sariah his wife were getting old, and the troubles caused them by their older sons made them very sick. Their two younger sons, Jacob and Joseph, who were born in the wilderness, were much in need of their mother's care, and were grieved because of her sickness. Nephi's wife and children cried and prayed for him to be released, but this had no effect upon Laman and Lemuel. Nothing but the power of God would move them.  On the fourth day after Nephi was bound the storm became more severe, and it seemed as though the ship would sink. The storm was so terrible that Laman and Lemuel became fearful that they would be drowned. They then repented of their wicked acts and loosened the bands that held their brother.  Nephi's wrists and ankles, around which the cords were tied, were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51095"],["title","Book of Mormon Stories. No. 1. (#4)"],["body","much swollen and very sore; but he did not complain. He thanked the Lord and praised Him for His goodness.  After being released Nephi took the brass ball, or compass, as it was also called, and it began to work again. He prayed to the Lord and the storm ceased, and the ship was guided towards the promised land.  For many days they continued to sail, and at last they reached the shore of the land of promise. The place where they landed was in the country now called Chili, in South America.  Here they got out of the ship and put up their tents. They planted the seeds which they brought with them from Jerusalem. The seeds grew, and soon they were rewarded with abundant crops.  They found that there were animals of all kinds in the forests. There were cattle, and horses, and goats, and many other animals. They also found gold, and silver, and copper.  [Image captioned \"ARRIVAL ON THE PROMISED LAND.\"]  This was indeed the choice land to which the Lord promised to lead Lehi and his colony. Here they could live in peace and happiness if they would keep the Lord's commandments. There were no other people in the country to disturb them.  This story shows us that the Lord is true to His promises. Everything He promised Lehi and Nephi was fulfilled. Laman and Lemuel, who were so full of unbelief in regard to the Lord's promises, could now see that they were all true.  They had no way of getting news from Jerusalem, and they could not tell what was happening there; but the Lord showed to Lehi in a vision the destruction of Jerusalem, which took place just about the time his colony reached the promised land.  Points to be remembered in this story: While in the ship Laman, Lemuel and Ishmael's sons with their wives act rude--Nephi was not pleased with their behavior and speaks to them--They get angry and bind Nephi with cords--A great storm arises and nearly sinks the ship--On the fourth day of the storm it becomes more terrible and Laman and Lemuel fear they will be drowned and release Nephi--Nephi prays to the Lord and the storm ceases--After sailing many days they reach the promised land--The country they arrive at is now called Chili, in South America--They plant the seed which they brought from Jerusalem and raise abundant crops--They find all kinds of animals in the forests, and gold, silver and copper in the earth--This is the choice land to which the Lord promised to lead them--The Lord fulfills all His promises--Lehi saw the destruction of Jerusalem in a vision.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  LEHI BLESSES HIS CHILDREN.  When the little colony of people led by Lehi arrived on the promised land Lehi was quite aged. He knew that he would not live very long. Before he died he wanted to speak to his children and grandchildren and all who came with him across the great ocean. He also desired to bless them, and as he was their father and a servant of the Lord, it was his right to do so.  Lehi was a great prophet. The Lord told him many things that would happen in years to come. When he called his people together to speak to them and bless them, he told them many things which the Lord showed unto him. He reminded them of the great mercy of God in leading them to such a beautiful land, and told them that if they and their children after them would be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord, they should possess the land forever.  The Lord had kept this land for a good people, and as long as they should serve Him they would prosper, but when they became wicked they would not be protected by the Lord. Other people would be led to their country and take possession of it.  Lehi told what should happen to his children or posterity down to the time in which we live. He also gave them some very good instructions. These instructions you can read in the Book of Mormon when you become older. The advice or counsel he gave them is good for others as well as his children, and should be read by everyone who is able to understand it.  [Image captioned \"LEHI BLESSING HIS FAMILY.\"]  After telling them about these things, Lehi called his children to him one by one and blessed them.  In speaking to Laman and Lemuel, Lehi said he feared very much for them. On account of their disobedience he was afraid the Lord would cause a curse to come upon them and their children. He asked them to be obedient to Nephi, their younger brother, whom the Lord promised should be their leader on account of his faithfulness and obedience. If they would do as he desired them, Lehi promised they should not perish, but if they would not, the blessings he promised them would be taken from them.  In speaking to his other sons Lehi also instructed them to listen to and obey the counsel of Nephi, and promised that their children and Nephi's children should dwell together and be one people, and that they and their children should dwell in peace in the land for a long time.  Soon after blessing his children and giving them the instructions he desired they should receive, Lehi died, and his children buried him.  If Laman and Lemuel were not so rebellious and unwilling to believe they might have seen many things to prove that their father was indeed a true prophet. Everything he prophesied about came to pass just as he said; and many of his prophecies were fulfilled while Laman and Lemuel were living. They could see and understand that the Lord spoke to their father, but they were wicked and disobedient. In following stories we will learn what happened to them for their disobedience.  Points to be remembered in this story: Before Lehi dies he calls his family together to bless them and to tell them about what will happen in years to come--He instructs them to keep the commandments of the Lord and obey the teachings of Nephi--Lehi dies--Laman and Lemuel do not believe in their father's words because of their wickedness and rebellion.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  NEPHI AND HIS PEOPLE SEEK A NEW HOME.  Not many days after the death of Lehi, Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael again became angry with Nephi. This was because he had counseled them as the Lord had told him, to be more faithful. Nephi desired his brethren to do better, and this was why he talked with them. He also prayed for them that their hearts might be softened. But their hearts were evil. They became more angry with Nephi and tried to take his life.  They said among themselves, \"Our younger brother thinks to rule over us, and we have had much trial because of him; wherefore now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more because of his words. For behold we will not have him to be our ruler; for it belongs unto us who are the older brethren, to rule over this people.\"  They did not tell Nephi of their intention to kill him, that they might be rulers of the people. But the Lord warned him of what his brethren wanted to do, and instructed him to leave them and go into the wilderness. He was also to take with him all the people who were willing to follow him.  All those who believed in the revelations of the Lord listened to Nephi and obeyed his instructions, and they were willing to follow him into the wilderness. Among these were Nephi's family, Zoram and his family, Sam and his family and Nephi's sisters.  After traveling for many days they found a place suitable for them to dwell in, and there they pitched their tents. This place they named Nephi, after their leader whom they loved. The people also called themselves the people of Nephi. From this time on for many hundreds of years these people and their children were called Nephites, and those who remained with Laman and Lemuel were called Lamanites.  [Image captioned \"THE NEPHITES SEEKING A NEW HOME.\"]  The place to which Nephi led his people when they left Laman and Lemuel is believed to be north of where they landed from the ship when they first came to the promised land. It was either in the country now called Ecuador or in Peru, in South America.  The Lord blessed the people who went with Nephi to build up a new home. They planted crops and raised an abundance of food. They also raised herds of cattle and other animals that were useful to them.  The Lord told Lehi that He would lead him and his children to a rich and choice land; and so it was. His promise was fulfilled, just as it always is.  When Nephi left his disobedient brethren he took with him the brass plates which they obtained from Laban in Jerusalem. The records on these plates were very valuable to him, and he desired to keep them for his children and all who should live after him. These records contained the laws and the commandments of the Lord, and Nephi and his people desired to obey these commandments.  Nephi also took with him the sword of Laban and the brass ball or liahona which his father found near his tent door while traveling in the wilderness, and which pointed out the way for him to travel. Nephi used the sword of Laban as a pattern to make other swords by. This was in order that his people might defend or protect themselves from Laman and Lemuel and those who were with them. Nephi knew that they hated him and his people and would try to kill them if they had the chance.  It was a wise thing for Nephi to have his people make swords to protect themselves with, for in less than forty years after the time they came across the sea to the promised land they had wars and contentions with the Lamanites.  We learn from this story that Laman and Lemuel wanted to rule the people, but the Lord had promised Nephi that he should be their leader on account of his faithfulness. The Lord also said that Laman and Lemuel and their children should be cut off from His presence, that is He would not speak to them or give them revelations if they did not obey Him. Nephi did become the leader of the people, and the Lamanites were shut out from receiving revelations from the Lord on account of their wickedness, showing that the Lord's words were fulfilled. We see by this that the Lord is"]]]
