It was given to me by that remaining grown-up, at the end of a wonderful visit, when he and six of those nine other children came to see me. It was last night, I think--yes, must have been. First there was a murmur of wings above the house; my angel flew in laughing. Then they were here, all about me, full of gaiety and colored fire, showing off in every way they knew would please me. Each one had something graceful and friendly to say to me. One brought me a moving image of the St. Lawrence seen at morning from half a mile up--clouds, eagles--now how could he know that would delight me so much?  And each one thanked me for what I had done.  But it's been so easy!  And at the end the old one--his skin is quite black, and his down is white and gray--gave the remembered image of a two-moon night. He saw it some sixty years ago.  I have not even considered making an effort to describe it. My fingers will not hold this pencil much longer tonight. Oh, soaring buildings of white and amber, untroubled countryside, silver on curling rivers, a glimpse of open sea. A moon rising in clarity, another setting in a wreath of cloud, between them a wide wandering of unfamiliar stars. Here and there the angels, worthy after fifty million years to live in such night.  No, I cannot describe anything like that. But you human kindred of mine, I can do something better. I can tell you that this two-moon night, glorious as it was, was no more beautiful than a night under a single moon on this ancient and familiar Earth might be--if you will imagine that human evil has been cleared away, and that our own people have started at last on the greatest of all explorations, themselves.         *       *       *       *       *  July 29  Nothing now remains to give away but the memory of the time that has passed since the angel came. I am to rest as long as I wish, write whatever I want. Then I shall get myself over to the bed and lie down as if for sleep. She tells me that I can keep my eyes open; she will close them for me when I no longer see her.  I remain convinced that our human case is hopeful. I feel sure that in only a few thousand years we may be able to perform some of the simpler preparatory tasks, such as casting out evil and loving our neighbors. And if that should prove to be so, who can doubt that in another few million years, or even less, we might be only a little lower than the angels?         *       *       *       *       *  LIBRARIAN'S NOTE: As is generally known, the original of the _Bannerman Journal_ is said to have been in the possession of Dr. Lester Morse at the time of the latter's disappearance in 1964, and that disappearance has remained an unsolved mystery to the present day. McCarran is known to have visited Capt. Garrison Blaine in October, 1951, but no record remains of that visit. Capt. Blaine appears to have been a bachelor who lived alone. He was killed in line of duty, December, 1951. McCarran is believed not to have written about nor discussed the Bannerman affair with anyone else. It is almost certain that he himself removed the extract and related papers from the files--unofficially, it would seem--when he severed his connection with the FBI in 1957. At any rate, they were found among his effects after his assassination, and were released to the public, considerably later, by Mrs. McCarran.  The following memorandum was originally attached to the extract from the _Bannerman Journal_. It carries the McCarran initialing.      Aug. 11, 1951      The original letter of complaint written by Stephen Clyde, M.D.,     and mentioned in the accompanying letter of Captain Blaine, has     unfortunately been lost, owing perhaps to an error in filing.      Personnel presumed responsible have been instructed not to allow     such error to be repeated except if, as and/or when necessary.      C.McC.  On the margin of this memorandum there was a penciled notation, later erased. Iodine vapor has been used to bring out the unmistakable McCarran script. The notation read in part as follows: _Far be it from a McC. to lose his job except if, as and or_--the rest is undecipherable, except for a terminal word which is regrettably unparliamentary.         *       *       *       *       *  STATEMENT BY  LESTER MORSE, M.D.  DATED AUGUST 9, 1951  On the afternoon of July 30, 1951, acting on what I am obliged to describe as an unexpected impulse, I drove out to the country for the purpose of calling on my friend Dr. David Bannerman. I had not seen him nor had word from him since the evening of June 12 of this year, 1951.         *       *       *       *       *  After knocking, calling to him and hearing no response, I went upstairs to his bedroom and found him dead. From superficial indications I judged that death must have taken place during the previous night. He was lying on his bed on his left side, comfortably disposed as if for sleep, but fully dressed, with a fresh shirt and clean summer slacks. His eyes and mouth were closed, and there was no trace of the disorder to be expected at even the easiest death.         *       *       *       *       *  Because of these signs I assumed, soon as I had determined the absence of breath and heartbeat and noted the chill of the body, that some neighbor must have already found him, performed these simple rites of respect for him, and probably notified a local physician or other responsible person. I therefore waited, Dr. Bannerman had no telephone, expecting that someone would soon call.  Dr. Bannerman's journal was on a table near his bed, open to that page on which he had written a codicil to his will. I read that part. Later, while I was waiting for others to come, I read the remainder of the journal, as he apparently wished me to do. The ring he mentions was on the fifth finger of his left hand, and it is now in my possession.  When writing that codicil, Dr. Bannerman must have overlooked or forgotten the fact that in his formal will, written some months earlier, he had appointed me executor. If there are legal technicalities involved, I shall be pleased to co-operate fully with the proper authorities.  The ring, however, will remain in my keeping, since that was Dr. Bannerman's expressed wish, and I am not prepared to offer it for examination or discussion under any circumstances.  The notes for a revision of one of his textbooks were in his desk, as indicated in the journal. They are by no means \"messy,\" nor are they particularly revolutionary except in so far as he wished to re-phrase, as theory or hypothesis, certain statements which I would have regarded as axiomatic. This is not my field, and I am not competent to judge. I shall take up the matter with his publishers at the earliest opportunity.[5]  [Footnote 5: LIBRARIAN'S NOTE: But it seems he never did. No new edition of \"Introductory Biology\" was ever brought out, and the textbook has been out of print since 1952.]  So far as I can determine, and bearing in mind the results of the autopsy performed by Stephen Clyde, M.D., the death of Dr. David Bannerman was not inconsistent with the presence of an embolism of some type not distinguishable on post mortem. I have so stated on the certificate of death. I am compelled to add one other item of medical opinion for what it may be worth:  I am not a psychiatrist, but, owing to the demands of general practise, I have found it advisable to keep as up to date as possible with current findings and opinion in this branch of medicine. Dr. Bannerman possessed, in my opinion, emotional and intellectual stability to a higher degree than anyone else of comparable intelligence in the entire field of my acquaintance, personal and professional.         *       *       *       *       *  If it is suggested that he was suffering from a hallucinatory psychosis, I can only say that it must have been of a type quite outside my experience and not described, so far as I know, anywhere in the literature of psychopathology.  Dr. Bannerman's house, on the afternoon of July 30, was in good order. Near the open, unscreened window of his bedroom there was a coverless shoebox with a folded silk scarf in the bottom. I found no pillow such as Dr. Bannerman describes in the journal, but observed that a small section had been cut from the scarf. In this box, and near it, there was a peculiar fragrance, faint, aromatic, very sweet, such as I have never encountered before and therefore cannot describe.  It may or may not have any bearing on the case that, while I remained in his house that afternoon, I felt no sense of grief or personal loss, although Dr. Bannerman had been a loved and honored friend for a number of years. I merely had, and have, a conviction that after the completion of some very great undertaking, he had found peace.  The ring he bequeathed to me has confirmed that."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5141"],["title","What Katy Did at School (#0)"],["body","E-text was created by Doug Levy,  _littera scripta manet_         WHAT KATY DID AT SCHOOL  by SUSAN COOLIDGE   CONTENTS.

CONIC SECTION.  It was just after that happy visit of which I told at the end of \"What Katy Did,\" that Elsie and John made their famous excursion to Conic Section; an excursion which neither of them ever forgot, and about which the family teased them for a long time afterward.  The summer had been cool; but, as often happens after cool summers, the autumn proved unusually hot.  It seemed as if the months had been playing a game, and had \"changed places\" all round; and as if September were determined to show that he knew how to make himself just as disagreeable as August, if only he chose to do so.  All the last half of Cousin Helen's stay, the weather was excessively sultry.  She felt it very much, though the children did all they could to make her comfortable, with shaded rooms, and iced water, and fans.  Every evening the boys would wheel her sofa out on the porch, in hopes of coolness; but it was of no use: the evenings were as warm as the days, and the yellow dust hanging in the air made the sunshine look thick and hot.  A few bright leaves appeared on the trees, but they were wrinkled, and of an ugly color.  Clover said she thought they had been _boiled_ red like lobsters.  Altogether, the month was a trying one, and the coming of October made little difference: still the dust continued, and the heat; and the wind, when it blew, had no refreshment in it, but seemed to have passed over some great furnace which had burned out of it all life and flavor.  In spite of this, however it was wonderful to see how Katy gained and improved.  Every day added to her powers.  First she came down to dinner, then to breakfast.  She sat on the porch in the afternoons; she poured the tea.  It was like a miracle to the others, in the beginning, to watch her going about the house;  but they got used to it surprisingly soon,--one does to pleasant things.  One person, however, never got used to it, never took it as a matter of course; and that was Katy herself.  She could not run downstairs, or out into the garden; she could not open the kitchen door to give an order, without a sense of gladness and exultation which was beyond words. The wider and more active life stimulated her in every way.  Her cheeks grew round and pink, her eyes bright.  Cousin Helen and papa watched this change with indescribable pleasure; and Mrs. Worrett, who dropped in to lunch one day, fairly screamed with surprise at the sight of it.  \"To think of it!\" she cried, \"why, the last time I was here you looked as if you had took root in that chair of yours for the rest of your days, and here you are stepping around as lively as I be.  Well, well! wonders will never cease.  It does my eyes good to see you, Katherine. I wish your poor aunt were here to-day; that I do.  How pleased she'd be?\"  It is doubtful whether Aunt Izzie would have been so pleased, for the lived-in look of the best parlor would have horrified her extremely; but Katy did not recollect that just then.  She was touched at the genuine kindness of Mrs. Worrett's voice, and took very willingly her offered kiss.  Clover brought lemonade and grapes, and they all devoted themselves to making the poor lady comfortable.  Just before she went away she said,  \"How is it that I can't never get any of you to come out to the Conic Section?  I'm sure I've asked you often enough.  There's Elsie, now, and John, they're just the age to enjoy being in the country.  Why won't you send 'em out for a week?  Johnnie can feed chickens, and chase 'em, too, if she likes,\" she added, as Johnnie dashed just then into view, pursuing one of Phil's bantams round the house.  \"Tell her so, won't you, Katherine?  There is lots of chickens on the farm.  She can chase 'em from morning to night, if she's a mind to.\"  Katy thanked her, but she didn't think the children would care to go. She gave Johnnie the message, and then the whole matter passed out of her mind.  The family were in low spirits that morning because of Cousin Helen's having just gone away; and Elsie was lying on the sofa fanning herself with a great palm-leaf fan.  \"Oh, dear!\" she sighed.  \"Do you suppose it's every going to be cool again?  It does seem as if I couldn't bear it any longer.\"  \"Aren't you well, darling?\" inquired Katy, anxiously.  \"Oh, yes! well enough,\" replied Elsie.  \"It's only this horrid heat, and never going away to where it's cooler.  I keep thinking about the country, and wishing I were there feeling the wind blow.  I wonder if papa wouldn't let John and me go to Conic Section, and see Mrs. Worrett.  Do you think he would, if you asked him?\"  \"But,\" said Katy, amazed, \"Conic Section isn't exactly country, you know.  It is just out of the city,--only six miles from here.  And Mrs. Worrett's house is close to the road, papa said.  Do you think you'd like it, dear?  It _can't_ be very much cooler than this.\"  \"Oh, yes! it can,\" rejoined Elsie, in a tone which was a little fretful. \"It's _always_ cooler on a farm.  There's more room for the wind, and-- oh, every thing's pleasanter!  You can't think how tired I am of this hot house.  Last night I hardly slept at all; and, when I did, I dreamed that I was a loaf of brown bread, and Debby was putting me into the oven to bake.  It was a horrid dream.  I was so glad to wake up.  Won't you ask papa if we may go, Katy?\"  \"Why, of course I will, if you wish it so much.  Only\"--Katy stopped and did not finish her sentence.  A vision of fat Mrs. Worrett had risen before her, and she could not help doubting if Elsie would find the farm as pleasant as she expected.  But sometimes the truest kindness is in giving people their own unwise way, and Elsie's eyes looked so wistful that Katy had no heart to argue or refuse.  Dr. Carr looked doubtful when the plan was proposed to him.  \"It's too hot,\" he said.  \"I don't believe the girls will like it.\"  \"Oh, yes! we will, papa; indeed we will,\" pleaded Elsie and John, who had lingered near the door to learn the fate of their request.  Dr. Carr smiled at the imploring faces, but he looked a little quizzical.  \"Very well,\" he said, \"you may go.  Mr. Worrett is coming into town to-morrow, on some bank business.  I'll send word by him; and in the afternoon, when it is cooler, Alexander can drive you out.\"  \"Goody!  Goody!\" cried John, jumping up and down, while Elsie put her arms round papa's neck and gave him a hug.  \"And Thursday I'll send for you,\" he continued.  \"But, papa,\" expostulated Elsie, \"That's only two days.  Mrs. Worrett said a week.\"  \"Yes, she said a week,\" chimed in John; \"and she's got ever so many chickens, and I'm to feed 'em, and chase 'em as much as I like.  Only it's too hot to run much,\" she added reflectively.  \"You won't really send for us on Thursday, will you, papa?\" urged Elsie, anxiously.  \"I'd like to stay ever and ever so long; but Mrs. Worrett said a week.\"  \"I shall send on Thursday,\" repeated Dr. Carr, in a decided tone. Then, seeing that Elsie's lip was trembling, and her eyes were full of tears, he continued: \"Don't look so woeful, Pussy.  Alexander shall drive out for you; but if you want to stay longer, you may send him back with a note to say what day you would like to have him come again.  Will that do?\"  \"Oh, yes!\" said Elsie, wiping her eyes; \"that will do beautifully, papa.  Only, it seems such a pity that Alexander should have to go twice when it's so hot; for we're perfectly sure to want to stay a week.\"  Papa only laughed, as he kissed her.  All being settled the children began to get ready.  It was quite an excitement packing the bags, and deciding what to take and what not to take.  Elsie grew bright and gay with the bustle.  Just to think of being in the country,--the cool green country,--made her perfectly happy, she declared.  The truth was, she was a little feverish and not quite well, and didn't know exactly how she felt or what she wanted.  The drive out was pleasant, except that Alexander upset John's gravity, and hurt Elsie's dignity very much, by inquiring, as they left the gate, \"Do the little misses know where it is that they want to go?\" Part of the way the road ran through woods.  They were rather boggy woods; but the dense shade kept off the sun, and there was a spicy smell of evergreens and sweet fern.  Elsie felt that the good time had fairly begun and her spirits rose with every turn of the wheels.  By and by they left the woods, and came out again into the sunshine. The road was dusty, and so were the fields, and the ragged sheaves of corn-stalks, which dotted them here and there, looked dusty too. Piles of dusty red apples lay on the grass, under the orchard trees. Some cows going down a lane toward their milking shed, mooed in a dispirited and thirsty way, which made the children feel thirsty also.  \"I want a drink of water awfully,\" said John.  \"Do you suppose it's much farther?  How long will it be before we get to Mrs. Worrett's, Alexander?\"  \"'Most there, miss,\" replied Alexander, laconically.  Elsie put her head out of the carriage, and looked eagerly round. Where was the delightful farm?  She saw a big, pumpkin-colored house by the roadside, a little farther on; but surely that couldn't be it.  Yes: Alexander drew up at the gate, and jumped down to lift. them out.  It really was!  The surprise quite took away her breath.  She looked about.  There were the woods, to be sure, but half a mile away across the fields.  Near the house, there were no trees at all; only some lilac"]]]
