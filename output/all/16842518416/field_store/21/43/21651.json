Inside he heard the voices again, and soon a foot and then another pounded on the metal of the passage. He heard Crifer's voice louder than the rest: \"There is Rikud on the floor!\"  Tugging at the handle of the door, Rikud pulled himself upright. Something small and brown scurried across the other side of the viewport and Rikud imagined it turned to look at him with two hideous red eyes.  Rikud screamed and hurtled back through the corridor, and his face was so terrible in the light streaming in through the viewport that everyone fled before him. He stumbled again in the place of the machinery, and down on his hands and knees he fondled the bits of metal which he could see in the dim light through the open door.  \"Where's the buzzer?\" he sobbed. \"I must find the buzzer.\"  Crifer's voice, from the darkness inside, said, \"You broke it. You broke it. And now we will break you--\"  Rikud got up and ran. He reached the door again and then he slipped down against it, exhausted. Behind him, the voices and the footsteps came, and soon he saw Crifer's head peer in through the passageway. Then there were others, and then they were walking toward him.  His head whirled and the viewport seemed to swim in a haze. Could it be variable, as Crifer had suggested? He wondered if the scurrying brown thing waited somewhere, and nausea struck at the pit of his stomach. But if the plants could live out there and the scurrying thing could live and that was why the world had moved through the blackness, then so could he live out there, and Crifer and all the others....  So tightly did he grip the handle that his fingers began to hurt. And his heart pounded hard and he felt the pulses leaping on either side of his neck.  He stared out into the garden, and off into the distance, where the blue-white globe which might have been a star stood just above the row of mounds.         *       *       *       *       *  Crifer was tugging at him, trying to pull him away from the door, and someone was grabbing at his legs, trying to make him fall. He kicked out and the hands let go, and then he turned the handle and shoved the weight of his body with all his strength against the door.  It opened and he stepped outside into the warmth.  The air was fresh, fresher than any air Rikud had ever breathed. He walked around aimlessly, touching the plants and bending down to feel the floor, and sometimes he looked at the blue-white globe on the horizon. It was all very beautiful.  Near the ship, water that did not come from a machine gurgled across the land, and Rikud lay down and drank. It was cool and good, and when he got up, Crifer and Wilm were outside the world, and some of the others followed. They stood around for a long time before going to the water to drink.  Rikud sat down and tore off a piece of a plant, munching on it. It was good.  Crifer picked his head up, from the water, his chin wet. \"Even feelings are variable. I don't hate you now, Rikud.\"  Rikud smiled, staring at the ship. \"People are variable, too, Crifer. That is, if those creatures coming from the ship are people.\"  \"They're women,\" said Crifer.  They were strangely shaped in some ways, and yet in others completely human, and their voices were high, like singing. Rikud found them oddly exciting. He liked them. He liked the garden, for all its hugeness. With so many people, and especially now with women, he was not afraid.  It was much better than the small world of machinery, buzzer, frightening doors and women by appointment only.  Rikud felt at home."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51305"],["title","Confidence Game (#0)"],["body","Game                               By JIM HARMON                          Illustrated by EPSTEIN             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                    Galaxy Science Fiction June 1957.          Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that          the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                  I admit it: I didn't know if I was coming or              going--but I know that if I stuck to the old              man, I was a comer ... even if he was a goner!   Doc had this solemn human by the throat when I caught up with him.  \"Tonight,\" Doc was saying in his old voice that was as crackled and important as parchment, \"tonight Man will reach the Moon. The golden Moon and the silver ship, symbols of greed. Tonight is the night when this is to happen.\"  \"Sure,\" the man agreed severely, prying a little worriedly at Doc's arthritic fingers that were clamped on his collar. \"No argument. Sure, up we go. But leave me go or, so help me, I'll fetch you one in the teeth!\"  I came alongside and carefully started to lever the old man loose, one finger at a time. It had to be done this way. I had learned that during all these weeks and months. His hands looked old and crippled, but I felt they were the strongest in the world. If a half dozen winos in Seattle hadn't helped me get them loose, Doc and I would have been wanted for the murder of a North American Mountie.  It was easier this night and that made me afraid. Doc's thin frame, layered with lumpy fat, was beginning to muscle-dance against my side. One of his times was coming on him. Then at last he was free of the greasy collar of the human.  \"I hope you'll forgive him, sir,\" I said, not meeting the man's eyes. \"He's my father and very old, as you can see.\" I laughed inside at the absurd, easy lie. \"Old events seem recent to him.\"  The human nodded, Adam's apple jerking in the angry neon twilight. \"'Memory Jump,' you mean. All my great-grandfathers have it. But Great-great-grandmother Lupos, funny thing, is like a schoolgirl. Sharp, you know. I.... Say, the poor old guy looks sick. Want any help?\"  I told the human no, thanks, and walked Doc toward the flophouse three doors down. I hoped we would make it. I didn't know what would happen if we didn't. Doc was liable to say something that might nova Sol, for all I knew.         *       *       *       *       *  Martians approaching the corner were sensing at Doc and me. They were just cheap tourists slumming down on Skid Row. I hated tourists and especially I hated Martian tourists because I especially hated Martians. They were _aliens_. They weren't _men_ like Doc and me.  Then I realized what was about to happen. It was foolish and awful and true. I was going to have one of mine at the same time Doc was having his. That was bad. It had happened a few times right after I first found him, but now it was worse. For some undefinable reason, I felt we kept getting closer each of the times.  I tried not to think about it and helped Doc through the fly-specked flophouse doors.  The tubercular clerk looked up from the gaudy comics sections of one of those little tabloids that have the funnies a week in advance.  \"Fifteen cents a bed,\" he said mechanically.  \"We'll use one bed,\" I told him. \"I'll give you twenty cents.\" I felt the round hard quarter in my pocket, sweaty hand against sticky lining.  \"Fifteen cents a bed,\" he played it back for me.  Doc was quivering against me, his legs boneless.  \"We can always make it over to the mission,\" I lied.  The clerk turned his upper lip as if he were going to spit. \"Awright, since we ain't full up. In _ad_vance.\"  I placed the quarter on the desk.  \"Give me a nickel.\"  The clerk's hand fell on the coin and slid it off into the unknown before I could move, what with holding up Doc.  \"You've got your nerve,\" he said at me with a fine mist of dew. \"Had a quarter all along and yet you Martian me down to twenty cents.\" He saw the look on my face. \"I'll give you a _room_ for the two bits. That's better'n a bed for twenty.\"  I knew I was going to need that nickel. _Desperately._ I reached across the desk with my free hand and hauled the scrawny human up against the register hard. I'm not as strong in my hands as Doc, but I managed.  \"Give me a nickel,\" I said.  \"What nickel?\" His eyes were big, but they kept looking right at me. \"You don't have any nickel. You don't have any quarter, not if I say so. Want I should call a cop and tell him you were flexing a muscle?\"  I let go of him. He didn't scare me, but Doc was beginning to mumble and that _did_ scare me. I had to get him alone.  \"Where's the room?\" I asked.         *       *       *       *       *  The room was six feet in all directions and the walls were five feet high. The other foot was finished in chicken wire. There was a wino singing on the left, a wino praying on the right, and the door didn't have any lock on it. At last, Doc and I were alone.  I laid Doc out on the gray-brown cot and put his forearm over his face to shield it some from the glare of the light bulb. I swept off all the bedbugs in sight and stepped on them heavily.  Then I dropped down into the painted stool chair and let my burning eyes rest on the obscene wall drawings just to focus them. I was so dirty, I could feel the grime grinding together all over me. My shaggy scalp still smarted from the alcohol I had stolen from a convertible's gas tank to get rid of Doc's and my cooties. Lucky that I never needed to shave and that my face was so dirty, no one would even notice that I didn't need to.  The cramp hit me and I folded out of the chair onto the littered, uncovered floor.  It stopped hurting, but I knew it would begin if I moved. I stared at a jagged cut-out nude curled against a lump of dust and lint, giving it an unreal distortion.  Doc began to mumble louder.  I knew I had to move.  I waited just a moment, savoring the painless peace. Then, finally, I moved.  I was bent double, but I got from the floor to the chair and found my notebook and orb-point in my hands. I found I couldn't focus both my mind and my eyes through the electric flashes of agony, so I concentrated on Doc's voice and trusted my hands would follow their habit pattern and construct the symbols for his words. They were suddenly distinguishable.  \"_Outsider_ ... _Thoth_ ... _Dyzan_ ... _Seven_ ... _Hsan_ ... _Beyond Six, Seven, Eight_ ... _Two boxes_ ... _Ralston_ ... _Richard Wentworth_ ... _Jimmy Christopher_ ... _Kent Allard_ ... _Ayem_ ... _Oh, are_ ... _see_....\"         *       *       *       *       *  His voice rose to a meaningless wail that stretched into non-existence. The pen slid across the scribbled face of the notebook and both dropped from my numb hands. But I knew. Somehow, inside me, _I knew_ that these words were what I had been waiting for. They told everything I needed to know to become the most powerful man in the Solar Federation.  That wasn't just an addict's dream. I knew who Doc was. When I got to thinking it was just a dream and that I was dragging this old man around North America for nothing, I remembered who he was.  I remembered that he was somebody very important whose name and work I had once known, even if now I knew him only as Doc.  Pain was a pendulum within me, swinging from low throbbing bass to high screaming tenor. I had to get out and get some. But I didn't have a nickel. Still, I had to get some.  I crawled to the door and raised myself by the knob, slick with greasy dirt. The door opened and shut--there was no lock. I shouldn't leave Doc alone, but I had to.  He was starting to cry. He didn't always do that.  I listened to him for a moment, then tested and tasted the craving that crawled through my veins. I got back inside somehow.  Doc was twisting on the cot, tears washing white streaks across his face. I shoved Doc's face up against my chest. I held onto him and let him bellow. I soothed the lanks of soiled white hair back over his lumpy skull.  He shut up at last and I laid him down again and put his arm back across his face. (You can't turn the light off and on in places like that. The old wiring will blow the bulb half the time.)  I don't remember how I got out onto the street.         *       *       *       *       *  She was pink and clean and her platinum hair was pulled straight back, drawing her cheek-bones tighter, straightening her wide, appealing mouth, drawing her lean, athletic, feminine body erect. She was wearing a powder-blue dress that covered all of her breasts and hips and the upper half of her legs.  The most wonderful thing about her was her perfume. Then I realized it wasn't perfume, only the scent of soap. Finally, I knew it wasn't that. It was just healthy, fresh-scrubbed skin.  I went to her at the bus stop, forcing my legs not to stagger. Nobody would help a drunk. I don't know why, but nobody will help you if they think you are blotto.  \"Ma'am, could you help a man who's not had work?\" I kept my eyes down. I couldn't look a human in the eye and ask for help. \"Just a dime for a cup of coffee.\" I knew where I could get it for three cents, maybe two and a half.  I felt her looking at me. She spoke in an educated voice, one she used, perhaps, as a teacher or supervising telephone operator. \"Do you want it for coffee, or to apply, or a glass or hypo of something else?\"  I cringed and whined. She would expect it of me. I suddenly realized that anybody as clean as she was had to be a tourist here. I hate tourists.  \"Just coffee, ma'am.\" She was younger than I was, so I didn't have to call her that. \"A little more for food, if you could spare it.\"  I hadn't eaten in a day and a half, but I didn't care much.  \"I'll buy you a dinner,\" she said carefully, \"provided I can go with you and see for myself that you actually eat it.\"  I felt my face flushing red. \"You wouldn't want to be seen with a bum like me, ma'am.\"  \"I'll be seen with you if you really want to "]]]
