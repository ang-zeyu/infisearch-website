Barlow crossed warily and leaned against a vending machine, blowing big breaths.  _Look natural_, he told himself. _Do something normal. Buy something from the machine._  He fumbled out some change, got a newspaper for a dime, a handkerchief for a quarter and a candy bar for another quarter.  The faint chocolate smell made him ravenous suddenly. He clawed at the glassy wrapper printed \"CRIGGLIES\" quite futilely for a few seconds, and then it divided neatly by itself. The bar made three good bites, and he bought two more and gobbled them down.  Thirsty, he drew a carbonated orange drink in another one of the glassy wrappers from the machine for another dime. When he fumbled with it, it divided neatly and spilled all over his knees. Barlow decided he had been there long enough and walked on.  The shop windows were--shop windows. People still wore and bought clothes, still smoked and bought tobacco, still ate and bought food. And they still went to the movies, he saw with pleased surprise as he passed and then returned to a glittering place whose sign said it was THE BIJOU.  The place seemed to be showing a quintuple feature, _Babies Are Terrible_, _Don't Have Children_, and _The Canali Kid_.  It was irresistible; he paid a dollar and went in.  He caught the tail-end of _The Canali Kid_ in three-dimensional, full-color, full-scent production. It appeared to be an interplanetary saga winding up with a chase scene and a reconciliation between estranged hero and heroine. _Babies Are Terrible_ and _Don't Have Children_ were fantastic arguments against parenthood--the grotesquely exaggerated dangers of painfully graphic childbirth, vicious children, old parents beaten and starved by their sadistic offspring. The audience, Barlow astoundedly noted, was placidly champing sweets and showing no particular signs of revulsion.  The _Coming Attractions_ drove him into the lobby. The fanfares were shattering, the blazing colors blinding, and the added scents stomach-heaving.         *       *       *       *       *  When his eyes again became accustomed to the moderate lighting of the lobby, he groped his way to a bench and opened the newspaper he had bought. It turned out to be _The Racing Sheet_, which afflicted him with a crushing sense of loss. The familiar boxed index in the lower left hand corner of the front page showed almost unbearably that Churchill Downs and Empire City were still in business--  Blinking back tears, he turned to the Past Performances at Churchill. They weren't using abbreviations any more, and the pages because of that were single-column instead of double. But it was all the same--or was it?  He squinted at the first race, a three-quarter-mile maiden claimer for thirteen hundred dollars. Incredibly, the track record was two minutes, ten and three-fifths seconds. Any beetle in his time could have knocked off the three-quarter in one-fifteen. It was the same for the other distances, much worse for route events.  _What the hell had happened to everything?_  He studied the form of a five-year-old brown mare in the second and couldn't make head or tail of it. She'd won and lost and placed and showed and lost and placed without rhyme or reason. She looked like a front-runner for a couple of races and then she looked like a no-good pig and then she looked like a mudder but the next time it rained she wasn't and then she was a stayer and then she was a pig again. In a good five-thousand-dollar allowances event, too!  Barlow looked at the other entries and it slowly dawned on him that they were all like the five-year-old brown mare. Not a single damned horse running had the slightest trace of class.  Somebody sat down beside him and said, \"That's the story.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Barlow whirled to his feet and saw it was Tinny-Peete, his driver.  \"I was in doubts about telling you,\" said the psychist, \"but I see you have some growing suspicions of the truth. Please don't get excited. It's all right, I tell you.\"  \"So you've got me,\" said Barlow.  \"_Got_ you?\"  \"Don't pretend. I can put two and two together. You're the secret police. You and the rest of the aristocrats live in luxury on the sweat of these oppressed slaves. You're afraid of me because you have to keep them ignorant.\"  There was a bellow of bright laughter from the psychist that got them blank looks from other patrons of the lobby. The laughter didn't sound at all sinister.  \"Let's get out of here,\" said Tinny-Peete, still chuckling. \"You couldn't possibly have it more wrong.\" He engaged Barlow's arm and led him to the street. \"The actual truth is that the millions of workers live in luxury on the sweat of the handful of aristocrats. I shall probably die before my time of overwork unless--\" He gave Barlow a speculative look. \"You may be able to help us.\"  \"I know that gag,\" sneered Barlow. \"I made money in my time and to make money you have to get people on your side. Go ahead and shoot me if you want, but you're not going to make a fool out of me.\"  \"You nasty little ingrate!\" snapped the psychist, with a kaleidoscopic change of mood. \"This damned mess is all your fault and the fault of people like you! Now come along and no more of your nonsense.\"  He yanked Barlow into an office building lobby and an elevator that, disconcertingly, went _whoosh_ loudly as it rose. The real estate man's knees were wobbly as the psychist pushed him from the elevator, down a corridor and into an office.  A hawk-faced man rose from a plain chair as the door closed behind them. After an angry look at Barlow, he asked the psychist, \"Was I called from the Pole to inspect this--this--?\"  \"Unget updandered. I've dee-probed etfind quasichance exhim Poprobattackline,\" said the psychist soothingly.  \"Doubt,\" grunted the hawk-faced man.  \"Try,\" suggested Tinny-Peete.  \"Very well. Mr. Barlow, I understand you and your lamented had no children.\"  \"What of it?\"  \"This of it. You were a blind, selfish stupid ass to tolerate economic and social conditions which penalized child-bearing by the prudent and foresighted. You made us what we are today, and I want you to know that we are far from satisfied. Damn-fool rockets! Damn-fool automobiles! Damn-fool cities with overhead ramps!\"  \"As far as I can see,\" said Barlow, \"you're running down the best features of time. Are you crazy?\"  \"The rockets aren't rockets. They're turbo-jets--good turbo-jets, but the fancy shell around them makes for a bad drag. The automobiles have a top speed of one hundred kilometers per hour--a kilometer is, if I recall my paleolinguistics, three-fifths of a mile--and the speedometers are all rigged accordingly so the drivers will think they're going two hundred and fifty. The cities are ridiculous, expensive, unsanitary, wasteful conglomerations of people who'd be better off and more productive if they were spread over the countryside.  \"We need the rockets and trick speedometers and cities because, while you and your kind were being prudent and foresighted and not having children, the migrant workers, slum dwellers and tenant farmers were shiftlessly and short-sightedly having children--breeding, breeding. My God, how they bred!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Wait a minute,\" objected Barlow. \"There were lots of people in our crowd who had two or three children.\"  \"The attrition of accidents, illness, wars and such took care of that. Your intelligence was bred out. It is gone. Children that should have been born never were. The just-average, they'll-get-along majority took over the population. The average IQ now is 45.\"  \"But that's far in the future--\"  \"So are you,\" grunted the hawk-faced man sourly.  \"But who are _you_ people?\"  \"Just people--real people. Some generations ago, the geneticists realized at last that nobody was going to pay any attention to what they said, so they abandoned words for deeds. Specifically, they formed and recruited for a closed corporation intended to maintain and improve the breed. We are their descendants, about three million of us. There are five billion of the others, so we are their slaves.  \"During the past couple of years I've designed a skyscraper, kept Billings Memorial Hospital here in Chicago running, headed off war with Mexico and directed traffic at LaGuardia Field in New York.\"  \"I don't understand! Why don't you let them go to hell in their own way?\"  The man grimaced. \"We tried it once for three months. We holed up at the South Pole and waited. They didn't notice it. Some drafting-room people were missing, some chief nurses didn't show up, minor government people on the non-policy level couldn't be located. It didn't seem to matter.  \"In a week there was hunger. In two weeks there were famine and plague, in three weeks war and anarchy. We called off the experiment; it took us most of the next generation to get things squared away again.\"  \"But why _didn't_ you let them kill each other off?\"  \"Five billion corpses mean about five hundred million tons of rotting flesh.\"  Barlow had another idea. \"Why don't you sterilize them?\"  \"Two and one-half billion operations is a lot of operations. Because they breed continuously, the job would never be done.\"  \"I see. Like the marching Chinese!\"  \"Who the devil are they?\"  \"It was a--uh--paradox of my time. Somebody figured out that if all the Chinese in the world were to line up four abreast, I think it was, and start marching past a given point, they'd never stop because of the babies that would be born and grow up before they passed the point.\"  \"That's right. Only instead of 'a given point,' make it 'the largest conceivable number of operating rooms that we could build and staff.' There could never be enough.\"  \"Say!\" said Barlow. \"Those movies about babies--was that your propaganda?\"  \"It was. It doesn't seem to mean a thing to them. We have abandoned the idea of attempting propaganda contrary to a biological drive.\"  \"So if you work _with_ a biological drive-"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51233"],["title","The Marching Morons (#4)"],["body","-?\"  \"I know of none which is consistent with inhibition of fertility.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Barlow's face went poker-blank, the result of years of careful discipline. \"You don't, huh? You're the great brains and you can't think of any?\"  \"Why, no,\" said the psychist innocently. \"Can you?\"  \"That depends. I sold ten thousand acres of Siberian tundra--through a dummy firm, of course--after the partition of Russia. The buyers thought they were getting improved building lots on the outskirts of Kiev. I'd say that was a lot tougher than this job.\"  \"How so?\" asked the hawk-faced man.  \"Those were normal, suspicious customers and these are morons, born suckers. You just figure out a con they'll fall for; they won't know enough to do any smart checking.\"  The psychist and the hawk-faced man had also had training; they kept themselves from looking with sudden hope at each other.  \"You seem to have something in mind,\" said the psychist.  Barlow's poker face went blanker still. \"Maybe I have. I haven't heard any offer yet.\"  \"There's the satisfaction of knowing that you've prevented Earth's resources from being so plundered,\" the hawk-faced man pointed out, \"that the race will soon become extinct.\"  \"I don't know that,\" Barlow said bluntly. \"All I have is your word.\"  \"If you really have a method, I don't think any price would be too great,\" the psychist offered.  \"Money,\" said Barlow.  \"All you want.\"  \"More than you want,\" the hawk-faced man corrected.  \"Prestige,\" added Barlow. \"Plenty of publicity. My picture and my name in the papers and over TV every day, statues to me, parks and cities and streets and other things named after me. A whole chapter in the history books.\"  The psychist made a facial sign to the hawk-faced man that meant, \"Oh, brother!\"  The hawk-faced man signaled back, \"Steady, boy!\"  \"It's not too much to ask,\" the psychist agreed.  Barlow, sensing a seller's market, said, \"Power!\"  \"Power?\" the hawk-faced man repeated puzzledly. \"Your own hydro station or nuclear pile?\"  \"I mean a world dictatorship with me as dictator!\"  \"Well, now--\" said the psychist, but the hawk-faced man interrupted, \"It would take a special emergency act of Congress but the situation warrants it. I think that can be guaranteed.\"  \"Could you give us some indication of your plan?\" the psychist asked.  \"Ever hear of lemmings?\"  \"No.\"  \"They are--were, I guess, since you haven't heard of them--little animals in Norway, and every few years they'd swarm to the coast and swim out to sea until they drowned. I figure on putting some lemming urge into the population.\"  \"How?\"  \"I'll save that till I get the right signatures on the deal.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The hawk-faced man said, \"I'd like to work with you on it, Barlow. My name's Ryan-Ngana.\" He put out his hand.  Barlow looked closely at the hand, then at the man's face. \"Ryan what?\"  \"Ngana.\"  \"That sounds like an African name.\"  \"It is. My mother's father was a Watusi.\"  Barlow didn't take the hand. \"I thought you looked pretty dark. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I don't think I'd be at my best working with you. There must be somebody else just as well qualified, I'm sure.\"  The psychist made a facial sign to Ryan-Ngana that meant, \"Steady _yourself_, boy!\"  \"Very well,\" Ryan-Ngana told Barlow. \"We'll see what arrangement can be made.\"  \"It's not that I'm prejudiced, you understand. Some of my best friends--\"  \"Mr. Barlow, don't give it another thought. Anybody who could pick on the lemming analogy is going to be useful to us.\"  And so he would, thought Ryan-Ngana, alone in the office after Tinny-Peete had taken Barlow up to the helicopter stage. So he would. Poprob had exhausted every rational attempt and the new Poprobattacklines would have to be irrational or sub-rational. This creature from the past with his lemming legends and his improved building lots would be a fountain of precious vicious self-interest.  Ryan-Ngana sighed and stretched. He had to go and run the San Francisco subway. Summoned early from the Pole to study Barlow, he'd left unfinished a nice little theorem. Between interruptions, he was slowly constructing an n-dimensional geometry whose foundations and superstructure owed no debt whatsoever to intuition.         *       *       *       *       *  Upstairs, waiting for a helicopter, Barlow was explaining to Tinny-Peete that he had nothing against Negroes, and Tinny-Peete wished he had some of Ryan-Ngana's imperturbability and humor for the ordeal.  The helicopter took them to International Airport where, Tinny-Peete explained, Barlow would leave for the Pole.  The man from the past wasn't sure he'd like a dreary waste of ice and cold.  \"It's all right,\" said the psychist. \"A civilized layout. Warm, pleasant. You'll be able to work more efficiently there. All the facts at your fingertips, a good secretary--\"  \"I'll need a pretty big staff,\" said Barlow, who had learned from thousands of deals never to take the first offer.  \"I meant a private, confidential one,\" said Tinny-Peete readily, \"but you can have as many as you want. You'll naturally have top-primary-top priority if you really have a workable plan.\"  \"Let's not forget this dictatorship angle,\" said Barlow.  He didn't know that the psychist would just as readily have promised him deification to get him happily on the \"rocket\" for the Pole. Tinny-Peete had no wish to be torn limb from limb; he knew very well that it would end that way if the population learned from this anachronism that there was a small elite which considered itself head, shoulders, trunk and groin above the rest. The fact that this assumption was perfectly true and the fact that the elite was condemned by its superiority to a life of the most grinding toil would not be considered; the difference would.  The psychist finally put Barlow aboard the \"rocket\" with some thirty people--real people--headed for the Pole.         *       *       *       *       *  Barlow was airsick all the way because of a post-hypnotic suggestion Tinny-Peete had planted in him. One idea was to make him as averse as possible to a return trip, and another idea was to spare the other passengers from his aggressive, talkative company.  Barlow during the first day at the pole was reminded of his first day in the Army. It was the same now-where-the-hell-are-we-going-to-put-_you_? business until he took a firm line with them. Then instead of acting like supply sergeants they acted like hotel clerks.  It was a wonderful, wonderfully calculated buildup, and one that he failed to suspect. After all, in his time a visitor from the past would have been lionized.  At day's end he reclined in a snug underground billet with the 60-mile gales roaring yards overhead, and tried to put two and two together.  It was like old times, he thought--like a coup in real estate where you had the competition by the throat, like a 50-per cent rent boost when you knew damned well there was no place for the tenants to move, like smiling when you read over the breakfast orange juice that the city council had decided to build a school on the ground you had acquired by a deal with the city council. And it was simple. He would just sell tundra building lots to eagerly suicidal lemmings, and that was absolutely all there was to solving the Problem that had these double-domes spinning.  They'd have to work out most of the details, naturally, but what the hell, that was what subordinates were for. He'd need specialists in advertising, engineering, communications--did they know anything about hypnotism? That might be helpful. If not, there'd have to be a lot of bribery done, but he'd make sure--damned sure--there were unlimited funds.  Just selling building lots to lemmings....  He wished, as he fell asleep, that poor Verna could have been in on this. It was his biggest, most stupendous deal. Verna--that sharp shyster Sam Immerman must have swindled her....         *       *       *       *       *  It began the next day with people coming to visit him. He knew the approach. They merely wanted to be helpful to their illustrious visitor from the past and would he help fill them in about his era, which unfortunately was somewhat obscure historically, and what did he think could be done about the Problem? He told them he was too old to be roped any more, and they wouldn't get any information out of him until he got a letter of intent from at least the Polar President, and a session of the Polar Congress empowered to make him dictator.  He got the letter and the session. He presented his program, was asked whether his conscience didn't revolt at its callousness, explained succinctly that a deal was a deal and anybody who wasn't smart enough to protect himself didn't deserve protection--\"Caveat emptor,\" he threw in for scholarship, and had to translate it to \"Let the buyer beware.\" He didn't, he stated, give a damn about either the morons or their intelligent slaves; he'd told them his price and that was all he was interested in.  Would they meet it or wouldn't they?  The Polar President offered to resign in his favor, with certain temporary emergency powers that the Polar Congress would vote him if he thought them necessary. Barlow demanded the title of World Dictator, complete control of world finances, salary to be decided by himself, and the publicity campaign and historical writeup to begin at once.  \"As for the emergency powers,\" he added, \"they are neither to be temporary nor limited.\"  Somebody wanted the floor to discuss the matter, with the declared hope that perhaps Barlow would modify his demands.  \"You've got the proposition,\" Barlow said. \"I'm not knocking off even ten per cent.\"  \"But what if the Congress refuses, sir?\" the President asked.  \"Then you can stay up here at the Pole and try to work it out yourselves. I'll get what I want from the morons. A shrewd operator like me doesn't have to compromise; I haven't got a single"]]]
