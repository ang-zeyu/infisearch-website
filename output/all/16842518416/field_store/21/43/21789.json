I'm pretty ugly and I looked like a bum, but I was young. You had to grant me that.  She waved a hand at the rows of bound _News_ and left me alone with them. I wasn't sure if I was allowed to hunt up a table to lay the books on or not, so I took the volume for last year and laid it on the floor. That was the cleanest floor I ever saw.  It didn't take me long to find the story. The victim was a big man, because the story was on the second page of the Nov. 4 edition.  I started to tear the page out, then only memorized the name and home address. Somebody was sure to see me and I couldn't risk trouble just now.  I stuck the book back in line and left by the side door.         *       *       *       *       *  I went to a dry-cleaner, not the cheapest place I knew, because I wouldn't be safe with the change from a twenty in that neighborhood. My suit was cleaned while I waited. I paid a little extra and had it mended. Funny thing about a suit--it's almost never completely shot unless you just have it ripped off you or burned up. It wasn't exactly in style, but some rich executives wore suits out of style that they had paid a lot of money for. I remembered Fredric March's double-breasted in _Executive Suite_ while Walter Pidgeon and the rest wore Ivy Leagues. Maybe I would look like an eccentric executive.  I bought a new shirt, a good used pair of shoes, and a dime pack of single-edged razor blades. I didn't have a razor, but anybody with nerve can shave with a single-edge blade and soap and water.  The clerk took my two bucks in advance and I went up to my room.  I washed out my socks and underwear, took a bath, shaved and trimmed my hair and nails with the razor blade. With some soap on my finger, I scrubbed my teeth. Finally I got dressed.  Everything was all right except that I didn't have a tie. They had them, a quarter a piece, where I got the shoes. It was only six blocks--I could go back. But I didn't want to wait. I wanted to complete the picture.  The razor blade sliced through the pink bath towel evenly. I cut out a nice modern-style tie, narrow, with some horizontal stripes down at the bottom. I made a tight, thin knot. It looked pretty good.  I was ready to leave, so I started for the door. I went back. I had almost forgotten my luggage. The box still had three unwrapped blades in it. I pocketed it. I hefted the used blade, dulled by all the work it had done. You can run being economical into stinginess. I tossed it into the wastebasket.  I had five hamburgers and five cups of coffee. I couldn't finish all of the French fries.  \"Mac,\" I said to the fat counterman, who looked like all fat countermen, \"give me a Milwaukee beer.\"  He stopped polishing the counter in front of his friend. \"Milwaukee, Wisconsin, or Milwaukee, Oregon?\"  \"Wisconsin.\"  He didn't argue.  It was cold and bitter. All beer is bitter, no matter what they say on TV. I like beer. I like the bitterness of it.  It felt like another, but I checked myself. I needed a clear head. I thought about going back to the hotel for some sleep; I still had the key in my pocket (I wasn't trusting it to any clerk). No, I had had sleep on Thanksgiving, bracing up for trying the lift at Brother Partridge's. Let's see, it was daylight outside again, so this was the day after Thanksgiving. But it had only been sixteen or twenty hours since I had slept. That was enough.  I left the money on the counter for the hamburgers and coffee and the beer. There was $7.68 left.  As I passed the counterman's friend on his stool, my voice said, \"I think you're yellow.\"  He turned slowly, his jaw moving further away from his brain.  I winked. \"It was just a bet for me to say that to you. I won two bucks. Half of it is yours.\" I held out the bill to him.  His paw closed over the money and punched me on the biceps. Too hard. He winked back. \"It's okay.\"  I rubbed my shoulder, marching off fast, and I counted my money. With my luck, I might have given the counterman's friend the five instead of one of the singles. But I hadn't. I now had $6.68 left.  \"I _still_ think you're yellow,\" my voice said.  It was my voice, but it didn't come from me. There were no words, no feeling of words in my throat. It just came out of the air the way it always did.  I ran.         *       *       *       *       *  Harold R. Thompkins, 49, vice-president of Baysinger's, was found dead behind the store last night. His skull had been crushed by a vicious beating with a heavy implement, Coroner McClain announced in preliminary verdict. Tompkins, who resided at 1467 Claremont, Edgeway, had been active in seeking labor-management peace in the recent difficulties....  I had read that a year before. The car cards on the clanking subway and the rumbling bus didn't seem nearly so interesting to me. Outside the van, a tasteful sign announced the limits of the village of Edgeway, and back inside, the monsters of my boyhood went _bloomp_ at me.  I hadn't seen anything like them in years.  The slimy, scaly beasts were slithering over the newspaper holders, the ad card readers, the girl watchers as the neat little carbon-copy modern homes breezed past the windows.  I ignored the devils and concentrated on reading the withered, washed-out political posters on the telephone poles. My neck ached from holding it so stiff, staring out through the glass. More than that, I could feel the jabberwocks staring at me. You know how it is. You can feel a stare with the back of your neck and between your eyes. They got one brush of a gaze out of me.  The things abruptly started their business, trying to act casually as if they hadn't been waiting for me to look at them at all. They had a little human being of some sort.  It was the size of a small boy, like the small boy who looked like me that they used to destroy when I was locked up with them in the dark. Except this was a man, scaled down to child's size. He had sort of an ugly, worried, tired, stupid look and he wore a shiny suit with a piece of a welcome mat or something for a necktie. Yeah, it was me. I really knew it all the time.  They began doing things to the midget me. I didn't even lift an eyebrow. They couldn't do anything worse to the small man than they had done to the young boy. It was sort of nostalgic watching them, but I really got bored with all that violence and killing and killing the same kill over and over. Like watching the Saturday night string of westerns in a bar.  The sunlight through the window was yellow and hot. After a time, I began to dose.  The shrieks woke me up.  For the first time, I could hear the shrieks of the monster's victim and listen to their obscene droolings. For the very first time in my life. Always before it had been all pantomime, like Charlie Chaplin. Now I heard the sounds of it all.  They say it's a bad sign when you start hearing voices.  I nearly panicked, but I held myself in the seat and forced myself to be rational about it. My own voice was always saying things _everybody_ could hear but which I didn't say. It wasn't any worse to be the _only_ one who could hear other things I never said. I was as sane as I ever was. There was no doubt about that.  But a new thought suddenly impressed itself on me.  Whatever was punishing me for my sin was determined that I turn back before reaching 1467 Claremont.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Clrmnt,\" the driver announced, sending the doors hissing open and the bus cranking to a stop.  I walked through the gibbering monsters, and passing the driver's seat, I heard my voice say, \"Don't splatter me by starting up too soon, fat gut.\"  The driver looked at me with round eyes. \"No, sir, I won't.\"  The monsters gave it up and stopped existing.  The bus didn't start until I was halfway up the block of sandine moderns and desk-size patios.  Number 1423 was different from the other houses. It was on fire.  One of the most beautiful women I've ever seen came running up to me. What black hair, what red lips, what sparkling eyes she had when I finally got up that far! \"Sir,\" she said, \"my baby brother is in there. I'd be so grateful--\"  I grabbed for her. My hand went right on through. I didn't try grabbing her again. This time, I had a feeling I would feel her. I didn't want to be _that_ bad off.  I walked on, ignoring the flames shooting out of 1423.  As I reached the patio of 1467, the flames stopped. It was a queer kind of break. No fadeout, just a stoppage. I took a step backward. No flames this time, but the very worst and very biggest monster of them all. Coming suddenly like that, it got to my spine and stomach, even though I was pretty used to them. I stepped away from it and it was gone.  Number 1467 was different from the other houses, and it wasn't even on fire. It was on two lots, and it had two picture windows, but only one little porch and front door. I guess even the well-to-do have a hard time finding big houses and good building sites and the right neighborhood. The trouble is so many people are well-to-do and there just aren't enough old manses to go around.  I strolled up the stucco path and lifted the wrought-iron knocker, which rang a bell.  The door opened and there was a girl there. She wasn't much compared to the one I put my hand through. But she was all right--brown hair, a nice face underneath the current shades of cosmetics, no figure for a stripper, but it would pass.  \"You the maid?\" I inquired.  \"I am Miss Tompkins,\" she said.  \"Oh. Any relation to Harold J. Tompkins?\"  \"My father. He died last year.\"  \"Can I see your mother?\"  \"Mother died a few months after Daddy did.\"  \"You'll do then.\"  I stepped inside. Miss Tompkins seemed too surprised to protest.  \"I'm William Hagle,\" I said. \"I want to help you.\"  \"Mr. Hagle, whatever it is--insurance--\"  \"That's not it exactly,\" I told her. \"I just want to help you. I only want to do whatever you want me to do.\"  She stared at me, her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51657"],["title","Charity Case (#3)"],["body","moving too quickly over my face. \"I've never even seen you before, have I? Why do you want to help me? How?\"  \"What's so damned hard to understand? I just want to help. I don't have any money, but I can work and give you my pay. You want me to clean up the basement, the yard? Got any painting to be done? Hell, I can even sew. Anything--don't you understand--I'll do _anything_ for you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The girl was breathing too hard now. \"Mr. Hagle, if you're hungry, I can find something--no, I don't think there is anything. But I can give you some money to--\"  \"Damn it, I don't want your money! Here, I'll give you mine!\" I wadded up the $6.38 cents I had left, plus one bus transfer, and put it on the top of a little bookcase next to the door. \"I know it doesn't mean anything to you, but it's every penny I've got. Can't I do anything for you? Empty the garbage--\"  \"We have a disposal,\" she said automatically.  \"Scrub the floors.\"  \"There's a polisher in the closet.\"  \"Make the beds!\" I yelled. \"You don't have a machine for _that_, do you?\"  The corners of Miss Tompkins' eyes drew up and the corners of her mouth drew down. She stayed like that for a full second, then smiled a strange smile. \"You--you saw me on the street.\" She was breathing her words now, so softly that I could only just understand them. \"You thought I was--stacked.\"  \"To tell the truth, ma'am, you aren't so--\"  \"Well, sit down. Don't go away. I'll just go into the next room--slip into something comfortable--\"  \"Miss Tompkins!\" I grabbed hold of her. She felt real. I hoped she was. \"I want nothing from you. Nothing! I only want to do something for you, anything for you. I've got to help you, can't you understand? I KILLED YOUR FATHER.\"  I hadn't meant to tell her that, of course.  She screamed and began twisting and clawing the way I knew she would as soon as I said it. But she stopped, stunned, as if I'd slapped her out of hysterics, only I'd never let go of her shoulders.  She hung then, her face empty, repeating, \"What? _What?_\"  Finally she began laughing and she pulled away from me so gently and naturally that I had to let go. She sank down and sat on top of my money on the little bookcase. She laughed some more into her two open hands.  I stood there, not knowing what to do with myself.  She looked up at me and brushed away a few tears with her fingertips. \"_You_ want to get _me_ off of your conscience, do you, William Hagle? God, that's a good one.\" She reached out and took my hand in hers. \"Come along down into the basement, William. I want to show you something. Afterward, if you want to--if you really want to--you may kill me.\"  \"Thanks,\" I said.  I couldn't think of anything else to say.         *       *       *       *       *  Down in the basement, the machinery looked complex, with all sorts of thermostats and speedometers.  \"Automatic stoker?\" I asked.  \"Time machine,\" she said.  \"You don't mean a time machine like H. G. Wells's,\" I said, to show her I wasn't ignorant.  \"Not exactly like that, but close,\" she answered sadly. \"This has been the cause of all your trouble, William.\"  \"It has?\"  \"Yes. This house and the ground around it are the Primary Focus area for the Hexers. The Hexers have tormented and persecuted you all your life. They got you into trouble. They made you think you were going crazy--\"  \"I never thought I was going crazy!\" I yelled at her.  \"That must have made it worse,\" she said miserably.  I thought about it. \"I suppose it did. What are the Hexers? What--for the sake of argument--have they got against me?\"  \"The Hexers aren't human. I suppose they are extraterrestrials. No one ever told me. Maybe they are a kind of human strain that went different. I don't really know. They want different things than we do, but they can buy some of them with money, so they can be hired. People in the future hire them to hex people in the past.\"  \"Why would anybody up ahead there with Buck Rogers want to cause me trouble? I'm dead then, aren't I?\"  \"Yes, you must be. It's a long time into the future. But, you see, some of my relatives there want to punish you for--it must be for killing Father. They lost out on a chain of inheritance because he died when he did. They have money now, but they are bitter because they had to make it themselves. They can afford every luxury--even the luxury of revenge.\"  I suppose when you keep seeing monsters and hearing yourself say things you didn't say, you can believe unusual things easier. I believed Miss Tompkins.  \"It was not murder,\" I said. \"I killed him by accident.\"  \"No matter. They would hex you if you had hit him with a car in a fog or given him the flu by sneezing in his face. I understand people are hexed all the time for things they never even knew they did. People up there have a lot of leisure, a lot of time to indulge their every irritation or hate. I think it must be decadent, the way Rome was.\"  \"What do you--and the machine--have to do with my hex?\" I asked.  \"This is the Primary Focus area, I told you. It's how the Hexers get into this time hypothesis. They can't get back into this Primary itself, but they can come and go through the outer boundary. It's hard to set up a Primary Focus--takes a tremendous drain of power. They broke through into the basement of the old house before I was born and Daddy was the first custodian of the machine. He never knew that he was helping avenge his own death. They let that slip later, after--it happened.\"  \"Why did they come to you? Why did you help them?\"  She turned half away. \"The custodian is well paid. My relatives preferred the salary to go to someone in the family, instead of an outsider. Daddy accepted the offer and I've carried on the job.\"  \"Paid? You were paid?\"  She brushed at her eyes. \"Oh, not in United States currency. But--Daddy got to be president of the store. It was set up so he could make a fortune that they could inherit. All he left was his insurance, and that went to mother. She died a few months later and some of it went to me and the rest to her relatives.\"  \"You mean my life has been like it has because some descendants of yours in the future hate me for an accident that deprived them of some money?\"         *       *       *       *       *  She nodded enthusiastically. \"You understand! And because I helped the Hexers they hired get to you. I was afraid you wouldn't believe me. Now\"--she stopped to exhale--\"do you want to kill me?\"  \"No, I don't want to kill you.\" I walked over and squinted at the machine. \"Could _I_ get into the future with this thing?\"  \"I don't know how you work the outer boundary. I think you need something else. There's an internal energy contact--you can talk to Communications.\" She raced through that. \"You want to kill _them_, don't you? The Hexers and my relatives?\"  \"I don't want to kill anybody,\" I told her patiently. \"I feel dirty just hearing how far some people can go for revenge. I just want them to let me alone. Why don't they kill me and get it over with?\"  \"They haven't a license to kill. Not yet. There's legislation going on.\"  \"Listen,\" I said, listening to the idea coming into my head, \"_listen_. These descendants of your mother's relatives--they _did_ inherit money because your father died. Maybe they feel grateful to me. Maybe they would help me. Would you help me try to talk to them?\"  \"Yes,\" Miss Tompkins said, and she used a dial on the machine.  It was as simple as putting through a phone call.  \"We really understand your situation,\" Mr. Grimes-Tompkins said. \"But it would take quite a bit to buy off the Hexers. However, we certainly appreciate the killing you made for us.\"  \"Couldn't you buy off the Hexers, then, with some of the money I brought to your side of the family?\" I asked.  \"We don't appreciate it _that_ much.\"  \"What? You aren't going to pay him back for killing my father?\" Miss Tompkins cried, outraged.  \"Look,\" I said, \"if you had some money of mine, would you pay off the Hexers for me? You do still use money up there, don't you?\"  \"We certainly do, young man. Just what did you have in mind?\"  \"If I gave you authorization now to use any assets I have in your time, would it be legal?\"  \"Declarations by temporal transmission? Yes, of course. Routine transaction.\"  \"Take any money I have and use it to pay off the Hexers. Will you do it?\"  \"I don't see why not, since our ancestor seems to approve.\"  Miss Tompkins regarded me solemnly. \"What do you intend to do, William?\"  \"Banks are out,\" I said, thinking hard. \"They don't let inactive accounts go on drawing interest more than twenty years, or something like that. But government bonds don't have to be converted when they mature. One bond can pile up a fantastic amount of interest for them to collect.\"  \"You have government bonds, William?\"  \"Not yet.\"  Miss Tompkins stood close to me. \"I have plenty of money, William. I'll give it to you. You can buy bonds in my name.\"  \"No. I'll get my own money.\"  \"Shall I destroy the machine, William? Of course they'll only open another Focus--\"  \"No, you would just get yourself hexed too.\"  \"What can I do, William?\" she asked. \"All along, ever since I was a little girl, I've known I've been helping to torture somebody. I didn't even know your name, William, but I helped torture you--\"  \"Because I killed your father.\"  \"--and I've got to make it up to you. I'll give you everything, William, everything.\"  \"Sure,\" I said, \"to take me off your conscience. And if I take your offer and you get hexed, what happens to my conscience? Do we go around again--me working my tail off to raise the dough to get you unhexed, and you buying the Hexers off me? Where would it stop? We're even right now. Let's let it go at that.\"  \"But, William, if we've taken, now we can give to each other.\"  She looked almost pretty then, and I wanted her the way I'd always wanted women. But I knew better. She wasn't going to get me into any trouble.  \"No, thanks. Good-by.\"  "]]]
