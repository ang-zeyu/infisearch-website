Murra Foray, however, was a Huntner, which meant hunter--a descendant of incredibly strong carnivores.  He didn't have a chance. He knew that when he couldn't budge her hands and he fell into the airless blackness of space.         *       *       *       *       *  Alone and naked, Cassal awakened. He wished he hadn't. He turned over and, though he tried hard not to, promptly woke up again. His body was willing to sleep, but his mind was panicked and disturbed. About what, he wasn't sure.  He sat up shakily and held his roaring head in his hands. He ran aching fingers through his hair. He stopped. The lump behind his ear was gone.  \"Dimanche!\" he called, and looked at his abdomen.  There was a thin scar, healing visibly before his eyes.  \"Dimanche!\" he cried again. \"Dimanche!\"  There was no answer. Dimanche was no longer with him.  He staggered to his feet and stared at the wall. She'd been kind enough to return him to his own rooms. At length he gathered enough strength to rummage through his belongings. Nothing was missing. Money, identification--all were there.  He could go to the police. He grimaced as he thought of it. The neighborly Godolphian police were hardly a match for the Huntner; she'd fake them out of their skins.  He couldn't prove she'd taken Dimanche. Nothing else normally considered valuable was missing. Besides, there might even be a local prohibition against Dimanche. Not by name, of course; but they could dig up an ancient ordinance--invasion of privacy or something like that. Anything would do if it gave them an opportunity to confiscate the device for intensive study.  For the police to believe his story was the worst that could happen. They might locate Dimanche, but he'd never get it.  He smiled bitterly and the effort hurt. \"Dear,\" she had called him as she had strangled and beaten him into unconsciousness. Afterward singing, very likely, as she had sliced the little instrument out of him.  He could picture her not very remote ancestors springing from cover and overtaking a fleeing herd--  No use pursuing that line of thought.  Why did she want Dimanche? She had hinted that the agency wasn't always concerned with legality as such. He could believe her. If she wanted it for making identification tabs, she'd soon find that it was useless. Not that that was much comfort--she wasn't likely to return Dimanche after she'd made that discovery.         *       *       *       *       *  For that matter, what was the purpose of Travelers Aid Bureau? It was a front for another kind of activity. Philanthropy had nothing to do with it.  If he still had possession of Dimanche, he'd be able to find out. Everything seemed to hinge on that. With it, he was nearly a superman, able to hold his own in practically all situations--anything that didn't involve a Huntner woman, that is.  Without it--well, Tunney 21 was still far away. Even if he should manage to get there without it, his mission on the planet was certain to fail.  He dismissed the idea of trying to recover it immediately from Murra Foray. She was an audio-sensitive. At twenty feet, unaided, she could hear a heartbeat, the internal noise muscles made in sliding over each other. With Dimanche, she could hear electrons rustling. As an antagonist she was altogether too formidable.         *       *       *       *       *  He began pulling on his clothing, wincing as he did so. The alternative was to make another Dimanche. _If_ he could. It would be a tough job even for a neuronic expert familiar with the process. He wasn't that expert, but it still had to be done.  The new instrument would have to be better than the original. Maybe not such a slick machine, but more comprehensive. More wallop. He grinned as he thought hopefully about giving Murra Foray a surprise.  Ignoring his aches and pains, he went right to work. With money not a factor, it was an easy matter to line up the best electronic and neuron concerns on Godolph. Two were put on a standby basis. When he gave them plans, they were to rush construction at all possible speed.  Each concern was to build a part of the new instrument. Neither part was of value without the other. The slow-thinking Godolphians weren't likely to make the necessary mental connection between the seemingly unrelated projects.  He retired to his suite and began to draw diagrams. It was harder than he thought. He knew the principles, but the actual details were far more complicated than he remembered.  Functionally, the Dimanche instrument was divided into three main phases. There was a brain and memory unit that operated much as the human counterpart did. Unlike the human brain, however, it had no body to control, hence more of it was available for thought processes. Entirely neuronic in construction, it was far smaller than an electronic brain of the same capacity.  The second function was electronic, akin to radar. Instead of material objects, it traced and recorded distant nerve impulses. It could count the heartbeat, measure the rate of respiration, was even capable of approximate analysis of the contents of the bloodstream. Properly focused on the nerves of tongue, lips or larynx, it transmitted that data back to the neuronic brain, which then reconstructed it into speech. Lip reading, after a fashion, carried to the ultimate.  Finally, there was the voice of Dimanche, a speaker under the control of the neuronic brain.  For convenience of installation in the body, Dimanche was packaged in two units. The larger package was usually surgeried into the abdomen. The small one, containing the speaker, was attached to the skull just behind the ear. It worked by bone conduction, allowing silent communication between operator and instrument. A real convenience.  It wasn't enough to know this, as Cassal did. He'd talked to the company experts, had seen the symbolical drawings, the plans for an improved version. He needed something better than the best though, that had been planned.  The drawback was this: _Dimanche was powered directly by the nervous system of the body in which it was housed_. Against Murra Foray, he'd be over-matched. She was stronger than he physically, probably also in the production of nervous energy.  One solution was to make available to the new instrument a larger fraction of the neural currents of the body. That was dangerous--a slight miscalculation and the user was dead. Yet he had to have an instrument that would overpower her.  Cassal rubbed his eyes wearily. How could he find some way of supplying additional power?  Abruptly, Cassal sat up. That was the way, of course--an auxiliary power pack that need not be surgeried into his body, extra power that he would use only in emergencies.  Neuronics, Inc., had never done this, had never thought that such an instrument would ever be necessary. They didn't need to overpower their customers. They merely wanted advance information via subvocalized thoughts.  It was easier for Cassal to conceive this idea than to engineer it. At the end of the first day, he knew it would be a slow process.  Twice he postponed deadlines to the manufacturing concerns he'd engaged. He locked himself in his rooms and took Anti-Sleep against the doctor's vigorous protests. In one week he had the necessary drawings, crude but legible. An expert would have to make innumerable corrections, but the intent was plain.  One week. During that time Murra Foray would be growing hourly more proficient in the use of Dimanche.         *       *       *       *       *  Cassal followed the neuronics expert groggily, seventy-two hours sleep still clogging his reactions. Not that he hadn't needed sleep after that week. The Godolphian showed him proudly through the shops, though he wasn't at all interested in their achievements. The only noteworthy aspect was the grand scale of their architecture.  \"We did it, though I don't think we'd have taken the job if we'd known how hard it was going to be,\" the neuronics expert chattered. \"It works exactly as you specified. We had to make substitutions, of course, but you understand that was inevitable.\"  He glanced anxiously at Cassal, who nodded. That was to be expected. Components that were common on Earth wouldn't necessarily be available here. Still, any expert worth his pay could always make the proper combinations and achieve the same results.  Inside the lab, Cassal frowned. \"I thought you were keeping my work separate. What is this planetary drive doing here?\"  The Godolphian spread his broad hands and looked hurt. \"Planetary drive?\" He tried to laugh. \"This is the instrument you ordered!\"  Cassal started. It was supposed to fit under a flap of skin behind his ear. A Three World saurian couldn't carry it.  He turned savagely on the expert. \"I told you it had to be small.\"  \"But it is. I quote your orders exactly: 'I'm not familiar with your system of measurement, but make it tiny, very tiny. Figure the size you think it will have to be and cut it in half. And then cut _that_ in half.' This is the fraction remaining.\"  It certainly was. Cassal glanced at the Godolphian's hands. Excellent for swimming. No wonder they built on a grand scale. Broad, blunt, webbed hands weren't exactly suited for precision work.  Valueless. Completely valueless. He knew now what he would find at the other lab. He shook his head in dismay, personally saw to it that the instrument was destroyed. He paid for the work and retrieved the plans.  Back in his rooms again, he sat and thought. It was still the only solution. If the Godolphians couldn't do it, he'd have to find some race that could. He grabbed the intercom and jangled it savagely. In half an hour he had a dozen leads.  The best seemed to be the Spirella. A small, insectlike race, about three feet tall, they were supposed to have excellent manual dexterity, and were technically advanced. They"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50998"],["title","Delay in Transit (#8)"],["body","as if they were acquainted with the necessary fields. Three light-years away, they could be reached by readily available local transportation within the day. Their idea of what was small was likely to coincide with his.  He didn't bother to pack. The suite would remain his headquarters. Home was where his enemies were.  He made a mental correction--enemy.         *       *       *       *       *  He rubbed his sensitive ear, grateful for the discomfort. His stomach was sore, but it wouldn't be for long. The Spirella had made the new instrument just as he had wanted it. They had built an even better auxiliary power unit than he had specified. He fingered the flat cases in his pocket. In an emergency, he could draw on these, whereas Murra Foray would be limited to the energy in her nervous system.  What he had now was hardly the same instrument. A Military version of it, perhaps. It didn't seem right to use the same name. Call it something staunch and crisp, suggestive of raw power. Manche. As good a name as any. Manche against Dimanche. Cassal against a queen.  He swung confidently along the walkway beside the transport tide. It was raining. He decided to test the new instrument. The Godolphian across the way bent double and wondered why his knees wouldn't work. They had suddenly become swollen and painful to move. Maybe it was the climate.  And maybe it wasn't, thought Cassal. Eventually the pain would leave, but he hadn't meant to be so rough on the native. He'd have to watch how he used Manche.  He scouted the vicinity of Travelers Aid Bureau, keeping at least one building between him and possible detection. Purely precautionary. There was no indication that Murra Foray had spotted him. For a Huntner, she wasn't very alert, apparently.  He sent Manche out on exploration at minimum strength. The electronic guards which Dimanche had spoken of were still in place. Manche went through easily and didn't disturb an electron. Behind the guards there was no trace of the first counselor.  He went closer. Still no warning of danger. The same old technician shuffled in front of the entrance. A horrible thought hit him. It was easy enough to verify. Another \"reorganization\" _had_ taken place. The new sign read:                         STAR TRAVELERS AID BUREAU                             STAB _Your Hour                                of Need_                    Delly Mortinbras, first counselor  Cassal leaned against the building, unable to understand what it was that frightened and bewildered him. Then it gradually became, if not clear, at least not quite so muddy.  STAB was the word that had been printed on the card in the money clip that his assailant in the alley had left behind. Cassal had naturally interpreted it as an order to the thug. It wasn't, of course.  The first time Cassal had visited the Travelers Aid Bureau, it had been in the process of reorganization. The only purpose of the reorganization, he realized now, had been to change the name so he wouldn't translate the word on the slip into the original initials of the Bureau.  Now it probably didn't matter any more whether or not he knew, so the name had been changed back to Star Travelers Aid Bureau--STAB.  That, he saw bitterly, was why Murra Foray had been so positive that the identification tab he'd made with the aid of Dimanche had been a forgery.  _She had known the man who robbed Cassal of the original one, perhaps had even helped him plan the theft._         *       *       *       *       *  That didn't make sense to Cassal. Yet it had to. He'd suspected the organization of being a racket, but it obviously wasn't. By whatever name it was called, it actually was dedicated to helping the stranded traveler. The question was--which travelers?  There must be agency operatives at the spaceport, checking every likely prospect who arrived, finding out where they were going, whether their papers were in order. Then, just as had happened to Cassal, the prospect was robbed of his papers so somebody stranded here could go on to that destination!  The shabby, aging technician finished changing the last door sign and hobbled over to Cassal. He peered through the rain and darkness.  \"You stuck here, too?\" he quavered.  \"No,\" said Cassal with dignity, shaky dignity. \"I'm not stuck. I'm here because I want to be.\"  \"You're crazy,\" declared the old man. \"I remember--\"  Cassal didn't wait to find out what it was he remembered. An impossible land, perhaps, a planet which swings in perfect orbit around an ideal sun. A continent which reared a purple mountain range to hold up a honey sky. People with whom anyone could relax easily and without worry or anxiety. In short, his own native world from which, at night, all the constellations were familiar.  Somehow, Cassal managed to get back to his suite, tumbled wearily onto his bed. The show-down wasn't going to take place.  Everyone connected with the agency--including Murra Foray--had been \"stuck here\" for one reason or another: no identification tab, no money, whatever it was. That was the staff of the Bureau, a pack of desperate castaways. The \"philanthropy\" extended to them and nobody else. They grabbed their tabs and money from the likeliest travelers, leaving them marooned here--and they in turn had to join the Bureau and use the same methods to continue their journeys through the Galaxy.  It was an endless belt of stranded travelers robbing and stranding other travelers, who then had to rob and strand still others, and so on and on....         *       *       *       *       *  Cassal didn't have a chance of catching up with Murra Foray. She had used the time--and Dimanche--to create her own identification tab and escape. She was going back to Kettikat, home of the Huntners, must already be light-years away.  Or was she? The signs on the Bureau had just been changed. Perhaps the ship was still in the spaceport, or cruising along below the speed of light. He shrugged defeatedly. It would do him no good; he could never get on board.  He got up suddenly on one elbow. He couldn't, but Manche could! Unlike his old instrument, it could operate at tremendous distances, its power no longer dependent only on his limited nervous energy.  With calculated fury, he let Manche strike out into space.  \"There you are!\" exclaimed Murra Foray. \"I thought you could do it.\"  \"Did you?\" he asked coldly. \"Where are you now?\"  \"Leaving the atmosphere, if you can call the stuff around this planet an atmosphere.\"  \"It's not the atmosphere that's bad,\" he said as nastily as he could. \"It's the philanthropy.\"  \"Please don't feel that way,\" she appealed. \"Huntners are rather unusual people, I admit, but sometimes even we need help. I had to have Dimanche and I took it.\"  \"At the risk of killing me.\"  Her amusement was strange; it held a sort of sadness. \"I didn't hurt you. I couldn't. You were too cute, like a--well, the animal native to Kettikat that would be called a teddy bear on Earth. A cute, lovable teddy bear.\"  \"Teddy bear,\" he repeated, really stung now. \"Careful. This one may have claws.\"  \"Long claws? Long enough to reach from here to Kettikat?\" She was laughing, but it sounded thin and wistful.  Manche struck out at Cassal's unspoken command. The laughter was canceled.  \"Now you've done it,\" said Dimanche. \"She's out cold.\"  There was no reason for remorse; it was strange that he felt it. His throat was dry.  \"So you, too, can communicate with me. Through Manche, of course. I built a wonderful instrument, didn't I?\"  \"A fearful one,\" said Dimanche sternly. \"She's unconscious.\"  \"I heard you the first time.\" Cassal hesitated. \"Is she dead?\"  Dimanche investigated. \"Of course not. A little thing like that wouldn't hurt her. Her nerve system is marvelous. I think it could carry current for a city. Beautiful!\"  \"I'm aware of the beauty,\" said Cassal.         *       *       *       *       *  An awkward silence followed. Dimanche broke it. \"Now that I know the facts, I'm proud to be her chosen instrument. Her need was greater than yours.\"  Cassal growled, \"As first counselor, she had access to every--\"  \"Don't interrupt with your half truths,\" said Dimanche. \"Huntners _are_ special; their brain structure, too. Not necessarily better, just different. Only the auditory and visual centers of their brains resemble that of man. You can guess the results of even superficial tampering with those parts of her mind. And stolen identification would involve lobotomy.\"  He could imagine? Cassal shook his head. No, he couldn't. A blinded and deaf Murra Foray would not go back to the home of the Huntners. According to her racial conditioning, a sightless young tiger should creep away and die.  Again there was silence. \"No, she's not pretending unconsciousness,\" announced Dimanche. \"For a moment I thought--but never mind.\"  The conversation was lasting longer than he expected. The ship must be obsolete and slow. There were still a few things he wanted to find out, if there was time.  \"When are you going on Drive?\" he asked.  \"We've been on it for some time,\" answered Dimanche.  \"Repeat that!\" said Cassal, stunned.  \"I said that we've been on faster-than-light drive for some time. Is there anything wrong with that?\"  Nothing wrong with that at all. Theoretically, there was only one means of communicating with a ship hurtling along faster than light, and that way hadn't been invented.  _Hadn't been until he had put together the instrument he called Manche._  Unwittingly, he had created far more than he intended. He ought to have felt elated.  Dimanche interrupted his thoughts. \"I suppose you know what she thinks of you.\"  \"She made it plain enough,\" said Cassal wearily. \"A teddy bear. A brainless, childish toy.\"  \"Among the Huntners, women are vigorous and aggressive,\" said Dimanche. The voice grew weaker as the ship, already light-years away, slid into unfathomable distances. \"Where words are concerned, morals are very strict. For instance, 'dea"]]]
