What would he want here?\"  Levier's eyebrows arched. \"He holds a little stock. He has entree. But he's late.\" Levier's lips quirked. \"It must have taken him some time to get that makeup on.\"  \"Not in good taste, is it?\"  \"Look for yourself.\"  \"Oh, I'll do better than that,\" Sollenar said. \"I'll go and talk to him a while. Excuse me, Levier.\" And only then did he turn around, already started on his first pace toward the man.         *       *       *       *       *  But Cortwright Burr was only a pasteboard imitation of himself as Sollenar had come to know him. He stood to one side of the doorway, dressed in black and crimson robes, with black leather gauntlets on his hands, carrying a staff of weathered, natural wood. His face was shadowed by a sackcloth hood, the eyes well hidden. His face was powdered gray, and some blend of livid colors hollowed his cheeks. He stood motionless as Sollenar came up to him.  As he had crossed the floor, each step regular, the eyes of bystanders had followed Sollenar, until, anticipating his course, they found Burr waiting. The noise level of the Ball shrank perceptibly, for the lesser revelers who chanced to be present were sustaining it all alone. The people who really mattered here were silent and watchful.  The thought was that Burr, defeated in business, had come here in some insane reproach to his adversary, in this lugubrious, distasteful clothing. Why, he looked like a corpse. Or worse.  The question was, what would Sollenar say to him? The wish was that Burr would take himself away, back to his estates or to some other city. New York was no longer for Cortwright Burr. But what would Sollenar say to him now, to drive him back to where he hadn't the grace to go willingly?  \"Cortwright,\" Sollenar said in a voice confined to the two of them. \"So your Martian immortality works.\"  Burr said nothing.  \"You got that in addition, didn't you? You knew how I'd react. You knew you'd need protection. Paid the Martians to make you physically invulnerable? It's a good system. Very impressive. Who would have thought the Martians knew so much? But who here is going to pay attention to you now? Get out of town, Cortwright. You're past your chance. You're dead as far as these people are concerned--all you have left is your skin.\"  Burr reached up and surreptitiously lifted a corner of his fleshed mask. And there he was, under it. The hood retreated an inch, and the light reached his eyes; and Sollenar had been wrong, Burr had less left than he thought.  \"Oh, no, no, Cortwright,\" Sollenar said softly. \"No, you're right--I can't stand up to that.\"  He turned and bowed to the assembled company. \"Good night!\" he cried, and walked out of the ballroom.  Someone followed him down the corridor to the elevators. Sollenar did not look behind him.  \"I have another appointment with you now,\" Ermine said at his elbow.         *       *       *       *       *  They reached the pedestrian level. Sollenar said: \"There's a cafe. We can talk there.\"  \"Too public, Mr. Sollenar. Let's simply stroll and converse.\" Ermine lightly took his arm and guided him along the walkway. Sollenar noticed then that Ermine was costumed so cunningly that no one could have guessed the appearance of the man.  \"Very well,\" Sollenar said.  \"Of course.\"  They walked together, casually. Ermine said: \"Burr's driving you to your death. Is it because you tried to kill him earlier? Did you get his Martian secret?\"  Sollenar shook his head.  \"You didn't get it.\" Ermine sighed. \"That's unfortunate. I'll have to take steps.\"  \"Under the By-Laws,\" Sollenar said, \"I cry _laissez faire_.\"  Ermine looked up, his eyes twinkling. \"_Laissez faire?_ Mr. Sollenar, do you have any idea how many of our members are involved in your fortunes? _They_ will cry _laissez faire_, Mr. Sollenar, but clearly you persist in dragging them down with you. No, sir, Mr. Sollenar, my office now forwards an immediate recommendation to the Technical Advisory Committee of the IAB that Mr. Burr probably has a system superior to yours, and that stock in Sollenar, Incorporated, had best be disposed of.\"  \"There's a bench,\" Sollenar said. \"Let's sit down.\"  \"As you wish.\" Ermine moved beside Sollenar to the bench, but remained standing.  \"What is it, Mr. Sollenar?\"  \"I want your help. You advised me on what Burr had. It's still in his office building, somewhere. You have resources. We can get it.\"  \"_Laissez faire_, Mr. Sollenar. I visited you in an advisory capacity. I can do no more.\"  \"For a partnership in my affairs could you do more?\"  \"Money?\" Ermine tittered. \"For me? Do you know the conditions of my employment?\"         *       *       *       *       *  If he had thought, Sollenar would have remembered. He reached out tentatively. Ermine anticipated him.  Ermine bared his left arm and sank his teeth into it. He displayed the arm. There was no quiver of pain in voice or stance. \"It's not a legend, Mr. Sollenar. It's quite true. We of our office must spend a year, after the nerve surgery, learning to walk without the feel of our feet, to handle objects without crushing them or letting them slip, or damaging ourselves. Our mundane pleasures are auditory, olfactory, and visual. Easily gratified at little expense. Our dreams are totally interior, Mr. Sollenar. The operation is irreversible. What would you buy for me with your money?\"  \"What would I buy for myself?\" Sollenar's head sank down between his shoulders.  Ermine bent over him. \"Your despair is your own, Mr. Sollenar. I have official business with you.\"  He lifted Sollenar's chin with a forefinger. \"I judge physical interference to be unwarranted at this time. But matters must remain so that the IAB members involved with you can recover the value of their investments in EV. Is that perfectly clear, Mr. Sollenar? You are hereby enjoined under the By-Laws, as enforced by the Special Public Relations Office.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Notice was served at 1:27 AM, City time.\"  \"1:27,\" Sollenar said. \"City time.\" He sprang to his feet and raced down a companionway to the taxi level.  Mr. Ermine watched him quizzically.  He opened his costume, took out his omnipresent medical kit, and sprayed coagulant over the wound in his forearm. Replacing the kit, he adjusted his clothing and strolled down the same companionway Sollenar had run. He raised an arm, and a taxi flittered down beside him. He showed the driver a card, and the cab lifted off with him, its lights glaring in a Priority pattern, far faster than Sollenar's ordinary legal limit allowed.   IV  Long Island Facility vaulted at the stars in great kangaroo-leaps of arch and cantilever span, jeweled in glass and metal as if the entire port were a mechanism for navigating interplanetary space. Rufus Sollenar paced its esplanades, measuring his steps, holding his arms still, for the short time until he could board the Mars rocket.  Erect and majestic, he took a place in the lounge and carefully sipped liqueur, once the liner had boosted away from Earth and coupled in its Faraday main drives.  Mr. Ermine settled into the place beside him.  Sollenar looked over at him calmly. \"I thought so.\"  Ermine nodded. \"Of course you did. But I didn't almost miss you. I was here ahead of you. I have no objection to your going to Mars, Mr. Sollenar. _Laissez faire._ Provided I can go along.\"  \"Well,\" Rufus Sollenar said. \"Liqueur?\" He gestured with his glass.  Ermine shook his head. \"No, thank you,\" he said delicately.  Sollenar said: \"Even your tongue?\"  \"Of course my tongue, Mr. Sollenar. I taste nothing. I touch nothing.\" Ermine smiled. \"But I feel no pressure.\"  \"All right, then,\" Rufus Sollenar said crisply. \"We have several hours to landing time. You sit and dream your interior dreams, and I'll dream mine.\" He faced around in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.  \"Mr. Sollenar,\" Ermine said gently.  \"Yes?\"  \"I am once again with you by appointment as provided under the By-Laws.\"  \"State your business, Mr. Ermine.\"  \"You are not permitted to lie in an unknown grave, Mr. Sollenar. Insurance policies on your life have been taken out at a high premium rate. The IAB members concerned cannot wait the statutory seven years to have you declared dead. Do what you will, Mr. Sollenar, but I must take care I witness your death. From now on, I am with you wherever you go.\"  Sollenar smiled. \"I don't intend to die. Why should I die, Mr. Ermine?\"  \"I have no idea, Mr. Sollenar. But I know Cortwright Burr's character. And isn't that he, seated there in the corner? The light is poor, but I think he's recognizable.\"  Across the lounge, Burr raised his head and looked into Sollenar's eyes. He raised a hand near his face, perhaps merely to signify greeting. Rufus Sollenar faced front.  \"A worthy opponent, Mr. Sollenar,\" Ermine said. \"A persevering, unforgiving, ingenious man. And yet--\" Ermine seemed a little touched by bafflement. \"And yet it seems to me, Mr. Sollenar, that he got you running rather easily. What _did_ happen between you, after my advisory call?\"  Sollenar turned a terrible smile on Ermine. \"I shot him to pieces. If you'd peel his face, you'd see.\"  Ermine sighed. \"Up to this moment, I had thought perhaps you might still salvage your affairs.\"  \"Pity, Mr. Ermine? Pity for the insane?\"  \"Interest. I can take no part in your world. Be grateful, Mr. Sollenar. I am not the same gullible man I was when I signed my contract with IAB, so many years ago.\"  Sollenar laughed. Then he stole a glance at Burr's corner.         *       *       *       *       *  The ship came down at Abernathy Field, in Aresia, the Terrestrial city. Industrialized, prefabricated, jerry-built and clamorous, the storm-proofed buildings huddled, but huddled proudly, at the desert's edge.

Sollenar had been to Mars--on a tour. He had seen the natives in their nameless dwelling place; arrogant, venomous and weak. He had been told, by the paid guide, they trafficked with Earthmen as much as they cared to, and kept to their place on the rim of Earth's encroachment, observing.  \"Tell me, Ermine,\" Sollenar said quietly as they walked across the terminal lobby. \"You're to kill me, aren't you, if I try to go on without you?\"  \"A matter of procedure, Mr. Sollenar,\" Ermine said evenly. \"We cannot risk the investment capital of so many IAB members.\"  Sollenar sighed. \"If I were any other member, how I would commend you, Mr. Ermine! Can we hire a car for ourselves, then, somewhere nearby?\"  \"Going out to see the engineers?\" Ermine asked. \"Who would have thought they'd have something valuable for sale?\"  \"I want to show them something,\" Sollenar said.  \"What thing, Mr. Sollenar?\"  They turned the corner of a corridor, with branching hallways here and there, not all of them busy. \"Come here,\" Sollenar said, nodding toward one of them.  They stopped out of sight of the lobby and the main corridor. \"Come on,\" Sollenar said. \"A little further.\"  \"No,\" Ermine said. \"This is farther than I really wish. It's dark here.\"  \"Wise too late, Mr. Ermine,\" Sollenar said, his arms flashing out.  One palm impacted against Ermine's solar plexus, and the other against the muscle at the side of his neck, but not hard enough to kill. Ermine collapsed, starved for oxygen, while Sollenar silently cursed having been cured of murder. Then Sollenar turned and ran.  Behind him Ermine's body struggled to draw breath by reflex alone.  Moving as fast as he dared, Sollenar walked back and reached the taxi lock, pulling a respirator from a wall rack as he went. He flagged a car and gave his destination, looking behind him. He had seen nothing of Cortwright Burr since setting foot on Mars. But he knew that soon or late, Burr would find him.  A few moments later Ermine got to his feet. Sollenar's car was well away. Ermine shrugged and went to the local broadcasting station.  He commandeered a private desk, a firearm and immediate time on the IAB interoffice circuit to Earth. When his call acknowledgement had come back to him from his office there, he reported:  \"Sollenar is enroute to the Martian city. He wants a duplicate of Burr's device, of course, since he smashed the original when he killed Burr. I'll follow and make final disposition. The disorientation I reported previously is progressing rapidly. Almost all his responses now are inappropriate. On the flight out, he seemed to be staring at something in an empty seat. Quite often when spoken to he obviously hears something else entirely. I expect to catch one of the next few flights back.\"  There was no point in waiting for comment to wend its way back from Earth. Ermine left. He went to a cab rank and paid the exorbitant fee for transportation outside Aresian city limits.         *       *       *       *       *  Close at hand, the Martian city was like a welter of broken pots. Shards of wall and roof joined at savage angles and pointed to nothing. Underfoot, drifts of vitreous material, shaped to fit no sane configuration, and broken to fit such a mosaic as no church would contain, rocked and slid under Sollenar's hurrying feet.  What from Aresia had been a solid front of dun color was here a facade of red, green and blue splashed about centuries ago and since then weathered only enough to show how bitter the colors had once been. The plum-colored sky stretched over all this like a frigid membrane, and the wind blew and blew.  Here and there, as he progressed, Sollenar saw Martian arms and heads protruding from the rubble. Sculptures.  He was moving toward the heart of the city, where some few unbroken structures persisted. At the top of a heap of shards he turned to look behind him. There was the dust-plume of his cab, returning to the city. He expected to walk back--perhaps to meet someone on the road, all alone on the Martian plain if only Ermine would forebear from interfering. Searching the flat, thin-aired landscape, he tried to pick out the plodding dot of Cortwright Burr. But not yet.  He turned and ran down the untrustworthy slope.  He reached the edge of the maintained area. Here the rubble was gone, the ancient walks swept, the statues kept upright on their pediments. But only broken walls suggested the fronts of the houses that had stood here. Knifing their sides up through the wind-rippled sand that only constant care kept off the street, the shadow-houses fenced his way and the sculptures were motionless as hope. Ahead of him, he saw the buildings of the engineers. There was no heap to climb and look to see if Ermine followed close behind.  Sucking his respirator, he reached the building of the Martian engineers.  A sounding strip ran down the doorjamb. He scratched his fingernails sharply along it, and the magnified vibration, ducted throughout the hollow walls, rattled his plea for entrance.   V  The door opened, and Martians stood looking. They were spindly-limbed and slight, their faces framed by folds of leathery tissue. Their mouths were lipped with horn as hard as dentures, and pursed, forever ready to masticate. They were pleasant neither to look at nor, Sollenar knew, to deal with. But Cortwright Burr had done it. And Sollenar needed to do it.  \"Does anyone here speak English?\" he asked.  \"I,\" said the central Martian, his mouth opening to the sound, closing to end the reply.  \"I would like to deal with you.\"  \"Whenever,\" the Martian said, and the group at the doorway parted deliberately to let Sollenar in.  Before the door closed behind him, Sollenar looked back. But the rubble of the abandoned sectors blocked his line of sight into the desert.  \"What can you offer? And what do you want?\" the Martian asked. Sollenar stood half-ringed by them, in a room whose corners he could not see in the uncertain light.  \"I offer you Terrestrial currency.\"  The English-speaking Martian--the Martian who had admitted to speaking English--turned his head slightly and spoke to his fellows. There were clacking sounds as his lips met. The others reacted variously, one of them suddenly gesturing with what seemed a disgusted flip of his arm before he turned without further word and stalked away, his shoulders looking like the shawled back of a very old and very hungry woman.  \"What did Burr give you?\" Sollenar asked.  \"Burr.\" The Martian cocked his head. His eyes were not multi-faceted, but gave that impression.  \"He was here and he dealt with you. Not long ago. On what basis?\"  \"Burr. Yes. Burr gave us currency. We will take currency from you. For the same thing we gave him?\"  \"For immortality, yes.\"  \"Im--This is a new word.\"  \"Is it? For the secret of not dying?\"  \"Not dying? You think we have not-dying for sale here?\" The Martian spoke to the others again. Their lips clattered. Others left, like the first one had, moving with great precision and very slow step, and no remaining tolerance for Sollenar.  Sollenar cried out: \"What did you sell him, then?\"  The principal engineer said: \"We made an entertainment device for him.\"  \"A little thing. This size.\" Sollenar cupped his hands.  \"You have seen it, then.\"  \"Yes. And nothing more? That was all he bought here?\"  \"It was all we had to sell--or give. We don't yet know whether Earthmen will give us things in exchange for currency. We'll see, when we next need something from Aresia.\"  Sollenar demanded: \"How did it work? This thing you sold him.\"  \"Oh, it lets people tell stories to themselves.\"  Sollenar looked closely at the Martian. \"What kind of stories?\"  \"Any kind,\" the Martian said blandly. \"Burr told us what he wanted. He had drawings with him of an Earthman device that used pictures on a screen, and broadcast sounds, to carry the details of the story told to the auditor.\"  \"He stole those patents! He couldn't have used them on Earth.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"And why should he? Our device needs to convey no precise details. Any mind can make its own. It only needs to be put into a situation, and from there it can do all the work. If an auditor wishes a story of contact with other sexes, for example, the projector simply makes it seem to him, the next time he is with the object of his desire, that he is getting positive feedback--that he is arousing a similar response in that object. Once that has been established for him, the auditor may then leave the machine, move about normally, conduct his life as usual--but always in accordance with the basic situation. It is, you see, in the end a means of introducing system into his view of reality. Of course, his society must understand that he is not in accord with reality, for some of what he does cannot seem rational from an outside view of him. So some care must be taken, but not much. If many such devices were to enter his society, soon the circumstances would become commonplace, and the society would surely readjust to allow for it,\" said the English-speaking Martian.  \"The machine creates any desired situation in the auditor's mind?\"  \"Certainly. There are simple predisposing tapes that can be inserted as desired. Love, adventure, cerebration--it makes no difference.\"  Several of the bystanders clacked sounds out to each other. Sollenar looked at them narrowly. It was obvious there had to be more than one English-speaker among these people.  \"And the device you gave Burr,\" he asked the engineer, neither calmly nor hopefully. \"What sort of stories could its auditors tell themselves?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Martian cocked his head again. It gave him the look of an owl at a bedroom window. \"Oh, there was one situation we were particularly instructed to include. Burr said he was thinking ahead to showing"]]]
