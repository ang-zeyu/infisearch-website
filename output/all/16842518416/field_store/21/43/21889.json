Plastic surgery could have converted a fleeting resemblance to a precise one, yet, somehow, Hubbard _felt_ that this was flesh and blood of the old man's.  \"You're very like your father,\" he said, inaccurately: Emrys was less like his father than he should have been, given that startling identity of physique.  \"Am I?\" The boy smiled. \"I never knew him. Of course, I know I look like the pictures, but pictures never tell much, do they?\"  He had many papers to give Peter Hubbard. Too many; no honest man had his life so well in order. But then Emrys' honesty was not the issue, only his identity. The birth certificate said he had been born on Clergal fifty-five years before, so he was ten years older than Hubbard's wildest estimate. A young man, but not a boy--a man of full maturity, but still too young to be, normally, Jan Shortmire's son. Then Hubbard opened Emrys Shortmire's passport and received another shock.  He tried to sound calm. \"I see you were on Morethis the same time your father was!\"  Emrys' smile widened. \"Curious coincidence, wasn't it?\"  A surge of almost physical dislike filled the lawyer. \"Is that all it was--a coincidence?\"  \"Are you suggesting that I pushed my father into the Ekkan?\" Emrys asked pleasantly.  \"Certainly not!\" Hubbard was indignant at the thought that he, as a lawyer, would have voiced such a suspicion, even if it had occurred to him. \"I thought you two might have arranged to meet on Morethis.\"  \"I told you I'd never seen my father,\" Emrys reminded him. \"As for what I was doing on Morethis--that's my business.\"  \"All I'm concerned with is whether or not you _are_ Emrys Shortmire.\" Distaste was almost tangible on Hubbard's tongue. \"It does seem surprising that, since you _were_ on Morethis at the time your father died, you should not have come to claim your inheritance sooner.\"  \"I had affairs of my own to wind up,\" Emrys said flatly.         *       *       *       *       *  Hubbard tapped the papers. \"You understand that these must be checked before you receive your father's estate?\"  \"I understand perfectly.\" Emrys' voice was soft as a Si-yllan cat-man's, and even more insulting. \"They will be gone over thoroughly for any possible error, any tiny imperfection, anything that could invalidate my claim. But you will find them entirely in order.\"  \"I'm sure of that.\" And Hubbard knew, if the papers were forgeries, they would be works of art.  \"You'll probably want me to undergo an equally thorough physical examination for signs of--ah--surgical tampering. Yes, I see I'm right.\"  Ungenerous hope leaped inside Hubbard. \"You would object?\"  \"On the contrary, I'd be delighted. Haven't had a thorough medical checkup for years.\" On this cooperative note, Emrys Shortmire bowed and left.  Hubbard sighed back against the velvet cushions of his chair--real silk, for he was a very rich old man. Unfortunately, he could not doubt that this was Jan Shortmire's progeny. But--and Hubbard sat upright--no matter how much Emrys resembled his father, that was only one parent. Who had the young man's mother been?  Quickly, Hubbard searched through the papers for the birth certificate. The name was Iloa Tasqi. The nationality: _Morethan_.  No wonder the affair had been kept so secret. No wonder Emrys seemed so strange and that Jan had lied about his previous visit to the dark planet. Small wonder, too, that he'd had a son he was not aware of. Who would have believed that human and Morethan could breed together? For the Morethans, although humanoid, were not at all human.  So Emrys Shortmire was only half human. The other half was--well, the vidicasts called it _monster_, and, now that he had met the young man, Peter Hubbard was inclined to agree.   II  Outside the office building, Emrys Shortmire paused and inhaled deeply. Say what you would about the atmospheres of some of the other planets' being fresher and purer, the air of Earth, being the air in which Man had evolved, was the air that felt best in his nostrils and filled his lungs to greatest satisfaction. And, after the fetid atmosphere of Morethis, this was pure heaven. Gray sky and violet dying sun against blue sky and radiant golden sun. No wonder the Morethans were what they were, and Earthmen were what they were.  Well, the golden sun of Earth would set somewhat sooner than the physicists--or the sociologists--had prognosticated. But all that would be long after he himself had died. It was no concern of his, anyway. He was Emrys Shortmire, born out of Jan Shortmire and no mortal woman; and nothing else on Earth, or in the Universe, mattered.  Disdaining the importunate heli-cabs that besieged him with plaintive mechanical offers of transportation, he walked down the street, enjoying the pull of the planet upon the youth and strength of his body, delighting in the clarity of his vision and the keenness of his nostrils. He was so absorbed in his thoughts and so unaccustomed still to Earth's traffic that he did not look where he was going. The groundcar was upon him before he knew it. Of course something like this would happen, he thought bitterly, as darkness descended upon him and he waited for the crushing impact. It was always like that in the old stories, always some drawback to spoil the magic gift.  But then it was light again. The car had passed over him and he was unharmed, to the amazement--and disappointment--of the avid crowd that had gathered.  \"Pedestrians should look where they're going,\" the voice of the car observed petulantly. \"Repairs cost money.\"  Being part human, Emrys was shaken by the experience. His eye caught the brilliant sign of a bar. Here, he thought, would be syrup to soothe his nerves. And he went inside, eager to try the taste of ancient vintages of Earth--unobtainable on the other planets, since fine wines and liquors could not endure the journey through space.         *       *       *       *       *  He sipped a whisky and soda, trying not to feel disappointed at the savor. As he drank, he felt eyes upon him--the bartender's. Yet the long Qesharakan reflecting glass above the bar showed him nothing unusual about his appearance. Did the bartender know who he was? How could he?  Then Emrys noticed that the man glanced from him to someone else--a girl sitting at the other end of the bar. As she met Emrys' eye, she smiled at him. Absently, with remote appreciation of her good looks, he smiled back, then returned to the contemplation of his drink. The bartender's expression deepened to amused contempt.  Emrys realized what was wrong and he could hardly keep from laughing. So intent had he been on the pursuit of his goal that he had almost lost sight of the goal itself. Deliberately, he turned his head and smiled at the girl. She promptly smiled back.  He sat down at her side. Now that he was close, her aquamarine hair showed dark at the roots, and, through the thick golden maquillage, the pores stood out on her nose. Also, she was not so very young. He laughed then, and, when she asked why, bought her a drink. After he had bought her several more, they went to her apartment--a luxurious one in a good section of town. She was not going to be cheap, but, he thought with rising anticipation, he could afford her.  However, the night was curiously unsatisfactory. For him--apparently not for the girl, because the next morning she indignantly refused his money. Evidently the experience had been something out of the ordinary for her. He could not feel it was her fault that it had been nothing for him; the lack was in _him_, he thought, some almost-felt emotion he could not recapture.  Promising to call her, he left, went back to his hotel room and flung himself upon the resilient burim-moss couch.  His body wasn't tired, but his head ached wearily. The liquor, naturally, on an empty stomach ... after all those years of Morethan qumesht. And then the trip. Even with the Shortmire engines--standard equipment now, of course--it had taken a long, tiring time, for Morethis was the most distant of all the civilized planets. Anyone would be exhausted after such a trip. Added to all this, the accident. There were no bruises on his body yet, but later, he knew, they would be visible.         *       *       *       *       *  At last he slept, or seemed to, and dreamed he was on Morethis again--or Morethis was there with him. The air thickened about him into the tangible atmosphere of the dark planet--the swirling aniline fog that never cleared. And in the midst stood Uvrei, the high priest, robed in amethyst and sable. The term _high priest_ was vulgar as applied to him, but the nearest terrestrial equivalent to what he was.  The lips in the shockingly beautiful face parted. \"How goes it, son of my spirit?\" the familiar greeting rolled out, in the familiar voice, deep yet sweet, like dulcet thunder.  \"My head hurts, father of my soul.\" Emrys knew his voice was a petulant child's, yet he could not stop himself. \"I was promised--\"  \"You have not taken care,\" the ancient one said.  How ancient he was, Emrys did not know. The priests of Morethis were, they said, immortal. And they did live for a long, long time, far longer than the common people, whom they resembled only vaguely. Terrestrial scholars said the ruling class was a variant of the Morethan race, inbred to preserve its identity, probably closer to the original world-shaking Morethans than their debased followers. The members of this group seemed young, as coin faces seem young, also old, like coins themselves.  \"I warned you it takes time for the final adjustments to be made. Wait, my son; haste means nothing to you.\"  \"But I've waited so long,\" Emrys complained.  \"Wait a little longer, then. You have all the time in the world.\"  The fog swirled shut about him, and Emrys sank into his personal miasma of sleep. When he woke up, late"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51834"],["title","Never Come Midnight (#2)"],["body","afternoon, he knew from the dank odor clinging to the bedclothes that it had not been a dream, that the priests, the \"gods,\" the \"immortals\" of Morethis could, as they professed--and even he had not believed them in this--project their minds far through space ... though, fortunately, not their bodies, or they would not have needed him. He remembered then the vial of tiny golden pellets Uvrei had given him before he left Morethis, and took one. Perhaps that was what the ancient one had meant. At any rate, Emrys thought he felt better afterward.  He examined his body in the mirror to see if bruises had come, but the tawny, muscle-rippled flesh was unmarked. At length he put on his clothes and, leaving the hotel, went to a jeweler, where he bought a costly bracelet to be sent to the girl of the night before. Such a grandiose gesture relieved him--he had always felt--of all further obligation.  He did not wish to repeat his experience with the liquor, so he did not go to a bar. He had no friends on Earth--nor could he have acknowledged them if he had. He did not wish to repeat his disappointment of the previous night, so he did not seek female companionship--although it was obvious from the eyes of the women he passed that he would have no difficulty whenever he changed his mind. But what should he do? What did young men do with their leisure, he tried to remember, when they had nothing but leisure?         *       *       *       *       *  He dined alone, finally, on a variety of rare terrestrial foods that did not taste quite as he expected, and went to the theater. The play was one he had seen a hundred times before under a hundred different names on many different planets. He went then to a nightclub, but it was crowded and noisy, and the girls did not excite him. Going back to the hotel, he found that sleep, at least, came easily.  _But I did not_, he thought, _do what I did merely for the sake of a good night's rest._  The third day, he wandered into a museum. He found himself less bored than he had expected. Perhaps culture would be most therapeutic for him until he reached his ultimate adjustments. Accordingly, he went from the museum to a revival of a nineteenth-century opera. He didn't like it; in fact, it disturbed him so much that he left before the final curtain and walked through the streets for hours, until he ran into a girl who was also walking the streets, and went home with her.  The experience with the drab, as with the courtesan, was mechanically satisfactory, emotionally inadequate. He paid her--knowing she, too, would have given herself for nothing, had she known how--and went to his hotel limp with the same not-physical weakness he had felt before. The effects of the trip or the accident were lingering. He half expected Uvrei to appear that night, but the old one did not come. Why should he? This talk of spirit-son and soul-father was sophistry; there had been a bargain and each had kept his part.  The afternoon of the fourth day, a vidicast reporter called to ask whether Emrys Shortmire was any relation to the Jan Shortmire who had invented the space-warp engines. Emrys could not deny his identity without jeopardizing his inheritance; however, he refused to be interviewed personally or let his picture be used. He did not, he said, want to be dwarfed by his father's reputation. Nonetheless, his arrival was mentioned on the newscasts and panic rose up in him when he heard his name spoken publicly.  The next day a letter came for him. People rarely wrote letters any more, except to the distant planets, yet this one had an Earth postmark. Cold with panic again, he tore it open and read:      My dear Mr. Shortmire:      This evening's vidicast informed me that you were on Earth. You     will not, I am sure, know my name. However, I was a friend of your     father's, when we were both young men, and it would give me great     pleasure to make your acquaintance.      NICHOLAS DYALL         *       *       *       *       *  Emrys crumpled up the letter and hurled it across the room. He knew Dyall for an old--associate of Jan Shortmire's, but he had not thought him to be alive. What had Dyall done to warrant the longevity treatment? He was nothing but a glorified machinist, a technician. And now he might wreck all of Emrys' plans. But if the young man made no reply, perhaps the old one would take the hint. And so it turned out; there was no further word from Nicholas Dyall.  Finally, two weeks after Emrys had first come to Earth, he got a telecall from Peter Hubbard. His documents were all in order and he could receive his inheritance as soon as he passed the physical examination.  Emrys went to the doctor's offices feeling a cold touch of apprehension again. But all Dr. Jameson said when the examination was finished was, \"You have the physique of a man fifteen years your junior, Mr. Shortmire.\"  Emrys fastened his tunic with fingers that shook from relief. \"Guess I'm lucky,\" he muttered.  The doctor cleared his throat. \"Peter Hubbard was telling me about your mother, that she was....\"  Hubbard, that old fool! And Emrys had been so sure of his discretion. \"My mother was Morethan, yes.\" Then he realized it was possible that Hubbard, too, had felt there might be something not-quite-human manifest in his body and had tried to prepare the doctor. Emrys made his tone more conciliatory. \"On both Morethis and Earth, the child takes citizenship from the father, so--\"  \"I wasn't worrying about any legal problems; I was merely thinking that medical science would be interested.\"  \"I do not wish the fact of my--of my birth publicized in any way--until after my death,\" Emrys added placatorily. \"Surely you can understand what hell life would become if people knew I was half Morethan?\"  The doctor sighed. \"Yes, I know. I can't blame you.\"  \"Tell me, Doctor,\" Emrys asked tensely, \"is there anything about me that doesn't seem ... quite human?\"  The doctor shook his head. \"Only that you're so young for your age. Mr. Shortmire, was your mother one of the caste they call the 'immortals'?\" Then he flushed. \"Forgive me. I didn't mean to violate--\"  Emrys laughed sourly. \"Don't worry; I don't hold to the Morethan beliefs. She was one of the so-called gods, yes. They do live somewhat longer than either the common people or terrestrials; I guess that's why the legend arose, probably why I look so young, too. I should be glad I didn't inherit a--less pleasant trait.\"  \"You should, indeed,\" the doctor said somberly.   III  \"I love you, Emrys,\" the woman said, and died agonizedly in his arms. He looked down at the contorted, leaden face, ravaged by sickness, and thought: _Even when she was beautiful, I could not love her._ He could not even feel sorry for her, except in a remote, intellectual way. He could not even feel sorry for himself and his own inability to feel.  Since none of the servants was left in the house--those who were still alive had fled to the country, where there was less chance of contagion--he took her body to the crematorium himself. Other people were there, consigning their grisly burdens to the automatic fires--thin, sickly creatures they were, who would soon be carrion for the firebirds themselves. Whereas he--if he had an emotion left, it would be shame--shame for the radiant youth and health that he saw mirrored in their dully wondering eyes.  Outside, the street was clamorous with the taped importunities of the empty vehicles--so many machines, because there were so few people left. But he chose to walk.  The air was sweet and clean, because the Dyall machines came and took away the bodies of those who fell in the street, and then cleaned those streets as carefully and tenderly as they had done when the walks and gutters had abounded with the vibrant slovenliness of the living. Emrys could, of course, have thrown the woman's body out into the gutter, and the machines would have carried her in their steel maws to the crematorium. But some remembered emotion had kept him from doing such a thing, and had made him give her to the flames with what small ceremony he could muster.  She had been the last mistress remaining to him, and probably, he thought, to any man in the city. Perhaps, out in the country, there might be women with life and lust in them still, but such women as were left here could no longer be considered women. This last one had not been even human for the past week; yet he had tended her--why, he could not say, except that he had nothing better to do. For one thing, she had been quieter when he was near her, and he could not bear her cries.  He was glad when she did die, because playing the good Samaritan had grown tedious as, in their turn, all other roles had palled. Even though he knew there would be no more women for him, he was glad. During the first few weeks of the plague, when everyone who had been alive had known that soon they would be dead, all the people on Earth had rushed to squander the life which suddenly seemed to fill them to bursting. Then a man could have had all the women he wanted, all of anything he wanted, for the asking, except the one thing he really wanted--the assurance of life.         *       *       *       *       *  Not everyone had plunged into an orgy of joyless pleasure. There were some who took refuge in prayer--addressed either to the traditional Deity or to the recent importations from the other planets. But, in the end, it was the same for all, prayerful and profligate alike. The only exceptions were the lucky few who seemed to be immune, like Emrys Shortmire, and those who escaped from the cities--to the country or, if they were rich, the other planets. So, even if Emrys had craved women before, he would have had enough of them by now.  As he passed through the streets, he heard a man who walked alone and talked to himself curse the name of Jan Shortmire. _They would tear me to pieces if they knew I was his flesh and blood_, Emrys thought,"]]]
