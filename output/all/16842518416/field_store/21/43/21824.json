Norah put all the food not in cans inside the old-fashioned icebox which took the place of a refrigerator. Philip thought he was too disturbed to be able to sleep, but he did, and Norah, exhausted, was asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow.  His last doubt of his wife's sanity vanished when, the next morning, they found the icebox door open and half the food gone.         *       *       *       *       *  \"That settles it!\" Philip announced. \"Come on, Norah, put your coat on. You're coming with me to the lab and we'll report what's happened. They'll find those creatures if they have to tear the house apart to do it. That boy must have been telling the truth.\"  \"You couldn't keep me away,\" Norah responded. \"I'll never spend another minute alone in this house while those dreadful things are in it.\"  But of course when they got to the front door, there they were, circling them, their teeth bared. The same with the back door and all the first floor windows.  \"That's SK540 all right, leading them,\" Philip whispered through clenched jaws. He could smash them all, he supposed, in time, with what weapons he had. But he worked in the laboratory. He knew their value to science, especially SK540's.  Rats couldn't talk, he knew, and they couldn't understand human speech. Nevertheless, some kind of communication might establish itself. SK540's eyes were too intelligent not to believe that he was getting the gist of talk directed to him.  \"This is utterly ridiculous,\" Philip grated. \"If you won't let us out, how can we keep bringing food into the house for you? We'll all starve, you and we together.\"  He could have sworn SK540 was considering. But he guessed the implicit answer. Let either one of them out, now they knew the rats were there, and men from the laboratory would come quickly and overwhelm and carry off the besiegers. It was a true impasse.  \"Philip,\" Norah reminded him, \"if you don't go to work, they know we haven't a phone, and somebody will be here pretty soon to find out if anything's wrong.\"  But that wouldn't help, Philip reflected gloomily; they'd let anyone in, and keep him there.  And he thought to himself, and was careful not to say it aloud: rats are rats. Even if they are 25th generation laboratory-born. When the other food was gone there would be human meat.  He did not want to look at them any more. He took Norah's arm and turned away into their bedroom.  They stayed there all day, too upset to think of eating, talking and talking to no conclusion. As dusk came on they did not light the gas. Exhausted, they lay down on the bed without undressing.  After a while there was a quiet scratching at the door.  \"Don't let them in!\" Norah whispered. Her teeth were chattering.  \"I must, dear,\" he whispered back. \"It isn't 'them,' I'm sure of it--it's just SK540 himself. I've been expecting him. We've got to reach some kind of understanding.\"  \"With a rat?\"  \"With a super-rat. We have no choice.\"  Philip was right. SK540 alone stood there and sidled in as the door closed solidly again behind him.  How could one communicate with a rat? Philip could think of no way except to pick him up, place him where they were face to face, and talk.  \"Are your--followers outside?\" he asked.  A rodent's face can have no expression, but Philip caught a glance of contempt in the beady eyes. The slaves were doubtless bedded down in their hideaway, with strict orders to stay there and keep quiet.  \"You know,\" Philip Vinson went on, \"I could kill you, very easily.\" The words would mean nothing to SK540; the tone might. He watched the beady eyes; there was nothing in them but intelligent attention, no flicker of fear.  \"Or I could tie you up and take you to the laboratory and let them decide whether to keep you or kill you. We are all much bigger and stronger than you. Without your army you can't intimidate us.\"  There was, of course, no answer. But SK540 did a startling and touching thing. He reached out one front paw, as if in appeal.  Norah caught her breath in astonishment.         *       *       *       *       *  \"He--he just wants to be free,\" she said in a choked whisper.  \"You mean you're not afraid of him any more?\"  \"You said yourself he couldn't intimidate us without his army.\"  Philip thought a minute. Then he said slowly:  \"I wonder if we had the right to do this to him in the first place. He would have been an ordinary laboratory rat, mindless and contented; we've made him into a neurotic alien in his world.\"  \"You're not responsible, darling; you're a technician, not a biochemist.\"  \"I share the responsibility. We all do.\"  \"So what? The fact remains that it was done, and here he is--and here we are.\"  The doorbell rang.  Philip and Norah exchanged glances. SK540 watched them.  \"It's probably Kelly, from the lab,\" Philip said, \"trying to find out why I wasn't there today. It's just about quitting time, and he lives nearest us.\"  Norah astonished him. She picked up SK540 from the bed-side table where Philip had placed him, and hid him under her pillow.  \"Get rid of whoever it is,\" she said defensively. Philip stared for an instant, then walked briskly downstairs. He was back in a few minutes.  \"It was Kelly, all right,\" he told her. \"I said you were sick and I couldn't leave you to phone. I said I'd be there tomorrow. Now what?\"  SK540's white whiskers emerged from under the pillow, and he jumped over to the table again. Norah's cheeks were pink.  \"When it came to the point, I just couldn't,\" she explained shamefacedly. \"I suddenly realized that he's a _person_. I couldn't let him be taken back to prison.\"  \"Aren't you frightened any more?\"  \"Not of him.\" She faced the super-rat squarely. \"Look,\" she said, \"if we take care of you, will you get rid of that gang of yours, so we can be free too?\"  \"That's nonsense, Norah,\" Philip objected. \"He can't possibly understand you.\"  \"Dogs and cats learn to understand enough, and he's smarter than any dog or cat that ever lived.\"  \"But--\"  The words froze on his lips. SK540 had jumped to the floor and run to the door. There he stood and looked back at them, his tail twitching.  \"He wants us to follow him,\" Norah murmured.  There was no sign of a hole in the back wall of the disused pantry. But behind it they could hear squeaks and rustlings.  SK540 scratched delicately at almost invisible cracks. A section of the wall, two by four inches, fell out on the floor.  \"So that's where some of the oatmeal went,\" Norah commented. \"Made into paste.\"  \"Sh!\"  SK540 vanished through the hole. They waited, listening to incomprehensible sounds. Outside it had grown dark.         *       *       *       *       *  Then the leader emerged and stood to one side of the long line that pattered through the hole. The two humans stared, fascinated, as the line made straight for the back door and under it. SK540 stayed where he was.  \"Will they go back to the lab?\" Norah asked.  Philip shrugged.  \"It doesn't matter. Some of them may ... I feel like a traitor.\"  \"I don't. I feel like one of those people who hid escaped war prisoners in Europe.\"  When the rats were all gone, they turned to SK540. But without a glance at them he re-entered the hiding-place. In a minute he returned, herding two white rats before him. He stood still, obviously expectant.  Philip squatted on his heels. He picked up the two refugees and looked them over.  \"Both females,\" he announced briefly. \"And both pregnant.\"  \"Is he the father?\"  \"Who else? He'd see to that.\"  \"And will they inherit his--his--\"  \"His 'super-ratism'? That's the whole point. That's the object of the entire experiment. They were going to try it soon.\"  The three white rats had scarcely moved. The two mothers-to-be had apparently fallen asleep. Only SK540 stood quietly eying the humans. When they left him to find a place where they could talk in private he did not follow them.  \"It comes down to this,\" Philip said at the end of half an hour's fruitless discussion. \"We promised him, or as good as. He believed us and trusted us.  \"But if we keep to our promise we're _really_ traitors--to the human race.\"  \"You mean, if the offspring should inherit his brain-power, they might overrun us all?\"  \"Not might. Would.\"  \"So--\"  \"So it's an insoluble problem, on our terms. We have to think of this as a war, and of them as our enemies. What is our word of honor to a rat?\"  \"But to a super-rat--to SK540--\"  As if called, SK540 appeared.  Had he been listening? Had he understood? Neither of them dared to voice the question aloud in his presence.  \"Later,\" Philip murmured.  \"We must eat,\" said Norah. \"Let's see what's left in the way of food.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Everything tasted flat; they weren't very hungry after all. There was enough left over to feed the three rats. But they had evidently helped themselves earlier; they left the scraps untasted.  Neither of the humans guessed what else had vanished from the pantry shelves--what, when he had heard enough, SK540 had slipped away and sprinkled on the remaining contents of the icebox, wherever the white powder would not show.  They did not know until it was too late--until both of them lay writhing in their last spasms on their bedroom floor.  By the time the house was broken into and their bodies found, SK540 and his two wives were far away, and safe....  And this, children, is the true account, handed down by tradition from the days of our great Founder, of how the human race ceased to exist and we took over the world."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51752"],["title","If You Was a Moklin (#0)"],["body","You Was a MOKLIN                            By MURRAY LEINSTER                      Illustrated by HARRY ROSENBAUM             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                 Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.

You'd even want to be one!   Up to the very last minute, I can't imagine that Moklin is going to be the first planet that humans get off of, moving fast, breathing hard, and sweating awful copious. There ain't any reason for it. Humans have been on Moklin for more than forty years, and nobody ever figures there is anything the least bit wrong until Brooks works it out. When he does, nobody can believe it. But it turns out bad. Plenty bad. But maybe things are working out all right now.  _Maybe!_ I hope so.  At first, even after he's sent off long reports by six ships in a row, I don't see the picture beginning to turn sour. I don't get it until after the old _Palmyra_ comes and squats down on the next to the last trip a Company ship is ever going to make to Moklin.  Up to that very morning everything is serene, and that morning I am sitting on the trading post porch, not doing a thing but sitting there and breathing happy. I'm looking at a Moklin kid. She's about the size of a human six-year-old and she is playing in a mud puddle while her folks are trading in the post. She is a cute kid--mighty human-looking. She has long whiskers like Old Man Bland, who's the first human to open a trading post and learn to talk to Moklins.  Moklins think a lot of Old Man Bland. They build him a big tomb, Moklin-style, when he dies, and there is more Moklin kids born with long whiskers than you can shake a stick at. And everything looks okay. _Everything!_  Sitting there on the porch, I hear a Moklin talking inside the trade room. Talking English just as good as anybody. He says to Deeth, our Moklin trade-clerk, \"But Deeth, I can buy this cheaper over at the other trading post! Why should I pay more here?\"  Deeth says, in English too, \"I can't help that. That's the price here. You pay it or you don't. That's all.\"  I just sit there breathing complacent, thinking how good things are. Here I'm Joe Brinkley, and me and Brooks are the Company on Moklin--only humans rate as Company employees and get pensions, of course--and I'm thinking sentimental about how much humaner Moklins are getting every day and how swell everything is.  The six-year-old kid gets up out of the mud puddle, and wrings out her whiskers--they are exactly like the ones on the picture of Old Man Bland in the trade room--and she goes trotting off down the road after her folks. She is mighty human-looking, that one.  The wild ones don't look near so human. Those that live in the forest are greenish, and have saucer eyes, and their noses can wiggle like an Earth rabbit. You wouldn't think they're the same breed as the trading post Moklins at all, but they are. They crossbreed with each other, only the kids look humaner than their parents and are mighty near the same skin color as Earthmen, which is plenty natural when you think about it, but nobody does. Not up to then.  I don't think about that then, or anything else. Not even about the reports Brooks keeps sweating over and sending off with every Company ship. I am just sitting there contented when I notice that Sally, the tree that shades the trading post porch, starts pulling up her roots. She gets them coiled careful and starts marching off. I see the other trees are moving off, too, clearing the landing field. They're waddling away to leave a free space, and they're pushing and shoving, trying to crowd each other, and the little ones sneak under the big ones and they all act peevish. Somehow they know a ship is coming in. That's what their walking off means, anyhow. But there ain't a ship due in for a month, yet.  They're clearing the landing field, though, so I start listening for a ship's drive, even if I don't believe it. At first I don't hear a thing. It must be ten minutes before I hear a thin whistle, and right after it the heavy drone that's the ground-repulsor units pushing against bedrock underground. Lucky they don't push on wet stuff, or a ship would sure mess up the local countryside!  I get off my chair and go out to look. Sure enough, the old _Palmyra_ comes bulging down out of the sky, a month ahead of schedule, and the trees over at the edge of the field shove each other all round to make room. The ship drops, hangs anxious ten feet up, and then kind of sighs and lets down. Then there's Moklins running out of everywhere, waving cordial.  They sure do like humans, these Moklins! Humans are their idea of what people should be like! Moklins will wrestle the freight over to the trading post while others are climbing over everything that's waiting to go off, all set to pass it up to the ship and hoping to spot friends they've made in the crew. If they can get a human to go home with them and visit while the ship is down, they brag about it for weeks. And do they treat their guests swell!  They got fancy Moklin clothes for them to wear--soft, silky guest garments--and they got Moklin fruits and Moklin drinks--you ought to taste them! And when the humans have to go back to the ship at takeoff time, the Moklins bring them back with flower wreaths all over them.  Humans is tops on Moklin. And Moklins get humaner every day. There's Deeth, our clerk. You couldn't hardly tell him from human, anyways. He looks like a human named Casey that used to be at the trading post, and he's got a flock of brothers and sisters as human-looking as he is. You'd swear--  But this is the last time but one that a Earth ship is going to land on Moklin, though nobody knows it yet. Her passenger port opens up and Captain Haney gets out. The Moklins yell cheerful when they see him. He waves a hand and helps a human girl out. She has red hair and a sort of businesslike air about her. The Moklins wave and holler and grin. The girl looks at them funny, and Cap Haney explains something, but she sets her lips. Then the Moklins run out a freight-truck, and Haney and the girl get on it, and they come racing over to the post, the Moklins pushing and pulling them and making a big fuss of laughing and hollering--all so friendly, it would make anybody feel good inside. Moklins like humans! They admire them tremendous! They do everything they can think of to be human, and they're smart, but sometimes I get cold shivers when I think how close a thing it turns out to be.  Cap Haney steps off the freight-truck and helps the girl down. Her eyes are blazing. She is the maddest-looking female I ever see, but pretty as they make them, with that red hair and those blue eyes staring at me hostile.  \"Hiya, Joe,\" says Cap Haney. \"Where's Brooks?\"  I tell him. Brooks is poking around in the mountains up back of the post. He is jumpy and worried and peevish, and he acts like he's trying to find something that ain't there, but he's bound he's going to find it regardless.  \"Too bad he's not here,\" says Haney. He turns to the girl. \"This is Joe Brinkley,\" he says. \"He's Brooks' assistant. And, Joe, this is Inspector Caldwell--Miss Caldwell.\"  \"Inspector will do,\" says the girl, curt. She looks at me accusing. \"I'm here to check into this matter of a competitive trading post on Moklin.\"  \"Oh,\" I says. \"That's bad business. But it ain't cut into our trade much. In fact, I don't think it's cut our trade at all.\"  \"Get my baggage ashore, Captain,\" says Inspector Caldwell, imperious. \"Then you can go about your business. I'll stay here until you stop on your return trip.\"  I call, \"Hey, Deeth!\" But he's right behind me. He looks respectful and admiring at the girl. You'd swear he's human! He's the spit and image of Casey, who used to be on Moklin until six years back.  \"Yes, sir,\" says Deeth. He says to the girl, \"Yes, ma'am. I'll show you your quarters, ma'am, and your baggage will get there right away. This way, ma'am.\"  He leads her off, but he don't have to send for her baggage. A pack of Moklins come along, dragging it, hopeful of having her say \"Thank you\" to them for it. There hasn't ever been a human woman on Moklin before, and they are all excited. I bet if there had been women around before, there'd have been hell loose before, too. But now the Moklins just hang around, admiring.  There are kids with whiskers like Old Man Bland, and other kids with mustaches--male and female both--and all that sort of stuff. I'm pointing out to Cap Haney some kids that bear a remarkable resemblance to him and he's saying, \"Well, what do you know!\" when Inspector Caldwell comes back.  \"What are you waiting for, Captain?\" she asks, frosty.  \"The ship usually grounds a few hours,\" I explain. \"These Moklins are such friendly critters, we figure it makes good will for the trading post for the crew to be friendly with 'em.\"  \"I doubt,\" says Inspector Caldwell, her voice dripping icicles, \"that I shall advise that that custom be continued.\"  Cap Haney shrugs his shoulders and goes off, so I know Inspector Caldwell is high up in the Company. She ain't old, maybe in her middle twenties, I'd say, but the Caldwell family practically owns the Company, and all the nephews and cousins and so on get put into a special school so they can go to work in the family firm. They get taught pretty good, and most of them really rate the good jobs they get. Anyhow, there's plenty of good jobs. The Company runs twenty or thirty solar systems and it's run pretty tight. Being a Caldwell means you get breaks, but you got to live up to them.  Cap Haney almost has to fight his way through the Moklins who want to give him flowers and fruits and such. Moklins are sure crazy about humans! He gets to the"]]]
