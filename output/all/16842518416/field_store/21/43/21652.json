But I had no choice whatever.  \"Okay,\" I said, tasting bitterness over the craving.         *       *       *       *       *  The coffee was in a thick white cup before me on the counter. It was pale, grayish brown and steaming faintly. I picked it up in both hands to feel its warmth.  Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the woman sitting on the stool beside me. She had no right to intrude. This moment should be mine, but there she sat, marring it for me, a contemptible _tourist_.  I gulped down the thick, dark liquid brutally. It was all I could do. The cramp flowed out of my diaphragm. I took another swallow and was able to think straight again. A third swallow and I felt--good. Not abnormally stimulated, but strong, alert, poised on the brink of exhilaration.  That was what coffee did for me.  I was a caffeine addict.  Earth-norm humans sometimes have the addiction to a slight extent, but I knew that as a Centurian I had it infinitely worse. Caffeine affected my metabolism like a pure alkaloid. The immediate effects weren't the same, but the _need_ ran as deep.  I finished the cup. I didn't order another because I wasn't a pure sensualist. I just needed release. Sometimes, when I didn't have the price of a cup, I would look around in alleys and find cola bottles with a few drops left in them. They have a little caffeine in them--not enough, never enough, but better than nothing.  \"Now what do you want to eat?\" the woman asked.  I didn't look at her. She didn't know. She thought I was a human--an _Earth_ human. I was a _man_, of course, not an _alien_ like a Martian. Earthmen ran the whole Solar Federation, but I was just as good as an Earthman. With my suntan and short mane, I could pass, couldn't I? That proved it, didn't it?  \"Hamburger,\" I said. \"Well done.\" I knew that would probably be all they had fit to eat at a place like this. It might be horse meat, but then I didn't have the local prejudices.  I didn't look at the woman. I couldn't. But I kept remembering how clean she looked and I was aware of how clean she smelled. I was so dirty, so very dirty that I could never get clean if I bathed every hour for the rest of my life.  The hamburger was engulfed by five black-crowned, broken fingernails and raised to two rows of yellow ivory. I surrounded it like an ameba, almost in a single movement of my jaws.  Several other hamburgers followed the first. I lost count. I drank a glass of milk. I didn't want to black out on coffee with Doc waiting for me.  \"Could I have a few to take with me, miss?\" I pleaded.  She smiled. I caught that out of the edge of my vision, but mostly I just felt it.  \"That's the first time you've called me anything but 'ma'am',\" she said. \"I'm not an old-maid schoolteacher, you know.\"  That probably meant she was a schoolteacher, though. \"No, miss,\" I said.  \"It's Miss Casey--Vivian Casey,\" she corrected. She was a schoolteacher, all right. No other girl would introduce herself as Miss Last Name. Then there was something in her voice....  \"What's your name?\" she said to me.  I choked a little on a bite of stale bun.  I _had_ a name, _of course_.         *       *       *       *       *  Everybody has a name, and I knew if I went off somewhere quiet and thought about it, mine would come to me. Meanwhile, I would tell the girl that my name was ... Kevin O'Malley. Abruptly I realized that that _was_ my name.  \"Kevin,\" I told her. \"John Kevin.\"  \"Mister Kevin,\" she said, her words dancing with bright absurdity like waterhose mist on a summer afternoon, \"I wonder if you could help _me_.\"  \"Happy to, miss,\" I mumbled.  She pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar. \"What do you think of this?\"  I looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine.      Dear Acolyte R. I. S.:      Please send me FREE of obligation, in sealed wrapper, \"The     Scarlet Book\" revealing to me how I may gain Secret Mastery of the     Universe      Name: ........................      Address: .....................  The world disoriented itself and I was on the floor of the somber diner and Miss Vivian Casey was out of sight and scent.  There was a five dollar bill tight in my fist. The counterman was trying to pull it out.  I looked up at his stubbled face. \"I had half a dozen hamburgers, a cup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go and a pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five--if the lady didn't pay you.\"  \"She didn't,\" he stammered. \"Why do you think I was trying to get that bill out of your hand?\"  I didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the counterman put down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacant bar, smoothing it.  I scooped up my change and walked out the door. There was no one on the sidewalk, only in the doorways.         *       *       *       *       *  First I opened the door on an amber world, then an azure one. Neon light was coming from the chickenwire border of the room, from a window somewhere beyond. The wino on one side of the room was singing and the one on the other side was praying, same as before. Only they had changed around--prayer came from the left, song from the right.  Doc sat on the floor in the half-darkness and he had made a _thing_.  My heart hammered at my lungs. I _knew_ this last time had been different. Whatever it was was getting closer. This was the first time Doc had ever made anything. It didn't look like much, but it was a start.  He had broken the light bulb and used the filament and screw bottom. His strong hands had unraveled some of the bed \"springs\"--metal webbing--and fashioned them to his needs. My orb-point pen had dissolved under his touch. All of them, useless parts, were made into a meaningful whole.  I knew the thing had meaning, but when I tried to follow its design, I became lost.  I put the paper container of warm coffee and the greasy bag of hamburgers on the wooden chair, hoping the odor wouldn't bring any hungry rats out of the walls.  I knelt beside Doc.  \"An order, my boy, an order,\" he whispered.  I didn't know what he meant. Was he suddenly trying to give me orders?  He held something out to me. It was my notebook. He had used my pen, before dismantling it, to write something. I tilted the notebook against the neon light, now red wine, now fresh grape. I read it.  \"Concentrate,\" Doc said hoarsely. \"Concentrate....\"  I wondered what the words meant. Wondering takes a kind of concentration.  The words \"First Edition\" were what I was thinking about most.         *       *       *       *       *  The heavy-set man in the ornate armchair was saying, \"The bullet struck me as I was pulling on my boot....\"  I was kneeling on the floor of a Victorian living room. I'm quite familiar with Earth history and I recognized the period immediately.  Then I realized what I had been trying to get from Doc all these months--time travel.  A thin, sickly man was sprawled in the other chair in a rumpled dressing gown. My eyes held to his face, his pinpoint pupils and whitened nose. He was a condemned snowbird! If there was anything I hated or held in more contempt than tourists or Martians, it was a snowbird.  \"My clients have occasioned singular methods of entry into these rooms,\" the thin man remarked, \"but never before have they used instantaneous materialization.\"  The heavier man was half choking, half laughing. \"I say--I say, I would like to see you explain this, my dear fellow.\"  \"I have no data,\" the thin man answered coolly. \"In such instance, one begins to twist theories into fact, or facts into theories. I must ask this unemployed, former professional man who has gone through a serious illness and is suffering a more serious addiction to tell me the place and _time_ from which he comes.\"  The surprise stung. \"How did you know?\" I asked.  He gestured with a pale hand. \"To maintain a logical approach, I must reject the supernatural. Your arrival, unless hallucinatory--and despite my voluntary use of one drug and my involuntary experiences recently with another, I must accept the evidence of my senses or retire from my profession--your arrival was then super-normal. I might say super-scientific, of a science not of my or the good doctor's time, clearly. Time travel is a familiar folk legend and I have been reading an article by the entertaining Mr. Wells. Perhaps he will expand it into one of his novels of scientific romance.\"  I knew who these two men were, with a tormenting doubt. \"But the other--\"  \"Your hands, though unclean, have never seen physical labor. Your cranial construction is of a superior type, or even if you reject my theories, concentration does set the facial features. I judge you have suffered an illness because of the inhibition of your beard growth. Your over-fondness for rum or opium, perhaps, is self-evident. You are at too resilient an age to be so sunk by even an amour. Why else then would you let yourself fall into such an underfed and unsanitary state?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He was so smug and so sure, this snowbird. I hated him. Because I couldn't trust to my own senses as he did.  \"You don't exist,\" I said slowly, painfully. \"You are fictional creations.\"  The doctor flushed darkly. \"You give my literary agent too much credit for the addition of professional polish to my works.\"  The other man was filling a large, curved pipe from something that looked vaguely like an ice-skate. \"Interesting. Perhaps if our visitor would tell us something of his age with special reference to the theory and practice of temporal transference, Doctor, we would be better equipped to judge whether we exist.\"  There was no theory or practice of time travel. I told them all I had ever heard theorized from Hindu yoga through Extra-sensory Perception to Relativity and the positron and negatron.  \"Interesting.\" He breathed out suffocating black clouds of smoke. \"P"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51305"],["title","Confidence Game (#2)"],["body","that the people of your time by their 'Extra-sensory Perception' have altered the past to make it as they suppose it to be. The great historical figures are made the larger than life-size that we know them. The great literary creations assume reality.\"  I thought of Cleopatra and Helen of Troy and wondered if they would be the goddesses of love that people imagined or the scrawny, big-nosed redhead and fading old woman of scholarship. Then I noticed the detective's hand that had been resting idly on a round brass weight of unknown sort to me. His tapered fingertips had indented the metal.  His bright eyes followed mine and he smiled faintly. \"Withdrawal symptoms.\"  The admiration and affection for this man that had been slowly building up behind my hatred unbrinked. I remembered now that he had stopped. He was not _really_ a snowbird.  After a time, I asked the doctor a question.  \"Why, yes. I'm flattered. This is the first manuscript. Considering my professional handwriting, I recopied it more laboriously.\"  Accepting the sheaf of papers and not looking back at these two great and good men, I concentrated on my own time and Doc. Nothing happened. My heart raced, but I saw something dancing before me like a dust mote in sunlight and stepped toward it....  ... into the effective range of Miss Casey's tiny gun.         *       *       *       *       *  She inclined the lethal silver toy. \"Let me see those papers, Kevin.\"  I handed her the doctor's manuscript.  Her breath escaped slowly and loudly. \"It's all right. It's all right. It exists. It's real. Not even one of the unwritten ones. I've read this myself.\"  Doc was lying on the cot, half his face twisted into horror.  \"Don't move, Kevin,\" she said. \"I'll have to shoot you--maybe not to kill, but painfully.\"  I watched her face flash blue, red, blue and knew she meant it. But I had known too much in too short a time. I had to help Doc, but there was something else.  \"I just want a drink of coffee from that container on the chair,\" I told her.  She shook her head. \"I don't know what you think it does to you.\"  It was getting hard for me to think. \"Who are you?\"  She showed me a card from her wrist purse. Vivian Casey, Constable, North American Mounted Police.  I had to help Doc. I had to have some coffee. \"What do you want?\"  \"Listen, Kevin. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Doc found a method of time travel. It was almost a purely mathematical, topographical way divorced from modern physical sciences. He kept it secret and he wanted to make money with it. He was an idealist--he had his crusades. How can you make money with time travel?\"  I didn't know whether she was asking me, but I didn't know. All I knew was that I had to help Doc and get some coffee.  \"It takes money--money Doc didn't have--to make money,\" Miss Casey said, \"even if you know what horse will come in and what stock will prosper. Besides, horse-racing and the stock market weren't a part of Doc's character. He was a scholar.\"  Why did she keep using the past tense in reference to Doc? It scared me. He was lying so still with the left side of his face so twisted. I needed some coffee.  \"He became a book finder. He got rare editions of books and magazines for his clients in absolutely mint condition. That was all right--until he started obtaining books that _did not exist_.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I didn't know what all that was supposed to mean. I got to the chair, snatched up the coffee container, tore it open and gulped down the soothing liquid.  I turned toward her and threw the rest of the coffee into her face.  The coffee splashed out over her platinum hair and powder-blue dress that looked white when the neon was azure, purple when it was amber. The coffee stained and soiled and ruined, and I was fiercely glad, unreasonably happy.  I tore the gun away from her by the short barrel, not letting my filthy hands touch her scrubbed pink ones.  I pointed the gun generally at her and backed around the _thing_ on the floor to the cot. Doc had a pulse, but it was irregular. I checked for a fever and there wasn't one. After that, I didn't know what to do.  I looked up finally and saw a Martian in or about the doorway.  \"Call me Andre,\" the Martian said. \"A common name but foreign. It should serve as a point of reference.\"  I had always wondered how a thing like a Martian could talk. Sometimes I wondered if they really could.  \"You won't need the gun,\" Andre said conversationally.  \"I'll keep it, thanks. What do _you_ want?\"  \"I'll begin as Miss Casey did--by telling you things. Hundreds of people disappeared from North America a few months ago.\"  \"They always do,\" I told him.  \"They ceased to exist--as human beings--shortly after they received a book from Doc,\" the Martian said.  Something seemed to strike me in the back of the neck. I staggered, but managed to hold onto the gun and stand up.  \"Use one of those sneaky Martian weapons again,\" I warned him, \"and I'll kill the girl.\" Martians were supposed to be against the destruction of any life-form, I had read someplace. I doubted it, but it was worth a try.  \"Kevin,\" Andre said, \"why don't you take a bath?\"  The Martian weapon staggered me again. I tried to say something. I tried to explain that I was so dirty that I could never get clean no matter how often I bathed. No words formed.  \"But, Kevin,\" Andre said, \"you aren't _that_ dirty.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The blow shook the gun from my fingers. It almost fell into the _thing_ on the floor, but at the last moment seemed to change direction and miss it.  I knew something. \"I don't wash because I drink coffee.\"  \"It's all right to drink coffee, isn't it?\" he asked.  \"Of course,\" I said, and added absurdly, \"That's why I don't wash.\"  \"You mean,\" Andre said slowly, ploddingly, \"that if you bathed, you would be admitting that drinking coffee was in the same class as any other solitary vice that makes people wash frequently.\"  I was knocked to my knees.  \"Kevin,\" the Martian said, \"drinking coffee represents a major vice only in Centurian humanoids, not Earth-norm human beings. _Which are you?_\"  Nothing came out of my gabbling mouth.  \"_What is Doc's full name?_\"  I almost fell in, but at the last instant I caught myself and said, \"Doctor Kevin O'Malley, Senior.\"  From the bed, Doc said a word. \"Son.\"  Then he disappeared.  I looked at that which he had made. I wondered where he had gone, in search of what.  \"He didn't use that,\" Andre said.  So I was an Earthman, Doc's son. So my addiction to coffee was all in my mind. That didn't change anything. They say sex is all in your mind. I didn't want to be cured. I wouldn't be. Doc was gone. That was all I had now. That and the _thing_ he left.  \"The rest is simple,\" Andre said. \"Doc O'Malley bought up all the stock in a certain ancient metaphysical order and started supplying members with certain books. Can you imagine the effect of the _Book of Dyzan_ or the _Book of Thoth_ or the _Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan_ or the _Necronomican_ itself on human beings?\"  \"But they don't exist,\" I said wearily.  \"Exactly, Kevin, exactly. They have never existed any more than your Victorian detective friend. But the unconscious racial mind has reached back into time and created them. And that unconscious mind, deeper than psychology terms the subconscious, has always known about the powers of ESP, telepathy, telekinesis, precognition. Through these books, the human race can tell itself how to achieve a state of pure logic, without food, without sex, without conflict--just as Doc has achieved such a state--a little late, true. He had a powerful guilt complex, even stronger than your withdrawal, over releasing this blessing on the inhabited universe, but reason finally prevailed. He had reached a state of pure thought.\"  \"The North American government _has_ to have this secret, Kevin,\" the girl said. \"You can't let it fall into the hands of the Martians.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Andre did not deny that he wanted it to fall into his hands.  I knew I could not let Doc's--Dad's--time travel _thing_ fall into anyone's hands. I remembered that all the copies of the books had disappeared with their readers now. There must not be any more, I knew.  Miss Casey did her duty and tried to stop me with a judo hold, but I don't think her heart was in it, because I reversed and broke it.  I kicked the _thing_ to pieces and stomped on the pieces. Maybe you can't stop the progress of science, but I knew it might be millenniums before Doc's genes and creative environment were recreated and time travel was rediscovered. Maybe we would be ready for it then. I knew we weren't now.  Miss Casey leaned against my dirty chest and cried into it. I didn't mind her touching me.  \"I'm glad,\" she said.  Andre flowed out of the doorway with a sigh. Of relief?  I would never know. I supposed I had destroyed _it_ because I didn't want the human race to become a thing of pure reason without purpose, direction or love, but I would never know for sure. I thought I could kick the habit--perhaps with Miss Casey's help--but I wasn't really confident.  Maybe I had destroyed the time machine because a world without material needs would not grow and roast coffee."]]]
