It turned out that no one did: Matilda tried the general store, the fire department, the city hall, the high school, all three Cedar Falls gas stations, the livery stable, and half a dozen private dwellings at random. As far us the gentry of Cedar Falls was concerned, Haron Gorka did not exist.  Matilda felt bad, but she had no intention of returning home this early. If she could not find Haron Gorka, that was one thing; but she knew that she'd rather not return home and face the widow Penshaws, at least not for a while yet. The widow Penshaws meant well, but she liked to analyze other people's mistakes, especially Matilda's.  Accordingly, Matilda trudged wearily toward Cedar Falls' small and unimposing library. She could release some of her pent-up aggression by browsing through the dusty slacks.  This she did, but it was unrewarding. Cedar Falls had what might be called a microscopic library, and Matilda thought that if this small building were filled with microfilm rather than books, the library still would be lacking. Hence she retraced her steps and nodded to the old librarian as she passed.         *       *       *       *       *  Then Matilda frowned. Twenty years from now, this could be Matilda Penshaws--complete with plain gray dress, rimless spectacles, gray hair, suspicious eyes, and a broom-stick figure....  On the other hand--why not? Why couldn't the librarian help her? Why hadn't she thought of it before? Certainly a man as well-educated as Haron Gorka would be an avid reader, and unless he had a permanent residence here in Cedar Palls, one couldn't expect that he'd have his own library with him. This being the case, a third-rate collection of books was far better than no collection at all, and perhaps the librarian would know Mr. Haron Gorka.  Matilda cleared her throat. \"Pardon me,\" she began. \"I'm looking for--\"  \"Haron Gorka.\" The librarian nodded.  \"How on earth did you know?\"  \"That's easy. You're the sixth young woman who came here inquiring about that man today. Six of you--five others in the morning, and now you in the afternoon. I never did trust this Mr. Gorka....\"  Matilda jumped as if she had been struck strategically from the rear. \"You know him? You know Haron Gorka?\"  \"Certainly. Of course I know him. He's our steadiest reader here at the library. Not a week goes by that he doesn't take out three, four books. Scholarly gentleman, but not without charm. If I were twenty years younger--\"  Matilda thought a little flattery might be effective. \"Only ten,\" she assured the librarian. \"Ten years would be more than sufficient, I'm sure.\"  \"Are you? Well. Well, well.\" The librarian did something with the back of her hair, but it looked the same as before. \"Maybe you're right. Maybe you're right at that.\" Then she sighed. \"But I guess a miss is as good as a mile.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"I mean anyone would like to correspond with Haron Gorka. Or to know him well. To be considered his friend. Haron Gorka....\"  The librarian seemed about to soar off into the air someplace, and if five women had been here first, Matilda was now definitely in a hurry.  \"Um, where can I find Mr. Gorka?\"  \"I'm not supposed to do this, you know. We're not permitted to give the addresses of any of our people. Against regulations, my dear.\"  \"What about the other five women?\"  \"They convinced me that I ought to give them his address.\"  Matilda reached into her pocket-book and withdrew a five dollar bill. \"Was this the way?\" she demanded. Matilda was not very good at this sort of thing.  The librarian shook her head.  Matilda nodded shrewdly and added a twin brother to the bill in her hand. \"Then is this better?\"  \"That's worse. I wouldn't take your money--\"  \"Sorry. What then?\"  \"If I can't enjoy an association with Haron Gorka directly, I still could get the vicarious pleasure of your contact with him. Report to me faithfully and you'll get his address. That's what the other five will do, and with half a dozen of you, I'll get an overall picture. Each one of you will tell me about Haron Gorka, sparing no details. You each have a distinct personality, of course, and it will color each picture considerably. But with six of you reporting, I should receive my share of vicarious enjoyment. Is it--ah--a deal?\"  Matilda assured her that it was, and, breathlessly, she wrote down the address. She thanked the librarian and then she went out to her car, whistling to herself.         *       *       *       *       *  Haron Gorka lived in what could have been an agrarian estate, except that the land no longer was being tilled. The house itself had fallen to ruin. This surprised Matilda, but she did not let it keep her spirits in check. Haron Gorka, the man, was what counted, and the librarian's account of him certainly had been glowing enough. Perhaps he was too busy with his cultural pursuits to pay any real attention to his dwelling. That was it, of course: the conspicuous show of wealth or personal industry meant nothing at all to Haron Gorka. Matilda liked him all the more for it.  There were five cars parked in the long driveway, and now Matilda's made the sixth. In spite of herself, she smiled. She had not been the only one with the idea to visit Haron Gorka in person. With half a dozen of them there, the laggards who resorted to posting letters would be left far behind. Matilda congratulated herself for what she thought had been her ingenuity, and which now turned out to be something which she had in common with five other women. You live and learn, thought Matilda. And then, quite annoyedly, she berated herself for not having been the first. Perhaps the other five all were satisfactory; perhaps she wouldn't be needed; perhaps she was too late....         *       *       *       *       *  As it turned out, she wasn't. Not only that, she was welcomed with open arms. Not by Haron Gorka; that she really might have liked. Instead, someone she could only regard as a menial met her, and when he asked had she come in response to the advertisement, she nodded eagerly. He told her that was fine and he ushered her straight into a room which evidently was to be her living quarters. It contained a small undersized bed, a table, and a chair, and, near a little slot in the wall, there was a button.  \"You want any food or drink,\" the servant told her, \"and you just press that button. The results will surprise you.\"  \"What about Mr. Gorka?\"  \"When he wants you, he will send for you. Meanwhile, make yourself to home, lady, and I will tell him you are here.\"  A little doubtful now, Matilda thanked him and watched him leave. He closed the door softly behind his retreating feet, but Matilda's ears had not missed the ominous click. She ran to the door and tried to open it, but it would not budge. It was locked--from the outside.  It must be said to Matilda's favor that she sobbed only once. After that she realized that what is done is done and here, past thirty, she wasn't going to be girlishly timid about it. Besides, it was not her fault if, in his unconcern, Haron Gorka had unwittingly hired a neurotic servant.  For a time Matilda paced back and forth in her room, and of what was going on outside she could hear nothing. In that case, she would pretend that there was nothing outside the little room, and presently she lay down on the bed to take a nap. This didn't last long, however: she had a nightmare in which Haron Gorka appeared as a giant with two heads, but, upon awaking with a start, she immediately ascribed that to her overwrought nerves.  At that point she remembered what the servant had said about food and she thought at once of the supreme justice she could do to a juicy beefsteak. Well, maybe they didn't have a beefsteak. In that case, she would take what they had, and, accordingly, she walked to the little slot in the wall and pressed the button.  She heard the whir of machinery. A moment later there was a soft sliding sound. Through the slot first came a delicious aroma, followed almost instantly by a tray. On the tray were a bowl of turtle soup, mashed potatoes, green peas, bread, a strange cocktail, root-beer, a parfait--and a thick tenderloin sizzling in hot butter sauce.  Matilda gasped once and felt about to gasp again--but by then her salivary glands were working overtime, and she ate her meal. The fact that it was precisely what she would have wanted could, of course, be attributed to coincidence, and the further fact that everything was extremely palatable made her forget all about Haron Gorka's neurotic servant.  When she finished her meal a pleasant lethargy possessed her, and in a little while Matilda was asleep again. This time she did not dream at all. It was a deep sleep and a restful one, and when she awoke it was with the wonderful feeling that everything was all right.         *       *       *       *       *  The feeling did not last long. Standing over her was Haron Gorka's servant, and he said, \"Mr. Gorka will see you now.\"  \"Now?\"  \"Now. That's what you're here for, isn't it?\"  He had a point there, but Matilda hardly even had time to fix her hair. She told the servant so.  \"Miss,\" he replied, \"I assure you it will not matter in the least to Haron Gorka. You are here and he is ready to see you and that is all that matters.\"  \"You sure?\" Matilda wanted to take no chances.  \"Yes. Come.\"  She followed him out of the little room and across what should have been a spacious dining area, except that everything seemed covered with dust. Of the other women Matilda could see nothing, and she suddenly realized that each of them probably had a cubicle of a room like her own, and that each in her turn had already had her first visit with Haron Gorka. Well, then, she must see to it that she impressed him better than did all the rest, and, later, when she returned to tell the old librarian of her adventures, she "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51286"],["title","Pen Pal (#2)"],["body","perhaps draw her out and compare notes.  She would not admit even to herself that she was disappointed with Haron Gorka. It was not that he was homely and unimpressive; it was just that he was so _ordinary_-looking. She almost would have preferred the monster of her dreams.         *       *       *       *       *  He wore a white linen suit and he had mousy hair, drab eyes, an almost-Roman nose, a petulant mouth with the slight arch of the egotist at each corner.  He said, \"Greetings. You have come--\"  \"In response to your ad. How do you do, Mr. Gorka?\"  She hoped she wasn't being too formal. But, then, there was no sense in assuming that he would like informality. She could only wait and see and adjust her own actions to suit him. Meanwhile, it would be best to keep on the middle of the road.  \"I am fine. Are you ready?\"  \"Ready?\"  \"Certainly. You came in response to my ad. You want to hear me talk, do you not?\"  \"I--do.\" Matilda had had visions of her prince charming sitting back and relaxing with her, telling her of the many things he had done and seen. But first she certainly would have liked to get to _know_ the man. Well, Haron Gorka obviously had more experience along these lines than she did. He waited, however, as if wondering what to say, and Matilda, accustomed to social chatter, gave him a gambit.  \"I must admit I was surprised when I got exactly what I wanted for dinner,\" she told him brightly.  \"Eh? What say? Oh, yes, naturally. A combination of telepathy and teleportation. The synthetic cookery is attuned to your mind when you press the buzzer, and the strength of your psychic impulses determines how closely the meal will adjust to your desires. The fact that the adjustment here was near perfect is commendable. It means either that you have a high psi-quotient, or that you were very hungry.\"  \"Yes,\" said Matilda vaguely. Perhaps it might be better, after all, if Haron Gorka were to talk to her as he saw fit.  \"Ready?\"  \"Uh--ready.\"  \"Well?\"  \"Well, what, Mr. Gorka?\"  \"What would you like me to talk about?\"  \"Oh, anything.\"  \"Please. As the ad read, my universal experience--is universal. Literally. You'll have to be more specific.\"  \"Well, why don't you tell me about some of your far travels? Unfortunately, while I've done a lot of reading, I haven't been to all the places I would have liked--\"  \"Good enough. You know, of course, how frigid Deneb VII is?\"  Matilda said, \"Beg pardon?\"  \"Well, there was the time our crew--before I had retired, of course--made a crash landing there. We could survive in the vac-suits, of course, but the _thlomots_ were after us almost at once. They go mad over plastic. They will eat absolutely any sort of plastic. Our vac-suits--\"  \"--were made of plastic,\" Matilda suggested. She did not understand a thing he was talking about, but she felt she had better act bright.  \"No, no. Must you interrupt? The air-hose and the water feed, these were plastic. Not the rest of the suit. The point is that half of us were destroyed before the rescue ship could come, and the remainder were near death. I owe my life to the mimicry of a _flaak_ from Capella III. It assumed the properties of plastic and led the _thlomots_ a merry chase across the frozen surface of D VII. You travel in the Deneb system now and Interstellar Ordinance makes it mandatory to carry _flaaks_ with you. Excellent idea, really excellent.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Almost at once, Matilda's educational background should have told her that Haron Gorka was mouthing gibberish. But on the other hand she _wanted_ to believe in him and the result was that it took until now for her to realize it.  \"Stop making fun of me,\" she said.  \"So, naturally, you'll see _flaaks_ all over that system--\"  \"Stop!\"  \"What's that? Making fun of you?\" Haron Gorka's voice had been so eager as he spoke, high-pitched, almost like a child's, and now he seemed disappointed. He smiled, but it was a sad smile, a smile of resignation, and he said, \"Very well. I'm wrong again. You are the sixth, and you're no better than the other five. Perhaps you are even more outspoken. When you see my wife, tell her to come back. Again she is right and I am wrong....\"  Haron Gorka turned his back.  Matilda could do nothing but leave the room, walk back through the house, go outside and get into her car. She noticed not without surprise that the other five cars were now gone. She was the last of Haron Gorka's guests to depart.  As she shifted into reverse and pulled out of the driveway, she saw the servant leaving, too. Far down the road, he was walking slowly. Then Haron Gorka had severed that relationship, too, and now he was all alone.  As she drove back to town, the disappointment melted slowly away. There were, of course, two alternatives. Either Haron Gorka was an eccentric who enjoyed this sort of outlandish tomfoolery, or else he was plainly insane. She could still picture him ranting on aimlessly to no one in particular about places which had no existence outside of his mind, his voice high-pitched and eager.         *       *       *       *       *  It was not until she had passed the small library building that she remembered what she had promised the librarian. In her own way, the aging woman would be as disappointed as Matilda, but a promise was a promise, and Matilda turned the car in a wide U-turn and parked it outside the library.  The woman sat at her desk as Matilda had remembered her, gray, broom-stick figure, rigid. But now when she saw Matilda she perked up visibly.  \"Hello, my dear,\" she said.  \"Hi.\"  \"You're back a bit sooner than I expected. But, then, the other five have returned, too, and I imagine your story will be similar.\"  \"I don't know what they told you,\" Matilda said. \"But this is what happened to me.\"  She quickly then related everything which had happened, completely and in detail. She did this first because it was a promise, and second because she knew it would make her feel better.  \"So,\" she finished, \"Haron Gorka is either extremely eccentric or insane. I'm sorry.\"  \"He's neither,\" the librarian contradicted. \"Perhaps he is slightly eccentric by your standards, but really, my dear, he is neither.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Did he leave a message for his wife?\"  \"Why, yes. Yes, he did. But how did you know? Oh, I suppose he told the five.\"  \"No. He didn't. But you were the last and I thought he would give you a message for his wife--\"  Matilda didn't understand. She didn't understand at all, but she told the little librarian what the message was. \"He wanted her to return,\" she said.  The librarian nodded, a happy smile on her lips. \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you something.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"I am Mrs. Gorka.\"  The librarian stood up and came around the desk. She opened a drawer and took out her hat and perched it jauntily atop her gray hair. \"You see, my dear, Haron expects too much. He expects entirely too much.\"  Matilda did not say a word. One madman a day would be quite enough for anybody, but here she found herself confronted with two.  \"We've been tripping for centuries, visiting every habitable star system from our home near Canopus. But Haron is too demanding. He says I am a finicky traveler, that he could do much better alone, the accommodations have to be just right for me, and so forth. When he loses his temper, he tries to convince me that any number of females of the particular planet would be more than thrilled if they were given the opportunity just to listen to him.  \"But he's wrong. It's a hard life for a woman. Someday--five thousand, ten thousand years from now--I will convince him. And then we will settle down on Canopus XIV and cultivate _torgas_. That would be so nice--\"  \"I'm sure.\"  \"Well, if Haron wants me back, then I have to go. Have a care, my dear. If you marry, choose a home-body. I've had the experience and you've seen my Haron for yourself.\"  And then the woman was gone. Numbly, Matilda walked to the doorway and watched her angular figure disappear down the road. Of all the crazy things....  Deneb and Capella and Canopus, these were stars. Add a number and you might have a planet revolving about each star. Of all the insane--  They were mad, all right, and now Matilda wondered if, actually, they were husband and wife. It could readily be; maybe the madness was catching. Maybe if you thought too much about such things, such travels, you could get that way. Of course, Herman represented the other extreme, and Herman was even worse in his own way--but hereafter Matilda would seek the happy medium.  And, above all else, she had had enough of her pen pal columns. They were, she realized, for kids.         *       *       *       *       *  She ate dinner in Cedar Falls and then she went out to her car again, preparing for the journey back home. The sun had set and it was a clear night, and overhead the great broad sweep of the Milky Way was a pale rainbow bridge in the sky.  Matilda paused. Off in the distance there was a glow on the horizon, and that was the direction of Haron Gorka's place.  The glow increased; soon it was a bright red pulse pounding on the horizon. It flickered. It flickered again, and finally it was gone.  The stars were white and brilliant in the clear country air. That was why Matilda liked the country better than the city, particularly on a clear summer night when you could see the span of the Milky Way.  But abruptly the stars and the Milky Way were paled by the brightest shooting star Matilda had ever seen. It flashed suddenly and it remained in view for a full second, searing a bright orange path across the night sky.  Matilda gasped and ran into her car. She started the gears and pressed the accelerator to the floor, keeping it there all the way home.  It was the first time she had ever seen a shooting star going _up_."]]]
