A tiny detail persisted in bulking larger and larger in her mind--the unnaturalness of the way the Earth had impregnated the corner of Ivan's briefcase, almost as if dirt and leather co-existed in the same space. She remembered the queer way the partly buried briefcase had resisted her first tug, like a rooted plant.  She felt cowed by the mysterious night about her, and literally dwarfed, as if she had grown several inches shorter. She roused herself and started forward.  Something held her feet.  They were ankle-deep in the path. While she looked in fright and horror, they began to sink still lower into the ground.  She plunged frantically, trying to jerk loose. She couldn't. She had the panicky feeling that the Earth had not only trapped but invaded her; that its molecules were creeping up between the molecules of her flesh; that the two were becoming one.  And she was sinking faster. Now knee-deep, thigh-deep, hip-deep, waist-deep. She beat at the powdery path with her hands and threw her body from side to side in agonized frenzy like some sinner frozen in the ice of the innermost circle of the ancients' hell. And always the sense of the dark, grainy tide rose inside as well as around her.  She thought, _he'd just have had time to scribble that note on his briefcase and toss it away._ She jerked off a glove, leaned out as far as she could, and made a frantic effort to drive its fingers into the powdery path. Then the Earth mounted to her chin, her nose, and covered her eyes.  She expected blackness, but it was as if the light of the path stayed with her, making a little glow all around. She saw roots, pebbles, black rot, worn tunnels, worms. Tier on tier of them, her vision penetrating the solid ground. And at the same time, the knowledge that these same sorts of things were coursing up through her.         *       *       *       *       *  And still she continued to sink at a speed that increased, as if the law of gravitation applied to her in a diminished way. She dropped from black soil through gray clay and into pale limestone.  Her tortured, rock-permeated lungs sucked at rock and drew in air. She wondered madly if a volume of air were falling with her through the stone.  A glitter of quartz. The momentary openness of a foot-high cavern with a trickle of water. And then she was sliding down a black basalt column, half inside it, half inside gold-flecked ore. Then just black basalt. And always faster.  It grew hot, then hotter, as if she were approaching the mythical eternal fires.         *       *       *       *       *  At first glance Theodor thought the Deep Space Bar was empty. Then he saw a figure hunched monkeylike on the last stool, almost lost in the blue shadows, while behind the bar, her crystal dress blending with the tiers of sparkling glasses, stood a grave-eyed young girl who could hardly have been fifteen.  The TV was saying, \"... in addition, a number of mysterious disappearances of high-rating individuals have been reported. These are thought to be cases of misunderstanding, illusory apprehension, and impulse traveling--a result of the unusual stresses of the time. Finally, a few suggestible individuals in various parts of the globe, especially the Indian Peninsula, have declared themselves to be 'gods' and in some way responsible for current events.  \"It is thought--\"  The girl switched off the TV and took Theodor's order, explaining casually, \"Joe wanted to go to a Kometevskyite meeting, so I took over for him.\" When she had prepared Theodor's highball, she announced, \"I'll have a drink with you gentlemen,\" and squeezed herself a glass of pomegranate juice.  The monkeylike figure muttered, \"Scotch-and-soda,\" then turned toward Edmund and asked, \"And what is your reaction to all this, sir?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Theodor recognized the shrunken wrinkle-seamed face. It was Colonel Fortescue, a military antique long retired from the Peace Patrol and reputed to have seen actual fighting in the Last Age of Madness. Now, for some reason, the face sported a knowing smile.  Theodor shrugged. Just then the TV \"big news\" light blinked blue and the girl switched on audio. The Colonel winked at Theodor.  \"... confirming the disappearance of Jupiter's moons. But two other utterly fantastic reports have just been received. First, Lunar Observatory One says that it is visually tracking fourteen small bodies which it believes may be the lost moons of Jupiter. They are moving outward from the Solar System at an incredible velocity and are already beyond the orbit of Saturn!\"  The Colonel said, \"Ah!\"  \"Second, Palomar reports a large number of dark bodies approaching the Solar System at an equally incredible velocity. They are at about twice the distance of Pluto, but closing in fast! We will be on the air with further details as soon as possible.\"  The Colonel said, \"Ah-ha!\"  Theodor stared at him. The old man's self-satisfied poise was almost amusing.  \"Are you a Kometevskyite?\" Theodor asked him.  The Colonel laughed. \"Of course not, my boy. Those poor people are fumbling in the dark. Don't you see what's happened?\"  \"Frankly, no.\"  The Colonel leaned toward Theodor and whispered gruffly, \"The Divine Plan. God is a military strategist, naturally.\"  Then he lifted the scotch-and-soda in his clawlike hand and took a satisfying swallow.  \"I knew it all along, of course,\" he went on musingly, \"but this last news makes it as plain as a rocket blast, at least to anyone who knows military strategy. Look here, my boy, suppose you were commanding a fleet and got wind of the enemy's approach--what would you do? Why, you'd send your scouts and destroyers fanning out toward them. Behind that screen you'd mass your heavy ships. Then--\"  \"You don't mean to imply--\" Theodor interrupted.  The girl behind the bar looked at them both cryptically.  \"Of course I do!\" the Colonel cut in sharply. \"It's a war between the forces of good and evil. The bright suns and planets are on one side, the dark on the other. The moons are the destroyers, Jupiter and Saturn are the big battleships, while we're on a heavy cruiser, I'm proud to say. We'll probably go into action soon. Be a corking fight, what? And all by divine strategy!\"  He chuckled and took another big drink. Theodor looked at him sourly. The girl behind the bar polished a glass and said nothing.         *       *       *       *       *  Dotty suddenly began to turn and toss, and a look of terror came over her sleeping face. Celeste leaned forward apprehensively.  The child's lips worked and Celeste made out the sleepy-fuzzy words: \"They've found out where we're hiding. They're coming to get us. No! Please, no!\"  Celeste's reactions were mixed. She felt worried about Dotty and at the same time almost in terror of her, as if the little girl were an agent of supernatural forces. She told herself that this fear was an expression of her own hostility, yet she didn't really believe it. She touched the child's hand.  Dotty's eyes opened without making Celeste feel she had quite come awake. After a bit she looked at Celeste and her little lips parted in a smile.  \"Hello,\" she said sleepily. \"I've been having such funny dreams.\" Then, after a pause, frowning, \"I really am a god, you know. It feels very queer.\"  \"Yes, dear?\" Celeste prompted uneasily. \"Shall I call Frieda?\"  The smile left Dotty's lips. \"Why do you act so nervous around me?\" she asked. \"Don't you love me, Mummy?\"  Celeste started at the word. Her throat closed. Then, very slowly, her face broke into a radiant smile. \"Of course I do, darling. I love you very much.\"  Dotty nodded happily, her eyes already closed again.  There was a sudden flurry of excited voices beyond the door. Celeste heard her name called. She stood up.  \"I'm going to have to go out and talk with the others,\" she said. \"If you want me, dear, just call.\"  \"Yes, Mummy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Edmund rapped for attention. Celeste, Frieda, and Theodor glanced around at him. He looked more frightfully strained, they realized, than even they felt. His expression was a study in suppressed excitement, but there were also signs of a knowledge that was almost too overpowering for a human being to bear.  His voice was clipped, rapid. \"I think it's about time we stopped worrying about our own affairs and thought of those of the Solar System, partly because I think they have a direct bearing on the disappearances of Ivan end Rosalind. As I told you, I've been sorting out the crucial items from the material we've been presenting. There are roughly four of those items, as I see it. It's rather like a mystery story. I wonder if, hearing those four clues, you will come to the same conclusion I have.\"  The others nodded.  \"First, there are the latest reports from Deep Shaft, which, as you know, has been sunk to investigate deep-Earth conditions. At approximately twenty-nine miles below the surface, the delvers have encountered a metallic obstruction which they have tentatively named the durasphere. It resists their hardest drills, their strongest corrosives. They have extended a side-tunnel at that level for a quarter of a mile. Delicate measurements, made possible by the mirror-smooth metal surface, show that the durasphere has a slight curvature that is almost exactly equal to the curvature of the Earth itself. The suggestion is that deep borings made anywhere in the world would encounter the durasphere at the same depth.  \"Second, the movements of the moons of Mars and Jupiter, and particularly the debris left behind by the moons of Mars. Granting Phobos and Deimos had duraspheres proportional in size to that of Earth, then the debris would roughly equal in amount the material in those two duraspheres' rocky envelopes. The suggestion is that the two duraspheres suddenly burst from their envelopes with such titanic velocity as to leave those disrupted envelopes "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51353"],["title","Dr. Kometevsky's Day (#3)"],["body","behind.\"  It was deadly quiet in the committee room.  \"Thirdly, the disappearances of Ivan and Rosalind, and especially the baffling hint--from Ivan's message in one case and Rosalind's downward-pointing glove in the other--that they were both somehow drawn into the depths of the Earth.  \"Finally, the dreams of the ESPs, which agree overwhelmingly in the following points: A group of beings separate themselves from a godlike and telepathic race because they insist on maintaining a degree of mental privacy. They flee in great boats or ships of some sort. They are pursued on such a scale that there is no hiding place for them anywhere in the universe. In some manner they successfully camouflage their ships. Eons pass and their still-fanatical pursuers do not penetrate their secret. Then, suddenly, they are detected.\"  Edmund waited. \"Do you see what I'm driving at?\" he asked hoarsely.         *       *       *       *       *  He could tell from their looks that the others did, but couldn't bring themselves to put it into words.  \"I suppose it's the time-scale and the value-scale that are so hard for us to accept,\" he said softly. \"Much more, even, than the size-scale. The thought that there are creatures in the Universe to whom the whole career of Man--in fact, the whole career of life--is no more than a few thousand or hundred thousand years. And to whom Man is no more than a minor stage property--a trifling part of a clever job of camouflage.\"  This time he went on, \"Fantasy writers have at times hinted all sorts of odd things about the Earth--that it might even be a kind of single living creature, or honeycombed with inhabited caverns, and so on. But I don't know that any of them have ever suggested that the Earth, together with all the planets and moons of the Solar System, might be....\"  In a whisper, Frieda finished for him, \"... a camouflaged fleet of gigantic spherical spaceships.\"  \"_Your guess happens to be the precise truth._\"  At that familiar, yet dreadly unfamiliar voice, all four of them swung toward the inner door. Dotty was standing there, a sleep-stupefied little girl with a blanket caught up around her and dragging behind. Their own daughter. But in her eyes was a look from which they cringed.  She said, \"I am a creature somewhat older than what your geologists call the Archeozoic Era. I am speaking to you through a number of telepathically sensitive individuals among your kind. In each case my thoughts suit themselves to your level of comprehension. I inhabit the disguised and jetless spaceship which is your Earth.\"  Celeste swayed a step forward. \"Baby....\" she implored.  Dotty went on, without giving her a glance, \"It is true that we planted the seeds of life on some of these planets simply as part of our camouflage, just as we gave them a suitable environment for each. And it is true that now we must let most of that life be destroyed. Our hiding place has been discovered, our pursuers are upon us, and we must make one last effort to escape or do battle, since we firmly believe that the principle of mental privacy to which we have devoted our existence is perhaps the greatest good in the whole Universe.  \"But it is not true that we look with contempt upon you. Our whole race is deeply devoted to life, wherever it may come into being, and it is our rule never to interfere with its development. That was one of the reasons we made life a part of our camouflage--it would make our pursuers reluctant to examine these planets too closely.  \"Yes, we have always cherished you and watched your evolution with interest from our hidden lairs. We may even unconsciously have shaped your development in certain ways, trying constantly to educate you away from war and finally succeeding--which may have given the betraying clue to our pursuers.  \"Your planets must be burst asunder--this particular planet in the area of the Pacific--so that we may have our last chance to escape. Even if we did not move, our pursuers would destroy you with us. We cannot invite you inside our ships--not for lack of space, but because you could never survive the vast accelerations to which you would be subjected. You would, you see, need very special accommodations, of which we have enough only for a few.  \"Those few we will take with us, as the seed from which a new human race may--if we ourselves somehow survive--be born.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Rosalind and Ivan stared dumbly at each other across the egg-shaped silver room, without apparent entrance or exit, in which they were sprawled. But their thoughts were no longer of thirty-odd mile journeys down through solid earth, or of how cool it was after the heat of the passage, or of how grotesque it was to be trapped here, the fragment of a marriage. They were both listening to the voice that spoke inside their minds.  \"In a few minutes your bodies will be separated into layers one atom thick, capable of being shelved or stored in such a way as to endure almost infinite accelerations. Single cells will cover acres of space. But do not be alarmed. The process will be painless and each particle will be catalogued for future assembly. Your consciousness will endure throughout the process.\"  Rosalind looked at her gold-shod toes. She was wondering, _will they go first, or my head? Or will I be peeled like an apple?_  She looked at Ivan and knew he was thinking the same thing.         *       *       *       *       *  Up in the committee room, the other Wolvers slumped around the table. Only little Dotty sat straight and staring, speechless and unanswering, quite beyond their reach, like a telephone off the hook and with the connection open, but no voice from the other end.  They had just switched off the TV after listening to a confused medley of denials, prayers, Kometevskyite chatterings, and a few astonishingly realistic comments on the possibility of survival.  These last pointed out that, on the side of the Earth opposite the Pacific, the convulsions would come slowly when the entombed spaceship burst forth--provided, as seemed the case, that it moved without jets or reaction.  It would be as if the Earth's vast core simply vanished. Gravity would diminish abruptly to a fraction of its former value. The empty envelope of rock and water and air would slowly fall together, though at the same time the air would begin to escape from the debris because there would no longer be the mass required to hold it.  However, there might be definite chances of temporary and even prolonged survival for individuals in strong, hermetically sealed structures, such as submarines and spaceships. The few spaceships on Earth were reported to have blasted off, or be preparing to leave, with as many passengers as could be carried.  But most persons, apparently, could not contemplate action of any sort. They could only sit and think, like the Wolvers.  A faint smile relaxed Celeste's face. She was thinking, _how beautiful! It means the death of the Solar System, which is a horrifying subjective concept. Objectively, though, it would be a more awesome sight than any human being has ever seen or ever could see. It's an absurd and even brutal thing to wish--but I wish I could see the whole cataclysm from beginning to end. It would make death seem very small, a tiny personal event._  Dotty's face was losing its blank expression, becoming intent and alarmed.  \"We are in contact with our pursuers,\" she said in the familiar-unfamiliar voice. \"Negotiations are now going on. There seems to be--there _is_ a change in them. Where they were harsh and vindictive before, they now are gentle and conciliatory.\" She paused, the alarm on her childish features pinching into anxious uncertainty. \"Our pursuers have always been shrewd. The change in them may be false, intended merely to lull us into allowing them to come close enough to destroy us. We must not fall into the trap by growing hopeful....\"  They leaned forward, clutching hands, watching the little face as though it were a television screen. Celeste had the wild feeling that she was listening to a communique from a war so unthinkably vast and violent, between opponents so astronomically huge and nearly immortal, that she felt like no more than a reasoning ameba ... and then realized with an explosive urge to laugh that that was exactly the situation.  \"No!\" said Dotty. Her eyes began to glow. \"They _have_ changed! During the eons in which we lay sealed away and hidden from them, knowing nothing of them, they have rebelled against the tyranny of a communal mind to which no thoughts are private ... the tyranny that we ourselves fled to escape. They come not to destroy us, but to welcome us back to a society that we and they can make truly great!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Frieda collapsed to a chair, trembling between laughter and hysterical weeping. Theodor looked as blank as Dotty had while waiting for words to speak. Edmund sprang to the picture window, Celeste toward the TV set.  Climbing shakily out of the chair, Frieda stumbled to the picture window and peered out beside Edmund. She saw lights bobbing along the paths with a wild excitement.  On the TV screen, Celeste watched two brightly lit ships spinning in the sky--whether human spaceships or Phobos and Deimos come to help Earth rejoice, she couldn't tell.  Dotty spoke again, the joy in her strange voice forcing them to turn. \"And you, dear children, creatures of our camouflage, we welcome you--whatever your future career on these planets or like ones--into the society of enlightened worlds! You need not feel small and alone and helpless ever again, for we shall always be with you!\"  The outer door opened. Ivan and Rosalind reeled in, drunkenly smiling, arm in arm.  \"Like rockets,\" Rosalind blurted happily. \"We came through the durasphere and solid rock ... shot up right to the surface.\"  \"They didn't have to take us along,\" Ivan added with a bleary grin. \"But you"]]]
