Three years later, an angel, calling himself Moroni, appeared to this youth and explained that he was a resurrected being who had formerly lived on this continent in the flesh. Telling the boy Joseph of a sacred record hidden in a hill near by, the angel met him on the hillside where the precious charge lay concealed in a stone box, and after repeated admonitions during the four subsequent years, delivered to him some gold plates and an instrument called a Urim and Thummim, with which to translate the inspired hieroglyphics.  \"After much delay and a great deal of persecution, the youth succeeded in reproducing from the gold plates the record known as the Book of Mormon, now published to the world these three years.  \"Two years and two months ago, having received authority under the hands of John the Baptist, as also from Peter, James and John, the ancient apostles, this modern Prophet, in accordance with directions from the Lord, organized the true Church of Christ, at Fayette, Seneca County, in the State of New York.  \"The next fall after the Church was set up, three missionaries came west with the intention of introducing the work among the Indians, who are descended from an ancient people of whom the Book of Mormon gives the history; and on their way came among an earnest body of worshippers at Kirtland, Ohio. These read the book, believed the testimony, and received baptism to the number of several hundred souls.  \"Receiving a visit from a number of these converts, the Prophet himself has removed with his family to Kirtland, where he now lives with a number of his followers.  \"It has, moreover, been revealed to the Prophet that the ancient site of the Garden of Eden is on this continent, and that the building of the New Jerusalem is to commence at that sacred spot. Accordingly, the converts to the new faith are gathering from all directions into Independence, Missouri, where about four hundred of them are now settled.\"  Interesting as this narrative is to us, though we have heard it for the hundredth time, how much more interesting must it have been to David W. Patten, for it was all new to him. Drinking it in with his whole soul, he received the truth with joy, and was led into the waters of baptism on the 15th day of June, 1832.  With the most of men there is lingering in the very heart of their faith a grain of doubt. Even the missionary, no doubt, feels easier in placing himself in the hands of the Lord, when he knows that if no place is furnished him to sleep, he can with the dollar in his pocket provide for himself. And so it is with each of us at times. It seems as though we cannot free ourselves from the millstone of doubt, and take the Lord at His word when He says He will provide for those who trust Him. This was not the case, however, with David W. Patten. He stood six feet and one inch in height, and weighed over two hundred pounds; but there seems to have been no room in his whole generous composition for a particle of doubt. He took the Lord at His word and devoted his whole life to His service; and whether face to face with Cain, or baring his breast to an infuriated mob, a doubt that the Lord was with him seems thenceforth never to have entered his mind.  Two days after his baptism David was ordained an Elder under the hands of Elisha H. Groves, and with Joseph Wood, another recent convert, as a companion, was given a mission to the Territory of Michigan.    II.  His procedure in administering to the sick--Testimony as to his success--Visits the Prophet--Missionary labors--Casts out a \"devil\"--His family baptized--Mrs. Strong healed--Called to Jackson County.  Those who have had a like experience, will know with what joy the new convert returned to his friends in the wilderness. All business was laid aside. With his companion, David traveled through all the country round about preaching the Gospel and healing the sick.  Immediately upon taking up his labors in Michigan, in calling at the house of a stranger to ask for dinner, David found in the family a very sick child, and while discussing the restoration of the Gospel with the parents, was asked to administer to the little one. Finding the mother had faith, he did so, and it was at once healed.  In administering the healing ordinance David had a method of procedure peculiarly his own. On reaching the beside, he would first teach the principles of the Gospel and bear his testimony to their truth, when he usually made a promise that the invalid should be healed if he would agree to accept baptism. President Abraham O. Smoot, of Utah Stake, once said he never knew an instance in which David's petition for the sick was not answered, and this was also the testimony of President Wilford Woodruff.  At the close of one of his meetings in Michigan, where he had no doubt spoken of the gift of healing, two children sick of fever and ague were brought to the meeting-house to be healed. David had started off, but was called back and upon learning from the parents of their faith, acceded to their request, and the children were healed instantly.  Until the latter part of September David and his companion labored in Southeastern Michigan, baptizing sixteen persons in a branch of the Maumee River during that time. Late in the summer they took up a journey to Kirtland, preaching by the way.  Perhaps the first person they met at Kirtland was Elder Joseph C. Kingsbury, for they inquired of him at Newel K. Whitney's store the way to the home of the Prophet Joseph. It was early in October; the Prophet was on a mission east, and while waiting his return, David spent the next two or three weeks on the Prophet's farm, helping to dig potatoes and harvest corn.  Soon after the return of the Prophet Joseph Smith, David W. Patten was sent into Pennsylvania on his second mission, traveling sometimes with John Murdock as a companion, and at other times with Reynolds Cahoon.  The Prophet, in sending out these early missionaries, had no particular field of labor in mind for any of them. They were sent to warn all men, but their message was specially to the honest in heart, and these they had no way of finding except by the inspiration of the Lord. Just at this time a large number of Elders had been sent east from Kirtland in response to the revelation of September 22, 1832, from which we quote as follows:   \"62. Go ye into all the world, and whatsoever place ye cannot go into  ye shall send, that the testimony may go from you into all the world  unto every creature.   \"63. And as I said unto mine apostles, even so I say unto you, for you  are mine apostles, even God's High Priests; ye are they whom my Father  hath given me--ye are my friends;   \"64. Therefore, as I said unto mine apostles I say unto you again,  that every soul who believeth on your words, and is baptized by water  for the remission of sins, shall receive the Holy Ghost;   \"65. And these signs shall follow them that believe.   \"66. In my name they shall do many wonderful works;   \"67. In my name they shall cast out devils;   \"68. In my name they shall heal the sick;   \"69. In my name they shall open the eyes of the blind, and unstop the  ears of the deaf;   \"70. And the tongue of the dumb shall speak;   \"71. And if any man shall administer poison unto them it shall not  hurt them;   \"72. And the poison of a serpent shall not have power to harm them.   \"73. But a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not boast  themselves of these things, neither speak them before the world, for  these things are given unto you for your profit and for salvation.   \"74. Verily, verily, I say unto you they who believe not on your  words, and are not baptized in water, in my name, for the remission of  their sins, that they may receive the Holy Ghost, shall be damned, and  shall not come into my Father's kingdom, where my Father and I am.   \"75. And this revelation unto you, and commandment, is in force from  this very hour upon all the world, and the gospel is unto all who have  not received it.   \"76. But, verily, I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been  given, from you it must be preached unto them, that they shall repent  of their former evil works, for they are to be upbraided for their  evil hearts of unbelief; and your brethren in Zion for their rebellion  against you at the time I sent you.   \"77. And again I say unto you, my friends, (for from henceforth I  shall call you friends,) it is expedient that I give unto you this  commandment, that ye become even as my friends in days when I was with  them traveling to preach the gospel in my power,   \"78. For I suffered them not to have purse or scrip, neither two coats;   \"79. Behold I send you out to prove the world, and the laborer is  worthy of his hire.   \"80. And any man that shall go and preach this gospel of the kingdom,  and fail not to continue faithful in all things shall not be weary in  mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint: and an hair  on his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed. And they shall not  go hungry, neither athirst.   \"81. Therefore, take no thought for the morrow, for what ye shall eat,  or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed;   \"82. For consider the lilies of the field, how they grow, they toil  not, neither do they spin; and the kingdoms of the world, in all their  glory, are not arrayed like one of these;   \"83. For your Father who art in heaven, knoweth that you have need of  all these things.   \"84. Therefore, let the morrow take thought for the things of itself.   \"85. Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say, but  treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall  be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto  every man.   \"86. Therefore let no man among you, (for this commandment is unto all  the faithful who are called of God in the church unto the ministry,)  from this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51730"],["title","Life of David W.

Behold, I send you out to reprove the world of all their  unrighteous deeds, and to teach them of a judgment which is to come.   \"88. And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go  before your face: I will be on your right hand and on your left, and  my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to  bear you up.   \"89. Whoso receiveth you receiveth me, and the same will feed you, and  clothe you, and give you money.   \"90. And he who feeds you, or clothes you or gives you money, shall in  no wise lose his reward:   \"91. And he that doeth not these things is not my disciple; by this  you may know my disciples.   \"92. He that receiveth you not, go away from him alone by yourselves,  and cleanse your feet even with water, pure water, whether in heat or  in cold, and bear testimony of it unto your Father which is in heaven,  and return not again unto that man.   \"93. And in whatsoever village or city ye enter, do likewise.   \"94. Nevertheless, search diligently and spare not; and wo unto that  house, or that village or city that rejecteth you, or your words, or  your testimony concerning me.   \"95. Wo, I say again, unto that house, or that village or city that  rejecteth you, or your words, or your testimony of me.   \"96. For I the Almighty, have laid my hands upon the nations, to  scourge them for their wickedness:   \"97. And plagues shall go forth, and they shall not be taken from  the earth until I have completed my work which shall be cut short in  righteousness,   \"98. Until all shall know me, who remain, even from the least unto  the greatest, and shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, and  shall see eye to eye, and shall lift up their voice, and with the  voice together sing this new song, saying--   \"99. The Lord hath brought again Zion; The Lord hath redeemed his  people, Israel, According to the election of grace, Which was brought  to pass by the faith And covenant of their fathers.   \"100. The Lord hath redeemed his people, And Satan is bound and time  is no longer: The Lord hath gathered all things in one: The Lord hath  brought down Zion from above. The Lord hath brought up Zion from  beneath.   \"101. The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength: And  truth is established in her bowels: And the heavens have smiled upon  her: And she is clothed with the glory of her God: For he stands in  the midst of his people:   \"102. Glory, and honor, and power, and might, Be ascribed to our God;  for he is full of mercy, Justice, grace and truth, and peace, For ever  and ever, Amen.   \"103. And again, verily, verily I say unto you, it is expedient that  every man who goes forth to proclaim mine everlasting gospel, that  inasmuch as they have families, and receive monies by gift that they  should send it unto them or make use of it for their benefit, as the  Lord shall direct them, for thus it seemeth me good.   \"104. And let all those who have not families, who receive monies,  send it up unto the Bishop in Zion, or unto the Bishop in Ohio, that  it may be consecrated for the bringing forth of the revelations and  the printing thereof, and for establishing Zion.   \"105. And if any man shall give unto any of you a coat, or a suit,  take the old and cast it unto the poor, and go your way rejoicing.   \"106. And if any man among you be strong in the Spirit, let him take  with him he that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that  he may become strong also.   \"107. Therefore, take with you those who are ordained unto the lesser  priesthood, and send them before you to make appointments, and to  prepare the way, and to fill appointments that you yourselves are not  able to fill.   \"108. Behold, this is the way that mine apostles, in ancient days,  built up my church unto me.   \"109. Therefore, let every man stand in his own office, and labor in  his own calling; and let not the head say unto the feet, it hath no  need of the feet, for without the feet how shall the body be able to  stand?   \"110. Also the body hath need of every member, that all may be edified  together, that the system may be kept perfect.   \"111. And behold the High Priests should travel, and also the elders,  and also the lesser priests; but the deacons and teachers should be  appointed to watch over the church, to be standing ministers unto the  church.   \"112. And the bishop, Newel K. Whitney, also, should travel round  about and among all the churches, searching after the poor to  administer to their wants by humbling the rich and the proud;   \"113. He should also employ an agent to take charge and to do his  secular business as he shall direct.   \"114. Nevertheless, let the bishop go unto the city of New York,  also to the city of Albany, and also to the city of Boston, and warn  the people of those cities with the sound of the gospel, with a loud  voice, of the desolation and utter abolishment which await them if  they do reject these things;   \"115. For if they do reject these things the hour of their judgment is  nigh, and their house shall be left unto them desolate.   \"116. Let him trust in me and he shall not be confounded; and an hair  of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed.   \"117. And verily I say unto you, the rest of my servants, go ye forth  as your circumstances shall permit, in your several callings unto  the great and notable cities and villages, reproving the world in  righteousness of all their unrighteous and ungodly deeds, setting  forth clearly and understandingly the desolation of abomination in the  last days.   \"118. For with you saith the Lord Almighty, I will rend their  kingdoms: I will not only shake the earth, but the starry heavens  shall tremble;   \"119. For I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exert the powers of  heaven; ye cannot see it now, yet a little while and ye shall see it,  and know that I am, and that I will come and reign with my people.   \"120. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. Amen.\"--Doc.  and Cov. Sec. 84.  On the 9th of November, in eastern Ohio, David fell in with John F. Boynton and Zebedee Coltrin, who like himself were uncertain as to their course, and the three thereupon held a council of inquiry. Agreeing that Zebedee Coltrin should be mouth, the three went into a wood near by and knelt in prayer. They were directed to go eastward, preaching as they went. This they did, and David adds, \"the Spirit of God leading us.\" Several persons were baptized on their way.  At Springfield, Pa., David met Hyrum Smith and his brother William, and joined them in holding services. After meeting, six persons were baptized. David's gift of healing the sick was in constant demand. People came to him from all the country round, and it was a dally occurrence for the sick to be healed under his administrations. One woman, who had been an invalid for twenty years, was healed instantly.  After four months' labor in and about Pennsylvania, David returned to Kirtland, arriving there February 25, 1833.  David was a man of great physical strength. While on his third mission, which was undertaken after a month's rest at Kirtland, he and Reynolds Cahoon had an appointment to preach at the house of Father Bosley, at Avon, Ohio.  Several meetings had been held here before by other Elders, and among the assembled neighbors, was a man known as the \"County Bully,\" who was the source of a great deal of annoyance to the speakers.  Sitting by the door in the hallway, this man would, every little while, contradict the speaker, or call out some irreverent suggestion, or ask for a sign. He boisterously refused to be quiet, and on the evening of David's meeting at the house, was particularly noisy, asking David, among other things, to cast the devil out. Whether it was from a sense of humor at the fellow's unlucky remark, or because he was tired of the disturbance, we cannot say, but David finally determined to silence his persecutor.  Walking to the hallway, he quietly picked the man up bodily, carried him to the outside door, and with a swing sent the fellow about ten feet onto the wood pile. There was no more disturbance that night, and the saying was the current mirth provoker of the neighborhood for weeks afterward, that \"Patten cast out one devil, soul and body.\"  While on this mission, David assisted in converting a part of his own family. On the 20th of May, 1833, at Theresa, Indian River Falls, his brothers, Archibald and Ira, his sister Polly, his mother, and two of his brothers-in-law, Warren Parrish and Mr. Cheeseman, were led into the waters of baptism by Elder Brigham Young, who was another of the large number of missionaries sent out from Kirtland in March, 1833. David's father had died in August the previous year.  For nearly a year now David had been almost continuously in the field, preaching the Gospel and healing the sick, his power with the Lord in no wise diminishing. No credit was ever taken to himself, however, in the miracles performed, for he writes of this time:  \"The Lord did work with me wonderfully, in signs and wonders following them that believed in the fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, insomuch that the deaf were made to hear, the blind to see, and the lame were made whole. Fevers, palsies, crooked and withered limbs, and in fact all manner of diseases common to the country, were healed by the power of God, that was manifested through his servants.\"  Among those visited by him was a blind woman, the wife of Ezra Strong. It was nearly noon when David reached the house. After the usual testimony and questions respecting her faith in the Gospel, David rubbed and anointed her eyes, when immediately she was restored to sight; and so thoroughly was she healed that she prepared dinner for the household.  During this summer, under great hardship and suffering, eighty members were added to the Church under David's"]]]
