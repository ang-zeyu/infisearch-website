Meanwhile, Group C, which has just been put together again, has no memory because their secondary banks have been wiped clean. So, like children, they _learn_ from the working Group A.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Drummond's mouth hung open in shocked understanding. \"And by the time A finishes the job, C's education is complete! And it's A's turn to be stripped!\"  \"By then,\" Angus went on, \"Group C is not only ready to start stripping Group A, but has also become intellectually mature enough to begin the education of the reassembled Group B!\"  They sat still for a while, thinking it over.  \"The compulsion to do their jobs,\" McIntosh continued, \"is unchanged because the primary function banks are sealed circuits and can't be tampered with. But in each generation, they have their secondary memory circuits wiped clean and have to start all over, getting whatever general knowledge they can from the last generation.\"  Drummond snapped his fingers excitedly. \"That's why they don't know what we are! Their idea of Man had to be passed down by word of mouth. And it got all distorted in the process!\"  Angus's stare, more solicitous now, swept slowly over the prostrate robots. \"More important, that's why they developed a religion. What's the main difference between human and robotic intelligence? It's that our span of life is limited on one end by birth, the other by death--mysteries of origin and destiny that can't be explained. You see, the _ordinary_ clunker understands where _he_ came from and where he's going. But here are robots who have to struggle with those mysteries--birth and death of the conscious intellect which they themselves once knew, and forgot, and now have turned into myths.\"  \"So they start thinking in terms of religion,\" Drummond said. \"Well, that clears up the whole thing, doesn't it?\"  \"Not quite. It doesn't explain why the religion they've invented parallels ours so closely. And it doesn't tell us who Jackson is.\"  Drummond ran thick fingernails against the stubble on his cheeks. \"Jackson is my Supervisor. I shall not rust. He maketh me to adjust my joint tension--\" He stopped and frowned. \"I've heard that before somewhere, only it sounded different.\"  Angus gave him a wry, tired smile. \"Sure. It's practically the Psalm of David. Now you see why the resemblance is driving me batty.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The robots stirred. Several of them stood up and plodded into the cave. The others continued repeating their endless praise and devotion--prayers in every sense of the word except common sense.  Angus leaned back against the cliff and let the sun's heat warm him.  \"Somehow it doesn't seem fair,\" he commented unhappily.  \"What doesn't?\" Drummond asked.  \"They're so close to the Truth. Yet, after we file a report, a deactivation crew will come along and erase their beliefs. They'll have their memory banks swept clean and once more they'll be nothing but clunkers with a factory-specification job of routine work to do.\"  \"Ain't that what they're supposed to be?\"  \"But these are different. They've found something no clunker's ever had before--hope, faith, aspiration beyond death.\" He shook his head ruefully.  There was movement at the mouth of the cave and the smaller group of robots emerged from the shadows, two of them bearing a stone slab. Their steps were ceremoniously slow as they approached the ledge. Bowing, they placed the tablet at Angus's feet and backed away.  \"These are the articles of our faith, O Jackson,\" one announced. \"We have preserved them for Thy coming.\"  McIntosh stared down at the charred remains of a book. Its metal-fiber binding was shredded and fused and encrusted with the dust of ages.  Drummond knelt beside it and, with stiff fingers, brushed away the film of grime, uncovering part of the title:       OLY     BIB  E  Eagerly, Angus eased the cover back. Of the hundreds of pages it had originally contained, only flaked parts of two or three remained. The printing was scarcely legible on the moldy paper.  He read aloud those words he could discern:  \"... to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside cool waters; He....\"  Drummond jabbed Angus with a triumphant forefinger. \"They didn't invent any religion, after all!\"  \"It isn't important _how_ they got it. The fact that they accepted it--that's what's important.\" McIntosh glanced up at Drummond. \"They probably found this in the wreck of the ship they'd been in. It's easy to see they haven't used it in hundreds of generations. Instead, the gist of what's in it was passed down orally. And their basic concepts of Man and supervisor were distorted all along the way--confused with the idea of God.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gently, he let the cover fall. And a shining square of duraloid fell out.  \"It's somebody's picture!\" Drummond exclaimed.  \"An ID card,\" Angus said, holding it so the light wouldn't reflect off its transparent protective cover.  It was a picture of a nondescript man--not as stout as Drummond, nor as lean as McIntosh--with hair neither all black, like the younger man's, nor nearly all white, like Angus's.  The print below the picture was indiscernible, except for the subject's last name....  \"Jackson!\" Drummond whispered.  Angus slowly replaced the card. \"A hundred years of false devotion,\" he said pensively. \"Just think--\"  \"This is no time for that kind of gas.\" Drummond glanced at his watch. \"We got just two hours to cut off those converters.\" Desperately, he faced the robots. \"Hey, you clunkers! You're robot assemblers. You got four hundred clunkers in that cave, all in pieces. Get in there and put 'em together!\"  Angus shook his head disapprovingly. Somehow it didn't seem right, calling them clunkers.  \"Jackson is my Supervisor!\" intoned RA-204.  \"Jackson is my Supervisor!\" echoed the mass.  Drummond glanced frantically at his watch, then looked helplessly at Angus. Angus shrugged.  The younger man's face suddenly tensed with resolution. \"So they've got to have a Jackson? All right, I'll give 'em one!\"  He waved his fist at the horde. \"I'm your Supervisor! I'm your Jackson! Now clear out of the way and--\"  RA-76's hand darted out and seized Drummond's ankle, tugged him off the ledge. As he fell to the ground, a score of robots closed in over him, metal arms flailing down methodically. Angus yelled at them to stop, saw he was too late and sank down, turning away sickly.  Finally, after a long while, they backed off and faced Angus.  \"We have passed the Divine test, O Jackson!\" 204 shouted up jubilantly.  \"We have redeemed ourselves before our Supervisor!\" exclaimed 76.  It took a long, horror-filled moment before Angus could speak.  \"How do you know?\" he managed to ask at last.  \"If he had been Jackson,\" exclaimed 204, \"we could not have destroyed him.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The robots fell prostrate again and returned to their devotional. But now the phrases were triumphant, where before they had been servile and uncertain.  Angus stared numbly down at Drummond, then backed against the cliff. The litany below, exuberant now, grew mightily in volume, booming vibrantly against distant hills.  \"There is but one Supervisor!\" intoned 204.  \"But one Jackson!\" answered the assembly.  \"And now He dwelleth among His children!\" 76 chanted.  \"In their midst!\" boomed the hundreds.  Suddenly it all seemed horribly ludicrous and Angus laughed. The litany, stopped and his laughter grew shriller, louder, edged with hysteria.  The shimmering sea of metal, confounded, stared at him and it was as though he could see fleshy furrows of confusion on the featureless faces.... But how could a clunker show emotion?  His laughter slowed and died, like the passing of a violent storm. And he felt weakened with a sickening sense of compassion. Robots--_human_ robots--standing awed before unknown concepts while they groped for Truth. Clunkers with a sense of right and wrong and with an overwhelming love. It was absurd that he had been elected father of twelve hundred children--whether flesh or metal--but it didn't _feel_ at all absurd.  \"Dost Thou despair of us, O Jackson?\" asked 76 hesitantly, staring up at him.  204 motioned toward the ship, the top of its hull shining beyond the nearby woods. \"Wouldst Thou _still_ return to Thy vessel, Supervisor?\"  Incredulous, Angus tensed. \"You mean I can go?\"  \"If that is Thy wish, True Jackson, you may go,\" said 76 submissively.  As he watched unbelievingly, a corridor opened in their ranks, extending toward the woods and the ship beyond. He glanced anxiously at his watch. There was still more than an hour left.  Wearily, he dropped from the ledge and trudged toward freedom, trying to look straight ahead. His eyes, nevertheless, wandered to the dejected figures who faced him with their heads bowed.  Then he laughed again, realizing the illogical nature of his solicitous thoughts. Imagine--_dejected_ clunkers! Still, the metal faces seemed somehow different. Where, a moment earlier, he had fancied expressions of jubilation, now there was the sense of hopelessness on the steel plates.         *       *       *       *       *  Shrugging off his uncertainty, he walked faster. After all, was it _his_ fault they'd stumbled upon a substitute for birth and death and had become something more than clunkers? What was he supposed to do--stay and play missionary, bring them the Truth so that when a deactivation crew came along, they would be so advanced morally that no one would suggest their destruction?  He stopped and scanned the ranks on either side. He'd do one thing for them, at least--he wouldn't report the wreck. Then it would be centuries, probably, before another ship wandered far enough away from the trade routes to intercept the distress signals.  Relieved by his decision, he went ahead more at ease.  And the litany started again--softly, appealing:  \"J"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51185"],["title","All Jackson's Children (#3)"],["body","is my Supervisor.\"  \"I shall not rust....\"  Angus stiffened abruptly and stared at his watch, realizing belatedly that it had stopped. But how long ago? How much time did he have left? Should he take the chance and make a dash for the converters?  He reached the end of the robot corridor and started to sprint for the ship.  But he halted and turned to glance back at the humble, patient horde. They were expectantly silent now--as though they could sense his indecision. He backed away from them.  Then the light of a hundred Arcturan days flared briefly and a mighty mountain of sound and concussion collapsed on him. The trees buckled and branches were hurled out against the cliff. It rained leaves and pieces of metal from the hull for a long while as Angus hugged the ground.  When he finally looked up, familiar bits of the ship were strewn around him--a spacesuit helmet here, a control dial there, a transmitter tube up ahead.  He rose shakily, staring at a black book that lay near the helmet with its pages ruffled. He picked it up and straightened out the leaves. Then he motioned to the robots and they clustered around him.  He would have to start from the beginning.  He wet his lips.  \"In the beginning,\" Angus read in a loud, convincing voice, \"_God_ created heaven and earth and the earth was void and empty and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And _God_ said, 'Let there be light'....\""]]]
