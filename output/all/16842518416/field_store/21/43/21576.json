Then she stepped back slowly and looked at him as if she were figuring out how many feet high he was. She kept on moving backward, tapping her chin, while Butt and I got more and more impatient. When she touched the lifeboat door, she pushed it open and jumped out.         *       *       *       *       *  Butt ran over and looked down the crossway. After a while, he shut the door and came back beside me. \"Well,\" he said, swinging to a bunk, \"that's sort of it.\"  \"You're better off, Butt,\" I burst out. \"You shouldn't have a woman like Sis for a wife. She looks small and helpless, but don't forget she was trained to run an underwater city!\"  \"Wasn't worrying about that,\" he grinned. \"_I_ grew up in the fifteen long years of the Blue Chicago Rising. Nope.\" He turned over on his back and clicked his teeth at the ceiling. \"Think we'd have nested out nicely.\"  I hitched myself up to him and we sat on the bunk, glooming away at each other. Then we heard the tramp of feet in the crossway.  Butt swung down and headed for the control compartment in the nose of the lifeboat. He had his blaster out and was cursing very interestingly. I started after him, but he picked me up by the seat of my jumper and tossed me toward the door. The Captain came in and tripped over me.  I got all tangled up in his gold braid and million-mile space buttons. When we finally got to our feet and sorted out right, he was breathing very hard. The Captain was a round little man with a plump, golden face and a very scared look on it. He _humphed_ at me, just the way Sis does, and lifted me by the scruff of my neck. The Chief Mate picked me up and passed me to the Second Assistant Engineer.  Sis was there, being held by the purser on one side and the Chief Computer's Mate on the other. Behind them, I could see a flock of wide-eyed female passengers.  \"You cowards!\" Sis was raging. \"Letting your Captain face a dangerous outlaw all by himself!\"  \"I dunno, Miss Sparling,\" the Computer's Mate said, scratching the miniature slide-rule insignia on his visor with his free hand. \"The Old Man would've been willing to let it go with a log entry, figuring the spaceport paddlefeet could pry out the stowaway when we landed. But you had to quote the Mother Anita Law at him, and he's in there doing his duty. He figures the rest of us are family men, too, and there's no sense making orphans.\"  \"You promised, Sis,\" I told her through my teeth. \"You promised you wouldn't get Butt into trouble!\"  She tossed her spiral curls at me and ground a heel into the purser's instep. He screwed up his face and howled, but he didn't let go of her arm.  \"_Shush_, Ferdinand, this is serious!\"  It was. I heard the Captain say, \"I'm not carrying a weapon, Brown.\"  \"Then _get_ one,\" Butt's low, lazy voice floated out.  \"No, thanks. You're as handy with that thing as I am with a rocketboard.\" The Captain's words got a little fainter as he walked forward. Butt growled like a gusher about to blow.  \"I'm counting on your being a good guy, Brown.\" The Captain's voice quavered just a bit. \"I'm banking on what I heard about the blast-happy Browns every time I lifted gravs in New Kalamazoo; they have a code, they don't burn unarmed men.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Just about this time, events in the lifeboat went down to a mumble. The top of my head got wet and I looked up. There was sweat rolling down the Second Assistant's forehead; it converged at his nose and bounced off the tip in a sizable stream. I twisted out of the way.  \"What's happening?\" Sis gritted, straining toward the lock.  \"Butt's trying to decide whether he wants him fried or scrambled,\" the Computer's Mate said, pulling her back. \"Hey, purse, remember when the whole family with their pop at the head went into Heatwave to argue with Colonel Leclerc?\"  \"Eleven dead, sixty-four injured,\" the purser answered mechanically. \"And no more army stationed south of Icebox.\" His right ear twitched irritably. \"But what're they saying?\"  Suddenly we heard. \"By authority vested in me under the Pomona College Treaty,\" the Captain was saying very loudly, \"I arrest you for violation of Articles Sixteen to Twenty-one inclusive of the Space Transport Code, and order your person and belongings impounded for the duration of this voyage as set forth in Sections Forty-one and Forty-five--\"  \"Forty-three and Forty-five,\" Sis groaned. \"Sections Forty-three and Forty-five, I told him. I even made him repeat it after me!\"  \"--of the Mother Anita Law, SC 2136, Emergency Interplanetary Directives.\"         *       *       *       *       *  We all waited breathlessly for Butt's reply. The seconds ambled on and there was no clatter of electrostatic discharge, no smell of burning flesh.  Then we heard some feet walking. A big man in a green suit swung out into the crossway. That was Butt. Behind him came the Captain, holding the blaster gingerly with both hands. Butt had a funny, thoughtful look on his face.  The girls surged forward when they saw him, scattering the crew to one side. They were like a school of sharks that had just caught sight of a dying whale.  \"M-m-m-m! Are all Venusians built like that?\"  \"Men like that are worth the mileage!\"  \"_I want him!\" \"I want him!\" \"I want him!_\"  Sis had been let go. She grabbed my free hand and pulled me away. She was trying to look only annoyed, but her eyes had bright little bubbles of fury popping in them.  \"The cheap extroverts! And they call themselves responsible women!\"  I was angry, too. And I let her know, once we were in our cabin. \"What about that promise, Sis? You said you wouldn't turn him in. You _promised_!\"  She stopped walking around the room as if she had been expecting to get to Venus on foot. \"I know I did, Ferdinand, but he forced me.\"  \"My name is Ford and I don't understand.\"  \"Your name is Ferdinand and stop trying to act forcefully like a girl. It doesn't become you. In just a few days, you'll forget all this and be your simple, carefree self again. I really truly meant to keep my word. From what you'd told me, Mr. Brown seemed to be a fundamentally decent chap despite his barbaric notions on equality between the sexes--or worse. I was positive I could shame him into a more rational social behavior and make him give himself up. Then he--he--\"  She pressed her fingernails into her palms and let out a long, glaring sigh at the door. \"Then he kissed me! Oh, it was a good enough kiss--Mr. Brown has evidently had a varied and colorful background--but the galling idiocy of the man, trying that! I was just getting over the colossal impudence involved in _his_ proposing marriage--as if _he_ had to bear the children!--and was considering the offer seriously, on its merits, as one should consider _all_ suggestions, when he deliberately dropped the pretense of reason. He appealed to me as most of the savage ancients appealed to their women, as an emotional machine. Throw the correct sexual switches, says this theory, and the female surrenders herself ecstatically to the doubtful and bloody murk of masculine plans.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a double knock on the door and the Captain walked in without waiting for an invitation. He was still holding Butt's blaster. He pointed it at me. \"Get your hands up, Ferdinand Sparling,\" he said.  I did.  \"I hereby order your detention for the duration of this voyage, for aiding and abetting a stowaway, as set forth in Sections Forty-one and Forty-five--\"  \"Forty-three and Forty-five,\" Sis interrupted him, her eyes getting larger and rounder. \"But you gave me your word of honor that no charges would be lodged against the boy!\"  \"Forty-one and Forty-five,\" he corrected her courteously, still staring fiercely at me. \"I looked it up. Of the Anita Mason Law, Emergency Interplanetary Directives. That was the usual promise one makes to an informer, but I made it before I knew it was Butt Lee Brown you were talking about. I didn't want to arrest Butt Lee Brown. You forced me. So I'm breaking my promise to you, just as, I understand, you broke your promise to your brother. They'll both be picked up at New Kalamazoo Spaceport and sent Terraward for trial.\"  \"But I used all of our money to buy passage,\" Sis wailed.  \"And now you'll have to return with the boy. I'm sorry, Miss Sparling. But as you explained to me, a man who has been honored with an important official position should stay close to the letter of the law for the sake of other men who are trying to break down terrestrial anti-male prejudice. Of course, there's a way out.\"  \"There is? Tell me, please!\"  \"Can I lower my hands a minute?\" I asked.  \"No, you can't, son--not according to the armed surveillance provisions of the Mother Anita Law. Miss Sparling, if you'd marry Brown--now, now, don't look at me like that!--we could let the whole matter drop. A shipboard wedding and he goes on your passport as a 'dependent male member of family,' which means, so far as the law is concerned, that he had a regulation passport from the beginning of this voyage. And once we touch Venusian soil he can contact his bank and pay for passage. On the record, no crime was ever committed. He's free, the boy's free, and you--\"  \"--Are married to an uncombed desperado who doesn't know enough to sit back and let a woman run things. Oh, you should be ashamed!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Captain shrugged and spread his arms wide.  \"Perhaps I should be, but that's what comes of putting men into responsible positions, as you would say. See here, Miss Sparling, _I_ didn't want to arrest Brown, and, if it's at all possible, I'd still prefer not to. The crew, officers and men, all go along with me. We may be legal residents of Earth, but our work requires us to be on Venus several times a year. We don't want to be disliked by any members of the highly irritable Brown clan or its collateral branches. Butt Lee Brown himself, for all of his savage appearance in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51150"],["title","Venus is a Man's World (#4)"],["body","civilized eyes, is a man of much influence on the Polar Continent. In his own bailiwick, the Galertan Archipelago, he makes, breaks and occasionally readjusts officials. Then there's his brother Saskatchewan who considers Butt a helpless, put-upon youngster--\"  \"Much influence, you say? Mr. Brown has?\" Sis was suddenly thoughtful.  \"_Power_, actually. The kind a strong man usually wields in a newly settled community. Besides, Miss Sparling, you're going to Venus for a husband because the male-female ratio on Earth is reversed. Well, not only is Butt Lee Brown a first class catch, but you can't afford to be too particular in any case. While you're fairly pretty, you won't bring any wealth into a marriage and your high degree of opinionation is not likely to be well-received on a backward, masculinist world. Then, too, the woman-hunger is not so great any more, what with the _Marie Curie_ and the _Fatima_ having already deposited their cargoes, the _Mme. Sun Yat Sen_ due to arrive next month....\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sis nodded to herself, waved the door open, and walked out.  \"Let's hope,\" the Captain said. \"Like any father used to say, a man who knows how to handle women, how to get around them without their knowing it, doesn't need to know anything else in this life. I'm plain wasted in space. You can lower your hands now, son.\"  We sat down and I explained the blaster to him. He was very interested. He said all Butt had told him--in the lifeboat when they decided to use my arrest as a club over Sis--was to keep the safety catch all the way up against his thumb. I could see he really had been excited about carrying a lethal weapon around. He told me that back in the old days, captains--sea captains, that is--actually had the right to keep guns in their cabins all the time to put down mutinies and other things our ancestors did.  The telewall flickered, and we turned it on. Sis smiled down. \"Everything's all right, Captain. Come up and marry us, please.\"  \"What did you stick him for?\" he asked. \"What was the price?\"  Sis's full lips went thin and hard, the way Mom's used to. Then she thought better of it and laughed. \"Mr. Brown is going to see that I'm elected sheriff of the Galertan Archipelago.\"  \"And I thought she'd settle for a county clerkship!\" the Captain muttered as we spun up to the brig.  The doors were open and girls were chattering in every corner. Sis came up to the Captain to discuss arrangements. I slipped away and found Butt sitting with folded arms in a corner of the brig. He grinned at me. \"Hi, tadpole. Like the splash?\"  I shook my head unhappily. \"Butt, why did you do it? I'd sure love to be your brother-in-law, but, gosh, you didn't have to marry Sis.\" I pointed at some of the bustling females. Sis was going to have three hundred bridesmaids. \"Any one of them would have jumped at the chance to be your wife. And once on any woman's passport, you'd be free. Why Sis?\"  \"That's what the Captain said in the lifeboat. Told him same thing I'm telling you. I'm stubborn. What I like at first, I keep on liking. What I want at first, I keep on wanting until I get.\"  \"Yes, but making Sis sheriff! And you'll have to back her up with your blaster. What'll happen to that man's world?\"  \"Wait'll after we nest and go out to my islands.\" He produced a hard-lipped, smug grin, sighting it at Sis's slender back. \"She'll find herself sheriff over a bunch of natives and exactly two Earth males--you and me. I got a hunch that'll keep her pretty busy, though.\""]]]
