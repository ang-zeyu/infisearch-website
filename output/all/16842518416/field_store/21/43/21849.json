Prince Marvel looked into her sweet face with pitying eyes, and stepping quickly to her side, took her hand in his.  \"Now drink!\" he said, smiling upon her; \"the poison will not hurt you.\"  She drank obediently, while the dwarf chuckled with awful glee and the king looked on eagerly, expecting her to fall dead at his feet.  But instead the girl stood upright and pressed Marvel's hand, looking gratefully into his face.  \"You are a fairy!\" she whispered, so low that no one else heard her voice.  \"I knew that you would save me.\"  \"Keep my secret,\" whispered the prince in return, and still holding her hand he led her back to her former place.  King Terribus was almost wild with rage and disappointment, and his elephant nose twisted and squirmed horribly.  \"So you dare to thwart my commands, do you!\" he cried, excitedly. \"Well, we shall soon see which of us is the more powerful.  I have decreed your death--and die you shall!\"  For a moment his eye roved around the chamber uncertainly.  Then he shouted, suddenly:  \"Ho, there!  Keepers of the royal menagerie--appear!\"  Three men entered the room and bowed before the king.  They were of the Gray Men of the mountains, who had followed Prince Marvel and Nerle through the rocky passes.  \"Bring hither the Royal Dragon,\" cried the king, \"and let him consume these strangers before my very eyes!\"  The men withdrew, and presently was heard a distant shouting, followed by a low rumbling sound, with groans, snorts, roars and a hissing like steam from the spout of a teakettle.  The noise and shouting drew nearer, while the people huddled together like frightened sheep; and then suddenly the doors flew open and the Royal Dragon advanced to the center of the room.  This creature was at once the pride and terror of the Kingdom of Spor. It was more than thirty feet in length and covered everywhere with large green scales set with diamonds, making the dragon, when it moved, a very glittering spectacle.  Its eyes were as big as pie-plates, and its mouth--when wide opened--fully as large as a bath-tub.  Its tail was very long and ended in a golden ball, such as you see on the top of flagstaffs.  Its legs, which were as thick as those of an elephant, had scales which were set with rubies and emeralds.  It had two monstrous, big ears and two horns of carved ivory, and its teeth were also carved into various fantastic shapes--such as castles, horses' heads, chinamen and griffins--so that if any of them broke it would make an excellent umbrella handle.  The Royal Dragon of Spor came crawling into the throne-room rather clumsily, groaning and moaning with every step and waving its ears like two blankets flying from a clothesline.  The king looked on it and frowned.  \"Why are you not breathing fire and brimstone?\" he demanded, angrily.  \"Why, I was caught out in a gale the other night,\" returned the Dragon, rubbing the back of its ear with its left front paw, as it paused and looked at the king, \"and the wind put out my fire.\"  \"Then why didn't you light it again?\" asked Terribus, turning on the keepers.  \"We--we were out of matches, your Majesty!\" stammered the trembling Gray Men.  \"So--ho!\" yelled the king, and was about to order the keepers beheaded; but just then Nerle pulled out his match-box, lit one of the matches, and held it in front of the Dragon's mouth.  Instantly the creature's breath caught fire; and it began to breathe flames a yard in length.  \"That's better,\" sighed the Dragon, contentedly.  \"I hope your Majesty is now satisfied.\"  \"No,--I am not satisfied!\" declared King Terribus.  \"Why do you not lash your tail?\"  \"Ah, I can't do that!\" replied the Dragon.  \"It's all stiffened up with rheumatism from the dampness of my cave.  It hurts too much to lash it.\"  \"Well, then, gnash your teeth!\" commanded the king.  \"Tut--tut!\" answered the Dragon, mildly; \"I can't do that, either; for since you had them so beautifully carved it makes my teeth ache to gnash them.\"  \"Well, then, what are you good for?\" cried the king, in a fury.  \"Don't I look awful?  Am I not terrible to gaze on?\" inquired the Dragon, proudly, as it breathed out red and yellow flames and made them curl in circles around its horns.  \"I guess there's no need for me to suggest terror to any one that happens to see me,\" it added, winking one of the pie-plate eyes at King Terribus.  The king looked at the monster critically, and it really seemed to him that it was a frightful thing to behold.  So he curbed his anger and said, in his ordinary sweet voice:  \"I have called you here to destroy these two strangers.\"  \"How?\" asked the Dragon, looking upon Prince Marvel and Nerle with interest.  \"I am not particular,\" answered the king.  \"You may consume them with your fiery breath, or smash them with your tail, or grind them to atoms between your teeth, or tear them to pieces with your claws.  Only, do hurry up and get it over with!\"  \"Hm-m-m!\" said the Dragon, thoughtfully, as if it didn't relish the job; \"this one isn't Saint George, is it?\"  \"No, no!\" exclaimed the king, irritably; \"it's Prince Marvel.  Do get to work as soon as possible.\"  \"Prince Marvel--Prince Marvel,\" repeated the Dragon.  \"Why, there isn't a prince in the whole world named Marvel!  I'm pretty well posted on the history of royal families, you know.  I'm afraid he's Saint George in disguise.\"  \"Isn't your name Prince Marvel?\" inquired the king, turning to the boyish-looking stranger.  \"It is,\" answered Marvel.  \"Well, it's mighty strange I've never heard of you,\" persisted the Dragon.  \"But tell me, please, how would you prefer to be killed?\"  \"Oh, I'm not going to be killed at all,\" replied the prince, laughing.  \"Do you hear that, Terribus?\" asked the Dragon, turning to the king; \"he says he isn't going to be killed.\"  \"But I say he is!\" cried Terribus.  \"I have decreed his death.\"  \"But do you suppose I'm going to kill a man against his will?\" inquired the Dragon, in a reproachful voice; \"and such a small man, too!  Do you take me for a common assassin--or a murderer?\"  \"Do you intend to obey my orders?\" roared the king.  \"No, I don't; and that's flat!\" returned the Dragon, sharply.  \"It's time for me to take my cough medicine; so if you've nothing more to say I'll go back to my cave.\"  \"Go, go, go!\" shrieked the king, stamping his foot in passion.  \"You've outlived your usefulness!  You're a coward!  You're a traitor!  You're a--a--a--\"  \"I'm a dragon and a gentleman!\" answered the monster, proudly, as the king paused for lack of a word; \"and I believe I know what's proper for dragons to do and what isn't.  I've learned wisdom from my father, who got into trouble with Saint George, and if I fought with this person who calls himself Prince Marvel, I'd deserve to be a victim of your Fool-Killer.  Oh, I know my business, King Terribus; and if you knew yours, you'd get rid of this pretended prince as soon as possible!\"  With this speech he winked at Prince Marvel, turned soberly around and crawled from the room.  One of the keepers got too near and the Dragon's breath set fire to his robe, the flames being with difficulty extinguished; and the gold ball on the end of the Dragon's tail struck a giant upon his shins and made him dance and howl in pain.  But, aside from these slight accidents, the monster managed to leave the throne-room without undue confusion, and every one, including the king, seemed glad to be rid of him.    10.  Prince Marvel Wins His Fight  When the door had closed on the Royal Dragon, King Terribus turned again to Prince Marvel, while his crimson face glowed with embarrassment, and his front eye rolled with baffled rage as he thought how vain had been all his efforts to kill this impudent invader of his domains.  But his powers were by no means exhausted.  He was a mighty king--the mightiest of all in the Enchanted Island, he believed--and ways to destroy his enemies were numerous.  \"Send for a hundred of my Gray Men!\" he suddenly cried; and a courtier ran at once to summon them.  The Gray Men would obey his orders without question, he well knew.  They were silent, stubborn, quick, and faithful to their king.  Terribus had but to command and his will would be obeyed.  They entered the room so quietly that Nerle never knew they were there until he turned and found the hundred gray ones standing close together in the center of the hall.  Then Prince Marvel came to Nerle's side and whispered something in his ear.  \"Will you obey my orders?\" they heard the king ask.  And the Gray Men, with their eyes fixed upon their master, nodded all their hundred heads and put their hands upon the dangerous three-tined forks that were stuck in every one of the hundred belts.  Prince Marvel handed one end of a coiled rope to Nerle, and then they both sprang forward and ran around the spot where the hundred Gray Men stood huddled together.  Then they were pulled closer together than before--closer, and still closer--for the prince and Nerle had surrounded them with the rope and were tying the two ends together in a tight knot.  The rope cut into the waists of those on the outside, and they pressed inward against their fellows until there was scarcely space to stick a knife-blade between any two of them.  When the prince had tied the rope firmly King Terribus, who had been looking on amazed, saw that his hundred Gray Men were fastened together like a bundle of kindling-wood, and were unable to stir hand or foot.  And, while he still gazed open-mouthed at the strange sight, Prince Marvel tilted the bundle of men up on its edge and rolled it out of the door.  It went rolling swiftly through the courtyard and bounded down the castle steps, where the rope broke and the men fell sprawling in all directions on the marble walk.  King Terribus sighed, for such treatment of his Gray Men, whom he dearly loved, made him very unhappy.  But more than ever was he resolved to kill these impudent strangers,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],["title","The Enchanted Island of Yew (#8)"],["body"," who, in the very heart of his kingdom where thousands bowed to his will, dared openly defy his power.  So, after a moment's thought, Terribus beckoned to a dwarf who, robed in gay and glittering apparel, stood near his throne.  \"Summon the royal Dart Slingers!\" he said, with a scowl.  The little man bowed and hastened away, to return presently with twenty curiously crooked dwarfs, each armed with a sling and a quiver full of slender, sharp-pointed darts.  \"Slay me these strangers!\" exclaimed the king, in his gruffest voice.  Now Nerle, when he beheld these terrible Dart Slingers, of whom he had heard many tales in his boyhood, began to shiver and shake with fright, so that his teeth rattled one upon another.  And he reflected: \"Soon shall I be content, for these darts will doubtless pierce every part of my body.\"  The dwarfs formed a line at one side of the gloomy throne-room, and Prince Marvel, who had been earnestly regarding them, caught Nerle by the arm and led him to the opposite wall.  \"Stand close behind me and you will be safe,\" he whispered to his esquire.  Then each dwarf fixed a dart in his sling, and at a word from their chief they all drew back their arms and launched a shower of the sharp missiles at the strangers.  Swift and true they sped, each dart intended to pierce the body of the youthful knight who stood so calm before them.  Prince Marvel had raised his right arm, and in his hand was a small leather sack, with a wide mouth.  As the darts flew near him a strange thing happened: they each and all swerved from their true course and fell rattling into the leathern sack, to the wonder of the royal slingers and the dismay of King Terribus himself.  \"Again!\" screamed the king, his usually mild voice hoarse with anger.  So again the dwarfs cast their darts, and again the leathern sack caught them every one.  Another flight followed, and yet another, till the magic sack was packed full of the darts and not a dwarf had one remaining in his quiver.  Amid the awed silence of the beholders of this feat the merry laughter of Prince Marvel rang loud and clear; for the sight of the puzzled and terrified faces about him was very comical.  Plucking a dart from the sack he raised his arm and cried:  \"Now it is my turn.  You shall have back your darts!\"  \"Hold!\" shouted the king, in great fear.  \"Do not, I beg you, slay my faithful servants.\"  And with a wave of his hand he dismissed the dwarfs, who were glad to rush from the room and escape.  Nerle wiped the tears from his eyes, for he was sorely disappointed at having again escaped all pain and discomfort; but Prince Marvel seated himself quietly upon a stool and looked at the scowling face of King Terribus with real amusement.  The monarch of Spor had never before been so foiled and scorned by any living creature.  Defeated and humbled before his own people, he bowed his crimson head on his hands and sullenly regarded his foe with his top eye.  Then it was that the idea came to him that no ordinary mortal could have thwarted him so easily, and he began to fear he was dealing--perhaps unawares--with some great magician or sorcerer.  That a fairy should have assumed a mortal form he never once considered, for such a thing was until then unheard of in the Enchanted Island of Yew. But with the knowledge that he had met his master, whoever he might prove to be, and that further attempts upon the stranger's life might lead to his own undoing, King Terribus decided to adopt a new line of conduct, hoping to accomplish by stratagem what he could not do by force.  To be sure, there remained his regiment of Giants, the pride of his kingdom; but Terribus dreaded to meet with another defeat; and he was not at all sure, after what had happened, that the giants would succeed in conquering or destroying the strangers.  \"After all,\" he thought, \"my only object in killing them was to prevent their carrying news of my monstrous appearance to the outside world; so if I can but manage to keep them forever in my kingdom it will answer my purpose equally well.\"  As the result of this thought he presently raised his head and spoke to Prince Marvel in a quiet and even cheerful voice.  \"Enough of these rude and boisterous games,\" said he, with a smile that showed his white teeth in a repulsive manner.  \"They may have seemed to my people an ill welcome to my good friend, Prince Marvel; yet they were only designed to show the powers of the mighty magician who has become my guest.  Nay, do not deny it, Prince; from the first I guessed your secret, and to prove myself right I called my servants to oppose you, being sure they could not do you an injury.  But no more of such fooling,--and pray forgive my merry game at your expense.  Henceforth we shall be friends, and you are heartily welcome to the best my kingdom affords.\"  With this speech Terribus stepped down from his throne and approached Prince Marvel with outstretched hand.  The prince was not at all deceived, but he was pleased to see how cunningly the king excused his attempts to kill him.  So he laughed and touched the hand Terribus extended, for this fairy prince seemed to have no anger against any mortal who ventured to oppose him.  The strangers were now conducted, with every mark of respect, to a beautiful suite of apartments in the castle, wherein were soft beds with velvet spreads, marble baths with perfumed waters, and a variety of silken and brocaded costumes from which they might select a change of raiment.  No sooner had they bathed and adorned themselves fittingly than they were summoned to the king's banquet hall, being escorted thither by twelve young maidens bearing torches with lavender-colored flames.  The night had fallen upon the mountains outside, but the great banquet hall was brilliant with the glow of a thousand candles, and seated at the head of the long table was King Terribus.  Yet here, as in the throne-room, the ruler of Spor was dressed in simplest garments, and his seat was a rough block of stone.  All about him were lords and ladies in gorgeous array; the walls were hung with rare embroideries; the table was weighted with gold platters and richly carved goblets filled with sweet nectars.  But the king himself, with his horrid, ugly head, was like a great blot on a fair parchment, and even Prince Marvel could not repress a shudder as he gazed upon him.  Terribus placed his guest upon his right hand and loaded him with honors.  Nerle stood behind the prince's chair and served him faithfully, as an esquire should.  But the other servants treated Nerle with much deference, noting in him an air of breeding that marked him the unusual servant of an unusual master.  Indeed, most curious were the looks cast on these marvelous men who had calmly walked into the castle of mighty Terribus and successfully defied his anger; for in spite of his youthful appearance and smiling face every attendant at the banquet feared Prince Marvel even more than they feared their own fierce king.    11.  The Cunning of King Terribus  The days that followed were pleasant ones for Prince Marvel and Nerle, who were treated as honored guests by both the king and his courtiers. But the prince seemed to be the favorite, for at all games of skill and trials at arms he was invariably the victor, while in the evenings, when the grand ball-room was lighted up and the musicians played sweet music, none was so graceful in the dance as the fairy prince.  Nerle soon tired of the games and dancing, for he had been accustomed to them at his father's castle; and moreover he was shy in the society of ladies; so before many weeks had passed he began to mope and show a discontented face.  One day the prince noticed his esquire's dismal expression of countenance, and asked the cause of it.  \"Why,\" said Nerle, \"here I have left my home to seek worries and troubles, and have found but the same humdrum life that existed at my father's castle.  Here our days are made smooth and pleasant, and there is no excitement or grief, whatever.  You have become a carpet-knight, Prince Marvel, and think more of bright eyes than of daring deeds.  So, if you will release me from your service I will seek further adventures.\"  \"Nay,\" returned the prince, \"we will go together; for I, too, am tired of this life of pleasure.\"  So next morning Marvel sought the presence of King Terribus and said:  \"I have come to bid your Majesty adieu, for my esquire and I are about to leave your dominions.\"  At first the king laughed, and his long nose began to sway from side to side.  Then, seeing the prince was in earnest, his Majesty frowned and grew disturbed.  Finally he said:  \"I must implore you to remain my guests a short time longer.  No one has ever before visited me in my mountain home, and I do not wish to lose the pleasure of your society so soon.\"  \"Nevertheless, we must go,\" answered the prince, briefly.  \"Are you not contented?\" asked Terribus.  \"Ask whatever you may desire, and it shall be granted you.\"  \"We desire adventures amid new scenes,\" said Marvel, \"and these you can not give us except by permission to depart.\"  Seeing his guest was obstinate the king ceased further argument and said:  \"Very well; go if you wish.  But I shall hope to see you return to us this evening.\"  The prince paid no heed to this peculiar speech, but left the hall and hurried to the courtyard of the castle, where Nerle was holding the horses in readiness for their journey.  Standing around were many rows and files of the Gray Men, and when they reached the marble roadway they found it lined with motionless forms of the huge giants.  But no one interfered with them in any way, although both Prince Marvel and Nerle knew that every eye followed them as they rode forward.  Curiously enough, they had both forgotten from what direction they had approached the castle; for, whereas they had at that time noticed but one marble roadway leading to the entrance, they now saw that there were"]]]
