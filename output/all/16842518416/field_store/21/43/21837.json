The smart thing to do now would be to head back out the turnpike to Haug's lot, turn in my badge and keep moving, south. I could give up while I was still alive. All I had to do was accept the situation.  I had a wide choice. I could sign on with the New Confeds, or the Free Texans, or any one of the other splinter republics trying to set up shop in the power vacuum. I might try to get in to one of the Enclaves and convince its Baron he needed another trained bodyguard. Or I could take a post with one of the king-pins in the city.  As a last resort I could go back and find a spot in the Naples organization. I happened to know they had a vacancy.  I was just running through mental exercises to hear myself think. I couldn't settle for the kind of world I had found when I touched planet three months back, after eight years in deep space with Hayle's squadron. When the Interim Administration shot him for treason, I burned my uniform and disappeared. My years in the Service had given me a tough hide and a knack for staying alive; my worldly assets consisted of the clothes I stood in, my service pistol and a few souvenirs of my travels. For two months I had been scraping along on the cash I had in my pocket, buying drinks for drifters in cheap bars, looking for a hint, any lead at all, that would give me a chance to do what had to be done. Max Arena was the lead. Maybe a dud lead--but I had to find out.  The city lights loomed just a few miles away. I was wasting time sitting here; I steered the hack out into the highway and headed for them.         *       *       *       *       *  Apparently Lefty's influence didn't extend far beyond the South Radial. The two roadblocks I passed in the next five miles took my money, accepted my story that I was on my way to pick up a fare, said to say hello to Haug and passed me on my way.  Haug's sour yellow color scheme seemed to carry some weight with the town Organizations, too. I was well into the city, cruising along the third level Crossover, before I had any trouble. I was doing about fifty, watching where I was going and looking for the Manhattan Intermix, when a battered Gyrob four-seater trundled out across the fairway and stopped. I swerved and jumped lanes; the Gyrob backed, blocking me. I kicked my safety frame down and floor-boarded the hack, steering straight for him. At the last instant he tried to pull out of the way.  He was too late.  I clipped him across his aft quarter, and caught a glimpse of the underside of the car as it stood on its nose, slammed through the deflector and over the side. Old 16 bucked and I got a good crack across the jaw from the ill-fitting frame, and then I was screeching through the Intermix and out onto the Manhattan Third level.  Up ahead, the glare panels at the top of the Blue Tower reared up half a mile into the wet night sky. It wasn't a hard address to find. Getting inside would be another matter.  I pulled up a hundred yards from the dark cave they used to call the limousine entrance and looked the situation over. The level was deserted--like the whole city seemed, from the street. But there were lights in the windows, level after level of them stretching up and away as far as you could see. There were plenty of people in the city--about ten million, even after the riots and the Food Scare and the collapse of legal government. The automated city supply system had gone on working, and the Kingpins, the big time criminals, had stepped in and set things up to suit their tastes. Life went on--but not out in the open. Not after dark.  I knew almost nothing about Arena. Judging from his employees, he was Kingpin of a prosperous outfit. The T-Bird was an expensive late model, and the two thugs handled themselves like high-priced talent. I couldn't expect to walk into his HQ without jumping a few hurdles. Maybe I should have invited myself along with Stenn and his new friends. On the other hand, there were advantages to arriving unannounced.  It was a temptation to drive in, with the hack's armor between me and any little surprises that might be waiting, but I liked the idea of staging a surprise of my own. I eased into drive and moved along to a parking ramp, swung around and down and stopped in the shadow of the retaining wall.  I set the brake and took a good look around. There was nothing in sight. Arena might have a power cannon trained on me from his bedroom window, for all I knew, but I had to get a toe into the water sometime. I shut down the turbo, and in the silence popped the lid and stepped out. The rain had stopped, and the moon showed as a bright spot on the high mist. I felt hungry and a little bit unreal, as though this were happening to somebody else.         *       *       *       *       *  I moved over to the side of the parking slab, clambered over the deflector rail and studied the shadows under the third level roadway. I could barely make out the catwalks and service ways. I was wondering whether to pull off my hard-soled shoes for the climb when I heard footsteps, close. I gauged the distance to the hack, and saw I couldn't make it. I got back over the rail and waited.  He came into sight, rangy, shock-haired and preternaturally thin in tight traditional dress.  When he got close I saw that he was young, in his early twenties at most. He would be carrying a knife.  \"Hey, Mister,\" he whined. \"Got a cigarette?\"  \"Sure, young fellow,\" I said, sounding a little nervous. I threw in a shaky laugh to help build the picture. I took a cigarette from a pack, put the pack back in my pocket, held the weed out. He strutted up to me, reached out and flipped the cigarette from my fingers. I edged back and used the laugh again.  \"Hey, he liked that,\" the punk whined. \"He thinks that's funny. He got a sense of humor.\"  \"Heh, heh,\" I said. \"Just out getting a little air.\"  \"Gimme another cigarette, funny man.\"  I took the pack out, watching. I got out a cigarette and held it gingerly, arm bent. As he reached for it, I drew back. He snatched for it. That put him in position.  I dropped the pack, clenched my two hands together, ducked down and brought them up hard under his chin. He backflipped, rolled over and started crawling.  I let him go.  I went over the rail without stopping to think it over and crossed the girder to the catwalk that ran under the boulevard above. I groped my way along to where the service way branched off for the Blue Tower, then stopped and looked up. A strip of luminous sky showed between the third level and the facade of the building. Anybody watching from the right spot would see me cross, walking on the narrow footway. It was a chance I'd have to take. I started to move out, and heard running feet. I froze.  The feet slid to a stop on the level above, a few yards away.  \"What's up, Crackers?\" somebody growled.  \"The mark sapped me down.\"         *       *       *       *       *  That was interesting. I had been spotted and the punk had been sent to welcome me. Now I knew where I stood. The opposition had made their first mistake.  \"He was starting to cross under when I spot him,\" Crackers went on, breathing heavily. \"He saps me and I see I can't handle him and I go for help.\"  Someone answered in a guttural whisper. Crackers lowered his voice. It wouldn't take long now for reinforcements to arrive and flush me out. I edged farther and chanced a look. I saw two heads outlined above. They didn't seem to be looking my way, so I started across, walking silently toward a narrow loading platform with a wide door opening from it.  Below me, a lone light reflected from the wet pavement of the second level, fifty feet down; the blank wall of the Blue Tower dropped past it sheer to the glistening gutters at ground level. Then I was on the platform and trying the door.  It didn't open.  It was what I should have expected. Standing in the full light from the glare panel above the entry, I felt as exposed as a fan-dancer's navel. There was no time to consider alternatives. I grabbed my power pistol, flipped it to beam fire and stood aside with an arm across my face. I gave the latch a blast, then kicked the door hard. It was solid as a rock. Behind and above me, I heard Crackers yell.  I beamed the lock again, tiny droplets of molten metal spattering like needles against my face and hand. The door held.  \"Drop it and lift 'em, mug,\" a deep voice yelled. I twisted to look up at the silhouettes against the deflector rail. I recognized the Slavic face of the man called Heavy. So he could talk after all.  \"You're under my iron, mug,\" he called. \"Freeze or I'll burn you.\"  I believed him, but I had set something in motion that couldn't stop now. There was nothing to go back to; the only direction for me was on the way I was headed--deeper into trouble. I was tired of being the mouse in a cat's game. I had taken the initiative and I was keeping it.  I turned, set the power pistol at full aperture, and poured it to the armored door. Searing heat reflected from the barrier, smoke boiled, metal melted and ran. Through the stink of burning steel, I smelled scorched hair--and felt heat rake the back of my neck and hands. Heavy was beaming me at wide aperture, but the range was just too far for a fast kill. The door sagged and fell in. I jumped through the glowing opening, hit the floor and rolled to damp out my smouldering coat.         *       *       *       *       *  I got to my feet. There was no time now to stop and feel the pain of my burns. They would expect me to go up--so I would go down. The Blue Tower covered four city blocks and was four hundred stories high. There was plenty of room in it for a man to lose himself.  I ran along the corridor, found a continuous service belt and hopped on, lay flat, rode it through the slot. I came out into the light of the service corridor below, my gun ready, then down and around again. I saw no one.  It took ten minutes to cover the eighteen"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51781"],["title","The King of the City (#3)"],["body"," down to the sub-basement. I rolled off the belt and looked around.  The whole space was packed with automatics; the Blue Tower was a self-sufficient city in itself. I recognized generators, heat pumps, air plants. None of them were operating. The city services were all still functioning, apparently. What it would be like in another ten or twenty years of anarchy was anybody's guess. But when the city systems failed the Blue Tower could go on on its own.  Glare panels lit the aisles dimly. I prowled along looking for an elevator bank. The first one I found indicated the car at the hundred-eightieth floor. I went on, found another indicating the twentieth. While I watched, the indicator moved, started down. I was getting ready to duck when it stopped at the fifth. I waited; it didn't move.  I went around to the side of the bank, found the master switch. I went back, punched for the car. When the door whooshed open, I threw the switch.  I had to work fast now. I stepped into the dark car, reached up and slid open the access panel in the top, then jumped, caught the edge and pulled myself up. The glare panels inside the shaft showed me the pony power pack on top of the car, used by repairmen and inspectors when the main power was off. I lit a per-match to read the fine print on the panel. I was in luck. It was a through car to the four-hundredth. I pushed a couple of buttons, and the car started up. I lay flat behind the machinery.  As the car passed the third floor feet came into view; two men stood beyond the transparent door, guns in their hands, watching the car come up. They didn't see me. One of them thumbed the button frantically. The car kept going.  There were men at almost every floor now. I went on up, passed the hundredth floor, the one-fiftieth, and kept going. I began to feel almost safe--for the moment.         *       *       *       *       *  I was gambling now on what little I knew of the Blue Tower from the old days when all the biggest names congregated there. The top floor was a lavish apartment that had been occupied by a retired fleet admiral, a Vice-President and a uranium millionaire, in turn. If I knew anything about Kingpins, that's where Max Arena would hang his hat.  The elevator was slow. Lying there I had time to start thinking about my burned hide. My scalp was hit worst, and then my hands; and my shoulders were sticking to the charred coat. I had been travelling on adrenalin since Heavy had beamed me, and now the reaction was starting to hit.  It would have to wait; I had work to do.  Just below the three hundred and ninety-eighth floor I punched the button and the car stopped. I stood up, feeling dizzy. I grabbed for the rungs on the wall, hung on. The wall of the shaft seemed to sway ... back....  Sure, I told myself. The top of the building sways fifteen feet in a high wind. Why shouldn't I feel it? I dismissed the thought that it was dead calm outside now, and started up the ladder.  It was a hard climb. I hung on tight, and concentrated on moving one hand at a time. The collar of my coat rasped my raw neck. I passed up the 398th and 9th--and rammed my head smack against a dead end. No service entry to the penthouse. I backed down to the 399th.  I found the lever and eased the door open, then waited, gun in hand. Nothing happened. I couldn't wait any longer. I pushed the door wide, stepped off into the hall. Still nobody in sight, but I could hear voices. To my left a discreet stair carpeted in violet velvet eased up in a gentle curve. I didn't hesitate; I went up.  The door at the top was an austere slab of bleached teak. I tried the polished brass lever; the door swung open silently, and I stepped across the threshold and was looking across a plain of honey-colored down at a man sitting relaxed in a soft chair of pale leather.  He waved a hand cheerfully. \"Come on in,\" he said.   IV  Max Arena was a broad-shouldered six-footer, with clean-shaven blue jaws, coarse gray-flecked black hair brushed back from a high forehead, a deeper tan than was natural for the city in November, and very white teeth. He was showing them now in a smile. He waved a hand toward a chair, not even glancing at the gun in my hand. I admired the twinkle of light on the polished barrel of a Norge stunner at his elbow and decided to ignore it too.  \"I been following your progress with considerable interest,\" Arena said genially. \"The boys had orders not to shoot. I guess Luvitch sort of lost his head.\"  \"It's nothing,\" I said, \"that a little skin graft won't clear up in a year or so.\"  \"Don't feel bad. You're the first guy ever made it in here under his own steam without an invitation.\"  \"And with a gun in his hand,\" I said.  \"We won't need guns,\" he said. \"Not right away.\"  I went over to one of the big soft chairs and sat down, put the gun in my lap.  \"Why didn't you shoot as I came in?\"  Arena jiggled his foot. \"I like your style,\" he said. \"You handled Heavy real good. He's supposed to be my toughest boy.\"  \"What about the combat car? More friends of yours?\"  \"Nah,\" he said, chuckling easily. \"Some Jersey boys heard I had a caller. They figured to knock him off on general principles. A nifty.\" He stopped laughing. \"The Gyrob was mine; a remoted job. Nice piece of equipment. You cost me real dough tonight.\"  \"Gee,\" I said. \"That's tough.\"  \"And besides,\" he said, \"I know who you are.\"  I waited. He leaned over and picked something off the table. It was my wallet.  \"I used to be in the Navy myself. Academy man, believe it or not. Almost, anyway. Kicked out three weeks before graduation. A frame. Well, practically a frame; there was plenty of guys doing what I was doing.\"  \"That where you learned to talk like a hood?\"  For a second Arena almost didn't smile.  \"I am perfectly capable of expressing myself like a little gentleman, when I feel so inclined,\" he said, \"but I say to hell with it.\"  \"You must have been before my time,\" I said.  \"A year or two. And I was using a different name then. But that wasn't my only hitch with the Service. When the Trouble started, I enlisted. I wanted some action. When the Navy found out they had a qualified Power Section man on their hands, I went up fast. Within fourteen months I was a J. G. How about that?\"  \"Very commendable.\"  \"So that's how I knew about the trick I. D. under the emulsion on the snapshot. You should have ditched it, Maclamore. Or should I say Captain Maclamore?\"         *       *       *       *       *  My mouth opened, but I couldn't think of a snappy answer to that one. I was in trouble. I had meant to play it by ear once I reached Arena to get the information I needed. That was out now. He knew me. He had topped my aces before I played them.  Suddenly Arena was serious. \"You came to the right man, Maclamore. You heard I had one of your buddies here, right? I let the word leak; I thought it might bring more of you in. I was lucky to get Admiral Hayle's deputy.\"  \"What do you want with me?\"  Arena leaned forward. \"There were eight of you. Hayle and his aide, Wolfgang, were shot when they wouldn't spill to the Provisional Government--or whatever that mob calls itself. Margan got himself killed in some kind of tangle near Denver. The other four boys pulled a fast one and ducked out with the scout you guys came back in. They were riding dry tanks--the scout had maybe thirty ton/hours fuel aboard--so they haven't left the planet. That leaves you stranded. With six sets of Federal law looking for you. Right?\"  \"I can't argue with what's in the newspapers,\" I said.  \"Well, I don't know. I got a couple newspapers. But here's where I smell a deal, Maclamore. You want to know where that scout boat is. Played right, you figure you got a good chance of a raid on an arsenal or a power plant to pick up a few slugs of the heavy stuff; then you high-tail out, join up with the rest of the squadron and, with the ordnance you pack, you can sit off and dictate the next move.\" Arena leaned back and took a deep breath. His eyes didn't leave me.  \"Okay. I got one of you here. I found out something from him. He gave me enough I know you boys got something up your sleeve. But he don't have the whole picture. I need more info. You can give it to me. If I like what I hear, I'm in a position to help--like, for example, with the fuel problem. And you cut me in for half. Fair enough?\"  \"Who is it you've got?\"  He shook his head. \"Uh-uh.\"  \"What did he tell you?\"  \"Not enough. What was Hayle holding out? You birds found something out there. What was it?\"  \"We found a few artifacts on Mars,\" I said. \"Not Martian in origin; visitors. We surveyed--\"  \"Don't string me, Maclamore. I'm willing to give you a fair deal, but if you make it tough for me--\"  \"How do you know I haven't got a detonator buried under my left ear,\" I said. \"You can't pry information out of me, Arena.\"  \"I think you want to live, Maclamore. I think you got something you want to live for. I want a piece of it.\"  \"I can make a deal with you, Arena,\" I said. \"Return me and my shipmate to our scout boat. Fuel us up. You might throw in two qualified men to help handle the ship--minus their black-jacks, preferably--then clear out. We'll handle the rest. And I'll remember, with gratitude.\"  Arena was silent for a long moment.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Yeah, I could do that, Maclamore,\" he said finally. \"But I won't. Max Arena is not a guy to pick up the crumbs--or wait around for handouts. I want in. All the way in.\"  \"This time you'll have to settle for what you can get, Arena.\" I put the gun away and stood up.  I had a feeling I would have to put it over now or not at all.  \"The rest of the squadron is still out there. If we don't show, they'll carry on alone. They're supplied for a century's operation. They don't need us.\"  That was true up to a point. The squadron had everything--except fuel.  \"You figure you got it made if you can get your hands on that scout-boat,\" Arena said. \"You figure"]]]
