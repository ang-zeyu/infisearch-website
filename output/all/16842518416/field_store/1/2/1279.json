He passed--into a mystery. No one knows to this day what happened to him after he crossed the brow. When later on the two Fulchers and Witherspoon, moved by their own imaginations, came up the hill and stared after him, the flight had swallowed him up altogether.  The three men stood close. There was not a sound out of the wooded blackness that hid the Farm from their eyes.  \"It's all right,\" said young Fulcher, ending a silence.  \"Don't see any lights,\" said Witherspoon.  \"You wouldn't from here.\"  \"It's misty,\" said the elder Fulcher.  They meditated for a space.  \"'E'd 'ave come back if anything was wrong,\" said young Fulcher, and this seemed so obvious and conclusive that presently old Fulcher said, \"Well,\" and the three went home to bed--thoughtfully I will admit....  A shepherd out by Huckster's Farm heard a squealing in the night that he thought was foxes, and in the morning one of his lambs had been killed, dragged halfway towards Hickleybrow and partially devoured....  The inexplicable part of it all is the absence of any indisputable remains of Skinner!  Many weeks after, amidst the charred ruins of the Experimental Farm, there was found something which may or may not have been a human shoulder-blade and in another part of the ruins a long bone greatly gnawed and equally doubtful. Near the stile going up towards Eyebright there was found a glass eye, and many people discovered thereupon that Skinner owed much of his personal charm to such a possession. It stared out upon the world with that same inevitable effect of detachment, that same severe melancholy that had been the redemption of his else worldly countenance.  And about the ruins industrious research discovered the metal rings and charred coverings of two linen buttons, three shanked buttons entire, and one of that metallic sort which is used in the less conspicuous sutures of the human Oeconomy. These remains have been accepted by persons in authority as conclusive of a destroyed and scattered Skinner, but for my own entire conviction, and in view of his distinctive idiosyncrasy, I must confess I should prefer fewer buttons and more bones.  The glass eye of course has an air of extreme conviction, but if it really _is_ Skinner's--and even Mrs. Skinner did not certainly know if that immobile eye of his was glass--something has changed it from a liquid brown to a serene and confident blue. That shoulder-blade is an extremely doubtful document, and I would like to put it side by side with the gnawed scapulae of a few of the commoner domestic animals before I admitted its humanity.  And where were Skinner's boots, for example? Perverted and strange as a rat's appetite must be, is it conceivable that the same creatures that could leave a lamb only half eaten, would finish up Skinner--hair, bones, teeth, and boots?  I have closely questioned as many as I could of those who knew Skinner at all intimately, and they one and all agree that they cannot imagine _anything_ eating him. He was the sort of man, as a retired seafaring person living in one of Mr. W.W. Jacobs' cottages at Dunton Green told me, with a guarded significance of manner not uncommon in those parts, who would \"get washed up anyhow,\" and as regards _the_ devouring element was \"fit to put a fire out.\" He considered that Skinner would be as safe on a raft as anywhere. The retired seafaring man added that he wished to say nothing whatever against Skinner; facts were facts. And rather than have his clothes made by Skinner, the retired seafaring man remarked he would take his chance of being locked up. These observations certainly do not present Skinner in the light of an appetising object.  To be perfectly frank with the reader, I do not believe he ever went back to the Experimental Farm. I believe he hovered through long hesitations about the fields of the Hickleybrow glebe, and finally, when that squealing began, took the line of least resistance out of his perplexities into the Incognito.  And in the Incognito, whether of this or of some other world unknown to us, he obstinately and quite indisputably has remained to this day....     CHAPTER THE THIRD.  THE GIANT RATS.   I.  It was two nights after the disappearance of Mr. Skinner that the Podbourne doctor was out late near Hankey, driving in his buggy. He had been up all night assisting another undistinguished citizen into this curious world of ours, and his task accomplished, he was driving homeward in a drowsy mood enough. It was about two o'clock in the morning, and the waning moon was rising. The summer night had gone cold, and there was a low-lying whitish mist that made things indistinct. He was quite alone--for his coachman was ill in bed--and there was nothing to be seen on either hand but a drifting mystery of hedge running athwart the yellow glare of his lamps, and nothing to hear but the clitter-clatter of his horses and the gride and hedge echo of his wheels. His horse was as trustworthy as himself, and one does not wonder that he dozed....  You know that intermittent drowsing as one sits, the drooping of the head, the nodding to the rhythm of the wheels then chin upon the breast, and at once the sudden start up again.  _Pitter, litter, patter_.  \"What was that?\"  It seemed to the doctor he had heard a thin shrill squeal close at hand. For a moment he was quite awake. He said a word or two of undeserved rebuke to his horse, and looked about him. He tried to persuade himself that he had heard the distant squeal of a fox--or perhaps a young rabbit gripped by a ferret.  _Swish, swish, swish, pitter, patter, swish_--...  What was that?  He felt he was getting fanciful. He shook his shoulders and told his horse to get on. He listened, and heard nothing.  Or was it nothing?  He had the queerest impression that something had just peeped over the hedge at him, a queer big head. With round ears! He peered hard, but he could see nothing.  \"Nonsense,\" said he.  He sat up with an idea that he had dropped into a nightmare, gave his horse the slightest touch of the whip, spoke to it and peered again over the hedge. The glare of his lamp, however, together with the mist, rendered things indistinct, and he could distinguish nothing. It came into his head, he says, that there could be nothing there, because if there was his horse would have shied at it. Yet for all that his senses remained nervously awake.  Then he heard quite distinctly a soft pattering of feet in pursuit along the road.  He would not believe his ears about that. He could not look round, for the road had a sinuous curve just there. He whipped up his horse and glanced sideways again. And then he saw quite distinctly where a ray from his lamp leapt a low stretch of hedge, the curved back of--some big animal, he couldn't tell what, going along in quick convulsive leaps.  He says he thought of the old tales of witchcraft--the thing was so utterly unlike any animal he knew, and he tightened his hold on the reins for fear of the fear of his horse. Educated man as he was, he admits he asked himself if this could be something that his horse could not see.  Ahead, and drawing near in silhouette against the rising moon, was the outline of the little hamlet of Hankey, comforting, though it showed never a light, and he cracked his whip and spoke again, and then in a flash the rats were at him!  He had passed a gate, and as he did so, the foremost rat came leaping over into the road. The thing sprang upon him out of vagueness into the utmost clearness, the sharp, eager, round-eared face, the long body exaggerated by its movement; and what particularly struck him, the pink, webbed forefeet of the beast. What must have made it more horrible to him at the time was, that he had no idea the thing was any created beast he knew. He did not recognise it as a rat, because of the size. His horse gave a bound as the thing dropped into the road beside it. The little lane woke into tumult at the report of the whip and the doctor's shout. The whole thing suddenly went fast.  _Rattle-clatter, clash, clatter_.  The doctor, one gathers, stood up, shouted to his horse, and slashed with all his strength. The rat winced and swerved most reassuringly at his blow--in the glare of his lamp he could see the fur furrow under the lash--and he slashed again and again, heedless and unaware of the second pursuer that gained upon his off side.  He let the reins go, and glanced back to discover the third rat in pursuit behind....  His horse bounded forward. The buggy leapt high at a rut. For a frantic minute perhaps everything seemed to be going in leaps and bounds....  It was sheer good luck the horse came down in Hankey, and not either before or after the houses had been passed.  No one knows how the horse came down, whether it stumbled or whether the rat on the off side really got home with one of those slashing down strokes of the teeth (given with the full weight of the body); and the doctor never discovered that he himself was bitten until he was inside the brickmaker's house, much less did he discover when the bite occurred, though bitten he was and badly--a long slash like the slash of a double tomahawk that had cut two parallel ribbons of flesh from his left shoulder.  He was standing up in his buggy at one moment, and in the next he had leapt to the ground, with his ankle, though he did not know it, badly sprained, and he was cutting furiously at a third rat that was flying directly at him. He scarcely remembers the leap he must have made over the top of the wheel as the buggy came over, so obliteratingly hot and swift did his impressions rush upon him. I think myself the horse reared up with the rat biting again at its throat, and fell sideways, and carried the whole affair over; and that the doctor sprang, as it were, instinctively. As the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11696"],["title","The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth (#8)"],["body","came down, the receiver of the lamp smashed, and suddenly poured a flare of blazing oil, a thud of white flame, into the struggle.  That was the first thing the brickmaker saw.  He had heard the clatter of the doctor's approach and--though the doctor's memory has nothing of this--wild shouting. He had got out of bed hastily, and as he did so came the terrific smash, and up shot the glare outside the rising blind. \"It was brighter than day,\" he says. He stood, blind cord in hand, and stared out of the window at a nightmare transformation of the familiar road before him. The black figure of the doctor with its whirling whip danced out against the flame. The horse kicked indistinctly, half hidden by the blaze, with a rat at its throat. In the obscurity against the churchyard wall, the eyes of a second monster shone wickedly. Another--a mere dreadful blackness with red-lit eyes and flesh-coloured hands--clutched unsteadily on the wall coping to which it had leapt at the flash of the exploding lamp.  You know the keen face of a rat, those two sharp teeth, those pitiless eyes. Seen magnified to near six times its linear dimensions, and still more magnified by darkness and amazement and the leaping fancies of a fitful blaze, it must have been an ill sight for the brickmaker--still more than half asleep.  Then the doctor had grasped the opportunity, that momentary respite the flare afforded, and was out of the brickmaker's sight below battering the door with the butt of his whip....  The brickmaker would not let him in until he had got a light.  There are those who have blamed the man for that, but until I know my own courage better, I hesitate to join their number.  The doctor yelled and hammered....  The brickmaker says he was weeping with terror when at last the door was opened.  \"Bolt,\" said the doctor, \"bolt\"--he could not say \"bolt the door.\" He tried to help, and was of no service. The brickmaker fastened the door, and the doctor had to sit on the chair beside the clock for a space before he could go upstairs....  \"I don't know what they _are_!\" he repeated several times. \"I don't know what they _are_\"--with a high note on the \"are.\"  The brickmaker would have got him whisky, but the doctor would not be left alone with nothing but a flickering light just then.  It was long before the brickmaker could get him to go upstairs....  And when the fire was out the giant rats came back, took the dead horse, dragged it across the churchyard into the brickfield and ate at it until it was dawn, none even then daring to disturb them....   II.  Redwood went round, to Bensington about eleven the next morning with the \"second editions\" of three evening papers in his hand.  Bensington looked up from a despondent meditation over the forgotten pages of the most distracting novel the Brompton Road librarian had been able to find him. \"Anything fresh?\" he asked.  \"Two men stung near Chartham.\"  \"They ought to let us smoke out that nest. They really did. It's their own fault.\"  \"It's their own fault, certainly,\" said Redwood.  \"Have you heard anything--about buying the farm?\"  \"The House Agent,\" said Redwood, \"is a thing with a big mouth and made of dense wood. It pretends someone else is after the house--it always does, you know--and won't understand there's a hurry. 'This is a matter of life and death,' I said, 'don't you understand?' It drooped its eyes half shut and said, 'Then why don't you go the other two hundred pounds?' I'd rather live in a world of solid wasps than give in to the stonewalling stupidity of that offensive creature. I--\"  He paused, feeling that a sentence like that might very easily be spoiled by its context.  \"It's too much to hope,\" said Bensington, \"that one of the wasps--\"  \"The wasp has no more idea of public utility than a--than a House Agent,\" said Redwood.  He talked for a little while about house agents and solicitors and people of that sort, in the unjust, unreasonable way that so many people do somehow get to talk of these business calculi (\"Of all the cranky things in this cranky world, it is the most cranky to my mind of all, that while we expect honour, courage, efficiency, from a doctor or a soldier as a matter of course, a solicitor or a house agent is not only permitted but expected to display nothing but a sort of greedy, greasy, obstructive, over-reaching imbecility--\" etc.)--and then, greatly relieved, he went to the window and stared out at the Sloane Street traffic.  Bensington had put the most exciting novel conceivable on the little table that carried his electric standard. He joined the fingers of his opposed hands very carefully and regarded them. \"Redwood,\" he said. \"Do they say much about _Us_?\"  \"Not so much as I should expect.\"  \"They don't denounce us at all?\"  \"Not a bit. But, on the other hand, they don't back up what I point out must be done. I've written to the _Times_, you know, explaining the whole thing--\"  \"We take the _Daily Chronicle_,\" said Bensington.  \"And the _Times_ has a long leader on the subject--a very high-class, well-written leader, with three pieces of _Times_ Latin--_status quo_ is one--and it reads like the voice of Somebody Impersonal of the Greatest Importance suffering from Influenza Headache and talking through sheets and sheets of felt without getting any relief from it whatever. Reading between the lines, you know, it's pretty clear that the _Times_ considers that it is useless to mince matters, and that something (indefinite of course) has to be done at once. Otherwise still more undesirable consequences--_Times_ English, you know, for more wasps and stings. Thoroughly statesmanlike article!\"  \"And meanwhile this Bigness is spreading in all sorts of ugly ways.\"  \"Precisely.\"  \"I wonder if Skinner was right about those big rats--\"  \"Oh no! That would be too much,\" said Redwood.  He came and stood by Bensington's chair.  \"By-the-bye,\" he said, with a slightly lowered voice, \"how does _she_--?\"  He indicated the closed door.  \"Cousin Jane? She simply knows nothing about it. Doesn't connect us with it and won't read the articles. 'Gigantic wasps!' she says, 'I haven't patience to read the papers.'\"  \"That's very fortunate,\" said Redwood.  \"I suppose--Mrs. Redwood--?\"  \"No,\" said Redwood, \"just at present it happens--she's terribly worried about the child. You know, he keeps on.\"  \"Growing?\"  \"Yes. Put on forty-one ounces in ten days. Weighs nearly four stone. And only six months old! Naturally rather alarming.\"  \"Healthy?\"  \"Vigorous. His nurse is leaving because he kicks so forcibly. And everything, of course, shockingly outgrown. Everything, you know, has had to be made fresh, clothes and everything. Perambulator--light affair--broke one wheel, and the youngster had to be brought home on the milkman's hand-truck. Yes. Quite a crowd.... And we've put Georgina Phyllis back into his cot and put him into the bed of Georgina Phyllis. His mother--naturally alarmed. Proud at first and inclined to praise Winkles. Not now. Feels the thing _can't_ be wholesome. _You_ know.\"  \"I imagined you were going to put him on diminishing doses.\"  \"I tried it.\"  \"Didn't it work?\"  \"Howls. In the ordinary way the cry of a child is loud and distressing; it is for the good of the species that this should be so--but since he has been on the Herakleophorbia treatment---\"  \"Mm,\" said Bensington, regarding his fingers with more resignation than he had hitherto displayed.  \"Practically the thing _must_ come out. People will hear of this child, connect it up with our hens and things, and the whole thing will come round to my wife.... How she will take it I haven't the remotest idea.\"  \"It _is_ difficult,\" said Mr. Bensington, \"to form any plan--certainly.\"  He removed his glasses and wiped them carefully.  \"It is another instance,\" he generalised, \"of the thing that is continually happening. We--if indeed I may presume to the adjective--_scientific_ men--we work of course always for a theoretical result--a purely theoretical result. But, incidentally, we do set forces in operation--_new_ forces. We mustn't control them--and nobody else _can_. Practically, Redwood, the thing is out of our hands. _We_ supply the material--\"  \"And they,\" said Redwood, turning to the window, \"get the experience.\"  \"So far as this trouble down in Kent goes I am not disposed to worry further.\"  \"Unless they worry us.\"  \"Exactly. And if they like to muddle about with solicitors and pettifoggers and legal obstructions and weighty considerations of the tomfool order, until they have got a number of new gigantic species of vermin well established--Things always _have_ been in a muddle, Redwood.\"  Redwood traced a twisted, tangled line in the air.  \"And our real interest lies at present with your boy.\"  Redwood turned about and came and stared at his collaborator.  \"What do you think of him, Bensington? You can look at this business with a greater detachment than I can. What am I to do about him?\"  \"Go on feeding him.\"  \"On Herakleophorbia?\"  \"On Herakleophorbia.\"  \"And then he'll grow.\"  \"He'll grow, as far as I can calculate from the hens and the wasps, to the height of about five-and-thirty feet--with everything in proportion---\"  \"And then what'll he do?\"  \"That,\" said Mr. Bensington, \"is just what makes the whole thing so interesting.\"  \"Confound it, man! Think of his clothes.\"  \"And when he's grown up,\" said Redwood, \"he'll only be one solitary Gulliver in a pigmy world.\"  Mr. Bensington's eye over his gold rim was pregnant.  \"Why solitary?\" he said, and repeated still more darkly, \"_Why_ solitary?\"  \"But you don't propose---?\"  \"I said,\" said Mr. Bensington, with the self-complacency of a man who has produced a good significant saying, \"Why solitary?\"  \"Meaning that one might bring up other children---?\"  \"Meaning nothing beyond my inquiry.\"  Redwood began to walk about the room. \"Of course,\" he said, \"one might--But still! What are we coming to?\"  Bensington evidently enjoyed his line of"]]]
