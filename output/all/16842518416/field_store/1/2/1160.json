We vie with one another in the splendor of our accoutrements when trapped for the observance of the lighter duties of life, though when we take the field our leather is the plainest I ever have seen worn by fighting men of Barsoom. We pride ourselves, too, upon our physical beauty, and especially upon the beauty of our women. May I dare to say, Tara of Helium, that I am hoping for the day when you will visit Gathol that my people may see one who is really beautiful?\"  \"The women of Helium are taught to frown with displeasure upon the tongue of the flatterer,\" rejoined the girl, but Gahan, Jed of Gathol, observed that she smiled as she said it.  A bugle sounded, clear and sweet, above the laughter and the talk. \"The Dance of Barsoom!\" exclaimed the young warrior. \"I claim you for it, Tara of Helium.\"  The girl glanced in the direction of the bench where she had last seen Djor Kantos. He was not in sight. She inclined her head in assent to the claim of the Gatholian. Slaves were passing among the guests, distributing small musical instruments of a single string. Upon each instrument were characters which indicated the pitch and length of its tone. The instruments were of skeel, the string of gut, and were shaped to fit the left forearm of the dancer, to which it was strapped. There was also a ring wound with gut which was worn between the first and second joints of the index finger of the right hand and which, when passed over the string of the instrument, elicited the single note required of the dancer.  The guests had risen and were slowly making their way toward the expanse of scarlet sward at the south end of the gardens where the dance was to be held, when Djor Kantos came hurriedly toward Tara of Helium. \"I claim--\" he exclaimed as he neared her; but she interrupted him with a gesture.  \"You are too late, Djor Kantos,\" she cried in mock anger. \"No laggard may claim Tara of Helium; but haste now lest thou lose also Olvia Marthis, whom I have never seen wait long to be claimed for this or any other dance.\"  \"I have already lost her,\" admitted Djor Kantos ruefully.  \"And you mean to say that you came for Tara of Helium only after having lost Olvia Marthis?\" demanded the girl, still simulating displeasure.  \"Oh, Tara of Helium, you know better than that,\" insisted the young man. \"Was it not natural that I should assume that you would expect me, who alone has claimed you for the Dance of Barsoom for at least twelve times past?\"  \"And sit and play with my thumbs until you saw fit to come for me?\" she questioned. \"Ah, no, Djor Kantos; Tara of Helium is for no laggard,\" and she threw him a sweet smile and passed on toward the assembling dancers with Gahan, Jed of far Gathol.  The Dance of Barsoom bears a relation similar to the more formal dancing functions of Mars that The Grand March does to ours, though it is infinitely more intricate and more beautiful. Before a Martian youth of either sex may attend an important social function where there is dancing, he must have become proficient in at least three dances--The Dance of Barsoom, his national dance, and the dance of his city. In these three dances the dancers furnish their own music, which never varies; nor do the steps or figures vary, having been handed down from time immemorial. All Barsoomian dances are stately and beautiful, but The Dance of Barsoom is a wondrous epic of motion and harmony--there is no grotesque posturing, no vulgar or suggestive movements. It has been described as the interpretation of the highest ideals of a world that aspired to grace and beauty and chastity in woman, and strength and dignity and loyalty in man.  Today, John Carter, Warlord of Mars, with Dejah Thoris, his mate, led in the dancing, and if there was another couple that vied with them in possession of the silent admiration of the guests it was the resplendent Jed of Gathol and his beautiful partner. In the ever-changing figures of the dance the man found himself now with the girl's hand in his and again with an arm about the lithe body that the jeweled harness but inadequately covered, and the girl, though she had danced a thousand dances in the past, realized for the first time the personal contact of a man's arm against her naked flesh. It troubled her that she should notice it, and she looked up questioningly and almost with displeasure at the man as though it was his fault. Their eyes met and she saw in his that which she had never seen in the eyes of Djor Kantos. It was at the very end of the dance and they both stopped suddenly with the music and stood there looking straight into each other's eyes. It was Gahan of Gathol who spoke first.  \"Tara of Helium, I love you!\" he said.  The girl drew herself to her full height. \"The Jed of Gathol forgets himself,\" she exclaimed haughtily.  \"The Jed of Gathol would forget everything but you, Tara of Helium,\" he replied. Fiercely he pressed the soft hand that he still retained from the last position of the dance. \"I love you, Tara of Helium,\" he repeated. \"Why should your ears refuse to hear what your eyes but just now did not refuse to see--and answer?\"  \"What meanest thou?\" she cried. \"Are the men of Gathol such boors, then?\"  \"They are neither boors nor fools,\" he replied, quietly. \"They know when they love a woman--and when she loves them.\"  Tara of Helium stamped her little foot in anger. \"Go!\" she said, \"before it is necessary to acquaint my father with the dishonor of his guest.\"  She turned and walked away. \"Wait!\" cried the man. \"Just another word.\"  \"Of apology?\" she asked.  \"Of prophecy,\" he said.  \"I do not care to hear it,\" replied Tara of Helium, and left him standing there. She was strangely unstrung and shortly thereafter returned to her own quarter of the palace, where she stood for a long time by a window looking out beyond the scarlet tower of Greater Helium toward the northwest.  Presently she turned angrily away. \"I hate him!\" she exclaimed aloud.  \"Whom?\" inquired the privileged Uthia.  Tara of Helium stamped her foot. \"That ill-mannered boor, the Jed of Gathol,\" she replied.  Uthia raised her slim brows.  At the stamping of the little foot, a great beast rose from the corner of the room and crossed to Tara of Helium where it stood looking up into her face. She placed her hand upon the ugly head. \"Dear old Woola,\" she said; \"no love could be deeper than yours, yet it never offends. Would that men might pattern themselves after you!\"    CHAPTER II  AT THE GALE'S MERCY  Tara of Helium did not return to her father's guests, but awaited in her own apartments the word from Djor Kantos which she knew must come, begging her to return to the gardens. She would then refuse, haughtily. But no appeal came from Djor Kantos. At first Tara of Helium was angry, then she was hurt, and always she was puzzled. She could not understand. Occasionally she thought of the Jed of Gathol and then she would stamp her foot, for she was very angry indeed with Gahan. The presumption of the man! He had insinuated that he read love for him in her eyes. Never had she been so insulted and humiliated. Never had she so thoroughly hated a man. Suddenly she turned toward Uthia.  \"My flying leather!\" she commanded.  \"But the guests!\" exclaimed the slave girl. \"Your father, The Warlord, will expect you to return.\"  \"He will be disappointed,\" snapped Tara of Helium.  The slave hesitated. \"He does not approve of your flying alone,\" she reminded her mistress.  The young princess sprang to her feet and seized the unhappy slave by the shoulders, shaking her. \"You are becoming unbearable, Uthia,\" she cried. \"Soon there will be no alternative than to send you to the public slave-market. Then possibly you will find a master to your liking.\"  Tears came to the soft eyes of the slave girl. \"It is because I love you, my princess,\" she said softly. Tara of Helium melted. She took the slave in her arms and kissed her.  \"I have the disposition of a thoat, Uthia,\" she said. \"Forgive me! I love you and there is nothing that I would not do for you and nothing would I do to harm you. Again, as I have so often in the past, I offer you your freedom.\"  \"I do not wish my freedom if it will separate me from you, Tara of Helium,\" replied Uthia. \"I am happy here with you--I think that I should die without you.\"  Again the girls kissed. \"And you will not fly alone, then?\" questioned the slave.  Tara of Helium laughed and pinched her companion. \"You persistent little pest,\" she cried. \"Of course I shall fly--does not Tara of Helium always do that which pleases her?\"  Uthia shook her head sorrowfully. \"Alas! she does,\" she admitted. \"Iron is the Warlord of Barsoom to the influences of all but two. In the hands of Dejah Thoris and Tara of Helium he is as potters' clay.\"  \"Then run and fetch my flying leather like the sweet slave you are,\" directed the mistress.                  *   *   *   *   *  Far out across the ochre sea-bottoms beyond the twin cities of Helium raced the swift flier of Tara of Helium. Thrilling to the speed and the buoyancy and the obedience of the little craft the girl drove toward the northwest. Why she should choose that direction she did not pause to consider. Perhaps because in that direction lay the least known areas of Barsoom, and, ergo, Romance, Mystery, and Adventure. In that direction also lay far Gathol; but to that fact she gave no conscious thought.  She did, however, think occasionally of the jed of that distant kingdom, but the reaction to these thoughts was scarcely pleasurable. They still brought a flush of shame to her cheeks and a surge of angry blood to her heart. She was very angry with the Jed of Gathol, and though she should never see him again she was quite sure that hate of him would remain fresh in her memory forever. Mostly her thoughts revolved about another--Djor Kantos. And when she thought of him she thought also of Olvia Marthis of Hastor. Tara of Helium thought that she was jealous"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1153"],["title","The Chessmen of Mars (#3)"],["body","the fair Olvia and it made her very angry to think that. She was angry with Djor Kantos and herself, but she was not angry at all with Olvia Marthis, whom she loved, and so of course she was not jealous really. The trouble was, that Tara of Helium had failed for once to have her own way. Djor Kantos had not come running like a willing slave when she had expected him, and, ah, here was the nub of the whole thing! Gahan, Jed of Gathol, a stranger, had been a witness to her humiliation. He had seen her unclaimed at the beginning of a great function and he had had to come to her rescue to save her, as he doubtless thought, from the inglorious fate of a wall-flower. At the recurring thought, Tara of Helium could feel her whole body burning with scarlet shame and then she went suddenly white and cold with rage; whereupon she turned her flier about so abruptly that she was all but torn from her lashings upon the flat, narrow deck. She reached home just before dark. The guests had departed. Quiet had descended upon the palace. An hour later she joined her father and mother at the evening meal.  \"You deserted us, Tara of Helium,\" said John Carter. \"It is not what the guests of John Carter should expect.\"  \"They did not come to see me,\" replied Tara of Helium. \"I did not ask them.\"  \"They were no less your guests,\" replied her father.  The girl rose, and came and stood beside him and put her arms about his neck.  \"My proper old Virginian,\" she cried, rumpling his shock of black hair.  \"In Virginia you would be turned over your father's knee and spanked,\" said the man, smiling.  She crept into his lap and kissed him. \"You do not love me any more,\" she announced. \"No one loves me,\" but she could not compose her features into a pout because bubbling laughter insisted upon breaking through.  \"The trouble is there are too many who love you,\" he said. \"And now there is another.\"  \"Indeed!\" she cried. \"What do you mean?\"  \"Gahan of Gathol has asked permission to woo you.\"  The girl sat up very straight and tilted her chin in the air. \"I would not wed with a walking diamond-mine,\" she said. \"I will not have him.\"  \"I told him as much,\" replied her father, \"and that you were as good as betrothed to another. He was very courteous about it; but at the same time he gave me to understand that he was accustomed to getting what he wanted and that he wanted you very much. I suppose it will mean another war. Your mother's beauty kept Helium at war for many years, and--well, Tara of Helium, if I were a young man I should doubtless be willing to set all Barsoom afire to win you, as I still would to keep your divine mother,\" and he smiled across the sorapus table and its golden service at the undimmed beauty of Mars' most beautiful woman.  \"Our little girl should not yet be troubled with such matters,\" said Dejah Thoris. \"Remember, John Carter, that you are not dealing with an Earth child, whose span of life would be more than half completed before a daughter of Barsoom reached actual maturity.\"  \"But do not the daughters of Barsoom sometimes marry as early as twenty?\" he insisted.  \"Yes, but they will still be desirable in the eyes of men after forty generations of Earth folk have returned to dust--there is no hurry, at least, upon Barsoom. We do not fade and decay here as you tell me those of your planet do, though you, yourself, belie your own words. When the time seems proper Tara of Helium shall wed with Djor Kantos, and until then let us give the matter no further thought.\"  \"No,\" said the girl, \"the subject irks me, and I shall not marry Djor Kantos, or another--I do not intend to wed.\"  Her father and mother looked at her and smiled. \"When Gahan of Gathol returns he may carry you off,\" said the former.  \"He has gone?\" asked the girl.  \"His flier departs for Gathol in the morning,\" John Carter replied.  \"I have seen the last of him then,\" remarked Tara of Helium with a sigh of relief.  \"He says not,\" returned John Carter.  The girl dismissed the subject with a shrug and the conversation passed to other topics. A letter had arrived from Thuvia of Ptarth, who was visiting at her father's court while Carthoris, her mate, hunted in Okar. Word had been received that the Tharks and Warhoons were again at war, or rather that there had been an engagement, for war was their habitual state. In the memory of man there had been no peace between these two savage green hordes--only a single temporary truce. Two new battleships had been launched at Hastor. A little band of holy therns was attempting to revive the ancient and discredited religion of Issus, who they claimed still lived in spirit and had communicated with them. There were rumors of war from Dusar. A scientist claimed to have discovered human life on the further moon. A madman had attempted to destroy the atmosphere plant. Seven people had been assassinated in Greater Helium during the last ten zodes, (the equivalent of an Earth day).  Following the meal Dejah Thoris and The Warlord played at jetan, the Barsoomian game of chess, which is played upon a board of a hundred alternate black and orange squares. One player has twenty black pieces, the other, twenty orange pieces. A brief description of the game may interest those Earth readers who care for chess, and will not be lost upon those who pursue this narrative to its conclusion, since before they are done they will find that a knowledge of jetan will add to the interest and the thrills that are in store for them.  The men are placed upon the board as in chess upon the first two rows next the players. In order from left to right on the line of squares nearest the players, the jetan pieces are Warrior, Padwar, Dwar, Flier, Chief, Princess, Flier, Dwar, Padwar, Warrior. In the next line all are Panthans except the end pieces, which are called Thoats, and represent mounted warriors.  The Panthans, which are represented as warriors with one feather, may move one space in any direction except backward; the Thoats, mounted warriors with three feathers, may move one straight and one diagonal, and may jump intervening pieces; Warriors, foot soldiers with two feathers, straight in any direction, or diagonally, two spaces; Padwars, lieutenants wearing two feathers, two diagonal in any direction, or combination; Dwars, captains wearing three feathers, three spaces straight in any direction, or combination; Fliers, represented by a propellor with three blades, three spaces in any direction, or combination, diagonally, and may jump intervening pieces; the Chief, indicated by a diadem with ten jewels, three spaces in any direction, straight, or diagonal; Princess, diadem with a single jewel, same as Chief, and can jump intervening pieces.  The game is won when a player places any of his pieces on the same square with his opponent's Princess, or when a Chief takes a Chief. It is drawn when a Chief is taken by any opposing piece other than the opposing Chief; or when both sides have been reduced to three pieces, or less, of equal value, and the game is not terminated in the following ten moves, five apiece. This is but a general outline of the game, briefly stated.  It was this game that Dejah Thoris and John Carter were playing when Tara of Helium bid them good night, retiring to her own quarters and her sleeping silks and furs. \"Until morning, my beloved,\" she called back to them as she passed from the apartment, nor little did she guess, nor her parents, that this might indeed be the last time that they would ever set eyes upon her.  The morning broke dull and gray. Ominous clouds billowed restlessly and low. Beneath them torn fragments scudded toward the northwest. From her window Tara of Helium looked out upon this unusual scene. Dense clouds seldom overcast the Barsoomian sky. At this hour of the day it was her custom to ride one of those small thoats that are the saddle animals of the red Martians, but the sight of the billowing clouds lured her to a new adventure. Uthia still slept and the girl did not disturb her. Instead, she dressed quietly and went to the hangar upon the roof of the palace directly above her quarters where her own swift flier was housed. She had never driven through the clouds. It was an adventure that always she had longed to experience. The wind was strong and it was with difficulty that she maneuvered the craft from the hangar without accident, but once away it raced swiftly out above the twin cities. The buffeting winds caught and tossed it, and the girl laughed aloud in sheer joy of the resultant thrills. She handled the little ship like a veteran, though few veterans would have faced the menace of such a storm in so light a craft. Swiftly she rose toward the clouds, racing with the scudding streamers of the storm-swept fragments, and a moment later she was swallowed by the dense masses billowing above. Here was a new world, a world of chaos unpeopled except for herself; but it was a cold, damp, lonely world and she found it depressing after the novelty of it had been dissipated, by an overpowering sense of the magnitude of the forces surging about her. Suddenly she felt very lonely and very cold and very little. Hurriedly, therefore, she rose until presently her craft broke through into the glorious sunlight that transformed the upper surface of the somber element into rolling masses of burnished silver. Here it was still cold, but without the dampness of the clouds, and in the eye of the brilliant sun her spirits rose with the mounting needle of her altimeter. Gazing at the clouds, now far beneath, the girl experienced the sensation of hanging stationary in mid-heaven; but the whirring of her propellor, the wind beating upon her, the high figures that rose and fell beneath the glass of her speedometer, these told her that her speed was terrific. It was then that she determined to turn back.  The first attempt she made above the clouds, but it was unsuccessful. To her surprise she discovered that she could not "]]]
