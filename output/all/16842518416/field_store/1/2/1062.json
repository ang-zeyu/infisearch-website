So did Sir Louis:  \"Good.  There'll be no need, then, for you to take any one into confidence,\" he said, turning to me again.  \"As a rule it isn't well to talk about these things, because people get wrong ideas. There are others in Jerusalem who would like permission to go to El-Kerak.\"  \"I'll tell nobody.\"  He nodded again.  He was still considering things in the back of his mind, while those intelligent, bright eyes smiled so disarmingly.  \"How do you propose to reach the Dead Sea?\" he asked.  \"Ben Nasir's escort will probably meet you on the shore on this side.\"  \"Oh, hire some sort of conveyance, I suppose.\"  \"Couldn't we lend him one of our cars, Grim?\"  Grim nodded again.  \"We'll do that.  Grim, can you get word to ben Nasir so that when the escort is ready he may send a messenger straight to the hotel with the information?  D'you get my meaning?\"  \"Sure,\" said Grim, \"nobody else need know then.\"  \"Very well,\" said Sir Louis.  He rose from his chair to intimate that the precise moment had arrived when I might leave without indiscretion.  It was not until I was outside the door that I realized that my permission was simply verbal, and that the only document that had changed hands had been signed by me.  Grim followed me into the ante-room after a minute.  \"Hadn't I better go back and ask for something in writing from him?\" I suggested.  \"You wouldn't get it.  Anyhow, you're dealing with a gentleman. You needn't worry.  I was afraid once or twice you might be going to ask him questions.  He'd have canned you if you had.  Why didn't you?\"  I was not going to help Grim dissect my mental processes.  \"There's a delightful air of mystery,\" I said, \"I'd hate to spoil it!\"  \"Come up on the tower,\" he said. \"There's just time before sunset.  If you've good eyes, I'll show you El-Kerak.\"  It is an enormous tower.  The wireless apparatus connected with it can talk with Paris and Calcutta.  From the top you feel as if you were seeing \"all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.\"  There are no other buildings to cut off the view or tamper with perspective.  The Dead Sea was growing dark.  The Moab Hills beyond it looked lonely and savage in silhouette.  \"Down there on your left is Jericho,\" said Grim.  \"That winding creek beyond it is the Jordan.  As far eastward as that there's some peace.  Beyond that, there is hardly a rock that isn't used for ambush regularly.  Let your eye travel along the top of the hills--nearly as far as the end of the Dead Sea.  Now--d'you see where a touch of sunlight glints on something?  That's the top of the castle-wall of El-Kerak.  Judge what strategists those old crusaders were.  That site commands the ancient high road from Egypt.  They could sit up there and take toll to their hearts' content.  The Turks quartered troops in the castle and did the same thing.  But the Turks overdid it, like everything else. They ruined the trade.  No road there nowadays that amounts to anything.\"  \"It looks about ten miles away.\"  \"More than eighty.\"  The sun went down behind us while we watched, and here and there the little scattered lights came out among the silent hills in proof that there were humans who thought of them in terms of home.  Venus and Mars shone forth, yellow and red jewels;  then the moon, rising like a stage effect, too big, too strongly lighted to seem real, peering inch by inch above the hills and ushering in silence.  We could hear one muezzin in Jerusalem wailing that God is God.  \"That over yonder is savage country,\" Grim remarked.  \"I think maybe you'll like it. Time to go now.\"  He said nothing more until we were scooting downhill in the car in the midst of a cloud of dust.  \"You won't see me again,\" he said then, \"until you get to El- Kerak.  There are just one or two points to bear in mind.  D'you care if I lecture?\"  \"I wish you would.\"  \"When the messenger comes from ben Nasir, go to the Governorate, just outside the Damascus Gate, phone OETA, say who you are, and ask for the car.  Travel light.  The less you take with you, the less temptation there'll be to steal and that much less danger for your escort.  I always take nothing,  and get shaved by a murderer at the nearest village.  If you wash too much, or change your shirt too often, they suspect you of putting on airs.  Can't travel too light.  Use the car as far as Jericho, or thereabouts, and send it back when the messenger says he's through with it. After that, do whatever the leader of the escort tells you, and you'll be all right.\"  \"How do I cross the Dead Sea?\"  \"That's ben Nasir's business.  There's another point I'll ask you to bear in mind.  When you see me at El-Kerak, be sure not to make the slightest sign of recognition, unless and until you get word from me.  Act as if you'd never seen me in your life before.\"  I felt like an arch-conspirator, and there is no other sensation half so thrilling.  The flattery of being let in, as it were, through a secret door was like strong wine.  \"Is your memory good?\" Grim asked me.  \"If you make notes, be sure you let everybody see them;  you'll find more than one of them can read English.  If you should see or overhear anything that you'd particularly like to remember because it might prove useful to me, note it down by making faint dots under the letters of words you've already written;  or--better yet--take along a pocket Bible;  they're all religious and respect the Bible.  Make faint pencil lines underneath words or letters, and they'll think you're more than extra devout.  There's nothing special to watch out for;  just keep your ears and eyes open.  Well, here's your hotel.  See you again soon.  So long.\"  I got out of the car and went to get ready for a Christian dinner served by Moslems, feeling like a person out of the Arabian Nights, who had just met the owner of a magic carpet on which one only had to sit in order to be wafted by invisible forces into unimaginable realms of mystery.      Chapter Three  \"Do whatever the leader of the escort tells you.\"   I never learned exactly how Jim Grim got word to ben Nasir.  My suspicion is that he took the simple course of getting the American Colony to send one of their men;  but as they never referred to it afterwards, and might have their own reasons for keeping silence, I took care not to ask them.  We have most of us seen harm done by noisy gratitude for kindness, better covered up.  I kept close to the hotel for three days, studying Arabic.  By the fourth afternoon discouragement set in.  I began to believe that the whole affair had petered out;  perhaps on reflection the Administrator had decided I was not a proper person to be turned loose out of bounds, and nobody could have blamed him for that, for he knew next to nothing about me.  Or Grim might have been called off for some other important business.  The chances seemed all against my going after all.  But on the fourth evening, just at sunset, when the sandwiches I had ordered in advance were all thoroughly stale and I had almost decided to unpack the small hand-grip and try to forget the whole affair, I noticed an Arab standing in the door of the hotel scrutinizing every one who passed him.  I watched him for five minutes.  He paid no attention to officers in uniform.  I left my chair in the lobby and walked past him twice.  He had one eye, like a gimlet on a universal joint;  he turned it this and that way without any corresponding movement of his head.  It penetrated.  You felt he could have seen you with it in the dark.  I started to pass him a third time.  He held his hand out and thrust a small, soiled piece of paper into mine.  The writing on it was in Arabic, so I went back to the seat in the far corner, to puzzle it out, he standing meanwhile in the doorway and continuing to quiz people as if I had meant nothing in his life. The message was short enough:   Bearer will accompany you to a place where the escort will be in readiness.  God give your honour a good journey.  Mustapha Ben Nasir.   I went to the Governorate and phoned for the car to come and pick me up outside the Jaffa Gate.  The Arab followed me, and he and I were both searched at the gate for weapons, by a Sikh who knew nothing and cared less about Near East politics.  His orders were to search thoroughly.  He did it.  The man whose turn was next ahead of mine was a Russian priest, whose long black cloak did not save him from painstaking suspicion.  He was still indignantly refusing to take down his pants and prove that the hard lump on his thigh was really an amulet against sciatica, when the car came for me.  It was an ordinary Ford car, and the driver was not in uniform. He, too, had only one eye in full commission, for the other was bruised and father swollen.  I got in beside him and let the Arab have the rear seat to himself, reflecting that I would be able to smell all the Arab sweat I cared to in the days to come.  We are governed much more by our noses than we are often aware of, and I believe that many people--in the East especially--use scent because intuition warns them that their true smell would arouse unconscious antagonism.  Dogs, as well as most wild animals, fight at the suggestion of a smell.  Humans only differ from the animals, much, when they are being self-consciously human.  Then they forget what they really know and tumble headlong into trouble.  The driver seemed to know which road to take, and to be in no particular hurry, perhaps on account of his injured eye.  He was an ex-soldier, of course:  one of those under-sized Cockneys with the Whitechapel pallor overlying a pugnacious instinct, who make such astonishing fighting-men in the intervals between sulking and a sort of half-affectionate abuse of everything in sight. Being impatient to begin the adventure, I suggested more speed.  \"Oh!\" he answered.  \"So you're another o' these people in an "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11357"],["title","Jimgrim and Allah's Peace (#5)"],["body","'urry to get to Jericho!  It's strynge.  The last one was a Harab.  Tyke it from me, gov'nor, I've driven the very last Harab as gets more than twenty-five miles an hour out o' me, so 'elp me--\"  He tooled the car out on to the road toward Bethany, and down the steep hill that passes under the Garden of Gethsemane, before vouchsafing another word.  Then, as we started to climb the hill ahead, he jerked his chin in the direction of the sharp turn we had just passed in the bottom of the valley.  \"Took that corner las' time on one wheel!\"  \"For the Arab?\"  \"Aye.  Taught me a lesson.  Never agayn!  I ain't no Arabian Night.  Nor yet no self-immolatin' 'Indoo invitin' no juggernauts to make no pancykes out o' me.  'Enceforth, I drives reasonable. All Harabs may go to 'ell for all o' me.\"  He was itching to tell his story.  He was likely to tell it quicker for not being questioned;  your Cockney dislikes anything he can construe into inquisition.  I remarked that the road didn't seem made for speed--too narrow and too rough--and let it go at that.  He said no more until we reached the village of Bethany, and drew abreast of Lazarus' reputed tomb, where a pack of scavenger-dogs awoke and yelped around the wheels.  He did his best to run over one of them, but missed.  Then he could not hold his story any longer.  \"Two nights ago,\" he said, \"they gives me orders to take a Harab to a point near Jericho.  After dark, I starts off, 'im on the back seat;  engine ain't warm yet, so we goes slow.  He leans forward after a couple o' minutes, an says 'Yalla kawam'!\" *  So I thinks to myself I'll show the blighter a thing or two, me not bein' used to takin' orders from no Harabs.  Soon as the engine's 'ot I lets rip, an' you know now what the road's like.  When we gets to the top o' that 'ill above Gethsemane I lets extry special rip.  Thinks I, if you can stand what I can, my son, you've guts. [*Hurry up.]  \"Well, we 'its all the 'igh places, and lands on a bit o' level road just often enough to pick up more speed--comes round that sharp bend on 'alf a wheel, syme as I told you--kills three pye- dogs for sure, an' maybe others, but I don't dare look round-- misses a camel in the dark that close that the 'air on my arms an' legs fair crawled up an' down me--'it's a lump o' rock that comes near tippin' us into the ditch--an' carries on faster an' ever.  By the time we gets 'ere to Bethany, thinks I, it's time to take a look an' see if my passenger's still in the bloomin' car.  So I slows down.  \"The minute I turns my 'ead to 'ave a peer at 'im.  'Kawam!' 'e says. 'Quick!  Quick!'  \"So it strikes me I weren't in no such 'urry after all.  Why 'urry for a Harab?  The car's been rattlin' worse 'n a tinker's basket.  I gets down to lave a look--lights a gasper*--an' takes my bloomin' time about it.  You seen them yellow curs there by Lazarus' tomb?  Well, they come for me, yappin' an' snarlin' to beat 'ell.  I'm pickin' up stones to break their 'eads with--good stones ain't such easy findin' in the dark, an' every time I stoops 'alf a dozen curs makes a rush for me--when what d'you suppose?  That bloomin' Harab passenger o' mine vaults over into my seat, an' afore I could say ''ell's bells' 'e's off.  I'd left the engine runnin'.  By the luck o' the Lord I 'angs on, an' scrambles in--back seat. [*Anglice--canteen cigarette.]  \"I thought at first I'd reach over an' get a half-nelson on 'im from behind.  But, strike me blind!  I didn't dare!  \"Look where we are now.  Can you see the 'air-pin turn at the bottom of this 'ill, with a ditch, beyond it?  Well, we takes that turn in pitch-dark shadow with all four wheels in the air, an' you'd 'a thought we was a blinkin' airplane a doin' stunts. But 'e's a hexpert, 'e is, an' we 'olds the road.  From there on we goes in one 'oly murderin' streak to a point about 'alf-way up the 'ill where the Inn of the Good Samaritan stands on top. There we 'as two blow-outs simultaneous, an' thinks I, now, my son, I've got you!  I gets out.  \"'You can drive,' I says, 'like Jehu son o' Nimshi what made Israel to sin.  Let's see you make bricks now without no bleedin' straw'!  I knew there weren't no tools under the seat--there never are in this 'ere country if you've left your car out o' your sight for five minutes.  'You take off them two back tires,' I says, 'while I sit 'ere an meditate on the ways of Harabs! Maybe you're Moses,' I says, 'an know 'ow to work a miracle.'  \"But the only miracle about that bloke's 'is nerve.  'E gets out, 'an begins to walk straight on up'ill without as much as a by- your-leave.  I shouts to 'im to come back.  But 'e walks on.  So I picks up a stone off the pile I was sittin' on, an' I plugs 'im good--'its 'im fair between the shoulder-blades.  You'd think, if 'e was a Harab, that'ud bring 'im to 'is senses, wouldn't you? But what d'you suppose the blighter did?  \"Did you notice my left eye when you got in the car?  'E turns back, an' thinks I, 'e's goin' to knife me.  But that sport could use 'is fists, an' believe me, 'e done it!  I can use 'em a bit myself, an' I starts in to knock 'is block off, but 'e puts it all over me--weight, reach an' science.  Mind you, science! First Arab ever I see what 'ad science;  an' I don't more than 'alf believe it now!  \"Got to 'and it to 'im.  'E was merciful.  'E let up on me the minute 'e see I'd 'ad enough.  'E starts off up'ill again.  I sits where 'e'd knocked me on to a stone pile, wishin' like 'ell for a drink.  It was full moonlight, an' you could see for miles. After about fifteen minutes, me still meditatin' murder an' considerin' my thirst I seen 'em fetch a camel out o' the khan at the Inn o' the Good Samaritan;  an' next thing you know, 'e's out o' sight.  Thinks I, that's the last of 'im, an' good riddance! But not a bit of it!  \"The men what fetched the camel for 'im comes down to me an' says the sheikh 'as left word I'm to be fed an' looked after.  They fixes me up at the inn with a cot an' blankets an' a supper o' sorts, an' I lies awake listenin' to 'em talkin' Arabic, understandin' maybe one word out of six or seven.  From what I can make o' their conjecturin', they think 'e ain't no sheikh at all, but a bloomin' British officer in disguise!  \"Soon as morning comes I jump a passing commissariat lorry.  As soon as I gets to Jerusalem I reports that sheikh for arson, theft, felo de se, busting a gov'ment car, usin' 'is fists when by right 'e should ha' knifed me, an' every other crime I could think of.  An' all I gets is laughed at!  What d'you make of it? Think 'e was a Harab?\"  I wondered whether he was Jimgrim, but did not say so.  Grim had not appeared to me like a man who would use his fists at all readily;  but he was such an unusual individual that it was useless trying to outline what he might or might not do.  It was also quite likely that the chauffeur had omitted mention of, say, nine-tenths of the provocation he gave his passenger.  What interested me most was the thought that, if that really was Jimgrim, he must have been in a prodigious hurry about something; and that most likely meant excitement, if not danger across the Dead Sea.  We caught sight of the Dead Sea presently, bowling past the Inn of the Good Samaritan and beginning to descend into the valley, twelve hundred feet below sea level, that separates Palestine from Moab.  The moon shone full on the water, and it looked more wan and wild than an illustration out of Dante's Inferno.  There was no doubt how the legends sprang up about birds falling dead as they flew across it.  It was difficult to believe that anything could be there and not die.  It was a vision of the land of death made beautiful.  But the one-eyed Arab on the rear seat began to sing.  To him that view meant \"home, sweet home.\"  His song was all about his village and how he loved it--what a pearl it was--how sweeter than all cities.  \"'Ark at 'im!\" The driver stopped the car to fill his pipe. \"You'd think 'e lived in 'eaven!  I've fought over every hinch o' this perishin' country, an' tyke it from me, guv'nor, there ain't a village in it but what's composed of 'ovels wi' thatched roofs, an' 'eaps o' dung so you can't walk between 'em!  Any one as wants my share o' Palestine can 'ave it!\"  We bumped on again down a road so lonely that it would have felt good to see a wild beast, or an armed man lurking in wait for us. But the British had accomplished the impossible:  They had so laid the fear of law along those roads that, though there might be murders to the right and left of them, the passer-by who kept to the road was safe, for the first time since the Romans now and then imposed a temporary peace.  At last, like two yellow streams glistening in moonlight, the road forked--one way toward Jericho.  The other way appeared to run more or less parallel with the Dead Sea.  At that point the one-eyed Arab left off singing at last and clutched the driver's shoulder.  \"All right!  All right!\" he answered impatiently, and stopped. \"Out you get, then!\"  He did not expect the tip I gave him.  He seemed to think it placed him under obligation to wait there and talk for a few minutes.  But my one-eyed guide waved him away disgustedly with the hand that did not hold my bag, and we stood in the road watching until he vanished up-hill out of sight.  Then the guide plucked my sleeve and I followed him along the righthand road. We walked half a mile as fast as he could set foot to the ground.  At last we reached a pretense of a village--a little cluster of half-a-dozen thatched stone huts enclosed within one fence of thorn and cactus.  Everything showed up as clearly in the moonlight as if painted with phosphorus.  The heavy shadows only made the high lights seem more luminous.  A man and two donkeys were waiting for us outside the thorn hedge.  The man made no remark.  My guide and I mounted and rode on.  Presently we turned down a track toward the Dead Sea, riding among huge shadows cast by"]]]
