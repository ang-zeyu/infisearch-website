She rose cheerfully and took the broom from her mother's hand.  \"Lie down a while, mother,\" she said, plumping up the pillows on the couch. Mrs. Gardiner sank down gratefully and Migwan put away her story and went at the sweeping. She soon turned it into a game in which she was a good fairy fighting the hosts of the goblin Dust, and must have them completely vanquished by four o'clock, or her magic wand, which had for the time being taken the shape of a broom, would vanish and leave her weaponless. Needless to say, she was in complete possession of the field when the clock struck the charmed hour. Being then out of the mood to continue her writing, she passed on into the kitchen and attacked the Fortress of Dishes, which she razed to the ground completely, leaving her banner, in the form of the dish towel, flying over the spot.  \"What are you planning for supper?\" she asked her mother, looking into the sitting room to see how she was feeling.  \"Oh, dear, I don't know,\" said Mrs. Gardiner. \"I hadn't given it a thought. I don't believe there's anything left from dinner. Run down to the store, will you, and get a couple of porterhouse steaks, there's a dear. And stop at the baker's as you come by and get us each a cream puff for dessert. Betty is so fond of them.\" Migwan returned to the kitchen and got her mother's pocketbook. There was just twenty-five cents in it. Migwan realized with a shock that it would not pay for what her mother wanted, and her sensitive nature shrank from asking to have things charged.  \"I won't buy the cream puffs,\" she decided. \"I wonder if there is anything in the house I could make into a dessert?\" Search revealed nothing but a bag of prunes, which had been on the shelf for months, and were as dry as a bone. They did not appeal to Migwan in the least, but there was nothing else in evidence. \"I might make prune whip,\" she thought rather doubtfully. \"They're pretty hard, but I can soak them. I'll need the oven to make prune whip, so I will bake the potatoes too.\" She hunted around for the potatoes and finally found them in a small paper bag. \"Buying potatoes two quarts at a time must be rather expensive,\" she reflected. She put the prunes to soak and the potatoes in the oven and went down to the store. \"How much is porterhouse steak?\" she asked before she had the butcher cut any off.  \"Twenty-eight cents a pound,\" answered the man behind the counter. Migwan gave a little gasp. The money she had would not even buy a pound.  \"How much is round steak?\" she inquired.  \"Twenty-two,\" came the reply.  \"Give me twenty-five cents' worth,\" she said. It did not look particularly tender and Migwan thought distressedly how her mother would complain when she found round steak instead of porterhouse. \"But there is no help for it,\" she said to herself grimly, \"beggars cannot be choosers.\" She stopped on the way home to get the recipe for prune whip from Sahwah. Sahwah was not at home, but her mother gave Migwan the recipe and added many directions as to the proper mixing of the ingredients. \"Is--is there any way of making tough round steak tender?\" she asked timidly, just a little ashamed to admit that they had to eat round steak.  \"There certainly is,\" answered Mrs. Brewster. \"You just pound all the flour into it that it will take up. I hardly ever buy porterhouse steaks any more since I learned that trick. I am having some to-night. It is one of our favorite dishes here. Round steak prepared in this way is known in the restaurants as 'Dutch steak,' and commands a high price.\" Considerably cheered by this last intelligence, Migwan sped home and got her prune dessert into the oven and then set to work transforming the tough steak into a tender morsel.  \"What kind of meat is this?\" asked her mother when they had taken their places at the table.  \"Guess,\" said Migwan.  \"It tastes like tenderloin,\" said her mother.  \"Guess again,\" said Migwan gleefully; \"it's round steak.\"  \"The butcher must be buying better meat than usual, then,\" said Mrs. Gardiner. \"I never got such round steak as this out here before.\"  \"And you never will, either,\" said Migwan, swelling with pride, \"if you leave it to the butcher,\" and she told how she had treated the steak to produce the present result.  \"I never heard of that before,\" said her mother, amazed at this simple culinary trick.  Next the prune whip was brought on and pronounced good by every one and \"bully\" by Tom, who ate his in great spoonfuls. \"I see I'll have to let you get the meals after this,\" said Mrs. Gardiner to Migwan. \"You have a knack of putting things together, which I have not.\"  Migwan was too tired to write any more that night after the dishes were done, but she was entirely light-hearted as she wove into her bead band the symbols of that day's achievements--a broom and a frying pan. She had learned something that afternoon besides how to prepare beefsteak. She had waked up to the careless fashion in which the house was being run, and her head was full of plans for cutting down expenses. Monday afternoon, on her way home from school, Migwan saw a farmer's wagon standing in front of the Brewsters' home, and Mrs. Brewster stood at the curb, buying her winter supply of potatoes.  \"Have you put your potatoes in yet?\" she asked as Migwan came along.  Migwan stopped. \"I don't believe we ever bought them in large quantities,\" she answered. \"How much are they a bushel?\"  \"Sixty-five cents,\" said the farmer. Migwan made a quick mental calculation. At the rate they had been buying potatoes in two-quart lots they had been paying a dollar and seventy-five cents a bushel. Migwan came to a sudden decision.  \"Are they all good?\" she asked Mrs. Brewster.  \"They have always been in the past years,\" answered Sahwah's mother, \"and I have bought my potatoes from this man for the last six winters.\"  \"How many would it take for a family of four?\" asked Migwan.  \"About five bushels,\" answered Mrs. Brewster.  \"All right,\" said Migwan to the man; \"bring five bushels over to this address.\" The potatoes were duly deposited in the Gardiner cellar, without asking the advice of Mrs. Gardiner, which was the only safe way of getting things done, for had she been consulted she would surely have wanted to wait a while, and then would have kept putting it off until it was too late. It was the same way with flour and sugar. Migwan found that her mother had been buying these in small quantities at an exorbitant price, and calmly took matters into her own hands, ordering a whole barrel of flour, because there was more in a barrel even than in four sacks. A certain large store was offering a liberal discount that week on fifty pounds of sugar, and Migwan took advantage of this sale also.  Then she had a terrified counting up. Those three items, potatoes, flour and sugar, had used up every cent of that week's income, leaving nothing at all for running expenses. All other supplies would have to be bought on credit. Migwan made a careful estimate of the necessary expenses for the coming week, and pare down as she might, the sum was nearly fifteen dollars. The loss of the rent money was making itself keenly felt. \"Mother,\" she said quietly, looking up from her account book, \"we can't live on fifty-five dollars a month. We must rent the house again immediately.\"  Mrs. Gardiner made a gesture of despair. \"The sign has been up nearly a month, and if people don't make inquiries I can't help it.\"  \"Have you been in the house since the last people moved out?\" asked Migwan.  \"No,\" said Mrs. Gardiner; \"what good would that do? I haven't the time to go all the way over to the East Side to look at that old house. People know it's for rent, and if they want it they'll take it without my sitting over there waiting for them.\"  Nevertheless, Migwan made the long trip the very next day after school to look at the property. \"It's no wonder no one has been making inquiries for it,\" she said when she returned. \"The 'For Rent' sign was gone and I found it later when I was going back up the street. Some boys had used it to make the end piece of a wagon. Then, the plumbing is bad and the cellar is flooded, and the water will not run off in the kitchen sink. These must have been the repairs the old tenants wanted made when you told them you had no money to fix the house, and so they moved. I don't blame them at all.  \"Then, there is another thing I thought of when I was looking through the rooms. You know that big unfinished space over the kitchen? Well, I thought, why can't we make a furnished room of that? There is space enough to build a large room and a bathroom, for part of it is just above the bathroom downstairs. A large furnished room with a private bath would bring in ten dollars a month. It is just at the head of the back stairs and the side door where the back stairs connect with the cellar way could be used as a private entrance, so the tenants of the house would not be disturbed in the least. It would cost over a hundred dollars to do it, most likely, but we could borrow the money from my college fund and the extra rent would soon pay it back.\" Migwan's eyes were shining with ambition.  Mrs. Gardiner shook her head wearily. \"We never could do it,\" she answered. \"Something would surely happen to upset our plans.\"  But Migwan was not to be waved aside. She had seen a vision of increased income and meant to make it come true. She argued the merits of her idea until Mrs. Gardiner was too tired of the subject to argue back, and agreed that if Miss Kent approved the step she would give her consent. Nyoda was therefore called into consultation. She looked at the house and saw no reason why the improvements could not be made to advantage. The house was in a good neighborhood, and furnished rooms were always in demand. She advised the step and gave Mrs. Gardiner the names of several contractors whom she knew to be reliable. Mrs. Gardiner was a little breathless at the speed with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11718"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls at School; Or, The Wohelo Weavers (#5)"],["body","things were moving, but there was no stopping Migwan once she was started. A contractor was engaged and work begun on the house one week from the day Migwan had thought of the plan.  Meanwhile financial matters at home were in bad shape, and Mrs. Gardiner willingly gave over the distribution of the family budget to Migwan. She herself was utterly unable to cope with the problem. And Migwan surprised even herself by the efficient way in which she managed things. By planning menus with the greatest care and omitting meat from the bill of fare to a great extent she made it possible to live on their slender income until the rent would begin to come in again.   \"Whatever have you done with yourself?\" asked Gladys at the weekly meeting of the Camp Fire. \"Of late you rush home from school as if you were pursued.\" Migwan only laughed and said she had had uncommonly hard problems to solve these last few weeks. The other girls of course did not know the exact state of the Gardiner finances, and never dreamed that Migwan was having a struggle even to stay in high school. She was such a fine, aristocratic-looking girl, and was so sparkling and witty all the time that it was hard to connect her with poverty and worry.  \"Let's all go to the matinee next Saturday afternoon,\" suggested Gladys. \"The 'Blue Bird' is going to be played.\" The girls agreed eagerly and asked Gladys to get seats for them, all but Migwan, who said nothing.  \"Don't you want to go, Migwan?\" they asked.  \"Not this time,\" Migwan answered in a casual tone. \"There is something else I have to do Saturday afternoon.\" The girls accepted this explanation readily. It never occurred to them that Migwan could not afford to go.  \"What is this mysterious something you are always doing?\" asked Gladys teasingly. \"Girls, I believe Migwan is writing a book. She has retired from polite society altogether.\" Migwan smiled blandly at her, but made no answer.  At home that night, however, she felt very low-spirited indeed. She was only human, after all, and wanted dreadfully to go to the matinee with the girls. Gladys would take them all to Schiller's afterward for a parfait and bring them home in style in her machine. It did not seem fair that she should be cut off from every pleasure that involved the spending of a little money. This was her last year in high school, the year which should be the happiest, but she must resolutely turn her face away from all those little festivities that add such touches of color to the memory fabric of school days. She knew that at the merest hint of her circumstances to Gladys or Nyoda they would have gladly paid her way everywhere the group went, but Migwan's pride forbade this. If she could not afford to go to places she would stay at home and nobody would be any the wiser. Nevertheless, a few tears would come at the thought of the good time she was missing, and she had no heart to work on her story.  \"Cry-baby!\" she said to herself fiercely, winking the tears back. \"Crying because you can't do as you would like all the time! You're lots better off than poor Hinpoha this very minute, even if she is rich. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\" The thought of Hinpoha, who would likewise miss the jolly party, comforted her somewhat, and she dried her tears and fell to writing with a will.  Now Nyoda, although she did not know just how hard pressed the Gardiners were at that time, rather surmised something of the kind, and wondered, after she left the girls, if that were not the reason for Migwan's not planning to go to the matinee. She remembered Migwan's saying some time before that she wanted very much to see \"The Bluebird\" when it came. She knew it would never do to offer to pay Migwan's way; Migwan was too proud for that. She lay awake a long time over it and finally formulated a plan. The next morning when Migwan came to school she saw a conspicuous notice on the Bulletin Board:  LOST: Handbag containing book of lecture notes and ticket for Saturday afternoon's performance of \"The Bluebird.\" Finder may keep theater ticket if he or she will return notebook to Miss Moore, Room 10.  Migwan read the notice and passed on, as did the other pupils. That morning in English class Nyoda sent Migwan to an unused lecture room to get an English book she had left there. When Migwan opened the door she stumbled over something on the floor. It was a lady's handbag. She opened it and found Miss Moore's notebook and the theater ticket inside. Miss Moore was overjoyed at the return of the notebook and insisted on her keeping the ticket, which Migwan at first declined to accept. \"My dear child,\" said Miss Moore, \"if you knew what trouble I had collecting those notes you would think, too, that it was worth the price of a theater ticket to get them back!\" And when Migwan's back was turned she winked solemnly at Nyoda. By a curious coincidence that seat was directly behind those occupied by the other Winnebagos!     CHAPTER IV.   ANOTHER KITCHEN.  The night of the last Camp Fire Meeting Gladys and Nyoda might have been seen in close consultation. \"The first pleasant Saturday,\" said Nyoda.  \"Remember, it's my treat,\" said Gladys.  The first week in November was as balmy as May, with every promise of fine weather on Saturday. Accordingly, Nyoda gathered all the Winnebagos around her desk on Thursday and made an announcement. Sahwah forgot that she was in a class room and started to raise a joyful whoop, but Nyoda stifled it in time by putting her hand over her mouth. \"I can't help it!\" cried Sahwah; \"we're going on a trip up the river! I'm going to paddle the _Keewaydin_ once more!\"  The plan suggested by Gladys and just announced by Nyoda was this: The following Saturday they would charter a launch big enough to hold them all, and follow the course of the Cuyahoga River upstream to the dam at the falls, where they would land and cook their dinner over an open fire. They would tow the _Keewaydin_, Sahwah's birchbark canoe, behind the launch, and some time during the day would manage to let every one go for a paddle. The Winnebagos thrilled with pleasurable anticipation, all but Hinpoha, who crept sadly away, for she could not bear to hear about the fun that was being planned when she could not have a part in it.  One desire of her heart was being fulfilled, and she was getting thin. What a whole summer of rigid dieting had not been able to accomplish was brought to pass by a few weeks of mental suffering, and her clothes were beginning to hang on her. Her appetite began to fail her, and her aunt, noticing this, bought her a big bottle of tonic, which, taken before meals, killed any small desire for food she may have had. Then Aunt Phoebe decided that the two-mile walk to school was too much for her, and had her taken and called for in the machine, much to Hinpoha's disgust, for that walk was her chief joy these days. After a week of the tonic her soul rebelled against the nauseous dose, and when the first bottle was empty and Aunt Phoebe sent her to get it refilled, she \"refilled\" it herself with a mixture of licorice candy and water, which produced a black syrup similar in appearance to the original medicine, but minus the bad taste and the stigma of \"patent medicine,\" a thing which the Winnebagos had promised their Guardian they would not take. As this was deceiving her aunt she felt obliged to put a blot on her head 'scutcheon, in the form of a black record, but she was so inwardly amused at it that her appetite improved of its own accord, and Aunt Phoebe remarked in a gratified way that she had never known the equal of Mullin's Modifier as a tonic.  Migwan finished her story, copied it carefully on foolscap and sent it away to a magazine, confident that in a very short time she would behold it in print, and the payment she would receive for it would keep her in spending money throughout the school year. So with a light and merry heart she set out for Gladys's house on Saturday morning, where the girls were all to meet for the outing. It was one of those dream-like days in late autumn, when the earth, still decked in her brilliant garments, seems to lie spellbound in the sunshine, as if there were no such thing as the coming of winter.  The girls, clad in blue skirts and white middies and heavy sweaters, were whirled down to the dock in the Evans's automobile, with the _Keewaydin_ tied upright at the back. The launch was waiting for them, at one of the big boat docks, sandwiched in between two immense lake steamers. Nothing could have been a greater contrast to their trip up the Shadow River the summer before than this excursion. On that other trip they had been the only living beings on the horizon, and nature was supreme everywhere, but here they were fairly engulfed by the works of man. The tiny craft nosed her way among giant steamers, six-hundred-foot freighters, coal barges, lighters, fire boats, tugs, scows, and all the other kinds of vessels that crowd the river-harbor of a great lake port. Viewed from below, the steel structure of the viaduct over the river stretched out like the monstrous skeleton of some prehistoric beast. Whistles shrieked deafeningly in their ears and trains pounded jarringly over railroad bridges. A jack-knife bridge began to descend over their very heads. Over where the new bridge was being constructed men stood on slender girders high in the air, catching red-hot rivets that were being tossed them, while an automatic riveting hammer filled the air with its nerve-destroying clamor. Everywhere was bustle and confusion, and noise, noise, noise.  And in the midst of this tumult the tiny launch, filled with laughing girls, threaded its way up the black river, flying the Winnebago banner, while behind it trailed a birchbark canoe, with Sahwah squatting calmly in the stern, leaning her back against her paddle. Many times they had to bury their noses in their handkerchiefs to shut out the smells that assailed them on every side. "]]]
