She stood for a moment at the water cooler, looking down the car at the people facing her and indulging in her favorite pastime of trying to read their faces. The car was crowded with all kinds of people, from the stately, judicial-looking man who sat in front of the Winnebagos to a negro couple on their honeymoon. There was a plentiful sprinkling of soldiers throughout the car and one or two sailors. Sahwah looked at them with eager interest and classified their different branches of service by the color of the cord on their hats. One Artillery, three Infantry, one Ambulance Corps and one Lieutenant of Aviation, she checked off, after a long and careful scrutiny of the last one, whose insignia puzzled her at first.  A porter brushed by her as she stood there with a glass of milk in his hand. Sahwah watched the progress of the milk idly, and the porter stopped beside the Lieutenant of Aviation with it. The lieutenant seemed to be asleep, for the porter had to shake him before he became aware of his existence. Just then Hinpoha caught Sahwah's eye and motioned her to come back to her seat, and Sahwah went tripping down the aisle to join her friends. She glanced casually at the young lieutenant as she passed him; he was staring fixedly at her and she dropped her eyes quickly. A little electric shock tingled through her as she met his eyes; he seemed to be about to speak to her. \"Probably mistook me for someone else and thought he knew me,\" Sahwah thought to herself, and dismissed him from her mind.  \"Where have you been all this while?\" asked Hinpoha with a perspiring sigh, laboriously \"knitting backward\" across the length of the needle in vicious pursuit of a stitch that should have been eliminated in the process of decreasing for the heel turn.  \"Pursuing knowledge,\" replied Sahwah merrily, settling herself in the seat beside Hinpoha, facing Migwan and Gladys.  The four girls were on their way to spend the summer vacation with their beloved Guardian, Nyoda, at her home in Oakwood, the little town in the hills of eastern Pennsylvania where she had lived since her marriage to Andrew Sheridan--\"Sherry\"--the summer before. Sherry was in France now with the Engineers, and Nyoda, lonesome in the huge old house to which she had fallen heir at the death of her last relative, old Uncle Jasper Carver, had invited the Winnebagos to come and spend the summer with her.  Vacation had begun inauspiciously for the Winnebagos. To their great disappointment Katherine wrote that she was not coming east after all; she was going to remain in Chicago with Miss Fairlee and help her with her settlement work there. They had rejoiced so at the first news of her coming and had so impatiently awaited the time of her arrival that the disappointment when it came was much harder to bear than if they had never looked forward to her coming. As Sahwah remarked, she had her appetite all fixed for Katherine, and nothing else would satisfy her. The news about Katherine had only been one of a series of disappointments.  Hinpoha had been called home the week before college closed officially, to attend the funeral of Dr. Hoffman, Aunt Phoebe's husband, whose strenuous work for his \"boys\" in the military camp during the past year had been too much for his already failing strength, and Aunt Phoebe, worn out with the strain of the last months, had announced her intention of closing the house and going to spend the summer with a girlhood friend on the Maine coast. Hinpoha had the choice of going with her or spending the summer with Aunt Grace, who had a fractured knee and was confined to an invalid's chair.  Migwan had come home from college with over-strained eyes and a weak chest and had been peremptorily forbidden to spend the vacation devouring volumes of Indian history as she had planned, and had a lost, aimless feeling in consequence.  Sahwah, thanks to the unceasing patriotic activities of Mrs. Osgood Harper during the previous winter, found herself unexpectedly in possession of a two months' vacation while her energetic employer recuperated from her season's labors in a famous sanatorium. As Sahwah had not expected a vacation and had made no plans, she found herself, as she expressed it, \"all dressed up and no place to go.\"  For Gladys's father, head over heels in the manufacture of munitions, there would be no such glorious camping trip as there was the summer before, and Mrs. Evans refused to go away and leave him, so Gladys had the prospect of a summer in town, the first that she could recollect.  \"I can't decide which I shall do,\" sighed Hinpoha plaintively to the other three, who had foregathered in the library of the Bradford home one afternoon at the beginning of the summer. \"I know Aunt Phoebe would rather be alone with Miss Shirley, because her cottage is small, and it would be dreadfully dull for me besides; but Aunt Grace will be laid up all summer and she has a fright of a parrot that squawks from morning until night. Oh, dear, why can't things be as they were last year?\"  Then had come Nyoda's letter:     DEAREST WINNEBAGOS:    Can't you take pity on me and relieve my loneliness? Here I am, in a   house that would make the ordinary hotel look like a bandbox, and since   Sherry has gone to France with the Engineers it's simply ghastly. For   various reasons I do not wish to leave the house, but I shall surely go   into a decline if I have to stay here alone. Can't you come and spend   your vacations with me, as many of you as have vacations? Please come   and amuse your lonesome old Guardian, whose house is bare and dark and   cold.    Sahwah tumbled out of her chair with a shout that startled poor Mr. Bob from his slumbers at her feet and set him barking wildly with excitement; Migwan and Gladys fell on each other's necks in silent rapture, and Hinpoha began packing immediately. Just one week later they boarded the train and started on their journey to Oakwood.  Sahwah sat and looked at the soldiers in the car with unconcealed envy. Her ever-smouldering resentment against the fact that she was not a boy had since the war kindled into red rage at the unkindness of fate. She chafed under the restrictions with which her niche in the world hedged her in.  \"I wish I were a man!\" she exclaimed impatiently. \"Then I could go to war and fight for my country and--and go over the top. The boys have all the glory and excitement of war and the girls have nothing but the stupid, commonplace things to do. It isn't fair!\"  \"But women _are_ doing glorious things in the war,\" Migwan interrupted quickly. \"They're going as nurses in the hospitals right at the front; they're working in the canteens and doing lots of other things right in the thick of the excitement.\"  \"Oh, yes, _women_ are,\" replied Sahwah, \"but _girls_ aren't. Long ago, in the days before the war, I used to think if there ever _would_ be a war the Camp Fire Girls would surely do something great and glorious, but here we are, and the only thing we can do is knit, knit, knit, and fold bandages, and the babies in the kindergarten are doing _that_. We're too _young_ to do anything big and splendid. We're just schoolgirls, and no one takes us seriously. We can't go as nurses without three years' training--we can't do _anything_. There might as well not _be_ any war, for all I'm doing to help it. Boys seventeen years old can enlist, even sixteen-year-old ones, and go right to the front, but a girl sixteen years old isn't any better off than if she were sixteen months. I'm nearly nineteen, and I wanted to go as a stenographer, but they wouldn't consider me for a minute. Said I was too young.\" Sahwah threw out her hands in a tragic gesture and her brow darkened.  \"It's a shame,\" Hinpoha agreed sympathetically. \"In books young girls have no end of adventures in war time, girls no older than we; they catch spies and outwit the enemy and save their lovers' lives and carry important messages, but nothing like that will ever happen to us. All we'll ever do is just stay at home peacefully and knit.\"  Hinpoha gave an impatient jerk and the knitting fell into her lap with a protesting tinkle of needles, while the stitch which she was in the act of transferring slipped off and darted merrily away on an excursion up the length of the sock. Hinpoha threw up her hands in exasperation.  \"That's the third time that's happened in an hour!\" she exclaimed in a vexed tone. \"I hope the soldiers appreciate how much trouble it is to keep their feet covered. I'd rather fight any day than knit,\" she finished emphatically.  \"Here, let me pick up the dropped stitches for you,\" said Migwan soothingly, reaching over for the tangled mess of yarn. \"You're getting all tired and hot,\" she continued, skilfully pursuing the agile and elusive dropped stitches down the grey woolen wake of the sock and bringing them triumphantly up to resume their place in the sun.  \"It takes me an age to get a pair of socks done for the Red Cross,\" Hinpoha grumbled on, \"and they're as cross as two sticks if you drop a single stitch! That woman down at headquarters made the biggest fuss about the last pair I brought in, just because I'd slipped a stitch in the wrong place--it hardly showed a bit--and because one sock was an inch longer than the other. War isn't a bit like I thought it would be,\" she sighed plaintively, with a vengeful poke at the knitting, which Migwan had just restored to her.  Poor romantic Hinpoha, trying to sail her ship of rosy fancies on a sea of stern reality, and finding it pretty hard sailing! Leaning back against the green plush of the train seat, which set off like an artist's background the burnished glory of her red curls, and dreaming regretfully of the vanished days when chivalry rode on fiery steeds and ladies fair led much more eventful lives than their emancipated great-granddaughters, it never occurred to her--nor to the rest of the Winnebagos either, for that matter--that romance might have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11664"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls Do Their Bit; Or, Over the Top with the Winnebagos (#2)"],["body","up to date along with science and the fashions, and that in these modern days of speed and efficiency High Adventure might purchase a ticket at the station window and go faring forth in a Pullman car. So Hinpoha dreamed dreams of the way she would like things to happen and built airy castles around the Winnebagos as heroines; but little did she suspect that another architect was also at work on those same castles, an architect whose lines are drawn with an indelible pencil, and whose finished work no man may reject.  Hinpoha did not resume her knitting again. She opened her hand bag and drew forth her mirror, and propping it up against her knee, proceeded to arrange the curls that had escaped from their imprisoning pins and were riding around her ears. Then she put the mirror back and drew out a bottle of hand lotion and examined the stopper. She slipped it in and out several times and then idly dropped a few violet petals from the bunch at her belt into the bottle, shaking it about to make them whirl, and then holding it still to watch them settle.  \"It looks as though you were telling fortunes,\" remarked Sahwah, watching the petals alternately whirl and sink, \"like tea leaves, you know.\"  Hinpoha brightened at once and animation came back into her face. Better than anything else under the sun, Hinpoha loved to tell fortunes.  \"Do you want me to tell yours, Sahwah?\" she asked eagerly.  Sahwah agreed amiably; she did not care two straws about fortune-telling herself, but she knew Hinpoha's hobby and willingly submitted to countless \"readings\" of her future, in various ways, by the ardent amateur seeress.  Hinpoha shook the bottle energetically, and then watched intently as the petals gradually ceased whirling and came to rest at the bottom of the bottle.  \"There is a stranger coming into your life,\" she began impressively, \"awfully thin, and light.\"  \"Like the syrup we had on our pancakes in the station this morning,\" murmured Migwan.  Sahwah and Gladys giggled; Hinpoha frowned. \"All right, if you're going to laugh at me,\" she began.  \"Go on, we'll be good,\" said Migwan hastily.  \"Tell us some more about the light-haired stranger. Please tell us when he is coming into her life, so we can be there to see.\"  \"He has already come,\" announced Hinpoha, after thoughtfully squinting into the bottle.  \"News to me,\" laughed Sahwah, amused at the seriousness with which Hinpoha delivered her revelations. \"Oh, I know who it is,\" she continued, giggling. \"It's the brakeman. He was a Swede, with the yellowest hair you ever saw. He was awfully skinny, too. He was very polite, and told me everything he knew, and then went away to find out some more.\"  Migwan and Gladys shouted; Hinpoha pouted and snatched up the bottle, shaking it with offended vigor, setting the petals whirling madly and breaking up the \"cast\" of Sahwah's fortune.  \"There was another man, too,\" she announced, with a don't-you-wish-you'd-waited air, \"but I won't tell you about him now. He was awfully queer, too; he was there twice, and once he was dark and once he was light!\"  \"How do you know it was the same one?\" inquired Gladys curiously.  \"Because it _was_,\" replied Hinpoha knowingly.  \"Maybe he faded,\" suggested Sahwah, giggling again.  \"No, he didn't,\" replied Hinpoha mysteriously, \"because he was light _first_ and dark _afterward_!\"  Hinpoha's voice rang out like an oracle, and the judicial-looking man in the seat ahead of them turned around and surveyed the four with a smile of amusement on his face.  \"That man's laughing at us,\" said Sahwah, feeling terribly foolish. \"Quit telling fortunes, Hinpoha. It's all nonsense, anyhow.\"  \"Maybe _you_ think it's nonsense,\" returned Hinpoha in an offended tone, \"but they do come true, lots of times. Do you remember, Gladys, the time I told you you were going to get a letter from a distance, and you got one from France the very next day?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Gladys, \"and do you remember the time you predicted I was going to flunk math at midyears and I took the prize?\"  \"And do you remember the light man that came into _your_ life, Hinpoha?\" said Sahwah slily.  Hinpoha turned fiery red at this reference to Professor Knoblock and looked out of the window in confused silence. Sahwah realized that she was figure-skating on thin ice when she mentioned that subject and forebore to make any further remarks. A strained silence fell upon the four. Migwan cast about in her mind for a topic of conversation that would relieve the tension.  \"Has anyone heard from Veronica lately?\" she asked.  \"I haven't heard from her for several months,\" replied Sahwah, \"but I suppose she's still in New York. She must be doing great things with her music. She's given a concert already.\"  \"It's queer about Veronica,\" continued Sahwah musingly. \"Although she wasn't with us so much I seem to miss her more and more as time goes on. I often dream I hear her playing her violin.\" Sahwah's admiration for Veronica had never waned, although Veronica had never had what Sahwah described as a \"real emotional case\" on her.  \"Veronica's an alien enemy now,\" said Gladys in an awed tone.  \"Do you think she'll be _interred_?\" asked Hinpoha anxiously.  Sahwah gave a little scream of laughter. \"_In-terned,_ not _interred_,\" she corrected. \"I hope Veronica isn't ready to be buried yet.\"  \"Well, _interned_, then,\" answered Hinpoha, a little piqued at Sahwah's raillery. \"You don't need to call the attention of the whole car to the fact that I made a little mistake. Did you see that officer over there turn around and look when you laughed? He's looking yet, and he probably heard what you said, and is laughing at me in his mind.\"  Sahwah involuntarily turned around and her eyes met those of the slim, fair-haired youth in the uniform of a lieutenant of aviation, sitting several seats beyond them on the other side of the car. For some unaccountable reason she again felt suddenly shy and dropped her eyes, while a little feeling of wonder stole over her at her own embarrassment. Up until that moment, unexplained feelings had been totally unknown in Sahwah's wholesome and vigorous young life. There had been nothing bold or offensive about the stranger's glance, yet there was a certain curious intentness about it that filled Sahwah with a strange confusion, a vague stirring within her of something unfamiliar, something unknown. Outwardly there was nothing remarkable about him, nothing to distinguish him from the thousands of other lads in khaki that were to be seen everywhere one went, erect, trim, lovably conceited. Why, then, should the heart of Sahwah the Sunfish suddenly flutter at this casual meeting of the eyes with the man across the way, and why did she turn sharply around and look out of the window?  Then a curious thing happened. The sunlight, which was so bright it was making the others squint and draw the curtains, suddenly seemed to Sahwah to be darkened, while a nameless fear stole into her heart and oppressed her with a sense of lurking danger, of hovering calamity. Only for a minute it lasted, and then she was herself again and the sunshine struck into her eyes with intolerable splendor.  She shook herself slightly and turned her attention to Hinpoha, who was speaking.  \"Wouldn't it be dreadful if Veronica were to be interned?\" Hinpoha was saying.  \"Veronica won't be interned,\" said Sahwah with an air of authority. \"It's only the Germans who are being watched so carefully, and have to register with the police, and all that. Veronica isn't a German citizen, she's a Hungarian. She will be perfectly safe. Her uncle is an American citizen and is very patriotic; he was on the last Liberty Loan committee.\"  \"I wonder how she feels about things?\" said Gladys musingly. \"Her father was in the Austrian army, you remember, and died fighting, and her mother died when their town was taken by the Russians, and Veronica just barely escaped with her own life. Their home was burned and they lost everything they had. Veronica would be very wealthy if it hadn't been for the war. It would be only natural for her to feel bitter toward the side that had brought suffering to her family.\"  \"But that was in the early days of the war, before so many things had happened,\" said Sahwah, \"and before Veronica had ever seen America. She's crazy about America. She certainly wouldn't feel bitter toward the Americans because the Russians burned their town and killed her father, would she?\"  \"Poor Veronica,\" said Gladys softly. \"She's in a hard position and I don't envy her. I love her dearly, even if her country _is_ our enemy.\"  \"Shucks!\" exclaimed Sahwah. \"Veronica isn't to blame because her country is at war. _She_ isn't our enemy. Anyway,\" she added, \"I don't believe that the Hungarians are as bad as the Germans. They aren't spies like the Germans are. Why, lots of Hungarians are fighting right in our own army! Probably if Veronica's father had come to America years ago he would be doing the same thing now. Anyway, Veronica's here now, and she's glad she _is_ here, and I don't think it's right to treat her coldly just because she's an 'alien enemy.'\"  \"Maybe she's still loyal to her own country, though,\" said Hinpoha, \"and if the chance ever came to help Hungary's cause she'd feel in duty, bound to do it. She has such intense feelings about things, you know. She'd be quite willing to die for any cause she believed in.\"  \"Shucks!\" said Sahwah again. \"Your romantic notions make me tired sometimes, Hinpoha. Veronica's not going to die for Hungary's cause, and she isn't likely to die for any other cause either, any more than we are.\"  \"But we'd be _willing_ to die for America's cause, wouldn't we?\" demanded Hinpoha, with rising excitement.  \"We certainly would!\" replied Sahwah, with a fine flash from her brown eyes.  \"Well, if we'd be perfectly willing to die for _our_ country's cause, why wouldn't Veronica be willing to die for _hers_?\" demanded Hinpoha triumphantly.  \"What I meant mostly,"]]]
