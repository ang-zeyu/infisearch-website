Owls the size of a robin, only vastly fluffier, screamed from the rocks as we passed them.  Otherwise, it was like a soul's last journey, eerie, lonely and awful, down toward River Styx.  Long before we caught sight of the water again, through a ragged gap between high limestone rocks, I could smell a village.  The guide approached it cautiously, stopping every minute or so to listen.  When we came on it at last it was down below us in abysmal darkness, one light shining through a window two feet square in proof we were not hesitating on the verge of the infinite pit.  The donkeys knew the way.  They trod daintily, like little ladies, along a circling track that goats made and men had certainly done nothing to improve.  We made an almost complete ellipse around and down, and rode at last over dry dung at the bottom, into which the donkeys' feet sank as into a three-pile carpet.  You could see the stars overhead, but nothing, where we were, except that window and a shaft of yellow light with hundreds of moths dazzled in it.  We must have made some noise in spite of the donkeys' vetvet foot-fall.  As we crossed the shaft of light a door opened within six feet of the window.  A man in Arab deshabille with a red tarboosh awry, thrust out his head and drew it in again quickly.  \"Is that the American?\" he asked.  He held the door so that he could slam it in our faces if required.  The guide made no answer.  I gave my name.  The man opened the door wider.  \"Lailtak sa'idi, effendi!  Hishkur Allah!  Come in, mister!\"  The guide led the donkeys away to some invisible place.  I crossed the threshold, my host holding his tin lantern carefully to show the two steps leading down to a flag-stone floor.  He bolted the door the moment I was inside.  He seemed in a great state of excitement, and afraid to make any noise.  Even when he shot the bolt he did it silently.  It was a square room, moderately clean, furnished only with a table and two chairs.  There were other rooms leading off it, but the stone partitions did not reach as high as the thatch and I could hear rustling, and some one snoring.  I sat on one of the chairs at his invitation, and rather hoped for supper, having had none.  But supper was not in his mind;  it seemed he had too much else to worry him.  He looked like a man who worried easily, and likely enough with good reason, for his long nose and narrow eyes did not suggest honesty.  \"There was to be an escort to meet me here,\" I said.  \"Yes, yes.  Thank God, mister, you have come at last.  If you had only come at sunset!  Ali has gone to bring them now.\"  \"Who is Ali?\"  \"He with one eye.  He who brought you.  Your escort came at sunset.  Because I am Christian they would not listen to me or wait for you in my house.  There are twenty of them, led by Anazeh, who is a bad rascal.  They have gone to raid the villages.  There has been trouble.  I have heard two shots fired. Now they will come back to my house, and if the Sikh patrol is after them they will be caught here, and I shall be accused of helping them.  May the fires of their lying Prophet's Eblis burn Anazeh and his men forever and ever, Amen!  May God curse their religion!\"  That was a nice state of affairs.  I did not want to be caught there by a lot of truculent Sikhs under one of those jocularly incredulous young British subalterns that Sikhs adore.  In the first place, I had nothing whatever in writing to prove my innocence.  The least that was likely to happen would be an ignominious return to Jerusalem, after a night in a guard-house, should there be a guard-house;  failing that, a night in the open within easy reach of Sikh's bayonets.  In Jerusalem, no doubt, Sir Louis would order me released immediately.  But it began to look as if the whole mystery after all was nothing but a well- staged decoy, using me for bait.  Not even tadpoles enjoy being used for live-bait without being consulted first.  I began to spear about for remedies.  \"If you're an honest man,\" I said, \"you'd better simply deny all connection with the raid.\"  \"Hah?\"  He shrugged his shoulders.  He did not look like an honest man. He wasn't one.  He knew it.  He retorted gloomily:  \"Anazeh's scoundrels will have raided sheep, and perhaps cattle. If any one has resisted them, there will be wailing widows crying out for vengeance.  They will put the sheep and cattle in their boats in which they came over the sea this afternoon.  The boats will be found by the Sikhs, hauled up on the sand-pit just below my house, with my motor-boat beside them.  I am ruined!\"  Well, my own predicament was better than that.  Nobody was likely to accuse me of having stolen sheep.  But I could not feel sorry for my host, because he was so sorry for himself.  He was one of those unfortunates who carry the conviction of their own guilt in their faces.  I gave up all idea of relying on him in case the Sikhs should come.  My next idea was to ask for the loan of one of the donkeys, and to start back toward Jerusalem.  But I had not more than thought of it when men's footsteps pattered on the yard dung, and an indubitable rifle-butt beat on the wooden door.  \"For God's sake!\" hissed the owner of the place.  He ran to the door to open it as the thumping grew louder.  As he drew the bolt somebody kicked the door open, sending him reeling backwards. For a second I thought the Sikhs had come.  But he was nothing like a Sikh who strode in, with a dozen ruffians at his tail and one-eyed Ali bringing up the rear.  He was one of the finest-looking Arabs I had ever seen, although considerably past fifty and wrinkled so that his face was a net- work of fine lines, out of which his big, dark eyes shone with unaged intelligence.  He was magnificently dressed, perhaps in order to do me honour.  Except for the fact that he carried a modern military rifle on his elbow, in place of a shepherd's crook or a spear, he looked like one of those historic worthies who stalk through the pages of the Pentateuch.  The dignity and charm with which he bowed to me were inimitable--unconveyable. But he turned on my Christian host like a prophet of old rebuking blasphemy.  Arabic when the right man uses it sounds like tooth-for-a-tooth law being laid down.  Hebrew is all music and soft vowels; Arabic all guttural consonants.  The Sheikh Anazeh (there was no doubt of his identity;  they all kept calling him by name) fulminated.  The other bleated at him.  I learned his name at last.  Ali of the one eye pressed forward, took him by the sleeve, and called him Ahmed.  Ali seemed to be adding persuasion to Anazeh's threats.  Whatever it was they were driving at, Ahmed began to look like yielding.  So, as I could not untangle more than one brief sentence at a time from all those galloping arguments, I pulled Ahmed away into a corner.  \"What do they all want?\" I asked him.  \"Tell me in ten words.\" But he was not a brief man.  \"They say the Sikhs are after them.  They have put the stolen sheep into their boats, as I told you they would, mister.  Now they order me to tow them with my motor-boat.  But it cannot be done, mister, it cannot be done!  I tell them there is government launch near Jericho that the Sikh patrol can use to overtake us. I have a swift boat, but if I take in tow two other loaded boats we shall be caught;  and then who will save everything I have from confiscation?\"  \"How close are the Sikhs?\" I asked.  \"God knows, mister!  They can come fast.  Unless I consent to let them use my boat, Anazeh will order his men to kill me, and then they will take the boat in any case!  There is only one thing: they must leave the sheep behind and all crowd into my boat, but I cannot persuade them!\"  At that moment another of Anazeh's party burst in through the door.  He evidently bore bad news.  Catching sight of me, he lowered his voice to a whisper, and, whatever he said, Anazeh nodded gravely.  Then the old sheikh gave an order, and four of his men came without further ado to seize Ahmed.  \"Bear me witness!\" the wretched man called back to me as they dragged him off.  \"I go under protest--most unwillingly!\"  Somebody struck him with a butt-end.  A woman's head appeared over the top of the partition, and began to jabber noisily. Several of Anazeh's men hurled jests:  the highest compliment they paid her was to call her Um-Kulsum, the mother of sin. Anazeh beckoned to me.  He did not seem to doubt for an instant that I would follow him.  I was in no mind to wait there and be arrested by the Sikh patrol.  I wondered whether they were coming in open order, combing the countryside, or heading all together straight for a known objective;  and whether in either case I could give them the slip and head back toward Jerusalem.  In that minute I recalled Grim's advice:  \"Do whatever the leader of the escort tells you and you'll be all right.  You needn't be afraid to trust him.\"  That settled it.  I did not suppose for a minute that Grim had contemplated any such contingency as this;  but he had volunteered the advice, so the consequences would be his affair. I followed Anazeh into outer darkness, and one of his men pulled the door to after me.  There was something very like a panic down by the waterside, three hundred yards away from the house.  It needed all Anazeh's authority to straighten matters out.  There were divided counsels;  and the raiders were working at a disadvantage in total darkness;  the shadow of the hills fell just beyond the stern of the boats as they lay with their bows ashore.  They had already forced Ahmed into his own motor-boat, where he was struggling vainly to crank a cold engine.  Some of the others were trying to push off a boat full of bleating sheep.  One man was carrying a fat sheep in his arms toward the motor-boat, splashing knee-deep in the water and shouting advice to everybody else, and in the end that was the only"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11357"],["title","Jimgrim and Allah's Peace (#7)"],["body"," of plunder they got away with.  Suddenly one man, who had been left behind to keep a look-out, came leaping like a ghost among the shadows, shouting the one word \"askeri!\" (Soldiers!)  He jumped straight into the motor-boat.  Anazeh bullied all the rest in after him.  I climbed in over the bow.  By that time you could not have crowded in one more passenger with the aid of a battering ram.  \"Yalla!\" barked Anazeh.  But the engine would not start.  Blood- curdling threats were hurled at the unhappy Ahmed.  Some e of the men got into the water and began to shove off, as if the engine could be encouraged by collaboration.  I was just as keen to escape as any one.  I could not imagine a Sikh or subaltern stupid enough to believe me innocent.  It was a military government.  Soldiers have a drum-head method of leaving nothing to discuss except where the corpse is to be buried.  I forced my way aft--got some gasoline out of the tank into a tin cup--thrust aside Ahmed and two other men--and primed the engine liberally.  The engine coughed next time they moved the wheel, and in thirty seconds more we had it going.  Ahmed came in for a volley of mockery for having to be shown the way to start his engine;  but from the sour way he looked at me I was nearly sure he had stalled deliberately.  We backed away from shore, and Anazeh steered the boat's nose eastward.  Then somebody at the reversing lever threw it forward too suddenly, and the still chilled engine stopped.  It took about another minute to restart it.  We were just beginning to gain speed when some one shouted.  All eyes turned toward the shore, the overloaded boat rocking dangerously as the crowd bent their bodies all in one direction together.  Down near the shore-line an electric torch flashed on the uniforms of half-a-dozen Sikhs, and we could hear an unmistakably British voice shouting an order.  We were out in the moonlight now, a perfect target.  Bullets chanced at us could hardly fail to hit somebody.  Two or three well-placed shots might sink us.  But Anazeh had presence of mind.  He changed helm, so as to present us end-on to the shore. Low in the water though the boat was, we were beginning to make good headway.  The Sikhs lost no time.  Shots began to whizz overhead and to splash the water around us.  But the boat was painted gray;  as we increased the distance we must have looked like a moving patch of darker water with a puzzling wake behind us.  The sea was still.  The stars were reflected in it in unsteady dots and streaks.  The moon cast a silver patch of light that shimmered, and confused the eye.  Sikhs are not by any means all marksmen. At any rate, the shots all missed.  Though some of our party, Anazeh included, returned the fire, none boasted of having hit any one.  And an Arab boasts at the least excuse.  In a few minutes we were out of range and, since there was no pursuing launch in sight, could afford to jeer at the Sikhs in chorus.  There were things said about their habits and their ancestry that it is to be hoped they did not hear, or at any rate understand, for the sake of any Arab prisoners they might take in future.  It always struck me as a fool game to mock your enemy. If you fall in his power at any time he would be almost more than human if he did not remember it.  It seemed to me unlikely that those Sikhs would forget to avenge the Arab compliments that must have sizzled in ears across that star-lit sea.  After that the only immediate danger was from the wind that sometimes blows down in sudden gusts from between the mountain-tops.  It would have needed only half a sea to swamp us.  But the Dead Sea was living up to its reputation, quiet, inert, like a mercury mirror for the stars--a brooding place of silence.  The Arabs' spirits rose as we chugged toward their savage hills. They began to sing glorious songs about women and mares and camels.  Presently Anazeh improvised an epic about the night's raid, abortive though it had been.  He left out all the disappointing part.  He sang first of the three shore-dwelling fools whose boats they had stolen.  Then of the baffled rage of those same fools when they should learn their property was lost forever.  Presently, as he warmed to the spirit of the thing, he sang about the wails of the frightened villagers from whom they had plundered sheep and goats;  and of the skill and resourcefulness with which the party had escaped pursuit under his leadership, Allah favoring, \"and blessed be His Prophet!\"  Last, he sang about me, the honoured stranger, for whom they had dared everything and conquered, and whom they were taking to El- Kerak.  He described me as a prince from a far country, the son of a hundred kings.  It was a good song.  I got Ahmed to translate it to me afterwards.  But I suspect that Ahmed toned it down in deference to what he may have thought might be my modesty and moralistic scruples.      Chapter Four  \"I am willing to use all means--all methods.\"   Ahmed knew the Dead Sea.  He knew its moods and a few of its tricks, so he was suitably scared.  He was more of raid of the treacherous sea than of his captors.  They weren't treacherous in the least.  They were frankly disobedient of any law except their own;  respectful of nothing but bullets, brains and their own interpretation of the Will of Allah.  They showed sublime indifference to danger that always comes of ignorance.  Ahmed was for running straight across to cut the voyage short, because of the wind that sometimes blows from the south at dawn.  He said it might kick up a sea that would roll us over, for the weight of the Dead Sea waves in a blow is prodigious.  They overruled his protest with loud-lunged unanimity and lots of abuse.  Anazeh continued to steer a diagonal course for a notch in the Moab Hills that look, until you get quite close to them, as if they rose sheer out of the sea.  The old chief was pretty amateurish at the helm, whatever his other attainments.  Our wake was like a drunkard's.  What with the danger in that overcrowded boat, and the manifestly compromising fact that I had now become one of a gang who boasted of the murder they had done that night, I did some speculation that seems ridiculous now, at this distance, after a lapse of time.  It occurred to me that Grim might be disguised as a member of Anazeh's party.  As far as possible in the dark I thoroughly scrutinized each individual.  It is easy to laugh about it now, but I actually made my way to Anazeh's side and tried to discover whether the old Sheikh's wrinkles and gray-shot beard were not a very skillfully done make-up.  At any rate, I got from that absurd investigation the sure knowledge that Grim was not in the boat with us.  I could not talk with Anazeh very well, because when he tried to understand my amateurish Arabic and to modify his flow of stately speech to meet my needs, he always put his head down, and the helm with it.  It seemed wisest to let him do one unaccustomed thing at a time.  I did not care to try to talk with any of his men, because that might possibly have been a breach of etiquette. Arab jealousy is about as quick as fulminate of mercury:  as unreasonable, from a western viewpoint, as a love-sick woman's.  But there did not seem any objection to talking with Ahmed.  He was at least in theory my co-religionist, and not a person any Moslem in that boat was likely to be jealous of.  He jumped at the notion of making friends with me.  He made no secret of the reason.  \"You are safe, effendi.  They will neither rob you, nor kill you, nor let you get killed.  You are their guest.  But as for me, they would cut my throat as readily as that sheep's, more especially since they have discovered that you know how to start the engine.  My best chance was to make them believe that the engine is difficult to understand.  Because of your knowledge they now feel independent of me.  So I must yield to them in everything.  And if they force me to swear on a Bible, and on my father's honour, and in the name of God, that I will not give evidence against them, I shall have to swear.\"  \"An oath given under compulsion--\" I began.  But he laughed cynically.  \"Ah!  You do not know this land--these folk, effendi.  If I were to break such an oath as that, they would burn my house, steal my cattle, ravish my wife, and hunt me to the death.  If I ran away to America, Arabs in Chicago and New York would continue the hunt.  This is a land where an oath is binding, unless you are the stronger.  I am weak--an unimportant person.\"  \"What is your business?\" I asked.  \"There is no business for a man like me.  The regulations forbid commerce in the only goods for which there is a real demand among Bedouins.\"  \"So you're a smuggler, eh?\"  He laughed, between pride and caution, and changed the subject.  \"I shall do what they order me, effendi.  I think they will keep my boat over there to bring you back again.  But when I get back the Sikhs will arrest me.  So I ask you to bear me witness that I was compelled by threats and force to go with these people.  In that way, with a little ingenuity--that is to say, the ingenious use of piastras--perhaps I can contrive to get out of the difficulty without being punished by both Arabs and British.\"  I promised to tell no more than I had seen and heard.  On the strength of that we became as fast friends as suspicion permitted.  We trusted each other, because we more or less had to, like a couple of thieves \"on the lam.\"  It suited me.  He was a very good interpreter and slavishly anxious to please.  But I lived to regret it later.  When my evidence had cleared him of collusion in the raid, he chose on the strength of that to claim me as his friend for life.  He turned up in the United States and tried to live on his wits.  I had to pay a lawyer to defend him in Federal Court.  He writes me piously pathetic letters from Leavenworth Penitentiary.  And when he gets out I suppose I shall have to befriend him"]]]
