There can't ever be any.\"  \"But may I not at least say--?\"  \"I'd so much rather you would not,\" she begged.  \"At present, you mean?\"  \"Or in the future,\" said Anna, and, having done perfectly thus far, spoiled all by declaring she would \"never marry!\" Her gaze rested far across the field on the quietly clad figure of Kincaid riding to and fro and pointing hither and yon to his gold-laced cousin. Off here on the left she heard Mandeville announcing:  \"Now they'll form batt'rie to the front by throwing caisson' to the rear--look--look!... Ah, ha! was not that a prettie?\"  Pretty it was declared to be on all sides. Flora called it \"a beautiful.\" Part of her charm was a Creole accent much too dainty for print. Anna and Greenleaf and the other couples regathered about the carriage, and Miss Valcour from her high seat smiled her enthusiasm down among them, exalting theirs. And now as a new movement of the battery followed, and now another, her glow heightened, and she called musically to Constance, Mrs. Callender and Anna, by turns, to behold and admire. For one telling moment she was, and felt herself, the focus of her group, the centre of its living picture. Out afield yet another manoeuvre was on, and while Anna and her suitor stood close below her helplessly becalmed each by each, Flora rose to her feet and caught a great breath of delight. Her gaze was on the glittering mass of men, horses, and brazen guns that came thundering across the plain in double column--Irby at its head, Kincaid alone on the flank--and sweeping right and left deployed into battery to the front with cannoneers springing to their posts for action.  \"Pretties' of all!\" she cried, and stood, a gentle air stirring her light draperies, until the boys at the empty guns were red-browed and short of breath in their fierce pretence of loading and firing. Suddenly the guns were limbered up and went bounding over the field, caissons in front. And now pieces passed their caissons, and now they were in line, then in double column, and presently were gleaming in battery again, faced to the rear. And now at command the tired lads dropped to the ground to rest, or sauntered from one lounging squad to another, to chat and chaff and puff cigarettes. Kincaid and Irby lent their horses to Mandeville and Charlie, who rode to the battery while the lenders joined the ladies.  Once more Hilary yielded Flora and sought Anna; but with kinder thought for Flora Anna pressed herself upon Irby, to the open chagrin of his uncle. So Kincaid cheerfully paired with Flora. But thus both he and Anna unwittingly put the finishing touch upon that change of heart in the General which Flora, by every subtlety of indirection, this hour and more in the carriage, had been bringing about.  A query: With Kincaid and Irby the chief figures in their social arena and Hilary so palpably his cousin's better in looks, in bearing, talents, and character, is it not strange that Flora, having conquest for her ruling passion, should strive so to relate Anna to Hilary as to give her, Anna, every advantage for the higher prize? Maybe it is, but she liked strangeness--and a stiff game.     V   HILARY?--YES, UNCLE?  Second half as well as first, the drill was ended. The low acacias and great live-oaks were casting their longest shadows. The great plain rested from the trample and whirl of hoofs, guns, and simulated battle. A whiff of dust showed where the battery ambled townward among roadside gardens, the Callender carriage spinning by it to hurry its three ladies and Mandeville far away to the city's lower end. At the column's head rode Irby in good spirits, having got large solace of Flora's society since we last saw her paired with Kincaid. Now beside the tiny railway station Hilary was with her once more as she and Charlie awaited the train from town. Out afield were left only General Brodnax and Greenleaf, dismounted between the Northerner's horse and Hilary's. Now Kincaid came across the turf.  \"Greenleaf,\" said the old soldier, \"why does Hilary forever walk as though he were bringing the best joke of the season? Can't you make him quit it?\"  The nephew joined them: \"Uncle, if you'd like to borrow my horse I can go by train.\"  That _was_ a joke. \"H-m-m! I see! No, Greenleaf's going by train. Would you like to ride with me?\"  \"Well, eh--ha! Why, uncle, I--why, of course, if Fred really--\" They mounted and went.  \"Hilary?\"  \"Yes, uncle?\"  \"How is it now? Like my girl any better?\"  \"Why--yes! Oh, she's fine! And yet I--\"  \"You must say? What must you say?\"  \"Nothing much; only that she's not the kind to seem like the owner of a field battery. My goodness! uncle, if she had half Miss Flora's tang--\"  \"She hasn't the least need of it! She's the quiet kind, sir, that fools who love 'tang' overlook!\"  \"Yes,\" laughed Hilary, \"she's quiet; quiet as a fortification by moonlight! Poor Fred! I wish--\"  \"Well, thank God you wish in vain! That's just been settled. I asked him--oh, don't look surprised at _me_. Good Lord! hadn't I the right to know?\"  The two rode some way in silence. \"I wish,\" mused the nephew aloud, \"it could be as he wants it.\"  The uncle's smile was satirical: \"Did you ever, my boy, wish anything could be as _I_ want it?\"  \"Now, uncle, there's a big difference--\"  \"DAMN THE DIFFERENCE! I'm going to try you. I'm going to make Adolphe my adjutant-general. Then if you hanker for this battery as it hankers for you--\"  \"Mary, Queen of Scots!\" rejoiced Hilary. \"That'll suit us both to the bone! And if it suits you too--\"  \"Well it doesn't! You know I've never wanted Adolphe about me. But you've got me all snarled up, the whole kit of you. What's more, I don't want him for my heir nor any girl with 'tang' for mistress of my lands and people. Hilary, I swear! if you've got the sand to want Anna and she's got the grace to take you, then, adjutant-general or not, I'll leave you my whole fortune! Well, what amuses you now?\"  \"Why, uncle, all the cotton in New Orleans couldn't tempt me to marry the girl I wouldn't take dry so without a continental cent.\"  \"But your own present poverty might hold you back even from the girl you wanted, mightn't it?\"  \"No!\" laughed the nephew, \"nothing would!\"  \"Good God! Well, if you'll want Anna I'll make it easy for you to ask for her. If not, I'll make it as hard as I can for you to get any one else.\"  Still Hilary laughed: \"H-oh, uncle, if I loved any girl, I'd rather have her without your estate than with it.\" Suddenly he sobered and glowed: \"I wish you'd leave it to Adolphe! He's a heap-sight better business man than I. Besides, being older, he feels he has the better right to it. You know you always counted on leaving it to him.\"  The General looked black: \"You actually decline the gift?\"  \"No. No, I don't. I want to please you. But of my own free choice I wouldn't have it. I'm no abolitionist, but I don't want that kind of property. I don't want the life that has to go with it. I know other sorts that are so much better. I'm not thinking only of the moral responsibility--\"  \"By--! sir, I am!\"  \"I know you are, and I honor you for it.\"  \"Bah!... Hilary, I--I'm much obliged to you for your company, but--\"  \"You've had enough,\" laughed the good-natured young man. \"Good-evening, sir.\" He took a cross-street.  \"Good-evening, my boy.\" The tone was so kind that Hilary cast a look back. But the General's eyes were straight before him.  Greenleaf accompanied the Valcours to their door. Charlie, who disliked him, and whose admiration for his own sister was privately cynical, had left them to themselves in the train. There, wholly undetected by the very man who had said some women were too feminine and she was one, she had played her sex against his with an energy veiled only by its intellectual nimbleness and its utterly dispassionate design. Charlie detected achievement in her voice as she twittered good-by to the departing soldier from their street door.     VI   MESSRS. SMELLEMOUT AND KETCHEM  Night came, all stars. The old St. Charles Theatre filled to overflowing with the city's best, the hours melted away while Maggie Mitchell played _Fanchon_, and now, in the bright gas-light of the narrow thoroughfare, here were Adolphe and Hilary helping their three ladies into a carriage. All about them the feasted audience was pouring forth into the mild February night.  The smallest of the three women was aged. That the other two were young and beautiful we know already. At eighteen the old lady, the Bohemian-glass one, had been one of those royalist refugees of the French Revolution whose butterfly endeavors to colonize in Alabama and become bees make so pathetic a chapter in history. When one knew that, he could hardly resent her being heavily enamelled. Irby pressed into the coach after the three and shut the door, Kincaid uncovered, and the carriage sped off.  Hilary turned, glanced easily over the heads of the throng, and espied Greenleaf beckoning with a slender cane. Together they crossed the way and entered the office of a public stable.  \"Our nags again,\" said Kincaid to one of a seated group, and passed into a room beyond. Thence he re-issued with his dress modified for the saddle, and the two friends awaited their mounts under an arch. \"Dost perceive, Frederic,\" said the facetious Hilary, \"yon modestly arrayed pair of palpable gents hieing hitherward yet pretending not to descry us? They be detectives. Oh--eh--gentlemen!\"  The strangers halted inquiringly and then came forward. The hair of one was black, of the other gray. Hilary brightened upon them: \"I was just telling my friend who you are. You know me, don't you?\" A challenging glint came into his eye.  But the gray man showed a twinkle to match it: \"Why--by sight--yes--what there is of you.\"  Hilary smiled again: \"I saw you this morning in the office of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11719"],["title","Kincaid's Battery (#4)"],["body","Committee of Public Safety, where I was giving my word that this friend of mine should leave the city within twenty-four hours.\" He introduced him: \"Lieutenant Greenleaf, gentleman, United States Army. Fred, these are Messrs. Smellemout and Ketchem, a leading firm in the bottling business.\"  Greenleaf and the firm expressed their pleasure. \"We hang out at the corner of Poet and Good-Children Streets,\" said the black-haired man, but made his eyes big to imply that this was romance.  Greenleaf lifted his brows: \"Streets named for yourselves, I judge.\"  \"Aye. Poet for each, Good-Children for both.\"  Kincaid laughed out. \"The Lieutenant and I,\" he said as he moved toward their approaching horses, \"live on Love street exactly half-way between Piety and Desire.\" His eyes widened, too. Suddenly he stepped between Greenleaf and the others: \"See here, let's begin to tell the truth! You know Kincaid's Foundry? It was my father's--\"  \"And his father's before him,\" said the gray man.  \"And I've come home to go into this war,\" Hilary went on.  \"And just at present,\" said Gray, \"you're casting shot and shell and now and then a cannon; good for you! You want to give us your guarantee--?\"  \"That my friend and I will be together every moment till he leaves to-morrow morning on the Jackson Railroad, bound for the North without a stop.\"  \"To go into this war on the other side!\"  \"Why, of course!\" said the smiling Kincaid. \"Now, that's all, isn't it? I fear we're keeping you.\"  \"Oh, no.\" The gray man's crow's-feet deepened playfully. \"If you think you need us we'll stick by you all night.\"  \"No,\" laughed Kincaid, \"there's no call for you to be so sticky as all that.\" The horsemen mounted.  \"Better us than the Patriots' League,\" said the younger detective to Hilary as Greenleaf moved off. \"They've got your friend down in their Send-'em-to-hell book and are after him now. That's how come we to be--\"  \"I perceive,\" replied Hilary, and smiled in meditation. \"Why--thank you, both!\"  \"Oh, you go right along, Mr. Kincaid. We'll be at the depot to-morrow ourselves, and to-night we'll see that they don't touch neither one of you.\"  Hilary's smile grew: \"Why--thank you again! That will make it more comfortable for them. Good-night.\"  The two friends rode to a corner, turned into Poydras Street, crossed Magazine and Tchoupitoulas and presently, out from among the echoing fronts of unlighted warehouses, issued upon the wide, white Levee.     VII   BY STARLIGHT  \"Wait,\" murmured Greenleaf, as they halted to view the scene. From their far right came the vast, brimming river, turbid, swift, silent, its billows every now and then rising and looking back as if they fled from implacable pursuers; sweeping by long, slumbering ranks of ships and steamboats; swinging in majestic breadth around the bend a mile or more below; and at the city's end, still beyond, gliding into mystic oblivion. Overhead swarmed the stars and across the flood came faintly the breath of orange-groves, sea-marshes and prairies.  Greenleaf faced across the wide bend at his left. In that quarter, quite hidden in live-oaks and magnolias, as both well knew, were the low, red towers of Jackson Barracks. But it was not for them the evicted young soldier claimed this last gaze. It was for a large dwelling hard by them, a fine old plantation house with wide verandas, though it also was shut from view, in its ancient grove.  \"Fred,\" said Hilary, \"didn't she tell you why?\"  \"No,\" replied the lover when they had turned away and were moving up the harbor front, \"except that it isn't because I'm for the Union.\"  Hilary's eyes went wide: \"That's wonderful, old man! But I don't believe she likes a soldier of any sort. If I were a woman I'd be doggoned if I'd ever marry a soldier!\"  \"Yet the man who gets her,\" said Greenleaf, \"ought to be a soldier in every drop of his blood. You don't know her yet; but you soon will, and I'm glad.\"  \"Now, why so? I can't ever please her enough to be pleased with her. I'm too confounded frivolous! I love nonsense, doggon it, for its own sake! I love to get out under a sky like this and just reel and whoop in the pure joy of standing on a world that's whirling round!\"  \"But you do please her. She's told me so.\"  \"Don't you believe her! I don't. I can't. I tell you, Fred, I could never trust a girl that forever looks so trustworthy! S'pose I should fall in love with her! Would you--begrudge her to me?\"  \"I bequeath her to you.\"  \"Ah! you know I haven't the ghost of a chance! She's not for po' little Hil'ry. I never did like small women, anyhow!\"  \"My boy! If ever you like this one she'll no more seem small than the open sea.\"  \"I suppose,\" mused Hilary, \"that's what makes it all the harder to let go. If a girl has a soul so petty that she can sit and hear you through to the last word your heart can bleed, you can turn away from her with some comfort of resentment, as if you still had a remnant of your own stature.\"  \"Precisely!\" said the lover. \"But when she's too large-hearted to let you speak, and yet answers your unspoken word, once for all, with a compassion so modest that it seems as if it were you having compassion on her, she's harder to give up than--\"  \"Doggon her, Fred, I wouldn't give her up!\"  \"Ah, this war, Hilary! I may never see her again. There's just one man in this world whom--\"  \"Oh, get out!\"  \"I mean what I say. To you I leave her.\"  \"Ha, ha! No, you don't! It's only to her you leave me. Old boy, promise me! If you ever come back and she's still in the ring, you'll go for her again no matter who else is bidding, your humble servant not excepted.\"  \"Why--yes--I--I promise that. Now, will you promise me?\"  \"What! let myself--?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Ho-o, not by a jug-full! If ever I feel her harpoon in me I'll fight like a whale! But I promise you this, and warn you, too: That when it comes to that, a whole platoon of Fred Greenleafs between her and me won't make a pinch of difference.\"  To that Greenleaf agreed, and the subject was changed. With shipping ever on their left and cotton-yards and warehouses for tobacco and for salt on their right their horses' feet clinked leisurely over the cobble pavements, between thousands of cotton-bales headed upon the unsheltered wharves and only fewer thousands on the narrow sidewalks.  So passed the better part of an hour before they were made aware, by unmistakable odors, that they were nearing the Stock-Landing. There, while they were yet just a trifle too far away to catch its echoes, had occurred an incident--a fracas, in fact--some of whose results belong with this narrative to its end. While they amble toward the spot let us reconnoitre it. Happily it has long been wiped out, this blot on the city's scutcheon. Its half-dozen streets were unspeakable mud, its air was stenches, its buildings were incredibly foul slaughter-houses and shedded pens of swine, sheep, beeves, cows, calves, and mustang ponies. The plank footways were enclosed by stout rails to guard against the chargings of long-horned cattle chased through the thoroughfares by lasso-whirling \"bull-drivers\" as wild as they. In the middle of the river-front was a ferry, whence Louisiana Avenue, broad, treeless, grassy, and thinly lined with slaughter-houses, led across the plain. Down this untidy plaisance a grimy little street-car, every half-hour, jogged out to the Carrollton railway and returned. This street and the water-front were lighted--twilighted--with lard-oil lamps; the rest of the place was dark. At each of the two corners facing the ferry was a \"coffee-house\"--dram-shop, that is to say.  Messrs. Sam Gibbs and Maxime Lafontaine were president and vice-president of that Patriots' League against whose machinations our two young men had been warned by the detectives in St. Charles Street. They had just now arrived at the Stock-Landing. Naturally, on so important an occasion they were far from sober; yet on reaching the spot they had lost no time in levying on a Gascon butcher for a bucket of tar and a pillow of feathers, on an Italian luggerman for a hurried supper of raw oysters, and on the keeper of one of the \"coffee-houses\" for drinks for the four.  \"Us four and no more!\" sang the gleeful Gibbs; right number to manage a delicate case. The four glasses emptied, he had explained that all charges must be collected, of course, from the alien gentleman for whom the plumage and fixative were destined. Hence a loud war of words, which the barkeeper had almost smoothed out when the light-hearted Gibbs suddenly decreed that the four should sing, march, pat and \"cut the pigeon-wing\" to the new song (given nightly by Christy's Minstrels) entitled \"Dixie's Land.\"  Hot threats recurring, Gascony had turned to go, Maxime had headed him off, Italy's hand had started into his flannel shirt, and \"bing! bang! pop!\" rang Gibbs's repeater and one of Maxime's little derringers--shot off from inside his sack-coat pocket. A whirlwind of epithets filled the place. Out into the stinking dark leaped Naples and Gascony, and after them darted their whooping assailants. The shutters of both barrooms clapped to, over the way a pair of bull-drivers rushed to their mustangs, there was a patter of hoofs there and of boots here and all inner lights vanished. A watchman's rattle buzzed remotely. Then silence reigned.  Now Sam and Maxime, deeming the incident closed, were walking up the levee road beyond the stock-pens, in the new and more sympathetic company of the two mounted bull-drivers, to whose love of patriotic adventure they had appealed successfully. A few yards beyond a roadside pool backed by willow bushes they set down tar-bucket and pillow, and under a low, vast live-oak bough turned and waited. A gibbous moon had set, and presently a fog rolled down the river, blotting out landscape and stars and making even these willows dim and unreal. Ideal conditions! Now if their guest of honor, with or without his friend, would but stop at this pool to wash the"]]]
