No, such fine and terrific ladies are not for swineherds, and it is another sort of wife that I desire.\"  \"Whom then do you desire for a wife,\" says Niafer, \"if not the loveliest and the wealthiest lady in all Rathgor and Lower Targamon?\"  \"Why, I desire the cleverest and dearest and most wonderful creature in all the world,\" says Manuel,--\"whom I recollect seeing some six weeks ago when I was in the kitchen at Arnaye.\"  \"Ah, ah! it might be arranged, then. But who is this marvelous woman?\"  Manuel said, \"You are that woman, Niafer.\"  Niafer replied nothing, but Niafer smiled. Niafer raised one shoulder a little, rubbing it against Manuel's broad chest, but Niafer still kept silence. So the two young people regarded each other for a while, not speaking, and to every appearance not valuing Miramon Lluagor and his encompassing enchantments at a straw's worth, nor valuing anything save each other.  \"All things are changed for me,\" says Manuel, presently, in a hushed voice, \"and for the rest of time I live in a world wherein Niafer differs from all other persons.\"  \"My dearest,\" Niafer replied, \"there is no sparkling queen nor polished princess anywhere but the woman's heart in her would be jumping with joy to have you looking at her twice, and I am only a servant girl!\"  \"But certainly,\" said the rasping voice of Gisèle, \"Niafer is my suitably disguised heathen waiting-woman, to whom my husband sent a dream some while ago, with instructions to join me here, so that I might have somebody to look after my things. So, Niafer, since you were fetched to wait on me, do you stop pawing at that young pig-tender, and tell me what is this I hear about your remarkable cleverness!\"  Instead, it was Manuel who proudly told of the shrewd devices through which Niafer had passed the serpents and the other terrors of sleep. And the while that the tall boy was boasting, Miramon Lluagor smiled, and Gisèle looked very hard at Niafer: for Miramon and his wife both knew that the cleverness of Niafer was as far to seek as her good looks, and that the dream which Miramon had sent had carefully instructed Niafer as to these devices.  \"Therefore, Madame Gisèle,\" says Manuel, in conclusion, \"I will give you Flamberge, and Miramon and Vraidex, and all the rest of earth to boot, in exchange for the most wonderful and clever woman in the world.\"  And with a flourish, Manuel handed over the charmed sword Flamberge to the Count's lovely daughter, and he took the hand of the swart, flat-faced servant girl.  \"Come now,\" says Miramon, in a sad flurry, \"this is an imposing performance. I need not say it arouses in me the most delightful sort of surprise and all other appropriate emotions. But as touches your own interests, Manuel, do you think your behavior is quite sensible?\"  Tall Manuel looked down upon him with a sort of scornful pity. \"Yes, Miramon: for I am Manuel, and I follow after my own thinking and my own desire. Of course it is very fine of me to be renouncing so much wealth and power for the sake of my wonderful dear Niafer: but she is worth the sacrifice, and, besides, she is witnessing all this magnanimity, and cannot well fail to be impressed.\"  Niafer was of course reflecting: \"This is very foolish and dear of him, and I shall be compelled, in mere decency, to pretend to corresponding lunacies for the first month or so of our marriage. After that, I hope, we will settle down to some more reasonable way of living.\"  Meanwhile she regarded Manuel fondly, and quite as though she considered him to be displaying unusual intelligence.  But Gisèle and Miramon were looking at each other, and wondering: \"What can the long-legged boy see in this stupid and plain-featured girl who is years older than he? or she in the young swaggering ragged fool? And how much wiser and happier is our marriage than, in any event, the average marriage!\"  And Miramon, for one, was so deeply moved by the staggering thought which holds together so many couples in the teeth of human nature that he patted his wife's hand. Then he sighed. \"Love has conquered my designs,\" said Miramon, oracularly, \"and the secret of a contented marriage, after all, is to pay particular attention to the wives of everybody else.\"  Gisèle exhorted him not to be a fool, but she spoke without acerbity, and, speaking, she squeezed his hand. She understood this potent magician better than she intended ever to permit him to suspect.  Whereafter Miramon wiped the heavenly bodies from the firmament, and set a miraculous rainbow there, and under its arch was enacted for the swineherd and the servant girl such a betrothal masque of fantasies and illusions as gave full scope to the art of Miramon, and delighted everybody, but delighted Miramon in particular. The dragon that guards hidden treasure made sport for them, the naiads danced, and cherubim fluttered about singing very sweetly and asking droll conundrums. Then they feasted, with unearthly servitors to attend them, and did all else appropriate to an affiancing of deities. And when these junketings were over, Manuel said that, since it seemed he was not to be a wealthy nobleman after all, he and Niafer must be getting, first to the nearest priest's and then back to the pigs.  \"I am not so sure that you can manage it,\" said Miramon, \"for, while the ascent of Vraidex is incommoded by serpents, the quitting of Vraidex is very apt to be hindered by death and fate. For I must tell you I have a rather arbitrary half-brother, who is one of those dreadful Realists, without a scrap of aesthetic feeling, and there is no controlling him.\"  \"Well,\" Manuel considered, \"one cannot live forever among dreams, and death and fate must be encountered by all men. So we can but try.\"  Now for a while the sombre eyes of Miramon Lluagor appraised them. He, who was lord of the nine sleeps and prince of the seven madnesses, now gave a little sigh; for he knew that these young people were enviable and, in the outcome, were unimportant.  So Miramon said, \"Then do you go your way, and if you do not encounter the author and destroyer of us all it will be well for you, and if you do encounter him that too will be well in that it is his wish.\"  \"I neither seek nor avoid him,\" Manuel replied. \"I only know that I must follow after my own thinking, and after a desire which is not to be satisfied with dreams, even though they be\"--the boy appeared to search for a comparison, then, smiling, said,--\"as resplendent as rubies of the Orient.\"  Thereafter Manuel bid farewell to Miramon and Miramon's fine wife, and Manuel descended from marvelous Vraidex with his plain-featured Niafer, quite contentedly. For happiness went with them, if for no great way.  [Illustration]    V   The Eternal Ambuscade   Manuel and Niafer came down from Vraidex without hindrance. There was no happier nor more devoted lover anywhere than young Manuel.  \"For we will be married out of hand, dear snip,\" he says, \"and you will help me to discharge my geas, and afterward we will travel everywhither and into the last limits of earth, so that we may see the ends of this world and may judge them.\"  \"Perhaps we had better wait until next spring, when the roads will be better, Manuel, but certainly we will be married out of hand.\"  In earnest of this, Niafer permitted Manuel to kiss her again, and young Manuel said, for the twenty-second time, \"There is nowhere any happiness like my happiness, nor any love like my love.\"  Thus speaking, and thus disporting themselves, they came leisurely to the base of the gray mountain and to the old maple-trees, under which they found two persons waiting. One was a tall man mounted on a white horse, and leading a riderless black horse. His hat was pulled down about his head so that his face could not be clearly seen.  Now the companion that was with him had the appearance of a bare-headed youngster, with dark red hair, and his face too was hidden as he sat by the roadway trimming his long finger-nails with a small green-handled knife.  \"Hail, friends,\" said Manuel, \"and for whom are you waiting here?\"  \"I wait for one to ride on this black horse of mine,\" replied the mounted stranger. \"It was decreed that the first person who passed this way must be his rider, but you two come abreast. So do you choose between you which one rides.\"  \"Well, but it is a fine steed surely,\" Manuel said, \"and a steed fit for Charlemagne or Hector or any of the famous champions of the old time.\"  \"Each one of them has ridden upon this black horse of mine,\" replied the stranger.  Niafer said, \"I am frightened.\" And above them a furtive wind began to rustle in the torn, discolored maple-leaves.  \"--For it is a fine steed and an old steed,\" the stranger went on, \"and a tireless steed that bears all away. It has the fault, some say, that its riders do not return, but there is no pleasing everybody.\"  \"Friend,\" Manuel said, in a changed voice, \"who are you, and what is your name?\"  \"I am half-brother to Miramon Lluagor, lord of the nine sleeps, but I am lord of another kind of sleeping; and as for my name, it is the name that is in your thoughts and the name which most troubles you, and the name which you think about most often.\"  There was silence. Manuel worked his lips foolishly. \"I wish we had not walked abreast,\" he said. \"I wish we had remained among the bright dreams.\"  \"All persons voice some regret or another at meeting me. And it does not ever matter.\"  \"But if there were no choosing in the affair, I could make shift to endure it, either way. Now one of us, you tell me, must depart with you. If I say, 'Let Niafer be that one,' I must always recall that saying with self-loathing.\"  \"But I too say it!\" Niafer was petting him and trembling.  \"Besides,\" observed the rider of the white horse, \"you have a choice of sayings.\"  \"The other saying,\" Manuel replied, \"I cannot utter. Yet I wish I were not forced to confess this. It sounds badly. At all events, I love Niafer better than I love "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11639"],["title","Figures of Earth: A Comedy of Appearances (#7)"],["body","other person, but I do not value Niafer's life more highly than I value my own life, and it would be nonsense to say so. No; my life is very necessary to me, and there is a geas upon me to make a figure in this world before I leave it.\"  \"My dearest,\" says Niafer, \"you have chosen wisely.\"  The veiled horseman said nothing at all. But he took off his hat, and the beholders shuddered. The kinship to Miramon was apparent, you could see the resemblance, but they had never seen in Miramon Lluagor's face what they saw here.  Then Niafer bade farewell to Manuel with pitiable whispered words. They kissed. For an instant Manuel stood motionless. He queerly moved his mouth, as though it were stiff and he were trying to make it more supple. Thereafter Manuel, very sick and desperate looking, did what was requisite. So Niafer went away with Grandfather Death, in Manuel's stead.  \"My heart cracks in me now,\" says Manuel, forlornly considering his hands, \"but better she than I. Still, this is a poor beginning in life, for yesterday great wealth and to-day great love was within my reach, and now I have lost both.\"  \"But you did not go the right way about to win success in anything,\" says the remaining stranger.  And now this other stranger arose from the trimming of his long fingernails; and you could see this was a tall, lean youngster (though not so tall as Manuel, and nothing like so stalwart), with ruddy cheeks, wide-set brown eyes, and crinkling, rather dark red hair.  Then Manuel rubbed his wet hands as clean as might be, and this boy walked on a little way with Manuel, talking of that which had been and of some things which were to be. And Manuel said, \"Now assuredly, Horvendile, since that is your name, such talking is insane talking, and no comfort whatever to me in my grief at losing Niafer.\"  \"This is but the beginning of your losses, Manuel, for I think that a little by a little you will lose everything which is desirable, until you shall have remaining at the last only a satiation, and a weariness, and an uneasy loathing of all that the human wisdom of your elders shall have induced you to procure.\"  \"But, Horvendile, can anybody foretell the future? Or can it be that Miramon spoke seriously in saying that fate also was enleagued to forbid the leaving of this mountain?\"  \"No, Manuel, I do not say that I am fate nor any of the Léshy, but rather it seems to me that I am insane. So perhaps the less attention you pay to my talking, the better. For I must tell you that this wasted country side, this mountain, this road, and these old maples, and that rock yonder, appear to me to be things I have imagined, and that you, and the Niafer whom you have just disposed of so untidily, and Miramon and his fair shrew, and all of you, appear to me to be persons I have imagined; and all the living in this world appears to me to be only a notion of mine.\"  \"Why, then, certainly I would say, or rather, I would think it unnecessary to say, that you are insane.\"  \"You speak without hesitation, and it is through your ability to settle such whimseys out of hand that you will yet win, it may be, to success.\"  \"Yes, but,\" asked Manuel, slowly, \"what is success?\"  \"In your deep mind, I think, that question is already answered.\"  \"Undoubtedly I have my notion, but it was about your notion I was asking.\"  Horvendile looked grave, and yet whimsical too. \"Why, I have heard somewhere,\" says he, \"that at its uttermost this success is but the strivings of an ape reft of his tail, and grown rusty at climbing, who yet feels himself to be a symbol and the frail representative of Omnipotence in a place that is not home.\"  Manuel appeared to reserve judgment. \"How does the successful ape employ himself, in these not quite friendly places?\"  \"He strives blunderingly, from mystery to mystery, with pathetic makeshifts, not understanding anything, greedy in all desires, and honeycombed with poltroonery, and yet ready to give all, and to die fighting for the sake of that undemonstrable idea, about his being Heaven's vicar and heir.\"  Manuel shook his small bright head. \"You use too many long words. But so far I can understand you, that is not the sort of success I want. No, I am Manuel, and I must follow after my own thinking and my own desire, without considering other people and their notions of success.\"  \"As for denying yourself consideration for other people, I am of the opinion, after witnessing your recent disposal of your sweetheart, that you are already tolerably expert in that sort of abnegation.\"  \"Hah, but you do not know what is seething here,\" replied Manuel, smiting his broad chest. \"And I shall not tell you of it, Horvendile, since you are not fate nor any of the Léshy, to give me my desire.\"  \"What would be your desire?\"  \"My wish would be for me always to obtain whatever I may wish for. Yes, Horvendile, I have often wondered why, in the old legends, when three wishes were being offered, nobody ever made that sensible and economical wish the first of all.\"  \"What need is there to trouble the Léshy about that foolish wish when it is always possible, at a paid price, to obtain whatever one desires? You have but to go about it in this way.\" And Horvendile told Manuel a queer and dangerous thing. Then Horvendile said sadly: \"So much knowledge I can deny nobody at Michaelmas. But I must tell you the price also, and it is that with the achieving of each desire you will perceive its worth.\"  Thus speaking, Horvendile parted the thicket beside the roadway. A beautiful dusk-colored woman waited there, in a green-blue robe, and on her head was a blue coronet surmounted with green feathers: she carried a vase. Horvendile stepped forward, and the thicket closed behind him, concealing Horvendile and this woman.  Manuel, looking puzzled, went on a little way, and when he was assured of being alone he flung himself face downward and wept. The reason of this was, they relate, that young Manuel had loved Niafer as he could love nobody else. Then he arose, and went toward the pool of Haranton, on his way homeward, after having failed in everything.  [Illustration]    VI   Economics of Math   What forthwith happened at the pool of Haranton is not nicely adapted to exact description, but it was sufficiently curious to give Manuel's thoughts a new turn, although it did not seem, even so, to make them happy thoughts. Certainly it was not with any appearance of merriment that Manuel returned to his half-sister Math, who was the miller's wife.  \"And wherever have you been all this week?\" says Math, \"with the pigs rooting all over creation, and with that man of mine forever flinging your worthlessness in my face, and with that red-haired Suskind coming out of the twilight a-seeking after you every evening and pestering me with her soft lamentations? And for the matter of that, whatever are you glooming over?\"  \"I have cause, and cause to spare.\"  Manuel told her of his adventures upon Vraidex, and Math said that showed what came of neglecting his proper business, which was attendance on her husband's pigs. Manuel then told her of what had just befallen by the pool of Haranton.  Math nodded. \"Take shame to yourself, young rascal with your Niafer hardly settled down in paradise, and with your Suskind wailing for you in the twilight! But that would be Alianora the Unattainable Princess. Thus she comes across the Bay of Biscay, traveling from the far land of Provence, in, they say, the appearance of a swan: and thus she bathes in the pool wherein strange dreams engender: and thus she slips into the robe of the Apsarasas when it is high time to be leaving such impudent knaves as you have proved yourself to be.\"  \"Yes, yes! a shift made all of shining white feathers, Sister. Here is a feather that was broken from it as I clutched at her.\"  Math turned the feather in her hand. \"Now to be sure! and did you ever see the like of it! Still, a broken feather is no good to anybody, and, as I have told you any number of times, I cannot have trash littering up my kitchen.\"  So Math dropped this shining white feather into the fire, on which she was warming over a pot of soup for Manuel's dinner, and they watched this feather burn.  Manuel says, sighing, \"Even so my days consume, and my youth goes out of me, in a land wherein Suskind whispers of uncomfortable things, and wherein there are no maids so clever and dear as Niafer, nor so lovely as Alianora.\"  Math said: \"I never held with speaking ill of the dead. So may luck and fair words go with your Niafer in her pagan paradise. Of your Suskind too\"--Math crossed herself,--\"the less said, the better. But as for your Alianora, no really nice girl would be flying in the face of heaven and showing her ankles to five nations, and bathing, on a Monday too, in places where almost anybody might come along. It is not proper, but I wonder at her parents.\"  \"But, Sister, she is a princess!\"  \"Just so: therefore I burned the feather, because it is not wholesome for persons of our station in life to be robbing princesses of anything, though it be only of a feather.\"  \"Sister, that is the truth! It is not right to rob anybody of anything, and this would appear to make another bond upon me and another obligation to be discharged, because in taking that feather I have taken what did not belong to me.\"  \"Boy, do not think you are fooling me, for when your face gets that look on it, I know you are considering some nonsense over and above the nonsense you are talking. However, from your description of the affair, I do not doubt that gallivanting, stark-naked princess thought you were for taking what did not belong to you. Therefore I burned the feather, lest it be recognized and bring you to the gallows or to a worse place. So why did you not scrape your feet before coming into my clean kitchen? and how many times do you expect me to speak to you about that?\"  Manuel said nothing. But he seemed to meditate over something that puzzled him."]]]
