And she must be held to strict account for it, must justify it, give her reasons. So we must find her for you--\"  \"I am not at all anxious, really,\" the Countess said, quickly, and the remark told against her.  \"Well, now, Madame la Comtesse, as to her description. Will you tell us what was her height, figure, colour of eyes, hair, general appearance?\"  \"She was tall, above the middle height, at least; slight, good figure, black hair and eyes.\"  \"Pretty?\"  \"That depends upon what you mean by 'pretty.' Some people might think so, in her own class.\"  \"How was she dressed?\"  \"In plain dark serge, bonnet of black straw and brown ribbons. I do not allow my maid to wear colours.\"  \"Exactly. And her name, age, place of birth?\"  \"Hortense Petitpré, thirty-two, born, I believe, in Paris.\"  The Judge, when these particulars had been given, looked over his shoulder towards the detective, but said nothing. It was quite unnecessary, for M. Floçon, who had been writing in his note-book, now rose and left the room. He called Galipaud to him, saying sharply:  \"Here is the more detailed description of the lady's maid, and in writing. Have it copied and circulate it at once. Give it to the station-master, and to the agents of police round about here. I have an idea--only an idea--that this woman has not gone far. It may be worth nothing, still there is the chance. People who are wanted often hang about the very place they would _not_ stay in if they were wise. Anyhow, set a watch for her and come back here.\"  Meanwhile, the Judge had continued his questioning.  \"And where, madame, did you obtain your maid?\"  \"In Rome. She was there, out of a place. I heard of her at an agency and registry office, when I was looking for a maid a month or two ago.\"  \"Then she has not been long in your service?\"  \"No; as I tell you, she came to me in December last.\"  \"Well recommended?\"  \"Strongly. She had lived with good families, French and English.\"  \"And with you, what was her character?\"  \"Irreproachable.\"  \"Well, so much for Hortense Petitpré. She is not far off, I dare say. When we want her we shall be able to lay hands on her, I do not doubt, madame may rest assured.\"  \"Pray take no trouble in the matter. I certainly should not keep her.\"  \"Very well, very well. And now, another small matter. I see,\" he referred to the rough plan of the sleeping-car prepared by M. Floçon,--\"I see that you occupied the compartment _d_, with berths Nos. 9 and 10?\"  \"I think 9 was the number of my berth.\"  \"It was. You may be certain of that. Now next door to your compartment--do you know who was next door? I mean in 7 and 8?\"  The Countess's lip quivered, and she was a prey to sudden emotion as she answered in a low voice:  \"It was where--where--\"  \"There, there, madame,\" said the Judge, reassuring her as he would a little child. \"You need not say. It is no doubt very distressing to you. Yet, you know?\"  She bent her head slowly, but uttered no word.  \"Now this man, this poor man, had you noticed him at all? No--no--not afterwards, of course. It would not be likely. But during the journey. Did you speak to him, or he to you?\"  \"No, no--distinctly no.\"  \"Nor see him?\"  \"Yes, I saw him, I believe, at Modane with the rest when we dined.\"  \"Ah! exactly so. He dined at Modane. Was that the only occasion on which you saw him? You had never met him previously in Rome, where you resided?\"  \"Whom do you mean? The murdered man?\"  \"Who else?\"  \"No, not that I am aware of. At least I did not recognize him as a friend.\"  \"I presume, if he was among your friends--\"  \"Pardon me, that he certainly was not,\" interrupted the Countess.  \"Well, among your acquaintances--he would probably have made himself known to you?\"  \"I suppose so.\"  \"And he did not do so? He never spoke to you, nor you to him?\"  \"I never saw him, the occupant of that compartment, except on that one occasion. I kept a good deal in my compartment during the journey.\"  \"Alone? It must have been very dull for you,\" said the Judge, pleasantly.  \"I was not always alone,\" said the Countess, hesitatingly, and with a slight flush. \"I had friends in the car.\"  \"Oh--oh\"--the exclamation was long-drawn and rather significant.  \"Who were they? You may as well tell us, madame, we should certainly find out.\"  \"I have no wish to withhold the information,\" she replied, now turning pale, possibly at the imputation conveyed. \"Why should I?\"  \"And these friends were--?\"  \"Sir Charles Collingham and his brother. They came and sat with me occasionally; sometimes one, sometimes the other.\"  \"During the day?\"  \"Of course, during the day.\" Her eyes flashed, as though the question was another offence.  \"Have you known them long?\"  \"The General I met in Roman society last winter. It was he who introduced his brother.\"  \"Very good, so far. The General knew you, took an interest in you. That explains his strange, unjustifiable conduct just now--\"  \"I do not think it was either strange or unjustifiable,\" interrupted the Countess, hotly. \"_He_ is a gentleman.\"  \"Quite a _preux cavalier_, of course. But we will pass on. You are not a good sleeper, I believe, madame?\"  \"Indeed no, I sleep badly, as a rule.\"  \"Then you would be easily disturbed. Now, last night, did you hear anything strange in the car, more particularly in the adjoining compartment?\"  \"Nothing.\"  \"No sound of voices raised high, no noise of a conflict, a struggle?\"  \"No, monsieur.\"  \"That is odd. I cannot understand it. We know, beyond all question, from the appearance of the body,--the corpse,--that there was a fight, an encounter. Yet you, a wretched sleeper, with only a thin plank of wood between you and the affray, hear nothing, absolutely nothing. It is _most_ extraordinary.\"  \"I was asleep. I must have been asleep.\"  \"A light sleeper would certainly be awakened. How can you explain--how can you reconcile that?\" The question was blandly put, but the Judge's incredulity verged upon actual insolence.  \"Easily: I had taken a soporific. I always do, on a journey. I am obliged to keep something, sulphonal or chloral, by me, on purpose.\"  \"Then this, madame, is yours?\" And the Judge, with an air of undisguised triumph, produced the small glass vial which M. Floçon had picked up in the sleeping-car near the conductor's seat.  The Countess, with a quick gesture, put out her hand to take it.  \"No, I cannot give it up. Look as near as you like, and say is it yours?\"  \"Of course it is mine. Where did you get it? Not in my berth?\"  \"No, madame, not in your berth.\"  \"But where?\"  \"Pardon me, we shall not tell you--not just now.\"  \"I missed it last night,\" went on the Countess, slightly confused.  \"After you had taken your dose of chloral?\"  \"No, before.\"  \"And why did you want this? It is laudanum.\"  \"For my nerves. I have a toothache. I--I--really, sir, I need not tell you all my ailments.\"  \"And the maid had removed it?\"  \"So I presume; she must have taken it out of the bag in the first instance.\"  \"And then kept it?\"  \"That is what I can only suppose.\"  \"Ah!\"   CHAPTER VII  When the Judge had brought down the interrogation of the Countess to the production of the small glass bottle, he paused, and with a long-drawn \"Ah!\" of satisfaction, looked round at his colleagues.  Both M. Floçon and the Commissary nodded their heads approvingly, plainly sharing his triumph.  Then they all put their heads together in close, whispered conference.  \"Admirable, M. le Juge!\" said the detective. \"You have been most adroit. It is a clear case.\"  \"No doubt,\" said the Commissary, who was a blunt, rather coarse person, believing that to take anybody and everybody into custody is always the safest and simplest course. \"It looks black against her. I think she ought to be arrested at once.\"  \"We might, indeed we ought to have more evidence, more definite evidence, perhaps?\" The Judge was musing over the facts as he knew them. \"I should like, before going further, to look at the car,\" he said, suddenly coming to a conclusion.  M. Floçon readily agreed. \"We will go together,\" he said, adding, \"Madame will remain here, please, until we return. It may not be for long.\"  \"And afterwards?\" asked the Countess, whose nervousness had if anything increased during the whispered colloquy of the officials.  \"Ah, afterwards! Who knows?\" was the reply, with a shrug of the shoulders, all most enigmatic and unsatisfactory.  \"What have we against her?\" said the Judge, as soon as they had gained the absolute privacy of the sleeping-car.  \"The bottle of laudanum and the porter's condition. He was undoubtedly drugged,\" answered the detective; and the discussion which followed took the form of a dialogue between them, for the Commissary took no part in it.  \"Yes; but why by the Countess? How do we know that positively?\"  \"It is her bottle,\" said M. Floçon.  \"Her story may be true--that she missed it, that the maid took it.\"  \"We have nothing whatever against the maid. We know nothing about her.\"  \"No. Except that she has disappeared. But that tells more against her mistress. It is all very vague. I do not see my way quite, as yet.\"  \"But the fragment of lace, the broken beading? Surely, M. le Juge, they are a woman's, and only one woman was in the car--\"  \"So far as we know.\"  \"But if these could be proved to be hers?\"  \"Ah! if you could prove that!\"  \"Easy enough. Have her searched, here at once, in the station. There is a female searcher attached to the detention-room.\"  \"It is a strong measure. She is a lady.\"  \"Ladies who commit crimes must not expect to be handled with kid gloves.\"  \"She is an Englishwoman, or with English connections; titled, too. I hesitate, upon my word. Suppose we are wrong? It may lead to unpleasantness. M. le Prefet is anxious to avoid complications possibly international.\"  As he spoke, he bent over, and, taking a magnifier from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11451"],["title","The Rome Express (#6)"],["body","pocket, examined the lace, which still fluttered where it was caught.  \"It is fine lace, I think. What say you, M. Floçon? You may be more experienced in such matters.\"  \"The finest, or nearly so; I believe it is Valenciennes--the trimming of some underclothing, I should think. That surely is sufficient, M. le Juge?\"  M. Beaumont le Hardi gave a reluctant consent, and the Chief went back himself to see that the searching was undertaken without loss of time.  The Countess protested, but vainly, against this new indignity. What could she do? A prisoner, practically friendless,--for the General was not within reach,--to resist was out of the question. Indeed, she was plainly told that force would be employed unless she submitted with a good grace. There was nothing for it but to obey.  Mother Tontaine, as the female searcher called herself, was an evil-visaged, corpulent old creature, with a sickly, soft, insinuating voice, and a greasy, familiar manner that was most offensive. They had given her the scrap of torn lace and the débris of the jet as a guide, with very particular directions to see if they corresponded with any part of the lady's apparel.  She soon showed her quality.  \"Aha! oho! What is this, my pretty princess? How comes so great a lady into the hands of Mother Tontaine? But I will not harm you, my beauty, my pretty, my little one. Oh, no, no, I will not trouble you, dearie. No, trust to me;\" and she held out one skinny claw, and looked the other way. The Countess did not or would not understand.  \"Madame has money?\" went on the old hag in a half-threatening, half-coaxing whisper, as she came up quite close, and fastened on her victim like a bird of prey.  \"If you mean that I am to bribe you--\"  \"Fie, the nasty word! But just a small present, a pretty gift, one or two yellow bits, twenty, thirty, forty francs--you'd better.\" She shook the soft arm she held roughly, and anything seemed preferable than to be touched by this horrible woman.  \"Wait, wait!\" cried the Countess, shivering all over, and, feeling hastily for her purse, she took out several napoleons.  \"Aha! oho! One, two, three,\" said the searcher in a fat, wheedling voice. \"Four, yes, four, five;\" and she clinked the coins together in her palm, while a covetous light came into her faded eyes at the joyous sound. \"Five--make it five at once, d'ye hear me?--or I'll call them in and tell them. That will go against you, my princess. What, try to bribe a poor old woman, Mother Tontaine, honest and incorruptible Tontaine? Five, then, five!\"  With trembling haste the Countess emptied the whole contents of her purse in the old hag's hand.  \"_Bon aubaine_. Nice pickings. It is a misery what they pay me here. I am, oh, so poor, and I have children, many babies. You will not tell them--the police--you dare not. No, no, no.\"  Thus muttering to herself, she shambled across the room to a corner, where she stowed the money safely away. Then she came back, showed the bit of lace, and pressed it into the Countess's hands.  \"Do you know this, little one? Where it comes from, where there is much more? I was told to look for it, to search for it on you;\" and with a quick gesture she lifted the edge of the Countess's skirt, dropping it next moment with a low, chuckling laugh.  \"Oho! aha! You were right, my pretty, to pay me, my pretty--right. And some day, to-day, to-morrow, whenever I ask you, you will remember Mother Tontaine.\"  The Countess listened with dismay. What had she done? Put herself into the power of this greedy and unscrupulous old beldame?  \"And this, my princess? What have we here, aha?\"  Mère Tontaine held up next the broken bit of jet ornament for inspection, and as the Countess leaned forward to examine it more closely, gave it into her hand.  \"You recognize it, of course. But be careful, my pretty! Beware! If any one were looking, it would ruin you. I could not save you then. Sh! say nothing, only look, and quick, give it me back. I must have it to show.\"  All this time the Countess was turning the jet over and over in her open palm, with a perplexed, disturbed, but hardly a terrified air.  Yes, she knew it, or thought she knew it. It had been--But how had it come here, into the possession of this base myrmidon of the French police?  \"Give it me, quick!\" There was a loud knock at the door. \"They are coming. Remember!\" Mother Tontaine put her long finger to her lip. \"Not a word! I have found nothing, of course. Nothing, I can swear to that, and you will not forget Mother Tontaine?\"  Now M. Floçon stood at the open door awaiting the searcher's report. He looked much disconcerted when the old woman took him on one side and briefly explained that the search had been altogether fruitless.  There was nothing to justify suspicion, nothing, so far as she could find.  The detective looked from one to the other--from the hag he had employed in this unpleasant quest, to the lady on whom it had been tried. The Countess, to his surprise, did not complain. He had expected further and strong upbraidings. Strange to say, she took it very quietly. There was no indignation in her face. She was still pale, and her hands trembled, but she said nothing, made no reference, at least, to what she had just gone through.  Again he took counsel with his colleague, while the Countess was kept apart.  \"What next, M. Floçon?\" asked the Judge. \"What shall we do with her?\"  \"Let her go,\" answered the detective, briefly.  \"What! do you suggest this, sir,\" said the Judge, slyly. \"After your strong and well-grounded suspicions?\"  \"They are as strong as ever, stronger: and I feel sure I shall yet justify them. But what I wish now is to let her go at large, under surveillance.\"  \"Ah! you would shadow her?\"  \"Precisely. By a good agent. Galipaud, for instance. He speaks English, and he can, if necessary, follow her anywhere, even to England.\"  \"She can be extradited,\" said the Commissary, with his one prominent idea of arrest.  \"Do you agree, M. le Juge? Then, if you will permit me, I will give the necessary orders, and perhaps you will inform the lady that she is free to leave the station?\"  The Countess now had reason to change her opinion of the French officials. Great politeness now replaced the first severity that had been so cruel. She was told, with many bows and apologies, that her regretted but unavoidable detention was at an end. Not only was she freely allowed to depart, but she was escorted by both M. Floçon and the Commissary outside, to where an omnibus was in waiting, and all her baggage piled on top, even to the dressing-bag, which had been neatly repacked for her.  But the little silver-topped vial had not been restored to her, nor the handkerchief.  In her joy at her deliverance, either she had not given these a second thought, or she did not wish to appear anxious to recover them.  Nor did she notice that, as the bus passed through the gates at the bottom of the large slope that leads from the Lyons Station, it was followed at a discreet distance by a modest fiacre, which pulled up, eventually, outside the Hôtel Madagascar. Its occupant, M. Galipaud, kept the Countess in sight, and, entering the hotel at her heels, waited till she had left the office, when he held a long conference with the proprietor.   CHAPTER VIII  A first stage in the inquiry had now been reached, with results that seemed promising, and were yet contradictory.  No doubt the watch to be set on the Countess might lead to something yet--something to bring first plausible suspicion to a triumphant issue; but the examination of the other occupants of the car should not be allowed to slacken on that account. The Countess might have some confederate among them--this pestilent English General, perhaps, who had made himself so conspicuous in her defence; or some one of them might throw light upon her movements, upon her conduct during the journey.  Then, with a spasm of self-reproach, M. Floçon remembered that two distinct suggestions had been made to him by two of the travellers, and that, so far, he had neglected them. One was the significant hint from the Italian that he could materially help the inquiry. The other was the General's sneering assertion that the train had not continued its journey uninterruptedly between Laroche and Paris.  Consulting the Judge, and laying these facts before him, it was agreed that the Italian's offer seemed the most important, and he was accordingly called in next.  \"Who and what are you?\" asked the Judge, carelessly, but the answer roused him at once to intense interest, and he could not quite resist a glance of reproach at M. Floçon.  \"My name I have given you--Natale Ripaldi. I am a detective officer belonging to the Roman police.\"  \"What!\" cried M. Floçon, colouring deeply. \"This is unheard of. Why in the name of all the devils have you withheld this most astonishing statement until now?\"  \"Monsieur surely remembers. I told him half an hour ago I had something important to communicate--\"  \"Yes, yes, of course. But why were you so reticent. Good Heavens!\"  \"Monsieur was not so encouraging that I felt disposed to force on him what I knew he would have to hear in due course.\"  \"It is monstrous--quite abominable, and shall not end here. Your superiors shall hear of your conduct,\" went on the Chief, hotly.  \"They will also hear, and, I think, listen to my version of the story,--that I offered you fairly, and at the first opportunity, all the information I had, and that you refused to accept it.\"  \"You should have persisted. It was your manifest duty. You are an officer of the law, or you say you are.\"  \"Pray telegraph at once, if you think fit, to Rome, to the police authorities, and you will find that Natale Ripaldi--your humble servant--travelled by the through express with their knowledge and authority. And here are my credentials, my official card, some official letters--\"  \"And what, in a word, have you to tell us?\"  \"I can tell you who the murdered man "]]]
