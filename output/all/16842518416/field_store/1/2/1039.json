Ambrosia was almost affected to tears, once more. The scene was so beautiful, and the allusion so touching, and there seemed to her such a charm over her God-daughter Hermione; she was herself so glad, too, to feel sure that success had crowned her gift, that, altogether, her Fairy heart grew quite soft. \"You may do as you like about observing Hermione further,\" cried she. \"But, for my part, I am now satisfied. She is enjoying life to the uttermost; all its beauties of sight and sound; its outward loveliness; its inward mysteries. She will never marry but from love, and one whose heart can sympathise with hers. Ah, Ianthe, what more has life to give? You will say, she is not beautiful; perhaps not for a marble statue; but the grace of poetical feeling is in her every look and action. Ah, she will walk by the side of manhood, turning even the hard realities of life into beauty by that living well-spring of sweet thoughts and fancies that I see beaming from her eyes. Look at her now, Ianthe, and confess that surely that countenance breathes more beauty than chiselled features can give.\" And certainly, whether some mesmeric influence from her enthusiastic Fairy Godmother was working on Hermione's brain, or whether her own quotation upon the doomed tree had stirred up other poetical recollections, I know not; but as she was retracing her steps homewards, she repeated to herself softly but with much pathos, Coleridge's lines:[2]        \"O lady, we receive but what we give,       And in our life alone does nature live:   Ours is her wedding-garment, ours her shroud!   And would we aught behold, of higher worth,   Than that inanimate cold world allowed   To the poor loveless ever anxious crowd,   Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth   A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud       Enveloping the earth--   And from the soul itself must there be sent   A sweet and potent voice, of its own birth,   Of all sweet sounds the life and element!\"  [2] Coleridge's \"Dejection: an Ode.\"  And, turning through the little handgate at the extremity of the wood, she pursued the train of thought with heightened colour in her cheeks--    \"I may not hope from outward forms to win   The passion and the life, whose fountains are within.\"  And thus Hermione reached her home, her countenance lighted up by the pleasure of success, and the sweet and healthy musings of her solitary walk.  She entered the library of a beautiful country house by the low window that opened on to the lawn, and found her mother reading.  \"I cannot tell you how lovely the day is, Mamma, every thing is so fresh, and the shadows and lights are so good! I have immortalized our poor old friend the oak, before they cut him down,\" added she, smiling, as she placed the drawing in her mother's hands. \"I wish the forest belonged to some one who had not this cruel taste for turning knotted oak trees into fancy work-tables. It is as bad as what Charles Lamb said of the firs, 'which look so romantic alive, and die into desks.'--Die into desks!\" repeated Hermione musingly, as she seated herself on the sofa, and took up a book that was before her on the table; mechanically removing her bonnet from her head, and laying it down by her side as she spoke.  And here for some time there was a silence, during which Hermione's mother ceased reading, and, lifting up her eyes, looked at her daughter with mingled love, admiration, and interest. \"I wish I had her picture so,\" dreamt the poor lady, as she gazed; \"so earnest, and understanding, and yet so simple, and kind!--There is but one difficulty for her in life,\" was the next thought; \"with such keen enjoyment of this world, such appreciation of the beauties, and wonders, and delights of God's creations on earth--to keep the eye of faith firmly fixed on the 'better and more enduring inheritance,' to which both she and I, but I trust she, far behind, are hastening. Yet, by God's blessing, and with Christian training, and the habit of active charity, and the vicissitudes of life, I have few or no fears. But such capability of happiness in this world is a great temptation, and I sometimes fancy must therefore have been a Fairy gift.\" And here the no longer young Mother of Hermione fell into a reverie, and a long pause ensued, during which Ambrosia felt very sad, for it grieved her to think that the good and reasonable Mother should be so much afraid of Fairy gifts, even when the result had been so favourable.  A note at length interrupted the prolonged silence. It was from Aurora the Beauty, whose Father possessed a large estate in the neighbourhood, and who had just then come into the country for a few weeks. Aurora earnestly requested Hermione and her Mother to visit her.  \"I will do as you wish,\" said Hermione, looking rather grave; \"but really a visit to Aurora is a sort of small misfortune.\"  \"I hope you are not envious of her beauty, Hermione? Take care.\"  \"Nay, you are cruel, Mamma, now. I should like to be handsome, but not at the expense of being so very dull in spirits as poor Aurora often is. But really, unless you have ever spent an hour alone with her, you can form no idea of how tired one gets.\"  \"What of, Hermione? of her face?\"  \"Oh no, not of her face; it is charming, and by the way you have just put into my head how I may escape from being tired, even if I am left alone with her for hours!\"  \"Nay, now you really puzzle me, my dear; I suggested nothing but looking at her face.\"  \"Ah, but as she is really and truly such a model of beauty, what do you think of offering to make a likeness of her, Mamma? It will delight her to sit and be looked at, even by me, in the country, and I shall be so much pleased to have such a pleasant occupation. I am quite reconciled to the idea of going.\"  And a note was written, and despatched accordingly.  \"But,\" persisted Hermione, rising to sit near her Mother, \"you do not above half know Aurora. One would think she had been born in what is called a 'four warnt way,' with nothing but cross roads about her. Nothing is ever right. She is always either exhausted with the heat of the sun, or frozen with cold, or the evening is so tedious, she wants it to be bedtime, or if there is any unusual gaiety going on, she quarrels with the same length of evening, because it is so intolerably short; and, in short, she is never truly happy but when she is surrounded by admirers, whether men or women. And this seems to me to be a sad way of '_getting her time over_,' as the poor women say of life. Ah, Mamma, it goes but too quickly.\"  \"Aurora is indeed foolish,\" musingly ejaculated the Mother.  \"Not altogether either, my dear Mother. She knows much; but the fault is, she cares for nothing. She has got the carcase, as it were, of knowledge and accomplishments; but the vivifying spirit is wanting. You know yourself how well she plays and sings occasionally, if there is a question of charming a room full of company. Yet there can be no sentiment about her music after all, or it would be an equal pleasure to her at other times. But really it almost makes me as discontented with life as herself to hear her talk in unexcited hours. Turning over my books one day, she said, 'You can never be either a poet or a painter, or a Mozart or a philosopher, Hermione? what is the use of all your labour and poking?' What could I say? I felt myself colour up, and I laughed out, 'Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, all is vanity!' Yet certainly God has set before us the things of earth in order that we may admire and find them out; and that is the answer to all such foolish questions!\" And Hermione was turning to leave the room, but she came back and said--\"Do you know, Mamma, though you will laugh at the idea, I do think Aurora would be a very nice girl, and very happy, if she either could grow very ugly all at once, or if any thing in the world could make her forget her beauty.--And,\" added she, in a half whisper, \"if there is any thing in Fairy lore, I could almost fancy some cruel Fairy had owed her family a grudge, and had given her this gift of excessive beauty on purpose to be the plague and misfortune of her life.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Enough, enough, and too much,\" cried Euphrosyne impatiently. \"The matter is now, I think, concluded. Ianthe and I have failed, and though you are successful, Ambrosia, even you have not come off without a rebuff. Now, farewell to earth. I am weary of it. I do not know your gift, and I am sick of listening to conversations I cannot understand. Let us begone. If we de delay, they will begin again. Ah, my sisters, my spirit yearns for our fairer clime!\"  And they arose; but yet awhile they lingered on the velvet lawn before that country-house, for as they were preparing for flight, the sounds they loved so well, of harmonious music, greeted their ears.  \"Ah, there is the artist's hand again,\" cried Ambrosia. \"I see the lovely sketch before me once more!\"  And so it was, that it, and the peaceful forest scene, and the interesting face of Hermione, seemed to reappear before them all as they listened to her music. Tender, and full of sentiment were the sounds at first, as if the musician were acting the scene of the opera whence they came.  \"Lieder ohne Worte,\"[3] murmured Ambrosia.  [3] Songs without Words.--Mendelssohn.  But it was to the swelling sounds of a farewell chorus that they arose into the air, and took their leave of earth.  And now, dear Readers, there is but one thing more to do. To ask if you have guessed the Fairy gift?  The Fairies, you see, had not. What Euphrosyne had said was true. They had listened to such a quantity of conversation they could not understand, and they were so unused to _think_ much about any thing, or to hear much beyond their own pretty light talk and sweet songs, that their poor little brains had got quite muddled.

Certain it is, they returned very pensive, very cross, and rather dusty to Fairy Land.  They arrived at the beautiful bay I first described, and floated to a large party of their sisters, who were dancing on the sands.  There was a clapping of tiny hands, and shouts of joy as they approached; and \"What news? what news?\" cried many voices.  \"Ah, what news, Sister Euphrosyne!\" cried little Aglaia, floating forward, \"from the smudgy old earth; Is it beauty, riches, or what?\"  \"I cannot answer your question,\" said Euphrosyne, pushing forward.  A circle was now formed round the travellers, and the details I have given you were made by Ianthe. And she wound up by saying, \"And what Ambrosia's gift to Hermione has been, we cannot make out.\"  \"Then I will tell you!\" cried little Aglaia, springing lightly high into the air, and descending gently on a huge shell at her feet; \"_She likes every thing she does, and she likes to be always doing something_. You can't put the meaning into one word, as you can Beauty and Riches; but still it _is_ something. Can't you think of some way of saying what I have told you? Dear me, how stupid you are all grown. And _liking_ isn't the right word: it is something stronger than common _liking_.\"  \"Love, perhaps,\" murmured Leila.  \"An excellent idea,\" cried Euphrosyne; \"dear me, this delicious air is clearing my poor head. Sisters, I will express it for you, and Ambrosia shall say if I am right. It is THE LOVE OF EMPLOYMENT.\"  Ambrosia laughed assent; but a low murmur of discontent resounded through the Fairy group.  \"Intolerable!\" cried Leila, shrugging her shoulders like a French woman.  \"It is no Fairy gift at all,\" exclaimed others; \"it is downright plodding and working.\"  \"If the human race can be made happy by nothing but labour,\" cried another; \"I propose we leave them to themselves, and give them no more Fairy gifts at all.\"  \"Remember,\" cried Ambrosia, now coming forward, \"this is our first experiment upon human happiness. Hitherto we have given Fairy gifts, and never enquired how they have acted. And I feel sure we have always forgotten one thing, viz. that poor men and women living in Time, and only having in their power the small bit of it which is present, cannot be happy unless they make Time present happy. And there is but one plan for that; I use Aglaia's words: '_To like every thing you do, and like to be always doing something_.'\"  Ambrosia ceased speaking, and the circled group were silent too. They were not satisfied, however; but those sweet, airy people take nothing to heart for long. For a short time they wandered about in little knots of two and three, talking, and then joined together in a dance and song, ere night surrounded them. There was from that time, however, a general understanding among them that the human race was too coarse and common to have much sympathy with Fairies, and even the Godmothers agreed to this, for they were sadly tired with the unusual quantity of thinking and observing they had had to undergo. So if you ever wonder, dear Readers, that Fairy Gifts and Fairy Godmothers have gone out of fashion; you may conclude that the adventure of Ambrosia and Hermione is the reason.         *       *       *       *       *  The story is ended; and if any enquiring child should say, \"There are no more Fairy gifts, and we can no more give ourselves love of employment than beauty or riches;\" let me correct this dangerous error! Wiser heads than mine have shown that every thing we do becomes by HABIT, not only _easy_, but actually _agreeable_.[4]  [4] Abercrombie. Moral Feelings.  Dear Children! encourage a habit of _attention_ to whatever you undertake, and you may make that habit not only easy, but agreeable; and then, I will venture to promise you, you will _like_ and even _love_ your occupations. And thus, though you may not have so many talents as Hermione, you may call all those you do possess, into play, and make them the solace, pleasure and resources of your earthly career.  If you do this, I think you will not feel disposed to quarrel, as the Fairies did, with Ambrosia's gift; for increased knowledge of the world, and your own happy experience, will convince you more and more that no Fairy Gift is so well worth having, as,  THE LOVE OF EMPLOYMENT.     JOACHIM THE MIMIC.   There was, once upon a time, a little boy, who, living in the time when Genies and Fairies used now and then to appear, had all the advantage of occasionally seeing wonderful sights, and all the _dis_advantage of being occasionally dreadfully frightened. This little boy was one day walking alone by the sea side, for he lived in a fishing town, and as he was watching the tide, he perceived a bottle driven ashore by one of the big waves. He rushed forward to catch it before the wave sucked it back again, and succeeded. Now then he was quite delighted, but he could not get the cork out, for it was fastened down with rosin, and there was a seal on the top. So being very impatient, he took a stone and knocked the neck of the bottle off.  What was his surprize to find himself instantly suffocated with a smoke that made his eyes smart and his nose sneeze, just as much as if a quantity of Scotch snuff had been thrown over him! He jumped about and puffed a good deal, and was just beginning to cry, as a matter of course for a little boy when he is annoyed; when lo! and behold! he saw before him such an immense Genie, with black eyes and a long beard, that he forgot all about crying and began to shake with fear.  The Genie told him he need not be afraid, and desired him not to shake; for, said he, \"You have been of great use to me; a Genie, stronger than myself, had fastened me up in yonder bottle in a fit of ill humour, and as he had put his seal at the top, nobody could draw the cork. Luckily for me, you broke the neck of the bottle, and I am free. Tell me therefore, good little boy, what shall I do for you to show my gratitude?\"  But now, before I go on with this, I must tell you that the day before the little boy's adventure with the bottle and the Genie, the King of that country had come to the fishing town I spoke of, in a gold chariot drawn by twelve beautiful jet black horses, and attended by a large train of officers and followers. A herald went before announcing that the King was visiting the towns of his dominions, for the sole purpose of doing justice and exercising acts of charity and kindness. And all people in trouble and distress were invited to come and lay their complaints before him. And accordingly they did so, and the good King, though quite a youth, devoted the whole day to the benevolent purpose he proposed; and it is impossible to describe the amount of good he accomplished in that short time. Among others who benefited was our little boy's Mother, a widow who had been much injured and oppressed. He redressed her grievances, and in addition to this, bestowed valuable and useful presents upon her. \"Look what an example the young King sets,\" was the cry on every side! \"Oh, my son, imitate him!\" exclaimed our poor Widow, as in a transport of joy and emotion, she threw her arms around her boy's neck. \"I wish I _could_ imitate him and be like him!\" murmured little Joachim: (such was the child's name). \"My boy,\" cried the Widow, \"imitate every thing that is good, and noble, and virtuous, and you _will_ be like him!\" Joachim looked earnestly in her face, but was silent. He understood a good deal that his Mother meant; he knew he was to try to do every thing that was good, and so be like the young King; but, as he was but a little boy, I am not quite sure that he had not got a sort of vague notion of the gold chariot and the twelve jet black horses, mixed up with his idea of imitating all that was good and noble and virtuous, and being like the young King. I may be wrong; but, at seven years old, you will excuse him if his head did get a little confused, and if he could not quite separate his ideas of excessive virtue and goodness from all the splendour in which the pattern he was to imitate appeared before his eyes.  However that may be, his Mother's words made a profound impression upon him. He thought of nothing else, and if he had been in the silly habit of telling his dreams, I dare say he would have told his mother next morning that he had been dreaming of them. Certainly they came into his head the first thing in the morning; and they were still in his head when he walked along by the sea-shore, as has been described; so much so, that even his adventure did not make him forget them; and therefore, when this Genie, as I told you before, offered to do any thing he wanted, little Joachim said, \"Genie, I want to imitate every thing that is good, and noble, and virtuous, so you must make me able!\"  The Genie looked very much surprized, and rather confused; he expected to have been asked for toys, or money, or a new horse, or something nice of that sort; but Joachim looked very grave, so the Genie saw he was in earnest, and he did a most wonderful thing for a Genie; he actually sat down beside the little boy to talk to him. I don't recollect that a single Genie in the Arabian Nights, ever did such a thing before; but this Genie did: What is more, he stroked his beard, and spoke very softly, as follows:  \"My dear little boy, you have asked a great thing. I can do part of what you wish, but not all; for you have asked what concerns the heart and conscience, and we Genies, cannot influence these, for the great Ruler of all things alone has them under his control. He allows us, however, power over the intellect--ah! now I see you cannot understand me, little boy!--Well! I mean this;--I can make your head clever, but I cannot make your heart good: I can give you the power of imitation, but as to _what_ you imitate, that must depend upon yourself, and the great Being I dare not name!\"  After saying this, the Genie laid his immense"]]]
