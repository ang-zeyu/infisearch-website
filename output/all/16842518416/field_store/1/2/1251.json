We can't do much planning about the new garden until we go out in a body and make our decisions on the spot,\" said Margaret. \"We'll have to put in vegetables and flowers where they'd rather grow.\"  \"That's what we're trying to do here, only it's on a small scale,\" Roger reminded her. \"Our whole garden is about a twentieth of the new one.\"  \"I shouldn't wonder if we had to have some expert help with that,\" guessed James, who had gardened enough at Glen Point not to be ashamed to confess ignorance now and then.  \"Mr. Emerson has promised to talk it all over with me,\" said Dorothy.  \"Let's see what there is at Dorothy's present abode, then,\" said Roger gayly, and he took another sheet of brown paper and began to place on it the position of the house and the existing borders. \"Do I understand, madam, that you're going to have a pink border here?\"  \"I am,\" replied his cousin firmly, \"both here and at the new place.\"  \"Life will take on a rosy hue for these young people if they can make it,\" commented Della. \"Pink flowers, a pink room--is there anything else pink?\"  \"The name. Mother and I have decided on 'Sweetbrier Lodge.' Don't you think it's pretty?\"  \"Dandy,\" approved Roger concisely, as he continued to draw. \"Do you want to change any of the beds that were here last summer?\" he asked.  \"Mother said she liked their positions very well. This long, narrow one in front of the house is to be the pink one. I've got pink tulip bulbs in the ground now and there are some pink flowering shrubs--weigelia and flowering almond--already there against the lattice of the veranda. I'm going to work out a list of plants that will keep a pink bed blossoming all summer and we can use it in three places,\" and she nodded dreamily to her cousins.  \"We'll do that, but I think it would be fun if each one of us tried out a new plant of some kind. Then we can find out which are most suitable for our needs next year. We can report on them to the Club when they come into bloom. It will save a lot of trouble if we tell what we've found out about what some plant likes in the way of soil and position and water and whether it is best to cut it back or to let it bloom all it wants to, and so on.\"  \"That's a good idea. I hope Secretary Ethel Blue is taking notes of all these suggestions,\" remarked Helen, who was the president of the Club.  Ethel Blue said she was, and Roger complimented her faithfulness in terms of extravagant absurdity.  \"Your present lot of land has the best looking fencing in Rosemont, to my way of thinking,\" approved Tom.  \"What is it? I hardly remember myself,\" said Dorothy thoughtfully.  \"Why, across the front there's a privet hedge, clipped low enough for your pink garden to be seen over it; and separating you from the Clarks' is a row of tall, thick hydrangea bushes that are beauties as long as there are any leaves on them; and at the back there is osage orange to shut out that old dump; and on the other side is a row of small blue spruces.\"  \"That's quite a showing of hedges all in one yard.\" exclaimed Ethel Blue admiringly. \"And I never noticed them at all!\"  \"At the new place Mother wants to try a barberry hedge. It doesn't grow regularly, but each bush is handsome in itself because the branches droop gracefully, and the leaves are a good green and the clusters of red berries are striking.\"  \"The leaves turn red in the autumn and the whole effect is stunning,\" contributed Della. \"I saw one once in New England. They aren't usual about here, and I should think it would be a beauty.\"  \"You can let it grow as tall as you like,\" said James. \"Your house is going to be above it on the knoll and look right over it, so you don't need a low hedge or even a clipped one.\"  \"At the side and anywhere else where she thinks there ought to be a real fence she's going to put honey locust.\"  They all laughed.  \"That spiny affair _will_ be discouraging to visitors!\" Helen exclaimed. \"Why don't you try hedges of gooseberries and currants and raspberries and blackberries around your garden?\"  \"That would be killing two birds with one stone, wouldn't it!\"  \"You'll have a real problem in landscape gardening over there,\" said Margaret.  \"The architect of the house will help on that. That is, he and Mother will decide exactly where the house is to be placed and how the driveway is to run.\"  \"There ought to be some shrubs climbing up the knoll,\" advised Ethel Brown. \"They'll look well below the house and they'll keep the bank from washing. I noticed this afternoon that the rains had been rather hard on it.\"  \"There are a lot of lovely shrubs you can put in just as soon as you're sure the workmen won't tramp them all down,\" cried Ethel Blue eagerly. \"That's one thing I do know about because I went with Aunt Marion last year when she ordered some new bushes for our front yard.\"  \"Recite your lesson, kid,\" commanded Roger briefly.  \"There is the weigelia that Dorothy has in front of this house; and forsythia--we forced its yellow blossoms last week, you know; and the flowering almond--that has whitey-pinky-buttony blossoms.\"  They laughed at Ethel's description, but they listened attentively while she described the spiky white blossoms of deutzia and the winding white bands of the spiraea--bridal wreath.  \"I can see that bank with those white shrubs all in blossom, leaning toward the road and beckoning you in,\" Ethel ended enthusiastically.  \"I seem to see them myself,\" remarked Tom, \"and Dorothy can be sure that they won't beckon in vain.\"  \"You'll all be as welcome as daylight,\" cried Dorothy.  \"I hate to say anything that sounds like putting a damper on this outburst of imagination that Ethel Blue has just treated us to, but I'd like to inquire of Miss Smith whether she has any gardening tools,\" said Roger, bringing them all to the ground with a bump.  \"Miss Smith hasn't one,\" returned Dorothy, laughing. \"You forget that we only moved in here last September and there hasn't been need for any that we couldn't borrow of you.\"  [Illustration: Gardening Tools]  \"You're perfectly welcome to them,\" answered Roger, \"but if we're all going to do the gardening act there'll be a scarcity if we don't add to the number.\"  \"What do we need?\"  \"A rake and a hoe and a claw and a trowel and a spade and a heavy line with some pegs to do marking with.\"  \"We've found that it's a comfort to your back to have another claw mounted on the end of a handle as long as a hoe,\" contributed Margaret.  \"Two claws,\" Dorothy amended her list, isn't many.\"  \"And a lot of dibbles.\"  \"Dibbles!\"  \"Short flat sticks whittled to a point. You use them when you're changing little plants from the to the hot bed or the hot bed to the garden.\"  \"Mother and I ought to have one set of tools here and one set at Sweetbrier Lodge,\" decided Dorothy.  \"We keep ours in the shed. I'm going to whitewash the corner where they belong and make it look as fine as a fiddle before the time comes to use them.\"  \"We have a shed here where we can keep them but at Sweetbrier there isn't anything,\" and Dorothy's mouth dropped anxiously.  \"We can build you a tool house,\" Tom was offering when James interrupted him.  \"If we can get a piano box there's your toolhouse all made,\" he suggested. \"Cover it with tar paper so the rain won't come in, and hang the front on hinges with a hasp and staple and padlock, and what better would you want?\"  \"Nothing,\" answered Ethel Brown, seriously. Ethel Blue noted it down in her book and Roger promised to visit the local piano man and see what he could find.  \"We haven't finished deciding how we shall plant Dorothy's yard behind this house,\" Margaret reminded them.  \"We shan't attempt a vegetable garden here,\" Dorothy said. \"We'll start one at the other place so that the soil will be in good condition next year. We'll have a man to do the heavy work of the two places, he can bring over every morning whatever vegetables are ready for the day's use.\"  \"You want more flowers in this yard, then?\"  \"You'll laugh at what I want!\"  \"Don't you forget what you promithed me,\" piped up Dicky.  \"That's what I was going to tell them now. I've promised Dicky to plant a lot of sunflowers for his hens. He says Roger never has had space to plant enough for him.\"  \"True enough. Give him a big bed of them so he can have all the seeds he wants.\"  \"I'd like to have a wide strip across the back of the whole place, right in front of the osage orange hedge. They'll cover the lower part that's rather scraggly--then everywhere else I want nasturtiums, climbing and dwarf and every color under the sun.\"  \"That's a good choice for your yard because it's awfully stony and nasturtiums don't mind a little thing like that.\"  \"Then I want gourds over the trellis at the back door.\"  \"Gourds!\"  \"I saw them so much in the South that I want to try them. There's one shape that makes a splendid dipper when it's dried and you cut a hole in it; and there's another kind just the size of a hen's egg that I want for nest eggs for Dickey's hens; and there's the loofa full of fibre that you can use for a bath sponge; and there's a pear-shaped one striped green and yellow that Mother likes for a darning ball; and there's a sweet smelling one that is as fragrant as possible in your handkerchief case. There are some as big as buckets and some like base ball bats, but I don't care for those.\"  \"What a collection,\" applauded Ethel Brown.  \"Beside that my idea of Japanese morning glories and a hop vine for our kitchen regions has no value at all,\" smiled Helen.  \"I'm going to have hops wherever the vines can find a place to climb at Sweetbrier,\" Dorothy determined. \"I love a hop vine, and it grows on forever.\"  \"James and I seem to be in the same condition. If we don't start"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11660"],["title","Ethel Morton's Enterprise (#7)"],["body","we'll go on talking forever,\" Margaret complained humorously.  \"There's to be hot chocolate for us down stairs at half past four,\" said Dorothy, jumping up and looking at a clock that was ticking industriously on a shelf. \"Let's go down and get it, and we'll ask Mother to sing the funny old song of 'The Four Seasons' for us.\"  \"Why is it funny?\" asked Ethel Blue.  \"It's a very old English song with queer spelling.\"  \"Something like mine?\" demanded Della.  Ethel Blue kissed her.  \"Never mind; Shakspere spelled his name in several different ways,\" she said encouragingly, \"Anyway, we can't tell how this is spelled when Aunt Louise sings it.\"  As they sat about the fire in the twilight drinking their chocolate and eating sandwiches made of nuts ground fine, mixed with mayonnaise and put on a crisp lettuce leaf between slices of whole wheat bread, Mrs. Smith sang the old English song to them.      \"Springe is ycomen in,     Dappled lark singe;       Snow melteth,       Runnell pelteth,     Smelleth winde of newe buddinge.      \"Summer is ycomen in,     Loude singe cucku;       Groweth seede,       Bloweth meade,     And springeth the weede newe.      \"Autumne is ycomen in,     Ceres filleth horne;       Reaper swinketh,       Farmer drinketh,     Creaketh waine with newe corn.      \"Winter is ycomen in,     With stormy sadde cheere;       In the paddocke,       Whistle ruddock,     Brighte sparke in the dead yeare.\"  \"That's a good stanza to end with,\" said Ethel Blue, as she bade her aunt \"Good-bye.\" \"We've been talking about gardens and plants and flowers all the afternoon, and it would have seemed queer to put on a heavy coat to go home in if you hadn't said 'Winter is ycomen in.'\"     CHAPTER V   A DEFECT IN THE TITLE  In spite of their having made such an early start in talking about gardens the members of the United Service Club did not weary of the idea or cease to plan for what they were going to do. The only drawback that they found in gardening as a Club activity was that the gardens were for themselves and their families and they did not see exactly how there was any \"service\" in them.  \"I'll trust you youngsters to do some good work for somebody in connection with them,\" asserted Grandfather Emerson one day when Roger had been talking over with him his pet plan for remodelling the old Emerson farmhouse into a place suitable for the summer shelter of poor women and children from the city who needed country air and relief from hunger and anxiety.  \"We aren't rushing anything now,\" Roger had explained, \"because we boys are all going to graduate this June and we have our examinations to think about. They must come first with us. But later on we'll be ready for work of some sort and we haven't anything on the carpet except our gardens.\"  \"There are many good works to be done with the help of a garden,\" replied Mr. Emerson. \"Ask your grandmother to tell you how she has sent flowers into New York for the poor for many, many summers. There are people right here in Rosemont who haven't enough ground to raise any vegetables and they are glad to have fresh corn and Brussels sprouts sent to them. If you really do undertake this farmhouse scheme there'll have to be a large vegetable garden planted near the house to supply it, and you can add a few flower beds. The old place will look better flower-dressed than empty, and perhaps some of the women and children will like to work in the garden.\"  Roger went home comforted, for he was very loyal to the Club and its work and he did not want to become so involved with other matters that he could not give himself to the purpose for which the Club was organized--helping others.  As he passed the Miss Clarks he stopped to give their furnace its nightly shaking, for he was the accredited furnace man for them and his Aunt Louise as well as for his mother. He added the money that he earned to the treasury of the Club so that there might always be enough there to do a kind act whenever there should be a chance.  As he labored with the shaker and the noise of his struggles was sent upward through the registers a voice called to him down the cellar stairs.  \"Ro-ger; Roger!\"  \"Yes, ma'am,\" replied Roger, wishing the old ladies would let him alone until he had finished his work.  \"Come up here, please, when you've done.\"  \"Very well,\" he agreed, and went on with his racket.  When he went upstairs he found that the cause of his summons was the arrival of a young man who was apparently about the age of Edward Watkins, the doctor brother of Tom and Della.  \"My nephew is a law student,\" said Miss Clark as she introduced the two young people, \"and I want him to know all of our neighbors.\"  \"My name is Stanley Clark,\" said the newcomer, shaking hands cordially. \"I'm going to be here for a long time so I hope I'll see you often.\"  Roger liked him at once and thought his manner particularly pleasant in view of the fact that he was several years older. Roger was so accustomed to the companionship of Edward Watkins, who frequently joined the Club in their festivities and who often came to Rosemont to call on Miss Merriam, that the difference did not seem to him a cause of embarrassment. He was unusually easy for a boy of his age because he had always been accustomed to take his sailor father's place at home in the entertainment of his mother's guests.  Young Clark, on his side, found his new acquaintance a boy worth talking to, and they got on well. He was studying at a law school in the city, it seemed, and commuted every day.  \"It's a long ride,\" he agreed when Roger suggested it, \"but when I get home I have the good country air to breathe and I'd rather have that than town amusements just now when I'm working hard.\"  Roger spoke of Edward Watkins and Stanley was interested in the possibility of meeting him. Evidently his aunts had told him all about the Belgian baby and Miss Merriam, for he said Elisabeth would be the nearest approach to a soldier from a Belgian battlefield that he had seen.  Roger left with the feeling that his new acquaintance would be a desirable addition to the neighborhood group and he was so pleased that he stopped in at his Aunt Louise's not only to shake the furnace but to tell her about Stanley Clark.  [Illustration: The Hot Bed]  During the next month they all came to know him well and they liked his cheerfulness and his interest in what they were doing and planning. On Saturdays he helped Roger build a hot bed in the sunniest spot against the side of the kitchen ell. They found that the frost had not stiffened the ground after they managed to dig down a foot, so that the excavation was not as hard as they had expected. They dug a hole the size of two window sashes and four feet deep, lining the sides with some old bricks that they found in the cellar. At first they filled the entire bed with fresh stable manure and straw. After it had stayed under the glass two days it was quite hot and they beat it down a foot and put on six inches of soil made one-half of compost and one-half of leaf mould that they found in a sheltered corner of the West Woods.  \"Grandfather didn't believe we could manage to get good soil at this season even if we did succeed in digging the hole, but when I make up my mind to do a thing I like to succeed,\" said Roger triumphantly when they had fitted the sashes on to planks that sloped at the sides so that rain would run off the glass, and called the girls out to admire their result.  \"What are we going to put in here first?\" asked Ethel Brown, who liked to get at the practical side of matters at once.  \"I'd like to have some violets,\" said Ethel Blue. \"Could I have a corner for them? I've had some plants promised me from the Glen Point greenhouse man. Margaret is going to bring them over as soon as I'm ready for them.\"  \"I want to see if I can beat Dicky with early vegetables,\" declared Roger. \"I'm going to start early parsley and cabbage and lettuce, cauliflower and egg plants, radishes and peas and corn in shallow boxes--flats Grandfather says they're called--in my room and the kitchen where it's warm and sunny, and when they've sprouted three leaves I'll set them out here and plant some more in the flats.\"  \"Won't transplanting them twice set them back?\"  \"If you take up enough earth around them they ought not to know that they've taken a journey.\"  \"I've done a lot of transplanting of wild plants from the woods,\" said Stanley, \"and I found that if I was careful to do that they didn't even wilt.\"  \"Why can't we start some of the flower seeds here and have early blossoms?\"  \"You can. I don't see why we can't keep it going all the time and have a constant supply of flowers and vegetables earlier than we should if we trusted to Mother Nature to do the work unaided.\"  \"Then in the autumn we can stow away here some of the plants we want to save, geraniums and begonias, and plants that are pretty indoors, and take them into the house when the indoor ones become shabby.\"  \"Evidently right in the heart of summer is the only time this article won't be in use,\" decided Stanley, laughing at their eagerness. \"Have you got anything to cover it with when the spring sunshine grows too hot?\"  \"There is an old hemp rug and some straw matting in the attic--won't they do?\"  \"Perfectly. Lay them over the glass so that the delicate little plants won't get burned. You can raise the sashes, too.\"  \"If we don't forget to close them before the sun sets and the night chill comes on, I suppose,\" smiled Ethel Blue. \"Mr. Emerson says that seeds under glass do better if they're covered with newspaper until they start.\"  It was about the middle of March when Mrs. Smith went in to call on her neighbors, the Miss Clarks, one evening. They were at home and after a talk on the ever-absorbing theme of the war Mrs. Smith said,  \"I really came in here on business. I hope you've decided to sell me the meadow lot next to my knoll.
