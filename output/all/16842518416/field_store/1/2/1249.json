That's a rather long undertaking and it's hard unless you have a very, very sharp knife.\"  \"I've discovered that in preparing them for breakfast.\"  \"The fruit are of such different sizes that you have to weigh the result of your paring. To every pound of cut-up fruit add a pint of water and let it stand over night. In the morning pour off that water and fill the kettle again and let it boil until the toughest bit of skin is soft, and then let it stand over night more.\"  \"It seems to do an awful lot of resting,\" remarked Roger.  \"A sort of 'weary Willie,'\" commented James.  \"When you're ready to go at it again, you weigh it once more and add four times as many pounds of sugar as you have fruit.\"  \"You must have to make it in a wash-boiler!\"  \"Not quite as bad as that, but you'll be surprised to find how much three or four grapefruit will make. You boil this together until it is as thick as you like to have your marmalade.\"  \"I can recommend Aunt Louise's marmalade,\" said Ethel Brown. \"It's the very best I ever tasted. She taught me to make these grapefruit chips,\" and she handed about a bonbon dish laden with delicate strips of sugared peel.  \"Let's have this receipt, too,\" begged Margaret, as Roger went to answer the telephone.  \"You can squeeze out the juice and pulp and add a quart of water to a cup of juice, sweeten it and make grapefruit-ade instead of lemonade for a variety. Then take the skins and cut out all the white inside part as well as you can, leaving just the rind.\"  \"The next step must be to snip the rind into these long, narrow shavings.\"  \"It is, and you put them in cold water and let them come to a boil and boil twenty minutes. Then drain off all the water and add cold water and do it again.\"  \"What's the idea of two boilings?\" asked James.  \"I suppose it must be to take all the bitterness out of the skin at the same time that it is getting soft.\"  \"Does this have to stand over night?\"  \"Yes, this sits and meditates all night. Then you put it on to boil again in a syrup made of one cup of water and four cups of sugar, and boil it until the bits are all saturated with the sweetness. If you want to eat them right off you roll them now in powdered sugar or confectioner's sugar, but if you aren't in a hurry you put them into a jar and keep the air out and roll them just before you want to serve them.\"  \"They certainly are bully good,\" remarked James, taking several more pieces.  \"That call was from Tom Watkins,\" announced Roger, returning from the telephone, and referring to a member of the United Service Club who, with his sister, Della, lived in New York.  \"O dear, they can't come!\" prophesied Ethel Blue.  \"He says he has just been telephoning to the railroad and they say that all the New Jersey trains are delayed and so Mrs. Watkins thought he'd better not try to bring Della out. She sends her love to you, Ethel Blue, and her best wishes for your birthday and says she's got a present for you that is different from any plant you ever saw in a conservatory.\"  \"That's what Margaret's is,\" laughed Ethel. \"Isn't it queer you two girls should give me growing things when we were talking about gardens this afternoon and deciding to have one this summer.\"  \"One!\" repeated Dorothy. \"Don't forget mine. There'll be two.\"  \"If Aunt Louise should find a lot and start to build there'd be another,\" suggested Ethel Brown.  \"O, let's go into the gardening business,\" cried Roger. \"I've already offered to be the laboring man at the beck and call of these young women all for the small reward of having all the sweetpeas I want to pick.\"  \"What we're afraid of is that he won't want to pick them,\" laughed Ethel Brown. \"We're thinking of binding him to do a certain amount of picking every day.\"  \"Anyway, the Morton-Smith families are going to have gardens and Helen is going to write for seed catalogues this very night before she seeks her downy couch--she has vowed she will.\"  \"Mother has always had a successful garden, she'll be able to give you advice,\" offered Margaret.  \"We'll ask it from every one we know, I rather imagine,\" and Dorothy beamed at the prospect of doing something that had been one of her great desires all her life.  The little thicket of grapefruit trees served as the centrepiece of Ethel Blue's dinner table, and every one admired all over again its glossy leaves and sturdy stems.  \"When spring comes we'll set them out in the garden and see what happens,\" promised Ethel Blue.  \"We have grapefruit salad to-night. You must have sent a wireless over to the kitchen,\" Ethel Brown declared to Margaret.  It was a delicious salad, the cubes of the grapefruit being mixed with cubes of apple and of celery, garnished with cherries and served on crisp yellow-green lettuce leaves with French dressing.  Ethel Blue always liked to see her Aunt Marion make French dressing at the table, for her white hands moved swiftly and skilfully among the ingredients. Mary brought her a bowl that had been chilled on ice. Into it she poured four tablespoonfuls of olive oil, added a scant half teaspoonful of salt with a dash of red pepper which she stirred until the salt was dissolved. To that combination she added one tablespoonful either of lemon juice or vinegar a drop at a time and stirring constantly so that the oil might take up its sharper neighbor.  Dorothy particularly approved her Aunt Marion's manner of putting her salads together. To-night, for instance, she did not have the plates brought in from the kitchen with the salad already upon them.  \"That always reminds me of a church fair,\" she declared.  She was willing to give herself the trouble of preparing the salad for her family and guests with her own hands. From a bowl of lettuce she selected the choicest leaves for the plate before her; upon these she placed the fruit and celery mixture, dotted the top with a cherry and poured the dressing over all. It was fascinating to watch her, and Margaret wished that her mother served salad that way.  The Club was indeed incomplete without the Watkinses, but the members nevertheless were sufficiently amused by several of the \"Does\"--things to do--that one or another suggested. First they did shadow drawings. The dining table proved to be the most convenient spot for that. They all sat around under the strong electric light. Each had a block of rather heavy paper with a rough surface, and each was given a camel's hair brush, a bottle of ink, some water and a small saucer. From a vase of flowers and leaves and ferns which Mrs. Morton contributed to the game each selected what he wanted to draw. Then, holding his leaf so that the light threw a sharp shadow upon his pad, he quickly painted the shadow with the ink, thinning it with water upon the saucer so that the finished painting showed several shades of gray.  \"The beauty of this stunt is that a fellow who can't draw at all can turn out almost as good a masterpiece as Ethel Blue here, who has the makings of a real artist,\" and James gazed at his production with every evidence of satisfaction.  As it happened none of them except Ethel Blue could draw at all well, so that the next game had especial difficulties.  \"All there is to it is to draw something and let us guess what it is,\" said Ethel Blue.  \"You haven't given all the rules,\" corrected Roger. \"Ethel Blue makes two dots on a piece of paper--or a short line and a curve--anything she feels like making. Then we copy them and draw something that will include those two marks and she sits up and 'ha-has' and guesses what it is.\"  \"I promise not to laugh,\" said Ethel Blue.  \"Don't make any such rash promise,\" urged Helen. \"You might do yourself an injury trying not to when you see mine.\"  It was fortunate for Ethel Blue that she was released from the promise, for her guesses went wide of the mark. Ethel Brown made something that she guessed to be a hen, Roger called it a book, Dicky maintained firmly that it was a portrait of himself. The rest gave it up, and they all needed a long argument by the artist to believe that she had meant to draw a pair of candlesticks.  \"Somebody think of a game where Ethel Brown can do herself justice,\" cried James, but no one seemed to have any inspiration, so they all went to the fire, where they cracked nuts and told stories.  \"If you'll write those orders for the seed catalogues I'll post them to-night,\" James suggested to Helen.  \"Oh, will you? Margaret and I will write them together.\"  \"What's the rush?\" demanded Roger. \"This is only January.\"  \"I know just how the girls feel,\" sympathized James. \"When I make up my mind to do a thing I want to begin right off, and the first step of this new scheme is to get the catalogues hereinbefore mentioned.\"  \"We can plan out our back yards any time, I should think,\" said Dorothy.  \"Father says that somebody--was it Bacon, Margaret?--says that a man's nature runs always either to herbs or to weeds. Let's start ours running to herbs in the first month of the year and perhaps by the time the herbs appear we'll catch up with them.\"     CHAPTER III   DOROTHY TELLS HER SECRET  \"How queer it is that when you're interested in something you keep seeing and hearing things connected with it!\" exclaimed Ethel Blue about a week after her birthday, when Della Watkins came out from town to bring her her belated birthday gift.  The present proved to be a slender hillock covered with a silky green growth exquisite in texture and color.  \"What is it? What is it?\" cried Ethel Blue. \"We mentioned plants and gardens on my birthday and that very evening Margaret brought me this grapefruit jungle and now you've brought me this. Do tell me exactly what it is.\"  \"A cone, child. That's all. A Norway spruce cone. When it is dry its scales are open. I filled them with grass seed and put the cone in a small tumbler so that the lower end might be damp"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11660"],["title","Ethel Morton's Enterprise (#3)"],["body","the time. The dampness makes the scales close and starts the seed to sprouting. This has been growing a few days and the cone is almost hidden.\"  \"It's one of the prettiest plants--would you call it a plant or a greenhouse?--I ever saw. Does it have to be a Norway spruce cone?\"  \"O, no. Only they have very regular scales that hold the seed well. I brought you out two more of them and some grass seed and canary seed so you could try it for yourself.\"  \"You're a perfect duck,\" and Ethel gave her friend a hug. \"Now let me show you what one of the girls at school gave Ethel Brown.\"  She indicated a strange-looking brown object hanging before the window.  \"What in the world is it? It looks--yes, it looks like a sweet potato.\"  \"That's what it is--a sweet potato with one end cut off and a cage of tape to hold it. You see it's sprouting already, and they say that the vines hang down from it and it looks like a little green hanging basket.\"  \"What's the object of cutting off the end?\"  \"Anna--that's Ethel Brown's friend--said that she scooped hers out just a little bit and put a few drops of water inside so that the sun shouldn't dry it too much.\"  \"I should think it would grow better in a dark place. Don't you know how Irish potatoes send out those white shoots when they're in the cellar?\"  \"She said she started hers in the cellar and then brought them into the light.\"  \"Just like bulbs.\"  \"Exactly. Aunt Louise is having great luck with her bulbs now. She had them in the cellar and now she is bringing them out a pot at a time, so she has something new coming forward every few days.\"  \"Dorothy doesn't care much for bulbs, but I think it's pretty good fun. You can make them blossom just about when you please by keeping them in the dark or bringing them into the light. I'm going to ask Aunt Louise to give me some of hers when they're finished flowering. She says you can plant them out of doors and next year they'll bloom in the garden.\"  \"Mother has some this winter, too. I'll ask her for them after she's through forcing them.\"  \"I like them in the garden, too--tulips and hyacinths and daffodils and narcissus and, jonquils. They come so early and give you a feeling that spring really has arrived.\"  \"You look as if spring had really arrived in the house here. If there wasn't a little bit of that snow man left in front I shouldn't know it had snowed last week. How in the world did you get all these shrubs to blossom now? They don't seem to realize that it's only January.\"  \"That's another thing that's happened since my birthday. Margaret told us about bringing branches of the spring shrubs into the house and making them come out in water, so we've been trying it. She sent over those yellow bells, the Forsythia, and Roger brought in the pussy willows from the brook on the way to Mr. Emerson's.\"  \"This thorny red affair is the Japan quince, but I don't recognize these others.\"  \"That's because you're a city girl! You'll laugh when I tell you what they are.\"  \"They don't look like flowering shrubs to me.\"  \"They aren't. They're flowering trees; fruit trees!\"  \"O-o! That really is a peach blossom, then!\"  \"The deep pink is peach, and the delicate pink is apple and the white is plum.\"  \"They're perfectly dear. Tell me how you coaxed them out. Surely you didn't just keep them in water in this room?\"  \"We put them in the sunniest window we had, not too near the glass, because it wouldn't do for them to run any chance of getting chilled. They stayed there as long as the sun did, and then we moved them to another warm spot and we were very careful about them at night.\"  \"How often do you change the water?\"  \"Every two or three days; and once in a while we spray them to keep the upper part fresh--and there you are. It's _fun_ to watch them come out. Don't want to take some switches back to town with you?\"  Della did.  \"They make me think of a scheme that my Aunt Rose is putting into operation. She went round the world year before last,\" she said, \"and she saw in Japan lots of plants growing in earthenware vases hanging against the wall or in a long bamboo cut so that small water bottles might be slipped in. She has some of the very prettiest wall decorations now--a queer looking greeny-brown pottery vase has two or three sprigs of English ivy. Another with orange tints has nasturtiums and another tradescantia.\"  \"Are they growing in water?\"  \"The ivy and the tradescantia are, but the nasturtiums and a perfectly darling morning glory have earth. She's growing bulbs in them, too, only she doesn't use plain water or earth, just bulb fibre.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"Why, bulbs are such fat creatures that they don't need the outside food they would get from earth; all they want is plenty of water. This fibre stuff holds enough water to keep them damp all the time, and it isn't messy in the house like dirt.\"  \"What are you girls talking about?\" asked Dorothy, who came in with Ethel Brown at this moment.  Both of them were interested in the addition that Della had made to their knowledge of flowers and gardening.  \"Every day I feel myself drawn into more and more gardening,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I've set up a notebook already.\"  \"In January!\" laughed Della.  \"January seems to be the time to do your thinking and planning; that's what the people who know tell me.\"  \"It seems to be the time for some action,\" retorted Della, waving her hand at the blossoming branches about the room.  \"Aren't they wonderful? I always knew you could bring them out quickly in the house after the buds were started out of doors, but these fellows didn't seem to be started at all--and look at them!\"  \"Mother says they've done so well because we've been careful to keep them evenly warm,\" said Ethel Brown. \"Dorothy's got the finest piece of news to tell you. If she doesn't tell you pretty soon I shall come out with it myself!\"  \"O, let her tell her own secret!\" remonstrated Blue. \"What is it?\"  You know that sloping piece of ground about a quarter of a mile beyond the Clarks' on the road to Mr. Emerson's?\"  \"You don't mean the field with the brook where Roger got the pussy willows?\"  \"This side of it. There's a lovely view across the meadows on the other side of the road, and the land runs back to some rocks and big trees.\"  \"Certainly I know it,\" assented Ethel Blue. \"There's a hillock on it that's the place I've chosen for a house when I grow up and build one.\"  \"Well, you can't have it because I've got there first!\"  \"What do you mean? Has Aunt Louise--?\"  \"She has.\"  \"How grand! How _grand_! You'll be farther away from us than you are now but it's a dear duck of a spot--\"  \"And it's right on the way to Grandfather Emerson's,\" added Ethel Brown.  \"Mother signed the papers this morning and she's going to begin to build as soon as the weather will allow.\"  \"With peach trees in blossom now that ought not to be far off,\" laughed Della, waving her hand again at the blossoms that pleased her so much.  \"How large a house is she going to build?\" asked Ethel Blue.  \"Not very big. Large enough for her and me and a guest or two and of course Elisabeth and Miss Merriam,\" referring to a Belgian baby who had been brought to the United Service Club from war-stricken Belgium, and to her caretaker, a charming young woman from the School of Mothercraft.  \"Will it be made of concrete?\"  \"Yes, and Mother says we may all help a lot in making the plans and in deciding on the decoration and everything.\"  \"Isn't she the darling! It will be the next best thing to building a house yourself!\"  \"There will be a garage behind the house.\"  \"A garage! Is Aunt Louise going to set up a car?\"  \"Just a small one that she can drive herself. Back of the garage there's plenty of space for a garden and she says she'll turn that over to me. I can do anything I want with it as long as I'll be sure to have enough vegetables for the table and lots of flowers for the house.\"  \"O, my; O, my; what fun we'll have,\" ejaculated Della, who knew that Dorothy could have no pleasure that she would not share equally with the rest of the Club.  \"I came over now to see if you people didn't want to walk over there and see it.\"  \"This minute?\"  \"This minute.\"  \"Of course we do--if Della doesn't have to take the train back yet?\"  \"Not for a long time. I'd take a later one anyway; I couldn't wait until the Saturday Club meeting to see it.\"  \"How did you know I'd suggest a walk there for the Saturday Club meeting?\"  \"Could you help it?\" retorted Della, laughing.  They timed themselves so that they might know just how far away from them Dorothy was going to be and they found that it was just about half way to Grandfather Emerson's. As somebody from the Mortons' went there every day, and as the distance was, in reality, not long, they were reassured as to the Smiths being quite out in the country as the change had seemed to them at first.  \"You won't be able to live in the house this summer, will you?\" asked Ethel Blue.  \"Not until late in the summer or perhaps even later than that. Mother says she isn't in a hurry because she wants the work to be done well.\"  \"Then you won't plant the garden this year?\"  \"Indeed I shall. I'm going to plant the new garden and the garden where we are now.\"  \"Roger will strike on doing all the digging.\"  \"He'll have to have a helper on the new garden, but I'll plant his sweetpeas for him just the same. At the new place I'm going to have a large garden.\"  \"Up here on the hill?\"  The girls were climbing up the ascent that rose sharply from the road.  \"The house will perch on top of this little hill. Back of it, you see, on top of the ridge, it's quite flat and the garden will be there. I was talking about it with Mr. Emerson this morning--\"  \"Oho, you've called Grandfather into consultation already!\"  \"He's going to be our nearest neighbor on that side. He said that a ridge like this was one of the best places for planting because it has several exposures to the sun and you can find a spot to suit"]]]
