[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],["title","The Fern Lover's Companion (#5)"],["body","lip fern, known also as Fée's fern, is much the smallest of the lip ferns, averaging, Clute tells us, \"but two inches high.\" This is only one-third as tall as the woolly lip fern and need not be mistaken for it. The fronds form tangled mats difficult to unravel. It grows on dry rocks and cliffs--Illinois and Minnesota to British Columbia, and south to Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.  [Illustration: Pinnæ of Slender Lip Fern. _Cheilanthes Féei_ (From Waters's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]    5. CLOAK FERN. _Notholàena_  Small ferns with fruit-dots borne beneath the revolute margin of the pinnules, at first roundish, but soon confluent into a narrow band without indusium. Veins free. Fronds one to several times pinnate, the lower surface hairy, or tomentose or powdery. Includes about forty species, mostly American, but only one within our limits. (Greek name means _spurious cloak_, alluding to the rudimentary or counterfeit indusium.)  (1) POWDERY CLOAK FERN. _Notholàena dealbàta_  Fronds two to six inches long, triangular-ovate, acute, broadest at the base, tripinnate. Stalks tufted, wiry, shining, dark brown. Upper surface of the very small segments green, smooth, the lower densely coated with a pure, white powder; hence, the specific name _dealbata_, which means whitened. Sori brown at length; veins free.  There are several species of cloak ferns, but only one within our limits. The dry, white powder which covers them doubtless is designed to protect them from too rapid evaporation of moisture, as they all inhabit dry and sunny places. This delicate rock-loving fern is found in the clefts of dry limestone rocks in Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and southwestward.    THE CHAIN FERNS. _Woodwardia_  Large and somewhat coarse ferns of swampy woods with pinnate or nearly two-pinnate fronds, and oblong or linear fruit-dots, arranged in one or more chain-like rows, parallel to and near the midribs. Indusium fixed by its outer margin to a veinlet and opening on the inner side. In our section there are two species. (Named for Thomas J. Woodward, an English botanist.)  [Illustration: Powdery Cloak Fern. _Notholaena dealbata_ (Kansas) (G.E. Davenport)]  [Illustration: The Common Chain Fern. _Woodwardia virginica_]  (1) THE COMMON CHAIN FERN. _Woodwardia virgínica_  Sterile and fertile fronds similar in outline, two to four feet high, once pinnate, the pinnæ deeply incised with oblong segments. Fruit-dots oblong in chain-like rows along the midrib both of the pinnæ and the lobes, confluent when ripe. Veins forming narrow rows of net-like spaces (areoles) beneath the fruit-dots, thence free to the margin. The spores ripen in July.  The sterile fronds resemble those of the cinnamon fern, but the latter grow in crowns, with a single frond in the center, while the fronds of the chain fern rise singly from the creeping rootstock, which sends them up at intervals all summer. The sori are borne on the backs of fertile fronds. There are usually more sterile than fertile blades, especially in dense shade. We have waded repeatedly through a miry swamp in Melrose, Mass., where the wild calla flourishes along with the blueberry and other swamp bushes, and have found the chain fern in several shaded spots, but every frond was sterile. It is said that when exposed to the sun it always faces the south. Swamps, Maine to Florida, especially along the Atlantic Coast, and often in company with the narrow-leaved species.  [Illustration: Net-Veined Chain Fern. _Woodwardia areolata_ (Stratford, Conn.)]  (2) NET-VEINED CHAIN FERN  NARROW-LEAVED CHAIN FERN  _Woodwardia areolàta. W. angustifòlia_  Root stocks creeping and chaffy. Sterile and fertile fronds unlike; sterile ones nine to twelve inches tall, deltoid-ovate. Broadest at the base, with lanceolate, serrulate divisions united by a broad wing. Veins areolate; fertile fronds taller, twelve to twenty inches high with narrowly linear divisions, the areoles and fruit-dots in a single row each side of the secondary midrib, the latter sunk in the tissues.  This species is less common than the Virginia fern, but they often grow near each other. We have collected both in the Blue Hill reservation near Boston, and both have been found in Hingham, Medford, and Reading, and doubtless in other towns along the coast. Mrs. Parsons speaks of finding them in the flat, sandy country near Buzzard's Bay. The net-veined species has some resemblance to the sensitive fern, but in the latter the spore cases are shut up in small pods formed by the contracting and rolling up of the lobes, whereas the chain fern bears its sori on the under side of long, narrow pinnæ. Besides, the sterile fronds of the latter have serrulate segments. As in the sensitive fern there are many curious gradations between the fertile and sterile fronds, both in shape and fruitfulness. Waters calls them the \"_obtusilobàta_ form.\"  [Illustration: The Spleenworts 1. Narrow-leaved 2. Ebony 3. Rue 4. Scott's 5. Maidenhair 6. Green 7. Mountain]   THE SPLEENWORTS   A. THE ROCK SPLEENWORTS. _Asplènium_  Small, evergreen ferns. Fruit-dots oblong or linear, oblique, separate when young. Indusium straight or rarely curved, fixed lengthwise on the upper side of a fertile veinlet, opening toward the midrib. Veins free. Scales of rhizome and stipes narrow, of firm texture and with thick-walled cells.  (1) PINNÁTIFID SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium pinnatífídum_  Fronds four to six inches long, lanceolate, pinnátifid or pinnate near the base, tapering above into a slender prolongation. Lobes roundish-ovate, or the lower pair acuminate. Fruit-dots irregular, numerous. Stipes tufted, two to four inches long, brownish beneath, green above.  Although this fern, like all the small spleenworts, is heavily fruited, it is extremely rare. It is found as far north as Sharon, Conn., thence southward to Georgia, to Arkansas and Missouri. On cliffs and rocks. Resembles the walking fern, and its tip sometimes takes root.  (2) SCOTT'S SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium ebenòides_  Fronds four to ten inches long, broadly lanceolate, pinnátifid or pinnate below, tapering to a prolonged and slender apex. Divisions lanceolate from a broad base. Fruit-dots straight or slightly curved. Stipe and rachis brown.  [Illustration: Pinnatifid Spleenwort. _Asplenium pinnatifidum_ a, Small Plants from Harper's Ferry; b, Sori on Young Fronds (From Waters's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]  [Illustration: Scott's Spleenwort. _Asplenium ebenoides_ a, from Virginia; b, from Alabama; c, from Maryland (From Waters's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]  Resembles the last, and like that has been known to root at the tip. It is a hybrid between the walking fern and the ebony spleenwort, as proved by Miss Margaret Slosson, and may be looked for in the immediate vicinity of its parents. It was discovered by R.R. Scott, in 1862, at Manayunk, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia, and described by him in the Gardener's Monthly of September, 1865. Vermont to Alabama, Missouri, and southward. Rare, but said to be plentiful in a deep ravine near Havana, Ala.  [Illustration: Green Spleenwort. _Asplenium víride_]  (3) GREEN SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium víride_  Fronds two to ten inches long, linear, pinnate, pale green. Pinnæ roundish-ovate, crenate, with indistinct and forking midveins. Stalks tufted, short, brownish below, green above. Rachis green.  Discovered at Smuggler's Notch, Mt. Mansfield, Vt., by C.G. Pringle in 1876. Found sparingly at Willoughby Lake, high on the cliffs of Mt. Horr. This rare and delicate little plant bears a rather close resemblance to the maidenhair spleenwort, which, however, has dark stipes instead of green.  Northern New England, west and northwest on shaded limestone rocks.  [Illustration: Maidenhair Spleenwort. _Asplenium Trichomanes_]  (4) MAIDENHAIR SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium Trichómanes_  Stipes densely tufted, purple-brown, shining. Fronds three to eight inches long, linear, dark green, rather rigid. Pinnæ roundish-oblong or oval, entire or finely crenate, attached at the base by a narrow point. Midveins forking and evanescent.  Not very common, but distributed almost throughout North America. May be looked for wherever there are ledges, as it does not require limestone. July.  [Illustration: Maidenhair Spleenwort. _Asplenium Trichomanes_ (From Woolson's \"Ferns,\" Doubleday, Page & Co.)]  (5) SMALL SPLEENWORT  _Asplenium párvulum. A. resíliens_  Fronds four to ten inches tall, narrowly linear, rather firm, erect. Pinnæ opposite, oblong, entire or finely crenate, and auricled at the base. Stipes and rachis black and shining. Midveins continuous.  This small fern is a southern species half way between the maidenhair and ebony spleenworts, but rather more like the latter from which it differs in being smaller and thicker, and in having the fertile and sterile fronds of the same size. Mountains of Virginia to Kansas and southward.  (6) EBONY SPLEENWORT  _Asplenium platynèuron. A. ebèneum_  Fronds upright, eight to eighteen inches high, linear-lanceolate, the fertile ones much taller, and pinnate. Pinnæ scarcely an inch long, the lower ones very much shorter, alternate, spreading, finely serrate or incised, the base auricled. Sori numerous, rather near the midvein, stipe and rachis lustrous brown. (\"Ebony.\")  This rigidly upright but graceful fern flourishes in rocky, open woods, and on rich, moist banks, often in the neighborhood of red cedars. Having come upon it many times in our rambles, we should say it was not uncommon.  A lightly incised form of the pinnæ has been described as var. _serratum_. A handsome form discovered in Vermont in 1900 by Mrs. Horton and named _Hortonæ_ (also called _incisum_) has plume-like fronds with the pinnæ cut into oblique lobes, which are coarsely serrate.  [Illustration: Ebony Spleenwort. _Asplenium platyneuron_ (Melrose, Mass., G.E. Davenport)]  [Illustration: Bradley's Spleenwort. _Asplenium Bradleyi_ a, from Maryland; b, from Kentucky (From Waters's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],["title","The Fern Lover's Companion (#6)"],["body","  (7) BRADLEY'S SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium Brádleyi_  Fronds oblong-lanceolate, pinnate, three to ten inches long. Pinnæ oblong-ovate, obtuse, incised or pinnátifid into oblong, toothed lobes. The basal pinnæ have broad bases, and blunt tips and are slightly stalked. Stipes and rachis dark brown and the sori short, near the midrib.  A rare and beautiful fern growing on rocks preferring limestone and confined mostly to the southern states. Newburg, N.Y., to Kentucky and Alabama, westward to Arkansas.  (8) MOUNTAIN SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium montanum_  Fronds ovate-lanceolate from a broad base, two to eight inches long, somewhat leathery, pinnate. Pinnæ ovate-oblong, the lowest pinnately cleft into oblong or ovate cut-toothed lobes, the upper ones less and less divided. Rachis green, broad, and flat.  [Illustration: Mountain Spleenwort (From the \"Fern Bulletin\")]  Small evergreen ferns of a bluish-green color, growing in the crevices of rocks and cliffs. Connecticut to Ohio, Kentucky, Arkansas and southwest. July. Rare. Williams, in his \"Ferns of Kentucky,\" says of this species, \"Common on all sandstone cliffs and specimens are large on sheltered rocks by the banks of streams.\"  (9) RUE SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium Ruta-murària_  Fronds evergreen, small, two to seven inches long, deltoid-ovate, two to three pinnate below, simply pinnate above, rather leathery in texture. Divisions few, stalked, from cuneate to roundish-ovate, toothed or incised at the apex. Veins forking. Rachis and stipe green. Sori few, soon confluent.  [Illustration: The Rue Spleenwort. _A. Ruta-muraria_ (Top, Lake Huron--Lower Left, Mt. Toby, Mass.--Lower Right, Vermont) (From Herbarium of Geo. E. Davenport)]  This tiny fern grows from small fissures in the limestone cliffs, and is rather rare in this country; but in Great Britain it is very common, growing everywhere on walls and ruins. From Mt. Toby, Mass., and Willoughby Mountain, Vt., to Michigan, Missouri, Kentucky and southward.   B. THE LARGE SPLEENWORTS. _Athýrium_  The following species, which are often two to three feet high and grow in rich soil, are quite different in appearance and habits from the small rock spleenworts just described. Some botanists have kept them in the genus _Asplenium_ because their sori are usually rather straight or only slightly curved, but others are inclined to follow the practice of the British botanists and put them into a separate group under _Athýrium_. Nearly all agree that the lady fern, with its variously curved sori, should be placed here, and many others would place the silvery spleenwort in the same genus, partly because of its frequently doubled sori. In regard to the last member of the group, the narrow-leaved spleenwort, there is more doubt. The sori taken separately would place it with the _Aspleniums_, but considering its size, structure, habits of growth and all, it seems more closely allied to the two larger ferns than to the little rock species. We shall group the three together as the large spleenworts, or for the sake of being more definite adopt Clute's felicitous phrase.     THE LADY FERN AND ITS KIN   1. THE LADY FERNS  Fronds one to three feet high, broadly lanceolate, or ovate-oblong, tapering towards the apex, bipinnate. Pinnæ lanceolate, numerous. Pinnules oblong-lanceolate, cut-toothed or incised. Fruit-dots short, variously curved. Indusium delicate, often reniform, or shaped like a horseshoe, in some forms confluent at maturity.  Widely distributed, common and varying greatly in outline. The newer nomenclature separates the lady fern of our section into two distinct species, which should be carefully studied.[A]  [Footnote A: See monograph by F.K. Butters in _Rhodora_ of September, 1917.]  (1) THE UPLAND LADY FERN. ATHÝRIUM ANGÚSTUM  _Asplènium Fìlix-femina_  The rootstock or rhizome of the Upland Lady Fern here pictured shows how the thick, fleshy bases of the old fronds conceal the rootstock itself. In the Lowland Lady Fern the rootstock is but slightly concealed by old stipe bases, and so may be distinguished from its sister fern.  One design of such rootstocks is to store up food (mostly starch), during the summer to nourish the young plants as they shoot forth the next spring. The undecayed bases of the old stipes are also packed with starch for the same purpose.  [Illustration: Rootstock of the Upland Lady Fern]  [Illustration: The same split lengthwise (From Waters's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]  [Illustration: Sori of Lady Fern. _Athyrium angustum_]  Rootstocks horizontal, quite concealed by the thick, fleshy bases of old fronds. Scales of the long, tufted stipes dark brown. Indusium curved, often horseshoe-shaped, usually toothed or fringed with fine hairs, but without glands. Fronds bipinnate, one to three feet high, widest near the middle.  This is the common species of northern New England and the Canadian Provinces. The fronds differ very widely in form and a great many varieties have been pointed out, but the fern student, having first learned to identify the species, will gradually master the few leading varieties as he meets them.  Those growing in warm, sunny places where the fruit-dots when mature incline to cover the whole back of the frond are called \"sun forms.\" These are varieties TÝPICUM and ELÀTIUS, both with the pinnæ obliquely ascending (including variety _angustum_ of D.C. Eaton), but the latter has broader fronds with the pinnules of the sterile fronds oblong-lanceolate, somewhat acute and strongly toothed or pinnatifid.  [Illustration: Varieties of Lady Fern Left to right--1st and 2nd, Var. _typicum; 3d, elatius; 4th, rubellum; 5th, uncertain, perhaps confertum_]  Var. RUBÉLLUM has the sori distinct even when mature; its pinnules stand at a wide angle from the rachis of the pinna and are strongly toothed or pinnatifid with obtuse teeth. This variety favors regions with cool summers, or dense shade in warmer regions. The term RUBÉLLUM alludes to the reddish stems so often seen but this sign alone may not determine the variety. It occurs throughout the range of the species, being a common New England fern. Fernald remarks that this is also a common form of the species in southern Nova Scotia.  Among other varieties named by Butters are CONFÉRTUM, having the pinnules irregularly lobed and toothed; joined by a membranous wing, the lobes of the pinnules broad and overlapping, giving the fern a compact appearance; LACINIÀTUM with pinnules very irregular in size and shape, with many long, acute teeth, which project in various directions. \"An abnormal form which looks as if it had been nibbled when young.\"  These varieties are represented in the Gray Herbarium.  (2) THE LOWLAND LADY FERN  ATHÝRIUM ASPLENIÒIDES  Rootstocks creeping, not densely covered with the persistent bases of the fronds. Stipes about as long as the blade. Scales of the stipe very few, seldom persistent, rarely over 3-16 of an inch long. Fronds narrowly deltoid, lanceolate, widest near the base, the second pair of pinnæ commonly longest. Indusia ciliate, the cilia (hairs) ending in glands. Spores dark, netted or wrinkled.  [Illustration: Lowland Lady Fern. ATHYRIUM ASPLENIOIDES (From the Gray Herbarium)]  The following two forms are named by Butters:  F. TÝPICUM. The usual form frequent in eastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio, and Missouri.  F. SUBTRIPINNÀTUM. An unusually large and rare form with triangular, lanceolate, and pinnatifid pinnules, having blunt, oblong segments. Wet situations in half shade. Massachusetts, West Virginia, and Virginia.  Our lowland or southern lady fern flourishes in the southern states, comes up the Atlantic Coast until it meets the upland or northern species in Pennsylvania and southern New England, and their identification can hardly fail to awaken in the student a keen interest.  Our American botanists are inclined to think that the real _Athýrium fìlix-fémina_ is not to be found in the northeastern United States, but is rather a western species, with its habitat in California and the Rocky Mountain region and identical with _Athýrium cyclosòrum_.  But whatever changes may occur in the scientific name of the old _Athýrium fìlix-fémina_, the name lady fern will not change, but everywhere within our limits it will hold its own as a familiar term.  Underwood, writing of the lady fern under the genus _Asplenium_, mentions the form \"_exìle_, small, starved specimens growing in very dry situations and often fruiting when only a few inches high.\" He also mentions Eaton's \"_angústum_,\" and alludes to the \"Remaining sixty-three varieties equally unimportant that have been described of this species.\"  The lady fern is common in moist woods, by walls and roadsides, and at its best is a truly handsome species, although, like Mrs. Parsons, we have noticed that in the late summer it loses much of its delicacy. \"Many of its forms become disfigured and present a rather blotched and coarse appearance.\" The lady fern has inspired several poems, which have been quoted more or less fully in the fern books. The following lines are from the pen of Calder Campbell:    \"But not by burne in wood or dale   Grows anything so fair   As the palmy crest of emerald pale   Of the lady fern when the sunbeams turn   To gold her delicate hair.\"  Referring, perhaps, to the fair colors of the unfolding crosiers revealing stipes of a clear wine color in striking contrast with the delicate green of the foliage.  In identifying this fern the novice should bear in mind the tendency of the curved sori of youth to become straightened and even confluent with age, although such changes are rather unreliable. Possibly the suggestion of the poetic Davenport may be helpful to some that there is \"An indefinable charm about the various forms of the lady fern, which soon enables one to know it from its peculiarly graceful motion by merely gently swaying a frond in the hand.\" Spores ripen in August.
