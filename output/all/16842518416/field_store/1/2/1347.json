But think of the real things Edison has done. The first phonograph; improving the telegraph so that six messages can be sent over the same wire at the same time; improving the telephone so that everybody can use it; collecting fine iron ore from sand and dirt by magnets; increasing the power and the lightness of the storage battery. And there are the trolleys and electric railways that have been made possible. And the incandescent electric lamp--how about that? Edison has turned his wonderful genius only to those things that benefit millions of--\"  \"And he deserved to make millions out of it,\" said Ted.  \"I guess he has, too,\" offered one of the girls.  \"You bet, and that's what he works for: not just to benefit people,\" asserted Terry.  \"I suppose your dad and most other guys got their dough all by accident while they were trying to help other folks; eh?\" Bill fired at Terry.  But the rich boy walked away, his usual method to keep from getting the worst of an argument.  \"Oh, I wish Grace Hooper were here,\" Cora said. \"She's no snob like Terry and wouldn't she enjoy this?\"  \"And her dad, too. Isn't he a nice old fellow, even though he's awfully rich?\" laughed Dot.  \"He'd have his say about this argument, grammar or no grammar. He thinks a lot of this chap he calls Eddy's son,\" Mary Dean declared.  \"Great snakes! Does he really think the wizard is the child of some guy named Eddy?\" Ted queried.  \"Sounds so,\" Cora said. \"But you can't laugh at him, he's so kind and good and it would hurt Grace. He would be interested in radio, too.\"  \"Wonder he hasn't got a peach of a receiver set up in his house,\" Lucy Shore ventured.  \"Is he keen for all new-fangled things?\" asked Ted.  \"You bet he is, though somebody would have to tell him and show him first. Well, people, I'm going home; who's along?\"  With one accord the others got to their feet and started up or down the street. Gus and Bill went together, as always; they had much to talk about.     CHAPTER X   BRASS TACKS   On the day following the radio lecture, true to his promise, Professor Gray led Bill and Gus to the broad acres of the Hooper estate and there, with the plans before them, they went over the ground chosen for the water-power site, comprehending every detail of the engineering task. Professor Gray was more pleased than surprised by the ready manner in which both lads took hold of the problem and even suggested certain really desirable changes.  Bill indicated a better position fifty yards upstream for the dam and he sketched his idea of making a water-tight flood gate which was so ingenious that the Professor became enthusiastic and adopted it at once.  After nearly a whole day spent thus along the rocky defiles of the little stream, eating their lunch beside a cold spring at the head of a miniature gulch, the trio of engineers were about to leave the spot when a gruff voice hailed them from the hilltop. Looking up they saw another group of three: an oldish man, a slim young fellow who was almost a grown man and a girl in her middle teens. The young people seemed to be quarreling, to judge from the black looks they gave each other, but the man paid them no attention. He beckoned Professor Gray to approach and came slowly down the hill to meet him, walking rather stiffly with a cane.  \"Well, Professor, you're beginnin' to git at it, eh? Struck any snags yit? Some job! I reckon you're not a goin' to make a heap outside the price you give me. When you goin' to git at it reg'lar?\"  \"Right away, Mr. Hooper. To-morrow. We have been making our plans to-day and these young assistants of mine, who will principally conduct the work, are ready to start in at once. They--\"  \"Them boys? No, sir! I want this here work done an' done right; no bunglin'. What's kids know about puttin' in water wheels an' 'letric lights? You said you was--\"  \"These boys are no longer just kids, Mr. Hooper, and they know more than you think; all that is needed to make this job complete. Moreover, I am going to consult with them frequently by letter and I shall be entirely responsible. It is up to me, you know.\"  Mr. Hooper evidently saw the sense in this last remark; he stood blinking his eyes at Bill and Gus and pondering. The slim youth plucked at his sleeve and said something in a low voice.  Gus suddenly remembered the fellow. The youth had come into the town a week or two before. He had, without cause, deliberately kicked old Mrs. Sowerby's maltese cat, asleep on the pavement, out of his way, and Gus, a witness from across the street, had departed from his usually reticent mood to call the human beast down for it. But though Gus hoped the fellow would show resentment he did not, but walked on quickly instead.  Mr. Hooper listened; then voiced a further and evidently suggested opposition:  \"Them lads is from the town here; ain't they? Nothin' but a lot o' hoodlums down yan. You can't expec'--\"  \"You couldn't be more mistaken, Mr. Hooper. I'll admit there are a lot of young scamps in Fairview, but these boys, William Brown and Augustus Grier, belong to a more self-respecting bunch. I'll answer for them in every way.\"  \"Of course, Dad, Professor Gray knows about them. Billy and Gus are in our class at school.\" This from the girl who had joyfully greeted the Professor and the boys, yodeling a school yell from the hillside. Then she shot an aside at the slim youth: \"You're a regular, downright simpleton, Thad, and forever looking for trouble. Don't listen to him, Dad.\"  This appeared to settle the matter. Mr. Hooper squared his shoulders and grinned broadly, adding: \"Well, I ain't just satisfied 'bout them knowin' how, but go to it your own way, Professor. I'm a goin' to watch it, you know; not to interfere with your plans an' ways, but it's got to be done right. If it goes along free an' fine, I ain't goin' to kick.\"  The Professor explained that they had further work to do on the plans and must be going back. He took leave of Mr. Hooper and the daughter, and retreated with the boys as hurriedly as Bill could manage his handy crutch. They all proceeded silently in crossing the broad field, but when in the road Bill had to voice his thoughts:  \"I expect that old fellow'll make it too hot for us.\"  \"Not for a minute; you need not consider that at all. Of course it would be more satisfactory if Mr. Hooper could be assured at once of your real ability, but it will have to grow on him. Just let him see what you can do; that's all.\"  \"I rather expect we can frame up something that will satisfy him and Bill can spring it,\" said Gus.  \"In just what way, can you imagine?\" queried the Professor.  \"Some geometrical stunt, maybe; triangulation, or--\"  \"Why, sure! That's just it!\" exploded Bill. \"I know how we can get him: Parallax! Shucks, it'll be easy! Just leave it to me.\"  \"Looks as though some kind of Napoleonic strategy were going to be pulled off,\" asserted Professor Gray, laughing. \"But, boys, keep in mind that Mr. Hooper, while a rough-and-ready old chap, with a big fortune made in cattle dealing, is really an uncut diamond; a fine old fellow at heart, as you will see.\"     CHAPTER XI   ENGINEERING   Two busy days followed during which Bill and Gus went to the city with Professor Gray to purchase materials in full for the power plant. They also had cement, reinforcing iron, lumber for forms and a small tool house hauled out to the power site and they drove the first stakes to show the position of wheel and pipe line. Mr. Hooper did not put in an appearance.  On the third morning the Professor bade the boys good-by, exacting the promise that they would write frequently of their progress. They had privately formed an engineering company with Professor Gray as president, Gus as vice-president, which was largely honorary, and Bill as general manager and secretary. Advance payments necessary for extra labor and their own liberal wages were deposited at the Fairview Bank by Professor Gray and the boys were given a drawing account thereon, with a simple expense book to keep.  That afternoon, dressed in new overalls and blouses, with a big, good-natured colored man to help with the laboring work, the boys were early on the job, at first making a cement mixing box; then Bill drove the center stake thirty feet below where the dam was to be placed and from which, using a long cord, the curve of the structure twenty-nine feet wide, was laid out upstream.  At the spot chosen the rock-bound hillsides rose almost perpendicularly from the narrow level ground that was little above the bed of the stream; it was the narrowest spot between the banks. George, the colored fellow, was set to work digging into one bank for an end foundation; the other bank held a giant boulder.  The boys were giving such close attention to their labors that they did not see observers on the hilltop. Presently the gruff voice that they had heard before hailed them from close by and they looked up to see Mr. Hooper and the slim youth approaching. The boys had heard that this Thaddeus was the old man's nephew and that he called the Hooper mansion his home.  \"What you drivin' that there stake down there for? Up here's where the Perfesser said the dam was to set,\" Mr. Hooper demanded.  \"Yes, right here,\" Bill replied. \"But it is to be curved upstream and that stake is our center.\"  \"What's the idea of curvin' it?\"  \"So that it will be stronger and withstand the pressure. You can't break an arch, you know, and to push this out the hills would have to spread apart.\"  \"I kind o' see.\" The old man was thoughtful and looked on silently while the dam breast stakes were being driven every three feet at the end of a stretched cord, the other end pivoting on the center stake below, this giving the required curve.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11861"],["title","Radio Boys Cronies; Or, Bill Brown's Radio (#7)"],["body","\"How deep you goin' into that hill? Seems like the water can't git round it now.\" Mr. Hooper, at a word from Thad, seemed inclined to criticize.  \"We must get a firm end, preferably against rock,\" Bill explained.  \"Shucks! Reckon the clay ain't goin' to give none. How much fall you goin' to git on that Pullet wheel?\"  \"Pelton wheel. About eighty feet, Professor Gray figured it roughly. We'll take it later exactly.\"  \"Kin you improve on the Perfesser?\"  \"No, but he made only a rough calculation. We'll take it both by levels and by triangulation, using an old sextant of the Professor's. It isn't a diff----\"  \"What's try-angleation?\" Mr. Hooper was becoming interested.  \"The method of reading angles of different degrees and in that way getting heights and distances. That's the way they measure mountains that can't be climbed and tell the distance of stars.\"  \"Shucks, young feller! I don't reckon anybody kin tell the distance o' the stars; they only put up a bluff on that. They ain't no ackshall way o' gittin' distance onless you lay a tape measure, er somethin' like it on the ground. These here surveyors all does it; I had 'em go round my place.\"  Bill smiled and shook his head. \"I guess you just haven't given it any consideration. There are lots of easier and better ways. Triangulation. Now, for instance, suppose an army comes to a wide river and wants to get across. They can't send anybody over to stretch a line; there may be enemy sharp-shooters that would get them and it is too wide, anyway. But they must know how many pontoon boats and how much flooring plank they must have to bridge it and so they sight a tree or a rock on the other shore and take the distance across by triangulation. Or suppose--\"  \"Never heard of it. Why wouldn't surveyors git from here to yan that a-way, 'stead o' usin' chains? Could you----?\"  \"Chaining it is a little more accurate, where they have a lot of curves and angles and the view is cut off by woods and hills. Yes, we can work triangulation; we could tell the distance from the hilltop to your house if we could see it and we had the time.\"  \"Bunk! Don't let 'em bluff you that a-way, Uncle. Make 'em prove it.\" Thad showed his open hostility thus.  Gus dropped his shovel and came from the creekside where he had begun to dig alongside of the stakes for the foundation. He was visibly and, for him, strangely excited as he walked up to Thad.  \"See here, fellow, Bill can do it and if there is anything in it we will do it, too! You are pretty blamed ignorant!\"  Mr. Hooper threw back his head and let out a roar of mirth. \"Well, I reckon that hits me, too. An' I reckon it might be true in a lot o' things. But Thad an' me, we kind o' doubt this.\"  \"We sure do. I'd bet five dollars you couldn't tell it within half a mile an' it ain't much more than that.\"  \"I'll take your bet and dare you to hold to it,\" said Gus.  \"Bet 'em, Thad; bet 'em! I'll stake you.\"  \"Oh, we don't want your money; betting doesn't get anywhere and it isn't just square, anyway.\" Bill was smilingly endeavoring to restore good feeling. \"Now, Mr. Hooper, we're not fixed to make a triangulation measurement to-day, but----\"  \"Not fixed? Of course not. Begins with excuses,\" sneered Thad.  \"But to-morrow we'll bring out Professor Gray's transit and show you the way it's done.\"  \"Oh, yes, Uncle; they'll show us--to-morrow, or next day, or next week. Bunk!\" Thad was plainly trying to be offensive.  \"You'll grin on the other side of your hatchet face, fellow, when we do show you,\" said Gus.  \"Now, Gus, cut out the scrapping. You can't blame him, nor Mr. Hooper, for doubting it if they've never looked into the matter. We can bring the transit out this afternoon for taking the levels. Be here after dinner, Mr. Hooper, if you can.\"  \"I'll be here, lads,\" said the ex-cattle-dealer. \"An' I reckon my nephew'll come along, too.\"     CHAPTER XII   DISTANCE LENDS ENCHANTMENT   Mr. Hooper, his nephew, his daughter and another girl, fat and dumpy, were at the power site before two o'clock, and without more ado Bill asked Gus to bring the transit to the comparatively level field on top of the hill.  \"Now, Mr. Hooper, please don't think we're doing this in a spirit of idle controversy; we only want to show you something interesting.\"  \"That's all right, lad; an' I ain't above learnin', old as I am. But Thad here, he's different.\" Mr. Hooper gave Bill and Gus a long wink. \"Thad, he don't reckon he can be learned a thing, an' he's so blame sure--say, Thad, how 'bout that bet?\"  \"We don't want to bet anything; that only--\" began Bill, but Gus was less pacific.  \"Put up, or shut up,\" he said, drawing a borrowed five dollar note out of his pocket and glaring at Thad. The slim youth did not respond.  \"He's afraid to bet,\" jeered the daughter. \"Hasn't got the nerve, or the money.\"  \"I ain't afraid to bet.\" Thad brought forth a like amount in bills. \"Uncle'll hold the stakes. You got to tell how far it is from here to the house without ever stepping the distance.\"  \"We'll make a more simple demonstration than that,\" Bill declared. \"It'll be the same thing and take less time and effort. Mr. Hooper, take some object out there in the field; something that we can see; anything.\"  \"Here, Gracie, you take a stake there an' go out yan an' stick it up. Keep a-goin' till I holler.\"  Both girls carried out these directions, the fat one falling down a couple of times, tripped by the long grass and getting up shaking with laughter. The boys were to learn that she was a chum of Grace Hooper, that her name was Sophronia Doyle, though commonly nicknamed \"Skeets.\"  The stake was placed. Bill drove another at his feet, set the transit over it, peeped through it both ways and at his direction, after stretching the steel tape, Gus drove a third stake exactly sixty feet from the transit at an angle of ninety degrees from a line to the field stake.  \"Now, folks,\" explained Bill, \"the stake out yonder is A, this one is B and the one at the other end of the sixty-foot base line is C. Please remember that.\"  The transit was then placed exactly over the stake C and, peeping again, Bill found the angle from the base line to the stake B and the line to stake A to be 78 degrees. Thereupon Gus produced a long board, held up one end and rested the other on a stake, while Bill went to work with a six-foot rule, a straight edge and a draughtsman's degree scale. Bill elucidated:  \"Now, then, to get out of figuring, which is always hard to understand, we'll just lay the triangulation out by scale, which is easily understood. One-eighth of an inch equals one foot. This point is stake B and the base line to C is this line at right angles, or square across the board. C stake is 7-1/2 inches from B which is equal to sixty feet on the scale, that is sixty one-eighth inches. Now, this line, parallel to the edge of the board, is the exact direction of your stake A. Do you all follow that?  \"The direction to your stake was 78 degrees from the base line at C. This degree scale will give us that.\" Bill carefully centered the latter instrument, sharpened his pencil and marked the angle; then placing the straight edge on the point C and the degree mark he extended the line until it crossed the other outward line. At this crossing he marked a letter A and turned to his auditors.  \"This is your stake out yonder. The rule shows it to be a little over 34-5/8 inches from the base line at B. That is, by the scale, a few inches over 277 feet and that is the distance from here to where Grace stuck it into the ground. Our hundred-foot steel tape line is at your service, Mr. Hooper.\"  Mr. Hooper merely glanced at Bill. He took up the tape line and spoke to his nephew. \"Git a holt o' this thing, Thad, an' let's see if--\"  Grace interrupted him. \"No, Dad; never let Thad do it! He'd make some mistake accidentally on purpose. I'll help you.\"  There was utter silence from all while Grace carried out the end of the tape and placed her sticks, Mr. Hooper following after. Skeets borrowed a pencil and a bit of paper from Gus and went along with Grace to keep tally, but she dropped the pencil in the grass, stepped on and broke it, was suffused with embarrassment and before she could really become useful, the father and daughter had made the count mentally and they came back to the base line, still without saying a word, a glad smile on the girl's face and something between wonder and surprise on the old man's features.  Still without a word Mr. Hooper came straight to Bill, thrust out his big hand to grasp that of the smiling boy and in the other hand was held the bills of the wager, which he extended toward Gus.  \"Yours, lad,\" he said. \"We made the distance two hundred and seventy-eight foot. I reckon you git the money.\"  Thad stood for a moment, nonplussed, a scowl on his face. Suddenly he recovered.  \"Hold on! That's more than they said it was. The money's mine.\"  \"Shucks, you dumb fool! Maybe a couple o' inches. I reckon we made the mistake, fer we wasn't careful. It gits me they was that near it. The cash is his'n.\"  Gus took the bills, thrust his own into his pocket again and handed the two dollar note and the three ones to Skeets.  \"Please give them to him for me,\" indicating Thad, \"I don't want his money.\"  \"Not I,\" said the fat girl; \"it isn't my funeral. Let him do the weeping and you take and give them to the poor.\"  Gus offered them to Grace, who also refused, shaking her head. Bill took the bills, and, limping over to Thad, handed him his wager. \"You mustn't feel sore at us,\" counseled the youthful engineer. \"This was only along the lines of experiment and--and fun.\"  But though Bill meant this in the kindliest spirit of comradeship, the boy sensed a feeling of extreme animosity that he was at a loss to account for. Bill backed off, further speech toward conciliation becoming as lame as his leg. The others witnessed this and Grace said, quite heatedly:  \"Oh, you can't make a silk purse out of a pig's "]]]
