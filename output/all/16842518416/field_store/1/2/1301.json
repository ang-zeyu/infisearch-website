While the Winnebagos were gliding along among scenes strange and new, Hinpoha was vainly trying to comfort herself for having to stay at home by catching in a bottle the bees which were crawling in and out of the cosmos blossoms in the garden. Interesting as the bees were, however, they could not keep her thoughts from turning to the Winnebagos afloat on the river, and it was a very doleful face that bent over the flowers. Her dismal reflections were interrupted by the sharp voice of Aunt Phoebe calling her to come in. \"What is it?\" she asked listlessly, as she came up on the porch.  \"Mrs. Evans is here,\" said her aunt in the doorway, \"and she has asked to see you.\" Hinpoha was very glad to see Mrs. Evans, who rose smilingly and took her hands in hers.  \"How thin you are getting, child!\" she exclaimed, smoothing back the red curls. \"I don't believe you get out enough. By the way,\" she said to Aunt Phoebe, \"may I borrow this girl for to-day? I have considerable driving about to do and it is rather tiresome going alone. Gladys has gone on an all-day boat ride.\"  Aunt Phoebe could not very well refuse, for driving about in a machine with an older woman was a very proper form of recreation indeed, in her estimation.  Hinpoha flew upstairs and deposited her bottle of bees on the table in her room for future observation and started off with Mrs. Evans. \"We will not be back for lunch, and possibly not for supper,\" said Gladys's mother as she bade Aunt Phoebe a gracious good-bye, \"but it will not be long after that.\"  \"And now for a grand spin,\" she said, as she started the car and sent it crackling through the dry leaves on the pavement.  \"Now I see why the Indians named this river 'Cuyahoga,' or 'Crooked,'\" said Migwan, as they rounded bend after bend in the stream. \"It coils back on itself like a snake, and I have already counted seven coils within the city limits. I didn't believe it when the captain of a freighter told me that there was a place in the river which his boat couldn't pass because two sharp turns came so near together, but now I see how that could easily be possible.\"  As the launch putt-putt-putt-ed steadily up the river the water gradually became less black, and the factories along the shore gave way to open stretches of country. By noon they reached the dam and went ashore to look for a place to build a fire. They were in a deep gorge, its steep sides thickly covered with flaming maples and oaks, and brilliant sumachs, stretching on either side as far as they could reach. \"It's too gorgeous to seem real,\" said Nyoda, shading her eyes and looking down the valley; \"where _does_ Mother Nature keep her pot of 'Diamond Dyes' in the summer time?\"  High up along the top of one of the cliffs a narrow road wound along, and as Nyoda stood looking into the distance she saw an automobile coming along this road. When it was directly above her it stopped and two people got out, a woman and a girl. The sunlight fell on a mass of red curls on the girl's head. \"Hinpoha!\" exclaimed Nyoda in amazement. From above came floating down a far-echoing yodel--the familiar Winnebago call. The girls all looked up in surprise to see Hinpoha scrambling down the face of the cliff, and aiding Mrs. Evans to descend.  \"Why, _mother_!\" called Gladys, running up to meet her.  The surprise at the meeting was mutual. Mrs. Evans, spinning along the country roads, had no idea she was hard on the trail of her daughter and the other Winnebagos until she came suddenly upon them after they had gotten out of the launch. \"Can't you stay and spend the day with us, now that you're here?\" they pleaded.  Hinpoha's longing soul looked out of her eyes, but she answered, \"I'm afraid not. Aunt Phoebe wouldn't approve.\"  \"Did she say you couldn't?\" asked Sahwah.  \"No,\" said Hinpoha, \"for I never even asked her if I might go along with you in the launch. I knew it would be no use.\"  \"Oh, please stay,\" tempted some of the girls; \"your aunt'll never know the difference.\"  \"Oh, I couldn't do that,\" said Hinpoha in a tone of horror. A little approving smile crept around the corners of Nyoda's eyes as she heard Hinpoha so resolutely bidding Satan get behind her. Mrs. Evans was genuinely sorry they had encountered the girls, because it made it so much harder for Hinpoha.  \"I wonder,\" she said musingly, \"if I drove on to a house in the road and telephoned your aunt that she would let you stay?\"  \"You might try,\" said Hinpoha doubtfully. Mrs. Evans thought it was worth trying. She found a house with a telephone and got Aunt Phoebe on the wire. With the utmost tact she explained how they had met the girls accidently, and that she had taken a notion that she would like to spend the day with them, but of course she could not do so unless Hinpoha would be allowed to stay with her, as she had charge of her for the day. What was Aunt Phoebe to do? She was not equal to telling the admired Mrs. Evans to forego her pleasure because of Hinpoha, and gave a grudging consent to her keeping her niece with her on the condition that she would bring her home in the machine and not let her come back in the launch with the Winnebagos. Jubilant, they returned to the girls in the gorge and told the good news.  \"Cheer for Mrs. Evans,\" cried Sahwah, and the Winnebagos gave it with a hearty good will.  Hinpoha, with Sahwah close beside her, began I searching for firewood industriously. \"It seems just like last summer,\" she said, chopping sticks with Sahwah's hatchet. The two had wandered off a short distance from the others, following a tiny footpath. Suddenly they came upon a huge rock formation, that looked like an immense fireplace, about forty feet wide and twenty or more feet high. Under that great stone arch a dozen spits, each big enough to hold a whole ox, might easily have swung. Sahwah and Hinpoha looked at it in amazement and then called for the other girls to come and see.  \"Why, that's the 'Old Maid's Kitchen,'\" said Mrs. Evans, when she arrived on the scene. \"I've been here before. Just why it should be called the _Old Maid's_ Kitchen is more than I can tell, for it looks like the fireplace belonging to the grand-mother of all giantesses.\"  \"Let's build our fire inside of it,\" said Nyoda.  \"The original 'Old Maid' had a convenience that didn't usually go with open fireplaces,\" said Gladys, \"and that is running water,\" and she held her cup under a tiny stream that trickled out between two rocks, cold as ice and clear as crystal.  \"Wouldn't this be a grand place for a Ceremonial Meeting?\" said Migwan, as they all stood round the blazing fire roasting \"wieners\" and bacon. The Kitchen had a floor of smooth slabs of rock, and the arch of the fireplace formed a roof over their heads, while its wide opening afforded them a wonderful view of the gorge.  \"Whenever you want to come here again, just say so,\" said Mrs. Evans, \"and I'll bring you down in the machine.\" Mrs. Evans was enjoying herself as much as any of the girls. It was the first time she had ever cooked wieners and bacon over an open fire on green sticks, and she was perfectly delighted with the experience. \"If my husband could only see me now,\" she said, laughing like a girl as she dropped her last wiener in the dirt and calmly washed it off in the trickling stream. \"How good this hot cocoa tastes!\" she exclaimed, drinking down a whole cupful without stopping. \"What kind is it?\"  \"Camp Fire Girl Cocoa,\" answered the girls.  \"What kind is that?\" asked Mrs. Evans.  \"It is a brand that is put up by a New York firm for the Camp Fire Girls to sell,\" answered Nyoda.  \"Why have we never had any of this at our house?\" asked Mrs. Evans, turning to Gladys.  \"You have always insisted that you would use no other kind than Van Horn's,\" replied Gladys, \"so I thought there would be no use in mentioning it.\"  \"I like this better than Van Horn's,\" said her mother. \"Is there any to be had now?\"  \"There certainly is,\" answered Nyoda. \"We are trying to dispose of a hundred-can lot to pay our annual dues.\"  \"Let me have a dozen cans,\" said Mrs. Evans. \"I will serve Camp Fire Girl Cocoa to my Civic Club next Wednesday afternoon. I----\"  Here a terrific shriek from Migwan brought them all to their feet. She had been poking about in the corner of the Kitchen, when something had suddenly jumped out at her, unfolded itself like a fan and was whirling around her head. \"It's a bat!\" cried Sahwah, and they all laughed heartily at Migwan's fright. The bat wheeled around, blind in the daylight, and went bumping against the girls, causing them to run in alarm lest it should get entangled in their hair. It finally found its way back to the dark corner of the Kitchen and hung itself up neatly the way Migwan had found it and the dinner proceeded.  \"What kind of a bat was it?\" asked Gladys.  \"Must have been a _bacon bat_,\" said Sahwah, dodging the acorn that Hinpoha threw at her for making a pun.  \"Tell us a new game to play, Nyoda,\" said Gladys, \"or Sahwah will go right on making puns.\"  \"Here is one I thought of on the way down,\" answered Nyoda. \"Think of all the things that you know are manufactured in Cleveland, or form an important part of the shipping industry. Then we'll go around the circle, naming them in alphabetical order. Each girl may "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11718"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls at School; Or, The Wohelo Weavers (#7)"],["body","ten seconds in which to think when her turn comes, and if she misses she is out of the game. She may only come in again by supplying a word when another has missed, before the next girl in the circle can think of one.\"  \"And let the two that hold out the longest have the first ride in the canoe,\" suggested Sahwah.  The game started. Nyoda had the first chance. \"Automobiles,\" she began.  \"Bricks,\" said Gladys.  \"Clothing,\" said Migwan.  \"Drugs,\" said Sahwah.  \"Engines,\" said Hinpoha.  \"Flour,\" said Mrs. Evans.  \"Gasoline,\" said Nakwisi.  \"Hardware,\" said Chapa.  \"Iron,\" said Medmangi.  Nyoda hesitated, fishing for a \"J.\" \"One, two, three, four, five, six,\" began Sahwah.  \"Jewelry!\" cried Nyoda on the tenth count.  \"Knitted goods,\" continued Gladys.  \"Lamps,\" said Migwan.  \"Macaroni,\" said Sahwah.  \"That reminds me,\" said Mrs. Evans, \"I meant to order some macaroni to-day and forgot it.\"  \"N,\" said Hinpoha, \"N,--why, Nothing!\" The girls laughed at the witty application, but she was ruled out nevertheless.  \"Nails,\" said Mrs. Evans.  \"Oil,\" said Nakwisi.  \"Paint,\" said Chapa.  Medmangi sat down. Nyoda began to count. \"Quadrupeds!\" cried Medmangi hastily.  \"Explain yourself,\" said Nyoda.  \"Tables and chairs,\" said Medmangi. The girls shouted in derision, but Nyoda ruled the answer in, and the game proceeded.  \"Refrigerators,\" said Nyoda.  \"Salt,\" said Gladys.  \"Tents,\" said Migwan, with a reminiscent sigh.  \"Umbrellas,\" said Sahwah.  Mrs. Evans fell down on \"V.\" \"Varnish,\" said Chapa.  \"W\" was too much for Medmangi. \"Wire,\" said Nyoda.  \"X,\" said Sahwah, \"there is no such thing. Oh, yes, there is, too; Xylophones, they're made here.\"  Gladys and Migwan met their Waterloo on \"Y.\" \"Yeast,\" said Nyoda.  \"Z,\" sent Chapa and Nakwisi to the dummy corner and it came back to Sahwah. \"Zerolene,\" she said.  \"What's that?\" they all cried.  \"I don't know,\" she answered, \"but I saw it on one of the big oil tanks as we passed.\"  Sahwah and Nyoda won the right to take the first paddle in the _Keewaydin_. They carried the canoe on their heads, portage fashion, around the dam, and launched it up above, where the confined waters had spread out into a wide pond. \"Oh, what a joy to dip a paddle again!\" sighed Sahwah blissfully, sending the _Keewaydin_ flying through the water with long, vigorous strokes. \"I'd love to paddle all the way home.\" She had completely forgotten that there was such a thing as school and lessons in the world. She was the Daughter of the River, and this was a joyous homecoming.  \"Time to go back and let the rest have a turn,\" said Nyoda. Reluctantly Sahwah steered the canoe around and returned to the waiting group. Mrs. Evans watched with interest as Gladys and Hinpoha pushed out from shore. Could this be her once frail daughter, who had despised all strenuous sports and hated water above all things, who was swinging her paddle so lustily and steering the _Keewaydin_ so skilfully? What was this strange Something that the Camp Fire had instilled into her? She caught her breath with the beauty of it, as the girls glided along between the radiant banks, the two paddles flashing in and out in perfect rhythm. They were singing a favorite boating song, and their voices floated back on the breeze:    \"Through the mystic haze of the autumn days   Like a phantom ghost I glide,   Where the big moose sees the crimson trees   Mirrored on the silver tide,   And the blood red sun when day is done   Sinks below the hill,   The night hawk swoops, the lily droops,   And all the world is still!\"  Sahwah lingered on the river after the others had gone in a body to try to climb to the top of the rocky fireplace. She was all alone in the _Keewaydin_, and sent it darting around like a water spider on the surface of the stream. So absorbed was she in the joy of paddling that she did not see a sign on a tree beside the river which warned people in boats to go no further than that point, neither did she realize the significance of the quicker progress which the _Keewaydin_ was making. When she did realize that she was getting dangerously near the edge of the dam, and attempted to turn back, she discovered to her horror that it was impossible to turn back. The _Keewaydin_ was being swept helplessly and irresistibly onward. Recent rains had swollen the stream and the water was pouring over the dam. Sahwah screamed aloud when she saw the peril in which she was. Nyoda and Mrs. Evans and the girls, standing up on the rocks, turned and saw her. Help was out of the question. Frozen to the spot they saw her rushing along to that descent of waters. Gladys moaned and covered her face with her hands. Below the falls the great rocks jutted out, jagged and bare. Any boat going over would be dashed to pieces.  The _Keewaydin_ shot forward, gaining speed with every second. The roar of the falls filled Sahwah's ears. Not ten feet from the brink a rock jutted up a little above the surface, just enough to divide the current into two streams. When the _Keewaydin_ reached this point it turned sharply and was hurled into the current nearest the shore. On the bank right at the brink of the falls stood a great willow tree, its long branches drooping far out over the water. It was one chance in a million and Sahwah saw it. As she passed under the tree she reached up and caught hold of a branch, seized it firmly and jumped clear of the canoe, which went over the falls almost under her feet. Then, swinging along by her arms, she reached the shore and stood in safety. It had all happened so quickly the girls could hardly comprehend it. Gladys, who had hidden her eyes to shut out the dreadful sight, heard an incredulous shout from the girls and looked down to see the _Keewaydin_ landing on the rocks below, empty, and Sahwah standing on the bank.  \"How did you ever manage to do it?\" gasped Hinpoha, when they had surrounded her with exclamations of joy and amazement. \"You're a heroine again.\"  \"You're nothing of the sort,\" said Nyoda. \"It was sheer foolhardiness or carelessness that got you into that scrape. A girl who doesn't know enough to keep out of the current isn't to be trusted with a canoe, no matter what a fine paddler she is. I certainly thought better of you than that, Sahwah. I never used to have the slightest anxiety when you were on the water, I had such a perfect trust in your common sense, but now I can never feel quite sure of you again.\"  Sahwah hung her head in shame, for she felt the truth of Nyoda's words. \"I think you can trust me after this,\" she said humbly. \"I have learned my lesson.\" She was not likely to forget the horror of the moment when she had heard the water roaring over the dam and thought her time had come. Sahwah liked to be thought clever as well as daring, and it was certainly far from clever to run blindly into danger as she had done. She sank dejectedly down on the bank, feeling disgraced forever in the eyes of the Winnebagos.  \"Girls,\" said Mrs. Evans, wishing to take their minds off the fright they had received, \"do you know that we are not many miles from one of the model dairy farms of the world? I could take you over in the car and bring you back here in time to go home in the launch.\"  \"Let's do it, Nyoda,\" begged all the Winnebagos, and into the machine they piled. When they were still far in the distance they could see the high towers of the barns rising in the air. \"We're nearly there,\" said Mrs. Evans; \"here is the beginning to the cement fence that runs all the way around the four-thousand-acre farm.\" Mrs. Evans knew some of the people in charge of the farm and they had no difficulty gaining admittance. That visit to the Carter Farm was a long-remembered one. The girls walked through the long stables exclaiming at everything they saw.  \"Why, there's an electric fan in each stall!\" gasped Migwan, \"and the windows are screened!\"  \"Oo, look at the darling calf,\" gurgled Hinpoha, on her knees before one of the stalls, caressing a ten-thousand-dollar baby.  \"It doesn't look a bit like its mother,\" observed Nyoda, comparing it with the cow standing beside it.  \"That isn't its mother, that's its nurse,\" said the man who was showing them around.  \"Its what?\" said Nyoda. Then the man explained that the milk from the blooded cows was too valuable to be fed to calves, as it commanded a high price on the market, and so a herd of common cows were kept to feed the aristocratic babies. The lovely little creatures were as tame as kittens and allowed the girls to fondle them to their hearts' content. Sometimes a pair of polished horns would come poking between a calf and the visitors, and a soft-eyed cow would view the proceedings with a comically anxious face, and then it was easy to tell which calf was with its mother.  In one of the largest stalls they saw the champion Guernsey of the world. Her coat was like satin and her horns were polished until they shone. She did not seem to be in the least set up on account of her great reputation and thrust out her nose in the friendliest manner possible to be patted and fussed over. She eyed Gladys, who stood next to her, with amiable curiosity, and then suddenly licked her face. Mrs. Evans watched Gladys in surprise. Instead of quivering all over with disgust as she would have a year ago she simply laughed and patted the cow's nose. \"What is going to happen?\" said Mrs. Evans to herself, \"Gladys isn't afraid of cows any more!\" But the most interesting part came when the cows were milked. They were driven into another barn for this performance and their heads fastened into sort of metal hoops suspended from the ceiling. These turned in either direction and caused them no discomfort, but kept them standing in one place. The milking was done with vacuum-suction machines run by electricity and took only a short time.  When the girls had watched the process as long as they wished they were taken to see the prize hogs and chickens, and then went through the hot houses. There were rows"]]]
