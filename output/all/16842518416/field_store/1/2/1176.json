I want to travel around and see them.\" The old women said: \"The nearest ones are at the point of rocks (on Sun River). There is a pis'kun there.\" So K[)u]t-o'-yis travelled off toward this place, and when he reached the camp, he entered an old woman's lodge.  The old woman set before him a plate of bad food. \"How is this?\" he asked. \"Have you nothing better than this to set before a stranger? You have a pis'kun down there, and must get plenty of fat meat. Give me some pemmican.\" \"We cannot do that,\" the old woman replied, \"because there is a big snake here, who is chief of the camp. He not only takes the best pieces, but often he eats a handsome young woman, when he sees one.\" When K[)u]t-o'-yis heard this he was angry, and went over and entered the snake's lodge. The women were cooking up some sarvis berries. He picked up the dish, and ate the berries, and threw the dish out of the door. Then he went over to where the snake was lying asleep, pricked him with his knife, and said: \"Here, get up. I have come to see you.\" This made the snake angry. He partly raised himself up and began to rattle, when K[)u]t-o'-yis cut him into pieces with his knife. Then he turned around and killed all his wives and children, except one little female snake, which escaped by crawling into a crack in the rocks. \"Oh, well,\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis, \"you can go and breed young snakes, so there will be more. The people will not be afraid of little snakes.\" K[)u]t-o'-yis said to the old woman, \"Now you go into this snake's lodge and take it for yourself, and everything that is in it.\"  Then he asked them where there were some more people. They told him that there were some people down the river, and some up in the mountains. But they said: \"Do not go there, for it is bad, because Ai-sin'-o-ko-ki (Wind Sucker) lives there. He will kill you.\" It pleased K[)u]t-o'-yis to know that there was such a person, and he went to the mountains. When he got to the place where Wind Sucker lived, he looked into his mouth, and could see many dead people there,--some skeletons and some just dead. He went in, and there he saw a fearful sight. The ground was white as snow with the bones of those who had died. There were bodies with flesh on them; some were just dead, and some still living. He spoke to a living person, and asked, \"What is that hanging down above us?\" The person answered that it was Wind Sucker's heart. Then said K[)u]t-o'-yis: \"You who still draw a little breath, try to shake your heads (in time to the song), and those who are still able to move, get up and dance. Take courage now, we are going to have the ghost dance.\" So K[)u]t-o'-yis bound his knife, point upward, to the top of his head and began to dance, singing the ghost song, and all the others danced with him; and as he danced up and down, the point of the knife cut Wind Sucker's heart and killed him. K[)u]t-o'-yis took his knife and cut through Wind Sucker's ribs, and freed those who were able to crawl out, and said to those who could still travel to go and tell their people that they should come here for the ones who were still alive but unable to walk.  Then he asked some of these people: \"Where are there any other people? I want to visit all the people.\" They said to him: \"There is a camp to the westward up the river, but you must not take the left-hand trail going up, because on that trail lives a woman, a handsome woman, who invites men to wrestle with her and then kills them. You must avoid her.\" This was what K[)u]t-o'-yis was looking for. This was his business in the world, to kill off all the bad things. So he asked the people just where this woman lived, and asked where it was best to go to avoid her. He did this, because he did not wish the people to know that he wanted to meet her.  He started on his way, and at length saw this woman standing by the trail. She called out to him, \"Come here, young man, come here; I want to wrestle with you.\" \"No,\" replied the young man, \"I am in a hurry. I cannot stop.\" But the woman called again, \"No, no, come now and wrestle once with me.\" When she had called him four times, K[)u]t-o'-yis went up to her. Now on the ground, where this woman wrestled with people, she had placed many broken and sharp flints, partly hiding them by the grass. They seized each other, and began to wrestle over these broken flints, but K[)u]t-o'-yis looked at the ground and did not step on them. He watched his chance, and suddenly gave the woman a wrench, and threw her down on a large sharp flint, which cut her in two; and the parts of her body fell asunder.  Then K[)u]t-o'-yis went on, and after a while came to where a woman kept a sliding place; and at the far end of it there was a rope, which would trip people up, and when they were tripped, they would fall over a high cliff into deep water, where a great fish would eat them. When this woman saw him coming, she cried out, \"Come over here, young man, and slide with me.\" \"No,\" he replied, \"I am in a hurry.\" She kept calling him, and when she had called the fourth time, he went over to slide with her. \"This sliding,\" said the woman, \"is a very pleasant pastime.\" \"Ah!\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis, \"I will look at it.\" He looked at the place, and, looking carefully, he saw the hidden rope. So he started to slide, and took out his knife, and when he reached the rope, which the woman had raised, he cut it, and when it parted, the woman fell over backward into the water, and was eaten up by the big fish.  Again he went on, and after a while he came to a big camp. This was the place of a man-eater. K[)u]t-o'-yis called a little girl he saw near by, and said to her: \"Child, I am going into that lodge to let that man-eater kill and eat me. Watch close, therefore, and when you can get hold of one of my bones, take it out and call all the dogs, and when they have all come up to you, throw it down and cry out, 'K[)u]t-o'-yis, the dogs are eating your bones!'\"  Then K[)u]t-o'-yis entered the lodge, and when the man-eater saw him, he cried out, \"_O'ki, O'ki,\"_ and seemed glad to see him, for he was a fat young man. The man-eater took a large knife, and went up to K[)u]t-o'-yis, and cut his throat, and put him into a great stone kettle to cook. When the meat was cooked, he drew the kettle from the fire, and ate the body, limb by limb, until it was all eaten up.  Then the little girl, who was watching, came up to him, and said, \"Pity me, man-eater, my mother is hungry and asks you for those bones.\" So the old man bunched them up together and handed them to her. She took them out, and called all the dogs to her, and threw the bones down to the dogs, crying out, \"Look out, K[)u]t-o'-yis; the dogs are eating you!\" and when she said that, K[)u]t-o'-yis arose from the pile of bones.  Again he went into the lodge, and when the man-eater saw him, he cried out, \"How, how, how! the fat young man has survived,\" and seemed surprised. Again he took his knife and cut K[)u]t-o'-yis' throat, and threw him into the kettle. Again, when the meat was cooked, he ate it up, and again the little girl asked for the bones, which he gave her; and, taking them out, she threw them to the dogs, crying, \"K[)u]t-o'-yis, the dogs are eating you!\" and K[)u]t-o'-yis again arose from the bones.  When the man-eater had cooked him four times, he again went into the lodge, and, seizing the man-eater, he threw him into the boiling kettle, and his wives and children too, and boiled them to death.  The man-eater was the seventh and last of the bad animals and people who were destroyed by K[)u]t-o'-yis.    THE BAD WIFE   I  There was once a man who had but one wife. He was not a chief, but a very brave warrior. He was rich, too, so he could have had plenty of wives if he wished; but he loved his wife very much, and did not want any more. He was very good to this woman. She always wore the best clothes that could be found. If any other woman had a fine buckskin dress, or something very pretty, the man would buy it for her.  It was summer. The berries were ripe, and the woman kept saying to her husband, \"Let us go and pick some berries for winter.\" \"No,\" replied the man. \"It is dangerous now. The enemy is travelling all around.\" But still the woman kept teasing him to go. So one day he told her to get ready. Some other women went, too. They all went on horseback, for the berries were a long way from camp. When they got to the place, the man told the women to keep near their horses all the time. He would go up on a butte near by and watch. \"Be careful,\" he said. \"Keep by your horses, and if you see me signal, throw away your berries, get on your horses and ride towards camp as fast as you can.\"  They had not picked many berries before the man saw a war party coming. He signalled the women, and got on his horse and rode towards them. It happened that this man and his wife both had good horses, but the others, all old women, rode slow old travois horses, and the enemy soon overtook and killed them. Many kept on after the two on good horses, and after a while the woman's horse began to get tired; so she asked her husband to let her ride on his horse with him. The woman got up behind him, and they went on again. The horse was a very powerful one, and for a while went very fast; but two persons make a heavy load, and soon the enemy began to gain on them. The man was now in a bad plight; the enemy were overtaking him, and the woman holding him bound his arms so that he could not use his bow.  \"Get off,\" he said to her. \"The enemy will not kill you. You are too young and pretty. Some one of them will take you, and I will get a big party of our people and rescue you.\"  \"No, no,\" cried the woman; \"let us die here together.\"  \"Why die?\" cried the man. \"We are yet young, and may live a long time together. If you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11547"],["title","Blackfoot Lodge Tales: The Story of a Prairie People (#8)"],["body","on't get off, they will soon catch us and kill me, and then they will take you anyhow. Get off, and in only a short time I will get you back.\"  \"No, no,\" again cried the woman; \"I will die here with you.\"  \"Crazy person!\" cried the man, and with a quick jerk he threw the woman off.  As he said, the enemy did not kill her. The first one who came up counted _coup_ and took her. The man, now that his horse was lightened, easily ran away from the war party, and got safe to camp.   II  Then there was great mourning. The relatives of the old women who had been killed, cut their hair and cried. The man, too, cut off his hair and mourned. He knew that his wife was not killed, but he felt very badly because he was separated from her. He painted himself black, and walked all through the camp, crying. His wife had many relations, and some of them went to the man and said: \"We pity you very much. We mourn, too, for our sister. But come. Take courage. We will go with you, and try to get her back.\"  \"It is good,\" replied the man. \"I feel as if I should die, stopping uselessly here. Let us start soon.\"  That evening they got ready, and at daylight started out on foot. There were seven of them in all. The husband, five middle-aged men, the woman's relations, and a young man, her own young brother. He was a very pretty boy. His hair was longer than any other person's in camp.  They soon found the trail of the war party, and followed it for some days. At last they came to the Big River,[1] and there, on the other side, they saw many lodges. They crept down a coulée into the valley, and hid in a small piece of timber just opposite the camp. Toward evening the man said: \"_Kyi_, my brothers. To-night I will swim across and look all through the camp for my wife. If I do not find her, I will cache and look again to-morrow evening. But if I do not return before daylight of the second night, then you will know I am killed. Then you will do as you think best. Maybe you will want to take revenge. Maybe you will go right back home. That will be as your hearts feel.\"  [Footnote 1: Missouri River.]  As soon as it was dark, he swam across the river and went all about through the camp, peeping in through the doorways of the lodges, but he did not see his wife. Still, he knew she must be there. He had followed the trail of the party to this place. They had not killed her on the way. He kept looking in at the lodges until it was late, and the people let the fires go out and went to bed. Then the man went down to where the women got their water from the river. Everywhere along the stream was a cut bank, but in one place a path of steps had been made down to the water's edge. Near this path, he dug a hole in the bank and crawled into it, closing up the entrance, except one small hole, through which he could look, and watch the people who came to the river.  As soon as it was daylight, the women began to come for water. _Tum, tum, tum, tum_, he could hear their footsteps as they came down the path, and he looked eagerly at every one. All day long the people came and went,--the young and old; and the children played about near him. He saw many strange people that day. It was now almost sunset, and he began to think that he would not see his wife there. _Tum, tum, tum, tum_, another woman came down the steps, and stopped at the water's edge. Her dress was strange, but he thought he knew the form. She turned her head and looked down the river, and he saw her face. It was his wife. He pushed away the dirt, crawled out, went to her and kissed her. \"_Kyi_,\" he said, \"hurry, and let us swim across the river. Five of your relations and your own young brother are waiting for us in that piece of timber.\"  \"Wait,\" replied his wife. \"These people have given me a great many pretty things. Let me go back. When it is night I will gather them up, steal a horse, and cross over to you.\"  \"No, no,\" cried the man. \"Let the pretty things go; come, let us cross at once.\"  \"Pity me,\" said the woman. \"Let me go and get my things. I will surely come to-night. I speak the truth.\"  \"How do you speak the truth?\"[1] asked her husband.  [Footnote 1: Blackfoot--_Tsa-ki-an-ist-o-man-i?_ i.e., How you like truth?]  \"That my relations there across the river may be safe and live long, I speak the truth.\"  \"Go then,\" said the man, \"and get your things. I will cross the river now.\" He went up on the bank and walked down the river, keeping his face hidden. No one noticed him, or if they did, they thought he belonged to the camp. As soon as he had passed the first bend, he swam across the river, and soon joined his relations.  \"I have seen my wife,\" he said to them. \"She will come over as soon as it is dark. I let her go back to get some things that were given her.\"  \"You are crazy,\" said one of the men, \"very crazy. She already loves this new man she has, or she would not have wanted to go back.\"  \"Stop that,\" said the husband; \"do not talk bad of her. She will surely come.\"   III  The woman went back to her lodge with the water, and, sitting down near the fireplace, she began to act very strangely. She took up pieces of charred wood, dirt, and ashes in her hands and ate them, and made queer noises.  \"What is it?\" asked the man who had taken her for a wife. \"What is the matter with you?\" He spoke in signs.  The woman also spoke in signs. She answered him: \"The Sun told me that there are seven persons across the river in that piece of timber. Five of them are middle-aged, another is a young boy with very long hair, another is a man who mourns. His hair is cut short.\"  The Snake did not know what to do, so he called in some chiefs and old men to advise with him. They thought that the woman might be very strong medicine. At all events, it would be a good thing to go and look. So the news was shouted out, and in a short time all the warriors had mounted their best horses, and started across the river. It was then almost dark, so they surrounded the piece of timber, and waited for morning to begin the search.  \"_Kyi_,\" said one of the woman's relations to her husband. \"Did I not speak the truth? You see now what that woman has done for us.\"  At daylight the poor husband strung his bow, took a handful of arrows from his quiver, and said: \"This is my fault. I have brought you to this. It is right that I should die first,\" and he started to go out of the timber.  \"Wait,\" said the eldest relative. \"It shall not be so. I am the first to go. I cannot stay back to see my brother die. You shall go out last.\" So he jumped out of the brush, and began shooting his arrows, but was soon killed.  \"My brother is too far on the road alone,\"[1] cried another relation, and he jumped out and fought, too. What use, one against so many? The Snakes soon had his scalp.  [Footnote 1: Meaning that his brother's spirit, or shadow, was travelling alone the road to the Sand Hills, and that he must overtake him.]  So they went out, one after another, and at last the husband was alone. He rushed out very brave, and shot his arrows as fast as he could. \"Hold!\" cried the Snake man to his people. \"Do not kill him; catch him. This is the one my wife said to bring back alive. See! his hair is cut short.\" So, when the man had shot away all his arrows, they seized and tied him, and, taking the scalps of the others, returned to camp.  They took the prisoner into the lodge where his wife was. His hands were tied behind his back, and they tied his feet, too. He could not move.  As soon as the man saw his wife, he cried. He was not afraid. He did not care now how soon he died. He cried because he was thinking of all the trouble and death this woman had caused. \"What have I done to you,\" he asked his wife, \"that you should treat me this way? Did I not always use you well? I never struck you. I never made you work hard.\"  \"What does he say?\" asked the Snake man.  \"He says,\" replied the woman, \"that when you are done smoking, you must knock the ashes and fire out of your pipe on his breast.\"  The Snake was not a bad-hearted man, but he thought now that this woman had strong medicine, that she had Sun power; so he thought that everything must be done as she said. When the man had finished smoking, he emptied the pipe on the Piegan's breast, and the fire burned him badly.  Then the poor man cried again, not from the pain, but to think what a bad heart this woman had. Again he spoke to her. \"You cannot be a person,\" he said. \"I think you are some fearful animal, changed to look like a woman.\"  \"What is he saying now?\" asked the Snake.  \"He wants some boiling water poured on his head,\" replied the woman.  \"It shall be as he says,\" said the Snake; and he had his women heat some water. When it was ready, one of them poured a little of it here and there on the captive's head and shoulders. Wherever the hot water touched, the hair came out and the skin peeled off. The pain was so bad that the Piegan nearly fainted. When he revived, he said to his wife: \"Pity me. I have suffered enough. Let them kill me now. Let me hurry to join those who are already travelling to the Sand Hills.\"  The woman turned to the Snake chief, and said, \"The man says that he wants you to give him to the Sun.\"  \"It is good,\" said the Snake. \"To-morrow we move camp. Before we leave here, we will give him to the Sun.\"  There was an old woman in this camp who lived all alone, in a little lodge of her own. She had some friends and relations, but she said she liked to live by herself. She had heard that a Piegan had been captured, and went to the lodge where he was. When she saw them pour the boiling water on him, she cried and felt badly. This old woman had a very good heart. She went home and lay down by her dog, and kept crying, she felt so sorry for this poor man. Pretty soon she heard people shouting out the orders of the chief. They said: \"Listen! listen! To-morrow we move camp. Get ready now and pack up everything. Before we go, the Piegan man will be given to"]]]
