We have no conception of either Subject or      Object, either Mind or Matter, except as something to which      we refer our sensations, and whatever other feelings we are      conscious of. _The very existence of them both, so far as      cognizable by us, consists only in the relation they      respectively bear to our states of feeling._ Their relation      to each other is only the relation between those two      relations. The immediate correlatives are, not the pair,      _Object, Subject,_ but the two pairs, Object, _Sensation      objectively considered_--Subject, _Sensation subjectively      considered_. The reason why this is overlooked might easily      be shown, and would furnish a good illustration of that      important part of the Laws of Association, which may be      termed the Laws of Obliviscence.'  This chapter, on the Primary Qualities of Matter, controverts the opinion of Sir W. Hamilton, that extension, as consisting of co-existent _partes extra partes_, is immediately and necessarily apprehended by our consciousness. It cites, as well as confirms, the copious proof given by Professor Bain (in his work on the Senses and the Intellect) that our conception of extension is derived from our muscular sensibility: that our sensation of _muscular motion impeded_ constitutes that of filled space: that our conception of extension, as an aggregate of co-existent parts, arises from the sense of sight, which comprehends a great number of parts in a succession so rapid as to be confounded with simultaneity--and which not only becomes the symbol of muscular and tactile succession, but even acquires such ascendancy as to supersede both of them in our consciousness. Confirmation is here given to this important doctrine, not merely by observations from Mr Mill himself, but also from the very curious narrative, discovered and produced by Sir W. Hamilton, out of a work of the German philosopher, Platner. Platner instituted a careful examination of a man born blind, and ascertained that this man did not conceive extension as an aggregate of simultaneous parts, but as a series of sensations experienced or to be experienced in succession--(pp. 232, 233). The case reported from Platner both corroborates the theory of Professor Bain, and receives its proper interpretation from that theory; while it is altogether adverse to the doctrine of Sir W. Hamilton--as is also another case, which he cites from Maine de Biran:--       'It gives a very favourable idea of Sir W. Hamilton's      sincerity and devotion to truth (remarks Mr Mill, p. 247),      that he should have drawn from obscurity, and made generally      known, two cases so unfavourable to his own opinions.'  We think this remark perfectly just; and we would point out besides, in appreciating Sir W. Hamilton's merits, that his appetite for facts was useful to philosophy, as well as his appetite for speculation. But the person whose usefulness to philosophy we prefer to bring into the foreground, is Platner himself. He spent three weeks in patient examination of this blind man, and the tenor of his report proves that his sagacity in interpreting facts was equal to his patience in collecting them. The rarity of all such careful and premeditated observation of the facts of mind, appears to us one main reason why (what Mr Mill calls) the _psychological_ theory finds so little acceptance; and why those who maintain that what now seems a mental integer was once a multiplicity of separate mental fragments, can describe the antecedent steps of the change only as a _latens processus_, which the reader never fully understands, and often will not admit. Every man's mind is gradually built up from infancy to maturity; the process is always going on before our eyes, yet the stages of it--especially the earliest stages, the most pregnant with instruction--are never studied and put on record by observers trained in inductive logic, knowing beforehand what they ought to look for as the _sine quâ non_ for proving or disproving any proposed theory. Such cases as that cited by Platner--cases of one marked congenital defect of sense, enabling us to apply the Method of Difference--are always within reach; but few Platners are found to scrutinize and record them. Historians of science describe to us the laborious and multiplied observations, and the elaborate precaution for ensuring accuracy of observation, which recent chemical and physical inquirers have found indispensable for the establishment of their results. We cannot, therefore, be surprised that mental philosophers, dealing with facts even more obscure, and careless about enlarging, varying, authenticating their records of particular facts, should have had little success in establishing any results at all.  But if even those, who adopt the psychological theory, have been remiss in the observation of particular mental facts,--those who deny the theory have been far more than remiss; they have been blind to obvious facts contradicting the principles which they lay down. Mr Mill, in chap, xiv., deals with this denial, common to Mr Mansel with Sir W. Hamilton. That philosophers so eminent as both of them should declare confidently--'what I cannot but think must be _à priori_, or original to thought; it cannot be engendered by experience upon custom' (p. 264)--appears to us as extraordinary as it does to Mr Mill. Though no one ever surpassed Sir W. Hamilton in large acquaintance with the actual diversities of human belief, and human incapacities of believing--yet he never seems to have thought of bringing this acquaintance into account, when he assured the students in his lecture-room, that custom, experience, indissoluble association, were altogether insufficient to engender a felt necessity of believing. Such forgetfulness of well-known mental facts cannot be reproached to the advocates of the psychological theory.  In chap. xv. Mr Mill examines Sir W. Hamilton's doctrine on unconscious mental modifications. He points out the confused manner in which Sir W. Hamilton has conceived _mental latency_, as well as the inconclusive character of the reasoning whereby he refutes the following doctrine of Dugald Stewart--That in the most rapid trains of association, each separate item must have been successively present to consciousness, though for a time too short to leave any memory. Sir W. Hamilton thinks that the separate items may pass, and often do pass, unconsciously; which opinion Mr Mill also, though not approving his reasons, is inclined to adopt.       'I am myself inclined (p. 285) to admit unconscious mental      modifications, in the only sense in which I can attach any      very distinct meaning to them--namely, unconscious      modifications of the nerves. It may well be believed that      the apparently suppressed links in a chain of association,      those which Sir W. Hamilton considers as latent, really are      so: that they are not even momentarily felt, the chain of      causation being continued only physically--by one organic      state of the nerves succeeding another so rapidly, that the      state of mental consciousness appropriate to each is not      produced.'  Mr Mill gives various illustrations in support of this doctrine. He at the same time calls attention to a valuable lecture of Sir W. Hamilton's, the thirty-second lecture on Metaphysics; especially to the instructive citation from Cardaillac contained therein, noting the important fact, which descriptions of the Law of Association often keep out of sight--that the suggestive agency of Association is carried on, not by single antecedents raising up single consequents, but by a mass of antecedents raising up simultaneously a mass of consequents, among which attention is very unequally distributed.  We shall say little upon Mr Mill's remarks on Sir W. Hamilton's Theory of Causation--(chap. xvi.). This theory appears to Mr Mill absurd; while the theory of Mr Mill (continued from Hume, Brown, and James Mill) on the same subject, appears to Sir W. Hamilton insufficient and unsatisfactory--'professing to explain the phenomenon of causality, but, previously to explanation, evacuating the phenomenon of all that desiderates explanation'--(p. 295). For ourselves we embrace the theory of Mr Mill:[13] yet we are aware that the remark just cited from Sir W. Hamilton represents the dissatisfaction entertained towards it by many objectors. The unscientific and antiscientific yearnings, prevalent among mankind, lead them to put questions which no sound theory of Causation will answer; and they are ready to visit and trust any oracle which professes to deliver a confident affirmative solution of such questions. Among all the terms employed by metaphysicians, none is used in a greater variety of meanings than the term Cause.  In Mr Mill's next chapter (xvi.) he comments on Sir W. Hamilton's doctrine of Concepts or General Notions. There are portions of this chapter with which we agree less than with most other parts of the volume; especially with his marked hostility to the term _Concept_, and the reasons given for it, which reasons appear to us not very consistent with what he has himself said in the 'System of Logic,' Book IV. chap. ii. § 1--3. The term _Concept_ has no necessary connection with the theory called Conceptualism. It is equally available to designate the idea called up by a general name, as understood either by Mr Bailey or by James Mill. We think it useful as an equivalent to the German word _Begriff_, which sense Sir W. Hamilton has in view when he introduces it, though he does not always adhere to his profession. And when Mr Mill says (p. 331)--       'I consider it nothing less than a misfortune, that the      words Concept, General Notion, or any other phrase to      express the supposed mental modification corresponding to a      general name, should ever have been invented.'  we dissent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12002"],["title","Review of the Work of Mr John Stuart Mill Entitled, 'Examination of Sir William (#7)"],["body","his opinion. To talk of 'the Concept of an individual,' however, as Mr Mansel does (pp. 338, 339), is improper and inconsistent with the purpose for which the name is given.  We are more fully in harmony with Mr Mill in his two next chapters (xviii. et seq.) on Judgment and Reasoning; which are among the best chapters in this volume. He there combats and overthrows the theory of Reasoning laid down by Sir W. Hamilton; but we doubt the propriety of his calling this 'the Conceptualist theory' (pp. 367, 368); since it has nothing to do with Conceptualism, in the special sense of antithesis to Realism and Nominalism,--but is, in fact, the theory of the Syllogism as given in the Analytics of Aristotle, and generally admitted since. Not merely Conceptualists, but (to use Mr Mill's own language, p. 366) 'nearly all the writers on logic, taught a theory of the science too small and narrow to contain their own facts.' Such, indeed, was the theory constantly taught until the publication of Mr Mill's 'System of Logic;' the first two books of which corrected it, by arguments which are reinforced and amplified in these two chapters on Judgment and Reasoning, as well as in the two chapters next following--chaps, xx. and xxi.--('Is Logic the Science of the Forms of Thought--On the Fundamental Laws of Thought.') The contrast which is there presented, in many different ways, between the limited theory of logic taught by Sir W. Hamilton and Mr Mansel, and the enlarged theory of Mr Mill, is instructive in a high degree. We consider Mr Mill as the real preserver of all that is valuable in Formal Logic, from the unfortunate consequences of an erroneous estimate, brought upon it through the exaggerated pretensions of logicians. When Sir W. Hamilton contrasts it pointedly with physical science (of which he talks with a sort of supercilious condescension, in one of the worst passages of his writings, p. 401)--when all its apparent fruits were produced in the shape of ingenious but barren verbal technicalities--what hope could be entertained that Formal Logic could hold its ground in the estimation of the recent generation of scientific men? Mr Mill has divested it of that assumed demonstrative authority which Bacon called 'regere res per syllogismum;' but he has at the same time given to it a firm root amidst the generalities of objective science. He has shown that in the great problem of Evidence or Proof, the Laws of Formal Logic, though bearing only on one part of the entire procedure, yet bear upon one essential part, proper to be studied separately: and that the maintenance of consistency between our affirmations (which is the only special province of Formal Logic), has great importance and value as a part of the process necessary for ascertaining and vindicating their truth, or exposing their character when false or uncertified--but no importance or value except as a part of that larger exigency.  While Mr Mill was amending the Syllogistic theory so as to ensure for Formal Logic its legitimate place among the essentials of scientific procedure, Sir W. Hamilton was at the same time enlarging it on its technical side, in two modes which are highly esteemed both by himself and by others: 1. The recognition of two kinds of Syllogisms; one in Extension, the other in Comprehension: 2. The doctrine of the Quantification of the Predicate.--Both these novelties are here criticised by Mr Mill in chapter xxii., which we recommend the reader to peruse conjointly with Lectures 15 and 16 of Sir W. Hamilton on Logic.  Now whereas the main objection, by which the study of the syllogistic logic has been weighed down and discredited in modern times, is this, that it encumbers the memory with formal distinctions, having no useful application to the real process and purposes of reasoning--the procedure of Sir W. Hamilton might almost lead us to imagine that he himself was trying to aggravate that objection to the uttermost. He introduces a variety of new canons (classifying Syllogisms as Extensive and Intensive, by a distinction founded on the double quantity of notions, in Extension and in Comprehension) which he intimates that all former logicians have neglected--while it plainly appears, even on his own showing, that the difference between syllogisms, in respect to these two sorts of quantity, is of no practical value; and that 'we can always change a categorical syllogism of the one quantity into a categorical syllogism of the other, by reversing the order of the two premises, and by reversing the meaning of the copula' (Lect. xvi. p. 296); nay, that every syllogism is already a syllogism in both quantities (Mill, p. 431). Against these useless ceremonial reforms of Sir W. Hamilton, we may set the truly philosophical explanation here given by Mr Mill of the meaning of propositions.       'All judgments' (he says--p. 423), 'except where both the      terms are proper names, are really judgments in      Comprehension; though it is customary, and the natural      tendency of the mind, to express most of them in terms of      Extension. In other words, we never really predicate      anything but attributes; though, in the usage of language,      we commonly predicate them by means of words which are names      of concrete objects--because' (p. 426)--'we have no other      convenient and compact mode of speaking. Most attributes,      and nearly all large bundles of attributes, have no names of      their own. We can only name them by a circumlocution. We are      accustomed to speak of attributes, not by names given to      themselves, but by means of the names which they give to the      objects they are attributes of.' 'All our ordinary      judgments' (p. 428) 'are in Comprehension only; Extension      not being thought of. But we may, if we please, make the      Extension of our general terms an express object of thought.      When I judge that all oxen ruminate, I have nothing in my      thoughts but the attributes and their co-existence. But when      by reflection I perceive what the proposition implies, I      remark that other things may ruminate besides oxen, and that      the unknown multitude of things which ruminate form a mass,      with which the unknown multitude of things having the      attributes of oxen is either identical or is wholly      comprised in it. Which of these two is the truth I may not      know, and if I did, took no notice of it when I assented to      the proposition, all oxen ruminate; but I perceive, on      consideration, that one or other of them must be true.      Though I had not this in my mind when I affirmed that all      oxen ruminate, I can have it now; I can make the concrete      objects denoted by each of the two names an object of      thought, as a collective though indefinite aggregate; in      other words, I can make the Extension of the names (or      notions) an object of direct consciousness. When I do this,      I perceive that this operation introduces no new fact, but      is only a different mode of contemplating the very fact      which I had previously expressed by the words, all oxen      ruminate. The fact is the same, but the mode of      contemplating it is different. There is thus in all      Propositions a judgment concerning attributes (called by Sir      W. Hamilton a Judgment in Comprehension) which we make as a      matter of course; and a possible judgment in or concerning      Extension, which we _may_ make, and which will be true if      the former is true.'  From the lucid explanation here cited (and from a following paragraph too long to describe p. 433), we see that there is no real distinction between Judgments in Comprehension and Judgments in Extension; that the _appearance_ of distinction between them arises from the customary mode of enunciation, which custom is here accounted for; that the addition to the theory of the Syllogism, for which Sir W. Hamilton takes credit, is alike troublesome and unprofitable.  The like may also be said about his other innovation, the Quantification of the Predicate. Still more extensive are the changes (as stated by himself) which this innovation would introduce in the canons of Syllogism. Indeed, when we read his language (Appendix to 'Lectures on Logic,' pp. 291--297) censuring generally the prior logicians from Aristotle downwards, and contending that 'more than half the value of logic had been lost' by their manner of handling it--we may appreciate the magnitude of the reform which he believed himself to be introducing. The larger the reform, the more it behoved him to be sure of the ground on which he was proceeding. But on this point we remark a serious deficiency. After laying down, with appropriate emphasis, the valuable logical postulate, _to state explicitly what is thought implicitly_, on which, Sir W. Hamilton says,       'Logic ever insists, but which logicians have never fairly      obeyed--it follows that logically we ought to take into      account the quantity, _always understood in thought_, but      usually, and for manifest reasons, elided in expression, not      only of the _subject_, but also of the _predicate_, of a      judgment.'--('Discussions on Philos.,' p. 614.)  Here Sir W. Hamilton assumes that the quantity of the predicate is always understood in thought; and the same assumption is often repeated, in the Appendix to his 'Lectures on Logic,' p. 291 and elsewhere, as if it was alike obvious and incontestable. Now it is precisely on this point that issue is here taken with Sir W. Hamilton. Mr Mill denies altogether (p. 437) that the quantity of the predicate is always understood or present in thought, and appeals to every reader's consciousness for an answer:--       'Does he, when he judges that all oxen ruminate, advert even      in the minutest degree to the question, whether there is      anything else that ruminates? Is this consideration at all      in his thoughts, any more than any other"]]]
