But the Hostess had got out of it the opening she wanted, and she said:  \"At any rate, it is wonderful what women have done in the war--\"  \"And are doing,\" echoed the Half Man with the Moon Face.  And then it was that the Hostess had said that surely every one must admit women are equal to men and the topic of the sexes was started. All the women had been waiting for it, anyway. It is the only topic that women care about. Even men can stand it provided that fifty per cent or more of the women present are handsome enough to justify it.  \"I hardly see how, after all that has happened, any rational person could deny for a moment,\" continued the Hostess, looking straight at her husband and his Heavy Business Friend, \"that women are equal and even superior to men. Surely our brains are just as good?\" and she gave an almost bitter laugh.  \"Don't you think perhaps--?\" began the Smooth Gentleman.  \"No, I don't,\" said the Hostess. \"You're going to say that we are inferior in things like mathematics or in logical reasoning. We are not. But, after all, the only reason why we are is because of training. Think of the thousands of years that men have been trained. Answer me that?\"  \"Well, might it not be--?\" began the Smooth Gentleman.  \"I don't think so for a moment,\" said the Hostess. \"I think if we'd only been trained as men have for the last two or three thousand years our brains would be just as well trained for the things they were trained for as they would have been now for the things we have been trained for and in that case wouldn't have. Don't you agree with me,\" she said, turning to the Chief Lady Guest, whom she suddenly remembered, \"that, after all, we think more clearly?\"  Here the Interesting Man, who had been silent longer than an Interesting Man can, without apoplexy, began:  \"I remember once saying in London to Sir Charles Doosey--\"  But the Chief Lady Guest refused to be checked.  \"We've been gathering some rather interesting statistics,\" she said, speaking very firmly, syllable by syllable, \"on that point at our Settlement. We have measured the heads of five hundred factory girls, making a chart of them, you know, and the feet of five hundred domestic servants--\"  \"And don't you find--\" began the Smooth Gentleman.  \"No,\" said the Chief Lady Guest firmly, \"we do not. But I was going to say that when we take our measurements and reduce them to a scale of a hundred--I think you understand me--\"  \"Ah, but come, now,\" interrupted the Interesting man, \"there's nothing really more deceitful than anthropometric measures. I remember once saying (in London) to Sir Robert Bittell--_the_ Sir Robert Bittell, you know--\"  Here everybody murmured, \"Oh, yes,\" except the Heavy Host and his Heavy Friend, who with all their sins were honest men.  \"I said, 'Sir Robert, I want your frank opinion, your very frank opinion--'\"  But here there was a slight interruption. The Soft Lady accidentally dropped a bangle from her wrist on to the floor. Now all through the dinner she had hardly said anything, but she had listened for twenty minutes (from the grapefruit to the fish) while the Interesting Man had told her about his life in Honduras (it is pronounced Hondooras), and for another twenty while the Smooth Gentleman, who was a barrister, had discussed himself as a pleader. And when each of the men had begun to speak in the general conversation, she had looked deep into their faces as if hanging on to their words. So when she dropped her bangle two of the men leaped from their chairs to get it, and the other three made a sort of struggle as they sat. By the time it was recovered and replaced upon her arm (a very beautiful arm), the Interesting Man was side-tracked and the Chief Lady Guest, who had gone on talking during the bangle hunt, was heard saying:  \"Entirely so. That seems to me the greatest difficulty before us. So few men are willing to deal with the question with perfect sincerity.\"  She laid emphasis on the word and the Half Man with the Moon Face took his cue from it and threw a pose of almost painful sincerity.  \"Why is it,\" continued the Chief Lady Guest, \"that men always insist on dealing with us just as if we were playthings, just so many dressed-up dolls?\"  Here the Debutante immediately did a doll.  \"If a woman is attractive and beautiful,\" the lady went on, \"so much the better.\" (She had no intention of letting go of the doll business entirely.) \"But surely you men ought to value us as something more than mere dolls?\"  She might have pursued the topic, but at this moment the Smooth Gentleman, who made a rule of standing in all round, and had broken into a side conversation with the Silent Host, was overheard to say something about women's sense of humour.  The table was in a turmoil in a moment, three of the ladies speaking at once. To deny a woman's sense of humour is the last form of social insult.  \"I entirely disagree with you,\" said the Chief Lady Guest, speaking very severely. \"I know it from my own case, from my own sense of humour and from observation. Last week, for example, we measured no less than seventy-five factory girls--\"  \"Well, I'm sure,\" said the Lady-with-the-Bust, \"I don't know what men mean by our not having a sense of humour. I'm sure I have. I know I went last week to a vaudeville, and I just laughed all through. Of course I can't read Mark Twain, or anything like that, but then I don't call that funny, do you?\" she concluded, turning to the Hostess.  But the Hostess, feeling somehow that the ground was dangerous, had already risen, and in a moment more the ladies had floated out of the room and upstairs to the drawing-room, where they spread themselves about in easy chairs in billows of pretty coloured silk.  \"How charming it is,\" the Chief Lady Guest began, \"to find men coming so entirely to our point of view! Do you know it was so delightful to-night: I hardly heard a word of dissent or contradiction.\"  Thus they talked; except the Soft Lady, who had slipped into a seat by herself with an album over her knees, and with an empty chair on either side of her. There she waited.  Meantime, down below, the men had shifted into chairs to one end of the table and the Heavy Host was shoving cigars at them, thick as ropes, and passing the port wine, with his big fist round the neck of the decanter. But for his success in life he could have had a place as a bar tender anywhere.  None of them spoke till the cigars were well alight.  Then the Host said very deliberately, taking each word at his leisure, with smoke in between:  \"Of course--this--suffrage business--\"  \"Tommyrot!\" exclaimed the Smooth Gentleman, with great alacrity, his mask entirely laid aside.  \"Damn foolishness,\" gurgled the Heavy Business Friend, sipping his port.  \"Of course you can't really discuss it with women,\" murmured the Host.  \"Oh, no,\" assented all the others. Even the Half Man sipped his wine and turned traitor, there being no one to see.  \"You see,\" said the Host, \"if my wife likes to go to meetings and be on committees, why, I don't stop her.\"  \"Neither do I mine,\" said the Heavy Friend. \"It amuses her, so I let her do it.\" His wife, the Lady-with-the-Bust, was safely out of hearing.  \"I remember once,\" began the Interesting Man, \"saying to\"--he paused a moment, for the others were looking at him--\"another man that if women did get the vote they'd never use it, anyway. All they like is being talked about for not getting it.\"  After which, having exhausted the Woman Question, the five men turned to such bigger subjects as the fall in sterling exchange and the President's seventeenth note to Germany.  Then presently they went upstairs. And when they reached the door of the drawing-room a keen observer, or, indeed, any kind of observer, might have seen that all five of them made an obvious advance towards the two empty seats beside the Soft Lady.     VII. The Grass Bachelor's Guide.      With sincere Apologies to the Ladies' Periodicals  There are periods in the life of every married man when he is turned for the time being into a grass bachelor.  This happens, for instance, in the summer time when his wife is summering by the sea, and he himself is simmering in the city. It happens also in the autumn when his wife is in Virginia playing golf in order to restore her shattered nerves after the fatigues of the seaside. It occurs again in November when his wife is in the Adirondacks to get the benefit of the altitude, and later on through the winter when she is down in Florida to get the benefit of the latitude. The breaking up of the winter being, notoriously, a trying time on the system, any reasonable man is apt to consent to his wife's going to California. In the later spring, the season of the bursting flowers and the young buds, every woman likes to be with her mother in the country. It is not fair to stop her.  It thus happens that at various times of the year a great number of men, unable to leave their business, are left to their own resources as housekeepers in their deserted houses and apartments. It is for their benefit that I have put together these hints on housekeeping for men. It may be that in composing them I owe something to the current number of the leading women's magazines. If so, I need not apologise. I am sure that in these days We Men all feel that We Men and We Women are so much alike, or at least those of us who call ourselves so, that we need feel no jealousy when We Men and We Women are striving each, or both, in the same direction if in opposite ways. I hope that I make myself clear. I am sure I do.  So I feel that if We Men, who are left alone in our houses and apartments in the summer-time, would only set ourselves to it, we could make life not only a little brighter for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11506"],["title","The Old Bell of Independence; Or, Philadelphia in 1776 (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team.

Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1851, by LINDSAY AND BLAKISTON, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.    PREFACE.  To awaken in the minds of all Americans that veneration of the patriots and heroes of the War of Independence, and that emulation of their noble example which is so necessary to the maintenance of our liberties, are the objects of this little work. Every day's developments illustrate the importance of these objects. In the enjoyment of the freedom and prosperity of our country, we are apt to under-rate the means by which that enjoyment was secured to us, and to forget the men who worked for that end. A knowledge of the toils and sufferings of the noble-hearted fathers of the Revolution is the best preventative, or curative, for this \"falling off.\" War, clothed as it is, with horrors, is to be condemned, and the spirit which leads to it should be driven from the breasts of men. But generous devotion, strength of resolution, and far-reaching skill, are things to be commended and imitated wherever displayed. In these pages, will be found stories of the chief men of the Revolution, so connected, by the manner in which they are narrated, as to give a general interest to them--\"The Old Bell of Independence\" being the rallying point of the veteran story-tellers.

INTRODUCTION.  It was a season of unparalleled enthusiasm and rejoicing, when General Lafayette, the friend and supporter of American Independence, responded to the wishes of the people of the United States, and came to see their prosperity, and to hear their expressions of gratitude. The national heart beat joyfully in anticipation; and one long, loud, and free shout of welcome was heard throughout the land.  Arriving at New York in August, 1824, General Lafayette journeyed through the Eastern States, receiving such tokens of affection as the people had extended to no other man except Washington, and then returned southward. On the 28th of September, he entered Philadelphia, the birth-place of the Declaration of Independence, the greater part of the population coming out to receive and welcome him. A large procession was formed, and thirteen triumphal arches erected in the principal streets through which the procession passed.  After General Lafayette himself, the most remarkable objects in the procession were four large open cars, resembling tents, each containing forty veterans of the struggle for independence. No one could, without emotion, behold these winter-locked patriots, whose eyes, dimmed by age, poured forth tears of joy at their unexpected happiness in once more meeting an old commander, and joining in the expressions of gratitude to him.  After passing through the principal streets, General Lafayette was conducted into the hall of the State-House, where the old Continental Congress had assembled, and where the immortal Declaration of Independence was signed. Here the nation's guest was received formally on behalf of the citizens by the mayor, and then the people were admitted to take him by the hand. At night there was a splendid illumination; and crowds of people traversed the streets, singing and celebrating the exploits of the champion of liberty and the friend of America.  On one of the days succeeding Lafayette's grand entry into the city, he received, in the Hall of Independence, the veteran soldiers of the Revolution who had come to the city, and those who were residents. One by one these feeble old men came up and took the General by the hand, and to each he had some reminiscence to recall, or some congratulation to offer. Heroes of Brandy wine, Germantown, Trenton, Princeton, Monmouth, and other fields, were there; some with scars to show, and all much suffering to relate. The old patriotic fire was kindled in their breasts, and beamed from their furrowed countenances, as memory flew back to the time that proved their truth and love of liberty. One had been under the command of the fiery Wayne, and shared his dangers with a spirit as dauntless; another had served with the cool and skilful Greene, and loved to recall some exploit in which the Quaker general had displayed his genius; another had followed the lead of Lafayette himself, when a mere youth, at Brandywine: everything conspired to render this interview of the General and the veteran soldiers as touching and as interesting as any recorded by history, or invented by fiction.  After the reception of the veterans, one of them proposed to go up into the belfry, and see the old bell which proclaimed liberty \"to all the land, and to all the nations thereof.\" Lafayette and a few others accompanied the proposal by expressing a wish to see that interesting relic. With great difficulty, some of the old men were conducted up to the belfry, and there they beheld the bell still swinging. Lafayette was much gratified at the sight, as it awakened his old enthusiasm to think of the period when John Adams and his bold brother patriots dared to assert the principles of civil liberty, and to proclaim the independence of their country. Old John Harmar, one of the veteran soldiers who had been in Philadelphia when the Declaration was proclaimed, and who again shook hands with his old brothers in arms, gave vent to his thoughts and feelings as he stood looking at the bell.  \"Ah! that's the trumpet that told the Britishers a tale of vengeance! My memory's not so bad but I can recollect the day that old bell was rung for independence! This city presented a very different appearance in those days. It was a small town. Every body was expectin' that the king's troops would be comin' here soon, and would sack and burn the place: but the largest number of us were patriots, and knew the king was a tyrant; and so we didn't care much whether they came or not. How the people did crowd around this State-House on the day the Declaration was proclaimed! Bells were ringing all over town, and guns were fired; but above 'em all could be heard the heavy, deep sound of this old bell, that rang as if it meant something! Ah! them was great times.\"  As old Harmar concluded these remarks, the old men standing near the bell nodded approvingly, and some echoed, \"Them _was_ great times!\" in a tone which indicated that memory was endeavoring to conjure back the time of which they spoke. They then slowly turned to descend. Lafayette had preceded them with his few friends. \"Stop!\" said old Harmar; \"Wilson, Morton, Smith, and you, Higgins, my son wants you to come home with me, and take dinner at his house. Come; I want to have some chat with you over old doings. I may never see you again after you leave Philadelphia.\"  The invitation, cordially given, was cordially accepted, and the party of old friends descended the stairs, and, arriving at the door, were assisted by the cheering crowd to get into their carriage, which then drove towards the residence of old Harmar's son. At that place we shall consider them as having arrived, and, after much welcoming, introducing, and other preparatory ceremonies, as seated at a long, well-supplied table, set in a large and pleasant dining-hall. Young Harmar, his wife, and the four children, were also accommodated at the same table, and a scene of conviviality and pleasure was presented such as is not often witnessed. The old men were very communicative and good-humored; and young Harmar and his family were free of questions concerning the great scenes through which they had passed. But we will let the company speak for themselves.    STORY OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.  \"GRANDFATHER,\" said Thomas Jefferson Harmar, \"won't you tell us something about General Washington?\"  \"I could tell you many a thing about that man, my child,\" replied old Harmar, \"but I suppose people know everything concerning him by this time. You see, these history writers go about hunting up every incident relating to the war, now, and after a while they'll know more about it--or say they do--than the men who were actors in it.\"  \"That's not improbable,\" said young Harmar. \"These historians may not know as much of the real spirit of the people at that period, but that they should be better acquainted with the mass of facts relating to battles and to political affairs is perfectly natural.\" The old man demurred, however, and mumbled over, that nobody could know the real state of things who was not living among them at the time.  \"But the little boy wants to hear a story about Washington,\" said Wilson. \"Can't you tell him something about _the_ man? I think I could. Any one who wants to appreciate the character of Washington, and the extent of his services during the Revolution, should know the history of the campaign of 1776, when every body was desponding, and thinking of giving up the good cause. I tell you, if Washington had not been superior to all other men, that cause must have sunk into darkness.\"  \"You say well,\" said Smith. \"We, who were at Valley Forge, know something of his character.\"  \"I remember an incident,\" said"]]]
