At any rate, we know for certain that British submarines have made their way into the Baltic, a \"sea change\" extremely disquieting to the Germans, who, for the rest, have suffered in a naval scrap in the Gulf of Riga with the Russians. On the Western front our troops are suffering from two plagues--large shells and little flies. These troubles have not prevented them from scoring a small though costly success at Hooge. From Gallipoli comes the news of fresh deeds of amazing heroism at Suvla Bay and Anzac.  The war of Notes goes on with unabated energy between Germany and the U.S.A. At home a brief period has been set to the pernicious activities of importunate inquisitors by the adjournment of the House till mid-September. \"Dr. Punch\" is of opinion that the Mother of Parliaments is sorely in need of a rest and needs every hour of a seven weeks' holiday. In the Thrift campaign, which has now set in, everybody expects that everybody else should do his duty; and the universal eruption of posters imploring us to subscribe to the War Loan indicates the emergence of a new Art--that of Government by advertisement. To the obvious appeals to duty, patriotism, conscience, appeals to shame, appeals romantic and even facetious are now added. It may be necessary, but the method is not dignified. All that can be said is that \"Govertisement,\" or government by advertisement, is better than Government by the Press, a new terror with which we are daily threatened.  Mr. Winston Churchill, the greatest of our quick-change political artists, is said to be devoting his leisure to landscape painting. The particular school that he favours is not publicly stated, but we have reason to believe that he intends to be a Leader.  The Archbishop of Cologne says that, on being congratulated on his Eastern successes, the Kaiser \"turned his eyes to heaven with the most indescribable expression of intense gratitude and religious fervour.\" Yes, we can quite imagine that it beggared description. But there is no difficulty in finding the right phrase for his address to the inhabitants of Warsaw: \"We wage war only against hostile troops, not against peaceful citizens.\" It is not \"_splendide mendax_.\" That is the due of boys who overstate, and men who understate, their age in order to serve their country in the field.  [Illustration: OFFICER (to boy of thirteen who, in his effort to get taken on as a bugler, has given his age as sixteen): \"Do you know where boys go who tell lies?\"  APPLICANT: \"To the Front, sir.\"]  A correspondent reminds Mr. Punch that four years ago he wrote as follows: \"Lord Haldane, in defending the Territorials, declared that he expects to be dead before any political party seriously suggests compulsory military service. We understand that, since making this statement, our War Minister has received a number of telegrams from Germany wishing him long life.\" But we suspect that when he said dead he meant politically dead. Still, we owe Lord Haldane the Territorials, and they are doing great work in Europe and most valuable, if thankless, work in India. As \"One of the _Punch_ brigade\" writes: \"The hearts of very few of the Territorials now garrisoning India are in their work, though, of course, we know that actually it is essential duty we are performing.\" \"They also serve,\" who patiently endure the dull routine of existence largely spent in a stifling fort on the blistering and dust-swept plains, and find relief in the smallest incident that breaks the monotony. As, for example, when a quartermaster-sergeant was held up by a native guard at a bridge, and, on demanding an explanation, had his attention directed to the notices on the wall, \"Elephants and traction engines are not allowed to cross this bridge.\"    _September, 1915_.   The Tsar has succeeded the Grand Nicholas as Generalissimo of his armies, and the great Russian retreat has ended. Yet it would be rash to say that the one event has caused the other. Lord Kitchener's statement that on the Eastern front the Germans had \"almost shot their last bolt\" is a better summary, and when we reflect on their enormous superiority in artillery and equipment, that is a great tribute to the strategy of the Grand Duke in conducting the most difficult retreat of modern times. Germany, though a mistress of the entire alphabet of frightfulness, is making increasing play with the _U_'s and _Z_'s, and Admiral Percy Scott, who predicted the dangers of the former, is now entrusted with the task of coping with the latter menace.  Five months have elapsed since the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and the pro-German campaign in the United States is more active than ever, thanks to the untiring efforts of Count Bernstorff and his worthy ally, Dr. Dumba, in promoting strikes and _sabotage_; but President Wilson, \"Le Grand Penseur,\" declines to be rushed by the interventionists, and is giving his detached consideration to the \"concessions\" of the German Government in regard to submarine warfare. But three thousand miles of ocean no longer keep America free from strife. The enemy is within her gates, plotting, spying and bribing. The lesser neutrals in Europe find it harder to dissemble their sympathies, but Ferdinand of Bulgaria maintains a vulpine inscrutability.  [Illustration: THE UNSINKABLE TIRP  GERMAN CHANCELLOR: \"Well, thank Heaven, that's the last of Tirpitz.\"  TIRPITZ (reappearing): \"I don't think!\"]  By way of a sidelight on what happens on the Western front, a wounded officer sends a characteristic account of his experiences after \"going over the top\" at 3 A.M. \"The first remark, as distinct from a shout that I heard after leaving our parapet, came from Private Henry, my most notorious malefactor. As the first attempt at a wire entanglement in our new position went heavenward ten seconds after its emplacement, and a big tree just to our right collapsed suddenly like a dying pig, he turned round with a grin, observing: 'Well, sir, we _do_ see a bit of life, if we _don't_ make money.' I never saw a man all day who hadn't a grin ready when you passed, and a bit of a _riposte_ if you passed the time of day with him.\" Our officers only think of their men, and the men of their officers. In Gallipoli our soldiers have discovered a new method of annoying the Turk:    We go and bathe, in shameless scores     Beneath his baleful een,   Disrobe, unscathed, on sacred shores     And wallow in between;   Nor does a soldier then assume   His university costume,   And though it makes the Faithful fume,     It makes the Faithless clean.  The return of the wounded to England is marked by strange incidents, pathetic and humorous. Thus it has been reserved for an officer, reported dead in the casualty list, to ring up his people on the telephone and correct \"this silly story about my being killed.\" And the cheerfulness of the limbless men in blue is something wonderful. They \"jest at scars,\" but not because they \"never felt a wound.\" It is a high privilege to entertain these light-hearted heroes, one of whom recently presented his partner in a lawn tennis match with a fragment of shell taken direct from his \"stummick.\" And the recipient rightly treasures it as a love-token.  Parliament has reassembled, the inquisitors returning (unhappily) like giants refreshed after their holiday. But they sometimes contribute to our amusement, as when one relentless and complacent critic declared that, on the matter of conscription, he should himself \"prefer to be guided--very largely--by Lord Kitchener.\" The concession is something. Most of the importunate questionists are on the other side:    \"Take from us any joys you like,\" they cry;     \"We'd bear the loss, however much we missed 'em;   Let truth and justice, fame and honour die,     But spare, O spare, our Voluntary System!\"  Amongst other signs of the times the increase of girl gardeners and the sacrifice of flower beds to vegetables are to be noted. But War changes are sometimes disconcerting, even when they are most salutary. For example, there is the _cri de coeur_ of a passenger on a Clydebank tramcar in Glasgow on Saturday night, with a lady conductor: \"I canna jist bottom this, Tam. It's Seterday nicht an' this is the Clydebank caur, an' there's naebody singin' an' naebody fechtin' wi' the conductor.\" Liquor control evidently does mean something.   [Illustration: A HANDY MAN  MARINE;(somewhat late for parade): \"At six o'clock I was a bloomin' 'ousemaid: at seven o'clock I was a bloomin' valet; at eight o'clock I was a bloomin' waiter; an' _now_ I'm a bloomin' soldier!\"]  The War vocabulary grows and grows. \"Pipsqueaks,\" \"crumps\" and \"Jack Johnsons,\" picturesque equivalents for unpleasant things, have long been familiar even to arm-chair experts. The strangely named \"Archie,\" and \"Pacifist,\" the dismay of scholars--a word \"mean as what it's meant to mean\"--now come to be added to the list. A new and admirable explanation of the R.F.A., \"Ready for anyfink,\" is attributed to a street Arab. Our children are mostly lapped in blissful ignorance, but their comments are often illuminating. As, for instance, the suggestion of a small child asked to give her idea of a suitable future for Germany and the Kaiser: \"After the war I wouldn't let Heligoland belong to anybody. I would put the Germans there, and they should dig and dig and dig until it was all dug into the sea. The Kaiser should be sent to America, and they should be as rude as they liked to him. If he went in a train no one was to offer him a seat; he was to hang on to a strap, and he is to be called Mr. Smith.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11571"],["title","Mr. Punch's History of the Great War (#8)"],["body","are being bribed to stay by the gift of War Bonds. Smart fashionables are flocking to munition works, and some of them sometimes are not unnaturally growing almost frightened at the organising talents they are developing. So are other people.  A vigorous campaign against flies has been initiated by the journal which describes itself as \"that paper which gets things done.\" Nothing is too small for it. Meanwhile it is announced that \"Lord Northcliffe is travelling and will be beyond the reach of correspondence until the end of next week.\" Even he must have an occasional rest from his daily mail.  We have to apologise for any suggestion to the effect that the Huns are devoid of humour. The German Society for the Protection and Preservation of Monuments has held a meeting in Brussels and expressed its thanks to the German Military Authorities for the care they had taken of the Monuments in Belgium. The function ended with an excursion to Louvain, where the delegates, no doubt, enjoyed a happy hour in the Library.    _October, 1915_.   September ended with the Western front once more ablaze, with bitter fighting at Loos and a great French offensive in Champagne. With October the focus of interest and anxiety shifts to the Balkans. Austrian armies, stiffened with Germans, have again invaded Serbia and again occupied Belgrade. The Allies have landed at Salonika, and Ferdinand of Bulgaria has declared war on Serbia. Thus a new theatre of war has been opened, and though it is well to be rid of a treacherous neutral, the conflict enters on a fresh and formidable phase. When Ferdinand went to Bulgaria he is said to have resolved that if ever there were to be any assassinations he would be on the side of the assassins. He has been true to his word ever since the removal of Stamboloff:    Here stands the Moslem with his brutal sword     Still red and reeking with Armenia's slaughter;   Here, fresh from Belgium's wastes, the Christian Lord,     His heart unsated by the wrong he wrought her;   And you between them, on your brother's track,   Sworn, for a bribe, to stick him in the back.  France and England have declared their intention of rendering all possible help to Serbia in her new ordeal, but Greece, false to her treaty with Serbia, and dominated by a pro-German Court and Government, hampers us at every turn. \"'Tis Greece, but living Greece no more.\" So Byron sang, and a Byron _de nos jours_ adds a new stanza to his appeal:    Lo, a new curse--the Teuton bane!     Again rings out the trumpet call;   France, England, Russia, joined again,     For freedom fight, for Greece, for all;   And Greece--shall she that call ignore?   Then is she living Greece no more!  Life in the trenches grows more strenuous as the output of high explosive increases, and the daily toll of our best and bravest makes grievous reading for the elders at home, \"who linger here and droop beneath the heavy burden of our years,\" though many of them cheerfully undertake the thankless fatigues of guarding the King's highway as specials. But letters from the front still show the same genius for making light of hardship and deadly peril, the same happy gift of extracting amusement from trivial incidents. So those who spend their days and nights under heavy shell fire and heavy rain write to tell you that \"tea is the dominating factor of war,\" or that \"the mushrooming and ratting in their latest quarters\" are satisfactory. And even the wounded, in comparing the hazards of London with those at the front, only indulge in mild irony at the expense of the \"staunch dare-devil souls who stay at home.\"  In Parliament Sir Edward Carson has explained the reasons of his resignation of office--his difference from his colleagues in the difficulties arising in the Eastern theatre of war; and a resolution has been placed on the order-book proposing the appointment of a Committee of Inquiry on the Dardanelles campaign. No abatement of the plague of questions is yet noticeable, but some slight excuse may be found for the \"ragging\" of the Censor. This anonymous worthy, it appears, recently excised the words \"and the Kings\" from the well-known line in Mr. Kipling's \"Recessional\":    The Captains and the Kings depart.  Apparently the Censor cannot admit any reference to the movements of royalty.  [Illustration: REALISATION  (\"When I went to Bulgaria I resolved that if there were to be any assassinations I would be on the side of the assassins.\" STATEMENT BY FERDINAND.)]  When the Kaiser was at Windsor in 1891 he told the Eton College Volunteers he was glad to see so many of them taking an interest in the study of arms, and hoped that if ever they had to draw their swords in earnest they would use them to some purpose for their country. Now that there are three thousand Etonians at the front he is beginning to be sorry he spoke. The Kaiser, by his own confession, is sorry in another way. He has told a Socialist deputy, \"with tears in his eyes,\" that he was sincerely sorry for France, which was \"the greatest disappointment of his life.\" Even crocodiles sometimes speak the truth unwittingly. Meanwhile the Hamburg _Fremdenblatt_ asserts that, \"We Germans would gladly follow the Kaiser's lead through the very gates of hell, were it necessary.\" The qualification is surely superfluous, in the light of the murder of the heroic English hospital matron, Edith Cavell, at Brussels on October 12. Her life was one long act of mercy. She died with unshaken fortitude after the mockery of a trial on a charge of having assisted fugitive British and Belgian prisoners to escape. But her great offence was that she was English. The names of her chief assassins are General Baron von Biasing, the Governor of Brussels, General von Sauberschweig, the Military Governor, and the Baron von der Lancken, the Head of the Political Department. Many years will pass before the echoes of that volley fired at dawn in a Brussels prison yard will die away.  [Illustration: LANDLADY; \"'Ere's the Zeppelins, sir!\" LODGER: \"Right-o! Put 'em down outside.\"]  A new phase has been reached in the Conscription controversy, and the burning question appears to be whether the necessary men are to be compelled to volunteer or persuaded to be compulsorily enrolled. One of our novelist military experts, who is not always lucky with figures, though he thoroughly enjoys them, is alleged to have discovered that there are no more men than can be raised by conscription, but that the same does not, of course, apply to the voluntary system.  The _Daily Mail_ asks, \"Have we a Foreign Office?\" We understand that a search-party is going carefully through Carmelite House. We have certainly got a Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, so efficient in the discharge of his duties that he has made himself an accomplished landscape painter in three months.  A visitor to a remote East Anglian village in search of rest has found recreation in discussing with the inhabitants the Great War, of which he found some of them had heard. \"Them there Zett'lins,\" said one old woman, \"I almost shruk as I heerd the mucky varmints a-shovellin' on the coals--dare, dare! How my pore heart did beat!\" And an onlooker, who had seen a bomb drop near a church, informed the visitor that it \"fared to him like the body of the chach a-floatin' away--that it did and all! It made a clangin' like a covey of lorries with their innards broke loose.\" Another inhabitant said that he had two boys fighting. \"One on 'em is in France, wherever that might be, and Jimmy's in that hare old Dardelles.\" He couldn't rightly say when the elder had gone out, \"but it might be a yare ago come muck-spreadin'.\"    _November_, 1915.   More money and more men is still the cry. The war is now costing five millions a day, and the new vote of credit for £400,000,000 will only carry us on till the middle of February. This is \"Derby's Day,\" and the new Director of Recruiting inspires confidence in his ability to make good, in spite of the Jeremiads of Lord Courtney and Lord Loreburn. The lot of a Coalition Government is never easy, and public opinion clamours not for Jeremiahs but for Jonahs to lighten the Ship of State. Mr. Winston Churchill, wearying of his sinecure at the Duchy of Lancaster, has resigned office, explained himself in a long speech, and rejoined his regiment at the Western front. Lord Fisher, whose doubts and hesitations about the Dardanelles expedition were referred to by the late First Lord, has been content to leave his record of sixty-one years' service in the hands of his countrymen. In the briefest maiden speech ever delivered in either House he stated that it was \"unfitting to make personal explanations affecting the national interest when my country is in the midst of a great war.\" Here at least the traditions of the \"Silent Service\" have been worthily maintained, just as they are maintained by the Port Officer R.N.R. at an Oriental seaport, a thousand miles from the front, out of the limelight, with no chance of glory, with fever from morn till night, who \"worries along by the grace of God and the blessing of cheap cheroots.\"  In Flanders the rain has begun its winter session, and, as a military humorist put it, trench warfare is becoming a constant drain. The problem of parapet mending has been reduced to arithmetical form _à la_ Colenso, as follows: \"If two inches of rain per diem brings down one quarter of a company's parapet, and one company, working about twenty-six hours per diem, can revet one-eighth of a company's parapet, how long will your trenches last--given the additional premisses that no revetments to speak of are to be had, and that two inches of rain is only a minimum ration?\" The infantryman finds the men of the R.F.C. interesting and stimulating companions. \"These airy fellows talk of war as if it were a day's shooting, and they the cock pheasants with the best of the fun up aloft. Upon my word, the hen who hatched such birds should be a proud, if"]]]
