Never deliver a letter of introduction in person. It places you in the most undignified position imaginable, and compels you to wait while it is being read, like a servant who has been told to wait for an answer. There is also another reason why you should not be yourself the bearer of your introduction; i.e., you compel the other person to receive you, whether she chooses or not. It may be that she is sufficiently ill-bred to take no notice of the letter when sent, and in such case, if you presented yourself with it, she would most probably receive you with rudeness. It is, at all events, more polite on your part to give her the option, and, perhaps, more pleasant. If the receiver of the letter be a really well-bred person, she will call upon you or leave her card the next day, and you should return her attentions within the week.  If, on the other hand, a stranger sends you a letter of introduction and her card, you are bound by the laws of politeness and hospitality, not only to call upon her the next day, but to follow up that attention with others. If you are in a position to do so, the most correct proceeding is to invite her to dine with you. Should this not be within your power, you can probably escort her to some of the exhibitions, bazaars, or concerts of the season; any of which would be interesting to a foreigner or provincial visitor. In short, etiquette demands that you shall exert yourself to show kindness to the stranger, if only out of compliment to the friend who introduced her to you.  If you invite her to dine with you, it is a better compliment to ask some others to meet her than to dine with her _tête-à-tête_. You are thereby giving her an opportunity of making other acquaintances, and are assisting your friend in still farther promoting the purpose for which she gave her the introduction to yourself.  Be careful at the same time only to ask such persons as she will feel are at least her own social equals.  A letter of introduction should be given unsealed, not alone because your friend may wish to know what you have said of her, but also as a guarantee of your own good faith. As you should never give such a letter unless you can speak highly of the bearer, this rule of etiquette is easy to observe. By requesting your friend to fasten the envelope before forwarding the letter to its destination, you tacitly give her permission to inspect its contents.  Let your note-paper be of the best quality and the proper size. Albert or Queen's size is the best for these purposes.  It has been well said that \"attention to the punctilios of politeness is a proof at once of self-respect, and of respect for your friend.\" Though irksome at first, these trifles soon cease to be matters for memory, and become things of mere habit. To the thoroughly well-bred they are a second nature. Let no one neglect them who is desirous of pleasing in society; and, above all, let no one deem them unworthy of attention. They are precisely the trifles which do most to make social intercourse agreeable, and a knowledge of which distinguishes the gentlewoman from the _parvenue_.         *       *       *       *       *  III.--VISITING.--MORNING CALLS.--CARDS.   A morning visit should be paid between the hours of two and four p.m., in winter, and two and five in summer. By observing this rule you avoid intruding before the luncheon is removed, and leave in sufficient time to allow the lady of the house an hour or two of leisure for her dinner toilette.  Be careful always to avoid luncheon hours when you pay morning visits. Some ladies dine with their children at half-past one, and are consequently unprepared for the early reception of visitors. When you have once ascertained this to be the case, be careful never again to intrude at the same hour.  A good memory for these trifles is one of the hall-marks of good breeding.  Visits of ceremony should be short. If even the conversation should have become animated, beware of letting your call exceed half-an-hour's length. It is always better to let your friends regret than desire your withdrawal.  On returning visits of ceremony you may, without impoliteness, leave your card at the door without going in. Do not fail, however, to inquire if the family be well.  Should there be daughters or sisters residing with the lady upon whom you call, you may turn down a corner of your card, to signify that the visit is paid to all. It is in better taste, however, to leave cards for each.  Unless when returning thanks for \"kind inquiries,\" or announcing your arrival in, or departure from, town, it is not considered respectful to send round cards by a servant.  Leave-taking cards have P.P.C. (_pour prendre congé_) written in the corner. Some use P.D.A. (_pour dire adieu_).  It is not the fashion on the Continent for unmarried ladies to affix any equivalent to the English \"Miss\" to their visiting cards. _Emilie Dubois_, or _Kätchen Clauss_, is thought more simple and elegant than if preceded by _Mademoiselle_ or _Fraülein_. Some English girls have of late adopted this good custom, and it would be well if it became general.  Autographic facsimiles for visiting cards are affectations in any persons but those who are personally remarkable for talent, and whose autographs, or facsimiles of them, would be prized as curiosities. A card bearing the autographic signature of Agnes Strickland or Mary Somerville, though only a lithographic facsimile, would have a certain interest; whereas the signature of Jane Smith would be not only valueless; but would make the owner ridiculous.  Visits of condolence are paid within the week after the event which occasions them. Personal visits of this kind are made by relations and very intimate friends only. Acquaintances should leave cards with narrow mourning borders.  On the first occasion when you are received by the family after the death of one of its members, it is etiquette to wear slight mourning.  Umbrellas should invariably be left in the hall.  Never take favourite dogs into a drawing-room when you make a morning call. Their feet may be dusty, or they may bark at the sight of strangers, or, being of too friendly a disposition, may take the liberty of lying on a lady's gown, or jumping on the sofas and easy chairs. Where your friend has a favourite cat already established before the fire, a battle may ensue, and one or other of the pets be seriously hurt. Besides, many persons have a constitutional antipathy to dogs, and others never allow their own to be seen in the sitting-rooms. For all or any of these reasons, a visitor has no right to inflict upon her friend the society of her dog as well as of herself. Neither is it well for a mother to take young children with her when she pays morning visits; their presence, unless they are unusually well trained, can only be productive of anxiety to both yourself and your hostess. She, while striving to amuse them, or to appear interested in them, is secretly anxious for the fate of her album, or the ornaments on her _étagére_; while the mother is trembling lest her children should say or do something objectionable.  If other visitors are announced, and you have already remained as long as courtesy requires, wait till they are seated, and then rise from your chair, take leave of your hostess, and bow politely to the newly arrived guests. You will, perhaps, be urged to remain, but, having once risen, it is best to go. There is always a certain air of _gaucherie_ in resuming your seat and repeating the ceremony of leave-taking.  If you have occasion to look at your watch during a call, ask permission to do so, and apologise for it on the plea of other appointments.  In receiving morning visitors, it is not necessary that the lady should lay aside the employment in which she may be engaged, particularly if it consists of light or ornamental needle-work. Politeness, however, requires that music, drawing, or any occupation which would completely engross the attention, be at once abandoned.  You need not advance to receive visitors when announced, unless they are persons to whom you are desirous of testifying particular attention. It is sufficient if a lady rises to receive her visitors, moves forward a single step to shake hands with them, and remains standing till they are seated.  When your visitors rise to take leave you should rise also, and remain standing till they have quite left the room. Do not accompany them to the door, but be careful to ring in good time, that the servant may be ready in the hall to let them out.  A lady should dress well, but not too richly, when she pays a morning visit. If she has a carriage at command, she may dress more elegantly than if she were on foot. The question of morning and afternoon dress will be found fully treated in Section VII.         *       *       *       *       *  IV.--CONVERSATION.   There is no conversation so graceful, so varied, so sparkling, as that of an intellectual and cultivated woman. Excellence in this particular is, indeed, one of the attributes of the sex, and should be cultivated by every gentlewoman who aspires to please in general society.  In order to talk well, three conditions are indisputable, namely--tact, a good memory, and a fair education.  Remember that people take more interest in their own affairs than in anything else which you can name. If you wish your conversation to be thoroughly agreeable, lead a mother to talk of her children, a young lady of her last ball, an author of his forthcoming book, or an artist of his exhibition picture. Having furnished the topic, you need only listen; and you are sure to be thought not only agreeable, but thoroughly sensible and well-informed.  Be careful, however, on the other hand, not always to make a point of talking to persons upon general matters relating to their professions. To show an interest in their immediate"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12426"],["title","Routledge's Manual of Etiquette (#2)"],["body","is flattering; but to converse with them too much about their own arts looks as if you thought them ignorant of other topics.  Remember in conversation that a voice \"gentle and low\" is, above all other extraneous acquirements, \"an excellent thing in woman.\" There is a certain distinct but subdued tone of voice which is peculiar to only well-bred persons. A loud voice is both disagreeable and vulgar. It is better to err by the use of too low than too loud a tone.  Remember that all \"slang\" is vulgar. It has become of late unfortunately prevalent, and we know many ladies who pride themselves on the saucy _chique_ with which they adopt certain Americanisms, and other cant phrases of the day. Such habits cannot be too severely reprehended. They lower the tone of society and the standard of thought. It is a great mistake to suppose that slang is in any way a substitute for wit.  The use of proverbs is equally vulgar in conversation; and puns, unless they rise to the rank of witticisms, are to be scrupulously avoided. A lady-punster is a most unpleasing phenomenon, and we would advise no young woman, however witty she may be, to cultivate this kind of verbal talent.  Long arguments in general company, however entertaining to the disputants, are tiresome to the last degree to all others. You should always endeavour to prevent the conversation from dwelling too long upon one topic.  Religion is a topic which should never be introduced in society. It is the one subject on which persons are most likely to differ, and least able to preserve temper.  Never interrupt a person who is speaking. It has been aptly said that \"if you interrupt a speaker in the middle of his sentence, you act almost as rudely as if, when walking with a companion, you were to thrust yourself before him, and stop his progress.\"  To listen well is almost as great an art as to talk well. It is not enough _only_ to listen. You must endeavour to seem interested in the conversation of others.  It is considered extremely ill-bred when two persons whisper in society, or converse in a language with which all present are not familiar. If you have private matters to discuss, you should appoint a proper time and place to do so, without paying others the ill compliment of excluding them from your conversation.  If a foreigner be one of the guests at a small party, and does not understand English sufficiently to follow what is said, good breeding demands that the conversation shall be carried on in his own language. If at a dinner-party, the same rule applies to those at his end of the table.  If upon the entrance of a visitor you carry on the thread of a previous conversation, you should briefly recapitulate to him what has been said before he arrived.  Do not be _always_ witty, even though you should be so happily gifted as to need the caution. To outshine others on every occasion is the surest road to unpopularity.  Always look, but never stare, at those with whom you converse.  In order to meet the general needs of conversation in society, it is necessary that a gentlewoman should be acquainted with the current news and historical events of at least the last few years.  Never talk upon subjects of which you know nothing, unless it be for the purpose of acquiring information. Many young ladies imagine that because they play a little, sing a little, draw a little, and frequent exhibitions and operas, they are qualified judges of art. No mistake is more egregious or universal.  Those who introduce anecdotes into their conversation are warned that these should invariably be \"short, witty, eloquent, new, and not far-fetched.\"  Scandal is the least excusable of all conversational vulgarities.  In conversing with a woman of rank, do not too frequently give her her title. Only a lady's-maid interlards every sentence with \"My Lady,\" or \"My Lord.\" It is, however, well to show that you remember the station of your interlocutor by now and then introducing some such phrase as--\"I think I have already mentioned to your Grace\"--or, \"I believe, Madam, you were observing--\"  A peer or baron may occasionally, as in an address, be styled \"My Lord,\" but a lady of equal rank must only be addressed as \"Madam.\" In general, however, a nobleman or lady of high rank should only be addressed as you would address any other gentleman or lady. The Prince of Wales himself is only styled \"Sir\" in conversation, and the Queen \"Madam.\"         *       *       *       *       *  V.--NOTES OF INVITATION, &C.   Notes of invitation and acceptance are written in the third person and the simplest style. The old-fashioned preliminary of \"presenting compliments\" is discontinued by the most elegant letter writers.  All notes of invitation are now issued in the name of the mistress of the house only, as follows:--      \"Mrs. Norman requests the honour of Sir George and Lady     Thurlow's company at an evening party, on Monday, 14th of     June.\"  Others prefer the subjoined form, which is purchaseable ready printed upon either cards or note paper, with blanks for names or dates:--                       \"Mrs. Norman,                        \"At home,             \"Monday evening, June 14th inst.\"  An \"At home\" is, however, considered somewhat less stately than an evening party, and partakes more of the character of a _conversazione_.  The reply to a note of invitation should be couched as follows:--      \"Mr. Berkeley has much pleasure in accepting Mrs. Norman's     polite invitation for Monday evening, June the 14th instant.\"  Never \"avail\" yourself of an invitation. Above all, never speak or write of an invitation as \"an invite.\" It is neither good breeding nor good English.  Notes of invitation and reply should be written on small paper of the best quality, and enclosed in envelopes to correspond.  Note paper of the most dainty and fastidious kind may be used by a lady with propriety and elegance, but only when she is writing to her friends and equals. Business letters or letters to her tradespeople should be written on plain paper, and enclosed either in an adhesive envelope, or sealed with red wax.  Never omit the address and date from any letter, whether of business or friendship.  Letters in the first person addressed to strangers should begin with \"Sir,\" or \"Madam,\" and end with \"I have the honour to be your very obedient servant.\" Some object to this form of words from a mistaken sense of pride; but it is merely a form, and, rightly apprehended, evinces a \"proud humility,\" which implies more condescension than a less formal phrase.  At the end of your letter, at some little distance below your signature, and in the left corner of your paper, write the name of the person to whom your letter is addressed; as \"Lady Dalhousie,\" or \"Edward Munroe, Esquire.\"  It is more polite to write Esquire at full length than to curtail it to Esq.  In writing to persons much your superior or inferior, use as few words as possible. In the former case, to take up much of a great man's time is to take a liberty; in the latter, to be diffuse is to be too familiar. It is only in familiar correspondence that long letters are permissible.  In writing to a tradesman, begin your letter by addressing him by name, as--  \"Mr. Jones,--Sir.\"  A letter thus begun may, with propriety, be ended with--  \"Sir, yours truly.\"  Letters to persons whom you meet frequently in society, without having arrived at intimacy, may commence with \"Dear Madam,\" and end with \"I am, dear Madam, yours very truly.\"  Letters commencing \"My dear Madam,\" addressed to persons whom you appreciate, and with whom you are on friendly terms, may end with \"I am, my dear Madam, yours very faithfully,\" or \"yours very sincerely.\"  To be prompt in replying to a letter is to be polite.  Lady correspondents are too apt to over-emphasize in their letter-writing, and in general evince a sad disregard of the laws of punctuation. We would respectfully suggest that a comma is not designed to answer every purpose, and that the underlining of every second or third word adds nothing to the eloquence or clearness of a letter, however certain it may be to provoke an unflattering smile upon the lips of the reader.  All letters must be prepaid.         *       *       *       *       *  VI.--THE PROMENADE.   In England, a lady may accept the arm of a gentleman with whom she is walking, even though he be only an acquaintance. This is not the case either in America or on the Continent. There a lady can take the arm of no gentleman who is not either her husband, lover, or near relative.  If a lady has been making purchases during her walk, she may permit the gentleman who accompanies her to carry any small, parcel that she may have in her own hand; but she should not burthen him with more than one under any circumstances whatever.  Two ladies may without any impropriety take each one arm of a single cavalier; but one lady cannot, with either grace or the sanction of custom take the arms of two gentlemen at the same time.  When a lady is walking with a gentleman in a park, or public garden, or through the rooms of an exhibition, and becomes fatigued, it is the gentleman's duty to find her a seat. If, however, as is very frequently the case, he is himself obliged to remain standing, the lady should make a point of rising as soon as she is sufficiently rested, and not abuse either the patience or politeness of her companion.  It is the place of the lady to bow first, if she meets a gentleman of her acquaintance. When you meet friends or acquaintances in the streets, the exhibitions, or any public places, be careful not to pronounce their names so loudly as to attract the attention of bystanders. Never call across the street, or attempt to carry on a dialogue in a public vehicle, unless your interlocutor occupies the seat beside your own.         *       *       *       *       *  VII.--DRESS.
