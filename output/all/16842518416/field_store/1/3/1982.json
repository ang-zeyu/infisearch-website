[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12735"],["title","The Grammar School Boys in Summer Athletics (#4)"],["body"," the people of Gridley knew that the ruins of the abandoned water-works cottage had been explored, and that the remains of Amos Garwood had not been found there.  But an editorial in the \"Blade\" suggested that the cottage was not very likely to have taken fire unless the blaze had been started by Garwood. While the latter was declared not to be dangerous, the \"Blade\" hinted that his malady might suddenly have taken a dangerous turn.  \"The good people of this section will feel much easier,\" concluded the editor, \"when they know that Garwood has been found and returned to the sanitarium that awaits him. A cash reward of twenty-five hundred dollars should be incentive enough to set many people to the task of finding the unfortunate man.\"  Yet, for Dick & Co., the adventure of the afternoon before dropped very quickly into the background. Here was Monday; on Wednesday the boys of the Central Grammar must meet the boys of the North Grammar on the diamond. Then the first of a series of baseball games was to be played for the local Grammar School championship. The South Grammar would also enter a nine.  Intense rivalry prevailed between the schools. The fact that the respective nines were made up almost wholly of boys who were soon to be graduated from the Grammar Schools did not in any sense lessen the rivalry. Each young player was proud of his own school and anxious to capture the laurels.  \"Are you going to win Wednesday's game from the North Grammar, Dick?\" asked Len spencer, when that reporter met Prescott on Main Street at noon on Monday.  \"Of course we are,\" Dick replied instantly.  \"You seem very positive about it,\" quizzed Len.  \"That's the only way to go into athletics,\" claimed Dick. \"A team must enter with the determination and the knowledge that it is going to win. Then there's little left to do but to walk home with the victory.\"  \"But Hi Martin was telling me, this morning, that Central hasn't a ghost of a show against North,\" pursued Len.  \"Hi Martin will know better, day after tomorrow, won't he, Dave?\" queried Dick, appealing to Darrin, who had just come along.  \"He surely will,\" nodded Dave.  \"By the way,\" asked Len, \"have you seen any of the new uniforms of the North Grammar?\"  \"No,\" Dick admitted, his face falling a trifle. \"I understand that Martin's fellows are going to wear pretty dandy uniforms, though.\"  \"They are,\" Len nodded. \"I've had a look at the uniform.\"  \"Well, North Grammar is attended by a lot of sons of pretty well-to-do men,\" Dave put in. \"Our boys don't come from as wealthy families, so we have to be content with less of the showy things in life.\"  \"What are your uniforms going to be like?\" inquired Len Spencer.  \"We haven't any,\" Dick replied promptly.  \"No uniforms at all?\" demanded the \"Blade\" reporter.  \"None at all,\" Dick continued. \"Neither have the South Grammar boys. In the glories of uniform the North Grammar nine will be all in a class by itself.\"  \"It's too bad,\" muttered Len.  \"No, it isn't,\" Prescott retorted. \"We fellows from Central are going to show that uniforms don't necessarily make players. We don't mind---that is, not very much---the absence of uniforms.\"  \"We'll try to show that we have something uniform about our team play, and let it go at that,\" said Dave cheerily. \"Come along, Dick, or we'll be late at school.\"  Away the pair raced. Lessons went about as usual that afternoon with Old Dut's class, which was surprising, as nearly every boy in the room had his mind much on baseball.  Captain Dick Prescott, of the Central Grammar nine, had called practice for that afternoon, from half past four to six o'clock.  At recess, that afternoon, a pleasant, somewhat rotund-looking man was seen engaged in conversation with Old Dut in a corner of the schoolyard. At the close of the afternoon session that same man stepped into the schoolroom, accepting the principal's offer of a chair on the platform.  \"Attention!\" called Old Dut, striking the bell. \"I am glad to be able to state that no pupil has incurred the penalty of remaining after school to-day. However, I am going to ask the members of the Central Grammar baseball nine and their substitutes to remain for a few minutes. I pledge myself not to interfere with the scheduled practice,\" continued the principal dryly. \"All other pupils will file out promptly, and not loiter in coatrooms or corridors.\"  Within two minutes the place had been cleared of all but Dick's baseball squad.  \"I now wish, young gentlemen,\" began Old Dut, \"to introduce to you Mr. Edson Brown, who is interested in baseball, and who has a slight favor that he wishes to ask of you.\"  \"It's very simple,\" declared Mr. Brown, rising and stepping down from the platform. \"I have been greatly interested in baseball for a number of years. Among other things I have a considerable collection of figures concerning school teams, their sizes and weights, I would like, with your permission, young gentlemen, to take a few measurements. I won't detain you more than a few moments.\"  \"Do you want a suggestion, sir?\" asked Tom Reade.  \"Of course,\" nodded Mr. Brown, smilingly.  \"Then the real crowd that you ought to measure are the fellows of the North Grammar nine. You'd get a fine lot of chest measurements there, I can promise you.\"  \"Why?\" asked Mr. Brown. \"Are the North Grammar boys better developed physically?\"  \"I can't say about that,\" Reade replied seriously, \"but they're the only Grammar School fellows in Gridley that have baseball uniforms, and I understand that they're the chestiest lot of young fellows that any one ever saw.\"  \"I'll consider the North Grammar boys later, then,\" nodded Mr. Brown, smiling. \"Now, will each young man oblige me by removing his coat and vest and stepping forward for the measurements that I want to take?\"  In a notebook Mr. Brown jotted down the measurements that he made. There being five substitute players, there were fourteen boys in all whose measurements he recorded.  \"That is all,\" nodded Mr. Brown finally, snapping his notebook and tucking it away in a pocket. \"I am deeply indebted to all of you young men.  \"And now I beg to add,\" said Old Dut, \"that, as all of you youngsters are in a hurry, there will be no criticism if you see fit to race through the corridors.\"  Out on the field, just before half past four, Captain Dick Prescott lined up his squad of fourteen, himself included, and quickly added four more to the number, thus organizing two nines.  \"Now, play ball,\" he called.  \"Do it in a hurry,\" supplemented Tom Reade.  \"Speed is all right,\" Dick retorted. \"But we want to play with care, even more than with speed. The scrub nine will go to bat.\"  Dick himself ran quickly out to the pitcher's box, twirling his ball impatiently. A High School boy had been secured for umpire, and all was in readiness.  Of course the school nine won over the scrub.  Never mind the score, which looked badly for the scrub. Dick was satisfied that his nine was doing the best that was in it.  Tuesday afternoon there was more practice, though Captain Dick did not allow it to continue too long.  \"Now, don't take a single chance with yourselves,\" called Prescott, in dismissing the squad on the field near the schoolhouse. \"Don't any one of you get a sore toe or strain a 'wing' before to-morrow afternoon. Fellows, I believe that we are going to be able to put it all over the North Grammar to-morrow afternoon. But we can't do it unless we are all in the best of shape. Be careful at table. Don't any one of you overeat between now and the game. And all get into bed early to-night and have a long sleep.\"  \"I put every young man in this room on honor for to-day,\" stated Old Dut, facing his class, the next morning. \"No matter what the disorder or breach of discipline, no boy will be kept in after school this afternoon, for I know that every one of you, whether player or 'booster,' wants to be at the inter-school ball game this afternoon. So remember, young men, that you are all on your honor to-day. Prove yourselves worthy of it.\"  Never had discipline been better preserved in the eighth grade classroom than during that day.  Soon after four o'clock scores of Gridley schoolboys had found their way to the big vacant field not far from the Central Grammar, the owner of which permitted its use freely by schoolboy athletes.  The principal of the South Grammar, too, was there, flanked by rough-and-tumble Ted Teall and the South's baseball delegation. Captain Ted had to play the Centrals on Saturday, and he wanted to view their style. Though North Grammar was well represented, the principal of the school did not appear, being \"detained by pressure of important duties.\"  \"Old Dut will know enough to be here,\" remarked one of the Central boys proudly. \"Nothing but disaster could keep him from showing interest in our work.\"  Cheering was started by a big group of North Grammar boys. A stage had just been sighted, and this bore the North Grammar's diamond champions. A few moments later the stage drew up at the edge of the field, and Hi Martin and his fellows piled out, each proudly resplendent in showy uniform of red and white, with red caps and stockings. The North Grammar boys were dandies, and they appeared to want, everyone to realize the fact. They formed at the roadside and marched on to the field in step.  \"Halt!\" commanded Captain Hi Martin. Then he looked around curiously.  \"If the Centrals are here yet, why don't they come out of the crowd and receive us?\" inquired Martin rather pompously. His insinuation that Dick's fellows might be mixed with the crowd was a slur on the Central boys not possessing uniforms.  \"Our fellows are not here yet, but they will be soon, you bet,\" called back a Central boy. \"It's only twenty minutes past four.\"  \"Spread out, men, and practice,\" directed Hi Martin.  \"Yah! yah!\" jeered a Central boy. \"Get all the practice you can---you'll need it.\"  \"These ragamuffins are pretty full of brag,\" observed Hi scornfully to one of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12735"],["title","The Grammar School Boys in Summer Athletics (#5)"],["body"," lieutenants.  \"They're just the kind of fellows that always do brag,\" returned the player addressed. \"Their brag will all be gone within a half an hour. You'll see.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Hi thoughtfully. \"If we can't trim this crowd to-day, then they're some wonders at ball. They don't have any idea how long we've been training in order to give them this trimming.\"  Some of Hi's players had already spread out over the field, and were doing some rapid passing. Certainly Hi's fielders promised well, from the little glimpse of their skill that was now had.  Then one of their best batsmen took up the willow, driving a few long, swift fielders.  \"This will get the Centrals nervous before they start, if they see any of our work,\" laughed one of Hi's players.  Truth to tell, the North Grammar boys did show some pretty work. Ted Teall looked on approvingly.  \"Prescott has met his match to-day,\" remarked Ted to a friend.  \"These Norths will bother you, too, won't they, Ted?\"  \"Us? No; not a bit. We can play all around the Norths. But Central will have to take third place when the series is done.\"  \"The Centrals haven't got rattled and skulked, have they?\" called Hi Martin at last.  A disdainful yell came back from the assembled Central boys.  \"Then some one hurry over and tell 'em that it's time to hustle on to the field and take their medicine,\" urged Hi. \"We don't want to have the game called for darkness before we're half through.\"  \"The Centrals will be here on time,\" called back one of Old Dut's boys. \"Don't you worry any about them. Dick Prescott is holding the watch over our crowd.\"  \"It's four twenty-seven,\" announced Hi, consulting his gold watch.  \"Four twenty-five and a half,\" corrected a Central boy.  \"Go get your watch fixed,\" retorted Hi scornfully. \"And some one else run and see if he can find out where the Centrals are hiding.\"  \"Here they come!\" yelled one excited Central boy. \"Whoopee! They will answer for themselves!\"  In an instant the Central cheering became tumultuous. Even Ted Teall rubbed his eyes and gasped.  For the Central Grammar School squad was marching toward the field, having just left the schoolhouse. At the head of all, chin well up, marched Old Dut. Back of him, two and two, marched Dick Prescott and his players. What marvel had been worked? For the Central boys wore uniforms that made Hi Martin's fellows look like so many gaudy figures on a cheap poster!     Chapter IV  THE STORY OF THE UNIFORMS   \"Great Scott!\" gasped Hi Martin, in sheer dismay, his gaze fixed on the approaching Centrals.  \"Where in the mischief did they get those uniforms?\" demanded Tom Percival, of the North Grammars, his mouth agape.  \"Well, they have 'em, anyway,\" added Bill Rodgers. \"And they certainly look more than fine, don't they?\"  \"The uniforms are made of cheap stuff, I'll wager,\" muttered Hi hoarsely. There was a choke in his throat over seeing his own nine so badly eclipsed in appearance by the despised Central Grammars.  Not less astonished were the Central Grammar boy spectators themselves. Not one, outside of the baseball squad, had known that any uniforms were to be worn on the field.  \"Huh!\" remarked Ted Teall, captain of the South Grammars, to one of his lieutenants. \"We are the only school nine in town now without a uniform. When we get on the field to play we'll look like a lot of rag-pickers, won't we?\"  \"I know where they got 'em,\" choked Hi at last. \"Their principal, Old Dut Jones, wouldn't see his boys look too badly compared with us, so he bought 'em as good uniforms as he could afford. It's a shame. That's what it is.\"  If Captain Dick and his baseball players walked rather proudly onto the field, it may have been partly due to the fact that they now knew that their uniforms were anything but \"cheap.\" In point of fact, their uniforms had cost more than twice as much as those worn by Hi Martin's players.  \"How did they get such uniforms?\" That was the question that passed from lip to lip.  The answer was very simple, though as yet none of the onlookers knew what it was.  Not until one minute past four did the Central Grammar players know anything about the uniforms. Old Dut had dismissed the rest of the school, detaining Dick's players.  \"Young men, we shall now hasten up to Exhibition Hall,\" announced the principal. He marched them up there, where they found the smiling Mr. Brown, backed by an assistant. Several boxes, opened, lay upon the floor.  \"Now, young men,\" called Mr. Brown jovially, \"let us see how quickly you can take your baseball uniforms and get into them.\"  \"But what-----\" began Dick, then paused in absolute bewilderment.  \"It's all right,\" Mr. Brown cheerily assured the dazed boys. \"The uniforms are all paid for---won't cost you a cent.\"  \"But you---you told us,\" protested Captain Dick Prescott, \"that you were collecting measurements of members of schoolboys' baseball clubs.\"  \"Well, that's the truth,\" protested Brown, with a mock air of injured innocence. \"I'm a traveling salesman for the Haynes Sporting Goods Company, one of the biggest baseball outfitting companies in this part of the country. It's my business to travel and take orders.\"  \"But we didn't give you any orders,\" gasped Dave.  \"Some one did,\" laughed Mr. Brown.  \"Who did?\" blurted Tom Reade.  \"Did you, Mr. Jones?\" cried Dick.  \"Not I,\" laughed the principal. \"But I'll tell you, boys, who did. Prescott, you remember Mr. Winthrop, who is acting for Colonel Garwood in trying to find the latter's son? Amos Garwood hasn't yet been found, but Mr. Winthrop is satisfied that they are close at his heels, and that they will soon find him. Colonel Garwood is a very wealthy old man, and very fond of his missing son. Mr. Winthrop inquired how he could best serve the boys who had brought him the first word. Some one, I believe it was Len Spencer, the 'Blade' reporter, told about your not having uniforms. Mr. Winthrop wired the Haynes Company, placing an order for the best of uniforms, provided they could be finished to be delivered this afternoon. And here they are.\"  \"When do you youngsters play?\" called out Brown laughingly. \"To-day or some other day?\"  \"I would recommend you to make good time,\" Old Dut urged. \"You don't want to start the season by being late, do you. Besides the North Grammar boys might then claim the game by default.\"  That was enough to set Dick Prescott and his dazed comrades at work in earnest.  The uniforms were of blue, and of fine texture. Even baseball shoes had been provided. The stockings were blue. Then came the trousers. The blue jersey shirts bore proudly in front two golden letters each, \"C.G.\" This inscription stood, of course, for \"Central Grammar.\" Then there were coats of blue, to slip on over the jersey shirts; caps of blue and belts of blue, the latter edged with golden yellow to match the shirt initials.  Besides there were a catcher's mask, gloves for the different field players, half a dozen baseballs and an even dozen of bats.  \"Finish dressing as quickly as you can,\" urged Old Dut. \"Your time is slipping away.\"  At last they were ready. Carrying masks, bats, gloves, they fell in by twos, Principal Jones marching them from the building, along the street and into the field where their arrival had created such a furor.  Yet, excited as he was, Dick had not forgotten to ask both Mr. Brown and Old Dut not to fail to express their deepest thanks to Mr. Winthrop and to Colonel Garwood.  Ben Tozier, of the High School baseball nine, had been accepted as umpire for the day. He now came forward to meet Captain Dick's company.  \"My, but you youngsters look about the finest ever,\" announced Ben. \"I hope you can play as well as you look. Captain Prescott, do you claim any time for practice?\"  \"Not if it's time to begin playing,\" Dick answered.  \"Yes; it is. I'll call Martin, and you two will attend me for the pitch of the coin.\"  \"Wait a moment, please,\" called Hi, from across the field.  \"What's the matter?\" shouted a spectator.  \"The North Grammars want to go home and change their uniforms,\" shouted another onlooker.  There was a great laugh at this, which caused Hi Martin to color and look belligerent. He came stalking across the field.  \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" shouted Ted Teall, affecting the manner of an announcer, \"I beg to state that the game about to begin will be between two famous nines, known as the Gentlemen and the Chromos.\"  At this there was more laughter, while Hi Martin shook with rage. Looking at the bright red so prominent in the North Grammar uniforms, there could be no doubt as to which nine had been dubbed the \"Chromos.\"  \"Mr. Umpire,\" called Hi angrily, \"have you power to preserve order here to-day?\"  \"I'll do my best,\" agreed Tozier. \"But this is an open field that any one may enter, and there are no police here.\"  \"Play ball, you red-heads!\" jeered a boy, referring to the bright red caps of the North Grammars. \"Don't holler for the police until you find out whether you can stand up to the Centrals.\"  \"Now, let us stop all guying of the players and all other nonsense,\" called Tozier firmly, as he held up his right hand. \"Remember that we are here to see a game and not to listen to cheap wit.\"  That held the unruly ones back for a few moments. Tozier drew a coin from one of his pockets, exhibited it to the captains, and asked:  \"Who will call the toss?\"  \"Martin may,\" nodded Captain Dick.  \"Ready, then.\"  Ben Tozier sent the coin spinning skyward. When it turned to fall Hi called out:  \"Tails.\"  \"Heads win,\" declared Umpire Tozier.  \"Captain Martin, have you any choice?\" inquired Prescott politely.  \"I didn't win the toss,\" Hi returned sulkily.  \"But we'll give you your choice if you have any,\" Dick insisted.  \"We'd rather go to bat,\" Hi observed.  \"Then, Mr. Umpire,\" continued Dick, turning to Tozier, \"the Centrals choose the field.\"  \"Get to your places,\" nodded Ben. \"Martin at bat; Percival on deck,\" called the score-keeper.  Dick ran down to the pitcher's box, while"]]]
