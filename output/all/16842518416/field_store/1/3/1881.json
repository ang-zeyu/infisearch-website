No, Summerlee, I will have none of your materialism, for I, at least, am too great a thing to end in mere physical constituents, a packet of salts and three bucketfuls of water.  Here--here\"--and he beat his great head with his huge, hairy fist--\"there is something which uses matter, but is not of it--something which might destroy death, but which death can never destroy.\"  \"Talkin' of death,\" said Lord John.  \"I'm a Christian of sorts, but it seems to me there was somethin' mighty natural in those ancestors of ours who were buried with their axes and bows and arrows and the like, same as if they were livin' on just the same as they used to.  I don't know,\" he added, looking round the table in a shamefaced way, \"that I wouldn't feel more homely myself if I was put away with my old .450 Express and the fowlin'-piece, the shorter one with the rubbered stock, and a clip or two of cartridges--just a fool's fancy, of course, but there it is.  How does it strike you, Herr Professor?\"  \"Well,\" said Summerlee, \"since you ask my opinion, it strikes me as an indefensible throwback to the Stone Age or before it.  I'm of the twentieth century myself, and would wish to die like a reasonable civilized man.  I don't know that I am more afraid of death than the rest of you, for I am an oldish man, and, come what may, I can't have very much longer to live; but it is all against my nature to sit waiting without a struggle like a sheep for the butcher.  Is it quite certain, Challenger, that there is nothing we can do?\"  \"To save us--nothing,\" said Challenger.  \"To prolong our lives a few hours and thus to see the evolution of this mighty tragedy before we are actually involved in it--that may prove to be within my powers.  I have taken certain steps----\"  \"The oxygen?\"  \"Exactly.  The oxygen.\"  \"But what can oxygen effect in the face of a poisoning of the ether? There is not a greater difference in quality between a brick-bat and a gas than there is between oxygen and ether.  They are different planes of matter.  They cannot impinge upon one another.  Come, Challenger, you could not defend such a proposition.\"  \"My good Summerlee, this etheric poison is most certainly influenced by material agents.  We see it in the methods and distribution of the outbreak.  We should not _a priori_ have expected it, but it is undoubtedly a fact.  Hence I am strongly of opinion that a gas like oxygen, which increases the vitality and the resisting power of the body, would be extremely likely to delay the action of what you have so happily named the daturon.  It may be that I am mistaken, but I have every confidence in the correctness of my reasoning.\"  \"Well,\" said Lord John, \"if we've got to sit suckin' at those tubes like so many babies with their bottles, I'm not takin' any.\"  \"There will be no need for that,\" Challenger answered.  \"We have made arrangements--it is to my wife that you chiefly owe it--that her boudoir shall be made as airtight as is practicable.  With matting and varnished paper.\"  \"Good heavens, Challenger, you don't suppose you can keep out ether with varnished paper?\"  \"Really, my worthy friend, you are a trifle perverse in missing the point.  It is not to keep out the ether that we have gone to such trouble.  It is to keep in the oxygen.  I trust that if we can ensure an atmosphere hyper-oxygenated to a certain point, we may be able to retain our senses.  I had two tubes of the gas and you have brought me three more.  It is not much, but it is something.\"  \"How long will they last?\"  \"I have not an idea.  We will not turn them on until our symptoms become unbearable.  Then we shall dole the gas out as it is urgently needed.  It may give us some hours, possibly even some days, on which we may look out upon a blasted world.  Our own fate is delayed to that extent, and we will have the very singular experience, we five, of being, in all probability, the absolute rear guard of the human race upon its march into the unknown.  Perhaps you will be kind enough now to give me a hand with the cylinders.  It seems to me that the atmosphere already grows somewhat more oppressive.\"    Chapter III  SUBMERGED   The chamber which was destined to be the scene of our unforgettable experience was a charmingly feminine sitting-room, some fourteen or sixteen feet square.  At the end of it, divided by a curtain of red velvet, was a small apartment which formed the Professor's dressing-room. This in turn opened into a large bedroom.  The curtain was still hanging, but the boudoir and dressing-room could be taken as one chamber for the purposes of our experiment.  One door and the window frame had been plastered round with varnished paper so as to be practically sealed. Above the other door, which opened on to the landing, there hung a fanlight which could be drawn by a cord when some ventilation became absolutely necessary.  A large shrub in a tub stood in each corner.  \"How to get rid of our excessive carbon dioxide without unduly wasting our oxygen is a delicate and vital question,\" said Challenger, looking round him after the five iron tubes had been laid side by side against the wall.  \"With longer time for preparation I could have brought the whole concentrated force of my intelligence to bear more fully upon the problem, but as it is we must do what we can.  The shrubs will be of some small service.  Two of the oxygen tubes are ready to be turned on at an instant's notice, so that we cannot be taken unawares.  At the same time, it would be well not to go far from the room, as the crisis may be a sudden and urgent one.\"  There was a broad, low window opening out upon a balcony.  The view beyond was the same as that which we had already admired from the study. Looking out, I could see no sign of disorder anywhere.  There was a road curving down the side of the hill, under my very eyes.  A cab from the station, one of those prehistoric survivals which are only to be found in our country villages, was toiling slowly up the hill.  Lower down was a nurse girl wheeling a perambulator and leading a second child by the hand.  The blue reeks of smoke from the cottages gave the whole widespread landscape an air of settled order and homely comfort.  Nowhere in the blue heaven or on the sunlit earth was there any foreshadowing of a catastrophe.  The harvesters were back in the fields once more and the golfers, in pairs and fours, were still streaming round the links.  There was so strange a turmoil within my own head, and such a jangling of my overstrung nerves, that the indifference of those people was amazing.  \"Those fellows don't seem to feel any ill effects,\" said I, pointing down at the links.  \"Have you played golf?\" asked Lord John.  \"No, I have not.\"  \"Well, young fellah, when you do you'll learn that once fairly out on a round, it would take the crack of doom to stop a true golfer.  Halloa! There's that telephone-bell again.\"  From time to time during and after lunch the high, insistent ring had summoned the Professor.  He gave us the news as it came through to him in a few curt sentences.  Such terrific items had never been registered in the world's history before.  The great shadow was creeping up from the south like a rising tide of death.  Egypt had gone through its delirium and was now comatose.  Spain and Portugal, after a wild frenzy in which the Clericals and the Anarchists had fought most desperately, were now fallen silent.  No cable messages were received any longer from South America.  In North America the southern states, after some terrible racial rioting, had succumbed to the poison.  North of Maryland the effect was not yet marked, and in Canada it was hardly perceptible. Belgium, Holland, and Denmark had each in turn been affected.  Despairing messages were flashing from every quarter to the great centres of learning, to the chemists and the doctors of world-wide repute, imploring their advice.  The astronomers too were deluged with inquiries.  Nothing could be done.  The thing was universal and beyond our human knowledge or control.  It was death--painless but inevitable--death for young and old, for weak and strong, for rich and poor, without hope or possibility of escape.  Such was the news which, in scattered, distracted messages, the telephone had brought us.  The great cities already knew their fate and so far as we could gather were preparing to meet it with dignity and resignation.  Yet here were our golfers and laborers like the lambs who gambol under the shadow of the knife.  It seemed amazing.  And yet how could they know?  It had all come upon us in one giant stride.  What was there in the morning paper to alarm them?  And now it was but three in the afternoon.  Even as we looked some rumour seemed to have spread, for we saw the reapers hurrying from the fields.  Some of the golfers were returning to the club-house.  They were running as if taking refuge from a shower.  Their little caddies trailed behind them.  Others were continuing their game.  The nurse had turned and was pushing her perambulator hurriedly up the hill again.  I noticed that she had her hand to her brow.  The cab had stopped and the tired horse, with his head sunk to his knees, was resting.  Above there was a perfect summer sky--one huge vault of unbroken blue, save for a few fleecy white clouds over the distant downs.  If the human race must die to-day, it was at least upon a glorious death-bed.  And yet all that gentle loveliness of nature made this terrific and wholesale destruction the more pitiable and awful.  Surely it was too goodly a residence that we should be so swiftly, so ruthlessly, evicted from it!  But I have said that the telephone-bell had rung once more.  Suddenly I heard Challenger's tremendous voice from the hall.  \"Malone!\" he cried.  \"You are wanted.\"  I rushed down to the instrument.  It was McArdle speaking from London.  \"That you, Mr. Malone?\" cried his familiar voice.  \"Mr. Malone,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/126"],["title","The Poison Belt (#7)"],["body","are terrible goings-on in London.  For God's sake, see if Professor Challenger can suggest anything that can be done.\"  \"He can suggest nothing, sir,\" I answered.  \"He regards the crisis as universal and inevitable.  We have some oxygen here, but it can only defer our fate for a few hours.\"  \"Oxygen!\" cried the agonized voice.  \"There is no time to get any.  The office has been a perfect pandemonium ever since you left in the morning. Now half of the staff are insensible.  I am weighed down with heaviness myself.  From my window I can see the people lying thick in Fleet Street. The traffic is all held up.  Judging by the last telegrams, the whole world----\"  His voice had been sinking, and suddenly stopped.  An instant later I heard through the telephone a muffled thud, as if his head had fallen forward on the desk.  \"Mr. McArdle!\" I cried.  \"Mr. McArdle!\"  There was no answer.  I knew as I replaced the receiver that I should never hear his voice again.  At that instant, just as I took a step backwards from the telephone, the thing was on us.  It was as if we were bathers, up to our shoulders in water, who suddenly are submerged by a rolling wave.  An invisible hand seemed to have quietly closed round my throat and to be gently pressing the life from me.  I was conscious of immense oppression upon my chest, great tightness within my head, a loud singing in my ears, and bright flashes before my eyes.  I staggered to the balustrades of the stair.  At the same moment, rushing and snorting like a wounded buffalo, Challenger dashed past me, a terrible vision, with red-purple face, engorged eyes, and bristling hair.  His little wife, insensible to all appearance, was slung over his great shoulder, and he blundered and thundered up the stair, scrambling and tripping, but carrying himself and her through sheer will-force through that mephitic atmosphere to the haven of temporary safety.  At the sight of his effort I too rushed up the steps, clambering, falling, clutching at the rail, until I tumbled half senseless upon by face on the upper landing.  Lord John's fingers of steel were in the collar of my coat, and a moment later I was stretched upon my back, unable to speak or move, on the boudoir carpet.  The woman lay beside me, and Summerlee was bunched in a chair by the window, his head nearly touching his knees.  As in a dream I saw Challenger, like a monstrous beetle, crawling slowly across the floor, and a moment later I heard the gentle hissing of the escaping oxygen.  Challenger breathed two or three times with enormous gulps, his lungs roaring as he drew in the vital gas.  \"It works!\" he cried exultantly.  \"My reasoning has been justified!\" He was up on his feet again, alert and strong.  With a tube in his hand he rushed over to his wife and held it to her face.  In a few seconds she moaned, stirred, and sat up.  He turned to me, and I felt the tide of life stealing warmly through my arteries.  My reason told me that it was but a little respite, and yet, carelessly as we talk of its value, every hour of existence now seemed an inestimable thing.  Never have I known such a thrill of sensuous joy as came with that freshet of life.  The weight fell away from my lungs, the band loosened from my brow, a sweet feeling of peace and gentle, languid comfort stole over me.  I lay watching Summerlee revive under the same remedy, and finally Lord John took his turn.  He sprang to his feet and gave me a hand to rise, while Challenger picked up his wife and laid her on the settee.  \"Oh, George, I am so sorry you brought me back,\" she said, holding him by the hand.  \"The door of death is indeed, as you said, hung with beautiful, shimmering curtains; for, once the choking feeling had passed, it was all unspeakably soothing and beautiful.  Why have you dragged me back?\"  \"Because I wish that we make the passage together.  We have been together so many years.  It would be sad to fall apart at the supreme moment.\"  For a moment in his tender voice I caught a glimpse of a new Challenger, something very far from the bullying, ranting, arrogant man who had alternately amazed and offended his generation.  Here in the shadow of death was the innermost Challenger, the man who had won and held a woman's love.  Suddenly his mood changed and he was our strong captain once again.  \"Alone of all mankind I saw and foretold this catastrophe,\" said he with a ring of exultation and scientific triumph in his voice.  \"As to you, my good Summerlee, I trust your last doubts have been resolved as to the meaning of the blurring of the lines in the spectrum and that you will no longer contend that my letter in the Times was based upon a delusion.\"  For once our pugnacious colleague was deaf to a challenge.  He could but sit gasping and stretching his long, thin limbs, as if to assure himself that he was still really upon this planet.  Challenger walked across to the oxygen tube, and the sound of the loud hissing fell away till it was the most gentle sibilation.  \"We must husband our supply of the gas,\" said he.  \"The atmosphere of the room is now strongly hyperoxygenated, and I take it that none of us feel any distressing symptoms.  We can only determine by actual experiments what amount added to the air will serve to neutralize the poison.  Let us see how that will do.\"  We sat in silent nervous tension for five minutes or more, observing our own sensations.  I had just begun to fancy that I felt the constriction round my temples again when Mrs. Challenger called out from the sofa that she was fainting.  Her husband turned on more gas.  \"In pre-scientific days,\" said he, \"they used to keep a white mouse in every submarine, as its more delicate organization gave signs of a vicious atmosphere before it was perceived by the sailors.  You, my dear, will be our white mouse.  I have now increased the supply and you are better.\"  \"Yes, I am better.\"  \"Possibly we have hit upon the correct mixture.  When we have ascertained exactly how little will serve we shall be able to compute how long we shall be able to exist.  Unfortunately, in resuscitating ourselves we have already consumed a considerable proportion of this first tube.\"  \"Does it matter?\" asked Lord John, who was standing with his hands in his pockets close to the window.  \"If we have to go, what is the use of holdin' on?  You don't suppose there's any chance for us?\"  Challenger smiled and shook his head.  \"Well, then, don't you think there is more dignity in takin' the jump and not waitin' to be pushed in?  If it must be so, I'm for sayin' our prayers, turnin' off the gas, and openin' the window.\"  \"Why not?\" said the lady bravely.  \"Surely, George, Lord John is right and it is better so.\"  \"I most strongly object,\" cried Summerlee in a querulous voice.  \"When we must die let us by all means die, but to deliberately anticipate death seems to me to be a foolish and unjustifiable action.\"  \"What does our young friend say to it?\" asked Challenger.  \"I think we should see it to the end.\"  \"And I am strongly of the same opinion,\" said he.  \"Then, George, if you say so, I think so too,\" cried the lady.  \"Well, well, I'm only puttin' it as an argument,\" said Lord John.  \"If you all want to see it through I am with you.  It's dooced interestin', and no mistake about that.  I've had my share of adventures in my life, and as many thrills as most folk, but I'm endin' on my top note.\"  \"Granting the continuity of life,\" said Challenger.  \"A large assumption!\" cried Summerlee.  Challenger stared at him in silent reproof.  \"Granting the continuity of life,\" said he, in his most didactic manner, \"none of us can predicate what opportunities of observation one may have from what we may call the spirit plane to the plane of matter.  It surely must be evident to the most obtuse person\" (here he glared a Summerlee) \"that it is while we are ourselves material that we are most fitted to watch and form a judgment upon material phenomena.  Therefore it is only by keeping alive for these few extra hours that we can hope to carry on with us to some future existence a clear conception of the most stupendous event that the world, or the universe so far as we know it, has ever encountered.  To me it would seem a deplorable thing that we should in any way curtail by so much as a minute so wonderful an experience.\"  \"I am strongly of the same opinion,\" cried Summerlee.  \"Carried without a division,\" said Lord John.  \"By George, that poor devil of a chauffeur of yours down in the yard has made his last journey. No use makin' a sally and bringin' him in?\"  \"It would be absolute madness,\" cried Summerlee.  \"Well, I suppose it would,\" said Lord John.  \"It couldn't help him and would scatter our gas all over the house, even if we ever got back alive. My word, look at the little birds under the trees!\"  We drew four chairs up to the long, low window, the lady still resting with closed eyes upon the settee.  I remember that the monstrous and grotesque idea crossed my mind--the illusion may have been heightened by the heavy stuffiness of the air which we were breathing--that we were in four front seats of the stalls at the last act of the drama of the world.  In the immediate foreground, beneath our very eyes, was the small yard with the half-cleaned motor-car standing in it.  Austin, the chauffeur, had received his final notice at last, for he was sprawling beside the wheel, with a great black bruise upon his forehead where it had struck the step or mud-guard in falling.  He still held in his hand the nozzle of the hose with which he had been washing down his machine.  A couple of small plane trees stood in the corner of the yard, and underneath them lay several pathetic little balls of fluffy feathers, with tiny feet uplifted.  The sweep of death's scythe had included everything, great and small, within its swath.  Over the wall of the yard we looked down upon the winding road, which led to the station.  A group of the reapers "]]]
