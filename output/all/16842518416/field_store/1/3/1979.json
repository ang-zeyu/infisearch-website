When he had counted the sixth shot Reade dropped suddenly, picked up a stone that lay at his feet, and whirled about.  Tom Reade hadn't devoted years to ball-playing without knowing how to throw straight.  The stone left his hand, arching upward, and flew straight toward Bad Pete, who had advanced steadily as he fired.  Whiff!  Though Pete tried, too late, to dodge the stone, it landed against his sombrero, carrying that away without injuring the owner.  \"Kindly clear out!\" called Tom coolly.  \"You and your noise annoy me when I'm trying to do a big afternoon's work.\"  Snatching up his sombrero, Bad Pete vanished into a clump of brush.  Jack Rutter leaped up from his haven of safety, advancing swiftly to his cub assistant.  \"Reade,\" he exclaimed, with ungrudging admiration, \"you're the coolest young fellow I ever met, without exception.  But you're foolhardy, boy.  Bad Pete is a real shot.  One of these days, when you're just as cool, he'll fill you full of lead!\"  \"If he does?\" retorted Tom, again bending over his transit, \"and if I notice it, I'll throw a bigger stone at him than I did that time, and it'll land on him a few inches lower down.\"  \"But, boy, don't you understand that the days of David and Goliath are gone by,\" remonstrated Rutter.  \"It's true you're turned the laugh on Pete, but that fellow won't forgive you.  He may open on you again within two minutes.\"  \"I don't believe he will,\" replied Tom, with his quiet smile. \"At the same time, I'll be prepared for him.\"  Bending to the ground, and rummaging about a bit, Reade selected three stones that would throw well.  These he dropped into one of his pockets.  \"Now, let the bad man trot himself on, if he has to,\" added the cub engineer, waving a signal to the rodman, who had just halted at the next stake.  \"Well, of all the cool ones!\" grunted Rutter, under his breath. \"But, then, Reade's a tenderfoot.  He doesn't understand just how dangerous a fellow like Pete can be.\"  The chainman started away to measure the distance.  From up the hillside came sounds of smothered but very bad language.  \"There's our friend Peter again,\" Tom chuckled to Rutter.  \"Yes, and the ruffian may open on you again at any moment,\" warned Jack, keeping an anxious glance turned in the direction whence came the disturbing voice of Bad Pete.  \"Oh, I don't think he will,\" drawled Tom, making a hand signal to the leading chainman to step a little more to the left.  \"I hope not, anyway, for the noise of revolver shots takes my thoughts away from my work.\"  Jack Rutter said no more after that, though through the rest of the afternoon he kept an alert lookout for signs of Pete.  There were none, however.  Rather earlier than usual, on account of the distance back to camp, Rutter knocked off work for the entire party and the start on the return to camp was made.  Harry Hazelton was considerably excited when he heard the news of the firing on his chum.  Reade, however, appeared to be but little interested in the subject.  Pete was not in camp that evening.  Rutter went at once to the tent of the chief, to tell him how well the \"cubs\" had done during the day.  Nor did Jack forget to relate the encounter with Bad Pete.  Just as the underlings of the staff were seating themselves around the table in their mess, Mr. Thurston thrust his head in at the doorway.  \"Reade,\" called the chief engineer, \"I have heard about your trouble with Pete today.\"  \"There wasn't any real trouble, sir,\" Tom answered.  \"Fortunately for you, Reade, Pete didn't intend to hit you.  If he had meant to do so, he'd have done it.  I've seen him shoot all the spots out of a ten of clubs.  Don't provoke the fellow, Reade, or he'll shoot you full of fancy holes.  Of course it showed both grit and coolness on your part in keeping steadily on with your work all the time the fellow was firing at you.  Still, it was unwise to expose yourself needlessly to danger.\"  \"I didn't consider Bad Pete particularly dangerous,\" Tom rejoined.  \"A lawless man with a loaded revolver is hardly a safe person to trifle with,\" retorted Mr. Thurston dryly.  \"I see that I shall have to make a confession,\" smiled Tom.  \"It was this way, sir.  When Hazelton and I were on our way west Harry insisted that we were coming into a dangerous country and that we'd need firearms. So Harry bought two forty-five six-shooters and several boxes of cartridges, too.  I was provoked when I heard about it, for we hadn't any too much money, and Harry had bought the revolvers out of our joint treasury.\"  \"I felt sure we'd need the pistols,\" interrupted Hazelton.  \"Today's affair shows that I was right.  Tom, you'll have to carry one of the revolvers after this.\"  \"I'm no gun-packer,\" retorted Tom scornfully.  \"Young men have no business carting firearms about unless they're hunting or going to war.  Any fellow who carries a pistol as he would a lead pencil is either a coward or a lunatic.\"  \"I'm glad to hear you say that, Reade,\" nodded Mr. Thurston approvingly. \"Two of my staff carry pistols, but they do so under my orders. In the first place they're grown men, not boys.  In the second place, they're working over a stretch of ground where rattlesnakes are thick.  Your coolness today served you better than a pistol would have done.  If you had had a revolver, and had drawn it, Pete would have drilled you through the head.\"  \"Drilled me through the head---with what?\" asked Tom, smiling.  \"With a bullet, of course, young man,\" retorted Mr. Thurston.  \"I don't believe he would have gone as far as that,\" laughed Tom. \"You see, sir, it was like this: When I found Harry so set on carrying a pistol, I went down deep in my own pocket and bought two boxes of blank cartridges to fit the forty-fives.  I thought if Harry were going to do some shooting, it would be the part of friendship to fix him so that he could do it in safety to himself and others.\"  Harry's face turned decidedly red.  He was beginning to feel foolish.  \"Now, this morning,\" Tom continued, \"when I got the khaki out of my dunnage, I ran across the blanks.  I don't know what made me do it, but I dropped the box of blanks into one of my pockets. This noon, when I went off to find a stream where I could wash up, I almost stepped on our friend Peter, asleep under a bush. For greater comfort he had taken off his belt and holster.  Somehow, I didn't like the idea of his being there.  As softly as I could I crept close.  I emptied his revolver and fitted in blanks from my own box.  Then I took about twenty cartridges out of Peter's belt and replaced them with blanks.\"  \"Do you mean to tell me,\" broke in Rutter, \"that Bad Pete, when he turned his revolver loose on you, was shooting nothing but blanks?\"  \"That was all he had to shoot,\" Tom returned coolly.  \"And blanks were all he had in his belt to reload with.  Don't you remember when we heard him making a noise up the hillside, and talking in dots and dashes!\"  \"I do,\" nodded Rutter, looking half dazed.  \"That,\" grinned Reade, \"was when he started in to reload?  and discovered that he had nothing on hand but temperance cartridges. Here-----\" Tom began to unload one of his pockets upon the wooden table before the astonished eyes of the others.  There was a mixture of his own blank cartridges with the real ammunition that he had stealthily abstracted from Bad Pete's revolver and belt.  Such a whoop of glee ascended that the head chainman came running from the other nearby mess tent to see what was up.  \"Just a little joke among our youngsters, my man,\" explained Mr. Thurston.  \"The young gentlemen are going to keep the joke to themselves for the present, though.\"  So the mystified and disappointed chainman returned to his own crowd.  \"Let me see, Reade,\" continued Mr. Thurston, turning once more to Tom, \"what is your salary?\"  \"I was taken on, sir, at forty dollars a month, as a starter,\" Tom replied.  \"A young man with your size of head is worth more than that to the company.  We'll call it fifty a month, Reade, and keep our eyes on you for signs of further improvement,\" said the chief engineer, as he turned to go back to his own waiting dinner.     CHAPTER VI  THE BITE FROM THE BUSH   From the time that they parted in the morning, until they started to go back to camp in the afternoon, Tom and Harry did not meet the next day.  Each, with his chainmen, was served from Bob's burro train at noon.  \"Did you see Bad Pete today?\" was Harry's greeting, as they Started back over the trail.  \"No.\"  \"Did you hear from him or of him in any way?\" pressed Hazelton.  \"Not a sign of any sort from Peter,\" Tom went on.  \"I've a theory as to what's keeping him away.  He's on a journey.\"  \"Journey?\"  \"Yes; between you and me, I believe that Peter has gone in search of someone who can sell him, or give him, a few forty-five cartridges.\"  \"He'd better apply to you, then, Tom,\" grinned Harry.  \"Why, I couldn't sell him any,\" Tom replied.  \"What did you do with those you had last night?\"  \"You remember the unfordable pond that came in one of my courses yesterday?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"To-day I threw all of Peter's .45's into the middle of the pond. They must have sunk a foot into the mud by this time.\"  \"Seriously, Tom, don't you believe that you'd better take one of the revolvers that I bought and wear it on a belt?\"  \"Not I,\" retorted Reade.  \"Harry, I wish you could get that sort of foolishness out of your head.  A revolver is of no possible use to a man who hasn't any killing to do.  I'm trying to learn to be a civil engineer, not a man-killer.\"  \"Then I believe that Bad Pete will 'get' you one of these days,\" sighed Hazelton.  \"Wait until he does,\" smiled Tom.  \"Then you can have the fun of coming around and saying 'I told you so.'\"  Their chainmen were ahead of the \"cub\" engineers on the trail. Tom and Harry were talking earnestly when they heard a pony's hoofs behind them.  Hazelton turned with a start.  \"Oh, it's Rutter mounted,\" Hazelton said, with a sigh of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12734"],["title","The Young Engineers in Colorado; Or, At Railroad Building in Earnest (#8)"],["body","elief. \"I was afraid it was Bad Pete.\"  \"Take my word for it, Harry.  Peter is a good deal of a coward. He won't dare to show up until he has some real cartridges. The temperance kind do not give a man like Peter any real sense of security in the world.\"  Rutter rode along on his sure-footed mountain pony at a rapid jog.  When he came close, Tom and Harry stepped aside into the brush to let him go by on the narrow trail.  \"Don't get off into the brush that way,\" yelled Rutter from the distance.  \"We're trying to give you room,\" Tom called.  \"I don't need the room yet.  I won't run over you, anyway.  Stand out of the brush, I tell you.\"  Tom good-humoredly obeyed, Harry moving, too, though starting an instant later.  Prompt as he was, however, Tom Reade was a fraction of a second too late.  Behind them there was a half-whirring, half-clicking sound.  Then Reade felt a stinging sensation in his left leg three or four inches from the heel.  \"Look out!\" yelled Rutter, more excitedly than before.  \"Get away from there!\"  Tom ran some distance down the trail.  Then he halted, laughing.  \"I wonder what's on Rut's mind,\" he smiled, as Hazelton joined him.  Jack Rutter came at a gallop, reining up hard as he reached where Tom had stood.  Again that whirring, clicking sound.  Rutter's pony reared.  \"Still, you brute!\" commanded Rutter sternly.  Then, without waiting to see whether his mount would stand alone, Rutter leaped from saddle, going forward with his quirt---a rawhide riding whip---uplifted.  Into the brush from which Tom had stepped Rutter went cautiously, though he did not lose much time about it.  Swish! swish! swish! sounded the quirt, as Rutter laid it on the ground ahead of him.  Then he stepped out.  The pony had drawn back thirty or forty feet and now stood trembling, nostrils distended.  \"Is that the way you take your exercise?\" Reade demanded.  Rutter, however, came running along the trail, his face white as though from worry.  \"Reade,\" he demanded, \"Did that thing strike you?\"  \"What thing,\" asked Tom in wonderment.  \"The rattler that I killed!\"  \"Rattler?\" gasped both cub engineers.  \"Yes.  From the distance I thought I saw it strike out at you. There's a nest of the reptiles at some point near that brush. That's why I warned you to get away from there.  Never stand in brush, in the Rockies, unless you've looked before stepping. Were you struck?\"  \"I believe something did sting me,\" Reade admitted, remembering that smarting sensation in his left leg.  \"Which leg was it?  demanded Rutter, halting beside the cub.  \"Left---a little above the ankle,\" replied Tom.  \"Take off your legging.  I must have a look.  Hazelton, call to one of your chainmen and send him back to make sure of my pony.\"  Harry hastened to obey, then came back breathless.  Rutter, in the meantime, had turned up enough of Tom's left trousers' leg to bare a spot on the flesh that was red.  There were fang marks in the centre of this reddened surface.  \"You got it, boy,\" spoke Rutter huskily.  \"Now we'll have to go to work like lightning to save you.\"  \"How are you going to do it?\" asked Tom coolly, though he felt decidedly queer over the startling news.  \"Hazelton,\" demanded Rutter, turning upon the other cub engineer, \"have you nerve enough to put your lips to that wound, and draw, draw draw as hard as you can, and keep on until you've drawn all the poison out?\"  \"I have,\" nodded Harry, sinking to his knees beside his chum. \"I'll draw all the poison out if I have to swallow enough to kill me.\"  \"You won't poison yourself, Hazelton,\" replied Rutter quickly, as one of the chainmen came near with the recaptured pony.  \"Snake venom isn't deadly in the stomach---only when it gets into the blood direct.  There's no danger unless you've a cut or a deep scratch in your mouth.  Spit the stuff out as you draw.\"  Having given these directions, Jack Rutter turned, with the help of one of the chainmen to fasten a blanket behind the saddle to make a sort of extra saddle.  The blanket had been lying rolled at the back of the saddle.  Harry, in the meantime, without flinching, performed his task well.  Had he but known it, Rutter's explanation of the lack of danger was true; but in that moment, with his chum's life at stake, Harry didn't care a fig whether the explanation were true or not. All he thought of was saving Tom.  \"I reckon that part of the job has been done well,\" nodded Rutter, turning back from the horse.  \"Now, Reade, I want you to mount behind me and hold on tightly, for we're going to do some hard, swift riding.  The sooner we get you to camp the surer you will be of coming out of this scrape all right.\"  \"I've never had much experience in horsemanship, and I may out a sorry figure at it,\" laughed Reade, as, with Harry's help he got up behind Rutter.  \"Horsemanship doesn't count---speed does,\" replied Rutter tersely. \"Hold on tightly, and we'll make as good time as possible.  I'm going to start now.\"  Away they went, at a hard gallop, Tom doing his best to hold on, but feeling like a jumping-jack.  \"It won't take us more than twenty minutes,\" promised Jack Rutter.     CHAPTER VII  WHAT A SQUAW KNEW   All the way to camp Rutter kept the pony at a hard gallop.  \"Thurston!  Mr. Thurston!\" he shouted.  \"Be quick, please!\"  Even as the young man called, Mr. Thurston ran out of his tent.  \"You know something about rattlesnake bites, I believe?\" Rutter went on hurriedly, as Tom Reade slipped to the ground.  \"The boy has been bitten by one and we'll have to work quickly.\"  \"Don't bring any liquor, though,\" objected Reade, leaning up against a tree.  \"If liquor is your cure for snakebites I prefer to take my chances with the bite.\"  \"Get the shoe off and roll up the trousers,\" directed the chief engineer, without loss of words.  \"Fortunately, I believe we have someone here who knows more about treating the bites than I do. Squaw!\"  An Indian woman who had been sitting on the grass before the chief's tent, a medley pack of Indian baskets arranged before her, glanced up.  \"Snake!  You know what to do,\" went on Mr. Thurston hurriedly.  \"You know what to do----eh?  Pay you well.\"  At the last three magic words the aged squaw rose and hobbled quickly forward.  \"Take boy him tent,\" directed the Indian woman.  \"I can walk,\" remarked Tom.  \"No; they take you.  Heap better,\" commanded the woman.  Instantly Mr. Thurston and Rutter took hold of Tom, raising him into their arms.  Through the flap of his tent they bore him, depositing him on his cot.  The Indian woman followed them inside.  \"Now you go out,\" she ordered, with a sweep of her hand.  \"Send him cookman.  Hot water---heap boil.\"  Thus ordered, Jake Wren came on the run with a kettle of boiling water.  The Indian squaw received it with a grunt, ordering that bowls and cups be also brought.  When Wren came the second time he lingered curiously.  \"You go out; no see what do,\" said the squaw.  So Jake departed, the squaw tying the flap of the tent after he had gone.  Then, from the bosom of her dress she drew out a few small packages of herbs.  The contents of these she distributed in different bowels and cups.  \"I'd like to see what the old witch is doing, and how she's doing it,\" declared Rutter in a whisper.  \"She'll stop short if she catches you looking in on her,\" replied the chief, with a smile.  \"For some reason these Indians are very jealous of their secrets in treating snakebites.  They're wizards, though, these same red-skinned savages.\"  \"You believe, then, that she can pull Reade through?\" asked Rutter eagerly.  \"If she knows her business, and if there's any such thing as saving the boy she'll do it,\" declared Mr. Thurston, as they reached the door of the chief's tent.  \"Will you come inside, Rutter! You look badly broken up.\"  \"I am, and I shall be, just as long as Reade is in any danger,\" Rutter admitted.  \"Reade is a mighty fine boy and I'm fond of him.  Besides, more than a little of our success in getting the road through on time depends on the boy.\"  \"Is Reade really so valuable, then?\"  \"He goes over the course, Mr. Thurston, as rapidly as any man in our corps, and his work is very accurately done.  Moreover, he never kicks.  If you told him to work half the night, on top of a day's work, he'd do it.\"  \"Then Reade, if he recovers, must be watched and rewarded for anything he does for us,\" murmured Mr. Thurston.  \"Don't say, 'if he recovers,' chief,\" begged Jack.  \"I hate to think of his not pulling through from this snakebite.\"  \"What became of the reptile that did the trick?\" asked Mr. Thurston.  \"That crawler will never bite anything else,\" muttered Rutter. \"I got the thing with my riding quirt.\"  Not very long after Harry Hazelton reached camp, well in advance of the chainmen, for Harry, good school athlete that he was, had jog-trotted every step of the way in.  \"Where's Tom?\" Hazelton demanded.  \"Here,\" called a voice from Reade's tent.  Hazelton turned in that direction, but Mr. Thurston looked out from the large tent, calling:  \"Don't go there now, Hazelton.  You wouldn't be admitted.  Come here.\"  Despite his long run, Harry's face displayed pallor as he came breathlessly into Mr. Thurston's field abode.  In a few words, however, the lad was acquainted with the situation as far as it had developed.  In the meantime what was the squaw doing with Tom?  It must be admitted that Reade hadn't any too clear an idea.  The gaunt old red woman poured hot water, small quantities at a time, into the bowls and cups in which she had distributed the herbs.  Then she stirred vigorously, in the meantime muttering monotonously in her own language.  \"She isn't relying on the herbs alone,\" muttered Tom curiously to himself.  \"She's working up some kind of incantation.  I wonder what effect she expects an Indian song to have on snake poison?\"  Presently the squaw turned, bringing one of the cupfuls to the wounded boy.  \"Sit up,\" she ordered.  \"Drink!\"  Tom nearly dropped it, it was so hot.  \""]]]
