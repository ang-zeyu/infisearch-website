Macgregor spat lightly on his palms.  'I've nae time to waste.'  Willie cast his jacket on the ground.  'I'll wrastle ye,' he said, with a gleam of hope.  'Thenk ye; but I'm no for dirtyin' ma guid claes.  Come on!'  To Willie's credit, let it be recorded, he did come on, and so promptly that Macgregor, scarcely prepared, had to take a light tap on the chin.  A brief display of thoroughly unscientific boxing ensued, and then Macgregor got home between the eyes.  Willie, tripping over his own jacket, dropped to earth.  'I wasna ready that time,' he grumbled, sitting up.  Macgregor seized his hand and dragged him to his feet, with the encouraging remark, 'Ye'll be readier next time.'  In the course of the second round Willie achieved a smart clip on his opponent's ear, but next moment he received, as it seemed, an express train on the point of his nose, and straightway sat down in agony.  'Is't bled, Wullie?' Macgregor presently inquired with compunction as well as satisfaction.  'It's near broke, ye----!' groaned the sufferer, adding, 'I kent fine ye wud bate me.'  'What for did ye fecht then?'  'Nane o' your business.'  'Weel, get up.  Yer breeks'll get soakit sittin' there.'  The victor donned his jacket.  'Ma breeks is nane o' your business, neither.'  'Ach, Wullie, dinna be a wean.  Get up an' shake han's.  I've got to gang.'  'Gang then!  Awa' an' boast to yer girl that ye hut a man on his nose behind his back----'  'Havers, man!  What's wrang wi' ye?'  'I'll tell ye what's wrang wi' you, Macgreegor Robi'son!'  Willie cleared his throat noisily.  'Listen!  Ye're ower weel aff.  Ye've got a dacent fayther an' mither an' brither an' sister; ye've got a dacent uncle; ye've got a dacent girl. . . .  An' what the hell ha'e I got?  A rotten aunt!' Maybe she canna help bein' rotten, but she is--damp rotten!  She wud be gled, though she wud greet, if I got a bullet the morn.  There ye are!  That's me!'  'Wullie!' Macgregor exclaimed, holding out his hand, which the other ignored.  'I'm rotten, tae,' he went on, bitterly.  'Fine I ken it.  But I never had an equal chance wi' you.  I'm no blamin' ye.  Ye've aye shared me what ye had.  I treated ye ill aboot the enlistin'.  But I wasna gaun to enlist to please you, nor ma aunt, neither.' He rose slowly and picked up his shabby jacket.  'But, by ----, I'll enlist to please masel'!'  He held out his hand.  'There it is, if ye want it, Macgreegor. . . .  Ha'e ye a match?  Weel, show a licht.  Is ma nose queer-like?'  'Ay,' Macgregor unwillingly replied, and, with inspiration, added consolingly, 'But it was aye that, Wullie.'     IV  THE RING  'Wha' was chasin' ye?' Christina inquired, as Macgregor came breathless to the counter, which she was tidying up for the night.  'I was feart I was gaun to be late.' he panted.  'I wud ha'e excused ye under the unique circumstances,' she said graciously.  'Sit doon an' recover yer puff.'  He took the chair, saying: 'It was Wullie Thomson.  He's awa' to enlist.'  'Wullie Thomson!  Weel, that's a bad egg oot the basket.  Hoo did ye manage it, Mac?'  'It wasna me,' Macgregor replied, not a little regretfully.  'He's enlistin' to please hissel'.  He says he's fed up wi' his aunt.'  'She's been feedin' him up for a lang while, puir body.  But ye're a queer lad,' she said softly, 'the way ye stick to a fushionless character like him.  I was tellin' Miss Tod,' she continued, 'aboot----'  'Oor engagement!' he burst out, scarlet.  'Whist, man!--ye've a wild imagination!--aboot ye enlistin'.  She's been in a state o' patriotic tremulosity ever since.  Dinna be surprised if she tries for to kiss ye.'  'I wud be mair surprised,' said Macgregor, with unexpected boldness, 'if you tried it.'  'Naething could exceed ma ain amazement,' she rejoined, 'if I did.'  'I've got the ring,' he announced, his hand in his pocket.  'Order!  Remember, I'm still at the receipt o' custom--three bawbees since seeven o'clock.'  'I hope ye'll like it,' he said, reluctantly withdrawing his hand empty.  'Miss Tod canna hear us, can she?'  'Ye never can tell what a spinster'll hear when she's interested. At present she's nourishin' hersel' on tea--her nineteenth cup for the day; but she'll be comin' shortly to embrace ye an' shut the shop.  I micht as weel get on ma hat. . . .  An' 'what did yer parents say to ye?'  'They said ye was an awfu' nice, clever, bonny, handsome lassie----'  'Tit, tit!  Aboot the enlistin', I meant.  But I'll no ask ye that. They wud be prood, onyway.'  'Ma uncle's raised ma wages, an' they're to be payed a' the time I'm awa'.'  'Shakespeare!  That's a proper uncle to ha'e!  But dinna be tempted to stop awa' till ye're a millionaire.  Oh, here's Miss Tod.  Keep calm.  She'll no bite ye.'  The little elderly woman who entered had made the acquaintance of Macgregor in his early courting days, especially during the period wherein he had squandered his substance in purchases of innumerable and unnecessary lead pencils, etcetera, doubtless with a view to acquiring merit in her eyes as well as in her assistant's.  She now proceeded to hold his hand, patting it tenderly, while she murmured 'brave lad' over and over again, to his exquisite embarrassment.  'But ye'll bate the nesty Rooshians, dearie--I meant for to say the Prooshians, Christina--an' ye'll come marchin' hame a conductor or an inspector, or whatever they ca' it, wi' medals on yer breist an' riches in yer purse----'  'An' rings on his fingers an' bells----'  'Noo, noo, lassie, ye're no to mak' fun o' me!  Whaur's his case?'  Christina handed her an aluminium cigarette case--the best in the shop--and she presented it to Macgregor, saying: 'Ye're no to gang an' hurt yer health wi' smokin'; but when ye tak' a ceegarette, ye'll maybe gi'e a thocht to an auld body that'll be rememberin' ye, baith mornin' an' nicht.'  'If he smokes his usual, he'll be thinkin' o' ye every twinty meenutes,' remarked the girl, and drawing on her gloves, she came round to the door in order to close an interview which threatened to become lugubrious for all parties.       *     *     *     *     *  'Everybody's terrible kind,' Macgregor observed, when he found himself alone with Christina on the pavement.  'Will ye look at the ring noo?'  She shook her head and stepped out briskly.  After a little while he revived.  'I hope ye'll like it, Christina. It's got pearls on it.  I hope it'll fit ye.'  A long pause.  'I wish ye wud say something.'  'What'll I say?'  'Onything.  I never heard ye dumb afore.'  'Maybe I'm reformin'.'  'Christina!'  'That's ma name, but ye needna tell everybody.'  'Dinna tease.  We--we ha'e awfu' little time.  Tak' aff yer glove an' try the ring.  Naebody'll notice.  Ye can look at it later on.'  'I'm no in the habit o' acceptin' rings frae young men.'  'But--but we're engaged.'  'That's news, but I doobt it's no official.'  'At least we're near engaged.  Say we are, Christina.'  'This is most embarrassing, Mr. Robinson.'  'Aw, Christina!' said the boy, helplessly.  She let him remain in silent suspense for several minutes, until, in fact, they turned into the quiet street of her abode.  Then she casually remarked:  'Ma han's gettin' cauld wantin' its glove, Mac.'  He seized it joyfully and endeavoured to put the ring on.  'It's ower wee!' he cried, aghast.  'That's ma middle finger.'  It fitted nicely.  Triumphantly he exclaimed: '_Noo_ we're engaged!'  She had no rejoinder ready.  'Ye can tak' ma arm, if ye like,' he said presently, just a little too confidently.  'I dinna feel in danger o' collapsin' at present,' she replied, regarding the ring under the lamp they were passing.  'Ye're an extravagant thing!' she went on.  'I hope ye got it on appro.'  'What--dae ye no like it?'  'I like the feel o' it,' she admitted softly, 'an' it's real bonny; but ye--ye shouldna ha'e done it, Mac.'  She made as if to remove the ring.  He caught her hand.  'But we're engaged!'  'Ye're ower sure o' that,' she said a trifle sharply.  He stared at her.  'Firstly, I never said I wud tak' the ring for keeps,' she proceeded.  'Secondly, ye ha'ena seen ma uncle yet----'  'I'm no feart for him--if ye back me up.  Him an' yer aunt'll dae onything ye like.'  'Thirdly, ye ha'e never. . . .'  She broke off as they reached the close leading to her home.  'What ha'e I no done, Christina?'  'Never heed. . . .  Leave go ma finger.'  'Will ye keep the ring?'  'Hoo can I keep the ring when ye ha'e never. . .'  Again the sentence was not completed.  She freed her hand and stepped within the close.  'Tell me, an' I'll dae it, Christina,' he cried.  She shook her head, smiling rather ruefully.  'Tell me,' he pleaded.  'I canna--an' maybe ye wouldna like me ony better if I could.'  She took off the ring and with a wistful glance at it offered it to him.  He took it, and before she knew, it was on her finger again.  'Ye've jist got to keep it!' he said, desperately.  'An' Christina, I--I'm gaun to kiss ye!'  'Oh, mercy!'  But he had none. . . .  'Are we engaged or no?' he whispered at last.  'Let me get ma breath.'  'Hurry up!'  She laughed, though her eyes were wet.  'Oh, dear,' she murmured, 'I never thought I wud get engaged wi'oot a--a . . .'  'A what?'  Suddenly she leaned forward and touched his cheek.  'Dinna fash yersel', Mac.  Bein' in war-time, I suppose the best o' us has got to dae wi'oot some luxury or ither--sich as a proper High-Class Proposal.'     V  IN UNIFORM  There happened to be a little delay in providing the later batches of recruits with the garb proper to their battalion, and it was the Monday of their third week in training when Privates Robinson--otherwise Macgregor--and Thomson saw themselves for the first time in the glory of the kilt.  Their dismay would doubtless have been overwhelming had they been alone in that glory; even with numerous comrades in similar distress they displayed much awkwardness and self-c"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12269"],["title","Wee Macgreegor Enlists (#3)"],["body","onsciousness.  During drill Willie received several cautions against standing in a semi-sitting attitude, and Macgregor, in his anxiety to avoid his friend's error, made himself ridiculous by standing on his toes, with outstretched neck and fixed, unhappy stare.  As if to intensify the situation, the leave for which they had applied a few days previously was unexpectedly granted for that evening.  Before he realized what he was saying, Macgregor had inquired whether he might go without his kilt.  Perhaps he was not the first recruit to put it that way.  Anyway, the reply was a curt 'I don't think.'  'I believe ye're ashamed o' the uniform,' said Willie, disagreeable under his own disappointment at the verdict.  'Say it again!' snapped Macgregor.  Willie ignored the invitation, and swore by the great god Jings that he would assuredly wear breeks unless something happened.  The only thing that may be said to have happened was that he did not wear breeks.  As a matter of fact, Macgregor, with his sturdy figure, carried his kilt rather well.  The lanky William, however, gave the impression that he was growing out of it perceptibly, yet inevitably.  Four o'clock saw them started on their way, and with every step from the camp, which now seemed a lost refuge, their kilts felt shorter, their legs longer, their knees larger, their person smaller.  Conversation soon dried up.  Willie whistled tunelessly through his teeth; Macgregor kept his jaw set and occasionally and inadvertently kicked a loose stone.  Down on the main road an electric car bound for Glasgow hove in sight.  Simultaneously they started to run.  After a few paces they pulled up, as though suddenly conscious of unseemliness, and resumed their sober pace--and lost the car.  They boarded the next, having sacrificed twelve precious minutes of their leave.  Of course, they would never have dreamed of travelling  'inside'--and  yet . . .  They ascended as gingerly as a pretty girl aware of ungainly ankles surmounts a stile.  Arrived safely on the roof, they sat down and puffed each a long breath suggestive of grave peril overcome.  They covered their knees as far as they could and as surreptitiously as possible.  Presently, with the help of cigarettes, which they smoked industriously, they began to revive.  Their lips were unsealed, though conversation could not be said to gush.  They did their best to look like veterans.  An old woman smiled rather sadly, but very kindly, in their direction, and Macgregor reddened, while Willie spat in defiance of the displayed regulation.  As the journey proceeded, their talk dwindled.  It was after a long pause that Willie said:  'Ye'll be for hame as sune as we get to Glesca--eh?'  'Ay. . . .  An' you'll be for yer aunt's--eh?'  'Ay,' Willie sighed, and lowering his voice, said: 'What'll ye dae if they laugh at ye?'  'They'll no laugh,' Macgregor replied, some indignation in his assurance.  'H'm! . . .  Maybe _she'll_ laugh at ye.'  'Nae fears!'  But the confident tone was overdone.  Macgregor, after all, was not quite sure about Christina.  She laughed at so many things.  He was to meet her at seven, and of late he had lost sleep wondering how she would receive his first appearance in the kilt.  He dreaded her chaff more than any horrors of war that lay before him.  'Aw, she'll laugh, sure enough,' croaked Willie.  'I wud ha'e naething to dae wi' the weemen if I was you.  Ye canna trust them,' added this misogynist of twenty summers.  Macgregor took hold of himself.  'What'll ye dae if yer aunt laughs?' he quietly demanded.  'Her?  Gor!  I never heard her laugh yet--excep' in her sleep efter eatin' a crab.  But by Jings, if she laughs at me, I--I'll gang oot an' ha'e a beer!'  'But ye've ta'en the pledge.'  'To ----!  I forgot aboot that.  Weel, I--I'll wait an' see what she's got in for the tea first. . . .  But she _canna_ laugh.  I'll bet ye a packet o' fags she greets.'  'I'll tak' ye on!'  It may be said at once that the wager was never decided, for the simple reason that when the time came Willie refused all information--including the fact that his aunt had kissed him. Which is not, alas, to say that his future references to her were to be more respectful than formerly.        *      *      *      *      *  At three minutes before seven Macgregor stood outside Miss Tod's little shop, waiting for the departure of a customer.  It would be absurd to say that his knees shook, but it is a fact that his spirit trembled.  Suspended from a finger of his left hand was a small package of Christina's favourite sweets, which unconsciously he kept spinning all the time.  His right hand was chiefly occupied in feeling for a pocket which no longer existed, and then trying to look as if it had been doing something entirely different.  He wished the customer would 'hurry up'; yet when she emerged at last, he was not ready.  He was miserably, desperately afraid of Christina's smile, and just as miserably, desperately desirous to see it again.  Solemnly seven began to toll from a church tower.  He pulled himself up.  After all, why should she laugh?  And if she did--well. . . .  Bracing himself, he strode forward, grasped the rattling handle and pushed.  The little signal bell above the door went off with a monstrous 'ding' that rang through his spine, and in a condition of feverish moistness he entered, and, halting a pace within, saw in blurred fashion, and seemingly at a great distance, the loveliest thing he knew.  Christina did smile, but it was upon, not at, him.  And she said lightly, and by no means unkindly:  'Hullo, Mac! . . .  Ye've had yer hair cut.'  From sheer relief after the long strain, something was bound to give way.  The string on his finger snapped and the package, reaching the floor, gaily exploded.     VI  MRS. McOSTRICH ENTERTAINS  'I'm fed up wi' pairties,' was Macgregor's ungracious response when informed at home of the latest invitation.  'I dinna ask for leave jist for to gang to a rotten pairty.'  'Ay, ye've mair to dae wi' yer leave,' his father was beginning, with a wink, when his mother, with something of her old asperity, said:  'Macgreegor, that's no the way to speak o' pairties that folk gi'e in yer honour.  An' you, John, should think shame o' yersel'.  Ye should baith be sayin' it's terrible kind o' Mistress McOstrich to ask ye what nicht wud suit yer convenience.'  Macgregor regarded his mother almost as in the days when he addressed her as 'Maw'--yet not quite.  There was a twinkle in his eye.  Evidently she had clean forgotten he had grown up!  Possibly she detected the twinkle and perceived her relapse, for she went on quickly--  'Though dear knows hoo Mistress McOstrich can afford to gi'e a pairty wi' her man's trade in its present condeetion.'  'She's been daft for gi'ein' pah-ties since ever I can mind,' Mr. Robinson put in, 'an' the Kaiser hissel' couldna stop her, Still, Macgreegor, she's an auld frien', an' it wud be a peety to offend her.  Ye'll be mair at hame there nor ye was at yer Aunt Purdie's swell affair.  Dod, Lizzie, thon was a gorgeous banquet!  I never tasted as much nor ett as little; I never heard sich high-class conversation nor felt liker a nap; I never sat on safter chairs nor looked liker a martyr on tin tacks.'  Macgregor joined in his father's guffaw, but stopped short, loyalty revolting.  Aunt Purdie had meant it kindly.  'Tits, John!' said Lizzie, 'ye got on fine excep' when ye let yer wine jeelly drap on the carpet.'  'Oho, so there was wine in 't!  I fancied it was inebriated-like. But the mistak' I made was in tryin' to kep it when it was descendin'.  A duke wud jist ha'e let it gang as if a wine jeelly was naething to him.  But, d'ye ken, wife, I was unco uneasy when I discovered the bulk o' it on ma shoe efter we had withdrew to the drawin' room----'  'Haud yer tongue, man!  Macgreegor, what nicht 'll suit ye?'  'If ye say a nicht, I'll try for it; but I canna be sure o' gettin' a late pass.'  He was less uncertain when making appointments with Christina.  And Mr. Robinson once more blundered and caused his son to blush by saying: 'He wud rayther spend the evenin' wi' his intended--eh, Macgreegor?'  'But she's to be invited!' Lizzie cried triumphantly.  'So there ye are!'  'Ah, but that's no the same,' John persisted, 'as meetin' her quiet-like.  When I was courtin' you, Lizzie, did ye no prefer----'  Lizzie ignored her man--the only way.  'What aboot Friday, next week?'  'If we're no in Flanders afore then,' reluctantly replied the soldier of seven weeks' standing.        *      *      *      *      *  Happily for Mrs. McOstrich's sake Macgregor was able to keep the engagement, and credit may be given him for facing the wasted evening with a fairly cheerful countenance.  Perhaps Christina, with whom he arrived a little late, did something to mitigate his grudge against his hostess.  Mrs. McOstrich was painfully fluttered by having a real live kiltie in her little parlour, which was adorned as heretofore with ornaments borrowed from the abodes of her guests.  Though Macgregor was acquainted with all the guests, she insisted upon solemnly introducing him, along with his betrothed to each individual with the formula: 'This is Private Robi'son an' his intended.'  While Macgregor grinned miserably, Christina, the stranger, smiled sweetly, if a little disconcertingly.  Then the party settled down again to its sober pleasures. Macgregor possessed a fairly clear memory of the same company in a similar situation a dozen years ago, but the only change which now impressed itself upon him was that Mr. Pumpherston had become much greyer, stouter, shorter of breath, and was no longer funny.  And, as in the past, the prodigious snores of Mr. McOstrich, who still followed his trade of baker, sounded at intervals through the wall without causing the company the slightest concern, and were likewise no longer funny.  After supper, which consisted largely of lemonade and"]]]
