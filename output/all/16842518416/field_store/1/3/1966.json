Robard withdrew his head and a key grated in the lock.  \"Well, now what are we going to do?\" asked Hal.  \"You've got me,\" replied Chester. \"Say, do you know this reminds me of old times--of the days in France, Belgium and Russia.\"  \"You bet,\" agreed Hal, \"and those were the good old days.\"  At this juncture Uncle John moaned feebly and his eyelids fluttered. A moment later the lids opened and he gazed at Hal and Chester curiously. Then the light of comprehension dawned upon his face and he spoke:  \"So they have got us all, eh?\"  \"Yes, they've got us,\" replied Chester.  \"The trouble will be to keep us,\" said Hal. \"How do you feel, sir?\"  \"Not much,\" replied Uncle John. \"What did he hit me with, a crowbar?\"  \"No, just a revolver butt,\" replied Chester, grinning.  \"How did they happen to capture you boys?\"  \"We came back here looking for you, as soon as Hal had delivered the paper to General Ferrari,\" Chester explained.  \"Your mothers are worried almost to death,\" said Uncle John.  \"I'm afraid they will worry a whole lot more before we get out of here,\" said Chester. \"I don't know what Robard will do with us.\"  \"Perhaps we may see the Austrian ambassador,\" said Hal hopefully. \"Certainly he would stand for no such work as this.\"  \"I don't know about that,\" said Chester. \"They are likely to all be alike.\"  \"Well, we shall just have to make the best of it,\" said Hal.  \"By the way, Uncle John,\" said Chester, \"you must be considerable of a fighter. You laid these fellows out in great shape a while ago.\"  \"I did do a pretty fair job,\" admitted his uncle, \"but they made me mad.\"  \"I vote that we try to get a little sleep,\" said Hal. \"It won't be very comfortable here in these chairs, but we shall have to make the best of it. Perhaps with the coming of daylight something will turn up.\"  Chester tugged at his bonds in vain.  \"Can't budge 'em,\" he said.  Hal closed his eyes.  \"I'm going to try to get forty winks,\" he said. \"Good night.\"  Chester followed his friend's example, and Uncle John also composed himself to sleep. And in spite of their uncomfortable positions, presently all slumbered.  Hal was the first to awaken. The key turning in the lock of the door aroused him. Sunlight streamed in through the closed window. The face of Robard appeared in the door, and he entered the room.  \"Good morning,\" he said.  At the sound of his voice, Chester and Uncle John opened their eyes.  \"Good morning,\" replied Hal. \"I trust you have come to liberate us.\"  \"Of your bonds, yes,\" was the reply; \"but I regret to say that I cannot set you free.\"  \"What are you going to do with us?\"  \"Take you to Austria.\"  \"To Austria! Great Scott! What for?\"  \"For no particular reason,\" said Robard, and his face suddenly took on a savage look, \"except that you have thwarted me, and for that you shall pay. I shall probably lose my rank for my failure to obtain the papers, and if I do I want some one to take my spite out on. Do I make myself clear?\"  \"Perfectly,\" replied Hal quietly. \"It is very like a coward.\"  Robard took a threatening step forward.  \"A coward, am I?\" he cried in a loud voice.  He made as though to strike the lad, then suddenly changed his mind.  \"I'll wait,\" he said. \"I promise you shall regret those words before I am through with you.\"  \"And when do we start?\" asked Chester.  \"To-night; after dark. A special train will be ready for the Austrian ambassador and his suite. You shall go with us. Of course the ambassador shall know nothing of your presence, for he would not permit me to work out a personal grudge in this way. I shall keep you out of his sight.\"  \"The ambassador has been given his passports then?\" asked Chester.  \"He has, to Italy's sorrow. We shall wipe her off the map.\"  \"Don't forget you have a pretty sizable job on your hands already,\" said Hal.  Robard made no reply, but turning on his heel, strode from the room.     CHAPTER X.  VENICE.   As the boys had feared, they were given no opportunity to make a personal appeal to the Austrian ambassador. All day long they were kept in their improvised prison. They slept a little and talked a little, but try as they would they were unable to so much as loosen their bonds. But they all agreed on one thing, as expressed by Chester:  \"We'll make a break for freedom at the first opportunity, no matter what the odds against us.\"  One of Robard's hirelings brought them a bite to eat about noon and again shortly after 6 o'clock. Darkness fell and still Robard himself had failed to appear.  \"Maybe the time for departure has been postponed,\" said Chester.  \"Hardly,\" replied Uncle John. \"If the ambassador has been given his passports and has made arrangements to leave Italy he'll probably go at the appointed time.\"  It was at this juncture that footsteps were heard without. The key turned in the lock and a moment later Robard stood before them.  \"Well,\" he said cheerfully, \"all ready for your little trip?\"  \"We're not what you would call ready,\" replied Hal, with an attempt at levity, \"but if you say it's time to move, we may as well agree with you.\"  \"Your reasoning is to be commended,\" said Robard. He stepped to the door and raised his voice in a shout. A moment later a second man stood beside him. \"Untie these fellows while I keep them covered,\" he ordered, at the same time producing a brace of automatics.  The man stepped forward and with a few quick movements relieved the prisoners of their bonds. He stepped back.  \"Stand up!\" commanded Robard, levelling his revolvers, \"and mind, no tricks.\"  Hal, Chester and Uncle John obeyed. It was a wonderful relief to be on their feet again and be able to stretch their cramped muscles.  \"By George! this feels better,\" said Chester.  \"Rather,\" agreed Hal dryly.  Robard moved to one side of the room.  \"Out you go,\" he said, motioning toward the door with his revolver, but still keeping the three covered.  \"Which way?\" asked Hal, playing for time.  \"Out the door is all you need to know,\" was the reply. \"You'll find pleasant company there.\"  One of the revolvers covered Hal threateningly.  Hal walked toward the door, followed by Chester and then Uncle John. Robard followed close behind, with his man at his heels.  Outside the door Hal led the way down the hall toward the front door, where he saw perhaps half a dozen other figures standing about. These proved to be more Austrians. Near the door Hal halted at a word of command from Robard and the three prisoners soon were surrounded. Their captors were all dressed in civilian attire, but from their military bearings, Hal and Chester concluded that they were Austrian army officers.  Robard turned to one who stood somewhat apart from the others.  \"Everything ready?\" he asked.  \"All ready,\" was the reply. \"The baggage has been sent on ahead of us and the train to Venice will leave within the hour.\"  \"Good! And the ambassador?\"  \"Will be here within half an hour,\" was the answer.  Hal's heart leaped. Here, he thought, would be a chance to demand his freedom, and that of his companions. He was loath to believe that a man in the capacity of an ambassador would countenance such proceedings. But his hopes were doomed to disappointment.  Within the half hour mentioned, the door was flung suddenly open and a small man hurried in. He gazed quickly about him and then spoke to Robard.  \"Everything ready?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir,\" was Robard's answer.  The ambassador--for such the newcomer was--gazed rapidly about him. His eyes rested on Hal, Chester and Uncle John.  \"Who are these?\" he demanded with a wave of his hand in their direction.  \"These,\" said Robard, taking a step forward, and throwing a warning look at the three prisoners, \"are a trio who have too much knowledge of some of our plans. I thought it best to take them along, sir.\"  Hal took a quick step forward, but even as he opened his mouth to speak, he felt something cold pressed against the back of his neck by a hand from behind. He closed his lips and fell back.  The ambassador was silent a moment before replying. Then he said:  \"You are sure you are not taking too much upon yourself? You are certain you are right in your surmise?\"  \"It is not a surmise, sir; it is a fact,\" returned Robard.  For another moment the ambassador hesitated. Then he said with a shrug of his shoulders:  \"Very well then. Come; let us go.\"  He led the way out the door, the others following. Hal, Chester and Uncle John were kept closely in the center of the little knot of men as all made their way down the steps to where three large automobiles stood waiting at the curb. The ambassador and Robard climbed into the first, and Hal found himself separated from his friends as he was pushed into the second machine; Chester and Uncle John were in the third.  Twenty minutes later the three prisoners found themselves in a first class section on the special express for Venice, vigilantly guarded by two Austrians, who had been placed in charge of them after they had been securely tied up at Robard's command. Robard himself had entered another compartment with the ambassador.  \"You'll be safer this way,\" the Austrian had said with a smile, after testing their bonds to make sure they were secure.  \"Looks like we were pretty safe any way you might put us,\" replied Hal grimly.  \"You Americans are pretty slippery customers; I won't take any chances with you,\" was the rejoinder, and Robard took his leave.  A few moments later a slight motion told the prisoners that the train had started.  \"Well, here we go,\" said Chester with a laugh. \"We've been started for the enemy's country in this manner before.\"  \"Only on previous occasions our destination was Berlin instead of Venice,\" replied Hal.  \"Which is not our destination after all,\" said Uncle John. \"Our true destination is back to the hotel where we left your mothers.\"  \"And I am sure we shall reach it eventually,\" said Hal hopefully.  \"How long does it take to get to Venice?\" asked Chester.  \"I "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12684"],["title","Dorian (#0)"],["body","By  Nephi Anderson   Author of \"Added Upon,\" \"Romance of A Missionary,\" etc.         \"The Keys of the Holy Priesthood unlock the Door of Knowledge and     let you look into the Palace of Truth.\"      BRIGHAM YOUNG.

Dorian Trent was going to town to buy himself a pair of shoes. He had some other errands to perform for himself and his mother, but the reason for his going to town was the imperative need of shoes. It was Friday afternoon. The coming Sunday he must appear decently shod, so his mother had told him, at the same time hinting at some other than the Sunday reason. He now had the money, three big, jingling silver dollars in his pocket.  Dorian whistled cheerfully as he trudged along the road. It was a scant three miles to town, and he would rather walk that short distance than to be bothered with a horse. When he took Old Nig, he had to keep to the main-traveled road straight into town, then tie him to a post--and worry about him all the time; but afoot and alone, he could move along as easily as he pleased, linger on the canal bank or cut cross-lots through the fields to the river, cross it on the footbridge, then go on to town by the lower meadows.  The road was dusty that afternoon, and the sun was hot. It would be cooler under the willows by the river. At Cottonwood Corners, Dorian left the road and took the cut-off path. The river sparkled cool and clear under the overhanging willows. He saw a good-sized trout playing in the pool, but as he had no fishing tackle with him, the boy could only watch the fish in its graceful gliding in and out of sunshine and shadow. A robin overhead was making a noisy demonstration as if in alarm about a nest. Dorian sat on the bank to look and listen for a few moments, then he got up again.  Crossing the river, he took the cool foot-path under the willows. He cut down one of the smoothest, sappiest branches with which to make whistles. Dorian was a great maker of whistles, which he freely gave away to the smaller boys and girls whom he met. Just as it is more fun to catch fish than to eat them, so Dorian found more pleasure in giving away his whistles than to stuff them in his own pockets. However, that afternoon, he had to hurry on to town, so he caught no fish, and made only one whistle which he found no opportunity to give away. In the city, he attended to his mother's errands first. He purchased the few notions which the store in his home town of Greenstreet did not have, checking each item off on a slip of paper with a stub of a pencil. Then, there were his shoes.  Should he get lace or button, black or tan? Were there any bargains in shoes that afternoon? He would look about to see. He found nothing in the way of footwear on Main street which appealed to him. He lingered at the window of the book store, looking with envious eyes at the display of new books. He was well known by the bookseller, for he was a frequent visitor, and, once in a while, he made a purchase; however, to day he must not spend too much time \"browsing\" among books. He would, however, just slip around to Twenty-fifth street and take a look at the secondhand store there. Not to buy shoes, of course, but sometimes there were other interesting things there, especially books.  Ah, look here! Spread out on a table on the sidewalk in front of this second-hand store was a lot of books, a hundred or more--books of all kind--school books, history, fiction, all of them in good condition, some only a little shopworn, others just like new. Dorian Trent eagerly looked them over. Here were books he had read about, but had not read--and the prices! Dickens' \"David Copperfield\", \"Tale of Two Cities\", \"Dombey and Son\", large well-printed books, only a little shopworn, for thirty-five cents; Thackeray's \"Vanity Fair\", twenty-five cents; books by Mrs. Humphrey Ward and Margaret Deland; \"Robinson Crusoe\", a big book with fine pictures. Dorian had, of course, read \"Robinson Crusoe\" but he had always wanted to own a copy. Ah, what's this? Prescott's \"Conquest of Peru\", two volumes, new, fifty cents each! Dorian turned the leaves. A man stepped up and also began handling the books. Yes, here were bargains, surely. He stacked a number together as if he desired to secure them. Dorian becoming fearful, slipped the other volume of the Conquest under his arm and made as if to gather a number of other books under his protection. He must have some of these before they were all taken by others. The salesman now came up to him and asked:  \"Find something you want?\"  \"O, yes, a lot of things I like\" replied Dorian.  \"They're bargains.\"  Dorian needed not to be told that.  \"They're going fast, too.\"  \"Yes, I suppose so.\"  His heart fell as he said it, for he realized that he had no money to buy books. He had come to town to buy shoes, which he badly needed. He glanced down at his old shoes. They were nearly falling to pieces, but they might last a little longer. If he bought the \"Conquest of Peru\" he would still have two dollars left. Could he buy a pair of shoes for that amount? Very likely but not the kind his mother had told him to get, the kind that were not too heavy or \"stogy\" looking, but would be \"nice\" for Sundays. He held tightly on to the two books, while Dickens and Thackeray were still protectingly within his reach. What could he do?  Down there in Peru there had been a wonderful people whom Pizarro, the bad, bold Spaniard had conquered and abused. Dorian knew about it all vaguely as a dim fairy tale; and here was the whole story, beautifully and minutely told. He must have these books. This bargain might never come again to him. But what would his mother say? She herself had added the last half dollar to his amount to make sure that he could get the nicer kind.  \"Well, sir, how many of these will you have?\" asked the salesman.  \"I'll--I'll take these two, anyway\"--meaning Prescott's Conquest--\"and let me see\", he looked hungrily over the titles--\"And this one 'David Copperfield'.\" It was hard to select from so many tempting ones. Here was one he had missed: \"Ben Hur\"--, a fine new copy in blue and gold. He had read the Chariot Race, and if the whole story was as interesting as that, he must have it. He handed the volume to the salesman. Then his hand touched lovingly a number of other books, but he resisted the temptation, and said: \"That's all--this time.\"  The clerk wrapped the purchase in a newspaper and handed the package to Dorian who paid for them with his two silver dollars, receiving some small silver in change. Then, with his package under his arm, the boy walked on down the street.  Well, what now? He was a little afraid of what he had done. How could he face his mother? How could he go home without shoes? Books might be useful for the head, but they would not clothe the feet. He jingled the coins in his pocket as he walked on down to the end of the business section of the city. He could not buy any kind of shoes to fit his big feet for a dollar and twenty cents. There was nothing more to do but to go home, and \"face the music\", so he walked on in a sort of fearsome elation. At a corner he discovered a new candy store. Next to books, Dorian liked candy. He might as well buy some candy for the twenty cents. He went into the store and took his time looking at the tempting display, finally buying ten cents worth of chocolates for himself and ten cents worth of peppermint lozenges for his mother.  You see, Dorian Trent, though sixteen years old, was very much a child; he did many childish things, and yet in some ways, he was quite a man; the child in him and the man in him did not seem to merge into the boy, but were somewhat \"separate and apart,\" as the people of Greenstreet would say.  Dorian again took the less frequented road home. The sun was still high when he reached the river. He was not expected home for some time yet, so there was no need for hurry. He crossed the footbridge, noticing neither birds nor fish. Instead of following the main path, he struck off into a by-trail which led him to a tiny grass plat in the shade of a tree by the river. He sat down here, took off his hat, and pushed back from a freckled, sweating forehead a mop of wavy, rusty-colored hair. Then he untied his package of books and spread his treasures before him as a miser would his gold. He opened \"David Copperfield\", looked at the frontispiece which depicted a fat man making a very emphatic speech against someone by the name of Heep. It must all be very interesting, but it was altogether too big a book for him to begin to read now. \"Ben Hur\" looked solid and substantial; it would keep until next winter when he would have more time to read. Then he picked up the \"Conquest\", volume one. He backed up against the tree, settled himself into a comfortable position, took from his paper bag a chocolate at which he nibbled contentedly, and then away he went with Prescott to the land of the Inca and the glories of a vanished race!  For an hour he read. Then, reluctantly, he closed his book, wrapped up his package again, and went on his"]]]
