We will, however, begin at the beginning.  Bailey was all alone in the house, for his housekeeper had gone into the town three miles away to pay bills, and the servant had her holiday. The morning began dull. A canoe went up about half-past nine, and later a boat-load of camping men came down. But this was mere margin. Things became cheerful about ten o'clock.  It began with something white fluttering in the remote distance where the three poplars marked the river bend. \"Pocket-handkerchief,\" said Bailey, when he saw it \"No. Too big! Flag perhaps.\"  However, it was not a flag, for it jumped about. \"Man in whites running fast, and this way,\" said Bailey. \"That's luck! But his whites are precious loose!\"  Then a singular thing happened. There was a minute pink gleam among the dark trees in the distance, and a little puff of pale grey that began to drift and vanish eastward. The man in white jumped and continued running. Presently the report of the shot arrived.  \"What the devil!\" said Bailey. \"Looks as if someone was shooting at him.\"  He sat up stiffly and stared hard. The white figure was coming along the pathway through the corn. \"It's one of those niggers from the Fitzgibbon's,\" said Bailey; \"or may I be hanged! I wonder why he keeps sawing with his arm.\"  Then three other figures became indistinctly visible against the dark background of the trees.  Abruptly on the opposite bank a man walked into the picture. He was black-bearded, dressed in flannels, had a red belt, and a vast grey felt hat. He walked, leaning very much forward and with his hands swinging before him. Behind him one could see the grass swept by the towing-rope of the boat he was dragging. He was steadfastly regarding the white figure that was hurrying through the corn. Suddenly he stopped. Then, with a peculiar gesture, Bailey could see that he began pulling in the tow-rope hand over hand. Over the water could be heard the voices of the people in the still invisible boat.  \"What are you after, Hagshot?\" said someone.  The individual with the red belt shouted something that was inaudible, and went on lugging in the rope, looking over his shoulder at the advancing white figure as he did so. He came down the bank, and the rope bent a lane among the reeds and lashed the water between his pulls.  Then just the bows of the boat came into view, with the towing-mast and a tall, fair-haired man standing up and trying to see over the bank. The boat bumped unexpectedly among the reeds, and the tall, fair-haired man disappeared suddenly, having apparently fallen back into the invisible part of the boat. There was a curse and some indistinct laughter. Hagshot did not laugh, but hastily clambered into the boat and pushed off. Abruptly the boat passed out of Bailey's sight.  But it was still audible. The melody of voices suggested that its occupants were busy telling each other what to do.  The running figure was drawing near the bank. Bailey could now see clearly that it was one of Fitzgibbon's Orientals, and began to realise what the sinuous thing the man carried in his hand might be. Three other men followed one another through the corn, and the foremost carried what was probably the gun. They were perhaps two hundred yards or more behind the Malay.  \"It's a man hunt, by all that's holy!\" said Bailey.  The Malay stopped for a moment and surveyed the bank to the right. Then he left the path, and, breaking through the corn, vanished in that direction. The three pursuers followed suit, and their heads and gesticulating arms above the corn, after a brief interval, also went out of Bailey's field of vision.  Bailey so far forgot himself as to swear. \"Just as things were getting lively!\" he said. Something like a woman's shriek came through the air. Then shouts, a howl, a dull whack upon the balcony outside that made Bailey jump, and then the report of a gun.  \"This is precious hard on an invalid,\" said Bailey.  But more was to happen yet in his picture. In fact, a great deal more. The Malay appeared again, running now along the bank up stream. His stride had more swing and less pace in it than before. He was threatening someone ahead with the ugly krees he carried. The blade, Bailey noticed, was dull--it did not shine as steel should.  Then came the tall, fair man, brandishing a boat-hook, and after him three other men in boating costume, running clumsily with oars. The man with the grey hat and red belt was not with them. After an interval the three men with the gun reappeared, still in the corn, but now near the river bank. They emerged upon the towing-path, and hurried after the others. The opposite bank was left blank and desolate again.  The sick-room was disgraced by more profanity. \"I would give my life to see the end of this,\" said Bailey. There were indistinct shouts up stream. Once they seemed to be coming nearer, but they disappointed him.  Bailey sat and grumbled. He was still grumbling when his eye caught something black and round among the waves. \"Hullo!\" he said. He looked narrowly and saw two triangular black bodies frothing every now and then about a yard in front of this.  He was still doubtful when the little band of pursuers came into sight again, and began to point to this floating object. They were talking eagerly. Then the man with the gun took aim.  \"He's swimming the river, by George!\" said Bailey.  The Malay looked round, saw the gun, and went under. He came up so close to Bailey's bank of the river that one of the bars of the balcony hid him for a moment. As he emerged the man with the gun fired. The Malay kept steadily onward--Bailey could see the wet hair on his forehead now and the krees between his teeth--and was presently hidden by the balcony.  This seemed to Bailey an unendurable wrong. The man was lost to him for ever now, so he thought. Why couldn't the brute have got himself decently caught on the opposite bank, or shot in the water?  \"It's worse than Edwin Drood,\" said Bailey.  Over the river, too, things had become an absolute blank. All seven men had gone down stream again, probably to get the boat and follow across. Bailey listened and waited. There was silence. \"Surely it's not over like this,\" said Bailey.  Five minutes passed--ten minutes. Then a tug with two barges went up stream. The attitudes of the men upon these were the attitudes of those who see nothing remarkable in earth, water, or sky. Clearly the whole affair had passed out of sight of the river. Probably the hunt had gone into the beech woods behind the house.  \"Confound it!\" said Bailey. \"To be continued again, and no chance this time of the sequel. But this is hard on a sick man.\"  He heard a step on the staircase behind him and looking round saw the door open. Mrs Green came in and sat down, panting. She still had her bonnet on, her purse in her hand, and her little brown basket upon her arm. \"Oh, there!\" she said, and left Bailey to imagine the rest.  \"Have a little whisky and water, Mrs Green, and tell me about it,\" said Bailey.  Sipping a little, the lady began to recover her powers of explanation.  One of those black creatures at the Fitzgibbon's had gone mad, and was running about with a big knife, stabbing people. He had killed a groom, and stabbed the under-butler, and almost cut the arm off a boating gentleman.  \"Running amuck with a krees,\" said Bailey. \"I thought that was it.\"  And he was hiding in the wood when she came through it from the town.  \"What! Did he run after you?\" asked Bailey, with a certain touch of glee in his voice.  \"No, that was the horrible part of it,\" Mrs Green explained. She had been right through the woods and had _never known he was there_. It was only when she met young Mr Fitzgibbon carrying his gun in the shrubbery that she heard anything about it. Apparently, what upset Mrs Green was the lost opportunity for emotion. She was determined, however, to make the most of what was left her.  \"To think he was there all the time!\" she said, over and over again.  Bailey endured this patiently enough for perhaps ten minutes. At last he thought it advisable to assert himself. \"It's twenty past one, Mrs Green,\" he said. \"Don't you think it time you got me something to eat?\"  This brought Mrs Green suddenly to her knees.  \"Oh Lord, sir!\" she said. \"Oh! don't go making me go out of this room, sir, till I know he's caught. He might have got into the house, sir. He might be creeping, creeping, with that knife of his, along the passage this very--\"  She broke off suddenly and glared over him at the window. Her lower jaw dropped. Bailey turned his head sharply.  For the space of half a second things seemed just as they were. There was the tree, the balcony, the shining river, the distant church tower. Then he noticed that the acacia was displaced about a foot to the right, and that it was quivering, and the leaves were rustling. The tree was shaken violently, and a heavy panting was audible.  In another moment a hairy brown hand had appeared and clutched the balcony railings, and in another the face of the Malay was peering through these at the man on the couch. His expression was an unpleasant grin, by reason of the krees he held between his teeth, and he was bleeding from an ugly wound in his cheek. His hair wet to drying stuck out like horns from his head. His body was bare save for the wet trousers that clung to him. Bailey's first impulse was to spring from the couch, but his legs reminded him that this was impossible.  By means of the balcony and tree the man slowly raised himself until he was visible to Mrs Green. With a choking cry she made for the door and fumbled with the handle.  Bailey thought swiftly and clutched a medicine bottle in either hand. One he flung, and it smashed against the acacia. Silently and deliberately, and keeping his bright eyes fixed on Bailey, the Malay clambered into the balcony. Bailey, still clutching his second"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12750"],["title","The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents (#8)"],["body","ttle, but with a sickening, sinking feeling about his heart, watched first one leg come over the railing and then the other.  It was Bailey's impression that the Malay took about an hour to get his second leg over the rail. The period that elapsed before the sitting position was changed to a standing one seemed enormous--days, weeks, possibly a year or so. Yet Bailey had no clear impression of anything going on in his mind during that vast period, except a vague wonder at his inability to throw the second medicine bottle. Suddenly the Malay glanced over his shoulder. There was the crack of a rifle. He flung up his arms and came down upon the couch. Mrs Green began a dismal shriek that seemed likely to last until Doomsday. Bailey stared at the brown body with its shoulder blade driven in, that writhed painfully across his legs and rapidly staining and soaking the spotless bandages. Then he looked at the long krees, with the reddish streaks upon its blade, that lay an inch beyond the trembling brown fingers upon the floor. Then at Mrs Green, who had backed hard against the door and was staring at the body and shrieking in gusty outbursts as if she would wake the dead. And then the body was shaken by one last convulsive effort.  The Malay gripped the krees, tried to raise himself with his left hand, and collapsed. Then he raised his head, stared for a moment at Mrs Green, and twisting his face round looked at Bailey. With a gasping groan the dying man succeeded in clutching the bed clothes with his disabled hand, and by a violent effort, which hurt Bailey's legs exceedingly, writhed sideways towards what must be his last victim. Then something seemed released in Bailey's mind and he brought down the second bottle with all his strength on to the Malay's face. The krees fell heavily upon the floor.  \"Easy with those legs,\" said Bailey, as young Fitzgibbon and one of the boating party lifted the body off him.  Young Fitzgibbon was very white in the face. \"I didn't mean to kill him,\" he said.  \"It's just as well,\" said Bailey.     THE TEMPTATION OF HARRINGAY   It is quite impossible to say whether this thing really happened. It depends entirely on the word of R.M. Harringay, who is an artist.  Following his version of the affair, the narrative deposes that Harringay went into his studio about ten o'clock to see what he could make of the head that he had been working at the day before. The head in question was that of an Italian organ-grinder, and Harringay thought--but was not quite sure--that the title would be the \"Vigil.\" So far he is frank, and his narrative bears the stamp of truth. He had seen the man expectant for pennies, and with a promptness that suggested genius, had had him in at once.  \"Kneel. Look up at that bracket,\" said Harringay. \"As if you expected pennies.\"  \"Don't _grin_!\" said Harringay. \"I don't want to paint your gums. Look as though you were unhappy.\"  Now, after a night's rest, the picture proved decidedly unsatisfactory. \"It's good work,\" said Harringay. \"That little bit in the neck ... But.\"  He walked about the studio and looked at the thing from this point and from that. Then he said a wicked word. In the original the word is given.  \"Painting,\" he says he said. \"Just a painting of an organ-grinder--a mere portrait. If it was a live organ-grinder I wouldn't mind. But somehow I never make things alive. I wonder if my imagination is wrong.\" This, too, has a truthful air. His imagination _is_ wrong.  \"That creative touch! To take canvas and pigment and make a man--as Adam was made of red ochre! But this thing! If you met it walking about the streets you would know it was only a studio production. The little boys would tell it to 'Garnome and git frimed.' Some little touch ... Well--it won't do as it is.\"  He went to the blinds and began to pull them down. They were made of blue holland with the rollers at the bottom of the window, so that you pull them down to get more light. He gathered his palette, brushes, and mahl stick from his table. Then he turned to the picture and put a speck of brown in the corner of the mouth; and shifted his attention thence to the pupil of the eye. Then he decided that the chin was a trifle too impassive for a vigil.  Presently he put down his impedimenta, and lighting a pipe surveyed the progress of his work. \"I'm hanged if the thing isn't sneering at me,\" said Harringay, and he still believes it sneered.  The animation of the figure had certainly increased, but scarcely in the direction he wished. There was no mistake about the sneer. \"Vigil of the Unbeliever,\" said Harringay. \"Rather subtle and clever that! But the left eyebrow isn't cynical enough.\"  He went and dabbed at the eyebrow, and added a little to the lobe of the ear to suggest materialism. Further consideration ensued. \"Vigil's off, I'm afraid,\" said Harringay. \"Why not Mephistopheles? But that's a bit _too_ common. 'A Friend of the Doge,'--not so seedy. The armour won't do, though. Too Camelot. How about a scarlet robe and call him 'One of the Sacred College'? Humour in that, and an appreciation of Middle Italian History.\"  \"There's always Benvenuto Cellini,\" said Harringay; \"with a clever suggestion of a gold cup in one corner. But that would scarcely suit the complexion.\"  He describes himself as babbling in this way in order to keep down an unaccountably unpleasant sensation of fear. The thing was certainly acquiring anything but a pleasing expression. Yet it was as certainly becoming far more of a living thing than it had been--if a sinister one--far more alive than anything he had ever painted before. \"Call it 'Portrait of a Gentleman,'\" said Harringay;--\"A Certain Gentleman.\"  \"Won't do,\" said Harringay, still keeping up his courage. \"Kind of thing they call Bad Taste. That sneer will have to come out. That gone, and a little more fire in the eye--never noticed how warm his eye was before--and he might do for--? What price Passionate Pilgrim? But that devilish face won't do--_this_ side of the Channel.  \"Some little inaccuracy does it,\" he said; \"eyebrows probably too oblique,\"--therewith pulling the blind lower to get a better light, and resuming palette and brushes.  The face on the canvas seemed animated by a spirit of its own. Where the expression of diablerie came in he found impossible to discover. Experiment was necessary. The eyebrows--it could scarcely be the eyebrows? But he altered them. No, that was no better; in fact, if anything, a trifle more satanic. The corner of the mouth? Pah! more than ever a leer--and now, retouched, it was ominously grim. The eye, then? Catastrophe! he had filled his brush with vermilion instead of brown, and yet he had felt sure it was brown! The eye seemed now to have rolled in its socket, and was glaring at him an eye of fire. In a flash of passion, possibly with something of the courage of panic, he struck the brush full of bright red athwart the picture; and then a very curious thing, a very strange thing indeed, occurred--if it _did_ occur.  _The diabolified Italian before him shut both his eyes, pursed his mouth, and wiped the colour off his face with his hand_.  Then the _red eye_ opened again, with a sound like the opening of lips, and the face smiled. \"That was rather hasty of you,\" said the picture.  Harringay states that, now that the worst had happened, his self-possession returned. He had a saving persuasion that devils were reasonable creatures.  \"Why do you keep moving about then,\" he said, \"making faces and all that--sneering and squinting, while I am painting you?\"  \"I don't,\" said the picture.  \"You _do_,\" said Harringay.  \"It's yourself,\" said the picture.  \"It's _not_ myself,\" said Harringay.  \"It _is_ yourself,\" said the picture. \"No! don't go hitting me with paint again, because it's true. You have been trying to fluke an expression on my face all the morning. Really, you haven't an idea what your picture ought to look like.\"  \"I have,\" said Harringay.  \"You have _not_,\" said the picture: \"You _never_ have with your pictures. You always start with the vaguest presentiment of what you are going to do; it is to be something beautiful--you are sure of that--and devout, perhaps, or tragic; but beyond that it is all experiment and chance. My dear fellow! you don't think you can paint a picture like that?\"  Now it must be remembered that for what follows we have only Harringay's word.  \"I shall paint a picture exactly as I like,\" said Harringay, calmly.  This seemed to disconcert the picture a little. \"You can't paint a picture without an inspiration,\" it remarked.  \"But I _had_ an inspiration--for this.\"  \"Inspiration!\" sneered the sardonic figure; \"a fancy that came from your seeing an organ-grinder looking up at a window! Vigil! Ha, ha! You just started painting on the chance of something coming--that's what you did. And when I saw you at it I came. I want a talk with you!\"  \"Art, with you,\" said the picture,--\"it's a poor business. You potter. I don't know how it is, but you don't seem able to throw your soul into it. You know too much. It hampers you. In the midst of your enthusiasms you ask yourself whether something like this has not been done before. And ...\"  \"Look here,\" said Harringay, who had expected something better than criticism from the devil. \"Are you going to talk studio to me?\" He filled his number twelve hoghair with red paint.  \"The true artist,\" said the picture, \"is always an ignorant man. An artist who theorises about his work is no longer artist but critic. Wagner ... I say!--What's that red paint for?\"  \"I'm going to paint you out,\" said Harringay. \"I don't want to hear all that Tommy Rot. If you think just because I'm an artist by trade I'm going to talk studio to you, you make a precious mistake.\"  \"One minute,\" said the picture, evidently alarmed. \"I want to make you an offer--a genuine offer. It's right what I'm saying. You lack inspirations. Well. No doubt you've heard of the Cathedral of Cologne, and"]]]
