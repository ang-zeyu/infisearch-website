AT THE FERRY       On such a day the shrunken stream       Spends its last water and runs dry;     Clouds like far turrets in a dream       Stand baseless in the burning sky.     On such a day at every rod       The toilers in the hay-field halt,     With dripping brows, and the parched sod       Yields to the crushing foot like salt.      But here a little wind astir,       Seen waterward in jetting lines,     From yonder hillside topped with fir       Comes pungent with the breath of pines;     And here when all the noon hangs still,       White-hot upon the city tiles,     A perfume and a wintry chill       Breathe from the yellow lumber-piles.      And all day long there falls a blur       Of noises upon listless ears,     The rumble of the trams, the stir       Of barges at the clacking piers;     The champ of wheels, the crash of steam,       And ever, without change or stay,     The drone, as through a troubled dream,       Of waters falling far away.      A tug-boat up the farther shore       Half pants, half whistles, in her draught;     The cadence of a creaking oar       Falls drowsily; a corded raft     Creeps slowly in the noonday gleam,       And wheresoe'er a shadow sleeps     The men lie by, or half a-dream,       Stand leaning at the idle sweeps.      And all day long in the quiet bay       The eddying amber depths retard,     And hold, as in a ring, at play,       The heavy saw-logs notched and scarred;     And yonder between cape and shoal,       Where the long currents swing and shift,     An aged punt-man with his pole       Is searching in the parted drift.      At moments from the distant glare       The murmur of a railway steals     Round yonder jutting point the air       Is beaten with the puff of wheels;     And here at hand an open mill,       Strong clamor at perpetual drive,     With changing chant, now hoarse, now shrill,       Keeps dinning like a mighty hive.      A furnace over field and mead,       The rounding noon hangs hard and white;     Into the gathering heats recede       The hollows of the Chelsea height;     But under all to one quiet tune,       A spirit in cool depths withdrawn,     With logs, and dust, and wrack bestrewn,       The stately river journeys on.      I watch the swinging currents go       Far down to where, enclosed and piled,     The logs crowd, and the Gatineau       Comes rushing from the northern wild.     I see the long low point, where close       The shore-lines, and the waters end,     I watch the barges pass in rows       That vanish at the tapering bend.      I see as at the noon's pale core--       A shadow that lifts clear and floats--     The cabin'd village round the shore,       The landing and the fringe of boats;     Faint films of smoke that curl and wreathe,       And upward with the like desire     The vast gray church that seems to breathe       In heaven with its dreaming spire.      And there the last blue boundaries rise,       That guard within their compass furled     This plot of earth: beyond them lies       The mystery of the echoing world;     And still my thought goes on, and yields       New vision and new joy to me,     Far peopled hills, and ancient fields,       And cities by the crested sea.      I see no more the barges pass,       Nor mark the ripple round the pier,     And all the uproar, mass on mass,       Falls dead upon a vacant ear.     Beyond the tumult of the mills,       And all the city's sound and strife,     Beyond the waste, beyond the hills,       I look far out and dream of life.     SEPTEMBER       Now hath the summer reached her golden close,       And, lost amid her corn-fields, bright of soul,     Scarcely perceives from her divine repose       How near, how swift, the inevitable goal:     Still, still, she smiles, though from her careless feet       The bounty and the fruitful strength are gone,       And through the soft long wondering days goes on     The silent sere decadence sad and sweet.      The kingbird and the pensive thrush are fled,       Children of light, too fearful of the gloom;     The sun falls low, the secret word is said,       The mouldering woods grow silent as the tomb;     Even the fields have lost their sovereign grace,       The cone-flower and the marguerite; and no more,       Across the river's shadow-haunted floor,     The paths of skimming swallows interlace.      Already in the outland wilderness       The forests echo with unwonted dins;     In clamorous gangs the gathering woodmen press       Northward, and the stern winter's toil begins.     Around the long low shanties, whose rough lines       Break the sealed dreams of many an unnamed lake,       Already in the frost-clear morns awake     The crash and thunder of the falling pines.      Where the tilled earth, with all its fields set free,       Naked and yellow from the harvest lies,     By many a loft and busy granary,       The hum and tumult of the thrashers rise;     There the tanned farmers labor without slack,       Till twilight deepens round the spouting mill,       Feeding the loosened sheaves, or with fierce will,     Pitching waist-deep upon the dusty stack.      Still a brief while, ere the old year quite pass,       Our wandering steps and wistful eyes shall greet     The leaf, the water, the beloved grass;       Still from these haunts and this accustomed seat     I see the wood-wrapt city, swept with light,       The blue long-shadowed distance, and, between,       The dotted farm-lands with their parcelled green,     The dark pine forest and the watchful height.      I see the broad rough meadow stretched away       Into the crystal sunshine, wastes of sod,     Acres of withered vervain, purple-gray,       Branches of aster, groves of goldenrod;     And yonder, toward the sunlit summit, strewn       With shadowy boulders, crowned and swathed with weed,       Stand ranks of silken thistles, blown to seed,     Long silver fleeces shining like the noon.      In far-off russet corn-fields, where the dry       Gray shocks stand peaked and withering, half concealed     In the rough earth, the orange pumpkins lie,       Full-ribbed; and in the windless pasture-field     The sleek red horses o'er the sun-warmed ground       Stand pensively about in companies,       While all around them from the motionless trees     The long clean shadows sleep without a sound.      Under cool elm-trees floats the distant stream,       Moveless as air; and o'er the vast warm earth     The fathomless daylight seems to stand and dream,       A liquid cool elixir--all its girth     Bound with faint haze, a frail transparency,       Whose lucid purple barely veils and fills       The utmost valleys and the thin last hills,     Nor mars one whit their perfect clarity.      Thus without grief the golden days go by,       So soft we scarcely notice how they wend,     And like a smile half happy, or a sigh,       The summer passes to her quiet end;     And soon, too soon, around the cumbered eaves       Sly frosts shall take the creepers by surprise,       And through the wind-touched reddening woods shall rise     October with the rain of ruined leaves.     A RE-ASSURANCE       With what doubting eyes, oh sparrow,         Thou regardest me,     Underneath yon spray of yarrow,         Dipping cautiously.      Fear me not, oh little sparrow,         Bathe and never fear,     For to me both pool and yarrow         And thyself are dear.     THE POET'S POSSESSION       Think not, oh master of the well-tilled field,     This earth is only thine; for after thee,     When all is sown and gathered and put by,     Comes the grave poet with creative eye,     And from these silent acres and clean plots,     Bids with his wand the fancied after-yield,     A second tilth and second harvest, be,     The crop of images and curious thoughts.     AN AUTUMN LANDSCAPE       No wind there is that either pipes or moans;       The fields are cold and still; the sky         Is covered with a blue-gray sheet         Of motionless cloud; and at my feet       The river, curling softly by,     Whispers and dimples round its quiet gray stones.      Along the chill green slope that dips and heaves       The road runs rough and silent, lined         With plum-trees, misty and blue-gray,         And poplars pallid as the day,       In masses spectral, undefined,     Pale greenish stems half hid in dry gray leaves.      And on beside the river's sober edge       A long fresh field lies black. Beyond,         Low thickets gray and reddish stand,         Stroked white with birch; and near at hand,       Over a little steel-smooth pond,     Hang multitudes of thin and withering sedge.      Across a waste and solitary rise       A ploughman urges his dull team,         A stooped gray figure with prone brow         That plunges bending to the plough       With strong, uneven steps. The stream     Rings and re-echoes with his furious cries.      Sometimes the lowing of a cow, long-drawn,       Comes from far off; and crows in strings         Pass on the upper silences.         A flock of small gray goldfinches,       Flown down with silvery twitterings,     Rustle among the birch-cones and are gone.      This day the season seems like one that heeds,       With fix√®d ear and lifted hand,         All moods that yet are known on earth,         All motions that have faintest birth,       If haply she may understand     The utmost inward sense of all her deeds.     IN NOVEMBER       With loitering step and quiet eye,     Beneath the low November sky,     I wandered in the woods, and found     A clearing, where the broken ground     Was scattered with black stumps and briers,     And the old wreck of forest fires.     It was a bleak and sandy spot,     And, all about, the vacant plot     Was peopled and inhabited     By scores of mulleins long since dead.     A silent and forsaken brood     In that mute opening of the wood,     So"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12664"],["title","Lyrics of Earth (#4)"],["body","and so thin they were,     So gray, so haggard, and austere,     Not plants at all they seemed to me,     But rather some spare company     Of hermit folk, who long ago,     Wandering in bodies to and fro,     Had chanced upon this lonely way,     And rested thus, till death one day     Surprised them at their compline prayer,     And left them standing lifeless there.      There was no sound about the wood     Save the wind's secret stir. I stood     Among the mullein-stalks as still     As if myself had grown to be     One of their sombre company,     A body without wish or will.     And as I stood, quite suddenly,     Down from a furrow in the sky     The sun shone out a little space     Across that silent sober place,     Over the sand heaps and brown sod,     The mulleins and dead goldenrod,     And passed beyond the thickets gray,     And lit the fallen leaves that lay,     Level and deep within the wood,     A rustling yellow multitude.      And all around me the thin light,     So sere, so melancholy bright,     Fell like the half-reflected gleam     Or shadow of some former dream;     A moment's golden revery     Poured out on every plant and tree     A semblance of weird joy, or less,     A sort of spectral happiness;     And I, too, standing idly there,     With muffled hands in the chill air,     Felt the warm glow about my feet,     And shuddering betwixt cold and heat,     Drew my thoughts closer, like a cloak,     While something in my blood awoke,     A nameless and unnatural cheer,     A pleasure secret and austere.     BY AN AUTUMN STREAM       Now overhead,     Where the rivulet loiters and stops,     The bittersweet hangs from the tops     Of the alders and cherries     Its bunches of beautiful berries,     Orange and red.      And the snowbirds flee,     Tossing up on the far brown field,     Now flashing and now concealed,     Like fringes of spray     That vanish and gleam on the gray     Field of the sea.      Flickering light,     Come the last of the leaves down borne,     And patches of pale white corn     In the wind complain,     Like the slow rustle of rain     Noticed by night.      Withered and thinned,     The sentinel mullein looms,     With the pale gray shadowy plumes     Of the goldenrod;     And the milkweed opens its pod,     Tempting the wind.      Aloft on the hill,     A cloudrift opens and shines     Through a break in its gorget of pines,     And it dreams at my feet     In a sad, silvery sheet,     Utterly still.      All things that be     Seem plunged into silence, distraught,     By some stern, some necessitous thought:     It wraps and enthralls     Marsh, meadow, and forest; and falls     Also on me.     SNOWBIRDS       Along the narrow sandy height       I watch them swiftly come and go,         Or round the leafless wood,       Like flurries of wind-driven snow,     Revolving in perpetual flight,         A changing multitude.      Nearer and nearer still they sway,       And, scattering in a circled sweep,         Rush down without a sound;       And now I see them peer and peep,     Across yon level bleak and gray,         Searching the frozen ground,--      Until a little wind upheaves,       And makes a sudden rustling there,         And then they drop their play,       Flash up into the sunless air,     And like a flight of silver leaves         Swirl round and sweep away.     SNOW       White are the far-off plains, and white         The fading forests grow;     The wind dies out along the height,         And denser still the snow,     A gathering weight on roof and tree,         Falls down scarce audibly.      The road before me smooths and fills         Apace, and all about     The fences dwindle, and the hills         Are blotted slowly out;     The naked trees loom spectrally         Into the dim white sky.      The meadows and far-sheeted streams         Lie still without a sound;     Like some soft minister of dreams         The snow-fall hoods me round;     In wood and water, earth and air,         A silence everywhere.      Save when at lonely intervals         Some farmer's sleigh, urged on,     With rustling runners and sharp bells,         Swings by me and is gone;     Or from the empty waste I hear         A sound remote and clear;      The barking of a dog, or call         To cattle, sharply pealed,     Borne echoing from some wayside stall         Or barnyard far a-field;     Then all is silent, and the snow         Falls, settling soft and slow.      The evening deepens, and the gray         Folds closer earth and sky;     The world seems shrouded far away;         Its noises sleep, and I,     As secret as yon buried stream,         Plod dumbly on, and dream.     SUNSET       From this windy bridge at rest,     In some former curious hour,     We have watched the city's hue,     All along the orange west,     Cupola and pointed tower,     Darken into solid blue.      Tho' the biting north wind breaks     Full across this drifted hold,     Let us stand with ic√®d cheeks     Watching westward as of old;      Past the violet mountain-head     To the farthest fringe of pine,     Where far off the purple-red     Narrows to a dusky line,     And the last pale splendors die     Slowly from the olive sky;      Till the thin clouds wear away     Into threads of purple-gray,     And the sudden stars between     Brighten in the pallid green;      Till above the spacious east,     Slow return√®d one by one,     Like pale prisoners released     From the dungeons of the sun,     Capella and her train appear     In the glittering Charioteer;      Till the rounded moon shall grow     Great above the eastern snow,     Shining into burnished gold;     And the silver earth outrolled,     In the misty yellow light,     Shall take on the width of night.     WINTER-STORE       Subtly conscious, all awake,     Let us clear our eyes, and break     Through the cloudy chrysalis,     See the wonder as it is.     Down a narrow alley, blind,     Touch and vision, heart and mind;     Turned sharply inward, still we plod,     Till the calmly smiling god     Leaves us, and our spirits grow     More thin, more acrid, as we go.     Creeping by the sullen wall,     We forego the power to see,     The threads that bind us to the All,     God or the Immensity;     Whereof on the eternal road     Man is but a passing mode.      Too blind we are, too little see     Of the magic pageantry,     Every minute, every hour,     From the cloudflake to the flower,     Forever old, forever strange,     Issuing in perpetual change     From the rainbow gates of Time.      But he who through this common air     Surely knows the great and fair,     What is lovely, what sublime,     Becomes in an increasing span,     One with earth and one with man,     One, despite these mortal scars,     With the planets and the stars;     And Nature from her holy place,     Bending with unveil√®d face,     Fills him in her divine employ     With her own majestic joy.      Up the fielded slopes at morn,     Where light wefts of shadow pass,     Films upon the bending corn,     I shall sweep the purple grass.     Sun-crowned heights and mossy woods,     And the outer solitudes,     Mountain-valleys, dim with pine,     Shall be home and haunt of mine.     I shall search in crannied hollows,     Where the sunlight scarcely follows,     And the secret forest brook     Murmurs, and from nook to nook     Forever downward curls and cools,     Frothing in the bouldered pools.      Many a noon shall find me laid     In the pungent balsam shade,     Where sharp breezes spring and shiver     On some deep rough-coasted river,     And the plangent waters come,     Amber-hued and streaked with foam;     Where beneath the sunburnt hills     All day long the crowded mills     With remorseless champ and scream     Overlord the sluicing stream,     And the rapids' iron roar     Hammers at the forest's core;     Where corded rafts creep slowly on,     Glittering in the noonday sun,     And the tawny river-dogs,     Shepherding the branded logs,     Bind and heave with cadenced cry;     Where the blackened tugs go by,     Panting hard and straining slow,     Laboring at the weighty tow,     Flat-nosed barges all in trim,     Creeping in long cumbrous line,     Loaded to the water's brim     With the clean, cool-scented pine.      Perhaps in some low meadow-land,     Stretching wide on either hand,     I shall see the belted bees     Rocking with the tricksy breeze     In the spir√®d meadow-sweet,     Or with eager trampling feet     Burrowing in the boneset blooms,     Treading out the dry perfumes.     Where sun-hot hay-fields newly mown     Climb the hillside ruddy brown,     I shall see the haymakers,     While the noonday scarcely stirs,     Brown of neck and booted gray,     Tossing up the rustling hay,     While the hay-racks bend and rock,     As they take each scented cock,     Jolting over dip and rise;     And the wavering butterflies     O'er the spaces brown and bare     Light and wander here and there.      I shall stray by many a stream,     Where the half-shut lilies gleam.     Napping out the sultry days     In the quiet secluded bays;     Where the tasseled rushes tower,     O'er the purple pickerel-flower.     And the floating dragon-fly--     Azure glint and crystal gleam--     Watches o'er the burnished stream     With his eye of ebony;     Where the bull-frog lolls at rest     On his float of lily-leaves,     That the swaying water weaves,     And distends his yellow breast,     Lowing out from shore to shore     With a hollow vibrant roar;     Where the softest wind that blows     As it lightly comes and goes,     O'er the jungled river meads,     Stirs a whisper in the reeds,     And wakes the crowded bull-rushes     From their stately reveries,     Flashing through their long-leaved hordes     Like a brandishing of swords;     There, too, the frost-like arrow-flowers     Tremble to the golden core,   "]]]
