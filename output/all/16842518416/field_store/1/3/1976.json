The trail being wider here Bad Pete whirled by them with a swift drumming of his pony's hoofs.  In a few moments more he was out of sight.  \"Tom, you may have your doubts about that fellow,\" Hazelton remarked, \"but there's one thing he can do---ride!\"  \"Humph!  Anyone can ride that knows enough to get into a saddle and stick there,\" observed the Colorado boy dryly.  Readers of the \"_Grammar School Boys Series_\" and of the \"_High School Boys Series_\", have already recognized in Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton two famous schoolboy athletes.  Back in old Gridley there had once been a schoolboy crowd of six, known as Dick & Co.  Under the leadership of Dick Prescott, these boys had made their start in athletics in the Central Grammar School, winning no small amount of fame as junior schoolboy athletes.  Then in their High School days Dick & Co. had gradually made themselves crack athletes.  Baseball and football were their especial sports, and in these they had reached a degree of skill that had made many a college trainer anxious to obtain them.  None of the six, however, had gone to college.  Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes had secured appointments as cadets at the United States Military Academy, at West Point.  Their adventures are told in the \"_West Point Series_.\"  Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell, feeling the call to the Navy, had entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.  Their further doings are all described in the \"_Annapolis Series_.\"  Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, however, had found that their aspirations pointed to the great constructive work that is done by the big-minded, resourceful American civil engineer of today.  Bridge building, railroad building, the tunneling of mines---in a word, the building of any of the great works of industry possessed a huge fascination for them.  Tom was good-natured and practical, Harry at times full of mischief and at others dreamy, but both longed with all their souls to place themselves some day in the front ranks among civil engineers.  At high school they had given especial study to mathematics. At home they had studied engineering, through correspondence courses and otherwise.  During more than the last year of their home life our two boys had worked much in the offices of a local civil engineer, and had spent part of their school vacations afield with him.  Finally, after graduating from school both boys had gone to New York in order to look the world over.  By dint of sheer push, three-quarters of which Tom had supplied, the boys had secured their first chance in the New York offices of the S.B. & L.  Not much of a chance, to be sure, but it meant forty dollars a month and board in the field, with the added promise that, if they turned out to be \"no good,\" they would be promptly \"bounced.\"  \"If 'bounced' we are,\" Tom remarked dryly, \"we'll have to walk home, for our money will just barely take us to Colorado.\"  So here they were, having come by rail to a town some distance west of Pueblo.  From the last railway station they had been obliged to make thirty miles or more by wagon to the mountain field camp of the S.B. & L.  Since daybreak they had been on the way, eating breakfast and lunch from the paper parcels that they had brought with them.  \"How much farther is the camp, now that you know the way.\"  Reade inquired an hour after Bad Pete had vanished on horseback.  \"There it is, right down there,\" answered the Colorado youth, pointing with his whip as the raw-boned team hauled the wagon to the top of a rise in the trail.  Of the trail to the left, surrounded by natural walls of rock, was an irregularly shaped field about three or four acres in extent. Here and there wisps of grass grew, but the ground, for the most part, was covered by splinters of rock or of sand ground from the same.  At the farther end of the camp stood a small wooden building, with three tents near try.  At a greater distance were several other tents.  Three wagons stood at one side of the camp, though horses or mules for the same were not visible.  Outside, near the door of one tent, stood a transit partially concealed by the enveloping rubber cover.  Near another tent stood a plane table, used in field platting (drawing).  Signs of life about the camp there were none, save for the presence of the newcomers.  \"I wonder if there's anyone at home keeping house,\" mused Tom Reade, as he jumped down from the wagon.  \"There's only one wooden house in this town.  That must be where the boss lives,\" declared Harry.  \"Yes; that's where the boss lives,\" replied the Colorado youth, with a wry smile.  \"Let's go over and see whether he has time to talk to us,\" suggested Reade.  \"Just one minute, gentlemen,\" interposed the driver.  \"Where do you want your kit boxes placed?  Are you going to pay me now?\"  \"Drop the kit boxes on the ground anywhere,\" Tom answered.  \"We're strong enough to carry 'em when we find where they belong.\"  And---yes: we are going to pay you now.  Eighteen dollars, isn't it?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the young driver, with the brevity of the mountaineer.  Tom and Harry went into their pockets, each producing nine dollars as his share of the fare.  This was handed over to the Colorado youth.  \"'Bliged to you, gentlemen,\" nodded the Colorado boy pocketing the money.  \"Anything more to say to me?\"  \"Nothing remains to be said, except to thank you, and to wish you good luck on your way back,\" said Reade.  \"I wish you luck here, too, gentlemen.  Good day.\"  With that, the driver mounted his seat, turned the horses about and was off without once looking back.  \"Now let's go over to the house and see the boss,\" murmured Tom.  Together the chums skirted the camp, going up to the wooden building. As the door was open, Tom, with a sense of good manners, approached from the side that he might not appear to be peeping in on the occupants of the building.  Gaining the side of the doorway, with Harry just behind him, Reade knocked softly.  \"Quit yer kidding, whoever it is, and come in,\" called a rough voice.  Tom thereupon stepped inside.  What he saw filled him with surprise. Around the room were three or four tables.  There were many utensils hanging on the walls.  There were two stoves, with a man bending over one of them and stirring something in a pot.  \"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" said Tom.  \"I thought I'd find Mr. Timothy Thurston, the chief engineer, here.\"  \"Nope,\" replied a stout, red-faced man of forty, in flannel shirt and khaki trousers.  \"Mr. Thurston never eats between meals, and when he does eat he's served in his own mess tent.  Whatcher want here, pardner?\"  \"We're under orders to report to him,\" Tom answered politely.  \"New men in the chain gang?\" asked the cook, swinging around to look at the newcomers.  \"Maybe,\" Reade assented.  \"That will depend on the opinion that Mr. Thurston forms of us after he knows us a little while.  I believe the man in New York said we were to be assistant engineers.\"  \"There's only one assistant engineer here,\" announced the cook. \"The other engineers are Just plain surveyors or levelers.\"  \"Well, we won't quarrel about titles,\" Tom smilingly assured the cook.  \"Will you please tell us where Mr. Thurston is?\"  \"He's in his tent over yonder,\" said the cook, pointing through the open doorway.  \"Shall we step over there and announce ourselves?\" Tom inquired.  \"Why, ye could do it,\" rejoined the red-faced cook, with a grin. \"If Tim Thurston happens to be very busy he might use plain talk and tell you to git out of camp.\"  \"Then do you mind telling us just how we should approach the chief engineer?\"  \"Whatter yer names?\"  \"Reade and Hazelton.\"  \"Bob, trot over and tell Thurston there's two fellows here, named Reade and Hazelnut.  Ask him what he wants done with 'em.\"  The cook's helper, who, so far, had not favored the new arrivals with a glance, now turned and looked them over.  Then, with a nod, the helper stepped across the ground to the largest tent in camp.  In a few moments he came back.  \"Mr. Thurston says to stay around and he'll call you jest as soon as he's through with what he's doing,\" announced Bob, who, dark, thin and anemic, was a decrepit-looking man of fifty years or thereabouts.  \"Ye can stand about in the open,\" added the cook, pointing with his ladle.  \"There's better air out there.\"  \"Thank you,\" answered Tom briskly, but politely.  Once outside, and strolling slowly along, Reade confided to his chum:  \"Harry, you can see what big fellows we two youngsters are going to be in a Rocky Mountain railroad camp.  We haven't a blessed thing to do but play marbles until the chief can see us.\"  \"I can spare the time, if the chief can,\" laughed Harry.  \"Hello---look who's here!\"  Bad Pete, now on foot, had turned into the camp from the farther side.  Espying the boys he swaggered over toward them.  \"How do you do, sir?\" nodded Tom.  \"Can't you two tenderfeet mind your own business?\" snarled Pete, halting and scowling angrily at them.  \"Now, I come to think of it,\" admitted Tom, \"it _was_ meddlesome on my part to ask after your health.  I beg your pardon.\"  \"Say, are you two tenderfeet trying to git fresh with me?\" demanded Bad Pete, drawing himself up to his full height and gazing at them out of flashing eyes.  Almost unconsciously Tom Reade drew himself up, showing hints of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12734"],["title","The Young Engineers in Colorado; Or, At Railroad Building in Earnest (#2)"],["body","figure through the folds of his clothing.  \"No, Peter,\" he said quietly.  \"In the first place, my friend hasn't even opened his mouth.  As for myself, when I _do_ try to get fresh with you, you won't have to do any guessing.  You'll be sure of it.\"  Bad Pete took a step forward, dropping his right hand, as though unconsciously, to the butt of the revolver in the holster.  He fixed his burning gaze savagely on the boy's face as he muttered, in a low, ugly voice:  \"Tenderfoot, when I'm around after this you shut your mouth and keep it shut!  You needn't take the trouble to call me Peter again, either.  My name is Bad Pete, and I am bad.  I'm poison!  Understand? Poison!\"  \"Poison?\" repeated Tom dryly, coolly.  \"No; I don't believe I'd call you that.  I think I'd call you a bluff---and let it go at that.\"  Bad Pete scowled angrily.  Again his hand slid to the butt of his revolver, then with a muttered imprecation he turned and stalked away, calling back threateningly over his shoulder:  \"Remember, tenderfoot.  Keep out of my way.\"  Behind the boys, halted a man who had just stepped into the camp over the natural stone wall.  This man was a sun-browned, smooth-faced, pleasant-featured man of perhaps thirty-two or thirty-three years. Dressed in khaki trousers, with blue flannel shirt, sombrero and well-worn puttee leggings, he might have been mistaken for a soldier.  Though his eyes were pleasant to look at, there was an expression of great shrewdness in them.  The lines around his mouth bespoke the man's firmness.  He was about five-feet-eight in height, slim and had the general bearing of a strong man accustomed to hard work.  \"Boys,\" he began in a low voice, whereat both Tom and Harry faced swiftly about, \"you shouldn't rile Bad Pete that way.  He's an ugly character, who carries all he knows of law in his holsters, and we're a long way from the sheriff's officers.\"  \"Is he really bad?\" asked Tom innocently.  \"Really bad?\" laughed the man in khaki.  \"You'll find out if you try to cross him.  Are you visiting the camp?\"  \"Reade!  Hazelton!\" called a voice brusquely from the big tent.  \"That's Mr. Thurston calling us, I guess,\" said Tom quickly. \"We'll have to excuse ourselves and go and report to him.\"  \"Yes, that was Thurston,\" nodded the slim man.  \"And I'm Blaisdell, the assistant engineer.  I'll go along with you.\"  Throwing aside the canvas flap, Mr. Blaisdell led the boys inside the big tent.  At one end a portion of the tent was curtained off, and this was presumably the chief engineer's bedroom.  Near the centre of the tent was a flat table about six by ten feet. Just at present it held many drawings, all arranged in orderly piles.  Not far from the big table was a smaller one on which a typewriting machine rested.  The man who sat at the large table, and who wheeled about in a revolving chair as Tom and Harry entered, was perhaps forty-five years of age.  His head was covered with a mass of bushy black hair.  His face was as swarthy, in its clean-shaven condition, as though the owner had spent all of his life under a hot sun. His clothing like that of all the rest of the engineers in camp was of khaki, his shirt of blue flannel, with a long, flowing black tie.  \"Mr. Thurston,\" announced the assistant engineer, \"I have just encountered these young gentlemen, who state that they are under orders from the New York offices to report to you for employment.\"  Mr. Thurston looked both boys over in silence for a few seconds. His keen eyes appeared to take in everything that could possibly concern them.  Then he rose, extending his hand, first to Reade, next to Hazelton.  \"From what technical school do you come?\" inquired the engineer as he resumed his chair.  \"From none, sir,\" Tom answered promptly \"We didn't have money enough for that sort of training.\"  Mr. Thurston raised his eyebrows in astonished inquiry.  \"Then why,\" he asked, \"did you come here?  What made you think that you could break in as engineers?\"     CHAPTER II  BAD PETE BECOMES WORSE   Timothy Thurston's gaze was curious, and his voice a trifle cold. Yet he did not by any means treat the boys with contempt.  He appeared simply to wonder why these young men had traveled so far to take up his time.  \"We couldn't afford to take a college course in engineering, sir,\" Tom Reade continued, reddening slightly.  \"We have learned all that we possibly could in other ways, however.\"  \"Do you expect me, young men, to detail an experienced engineer to move about with you as instructor until you learn enough to be of use to us?\"  \"No, indeed, we don't, sir,\" Tom replied, and perhaps his voice was sharper than usual, though it rang with earnestness.  \"We believe, sir, that we are very fair engineers.  We are willing to be tried out, sir, and to be rated exactly where you find that we belong.  If necessary we'll start in as helpers to the chainmen, and we have pride enough to walk back over the trail at any moment when you decide that we're no good.  We have traveled all the way from the east, and I trust, sir, that you'll give us a fair chance to show if we know anything.\"  \"It won't take long to find that out,\" replied Mr. Thurston gravely. \"Of course you both understand that we are doing real engineering work and haven't any time to instruct amateurs or be patient with them.\"  \"We don't want instruction, Mr. Thurston,\" Hazelton broke in. \"We want work, and when we get it we'll do it.\"  \"I hope your work will be as good as your assurance,\" replied the chief engineer, with a slight twinkle in his eyes.  \"What can you do?\"  \"We know how to do ordinary surveying, sir,\" Tom replied quickly. \"We can run our courses and supervise the chaining.  We know how to bring in field notes that are of some use.  We can do our work well within the limits of error allowed by the United States Government.  We also consider ourselves competent at leveling. Give us the profile plan and the notes on an excavation, and we can superintend the laborers who have to make an excavation. We have a fair knowledge of ordinary road building.  We have the strength of usual materials at our finger's ends, and for beginners I think we may claim that we are very well up in mathematics. We have had some all-around experience.  Here is a letter, sir, from Price & Conley, of Gridley, in whose offices we have done quite a bit of work.\"  Mr. Thurston took the letter courteously, though he did not \\ immediately glance at it.  \"Country surveyors, these gentlemen, I suppose?\" he asked, looking into Tom's eyes.  \"Yes, sir,\" nodded Reade, \"though Mr. Price is also the engineer for our home county.  Both Mr. Price and Mr. Conley paid us the compliment of saying that we were well fitted to work in a railway engineering camp.\"  \"Well, we'll try you out, until you either make good or convince us that you can't,\" agreed the chief engineer, without any show of enthusiasm.  \"You may show them where they are to live, Mr. Blaisdell, and where they are to mess.  In the morning you can put these young men at some job or other.\"  The words sounded like a dismissal, but Blaisdell lingered a moment.  \"Mr. Thurston,\" he smiled, \"our young men ran, first thing, into Bad Pete.\"  \"Yes?\" inquired the chief.  \"Did Pete show these young men his fighting front?\"  Blaisdell repeated the dialogue that had taken place between Tom and Bad Pete.  The chief listened to his assistant in silence.  Tom flushed slightly under the penetrating glance Mr. Thurston cast upon him during the recital.  When the assistant had finished, the chief merely remarked: \"Blaisdell, I wish you could get rid of that fellow, Bad Pete.  I don't like to have him hanging about the camp.  He's an undesirable character, and I'm afraid that some of our men will have trouble with him. Can't you get rid of him?\"  \"I'll do it if you say so, Mr. Thurston,\" Blaisdell answered quietly.  \"How?\" inquired his chief.  \"I'll serve out firearms to five or six of the men, and the next time Pete shows his face we'll cover him and march him miles away from camp.\"  \"That wouldn't do any good,\" replied Mr. Thurston, with a shake of his head.  \"Pete would only come back, uglier than before, and he'd certainly shoot up some of our men.\"  \"You asked me, a moment ago, Mr. Thurston, what I could do,\" Tom broke in.  \"Give me a little time, and I'll agree to rid the camp of Peter.\"  \"How?\" asked the chief abruptly.  \"Not with any gun-play!  Pete would be too quick for you at anything of that sort.\"  \"I don't carry a pistol, and don't wish to do so,\" Tom retorted. \"In my opinion only a coward carries a pistol.\"  \"Then you think Bad Pete is a coward, young man?\" returned the chief.  \"If driven into a corner I'm pretty sure he'd turn out to be one, sir,\" Tom went on earnestly.  \"A coward is a man who's afraid. If a fellow isn't afraid of anything, then why does he have to carry firearms to protect himself?\"  \"I don't believe that would quite apply to Pete,\" Mr. Thurston went on.  \"Pete doesn't carry a revolver because he's afraid of anything.  He knows that many other men are afraid of pistols, and so he carries his firearms about in order that he may enjoy himself in playing bully.\"  \"I can drive him out of camp,\" Tom insisted.  \"All I'll wait for will be your permission to go ahead.\"  \"If you can do it without shooting,\" replied the chief, \"try your hand at it.  Be careful, however, Reade.  There are plenty of good natural lead mines in these mountains.\"  \"Yes---sir?\" asked Reade, looking puzzled.  \"Much as we'd like to see Pete permanently out of this camp, remember that we don't want you to give the fellow any excuse for turning you into a lead mine.\"  \"If Peter tries anything like that with me,\" retorted Tom solemnly, \"I shall be deeply offended.\"  \"Very good.  Take the young men along with you, Blaisdell.  I'll hear your report on them tomorrow night.\"  The assistant engineer took Tom and Harry over to a seven by nine tent.  \"You'll bunk in here,\" he explained, \"and store your"]]]
