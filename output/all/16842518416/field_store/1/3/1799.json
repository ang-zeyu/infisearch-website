If this is a vice, then we wish no virtue.        Yet our brothers are not like us. All is not well with our       brothers. There are Fraternity 2-5503, a quiet boy with wise,       kind eyes, who cry suddenly, without reason, in the midst of day       or night, and their body shakes with sobs they cannot explain.       There are Solidarity 9-6347, who are a bright youth, without fear       in the day; but they scream in their sleep, and they scream:       “Help us! Help us! Help us!” into the night, in a voice which       chills our bones, but the Doctors cannot cure Solidarity 9-6347.        And as we all undress at night, in the dim light of the candles,       our brothers are silent, for they dare not speak the thoughts of       their minds. For all must agree with all, and they cannot know if       their thoughts are the thoughts of all, and so they fear to       speak. And they are glad when the candles are blown for the       night. But we, Equality 7-2521, look through the window upon the       sky, and there is peace in the sky, and cleanliness, and dignity.       And beyond the City there lies the plain, and beyond the plain,       black upon the black sky, there lies the Uncharted Forest.        We do not wish to look upon the Uncharted Forest. We do not wish       to think of it. But ever do our eyes return to that black patch       upon the sky. Men never enter the Uncharted Forest, for there is       no power to explore it and no path to lead among its ancient       trees which stand as guards of fearful secrets. It is whispered       that once or twice in a hundred years, one among the men of the       City escape alone and run to the Uncharted Forest, without call       or reason. These men do not return. They perish from hunger and       from the claws of the wild beasts which roam the Forest. But our       Councils say that this is only a legend. We have heard that there       are many Uncharted Forests over the land, among the Cities. And       it is whispered that they have grown over the ruins of many       cities of the Unmentionable Times. The trees have swallowed the       ruins, and the bones under the ruins, and all the things which       perished. And as we look upon the Uncharted Forest far in the       night, we think of the secrets of the Unmentionable Times. And we       wonder how it came to pass that these secrets were lost to the       world. We have heard the legends of the great fighting, in which       many men fought on one side and only a few on the other. These       few were the Evil Ones and they were conquered. Then great fires       raged over the land. And in these fires the Evil Ones and all the       things made by the Evil Ones were burned. And the fire which is       called the Dawn of the Great Rebirth, was the Script Fire where       all the scripts of the Evil Ones were burned, and with them all       the words of the Evil Ones. Great mountains of flame stood in the       squares of the Cities for three months. Then came the Great       Rebirth.        The words of the Evil Ones... The words of the Unmentionable       Times... What are the words which we have lost?        May the Council have mercy upon us! We had no wish to write such       a question, and we knew not what we were doing till we had       written it. We shall not ask this question and we shall not think       it. We shall not call death upon our head.        And yet... And yet... There is some word, one single word which       is not in the language of men, but which had been. And this is       the Unspeakable Word, which no men may speak nor hear. But       sometimes, and it is rare, sometimes, somewhere, one among men       find that word. They find it upon scraps of old manuscripts or       cut into the fragments of ancient stones. But when they speak it       they are put to death. There is no crime punished by death in       this world, save this one crime of speaking the Unspeakable Word.        We have seen one of such men burned alive in the square of the       City. And it was a sight which has stayed with us through the       years, and it haunts us, and follows us, and it gives us no rest.       We were a child then, ten years old. And we stood in the great       square with all the children and all the men of the City, sent to       behold the burning. They brought the Transgressor out into the       square and they led them to the pyre. They had torn out the       tongue of the Transgressor, so that they could speak no longer.       The Transgressor were young and tall. They had hair of gold and       eyes blue as morning. They walked to the pyre, and their step did       not falter. And of all the faces on that square, of all the faces       which shrieked and screamed and spat curses upon them, theirs was       the calmest and the happiest face.        As the chains were wound over their body at the stake, and a       flame set to the pyre, the Transgressor looked upon the City.       There was a thin thread of blood running from the corner of their       mouth, but their lips were smiling. And a monstrous thought came       to us then, which has never left us. We had heard of Saints.       There are the Saints of Labor, and the Saints of the Councils,       and the Saints of the Great Rebirth. But we had never seen a       Saint nor what the likeness of a Saint should be. And we thought       then, standing in the square, that the likeness of a Saint was       the face we saw before us in the flames, the face of the       Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word.        As the flames rose, a thing happened which no eyes saw but ours,       else we would not be living today. Perhaps it had only seemed to       us. But it seemed to us that the eyes of the Transgressor had       chosen us from the crowd and were looking straight upon us. There       was no pain in their eyes and no knowledge of the agony of their       body. There was only joy in them, and pride, a pride holier than       is fit for human pride to be. And it seemed as if these eyes were       trying to tell us something through the flames, to send into our       eyes some word without sound. And it seemed as if these eyes were       begging us to gather that word and not to let it go from us and       from the earth. But the flames rose and we could not guess the       word....        What—even if we have to burn for it like the Saint of the       Pyre—what is the Unspeakable Word?          PART THREE        We, Equality 7-2521, have discovered a new power of nature. And       we have discovered it alone, and we alone are to know it.        It is said. Now let us be lashed for it, if we must. The Council       of Scholars has said that we all know the things which exist and       therefore the things which are not known by all do not exist. But       we think that the Council of Scholars is blind. The secrets of       this earth are not for all men to see, but only for those who       will seek them. We know, for we have found a secret unknown to       all our brothers.        We know not what this power is nor whence it comes. But we know       its nature, we have watched it and worked with it. We saw it       first two years ago. One night, we were cutting open the body of       a dead frog when we saw its leg jerking. It was dead, yet it       moved. Some power unknown to men was making it move. We could not       understand it. Then, after many tests, we found the answer. The       frog had been hanging on a wire of copper; and it had been the       metal of our knife which had sent the strange power to the copper       through the brine of the frog’s body. We put a piece of copper       and a piece of zinc into a jar of brine, we touched a wire to       them, and there, under our fingers, was a miracle which had never       occurred before, a new miracle and a new power.        This discovery haunted us. We followed it in preference to all       our studies. We worked with it, we tested it in more ways than we       can describe, and each step was as another miracle unveiling       before us. We came to know that we had found the greatest power       on earth. For it defies all the laws known to men. It makes the       needle move and turn on the compass which we stole from the Home       of the Scholars; but we had been taught, when still a child, that       the loadstone points to the north and that this is a law which       nothing can change; yet our new power defies all laws. We found       that it causes lightning, and never have men known what causes       lightning. In thunderstorms, we raised a tall rod of iron by the       side of our hole, and we watched it from below. We have seen the       lightning strike it again and again. And now we know that metal       draws the power of the sky, and that metal can be made to give it       forth.        We have built strange things with this discovery of ours. We used       for it the copper wires which we found here under the ground. We       have walked the length of our tunnel, with a candle lighting the       way. We could go no farther than half a mile, for earth and rock       had fallen at both ends. But we gathered all the things we found       and we brought them to our work place. We found strange boxes       with bars of metal inside, with many cords and strands and coils       of metal. We found wires that led to strange little globes of       glass on the walls; they contained threads of metal thinner than       a spider’s web.        These things help us in our work. We do not understand them, but       we think that the men of the Unmentionable Times had known our       power of the sky, and these things had some relation to it. We do       not know, but we shall learn. We cannot stop now, even though it       frightens us that we are alone in our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1250"],["title","Anthem (#5)"],["body","wledge.        No single one can possess greater wisdom than the many Scholars       who are elected by all men for their wisdom. Yet we can. We do.       We have fought against saying it, but now it is said. We do not       care. We forget all men, all laws and all things save our metals       and our wires. So much is still to be learned! So long a road       lies before us, and what care we if we must travel it alone!          PART FOUR        Many days passed before we could speak to the Golden One again.       But then came the day when the sky turned white, as if the sun       had burst and spread its flame in the air, and the fields lay       still without breath, and the dust of the road was white in the       glow. So the women of the field were weary, and they tarried over       their work, and they were far from the road when we came. But the       Golden One stood alone at the hedge, waiting. We stopped and we       saw that their eyes, so hard and scornful to the world, were       looking at us as if they would obey any word we might speak.        And we said:        “We have given you a name in our thoughts, Liberty 5-3000.”        “What is our name?” they asked.        “The Golden One.”        “Nor do we call you Equality 7-2521 when we think of you.”        “What name have you given us?” They looked straight into our eyes       and they held their head high and they answered:        “The Unconquered.”        For a long time we could not speak. Then we said:        “Such thoughts as these are forbidden, Golden One.”        “But you think such thoughts as these and you wish us to think       them.”        We looked into their eyes and we could not lie.        “Yes,” we whispered, and they smiled, and then we said: “Our       dearest one, do not obey us.”        They stepped back, and their eyes were wide and still.        “Speak these words again,” they whispered.        “Which words?” we asked. But they did not answer, and we knew it.        “Our dearest one,” we whispered.        Never have men said this to women.        The head of the Golden One bowed slowly, and they stood still       before us, their arms at their sides, the palms of their hands       turned to us, as if their body were delivered in submission to       our eyes. And we could not speak.        Then they raised their head, and they spoke simply and gently, as       if they wished us to forget some anxiety of their own.        “The day is hot,” they said, “and you have worked for many hours       and you must be weary.”        “No,” we answered.        “It is cooler in the fields,” they said, “and there is water to       drink. Are you thirsty?”        “Yes,” we answered, “but we cannot cross the hedge.”        “We shall bring the water to you,” they said.        Then they knelt by the moat, they gathered water in their two       hands, they rose and they held the water out to our lips.        We do not know if we drank that water. We only knew suddenly that       their hands were empty, but we were still holding our lips to       their hands, and that they knew it, but did not move.        We raised our head and stepped back. For we did not understand       what had made us do this, and we were afraid to understand it.        And the Golden One stepped back, and stood looking upon their       hands in wonder. Then the Golden One moved away, even though no       others were coming, and they moved, stepping back, as if they       could not turn from us, their arms bent before them, as if they       could not lower their hands.          PART FIVE        We made it. We created it. We brought it forth from the night of       the ages. We alone. Our hands. Our mind. Ours alone and only.        We know not what we are saying. Our head is reeling. We look upon       the light which we have made. We shall be forgiven for anything       we say tonight....        Tonight, after more days and trials than we can count, we       finished building a strange thing, from the remains of the       Unmentionable Times, a box of glass, devised to give forth the       power of the sky of greater strength than we had ever achieved       before. And when we put our wires to this box, when we closed the       current—the wire glowed! It came to life, it turned red, and a       circle of light lay on the stone before us.        We stood, and we held our head in our hands. We could not       conceive of that which we had created. We had touched no flint,       made no fire. Yet here was light, light that came from nowhere,       light from the heart of metal.        We blew out the candle. Darkness swallowed us. There was nothing       left around us, nothing save night and a thin thread of flame in       it, as a crack in the wall of a prison. We stretched our hands to       the wire, and we saw our fingers in the red glow. We could not       see our body nor feel it, and in that moment nothing existed save       our two hands over a wire glowing in a black abyss.        Then we thought of the meaning of that which lay before us. We       can light our tunnel, and the City, and all the Cities of the       world with nothing save metal and wires. We can give our brothers       a new light, cleaner and brighter than any they have ever known.       The power of the sky can be made to do men’s bidding. There are       no limits to its secrets and its might, and it can be made to       grant us anything if we but choose to ask.        Then we knew what we must do. Our discovery is too great for us       to waste our time in sweeping the streets. We must not keep our       secret to ourselves, nor buried under the ground. We must bring       it into the sight of all men. We need all our time, we need the       work rooms of the Home of the Scholars, we want the help of our       brother Scholars and their wisdom joined to ours. There is so       much work ahead for all of us, for all the Scholars of the world.        In a month, the World Council of Scholars is to meet in our City.       It is a great Council, to which the wisest of all lands are       elected, and it meets once a year in the different Cities of the       earth. We shall go to this Council and we shall lay before them,       as our gift, this glass box with the power of the sky. We shall       confess everything to them. They will see, understand and       forgive. For our gift is greater than our transgression. They       will explain it to the Council of Vocations, and we shall be       assigned to the Home of the Scholars. This has never been done       before, but neither has a gift such as ours ever been offered to       men.        We must wait. We must guard our tunnel as we had never guarded it       before. For should any men save the Scholars learn of our secret,       they would not understand it, nor would they believe us. They       would see nothing, save our crime of working alone, and they       would destroy us and our light. We care not about our body, but       our light is...        Yes, we do care. For the first time do we care about our body.       For this wire is as a part of our body, as a vein torn from us,       glowing with our blood. Are we proud of this thread of metal, or       of our hands which made it, or is there a line to divide these       two?        We stretch out our arms. For the first time do we know how strong       our arms are. And a strange thought comes to us: we wonder, for       the first time in our life, what we look like. Men never see       their own faces and never ask their brothers about it, for it is       evil to have concern for their own faces or bodies. But tonight,       for a reason we cannot fathom, we wish it were possible to us to       know the likeness of our own person.          PART SIX        We have not written for thirty days. For thirty days we have not       been here, in our tunnel. We had been caught. It happened on that       night when we wrote last. We forgot, that night, to watch the       sand in the glass which tells us when three hours have passed and       it is time to return to the City Theatre. When we remembered it,       the sand had run out.        We hastened to the Theatre. But the big tent stood grey and       silent against the sky. The streets of the City lay before us,       dark and empty. If we went back to hide in our tunnel, we would       be found and our light found with us. So we walked to the Home of       the Street Sweepers.        When the Council of the Home questioned us, we looked upon the       faces of the Council, but there was no curiosity in those faces,       and no anger, and no mercy. So when the oldest of them asked us:       “Where have you been?” we thought of our glass box and of our       light, and we forgot all else. And we answered:        “We will not tell you.”        The oldest did not question us further. They turned to the two       youngest, and said, and their voice was bored:        “Take our brother Equality 7-2521 to the Palace of Corrective       Detention. Lash them until they tell.”        So we were taken to the Stone Room under the Palace of Corrective       Detention. This room has no windows and it is empty save for an       iron post. Two men stood by the post, naked but for leather       aprons and leather hoods over their faces. Those who had brought       us departed, leaving us to the two Judges who stood in a corner       of the room. The Judges were small, thin men, grey and bent. They       gave the signal to the two strong hooded ones.        They tore the clothes from our body, they threw us down upon our       knees and they tied our hands to the iron post. The first blow of       the lash felt as if our spine had been cut in two. The second       blow stopped the first, and for a second we felt nothing, then       the pain struck us in our throat and fire ran in our lungs       without air. But we did not cry out.        The lash"]]]
