But isn't it a splendid imitation?\"  Virginia, pleased to have caught them so cleverly, showed them the ends of twenty-four pieces of narrow ribbon, peeping from under the delicately brown top crust. \"The white ones are for the girls, and the red ones for the boys,\" she explained. \"There is a valentine on the end of each one, and those on the red ribbons match the ones on the white. We'll all pull at once, and the ones who have valentines alike will go out to dinner together.\"  The guests came promptly. They had been invited for half-past six, and dinner was to be served soon after that time. The last to arrive was the Little Colonel. She came in charge of an old coloured woman, Mom Beck, who had been her mother's nurse as well as her own. The child was so hidden in her wraps when Mom Beck led her up-stairs, that no one could tell how she looked. The boys had been curious to see her, ever since they had heard so many tales of her mischievous pranks. A few minutes later, when she appeared in the parlours, there was a buzz of admiration. Maybe it was not so much for the soft light hair, the star-like beauty of her big dark eyes, or the delicate colour in her cheeks that made them as pink as a wild rose, as it was for the valentine costume she wore. It was of dainty white tulle, sprinkled with hundreds of tiny red velvet hearts, and there was a coronet of glittering rhinestones on her long fair hair.  \"The Queen of Hearts,\" announced Aunt Allison, leading her forward. \"You know 'she made some tarts, upon a summer day,' and now she shall open the valentine pie and see if it is as good as her Majesty's.\"  The big music-box in the hall began playing one of its liveliest waltzes, the children gathered around the great pie, and twenty-four little hands reached out to grasp the floating ends of ribbon.  \"Pull!\" cried the little Queen of Hearts. The paper crust flew off, and twenty-four yards of ribbon, each with a valentine attached, fluttered brightly through the air for an instant.  \"Now match your verses,\" cried her Majesty again, opening her own to read what was in it. There was much laughing and peeping over shoulders, and tangling of white and scarlet ribbons, while the gay music-box played on.  In the midst of it Virginia beckoned to the Little Colonel. \"Come up-stairs with me for a minute, Lloyd,\" she whispered, \"and help me look for something. Aunt Allison has forgotten where she put the box of arrows that we are to use in the archery contest after dinner. There is the prettiest prize for the one who hits the red heart in the centre of the target.\"  \"Oh, do you suppose you can hit it?\" asked Lloyd, as she and Virginia slipped their arms around each other, and went skipping up the stairs.  \"Yes, indeed!\" answered Virginia. \"I used to practise so much with my Indian bow and arrow out at the fort, that I could hit centre nearly every time. I am not going to shoot to-night. Aunt Allison thinks it wouldn't be fair.\"  When they reached the top of the stairs, Virginia went into her room to light a wax taper in one of the tall silver candlesticks on her dressing-table. \"I think that Aunt Allison must have left those arrows in the blue room,\" she said, leading the way down the cross hall which went to the north wing. \"She made the pie in there this morning, and all the other things were there. Nobody comes over in this part of the house much in winter, unless there happens to be a great deal of company.\"  The taper that Virginia carried was the only light in that part of the house. When she reached the door of the blue room she turned to Lloyd. \"Hold the candle for me, please,\" she said, \"while I look in the closet.\"  It was a pretty picture that the little \"Queen of Hearts\" made, as she stood in the doorway, with the tall silver candlestick held high in both hands. Her hair shone like gold in the candlelight, and her glittering crown flashed as if a circle of fairy fireflies had been caught in its soft meshes. Her dark eyes peered anxiously around the big shadowy room, lighted only by her flickering taper.  Down-stairs, Malcolm and Keith were almost quarrelling about her. It began by Malcolm taking his brother aside and offering to trade valentines with him.  \"Why?\" asked Keith, suspiciously.  \"'Cause yours matches the Little Colonel's, and I want to take her out to dinner,\" admitted Malcolm. \"She is the prettiest girl here.\"  \"But I don't want to trade,\" answered Keith. \"I want to take her myself.\"  \"I'll give you the pick of any six stamps in my album if you will.\"  \"Don't want your old stamps,\" declared Keith, stoutly. \"I'd rather have the Little Colonel for my partner.\"  \"I think you might trade,\" coaxed Malcolm. \"It's mean not to when I'm the oldest. I'll give you that Chinese puzzle you've been wanting so long if you will.\" Keith shook his head.  Just then a terrific scream sounded in the upper hall, followed by another that made every one down-stairs turn pale with fright. Two voices were uttering piercing shrieks, one after another, so loud and frantic that even the servants in the back part of the house came running. Miss Allison, thinking of the candle she had told Virginia to light, and remembering the thin, white dress the child wore, instantly thought she must have set herself afire. She ran into the hall, so frightened that she was trembling from head to foot. Before she could reach the staircase, Virginia came flying down the steps, white as a little ghost, and her eyes wide with terror. Throwing herself into her aunt's outstretched arms, she began to sob out her story between great, trembling gasps.  \"Oh, there's an awful, awful wild beast in the blue room, nearly as tall as the ceiling! It rose up and came after us out of the corner, and if I hadn't slammed the door just in time, it would have eaten us up. I'm sure it would! Oo-oo-oo! It was so awful!\" she wailed.  \"Why, Virginia,\" exclaimed her aunt, distressed to see her so terrified, \"it must have been only a big shadow you saw. It isn't possible for a wild beast to be in the blue room you know. Where is Lloyd?\"  \"She's up heah, Miss Allison,\" called Mom Beck's voice. \"She's so skeered, I'se pow'ful 'fraid she gwine to faint. They sut'nly is something in that room, honey, deed they is. I kin heah it movin' around now, switchin' he's tail an' growlin'!\"  Malcolm and Keith, with guilty faces, went dashing up the stairs, and the whole party followed them at a respectful distance. When they opened the door the room looked very big and shadowy, and the bear, roused from its nap, was standing on its hind legs beside the high-posted bed. The huge figure was certainly enough to frighten any one coming upon it unexpectedly in the dark, and when Miss Allison saw it she drew Virginia's trembling hand into hers with a sympathetic clasp. Before she could ask any questions, the boys began an excited explanation. It was some time before they could make their story understood.  Their grandmother was horrified, and insisted on sending the animal away at once. \"The idea of bringing such a dangerous creature into any one's house,\" she exclaimed, \"and, above all, of shutting him up in a bedroom! We might have all been bitten, or hugged to death!\"  \"But, grandmother,\" begged Malcolm, \"he isn't dangerous. Let me bring him into the light, and show you what a kind old pet he is.\"  There was a scattering to the other end of the hall as Malcolm came out, leading the bear, but the children gradually drew nearer as the great animal began its performances. Keith whistled and kept time with his feet in a funny little shuffling jig he had learned from Jonesy, and the bear obligingly went through all his tricks. He was used to being pulled out to perform whenever a crowd could be collected.  Virginia forgot her fear of him when he stood up and presented arms like a real soldier, and even went up and patted him when the show was over, joining with the boys in begging that he might be allowed to stay in the house until morning. Mrs. Maclntyre was determined to send a man down to the cabin at once to investigate. She had a horror of tramps. But the boys begged her to wait until daylight for Jonesy's sake.  \"The man will beat him if he finds out that Jonesy warned us,\" pleaded Keith. He was so earnest that the tears stood in his big, trustful eyes.  \"This is spoiling the party, mother,\" whispered Miss Allison, \"and dinner is waiting. I'll be responsible for any harm that may be done if you will let the boys have their way this once.\"  There seemed no other way to settle it just then, so Bruin was allowed to go back to his rug in the blue room, and the door was securely locked.  Keith took Lloyd down to dinner, and his grandmother heard him apologising all the way down for having frightened her. The little Queen of Hearts listened smilingly, but her colour did not come back all evening, until after the archery contest. It was when Malcolm came up with the prize he had won, a tiny silver arrow, and pinned it in the knot of red ribbon on her shoulder.  \"Will you keep it to remember me by?\" he asked, bashfully.  \"Of co'se!\" she answered, with a smile that showed all her roguish dimples. \"I'll keep it fo'evah and evah to remembah how neah I came to bein' eaten up by yo' bea'h.\"  [Illustration: \"'WILL YOU KEEP IT TO REMEMBER ME BY?'\"]  \"It seems too bad for such a beautiful party to come to an end,\" Sally Fairfax said when the last merry game was played, the last story told, and it was time to go home. \"But there's one comfort,\" she added, gathering all her gay valentines together, \"there needn't be any end to the remembering of it. I've had _such_ a good time, Mrs. MacIntyre.\"  It was so late when the last carriage rolled down the avenue, bearing away the last smiling little guest, that the children were almost too sleepy to undress. It was not long until the last light was put out in every room, and a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12317"],["title","Two Little Knights of Kentucky (#6)"],["body","stillness settled over the entire house. One by one the lights went out in every home in the valley, and only the stars were left shining, in the cold wintry sky. No, there was one lamp that still burned. It was in the little cottage where old Professor Heinrich sat bowed over his books.    CHAPTER IV.  A FIRE AND A PLAN.  Some people said that old Johann Heinrich never slept, for no matter what hour of the night one passed his lonely little house, a lamp was always burning. He was a queer old German naturalist, living by himself in a cottage adjoining the MacIntyre place. He had been a professor in a large university until he grew too old to keep his position. Why he should have chosen Lloydsborough Valley as the place to settle for the remainder of his life, no one could tell.  He kept kimself away from his neighbours, and spent so much time roaming around the woods by himself that people called him queer. They did not know that he had written two big books about the birds and insects he loved so well, or that he could tell them facts more wonderful than fairy tales about these little wild creatures of the woodland.  To-night he had read later than usual, and his fire was nearly out. He was too poor to keep a servant, so when he found that the coal-hod was empty he had to go out to the kitchen to fill it himself. That is why he saw something that happened soon after midnight, while everybody else in the valley was sound asleep.  Over in the cabin by the spring-house where the boys had left the tramp and Jonesy, a puff of smoke went curling around the roof. Then a tongue of flame shot up through the cedars, and another and another until the sky was red with an angry glare. It lighted up the eastern window-panes of the servants' cottage, but the inmates, tired from the unusual serving of the evening before, slept on. It shone full across the window of Virginia's room, but she was dreaming of being chased by bears, and only turned uneasily in her sleep.  The old professor, on his way to the kitchen, noticed that it seemed strangely light outside. He shuffled to the door and looked out.  \"Ach Himmel!\" he exclaimed, excitedly. \"Somebody vill shust in his bed be burnt, if old Johann does not haste make!\"  Not waiting to close the door behind him, or even to catch up something to protect his old bald head from the intense cold of the winter night, he ran out across the garden. His shuffling feet, in their flapping old carpet slippers, forgot their rheumatism, and his shoulders dropped the weight of their seventy years. He ran like a boy across the meadow, through the gap in the fence, and down the hill to the cabin by the spring.  All one side of it was in flames. The fire was curling around the front door and bursting through the windows with fierce cracklings. Dashing frantically around to the back door, he threw himself against it, shouting to know if any one was within. A blinding rush of smoke was his only answer as he backed away from the overpowering heat, but something fell across the door-sill in a limp little heap. It was Jonesy.  Dragging the child to a safe distance from the burning building, he ran back, fearing that some one else might be in danger, but this time the flames met him at the door, and it was impossible to go in. His hoarse shouting roused the servants, but by the time they reached the cabin the roof had fallen in, and all danger of the fire spreading to other buildings was over.  While the professor was bending over Jonesy, trying to bring him back to consciousness, Miss Allison came running down the path. She had an eiderdown quilt wrapped around her over her dressing-gown. The shouts had awakened her, also, and she had slipped out as quietly as possible, not wishing to alarm her mother.  \"How did it happen?\" she demanded, breathlessly. \"Is the child badly burned? Is any one else hurt? Is the tramp in the cabin?\"  No one gave any answer to her rapid questions. The old professor shook his head, but did not look up. He was bending over Jonesy, trying to restore him to consciousness. He seemed to know the right things to do for him, and in a little while the child opened his eyes and looked around wonderingly. In a few minutes he was able to tell what he knew about the fire.  It was not much, only a horrible recollection of being awakened by a feeling that he was choking in the thick smoke that filled the room; of hearing the boss swear at him to be quick and follow him or he would be burned to death. Then there had been an awful moment of groping through the blinding, choking smoke, trying to find a way out. The man sprang to a window and made his escape, but as the outside air rushed in through the opening he left, it seemed to fan the smoke instantly into flame.  Jonesy had struck out at the wall of fire with his helpless little hands, and then, half-crazed by the scorching pain, dropped to the floor and crawled in the opposite direction, just as the professor burst open the door.  The sight of the poor little blistered face brought the tears to Miss Allison's eyes, and she called two of the coloured men, directing them to carry Jonesy to the house, and then go at once for a doctor. But the professor interfered, insisting that Jonesy should be taken to his house. He said that he knew how to prepare the cooling bandages that were needed, and that he would sit up all night to apply them. He could not sleep anyhow, he said, after such great excitement.  \"But I feel responsible for him,\" urged Miss Allison. \"Since it happened on our place, and my little nephews brought him here, it seems to me that we ought to have the care of him.\"  The professor waved her aside, lifting Jonesy's head as tenderly as a nurse could have done, and motioned the coloured men to lift him up.  \"No, no, fraulein,\" he said. \"I have had eggsperience. It is besser the poor leedle knabe go mit me!\"  There was no opposing the old man's masterful way. Miss Allison stepped aside for them to pass, calling after him her willingness to do the nursing he had taken upon himself, and insisting that she would come early in the morning to help.  Unc' Henry was left to guard the ruins, lest some stray spark should be blown toward the other buildings. \"Dis yere ole niggah wa'n't mistaken aftah all,\" he muttered. \"Dee was somebody prowlin' 'roun' de premises yistiddy evenin'.\" Then he searched the ground, all around the cabin, for footprints in the snow. He found some tracks presently, and followed them over the meadow in the starlight, across the road, and down the railroad track several rods. There they suddenly disappeared. The tramp had evidently walked on the rail some distance. If Unc' Henry had gone quarter of a mile farther up the track, he would have found those same sliding imprints on every other crosstie, as if the man had taken long running leaps in his haste to get away.  Jonesy stoutly denied that the man had set fire to the cabin. \"We nearly froze to death that night,\" he said, when questioned about it afterward, \"and the boss piled on an awful big lot of wood just before he went to bed.\"  \"Then what made him take to his heels so fast if he didn't?\" some one asked.  \"I don't know,\" answered Jonesy. \"He said that luck was always against him, and maybe he thought nobody would believe him if he did say that he didn't do it.\"  Several days after that Malcolm found the tramp's picture in the _Courier-Journal_. He was a noted criminal who had escaped from a Northern penitentiary some two months before, and had been arrested by the Louisville police. There was no mistaking him. That big, ugly scar branded him on cheek and forehead like another Cain.  \"And to think that that terrible man was harboured on my place!\" exclaimed Mrs. MacIntyre when she heard of it. \"And you boys were down there in the cabin with him for hours! Sat beside him and talked with him! What will your mother say? I feel as if you had been exposed to the smallpox, and I cannot be too thankful now that the boy who was with him was not brought here. He isn't a fit companion for you. Not that the poor little unfortunate is to blame. He cannot help being a child of the slums, and he must be put in an orphan asylum or a reform school at once. It is probably the only thing that can save him from growing up to be a criminal like the man who brought him here. I shall see what can be done about it, as soon as possible.\"  \"A child of the slums!\" Malcolm and Keith repeated the expression afterward, with only a vague idea of its meaning. It seemed to set poor Jonesy apart from themselves as something unclean,--something that their happy, well-filled lives must not be allowed to touch.  Maybe if Jonesy had been an attractive child, with a sensitive mouth, and big, appealing eyes, he might have found his way more easily into people's hearts. But he was a lean, snub-nosed little fellow, with a freckled face and neglected hair. No one would ever find his cheek a tempting one to kiss, and no one would be moved, by any feeling save pity, to stoop and put affectionate arms around Jonesy. He was only a common little street gamin, as unlovely as he was unloved.  \"What a blessing that there are such places as orphan asylums for children of that class,\" said Mrs. Maclntyre, after one of her visits to him. \"I must make arrangements for him to be put into one as soon as he is able to be moved.\"  \"I think he will be very loath to leave the old professor,\" answered Miss Allison. \"He has been so good to the child, amusing him by the hour with his microscopes and collections of insects, telling him those delightful old German folk-lore tales, and putting him to sleep every night to the music of his violin. What a child-lover he is, and what a delightful old man in every way! I am glad we have discovered him.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Maclntyre; \"and when this little tramp is sent away, I want the children to go there often. I asked him if he could not teach them this spring, at least"]]]
