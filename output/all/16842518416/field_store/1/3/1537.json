He stood with his hands thrust deep into his pockets and regarded the rider glumly.  \"Well, you got here,\" he grunted, with the brevity of utter misery.  \"You bet I did! I was away from the hacienda when the peon came, or I'd have got here sooner,\" Dade explained cheerfully, swinging to the ground with a jingle of his big, Mexican spurs that had little silver bells to swell the tinkly chimes when he moved. \"Where's Jack?\"  Big Bill Wilson's jaw trembled with an impulse towards tears which the long, harsh years behind him would not let him shed. \"They've got him,\" he said in a choked tone, and waved a hand toward the west.  \"Who's got him?\" Dade clanked a step closer and peered sharply into Bill's face, with all the easy good humor wiped out of his own.  \"The Committee. You're too late; they're taking him out to the oak. Been gone about ten minutes. They had it in for him, and--I couldn't do a thing! The men in this town--\" Epithets rushed incoherently from Bill's lips, just as violent weeping marks the reaction from a woman's first silence in the face of tragedy.  Dade did not hear a word he was saying, after those first jerky sentences. He stood looking past Bill at a drunken Irishman who was making erratic progress up the street; and he was no more conscious of the Irishman than he was of Bill's scorching condemnation of the town which could permit such outrages.  \"Watch Surry a minute!\" he said abruptly, and hurried into the gambling hall. In a minute he was back again and lifting foot to the stirrup.  \"How long did you say they've been gone?\" he asked, without looking at Bill.  \"Ten or fifteen minutes. Say, you can't do anything!\"  Dade was already half-way up the block, a swirl of sand-dust marking his flight. Bill stared after him distressfully.  \"He'll go and get his light put out--and he won't help Jack a damn bit,\" he told himself miserably, and went in. Life that day looked very hard to big-hearted Bill Wilson, and scarcely worth the trouble of living it.  It broke the heart of Dade Hunter to see how near the sinister procession was to the live oak that had come to be looked upon as the gallows of the Vigilance Committee; a gallows whose broad branches sheltered from rain and sun alike the unmarked graves of the men who had come there shuddering and looked upon it, and shuddering had looked no more upon anything in this world.  Until he was near enough to risk betraying his haste by the hoof-beats of his horse, Dade kept Surry at a run. Upon the crest of the slope which the procession was leisurely descending, he slowed to a lope; and so overtook the crowd that straggled always out to the hangings, came they ever so frequent. Reeling in the saddle, he came up with the stragglers, singing and marking time with a half-empty bottle of whisky.  The few who knew him looked at one another askance.  \"Say, Hunter, ain't yuh got any feelin's? That there's your pardner on the hoss,\" one loose-jointed miner expostulated.  \"Sure, I got feelin's! Have a d-drink?\" Dade leered drunkenly at the speaker. \"Jack's--no good anyway. Tol' 'im he'd get hung if he--have a d-drink?\"  The loose-jointed one would, and so would his neighbors. The Captain glanced back at them, gave a contemptuous lift to his upper lip and faced again to the front.  Dade uncoiled his riata with aimless, fumbling fingers and swung the noose facetiously toward the bottle, uptilted over the eager mouth of a weazened little Irishman. He caught bottle and hand together, let them go with a quick flip of the rawhide and waggled his head in apology.  \"_Excuse_ me, Mike,\" he mumbled, while the Irishman stopped and glared. \"Go awn! Have a drink. Mighta spilled it--shame!\"  Jack looked back, his heart thumping heavily at sound of the voice, thick though it was and maudlin. Dade drunk and full of coarse foolery was a sight he had never before looked upon; but Dade's presence, drunk or sober, made his own plight seem a shade less hopeless. He did not dare a second glance, with Davis and the Captain walking at either stirrup; but he listened anxiously--listened and caught a drunken mumble from the rear, and a chorus of chuckling laughs coming after.  He looked ahead. The great oak was close, so close that he might have counted the narrow little ridges of red soil beneath; the ridges which he knew were the graves of those who had died before him. The great bough that reached out over the spot where the earth was trampled smooth in horrible significance--the branch from which a noosed rope dangled sinuously in the breeze that came straight off the ocean--swayed with majestic deliberation as if Fate herself were beckoning.  He clasped his hands upon the saddle-horn and, stealthily loosening the dagger-point from the hem of his sleeve, slid the weapon cautiously into his hand. When he felt the handle against his palm, he knew that he had been holding his breath, and that the sigh he gave was an involuntary relief that the others had not glimpsed the blade under his clasped fingers. He would not have to dangle from that swinging rope, at any rate.  \"Hello, pard!\" Dade's voice called thickly from close behind. \"Looking for some rope?\"  Jack turned his head just as the looped rawhide slithered past him and settled taut over the head of the startled buckskin. Like a lightning gleam slashing through the dark he saw Dade's plan, and played his own part unhesitatingly.  Two movements he made while the buckskin sat back upon his haunches and gathered his muscles for a forward spring. The first was to lean and send a downward sweep of the dagger across the rope by which Shorty was leading the horse, and the second was a backward lunge that drove the knife deep into the bared throat of the Captain, stunned into momentary inaction by the suddenness of Dade's assault.  The buckskin gave a mighty leap that caught Shorty unawares and sent him into a crumpled heap in the sand. Dade's riata, tight as a fiddle-string at first, slackened as the buckskin, his breath coming in snorts, surged alongside. Jack leaned again--this time to snatch the ivory-handled revolver from the holster on Dade's saddle. As well as he could with his legs held rigid by the rope that tied his ankles, he twisted in the saddle and sent leaden answer to the spiteful barking of the guns that called upon them to halt.  [Illustration: He twisted in the saddle and sent leaden answer to the spiteful barking of the guns.]  Davis he shot, and saw him sway and fall flat, with a smoking gun in his hand. Another crumpled forward; and Shorty, just getting painfully upon his feet, he sent into the sand again to stay; for his skill with small arms was something uncanny to witness, and his temper was up and turning him into a savage like the rest.  But the range was rapidly growing to rifle-length, and death fell short of his enemies after Shorty went down. When he saw his fourth bullet kick up a harmless little geyser of sand two rods in advance of the agitated crowd, he left off and turned to his friend.  \"I thought you were drunk,\" he observed inanely, as is common to men who have just come through situations for which no words have been coined.  \"You ain't the only one who made that mistake,\" Dade retorted grimly, and looked back. \"Good thing those hombres are afoot. We'll get on a little farther and then we'll fix a hackamore so you can do your own riding,\"  \"I can't stand it to ride any farther--\"  \"Are you shot?\" Dade pulled in a little and looked anxiously into his face.  \"It's the rope. They tied it so tight it's torture. I'd never have believed it could hurt so--but they gave me an extra twist or two to show their friendship, I reckon.\"  Dade rode on beyond a little, wooded knoll before he stopped, lest the crowd, seeing them halt, might think it worth while to follow them afoot.  \"They surely didn't intend you to fall off,\" he said whimsically, when his knife released the strain. But his lips tightened at the outrage; and his eyes, bent upon Jack's left ankle, wore the look of one who could kill without pity.  \"They'll never do it to another man,\" declared Jack, with vindictive relish. \"It was Davis and the Captain; I killed 'em both.\" He rolled stiffly from the saddle, found his feet like dead things and stumbled to a little hillock, where he sat down.  Dade, kneeling awkwardly in his heavy, bearskin chaparejos, picked at the bonds with the point of his knife. \"Lucky you had on boots,\" he remarked. \"Even as it is, you're likely to carry creases for a while. How the deuce did you manage to get into this particular scrape?--if I might ask!\"  \"I didn't get into it. This particular scrape got me. Say, it's lucky you happened along just when you did.\"  To this very obvious statement the other made no reply. He cut the last strand of the rope that bound Jack's ankles so mercilessly, and stood up. \"You better take off your boots and rub some feeling into your feet while I make a hackamore for that horse. The sooner we get out of this, the better. What's left of the Committee will probably be pretty anxious to see you.\"  \"Oh, damn the Committee!--as Bill remarked after the trial.\" Jack made an attempt to remove one of his boots, found the pain intolerable and desisted with a groan. \"I wish they would show up,\" he declared. \"I'd like to give them a taste of this foot-tying business!\"  Dade went on tying the hackamore with a haste that might be called anxious. With just two bullets left in the pistol and with no powder upon his person for further reloading, he could not share Jack's eagerness to meet the Committee again. When Surry gave over rolling with his tongue the little wheel in his bit, and with lifted head and eyes alert perked his ears forward towards the hill they had just crossed, he slipped the hackamore hurriedly into place and turned to his friend.  \"You climb on to Surry, and we'll pull out,\" he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12139"],["title","The Gringos (#8)"],["body","shortly. \"I wouldn't give two pesos for this buckskin, but we're going to add horse-stealing to our other crimes; and while it's all right to damn the Committee, it's just as well to do it at a distance, just now, old man.\"  The caution fell flat, for Jack was wholly absorbed by the pain in his feet and ankles, as the blood was being forced into the congested veins. Dade led the white horse close, to save him the discomfort of hobbling to it, and waited until Jack was in the saddle before he vaulted upon the tricky-eyed buckskin. He led the way down into a shallow depression which wound aimlessly towards the ocean; and later, when trees and bushes and precipitous bluffs threatened to bar their way, he swung abruptly to the east and south.  \"Maybe you won't object so hard to Palo Alto now,\" he bantered at last, when at dusk he ventured out upon \"El Camino Real\" (which is pure Spanish for \"The King's Highway\"), that had linked Mission to Mission all down the fertile length of California when the land was wilderness. \"Solitude ought to feel good, after to-day.\" When he got no answer, Dade looked around at the other.  Jack's face showed vaguely through the night fog creeping in from the clamorous ocean off to the west. His legs were hanging free of the stirrups, and his hands rested upon the high saddle-horn.  \"Say, Dade,\" he asked irrelevantly and with a mystifying earnestness, \"which do you think would kill a man quickest--a slash across the throat, or a stab in the heart?\"  \"I wouldn't call either one healthy. Why?\"  \"I was just wondering,\" Jack returned ambiguously. \"If you hadn't happened along--say, how did you happen to come? Was that another sample of my fool's luck?\" Since the coincidence had not struck him before, one might guess that he was accustomed to having Dade at his elbow when he was most needed.  \"Bill Wilson sent word that you were making seven kinds of a fool of yourself--Bill named a few of them--and advised me to get you out of town. I've more respect for Bill's judgment than ever. I took his advice as it stood--and therefore, you're headed for safer territory than you were awhile ago. It ain't heaven,\" he added, \"but it's next thing to it.\"  \"I'm not hankering after heaven, right now,\" averred Jack. \"Most any other place looks good to me; I'm not feeling a hit critical, Dade. And if I didn't say it before, old man, you're worth a whole regiment to a fellow in a fix.\"     CHAPTER V  HOSPITALITY   If you would enjoy that fine hospitality which gives gladly to strangers and to friends alike of its poverty or plenty, and for the giving asks nothing in return, you should seek the far frontiers; but if you would see hospitality glorified into something more than a simple virtue, then you should find, if you can, one of the old-time haciendas that were the pride of early California.  Time was when the wild-eyed cattle which bore upon their fat-cushioned haunches the seared crescent that proclaimed them the property of old Don Andres Picardo (who owned, by grant of the king, all the upper half of the valley of Santa Clara) were free to any who hungered. Time was when a traveler might shoot a fat yearling and feast his fill, unquestioned by the don or the don's dark-eyed vaqueros.  Don Andres Picardo was a large-hearted gentleman; and to deny any man meat would bring to his cheeks a blush for his niggardliness. That was in the beginning, when he reigned in peace over the peninsula. When the vaqueros, jingling indignantly into the patio of his home, first told of carcasses slaughtered wantonly and left to rot upon the range with only the loin and perhaps a juicy haunch missing, their master smiled deprecatingly and waved them back whence they came. There were cattle in plenty. What mattered one steer, or even a fat cow, slain wastefully? Were not thousands left?  But when tales reached him of cattle butchered by the hundred, and of beef that was being sold for an atrocious price in San Francisco, the old Spaniard was shocked into laying aside the traditions and placing some check upon the unmannerly \"gringos\" who so abused his generosity.  He established a camp just within the northern boundary of his land; and there he stationed his most efficient watch-dog, Manuel Sepulveda, with two vaqueros whose business it was to stop the depredations.  Meat for all who asked for meat, paid they in gold or in gratitude--that was their \"patron's\" order. But they must ask. And the vaqueros rode diligently from bay to mountain slopes, and each day their hatred of the Americanos grew deeper, as they watched over the herds of their loved patron, that the gringos might not steal that which they might, if they were not wolves, have for the asking.  The firelight in the tule-thatched hut of Manuel Sepulveda winked facetiously at the black fog that peered in at the open door. A night wind from the north crept up, parted the fog like a black curtain and whispered something which set the flames a-dancing as they listened. The fog swung back jealously to hear what it was, and the wind went away to whisper its wonder-tale to the trees that rustled astonishment and nodded afterward to one another in approval, like the arrant gossips they were. The chill curtain fell straight and heavy again before the door, so that the firelight shone dimly through its folds; but not before Dade, riding at random save for the trust he put in the sure homing instinct of his horse, caught the brief gleam of light and sighed thankfully.  \"We'll stop with old Manuel to-night,\" he announced cheerfully. \"Here's his cabin, just ahead.\"  \"And who's old Manuel?\" asked Jack petulantly, because of the pain in his feet and his own unpleasant memories of that day.  \"Don Andres Picardo's head vaquero. He camps here to keep an eye on the cattle. Some fellows from town have been butchering them right and left and doing a big business in beef, according to all accounts. Manuel hates gringos like centipedes, but I happened to get on the good side of him--partly because my Spanish is as good as his own. An Americano who has black hair and can talk Spanish like the don himself isn't an Americano, in Manuel's eyes.\"  While they were unsaddling under the oak tree, where the vaqueros kept their riding gear in front of the cabin, Manuel himself came to the door and stood squinting into the fog, while he flapped a tortilla dexterously between his brown palms.  \"Is it you, Valencia??\" he called out in Spanish, giving the tortilla a deft, whirling motion to even its edges.  Dade led the way into the zone of light, and Manuel stepped back with a series of welcoming nods. His black eyes darted curiously to the stranger, who, in Manuel's opinion, looked unpleasantly like a gringo, with his coppery hair waving crisply under his sombrero, and his eyes that were blue as the bay over there to the east. But when Dade introduced him, Jack greeted his squat host with a smile that was disarming in its boyish good humor, and with language as liquidly Spanish as Manuel's best Castilian, which he reserved for his talks with the patron on the porch when the señora and the young señorita were by.  The distrust left Manuel's eyes as he trotted across the hard-trodden dirt floor and laid the tortilla carefully upon a hot rock, where three others crisped and curled their edges in delectable promise of future toothsomeness.  He stood up and turned to Dade amiably, his knuckles pressing lightly upon his hips that his palms might be saved immaculate for the next little corn cake which he would presently slap into thin symmetry.  \"Madre de Dios!\" he cried suddenly, quite forgetting the hospitable thing he had meant to say about his supper. \"You are hurt, Señor! The blood is on your sleeve and your hand.\"  Dade looked down at his hand and laughed. \"I did get a scratch. I'll let you see what it's like.\"  \"You never told me you got shot!\" accused Jack sharply, from where he had thrown himself down on a bundle of blankets covered over with a bullock hide dressed soft as chamois.  \"Never thought of it,\" retorted Dade in Spanish, out of regard for his host.  \"We had some trouble with the gringos,\" he explained to Manuel. \"There was a little shooting, and a bullet grazed my arm. It doesn't amount to much, but I'll let you look at it.\"  \"Ah, the gringos!\" Manuel spat after the hated name. \"The patron is too good, too generous! They steal the cattle of the patron, though they might have all they need for the asking. Like the green worms upon the live oaks, they would strip the patron's herds to the last, lean old bull that is too tough even for their wolf teeth! Me, I should like to lasso and drag to the death every gringo who comes sneaking in the night for the meat which tastes sweeter when it is stolen. To-day Valencia rode down to the bayou--\"  While he told indignantly the tale of the latest pillage, he bared the wounded arm. Jack got stiffly upon his swollen feet to look. It was not a serious wound, as wounds go; a deep gash in the bicep, where a bullet meant for Dade's heart had plowed under his upraised arm four inches wide of its mark. It must have been painful, though he had not once mentioned it; and a shamed flush stung Jack's cheeks when he remembered his own complaints because of his feet.  \"You never told me!\" he accused again, this time in the language of his host.  \"The Señor Hunter has the brave heart of a Spaniard, though his blood is light,\" said Manuel rebukingly. \"The Señor Hunter would not cry over a bigger hurt than this!\"  Jack sat down again upon the bull-hide seat and dropped his face between his palms. Old Manuel spoke truer than he knew. Dade Hunter was made of the stuff that will suffer much for a friend and say nothing about it, and to-day was not the first time when Jack had all unwittingly given that friendship the test supreme.  Manuel carefully inspected the wound and murmured his sympathy. He pulled a bouquet of dry herbs from where it hung in a corner, under "]]]
