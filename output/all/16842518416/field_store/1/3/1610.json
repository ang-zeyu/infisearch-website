THE EGYPTIAN CONCEPTION OF IMMORTALITY  The Ingersoll Lecture, 1911  by  GEORGE ANDREW REISNER        THE INGERSOLL LECTURESHIP   Extract from the will of Miss Caroline Haskell Ingersoll, who died in Keene, County of Cheshire, New Hampshire, Jan. 26, 1893.  First.  In carrying out the wishes of my late beloved father, George Goldthwait Ingersoll, as declared by him in his last will and testament, I give and bequeath to Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., where my late father was graduated, and which he always held in love and honor, the sum of Five thousand dollars ($5,000) as a fund for the establishment of a Lectureship on a plan somewhat similar to that of the Dudleian lecture, that is--one lecture to be delivered each year, on any convenient day between the last of May and the first day of December, on this subject, \"the Immortality of Man,\" said lecture not to form a part of the usual college course, nor to be delivered by any Professor or Tutor as part of his usual routine of instruction, though any such Professor or Tutor may be appointed to such service.  The choice of said lecturer is not to be limited to any one religious denomination, nor to any one profession, but may be that of either clergyman or layman, the appointment to take place at least six months before the delivery of said lecture.  The above sum to be safely invested and three fourths of the annual interest thereof to be paid to the lecturer for his services and the remaining fourth to be expended in the publishment and gratuitous distribution of the lecture, a copy of which is always to be furnished by the lecturer for such purpose.  The same lecture to be named and known as the \"the Ingersoll lecture on the Immortality of Man.\"     CONTENTS     I.    Introduction   II.   Sources of the Material   III.

INTRODUCTION    Of the nations which have contributed to the direct stream of civilization, Egypt and Mesopotamia are at present believed to be the oldest.  The chronological dispute as to the relative antiquity of the two countries is of minor importance; for while in Babylonia the historical material is almost entirely inscriptional, in Egypt we know the handicrafts, the weapons, the arts, and, to a certain extent, the religious beliefs of the race up to a period when it was just emerging from the Stone Age.  In a word, Egypt presents the most ancient race whose manner of life is known to man.  From the beginning of its history--that is, from about 4500 B.C.--we can trace the development of a religion one of whose most prominent elements was a promise of a life after death.  It was still a great religion when the Christian doctrine of immortality was enunciated.  In the early centuries of the Christian era, it seemed almost possible that the worship of Osiris and Isis might become the religion of the classical world; and the last stand made by civilized paganism against Christianity was in the temple of Isis at Philae in the sixth century after Christ.  It is clear that a religion of such duration must have offered some of those consolations to man that have marked all great religions, chief of which is the faith in a spirit, in something that preserves the personality of the man and does not perish with the body.  This faith was, in fact, one of the chief elements in the Egyptian religion--the element best known to us through the endless cemeteries which fill the desert from one end of Egypt to the other, and through the funerary inscriptions.  It is necessary, however, to correct the prevailing impression that religion played the greatest part in Egyptian life or even a greater part than it does in Moslem Egypt.  The mistaken belief that death and the well-being of the dead overshadowed the existence of the living, is due to the fact that the physical character of the country has preserved for us the cemeteries and the funerary temples better than all the other monuments.  The narrow strip of fat black land along the Nile produces generally its three crops a year.  It is much too valuable to use as a cemetery.  But more than that, it is subject to periodic saturation with water during the inundation, and is, therefore, unsuitable for the burials of a nation which wished to preserve the contents of the graves.  On the other hand, the desert, which bounds this fertile strip so closely that a dozen steps will usually carry one from the black land to the gray,--the desert offers a dry preserving soil with absolutely no value to the living.  Thus all the funerary monuments were erected on the desert, and except where intentionally destroyed they are preserved to the present day.  The palaces, the towns, the farms, and many of the great temples which were erected on the black soil, have been pulled down for building material or buried deep under the steadily rising deposits of the Nile.  The tombs of six thousand years of dead have accumulated on the desert edge.  Moreover, our impression of these tombs has been formed from the monuments erected by kings, princes, priests, and the great and wealthy men of the kingdom.  The multitude of plain unadorned burial-places which the scientific excavator records by the thousands have escaped the attention of scholars interested in Egypt from the point of view of a comparison of religions.  It has also been overlooked that the strikingly colored mummies and the glaring burial apparatus of the late period cost very little to prepare.  The manufacture of mummies was a regular trade in the Ptolemaic period at least.  Mummy cases were prepared in advance with blank spaces for the names.  I do not think that any more expense was incurred in Egyptian funerals in the dynastic period than is the case among the modern Egyptians.  The importance of the funerary rites to the living must, therefore, not be exaggerated.     II. SOURCES OF THE MATERIAL   With the exception of certain mythological explanations supplied by the inscriptions and reliefs in the temples, our knowledge of Egyptian ideas in regard to the future life is based on funerary customs as revealed by excavations and on the funerary texts found in the tombs.  These tombs always show the same essential functions through all changes of form,--the protection of the burial against decay and spoliation, and the provision of a meeting-place where the living may bring offerings to the dead. Correspondingly, there are two sets of customs,--burial customs and offering customs.  The texts follow the same division.  For the offering place, the texts are magical formulas which, properly recited by the living, provide material benefit for the dead.  For the burial place, the texts are magical formulas to be used by the spirit for its own benefit in the difficulties of the spirit life.  These texts from the burial chambers are found in only a few graves,--those of the very great,--and their contents show us that they were intended only for people whose earthly position was exceptional.  From the funerary customs and the offering texts, a clear view is obtained of the general conception, the ordinary practice.  We see what was regarded as absolutely essential to the belief of the common man.  From the texts found in the burial chambers we get the point of view of the educated or powerful man, the things that might be done to gain for him an exceptional place in the other world.  Both of these classes of material must be considered, in order to gain a true idea of the practical beliefs.  For it must be emphasized from the beginning that we have in Egypt several apparently conflicting conceptions of immortality.  Nor are we anywhere near obtaining in the case of the texts the clearness necessary to understand fully all the differing views held by the priestly classes during a period of over two thousand years.     III. THE IDEAS OF THE PRIMITIVE RACE   The earliest belief in immortality is that which is shown to us by the burial customs of the primitive race,--the prehistoric Egyptian race.  About 4500 B.C.  we find the Egyptian race was just emerging from the Stone Age.  All the implements and weapons found are of flint or other stone.  The men of that time were ignorant of writing, but show a certain facility in line drawings of men, plants, and animals.  We have found thousands of their graves which all show the same idea of death.  Each person was buried with implements, weapons, ornaments,--no doubt those actually used in life,-- with a full outfit of household pots and pans, and with a supply of food.  The man was dead, but he still needed the same things he used in ordinary life.  By a fortunate chance we have even recovered bodies accidentally desiccated and preserved intact in the dry soil.  These bodies do not show any trace of mutilation, mummification, or any other preparation for the grave except probably washing.  The dead body was simply laid on a mat in the grave, covered with a cloth and a mat or a skin, and then with clean gravel.  But with it was placed all those things which the man might need if his life were to go on in some mysterious, unseen way, as life went on among those on earth.  Possibly his relations as in later times brought offerings of food to the grave, but here even the dry soil of Egypt fails to furnish positive evidence.  All this shows a plain simple belief in the persistence of the life of a man as distinguished from the body --a belief"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12255"],["title","The Egyptian Conception of Immortality (#1)"],["body"," prevalent among primitive people.  It contains nothing unusual, and is probably perfectly explicable psychologically by means of dreams.  There is little or no change in this underlying belief to be observed in the burial customs of the Egyptians during the late predynastic period.  Copper weapons and implements succeed stone in the graves.  All those objects in whose manufacture the new tools are used show changes of technique and form.  It is even curious to note that some of the older stone and flint objects, some of the older pots and pans, are still made as a matter of tradition.  The importance of this is not to be overlooked.  For centuries men had used flint knives and they had baked their bread in flat mud saucers set in the ashes.  For the centuries these flint knives and these cakes with their saucers had been placed in the graves.  Gradually metal knives and better bread pans displaced these more primitive objects in daily life; but the older primitive objects were still placed in the graves as a matter of tradition.  It must be remembered, of course, that these traditional objects were also in use in ancient traditional ceremonies on earth.  The sacrificial animals were still slaughtered with flint knives.  The old-style cakes were still offered in the holy places.  In other words, life on earth now consisted of ordinary material life and a traditional life--a life that clung to the forms of a more primitive civilization as somehow more effective with the divine powers.  This view is closely reflected in the grave furniture; here, too, were the practical objects and the traditional ceremonial objects.  Life after death is still always the same as life on earth--with the same physical needs, with the same need of help from supernatural powers or against supernatural powers. The spirit of the man needed the spirit of the copper axe to swing in battle; but just as much he needed the spirit of the flint knife to make the first cut across the throat of the spirit bull of sacrifice.  Remember this--the other world, in which lived the spirit of the dead, was filled with the spirits or ghosts of all things and animals.  The other, the unseen, was a duplicate of this world; all things which have shape were there --even to the black fields and the broad river of Egypt.  This is the foundation of the Egyptian conception of immortality.  Through all the modifications and accretions of the following three thousand years, this foundation idea is always clearly visible. All the statues, the carved and painted tombs, all the curious little model boats and workshops, all the painted mummies, all the amulets, the scarabs, the little funerary statuettes,--all this mummery which seems to be so characteristic and so essential, is only the means to an end, and an ever changing means to secure a successful comfortable existence of the spirit in the life after death,--in the ghostly duplicate of life on earth.     IV. THE EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD   It is clear that the effort to attain an immortality which is merely a ghostly continuation of life on earth must reflect the general development of Egyptian culture,--especially the advance in arts and crafts.  One of the most striking examples of this fact is the introduction of metal working mentioned above and the consequent placing of both flint and copper in the grave, --the division of grave furniture into practical objects and ceremonial objects, which is the foundation for the use of symbolic objects in later times.  The advance in arts and crafts not only suggests new ideas of the necessities of the spirit, but it provides the necessary technical skill for the more effective satisfaction of all the needs of the dead.  This takes, first of all, the form of supplying a place for the burial, which furnishes greater security to the body and a better communication between the living and the dead.  From the First Dynasty, say from 3300 B.C. down, as soon as the Egyptian had mastered the use of mud-brick and wood, we gain the certainty of an idea which could only be guessed at in the primitive period.  A place is provided above the grave at which the living could meet the spirit of the dead with _periodical_ offerings of food and other necessities.  In the life after death, spirit food and drink, once used, ceased to be, just as in life on earth, and had to be renewed from day to day, lest the spirit of the dead suffer from hunger and thirst.  One of the great developments of the first six dynasties looked to the provision of these daily necessities.  The invention of writing was immediately utilized.  About the beginning of the First Dynasty writing was invented for administrative and other practical purposes.  Gravestones, bearing in relief the name of the dead, were set up in the offering places of the kings and court people.  These were probably reminders for use in some simple formula recited in presenting the periodical offerings.  As the Egyptians became more familiar with the use of writing, the offering formula was written out in full, enlarged and modified.  Sculptures, both relief and statuary, in every stage of their development, were used as magical accessories to the offering rites.  So, also, the whole history of Egyptian architecture was reflected in the tomb; for every advance brought about some change in the form or structure.  In fact, the whole development of the form of the Egyptian tomb depended on the development of technical skill.  The same funerary functions are served throughout.  As all the great artisans were at the command of the king, all the great technical discoveries and inventions were first made in his service.  But every permanent gain in knowledge was a benefit to the race and utilized by the common people.  So, for example, the skill acquired in stone-cutting, during the construction of the great pyramids, was utilized a little later in producing rock-cut tombs from one end of Egypt to the other.  The functions of the grave remained the same.  Yet with the changes in form resulting from the growth of skill, modifications in the funerary customs crept in.  The mud-brick tombs of the early part of the First Dynasty, like the pre-dynastic graves, had only one chamber, limited in size by the length of logs obtainable to form the roof.  The growing desire for ostentation found a way to enlarge the tombs by building them with a number of chambers.  The burial was placed in the central chamber and the burial furniture in the additional chambers.  In this way the separation of the furniture and the actual burial was brought about.     V. THE OLD EMPIRE   Another change comes in the Fourth Dynasty, and is to be noted first in the royal tombs, as is always the case.  The Egyptians had now learned to cut stone and build with it.  The burial chambers hollowed in the solid rock were necessarily smaller than the old chambers dug in the gravel and no longer sufficient to contain the great mass of furniture gathered by a king for his grave.  On the other hand, the chapels with the increase in architectural skill could be build of great size.  Corresponding to these technical conditions we find a great increase in the importance of the chapel.  It becomes a great temple, whose magazines were filled with all those objects which had formerly been placed in the burial chamber and were so necessary to the life of the spirit.  The temples of the third pyramid, for example, contained nearly two thousand stone vessels.  Great estates were set aside by will, and the income appointed to the support of certain persons who on their side were obliged to keep up the temple, to make the offerings and to recite the magical formulas which would provide the spirit with all its necessities.  Following closely the growth in importance of the royal chapels, the private offering places assumed a greater importance.  The custom of periodic offerings and the use of magical texts grew until it reached its highest point in the Fifth Dynasty.  At this time there is a burial chamber deep underground where the dead was laid securely in ancient traditional attitude, with his clothing and a few personal ornaments.  As a rule, it is only the women, always conservative, that have anything more.  Above this grave, there is a solid rectangular structure, with a chapel or offering place on the side towards the valley.  The offering place is always there, no matter how poor or small the tomb.  But to understand just what the Egyptian thought, we must turn to the better tombs.  The walls are of limestone carved with reliefs representing the important processes of daily life,--sowing, reaping, cattle-herding, hunting, pot-making, weaving,--all those actions which furnish the daily supplies.  The dead man is represented overseeing all this.  Finally, near the offering niche, he is represented seated, usually with his wife at a table bearing loaves of the traditional _ta_ bread.  Beside him are represented heaps of provisions--meat, cakes, vegetables, wine and beer.  A list of objects is never missing, marked with numbers,--a thousand loaves of bread, a thousand head of cattle, a thousand jars of wine, a thousand garments, and so on. We know from latter inscriptions that these words, properly recited, created for the spirit a store of spirit objects in equal numbers.  Below the niche is an altar for receiving actual offerings of food and drink.  It is clear that the living, coming to this offering place with or without material offerings, could, by proper recitation, secure to the spirit of the dead all its daily needs.  This offering niche is the door of the other world --symbolically and actually.  In many graves the niche is carved to represent a door--sometimes opening in, and sometimes opening out.  Moreover, in several cases the figure of the dead is carved half emerging from the opening door--a figure in all ways like the figure of the dead as he is represented in the scenes from life."]]]
