But I don't think that in rough water she'll be much good.\"  \"No, I'd prefer the Flying Fish for the waters hereabouts,\" agreed Rob, \"it's liable to come on rough in a hurry and then a chap who was out in a dry-goods box, like that thing, would be in trouble.\"  \"What are you calling a dry-goods box?\" demanded an indignant voice behind them, and turning, the lads saw Sam Redding with a menacing look on his face.  A little way behind him stood Bill Bender and Jack Curtiss.  \"Oh, I beg your pardon, Sam,\" said Rob.  \"I really admire your hydroplane very much, and I think it will give us a tussle for the trophy, all right; but I don't think she'd be much good in any kind of a sea-way.\"  \"That's my business, you interfering little runt,\" snapped Sam, who, with Bill Bender and Jack Curtiss to back him, felt very brave; though ordinarily he would have avoided trouble with the young scouts.  \"What are you doing spying around the yard here, anyhow?\" he went on insolently.  \"We are not spying,\" indignantly burst out Merritt.  \"We asked Tom Jennings if we couldn't look at your hydroplane, as we were naturally interested in her, and he gave us permission.\"  \"Well, he had no business to,\" growled Sam; \"he ought to be attending to his work instead of showing a lot of nosy young cubs my new boat.\"  \"They are capable of stealing your ideas,\" chimed in Jack Curtiss, \"and putting them on their own boat.\"  \"That's ridiculous,\" laughed Rob, \"as I said I wouldn't want to have anything to do with such a contrivance except on a lake or a river.\"  \"Well, you keep your advice and your ideas to yourself, and get out of this yard!\" roared Sam, waxing bolder and bolder, and mistaking Rob's conciliatory manner for cowardice.  \"I've a good mind to punch your head.\"  \"Better come on and try it,\" retorted Rob, preparing for the immediate onslaught which it seemed reasonable from Sam's manner to expect.  But it didn't come.  Muttering something about \"young cubs,\" and \"keeping the boat-yard gate locked,\" Sam turned to his chums and invited them to come and try out his new motor in the shop.  As the three chums had no desire to \"mix it up with Sam on his own place,\" as Tubby put it, they left the yard promptly, and walked on down the water-front to the wharf at which lay the Flying Fish, the fastest craft in the Hampton Motor Boat Club. Rob's boat was, to tell the truth, rather broad of beam for a racer and drew quite a little water.  She had a powerful motor and clean lines, however, and while not primarily designed solely for \"mug-hunting,\" had beaten everything she had raced with during the few months since the boys had completed her.  The money for her motor had been given to Rob by his father, who was quite indulgent to Rob in money matters, having noticed that the lad always expended the sums given him wisely.  \"Let's take a spin,\" suddenly suggested Tubby.  \"Nothing to prevent us,\" answered Rob; \"we've got plenty of time before dinner. Come on, boys.\"  The lads were soon on board and examining the gasoline tank, to see how much fuel they had on hand, and oiling up the engine. The fuel receptacle proved to be almost full, so after filling the lubricant cups and attending to the batteries, they started up the engine--a powerful, three cylindered, twelve-horse affair capable of driving the twenty-two foot Flying Fish through the water at twelve miles an hour or better.  Just as Rob was casting off the head-line there came a hail from the wharf above them.  \"Ahoy, there, shipmates!  Where are yer bound fer this fine, sunny day?\"  The lads looked up to see the weather-beaten countenance of Captain Job Hudgins, one of the characters of the vicinity.  He was a former whaler, and lived on a small island some distance from Hampton.  On his little territory he fished and grew a few vegetables, \"trading in\" his produce at the Hampton grocery stores for his simple wants.  He, however, had a pension, and was supposed to have a \"snug little fortune\" laid by.  His only companion in his island solitude was it big Newfoundland dog named \"Skipper.\"  The animal stood beside its master on the dock and wagged its tail at the sight of the boys, whom it knew quite well from their frequent visits to the captain's little island.  \"Hullo, captain!\" shouted Rob, as the veteran saluted his three young friends.   \"Where's your boat?\"  \"Oh, her engine went--busted, and I had to leave her at the yard below fer repairs,\" explained the captain.  \"I wonder if yer boys can give me a lift back if yer goin' near Topsail Island?\"  \"Surest thing you know,\" rejoined Rob hastily.  \"Come right aboard. But how are you going to get off your island again if your motor is laid up here to be fixed?\"  \"Oh, I'll use my rowboat,\" responded the old mariner, clambering down into the Flying Fish.  \"Say, this is quite a right smart contraption, ain't she?\"  \"We think she is a pretty good little boat,\" modestly replied Rob, taking his place at the wheel.  \"Now, then, Merritt, start up that engine.\"  \"Hold on a minute!\" shouted Tubby.  \"We forgot the dog.\"  Sure enough, Skipper was dashing up and down the wharf in great distress at the prospect of being deserted.  \"Put yer boat alongside that landin' stage at the end of the wharf,\" suggested his master.  \"Skipper can get aboard from there, I reckon.\"  Rob steered the Flying Fish round to the floating landing, to which an inclined runway led from the wharf.  Skipper dashed down it as soon as he saw what was happening, and was waiting, ready to embark, when the Flying Fish came alongside.  \"Poor old Skipper, I reckon yer thought we was goin' ter maroon yer,\" said Captain Job, as the animal jumped on board with a bark of \"thanks\" for his rescue.  \"I tell yer, boys, I wouldn't lose that dog fer all the money in Rob's father's bank.  He keeps good watch out an the Island, I'll tell yer.\"  \"I didn't think any one much came there, except us,\" said Rob, as the Flying Fish headed away from the wharf and began to cut through the waters of the inlet.  \"Oh, yes; there's others,\" responded the old man.  \"That Jack Curtiss lad and his two chums are out there quite often.\"  \"Bill Bender and Sam Redding, I suppose you mean,\" said Tubby.  \"Those their names?\" asked the captain.  \"Well, I don't know any good uv any uv 'em.  Old Skipper here chased 'em away from my melon patch the other day.  I reckon they thought Old Scratch was after them, the way they run; but they got away with some melons, just the same.\"  The old man laughed aloud at the recollection of the marauders' precipitous flight.  That Jack Curtiss and his two cronies had made a rendezvous of the island was news to the boys, and not agreeable news, either. They had been planning a patrol camp there later on in the summer, and the bully and his two chums were not regarded by them as desirable neighbors. However, they said nothing, as they could not claim sole right to use the island, which was property that had been so long in litigation that It had come to be known as \"No Man's Land\" as well as by its proper name.  The captain was only a squatter there, but no one cared to disturb him, and he had led the existence of a semi-hermit there for many years.  The Flying Fish rapidly covered the calm waters of the inlet and was soon dancing over the swells outside.  \"I'm going to let her out a bit,\" said Rob suddenly; \"look out for spray.\"  \"Spray don't bother a brine-pickled old salt like me,\" laughed the captain.  \"Let her go.\"  The Flying Fish seemed fairly to leap forward as Merritt gave her the full power of her engine.  As Rob had said, it did indeed behoove her occupants to look out for spray.  The sparkling spume came flying back in sheets as she cut through the waves, but the boys didn't mind that any more than did their weather-beaten companion.  As for Skipper, he barked aloud in sheer joy as the Flying Fish slid along as if she were trying to live up to her name to her utmost ability.  \"This is a good little sea boat,\" remarked the captain, as they plunged onward.  \"She's as seaworthy as she is speedy, I guess.\"  \"She'll stand a lot of knocking about, and that's a fact,\" agreed Rob.  \"Well,\" remarked the old man, gazing about him, \"it's a good thing that she is, fer, if I'm not mistaken--and I'm not often off as regards the weather--we are goin' ter have quite a little blow before yer boys get back home.\"  \"A storm?\" asked Tubby, somewhat alarmed.  \"Oh, no; not what yer might call a storm,\" laughed the captain; \"but just what we used to term a 'capful uv wind.'\"  \"Well, so long as it isn't a really bad blow, it won't trouble the Flying Fish,\" Rob assured him.  \"Hullo!\" exclaimed the old man suddenly.  \"What queer kind uv craft is that?\"  He pointed back to the mouth of the now distant inlet, from which a curious-looking black craft was emerging at what seemed to be great speed.  \"It's that hydroplane of Sam Redding's, for a bet!\" cried Rob. \"Here, Tubby, take the wheel a minute, while I put the glasses on her.\"  The lad stood up in the heaving motor craft, steadying himself against the bulwarks by his knees, and peered through his marine-glasses.  \"It's the hydroplane, sure enough,\" he said.  \"By ginger, but she can go, all right!  Sam and Jack and Bill are all in her.  They seem to be heading right out to sea, too.\"  \"Say!\" exclaimed Tubby suddenly, \"if it comes on to blow, as the captain said it would, they'll be in a bad fix, won't they?\"  \"In that ther shoe-box thing,\" scornfully exclaimed the old captain, who had also been looking through the glasses, \"why, I wouldn't give a confederate dollar bill with a hole in it fer their lives.\"     CHAPTER III  BOY SCOUTS TO THE RESCUE   \"Hadn't we better put back and warn them?\" suggested Merritt rather anxiously, for he was alarmed by the confident manner in which the old seaman prophesied certain"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12112"],["title","The Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol (#3)"],["body","to the hydroplane if the weather freshened.  \"No; see, she's heading toward us.  I guess they want a race,\" cried Rob.  \"We'll slow down a bit and let them catch up.\"  In a few moments the hydroplane was alongside.  The yellow hood over her powerful engines glistened with the wet of the great bow-wave her speed had occasioned, and her powerful motor was exhausting with a roar like a battery of machine guns.  Crouched aft of the engine hood was Sam Redding, who held the wheel. Jack Curtiss and Bill Bender were in the stern.  They sat tandem-wise in the narrow racing shell.  \"Want a tow rope for that old stone dray of yours?\" jeered Jack Curtiss, as the speedy little racer ranged alongside.  He did not know that the Flying Fish was slowed down, and that although the hydroplane appeared to be capable of tremendous speed, she was not actually so very much faster than Rob's boat.  \"Say, you fellows,\" warned Rob, making a trumpet of his hands, \"the captain says it's coming on to blow before long.  You'd better get back into the inlet with that craft of yours.\"  \"Save your breath to cool your coffee,\" shouted Sam Redding back at him, across the fifty feet or so of water that lay between the two boats.  \"We know what we are about.\"  \"But you're risking your lives,\" shouted Merritt.  \"That thing wouldn't live ten minutes in any kind of a sea.\"  \"Well, we're not such a bunch of old women as to be scared of a little wetting,\" jeered Jack Curtiss.  \"So long!  We've got no time to wait for that old tub of yours.\"  Before the boys could voice any more warnings, the hydroplane, which had been slowed down, dashed off once more.  \"I don't know what we are to do,\" spoke up Merritt.  \"We can't compel them to go in, and, after all, the captain may be mistaken.\"  \"No, I'm not, my son,\" rejoined the veteran.  \"I can smell wind--and see them 'mare's tails' in the sky over yonder.  They're as fall uv wind as a preacher is uv texts.\"  \"Well, we've done our best to warn them,\" concluded Rob.  \"If they are so foolhardy as to keep on, we can't help it.\"  In half an hour more the boys had landed the captain at the little pier he had built on his island, and to which his rowboat was attached, and were ready to start back, good-bys having been said.  \"Hark!\" exclaimed the captain, as Rob prepared to give the order to \"Go ahead.\"  The boys listened, and heard a low, distant moaning sound, something like the deepest rumbling notes of a church organ.  \"That's the wind comin',\" warned the captain.  \"Yer'd better be hurryin' back.\"  With more hasty good-bys, the lads got under way at once.  As they emerged from the lee of the island they could see that seaward the ocean was being rapidly lashed into choppy, white-crested waves by the advancing storm, and that the wind was freshening into a really stiff breeze.  \"Those fellows must be wishing they took our advice now if they are fools enough to have kept out,\" said Merritt, as he slowed down the engine so as to permit the Flying Fish to ride the rising seas more easily.  \"Yes, I guess they're doing some tall thinking,\" agreed Tubby, as a wave caught the little Flying Fish \"quartering\" on her port bow, and sent a white smother of spray swirling back over her occupants.  \"That's the time we got it,\" laughed Rob, from the wheel, peering straight ahead.  Suddenly he uttered a shout and pointed seaward.  \"Look there!\" he shouted at the top of his voice.  \"There are those three fellows, and they're in trouble, from the looks of it.\"  The others looked, and beheld, half a mile or so away, on the roughening waters, the hull of the hydroplane.  She was tossing up and down like a cork, and apparently was drifting helplessly, with her motor broken down, in the heavy sea.  Her occupants seemed to be bailing her; but as they caught sight of the Flying Fish they stood up and waved frantically.  \"Yes, they're in trouble, all right,\" agreed Tubby.  \"And I suppose we've got to go and get them out of it.\"  Rob had already put the Flying Fish about and headed her for the distressed craft.  As they drew near, Sam Redding began shouting:  \"Help, help!  We're sinking, we're sinking!\"  Jack Curtiss and Bill Bender, drenched to the skin with spray and white with fright, said nothing, but a look of great relief came over their faces as the chums' boat ranged alongside.  \"I don't want to risk ramming my boat by coming right alongside,\" shouted Rob.  \"You'll have to jump for it.  Don't be scared. We'll pull you aboard.\"  The three youths on the water-logged hydroplane looked somewhat alarmed at the prospect, but Rob knew that Jack and Bill could swim.  He was not sure of Sam, but assumed, from the fact that he had lived by the sea all his life, that he was equally at home in the water.  The hesitation of Jack Curtiss and his chum was over in a minute, as the hydroplane gave a plunge that seemed as if it would be her last. Lightly dressed as they were, in canvas trousers, sleeveless jerseys and yachting shoes, it was no trick at all for them to swim the few feet to the Flying Fish.  As they leaped overboard, Sam lingered.  \"Come on, Sam,\" shouted Jack, as the boys lugged the two dripping, sputtering castaways on board.  \"I--I can't swim.  You'll have to come alongside for me,\" stuttered the badly-scared Sam.  \"All right.  Hold on, and we'll do what we can,\" hailed Rob, starting to carry out the risky maneuver of getting alongside the plunging hydroplane in the heavy sea.  In some never-to-be-explained manner, however, the frightened Sam suddenly lost his balance in the tossing racing boat, and, clawing desperately at her bulwarks to save himself, shot over the side.  \"He'll drown!\" shouted Jack Curtiss.  \"He can't swim, and he'll drown.\"  \"If you knew that, why didn't you stand by him?\" truculently growled Tubby.  Without an instant's hesitation, Merritt threw off the jacket he had put on when it started to blow, and slipped off his shoes. He was overboard and striking out for the drowning boy before those in the Flying Fish even realized his purpose.  With swift, powerful strokes he got alongside Sam just as the owner of the hydroplane was going down for the third time.  As the brave boy seized the struggling, frightened youth he felt himself gripped by the panic-stricken Sam in a frenzied hold of desperate intensity.  His arms were pinioned by the drowning wretch, and they both vanished beneath the waves.  As they went under, however, Merritt managed to get one hand free, and recalling what he had read of what to do under such conditions, struck the other boy a terrific blow between the eyes.  It stunned Sam completely, and, to his great relief, Merritt felt the imprisoning grip relax.  He could then handle Sam easily, and as they shot to the surface he saw the Flying Fish bearing down on them, with four white, strained faces searching the tumbling waters.  In a few moments the unconscious lad and his rescuer were hauled on board, and Rob, after congratulations, headed the Flying Fish for the mouth of the inlet, which was still some distance off.  Tubby and Bill Bender laid Sam on his stomach, across a thwart, and started to try to get some of the salt water, of which he had swallowed great quantities, out of him.  He soon gave signs of returning consciousness, and opened his eyes just as Jack Curtiss was demanding to know if the Boy Scouts weren't going to take the hydroplane in tow.  \"Not much we're not,\" responded Rob.  \"I'm sorry to have to leave her; but this sea is getting up nastier every minute, and there's no way of getting a line to her without running more risk than I want to take. We've had one near-drowning and we don't want another.\"  \"If this was my boat, I'd pick Sam's boat up,\" sullenly replied the bully.  \"You ought to be mighty glad we came along when we did,\" indignantly spoke up Tubby.  \"You'd have been in a bad fix if we hadn't.  Instead of being thankful for it, all you can do is to kick about leaving the hydroplane.\"  An angry reply was on the other's lips, but Bill Bender checked it by looking up and saying: \"I guess the kid's right, Jack.  Let it go at that.\"  The bully glowered.  He felt his pride much wounded at having been compelled to seek the aid of the boys whom he despised and hated.  \"I suppose you'll go and blab it all over town about how you saved us,\" he sneered, as the Flying Fish threaded her way through the tumbling waters at the mouth of the inlet and began making her way up it.  \"I don't think we shall,\" replied Rob quietly.  \"I mean to recommend Merritt, though, to headquarters for his Red Honor.\"  \"Oh, you mean that cheap, bronze medal thing on a bit of red ribbon!\" sneered Jack.  \"Why, that isn't worth much.  You couldn't sell it for anything but old junk.  Why don't they make them of gold?\"  \"That 'bronze medal thing,' as you call it, is worth a whole lot to a Boy Scout,\" rejoined Rob in the same even tone.  \"More than you can understand.\"  On their arrival at the yacht-club pier the boys were overwhelmed with questions, and a doctor was summoned for Sam, who, as soon as he found himself safe, began to groan and show most alarming symptoms of being seriously affected by his immersion.  The boys were not able to conceal the fact that they had accomplished a brave rescue, and were overwhelmed with congratulations.  Merritt especially came in for warm praise and commendation.  \"You will certainly be granted your Red Honor,\" declared Mr. Wingate, who, besides being commodore of the Yacht Club, was one of the gentlemen whom Rob had persuaded to act as Scout Master for the new patrol.  Merritt escaped from the crowd of admiring motor-boat men and boys as soon as he could, and hastened home for a change of clothes.  On the arrival of Dr. Telfair, the village physician, he pronounced that there was nothing whatever the matter with Sam but a bad fright, and prescribed dry garments and hot lemonade.  \"Don't I need any medicine?\" groaned Sam, determined to make the most out of his"]]]
