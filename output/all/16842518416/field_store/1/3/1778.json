In the light of these profound religious teachings may any one reasonably question the right of these stories to a place in the Bible?  Did not Jesus himself frequently use illustrations drawn from earlier history or from nature to make clear his teachings?  Is it not evidence of superlative teaching skill to use that which is familiar and, therefore, of interest to those taught, in order to inculcate the deeper moral and religious truths of life?   V.  SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IN THE NATURAL WORLD.  It is interesting and illuminating to note how the ancient Hebrew prophets in their religious teaching forecast the discoveries and scientific methods of our day.  This was because they had grasped universal principles.  Since the memorable evening in July, 1858, in which the views of Darwin and Wallace on the principles of variation and selection in the natural world were sent to the Linnaean Society in London, the leading scientists have laid great stress upon the doctrine of the survival of the \"fittest\" as the true explanation of progress in the natural world.  It was apparently made clear by Darwin, and supported by sufficient evidence, that \"any being, if it vary however slightly, in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and somewhat varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected.\"  This principle, since that day, has been thoroughly worked out in practically all the important fields of both the plant and animal world.  Moreover, the doctrine of evolution, dependent upon this principle, has exerted so great an influence upon the process of investigation and thinking in all fields of activity that the resulting change in method has amounted to a revolution.  The principle is applied not only in the field of biology, but also in the realm of astronomy, where we study the evolution of worlds, and in psychology, history, social science, where we speak of the development of human traits and of the growth of economic, political and social institutions.  It is necessary to remember in applying such a brief statement of a principle, that the words are used in a highly technical sense. The word \"fittest\" by no means need imply the best from the point of view of beauty or strength or usefulness in nature; nor does it necessarily mean, in reference to society, best from the point of view of morals or a higher civilization.  Rather the \"fittest\" means the being best adapted to the conditions under which it is living, or to its environment.  As a matter of fact, it is the general opinion that in practically all fields this principle works toward progress in the highest and best sense; but it is always a matter for specific study as well as of great scientific interest and importance, to determine where and how the variation and the corresponding selection tend to promote the morally good. Especially is this true in the study of society, where we should endeavor to see whether or not the \"fittest\" means also the highest from the moral and religious point of view.  The story of the flood gives us a most interesting example of the way in which the ancient Hebrews looked upon such a process of selection in the moral and religious world and taught it as a divine principle.  It is, therefore, one of the most suggestive and interesting of the writings of the early Israelites.   VI.  THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IN SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE.  From our modern point of view, the ancient Hebrew writers had a far deeper knowledge of moral and religious questions than of natural science.  They had a far keener sense of what was socially beneficial than of what was scientifically true.  However we may estimate their knowledge of geology and biology, we must grant that their beliefs regarding the good and ill effects of human action have in them much that is universally true, even though we may not follow them throughout in their theories of divine wrath and immediate earthly punishment of the wicked.  But is it not true almost invariably, if we look at social questions of every kind in a comprehensive way, that the survival of the fittest means the survival of the morally best?  That the religion which endures is of the highest type?  Business success in the long run, is so strongly based upon mutual confidence and trust, that, especially in these later days of credit organization, the dishonest man or even the tricky man cannot prosper long.  A sales manager of a prominent institution said lately that the chief difficulty that he had with his men was to make them always tell the truth.  For the sake of making an important sale they were often inclined to misrepresent his goods.  \"But nothing,\" he added, \"will so surely kill all business as misrepresentation.\"  Even a gambling book-maker on the race tracks in New York, before such work was forbidden by law, is said to have proudly claimed that absolute justice and honesty toward his customers was essential to his success and had therefore become the rule of his life. Although it is sometimes said that the man who guides his life by the maxim, \"Honesty is the best policy,\" is in reality not honest at heart, it must nevertheless be granted that in business the survival of the fittest means the survival of the most honest business man.  It may perhaps have been true in the days of Machiavelli that cruelty and treachery would aid the unscrupulous petty despot of Italy to secure and at times to maintain his dukedom; but certainly in modern days, when in all civilized countries permanently prosperous government is based ultimately upon the will of the people, the successful ruler can no longer be treacherous and cruel.  Even among our so-called \"spoils\" politicians and corrupt bosses, who hold their positions by playing upon the selfishness of their followers and the ignorance and apathy of the public, there must be rigid faithfulness to promises, and, at any rate, the appearance of promoting the public welfare.  Otherwise their term of power is short.  If we look back through the history of modern times, we shall find that the statesmen who rank high among the successful rulers of their countries are men of unselfish patriotism, and almost invariably men of personal uprightness and morality, and usually of deep religious feeling.  Think over the names of the great men of the United States, and note their characters.  Pick out the leading statesmen of the last half century in England, Germany and Italy. Do they not all stand for unselfish, patriotic purpose in their actions, and in character for individual honor and integrity?  The same is true in our social intercourse.  Brilliancy of intellect, however important in many fields of activity, counts for relatively little in home and social life, if not accompanied by graciousness of manner, kindness of heart, uprightness of character.  It may sometimes seem that the brilliant rascal succeeds, that the unscrupulous business man becomes rich, and that the hypocrite prospers through his hypocrisy.  If all society were made up of men of these low moral types, would such cases perhaps be more often found than now?  In a society of hypocrites, would the fittest for survival be the most skilful deceiver?  Or, even there, would the adage, \"There must be honor among thieves,\" hold, when it came to permanent organization?  But, whatever your answer, society fortunately is not made up of hypocrites or rascals of any kind.  With all the weakness of human nature found in every society, the growing success of the rule of the people throughout the world proves that fundamentally men and women are honest and true.  Generally common human nature is for the right.  Almost universally, if a mooted question touching morals can be put simply and squarely before the people, they will see and choose the right.  Fortunate it is for the world that the lessons taught by the early Hebrew writers regarding the survival of the moral and upright are true, and that good sense and religion both agree that in the long run, honor and virtue and righteousness not only pay the individual, but are essential to the prosperity of a nation.  _Questions for Further Consideration_.  Had most primitive peoples a tradition regarding the flood?  How do you explain the striking points of similarity between the flood stories of peoples far removed from each other?  Is there geological evidence that the earth, during human history, has been completely inundated?  What do you mean by a calamity?  Is it a mere accident, or an essential factor in the realization of the divine purpose in human history?  Are appalling calamities, like floods and earthquakes, the result of the working out of natural laws?  Are they unmitigated evils? Were the floods in China and the plagues in India, which destroyed millions of lives, seemingly essential to the welfare of the surviving inhabitants of those overpopulated lands?  What were the effects of the Chicago fire and the San Francisco earthquake upon these cities?  How far was the development of the modern commission form of city government one of the direct results of the Galveston flood?  To what extent is the modern progress in sanitation due to natural calamities?  What calamities?  Is a great calamity often necessary to arouse the inhabitants of a city or nation to the development of their resources and to the realisation of their highest possibilities?  What illustrations can you cite?  How do changes in the environment of men affect the moral quality of their acts?  How do circumstances affect the kind of act that will be successful?  During the Chinese revolution of 1912 in Peking and Nanking, looting leaders of mobs and plundering soldiers when captured were promptly decapitated without trial.

ABRAHAM, THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF HIS RACE.--Gen. 12:1-8; 13:1-13; 16; 18, 19; 21:7; 22:1-19.  _Parallel Readings_.    _Hist. Bible_ I, 73-94.   _Prin of Pol_., 160-175.  Jehovah said to Abraham, Go forth from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to the land that I will show thee, that I may make of thee a great nation; and I will surely bless thee, and make thy name great, so that thou shalt be a blessing, I will also bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse, so that all the families of the earth shall ask for themselves a blessing like thine own.  So Abraham went forth, as Jehovah had commanded him.--Gen. 12:1-4.  (_Hist. Bible_.)  By faith Abraham when he was called, obeyed to go out into a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out not knowing whither he went.  By faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; for he looked for the city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.--_Heb_. 11:8-10.  He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it--_Matt_. 10:39.   I.  THE PROPHETIC STORIES ABOUT ABRAHAM.  Many Biblical scholars claim that the data point to variant versions of the different stories about Abraham.  Thus, for example, there are two accounts of his deceptions regarding Sarah, one in 12:9-13:1, and the other in 20:1-17.  The oldest version of the story they believe is found in 26:1-14 and is told not of Abraham but of Isaac, whose character it fits far more consistently.  Similarly there are three accounts of the covenant with Abimelech (Gen. 21:22-31, 21:25-34, and 26:15-33).  The two accounts of the expulsion of Hagar and the birth of Ishmael, in Genesis 16:1-16 and 21:1-20 differ rather widely in details.  In one account Hagar is expelled and Ishmael is born after the birth of Isaac, and in the other before that event.  Do these variant versions indicate that they were drawn from different groups of narratives?  The differences in detail are in general closely parallel to those which the New Testament student finds in the different accounts of the same events or teachings in the life of Jesus.  They suggest to many that the author of the book of Genesis was eager to preserve each and every story regarding Abraham. Instead, however, of preserving intact the different groups of stories, as in the case of the Gospels, they have been combined with great skill.  Sometimes, as in the case of the expulsion of Hagar, the two versions are introduced at different points in the life of the patriarch.  More commonly the two or more versions are closely interwoven, giving a composite narrative that closely resembles Tatian's Diatessaron which was one continuous narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus, based on quotations from each of the four Gospels.   Fortunately, if this theory is right, the group of stories most fully quoted and therefore best preserved is the early Judean prophetic narratives.  When these are separated from the later parallels they give a marvelously complete and consistent portrait of Abraham.   II.  THE MEANING OF THE EARLY PROPHETIC STORIES ABOUT ABRAHAM.  Read the prophetic stories regarding Abraham (_Hist. Bible_ I, 73, 74, 79-81, 84-87, 90-92).  Are these stories to be regarded simply as chapters from the biography of the early ancestor of the Hebrews or, like the story of the Garden of Eden, do they have a deeper, a more universal moral and religious significance?  Back of the story of Abraham's call and settlement in Canaan clearly lies the historic fact that the ancestors of the Hebrews as nomads migrated from the land of Aram to seek for themselves and their descendants a permanent home in the land of Canaan.  Abraham, whose name in Hebrew means, \"Exalted Father,\" or as it was later interpreted, \"Father of a Multitude,\" naturally represents this historic movement, but the story of his call and settlement in Canaan has a larger meaning and value.  It simply and vividly illustrates the eternal truths that (1) God guides those who will be guided.  (2) He reveals himself alone to those who seek a revelation.  (3) His revelations come along the path of duty and are confined to no place or land.  (4) For those who will be led by him God has in store a noble destiny.  (5) Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God.  (6) Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth.  Thus this marvelous story presents certain of the noblest fruits of Israel's spiritual experiences. Incidentally it also deals with the relationship between the Hebrews and their neighbors, the Moabites, across the Jordan and the Dead Sea, for Lot in these earlier stories stands as the traditional ancestor of the Moabites and Ammonites.  It is evident that, like the opening narratives of Genesis, this story aimed to explain existing conditions, as well as to illustrate the deeper truths of life.  Similarly the story of the expulsion of Hagar, it is thought, aims primarily to explain the origin of Israel's foes, the nomadic Ishmaelites, who lived south of Canaan.  In the inscriptions of the Assyrian king Sennacherib, Hargaranu is the name of an Aramean tribe.  A tribe bearing a similar name is also mentioned in the south Arabian inscriptions.  The Hagar of the story is a typical daughter of the desert.  When she became the mother of a child, the highest honor that could come to a Semitic woman, she could not resist the temptation to taunt Sarah.  In keeping with early Semitic customs Sarah had full authority to demand the expulsion of Hagar, for in the eye of the law the slave wife was her property. The tradition of the revelation to Hagar also represented the popular explanation of the sanctity of the famous desert shrine Beer-lahal-roi.  Like most of the prophetic stories, this narrative teaches deeper moral lessons.  Chief among these is the broad truth that the sphere of God's care and blessing was by no means limited to Israel.  To the outcast and needy he ever comes with his message of counsel and promise.  Was Abraham right or wrong in yielding to Sarah's wish?  Was Sarah right or wrong in her attitude toward Hagar?  Was Hagar's triumphal attitude toward Sarah natural?  Was it right?  In the story of the destruction of Sodom Lot appears as the central figure.  His choice of the fertile plain of the Jordan had brought him into close contact with its inhabitants, the Canaanites. Abandoning his nomadic life, he had become a citizen, of the corrupt city of Sodom.  When at last Jehovah had determined to destroy the city because of its wickedness, Abraham persistently interceded that it be spared.  Its wickedness proved, however, too great for pardon.  Lot, who, true to his nomad training, hospitably received the divine messengers, was finally persuaded to flee from the city and thus escaped the overwhelming destruction that felt upon it.  What was the possible origin of this story?  (_Hist. Bible_ I, 87.)  What are the important religious teachings of this story?  Were great calamities in the past usually the result of wickedness?  Are they to-day?  Do people so interpret the destruction of San Francisco and Messina?  The great epidemic of cholera in Hamburg in 1892 was clearly the result of a gross neglect of sanitary precautions in regard to the water supply.  At that date the cholera germ had not been clearly identified and there was some doubt regarding the means by which the disease was spread.  Was sanitary neglect then as much of a sin as it would be now?  May we properly say that the pestilence was a calamity visited on that city as a punishment for its sin of neglect?  Why did the prophets preserve the story of the sacrifices of Isaac? Compare the parallel teaching in Micah 6:6-8.    With what shall I come before Jehovah,   Bow myself before the God on high?   Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings,   With calves a year old?   Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams,   With myriads of streams of oil?   Shall I give him my first-born for my guilt,   The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?  Which is the most important teaching of the story: the importance of an unquestioning faith and obedience, or the needlessness of human sacrifice?  Does God ever command any person to do anything that the person thinks wrong?   III.  THE PROPHETIC PORTRAIT OF ABRAHAM.  In the so-called later priestly stories regarding Abraham (see especially Gen. 17) he is portrayed as a devoted servant of the law, chiefly intent upon observing the simple ceremonial institutions revealed to him in that primitive age.  With him the later priests associated the origin of the"]]]
