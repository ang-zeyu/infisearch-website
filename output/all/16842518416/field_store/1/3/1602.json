The sun, as common, went abroad, The flowers, accustomed, blew, As if no soul the solstice passed That maketh all things new.  The time was scarce profaned by speech; The symbol of a word Was needless, as at sacrament The wardrobe of our Lord.  Each was to each the sealed church, Permitted to commune this time, Lest we too awkward show At supper of the Lamb.  The hours slid fast, as hours will, Clutched tight by greedy hands; So faces on two decks look back, Bound to opposing lands.  And so, when all the time had failed, Without external sound, Each bound the other's crucifix, We gave no other bond.  Sufficient troth that we shall rise -- Deposed, at length, the grave -- To that new marriage, justified Through Calvaries of Love!      XIV.  LOVE'S BAPTISM.  I'm ceded, I've stopped being theirs; The name they dropped upon my face With water, in the country church, Is finished using now, And they can put it with my dolls, My childhood, and the string of spools I've finished threading too.  Baptized before without the choice, But this time consciously, of grace Unto supremest name, Called to my full, the crescent dropped, Existence's whole arc filled up With one small diadem.  My second rank, too small the first, Crowned, crowing on my father's breast, A half unconscious queen; But this time, adequate, erect, With will to choose or to reject. And I choose -- just a throne.      XV.  RESURRECTION.  'T was a long parting, but the time For interview had come; Before the judgment-seat of God, The last and second time  These fleshless lovers met, A heaven in a gaze, A heaven of heavens, the privilege Of one another's eyes.  No lifetime set on them, Apparelled as the new Unborn, except they had beheld, Born everlasting now.  Was bridal e'er like this? A paradise, the host, And cherubim and seraphim The most familiar guest.      XVI.  APOCALYPSE.  I'm wife; I've finished that, That other state; I'm Czar, I'm woman now: It's safer so.  How odd the girl's life looks Behind this soft eclipse! I think that earth seems so To those in heaven now.  This being comfort, then That other kind was pain; But why compare? I'm wife! stop there!      XVII.  THE WIFE.  She rose to his requirement, dropped The playthings of her life To take the honorable work Of woman and of wife.  If aught she missed in her new day Of amplitude, or awe, Or first prospective, or the gold In using wore away,  It lay unmentioned, as the sea Develops pearl and weed, But only to himself is known The fathoms they abide.      XVIII.  APOTHEOSIS.  Come slowly, Eden! Lips unused to thee, Bashful, sip thy jasmines, As the fainting bee,  Reaching late his flower, Round her chamber hums, Counts his nectars -- enters, And is lost in balms!            III. NATURE.  I.  New feet within my garden go, New fingers stir the sod; A troubadour upon the elm Betrays the solitude.  New children play upon the green, New weary sleep below; And still the pensive spring returns, And still the punctual snow!      II.  MAY-FLOWER.  Pink, small, and punctual, Aromatic, low, Covert in April, Candid in May,  Dear to the moss, Known by the knoll, Next to the robin In every human soul.  Bold little beauty, Bedecked with thee, Nature forswears Antiquity.      III.  WHY?  The murmur of a bee A witchcraft yieldeth me. If any ask me why, 'T were easier to die Than tell.  The red upon the hill Taketh away my will; If anybody sneer, Take care, for God is here, That's all.  The breaking of the day Addeth to my degree; If any ask me how, Artist, who drew me so, Must tell!      IV.  Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower? But I could never sell. If you would like to borrow Until the daffodil  Unties her yellow bonnet Beneath the village door, Until the bees, from clover rows Their hock and sherry draw,  Why, I will lend until just then, But not an hour more!      V.  The pedigree of honey Does not concern the bee; A clover, any time, to him Is aristocracy.      VI.  A SERVICE OF SONG.  Some keep the Sabbath going to church; I keep it staying at home, With a bobolink for a chorister, And an orchard for a dome.  Some keep the Sabbath in surplice; I just wear my wings, And instead of tolling the bell for church, Our little sexton sings.  God preaches, -- a noted clergyman, -- And the sermon is never long; So instead of getting to heaven at last, I'm going all along!      VII.  The bee is not afraid of me, I know the butterfly; The pretty people in the woods Receive me cordially.  The brooks laugh louder when I come, The breezes madder play. Wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists? Wherefore, O summer's day?      VIII.  SUMMER'S ARMIES.  Some rainbow coming from the fair! Some vision of the world Cashmere I confidently see! Or else a peacock's purple train, Feather by feather, on the plain Fritters itself away!  The dreamy butterflies bestir, Lethargic pools resume the whir Of last year's sundered tune. From some old fortress on the sun Baronial bees march, one by one, In murmuring platoon!  The robins stand as thick to-day As flakes of snow stood yesterday, On fence and roof and twig. The orchis binds her feather on For her old lover, Don the Sun, Revisiting the bog!  Without commander, countless, still, The regiment of wood and hill In bright detachment stand. Behold! Whose multitudes are these? The children of whose turbaned seas, Or what Circassian land?      IX.  THE GRASS.  The grass so little has to do, -- A sphere of simple green, With only butterflies to brood, And bees to entertain,  And stir all day to pretty tunes The breezes fetch along, And hold the sunshine in its lap And bow to everything;  And thread the dews all night, like pearls, And make itself so fine, -- A duchess were too common For such a noticing.  And even when it dies, to pass In odors so divine, As lowly spices gone to sleep, Or amulets of pine.  And then to dwell in sovereign barns, And dream the days away, -- The grass so little has to do, I wish I were the hay!      X.  A little road not made of man, Enabled of the eye, Accessible to thill of bee, Or cart of butterfly.  If town it have, beyond itself, 'T is that I cannot say; I only sigh, -- no vehicle Bears me along that way.      XI.  SUMMER SHOWER.  A drop fell on the apple tree, Another on the roof; A half a dozen kissed the eaves, And made the gables laugh.  A few went out to help the brook, That went to help the sea. Myself conjectured, Were they pearls, What necklaces could be!  The dust replaced in hoisted roads, The birds jocoser sung; The sunshine threw his hat away, The orchards spangles hung.  The breezes brought dejected lutes, And bathed them in the glee; The East put out a single flag, And signed the fete away.      XII.  PSALM OF THE DAY.  A something in a summer's day, As slow her flambeaux burn away, Which solemnizes me.  A something in a summer's noon, -- An azure depth, a wordless tune, Transcending ecstasy.  And still within a summer's night A something so transporting bright, I clap my hands to see;  Then veil my too inspecting face, Lest such a subtle, shimmering grace Flutter too far for me.  The wizard-fingers never rest, The purple brook within the breast Still chafes its narrow bed;  Still rears the East her amber flag, Guides still the sun along the crag His caravan of red,  Like flowers that heard the tale of dews, But never deemed the dripping prize Awaited their low brows;  Or bees, that thought the summer's name Some rumor of delirium No summer could for them;  Or Arctic creature, dimly stirred By tropic hint, -- some travelled bird Imported to the wood;  Or wind's bright signal to the ear, Making that homely and severe, Contented, known, before  The heaven unexpected came, To lives that thought their worshipping A too presumptuous psalm.      XIII.  THE SEA OF SUNSET.  This is the land the sunset washes, These are the banks of the Yellow Sea; Where it rose, or whither it rushes, These are the western mystery!  Night after night her purple traffic Strews the landing with opal bales; Merchantmen poise upon horizons, Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.      XIV.  PURPLE CLOVER.  There is a flower that bees prefer, And butterflies desire; To gain the purple democrat The humming-birds aspire.  And whatsoever insect pass, A honey bears away Proportioned to his several dearth And her capacity.  Her face is rounder than the moon, And ruddier than the gown Of orchis in the pasture, Or rhododendron worn.  She doth not wait for June; Before the world is green Her sturdy little countenance Against the wind is seen,  Contending with the grass, Near kinsman to herself, For privilege of sod and sun, Sweet litigants for life.  And when the hills are full, And newer fashions blow, Doth not retract a single spice For pang of jealousy.  Her public is the noon, Her providence the sun, Her progress by the bee proclaimed In sovereign, swerveless tune.  The bravest of the host, Surrendering the last, Nor even of defeat aware When cancelled by the frost.      XV.  THE BEE.  Like trains of cars on tracks of plush I hear the level bee: A jar across the flowers goes, Their velvet masonry  Withstands until the sweet assault Their chivalry consumes, While he, victorious, tilts away To vanquish other blooms.  His feet are shod with gauze, His helmet is of gold; His breast, a single onyx With chrysoprase, inlaid.  His labor is a chant, His idleness a tune; Oh, for a bee's experience Of clovers and of noon!      XVI.  Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn Indicative that suns go down; The notice to the startled grass That darkness is about to pass.      XVII.  As children bid the guest good-night, And then reluctant turn, My flowers raise their pretty lips, Then put their nightgowns on.  As children caper when they wake, Merry that it is morn, My flowers from a hundred cribs Will peep, and prance again.      XVIII.  Angels in the early morning May be seen the dews among, Stooping, plucking, smiling, flying: Do the buds to them belong?  Angels when the sun is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],["title","Poems (#3)"],["body","May be seen the sands among, Stooping, plucking, sighing, flying; Parched the flowers they bear along.      XIX.  So bashful when I spied her, So pretty, so ashamed! So hidden in her leaflets, Lest anybody find;  So breathless till I passed her, So helpless when I turned And bore her, struggling, blushing, Her simple haunts beyond!  For whom I robbed the dingle, For whom betrayed the dell, Many will doubtless ask me, But I shall never tell!      XX.  TWO WORLDS.  It makes no difference abroad, The seasons fit the same, The mornings blossom into noons, And split their pods of flame.  Wild-flowers kindle in the woods, The brooks brag all the day; No blackbird bates his jargoning For passing Calvary.  Auto-da-fe and judgment Are nothing to the bee; His separation from his rose To him seems misery.      XXI.  THE MOUNTAIN.  The mountain sat upon the plain In his eternal chair, His observation omnifold, His inquest everywhere.  The seasons prayed around his knees, Like children round a sire: Grandfather of the days is he, Of dawn the ancestor.      XXII.  A DAY.  I'll tell you how the sun rose, -- A ribbon at a time. The steeples swam in amethyst, The news like squirrels ran.  The hills untied their bonnets, The bobolinks begun. Then I said softly to myself, \"That must have been the sun!\"          *  *  *  But how he set, I know not. There seemed a purple stile Which little yellow boys and girls Were climbing all the while  Till when they reached the other side, A dominie in gray Put gently up the evening bars, And led the flock away.      XXIII.  The butterfly's assumption-gown, In chrysoprase apartments hung,   This afternoon put on.  How condescending to descend, And be of buttercups the friend   In a New England town!      XXIV.  THE WIND.  Of all the sounds despatched abroad, There's not a charge to me Like that old measure in the boughs, That phraseless melody  The wind does, working like a hand Whose fingers brush the sky, Then quiver down, with tufts of tune Permitted gods and me.  When winds go round and round in bands, And thrum upon the door, And birds take places overhead, To bear them orchestra,  I crave him grace, of summer boughs, If such an outcast be, He never heard that fleshless chant Rise solemn in the tree,  As if some caravan of sound On deserts, in the sky, Had broken rank, Then knit, and passed In seamless company.      XXV.  DEATH AND LIFE.  Apparently with no surprise To any happy flower, The frost beheads it at its play In accidental power. The blond assassin passes on, The sun proceeds unmoved To measure off another day For an approving God.      XXVI.  'T WAS later when the summer went Than when the cricket came, And yet we knew that gentle clock Meant nought but going home.  'T was sooner when the cricket went Than when the winter came, Yet that pathetic pendulum Keeps esoteric time.      XXVII.  INDIAN SUMMER.  These are the days when birds come back, A very few, a bird or two, To take a backward look.  These are the days when skies put on The old, old sophistries of June, -- A blue and gold mistake.  Oh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee, Almost thy plausibility Induces my belief,  Till ranks of seeds their witness bear, And softly through the altered air Hurries a timid leaf!  Oh, sacrament of summer days, Oh, last communion in the haze, Permit a child to join,  Thy sacred emblems to partake, Thy consecrated bread to break, Taste thine immortal wine!      XXVIII.  AUTUMN.  The morns are meeker than they were, The nuts are getting brown; The berry's cheek is plumper, The rose is out of town.  The maple wears a gayer scarf, The field a scarlet gown. Lest I should be old-fashioned, I'll put a trinket on.      XXIX.  BECLOUDED.  The sky is low, the clouds are mean, A travelling flake of snow Across a barn or through a rut Debates if it will go.  A narrow wind complains all day How some one treated him; Nature, like us, is sometimes caught Without her diadem.      XXX.  THE HEMLOCK.  I think the hemlock likes to stand Upon a marge of snow; It suits his own austerity, And satisfies an awe  That men must slake in wilderness, Or in the desert cloy, -- An instinct for the hoar, the bald, Lapland's necessity.  The hemlock's nature thrives on cold; The gnash of northern winds Is sweetest nutriment to him, His best Norwegian wines.  To satin races he is nought; But children on the Don Beneath his tabernacles play, And Dnieper wrestlers run.      XXXI.  There's a certain slant of light, On winter afternoons, That oppresses, like the weight Of cathedral tunes.  Heavenly hurt it gives us; We can find no scar, But internal difference Where the meanings are.  None may teach it anything, 'T is the seal, despair, -- An imperial affliction Sent us of the air.  When it comes, the landscape listens, Shadows hold their breath; When it goes, 't is like the distance On the look of death.       IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.  I.  One dignity delays for all, One mitred afternoon. None can avoid this purple, None evade this crown.  Coach it insures, and footmen, Chamber and state and throng; Bells, also, in the village, As we ride grand along.  What dignified attendants, What service when we pause! How loyally at parting Their hundred hats they raise!  How pomp surpassing ermine, When simple you and I Present our meek escutcheon, And claim the rank to die!      II.  TOO LATE.  Delayed till she had ceased to know, Delayed till in its vest of snow    Her loving bosom lay. An hour behind the fleeting breath, Later by just an hour than death, --    Oh, lagging yesterday!  Could she have guessed that it would be; Could but a crier of the glee    Have climbed the distant hill; Had not the bliss so slow a pace, -- Who knows but this surrendered face    Were undefeated still?  Oh, if there may departing be Any forgot by victory    In her imperial round, Show them this meek apparelled thing, That could not stop to be a king,    Doubtful if it be crowned!      III.  ASTRA CASTRA.  Departed to the judgment, A mighty afternoon; Great clouds like ushers leaning, Creation looking on.  The flesh surrendered, cancelled, The bodiless begun; Two worlds, like audiences, disperse And leave the soul alone.      IV.  Safe in their alabaster chambers, Untouched by morning and untouched by noon, Sleep the meek members of the resurrection, Rafter of satin, and roof of stone.  Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine; Babbles the bee in a stolid ear; Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence, -- Ah, what sagacity perished here!  Grand go the years in the crescent above them; Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row, Diadems drop and Doges surrender, Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.      V.  On this long storm the rainbow rose, On this late morn the sun; The clouds, like listless elephants, Horizons straggled down.  The birds rose smiling in their nests, The gales indeed were done; Alas! how heedless were the eyes On whom the summer shone!  The quiet nonchalance of death No daybreak can bestir; The slow archangel's syllables Must awaken her.      VI.  FROM THE CHRYSALIS.  My cocoon tightens, colors tease, I'm feeling for the air; A dim capacity for wings Degrades the dress I wear.  A power of butterfly must be The aptitude to fly, Meadows of majesty concedes And easy sweeps of sky.  So I must baffle at the hint And cipher at the sign, And make much blunder, if at last I take the clew divine.      VII.  SETTING SAIL.  Exultation is the going Of an inland soul to sea, -- Past the houses, past the headlands, Into deep eternity!  Bred as we, among the mountains, Can the sailor understand The divine intoxication Of the first league out from land?      VIII.  Look back on time with kindly eyes, He doubtless did his best; How softly sinks his trembling sun In human nature's west!      IX.  A train went through a burial gate, A bird broke forth and sang, And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat Till all the churchyard rang;  And then adjusted his little notes, And bowed and sang again. Doubtless, he thought it meet of him To say good-by to men.      X.  I died for beauty, but was scarce Adjusted in the tomb, When one who died for truth was lain In an adjoining room.  He questioned softly why I failed? \"For beauty,\" I replied. \"And I for truth, -- the two are one; We brethren are,\" he said.  And so, as kinsmen met a night, We talked between the rooms, Until the moss had reached our lips, And covered up our names.      XI.  \"TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS.\"  How many times these low feet staggered, Only the soldered mouth can tell; Try! can you stir the awful rivet? Try! can you lift the hasps of steel?  Stroke the cool forehead, hot so often, Lift, if you can, the listless hair; Handle the adamantine fingers Never a thimble more shall wear.  Buzz the dull flies on the chamber window; Brave shines the sun through the freckled pane; Fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling -- Indolent housewife, in daisies lain!      XII.  REAL.  I like a look of agony, Because I know it 's true; Men do not sham convulsion, Nor simulate a throe.  The eyes glaze once, and that is death. Impossible to feign The beads upon the forehead By homely anguish strung.      XIII.  THE FUNERAL.  That short, potential stir That each can make but once, That bustle so illustrious 'T is almost consequence,  Is the eclat of death. Oh, thou unknown renown That not a beggar would accept, Had he the power to spurn!      XIV.  I went to thank her, But she slept; Her bed a funnelled stone, With nosegays at the head and foot, That travellers had thrown,  Who went to thank her; But she slept. 'T was short to cross the sea To look upon her like, alive, But turning back 't was slow.      XV.  I've seen a dying eye Run round and round a room In search of something, as it seemed, Then cloudier become; And then, obscure with fog, And then be soldered down, Without disclosing what it be, 'T were blessed to have seen.      XVI.  REFUGE.  The clouds their backs together laid, "]]]
