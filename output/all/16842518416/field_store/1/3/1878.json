Challenger, Lord John Roxton,   Prof. Summerlee, and Mr. E. D. Malone,   the discoverers of \"The Lost World\"    TABLE OF CONTENTS  Chapter     I  THE BLURRING OF LINES   II  THE TIDE OF DEATH  III  SUBMERGED   IV  A DIARY OF THE DYING    V  THE DEAD WORLD   VI  THE GREAT AWAKENING     Chapter I  THE BLURRING OF LINES   It is imperative that now at once, while these stupendous events are still clear in my mind, I should set them down with that exactness of detail which time may blur.  But even as I do so, I am overwhelmed by the wonder of the fact that it should be our little group of the \"Lost World\"--Professor Challenger, Professor Summerlee, Lord John Roxton, and myself--who have passed through this amazing experience.  When, some years ago, I chronicled in the Daily Gazette our epoch-making journey in South America, I little thought that it should ever fall to my lot to tell an even stranger personal experience, one which is unique in all human annals and must stand out in the records of history as a great peak among the humble foothills which surround it.  The event itself will always be marvellous, but the circumstances that we four were together at the time of this extraordinary episode came about in a most natural and, indeed, inevitable fashion.  I will explain the events which led up to it as shortly and as clearly as I can, though I am well aware that the fuller the detail upon such a subject the more welcome it will be to the reader, for the public curiosity has been and still is insatiable.  It was upon Friday, the twenty-seventh of August--a date forever memorable in the history of the world--that I went down to the office of my paper and asked for three days' leave of absence from Mr. McArdle, who still presided over our news department.  The good old Scotchman shook his head, scratched his dwindling fringe of ruddy fluff, and finally put his reluctance into words.  \"I was thinking, Mr. Malone, that we could employ you to advantage these days.  I was thinking there was a story that you are the only man that could handle as it should be handled.\"  \"I am sorry for that,\" said I, trying to hide my disappointment.  \"Of course if I am needed, there is an end of the matter.  But the engagement was important and intimate.  If I could be spared----\"  \"Well, I don't see that you can.\"  It was bitter, but I had to put the best face I could upon it.  After all, it was my own fault, for I should have known by this time that a journalist has no right to make plans of his own.  \"Then I'll think no more of it,\" said I with as much cheerfulness as I could assume at so short a notice.  \"What was it that you wanted me to do?\"  \"Well, it was just to interview that deevil of a man down at Rotherfield.\"  \"You don't mean Professor Challenger?\" I cried.  \"Aye, it's just him that I do mean.  He ran young Alec Simpson of the Courier a mile down the high road last week by the collar of his coat and the slack of his breeches.  You'll have read of it, likely, in the police report.  Our boys would as soon interview a loose alligator in the zoo. But you could do it, I'm thinking--an old friend like you.\"  \"Why,\" said I, greatly relieved, \"this makes it all easy.  It so happens that it was to visit Professor Challenger at Rotherfield that I was asking for leave of absence.  The fact is, that it is the anniversary of our main adventure on the plateau three years ago, and he has asked our whole party down to his house to see him and celebrate the occasion.\"  \"Capital!\" cried McArdle, rubbing his hands and beaming through his glasses.  \"Then you will be able to get his opeenions out of him.  In any other man I would say it was all moonshine, but the fellow has made good once, and who knows but he may again!\"  \"Get what out of him?\" I asked.  \"What has he been doing?\"  \"Haven't you seen his letter on 'Scientific Possibeelities' in to-day's Times?\"  \"No.\"  McArdle dived down and picked a copy from the floor.  \"Read it aloud,\" said he, indicating a column with his finger.  \"I'd be glad to hear it again, for I am not sure now that I have the man's meaning clear in my head.\"  This was the letter which I read to the news editor of the Gazette:--   \"SCIENTIFIC POSSIBILITIES\"  \"Sir,--I have read with amusement, not wholly unmixed with some less complimentary emotion, the complacent and wholly fatuous letter of James Wilson MacPhail which has lately appeared in your columns upon the subject of the blurring of Fraunhofer's lines in the spectra both of the planets and of the fixed stars.  He dismisses the matter as of no significance.  To a wider intelligence it may well seem of very great possible importance--so great as to involve the ultimate welfare of every man, woman, and child upon this planet.  I can hardly hope, by the use of scientific language, to convey any sense of my meaning to those ineffectual people who gather their ideas from the columns of a daily newspaper.  I will endeavour, therefore, to condescend to their limitation and to indicate the situation by the use of a homely analogy which will be within the limits of the intelligence of your readers.\"   \"Man, he's a wonder--a living wonder!\" said McArdle, shaking his head reflectively.  \"He'd put up the feathers of a sucking-dove and set up a riot in a Quakers' meeting.  No wonder he has made London too hot for him.  It's a peety, Mr. Malone, for it's a grand brain!  We'll let's have the analogy.\"  \"We will suppose,\" I read, \"that a small bundle of connected corks was launched in a sluggish current upon a voyage across the Atlantic.  The corks drift slowly on from day to day with the same conditions all round them.  If the corks were sentient we could imagine that they would consider these conditions to be permanent and assured.  But we, with our superior knowledge, know that many things might happen to surprise the corks.  They might possibly float up against a ship, or a sleeping whale, or become entangled in seaweed.  In any case, their voyage would probably end by their being thrown up on the rocky coast of Labrador.  But what could they know of all this while they drifted so gently day by day in what they thought was a limitless and homogeneous ocean?  \"Your readers will possibly comprehend that the Atlantic, in this parable, stands for the mighty ocean of ether through which we drift and that the bunch of corks represents the little and obscure planetary system to which we belong.  A third-rate sun, with its rag tag and bobtail of insignificant satellites, we float under the same daily conditions towards some unknown end, some squalid catastrophe which will overwhelm us at the ultimate confines of space, where we are swept over an etheric Niagara or dashed upon some unthinkable Labrador.  I see no room here for the shallow and ignorant optimism of your correspondent, Mr. James Wilson MacPhail, but many reasons why we should watch with a very close and interested attention every indication of change in those cosmic surroundings upon which our own ultimate fate may depend.\"  \"Man, he'd have made a grand meenister,\" said McArdle.  \"It just booms like an organ.  Let's get doun to what it is that's troubling him.\"  \"The general blurring and shifting of Fraunhofer's lines of the spectrum point, in my opinion, to a widespread cosmic change of a subtle and singular character.  Light from a planet is the reflected light of the sun.  Light from a star is a self-produced light.  But the spectra both from planets and stars have, in this instance, all undergone the same change.  Is it, then, a change in those planets and stars?  To me such an idea is inconceivable.  What common change could simultaneously come upon them all?  Is it a change in our own atmosphere?  It is possible, but in the highest degree improbable, since we see no signs of it around us, and chemical analysis has failed to reveal it.  What, then, is the third possibility?  That it may be a change in the conducting medium, in that infinitely fine ether which extends from star to star and pervades the whole universe.  Deep in that ocean we are floating upon a slow current. Might that current not drift us into belts of ether which are novel and have properties of which we have never conceived?  There is a change somewhere.  This cosmic disturbance of the spectrum proves it.  It may be a good change.  It may be an evil one.  It may be a neutral one.  We do not know.  Shallow observers may treat the matter as one which can be disregarded, but one who like myself is possessed of the deeper intelligence of the true philosopher will understand that the possibilities of the universe are incalculable and that the wisest man is he who holds himself ready for the unexpected.  To take an obvious example, who would undertake to say that the mysterious and universal outbreak of illness, recorded in your columns this very morning as having broken out among the indigenous races of Sumatra, has no connection with some cosmic change to which they may respond more quickly than the more complex peoples of Europe?  I throw out the idea for what it is worth. To assert it is, in the present stage, as unprofitable as to deny it, but it is an unimaginative numskull who is too dense to perceive that it is well within the bounds of scientific possibility.          \"Yours faithfully,              \"GEORGE EDWARD CHALLENGER.  \"THE BRIARS, ROTHERFIELD.\"   \"It's a fine, steemulating letter,\" said McArdle thoughtfully, fitting a cigarette into the long glass tube which he used as a holder.  \"What's your opeenion of it, Mr. Malone?\"  I had to confess my total and humiliating ignorance of the subject at issue.  What, for example, were Fraunhofer's lines?  McArdle had just been studying the matter with the aid of our tame scientist at the office, and he picked from his desk two of those many-coloured spectral bands which bear a general"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/126"],["title","The Poison Belt (#1)"],["body","to the hat-ribbons of some young and ambitious cricket club.  He pointed out to me that there were certain black lines which formed crossbars upon the series of brilliant colours extending from the red at one end through gradations of orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo to the violet at the other.  \"Those dark bands are Fraunhofer's lines,\" said he.  \"The colours are just light itself.  Every light, if you can split it up with a prism, gives the same colours.  They tell us nothing.  It is the lines that count, because they vary according to what it may be that produces the light.  It is these lines that have been blurred instead of clear this last week, and all the astronomers have been quarreling over the reason. Here's a photograph of the blurred lines for our issue to-morrow.  The public have taken no interest in the matter up to now, but this letter of Challenger's in the Times will make them wake up, I'm thinking.\"  \"And this about Sumatra?\"  \"Well, it's a long cry from a blurred line in a spectrum to a sick nigger in Sumatra.  And yet the chiel has shown us once before that he knows what he's talking about.  There is some queer illness down yonder, that's beyond all doubt, and to-day there's a cable just come in from Singapore that the lighthouses are out of action in the Straits of Sundan, and two ships on the beach in consequence.  Anyhow, it's good enough for you to interview Challenger upon.  If you get anything definite, let us have a column by Monday.\"  I was coming out from the news editor's room, turning over my new mission in my mind, when I heard my name called from the waiting-room below.  It was a telegraph-boy with a wire which had been forwarded from my lodgings at Streatham.  The message was from the very man we had been discussing, and ran thus:--  Malone, 17, Hill Street, Streatham.--Bring oxygen.--Challenger.  \"Bring oxygen!\"  The Professor, as I remembered him, had an elephantine sense of humour capable of the most clumsy and unwieldly gambollings. Was this one of those jokes which used to reduce him to uproarious laughter, when his eyes would disappear and he was all gaping mouth and wagging beard, supremely indifferent to the gravity of all around him?  I turned the words over, but could make nothing even remotely jocose out of them.  Then surely it was a concise order--though a very strange one.  He was the last man in the world whose deliberate command I should care to disobey.  Possibly some chemical experiment was afoot; possibly----Well, it was no business of mine to speculate upon why he wanted it.  I must get it.  There was nearly an hour before I should catch the train at Victoria.  I took a taxi, and having ascertained the address from the telephone book, I made for the Oxygen Tube Supply Company in Oxford Street.  As I alighted on the pavement at my destination, two youths emerged from the door of the establishment carrying an iron cylinder, which, with some trouble, they hoisted into a waiting motor-car.  An elderly man was at their heels scolding and directing in a creaky, sardonic voice.  He turned towards me.  There was no mistaking those austere features and that goatee beard.  It was my old cross-grained companion, Professor Summerlee.  \"What!\" he cried.  \"Don't tell me that _you_ have had one of these preposterous telegrams for oxygen?\"  I exhibited it.  \"Well, well!  I have had one too, and, as you see, very much against the grain, I have acted upon it.  Our good friend is as impossible as ever. The need for oxygen could not have been so urgent that he must desert the usual means of supply and encroach upon the time of those who are really busier than himself.  Why could he not order it direct?\"  I could only suggest that he probably wanted it at once.  \"Or thought he did, which is quite another matter.  But it is superfluous now for you to purchase any, since I have this considerable supply.\"  \"Still, for some reason he seems to wish that I should bring oxygen too. It will be safer to do exactly what he tells me.\"  Accordingly, in spite of many grumbles and remonstrances from Summerlee, I ordered an additional tube, which was placed with the other in his motor-car, for he had offered me a lift to Victoria.  I turned away to pay off my taxi, the driver of which was very cantankerous and abusive over his fare.  As I came back to Professor Summerlee, he was having a furious altercation with the men who had carried down the oxygen, his little white goat's beard jerking with indignation.  One of the fellows called him, I remember, \"a silly old bleached cockatoo,\" which so enraged his chauffeur that he bounded out of his seat to take the part of his insulted master, and it was all we could do to prevent a riot in the street.  These little things may seem trivial to relate, and passed as mere incidents at the time.  It is only now, as I look back, that I see their relation to the whole story which I have to unfold.  The chauffeur must, as it seemed to me, have been a novice or else have lost his nerve in this disturbance, for he drove vilely on the way to the station.  Twice we nearly had collisions with other equally erratic vehicles, and I remember remarking to Summerlee that the standard of driving in London had very much declined.  Once we brushed the very edge of a great crowd which was watching a fight at the corner of the Mall. The people, who were much excited, raised cries of anger at the clumsy driving, and one fellow sprang upon the step and waved a stick above our heads.  I pushed him off, but we were glad when we had got clear of them and safe out of the park.  These little events, coming one after the other, left me very jangled in my nerves, and I could see from my companion's petulant manner that his own patience had got to a low ebb.  But our good humour was restored when we saw Lord John Roxton waiting for us upon the platform, his tall, thin figure clad in a yellow tweed shooting-suit.  His keen face, with those unforgettable eyes, so fierce and yet so humorous, flushed with pleasure at the sight of us.  His ruddy hair was shot with grey, and the furrows upon his brow had been cut a little deeper by Time's chisel, but in all else he was the Lord John who had been our good comrade in the past.  \"Hullo, Herr Professor!  Hullo, young fella!\" he shouted as he came toward us.  He roared with amusement when he saw the oxygen cylinders upon the porter's trolly behind us.  \"So you've got them too!\" he cried.  \"Mine is in the van.  Whatever can the old dear be after?\"  \"Have you seen his letter in the Times?\" I asked.  \"What was it?\"  \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Summerlee harshly.  \"Well, it's at the bottom of this oxygen business, or I am mistaken,\" said I.  \"Stuff and nonsense!\" cried Summerlee again with quite unnecessary violence.  We had all got into a first-class smoker, and he had already lit the short and charred old briar pipe which seemed to singe the end of his long, aggressive nose.  \"Friend Challenger is a clever man,\" said he with great vehemence.  \"No one can deny it.  It's a fool that denies it.  Look at his hat.  There's a sixty-ounce brain inside it--a big engine, running smooth, and turning out clean work.  Show me the engine-house and I'll tell you the size of the engine.  But he is a born charlatan--you've heard me tell him so to his face--a born charlatan, with a kind of dramatic trick of jumping into the limelight.  Things are quiet, so friend Challenger sees a chance to set the public talking about him.  You don't imagine that he seriously believes all this nonsense about a change in the ether and a danger to the human race?  Was ever such a cock-and-bull story in this life?\"  He sat like an old white raven, croaking and shaking with sardonic laughter.  A wave of anger passed through me as I listened to Summerlee.  It was disgraceful that he should speak thus of the leader who had been the source of all our fame and given us such an experience as no men have ever enjoyed.  I had opened my mouth to utter some hot retort, when Lord John got before me.  \"You had a scrap once before with old man Challenger,\" said he sternly, \"and you were down and out inside ten seconds.  It seems to me, Professor Summerlee, he's beyond your class, and the best you can do with him is to walk wide and leave him alone.\"  \"Besides,\" said I, \"he has been a good friend to every one of us. Whatever his faults may be, he is as straight as a line, and I don't believe he ever speaks evil of his comrades behind their backs.\"  \"Well said, young fellah-my-lad,\" said Lord John Roxton.  Then, with a kindly smile, he slapped Professor Summerlee upon his shoulder.  \"Come, Herr Professor, we're not going to quarrel at this time of day.  We've seen too much together.  But keep off the grass when you get near Challenger, for this young fellah and I have a bit of a weakness for the old dear.\"  But Summerlee was in no humour for compromise.  His face was screwed up in rigid disapproval, and thick curls of angry smoke rolled up from his pipe.  \"As to you, Lord John Roxton,\" he creaked, \"your opinion upon a matter of science is of as much value in my eyes as my views upon a new type of shot-gun would be in yours.  I have my own judgment, sir, and I use it in my own way.  Because it has misled me once, is that any reason why I should accept without criticism anything, however far-fetched, which this man may care to put forward?  Are we to have a Pope of science, with infallible decrees laid down _ex cathedra_, and accepted without question by the poor humble public?  I tell you, sir, that I have a brain of my own and that I should feel myself to be a snob and a slave if I did not use it.  If it pleases you to believe this rigmarole about ether and Fraunhofer's lines upon the spectrum, do so by all means, but do not ask one who is older and wiser than yourself to share in your folly.  Is it not evident that if the ether were affected to the degree which he maintains, and if"]]]
