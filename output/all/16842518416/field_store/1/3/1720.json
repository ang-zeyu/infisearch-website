As a matter of fact, it is much more important to be taught how to drive than how to ride. A horse in front of a vehicle can do all the mean things a horse under a saddle can do, and more; and it is far more difficult to handle an animal in shafts by means of long reins and a whip.  If people knew half as much about horses as they think they do, there would be no mishaps; if horses were half as nervous as they are supposed to be, the accidents would be innumerable.  The truth is, the horse does very well if managed with a little common sense, skill, and coolness.  As a matter of law, the automobile is a vehicle, and has precisely the same rights on the highway that a bicycle or a carriage has. The horse has no monopoly of the highway, it enjoys no especial privileges, but must share the road with all other vehicles. Furthermore, the law makes it the business of the horse to get accustomed to strange sights and behave itself This duty has been onerous the last few years; the bicycle, the traction engine, and the trolley have come along in quick succession; the automobile is about the last straw.  Until the horse is accustomed to the machine, it is the duty--by law and common sense--of the automobile driver to take great care in passing; the care being measured by the possibility and probability of at accident.  The sympathy of every chauffeur must be entirely with the driver of the horse. Automobiles are not so numerous in this country that they may be looked for at every turn, and one cannot but feel for the man or woman who, while driving, sees one coming down the road. The best of drivers feel panicky, while women and children are terror-stricken.  It is no uncommon sight to see people jump out of their carriages or drive into fields or lanes, anywhere, to get out of the way. In localities where machines have been driven recklessly, men and women, though dressed in their best, frequently jump out in the mud as soon as an automobile comes in sight, and long before the chauffeur has an opportunity to show that he will exercise caution in approaching. All this is wrong and creates an amount of ill-feeling hard to overcome.  If one is driving along a fine road at twenty or thirty miles an hour, it is, of course, a relief to see coming vehicles turn in somewhere; but it ought not to be necessary for them to do so. Often people like to turn to one side for the sake of seeing the machine go by at full speed; but if they do not wish to, the automobile should be so driven as to pass with safety.  On country roads there is but one way to pass horses without risk, and that is let the horses pass the machine.  In cities horses give very little trouble; in the country they give no end of trouble; they are a very great drawback to the pleasure of automobiling. Horses that behave well in the city are often the very worst in the country, so susceptible is the animal to environment.  On narrow country roads three out of five will behave badly, and unless the outward signs are unmistakable, it is never safe to assume one is meeting an old plug,--even the plug sometimes jumps the ditch.  The safe, the prudent, the courteous thing to do is to stop and let the driver drive or lead his horse by; if a child or woman is driving, get out and lead the horse.  By stopping the machine most horses can be gotten by without much trouble. Even though the driver motions to come on, it is seldom safe to do so; for of all horses the one that is brought to a stand-still in front of a machine is surest to shy, turn, or bolt when the machine starts up to pass. If one is going to pass a horse without stopping, it is safer to do so quickly,--the more quickly the better; but that is taking great chances.  Whenever a horse, whether driven or hitched, shows fright, a loud, sharp \"Whoa!\" from the chauffeur will steady the animal. The voice from the machine, if sharp and peremptory, is much more effective than any amount of talking from the carriage.  Much of the prejudice against automobiles is due to the fact that machines are driven with entire disregard for the feelings and rights of horse owners; in short, the highway is monopolized to the exclusion of the public. The prejudice thus created is manifested in many ways that are disagreeable to the chauffeur and his friends.  The trouble is not in excessive speed, and speed ordinances will not remedy the trouble. A machine may be driven as recklessly at ten or twelve miles an hour as at thirty. In a given distance more horses can be frightened by a slow machine than a fast. It is all in the manner of driving.  Speed is a matter of temperament. In England, the people and local boards cannot adopt measures stringent enough to prevent speeding; in Ireland, the people and local authorities line the highways, urging the chauffeur to let his machine out; in America, we are suspended between English prudence and repression on the one side and Irish impulsiveness and recklessness on the other.  The Englishman will not budge; the Irishman cries, \"Let her go.\"  Speaking of the future of the automobile, the Professor said,--  \"Cupid will never use the automobile, the little god is too conservative; fancy the dainty sprite with oil-can and waste instead of bow and arrow. I can see him with smut on the end of his mischievous nose and grease on the seat of the place where his trousers ought to be. What a picture he would make in overalls and jumper, leather jacket and cap; he could not use dart or arrow, at best he could only run the machine hither and thither bunting people into love--knocking them senseless, which is perhaps the same thing. No, no, Cupid will never use the automobile. Imagine Aphrodite in goggles, clothed in dust, her fair skin red from sunburn and glistening with cold cream; horrible nightmare of a mechanical age, avaunt!  \"The chariots of High Olympus were never greased, they used no gasoline, the clouds we see about them are condensed zephyrs and not dust. Omniscient Jove never used a monkey-wrench, never sought the elusive spark, never blew up a four-inch tire with a half-inch pump. Even if the automobile could surmount the grades, it would never be popular on Olympian heights. Mercury might use it to visit Vulcan, but he would never go far from the shop.  \"As for conditions here on earth, why should a young woman go riding with a man whose hands, arms, and attention are entirely taken up with wheels, levers, and oil-cups? He can't even press her foot without running the risk of stopping the machine by releasing some clutch; if he moves his knees a hair's-breadth in her direction it does something to the mechanism; if he looks her way they are into the ditch; if she attempts to kiss him his goggles prevent; his sighs are lost in the muffler and hers in the exhaust; nothing but dire disaster will bring an automobile courtship to a happy termination; as long as the machine goes love-making is quite out of the question.  \"Dobbin, dear old secretive Dobbin, what difference does it make to you whether you feel the guiding hand or not? You know when the courtship begins, the brisk drives about town to all points of interest, to the pond, the poorhouse, and the cemetery; you know how the courtship progresses, the long drives in the country, the idling along untravelled roads and woodland ways, the moonlight nights and misty meadows; you know when your stops to nibble by the wayside will not be noticed, and you alone know when it is time to get the young couple home; you know, alas! when the courtship--blissful period of loitering for you--is ended and when the marriage is made, by the tighter rein, the sharper word, and the occasional swish of the whip. Ah, Dobbin, you and I--\" The Professor was becoming indiscreet.  \"What do you know about love-making, Professor?\"  \"My dear fellow, it is the province of learning to know everything and practise nothing.\"  \"But Dobbin--\"  \"We all have had our Dobbins.\"  For some miles the road out of Erie was soft, dusty, narrow, and poor--by no means fit for the proposed Erie-Buffalo race. About fifteen miles out there is a sharp turn to the left and down a steep incline with a ravine and stream below on the right,--a dangerous turn at twenty miles an hour, to say nothing of forty or fifty.  There is nothing to indicate that the road drops so suddenly after making the turn, and we were bowling along at top speed; a wagon coming around the corner threw us well to the outside, so that the margin of safety was reduced to a minimum, even if the turn were an easy one.  As we swung around the corner well over to the edge of the ravine, we saw the grade we had to make. Nothing but a succession of small rain gullies in the road saved us from going down the bank. By so steering as to drop the skidding wheels on the outside into each gully, the sliding of the machine received a series of violent checks and we missed the brink of the ravine by a few inches.  A layman in the Professor's place would have jumped; but he, good man, looked upon his escape as one of the incidents of automobile travel.  \"When I accepted your invitation, my dear fellow, I expected something beyond the ordinary. I have not been disappointed.\"  It was a wonder the driving-wheels were not dished by the violent side strains, but they were not even sprung. These wheels were of wire tangential spokes; they do not look so well as the smart, heavy, substantial wooden wheels one sees on nearly all imported machines and on some American.  The sense of proportion between parts is sadly outraged by spindle-wire wheels supporting the massive frame-work and body of an automobile; however strong they may be in reality, architecturally they are quite unfit, and no doubt the wooden wheel will come more and more into general use.

By Herman Melville.    1866.     The Battle-Pieces in this volume are dedicated to the memory of the THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND who in the war for the maintenance of the Union fell devotedly under the flag of their fathers.    [With few exceptions, the Pieces in this volume originated in an impulse imparted by the fall of Richmond. They were composed without reference to collective arrangement, but being brought together in review, naturally fall into the order assumed.  The events and incidents of the conflict--making up a whole, in varied amplitude, corresponding with the geographical area covered by the war--from these but a few themes have been taken, such as for any cause chanced to imprint themselves upon the mind.  The aspects which the strife as a memory assumes are as manifold as are the moods of involuntary meditation--moods variable, and at times widely at variance. Yielding instinctively, one after another, to feelings not inspired from any one source exclusively, and unmindful, without purposing to be, of consistency, I seem, in most of these verses, to have but placed a harp in a window, and noted the contrasted airs which wayward wilds have played upon the strings.]    The Portent. (1859.)   Hanging from the beam,   Slowly swaying (such the law), Gaunt the shadow on your green,   Shenandoah! The cut is on the crown (Lo, John Brown), And the stabs shall heal no more.  Hidden in the cap   Is the anguish none can draw; So your future veils its face,   Shenandoah! But the streaming beard is shown (Weird John Brown), The meteor of the the war.    Misgivings. (1860.)     When ocean-clouds over inland hills     Sweep storming in late autumn brown,   And horror the sodden valley fills,     And the spire falls crashing in the town,   I muse upon my country’s ills--   The tempest bursting from the waste of Time On the world’s fairest hope linked with man’s foulest crime.    Nature’s dark side is heeded now--     (Ah! optimist-cheer disheartened flown)--   A child may read the moody brow     Of yon black mountain lone.   With shouts the torrents down the gorges go,   And storms are formed behind the storm we feel: The hemlock shakes in the rafter, the oak in the driving keel.    The Conflict of Convictions.[1] (1860-1.)   On starry heights   A bugle wails the long recall; Derision stirs the deep abyss,   Heaven’s ominous silence over all. Return, return, O eager Hope,   And face man’s latter fall. Events, they make the dreamers quail; Satan’s old age is strong and hale, A disciplined captain, gray in skill, And Raphael a white enthusiast still; Dashed aims, at which Christ’s martyrs pale, Shall Mammon’s slaves fulfill?      (_Dismantle the fort,     Cut down the fleet--     Battle no more shall be!     While the fields for fight in æons to come     Congeal beneath the sea._)  The terrors of truth and dart of death   To faith alike are vain; Though comets, gone a thousand years,     Return again, Patient she stands--she can no more-- And waits, nor heeds she waxes hoar.      (_At a stony gate,     A statue of stone,     Weed overgrown--     Long ’twill wait!_)  But God his former mind retains,   Confirms his old decree; The generations are inured to pains,   And strong Necessity Surges, and heaps Time’s strand with wrecks.   The People spread like a weedy grass,   The thing they will they bring to pass, And prosper to the apoplex. The rout it herds around the heart,   The ghost is yielded in the gloom; Kings wag their heads--Now save thyself   Who wouldst rebuild the world in bloom.      (_Tide-mark     And top of the ages’ strike,     Verge where they called the world to come,     The last advance of life--     Ha ha, the rust on the Iron Dome!_)  Nay, but revere the hid event;   In the cloud a sword is girded on, I mark a twinkling in the tent   Of Michael the warrior one. Senior wisdom suits not now, The light is on the youthful brow.      (_Ay, in caves the miner see:     His forehead bears a blinking light;     Darkness so he feebly braves--     A meagre wight!_)  But He who rules is old--is old; Ah! faith is warm, but heaven with age is cold.      (_Ho ho, ho ho,     The cloistered doubt     Of olden times     Is blurted out!_)  The Ancient of Days forever is young,   Forever the scheme of Nature thrives; I know a wind in purpose strong--   It spins _against_ the way it drives. What if the gulfs their slimed foundations bare? So deep must the stones be hurled Whereon the throes of ages rear The final empire and the happier world.      (_The poor old Past,     The Future’s slave,     She drudged through pain and crime     To bring about the blissful Prime,     Then--perished. There’s a grave!_)    Power unanointed may come-- Dominion (unsought by the free)   And the Iron Dome, Stronger for stress and strain, Fling her huge shadow athwart the main; But the Founders’ dream shall flee. Agee after age shall be As age after age has been, (From man’s changeless heart their way they win);  And death be busy with all who strive-- Death, with silent negative.      YEA, AND NAY--     EACH HATH HIS SAY;     BUT GOD HE KEEPS THE MIDDLE WAY.     NONE WAS BY     WHEN HE SPREAD THE SKY;     WISDOM IS VAIN, AND PROPHESY.    Apathy and Enthusiasm. (1860-1.)   I  O the clammy cold November,   And the winter white and dead, And the terror dumb with stupor,   And the sky a sheet of lead; And events that came resounding   With the cry that _All was lost_, Like the thunder-cracks of massy ice   In intensity of frost-- Bursting one upon another   Through the horror of the calm.   The paralysis of arm In the anguish of the heart; And the hollowness and dearth.   The appealings of the mother   To brother and to brother Not in hatred so to part-- And the fissure in the hearth   Growing momently more wide. Then the glances ’tween the Fates,   And the doubt on every side, And the patience under gloom In the stoniness that waits The finality of doom.   II  So the winter died despairing,   And the weary weeks of Lent; And the ice-bound rivers melted,   And the tomb of Faith was rent. O, the rising of the People   Came with springing of the grass, They rebounded from dejection   And Easter came to pass. And the young were all elation   Hearing Sumter’s cannon roar, And they thought how tame the Nation   In the age that went before. And Michael seemed gigantical,   The Arch-fiend but a dwarf; And at the towers of Erebus   Our striplings flung the scoff. But the elders with foreboding   Mourned the days forever o’er, And re called the forest proverb,   The Iroquois’ old saw: _Grief to every graybeard   When young Indians lead the war._    The March into Virginia, Ending in the First Manassas. (July, 1861.)   Did all the lets and bars appear   To every just or larger end, Whence should come the trust and cheer?   Youth must its ignorant impulse lend-- Age finds place in the rear.   All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys, The champions and enthusiasts of the state:   Turbid ardors and vain joys     Not barrenly abate--   Stimulants to the power mature,     Preparatives of fate.  Who here forecasteth the event? What heart but spurns at precedent And warnings of the wise, Contemned foreclosures of surprise?  The banners play, the bugles call, The air is blue and prodigal.   No berrying party, pleasure-wooed, No picnic party in the May, Ever went less loth than they   Into that leafy neighborhood. In Bacchic glee they file toward Fate, Moloch’s uninitiate; Expectancy, and glad surmise Of battle’s unknown mysteries. All they feel is this: ’tis glory, A rapture sharp, though transitory, Yet lasting in belaureled story. So they gayly go to fight, Chatting left and laughing right.  But some who this blithe mood present,   As on in lightsome files they fare, Shall die experienced ere three days are spent--   Perish, enlightened by the vollied glare; Or shame survive, and, like to adamant,   The throe of Second Manassas share.    Lyon. Battle of Springfield, Missouri. (August, 1861.)   Some hearts there are of deeper sort,     Prophetic, sad, Which yet for cause are trebly clad;     Known death they fly on: This wizard-heart and heart-of-oak had Lyon.  “They are more than twenty thousand strong,     We less than five, Too few with such a host to strive”     “Such counsel, fie on! ’Tis battle, or ’tis shame;” and firm stood Lyon.  “For help at need in van we wait--     Retreat or fight: Retreat the foe would take for flight,     And each proud scion Feel more elate; the end must come,” said Lyon.  By candlelight he wrote the will,     And left his all To Her for whom ’twas not enough to fall;     Loud neighed Orion Without the tent; drums beat; we marched with Lyon.  The night-tramp done, we spied the Vale     With guard-fires lit; Day broke, but trooping clouds made gloom of it:     “A field to die on” Presaged in his unfaltering heart, brave Lyon.  We fought on the grass, we bled in the corn--     Fate seemed malign; His horse the Leader led along the line--     Star-browed Orion; Bitterly fearless, he rallied us there, brave Lyon.  There came a sound like the slitting of air     By a swift sharp sword-- A rush of the sound; and the sleek chest broad     Of black Orion Heaved, and was fixed; the dead mane waved toward Lyon.  “General, you’re hurt--this sleet of balls!”     He seemed half spent; With moody and bloody brow, he lowly bent:     “The field to die on; But not--not yet; the day is long,” breathed Lyon.  For a time becharmed there fell a lull     In the heart of the fight; The tree-tops nod, the slain sleep light;     Warm noon-winds sigh on, And thoughts which he never spake had Lyon.  Texans and Indians trim for a charge:     “Stand ready, men! Let them come close, right up, and then     After the lead, the iron; Fire, and charge back!” So strength returned to Lyon.  The Iowa men who held the van,     Half drilled, were new To battle: “Some one lead us, then we’ll do”     Said Corporal Tryon: "]]]
