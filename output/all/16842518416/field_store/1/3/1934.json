I'd like,\" he added, \"to know about how sorry to feel for that baggage humper when you see him--after meeting the Flying U bunch.\"  The soul of Luck Lindsay was singing an impromptu doxology, but the face of him--so well was that face trained to do his bidding--became tinged with disgust and disappointment. With two \"real boys\" he was talking; he knew them by the unconscious range vernacular and the perfect candor with which they lied to him about themselves. But not so much as a gleam of the eye betrayed to them that he knew.  \"So that's why he went off grinning so wide,\" he mused aloud. \"I was sure caught then with my gun at home on the piano. I might have known better than to look for the real thing here, though you fellows have a few little marks that haven't worn off yet.\"  \"Me? Why, I'm a farmer, and I'm married, and I'm in a deuce of a stew because my spuds is drying up on me and no way to get water on 'em without I carry it to 'em in a jug,\" disclaimed Andy Green hastily. \"All I know about punchers I learned from seeing picture shows when I go to town. Now, Mig, here--\".  \"Oh, don't go and reveal all of my guilty past,\" protested the Native Son. \"Those three days I spent at a wild-west carnival show have about worked outa my system. I'm still trying to wear out the clothes I won off some of the boys in a crap game,\" he explained to Luck apologetically, \"but my earmarks won't outlast the clothes, believe me.\"  Luck thoughtfully flicked the ash collar off his cigar. \"It won't be any use then to go out to the Flying U, I suppose,\" he observed tentatively, his eyes keen for their changing expressions. \"I may as well take the next train out, I reckon, and drift on down into Arizona and New Mexico. I know about where some real punchers range--but I thought there was no harm in looking up the pedigree of this Flying U outfit. I'm sure some obliged to you boys for heading me off.\" Back of his eyes there was a laugh, but Andy Green and the Native Son were looking queerly at each other and did not see it there.  \"Oh, well, now you're this close, you wouldn't be losing anything by going on out to the ranch, anyway,\" Andy recanted guardedly. \"Come to think of it, there's one regular old-time ranger out there. They call him Slim. He's sure a devil on a horse--Slim is. I'd forgot about him when I spoke. He's a ranger, all right.\"  Luck knew very well that Andy Green had used the word \"ranger\" with the deliberate attempt to appear ignorant of the terminology of the range. A cow-puncher comes a long way from being a ranger, as every one knows. A ranger is a man of another profession entirely.  \"It used to be a real cattle ranch, they tell me,\" added the Native Son artfully. \"We live out near there, and if you wanted to ride out--\"  Luck appeared undecided. He sucked at his cigar, and he blew out the smoke thoughtfully, and contemplated the toe of one neat, tan shoe. Just plain acting, it was; just a playing of his part in the little game they had started. Better than if they had boasted of their range knowledge and their prowess in the saddle did Luck know that the dried little man had told him the truth. He knew that at the Flying U he would find a remnant of the old order of things. He would find some real boys, if these two were a fair sample of the bunch. That they lied to him about themselves and their fellows was but a sign that they accepted him as one of their breed. He looked them over with gladdened eyes. He listened to the unconscious tang of the range that was in their talk. These two farmers? He could have laughed aloud at the idea.  \"Well, I might get some atmosphere ideas,\" he said at last. \"If you don't mind having me trail along--\"  \"Glad to have yuh!\" came an instant duet.  \"And if I can scare up a horse--\"  \"Oh, we'll look after that. You can come right on out with us. The boys'll be plumb tickled to death to meet you.\"  \"Are they all farmers, same as you--these boys you mention?\" Luck looked up into Andy's eyes when he asked the question.  Andy grinned. \"Farmers, yes--same as us!\" he said ambiguously and picked up his gloves as he turned to lead the way out.     CHAPTER THREE  AND THEY SIGH FOR THE DAYS THAT ARE GONE   Just when Luck's new acquaintances first forgot to carry on their whimsical pretense of knowing little of range matters, neither of them could have told afterwards. They left town with the tacit understanding between them that they were going to have some fun with the Happy Family and with this likable little man of the movies. They rode out between long lines of hated barbed wire stretched taut, and they lied systematically and consistently to Luck Lindsay about themselves and their fellows and their particular condition of servitude to fate.  But somewhere along the trail they forgot to carry on the deception; and only Luck could have told why they forgot, and when they forgot, and how it was that, ten miles or so out from town, the two were telling how the Flying U had fought to save itself from extinction; how the \"bunch\" had schemed and worked and had in a measure succeeded in turning aside the tide of immigration from the Flying U range. Big issues they talked of as they rode three abreast through the warm haze of early fall; and as they talked, Luck's mind visioned the tale vividly, and his eyes swept the fence-checkered upland with a sympathetic understanding.  \"Right here,\" said Andy at last, when they came up to a gate set across the trail, \"right here is where we drawed the line--and held it. Now, half of those shacks you see speckled around are empty. The rest hold nesters too poor to get outa the country. One or two, that had a little money, have stuck and gone into sheep. But from here on to Dry Creek there's nothing ranging but the Flying U brand. Not much--compared to what the old range used to be--but still it keeps things going. We throwed a dam across the coulee, up there next the hills, and there's some fair hay land we're putting water on. We have to winter-feed practically everything these days. The range just nicely keeps the stock from snow to snow. I've got pitchfork callouses on my hands I never will outgrow if I was to fall heir to a billion dollars and never use my hands again for fifty years except to feed myself. It takes work, believe me! And if there's anything on earth a puncher hates worse than work, it's some other kind of work.  \"At the Flying U,\" he went on, looking at Luck pensively, \"you'll see the effect of too many people moved into the range country. If there's anything more distressing than a baby left without a mother, it's a bunch of cow-punchers that's outlived their range. Ain't that right?\"  \"Sure it's right!\" Luck's sympathy was absolutely sincere. \"How well I know it! Barbed wire scraped me outa the saddle in Wyoming--barbed wire and sheep. All there is left for a fellow is to forget it and start a barber shop or a cigar stand, or else make pictures of the old days, the way I've been doing. You can get a little fun out of making pictures of what used to be your everyday life. You can step up on a horse and go whoopin' over the hills and kinda forget it ain't true.\" A wistfulness was in Luck's tone. \"You pick out the big minutes from the old days--that had a whole lot of dust and sun and thirst and hunger in between, when all's said--you pick out the big minutes, and you bring them to life again, and sort of push them up close together and leave out most of the hardships. That's why so many of the old boys drift into pictures, I reckon. They try to forget themselves in the big minutes.\"  The two who rode with him were silent for a space. Then the Native Son spoke drily: \"About the biggest minutes we get now come about meal times.\"  \"Oh, we can get down in the breaks on round-up time and kinda forget the world's fenced clear 'way round it with barb-wire,\" Andy bettered the statement. \"But round-up gets shorter every year.\"  \"My next picture,\" Luck observed artfully and yet with a genuine desire to unbosom himself a little to these two who would understand, \"my next picture is going to be different. It's going to have a crackajack story in it, of course, but it will have something more than a story. I'm going to start it off with a trail herd coming up from Texas. You know--like it was when we were kids. I'm going to show those cattle trailing along tired--and footsore, some of them--and a drag strung out behind for a mile. I'm going to show the punchers tired and hungry, and riding half asleep in the saddle. And with that for a starter, I'm going to show the real range; the _real_ range--get that, boys? I'm going to cut clean away from regulation moving-picture West; clear out away from posses chasing outlaws all over a ten-acre location. I'm going to find me a real old cow-ranch; or if I can't find one, by thunder I'm going to _make_ me one. I'm sick of piling into a machine and driving out into Griffith Park and hunting a location for shooting scrapes to take place in. I know a place where I could produce stuff that would make people talk about it for a month after. Maybe the buildings would need some doctoring, but there's sure some round-pole corrals that would make your mouth water.\"  \"We used to have some,\" sighed Andy, \"at the Flying U. But they kinda went to pieces, and Chip's been replacing them with plank. By gracious, you don't see many round-pole corrals any more, come to think of it. There's remains, scattered around over the country.\"  \"The West--the real honest-to-goodness, twelve-months-in-the-year West,\" Luck went on riding his hobby, \"has been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12663"],["title","The Phantom Herd (#5)"],["body","little used in films. Ever notice that? It's all gone to shooting, and stealing the full product of all the gold mines in the world, and killing off more bad men than the Lord ever sent a flood to punish. For film purposes, the West consists of one part beautiful maiden in distress, three parts bandit, and two parts hero. Mix these to taste with plenty of swift action and gun-smoke, and serve with bandits all dead or handcuffed and beautiful maiden and hero in lover's embrace on top. That's your film West, boys--and how well I know it!\" Luck stopped to light a cigarette and to heave a sigh. \"I've been building film West to order for four years now, and more. Only fun I've had, and the best work I've done, I did with a bunch of Indians I've just taken back to their reservation. For the rest, it's mostly bunk.\"  \"Not that stage-driver picture,\" Andy dissented. \"There wasn't any bunk about that, old-timer. That was some driving!\"  \"Some driving, yes. Sure, it was. It was darned good driving, but the same old story doctored up a little. Same old shipment of gold, same old bandits lying in wait, same old hero doing stunts. I ought to know,\" he added with a grin. \"I wrote the story and did the stunts myself.\"  \"Well, they were some stunts!\" admired Andy with unusual sincerity.  Luck waved aside the compliment and went back to his hobby. \"Yes, but the West isn't just a setting for stunts. I've got my story--here,\" and he tapped his forehead, which was broad and full and not too high. \"I'm going to fire my camera man and get a better one, and I'm going to round me up a bunch of real boys that can get into the story and live it so well they won't need to do any acting,--boys that can stand a panoram on their work in the saddle. I've been getting by with a bunch of freaks that think they're real riders if they can lope a horse up-grade without falling off backwards. Most of my direction of those actorines has been knowing to a hair how much footage to give 'em without showing how raw their work is.  \"They say the public demands a certain grade of rottenness in Western films, but I never believed that, down deep in my heart. I believe the public stands for that stuff because they don't see any better. This four-reeler I've got in mind will sure open the eyes of some producers--or I'll buy me a five-acre tract in Burbank and raise string beans for a living.\"  \"I've got a patch of string beans,\" sighed the Native Son, \"that I've been sitting up nights with. I don't know what ails the cussed things. Some kind of little green bug chews on them soon as my back is turned. They ought to be ripe by now--and they aren't through blossoming. Don't go into beans, _amigo_.\"  Luck looked at him and laughed. The Native Son, in black and white Angora chaps and cream-colored shirt and silver-filigreed hatband as ornamental touches to his attire, did not look like a man who was greatly worried over his crop of string beans while he rode with a negligent grace away from a glowing sunset. But in these days the West is full of incongruities.  \"Oh, shut up about them beans!\" implored Andy Green with a bored air. \"It's water they want; and a touch of the hoe now and then. You leave 'em for a month at a time and then go back and wonder why you can't pick a hatful off 'em. Same as the rest of us have been ranching,\" he added ruefully, turning to Luck. \"With the best intentions in the world, the Lord never meant us fellers for farmers, and that's a fact. We'll drop a hoe any time of day or night to get out riding after stock. Of course, we didn't take up our claims with the idea of settling down and riding a hoe handle the rest of our lives. If we had, I guess maybe we'd have done a little better at it.\"  \"We did what we started out to do,\" the Native Son pointed out lazily: \"We saved the range--what little there is to save--and we kept a lot of poor yaps from starving to death on that land, didn't we?\" He smiled slowly. \"If I hadn't gotten gay and planted those beans,\" he added, \"I'd be feeling fine over it. A girl gave me a handful of pinto beans and asked me to plant them--I did hoe them,\" he defended tardily to Andy. \"I hoed them the day before the Fourth. You know I did. Same time you hoed those lemon-colored spuds of yours.\"  Luck let them wrangle humorously over their agricultural deficiencies, and drifted off into open-eyed dreaming. Into his picture he began to fit these two speculatively, with a purely tentative adjustment of their personalities to his requirements. They were arguing about which of the two was the worst farmer; but Luck, riding alongside them, was seeing them slouched in their saddles and riding, bone-tired, with a shuffling trail-herd hurrying to the next watering place. He was seeing them galloping hard on the flanks of a storm-lashed stampede, with cunningly placed radium flares lighting the scene brilliantly now and then. He was seeing these two plodding, heads bent, into the teeth of a blizzard. He was seeing...  \"I'll have to ride home to the missus now,\" Andy announced the second time before Luck heard him.  \"Mig will take you on down to the home ranch, and after supper I'll ride over. So long.\"  He swung away from them upon a faintly beaten trail, looked back once to grin and wave his hand, and touched his horse with the spurs. Luck stared after him thoughtfully, but he did not put his thoughts into words. He had been trained in the hard school of pictures. He had learned to hold his tongue upon certain matters, such as his opinion of a man's personal attributes, or criticism of his appearance, or anything which might be repeated, maliciously or otherwise, to that man. He did not say to Miguel Rapponi, for instance, what he thought of Andy Green as a man or a rider. He did not mention him at all. He had learned in bitterness how idle gossip may eat away the efficiency of a whole company.  For that reason, and also because his mind was busy with his plans and the best means of carrying them out, the two rode almost in silence to the hill that shut the Flying U coulee away from the world. Luck gave a long sigh and muttered \"Great!\" when the whole coulee lay spread before them. Then his quick glances took in various details of the ranch and he sighed again, from a different emotion.  \"It must have been a great place twenty years ago,\" he amended his first unqualified enthusiasm.  \"Why twenty years ago?\" The Native Son gave him a quick, half-resentful glance.  \"Twenty years ago there wasn't so much barb-wire trimming,\" Luck explained from the viewpoint of the trained producer of Western pictures. \"You couldn't place a camera anywhere now for a long shot across the coulee without bringing a fence into the scene. And the log stables are too old, and the new ones too new.\" He pulled up and stared long at the sweep of hills beyond, and the wide spread of the meadow and the big field farther up stream, and at the lazy meandering of Flying U creek with its willow fringe just turning yellow with the first touch of autumn. He looked at the buildings sprawled out below him.  \"When that log house was headquarters for the ranch, and the round-pole corrals were the only fences on the place,\" he said; \"when those old sheds held the saddle horses on cold nights, and the wagons were out from green grass to snowfall, and the boys laid around all winter, just reportin' regular at grub-pile and catching up on sleep they'd lost in the summer--Lor-dee, what a place it must have been!\"  There was something in his tone that brought the Native Son for an instant face to face with the Flying U in the old days when all the range was free. So, with faces sober, because the old days were gone and would never any more return, they rode down the grade and up to the new stable that was a monument to the dead past, even though it might also be a sign-post pointing to present prosperity. And in this wise came Luck Lindsay to the Flying U and was made welcome.     CHAPTER FOUR  THE LITTLE DOCTOR PROTESTS   The Little Doctor stepped out upon the porch with the faint tracing of a frown upon her smooth forehead, and with that slight tightening of the lips which to her family meant determination; disapproval sometimes, tense moments always.  She stood for a minute looking down toward the stables, and the wind that blew down the coulee seized upon the scant folds of her skirt, and flapped them impishly against the silken-clad ankles that were exceedingly good to look upon,--since fashion has now made it quite permissible to look upon ankles. Her lips did not relax with the waiting. Her frown grew a trifle more pronounced.  \"Mr. Lindsay?\" with a rising inflection.  Luck turned his head, saw her standing there, waved his hand to show that he heard, and started toward her with that brisk, purposeful swing to his walk that goes with an energetic disposition. The Little Doctor waited, and watched him, and did not relax a muscle from her determined attitude. Poor little Luck Lindsay hurried, so as not to keep her standing there in the wind, and, not knowing just what was before him, he smiled his smile as he came up to her.  I should have said, poor Little Doctor. She tried to keep her frown and the fixed idea that went with it, but she was foolish enough to look down into Luck's face and into his eyes with their sunny friendliness, and at the smile, where the friendliness was repeated and emphasized. Before she quite knew what she was doing, the Little Doctor smiled back. Still, she owned a fine quality of firmness.  \"Come in here. I want to have it out with you, and be done,\" she said, and turned to open the door.  \"Sounds bad, but I'm yours to command,\" Luck retorted cheerfully, and went up the steps still smiling. He liked the Little Doctor. She was his kind of woman. He felt that she would make a good pal, and he knew how few women are qualified for open comradeship. He cast a side glance at the kitchen window where the Kid stood with a large slice"]]]
