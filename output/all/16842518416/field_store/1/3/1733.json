Frail as dew upon the grass Or the spindrift of the sea, Out of nothing they were fashioned And to nothing must return.                                              20  Nay, but something of thy love, Passion, tenderness, and joy, Some strange magic of thy beauty, Some sweet pathos of thy tears,  Must imperishably cling                                                  25 To the cadence of the words, Like a spell of lost enchantments Laid upon the hearts of men.  Wild and fleeting as the notes Blown upon a woodland pipe,                                              30 They must haunt the earth with gladness And a tinge of old regret.  For the transport in their rhythm Was the throb of thy desire, And thy lyric moods shall quicken                                        35 Souls of lovers yet unborn.  When the golden days arrive, With the swallow at the eaves, And the first sob of the south-wind Sighing at the latch with spring,                                        40  Long hereafter shall thy name Be recalled through foreign lands, And thou be a part of sorrow When the Linus songs are sung.     PRINTED AT THE DE LA MORE PRESS 32 GEORGE STREET HANOVER SQUARE LONDON W     [Illustration: The King’s Classics]  CHATTO AND WINDUS  111 St. Martin’s Lane, London     A CONCISE LIST OF THE KING’S CLASSICS  GENERAL EDITOR:  PROFESSOR I. GOLLANCZ, Litt.D.   ALTHOUGH The King’s Classics are to be purchased for ⅙ net per volume, the series is unique in that      (1) the letterpress, paper, and binding are unapproached by any     similar series.      (2) “Competent scholars in every case have supervised this series,     which can therefore be received with confidence.”—_Athenæum_,      (3) With few exceptions, the volumes in this series are included in no     similar series, while several are copyright.     THE KING’S CLASSICS  UNDER THE GENERAL EDITORSHIP OF PROFESSOR I. GOLLANCZ, LITT.D.  “Right Royal Series.”—_Literary World._   “We note with pleasure that competent scholars in every case have supervised this Series, which can therefore be received with confidence.”—_Athenæum_.  The Series of “King’s Classics,” issued under the General Editorship of Professor I. GOLLANCZ, aims at introducing to the larger reading public many noteworthy works of literature not readily accessible in cheap form, or not hitherto rendered into English. Each volume is edited by some expert scholar, and has a summary introduction dealing with the main and essential facts of the literary history of the book; at the end there are the necessary notes for a right understanding of references and textual difficulties; where necessary, there is also a carefully-compiled index. As will be at once seen from the accompanying list, much original and new work has been secured for the Series, and it will be recognised that the “King’s Classics” differentiate themselves in a very marked way from the many reprints of popular books.  It should be noted, however, that while primarily rare masterpieces are included in the “King’s Classics,” modern popular classics, more especially such as have not yet been adequately or at all annotated, are not excluded from the Series.         *       *       *       *       *  NOTE.—_At the date of this list, May 1, 1907, Nos. 1-35 were published.
