Lucky thing that most of us have got our models almost ready.\"  \"Yes, especially as this notice says,\" added Paul, who had been reading it, \"that all models must be the sole work of the contestants.\"  \"If it wasn't for that it would be easy,\" remarked Hiram.  \"You can buy dandy models in New York.  I've seen them advertised in the papers.\"  \"Well, come on over now and put your name down, as a contestant. The blanks are in the office of the Hampton News,\" urged Frank.  \"I guess we're all through up here, Rob, aren't we?\" asked Hiram.  \"Yes,\" rejoined the young leader; \"but you study up on your woodcraft, Hiram, and devote more time to your signaling.  You are such a bug on wireless that you forget the rest of the stuff.\"  \"All right, Rob,\" promised Hiram contritely.  \"By the time we go camping I'll know a cat track from a squirrel's, or never put a detector on my head again.\"  Piloted by Frank, the two young scouts made their way to the office of the local paper, which had already placed a large bulletin announcing the aeroplane model competition in its window.  Quite a crowd was gathered, reading the details, as the three boys entered.  They applied for their application blanks and walked over to a desk to fill them out.  As they were hard at work at this, Jack Curtiss and his two chums entered the office.  \"You going into this, too?\" asked the proprietor of the paper, Ephraim Parkhurst, as Jack loudly demanded two blanks.  \"Sure,\" responded Jack confidently, \"and we are going to win it, too. Hullo,\" he exclaimed, as his eyes fell on the younger lads, \"those kids are after the prize, too.  Why, what would they do with fifty dollars if they had it?  However, there's not much chance of your winning anything,\" he added, coming up close to the boys, with a sneer on his face.  \"I think that I've got it cinched.\"  \"I didn't know that you knew anything about aeroplanes,\" responded Paul quietly.  \"Have you got a model built yet?\"  \"I know about a whole lot of things I don't go blabbing round to everybody about,\" responded the elder lad, with a sneer, \"and as for having a model built, I'm going to get right to work on one at once. It'll be a model of a Bleriot monoplane, and a large one, too.  I notice that there is nothing said in the rules about the size of the machines.\"  Soon after this the three chums left the newspaper office together.  \"Say,\" remarked Paul, in a rather worried tone, \"I don't believe that there is anything said about the size of the models.  Bill may build a great big one and beat us all out.\"  \"I suppose that the big machines would be handicapped according to their power and speed,\" rejoined Frank.  \"However, don't you worry about that.  I don't believe that Jack Curtiss knows enough about the subject to build an aeroplane in a week, and anyhow, I think it's all empty bluff on his part.\"  \"I hope so,\" replied Paul, as they reached his front gate.  \"Will you be over to-night, Hiram, to talk things over?  Bring your models with you, too, will you?\"  \"Sure,\" replied Hiram; \"but I've got to do a few things at home after supper.  I'll be over about eight o'clock or half-past.\"  \"All right.  I'll be ready for you,\" responded Paul, as the lads said good-by.  A few minutes later Jack Curtiss and his chums emerged from the newspaper office, the former and Bill Bender having made out their applications.  Sam seemed more dejected than ever, but there was a grin of satisfaction on Jack Curtiss' face.  \"Well, we sent the note, all right,\" he laughed under his breath, to his two chums.  \"He'll have got it by this time, and will be in town by dark.  You know your part of the program, Sam.  Don't fail to carry it out, or I'll see that you get into trouble.\"  \"There's no need to worry about me, Jack,\" rejoined Sam, with an angry flush.  \"I'll get the boat as soon as he lands, and keep it out of sight till you've done the trick.  \"Nothing like killing two birds with one stone,\" grinned Bill Bender. \"My! what a time there'll be in the morning, when they find out that there's been a regular double cross.\"  \"Hush!  Here come those three kids now,\" warned Sam, as Rob, Merritt and Tubby came down the street.  After what had passed they did not feel called upon to give the bully and his companions more than a cold nod.  \"Well, be as stuck up as you like to this after-noon!\" sneered Jack, after they had gone by, taking good care, however, that his voice would not carry.  \"I guess the laugh will be on you and your old friend of the island to-morrow.\"     CHAPTER VI  AN ISLAND MYSTERY   \"Hullo, Hiram; where are you bound for?\"  It was Rob who spoke, as Hiram hastened by his house in the early darkness.  \"Oh, hullo, Rob,\" responded the other.  \"I was wondering who that was hanging over the gate.  Why, I'm going to Paul's house.  I'm going to talk over that aeroplane model contest with him.  I think that we stand a chance to win if Jack Curtiss doesn't make good his boast.\"  \"What was that?\" inquired Rob.  \"Oh, he says that he is going to build an aeroplane that will beat us all.\"  \"And have it ready in a week?\" was Rob's astonished query.  \"That's what he says,\" responded Hiram.  \"It all looks kind of suspicious to me.  Fifty dollars is a large enough sum to tempt Jack to do almost anything.  Well, so long. I've got to hurry along. I'm late now.\"  And the lad hastened away to keep his appointment.  Rob was about to go into the house and get a book, when his attention was arrested by a figure coming up the street at a smart pace whose outlines somehow seemed familiar to him.  The next minute his guess was confirmed, when a hearty voice hailed him:  \"Waal, here I am, lad--all shipshape and in first-class trim. Now, what is it?  What do yer want?  Yer didn't explain in the note, but old Captain job Hudgins'll always stand by a shipmate in distress.\"  \"Why, whatever do you mean, captain?\" exclaimed Rob, amazed, and thinking that the captain must have taken leave of his wits. \"Who do you mean is in distress?\"  \"Mean?\" echoed the captain, in his turn, it seemed, surprised. \"Why, that note yer sent me.  Here it is--all written on one uv them new-fangled machines.\"  Rob took the crumpled paper the old seaman drew out of his coat and scanned it hastily by the light of the street lamp.  The following note met his puzzled gaze.  \"DEAR CAPTAIN: Please come over and see me at once.  Something serious has happened at the bank.  I need your aid and advice.  \"Yours,  \"ROB BLAKE.\"  \"Hum!  The signature is typewritten, too,\" mused Rob.  \"What kind of a joke is this?  I don't know, but I'll bet anything that Jack Curtiss is at the bottom of it.\"  \"Well,\" demanded the captain, \"what is it, a bit of gammon?  I'll keel-haul the man as did it if I can find him.\"  \"It looks like a hoax of some sort,\" admitted Rob, sorely puzzled; \"but I can't for the life of me see the object of it. Come into the house a minute, captain, and we'll try to figure it out.\"  Seated beneath the lamp in the library of his home, Rob scrutinized the letter closely, but could find absolutely no indication about it to betray who could have typewritten it.  \"How did you come to receive it?\" he asked suddenly.  \"Why, old Hank Handcraft come out in that crazy launch uv his and guv it ter me,\" rejoined the captain.  \"I ought ter hev told yer that in the first place, but I was all took aback and canvas a-shiver when yer tole me yer never wrote it.\"  \"Hank Handcraft,\" repeated Rob.  \"He's that queer old fellow that lives in a hut away down the beach?\"  \"Yes, and a bad character, too,\" replied the captain.  \"He used ter be a smuggler, and done a term in jail fer it.\"  \"Well, it's pretty certain that he didn't write this,\" said Rob. \"He couldn't get hold of a typewriter, even if he could use one. What did he tell you about it?  Did he say who gave it to, him?\"  \"No, he just handed it ter me, and says: 'A young party in Hampton says ter give yer this and hurry.'  I was just gettin' my supper when I heard his hail of 'Island, ahoy!'  I hurried out, and there he was in that old teakettle uv his, at the end uv my wharf.\"  \"And he left before you read the note?\"  \"I should say.  He hurried right off ag'in.\"  \"Well, I don't see any way to get at the bottom of this mystery but to go and see old Hank himself,\" mused Rob, after a period of thought. \"What do you think, captain?\"  \"That's the tack ter go about on, youngster,\" agreed the man of Topsail Island; \"but if yer are goin' down ter his place at this hour uv night, we'd better take somebody else along.  He's a bad character, and I'm only a feeble old man and yer are a lad.\"  \"I'll go round by Merritt Crawford's house,\" proposed Rob; \"then we'll pick up Tubby Hopkins.  I guess we can handle any trouble that Hank wants to make, with that force on hand.\"  \"I guess so,\" agreed the old man. \"I must say I'd like ter get ter the bottom uv this here mystery.  'All fair and above board' is my motto. I don't like these secret craft.\"  The two young scouts were both at home, and after brief explanations the four started off at a lively pace for Hank Handcraft's hut, which was situated about two miles along the beach.  As they hastened along, Rob explained to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12112"],["title","The Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol (#7)"],["body","others in more detail the nature of their mission, but though they were as much mystified by the sudden summons of Captain Hudgins as Rob and the captain himself, they could hit upon no plausible explanation for it.  It was a little over half an hour before they reached the dilapidated hut where old Handcraft, a beach-comber, made his dwelling place.  A short distance off the shore they could see by the moon, which had now risen, that his crazy old motor boat lay at anchor.  This was a sign that Hank was at home.  Lest it be wondered that such a character could have owned a motor boat, it may be explained here that the engine of Hank's old oyster skiff had been given him by a summer resident who despaired of making it work.  Hank, however, who was quite handy with tools, had fixed it up and managed to make it drive his patched old craft at quite a fair speed--sometimes.  When it broke down, as it frequently did, Hank, who was a philosopher in his way, simply got out his oars and rowed his heavy craft.  As an additional indication that the hut was occupied, light shone through several of its numerous chinks and crannies, and a knock at the door brought forth a low growl of: \"Who's there?\"  \"We want to see you,\" said Rob.  \"This is no time of night to call on a gentleman; come to-morrow and leave your cards,\" rumbled the gruff voice from inside the hut.  \"This is serious business,\" urged Rob.  \"Come on, open that door, Hank. This is Rob Blake, the banker's son.\"  \"Oh, it is, is it?\" grumbled the voice, as the clank of the door-chains being taken off was heard from within.  \"Well, I ain't had much business deals with your father lately, my private fortune being somewhat shrunk.\"  With a muffled chuckle from the speaker, the door slowly opened, and Hank, a ragged figure, with an immense matted beard, long tangled hair and dim blue eyes, that blinked like a rat's, stood revealed.  \"Come in, come in, gentlemen,\" he bowed, with mock politeness. \"I'm glad to see such a numerous and representative party.  Now, what kin I do you for?\"  He chuckled once more at his little jest, and the boys involuntarily shrank from him.  There was nothing to do, however, but enter the hut, and Hank accommodated his guests with a cracker box apiece as chairs.  On a table, roughly built out of similar boxes, a battered old stable lamp smoked and flared.  A more miserable human habitation could not be imagined.  \"Hank,\" began the captain, \"speak me fair and above board, mate--who give yer that letter ter bring ter me ter-night?\"  \"What letter?\" blankly responded Hank, a look of vacancy in his shifty eyes.  \"Oh, yer know well enough; that letter yer give me at supper time.\"  \"Captain, I'll give you my davy I don't know what you're talking about,\" returned the beachcomber.  \"What!\" roared the captain: rising to his feet and advancing threateningly.  \"Yer mean ter tell me, yer rapscallion, that yer don't recall landin' at Topsail Island earlier ter-night and givin' me a note which says ter come urgent and immediate ter see young Rob Blake here?\"  \"Why, captain,\" calmly returned Hank, with an indulgent grin, \"I really think you must be gettin' childish in your old age.  You must be seeing things.  I hope you ain't drinking.\"  \"You--you scoundrel, you!\" roared the old captain, almost beside himself with rage, and dancing with clenched fists toward Hank.  The beach-comber's filthy hand slipped into his rags in a minute, and the next instant he was squatting back on his haunches in the corner of the hut, like a wildcat about to spring.  In his hand there glistened, in the yellow rays of the lamp, a blued-steel revolver.  \"Don't get angry, captain.  It's bad for the digestion,\" grinned the castaway.  \"Now,\" he went on, \"I'm going to tell you flat that if you say I came to your island to-night, you're dreaming. It must have been some one else.  \"Come on, boys,\" directed the captain, with an angry shrug. \"There's no use wastin' time on the critter.  I'm inclined ter think now that there's somethin' more than ordinary in the wind,\" he added, as they left the hut, with the half-idiotic chuckles of its occupant ringing in their ears.     CHAPTER VII  SOME STRANGE DOINGS   It was not far from midnight when the boys, sorely perplexed, once more reached Hampton.  The main street had been deserted long since, and every one in the village had returned to rest.  The boys left the captain by the water-front, while they headed up the Main Street for their respective homes.  Rob remained up, pondering over the events of the evening for some time, without arriving at any solution of them.  He was just about to extinguish his light when he was startled by a loud:  \"His--s--st!\"  The noise came from directly below his open window, which faced onto the garden.  He put out his head, and saw a dark figure standing in the yard.  \"Who is it?\" he demanded.  \"It's me, the captain, Rob,\" rejoined the well-known voice.  \"I wouldn't have bothered yer but that I saw a light in yer window.\"  \"What's the trouble, captain?\" asked the boy, noting a troubled inflection in the old man's voice.  \"My boat's gone!\" was the startling reply.  \"Gone!  Are you sure?\"  \"No doubt about it.  I left her tied ter the L wharf when I come up from the island, and now there ain't hide nor hair uv her there.\"  \"I'll bet anything that that fellow Curtiss is at the bottom of all this,\" cried Rob.  \"I remember now I heard some time ago that he was thick with that Hank Handcraft.\"  \"I don't know what ter do about it at this time uv ther night,\" went on the distressed captain, \"an' I can't go round waking folks up ter get another boat.\"  \"Of course not,\" agreed Rob.  \"There's only one thing for you to do, captain, and that is to put up here to-night, and in the morning we'll see what we can do.\"  \"That's mighty fair, square, and above board uv yer, lad,\" said the captain gratefully.  \"Punk me anywhere.  I'm an old sailor, and can aways find the softest plank in the deck.\"  \"You won't have to do that,\" said Rob, who had slipped downstairs by this time and opened the door; \"we've got a spare room you can bunk in to-night.  I'll explain it all to father in the morning. Perhaps he can help us out.\"  \"Gee whiz! almost twelve o'clock,\" exclaimed Hiram Nelson, looking up at the clock from the dining-room table in Paul Perkins' house.  The chamber was strewn with text books on model aeroplane construction and littered with figures and plans of the boys' own devising.  \"How time flies when you're on a subject that interests you.\"  \"Yes, it's a good thing it's vacation time,\" agreed Paul.  \"We wouldn't be in much shape to work at our books to-morrow, eh?\"  \"I should say not!\" rejoined Hiram with conviction.  \"Well, so long, Paul.  I guess we've got it all figured out now, and all that is left to do is to go ahead.\"  \"That's the idea,\" responded Paul.  \"We'll get the prize for the glory of the Eagle Patrol, or--or--\"  \"Bust!\" Hiram finished for him.  Hiram's way home lay past the bank, and as he walked down the moonlit street he thought for a minute that he perceived a light in the windows of the armory.  Almost as he fancied he glimpsed it, however, it vanished, and the lad was convinced that he must have been mistaken, or else seen a reflection of the moonlight on the windows.  \"Queer, though,\" he mused.  \"I could almost have sworn it was a light.\"  Another curious thing presently attracted his attention.  As he neared the bank a dark figure seemed to vanish into the black shadows round the corner.  Something familiar about it struck Hiram, and the next moment he realized why.  \"If that wasn't Bill Bender, I'm a Dutchman,\" he muttered, his heart beating a little faster.  \"But what can he be doing round here at this time of night?\"  As he put the question to himself, Bill Bender, walking rapidly, as if he had come from some distance, and had not dodged round the corner a moment before, suddenly appeared from round the angle of the bank building.  \"Good evening, Bill,\" said Hiram, wondering if his eyes were not playing him some queer tricks; \"wasn't that you just went round the corner?\"  \"Who, me?\" blustered Bill.  \"You need to visit an oculist, young man. I've just come from a visit to my aunt's.  It was her birthday, and we had a bully time.  Sat up a little too late, though.  Good night.\"  And with a great assumption of easiness, the crony of Jack Curtiss walked rapidly off up the street.  \"I guess he's right,\" mused Hiram, as he hurried on home.  \"But if that wasn't Bill Bender who walked round that corner it was his ghost, and all the ghosts I ever read about don't wear squeaky boots.\"  If Hiram had remained he would have had further cause to be suspicious and speculative.  The lad's footsteps had hardly died out down the street before Bill Bender cautiously retraced his way, and, going round to the side street, upon which the steps leading to the armory opened, gave a cautious whistle.  In reply a sack was lowered from a window to him by some person invisible above.  Although there was some little light on the Main Street by reason of the moon and the few scattering lamps along the thoroughfare, the spot in which Bill now stood was as black as the proverbial pocket.  \"Is the coast all clear?\" came down a voice from the window above.  \"Yes; but if I hadn't spotted young Hiram Nelson coming down the street and warned you to put out that light, it wouldn't have been,\" responded Bill in the same cautious tone.  \"Well, we're safe enough now,\" came back the voice above, which any of his acquaintances would have recognized as Jack Curtiss'. \"I've got the rest of them in this other sack.  Here, take this one when I drop it.\"  Bill made a bungling effort to catch the heavy receptacle that fell following Jack's warning, but in the darkness he failed, and it crashed down with quite a clatter.  \"Look out!\" warned Jack anxiously, \"some one might hear that.\"  \"Not in this peaceful community.  You seem to forget"]]]
