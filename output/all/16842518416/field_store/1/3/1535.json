But in five minutes or less he had forgotten the snub. His head popped in again.  \"Bill!\"  There may be much meaning in a tone, though it utters but one unmeaning word. Bill dropped a handful of nails upon a table and came striding down the long room to the door; pushed Jim unceremoniously aside and stood upon the step. He was just in time to look into the rageful, blue eyes of Jack Allen, walking with a very straight back and a contemptuous smile on his lips, between the Captain and one of his trusted lieutenants.  Bill's fingers clenched suggestively upon the handle of the hammer. His jaw slackened and then pushed itself forward to a fighting angle while he stared, and he named in his amazement that place which the padres had taught the Indians to fear.  The Captain heard him and grinned sourly as he passed on. Jack heard him, and his smile grew twisted at the tone in which the word was uttered; but he still smiled, which was more than many a man would have done in his place.  Bill stood while the rest of that grim procession passed his place. There was another, a young fellow who looked ready to cry, walking unsteadily behind Jack, both his arms gripped by others of the Vigilance Committee. There were two crude stretchers, borne by stolid-faced miners in red flannel shirts and clay-stained boots. On the first a dead man lay grinning up at the sun, his teeth just showing under his bushy mustache, a trickle of red running down from his temple. On the next a man groaned and mumbled blasphemy between his groanings.  Bill took it all in, a single glance for each,--a glance trained by gambling to see a great deal between the flicker of his lashes. He did not seem to look once at the Captain, yet he knew that Jack's ivory-handled pistols hung at the Captain's rocking hips as he went striding past; and he knew that malice lurked under the grizzled hair which hid the Captain's cruel lips; and that satisfaction glowed in the hard, sidelong glance he gave his prisoner.  He stood until he saw Jack duck his head under the tent flaps of the jail and the white-faced youth follow shrinking after. He stood while the armed guards took up their stations on the four sides of the tent and began pacing up and down the paths worn deep in tragic significance. He saw the wounded man carried into Pete's place across the way, and the dead man taken farther down the street. He saw the crowd split into uneasy groups which spoke a common tongue, that they might exchange unasked opinions upon this, the biggest sensation since Sandy left town with his ankles tied under the vicious-eyed buckskin whose riders rode always toward the west and whose saddle was always empty when he came back to his stall at the end of the town. Bill saw it all, to the last detail; but after his one explosive oath, he was apparently the most indifferent of them all.  When the Captain ended his curt instructions to the guard and came towards him, Bill showed a disposition to speak.  \"Who's the kid?\" he drawled companionably, while his fingers itched upon the hammer, and the soul of him lusted for sight of the hole it could make in the skull of the Captain. \"I don't recollect seeing him around town--and there ain't many faces I forget, either.\"  The Captain shot him a surprised look that was an unconscious tribute to Bill's diplomatic art. But Bill's level glance would have disarmed a keener man than Tom Perkins.  Perkins stopped. \"Stranger, from what he said--though I've got my doubts. Some crony of Allen's, I expect. It was him done the shooting; the kid didn't have any gun on him. Allen didn't deny it, either.\"  \"No--he's just bull-headed enough to tough it out,\" commented Bill. \"What was the row about--do yuh know?\"  Perkins stiffened. \"That,\" he said with some dignity, \"will come out at the trial. He killed Rawhide outright, and Texas Bill will die, I reckon. The trial will show what kinda excuse he thought he had.\" Having delivered himself, thus impartially and with malice towards none, Perkins started on.  \"Oh, say! You don't mind if I talk to 'em?\" Bill gritted his teeth at having to put the sentence in that favor-seeking tone, but he did it, nevertheless.  The Captain scowled under his black, slouch hat. \"I've give strict orders not to let anybody inside the tent till after the trial,\" he said shortly.  \"Oh, that's all right. I'll talk to 'em through the door,\" Bill agreed equably. \"Jack owes me some money.\"  The Captain muttered unintelligibly and passed on, and Bill chose to interpret the mutter as consent. He strolled over to the tent, joked condescendingly with the guard who stood before it, and announced that the Captain had said he might talk to the prisoners.  \"I did not,\" said the Captain unexpectedly at his shoulder. \"I said you couldn't. After the trial, you can collect what's coming to you, Mr. Wilson. That is,\" he added hastily, \"in case Allen should be convicted. If he ain't, you can do as you please.\" He looked full at the guard. \"Shoot any man that attempts to enter that tent or talk to the prisoners without my permission, Shorty,\" he directed, and turned his back on Bill.  Bill did not permit one muscle of his face to twitch. \"All right,\" he drawled, \"I guess I won't go broke if I don't get it. You mind what your Captain tells you, Shorty! He's running this show, and what he says goes. You've got a good man over yuh, Shorty. A fine man. He'll weed out the town till it'll look like grandpa's onion bed--if the supply of rope don't give out!\" Whereupon he strolled carelessly back to his place, and went in as if the incident were squeezed dry of interest for him. He walked to the far end of the big room, sat deliberately down upon a little table, and rewarded himself for his forbearance by cursing methodically the Captain, the Committee of which he was the leader, the men who had witlessly given him the power he used so ruthlessly as pleased him best, and Jack Allen, whose ill-timed criticisms and hot-headed freedom of speech had brought upon himself the weight of the Committee's dread hand.  \"Damn him, I tried to tell him!\" groaned Bill, his face hidden behind his palms. \"They'll hang him--and darn my oldest sister's cat's eyes, somebody'll sweat blood for it, too!\" (Bill, you will observe, had reached the end of real blasphemy and was forced to improvise milder expletives as he went along.) \"There ought to be enough decent men in this town to--\"  \"Did you git to see Jack?\" ventured Jim, coming anxiously up to his boss.  The tone of him, which was that hushed tone which we employ in the presence of the dead, so incensed Bill that for answer he threw the hammer viciously in his direction. Jim took the hint and retreated hastily.  \"No, damn 'em, they won't let me near him,\" said Bill, ashamed of his violence. \"I knew they'd get him; but I didn't think they'd get him so quick. I sent a letter down by an Injun this morning to his pardner to come up and get him outa town before he--But it's too late now. That talk he made last night--\"  \"Say, he shot Swift in the arm, too,\" said Jim. \"Pity he didn't kill him. They're getting a jury together already. Say! Ain't it hell?\"     CHAPTER III  THE THING THEY CALLED JUSTICE   Jack stared meditatively across at the young fellow sitting hunched upon another of the boxes that were the seats in this tent-jail, which was also the courtroom of the Vigilance Committee, and mechanically counted the slow tears that trickled down between the third and fourth fingers of each hand. A half-hour spent so would have rasped the nerves of the most phlegmatic man in the town, and Jack was not phlegmatic; fifteen minutes of watching that silent weeping sufficed to bring a muffled explosion.  \"Ah, for God's sake, brace up!\" he gritted. \"There's some hope for you--if you don't spoil what chance you have got, by crying around like a baby. Brace up and be a man, anyway. It won't hurt any worse if you grin about it.\"  The young fellow felt gropingly for a red-figured bandanna, found it and wiped his face and his eyes dejectedly. \"I beg your pardon for seeming a coward,\" he apologized huskily. \"I got to thinking about my--m-mother and sisters, and--\"  Jack winced. Mother and sisters he had longed for all his life. \"Well, you better be thinking how you'll get out of the scrape you're in,\" he advised, with a little of Bill Wilson's grimness. \"I'm afraid I'm to blame, in a way; and yet, if I hadn't mixed into the fight, you'd be dead by now. Maybe that would have been just as well, seeing how things have turned out,\" he grinned. \"Still--have a smoke?\"  \"I never used tobacco in my life,\" declined the youth somewhat primly.  \"No, I don't reckon you ever did!\" Jack eyed him with a certain amount of pitying amusement. \"A fellow that will come gold-hunting without a gun to his name, would not use tobacco, or swear, or do anything that a perfect lady couldn't do! However, you put up a good fight with your fists, old man, and that's something.\"  \"I'd have been killed, though, if you hadn't shot when you did. They were too much for me. I haven't tried to thank you--\"  \"No, I shouldn't think you would,\" grinned Jack. \"I don't see yet where I've done you any particular favor: from robbers to Vigilance Committee might be called an up-to-date version of 'Out of the frying-pan into the fire.'\"  The boy glanced fearfully toward the closed tent-flaps. \"Ssh!\" he whispered. \"The guard can hear--\"  \"Oh, that's all right,\" returned Jack, urged perhaps to a conscious bravado by the very weakness of the other. \"It's all day with me, anyway. I may as well say what I think.  \"And so--\" He paused to blow one of his favorite little smoke rings and watch it float to the dingy ridge-pole, where it flickered and faded into a blue haze \"--and so, I'm going to say right out in meeting what I think of this town and the Committee they let"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12139"],["title","The Gringos (#4)"],["body","out justice. Justice!\" He laughed sardonically. \"Poor old lady, she couldn't stop within forty miles of Perkins' Committee if she had forty bandages over her eyes, and both ears plugged with cotton! You wait till their farce of a trial is over. You may get off, by a scratch--I hope so. But unless Bill Wilson--\"  \"Aw, yuh needn't pin no hopes on Bill Wilson!\" came a heavy, malicious voice through the tent wall. \"All hell can't save yuh, Jack Allen! You've had a ride out to the oak comin' to yuh for quite a while, and before sundown you'll get it.\"  \"Oh! Is that so, Shorty? Say, you're breaking the rules, you old pirate; you're talking to the prisoners without permission. As the Captain's most faithful dog Tray, you'd better shoot yourself; it'll save the town the trouble of hanging you later on!\" He smoked calmly while Shorty, on guard without, growled a vilifying retort, and the other guards snickered.  \"Ah, brace up!\" he advised his quaking companion again. \"If my company doesn't damn you beyond all hope, you may get out of the scrape. You didn't have a gun, and you're a stranger and haven't said naughty things about your neighbors. Cheer up. Life looks just as good to me as it does to you. I love this old world just as well as any man that ever lived in it, and I'm not a bit pleased over leaving it--any more than you are. But I can't see where I could better matters by letting myself get wobbly in the knees. I'm sorry I didn't make a bigger fight to keep my guns, though. I'd like to have perforated a few more of our most worthy Committee before I quit; our friend Shorty, for instance,\" he stipulated wickedly and clearly, \"and the Captain.\"  If he were deliberately trying to goad Shorty to further profanity, the result should have satisfied him. The huge shadow of Shorty moving back and forth upon the front wall of the tent, became violently agitated and developed a gigantic arm that waved threateningly over the ridge pole. The other guards laughed and checked their laughter with a suddenness which made Jack's eyes leave the dancing shadow and seek questioningly the closed tent flaps.  \"If I'm any good at reading signs, we are now about to be tried by our peers--twelve good men and true,\" he announced ironically. \"Brace up, old man! The chances are you'll soon be out of this mess and headed for home. Don't be afraid to tell the truth--and don't act scared; they'll take that as a sure sign you've got a guilty conscience. Just keep a stiff upper lip; it won't take long; we do things in a hurry, out here!\"  \"Say, you're a brick, Mr. Allen!\" the boy burst out, impulsively gripping the hand of his champion.  Jack jerked his hand away--not unkindly, but rather as if he feared to drop, even for an instant, his flippant defiance of the trick fate had played him. The jerk sent a small, shining thing sliding down to the floor; where it stood upright and quivered in the soft sand.  \"Lord!\" he ejaculated under his breath, snatching it up as a thief would snatch at his spoils. He looked fearfully at the closed flaps, outside which the trampling of many feet sounded closer and closer; and with a warning shake of his head at the other, slid the dagger into his sleeve again, carefully fastening the point in the stout hem of the buckskin.  \"You never can tell,\" he muttered, smiling queerly as he made sure the weapon was not noticeable.  He was rolling another cigarette when the Captain parted the tent flaps and came stooping in, followed by twelve men of the Committee who were to be the jury, and as many spectators as could crowd after them.  \"Gentlemen, be seated,\" the Captain invited formally, and motioned the jury to the crude bunks that lined one side of the large tent. Jack and the boy he moved farther from the entrance, and took up his own position where his sharp eyes commanded every inch of the interior and where the gun which he drew from its holster and rested upon his knee could speak its deadly rebuke to any man there if, in the upholding of justice, the Captain deemed it necessary.  The jury shuffled to their places, perched in a row upon the edge of the bunks and waited silently, their eyes fixed expectantly upon their Captain. The crowd edged into the corners and along the sides, their hat crowns scraping the canvas roof as they were forced closer to the low wall.  The Captain waited until the silence was a palpable thing made alive by the rhythmic breathing of the men who were to look upon this new travesty of justice.  \"Gentlemen,\" he said at last, his sonorous voice carrying his words distinctly to the crowd without, \"we are now ready to proceed with the investigation. I wish to state, for the information of those present, that after the prisoners were placed here under guard, I went to get a statement from the wounded man, Mr. Texas Bill. I found him dying from a wound inflicted upon his person by a pistol ball which passed through his left lung, above and to the right of his heart. I did not take a written statement, for lack of time and writing materials. But Texas swore--\"  \"Yeah--I'll bet he swore!\" commented Bill Wilson under his breath. Every one looked toward Bill, standing just inside the flaps, and the Captain scowled while he waited for attention.  \"Texas swore that he was shot by one of the prisoners, Jack Allen by name, who fired upon him without due provocation, while he was talking to this other prisoner, whose name we have yet to learn. Texas stated that Allen, appearing suddenly from behind some bushes, began shooting with deadly intent and without warning, wantonly murdering Rawhide Jack, who lies dead in Smith's back room, and shooting him, Texas, through the lung. He also stated that Mr. Dick Swift was with him and Rawhide Jack, and was also shot by the prisoner, Jack Allen, without cause or provocation.  \"They had met the stranger and were standing talking to him about his luck in the diggin's. This stranger, who is the other prisoner, was inclined to be sassy, and made a pass at Rawhide with his fist, telling him to mind his own business and not ask so many questions. Rawhide struck back; and Allen, coming out from behind some bushes, began shooting.\"  The Captain stopped and looked calmly and judicially from face to face in the crowd.  \"That, gentlemen, is the statement made to me by Texas Bill, who now lies dead in Pete's Place as a result of the wound inflicted by Allen.\"  \"That's a lot of swearing for a man to do that's been shot through the lungs,\" commented Bill Wilson skeptically.  The Captain gave him a malevolent look and continued. \"We will ask Mr. Swift to come forward and tell us what he knows of this deplorable and, if I may be permitted the term, disgraceful affair.\"  Mr. Swift edged his way carefully through the crowd with his left arm thrust out to protect the right, which was bandaged and rested in a blood-stained sling. He asked permission to sit down; kicked a box into the small, open space between the Captain, the jury, and the prisoners, and seated himself with the air of a man about to perform an extremely painful duty.  \"Hold up your right hand,\" commanded the Captain.  Swift apologetically raised his left hand and gazed steadfastly into the cold, impartial eyes of his Captain.  \"You swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so-help-you-God?\"  Swift, his purplish eyes wide and clear and honest as the gaze of a baby, calmly affirmed that he did.  Jack grinned and lazily fanned the smoke of his cigarette away, so that he might the better gaze upon this man who was about to tell the whole truth and nothing else. He caught Swift's eye and added a sneering lift to the smile; and Swift's eyes changed from bland innocence to hate triumphant.  \"Mr. Swift, you will now relate to us the circumstances of this affair, truthfully, in the order of their happening,\" directed the deep voice of the Captain.  Mr. Swift carefully eased his wounded arm in its sling, turned his innocent gaze upon the crowd, and began:  \"Texas, Rawhide, and myself were crossing the sandy stretch south of town about noon, when we met this chap--the stranger there.\" He nodded slightly toward the boy. \"I was walking behind the other two, but I heard Rawhide say: 'Hello, son, any luck in the diggin's?' The kid said: 'None of your damn business!' That made Rawhide kinda mad, being spoke to that way when he just meant to be friendly, and he told the kid he better keep a civil tongue in his head if he wanted to get along smooth--or words to that effect. I don't,\" explained Mr. Swift virtuously, \"remember the exact words, because I was looking at the fellow and wondering what made him so surly. He sassed Rawhide again, and told him to mind his own business and give advice when it was asked for, and struck at him. Rawhide hit back, and then I heard a shot, and Rawhide fell over. I looked around quick, and started to pull my gun, but a bullet hit me here--\" Mr. Swift laid gentle finger-tips upon his arm near the shoulder--\"so I couldn't. I saw it was Jack Allen shooting and coming towards us from a clump of bushes off to the right of us. He shot again, and Texas Bill fell. I ducked behind a bush and started for help, when I met the Captain and a few others coming out to see what was the matter. That,\" finished Mr. Swift, \"is the facts of the case, just as they happened.\"  The Captain waited a minute or two, that the \"facts\" might sink deep into the minds of the listeners.  \"Were any shots fired by any one except Allen?\" he asked coldly, when the silence was sufficiently emphasized.  \"There were not. Nobody,\" Swift flashed with a very human resentment, \"had a chance after he commenced!\" He flushed at the involuntary tribute to the prowess of his enemy, when he saw that maddening grin appear again on Jack's lips; a grin which called him liar and scoundrel and in the same flicker defied him.  The investigation took on the color of a sensation at that point, when the"]]]
