During my whole journey I remarked with pleasure that the lot of a slave in the house of a Mussulman is not nearly so hard as we believe.  The Turkish women are no great admirers of animated conversations; still there was more talking in their societies than in the assemblies of the men, who sit silent and half asleep in the coffee-houses, languidly listening to the narrations of a story- teller.  The ladies' garden resembles a churchyard.  Funeral monuments peer forth at intervals between the cypresses, beneath which the visitors sit talking and joking cheerfully.  Every now and then one would suddenly start up, spread a carpet beside her companions, and kneel down to perform her devotions.  As no one of the male sex was allowed to be present, all were unveiled.  I noticed many pretty faces among them, but not a single instance of rare or striking beauty.  Fancy large brilliant eyes, pale cheeks, broad faces, and an occasional tendency to corpulence, and you have the ladies' portrait.  Small-pox must still be rather prevalent in these parts, for I saw marks of it on many faces.  The Turkish ladies' costume is not very tasteful.  When they go abroad, they are completely swathed in an upper garment, generally made of dark merino.  In the harem, or in any place where men are not admitted, they doff this garment, and also the white cloth in which they wrap their heads and faces.  Their costume consists, properly speaking, of very wide trousers drawn together below the ancle, a petticoat with large wide sleeves, and a broad sash round the waist.  Over this sash some wear a caftan, others only a spencer, generally of silk.  On their feet they wear delicate boots, and over these slippers of yellow morocco; on their heads a small fez-cap, from beneath which their hair falls on their shoulders in a number of thin plaits.  Those Turks, male and female, who are descended from Mahomet, have either a green caftan or a green turban.  This colour is here held so sacred, that scarcely any one may wear it.  I would even advise the Franks to avoid green in their dresses, as they may expose themselves to annoyance by using it.  After I had had more than an hour's leisure to notice all these circumstances, a noise suddenly arose in the courtyard, which produced a stir among the women.  I considered from these appearances that it was time to go to the temple, and hastened to join my party.  A great crowd was waiting in the courtyard, for the Sultan was expected.  I was glad to have the good fortune to behold him on the very day of my arrival.  As a stranger, I was allowed, without opposition, a place in the front ranks,--a trait of good breeding on the part of the Turks which many a Frank would do well to imitate.  In a Turk, moreover, this politeness is doubly praiseworthy, from the fact that he looks upon my poor sex with great disrespect; indeed, according to his creed, we have not even a soul.  I had only stood a few moments, when the Sultan appeared on horseback, surrounded by his train.  He alone rode into the courtyard; the others all dismounted at the gate, and entered on foot.  The horse on which the Sultan rode was of rare beauty, and, as they told me, of the true Arabian breed; the saddle-cloth was richly embroidered with gold, and the stirrups, of the same precious metal, were in the form of shoes, covered with the finest chased work.  The Sultan is a slender slim-looking youth of nineteen years of age, and looks pale, languid, and blase.  His features are agreeable, and his eyes fine.  If he had not abandoned himself at so early an age to all the pleasures of the senses, he would, no doubt, have grown up a stalwart man.  He wore a long cape of dark-blue cloth; and a high fez-cap, with a heron's plume and a diamond clasp, decked his head.  The greeting of the people, and the Sultan's mode of acknowledging it, is exactly as at Vienna, except that here the people at intervals raise a low cry of welcome.  As soon as the Sultan had entered the temple, all flocked in.  The men and the Franks (the latter without distinction of sex) sit or stand in the body of the temple.  The Turkish women sit in galleries, behind such close wire gratings that they are completely hidden.  The temple, or more properly the hall, is of inconsiderable size, and the spectators are only separated from the priests by a low railing.  At two o'clock the dervishes appeared, clad in long petticoats with innumerable folds, which reached to their heels.  Their heads were covered with high pointed hats of white felt.  They spread out carpets and skins of beasts, and began their ceremonies with a great bowing and kissing of the ground.  At length the music struck up; but I do not remember ever to have heard a performance so utterly horrible.  The instruments were a child's drum, a shepherd's pipe, and a miserable fiddle.  Several voices set up a squeaking and whining accompaniment, with an utter disregard of time and tune.  Twelve dervishes now began their dance,--if indeed a turning round in a circle, while their full dresses spread round them like a large wheel, can be called by such a name.  They display much address in avoiding each other, and never come in contact, though their stage is very small.  I did not notice any \"convulsions,\" of which I had read in many descriptions.  The ceremony ended at three o'clock.  The Sultan once more mounted his horse, and departed with his train and the eunuchs.  In the course of the day I saw him again, as he was returning from visiting the medical faculty.  It is not difficult to get a sight of the Sultan; he generally appears in public on Tuesdays, and always on Fridays, the holiday of the Turks.  The train of the young autocrat presents a more imposing appearance when he goes by water to visit a mosque, which he generally does on every Friday.  Only two hours before he starts it is announced in which mosque he intends to appear.  At twelve, at noon, the procession moves forward.  For this purpose two beautiful barges are in readiness, painted white, and covered with gilded carvings.  Each barge is surmounted by a splendid canopy of dark-red velvet, richly bordered with gold fringe and tassels.  The floor is spread with beautiful carpets.  The rowers are strong handsome youths, clad in short trousers and jacket of white silk, with fez-caps on their heads.  On each side of the ship there are fourteen of these rowers, under whose vigorous exertions the barge flies forward over wave and billow like a dolphin.  The beautifully regular movements of the sailors have a fine effect.  The oars all dip into the water with one stroke, the rowers rise as one man, and fall back into their places in the same perfect time.  A number of elegant barges and kaiks follow the procession.  The flags of the Turkish fleet and merchant-ships are hoisted, and twenty-one cannons thunder forth a salutation to the Sultan.  He does not stay long in the mosque, and usually proceeds to visit a barrack or some other public building.  When the monarch goes by water to the mosque, he generally returns also in his barge; if he goes by land, he returns in the same manner.  The most popular walks in Pera are \"the great and little Campo,\" which may be termed \"burying-places in cypress-groves.\"  It is a peculiar custom of the Turks, which we hardly find among any other nation, that all their feasts, walks, business-transactions, and even their dwellings, are in the midst of graves.  Every where, in Constantinople, Pera, Galata, etc., one can scarcely walk a few paces without passing several graves surrounded by cypresses.  We wander continually between the living and the dead; but within four and twenty hours I was quite reconciled to the circumstance.  During the night-time I could pass the graves with as little dread as if I were walking among the houses of the living.  Seen from a distance, these numerous cypress-woods give to the town a peculiar fairy-like appearance; I can think of nothing with which I could compare it. Every where the tall trees appear, but the tombs are mostly hidden from view.  It took a longer time before I could accustom myself to the multitude of ownerless dogs, which the stranger encounters at all corners, in every square and every street.  They are of a peculiarly hideous breed, closely resembling the jackal.  During the daytime they are not obnoxious, being generally contented enough if they are allowed to sleep undisturbed in the sun, and to devour their prey in peace.  But at night they are not so quiet.  They bark and howl incessantly at each other, as well as at the passers-by, but do not venture an attack, particularly if you are accompanied by a servant carrying a lantern and a stick.  Among themselves they frequently have quarrels and fights, in which they sometimes lose their lives. They are extremely jealous if a strange dog approaches their territory, namely the street or square of which they have possession.  On such an intruder they all fall tooth and nail, and worry him until he either seeks safety in flight or remains dead on the spot.  It is therefore a rare circumstance for any person to have a house-dog with him in the streets.  It would be necessary to carry the creature continually, and even then a number of these unbidden guests would follow, barking and howling incessantly. Neither distemper nor madness is to be feared from these dogs, though no one cares for their wants.  They live on carrion and offal, which is to be found in abundance in every street, as every description of filth is thrown out of the houses into the road.  A few years ago it was considered expedient to banish these dogs from Constantinople.  They were transported to two uninhabited islands in the Sea of Marmora, the males to one and the females to another. But dirt and filth increased in the city to such a degree,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12561"],["title","A Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy (#7)"],["body","people were glad to have them back again.  The town is not lighted.  Every person who goes abroad at night must take a lantern with him.  If he is caught wandering without a lantern by the guard, he is taken off without mercy to the nearest watch-house, where he must pass the night.  The gates of the city are shut after sunset.  In proportion as I was charmed with the beautiful situation of Constantinople, so I was disgusted with the dirt and the offensive atmosphere which prevail every where; the ugly narrow streets, the continual necessity to climb up and down steep places in the badly- paved roads, soon render the stranger weary of a residence in this city.  Worse than all is the continual dread of conflagration in which we live.  Large chests and baskets are kept in readiness in every house; if a fire breaks out in the neighbourhood, all valuable articles are rapidly thrown into these and conveyed away.  It is customary to make a kind of contract with two or three Turks, who are pledged, in consideration of a trifling monthly stipend, to appear in the hour of danger, for the purpose of carrying the boxes and lending a helping hand wherever they can.  It is safer by far to reckon on the honesty of the Turks than on that of the Christians and Greeks.  Instances in which a Turk has appropriated any portion of the goods entrusted to his care are said to be of very rare occurrence.  During the first nights of my stay I was alarmed at every noise, particularly when the watchman, who paraded the streets, happened to strike with his stick upon the stones.  In the event of a conflagration, he must knock at every house-door and cry, \"Fire, fire!\"  Heaven be praised, my fears were never realised.     CHAPTER III.   Scutari--Kaiks--The howling Dervishes--The Achmaidon, or place of arrows--The tower in Galata--The Bazaar at Constantinople--Mosques-- Slave-market--The old Serail--The Hippodrome--Coffee-houses--Story- tellers--Excursion to Ejub--Houses, theatres, and carriages.  I chose a Friday for an excursion to Scutari, the celebrated burying-place of the Turks, in order that I might have an opportunity of seeing the \"howling dervishes.\"  In company with a French physician, I traversed the Bosphorus in a kaik. {48}  We passed by the \"Leander's Tower,\" which stands in the sea, a few hundred paces from the Asiatic coast, and has been so frequently celebrated in song by the poets.  We soon arrived at our destination.  It was with a peculiar feeling of emotion that for the first time in my life I set foot on a new quarter of the globe.  Now, and not till now, I seemed separated by an immeasurable distance from my home. Afterwards, when I landed on the coast of Africa, the circumstance did not produce the same impression on my mind.  Now at length I was standing in the quarter of the earth which had been the cradle of the human race; where man had risen high, and had again sunk so low that the Almighty had almost annihilated him in his righteous anger.  And here in Asia it was that the Son of God came on earth to bring the boon of redemption to fallen man.  My long and warmly-cherished wish to tread this most wonderful of the four quarters of the earth was at length fulfilled, and with God's help I might confidently hope to reach the sacred region whence the true light of the world had shone forth.  [Illustration 3.  Burial Place at Scutari. ill3.jpg]  Scutari is the place towards which the Mussulman looks with the hope of one day reposing beneath its shade.  No disciple of any other creed is allowed to be buried here; and here, therefore, the Mahometan feels himself at home, and worthy of his Prophet.  The cemetery is the grandest in the world.  One may wander for hours through this grove of cypresses, without reaching the end.  On the gravestones of the men turbans are sculptured; on those of the women fruits and flowers:  the execution is in most cases very indifferent.  Though neither the chief nor the tributary streets in Scutari are even, they are neither so badly paved nor quite so narrow as those at Pera.  The great barracks, on a height in the foreground, present a splendid appearance, and also afford a delicious view towards the Sea of Marmora and the inimitably beautiful Bosphorus.  The barracks are said to contain accommodation for 10,000 men.  THE HOWLING DERVISHES.  At two o'clock we entered the temple, a miserable wooden building. Every Mussulman may take part in this religious ceremony; it is not requisite that he should have attained to the rank and dignity of a dervish.  Even children of eight or nine stand up in a row outside the circle of men, to gain an early proficiency in these holy exercises.  The commencement of the ceremony is the same as with the dancing dervishes; they have spread out carpets and skins of beasts, and are bowing and kissing the ground.  Now they stand up and form a circle together with the laymen, when the chief begins in a yelling voice to recite prayers from the Koran; by degrees those forming the circle join in, and scream in concert.  For the first hour some degree of order is still preserved; the performers rest frequently to husband their strength, which will be exerted to the utmost at the close of the ceremony.  But then the sight becomes as horrible as one can well imagine any thing.  They vie with one another in yelling and howling, and torture their faces, heads, and bodies into an infinite variety of fantastic attitudes.  The roaring, which resembles that of wild beasts, and the dreadful spasmodic contortions of the actors' countenances, render this religious ceremony a horrible and revolting spectacle.  The men stamp with their feet on the ground, jerk their heads backwards and forwards, and certainly throw themselves into worse contortions than those who are described as having been in old times \"vexed with a devil.\"  During the exercise they snatch the covering from their heads, and gradually take off all their clothes, with the exception of shirt and trousers.  The two high priests who stand within the circle receive the garments one after another, kiss them, and lay them on a heap together.  The priests beat time with their hands, and after the garments have been laid aside the dance becomes faster and faster.  Heavy drops of perspiration stand on every brow; some are even foaming at the mouth.  The howling and roaring at length reach such a dreadful pitch, that the spectator feels stunned and bewildered.  Suddenly one of these maniacs fell lifeless to the ground.  The priests and a few from the circle hurried towards him, stretched him out flat, crossed his hands and feet, and covered him with a cloth.  The doctor and I were both considerably alarmed, for we thought the poor man had been seized with apoplexy.  To our surprise and joy, however, we saw him about six or eight minutes afterwards suddenly throw off the cloth, jump up, and once more take his place in the circle to howl like a maniac.  At three o'clock the ceremony concluded.  I would not advise any person afflicted with weak nerves to witness it, for he certainly could not endure the sight.  I could have fancied myself among raving lunatics and men possessed, rather than amidst reasonable beings.  It was long before I could recover my composure, and realise the idea that the infatuation of man could attain such a pitch.  I was informed that before the ceremony they swallow opium, to increase the wildness of their excitement!  The Achmaidon (place of arrows) deserves a visit, on account of the beautiful view obtained thence; the traveller should see it, if he be not too much pressed for time.  This is the place which the Sultan sometimes honours by his presence when he wishes to practise archery.  On an open space stands a kind of pulpit of masonry, from which the Sultan shoots arrows into the air without mark or aim.  Where the arrow falls, a pillar or pyramid is erected to commemorate the remarkable event.  The whole space is thus covered with a number of these monuments, most of them broken and weather-stained, and all scattered in the greatest confusion.  Not far from this place is an imperial kiosk, with a garden.  Both promise much when viewed from a distance, but realise nothing when seen from within.  THE TOWER IN GALATA.  Whoever wishes to appreciate in its fullest extent the charm of the views round Constantinople should ascend the tower in Galata near Pera, or the Serasker in Constantinople.  According to my notion, the former course is preferable.  In this tower there is a room with twelve windows placed in a circle, from which we see pictures such as the most vivid imagination could hardly create.  Two quarters of the globe, on the shores of two seas united by the Bosphorus, lie spread before us.  The glorious hills with their towns and villages, the number of palaces, gardens, kiosks, and mosques, Chalcedon, the Prince's Islands, the Golden Horn, the continual bustle on the sea, the immense fleet, besides the numerous ships of other nations, the crowds of people in Pera, Galata, and Topana--all unite to form a panorama of singular beauty.  The richest fancy would fail in the attempt to portray such a scene; the most practised pen would be unequal to the task of adequately describing it.  But the gorgeous picture will be ever present to my memory, though I lack the power of presenting it to the minds of others.  Frequently, and each time with renewed pleasure, I ascended this tower, and would sit there for hours, in admiration of the works of the created and of the Creator.  Exhausted and weary with gazing was I each time I returned to my home.  I think I may affirm that no spot in the world can present such a view, or any thing that can be compared with it.  I found how right I had been in undertaking this journey in preference to any other.  Here another world lies unfolded before my view.  Every thing here is new--nature, art, men, manners, customs, and mode of life.  He who"]]]
