As he did so a sharp shot rang out and Uncle John withdrew his leg hurriedly. He tumbled over to the floor, and seizing his foot in his hand, rocked himself back and forward.  \"Hit?\" asked Chester anxiously.  \"I'm afraid so,\" replied Uncle John, apparently very much frightened.  Chester bent over him.  He looked at the heel of Uncle John's shoe, and then exclaimed.  \"Get up. You are all right. The bullet just carried your heel away.\"  Uncle John rose to his feet.  \"Felt like I had been plugged through the leg,\" he said. \"Just the shock, I guess. Well, what now, boys? We can't get out that way.\"  \"We'll have to go through the door, then,\" said Chester.  He approached and tried the knob.  \"It's locked,\" said Hal. \"I tried it a moment ago. However, that's the way we shall have to go out. Stand back a little.\"  He drew his revolver, put the muzzle to the lock and fired. There was a loud explosion and the room filled with smoke. Hal seized the knob and threw the door open.  \"Where are your guns?\" he asked Chester hurriedly.  \"Robard took them,\" replied Chester.  \"Then they must be in the room. Find them quickly.\"  Chester looked hurriedly about. At last his eyes lighted upon them, on a little table at the far end of the room, where the Austrian had laid them.  \"All right,\" said Chester, picking them up and passing one to Uncle John. \"The sooner we make a start the better.\"  \"Let's go then,\" said Hal.  He poked his head cautiously out the door and looked down the hall. There was no one in sight.  \"Coast clear,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Follow me!\"  He sprang into the hall and started for the front door on a dead run. Chester was right behind him, and Uncle John followed close upon Chester's heels.  Hal was just about to seize the knob in his free hand, when it was turned from the outside.  \"Back, quick,\" called the lad. \"Some one coming.\"  He wheeled about as he spoke and the other two did likewise. They had barely regained their retreat when heavy footsteps were heard in the hall.  \"This way,\" called a voice in German.  The footsteps came toward them, stopped before the door a moment, and then passed on.  \"Now for another trial,\" whispered Hal.  Again he poked his head out and saw that the coast was apparently clear.  \"Come on!\" he cried, and made a second dash for the front door. Chester followed him, as did Uncle John.  This time Hal reached the door without trouble and threw it open. Without pausing, he dashed through it and down the steps. Chester was right behind him. But as Uncle John also would have passed out, there came a shot from behind and he toppled to the floor.  In the excitement neither Chester nor Hal noticed this and they had gone half a block before they discovered that Uncle John was not with them.  \"Great Scott! What can have happened to him?\" exclaimed Chester.  \"Probably got caught,\" replied Hal.  \"Then we must go back after him. Come on.\"  \"Wait a minute,\" said Hal. \"Don't forget this paper we recovered. It must be returned to General Ferrari, Uncle John or no Uncle John.\"  \"But we can't let them kill him!\" cried Chester.  \"They won't kill him,\" said Hal positively. \"They would be afraid to do that. First I must deliver this paper, and then we shall try to rescue Uncle John. But the paper is first. You know that.\"  \"You are right, of course,\" Chester agreed. \"Besides Uncle John knew what he was up against before he came with us. He'll have to wait until we can help him.\"  \"All right, then. Now my idea is for you to wait here while I return this paper to General Ferrari. Then I shall come back and we will see what can be done. If they should take Uncle John from the house you follow them.\"  \"Suits me,\" said Chester. \"Get back as soon as you can.\"  Hal waved a hand and hurried away in the darkness.  \"Guess I'll see if I can learn anything,\" said Chester to himself, after Hal had disappeared.  He approached the embassy cautiously. He could see lights within, but the shades were drawn and he could distinguish nothing. Once he thought he heard sounds of a struggle in the house, but he could not be sure.  He was on the point of entering, but it occurred to him that if he should fall into the enemy's hands he could do Uncle John little good.  \"I'll wait until Hal comes back, anyhow,\" he decided at last.  He walked some distance from the embassy, still remaining close enough to see any one who should leave by the front door, and sat down on the steps before a large stone house.  \"Hope Hal gets a move on,\" he muttered to himself, as he settled himself as comfortably as possible.     CHAPTER VIII.  UNCLE JOHN SHOWS HIS METTLE.   When Uncle John fell to the floor, his first feeling was one of anger. He scarcely felt the sharp pain in his leg, where a bullet had grazed the skin. He saw Chester disappearing ahead of him, and his first thought was to get up and hurry after him.  He pulled himself to his feet and again moved toward the door. As he did so he felt a pair of arms thrown about him from behind. Uncle John turned to give battle to this assailant.  Now Uncle John was a big man and in his youth had been noted for his strength. Time had sapped his prowess, however, and he knew that he was no match for his adversary. Nevertheless, he determined to fight it out.  With an effort he shook off the encircling arms and faced his opponent, who proved to be none other than Robard himself. Bethinking himself of the days of his youth, when he had been considered something of a boxer, Uncle John decided to keep the other at arm's length, if possible. Therefore he squared off in most approved fashion.  It was plain that the Austrian was not an exponent of the art of self-defense and Uncle John sent three hard blows to the man's face, before the latter stepped back and sought to bring his revolver to bear. But Uncle John had no mind to be shot down and he sprang forward and seized the other in a fierce embrace. This style of fighting was more to the Austrian's liking.  A big man himself, he was nothing loath to test Uncle John's wrestling ability. He threw his arms about him, and the two struggled up and down the long hall, panting and gasping.  But the Austrian was a younger man and he soon realized that Uncle John was beginning to tire. The latter realized it also and knew that if he would be successful, it must be immediately. He put a foot in back of the Austrian and pushed hard. Robard lost his balance and fell, but he kept his grip, and Uncle John was pulled to the floor with him.  Uncle John freed an arm and planted his fist squarely in the Austrian's face. The latter gave a cry of rage and shouted for help. Uncle John smiled grimly.  \"You'll need it,\" he said.  Again he raised a fist and brought it down with all his force. The Austrian's arms relaxed their grip. He quivered a bit, and then sank back unconscious. Uncle John got to his feet.  \"I'm not so bad at that,\" he told himself modestly. \"I wish the boys could have been here to see that. Now to get out of here.\"  He moved toward the door, but even as he would have opened it, it moved back and three men stepped inside. They saw Uncle John and the unconscious form of Robard at first glance, and sprang upon Uncle John with a shout.  Uncle John drew a long breath and waded into the midst of them.  The newcomers also proved to be novices in the fistic art, and as long as Uncle John was able to keep them at long range he gave a good account of himself. But, realizing that they were getting the worst of this kind of fighting, one of the men gave a command to close in. In vain Uncle John strove to keep them off. One threw himself to the floor, and avoiding a heavy kick, grasped Uncle John by the leg, pulling him down. The others piled on top of him.  Two minutes later Uncle John had ceased to struggle, and lay powerless in the hands of his captors.  \"Well, you've got me,\" he said. \"Now what?\"  Still keeping a tight grip upon him, the men assisted Uncle John to his feet. One drew a revolver and covered him. The other two went to the assistance of Robard, who was just getting to his feet. The latter came forward with an angry gleam in his eye.  \"So I've got you at last,\" he said. \"Well, I'll see that you don't get away this time.\"  \"You weren't big enough to get me alone,\" said Uncle John, panting from his exertions.  \"I wasn't, eh!\" shouted Robard, now furiously angry. \"I've got you now, and you shall pay. Take that!\"  He dealt Uncle John a heavy blow with the back of his hand.  In his early days Uncle John had been noted for his fiery temper. It was said of him that when his temper was aroused, he became a maniac. So it was now.  Taking no thought of the man who held the revolver almost in his face, Uncle John, his cheek red from the imprint of the Austrian's hand, uttered a cry of rage, and leaped forward. His move was so unexpected that the man with the revolver did not fire, and when at last he had again brought his revolver to bear, he feared to press the trigger lest he might hit his friend as well as foe.  Uncle John, in a moment, was the center of a struggling, shouting mass. His fists flew about like flails and he kicked out with his feet whenever occasion presented itself. One, two, three heavy blows he landed upon Robard's face, and the Austrian suddenly collapsed in a heap. Still fighting mad, Uncle John whirled upon the other three, who now closed with him.  A right-handed jolt caught one of them flush on the jaw and he toppled over backwards without so much as a groan. The other brought a fist heavily to Uncle John's nose, bringing blood, but before he could repeat the blow, Uncle John had placed him hors de combat with a terrific left-handed punch to the abdomen.  Then the third man drew back and presented his revolver, but Uncle John sprang forward with a cry and before the man's finger"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12682"],["title","The Boy Allies in Great Peril; Or, With the Italian Army in the Alps (#7)"],["body","press the trigger, Uncle John had seized him about the middle. Raising him high in the air, he swung him to one side, and the man's head struck the wall with a crunch even as the revolver exploded.  Uncle John dropped the limp body and surveyed the field. His anger had departed and he was again a cool and self-possessed American gentleman of middle age.  \"There's that temper of mine again,\" he said reprovingly to himself. \"Why, I might have killed somebody. After all these years I should have it under control. I guess I'll be moving before some one makes me real mad.\"  He stooped and picked up his hat, which had fallen on the floor, took one last look at his fallen foes, and opened the door and passed out.  Down the street he saw a solitary figure sitting upon the steps in front of a large stone house, and he walked in the other direction.  \"I've had trouble enough for one night,\" he told himself. \"Guess I will give that fellow a wide berth.\"  And had he gone toward the seated figure he would have avoided more trouble for all concerned, and Hal and Chester would probably never have seen active service with the Italian army. For the figure that caused Uncle John to turn his footsteps in the opposite direction was Chester, awaiting the return of Hal.  \"Wonder why those young scalawags didn't come back to help me?\" mused Uncle John, as he walked along toward the hotel. \"I'll tell them what I think of them for running away and leaving me to do all the fighting.\"  Uncle John glanced at his watch.  \"Great Scott!\" he exclaimed. \"Twelve o'clock! Why, it doesn't seem fifteen minutes since we went in that house. Guess Hal and Chester have returned to the hotel by this time. What shall I tell the women folks? They'll wonder what a man of my age is prowling about the streets of Rome for at this hour of the night.\"  He entered his hotel and made his way toward the elevator. It descended, and as he would have entered, he bumped squarely into Mrs. Paine and Mrs. Crawford.  \"John,\" cried the latter, \"where is Chester?\"  \"Where is Hal?\" demanded Mrs. Paine anxiously.  \"Why, they--aren't they--they'll be here in a few minutes,\" stuttered Uncle John.  \"Where are they?\" demanded the two anxious mothers in a single voice.  \"Now hold on here,\" said Uncle John, regaining his composure with an effort. \"I'll explain. Hal and Chester are all right. They'll be here in a few minutes.\"  \"And what on earth is the matter with you, John?\" asked Mrs. Crawford in surprise.  \"What's the matter with me?\"  \"Yes. Your collar is half off, your clothes are dirty and there is blood on your shoe. What is the matter?\"  \"Well, nothing much,\" replied Uncle John in great confusion, \"you see, I had--I had a--\"  \"And were Hal and Chester with you?\" asked Mrs. Paine.  \"Yes, that is no. I mean--\" stuttered Uncle John.  \"Come now, John, no fibbing,\" said Mrs. Crawford. \"You were in trouble, and Hal and Chester were with you. Where are they now?\"  \"Well, to tell the truth, I don't know where they are,\" said Uncle John. \"I supposed they would be here by this time.\"  In a few words he explained what had transpired.  \"They left the house without being hurt?\" asked Mrs. Paine.  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"Then where can they be now?\" demanded Mrs. Crawford.  \"I'm sure I don't know, unless they have stopped for a talk with the general, and that's about the size of it.\"  \"I guess you are right,\" replied Mrs. Paine with relief. \"But why didn't you tell us all this before you went out to-night?\"  \"Yes, why didn't you?\" demanded Mrs. Crawford.  \"Well,\" said Uncle John slowly, \"we didn't want to worry you.\"  \"You are getting too old for such foolishness,\" declared Mrs. Crawford.  \"I thought so myself,\" replied Uncle John, \"but I know better now. If you had seen the licking I handed those four Austrians you would think I was a boy again.\"  \"I'll think you have reached your second childhood if you ever let me hear of anything like it again,\" declared his sister.  Uncle John was growing tired of this conversation. He wanted to be let alone.  \"I'll go out and see if I can find the boys,\" he said.  \"Please do,\" said Mrs. Paine.  \"And see that you keep out of mischief yourself,\" adjured Mrs. Crawford.  Uncle John shook his head as he walked away.  \"These women are funny things,\" he said. \"I wonder what can have happened to those boys? They've probably gone back to look for me. Guess I had better head that way myself. I may come in handy, you never can tell.\"  He patted the revolver, which still rested securely in his pocket.  \"I may have use for this next time,\" he muttered, as he quickened his steps toward the Austrian legation.     CHAPTER IX.  CAPTURED.   Chester rose to his feet, as he saw a figure hurrying toward him.  \"Must be Hal,\" he said.  He was right. A moment later Hal came up to him.  \"Did you give the general the paper?\" asked Chester.  \"Yes. Any one come out of the house?\"  \"I haven't seen any one, and I have been right here all the time you were gone.\"  \"Hear any sounds from within?\"  \"Thought I did several times, but I couldn't be sure. Thought I heard a shot once.\"  \"Well, we had better go and have a look. I don't believe they will harm Uncle John, but he probably is beginning to be worried by this time.\"  He led the way and Chester followed him. Hal mounted the steps without hesitancy and turned the knob of the door. The door opened and the lad stepped inside, where he halted with a cry of surprise. Chester peered over his shoulder.  \"Looks like a cyclone had struck this place,\" Hal ejaculated.  It did indeed. Robard was lying upon the floor, with a man on either side of him, and a fourth lay some distance away, his skull crushed in.  \"Uncle John probably was the cyclone,\" said Chester briefly. \"I have heard that he used to be considerable of a fighter in his younger days.\"  \"And still he could hardly have done all this,\" said Hal.  \"Remember Alexis,\" said Chester sententiously.  \"That's different,\" replied Hal.  \"Well, maybe so, but--\"  Chester broke off and grabbed Hal by the arm.  \"Sh-h-h,\" he whispered.  Hal listened attentively for a few seconds. The faint sound of footsteps could be heard approaching from further back in the house. At the same moment Robard groaned, moved about and sat up. The hands of the two lads dropped to their pockets.  But before they could draw their weapons, they were startled by a voice behind them.  \"Hands up!\" it said.  There was no mistaking the menace in the quiet tones and Hal and Chester realized that the owner of the voice meant business.  \"Good work, Fritz,\" came the voice of Robard, and he pulled himself to his feet with some difficulty and advanced toward the boys. \"I'll thank you for your guns,\" he said. \"No, I'll get them myself,\" he added as both boys moved their hands toward the weapons.  He suited the action to the word and relieved the lads of their automatics.  \"Now stand back there against the wall,\" he commanded.  The boys obeyed.  Robard now gave his attention to the injured men on the floor. Two of them showed signs of returning consciousness and soon were able to get to their feet. The other could not be revived, and at a command from Robard, he was carried to another room.  \"Well, I've got you this time,\" said Robard to Hal and Chester, \"and this time I'll guarantee you don't get away.\"  \"I wouldn't be too sure of that,\" said Hal with a smile. \"We are pretty hard to hold on to.\"  \"I'll hold on to you, never fear,\" was the response. \"I'd like to get my hands on the other.\"  \"Then he has gotten away?\" queried Chester.  \"Oh, yes, he got away all right,\" said Robard with a frown. \"He's as strong as an ox, and a real fighter.\"  \"Then he was responsible for all this human wreckage we found when we came in?\" demanded Hal.  \"He was,\" was the grim reply, \"but the next time I get my hands on him there will be a different story to tell. Why, he's a madman when he gets started.\"  \"Then I would advise you to keep away from him,\" said Hal.  The sound of footsteps outside the door prevented Robard from replying. Levelling a revolver at the lads, he motioned them to be silent, and took up a position at the side of the hall, where he would be concealed by the door when it swung inward.  A hand turned the knob and the door swung back. Uncle John's face appeared in the doorway. He saw Hal and Chester immediately and advanced with a smile.  \"So here you are,\" he said. \"Your mothers--\"  The sentence died on his lips as Robard, who had stepped quietly from behind the door, brought the butt of his heavy revolver down upon his head. Uncle John dropped to the floor like a log.  The action had been so sudden that neither Hal nor Chester had time to give a cry of warning, though both would have done so, in spite of Robard's command for them to remain quiet. As Uncle John fell, Chester stepped forward, but he was confronted by the barrel of Robard's gun.  \"Stand back,\" said the Austrian.  Chester obeyed. There was nothing else he could do in the face of certain death should he refuse.  Now Robard called two of his men, and Uncle John was carried into an adjoining room. Robard motioned Hal and Chester in also.  Uncle John was laid upon the bed, and at a command from Robard, was tightly bound. Hal and Chester were also tied to chairs, after which Robard took his leave, saying:  \"I'll see you the first thing in the morning.\"  \"What are you going to do with us?\" demanded Chester.  \"I haven't decided yet,\" was the reply. \"But wait. If you will return me the paper you took from me I shall let you all go now.\"  \"It's too late,\" said Hal quietly. \"I gave the paper to General Ferrari.\"  \"I had surmised as much,\" said Robard. \"Well, good-night.\"  He waved a hand airily and stepped from the room. Then he turned and poked his head back through the door.  \"A word more,\" he said. \"In case you should unloose your bonds, I would advise you not to try to escape. There will be a man on guard here in the hall all night, and another outside, so you cannot"]]]
