There are two folding cots in the tent, as you see.  Don't shake 'em out until it's time to turn in, and then you'll have more room in your house.  Now, come on over and I'll show you the mess tent for the engineers.\"  This Blaisdell also showed them.  There was nothing in the tent but a plain, long table, with folding legs, and a lot of camp chairs of the simplest kind.  \"What's that tent, Mr. Blaisdell?\" inquired Harry, pointing to the next one, as they came out of the engineers' mess.  \"Mess tent for the chainmen and rod men laborers, etc.,\" replied their guide.  \"Now, the fellows will be in soon, and supper will be on in half an hour.  After you get your dunnage over to your tent amuse yourselves in any way that you care to.  I'll introduce you to the crowd at table.\"  Tom and Harry speedily had their scanty dunnage stored in their own tent.  Then they sat down on campstools just outside the door.  \"Thurston didn't seem extremely cordial, did he?\" asked Hazelton solemnly.  \"Well, why should he be cordial?\" Tom demanded.  \"What does he know about us?  We're trying to break in here and make a living, but how does he know that we're not a pair of merely cheerful idiots?\"  \"I've an idea that Mr. Thurston is always rather cool with his staff,\" pursued Harry.  \"Do your work, old fellow, in an exceptionally fine way, and I guess you'll find that he can thaw out.  Mr. Thurston is probably just like other men who have to employ folks.  When he finds that a man can really do the work that he's paid to do I imagine that Thurston is well satisfied and not afraid to show it.\"  \"What's that noise?\" demanded Harry, trying to peer around the corner of their tent without rising.  \"The field gang coming in, I think,\" answered Tom.  \"Let's get up, then, and have a look at our future mates,\" suggested Harry Hazelton.  \"No; I don't believe it would be a good plan,\" said Tom.  \"We might be thought fresh if we betrayed too much curiosity before the crowd shows some curiosity about us.\"  \"Reade!\" sounded Blaisdell's voice, five minutes later.  \"Bring your friend over and inspect this choice lot of criminals.\"  Tom rose eagerly, followed by Harry.  As they left the tent and hurried outside they beheld two rows of men, each before a long bench on which stood agate wash basins.  The toilet preceding the evening meal was on.  \"Gentlemen,\" Mr. Blaisdell, as the two chums drew near, \"I present two new candidates for fame.  One is named Reade, the other Hazelton. Take them to your hearts, but don't, at first, teach them all the wickedness you know.  Reade, this is Jack Rutter, the spotted hyena of the camp.  If he ever gets in your way just push him over a cliff.\"  A pleasant-faced young man in khaki hastily dried his face and hands on a towel, then smilingly held out his right hand.  \"Glad to know you, Reade,\" he laughed.  Hope you'll like us and decide to stay.\"  \"Hazelton,\" continued the announcer, \"shake hands with Slim Morris, whether he'll let you or not.  And here's Matt Rice.  We usually call him 'Mister' Rice, for he's extremely talented.  He knows how to play the banjo.\"  The assistant engineer then turned away, while one young man, at the farther end of the long wash bench stood unpresented.  \"Oh, on second thoughts,\" continued Blaisdell, \"I'll introduce you to Joe Grant.\"  The last young man came forward.  \"Joe used to be a good fellow---once,\" added the assistant engineer. \"In these days, however, you want to keep your dunnage boxes locked.  Joe's specialty is stealing fancy ties---neckties, I mean.\"  Joe laughed good-humoredly as he shook hands, adding:  \"We'll tell you all about Blaisdell himself, boys, one of these days, but not now.  It's too far from pay day, and old Blaze stands in too thickly with the chief.\"  \"If you folks don't come into supper soon,\" growled the voice of the cook, Jake Wren, from the doorway of the engineer's mess tent, \"I'll eat your grub myself.\"  \"He'd do it, too,\" groaned Slim Morris, a young man who nevertheless weighed more than two hundred pounds.  \"Blaze, won't you take us inside and put us in our high chairs?\"  There was infinite good humor in this small force of field engineers. As was afterwards learned, all of them were graduates either of colleges or of scientific schools but not one of them affected any superiority over the young newcomers.  Just as the party had seated themselves there was a step outside, and Bad Pete stalked in looking decidedly sulky.  \"Evening,\" he grunted, and helped himself to a seat at the table.  \"Reade and Hazelton, you've had the pleasure of meeting Pete, I believe?\" asked Blaisdell, without the trace of a smile.  \"Huh!\" growled Pete, not looking up, for the first supply of food was on the table.  \"We've had the pleasure, twice today, of meeting Mr. Peter,\" replied Tom, with equal gravity.  \"See here, tenderfoot,\" scowled Bad Pete, looking up from his plate, \"don't you call me 'Peter' again.  Savvy?\"  \"We don't know your other name, sir,\" rejoined Tom, eyeing the bad man with every outward sign of courtesy.  \"I'm just plain Pete.  Savvy that?  \"Certainly, Plain Pete,\" Reade nodded.  Pete dropped his soup spoon with a clatter letting his right hand fall to the holster.  \"Be quiet, Pete,\" warned Blaisdell, his eyes shooting a cold glance at the angry man.  \"Reade is a newcomer, not used to our ways yet.  Remember that this is a gentleman's club.\"  \"Then let him get out,\" warned Pete blackly.  \"He belongs here by right, Pete, and you're a guest.  Of course we enjoy having you here with us, but, if you don't care to take us as you find us, the fellows in the chainmen's mess will be glad to have you join them.\"  \"That tenderfoot is only a boy,\" growled Pete.  \"If he can't hold his tongue when men are around, then I'll teach him how.\"  \"Reade hasn't done anything to offend you,\" returned Blaisdell, half sternly, half goodhumoredly.  \"You let him alone, and he'll let you alone.  I'm sure of that.\"  \"Blaisdell, if you don't see that I'm treated right in this mess, I'll teach you something, too,\" flared Bad Pete.  \"Threatening the president of the mess is a breach of courtesy on the part of any guest who attempts it,\" spoke Blaisdell again. \"Gentlemen, what is your pleasure?\"  \"I move,\" suggested Slim Morris quietly, \"that Pete be considered no longer a member or guest of this mess.\"  \"Second the motion,\" cried Rutter, Rice and Grant together.  \"The motion appears to have been carried, without the necessity for putting it,\" declared Mr. Blaisdell.  \"Pete, you have heard the pleasure of the mess.\"  \"Huh!\" scowled Bad Pete, picking up his soup plate and draining it.  Jake Wren, at this moment, entered with a big platter of roast beef, Bob, the helper, following with dishes of vegetables.  Then Bob came in with plates, which he placed before Blaisdell.  The latter counted the plates, finding eight.  \"We shan't need this plate, Bob,\" declared Blaisdell evenly, handing it back.  Then he began to carve.  \"Put that plate back with the rest, Bob, you pop-eyed coyote,\" ordered Bad Pete.  Bob, looking uneasy, started to do so, but Blaisdell waved him away.  At that instant Jake Wren came back into the tent.  \"For the present, Jake,\" went on the assistant engineer, \"serve only for seven in this tent.  Pete is leaving us.\"  \"Do you mean-----\" flared Pete, leaping to his feet and striding toward the engineer.  \"I mean,\" responded Blaisdell, without looking up, \"that we hope the chainmen's mess will take you on.  But if they don't like you, they don't have to do so.\"  For ten seconds, while Pete stood glaring at Blaisdell, it looked as though the late guest would draw his revolver.  Pete was swallowing hard, his face having turned lead color.  \"Won't you oblige us by going at once, Pete?\" inquired Blaisdell coolly.  \"Not until I've settled my score here,\" snarled the fellow.  \"Not until I've evened up with you, you-----\"  At the same time Pete reached for his revolver in evident earnest. Both his words and his movement were nipped short.  Morris and Rice were the only men in the engineers' party who carried revolvers.  They carried weapons, in the day time, for protection against a very real foe, the Rocky Mountain rattlesnakes, which infested the territory through which the engineers were then working.  Both these engineers reached swiftly for their weapons.  Before they could produce them, however, or ore Pete could finish what he was saying, Tom Reade leaped up from his campstool, closing in behind the bad man.  \"Ow-ow!  Ouch!\" yelled Pete.  \"Let go, you painted coyote.\"  \"Walk right out of the tent, and I shall rejoice to let you depart,\" responded Tom steadily.  Standing behind the fellow, he had, with his strong, wiry fingers, gripped Pete hard right over the biceps muscle of each arm.  Like many another of his type Pete had developed no great amount of bodily strength.  Though he struggled furiously, he was unable to wrench himself free from this youth who had trained hard in football training squads.  \"Step outside and cool off, Peter,\" advised Tom, thrusting the bad man through the doorway.  \"Have too much pride, man, to force yourself on people who don't want your company.\"  Reade ran his foe outside a dozen feet, then released him, turning and reentering the tent.  \"No, you don't!  Put up your pistol,\" sounded the warning voice of Cook Jake Wren outside.  \"You take a shot at that young feller, Pete, and I'll never serve you another mouthful as long as I'm in the Rockies!\"  Bad Pete gazed fiercely toward the engineers' tent, hesitated a moment, and then walked wrathfully away.     CHAPTER III  THE DAY OF REAL WORK DAWNS   The meal was finished in peace after that.  It was so hearty a meal that Tom and Harry, who had not yet acquired the keen edge of appetite that comes to hard workers in the Rockies, had finished long before any one else.  \"You fellers had better hurry up,\" commanded Jake Wren finally. \"It'll soon be dark, and I'm not going to furnish"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12734"],["title","The Young Engineers in Colorado; Or, At Railroad Building in Earnest (#4)"],["body","les.\"  As the cook was an autocrat in camp, the engineers meekly called for more pie and coffee, disposed of it and strolled out of the mess tent over to their own little village under canvas.  \"Bring over your banjo, Matt,\" urged Joe.  \"Nothing like the merry old twang to make the new boys feel at home in our school.\"  Rice needed no further urging.  As darkness came down a volume of song rang out.  \"What time do we turn out in the morning?\"  Tom asked, as Mr. Blaisdell brought over a camp stool and sat near them.  \"At five sharp,\" responded the assistant engineer.  \"An hour later we hit the long trail in earnest.  This isn't an idling camp.\"  \"I'm glad it isn't,\" Reade nodded.  Then Blaisdell chatted with the boys, drawing out of them what they knew, or thought they knew, of civil engineering, especially as applied to railroad building.  \"I hope you lads are going to make good,\" said Blaisdell earnestly. \"We're in something of a fix on this work at best, and we need even more than we have, of the very best hustling engineers that can be found.\"  \"I am beginning to wonder,\" said Tom, \"how, when you have such need of men of long training, your New York office ever came to pick us out.\"  \"Because,\" replied the assistant candidly, \"the New York office doesn't know the difference between an engineer and a railroad tie.  Tim Thurston has been making a long yell at the New York offices of the company for engineers.  Knowing the little that they do, our New York owners take anyone who says he's an engineer, and unload the stranger on us.\"  \"I hope we prove up to the work,\" sighed Harry.  \"We're going to size up.  We've got to, and that's all there is to it,\" retorted Tom.  \"We've been thrown in the water here, Harry, and we've got to swim---which means that we're going to do so. Mr. Blaisdell,\" turning to the assistant, \"you needn't worry as to whether we're going to make good.  We _shall_!\"  \"I like your spirit, at any rate, and I've a notion that you're going to win through,\" remarked the assistant.  \"You try out a lot of men here, don't you?\" asked Harry.  \"A good many,\" assented Blaisdell.  \"From what I heard at table,\" Hazelton continued, \"Mr. Thurston drops a good many of the new men after trying them.\"  \"He doesn't drop any man that he doesn't have to drop,\" returned Blaisdell.  \"Tim Thurston wants every competent man that he can get here.  Let me see-----\"  Blaisdell did some silent counting on his fingers.  Then he went on:  \"In the last eleven weeks, Thurston has dropped just sixteen new men.\"  \"Whew!\" gasped Harry, casting a sidelong glance at his shoes, with visions of a coming walk at least as far back as Denver or Pueblo.  \"Mr. Thurston isn't going to drop us,\" Tom declared.  \"Mr. Blaisdell, Hazelton and I are here and we're going to hang on if we have to do it with our teeth.  We're going to know how to do what's required of us if we have to stay up all night finding out.  We've just got to make good, for we haven't any money with which to get home or anywhere else.  Besides, if we can't make good here we're not fit to be tried out anywhere else.\"  \"We're in an especially hard fix, you see,\" the assistant engineer explained.  \"When we got our charter something less than two years ago we undertook to have every mile of track ballasted and laid on the S.B. & L., and trains running through, by September 30th of this year.  There are three hundred and fifty-four miles of road in all.  Now, in July, less than three months from the time, this camp is forty-nine miles from the terminus of the road at Loadstone, while the constructing engineers and the track-layers are thirty-eight miles behind us.  Do you see the problem?\"  \"You can get an extension of time, can't you?\" asked Tom.  \"We can---_not_!  You see, boys, the S.B. & L. is the popular road.  That is, it's the one that the people of this state backed in the main.  When we got our charter from the legislature there was a lot of opposition from the W.C. & A. railroad.  That organization wishes to add to their road, using the very locations that our preliminary engineering force selected for the S.B. & L.  The W.C. & A. folks have such a bewildering number of millions at their back that they would have won away from us, had they been an American crowd.  The W.C. & A. has only American officers and a few small stockholders in this country.  The W.C. & A. is a foreign crowd throughout in reality, and back of them they have about all the money that's loose in London, Paris and Berlin. The W.C. & A. spent a lot of money at the state capital, I guess, for it was common report that some of the members of the legislature had sold out to the foreign crowd.  So, though public clamor carried our charter through the legislature by sheer force, the best concession we could get was that our road must be built and in operation over the entire length by September 30th, or the state has the privilege of taking over our road at an appraised value.  Do you see what that means?\"  \"Does it mean that the state would then turn around and sell this road to the W.C. & A. at a good profit?\" asked Reade.  \"You've hit it,\" nodded Mr. Blaisdell.  \"The W.C. & A. would be delighted to take over our road at a price paid to the state that would give Colorado quite a few millions in profits.  The legislature would then have a chance to spend those millions on public improvements in the state.  I think you will understand why public clamor now seems to have swung about in favor of the W.C.& A.\"  \"Yet it seems to me,\" put in Harry, \"that, even if the S.B. & L. does fail to get the railroad through in time, the stockholders will get their money back when the state takes the road over.\"  \"That, one can never count on,\" retorted Blaisdell, shaking his head.  \"The state courts would have charge of the appraising of the value of the road, and one can never tell just what courts will award.  Ten chances to one the appraisal wouldn't cover more than fifty per cent. of what the S.B. & L. has expended, and thus our company would be many millions of dollars out of pocket. Besides, if the courts could be depended upon to appraise this uncompleted road at twenty per cent. more than has been expended upon it, our company would still lose, for what the S.B. & L. really expects to do is to bag the big profits that can be made out of the section of the state that this road taps.  Take it from me, boys, the officials of this road are crazy with anxiety to get the road through in time, and not lose the many millions that are waiting to be earned by the S.B. & L. getting this road through is all that Tim Thurston dreams of, by night or day. His reputation---and he has a big one in railroad building---is wholly at stake on his carrying this job through.  It'll be a big prize for all of us, professionally, if we can back Thurston's fight to win.\"  \"I'll back it to win,\" glowed Tom ardently \"Mr. Blaisdell, I am well aware that I'm hardly more than the lens cap on a transit in this outfit, but I'm going to do every ounce of my individual share to see this road through and running on time, and I'll carry as much of any other man's burden as I can load onto my shoulders!\"  \"Good!\" chuckled Blaisdell, holding out his hand.  \"I see that you're one of us, heart and soul, Reade.  What have you to say, Hazelton?\"  \"I always let Tom do my talking, because he can do it better,\" smiled Harry.  \"At the same time, I've known Tom Reade for a good many years, and his performance is always as good as his promise. As for me, Mr. Blaisdell, I've just told you that Tom does my talking, but I back up all that he promises for me.\"  \"Pinkitty-plank-plink!\" twanged Matt Rice's banjo, starting into another rollicking air.  \"I guess it's taps, boys,\" called Blaisdell in his low but resonant voice.  \"Look at the chief's tent; he's putting out his candles now.\"  A glance at the gradually darkening walls of the chief engineers big tent showed that this was the case.  \"We'll all turn in,\" nodded Blaisdell.  So Tom and Harry hastened to their tent, where they unfolded their camp cots and set them up.  There was not much bed-making.  The body of the cot was of canvas, and required no mattress.  From out of their baggage each took a small pillow and pair of blankets. At this altitude the night was already rather chilly, despite the fact that it was July.  Rapidly undressing in the dark the young engineers crawled in between their blankets.  \"Well, at last,\" murmured Harry, \"we're engineers in earnest. That is,\" he added rather wistfully, \"if we last.\"  \"We've got to last,\" replied Tom in a low voice, hardly above a whisper, \"and we're going to.  Harry, we've left behind us the playtime of boyhood, and we're beginning real life!  But in that playtime we learned how to play real football.  From now on we'll apply all of the best and most strenuous rules of football to the big art of making a living and a reputation.  Good night, old fellow!  Dream of the folks back in Gridley.  I'm going to.\"  \"And of the chums at West Point and Annapolis,\" gaped Hazelton. \"God bless them!\"  That was not the only short prayer sent up, but within five minutes both youngsters had fallen sound asleep.  The man who can sleep as they did, when the head touches the pillow, has many successes still ahead of him!  Nor did they worry about not waking in season in the morning. Slim Morris had promised to see to it that they were awake on time.  Slam!  Bump!  Tom Reade was positive he had not been asleep more than a minute when that rude interruption came.  He awoke to find himself scrambling up from the ground.  Tom had his eyes open in time to see Harry Hazelton hit the ground with force.  Then Slim Morris retreated to the doorway of the tent.  \"Are you fellows going to sleep until pay days\" Slim demanded jovially.  Tom hustled into his clothes, reached the doorway of the tent and found the sun already well up in the skies.  \"The boys are sitting down to breakfast,\""]]]
