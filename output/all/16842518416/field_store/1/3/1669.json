Aujourd'hui donc, après les actions de grâce adressées au Seigneur, pour nous avoir regardé d'en haut, nous, indignes, il nous est permis de nous réjouir en esprit et de nous féliciter réciproquement de cette grâce et miséricorde divine répandue sur nous. Et à nous, hommes, coopérant à l'œuvre de l'esprit, il nous est permis de vider la coupe avec un ardent soupir, pour la prospérité de l'œuvre et de notre patrie. Première coupe de ce genre sur la terre; car il n'y eût point encore de tel service sur la terre et par conséquent de telle coupe, en nous souvenant qu'il est permis à l'homme de renouveler la sainte cène du Seigneur en élevant l'esprit.     PREMIER TOAST.   Dieu! daigne recevoir à ta gloire cette exposition de l'œuvre de l'Esprit dans les formes terrestres:  Pour ta prospérité, pour que ton nom, ô Seigneur, soit sanctifié, pour la prospérité de la plus sainte cause des peuples; pour la prospérité de notre patrie!     DEUXIÈME TOAST.   La miséricorde du Seigneur, le pardon et le repos, et prompte union avec nous! Ô esprit, cher pour nous, d'un héros, frère, collègue et coopérateur dans l'œuvre sainte. Ô toi, maître illuminé, connaissant de plus près les décrets du Seigneur en faveur de la terre! toi qui, après vingt années de souffrances, par permission supérieure, partages en ce moment notre banquet en esprit, reçois en ce moment notre solennelle assurance [et calme les soucis qui te consument, ô ombre chère!] que nous ferons tous nos efforts pour devenir dociles à tes inspirations, à la direction que, d'après la volonté de Dieu, où tu es plus rapproché, tu nous imprimeras pour la joie, le repos et le salut de ton esprit.     TROISIÈME TOAST.   Pour la prospérité, la bénédiction et la santé du très cher frère qui, par grâce et privilège de Dieu, entrant dans le giron du saint office, a réjoui notre esprit, a rempli notre cœur de joie. Vive ... Qu'il marche dans la paix et la force, conduit par la droite toute-puissante sur le chemin sacré de sa grande destinée."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12308"],["title","Winning His Spurs: A Tale of the Crusades (#0)"],["body","Team.

It was a bright morning in the month of August, when a lad of some fifteen years of age, sitting on a low wall, watched party after party of armed men riding up to the castle of the Earl of Evesham. A casual observer glancing at his curling hair and bright open face, as also at the fashion of his dress, would at once have assigned to him a purely Saxon origin; but a keener eye would have detected signs that Norman blood ran also in his veins, for his figure was lither and lighter, his features more straightly and shapely cut, than was common among Saxons. His dress consisted of a tight-fitting jerkin, descending nearly to his knees. The material was a light-blue cloth, while over his shoulder hung a short cloak of a darker hue. His cap was of Saxon fashion, and he wore on one side a little plume of a heron. In a somewhat costly belt hung a light short sword, while across his knees lay a crossbow, in itself almost a sure sign of its bearer being of other than Saxon blood. The boy looked anxiously as party after party rode past towards the castle.  \"I would give something,\" he said, \"to know what wind blows these knaves here. From every petty castle in the Earl's feu the retainers seem hurrying here. Is he bent, I wonder, on settling once and for all his quarrels with the Baron of Wortham? or can he be intending to make a clear sweep of the woods? Ah! here comes my gossip Hubert; he may tell me the meaning of this gathering.\"  Leaping to his feet, the speaker started at a brisk walk to meet a jovial-looking personage coming down from the direction of the castle. The new comer was dressed in the attire of a falconer, and two dogs followed at his heels.  \"Ah, Master Cuthbert,\" he said, \"what brings you so near to the castle? It is not often that you favour us with your presence.\"  \"I am happier in the woods, as you well know, and was on my way thither but now, when I paused at the sight of all these troopers flocking in to Evesham. What enterprise has Sir Walter on hand now, think you?\"  \"The earl keeps his own counsel,\" said the falconer, \"but methinks a shrewd guess might be made at the purport of the gathering. It was but three days since that his foresters were beaten back by the landless men, whom they caught in the very act of cutting up a fat buck. As thou knowest, my lord though easy and well-disposed to all, and not fond of harassing and driving the people as are many of his neighbours, is yet to the full as fanatical anent his forest privileges as the worst of them. They tell me that when the news came in of the poor figure that his foresters cut with broken bows and draggled plumes--for the varlets had soused them in a pond of not over savoury water--he swore a great oath that he would clear the forest of the bands. It may be, indeed, that this gathering is for the purpose of falling in force upon that evil-disposed and most treacherous baron, Sir John of Wortham, who has already begun to harry some of the outlying lands, and has driven off, I hear, many heads of cattle. It is a quarrel which will have to be fought out sooner or later, and the sooner the better, say I. Although I am no man of war, and love looking after my falcons or giving food to my dogs far more than exchanging hard blows, yet would I gladly don the buff and steel coat to aid in levelling the keep of that robber and tyrant, Sir John of Wortham.\"  \"Thanks, good Hubert,\" said the lad. \"I must not stand gossiping here. The news you have told me, as you know, touches me closely, for I would not that harm should come to the forest men.\"  \"Let it not out, I beseech thee, Cuthbert, that the news came from me, for temperate as Sir Walter is at most times, he would, methinks, give me short shift did he know that the wagging of my tongue might have given warning through which the outlaws of the Chase should slip through his fingers.\"  \"Fear not, Hubert; I can be mum when the occasion needs. Can you tell me farther, when the bands now gathering are likely to set forth?\"  \"In brief breathing space,\" the falconer replied. \"Those who first arrived I left swilling beer, and devouring pies and other provisions cooked for them last night, and from what I hear, they will set forth as soon as the last comer has arrived. Whichever be their quarry, they will try to fall upon it before the news of their arrival is bruited abroad.\"  With a wave of his hand to the falconer the boy started. Leaving the road, and striking across the slightly undulated country dotted here and there by groups of trees, the lad ran at a brisk trot, without stopping to halt or breathe, until after half an hour's run he arrived at the entrance of a building, whose aspect proclaimed it to be the abode of a Saxon franklin of some importance. It would not be called a castle, but was rather a fortified house, with a few windows looking without, and surrounded by a moat crossed by a drawbridge, and capable of sustaining anything short of a real attack. Erstwood had but lately passed into Norman hands, and was indeed at present owned by a Saxon. Sir William de Lance, the father of the lad who is now entering its portals, was a friend and follower of the Earl of Evesham; and soon after his lord had married Gweneth the heiress of all these fair lands--given to him by the will of the king, to whom by the death of her father she became a ward--Sir William had married Editha, the daughter and heiress of the franklin of Erstwood, a cousin and dear friend of the new Countess of Evesham.  In neither couple could the marriage at first have been called one of inclination on the part of the ladies, but love came after marriage. Although the knights and barons of the Norman invasion would, no doubt, be considered rude and rough in these days of broadcloth and civilization, yet their manners were gentle and polished by the side of those of the rough though kindly Saxon franklins; and although the Saxon maids were doubtless as patriotic as their fathers and mothers, yet the female mind is greatly led by gentle manners and courteous address. Thus then, when bidden or forced to give their hands to the Norman knights, they speedily accepted their lot, and for the most part grew contented and happy enough. In their changed circumstances it was pleasanter to ride by the side of their Norman husbands, surrounded by a gay cavalcade, to hawk and to hunt, than to discharge the quiet duties of mistress of a Saxon farm-house. In many cases, of course, their lot was rendered wretched by the violence and brutality of their lords; but in the majority they were well satisfied with their lot, and these mixed marriages did more to bring the peoples together and weld them in one, than all the laws and decrees of the Norman sovereigns.  This had certainly been the case with Editha, whose marriage with Sir William had been one of the greatest happiness. She had lost him, three years before the story begins, fighting in Normandy, in one of the innumerable wars in which our first Norman kings were constantly involved. On entering the gates of Erstwood, Cuthbert had rushed hastily to the room where his mother was sitting with three or four of her maidens, engaged in work.  \"I want to speak to you at once, mother,\" he said.  \"What is it now, my son?\" said his mother, who was still young and very comely. Waving her hand to the girls, they left her.  \"Mother,\" he said, when they were alone, \"I fear me that Sir Walter is about to make a great raid upon the outlaws. Armed men have been coming in all the morning from the castles round, and if it be not against the Baron de Wortham that these preparations are intended, and methinks it is not, it must needs be against the landless men.\"  \"What would you do, Cuthbert?\" his mother asked anxiously. \"It will not do for you to be found meddling in these matters. At present you stand well in the favour of the Earl, who loves you for the sake of his wife, to whom you are kin, and of your father, who did him good liegeman's service.\"  \"But, mother, I have many friends in the wood. There is Cnut, their chief, your own first cousin, and many others of our friends, all good men and true, though forced by the cruel Norman laws to refuge in the woods.\"  \"What would you do?\" again his mother asked.  \"I would take Ronald my pony and ride to warn them of the danger that threatens.\"  \"You had best go on foot, my son. Doubtless men have been set to see that none from the Saxon homesteads carry the warning to the woods. The distance is not beyond your reach, for you have often wandered there, and on foot you can evade the eye of the watchers; but one thing, my son, you must promise, and that is, that in no case, should the Earl and his bands meet with the outlaws, will you take part in any fray or struggle.\"  \"That will I willingly, mother,\" he said. \"I have no cause for offence"]]]
