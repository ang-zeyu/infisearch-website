Following the highways, their way would lead through Prenzlau, Brunswick, and Detmold. But upon Captain Derevaux's advice, they decided to skirt these towns, staying just close enough to the roads to keep their sense of direction.  As the four rode along through the open fields, Hal and Chester continued to talk of Uncle Billy.  \"After the war,\" said Chester, \"we'll come back and get him and take him home with us.\"  But such was not to be; nor was the old Southern negro ever again to see his Virginia home.  And because of the assistance he rendered Hal and Chester and their two friends, it is fitting that here be related the fate of this old plantation slave, who had come so nobly to the aid of our boys.  As the four companions rode away from the old castle, Uncle Billy, with bared head, gazed lovingly after them.  \"Praise de Lawd!\" he exclaimed. \"May dey git home in safety.\"  The riders disappeared in the distance, and the old negro, after one last glance, turned toward his quarters in a broken-down wing of the old castle.  There he threw himself to his knees, and for long minutes prayed in silence. Then he arose, extinguished his light, and crawled into his dirty cot.  Before sun-up he arose, and was soon about his duties of carrying food to others imprisoned in the castle. Upon the order of General Steinberg he went to the vacant cell with the firing squad that was to put an end to the lives of the four companions whom he had aided to escape.  He opened the door, and then threw up his hands in well-feigned surprise.  \"Dere gone!\" he exclaimed.  \"What!\" exclaimed the officer in charge of the firing squad. \"Impossible!\"  He brushed the old negro aside and peered into the cell. Then he turned to Uncle Billy and laid his hand on his shoulder. \"You are under arrest!\" he said.  \"What fo', sah?\"  \"For aiding the prisoners to escape.\"  \"But, but--\"  \"Silence! To the general's quarters!\" he commanded his men.  Uncle Billy was led before General Steinberg.  \"So!\" thundered the latter, after the situation had been explained to him. \"A traitor, eh!\"  Uncle Billy drew himself up proudly, and the years seemed to fall from his shoulders.  \"I is no traitor, sah!\" he said quietly, \"Is I a traitor, sah, because I is willin' ter die fer two li'l chillun, who is so like mah young massa?\"  \"What!\" shouted the general. \"You admit it?\"  \"Yassah!\"  General Steinberg's face grew purple and he waved his arms about angrily.  \"Then you shall die in their stead!\" he shouted. \"Sergeant! Take that black hound out and shoot him! See that my order is carried out at once!\"  The sergeant saluted and turned to Uncle Billy.  \"Come!\" he said.  With bowed head the old negro walked slowly from the hut. Outside the squad of soldiers encircled him, and he was led away.  With his back to a wall and the line of soldiers facing him, their rifles grounded by their sides, Uncle Billy's face turned chalky, and he trembled.  But, as the sergeant approached with a bandage for his eyes, the old negro regained his composure.  For the last time he drew himself to his full height; imperiously he waved the sergeant away, and his eyes met the gaze of his executioners unflinchingly.  \"Ready!\" came the voice of the sergeant.  \"Take aim!\"  \"Fire!\"  Without a murmur, Uncle Billy slid gently to the ground, his body riddled with bullets.  The sergeant hurried to his side, and placed a hand over his heart. As he did so, the body of the old negro twitched, and he made an effort to rise.  The sergeant caught the faint sound of his voice.  \"I'se a-comin', massa; I'se a-co--\" came the old voice in a low whisper; and Uncle Billy's body fell back inert.  The sergeant straightened up, and lifted his cap from his head.  \"He is dead!\" he said softly.     CHAPTER VIII.  IN TROUBLE AGAIN.   All night long the four companions continued their way without adventure. Twice they saw lights of nearby towns, and upon each occasion they bore farther away from these signs of habitation.  The first gray dawn streaked the eastern sky before they drew rein at a little brook, where they sat down to rest for a few moments, and to allow their horses to quench their thirst.  \"How far do you suppose we have come?\" asked Hal.  \"I don't know,\" replied the Frenchman; \"but we have covered considerable ground.\"  \"Do you think we are out of danger?\"  \"We are never out of danger as long as we are in Germany,\" put in the lieutenant. \"We may be safe from pursuit, but we are not out of the woods yet, by any means.\"  \"How long should it take us to get out of the country?\" asked Chester.  \"With luck, five days.\"  \"Well, let's hope for luck, then,\" said Hal. \"I have had enough excitement to last me for a long time to come.\"  \"Same here,\" declared Chester.  They remained in their retreat for some time, and then, mounting, moved forward once more. An hour later they succeeded in purchasing breakfast at a farmhouse. As all were draining their second cup of coffee there came from without the sound of galloping. The four jumped to their feet.  \"What's that?\" cried Chester, in alarm.  \"We'll see,\" replied the young lieutenant briefly, and stepped to a window. The others also advanced and peered over his shoulder.  \"Looks to me like a body of Black Hussars,\" remarked Captain Derevaux.  \"And so it is,\" said the lieutenant, as the horsemen drew closer to the farmhouse.  \"Do you suppose they are looking for us?\" queried Chester.  \"I do not think so. It's hardly likely they have heard of our escape from Stettin.\"  \"Had we better remain here and trust to their passing by, or shall we make a run for it?\"  \"I believe we had better stay here. They may not stop.\"  And, indeed, it seemed that the lieutenant's prophecy would prove correct.  The squadron came on without checking their speed; but, just as they swept by the farmhouse, a squad of a dozen men, headed by an officer, detached themselves from the main body, and headed toward the house.  \"We are in for it again,\" remarked Hal, and drew his revolver.  \"Put that away!\" exclaimed the young captain quickly. \"One shot and the whole troop will be on us!\"  Hal dropped his weapon back into his pocket.  At that instant there came a loud knock at the front door.  The good housewife hastened forward to answer the knock, but was intercepted by the Frenchman.  \"Do not answer!\" he commanded.  The woman stared at him aghast.  \"Why,\" she exclaimed, \"it is probably my husband. He is a cavalry officer, you know,\" and she smiled, and made as if to pass.  But the captain again blocked her way.  \"Nevertheless,\" he said, \"I must ask you not to go to the door.\"  The woman gazed at him a moment in astonishment; then a queer look passed over her face.  \"I see!\" she exclaimed. \"You are spies!\"  With a scream she evaded the captain and rushed to the door.  \"Come!\" cried Captain Derevaux, his effort having failed. \"I guess we shall have to make a run for it!\"  \"Out the back door!\" exclaimed Lieutenant Anderson, and the four ran through the house, went down the steps three at a time, and rushed toward their horses in the stable nearby.  Hardly had they leaped into their saddles and dashed from the stable, when the woman and a German officer appeared in the back door of the farmhouse, while from around the house came the dozen troopers afoot.  With a shout the riders charged directly at them, bowling the soldiers over on all sides, and for a moment it looked as though they might make their escape.  Then a shot rang out, and Chester's horse stumbled and went to his knees. Chester was flung from his saddle, over his horse's head, and struck the ground with stunning force. He lay still.  Hal leaped to the ground and stooped over Chester. The captain and the young lieutenant pulled up their mounts.  As Hal tried to lift Chester to his feet, a second shot was heard, and a bullet whistled over Hal's head. Hal dropped Chester to the ground, and drew his revolver.  He turned his face toward the enemy.  \"Come on!\" he shouted, his eyes flashing, \"I'll drop one or two of you before you get me!\"  But at that moment, the lieutenant's voice rang out.  \"Don't shoot!\" and Hal stayed his hand.  At the same instant, Captain Derevaux and Lieutenant Anderson raised their hands in token of surrender; and it was well that they did so, for by that time the entire body of troopers had their rifles leveled.  To have missed at that distance would have been impossible, and the lieutenant had realized it.  \"Throw your weapons on the ground,\" came a command, and the captain and lieutenant obeyed.  Hal made as if to raise his revolver again, and the rifles of the troopers were turned on him.  Again the lieutenant called:  \"Don't be a fool. Throw that gun down!\"  Hal obeyed.  The officer in command of the troop approached and spoke:  \"Who are you?\" he demanded.  \"Travelers,\" replied Lieutenant Anderson.  \"Where are you going?\"  \"Brunswick.\"  \"Why did you run at our approach?\"  The lieutenant made no reply.  \"Well,\" said the German officer, after a pause, \"if you are bound for Brunswick you will get there all right That is our destination.\"  Captain Derevaux and Lieutenant Anderson had dismounted, and by this time Chester had recovered consciousness.  Calling two of his men, the German officer ordered the four companions bound. Then Chester's saddle was taken from his wounded horse and put upon"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12661"],["title","Canada under British Rule 1760-1900 (#0)"],["body","by the Million Book Project    CANADA UNDER BRITISH RULE 1760-1900  BY  SIR JOHN G. BOURINOT, K.C.M.G., LL.D., LITT.D.  Author of 'Parliamentary Procedure and Practice', 'Constitutional History of Canada,' 'The Story of Canada,' etc  WITH EIGHT MAPS  1900     CAMBRIDGE HISTORICAL SERIES  EDITED BY G. W. PROTHERO, LITT.D., LL.D.  Honorary Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and Late Professor of History in the University of Edinburgh.        GENERAL PREFACE.  The aim of this series is to sketch the history of Modern Europe, with that of its chief colonies and conquests, from about the end of the fifteenth century down to the present time. In one or two cases the story commences at an earlier date: in the case of the colonies it generally begins later. The histories of the different countries are described, as a rule, separately, for it is believed that, except in epochs like that of the French Revolution and Napoleon I, the connection of events will thus be better understood and the continuity of historical development more clearly displayed.  The series is intended for the use of all persons anxious to understand the nature of existing political conditions. \"The roots of the present lie deep in the past\"; and the real significance of contemporary events cannot be grasped unless the historical causes which have led to them are known. The plan adopted makes it possible to treat the history of the last four centuries in considerable detail, and to embody the most important results of modern research. It is hoped therefore that the series will be useful not only to beginners but to students who have already acquired some general knowledge of European History. For those who wish to carry their studies further, the bibliography appended to each volume will act as a guide to original sources of information and works more detailed and authoritative.  Considerable attention is paid to political geography, and each volume is furnished with such maps and plans as may be requisite for the illustration of the text.  G.W. PROTHERO.     PREFACE.  I devote the first chapter of this short history to a brief review of the colonisation of the valley of the St. Lawrence by the French, and of their political and social conditions at the Conquest, so that a reader may be able to compare their weak and impoverished state under the repressive dominion of France with the prosperous and influential position they eventually attained under the liberal methods of British rule. In the succeeding chapters I have dwelt on those important events which have had the largest influence on the political development of the several provinces as British possessions.  We have, first, the Quebec Act, which gave permanent guarantees for the establishment of the Church of Rome and the maintenance of the language and civil law of France in her old colony. Next, we read of the coming of the United Empire Loyalists, and the consequent establishment of British institutions on a stable basis of loyal devotion to the parent state. Then ensued the war of 1812, to bind the provinces more closely to Great Britain, and create that national spirit which is the natural outcome of patriotic endeavour and individual self-sacrifice. Then followed for several decades a persistent popular struggle for larger political liberty, which was not successful until British statesmen awoke at last from their indifference, on the outbreak of a rebellion in the Canadas, and recognised the necessity of adopting a more liberal policy towards their North American dependencies. The union of the Canadas was succeeded by the concession of responsible government and the complete acknowledgment of the rights of the colonists to manage their provincial affairs without the constant interference of British officials. With this extension of political privileges, the people became still more ambitious, and established a confederation, which has not only had the effect of supplying a remarkable stimulus to their political, social and material development, but has given greater security to British interests on the continent of North America. At particular points of the historical narrative I have dwelt for a space on economic, social, and intellectual conditions, so that the reader may intelligently follow every phase to the development of the people from the close of the French r√©gime to the beginning of the twentieth century In my summary of the most important political events for the last twenty-five years, I have avoided all comment on matters which are \"as yet\"--to quote the language of the epilogue to Mr. Green's \"Short History\"--\"too near to us to admit of a cool and purely historical treatment.\" The closing chapter is a short review of the relations between Canada and the United States since the treaty of 1783--so conducive to international disputes concerning boundaries and fishing rights--until the present time, when the Alaskan and other international controversies are demanding adjustment.  I have thought, too, that it would be useful to students of political institutions to give in the appendix comparisons between the leading provisions of the federal systems of the Dominion of Canada and the Commonwealth of Australia. I must add that, in the revision of the historical narrative, I have been much aided by the judicious criticism and apt suggestions of the Editor of the Series, Dr. Prothero.

SECTION I.--Introduction.  Though the principal object of this book is to review the political, economic and social progress of the provinces of Canada under British rule, yet it would be necessarily imperfect, and even unintelligible in certain important respects, were I to ignore the deeply interesting history of the sixteen hundred thousand French Canadians, about thirty per cent of the total population of the Dominion. To apply to Canada an aphorism of Carlyle, \"The present is the living sum-total of the whole past\"; the sum-total not simply of the hundred and thirty years that have elapsed since the commencement of British dominion, but primarily of the century and a half that began with the coming of Champlain to the heights of Quebec and ended with the death of Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham. The soldiers and sailors, the missionaries and pioneers of France, speak to us in eloquent tones, whether we linger in summer time on the shores of the noble gulf which washes the eastern portals of Canada; whether we ascend the St. Lawrence River and follow the route taken by the explorers, who discovered the great lakes, and gave to the world a knowledge of the West and the Mississippi, whether we walk on the grassy mounds that recall the ruins of the formidable fortress of Louisbourg, which once defended the eastern entrance to the St. Lawrence; whether we linger on the rocks of the ancient"]]]
