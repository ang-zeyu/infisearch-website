She picked up the imaginary infant and rocked it in her arms, then set it down and grew it up until she had her hand on the top of the man's head again.  \"That was good, Mom,\" Gofredo told her. \"Now, you and Sonny come along; we'll issue you equipment and find you billets.\" He added, \"What in blazes are we going to feed them; Extee Three?\"         *       *       *       *       *  They gave them replacements for all the things that had been taken away from them. They gave the man a one-piece suit of Marine combat coveralls; Lillian gave the woman a lavender bathrobe, and Anna contributed a red scarf. They found them quarters in one end of a store shed, after making sure that there was nothing they could get at that would hurt them or that they could damage. They gave each of them a pair of blankets and a pneumatic mattress, which delighted them, although the cots puzzled them at first.  \"What do you think about feeding them, Bennet?\" Meillard asked, when the two Svants had gone to bed and they were back in the headquarters hut. \"You said the food on this planet is safe for Terrans.\"  \"So I did, and it is, but the rule's not reversible. Things we eat might kill them,\" Fayon said. \"Meats will be especially dangerous. And no caffeine, and no alcohol.\"  \"Alcohol won't hurt them,\" Schallenmacher said. \"I saw big jars full of fermenting fruit-mash back of some of those houses; in about a year, it ought to be fairly good wine. C_{2}H_{5}OH is the same on any planet.\"  \"Well, we'll get native foodstuffs tomorrow,\" Meillard said. \"We'll have to do that by signs, too,\" he regretted.  \"Get Mom to help you; she's pretty sharp,\" Lillian advised. \"But I think Sonny's the village half-wit.\"  Anna de Jong agreed. \"Even if we don't understand Svant psychology, that's evident; he's definitely subnormal. The way he clings to his mother for guidance is absolutely pathetic. He's a mature adult, but mentally he's still a little child.\"  \"That may explain it!\" Dorver cried. \"A mental defective, in a community of telepaths, constantly invading the minds of others with irrational and disgusting thoughts; no wonder he is rejected and persecuted. And in a community on this culture level, the mother of an abnormal child is often regarded with superstitious detestation--\"  [Illustration]  \"Yes, of course!\" Anna de Jong instantly agreed, and began to go into the villagers' hostility to both mother and son; both of them were now taking the telepathy hypothesis for granted.  Well, maybe so. He turned to Lillian.  \"What did you find out?\"  \"Well, there is a common characteristic in all four sounds. A little patch on the screen at seventeen-twenty cycles. The odd thing is that when I try to repeat the sound, it isn't there.\"  Odd indeed. If a Svant said something, he made sound waves; if she imitated the sound, she ought to imitate the wave pattern. He said so, and she agreed.  \"But come back here and look at this,\" she invited.  She had been using a visibilizing analyzer; in it, a sound was broken by a set of filters into frequency-groups, translated into light from dull red to violet paling into pure white. It photographed the light-pattern on high-speed film, automatically developed it, and then made a print-copy and projected the film in slow motion on a screen. When she pressed a button, a recorded voice said, \"_Fwoonk_.\" An instant later, a pattern of vertical lines in various colors and lengths was projected on the screen.  \"Those green lines,\" she said. \"That's it. Now, watch this.\"  She pressed another button, got the photoprint out of a slot, and propped it beside the screen. Then she picked up a hand-phone and said, \"_Fwoonk_,\" into it. It sounded like the first one, but the pattern that danced onto the screen was quite different. Where the green had been, there was a patch of pale-blue lines. She ran the other three Svants' voices, each saying, presumably, \"Me.\" Some were mainly up in blue, others had a good deal of yellow and orange, but they all had the little patch of green lines.  \"Well, that seems to be the information,\" he said. \"The rest is just noise.\"  \"Maybe one of them is saying, 'John Doe, _me_, son of Joe Blow,' and another is saying, 'Tough guy, _me_; lick anybody in town.'\"  \"All in one syllable?\" Then he shrugged. How did he know what these people could pack into one syllable? He picked up the hand-phone and said, \"Fwoonk,\" into it. The pattern, a little deeper in color and with longer lines, was recognizably like hers, and unlike any of the Svants'.         *       *       *       *       *  The others came in, singly and in pairs and threes. They watched the colors dance on the screen to picture the four Svant words which might or might not all mean _me_. They tried to duplicate them. Luis Gofredo and Willi Schallenmacher came closest of anybody. Bennet Fayon was still insisting that the Svants had a perfectly comprehensible language--to other Svants. Anna de Jong had started to veer a little away from the Dorver Hypothesis. There was a difference between event-level sound, which was a series of waves of alternately crowded and rarefied molecules of air, and object-level sound, which was an auditory sensation inside the nervous system, she admitted. That, Fayon crowed, was what he'd been saying all along; their auditory system was probably such that _fwoonk_ and _pwink_ and _tweelt_ and _kroosh_ all sounded alike to them.  By this time, _fwoonk_ and _pwink_ and _tweelt_ and _kroosh_ had become swear words among the joint Space Navy-Colonial Office contact team.  \"Well, if I hear the two sounds alike, why doesn't the analyzer hear them alike?\" Karl Dorver demanded.  \"It has better ears than you do, Karl. Look how many different frequencies there are in that word, all crowding up behind each other,\" Lillian said. \"But it isn't sensitive or selective enough. I'm going to see what Ayesha Keithley can do about building me a better one.\"  Ayesha was signals and detection officer on the _Hubert Penrose_. Dave Questell mentioned that she'd had a hard day, and was probably making sack-time, and she wouldn't welcome being called at 0130. Nobody seemed to have realized that it had gotten that late.  \"Well, I'll call the ship and have a recording made for her for when she gets up. But till we get something that'll sort this mess out and make sense of it, I'm stopped.\"  \"You're stopped, period, Lillian,\" Dorver told her. \"What these people gibber at us doesn't even make as much sense as the Shooting of Dan McJabberwock. The real information is conveyed by telepathy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lieutenant j.g. Ayesha Keithley was on the screen the next morning while they were eating breakfast. She was a blonde, like Lillian.  \"I got your message; you seem to have problems, don't you?\"  \"Speaking conservatively, yes. You see what we're up against?\"  \"You don't know what their vocal organs are like, do you?\" the girl in naval uniform in the screen asked.  Lillian shook her head. \"Bennet Fayon's hoping for a war, or an epidemic, or something to break out, so that he can get a few cadavers to dissect.\"  \"Well, he'll find that they're pretty complex,\" Ayesha Keithley said. \"I identified stick-and-slip sounds and percussion sounds, and plucked-string sounds, along with the ordinary hiss-and-buzz speech-sounds. Making a vocoder to reproduce that speech is going to be fun. Just what are you using, in the way of equipment?\"  Lillian was still talking about that when the two landing craft from the ship were sighted, coming down. Charley Loughran and Willi Schallenmacher, who were returning to the _Hubert Penrose_ to join the other landing party, began assembling their luggage. The others went outside, Howell among them.  Mom and Sonny were watching the two craft grow larger and closer above, keeping close to a group of spacemen; Sonny was looking around excitedly, while Mom clung to his arm, like a hen with an oversized chick. The reasoning was clear--these people knew all about big things that came down out of the sky and weren't afraid of them; stick close to them, and it would be perfectly safe. Sonny saw the contact team emerging from their hut and grabbed his mother's arm, pointing. They both beamed happily; that expression didn't look sad, at all, now that you knew what it meant. Sonny began ghroogh-ghrooghing hideously; Mom hushed him with a hand over his mouth, and they both made eating gestures, rubbed their abdomens comfortably, and pointed toward the mess hut. Bennet Fayon was frightened. He turned and started on the double toward the cook, who was standing in the doorway of the hut, calling out to him.  The cook spoke inaudibly. Fayon stopped short. \"Unholy Saint Beelzebub, no!\" he cried. The cook said something in reply, shrugging. Fayon came back, talking to himself.  \"Terran carniculture pork,\" he said, when he returned. \"Zarathustra pool-ball fruit. Potato-flour hotcakes, with Baldur honey and Odin flameberry jam. And two big cups of coffee apiece. It's a miracle they aren't dead now. If they're alive for lunch, we won't need to worry about feeding them anything we eat, but I'm glad somebody else has the moral responsibility for this.\"  Lillian Ransby came out of the headquarters hut. \"Ayesha's coming down this afternoon, with a lot of equipment,\" she said. \"We're not exactly going to count air molecules in the sound waves, but we'll do everything short of that. We'll need more lab space, soundproofed.\"  \"Tell Dave Questell what you want,\" Meillard said. \"Do you really think you can get anything?\"  She shrugged. \"If there's anything there to get. How long it'll take is another question.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The two sixty-foot collapsium-armored turtles settled to the ground and went off contragravity. The ports opened, and things began being floated off on lifter-skids: framework for the water tower, and curved titanium sheets for the tank. Anna de Jong said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19076"],["title","Naudsonce (#6)"],["body","about hot showers, and not having to take any more sponge-baths. Howell was watching the stuff come off the other landing craft. A dozen pairs of four-foot wagon wheels, with axles. Hoes, in bundles. Scythe blades. A hand forge, with a crank-driven fan blower, and a hundred and fifty pound anvil, and sledges and cutters and swages and tongs.  Everybody was busy, and Mom and Sonny were fidgeting, gesturing toward the work with their own empty hands. _Hey, boss; whatta we gonna do?_ He patted them on the shoulders.  \"Take it easy.\" He hoped his tone would convey nonurgency. \"We'll find something for you to do.\"  He wasn't particularly happy about most of what was coming off. Giving these Svants tools was fine, but it was more important to give them technologies. The people on the ship hadn't thought of that. These wheels, now; machined steel hubs, steel rims, tubular steel spokes, drop-forged and machined axles. The Svants wouldn't be able to copy them in a thousand years. Well, in a hundred, if somebody showed them where and how to mine iron and how to smelt and work it. And how to build a steam engine.  He went over and pulled a hoe out of one of the bundles. Blades stamped out with a power press, welded to tubular steel handles. Well, wood for hoe handles was hard to come by on a spaceship, even a battle cruiser almost half a mile in diameter; he had to admit that. And they were about two thousand per cent more efficient than the bronze scrapers the Svants used. That wasn't the idea, though. Even supposing that the first wave of colonists came out in a year and a half, it would be close to twenty years before Terran-operated factories would be in mass production for the native trade. The idea was to teach these people to make better things for themselves; give them a leg up, so that the next generation would be ready for contragravity and nuclear and electric power.  Mom didn't know what to make of any of it. Sonny did, though; he was excited, grabbing Howell's arm, pointing, saying, \"_Ghroogh_! _Ghroogh_!\" He pointed at the wheels, and then made a stooping, lifting and pushing gesture. _Like wheelbarrow?_  \"That's right.\" He nodded, wondering if Sonny recognized that as an affirmative sign. \"Like big wheelbarrow.\"  One thing puzzled Sonny, though. Wheelbarrow wheels were small--his hands indicated the size--and single. These were big, and double.  \"Let me show you this, Sonny.\"  He squatted, took a pad and pencil from his pocket, and drew two pairs of wheels, and then put a wagon on them, and drew a quadruped hitched to it, and a Svant with a stick walking beside it. Sonny looked at the picture--Svants seemed to have pictoral sense, for which make us thankful!--and then caught his mother's sleeve and showed it to her. Mom didn't get it. Sonny took the pencil and drew another animal, with a pole travois. He made gestures. A travois dragged; it went slow. A wagon had wheels that went around; it went fast.  So Lillian and Anna thought he was the village half-wit. Village genius, more likely; the other peasants didn't understand him, and resented his superiority. They went over for a closer look at the wheels, and pushed them. Sonny was almost beside himself. Mom was puzzled, but she thought they were pretty wonderful.  Then they looked at blacksmith tools. Tongs; Sonny had never seen anything like them. Howell wondered what the Svants used to handle hot metal; probably big tweezers made by tying two green sticks together. There was an old Arabian legend that Allah had made the first tongs and given them to the first smith, because nobody could make tongs without having a pair already.  Sonny didn't understand the fan-blower until it was taken apart. Then he made a great discovery. The wheels, and the fan, and the pivoted tongs, all embodied the same principle, one his people had evidently never discovered. A whole new world seemed to open before him; from then on, he was constantly finding things pierced and rotating on pivots.         *       *       *       *       *  By this time, Mom was fidgeting again. She ought to be doing something to justify her presence in the camp. He was wondering what sort of work he could invent for her when Karl Dorver called to him from the door of the headquarters hut.  \"Mark, can you spare Mom for a while?\" he asked. \"We want her to look at pictures and show us which of the animals are meat-cattle, and which of the crops are ripe.\"  \"Think you can get anything out of her?\"  \"Sign-talk, yes. We may get a few words from her, too.\"  At first, Mom was unwilling to leave Sonny. She finally decided that it would be safe, and trotted over to Dorver, entering the hut.  Dave Questell's construction crew began at once on the water tank, using a power shovel to dig the foundation. They had to haul water in a tank from the river a quarter-mile away to mix the concrete. Sonny watched that interestedly. So did a number of the villagers, who gathered safely out of bowshot. They noticed Sonny among the Terrans and pointed at him. Sonny noticed that. He unobtrusively picked up a double-bitted ax and kept it to hand.  He and Mom had lunch with the contact team. As they showed no ill effects from breakfast, Fayon decided that it was safe to let them have anything the Terrans ate or drank. They liked wine; they knew what it was, all right, but this seemed to have a delightfully different flavor. They each tried a cigarette, choked over the first few puffs, and decided that they didn't like smoking.  \"Mom gave us a lot of information, as far as she could, on the crops and animals. The big things, the size of rhinoceroses, are draft animals and nothing else; they're not eaten,\" Dorver said. \"I don't know whether the meat isn't good, or is taboo, or they are too valuable to eat. They eat all the other three species, and milk two of them. I have an idea they grind their grain in big stone mortars as needed.\"  That was right; he'd seen things like that.  \"Willi, when you're over in the mountains, see if you can find something we can make millstones out of. We can shape them with sono-cutters; after they get the idea, they can do it themselves by hand. One of those big animals could be used to turn the mill. Did you get any words from her?\"  Paul Meillard shook his head gloomily. \"Nothing we can be sure of. It was the same thing as in the village, yesterday. She'd say something, I'd repeat it, and she'd tell us it was wrong and say the same thing over again. Lillian took recordings; she got the same results as last night. Ask her about it later.\"  \"She has the same effect on Mom as on the others?\"  \"Yes. Mom was very polite and tried not to show it, but--\"  Lillian took him aside, out of earshot of the two Svants, after lunch. She was almost distracted.  \"Mark, I don't know what I'm going to do. She's like the others. Every time I open my mouth in front of her, she's simply horrified. It's as though my voice does something loathsome to her. And I'm the one who's supposed to learn to talk to them.\"  \"Well, those who can do, and those who can't teach,\" he told her. \"You can study recordings, and tell us what the words are and teach us how to recognize and pronounce them. You're the only linguist we have.\"  That seemed to comfort her a little. He hoped it would work out that way. If they could communicate with these people and did leave a party here to prepare for the first colonization, he'd stay on, to teach the natives Terran technologies and study theirs. He'd been expecting that Lillian would stay, too. She was the linguist; she'd have to stay. But now, if it turned out that she would be no help but a liability, she'd go back with the _Hubert Penrose_. Paul wouldn't keep a linguist who offended the natives' every sensibility with every word she spoke. He didn't want that to happen. Lillian and he had come to mean a little too much to each other to be parted now.         *       *       *       *       *  Paul Meillard and Karl Dorver had considerable difficulty with Mom, that afternoon. They wanted her to go with them and help trade for cattle. Mom didn't want to; she was afraid. They had to do a lot of play-acting, with half a dozen Marines pretending to guard her with fixed bayonets from some of Dave Questell's Navy construction men who had red bandannas on their heads to simulate combs before she got the idea. Then she was afraid to get into the contragravity lorry that was to carry the hoes and the wagon wheels. Sonny managed to reassure her, and insisted on going along, and he insisted on taking his ax with him. That meant doubling the guard, to make sure Sonny didn't lose his self-control when he saw his former persecutors within chopping distance.  It went off much better than either Paul Meillard or Luis Gofredo expected. After the first shock of being air-borne had worn off, Mom found that she liked contragravity-riding; Sonny was wildly delighted with it from the start. The natives showed neither of them any hostility. Mom's lavender bathrobe and Sonny's green coveralls and big ax seemed to be symbols of a new and exalted status; even the Lord Mayor was extremely polite to them.  The Lord Mayor and half a dozen others got a contragravity ride, too, to the meadows to pick out cattle. A dozen animals, including a pair of the two-ton draft beasts, were driven to the Terran camp. A couple of lorry-loads of assorted vegetables were brought in, too. Everybody seemed very happy about the deal, especially Bennet Fayon. He wanted to slaughter one of the sheep-sized meat-and-milk animals at once and get to work on it. Gofredo advised him to put it off till the next morning. He wanted a large native audience to see the animal being shot with a rifle.  The water tower was finished, and the big spherical tank hoisted on top of it and made fast. A pump, and a filter-system were installed. There was no water for hot showers that evening, though. They would have to run a pipeline to the river, and "]]]
