And they treat people dreadfully at that place of his. You'd have been driven really crazy before long, and then your mind would have been closed to me, so that I wouldn't have been able to get through to you, any more. What I did was the only thing I could do.\"  \"I don't hate you, Dearest,\" he replied, mentally. \"And I don't blame you. It was a little disconcerting, though, to discover the extent of your capabilities.... How did you manage it?\"  \"You remember how I made the Sergeant see an angel, the time you were down in the snow?\" Colonel Hampton nodded. \"Well, I made her see ... things that weren't angels,\" Dearest continued. \"After I'd driven her almost to distraction, I was able to get into her mind and take control of her.\" Colonel Hampton felt a shudder inside of him. \"That was horrible; that woman had a mind like a sewer; I still feel dirty from it! But I made her get the pistol--I knew where you kept it--and I knew how to use it, even if she didn't. Remember when we were shooting muskrats, that time, along the river?\"  \"Uhuh. I wondered how she knew enough to unlock the action and load the chamber.\" He turned and faced the others.  Doctor Vehrner was sitting on the floor, with his back to the chair Colonel Hampton had occupied, his injured leg stretched out in front of him. Albert was hovering over him with mother-hen solicitude. T. Barnwell Powell was finishing his whiskey and recovering a fraction of his normal poise.  \"Well, I suppose you gentlemen see, now, who was really crazy around here?\" Colonel Hampton addressed them bitingly. \"That woman has been dangerously close to the borderline of sanity for as long as she's been here. I think my precious nephew trumped up this ridiculous insanity complaint against me as much to discredit any testimony I might ever give about his wife's mental condition as because he wanted to get control of my estate. I also suppose that the tension she was under here, this afternoon, was too much for her, and the scheme boomeranged on its originators. Curious case of poetic justice, but I'm sorry you had to be included in it, Doctor.\"  \"Attaboy, Popsy!\" Dearest enthused. \"Now you have them on the run; don't give them a chance to re-form. You know what Patton always said--Grab 'em by the nose and kick 'em in the pants.\"  Colonel Hampton re-lighted his cigar. \"Patton only said 'pants' when he was talking for publication,\" he told her, _sotto voce_. Then he noticed the unsigned commitment paper lying on the desk. He picked it up, crumpled it, and threw it into the fire.  \"I don't think you'll be needing that,\" he said. \"You know, this isn't the first time my loving nephew has expressed doubts as to my sanity.\" He sat down in the chair at the desk, motioning to his servant to bring him a drink. \"And see to the other gentlemen's glasses, Sergeant,\" he directed. \"Back in 1929, Stephen thought I was crazy as a bedbug to sell all my securities and take a paper loss, around the first of September. After October 24th, I bought them back at about twenty per cent of what I'd sold them for, after he'd lost his shirt.\" That, he knew, would have an effect on T. Barnwell Powell. \"And in December, 1944, I was just plain nuts, selling all my munition shares and investing in a company that manufactured baby-food. Stephen thought that Rundstedt's Ardennes counter-offensive would put off the end of the war for another year and a half!\"  \"Baby-food, eh?\" Doctor Vehrner chuckled.  Colonel Hampton sipped his whiskey slowly, then puffed on his cigar. \"No, this pair were competent liars,\" he replied. \"A good workmanlike liar never makes up a story out of the whole cloth; he always takes a fabric of truth and embroiders it to suit the situation.\" He smiled grimly; that was an accurate description of his own tactical procedure at the moment. \"I hadn't intended this to come out, Doctor, but it happens that I am a convinced believer in spiritualism. I suppose you'll think that's a delusional belief, too?\"  \"Well....\" Doctor Vehrner pursed his lips. \"I reject the idea of survival after death, myself, but I think that people who believe in such a theory are merely misevaluating evidence. It is definitely not, in itself, a symptom of a psychotic condition.\"  \"Thank you, Doctor.\" The Colonel gestured with his cigar. \"Now, I'll admit their statements about my appearing to be in conversation with some invisible or imaginary being. That's all quite true. I'm convinced that I'm in direct-voice communication with the spirit of a young girl who was killed by Indians in this section about a hundred and seventy-five years ago. At first, she communicated by automatic writing; later we established direct-voice communication. Well, naturally, a man in my position would dislike the label of spirit-medium; there are too many invidious associations connected with the term. But there it is. I trust both of you gentlemen will remember the ethics of your respective professions and keep this confidential.\"  \"Oh, brother!\" Dearest was fairly hugging him with delight. \"When bigger and better lies are told, we tell them, don't we, Popsy?\"  \"Yes, and try and prove otherwise,\" Colonel Hampton replied, around his cigar. Then he blew a jet of smoke and spoke to the men in front of him.  \"I intend paying for my nephew's hospitalization, and for his wife's funeral,\" he said. \"And then, I'm going to pack up all his personal belongings, and all of hers; when he's discharged from the hospital, I'll ship them wherever he wants them. But he won't be allowed to come back here. After this business, I'm through with him.\"  T. Barnwell Powell nodded primly. \"I don't blame you, in the least, Colonel,\" he said. \"I think you have been abominably treated, and your attitude is most generous.\" He was about to say something else, when the doorbell tinkled and Sergeant Williamson went out into the hall. \"Oh, dear; I suppose that's the police, now,\" the lawyer said. He grimaced like a small boy in a dentist's chair.  Colonel Hampton felt Dearest leave him for a moment. Then she was back.  \"The ambulance.\" Then he caught a sparkle of mischief in her mood. \"Let's have some fun, Popsy! The doctor is a young man, with brown hair and a mustache, horn-rimmed glasses, a blue tie and a tan-leather bag. One of the ambulance men has red hair, and the other has a mercurochrome-stain on his left sleeve. Tell them your spirit-guide told you.\"  The old soldier's tobacco-yellowed mustache twitched with amusement.  \"No, gentlemen, it is the ambulance,\" he corrected. \"My spirit-control says....\" He relayed Dearest's descriptions to them.  T. Barnwell Powell blinked. A speculative look came into the psychiatrist's eyes; he was probably wishing the commitment paper hadn't been destroyed.  Then the doctor came bustling in, brown-mustached, blue-tied, spectacled, carrying a tan bag, and behind him followed the two ambulance men, one with a thatch of flaming red hair and the other with a stain of mercurochrome on his jacket-sleeve.  For an instant, the lawyer and the psychiatrist gaped at them. Then T. Barnwell Powell put one hand to his mouth and made a small gibbering sound, and Doctor Vehrner gave a faint squawk, and then both men grabbed, simultaneously, for the whiskey bottle.  The laughter of Dearest tinkled inaudibly through the rumbling mirth of Colonel Hampton.

WEEKES _R.P._       _Episc. Lond. Cap._         _Domest._    [Decoration]     To the Reader.   _If amongst thy leisure houres thou canst spare any for the perusall of this discourse, and dost looke to finde somewhat in it which may serve for thy information and benefit: let me then advise thee to come unto it with an equall minde, not swayed by prejudice, but indifferently resolved to assent unto that truth which upon deliberation shall seeme most probable unto thy reason, and then I doubt not, but either thou wilt agree with mee in this assertion, or at least not thinke it to be as farre from truth, as it is from common opinion._  _Two cautions there are which I would willingly admonish thee of in the beginning._  1. _That thou shouldst not here looke to find any exact, accurate    Treatise, since this discourse was but the fruit of some lighter    studies, and those too hudled up in a short time, being first    thought of and finished in the space of some few weekes, and    therefore you cannot in reason expect, that it should be so    polished, as perhaps, the subject would require, or the leisure    of the Author might have done it._  2. _To remember that I promise onely probable arguments for the    proofe of this opinion, and therefore you must not looke that every    consequence should be of an undeniable dependance, or that the truth    of each argument should be measured by its necessity. I grant that    some Astronomicall appearances may possibly be solved otherwise then    here they are. But the thing I aime at is this, that probably they    may so be solved, as I have here set them downe: Which, if it be    granted (as I thinke it must) then I doubt not, but the indifferent    reader will find some satisfaction in the maine thing that is to be    proved._  _Many ancient Philosophers of the better note, have formerly defended this assertion, which I have here laid downe, and it were to be wished, that some of us would more apply our endeavours unto the examination of these old opinions, which though they have for a long time lien neglected by others, yet in them may you finde many truths well worthy your paines and observation. Tis a false conceit, for us to thinke, that amongst the ancient variety and search of opinions, the best hath still prevailed. Time (saith the learned _Verulam_) seemes to be of the nature of a river or streame, which carrieth downe to us that which is light, or blowne up, but sinketh that which is weighty and solid._  _It is my desire that by the occasion of this discourse, I may raise up some more active spirit to a search after other hidden and unknowne truthes. Since it must needes be a great impediment unto the growth of sciences, for men still so to plod on upon beaten principles, as to be afraid of entertaining any thing that may seeme to contradict them. An unwillingnesse to take such things into examination, is one of those errours of learning in these times observed by the judicious _Verulam_. Questionlesse there are many secret truths, which the ancients have passed over, that are yet left to make some of our age famous for their discovery._  _If by this occasion I may provoke any reader to an attempt of this nature, I shall then thinke my selfe happy, and this work successefull._  Farewell.       [Decoration]   The First Proposition, by way of Preface.  _That the strangenesse of this opinion is no sufficient reason why it   should be rejected, because other certaine truths have beene formerly   esteemed ridiculous, and great absurdities entertayned by common   consent._   There is an earnestnesse and hungering after novelty, which doth still adhere unto all our natures, and it is part of that primative image, that wide extent and infinite capacity at first created in the heart of man, for this since its depravation in _Adam_ perceiving it selfe altogether emptied of any good doth now catch after every new thing, conceiving that possibly it may finde satisfaction among some of its fellow creatures. But our enemy the divell (who strives still to pervert our gifts, and beate us with our owne weapons) hath so contriv’d it, that any truth doth now seeme distastefull for that very reason, for which errour is entertain’d--Novelty, for let but some upstart heresie be set abroach, and presently there are some out of a curious humour; others, as if they watched an occasion of singularity, will take it up for canonicall, and make it part of their creede and profession; whereas solitary truth cannot any where finde so ready entertainement; but the same Novelty which is esteemed the commendation of errour and makes that acceptable, is counted the fault of truth, and causes that to bee rejected. How did the incredulous World gaze at _Columbus_ when hee promised to discover another part of the earth, and he could not for a long time by his confidence, or arguments, induce any of the Christian Princes, either to assent unto his opinion, or goe to the charges of an experiment. Now if he who had such good grounds for his assertion, could finde no better entertainement among the wiser sort, and upper end of the World; ’tis not likely then that this opinion which I now deliver, shall receive any thing from the men of these daies, especially our vulgar wits, but misbeliefe or derision. It hath alwaies beene the unhappinesse of new truths in Philosophy, to be derided by those that are ignorant of the causes of things, and reiected by others whose perversenesse ties them to the contrary opinion, men whose envious pride will not allow any new thing for truth which they themselves were not the first inventors of. So that I may iustly expect to be accused of a pragmaticall ignorance, and bold ostentation, especially since for this opinion _Xenophanes_, a man whose authority was able to adde some credit to his assertion could not escape the like censure from others. For _Natales Comes_ speaking of that Philosopher,[1] and this his opinion, saith thus,    _Nonnulli ne nihil scisse videantur, aliqua nova monstra in   Philosophiã introducunt, ut alicujus rei inventores fuisse appareant._    “Some there are who least they might seeme to know nothing, will   bring up monstrous absurdities in Philosophy, that so afterward they   may bee famed for the invention of somewhat.”  The same author doth also in another place accuse _Anaxagoras_[2] of folly for the same opinion,    _Est enim non ignobilis gradus stultitiæ, vel si nescias quid dicas,   tamen velle de rebus propositis hanc vel illam partem stabilire._  “’Tis none of the worst kindes of folly, boldly to affirme one side or other, when a man knows not what to say.”    [Sidenote 1: _Mytholog. lib. 3. c. 17._]    [Sidenote 2: _Lib. 7. c. 1._]  If these men were thus censur’d, I may iustly then expect to be derided by most, and to be believed by few or none; especially since this opinion seemes to carry in it so much strangenesse, so much contradiction to the generall consent of others. But how ever, I am resolved that this shall not be any discouragement, since I know that it is not the common opinion of others that can either adde or detract from the truth. For,  1. Other truths have beene formerly esteemed altogether as ridiculous    as this can be.  2. Grosse absurdities have beene entertained by generall opinion.  I shall give an instance of each, that so I may the better prepare the Reader to consider things without a prejudice, when hee shall see that the common opposition against this which I affirme cannot any way derogate from its truth.  1. Other truths have beene formerly accounted as ridiculous as this, I shall specifie that of the Antipodes, which have beene denied and laught at by many wise men and great Schollers, such as were _Herodotus_, St. _Austin_, _Lactantius_, the _Venerable Bede_, _Lucretius_ the Poet, _Procopius_, and the voluminous _Abulensis_ with others."]]]
