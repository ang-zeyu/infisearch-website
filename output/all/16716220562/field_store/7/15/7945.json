A robin redbreast, fluting there       Upon the apple-bough,     Is telling all the world how fair       Are apple-blossoms now;     The honey-dew its sweetness spills       From cuckoo-cups, and all     The crocuses and daffodils       Are drest for festival!      Such pretty things are to be seen,       Such pleasant things to do,     The April earth it is so green,       The April sky so blue,     The path from dawn to even-song       So joyous is to-day,     Up, little ones! and dance along       The lilac-scented way!     DANDELIONS       Hey-a-day-a-day, my dear! Dandelion time!     Come, and let us make for them a pretty little rhyme!      See the meadows twinkling now, beautiful and bright     As the sky when through the blue shine the stars at night!      Once upon a time, folks say, mighty kings of old     Met upon a splendid field called \"The Cloth of Gold.\"      But, we wonder, could it be there was ever seen     Brighter gold than glitters now in our meadows green?      Dandelions, dandelions, shining through the dew,     Let the kings have Cloth of Gold, but let _us_ have _you_!     OUR PUPPIES       Little ears as soft as silk,     Little teeth as white as milk,     Little noses cool and pink,     Little eyes that blink and blink,     Little bodies round and fat,     Little hearts that pit-a-pat,     Surely prettier puppies never     Were before nor can be ever!     THE LOST BALLOON       O dear! my purple toy balloon     Has flown away! and very soon     It will be high up as the moon!      And don't you think the man up there     Will wonder what it is, and stare?     Perhaps hell say, \"_Well, I declare!_\"      Or, maybe if it chance there are     Some little boys in yonder star,     And if it floats away so far,      Perhaps they'll jump up very high     And catch the cord as it goes by!     At any rate I hope they'll try!     THE CIRCUS PROCESSION       _Oh, hurry! hurry!_ here they come,     The band in front with the big bass drum     And blaring bugles,--there they are,     On golden thrones in a golden car,     Tooting and fluting, oh, how grand!                 Hi diddle, diddle!                 The fife and the fiddle!     _Hurrah, hurrah_ for the circus band!      And the red-plumed horses, oh, see them prance     And daintily lift their hoofs and dance,     While beautiful ladies with golden curls     Are jingling their bridles of gold and pearls,                 And close behind                 Come every kind     Of animal cages great and small,     O how I wonder what's in them all!      Here's one that's open and glaring there     Is the shaggiest snow-white polar bear!     _Woof!_ but I wonder what we'd do     If his bars broke loose right now, don't you?                 And O dear me!                 Just look and see     That pink-cheeked lady in skirts of gauze     And the great big lion with folded paws!                 O me! O my!                 I'm glad that I     Am not in that lion's cage, because     _Suppose he'd open his horrible jaws!_     --But look! the clown is coming! Of course     Facing the tail of a spotted horse     And shouting out things to make folks laugh,     And grinning up at the tall giraffe     That placidly paces along and looks     Just like giraffes in the picture-books!      And there are the elephants, two and two,     Lumbering on as they always do!     The men who lead them look so small     I wonder the elephants mind at all                 As they wag their queer                 Long trunks, and peer     Through their beady eyes,--folks say they know     No end of things, and I'm sure it's so!     And you never must do a thing that's bad     Or that possibly might make an elephant mad,     For he'll never forgive you, it appears,     And will punish you sure, if it takes him _years!_                 So do not stare                 But take good care     To mind your manners, and always try     To smile politely as they go by!      But the camels don't care if you laugh at them     With their bumpy humps like a capital M,                 They lurch and sway                 And seem to say,     As they wrinkle their noses, long and gray,     \"This swaggering stride is quite the plan,     It's the way we walked in the caravan!\"      And now more cages come rumbling by     With glittering people throned on high;     So many spangles and precious things,     They surely must all be queens and kings!                 They look so proud                 Above the crowd,     O my, how fine it must feel to ride     On golden wagons that hide inside     Strange animals caught in cannibal isles     And brought in ships for a million miles!                 But hark! it's near                 The end, for hear     That sudden screeching in piercing key!     The steaming, screaming _cal-li-o-pe_!     Just plain pianos sound terribly tame     Beside this one with the wonderful name,     And wouldn't you love some day to sit     In a circus wagon and play on it?     MAY-BASKETS       Let us take our baskets early       To the meadows green,     While the wild-flowers still are pearly       With the dewdrops' sheen.      Fill them full of blossoms rosy,       Violets and gay     Cowslips, every pretty posy       Welcoming the May.      Then our lovely loads we'll carry       Down the village street,     On each door, with laughter merry,       Hang a basket sweet.      Hey-a-day-day! It is spring now,       Lazy folks, awake!     See the pretty things we bring now       For the May-day's sake!     THE PICTURE-BOOK GIANT       Once there was a fierce, defiant,     Greedy, grumpy, grizzly giant       In the pages of a picture-book, and he     Sometimes screamed, in sudden rages,     \"I must jump out from these pages,       For this life's a much too humdrum one for me!                   Fiddle-dee!       Yes, this life's a quite too quiet one for me!\"      So one rainy day he did it,     Took the picture-book and hid it,       Stamped his foot, and shouting loudly,           \"Now I'm free!\"     Boldly started out, forgetting     That he could not stand a wetting!     He was just a paper giant, don't you see?               Dearie me!     Just a gaudy, picture giant, don't you see?     DID YOU EVER?       Did you ever see a fairy in a rose-leaf coat and cap     Swinging in a cobweb hammock as he napped his noonday nap?      Did you ever see one waken very thirsty and drink up     All the honey-dew that glimmered in a golden buttercup?      Did you ever see one fly away on rainbow-twinkling wings?     If you did not, why, how comes it that you never see such things?     DECORATION DAY       See the soldiers, little ones!       Hark the drummers' beat!     See them with their flags and guns       Marching down the street!      Tattered flags from out the wars,       Let us follow these     To the little stripes and stars       Twinkling through the trees.      Watch them waving through the grass       Where the heroes sleep!

Let us bring our blossoms, too,       All our gardens grow;     Lilacs honey-sweet with dew,       And the lilies' snow.      Every posy of the May,       Every bloomy stem,     Every bud that breaks to-day       Gather now for them.      Lay the lilies o'er them thus,       Lovingly, for so     Down they laid their lives for us,       Long and long ago.      Heap above them bud and bough;       Softly, ere we cease,     God, we pray Thee, gently now       Fold them in Thy peace!     CHU-CHU CARS       Turn the chairs down in a row     Each behind the other, so;     _Chu-chu! Chu-chu!_ there they are,     Passenger and baggage-car,     _Chu-chu-chu!_ the Morris chair     Is the engine puffing there,     _Chu-chu! Chu-chu! Ting-a-ling!_     Don't you hear its big bell ring?     All aboard! Jump on! if you     Want to take this train. _Chu-chu!!_     Off we start now, rushing fast     Through the fields and valleys, past     Noisy cities, over bridges,     Hills and plains and mountain ridges,     _Chu-chu! Chu-chu! Chu-chu-chu!!_     At such speed it must be true     Since we started we have come     Most a million miles from home!     Jump off, some one! Quick! and go     To the pantry, for, you know,     We must have the cookie-jar     For our Pullman dining-car!     FAIRY RINGS       Softly in the gloaming       Flitting through the vale,     Fairy folk are roaming       Over hill and dale.      Pixies in the hollow,       Elves upon the height,     Let us follow, follow       Through the paling light.      Follow, all unbidden,       To the grassy glade     Wrapped around and hidden       In the forest shade.      Hark the elfin tinkle       Of their little lutes!     Mark the golden twinkle       Of their fairy flutes!  [Illustration: FAIRY RINGS]      See them dancing, dancing,       While the silver moon     Tips their swiftly glancing       Little silver shoon!      Tripping, tripping lightly,       Where their footprints fall,     Look! the grass is brightly       Growing green and tall!      Springing close, unbroken,       In a fairy ring,     For to-morrow's token       Of their frolicking!     THE FIREFLY       Flash and flicker and fly away,       Trailing light as you flutter far,     Are you a lamp for the fairies, say?       Or a flake of fire from a falling star?     A RAIN SONG                 Tinkle, tinkle,                 Lightly fall       On the peach buds, pink and small;     Tip the tiny grass, and twinkle       On the clover, green and tall.                Tinkle, tinkle,--                 Faster now,       Little rain-drops, smite and sprinkle     Cherry-bloom and apple-bough!     Pelt the elms, and show them how               You can dash!                 And splash! splash! splash!     While the thunder rolls and mutters,       And the lightnings flash and flash!               Then eddy into curls               Of a million misty swirls,     And thread the air with silver, and embroider it with pearls!      And patter, patter, patter     To a quicker time, and clatter       On the streaming window-pane;               Rain, rain,                 On the leaves,                   And the eaves,       And the turning weather-vane!      Rush in torrents from the tip     Of the gable-peak, and drip       In the garden-bed, and fill         All the cuckoo-cups, and pour               More and more       In the tulip-bowls, and still                 Overspill       In a crystal tide until       Every yellow daffodil     Is flooded to its golden rim, and brimming o'er and o'er!      Then as gently as the low       Muffled whir of robin wings,       Or a sweep of silver strings,                 Even so,         Take your airy April flight         Through the merry April light,     And melt into a mist of rainy music as you go!     FAIRIES       Grandfather says that sometimes,       When stars are twinkling and     A new moon shines, there come times       When folks see fairy-land!      So when there's next a new moon,       I mean to watch all night!     Grandfather says a blue moon       Is best for fairy light,      And in a peach-bloom, maybe,       If I look I shall see     A little fairy baby       No bigger than a bee!     THE LITTLE FIR-TREES       Hey! little evergreens,       Sturdy and strong!     Summer and autumn time       Hasten along;     Harvest the sunbeams, then,       Bind them in sheaves,     Range them, and change them       To tufts of green leaves.     Delve in the mellow mold,       Far, far below,             And so,       Little evergreens, grow!             Grow, grow!     Grow, little evergreens, grow!      Up, up so airily       To the blue sky,     Lift up your leafy tips       Stately and high;     Clasp tight your tiny cones,       Tawny and brown;     By and by, buffeting       Rains will pelt down;     By and by, bitterly       Chill winds will blow;             And so,       Little evergreens, grow!             Grow, grow!     Grow, little evergreens, grow!      Gather all uttermost       Beauty, because,--     Hark, till I tell it now!       How Santa Claus,     Out of the northern land,       Over the seas,     Soon shall come seeking you,       Evergreen trees!     Seek you with reindeer soon,       Over the snow;             And so,       Little evergreens, grow!             Grow, grow!     Grow, little evergreens, grow!      What if the maples flare       Flaunting and red,     You shall wear waxen white       Tapers instead!     What if now, otherwhere,       Birds are beguiled,     You shall yet nestle       The little Christ-child!     Ah! the strange splendor       The fir-trees shall know!             And so,       Little evergreens, grow!             Grow, grow!     Grow, little evergreens, grow!     THE WREN-HOUSE       Yesterday I took my saw       And some bits of wood,     And I made a little house       Nicely as I could.      I put on a mossy-green       Little pointed roof,     And I cut a tiny door       That is pussy-proof.      For I hope some little wrens       To our yard will come     And will choose my little house       For their little home.      I shall hang it in the boughs       Of the apple-tree,     And I'm sure as rent for it       They will sing to me!     THE BABY'S RIDE       Chee! Chee! Chickadee!       Sing-time and sun!     Aye, aye, baby-bye,       Springtime has begun!         *       *       *       *       *      In the little willow cart,       On a downy bed,     Pretty parasol of silk       Swinging overhead,      Let us go along the lane       Where a baby sees     Mighty tufts of grass, and weeds       Tall as forest trees!      Bluebird on the apple-bough,       Sing and sing and sing!     Sing your very sweetest now       For babyhood and spring!         *       *       *       *       *      \"Bah! Bah!\" from the pasture,       And \"Caw! Caw!\" from the crow,     And bleating from the little calf       That has not learned to low.         *       *       *       *       *      Apple-buds, apple-buds breaking apart,       The baby looks upward with love-laden gaze;     Oh, shower some petals down here in his cart,       One honey-sweet cluster of pretty pink sprays!      Apple-buds, apple-buds, scornful and too       Vain of your loveliness, stay where you are!     The cheeks of the baby are pinker than you,       And finer and softer and sweeter by far!         *       *       *       *       *      See the pretty little lambs,       How they frisk and play!     See their silky fleeces shine       White as buds in May!      White as are the fleecy clouds       Softly blowing by--     What if they were little lambs       Playing in the sky?         *       *       *       *       *      Robin on the peach-bough,       Swinging overhead,     Sing a little song and say       Why is your breast so red?      Why is your voice so sweet, and       Your song so merry, say?     And wherefore do you spread your wings       And quickly fly away?         *       *       *       *       *      Ho, ho! see the queer little prints there       That cover the road, baby, look!     At the web-footed tangle that hints where       The ducks have gone down to the brook!      The Muscovy mammas that waddled       Zigzag, you can trace in their tracks,     And the dear little ducklings that toddled       And tumbled sometimes on their backs!         *       *       *       *       *      Buttercup, buttercup, buttercup gold,     O give us a handful of riches to hold!      Ho, ho! laughs the baby, and grasps in his glee     His wealth, but soon shows what a spend-thrift is he!     --Nay, nay, he is king, though he never was crowned,     And royally scatters his gold on the ground!         *       *       *       *       *      Bough of the willow-tree       Over the brook,     Down darts a kingfisher,       Look, baby, look!      Back on the willow-bough,       Fishing is done;     Happy and nappy now       There in the sun.         *       *       *       *       *      Happy and nappy the baby is, too,     Softly his eyelids droop over the blue,     Golden his curls on the white pillow lie,     Sleep, baby, sleep, baby, hush-a-by-bye.     AN INDIAN RAID       Did you see some Indians passing,       Just a short while back?     Looks as if they must be massing       For a fierce attack!      Buckskin fringes, turkey-feather       Huge head-dresses and     Bows and arrows, altogether       Quite a frightful band!      From the lilac-bushes springing,       See them rushing! Ugh!     Awful war-whoops wildly ringing!       There'll be scalping, too!      In their fearful frenzy leaping,       It is very plain     Soon around us they'll be heaping       Mountains of the slain!      Soon their victims will be falling--       But, above the noise,     Hark! I hear somebody calling,       \"Come to dinner, boys!\"     THE FIRST SLEIGH-RIDE       O happy time of fleecy rime       And falling"]]]
