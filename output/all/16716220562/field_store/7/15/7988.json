As for the trout--particularly the big one Theo himself had caught--well, there never was such eating!  After lunch was done the fishermen were loth to leave the sunny shelter of the cabin.  Dr. Swift and Mr. Croyden lounged on the door-sill, while Theo skipped stones in the water until his arm was tired. Then exhausted by his exertions he sank wearily down on a stump near the lean-to and remarked:  \"Why wouldn't this be a good time, Mr. Croyden, to tell us some more about Greek pottery?\"  \"Greek pottery? Bless my heart! I thought you had forgotten all about that.\"  \"So I had when I was fishing,\" confessed Theo honestly. \"But I have remembered it again now.\"  \"You are a frank youngster,\" laughed Mr. Croyden. \"Well, let me see. You know the making of pottery was a fine art among the Greeks. They made two kinds--neither of them glazed, of course, because at that time nobody knew how to glaze pottery. The first kind was a pottery of red clay on which were placed decorations of black pigment; the other was a pottery on which they painted figures in red, afterward filling in the background around them with black. These two varieties of ware are briefly known as black on red, and red on black. The black portion of this pottery possessed a wonderful polish which came from the black pigment mixed with the clay; the red part, on the contrary, had no lustre, evidently being smoothed and polished with some hard tool after the vase was finished. These vases were very beautiful in form and design, no two of them being alike. Each was made by an individual artist who pleased himself as to the arrangement of the birds, animals, and gracefully draped figures with which he decorated it. The famous Fran√ßois vase at Florence is a marvelous example of this sixth century workmanship; every inch of its closely adorned surface is covered with carefully drawn figures in black, white, and purple. This particular piece was probably made by two Athenian artists, as it shows two distinct types of work. Think how fortunate we are to have had it come down to us unbroken through the tumult of the years!\"  Mr. Croyden gazed thoughtfully into the fire.  \"You know that at the time these exquisite vases were made the entire Greek nation was devoting itself to the fashioning of beautiful things. Sculptors were carving wonderful statues, toiling eagerly to make each piece more perfect in form; architects were rearing such buildings as the world has never since seen; and in the centre of Athens a district was reserved which was entirely occupied by the shops of potters and painters and known as the _ceramicus_. It is from this ancient word that our present day term ceramics is derived. Within this area devoted to the making of pottery the artists worked, each one reverently bending his energy to give to the world a thing which should be as nearly perfect in form and decoration as he could make it. Thousands of vases went out, many of them into the homes of rich, beauty-loving Greeks; many into the temples; and many into Athenian tombs; for the people of this nation always loyally honored their dead. In addition to these vases there were smaller articles--perfume bottles, jars for wine or water, utensils used at ceremonials in the temples; and the beautiful amphora, a vase given as a prize at the great Greek festivals, and the progenitor of the silver cups we now give the winners in athletic games. This latter type of vase had two handles and frequently its base was tapered to a point in order that it might rest in a tripod, or be thrust into the earth. At the Louvre in Paris there is a very famous Greek amphora which I hope you will see some day.\"  \"I should like to see it,\" declared Theo eagerly.  \"I intend you shall, son,\" put in Dr. Swift. \"I mean to give you the chance to see all the finest things in the world, if I have my way.\"  Theo smiled gratefully into his father's face.  \"When we marvel at the grace and perfection of Greek decoration we must bear in mind that as a spur to their artistic sense the people had beauty constantly before them. Theirs was a country of smiling skies, of blue heaven and golden sunshine; their buildings breathed the very essence of all that is highest in art; even the throngs that filled the streets were picturesque and classic in appearance. For in those days fashions of dress did not change as capriciously as they do now. A beautiful style of costume was adopted and retained, and in consequence artists had ever before them men and women who were excellent models for chaste decoration. In our time such a procedure would be impossible, as the national dress of both our men and women has become utilitarian rather than beautiful, and now has little artistic to recommend it. If we wish classic draperies and faultless styles of hair-dressing we must revert to the past for our models.\"  There was a silence broken only by the snapping of the fire.  \"To give you some idea how much of this pottery the Greeks turned out I must tell you that at Naples there is a collection of two thousand Greek cups and vases. The Vatican at Rome has one thousand more; Florence has seven hundred; Turin five hundred; Vienna three hundred; Berlin about seventeen hundred; the Louvre at Paris fifteen hundred; and the British Museum nearly twenty-six hundred. Besides these there are some twenty thousand more scattered all over the world in private collections.\"  A whistle of surprise escaped Theo.  \"Not all of these are equally good, however,\" went on Mr. Croyden. \"The Etruscan work done by wandering Greek potters and by some persons rated as identical with the Roman Samian ware, is one of the finest varieties remaining to us; probably because it escaped being buried with the dead and therefore was not injured or discolored by the soil as were so many of the Greek vases found at Athens. Moreover, we must remember that not every artist who made and decorated an object excelled. Naturally some did more perfect work than others, even in the days of the best Grecian art. How sad it is that at a later period in history the work of the Greeks became less fine because the ideals of the race degenerated. Pottery makers, sculptors, and builders began to produce cheap, gaudy things which were lavishly decorated, and reflected the luxury and extravagance that had crept into the nation. From that moment the glory of Greece decayed. For it is the ideals of a country and its people that serve as guide-posts to the greatest and finest deeds. Unless each individual in a land aims at the purest and best his country will never reach holiness. It is the struggle for perfection in every field of life that results in fine art, fine men, and fine nations.\"  Mr. Croyden had become very grave.  Then he rose abruptly, took out his pipe, and knocked the bowl of it upon a stump.  \"Well, well,\" he exclaimed with a swift return to his accustomed gaiety, \"I think I have lectured long enough. See! Manuel has everything packed up and is waiting for us. Suppose we start back home.\"  But Theo was very quiet on the trip back to the camp.  He was thinking about the Greeks.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER III  THEO MEETS WITH A CALAMITY   It was when Theo had been three days in camp that the accident happened.  Outside the cook-house stood a ladder to be used in case of fire, and as one morning the boy passed it, it suddenly came to him what fun it would be to mount to the ridge-pole of the cabin and toss a handful of tiny pebbles down on the heads of the guides as they passed through the door beneath. What a surprise it would be to Tony and Franz to have the stones come clattering down upon them; and what sport it would be to watch them as they tried to solve the riddle as to where the missiles came from!  It was a foolish scheme, and probably had Theo thought it over a second time he would have abandoned it; but he was an impulsive boy who often acted before he carefully considered what he was doing. Therefore without a moment's hesitation he cautiously dragged the ladder to the end of the cabin and, making sure that no one was looking, began climbing it. He was on the top rung and was just stepping softly to the roof when there was a snapping of rotten wood and the bar beneath his foot gave way, sending him crashing headlong to the ground.  Fortunately for Theo the cabin was a low one, and he had not far to fall; but in trying to save himself he twisted one leg beneath him, and the result was most disastrous. He felt a sudden sharp pain as he struck the earth, and when a second later he attempted to rise he discovered to his chagrin that it was impossible for him to do so. Every movement he made hurt him excruciatingly, and presently feeling both faint and dizzy he abandoned further effort.  For an interval he lay very still, ashamed to call for help; then pocketing his pride he began to yell lustily. His cries brought Franz and Manuel from the kitchen, Mr. Croyden from his cabin, and Dr. Swift from his room. Luckily it was just noontime and every one was indoors awaiting lunch.  Of what followed Theo had only a vague idea. He remembered that his father and Mr. Croyden raised him in their arms, and that in spite of their gentleness he had cried with pain at their touch. Then he had been put on his bed where his father proceeded to examine the injured leg. Every motion the Doctor made caused the boy intense agony. Afterward he had been allowed to rest, and then his father bent over him very gravely and with trembling lips said:  \"Son, I've got to hurt you; I've got to hurt you a great deal. Your leg is broken, and we are miles from a hospital. I have no ether to give you, and the bone must be set. I want you to be as brave as you can and bear the pain that I must cause you. I need not tell you that I will work as gently as possible. Now pull yourself"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19423"],["title","The Story of Porcelain (#4)"],["body","and show me the sort of son I have. The more steady your nerve is the more it will help me, and the sooner I can finish what I must do.\"  \"All right, Father.\"  \"That's the stuff!\" ejaculated Mr. Croyden, who was standing at the bedside. \"You are a genuine Spartan, Theo.\"  The lad smiled feebly.  \"I'll try to be.\"  \"Of course you will! You are your father's own boy.\"  Dr. Swift stooped and touched the drawn forehead with his cool hand.  \"I am going to leave you with Mr. Croyden for a few moments while I get some of the things I need,\" he said in a low tone. \"Keep perfectly still and rest a little if you can. There is no need for you to worry. We will have you all fixed up within an hour. It is a clean break--a merciful thing, for we couldn't take an X-ray of it if we wanted to.\"  With these words he left the room.  It was some little time before he returned, and in the meanwhile Mr. Croyden sat beside Theo's bed and talked cheerily.  \"Nothing like traveling with your own doctor,\" he remarked jocosely. \"Now if my leg was broken I should have to hire some one in to see it, and it would cost me a pretty penny. But here you are miles from a settlement with your own private physician in attendance. Were you a young prince you could not be more royally cared for. Think of having one of the best New York surgeons at your beck and call here in this wilderness. You are a lucky beggar!\"  Theo laughed faintly.  \"As for splints--here is a forest of the finest, straightest, and strongest timber. What more can you ask? You couldn't do things on a grander scale if you were in New York City.\"  Again Theo smiled.  \"Your father will have you comfortable as a cricket before long,\" went on Mr. Croyden, \"and you will be all ready to start back----\"  \"Start back!\" interrupted Theo in distress. \"Oh, surely, Mr. Croyden, Father is not going to take me home!\"  The older man hesitated.  \"Oh, of course I have no way of knowing what your father means to do,\" he protested hastily. \"I only imagined that you would be more comfortable at home, and would rather go. There really would not be much point in staying out the month here, would there? You see, you won't be able to get about, and your father would not like to go off every day and leave you here alone in camp.\"  \"But Father has spent all this money to come into the woods, and he has looked forward to the trip so much!\" groaned Theo. \"Besides, he is very tired and needs the rest; he told me so. If he takes me back home he will miss it all! He doesn't want the vacation just for his own fun, but so he can serve our country better if he is needed. I don't see why we couldn't stay on here just as we planned, even if I have a broken leg,\" was Theo's concluding plea.  \"Think how stupid it would be for you to be left in the house alone.\"  \"I shouldn't care. I could find some way to amuse myself.\"  \"But your father----\"  \"He could go fishing just as he always does!\" exclaimed Theo promptly. \"You surely don't suppose I'd be so selfish as to make him stay in the house just because I had to, do you? You see\"--Theo colored and then went on bravely--\"this accident was my own fault. Father told me the other day to let that ladder alone--and I didn't. It serves me right to break my leg. If I had been in Dad's place I'd have said: _I told you so_. But he didn't even whisper it. He was just patient and kind as he always is. Can't you understand now, Mr. Croyden, that I am the one to be punished--not Dad? If we go back home it will be punishing him too, and that wouldn't be fair, would it?\"  \"No, not fair at all,\" admitted Mr. Croyden slowly.  \"That is what I think,\" nodded Theo. \"You see, I am the one to suffer.\"  \"If you disobeyed, I guess you are.\"  \"I did disobey.\"  \"Humph! It was a pity.\"  \"I'm sorry; but it is done now,\" said Theo soberly. \"You know how you feel when you've done wrong. It's bad enough anyhow; and it makes you feel a hundred times worse if somebody else gets the blame for what you've done--somebody who doesn't deserve it.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"So, you see, that is why I want you to urge Father to stay on here,\" begged Theo. \"Tell him the Maine air will do me good; tell him I'll get a fine rest keeping still; tell him--oh, tell him _anything_; only don't let him pack up and go home, and have his whole vacation spoiled. If you'll just get him to stay, Mr. Croyden, I will promise not to bother, and he can go off every day and fish just as if I weren't here.\"  \"You are a trump, Theo.\"  \"It--it is only that I think it's square, sir,\" faltered Theo.  There was not time for further discussion, for at this juncture the door opened and Dr. Swift, followed by Manuel, entered.  Theo knew the moment for his boasted heroism had come.  He shut his lips tightly, and although the interval of anguish which followed forced the tears from his eyes he made no outcry. But never in his life had he experienced such pain. He did not know there was such pain in all the world.  When it was over and, faint from suffering, he lay languidly back among the pillows, Dr. Swift's stern face relaxed, and it was then Theo realized for the first time that his father, too, had been bracing himself to meet the ordeal and had also been suffering.  \"My poor boy!\" was all the Doctor said. \"You have borne it like a man! I am proud of you, Theo.\"  The words were few, but the praise was at that moment very precious.  His father sat with him the remainder of the day, as well as a good part of the night, and during the wakeful hours when the boy tossed to and fro he would have ventured to speak about staying in camp had not Dr. Swift bidden him to be quiet every time he attempted to talk. The next morning, however, after the invalid had been bathed and had his breakfast the Doctor said of his own accord:  \"So you think you would be happier to remain here in the woods, Theo, instead of going home.\"  The lad glanced up in surprise.  \"Did Mr. Croyden tell you that?\"  Dr. Swift nodded.  \"He said you'd like to stay,\" he returned quickly.  \"I should, very much.\"  \"Suppose we call it settled then, and say no more about it. I am sure I have no wish to jolt you over those miles of rough corduroy road if it can be avoided. You seem better this morning. Your fever has gone down, and I see no reason why you should not get on all right from now on.\"  Theo smiled; then he whispered timidly:  \"I just want to tell you I'm sorry I disobeyed you, Father.\"  His father put out his hand gently and covered the boy's two with his own.  \"You have the worst of it, son. Experience is a great teacher, they say. Let it help you not to do such a foolish thing again.\"  Theo met his father's eyes gratefully. He still felt weak and shaken and he was thankful not to have his fault rubbed in.  During the long hours of the long days that followed the lad had many an opportunity to put his unselfish resolutions into practise. He insisted that his father and Mr. Croyden go off on the long tramps they had each season been accustomed to take together, and during their absence he remained with Franz, who was very kind to him. The Indian had a great many devices for entertaining him. Now he fashioned for the boy's amusement a miniature birch-bark canoe; now he showed him how to weave baskets from lithe twigs of alder. Sometimes he whittled wonderful whistles and toys from bits of wood; sometimes made tiny bows and arrows or snowshoes. His resources seemed never ending.  Then when night came and Dr. Swift and Mr. Croyden returned from fishing Theo was always carried into the living-room of the cabin, and while he lay on the couch before the fire he would listen to the tale of the day's adventures. This bedtime hour was the best in the whole day.  At last there came a morning when Theo awoke to hear a storm beating noisily down upon the roof. The wind was blowing hard and sheets of rain drenched the windows.  \"There'll be no fishing to-day,\" announced Dr. Swift after breakfast. \"Instead Manuel is going out over the carry for provisions, and before he goes I must write some letters for him to take. In the meantime Mr. Croyden wants to know if you would like to have him come in and talk with you for a while?\"  \"Like it!\" was the delighted exclamation.  \"I believe I hear him now. Yes, here he is. Come in, Croyden!\" called the Doctor heartily. \"Our patient says he will be glad to see you.\"  \"Glad? I should say I should!\"  Mr. Croyden chuckled.  \"I don't know that any audience ever gave me such a royal welcome before,\" he declared with amusement. \"How do you find yourself this morning, sonny? Able to talk Greek pottery?\"  \"Able to hear you talk it,\" Theo answered instantly.  \"I am thinking of shifting my subject to-day and telling you about Chinese and Japanese pottery instead.\"  \"That will be fine.\"  \"Very well, we'll begin our lecture right away, since the audience seems to be assembled,\" observed Mr. Croyden merrily. \"Not only have you a private physician but a private lecturer, you see. My, but you are a royal personage! One thing will be very satisfactory about this audience. No matter whether it likes my talk or not it can't run away.\"  There was a peal of laughter from Theo.  In the meantime Mr. Croyden poked the fire into a blaze and sitting down in a comfortable chair began his story.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER IV  MR. CROYDEN'S STORY   \"Hundreds and hundreds of years ago,\" said Mr. Croyden, \"while the Egyptians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans were experimenting at pottery-making, the Chinese, inside their great walled country, were busy with the same task. In fact as far back as two thousand years before Christ the Chinese were famous potters, making earthenware of such fine quality that it was difficult to tell whether it was pottery or porcelain. For the two are quite different, you must remember, Theo. It is not enough to say that pottery is thick and porcelain thin, for much of the Chinese and Japanese pottery is very thin indeed. The difference lies in the"]]]
