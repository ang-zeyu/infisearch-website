Dinner over, Dr. Wilkins wished to depart. \"I shall expect you at ten,\" said Mr Smith. \"To-day, it seems, is the day for the return to life of the famous Dr. Faithburn. You did not think of it, I suppose. The awakening is to take place here in my house. You must come and see. I shall depend on your being here.\"  \"I will come back,\" answered Dr. Wilkins.  Left alone, Mr. Smith busied himself with examining his accounts--a task of vast magnitude, having to do with transactions which involve a daily expenditure of upward of $800,000. Fortunately, indeed, the stupendous progress of mechanic art in modern times makes it comparatively easy. Thanks to the Piano Electro-Reckoner, the most complex calculations can be made in a few seconds. In two hours Mr. Smith completed his task. Just in time. Scarcely had he turned over the last page when Dr. Wilkins arrived. After him came the body of Dr. Faithburn, escorted by a numerous company of men of science. They commenced work at once. The casket being laid down in the middle of the room, the telephote was got in readiness. The outer world, already notified, was anxiously expectant, for the whole world could be eye-witnesses of the performance, a reporter meanwhile, like the chorus in the ancient drama, explaining it all _viva voce_ through the telephone.  \"They are opening the casket,\" he explained. \"Now they are taking Faithburn out of it--a veritable mummy, yellow, hard, and dry. Strike the body and it resounds like a block of wood. They are now applying heat; now electricity. No result. These experiments are suspended for a moment while Dr. Wilkins makes an examination of the body. Dr. Wilkins, rising, declares the man to be dead. 'Dead!' exclaims every one present. 'Yes,' answers Dr. Wilkins, 'dead!' 'And how long has he been dead?' Dr. Wilkins makes another examination. 'A hundred years,' he replies.\"  The case stood just as the reporter said. Faithburn was dead, quite certainly dead! \"Here is a method that needs improvement,\" remarked Mr. Smith to Dr. Wilkins, as the scientific committee on hibernation bore the casket out. \"So much for that experiment. But if poor Faithburn is dead, at least he is sleeping,\" he continued. \"I wish I could get some sleep. I am tired out, Doctor, quite tired out! Do you not think that a bath would refresh me?\"  \"Certainly. But you must wrap yourself up well before you go out into the hall-way. You must not expose yourself to cold.\"  \"Hall-way? Why, Doctor, as you well know, everything is done by machinery here. It is not for me to go to the bath; the bath will come to me. Just look!\" and he pressed a button. After a few seconds a faint rumbling was heard, which grew louder and louder. Suddenly the door opened, and the tub appeared.  Such, for this year of grace 2889, is the history of one day in the life of the editor of the Earth Chronicle. And the history of that one day is the history of 365 days every year, except leap-years, and then of 366 days--for as yet no means has been found of increasing the length of the terrestrial year.

H. CLEMENTS    [Illustration]    NEW YORK   THE CENTURY CO.   1916       Copyright, 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913, by   The Century Co.    _Published, October, 1913_       To the Memory of those faithful brown   slave-men of the plantations throughout the   South, Daddy's contemporaries all, who during   the war while their masters were away fighting   in a cause opposed to their emancipation,   brought their blankets and slept outside their   mistresses' doors, thus keeping night-watch   over otherwise unprotected women and children--a   faithful guardianship of which the   annals of those troublous times record no   instance of betrayal.     FOREWORD   In presenting a loyal and venerable ex-slave as an artless exponent of freedom, freedom of conduct as well as of speech, the author of this trivial volume is perhaps not composing an individual so truly as individualizing a composite, if the expression will pass.  The grizzled brown dispenser of homely admonitions is a figure not unfamiliar to those who have \"moved in plantation circles\" in the cotton and sugar country, and touched hands with the kindly dark survivors of the old regime.  If the man, Daddy Do-funny, was unique as an individual, perhaps in the very fact of an individuality unembarrassed by the limitations of convention, of education and of precedent, he becomes in a sense typical of his people and of his time.  Of course, a man is not called Do-funny for nothing, not even playfully and in the free vernacular of rusticity at its freest.  One of a small community of superannuated pensioners upon the bounty of their former owners, Daddy was easily first citizen of Evergreen annex on Crepe Myrtle plantation, which is to say he was therein a personage of place and of privilege, coming and going at will, doing as he pleased, and as, with uplifted eye, he reverently boasted, \"sponsible to nobody but Almighty Gord for manners and behavior.\"  Even so late as this year of grace, a full half century after \"emancipation,\" there are still to be found on many of the larger plantations in the far South a few such members of the order of the Rocking-chair, whose records of \"good and honorable service\" reach back through periods of bondage, even such kindergartners as septuagenarians in the privileged class, having clear title to nearly a quarter of a century of slave memories; not to mention the occasional centenarian with even his semi-occasional uncle or father poking around, toothless and white-plumed dignitaries, these, sometimes with leaders, being blind, but ever important in pride of association and memory.  It is something even if one is bent double and may never again behold the light of day, to be able to reach back into a dim and forgotten past and to say, \"I remember,\" especially when the memory recalls days of brilliance and of importance.  But Daddy's place among the gentle Knights and Ladies of the Rocking-chair was far and away above such as these whose thoughts, alert though they were and loyal, travelled forever backward to the sweet but worn fields of memory where every pleasure is a recognition and fashions do not change--a restful retreat for dreamers whose days of activity are done.  But Daddy's mind worked forward and upward and although he did not know the alphabet excepting by rote, a common ante-bellum plantation accomplishment, and while professing high contempt for what he called \"cold shelf-knowledge,\" his reputation for wisdom, wisdom as gleaned in observation and experience and \"ripened by insight,\" was supreme, while his way of casually tossing it off in bits in playful epigram finally gave the word its plural form so that the expression \"Do-Funny Wisdoms\" came into familiar use.  As an example of his rambling talk, much of which seems at least semivagarious on transcription, I recall one of his meandering dissertations on the value of experience as superior to observation.  Several of the old people, his neighbors, had joined the listening children who surrounded him under the fig-tree, and perhaps he unconsciously deferred to them in his accent of their common possession in length of days, although he gave no sign of heed to any audience, when he said:  \"Dey's mighty few facts de same behind an' befo', not to say inside an' outside, and a man can go roun' an' roun' de blackberry bush an' not git nowhar. 'Spe'unce is a thorny bramble, an' yer 'bleeged to go _th'ough_ it, to _draw blood_, an', I tell yer, _de blood is de life_!\"  Although this tribute brought grunts of approval from the gray heads, Daddy was soon off at a tangent in playful fancy, hitting off a foible or \"celebrating truth and justice\" in one of the unconscious epigrams which it is sought herein to preserve, even when having occasionally to hammer them into shape, for, while Daddy was almost unerring in rhyme, his rhythm, never at fault in delivery, was strictly a temperamental matter, not adequately renderable in cold print.  But more than as philosopher, satirist or seer was the old man distinguished as a social factor on the place. Wherever his chair was set, there were the children gathered together, both black and white, eager listeners to his quaint pictorial recitals, even seeming to cherish the \"Wisdoms\" which fell from his tongue, as is not a common way with children, who seem instinctively to spurn the obviously didactic.  But Daddy's moralizing, besides its saving grace of imagery, was generally sequential and convincing; while his repartee, to use a word which seems almost a misfit in this rural setting, had a way of hitting the mark and striking fire, as when, in reply to the question from a forth-putting youngster on one occasion, \"Where do you keep all your wisdoms, Daddy?\" he snapped:  \"In my ole toof holes, dat's whar! Wisdoms don't ripen good tel yo' toofs is ready to drap out. Ev'rybody knows dat Gord A'mighty ain't nuver is set but one live Wisdom-toof in a man's mouf--an' dat comes late an' goes early.\"  And then he added with a mischievous smile:  \"You-all smarty undergrowth, you ain't chawed life yit. You jes 'speramintin' wid yo' milk-toofs.  \"Now's yo' havin' time, chillen, but _to have an' to lose, dat's life_!  \"Study wisdom now an' minch on it good wid yo yo'ng baby toofs an' hol' fas' to it, so's it'll meller down ripe, time de caverns opens for it.  \"But look out! I knows a lot o' ole vacant wisdom caves for rent behin' dis crepe myrtle hedge--so, I say, watch and pray! Pray for insight an' outsight! An' even so, dey's some wisdoms so fine you can't see 'em tel you nearin' Home an' livin' on de far side o' life!\"  Daddy lived alone in a tiny vine-clad cabin and there were times when he seemed frail and to need care, and the doctor said he was rheumatic. This, however, he denied, declining companionship while he insisted that the sharp pains which occasionally twisted his brow were only growing pains which he was glad to endure as not having got his growth in his first childhood, he was \"'bleeged to wrastle wid it in de second,\" and, \"of course,\" he added, \"it comes harder when a man's bones is set.\"  On days when his pains were bad, he would propel himself around in a roller-chair, which he called his chariot; and although evidently suffering, he was never heard to complain. Once, when he seemed almost helpless, some one asked him how he had got into the chair, and was quickly silenced by his ready answer, \"Gord lifted me in!\"  Now, to Daddy clothes were clothes. In dress as in manners, he knew no obligation of precedent; and as to fashion, the word made him chuckle.  When his pains were unusually severe and it was difficult for him to get into his own garments, he did not hesitate to clothe himself in one of the flowing wrappers which his old wife, Judy, long since dead, had worn.  And thus it happened that while on some days an aged man might have been seen hobbling about, working among his plants, on others there appeared to be an old woman propelling herself around in a rolling chair; and seeing her, his neighbors, with perhaps a chuckle, would remark, \"I see Daddy Do-funny is laid up ag'in!\"  Another peculiar habit of the old man was the way in which he took his bath--a dangerous process, one would think, for a rheumatic, but harmless, no doubt, to growing pains. Seeing the rain coming, he would exclaim: \"Gord sendeth de rain! He's offerin' me a bath--just or unjust!\" Then donning his \"bath-slip,\" an old wool wrapper of Judy's and getting into his roller-chair, he would wheel out and sit calmly in the shower, often closing his eyes and lifting his face as he exclaimed: \"Bless Gord for de sweet drops! Bless Gord for de rain!\" and when he had had bath enough, he would either put up his umbrella or roll his chair indoors as he felt inclined.  But perhaps we cannot get nearer the soul of the old man than by recalling a conversation which occurred during an invasion of the children, a conversation between him and his guests which is thrown into a sort of rhyme for easy memorizing, passing from one speaker to another without more than the natural pause for reply.  Obviously, the children began it:    \"Ol' Daddy Do-funny,   How do you come on?\"   \"Po'ly, thank Gord, honey,   Po'ly dis morn.     My ol' spine it's sort o' stiff,     An' my arms dey 'fuze to lif'.     An' de miz'ry 's in my breas',     An' I got some heart-distress.     An' de growin' pains dey lingers,     In my knee-j'ints an' my fingers,   But I'm well, praise Gord, dis mornin'.\"    \"Ol' Daddy Do-funny,   What cuyus talk!   How is you well, when you   Can't even walk?\"      \"Hush, you foolish chillen, hush!     What's dat singin' in de brush?     Ain't dat yonder blue de sky?     Feel de cool breeze passin' by!     Dis ol' painful back an' knee,     Laws-a-mussy, _dey ain't me!     I'm well, praise Gord, dis mornin'!_\"                            RUTH McENERY STUART.    [Illustration]"]]]
