This theory, which has been      repeatedly applied to other mythologies with invariable failure, is      now disowned by every distinguished student of European and      Oriental antiquity; and to seek to introduce it into American      religions is simply to render them still more obscure and      unattractive, and to deprive them of the only general interest they      now have, that of illustrating the gradual development of the      religious ideas of humanity.       But while thus regretting the use he has made of them, all      interested in American antiquity cannot too much thank this      indefatigable explorer for the priceless materials he has unearthed      in the neglected libraries of Spain and Central America, and laid      before the public. For the present purpose the most significant of      these is the Sacred National Book of the Quiches, a tribe of      Guatemala. This contains their legends, written in the original      tongue, and transcribed by Father Francisco Ximenes about 1725. The      manuscripts of this missionary were used early in the present      century, by Don Felix Cabrera, but were supposed to be entirely      lost even by the Abbé Brasseur himself in 1850 (_Lettre à M. le Duc      de Valmy_, Mexique, Oct. 15, 1850). Made aware of their importance      by the expressions of regret used in the Abbé's letters, Dr. C.      Sherzer, in 1854, was fortunate enough to discover them in the      library of the University of San Carlos in the city of Guatemala.      The legends were in Quiche with a Spanish translation and scholia.      The Spanish was copied by Dr. Scherzer and published in Vienna, in      1856, under the title _Las Historias del Origen de los Indios de      Guatemala, por el R. P. F. Francisco Ximenes_. In 1855 the Abbé      Brasseur took a copy of the original which he brought out at Paris      in 1861, with a translation of his own, under the title _Vuh Popol:      Le Livre Sacré des Quichés et les Mythes de l'Antiquité Américaine_.      Internal evidence proves that these legends were written down by a      converted native some time in the seventeenth century. They carry      the national history back about two centuries, beyond which all is      professedly mythical. Although both translations are colored by the      peculiar views of their makers, this is incomparably the most      complete and valuable work on American mythology extant.       Another authority of inestimable value has been placed within the      reach of scholars during the last few years. This is the _Relations      de la Nouvelle France_, containing the annual reports of the      Jesuit missionaries among the Iroquois and Algonkins from and      after 1611. My references to this are always to the reprint at      Quebec, 1858. Of not less excellence for another tribe, the Creeks,      is the brief \"Sketch of the Creek Country,\" by Col. Benjamin      Hawkins, written about 1800, and first published in full by the      Georgia Historical Society in 1848. Most of the other works to      which I have referred are too well known to need any special      examination here, or will be more particularly mentioned in the      foot-notes when quoted.   FOOTNOTES:  [2-1] Waitz, _Anthropologie der Naturvoelker_, i. p. 256.  [2-2] Carriere, _Die Kunst im Zusammenhang der Culturentwickelung_, i. p. 66.  [6-1] It is said indeed that the Yebus, a people on the west coast of Africa, speak a polysynthetic language, and _per contra_, that the Otomis of Mexico have a monosyllabic one like the Chinese. Max Mueller goes further, and asserts that what is called the process of agglutination in the Turanian languages is the same as what has been named polysynthesis in America. This is not to be conceded. In the former the root is unchangeable, the formative elements follow it, and prefixes are not used; in the latter prefixes are common, and the formative elements are blended with the root, both undergoing changes of structure. Very important differences.  [9-1] Grimm, _Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache_, p. 571.  [11-1] Peter Martyr, _De Insulis nuper Repertis_, p. 354: Colon. 1574.

The explanation is extremely obscure in the original. I have given it in the only sense in which the author's words seem to have any meaning.  [14-1] Humboldt, _Vues des Cordillères_, p. 72.

[21-1] Gomara states that De Ayllon found tribes on the Atlantic shore not far from Cape Hatteras keeping flocks of deer (_ciervos_) and from their milk making cheese (_Hist. de las Indias_, cap. 43). I attach no importance to this statement, and only mention it to connect it with some other curious notices of the tribe now extinct who occupied that locality. Both De Ayllon and Lawson mention their very light complexions, and the latter saw many with blonde hair, blue eyes, and a fair skin; they cultivated when first visited the potato (or the groundnut), tobacco, and cotton (Humboldt); they reckoned time by disks of wood divided into sixty segments (Lederer); and just in this latitude the most careful determination fixes the mysterious White-man's-land, or Great Ireland of the Icelandic Sagas (see the _American Hist. Mag._, ix. p. 364), where the Scandinavian sea rovers in the eleventh century found men of their own color, clothed in long woven garments, and not less civilized than themselves.  [23-1] The name Eskimo is from the Algonkin word _Eskimantick_, eaters of raw flesh. There is reason to believe that at one time they possessed the Atlantic coast considerably to the south. The Northmen, in the year 1000, found the natives of Vinland, probably near Rhode Island, of the same race as they were familiar with in Labrador. They call them _Skralingar_, chips, and describe them as numerous and short of stature (Eric Rothens Saga, in Mueller, _Sagænbibliothek_, p. 214). It is curious that the traditions of the Tuscaroras, who placed their arrival on the Virginian coast about 1300, spoke of the race they found there as eaters of raw flesh and ignorant of maize (Lederer, _Account of North America_, in Harris, Voyages).  [25-1] Richardson, _Arctic Expedition_, p. 374.  [25-2] The late Professor W. W. Turner of Washington, and Professor Buschmann of Berlin, are the two scholars who have traced the boundaries of this widely dispersed family. The name is drawn from Lake Athapasca in British America.  [25-3] The Cherokee tongue has a limited number of words in common with the Iroquois, and its structural similarity is close. The name is of unknown origin. It should doubtless be spelled _Tsalakie_, a plural form, almost the same as that of the river Tellico, properly Tsaliko (Ramsey, _Annals of Tennessee_, p. 87), on the banks of which their principal towns were situated. Adair's derivation from _cheera_, fire, is worthless, as no such word exists in their language.  [27-1] The term Algonkin may be a corruption of _agomeegwin_, people of the other shore. Algic, often used synonymously, is an adjective manufactured by Mr. Schoolcraft \"from the words Alleghany and Atlantic\" (Algic Researches, ii. p. 12). There is no occasion to accept it, as there is no objection to employing Algonkin both as substantive and adjective. Iroquois is a French compound of the native words _hiro_, I have said, and _kouè_, an interjection of assent or applause, terms constantly heard in their councils.  [27-2] Apalachian, which should be spelt with one p, is formed of two Creek words, _apala_, the great sea, the ocean, and the suffix _chi_, people, and means those dwelling by the ocean. That the Natchez were offshoots of the Mayas I was the first to surmise and to prove by a careful comparison of one hundred Natchez words with their equivalents in the Maya dialects. Of these, _five_ have affinities more or less marked to words peculiar to the Huastecas of the river Panuco (a Maya colony), _thirteen_ to words common to Huasteca and Maya, and _thirty-nine_ to words of similar meaning in the latter language. This resemblance may be exemplified by the numerals, one, two, four, seven, eight, twenty. In Natchez they are _hu_, _ah_, _gan_, _uk-woh_, _upku-tepish_, _oka-poo_: in Maya, _hu_, _ca_, _can_, _uk_, _uapxæ_, _hunkal_. (See the Am. Hist. Mag., New Series, vol. i. p. 16, Jan. 1867.)  [28-1] Dakota, a native word, means friends or allies.  [28-2] Rep. of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1854, p. 209.  [29-1] According to Professor Buschmann Aztec is probably from _iztac_, white, and Nahuatlacatl signifies those who speak the language _Nahuatl_, clear sounding, sonorous. The Abbé Brasseur (de Bourbourg), on the other hand, derives the latter from the Quiche _nawal_, intelligent, and adds the amazing information that this is identical with the English _know all_!! (_Hist. du Mexique_, etc., i. p. 102). For in his theory several languages of Central America are derived from the same old Indo-Germanic stock as the English, German, and cognate tongues. Toltec, from _Toltecatl_, means inhabitant of Tollan, which latter may be from _tolin_, rush, and signify the place of rushes. The signification _artificer_, often assigned to Toltecatl, is of later date, and was derived from the famed artistic skill of this early folk (Buschmann, _Aztek. Ortsnamen_, p. 682: Berlin, 1852). The Toltecs are usually spoken of as anterior to the Nahuas, but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19347"],["title","The Myths of the New World (#8)"],["body","Tlascaltecs and natives of Cholollan or Cholula were in fact Toltecs, unless we assign to this latter name a merely mythical signification. The early migrations of the two Aztec bands and their relationship, it may be said in passing, are as yet extremely obscure. The Shoshonees when first known dwelt as far north as the head waters of the Missouri, and in the country now occupied by the Black Feet. Their language, which includes that of the Comanche, Wihinasht, Utah, and kindred bands, was first shown to have many and marked affinities with that of the Aztecs by Professor Buschmann in his great work, _Ueber die Spuren der Aztekischen Sprache im nördlichen Mexico und höheren Amerikanischen Norden_, p. 648: Berlin, 1854.  [31-1] His opinion was founded on an analysis of fifteen words of the secret language of the Incas preserved in the Royal Commentaries of Garcilasso de la Vega. On examination, they all proved to be modified forms from the _lengua general_ (Meyen, _Ueber die Ureinwohner von Peru_, p. 6). The Quichuas of Peru must not be confounded with the Quiches of Guatemala. Quiche is the name of a place, and means \"many trees;\" the derivation of Quichua is unknown. Muyscas means \"men.\" This nation also called themselves Chibchas.  [32-1] The significance of Carib is probably warrior. It may be the same word as Guarani, which also has this meaning. Tupi or Tupa is the name given the thunder, and can only be understood mythically.  [33-1] The Araucanians probably obtained their name from two Quichua words, _ari auccan_, yes! they fight; an idiom very expressive of their warlike character. They had had long and terrible wars with the Incas before the arrival of Pizarro.  [34-1] Since writing the text I have received the admirable work of Dr. von Martius, _Beiträge zur Ethnographie und Sprachenkunde Amerika's zumal Brasilians_, Leipzig, 1867, in which I observe that that profound student considers that there is no doubt but that the Island Caribs, and the Galibis of the main land are descendants from the same stock as the Tupis and Guaranis.  [35-1] _Comptes Rendus_, vol. xxi. p. 1368 sqq.  [35-2] The two best authorities are Daniel Wilson, _The American Cranial Type_, in _Ann. Rep. of the Smithson. Inst._, 1862, p. 240, and J. A. Meigs, _Cranial Forms of the Amer. Aborigs._: Phila. 1866. They accord in the views expressed in the text and in the rejection of those advocated by Dr. S. G. Morton in the Crania Americana.

An intuition common to the species.--Words expressing it in      American languages derived either from ideas of above in space, or      of life manifested by breath.--Examples.--No conscious monotheism,      and but little idea of immateriality discoverable.--Still less any      moral dualism of deities, the Great Good Spirit and the Great Bad      Spirit being alike terms and notions of foreign importation.   If we accept the definition that mythology is the idea of God expressed in symbol, figure, and narrative, and always struggling toward a clearer utterance, it is well not only to trace this idea in its very earliest embodiment in language, but also, for the sake of comparison, to ask what is its latest and most approved expression. The reply to this is given us by Immanuel Kant. He has shown that our reason, dwelling on the facts of experience, constantly seeks the principles which connect them together, and only rests satisfied in the conviction that there is a highest and first principle which reconciles all their discrepancies and binds them into one. This he calls the Ideal of Reason. It must be true, for it is evolved from the laws of reason, our only test of truth. Furthermore, the sense of personality and the voice of conscience, analyzed to their sources, can only be explained by the assumption of an infinite personality and an absolute standard of right. Or, if to some all this appears but wire-drawn metaphysical subtlety, they are welcome to the definition of the realist, that the idea of God is the sum of those intelligent activities which the individual, reasoning from the analogy of his own actions, imagines to be behind and to bring about natural phenomena.[44-1] If either of these be correct, it were hard to conceive how any tribe or even any sane man could be without some notion of divinity.  Certainly in America no instance of its absence has been discovered. Obscure, grotesque, unworthy it often was, but everywhere man was oppressed with a _sensus numinis_, a feeling that invisible, powerful agencies were at work around him, who, as they willed, could help or hurt him. In every heart was an altar to the Unknown God. Not that it was customary to attach any idea of unity to these unseen powers. The supposition that in ancient times and in very unenlightened conditions, before mythology had grown, a monotheism prevailed, which afterwards at various times was revived by reformers, is a belief that should have passed away when the delights of savage life and the praises of a state of nature ceased to be the themes of philosophers. We are speaking of a people little capable of abstraction. The exhibitions of force in nature seemed to them the manifestations of that mysterious power felt by their self-consciousness; to combine these various manifestations and recognize them as the operations of one personality, was a step not easily taken. Yet He is not far from every one of us. \"Whenever man thinks clearly, or feels deeply, he conceives God as self-conscious unity,\" says Carriere, with admirable insight; and elsewhere, \"we have monotheism, not in contrast to polytheism, not clear to the thought, but in living intuition in the religious sentiments.\"[45-1]  Thus it was among the Indians. Therefore a word is usually found in their languages analogous to none in any European tongue, a word comprehending all manifestations of the unseen world, yet conveying no sense of personal unity. It has been rendered spirit, demon, God, devil, mystery, magic, but commonly and rather absurdly by the English and French, \"medicine.\" In the Algonkin dialects this word is _manito_ and _oki_, in Iroquois _oki_ and _otkon_, the Dakota has _wakan_, the Aztec _teotl_, the Quichua _huaca_, and the Maya _ku_. They all express in its most general form the idea of the supernatural. And as in this word, supernatural, we see a transfer of a conception of place, and that it literally means that which is _above_ the natural world, so in such as we can analyze of these vague and primitive terms the same trope appears discoverable. _Wakan_ as an adverb means _above_, _oki_ is but another orthography for _oghee_, and _otkon_ seems allied to _hetken_, both of which have the same signification.[46-1]  The transfer is no mere figure of speech, but has its origin in the very texture of the human mind. The heavens, the upper regions, are in every religion the supposed abode of the divine. What is higher is always the stronger and the nobler; a _superior_ is one who is better than we are, and therefore a chieftain in Algonkin is called _oghee-ma_, the higher one. There is, moreover, a naif and spontaneous instinct which leads man in his ecstasies of joy, and in his paroxysms of fear or pain, to lift his hands and eyes to the overhanging firmament. There the sun and bright stars sojourn, emblems of glory and stability. Its azure vault has a mysterious attraction which invites the eye to gaze longer and longer into its infinite depths.[46-2] Its color brings thoughts of serenity, peace, sunshine, and warmth. Even the rudest hunting tribes felt these sentiments, and as a metaphor in their speeches, and as a paint expressive of friendly design, blue was in wide use among them.[47-1]  So it came to pass that the idea of God was linked to the heavens long ere man asked himself, are the heavens material and God spiritual, is He one, or is He many? Numerous languages bear trace of this. The Latin Deus, the Greek Zeus, the Sanscrit Dyaus, the Chinese Tien, all originally meant the sky above, and our own word heaven is often employed synonymously with God. There is at first no personification in these expressions. They embrace all unseen agencies, they are void of personality, and yet to the illogical primitive man there is nothing contradictory in making them the object of his prayers. The Mayas had legions of gods; \"_ku_,\" says their historian,[47-2] \"does not signify any particular god; yet their prayers are sometimes addressed to _kue_,\" which is the same word in the vocative case.  As the Latins called their united divinities _Superi_, those above, so Captain John Smith found that the Powhatans of Virginia employed the word _oki_, above, in the same sense, and it even had passed into a definite personification among them in the shape of an \"idol of wood evil-favoredly carved.\" In purer dialects of the Algonkin it is always indefinite, as in the terms _nipoon oki_, spirit of summer, _pipoon oki_, spirit of winter. Perhaps the word was introduced into Iroquois by the Hurons, neighbors and associates of the Algonkins. The Hurons applied it to that demoniac power \"who rules the seasons of the year, who holds the winds and the waves in leash, who can give fortune to their undertakings, and relieve all their wants.\"[48-1] In another and far distant branch of the Iroquois, the Nottoways of southern Virginia, it reappears under, the curious form _quaker_, doubtless a corruption of the Powhatan _qui-oki_, lesser gods.[48-2] The proper Iroquois name of him to whom they prayed was _garonhia_, which"]]]
