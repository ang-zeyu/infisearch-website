An old race would have gone much farther than these people have. Progress is a matter of communication and pooling ideas and discoveries. Make a trend-graph of technological progress on Terra; every big jump comes after an improvement in communications. The printing press; railways and steamships; the telegraph; radio. Then think how telepathy would speed up progress.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The sun was barely past noon meridian before the Svants, who had ventured down into the fields at sunrise, were returning to the mound-village. In the snooper-screen, they could be seen coming up in tunics and breechclouts, entering houses, and emerging in long robes. There seemed to be no bows or spears in evidence, but the big horn sounded occasionally. Paul Meillard was pleased. Even if it had been by sign-talk, which he rated with worm-fishing for trout or shooting sitting rabbits, he had gotten something across to them.  When they went to the village, at 1500, they had trouble getting their lorry down. A couple of Marines in a jeep had to go in first to get the crowd out of the way. Several of the locals, including the one with the staff, joined with them; this quick co-operation delighted Meillard. When they had the lorry down and were all out of it, the dignitary with the staff, his scarlet tablecloth over his yellow robe, began an oration, apparently with every confidence that he was being understood. In spite of his objections at lunch, the telepathy theory was beginning to seem more persuasive.  \"Give them the Shooting of Dan McJabberwock again,\" he told Meillard. \"This is where we came in yesterday.\"  Something Meillard had noticed was exciting him. \"Wait a moment. They're going to do something.\"  They were indeed. The one with the staff and three of his henchmen advanced. The staff bearer touched himself on the brow. \"_Fwoonk_,\" he said. Then he pointed to Meillard. \"_Hoonkle_,\" he said.  \"They got it!\" Lillian was hugging herself joyfully. \"I knew they ought to!\"  Meillard indicated himself and said, \"_Fwoonk_.\"  That wasn't right. The village elder immediately corrected him. The word, it seemed, was, \"_Fwoonk_.\"  His three companions agreed that that was the word for self, but that was as far as the agreement went. They rendered it, respectively, as \"_Pwink_,\" \"_Tweelt_\" and \"_Kroosh_.\"  Gofredo gave a barking laugh. He was right; anything that could go wrong would go wrong. Lillian used a word; it was not a ladylike word at all. The Svants looked at them as though wondering what could possibly be the matter. Then they went into a huddle, arguing vehemently. The argument spread, like a ripple in a pool; soon everybody was twittering vocally or blowing on flutes and Panpipes. Then the big horn started blaring. Immediately, Gofredo snatched the hand-phone of his belt radio and began speaking urgently into it.  \"What are you doing, Luis?\" Meillard asked anxiously.  \"Calling the reserve in. I'm not taking chances on this.\" He spoke again into the phone, then called over his shoulder: \"Rienet; three one-second bursts, in the air!\"  A Marine pointed a submachine gun skyward and ripped off a string of shots, then another, and another. There was silence after the first burst. Then a frightful howling arose.  \"Luis, you imbecile!\" Meillard was shouting.  Gofredo jumped onto the top of an airjeep, where they could all see him; drawing his pistol, he fired twice into the air.  \"Be quiet, all of you!\" he shouted, as though that would do any good.  It did. Silence fell, bounced noisily, and then settled over the crowd. Gofredo went on talking to them: \"Take it easy, now; easy.\" He might have been speaking to a frightened dog or a fractious horse. \"Nobody's going to hurt you. This is nothing but the great noise-magic of the Terrans....\"  \"Get the presents unloaded,\" Meillard was saying. \"Make a big show of it. The table first.\"  The horn, which had started, stopped blowing. As they were getting off the long table and piling it with trade goods, another lorry came in, disgorging twenty Marine riflemen. They had their bayonets fixed; the natives looked apprehensively at the bare steel, but went on listening to Gofredo. Meillard pulled the (Lord Mayor? Archbishop? Lord of the Manor?) aside, and began making sign-talk to him.  When quiet was restored, Howell put a pick and shovel into a wheelbarrow and pushed them out into the space that had been cleared in front of the table. He swung the pick for a while, then shoveled the barrow full of ground. After pushing it around for a while, he dumped it back in the hole and leveled it off. Two Marines brought out an eight-inch log and chopped a couple of billets off it with an ax, then cut off another with one of the saws, split them up, and filled the wheelbarrow with the firewood.  [Illustration: _We can't use the computer till we can tell it what the data is data about!_]  The knives, jewelry and other small items would be no problem; they had enough of them to go around. The other stuff would be harder to distribute, and Paul Meillard and Karl Dorver were arguing about how to handle it. If they weren't careful, a lot of new bowie knives would get bloodied.  \"Have them form a queue,\" Anna suggested. \"That will give them the idea of equal sharing, and we'll be able to learn something about their status levels and social hierarchy and agonistic relations.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The one with the staff took it as a matter of course that he would go first; his associates began falling in behind him, and the rest of the villagers behind them. Whether they'd gotten one the day before or not, everybody was given a knife and a bandanna and one piece of flashy junk-jewelry, also a stainless steel cup and mess plate, a bucket, and an empty bottle with a cork. The women didn't carry sheath knives, so they got Boy Scout knives on lanyards. They were all lavishly supplied with Extee Three and candy. Any of the children who looked big enough to be trusted with them got knives too, and plenty of candy.  Anna and Karl were standing where the queue was forming, watching how they fell into line; so was Lillian, with an audiovisual camera. Having seen that the Marine enlisted men were getting the presents handed out properly, Howell strolled over to them. Just as he came up, a couple approached hesitantly, a man in a breechclout under a leather apron, and a woman, much smaller, in a ragged and soiled tunic. As soon as they fell into line, another Svant, in a blue robe, pushed them aside and took their place.  \"Here, you can't do that!\" Lillian cried. \"Karl, make him step back.\"  Karl was saying something about social status and precedence. The couple tried to get into line behind the man who had pushed them aside. Another villager tried to shove them out of his way. Howell advanced, his right fist closing. Then he remembered that he didn't know what he'd be punching; he might break the fellow's neck, or his own knuckles. He grabbed the blue-robed Svant by the wrist with both hands, kicked a foot out from under him, and jerked, sending him flying for six feet and then sliding in the dust for another couple of yards. He pushed the others back, and put the couple into place in the line.  \"Mark, you shouldn't have done that,\" Dorver was expostulating. \"We don't know....\"  The Svant sat up, shaking his head groggily. Then he realized what had been done to him. With a snarl of rage, he was on his feet, his knife in his hand. It was a Terran bowie knife. Without conscious volition, Howell's pistol was out and he was thumbing the safety off.  The Svant stopped short, then dropped the knife, ducked his head, and threw his arms over it to shield his comb. He backed away a few steps, then turned and bolted into the nearest house. The others, including the woman in the ragged tunic, were twittering in alarm. Only the man in the leather apron was calm; he was saying, tonelessly, \"_Ghrooogh-ghrooogh_.\"  Luis Gofredo was coming up on the double, followed by three of his riflemen.  \"What happened, Mark? Trouble?\"  \"All over now.\" He told Gofredo what had happened. Dorver was still objecting:  \"... Social precedence; the Svant may have been right, according to local customs.\"  \"Local customs be damned!\" Gofredo became angry. \"This is a Terran Federation handout; we make the rules, and one of them is, no pushing people out of line. Teach the buggers that now and we won't have to work so hard at it later.\" He called back over his shoulder, \"Situation under control; get the show going again.\"  The natives were all grimacing heartbrokenly with pleasure. Maybe the one who got thrown on his ear--no, he didn't have any--was not one of the more popular characters in the village.  \"You just pulled your gun, and he dropped the knife and ran?\" Gofredo asked. \"And the others were scared, too?\"  \"That's right. They all saw you fire yours; the noise scared them.\"  Gofredo nodded. \"We'll avoid promiscuous shooting, then. No use letting them find out the noise won't hurt them any sooner than we have to.\"  Paul Meillard had worked out a way to distribute the picks and shovels and axes. Considering each house as representing a family unit, which might or might not be the case, there were picks and shovels enough to go around, and an ax for every third house. They took them around in an airjeep and left them at the doors. The houses, he found, weren't adobe at all. They were built of logs, plastered with adobe on the outside. That demolished his theory that the houses were torn down periodically, and left the mound itself unexplained.  The wheelbarrows and the grindstone and the two crosscut saws were another matter. Nobody was quite sure that the (nobility? capitalist-class? politicians? prominent citizens?) wouldn't simply appropriate them for themselves. Paul Meillard was worried"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19076"],["title","Naudsonce (#4)"],["body","that; everybody else was willing to let matters take their course. Before they were off the ground in their vehicles, a violent dispute had begun, with a bedlam of jabbering and shrieking. By the time they were landing at the camp, the big laminated leather horn had begun to bellow.         *       *       *       *       *  One of the huts had been fitted as contact-team headquarters, with all the view and communication screens installed, and one end partitioned off and soundproofed for Lillian to study recordings in. It was cocktail time when they returned; conversationally, it was a continuation from lunch. Karl Dorver was even more convinced than ever of his telepathic hypothesis, and he had completely converted Anna de Jong to it.  \"Look at that.\" He pointed at the snooper screen, which gave a view of the plaza from directly above. \"They're reaching an agreement already.\"  So they seemed to be, though upon what was less apparent. The horn had stopped, and the noise was diminishing. The odd thing was that peace was being restored, or was restoring itself, as the uproar had begun--outwardly from the center of the plaza to the periphery of the crowd. The same thing had happened when Gofredo had ordered the submachine gun fired, and, now that he recalled, when he had dealt with the line-crasher.  \"Suppose a few of them, in the middle, are agreed,\" Anna said. \"They are all thinking in unison, combining their telepathic powers. They dominate those nearest to them, who join and amplify their telepathic signal, and it spreads out through the whole group. A mental chain-reaction.\"  \"That would explain the mechanism of community leadership, and I'd been wondering about that,\" Dorver said, becoming more excited. \"It's a mental aristocracy; an especially gifted group of telepaths, in agreement and using their powers in concert, implanting their opinions in the minds of all the others. I'll bet the purpose of the horn is to distract the thoughts of the others, so that they can be more easily dominated. And the noise of the shots shocked them out of communication with each other; no wonder they were frightened.\"  Bennet Fayon was far from convinced. \"So far, this telepathy theory is only an assumption. I find it a lot easier to assume some fundamental difference between the way they translate sound into sense-data and the way we do. We _think_ those combs on top of their heads are their external hearing organs, but we have no idea what's back of them, or what kind of a neural hookup is connected to them. I wish I knew how these people dispose of their dead. I need a couple of fresh cadavers. Too bad they aren't warlike. Nothing like a good bloody battle to advance the science of anatomy, and what we don't know about Svant anatomy is practically the entire subject.\"  \"I should imagine the animals hear in the same way,\" Meillard said. \"When the wagon wheels and the hoes and the blacksmith tools come down from the ship, we'll trade for cattle.\"  \"When they make the second landing in the mountains, I'm going to do a lot of hunting,\" Loughran added. \"I'll get wild animals for you.\"  \"Well, I'm going to assume that the vocal noises they make are meaningful speech,\" Lillian Ransby said. \"So far, I've just been trying to analyze them for phonetic values. Now I'm going to analyze them for sound-wave patterns. No matter what goes on inside their private nervous systems, the sounds exist as waves in the public atmosphere. I'm going to assume that the Lord Mayor and his stooges were all trying to say the same thing when they were pointing to themselves, and I'm going to see if all four of those sounds have any common characteristic.\"  By the time dinner was over, they were all talking in circles, none of them hopefully. They all made recordings of the speech about the slithy toves in the Malemute Saloon; Lillian wanted to find out what was different about them. Luis Gofredo saw to it that the camp itself would be visible-lighted, and beyond the lights he set up more photoelectric robot sentries and put a couple of snoopers to circling on contragravity, with infra-red lights and receptors. He also insisted that all his own men and all Dave Questell's Navy construction engineers keep their weapons ready to hand. The natives in the village were equally distrustful. They didn't herd the cattle up from the meadows where they had been pastured, but they lighted watch-fires along the edge of the mound as soon as it became dark.         *       *       *       *       *  It was three hours after nightfall when something on the indicator-board for the robot sentries went off like a startled rattlesnake. Everybody, talking idly or concentrating on writing up the day's observations, stiffened. Luis Gofredo, dozing in a chair, was on his feet instantly and crossing the hut to the instruments. His second-in-command, who had been playing chess with Willi Schallenmacher, rose and snatched his belt from the back of his chair, putting it on.  \"Take it easy,\" Gofredo said. \"Probably just a cow or a horse--local equivalent--that's strayed over from the other side.\"  He sat down in front of one of the snooper screens and twisted knobs on the remote controls. The monochrome view, transformed from infra red, rotated as the snooper circled and changed course. The other screen showed the camp receding and the area around it widening as its snooper gained altitude.  \"It's not a big party,\" Gofredo was saying. \"I can't see--Oh, yes I can. Only two of them.\"  The humanoid figures, one larger than the other, were moving cautiously across the fields, crouching low. The snooper went down toward them, and then he recognized them. The man and woman whom the blue-robed villager had tried to shove out of the queue, that afternoon. Gofredo recognized them, too.  \"Your friends, Mark. Harry,\" he told his subordinate, \"go out and pass the word around. Only two, and we think they're friendly. Keep everybody out of sight; we don't want to scare them away.\"  The snooper followed closely behind them. The man was no longer wearing his apron; the woman's tunic was even more tattered and soiled. She was leading him by the hand. Now and then, she would stop and turn her head to the rear. The snooper over the mound showed nothing but half a dozen fire-watchers dozing by their fires. Then the pair were at the edge of the camp lights. As they advanced, they seemed to realize that they had passed a point-of-no-return. They straightened and came forward steadily, the woman seeming to be guiding her companion.  \"What's happening, Mark?\"  It was Lillian; she must have just come out of the soundproof speech-lab.  \"You know them; the pair in the queue, this afternoon. I think we've annexed a couple of friendly natives.\"  They all went outside. The two natives, having come into the camp, had stopped. For a moment, the man in the breechclout seemed undecided whether he was more afraid to turn and run than advance. The woman, holding his hand, led him forward. They were both bruised, and both had minor cuts, and neither of them had any of the things that had been given to them that afternoon.  \"Rest of the gang beat them up and robbed them,\" Gofredo began angrily.  \"See what you did?\" Dorver began. \"According to their own customs, they had no right to be ahead of those others, and now you've gotten them punished for it.\"  \"I'd have done more to that fellow then Mark did, if I'd been there when it happened.\" The Marine officer turned to Meillard. \"Look, this is your show, Paul; how you run it is your job. But in your place, I'd take that pair back to the village and have them point out who beat them up, and teach the whole gang of them a lesson. If you're going to colonize this planet, you're going to have to establish Federation law, and Federation law says you mustn't gang up on people and beat and rob them. We don't have to speak Svantese to make them understand what we'll put up with and what we won't.\"  \"Later, Luis. After we've gotten a treaty with somebody.\" Meillard broke off. \"Watch this!\"  The woman was making sign-talk. She pointed to the village on the mound. Then, with her hands, she shaped a bucket like the ones that had been given to them, and made a snatching gesture away from herself. She indicated the neckcloths, and the sheath knife and the other things, and snatched them away too. She made beating motions, and touched her bruises and the man's. All the time, she was talking excitedly, in a high, shrill voice. The man made the same _ghroogh-ghroogh_ noises that he had that afternoon.  \"No; we can't take any punitive action. Not now,\" Meillard said. \"But we'll have to do something for them.\"  Vengeance, it seemed, wasn't what they wanted. The woman made vehement gestures of rejection toward the village, then bowed, placing her hands on her brow. The man imitated her obeisance, then they both straightened. The woman pointed to herself and to the man, and around the circle of huts and landing craft. She began scuttling about, picking up imaginary litter and sweeping with an imaginary broom. The man started pounding with an imaginary hammer, then chopping with an imaginary ax.  Lillian was clapping her hands softly. \"Good; got it the first time. 'You let us stay; we work for you.' How about it, Paul?\"  Meillard nodded. \"Punitive action's unadvisable, but we will show our attitude by taking them in. You tell them, Luis; these people seem to like your voice.\"  Gofredo put a hand on each of their shoulders. \"You ... stay ... with us.\" He pointed around the camp. \"You ... stay ... this ... place.\"  Their faces broke into that funny just-before-tears expression that meant happiness with them. The man confined his vocal expressions to his odd _ghroogh-ghroogh_-ing; the woman twittered joyfully. Gofredo put a hand on the woman's shoulder, pointed to the man and from him back to her. \"Unh?\" he inquired.  The woman put a hand on the man's head, then brought it down to within a "]]]
