For a voice user, therefore, the first requisite is a well-developed chest, the second, complete control of it.  It must not be supposed that a singer's breathing is something strange or complex, for it is nothing more than _an amplification of normal, healthy breathing_. In contrast, however, to the undisciplined casual breathing of the general public, the singer is a professional breather.   THE MUSCLES OF RESPIRATION  There are two sets of respiratory muscles, one for inspiration and another for expiration,--twenty-two or more in all. The principal muscles of inspiration are the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles that elevate the ribs. The chief muscles of expiration are the four sets of abdominal muscles and the intercostal muscles that depress the ribs. The diaphragm is _not_ a muscle of _expiration_.   THE DIAPHRAGM  The diaphragm is in form like an inverted bowl (Fig. 8). It forms the floor of the thorax (chest) and the roof of the abdomen. It is attached by a strong tendon to the spinal column behind, and to the walls of the thorax at its lowest part, which is below the ribs. In front its attachment is to the cartilage at the pit of the stomach. It also connects with the transverse abdominal muscle. The diaphragm being convex, in inspiration the contraction of its fibres flattens it downward and presses down the organs in the abdomen, thus increasing the depth of the thorax. Expiration depends wholly on other muscles.  [Illustration: FIGURE 8.]  The muscles so far mentioned are all that need \"conscious education;\" the others will act with them voluntarily, automatically. The abdominal muscles relax during inspiration and the diaphragm relaxes during expiration, thus rendering the forces nearly equal, though the strength is in favor of the expiratory muscles. This is what is needed, for the breath while speaking or singing must go out under much greater tension than is necessary for inhalation. Inspiration should be as free as possible from obstruction when singing or speaking. Expiration must be under _controlled_ pressure.   THE LUNGS  The lungs are spongy bodies which have no activity of their own beyond a little elasticity. They are controlled by the muscles of respiration.  Figure 8 shows the organs of the body in their natural positions. The diaphragm is relaxed and curved upward, as in expiration. During inspiration the diaphragm is drawn down until it lies nearly flat.   INSPIRATION  The intercostal muscles raise the ribs. The diaphragm is drawn down by contraction, thus adding to the enlargement of the chest by increasing its depth. The abdominal muscles relax and allow the stomach, liver, and other organs in the abdomen to move downward to make room for the depressed diaphragm. This causes a vacuum in the chest. The lungs expand to fill this vacuum and the air rushes in to fill the expanding lungs.   EXPIRATION  The intercostal, and a part of the abdominal, muscles depress the ribs and lessen the chest cavity anteriorly and laterally. The abdominal muscles compress the abdomen and force up the diaphragm which is now relaxed, thus lessening the depth of the thorax. This pressure forces the air from the lungs and prepares them for another inspiration.   CORRECT METHOD  That the lateral-abdominal--more accurately chest-abdominal--breathing is correct and natural for both male, and female, and that the shoulders should remain as fixed as were Demosthenes' under the points of the swords hung over them, is now so generally admitted as to need no argument here. If any one has still a doubt on the subject let him observe a sleeping infant. It affords a perfect example of lateral-abdominal breathing, and no one can have a suspicion of sex from any difference in this function. Among the lower animals sex shows no difference in breathing at any age. All the peculiarities of female breathing are the results of habits acquired in after life.  Chest and shoulder heaving are vicious and evidence impeded breathing. The singer who, forgetting the lower thorax, breathes with the upper only is sure to fail. Therefore breathe from the _lower_ part of the trunk, using the whole muscular system coördinately--_from below_ upward. In other words breathe deeply, and _control deeply_, but with the whole body--from below, not with the upper chest only, or with lateral expansion only, or abdominal expansion only.  Every teacher and pupil should remember that \"singing and speaking require wind and muscle,\" hence the breathing power must be fully developed. Weak breathing and failure to properly focus the voice are the most frequent causes of singing off the key. They are much more common and mischievous than lack of \"ear.\"  Dr. May tested the breathing of 85 persons, most of them Indians, and found that 79 out of the 85 used abdominal breathing. The chest breathers were from classes \"civilized\" and more or less \"cultured.\"  Nature has provided that for quiet breathing when at rest the air shall pass through the nose. But when a person is taking active exercise, and consequently demands more air, he naturally and of necessity opens the mouth so as to breathe more fully. While speaking or singing the air is necessarily taken in through the mouth.   BREATH CONTROL  Firmness of tone depends upon steadiness of breath pressure. Steadiness of tone depends upon a control of the breath which allows a minimum volume of air to pass out under sufficient tension to produce vocalization.  The tension and flow of breath can be gradually lessened until the tone vanishes and not even a whisper remains.  Power and largeness of tone depend first upon the =right use of the resonant cavities=, and second upon the =volume of breath used under proper control=.  In producing high tones the breath is delivered in less amount than for the low tones, but under greater tension. Absolute control of the breath is necessary to produce the best results of which a voice is capable. Full control of the breath insures success to a good voice; without it the best voice is doomed to failure.  When muscular action is fully mastered, and the proper method of breathing understood and established, the muscles of inspiration and expiration will act one against the other, so that the act of breathing may be suspended at any moment, whether the lungs are full, or partly full, or empty. This is muscular control of the breath. Correct breathing is health giving and strength giving; it promotes nutrition, lessens the amount of adipose tissue, and reinforces every physical requisite essential to speaking and singing.   A CURE FOR NERVOUSNESS  It cannot be too widely advertised that the surest remedy for that torture of singers and speakers, nervousness, is the great tranquillizer,--quiet, deep breathing, deeply controlled. The breath of nervousness is quick, irregular, and shallow, therefore, take a few, slow, deliberate, deep, and _rhythmic_ inhalations of pure air through the nostrils, and the panting gasp of agitation will vanish. As a help toward deepening the breath and overcoming the spasmodic, clavicular habit, inhale quietly and slowly through the nose, or slowly sip the air through the nearly closed lips as if you were sipping the inmost breath of life itself.   NECESSITY OF BREATHING EXERCISES  To acquire control of breathing, proper exercises must be intelligently and persistently followed. In mankind, nature seems to have been diverted from her normal course so that we seldom find an individual who breathes correctly without education in the matter. What we have said on breathing is based on the premise that respiration involves coördinate action of the body from collar-bone to the base of the abdomen; that is, expanding and contracting the chest and abdomen simultaneously. This is called \"lateral-abdominal\" breathing; as the chest is the thoracic cavity, \"abdomino-thoracic\" has been suggested as brief and more strictly scientific.  Work on any other lines fails to develop the full power and quality of the voice. Weak breathing is a prime cause of throaty tones. In such cases an effort is made to increase the tone by pinching the larynx. But this compresses the vocal cords, increases the resistance to the passage of the breath, and brings rigidities that prevent proper resonance. The true way is to increase the wind supply, as does the organist.   CORRECT BREATHING ILLUSTRATED  The following figures show the outline of correct breathing. The inner abdominal line shows the limit of expiration; the outer line shows the limit of full inspiration.  Figure 9 shows the limit of full expiration and inspiration of the male, side view.  Figure 10 shows the lateral expansion of the ribs in both expiration and inspiration, front view of the male.  The expansion cannot be great at this part of the chest, as the side is so short a distance from the backbone to which the ribs are attached. The movement of the ribs in front is much greater, as Fig. 9 shows.  Figure 11 shows the front expansion and contraction in the breathing of the female, side view.  Figure 12 shows the lateral expansion of the chest in the female, front view.  These diagrams are made from photographs, and thus true to life. It will be noticed that there is no difference in the breathing outline between these subjects. The female subject, though a good singer, had had no training in breathing. She previously insisted that she used only the chest breathing, and did not use the abdominal muscles, but actual test revealed the condition to be that shown in Figure 11 and convinced her that she was mistaken.  [Illustration: FIGURE 9.]  [Illustration: FIGURE 10.]  [Illustration: FIGURE 11.]  [Illustration: FIGURE 12.]  It is not unlikely that many other singers who now think they are using only the high chest respiration would, if subjected to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],["title","Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#5)"],["body"," same test, find themselves similarly mistaken.  The contraction incident to forced expiration is much more tense than the enlargement of forced inspiration. When singing or speaking, forced inspiration is not used. Experience shows that the change in size of the body during speaking or singing is usually small. Occasionally, long passages in music demand that the expulsive power of the breathing apparatus be used to its limit.   ECONOMY OF BREATH  The quantity of air taken in with a single inspiration is, in quiet breathing, according to Prof. Mills,[3] from twenty to thirty cubic inches, but this may be increased in the deepest inspiration to about one hundred cubic inches. In forcible expiration about one hundred cubic inches may be expelled, but even then the residual air that cannot be expelled is about one hundred cubic inches.  [Footnote 3: Dr. Wesley Mills, _Voice Production_, 1906.]  It is not, however, the quantity of breath inhaled that is significant, it is the amount _controlled_. Get, therefore, all the breath necessary, and keep it, but without undue effort and _without rigidity_.  To test the amount of breath used in prolonged vocalization, a person skilled in the art of breathing, after an ordinary inspiration, closed his lips, stopped his nostrils, and began to vocalize. He found that the mouth with distended cheeks held sufficient breath to continue a substantial tone for twenty-three seconds.  While these experiments show that very little amount or force of breath is needed to produce effective tones, the impression must exist in the mind of the performer that there is a free flow of breath through the larynx; otherwise the tone will seem restricted and will be weak. The forced holding back of the breath begets a restraint that has a bad effect on the singer's delivery. While the breath must be controlled, there is such a thing as an exaggerated \"breath control\" that makes free delivery of the voice impossible.  It is quite possible to _overcrowd_ the lungs with air. Do not, therefore, make the mistake of always taking the largest possible breath. Reserve this for the climaxes, and inhale according to the requirements of the phrase and its dynamics. The constant taking of too much breath is a common mistake, but trying to sing too long on one breath is another.   THE INITIAL USE OF BREATH FORCE  The breath force when properly employed seems to be expended in starting the vibrations in the larynx; the vibrations are then transmitted to the air in the resonance cavities, and there the perfected tone sets the outer air in motion, through which the tone vibrations are conveyed to the ear of the listener.   RESERVE BREATH POWER  The correctly trained singer or speaker will never allow the breath power to be exhausted. Some breath should be taken in at every convenient interval between the words, according to the punctuation, but never between syllables of a word; this is correct phrasing. In this way the lungs are kept nearly full, and breathing is at its best.  The chief cause of breath exhaustion is _wasted_ breath. This waste comes from exhaling more breath (more motive power) than the tone requires, and _breath that does not become tone is wasted_. This fault is largely induced by lack of proper resonance adjustment.  The singer should always feel able to sing another note or to speak another word. To sing or speak thirty or forty counts with one breath is useful practice but poor performance. Occasionally, long runs in singing may compel an exception. Half-empty lungs lower the pitch of the tone, lessen the resonance, and weaken the voice, rendering the last note of the song and the last word of the sentence inaudible. The breathing must not be forced, but enough air must be furnished to produce the proper full vibrations.   BREATH MASTERY  What then does perfect control of the breath mean?  1. Ability to fill the lungs to their capacity either quickly or slowly.  2. Ability to breathe out as quickly or slowly as the occasion demands.  3. Ability to suspend inspiration, with the throat open, whether the lungs are full or not, and to resume the process at will without having lost any of the already inspired air.  4. Ability to exhale under the same restrictions.  The above four points are common to speaking and singing, but singing involves further:  5. Ability to sing and sustain the voice on an _ordinary_ breath.  6. Ability to _quietly_ breathe as often as text and phrase permit.  7. Ability to breathe so that the fullest inspiration _brings no fatigue_.  8. Ability to so economize the breath that the _reserve is never exhausted_.  9. The ability to breathe so naturally, so unobtrusively, that _neither breath nor lack of breath is ever suggested to the listener_--this is the very perfection of the art.     CHAPTER IV  BREATHING EXERCISES   Enough has been said in the preceding chapter to make clear the necessity of breath control, and to show what constitutes this control for the singer--the professional breather.  If the singer's breathing is nothing but an amplification of normal, healthy breathing, why dwell upon it, why not let it develop of itself?  Unfortunately, many teachers have taken this attitude, overlooking the fact that, although life is dependent on normal, healthy breathing, such breathing is, in civilized communities, not the rule but the exception, simply because normal living is rare; the artificiality of modern life forbids it. The high pressure under which most people live induces mental tension together with the consequent nervous and muscular tension. We are, without being conscious of it, so habituated to unnatural tension that automatic breathing is shallow and irregular instead of being deep and rhythmic.  The task, therefore, is to reclaim a neglected birthright--natural breathing--to make it habitual and amplify it.   PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS  1. Breathing exercises to be invigorating and purifying demand plenty of fresh air.  2. At first do not practise longer than ten minutes at a time, three times a day.  3. Gradually lengthen the time without overdoing. When tired stop.  4. The best time is before dressing in the morning, with the window open. The worst time is directly after a meal.  5. Maintain throughout an easy, flexible poise.  6. Breathe as _deeply_ as possible without abdominal distention. The greatest expansion should be felt at the lower end of the breast-bone.  7. Breathe as _broadly_ as possible, expanding the sides without tension.  8. Breathe as _high_ as possible without shoulder movement or stiffness.  9. Use not the high breath alone, or the mid-breath, or the low breath, but use the _complete_ breath.  10. Breathe _rhythmically_ by counting mentally.  11. Breathe _thoughtfully_ rather than mechanically.  12. Do not crowd the lungs or lay stress on the mere quantity of air you can inhale. The intake of breath is, for the singer, secondary to its control, economy, and application in song. Increase of lung capacity will duly appear.  13. When not singing, speaking or practising an exercise that demands it, _keep your mouth shut_.   ATTITUDE  Dress the neck and body loosely, so as to give the throat and trunk perfect freedom. Place the hands on the hips, so as to free the chest from the weight of the arms. Stand erect, evenly upon the balls of the feet; the body straight, but not strained. Raise the back of the head slightly without bending the neck. This action will straighten the spine, place the chest forward, and bring the abdomen backward into its proper relation.  The great majority of people are shallow breathers, chest breathers, who when told to take a \"deep breath\" do not know what is meant. It is therefore necessary for them first to learn what a deep breath is, and then how to take it.   Exercise I  FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT A DEEP BREATH IS  Before rising in the morning, remove your pillow and while flat on your back place one hand lightly on the abdomen, the other on the lower ribs. Relax the whole body, giving up your whole weight to the bed. Inhale through the nostrils slowly, evenly, and deeply, while mentally counting one, two, three, four, etc. As you inhale, notice (_a_) the gradual expansion of the abdomen, (_b_) the side expansion of the lower ribs, (_c_) the rise and inflation of the chest, without raising the shoulders. Hold the breath while mentally counting four (four seconds), then suddenly let the breath go, and notice the collapse of the abdomen and lower chest. Remember _the inspiration must be slow and deep, the expiration sudden and complete_. Practise this preliminary exercise for not more than ten minutes each morning for a week. The second week hold the breath six seconds, instead of four, and gradually increase the time, without overdoing.  While, for a novice, the exercises may be taken at first in bed, this is but a preliminary to their practise standing in easy poise as directed in the preceding section.   Exercise II  SLOW INHALATION WITH SUDDEN EXPULSION  Inhale as in I; hold the breath four counts (seconds) or more; then expel the air vigorously in one breath through the wide open mouth. The beginner is often helped in acquiring a deep breath by slowly sipping breath. Therefore as a variant to Exercise II practise:   Exercise III  SIPPING THE BREATH, WITH QUICK EXHALATION  Through the smallest possible opening of the lips, while mentally counting, inhale very slowly and steadily; hold two to four counts, then expel the air all at once through the wide open mouth.   Exercise IV  FOR RIB EXPANSION  To more completely arouse dormant muscles that should play an important part in breathing, place the hands against the sides, thumbs well back, take, through the nostrils or the slightly parted lips, six short catch-breaths, moving the ribs _out at the side_ with each catch-breath. Hold the breath two counts, and exhale through the mouth with six short expiratory puffs, drawing the ribs _in at the side_"]]]
