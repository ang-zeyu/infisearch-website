Lone was heading for the Quirt ranch by the most direct route, fearing, perhaps, that if he waited he would lose his nerve and would not go at all. Yet it was important that he should go; he must return the girl's purse!  The most direct route to the Quirt took him down Juniper Ridge and across Granite Creek near the Thurman ranch. Indeed, if he followed the trail up Granite Creek and across the hilly country to Quirt Creek, he must pass within fifty yards of the Thurman cabin. Lone's time was limited, yet he took the direct route rather reluctantly. He did not want to be reminded too sharply of Fred Thurman as a man who had lived his life in his own way and had died so horribly.  \"Well, he didn't have it coming to him--but it's done and over with, now, so it's no use thinking about it,\" he reflected, when the roofs of the Thurman ranch buildings began to show now and then through the thin ranks of the cottonwoods along the creek.  But his face sobered as he rode along. It seemed to him that the sleepy little meadows, the quiet murmuring of the creek, even the soft rustling of the cottonwood leaves breathed a new loneliness, an emptiness where the man who had called this place home, who had clung to it in the face of opposition that was growing into open warfare, had lived and had left life suddenly--unwarrantably, Lone knew in his heart. It might be of no use to think about it, but the vivid memory of Fred Thurman was with him when he rode up the trail to the stable and the small corrals. He had to think, whether he would or no.  At the corral he came unexpectedly in sight of the Swede, who grinned a guileless welcome and came toward him, so that Lone could not ride on unless he would advertise his dislike of the place. John Doe, plainly glad to find an excuse to stop, slowed and came to where Swan waited by the gate.  \"By golly, this is lonesome here,\" Swan complained, heaving a great sigh. \"That judge don't get busy pretty quick, I'm maybe jumping my job. Lone, what you think? You believe in ghosts?\"  \"Naw. What's on your chest, Swan?\" Lone slipped sidewise in the saddle, resting his muscles. \"You been seeing things?\"  \"No--I don't be seeing things, Lone. But sometimes I been--like I _feel_ something.\" He stared at Lone questioningly. \"What you think, Lone, if you be sitting down eating your supper, maybe, and you feel something say words in your brain? Like you know something talks to you and then quits.\"  Lone gave Swan a long, measuring look, and Swan laughed uneasily.  \"That sounds crazy. But it's true, what something tells me in my brain. I go and look, and by golly, it's there just like the words tell me.\"  Lone straightened in the saddle. \"You better come clean, Swan, and tell the whole thing. What was it? Don't talk in circles. What words did you feel--in your brain?\" In spite of himself, Lone felt as he had when the girl had talked to him and called him Charlie.  Swan closed the gate behind him with steady hands. His lips were pressed firmly together, as if he had definitely made up his mind to something. Lone was impressed somehow with Swan's perfect control of his speech, his thoughts, his actions. But he was puzzled rather than anything else, and when Swan turned, facing him, Lone's bewilderment did not lessen.  \"I'll tell you. It's when I'm sitting down to eat my supper. I'm just reaching out my hand like this, to get my coffee. And something says in my head, 'It's a lie. I don't ride backwards. Go look at my saddle. There's blood----' And that's all. It's like the words go far away so I can't hear any more. So I eat my supper, and then I get the lantern and I go look. You come with me, Lone. I'll show you.\"  Without a word Lone dismounted and followed Swan into a small shed beside the stable, where a worn stock saddle hung suspended from a crosspiece, a rawhide string looped over the horn. Lone did not ask whose saddle it was, nor did Swan name the owner. There was no need.  Swan took the saddle and swung it around so that the right side was toward them. It was what is called a full-stamped saddle, with the popular wild-rose design on skirts and cantle. Much hard use and occasional oilings had darkened the leather to a rich, red brown, marred with old scars and scratches and the stains of many storms.  \"Blood is hard to find when it's raining all night,\" Swan observed, speaking low as one does in the presence of death. \"But if somebody is bleeding and falls off a horse slow, and catches hold of things and tries like hell to hang on----\" He lifted the small flap that covered the cinch ring and revealed a reddish, flaked stain. Phlegmatically he wetted his finger tip on his tongue, rubbed the stain and held up his finger for Lone to see. \"That's a damn funny place for blood, when a man is dragging on the ground,\" he commented drily. \"And something else is damn funny, Lone.\"  He lifted the wooden stirrup and touched with his finger the rowel marks. \"That is on the front part,\" he said. \"I could swear in court that Fred's left foot was twisted--that's damn funny, Lone. I don't see men ride backwards, much.\"  Lone turned on him and struck the stirrup from his hand. \"I think you better forget it,\" he said fiercely. \"He's dead--it can't help him any to----\" He stopped and pulled himself together. \"Swan, you take a fool's advice and don't tell anybody else about feeling words talk in your head. They'll have you in the bug-house at Blackfoot, sure as you live.\" He looked at the saddle, hesitated, looked again at Swan, who was watching him. \"That blood most likely got there when Fred was packing a deer in from the hills. And marks on them old oxbow stirrups don't mean a damn thing but the need of a new pair, maybe.\" He forced a laugh and stepped outside the shed. \"Just shows you, Swan, that imagination and being alone all the time can raise Cain with a fellow. You want to watch yourself.\"  Swan followed him out, closing the door carefully behind him. \"By golly, I'm watching out now,\" he assented thoughtfully. \"You don't tell anybody, Lone.\"  \"No, I won't tell anybody--and I'd advise you not to,\" Lone repeated grimly. \"Just keep those thoughts outa your head, Swan. They're bad medicine.\"  He mounted John Doe and rode away, his eyes downcast, his quirt slapping absently the weeds along the trail. It was not his business, and yet---- Lone shook himself together and put John Doe into a lope. He had warned Swan, and he could do no more.  Halfway to the Quirt he met Lorraine riding along the trail. She would have passed him with no sign of recognition, but Lone lifted his hat and stopped. Lorraine looked at him, rode on a few steps and turned. \"Did you wish to speak about something?\" she asked impersonally.  Lone felt the flush in his cheeks, which angered him to the point of speaking curtly. \"Yes. I found your purse where you dropped it that night you were lost. I was bringing it over to you. My name's Morgan. I'm the man that found you and took you in to the ranch.\"  \"Oh.\" Lorraine looked at him steadily. \"You're the one they call Loney?\"  \"When they're feeling good toward me. I'm Lone Morgan. I went back to find your grip--you said you left it under a bush, but the world's plumb full of bushes. I found your purse, though.\"  \"Thank you so much. I must have been an awful nuisance, but I was so scared--and things were terribly mixed in my mind. I didn't even have sense enough to tell you what ranch I was trying to find, did I? So you took me to the wrong one, and I was a week there before I found it out. And then they were perfectly lovely about it and brought me--home.\" She turned the purse over and over in her hands, looking at it without much interest. She seemed in no hurry to ride on, which gave Lone courage.  \"There's something I'd like to say,\" he began, groping for words that would make his meaning plain without telling too much. \"I hope you won't mind my telling you. You were kinda out of your head when I found you, and you said something about seeing a man shot and----\"  \"Oh!\" Lorraine looked up at him, looked through him, he thought, with those brilliant eyes of hers. \"Then I did tell----\"  \"I just wanted to say,\" Lone interrupted her, \"that I knew all the time it was just a nightmare. I never mentioned it to anybody, and you'll forget all about it, I hope. You didn't tell any one else, did you?\"  He looked up at her again and found her studying him curiously. \"You're not the man I saw,\" she said, as if she were satisfying herself on that point. \"I've wondered since--but I was sure, too, that I had seen it. Why mustn't I tell any one?\"  Lone did not reply at once. The girl's eyes were disconcertingly direct, her voice and her manner disturbed him with their judicial calmness, so at variance with the wildness he remembered.  \"Well, it's hard to explain,\" he said at last. \"You're strange to this country, and you don't know all the ins and outs of--things. It wouldn't do any good to you or anybody else, and it might do a lot of harm.\" His eyes nicked her face with a wistful glance. \"You don't know me--I really haven't got any right to ask or expect you to trust me. But I wish you would, to the extent of forgetting that you saw--or thought you saw--anything that night in Rock City.\"  Lorraine shivered and covered her eyes swiftly with one hand. His words had brought back too sharply that scene. But she shook off the emotion and faced him again.  \"I saw a man murdered,\" she cried. \"I wasn't sure afterwards; sometimes I thought I had dreamed it. But I was sure I saw it. I saw the horse go by, running--and you want me to keep still about that? What harm could it do to tell? Perhaps it's true--perhaps I did see it all. I might think you were trying to cover up something--only, you're not the man I saw--or thought I saw.\"  \"No, of course I'm not. You dreamed the whole thing, and the way you talked to me was so wild, folks would say you're crazy if they heard you tell it.

DON'T HE LOOK FIERCE?\"         *       *       *       *       *     _Mr. Wagner Buys a Goat_   Mr. Wagner lived about two miles from a small town, and he thought it would be nice for his boys to have a little goat cart, so they could drive into town for mail and do errands for the family.  Without saying anything to his family, he appeared one evening leading a nice, docile looking, long-bearded Billy goat, hitched to a beautiful new red wagon.  Of course, the boys were wild with delight, and their mother disgusted, for she predicted that he would be more bother than he was worth, and would eat up all the things in the garden. They answered her that they would take good care that he never got loose, and that no wrong would happen, if she would only let them keep the goat. So with many misgivings she gave her consent, and Billy was led to the stable behaving like a lamb.  The boys christened him Billy Whiskers immediately, on account of his long white beard. It being a warm night, they tied him near a shed, so if it rained he could go under it for protection, and giving him some grass and a bucket of water, they went to bed to dream of the fun they were going to have the next day with Billy Whiskers.  It was five hours later when Billy awakened from his first long sleep, and feeling refreshed, thought he would take a look around. It was bright moonlight, and as all the lights were out in the house, he knew he would not be disturbed, for when he went to a new place he did not like to be interfered with when he made his first explorations, and he always preferred making them at night, and alone. You will no doubt think that he could not explore much, tied to a short rope, but if you think the rope made any difference you do not know the ways of an educated goat, and Billy had no Kindergarten education either, but a regular High School training in that respect.  He turned, and taking the rope in his mouth as he had done many times before, he quietly and peacefully chewed it until it fell apart, and then with a kick of his heels, and a wink at the house, he went toward the garden. From this direction the evening breeze was wafting to his nostrils sweet odors of dew-sprinkled lettuce and tender beet tops.  He ate up all the lettuce, or at least all the choice heads, and what beets he did not eat, he stepped on. Then he walked across the flower beds, and trampled down all the flowers, in a short cut to the pump, for he was getting thirsty.  On his way to the pump he thought he saw a man coming down the road, so he hurried along and went up on the veranda of the house to stand in the shadow until the man went by, for he knew that men often interfere with a goat's pleasure, even if it is only a moonlight stroll.  The man having passed, he walked around the veranda trying every now and then to look in at the window to see what kind of a house his new master had. At last he came to the front door and he could not help trying to taste the bell knob, it looked so much like a knob of salt in the moonlight. To be sure he knew that it was not salt, but it did look so good to eat, and he had often eaten things before that were not down on the diet list of a goat, so he took another chew but, horrors! what was that! There was a terrible ringing and clanging in the house,--it sounded like a fire bell; and the next minute Mr. Wagner stuck his head out of the window and wanted to know who was there. Of course there was no answer, and Billy stood as still as possible to listen and see what Mr. Wagner would do next; then he walked to the edge of the porch, and heard Mr. Wagner say, \"Who is there? Can't you answer, or are you deaf and dumb, or drunk?\"  [Illustration]  Still no response, and Billy walked back and gave another lick at the bell, which immediately gave another loud ring. Mr. Wagner drew his head in, and Billy heard him say, \"I'll come down and break your stupid head for you, wakening people up this time of the night!\" When Billy heard this, he thought that it was time to go, so he scooted around the house, and went and laid down by his rope, just as if he were still tied and had not stirred a peg.  Mr. Wagner opened the door, and finding no one there, walked around the house holding a candle over his head to see if some drunken tramp had not rung the bell. He thought that he heard steps on the veranda as he came to the door, but no one was in sight only Billy Whiskers, apparently asleep by the shed.  \"Hello! Billy old fellow, how are you getting along? Seen anyone around here lately?\"  But Billy only blinked and laughed in his skin to see Mr. Wagner prancing around in his night-shirt, with the tallow from the candle dropping on his bald head.  Mr. Wagner went in and was about to get into bed, when he thought he saw in the moonlight a figure come out of the shed and go toward the house. The moon went under a cloud just at that minute and was hid from sight, so he kept still, straining his eyes to see and his ears to hear. He heard the chain rattle on the bucket at the well.  \"Oh! ho!\" he thought, \"the tramp thinks that I have gone to bed, and that he will get a drink, and then prowl around some more. Well, we will see. I will just get my shot gun and fire a shot to scare him, if he does not answer.\"  So grabbing his gun, which always stood by the window loaded for use, he called out again:  \"Who is there? Speak, or I'll shoot!\"  As the words left his mouth, an object started on a run from the well, and Mr. Wagner fired, not stopping to see what it was, but supposing it to be a man. Just then the moon sailed from under the cloud, and there in the moonlight lay poor Billy Whiskers stunned and nearly frightened to death with a flesh wound in his side. When Mr. Wagner saw what he had done, and that it was only the goat, he pulled down the window, and went to bed, too mad to even go to see if the goat was dead or not.  The next morning Billy was as lively as ever, only a little faint from loss of blood and rather subdued. The children bathed his wound with witch hazel, and after a good breakfast, he was as well as ever, and ready for play or work.  Of course Mrs. Wagner said, \"I told you so,\" several times, only varying it with, \"Yes, you just wait and see, that goat will get into more trouble than he is worth, just see if he won't.\"  When she said this, she did not know of the midnight meal off her nice lettuce he had had in the garden.  Billy did not get into much mischief during the remainder of the day, except chewing up the dish-rags which were hung on the lilac bush to dry, and all the flowers off the oleander.  The next day was his unlucky day, maybe because it was Friday. It happened in this way, Mr. Wagner had some extra nice strawberries, which he had taken special pains to pick and fix up, intending to send them to a friend in town. He told the boys that they could take the goat cart and drive into town, with the berries and some nice lettuce for his friend, and get the mail on the way back.  The boys were delighted at the prospect of driving Billy in the new cart. They packed the things in nicely, and hitching Billy up, drove out of the lane in fine style, on a fast trot. Everything went well until half-way to town, when Jimmy Brown sicked his dog on the goat, and then the trouble commenced.  [Illustration: IN TWO MINUTES, HE HAD SENT THE DOG FLYING OVER THE FENCE.]  Billy Whiskers made a plunge for the dog, missed him, but gave the cart a quick jerk, which spilled the boys and the berries out in great shape, and then the scrimmage began. The boys went for Jimmy Brown, and the goat for the dog, dragging the overturned cart with him, and in two minutes, he had sent the dog flying over the fence, with his sharp horns. He then proceeded to walk quietly back to where the strawberries and lettuce were lying in the road, and commenced eating them, as if nothing had happened at all. All this time the boys were pulling each other's hair, and rolling over in the dust, in a regular pitched battle. Billy having eaten all he cared for, walked off and lay down in the shade to rest, still dragging the cart after him. He was just losing himself in sleep, when he was jerked to his feet in a hurry; the cart was straightened; and before he knew what he was about, he was being driven toward home as fast as his legs could go, and from the conversation he learned that they had taken their departure so hurriedly because they had"]]]
