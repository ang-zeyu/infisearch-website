Down shining ways the flying sleighs       Go jingling by, and see!     Beside the gate the horses wait       And neigh for you and me!     SLEEPY TIME       Hey, baby! Ho, baby! here upon my knee,     See the firelight flicker over you and me!      See the tiny people basking in the glow,     Peering through the ruddy little coals, and so      How they dance and scamper! Merry fairy folk!     Little sparks for spangles, little wings of smoke!      Come baby, come baby, nestle in my arms;     Hear the purring flames now sing their sleepy charms.      All the firelight fairies, all the drowsy elves,     In the downy ashes cover up themselves.      And I fold the little blanket over you;     Bye baby, my baby, let us slumber too.     WHEN BETTIE AND ANNE WENT WALKING           When they took their dollies walking,         They were both so busy talking,     (They had not met for half an hour and so had much to say)         That they heedlessly kept going         Down the shady streets, not knowing,     Till they wanted to come back again, they could not find the way!          In their fright they felt forlorner         Every time they turned a corner,     And they wailed to one another, \"Oh, whatever shall we do?         A big bear might come to bite us,         Or a dreadful dog to fight us,     Or the wicked gipsies get us! _Oh, boo-hoo! Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo!_\"          But this story, though a sad one,         Has an end that's not a bad one,     For at last somebody found them as they bade the world good-by;         They took their dollies home again,         And vowed they'd never roam again,     And their mothers hugged and kissed them, saying, \"There, my dears,             don't cry!\"     THE BLUEBIRD       To-day at dawn there twinkled through     The pearly mist a flash of blue       So dazzling bright I thought the sky       Shone through the rifted clouds on high,               Till, by and by,     A note so honey-sweet I heard,     I knew that bright flash was a bird!     THE ORGAN-GRINDER       Hark! I hear the organ-grinder       Coming down the street,     And the sudden clatter-patter       Of the children's feet!      Come, oh, let us run to meet him!       Did you ever hear     Tunes so gay as he is playing,       Or so sweet and clear?      See the brown-faced little monkey,       Impudent and bold,     With his little scarlet jacket       Braided all in gold!      And his tiny cap and tassel       Bobbing to and fro,     Look, oh, look! he plucks it off now,       Bowing very low.      And he's passing it politely--       Can it be for _pay_?     O dear me! I have no penny!       Let us run away!     THE NEW MOON       Pretty new moon, little new moon,       Now, as first I look at you,     I must make a wish, for wise folks       Say it surely will come true!      Little new moon, pretty new moon,       I wish--but I must not tell!     For if any one should hear it,       Wise folks say it breaks the spell!     SHOWERY TIME       The April rain-drops tinkle       In cuckoo-cups of gold,     And warm south winds unwrinkle       The buds the peach-boughs hold.      In countless fluted creases       The little elm-leaves show,     While white as carded fleeces       The dogwood blossoms blow.      A rosy robe is wrapping       The early red-bud trees;     But still the haws are napping,       Nor heed the honey-bees.      And still in lazy sleeping       The apple-buds are bound,     But tulip-tips are peeping       From out the garden ground.      And yonder, gayly swinging       Upon the turning vane,     A robin redbreast singing       Makes merry at the rain!     EASTER DAY       Christ the Lord is risen to-day!     Angels rolled the stone away     From the tomb wherein He lay!      Little children, come and sing,     \"Glory, glory to the King,     Christ the Lord of everything!\"     THE SANDMAN       The Sandman! hark, I hear him!       He's coming up the stair,     And everybody near him       Is nodding, I declare!      He's peeping in the door now,       And first of all he spies,     As he has done before now,       The little children's eyes!      Then quickly does he throw it,       His golden sleepy-sand,     And all, before they know it,       Are off for sleepy-land!     DANDELION CURLS       Ah, ha, ha, now! who comes here     Wreathed in flowers of gold and queer     Tiny tangled curls of green     Gayly bobbing in between?      Pretty token of the spring!     Hark! we hear the bluebirds sing     When we thus see little girls     Decked in dandelion curls.     POP-CORN                _Pop! Pop!--Poppetty-pop!_     Shake and rattle and rattle and shake     The golden grains as they bounce and break     To fluffy puffiness--_Poppetty-pop!_     Bursting and banging the popper's top!              _Poppetty-pop!                   Pop! Pop!_      The yellow kernels, oh, see them grow     White as cotton or flakes of snow!                _Pop! Pop!_     O-ho, how they frolic and fly about     And turn themselves suddenly inside out!     _Pop-pop-poppetty! Pop-pop-pop!_     The popper's full and we'll have to stop;     Pile the bowl with the tempting treat,     Children, come, it is time to eat!     THE RASH LITTLE SPARROW         Rash little sparrow         Up in the nest;     Feathers not long enough,     Wee wings not strong enough!         Poor little sparrow!         Poor little breast!     WHAT IF?       When I see the new moon lightly      Through cloud ripples slip,     Then I'm sure that shining brightly      It's a fairy ship!      What if in it we were sailing      Far and far away,     With a wake of silver trailing,      Till the golden day?      Why, we'd fly back home together      Safely from the sky,     For the moon's a fairy feather      When the sun is high!     EASTER EGGS       Seven little nests of hay     We have made, for Easter day     Is to-morrow, and you know     We must have them ready, so     When the Rabbit comes she'll see     We expected her, that we     Children tried our very best     Each to make the nicest nest.      One is in the lilac-bush,     Near the ground--last year a thrush     Built a nest there--let me see,     Two are by the apple-tree,     In the clover--that makes three--     One beside the playhouse door,     --Three plus one, that must be four--     Two are in the tulip-bed--     Was it seven that I said?     Oh, yes! six I've counted, and     One is in our pile of sand.         *       *       *       *       *      Come and see! Oh, hurry, hurry!     For the Rabbit, kind and furry,     Has been here again and laid     Eggs in every nest we made!     Purple, orange, red, and blue,     Pink and green and yellow, too,     Like a bunch of finest flowers     Ever seen, and all are ours!     And oh, _look!_ What _do_ you think!     Here our names are in white ink,     All spelled nicely so we know     Just where every egg should go!     Is it not surprising, quite,     How well Easter Rabbits write?     THE BIRDS' BATH       In our garden we have made       Such a pretty little pool,     Lined with pebbles neatly laid,       Filled with water clean and cool.      [Illustration: THE BIRDS' BATH]      When the sun shines warm and high       Robins cluster round its brink,     Never one comes flying by       But will flutter down to drink.      Then they splash and splash and splash,       Spattering little showers bright     All around, till off they flash       Singing sweetly their delight.     NOVEMBER MORNING       A tingling, misty marvel       Blew hither in the night,     And now the little peach-trees       Are clasped in frozen light.      Upon the apple-branches       An icy film is caught,     With trailing threads of gossamer       In pearly patterns wrought.      The autumn sun, in wonder,       Is gayly peering through     This silver-tissued network       Across the frosty blue.      The weather-vane is fire-tipped,       The honeysuckle shows     A dazzling icy splendor,       And crystal is the rose.      Around the eaves are fringes       Of icicles that seem     To mock the summer rainbows       With many-colored gleam.      Along the walk, the pebbles       Are each a precious stone;     The grass is tasseled hoarfrost,       The clover jewel-sown.      Such sparkle, sparkle, sparkle       Fills all the frosty air,     Oh, can it be that darkness       Is ever anywhere!     THE RUNAWAY       A frantic clatter of horses' feet!     A runaway's coming down the street!           Flurry, scurry,           Children, hurry!     Drop your playthings! Quick! don't wait!     Run and get within the gate!     Push the baby in the door,     Scramble in yourselves before           --_Whoa! Whoa!_           There they go!     Pell-mell rushing, snorting, quaking,     Wagon rumbling, harness breaking,     Frightened so they cannot know     Everybody's shrieking \"_Whoa!_\"           O my, don't cry!       Whiz, bang, they've galloped by!     No one hurt, but horses dashed     Round a post and wagon smashed!           Dear me! Dear me!       When a runaway we see,     Children, too, must run, oh, fast!     Run and hide as it goes past!     LOST!       \"Peep! Peep! Peep!\" Poor little chick!       Little cry so weak and small,     Meadow grass so tall and thick,       And the clover tufts so tall!      Little heart in sore distress,       Longing for the mother wing;     Through the weedy wilderness       Searching for its sheltering!     THE QUEEN'S PAGE       Once I was a little page       To a May-day queen,     And I wore a little coat       Made of Lincoln green.      Oh, the queen was beautiful!       And she had a bright     Crown of golden cuckoo-buds       And violets blue and white.      On the step beside her throne       I sat very still,     Ready, as a page should be,       To obey her will.      And before us little girls,       Each with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19389"],["title","Child Songs of Cheer (#3)"],["body"," gay,     Round a May-pole danced and sang       Almost all the day.     OUR TREE-TOAD       Grandfather says the tree-toad,       That to our yard has come,     Is just a little wee toad       No bigger than his thumb!      And that his coat's so queer it       Can turn from green to blue!     Whatever color's near it,       Why, that's its color, too!      And then Grandfather snickers       And says, \"Would you suppose     He climbs with little stickers       On all his little toes?      \"And don't you wish your toes now       Were fixed like his? For, see,     Right up the elm he goes now       And sticks tight to the tree!\"      \"But then,\" he says, \"O dear me!       If all the little boys     Could _screech_ as loud, I fear me       There'd be a dreadful noise!\"     IN THE WATER-WORLD       Down among the water-weeds,       Darting through the grass,     Round about the tasseled reeds,       See the minnows pass!     See the little turtles there,       Hiding, half asleep,     Tucked in tangled mosses where       Tiny crayfish creep!      Watch the trailing grasses string       Strands of purple shells     That the lazy ripples ring,       Sweet as silver bells;     Watch the sunshine sift and drift       Down the eddy whirls,     Whence the laden whiteweeds lift       Loads of blossom pearls;      While the limpid shadows slip       Softly in between,     And the pussy-willows dip       Lightly in the green     Of the mocking trees that grow       Down the water-sky,     Flecked with fleecy clouds that blow       Where the reed-birds fly.      Oh, such marvels manifold       Fill the summer stream,     Such enticing things untold       Through the ripples gleam,     If you could a moment turn       Into what you wish,     Would it not be fun to be       Yonder little fish?     WHO WAS IT?       Of course I've heard the moon's green cheese,     But will somebody tell me, please,     Who was it took so big a bite     There's scarcely any left to-night?     VISITING DAY       I'll wear the striped skirt that trails,       And you the flowered one,     And we will take our parasols       And walk out in the sun.      We'll leave our dolly-carts at home,       For ladies, when they call,     Must not have children with them, no,       That would not do at all.      And I'll be \"Mrs. Wilkinson,\"       And you'll be \"Mrs. Brown,\"     And we will call and call and call       On every one in town!     A VALENTINE TO CATHERINE       If you will be my True-Love,       I'll tell you what I'll do,     I'll ask a little bluebird       To sing a song to you.      When first you see a violet       And softly pricking through     The garden-bed come crocuses       And golden tulips, too,      Then watch! for he'll be coming,       The little bird of blue;     He'll sing, \"I love you, Sweetheart,       It's true, true, true!\"     FIREFLIES       Look! Look down in the garden how     The firefly lights are flitting now!     A million tiny sparks I know     Flash through the pinks and golden-glow,     And I am very sure that all     Have come to light a fairy ball,     And if I could stay up I'd see     How gay the fairy folks can be!     THE RAINY DAY       Let's sail all day, away, away       To the splendid Spanish Main     And the sultry seas of the Caribbees       And skies that never rain!      As pirates bold with bags of gold       And cutlasses and things,     We'll pack doubloons and silver spoons       In chests with iron rings.      And these we'll carry and secretly bury       In cannibal isles afar;     Like Captain Kidd, when they're safely hid       We won't tell where they are.      Let's sail all day, away, away       To the splendid Spanish Main     And the sultry seas of the Caribbees       --But at night sail home again!     THE FIRST RED-BIRD       I heard a song at daybreak,       So honey-sweet and clear,     The essence of all joyous things       Seemed mingling in its cheer.      The frosty world about me       I searched with eager gaze,     But all was slumber-bound and wrapped       In violet-tinted haze.      Then suddenly a sunbeam       Shot slanting o'er the hill,     And once again from out the sky       I heard that honied trill.      And there upon a poplar,       Poised at its topmost height,     I saw a little singer clad       In scarlet plumage bright.      The poplar branches quivered,       By dawn winds lightly blown,     And like a breeze-swept poppy-flower       The red-bird rocked and shone.      The blue sky, and his feathers       Flashed o'er by golden light,     Oh, all my heart with rapture thrilled,       It was so sweet a sight!     THE WEATHER-VANE       Turn, turn, when pelting rain     Rushes down the window-pane;     Turn, turn, and turn again     When the sun shines, weather-vane!        Fie! Fie! to always be       Emblem of uncertainty!       Followed by the restless sea,     Changeful moons may wax and wane,       Yet the moons and sea-tides, too,       Constant are compared to you!     Fickle still you must remain     Long as winds blow, weather-vane!     THE SWAN       Stately swan, so proud and white     Glistening in the morning light,     Come and tell me is it true     That a snow-white swan like you,     Guided by bright golden chains     In his beak for bridle reins,     Once upon a time from far     Fabled lands where fairies are     Brought a magic boat wherein     Rode the brave knight Lohengrin?      Stately swan, so proud and white     Glistening in the morning light,     If you only wore a gold     Harness, like that swan of old,     And if trailing in your wake     Sailing on the silver lake     Was a boat of magic and     You could float to fairy-land,     Then I'd jump in and begin     Traveling like Lohengrin!     BABY'S BAKING       So, so, spade and hoe,       Little pile of sand;     See it turning into dough       In the baby's hand!      Little pie with crimpy crust,       Set it in the sun;     Sugar it with powdered dust,       And bake it till it's done.     A SURE SIGN       When you see upon the walk     Circles newly made of chalk,     And around them all the day     Little boys in eager play     Rolling marbles, agates fine,     Banded, polished, red as wine,     Marbles crystal as the dew,     Each with rainbows twisted through,     Marbles gay in painted clay,     Flashing, twinkling in your way,     When the walk has blossomed so,     Surely every one must know     None need wonder who has heard     Robin, wren, or Peter-bird;     Sure the sign as song or wing,           It is spring!     ANOTHER SURE SIGN       When pink-cheeked on every hand     Little girls are seen to stand     Turning skipping ropes,--_swish-swash!_--     While their laughing playmates run     Jumping over,--oh, what fun!--       _Swish-swash! Swish-swash!_     Two and two now, see them dash!       _One, two, one, two,_     Round they scamper, safely through,     _Swish-swash!_ such merry skipping,     _One, two,_--some one is tripping!     Ah, she's out now and must pay     Turning rope while others play!     See the bobbing golden curls,     Little skirts in rhythmic swirls     Rising, falling, to the beat     Of the little skipping feet!     When these pretty sights appear,     It is surely very clear             April's here!     THE ROBIN'S BATH       A flash and flicker of dripping wings,       A wet red breast that glows     Bright as the newly opened bud       The first red poppy shows,     A sparkle of flying rainbow drops,       A glint of golden sun     On ruffled feathers, a snatch of song,       And the robin's bath is done.     THE FROSTED PANE           When I wakened, very early,         All my window-pane was pearly     With a sparkling little picture traced in lines of shining white;         Some magician with a gleaming         Frosty brush, while I was dreaming,     Must have come and by the starlight worked through all the quiet night.          He had painted frosty people,         And a frosty church and steeple,     And a frosty bridge and river tumbling over frosty rocks;         Frosty mountain peaks that glimmered,         And fine frosty ferns that shimmered,     And a frosty little pasture full of frosty little flocks.          It was all touched in so lightly         And it glittered, oh, so whitely,     That I gazed and gazed in wonder at the lovely painted pane;         Then the sun rose high and higher         With his wand of golden fire     Till, alas, my picture vanished and I looked for it in vain!     THE FIRST SNOW       The snow! the snow! Whoop! Hooray! Ho! Ho!     Plunge in the deep drifts and toss it up so!       Rollick and roll in the feathery fleece       Plucked out of the breasts of the marvelous geese     By the little old woman who lives in the sky;     Have ever you seen her? No, neither have I!     GRANDFATHER KNOWS       Grandfather says of all things       The silliest he's heard     Is that some children call things       They've never seen, \"absurd!\"     And have their doubts of true things,       And won't believe, because     They say, \"If you but knew things,       There _is_ no Santa Claus!\"      Grandfather says he _knows_ him,       And sees him every year,     And Santa often shows him       The playthings he brings here;     He says, too, Santa told him       If any girls and boys     Laugh at and won't uphold him,       They'll not get any toys!     SLEIGH-BELLS       Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle!       Happy winter-time!     Baby's eyes a-twinkle,       Hear the sleigh-bells chime!      Each one rings a merry       Ting-a-ling-a-ling!     For a sleigh-bell fairy       Hides inside to sing.      See them quake and quiver,       Up and downward tossed,     Seems as if they shiver       In the nipping frost!      Shiver into laughter,       Jolly little elves!     Till we laugh thereafter,       Merry as themselves!     THE RED-BIRD       Swept lightly by the south wind       The elm-leaves softly"]]]
