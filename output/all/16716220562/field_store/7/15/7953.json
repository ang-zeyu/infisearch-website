A great steam goes up._  KING: Neither have I ordered that his head be sent back to Eng-Bathai.  AMBASSADOR: Alas, for so rare a wine.  [_He pours it away._  KING: I have banished him and he is safe. I have neither obeyed nor disobeyed.  AMBASSADOR: The Emperor therefore bids you choose the gift that he honours himself by sending to your Court.  [_He signs. Enter a massive_ NUBIAN _with two cups._  The Emperor bids you drink one of these cups.  [_The huge_ NUBIAN _moves up close to the_ KING _holding up the two cups on a tray._  [_The_ POLITICIAN _slinks off. Exit L._  KING: The cups are strangely alike.  AMBASSADOR: Only one craftsman in the City of Smiths ever discerned a difference. The Emperor killed him, and now no one knows.  KING: The potions also are alike.  AMBASSADOR: Strangely alike. [_The_ KING _hesitates._] The Emperor bids you choose his gift and drink.  KING: The Emperor has poisoned the cups!  AMBASSADOR: You greatly wrong the Emperor. Only one cup is poisoned.  KING: You say that one is poisoned?  AMBASSADOR: Only one, O King! Who may say which?  KING: And what if I refuse to do this thing?  AMBASSADOR: There are tortures that the Emperor never names. They are not spoken of where the Emperor is. Yet the Emperor makes a sign and they are accomplished. He makes the sign with a certain one of his fingers.  KING (_half to himself_): How wonderfully they have the look of wine.  AMBASSADOR: One is a wine scarcely less rare, scarcely less jubilant in the wits of man, than that which alas is lost.  [_He glances towards the spot where he threw the other._  KING: And the other?  AMBASSADOR: Who may say? It is the most treasured secret that the Emperor's poisoners guard.  KING: I will send for my butlers that are wise in wine and they shall smell the cups.  AMBASSADOR: Alas, but the Emperor's poisoners have added so wine-like a flavour to their most secret draught, that no man may tell by this means which is their work and which that inestimable wine.  KING: I will send for my tasters and they shall taste of the cups.  AMBASSADOR: Alas, so great a risk may not be run.  KING: Risks are the duty of a king's tasters.  AMBASSADOR: If they chanced to taste of the treasure of the Emperor's poisoners--well. But if they, or _any_ man of common birth, were to taste of the wine that the Emperor sends only to kings, and even to kings but rarely, that were an affront to the Emperor's ancient wine that could not be permitted.  KING: It is surely permitted that I send for my priests, who tell by divination, having burnt strange herbs to the gods that guard the Golden Isles.  AMBASSADOR: It is permitted.  KING: Send for the priests.  KING (_mainly to himself_): They shall discern. The priests shall make for me this dreadful choice. They shall burn herbs and discern it. (_To_ AMBASSADOR.) My priests are very subtle. They worship the gods that guard the Golden Isles.  AMBASSADOR: The Emperor has other gods.  [_Enter L. two priests of the Order of the Sun. Two acolytes follow. One carries a tripod and the other a gong._  [_The priests abase themselves and the acolytes bow. The_ AMBASSADOR _stands with almost Mongolian calm by the door from which he has not moved since he entered._  [_The impassive_ NUBIAN _stands motionless near the_ KING, _holding up the cups on a tray._  KING: The Emperor has honoured me with these two cups of wine that I may drink one of them to the grandeur of his throne. I bid you importune the gods that they may surely tell me which it were well to drink.  FIRST PRIEST: We will importune the gods with the savour of rarest spices. We will send up to them the odour of herbs they love. We will commune with them in silence and they shall answer our thoughts, when they snuff the savour of the smoke of the burning on the tripod that is sacred to the Sun.  [_The calm of the_ AMBASSADOR _and the impassivity of the_ NUBIAN _grow ominous. The two priests hang over the tripod. They cast herbs upon it. They pass their hands over it. The herbs begin to smoulder. A smoke goes up. The priests bend over the smoke. Presently they step back from it._  FIRST PRIEST: The gods sleep.  KING: They sleep! The gods that guard the Golden Isles?  FIRST PRIEST: The gods sleep.  KING: Importune them as never before. I will make sacrifice of many sheep. I will give emeralds to the Monks of the Sun.  [_The second acolyte moves nearer to the tripod and beats listlessly on his great gong at about the pace of a great clock striking slowly._  FIRST PRIEST: We will importune the gods as never before.  [_They heap up more herbs and spices. The smoke grows thicker and thicker. It streams upwards. They hover about it as before. At a sign the gong ceases._  The gods have spoken.  KING: What is their message?  FIRST PRIEST: Drink of the cup upon the Nubian's left.  KING: Ah. My gods defend me.  [_He seizes the cup boldly. He looks straight at the_ AMBASSADOR, _whose face remains expressionless, merely watching. He lifts the cup upon the Nubian's left a little up from the tray._  [_He glances towards the priests._  [_Suddenly he starts. He has seen a strange expression upon the face of the priest. He puts the cup down. He strides a step nearer and looks at his face._  PRIEST!--Priest!---- What is that look in your eyes?  FIRST PRIEST: O King, I know not. I have given the message of the gods.  [_The_ KING _continues to search out his face._  KING: I mistrust it.  FIRST PRIEST: It is the message of the gods.  KING: I will drink of the other cup!  [_The_ KING _steps back to his place in the front of his throne where the Nubian stands beside him. He takes the cup upon the Nubian's right. He gazes at the priest. He looks round at the Ambassador, but sees nothing in that watchful, expressionless face._  [_He glances sidelong at the priest, then drinks, draining the cup at some length. He puts it down in silence. The face of the Ambassador and the whole bulk of the Nubian remain motionless._  KING: An inestimable wine!  AMBASSADOR: It is the Emperor's joy.  KING: Send for my Questioners.  [_There are weird whistles. Two dark men run on in loin clothes._  Ask these two priests the Seven Questions.  [_The_ QUESTIONERS _run nimbly up to the two priests and lead them away by the arm._  THE TWO ACOLYTES: O, O, O. Oh, oh.  [_They show extreme horror. The_ AMBASSADOR _bows to the King._  KING: You do not leave us at once?  AMBASSADOR: I go back to the Emperor, whom it is happiness to obey, and length of days.  [_He bows and walks away. The_ HERALD _marches out, then the_ AMBASSADOR; _the_ PAGE, _the_ DWARF _and the_ NUBIAN _follow._  [_Exeunt._  [_The_ HERALD _is heard blowing upon his trumpet the same notes as when he entered, one merry bar of music._  [_The tray and two precious cups, one empty and the other full, are left glittering near the_ KING.  KING (_looking at cups_): Those are rare emeralds that glisten there! Yet an evil gift. (_To the moaning acolytes._) Be silent! Your priests sinned strangely.  [_The acolytes continue to moan._  [_Enter one of the_ QUESTIONERS. _He has sweat on his face and his hair has become damp and unkempt._  QUESTIONER: We have asked the Seven Questions.  KING: Well?  QUESTIONER: They have not answered.  KING: Not answered!  QUESTIONER: Neither man has confessed.  KING: Oho! Do I keep Questioners that bring me no answers?  QUESTIONERS: We questioned them to the uttermost.  KING: And neither man confessed?  QUESTIONER: They would not confess.  KING: Ask them the Supreme Question.  [_The acolytes break out into renewed moaning._  QUESTIONER: It shall be asked, O King.  [_Exit_ QUESTIONER. _The acolytes moan on._  KING: They would have made me drink of a poisoned cup. I say there is poison in that cup. Your priests would have had me drink it. (_The acolytes only answer by moans._) Bid them confess. Bid them confess their crime and why it was done, and the Supreme Question shall be spared them. (_The acolytes only answer by moans._) Strange! They have done strangely. (_To acolytes._) Why has your priest spoken falsely? (_The acolytes only moan._) Why has he spoken falsely in the name of the gods? (_The acolytes moan on._) Be silent! Be silent! May I not question whom I will? (_To himself_). They prophesied falsely in the name of the gods.  [_Enter the_ QUESTIONERS.  FIRST QUESTIONER: The Supreme Question is asked.  [_The acolytes suddenly cease moaning._  KING: Well?  FIRST QUESTIONER: They would not answer.  KING: They would not answer the Supreme Question?  FIRST QUESTIONER: They spoke at last, but they would not answer the question. They would not confess.  KING: What said they at last?  FIRST QUESTIONER: O, the King's Majesty, they but spake idly.  KING: What said they?  FIRST QUESTIONER: O, the King's Majesty, they said nought fitting.  KING: They muttered so that no man heard them clearly?  FIRST QUESTIONER: They spake. But it was not fitting.  KING: Did they speak of small things happening long ago?  FIRST QUESTIONER: O, the King's Majesty, it was not fitting.  KING: What said they? Speak!  FIRST QUESTIONER: The man you gave to me, O King, said: \"No man that knew the counsels of the gods, who alone see future things, would say the gods advised King Hamaran ill when they bade him drink out of a poisoned cup.\" Then I put the question straightly and he died.  KING: The gods! He said it was the gods!... And the other?  SECOND QUESTIONER: He also said the same, O the King's Majesty.  KING: Both said the same. They were questioned in different chambers?  FIRST QUESTIONER: In different chambers, O King. I questioned mine in the Red Chamber.  KING (_to_ SECOND QUESTIONER): And yours?  SECOND QUESTIONER: In the Chamber of Rats.  KING: Begone!  [_Exeunt_ QUESTIONERS.  So ... It _was_ the gods.  [_The acolytes are crouched upon the floor. He does not notice them since they ceased to moan._  The gods! With what dark and dreadful "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19393"],["title","Plays of Near & Far (#2)"],["body","have they clouded the future?  Well, I will face it! But what is it? Is it one of those things a strong man can bear? Or is it----?  The future is more terrible than the grave, that has its one secret only.  No man, he said, could say that the gods had advised me ill when they bade me drink out of a poisoned cup.  What have the gods seen? What dreadful work have they overlooked where Destiny sits alone, making evil years? The gods, he said, who alone see future things.  Yes, I have known men who never were warned by the gods, and did not drink poison, and came upon evil days, suddenly like a ship upon rocks no mariner knows. Yes, poison to some of _them_ would have been very precious.  The gods have warned me and I have not hearkened, and must go on alone: must enter that strange country of the future whose paths are so dark to man ... to meet a doom there that the gods have seen.  The gods have seen it! How shall I thwart the gods? How fight against the shapers of the hills?  Would that I had been warned. Would I had heeded when they bade me drink of the cup the Ambassador said was poisoned.  [_Far off is heard that merry bar of music blown by the_ AMBASSADOR'S HERALD _on his horn._]  _Is it too late?_  There it stands yet with its green emeralds winking.  [_He clutches it and looks down into it._  How like to wine it is, which is full of dreams. It is silent and dreamy like the gods, whose dreams we are.  Only a moment in their deathless minds: then the dream passes.  [_He lifts up his arm and drinks it seated upon his throne with his head back and the great cup before his face. The audience begin to wonder when he will put it down. Still he remains in the attitude of a drinker. The acolytes begin to peer eagerly. Still he remains upright with the great cup to his lips. The acolytes patter away and the_ KING _is left alone._  [_Enter the_ KING'S POLITICIAN _hurriedly._ _He goes up to the_ KING _and seizes his right arm and tries to drag the cup away from his lips, but the_ KING _is rigid and his arm cannot be moved. He steps back lifting up his hands._  POLITICIAN: Oh-h!  [_Exit. You hear him announcing solemnly_  King Hamaran ... is dead!  [_A murmur is heard of men, at first mournful. It grows louder and louder and then breaks into these clear words._  Zarabardes is King! Zarabardes is King! Rejoice! Rejoice! Zarabardes is King! Zarabardes! Zarabardes! Zarabardes!  CURTAIN.     THE FLIGHT OF THE QUEEN   _DRAMATIS PERSONÆ_  THE PRINCE OF ZOON. PRINCE MELIFLOR. QUEEN ZOOMZOOMARMA. LADY OOZIZI. OOMUZ, _a Common Soldier._ THE GLORY OF XIMENUNG. THE OVERLORD OF MOOMOOMON. PRINCE HUZ.    SCENE I  _Time: June._  _Scene: In the Palace of Zoorm; the Hall of the Hundred Princes._  _The Princes sit at plain oaken tables with pewter mugs before them. They wear bright grass-green cloaks of silk; they might wear circlets of narrow silver with one large hyacinth petal rising from it at intervals of an inch._  OOMUZ, _a Common Soldier, huge and squat, with brown skin and dense black beard, stands just inside the doorway, holding a pike, guarding the golden treasure._  _The golden treasure lies in a heap three or four feet high near the right back corner._  SENTRIES, _also brown-skinned and bearded, carrying pikes, pass and repass outside the great doorway._  THE GLORY OF XIMENUNG: Heigho, Moomoomon.  THE OVERLORD OF MOOMOOMON: Heigho, Glory of Ximenung.  XIMENUNG: Weary?  MOOMOOMON: Aye, weary.  ANOTHER: Heigho.  PRINCE MELIFLOR (_sympathetically_): What wearies you?  MOOMOOMON: The idle hours and the idle days. Heigho.  OTHERS: Heigho.  MELIFLOR: Speak not against the idle hours, Moomoomon.  MOOMOOMON: Why then, lord of the sweet lands?  MELIFLOR: Because in idleness are all things, all things good.  XIMENUNG: Heigho, I am weary of the idle hours.  MOOMOOMON: You would work then?  XIMENUNG: No-o. That is not our destiny.  MELIFLOR: Let us be well contented with our lot. The idle hours are our sacred treasure.  XIMENUNG: Yes, I am well contented, and yet ...  MOOMOOMON (_contemplatively_): And yet ...  XIMENUNG: I sometimes dream that were it not for our glorious state, and this tradition of exalted ease, it might, it might be pleasant ...  MOOMOOMON: To toil, to labour, to raid the golden hoards.  XIMENUNG: Yes, Moomoomon.  MELIFLOR: Never! Never!  OTHERS: No. No. No.  ANOTHER: And yet ...  MELIFLOR: No, never. We should lose our glorious ease, the heritage that none may question.  XIMENUNG: What heritage is that, Prince Meliflor?  MELIFLOR: It is all the earth. To labour is to lose it.  MOOMOOMON: If we could toil we should gain some spot of earth that our labour would seem to make our own. How happily the workers come home at evening.  MELIFLOR: It would be to lose all.  PRINCE OF ZOON: How lose it, Meliflor?  MELIFLOR: To us alone the idle hours are given. The sky, the fields, the woods, the summer winds are for us alone. All others put the earth to uses. This or that field has this or that use; here one may go and another may not. They have each their bit of earth and become slaves to its purpose. But for us, ah! for us, is all; the gift of the idle hours.  SOME: Hurrah! Hurrah for the idle hours.  ZOON: Heigho. The idle hours weary me.  MELIFLOR: They give us all the earth and sky to contemplate. Both are for us.  MOOMOOMON: True. Let us drink, and speak of the blue sky.  MELIFLOR (_lifting mug_): And all our glorious heritage.  XIMENUNG (_putting hand to mug_): Aye, it is glorious, and yet ...  [_Enter the_ RAIDERS _of the Golden Hoard with spears and, in the other hand, leather wallets the size of your fist; these they cast on the heap. Nuggets the size of big filberts escape from some so that the heap is partly leather and partly gold. These wallets should be filled with nuggets of lead, about the size described, not one lump of lead and not sawdust or rags. Nothing destroys illusion on the stage more than a cannon ball falling with a soft pat. They look scowlingly at the Princes._  [_Exeunt the_ RAIDERS. _The Princes have scarcely noticed them._  MELIFLOR: See how they waste the hours.  XIMENUNG: They have brought treasure from the Golden Hoard.  ZOON: Yes, from the Golden Hoard beyond the marshes. I went there once with old brown Oomuz there.  MELIFLOR: Of what avail is it to come back burdened thus? Has not the Queen more wealth than she'll ever need?  MOOMOOMON: Aye, the Queen needs nothing more.  ZOON: How can we know that?  MOMOOMON: Why not?  ZOON: The Queen obeys old impulses. Her sires are dead. Who knows whence those impulses come? How can we say what they are?  MOOMOOMON: She cannot need more wealth than what is here.  MELIFLOR: No, no, she cannot.  ZOON: She needs more, for she has bidden them go again to the Golden Hoards. Her impulses have demanded it.  MOOMOOMON: Then there is no reason in her impulses.  ZOON: They do not come from reason.  MOOMOOMON: So I said.  ZOON: They come from Fate.  MOOMOOMON: From Fate!  [_There is a hush at this._ OOMUZ _comes nearer and kneels down._  OOMUZ: Oh, Masters, Masters. If there be anything greater, greater than the Queen, speak not of it, Masters, speak not its name.  ZOON: No, Oomuz. We need nothing greater.  OOMUZ: The name frightened me, Mighty Highness.  ZOON: Yes, yes, Oomuz; there is only the Queen.  MOOMOOMON: No, there is nothing greater than the Queen, and she has no need of anything more than the treasure that he guards there.  OOMUZ: There is one thing more.  MOOMOOMON: More? What is that?  OOMUZ: There is one thing more. The Queen needs one thing more. This has been told us and we know.  MOOMOOMON: What is it?  OOMUZ: How should we know that? None knows the need of the Queen.  [OOMUZ _returns to guard his heap._  ZOON: What think you, Oomuz? What think you is this need of the Queen?  [OOMUZ _shakes his head about three times._ PRINCE OF ZOON _sighs._  SEVERAL PRINCES (_together wearily_): Heigho.  MELIFOR: Take comfort in our heritage, illustrious comrades. Come! We will drink to the sun.  SOME: To the sun! To the sun! (_They drink._)  MELIFLOR: To the golden idle hours! (_He drinks._) Let us be worthy, glorious companions, of our exalted calling. Let us enjoy the days of idleness. Sing to us, mighty one of Zoon, as the idle hours go by. Sing us a song.  MOOMOOMON (_idly_): Yes, sing to us.  ZOON: As you all know, I can but hum. But I will hum you a song that I heard yesterday; very strange it was; sung in the meadows by two that were not of our people; sung in the evening. I heard it as I loitered home from the meadows beyond the marshes. There is no ease in the song, and yet ...  MOOMOOMON: Hum it to us.  ZOON: They sang it together, the two that were not of our people.  [_He hums a song. They all lift up their heads from their listlessness._  MELIFLOR (_wonderingly_): That is a song that is new.  ZOON: Yes, it is new to me.  MELIFLOR: It is like an old song.  ZOON: Yes, perhaps it is old.  MELIFLOR: What is the song?  ZOON: It tells of love.  THE PRINCES: Ah-h!  [_They seem to wake as though young and strong out of sleep. There is a great commotion among them. The sentries outside are utterly unmoved._ OOMUZ, _without sharing any of the excitement of the Princes, now nods his head solemnly as he had once shaken it._  MOOMOOMON: Love! It must have been that that I felt that day in the twilight as I came back round the peak of Zing-gee Mountain.  XIMENUNG: You felt it, Moomoomon? Tell us.  MOOMOOMON: All the air seemed gold, seemed gold of a sudden. Through it I saw fair fields, glittering green far down, glimpsed between clumps of the heather. The gold was all about them, yet they shone with their own fair colours. Ah, how can I tell you all I saw? My feet seemed scarce to touch the slope of the mountain; I too seemed one with the golden air in which all things were shining.  XIMENUNG: And this was Love?  MOOMOOMON: I know not. It was some strange new thing. It was strange and new like this song.  MELIFLOR: Perhaps, it was some other"]]]
