[Exit.]     SCENE II.--At CHARLES's House       Enter TRIP, MOSES, and SIR OLIVER  TRIP. Here Master Moses--if you'll stay a moment--I'll try whether Mr.----what's the Gentleman's Name?  SIR OLIVER. Mr.----Moses--what IS my name----  MOSES. Mr. Premium----  TRIP. Premium--very well.       [Exit TRIP--taking snuff.]  SIR OLIVER. To judge by the Servants--one wouldn't believe the master was ruin'd--but what--sure this was my Brother's House----  MOSES. Yes Sir Mr. Charles bought it of Mr. Joseph with the Furniture, Pictures, &c.--just as the old Gentleman left it--Sir Peter thought it a great piece of extravagance in him.  SIR OLIVER. In my mind the other's economy in selling it to him was more reprehensible by half.----       Enter TRIP  TRIP. My Master[,] Gentlemen[,] says you must wait, he has company, and can't speak with you yet.  SIR OLIVER. If he knew who it was wanted to see him, perhaps he wouldn't have sent such a Message.  TRIP. Yes--yes--Sir--He knows you are here--I didn't forget little Premium--no--no----  SIR OLIVER. Very well--and pray Sir what may be your Name?  TRIP. Trip Sir--my Name is Trip, at your Service.  SIR OLIVER. Well then Mr. Trip--I presume your master is seldom without company----  TRIP. Very seldom Sir--the world says ill-natured things of him but 'tis all malice--no man was ever better beloved--Sir he seldom sits down to dinner without a dozen particular Friends----  SIR OLIVER. He's very happy indeed--you have a pleasant sort of Place here I guess?  TRIP. Why yes--here are three or four of us pass our time agreeably enough--but then our wages are sometimes a little in arrear--and not very great either--but fifty Pounds a year and find our own Bags and Bouquets----  SIR OLIVER. Bags and Bouquets!--Halters and Bastinadoes! [Aside.]  TRIP. But a propos Moses--have you been able to get me that little Bill discounted?  SIR OLIVER. Wants to raise money too!--mercy on me! has his distresses, I warrant[,] like a Lord--and affects Creditors and Duns! [Aside.]  MOSES. 'Twas not be done, indeed----  TRIP. Good lack--you surprise me--My Friend Brush has indorsed it and I thought when he put his name at the Back of a Bill 'twas as good as cash.  MOSES. No 'twouldn't do.  TRIP. A small sum--but twenty Pound--harkee, Moses do you think you could get it me by way of annuity?  SIR OLIVER. An annuity! ha! ha! a Footman raise money by annuity--Well done Luxury egad! [Aside.]  MOSES. Who would you get to join with you?  TRIP. You know my Lord Applice--you have seen him however----  MOSES. Yes----  TRIP. You must have observed what an appearance he makes--nobody dresses better, nobody throws off faster--very well this Gentleman will stand my security.  MOSES. Well--but you must insure your Place.  TRIP. O with all my Heart--I'll insure my Place, and my Life too, if you please.  SIR OLIVER. It's more than I would your neck----  MOSES. But is there nothing you could deposit?  TRIP. Why nothing capital of my master's wardrobe has drop'd lately--but I could give you a mortgage on some of his winter Cloaths with equity of redemption before November or--you shall have the reversion--of the French velvet, or a post obit on the Blue and Silver--these I should think Moses--with a few Pair of Point Ruffles as a collateral security--hey, my little Fellow?  MOSES. Well well--we'll talk presently--we detain the Gentlemen----  SIR OLIVER. O pray don't let me interrupt Mr. Trip's Negotiation.  TRIP. Harkee--I heard the Bell--I believe, Gentlemen I can now introduce you--don't forget the annuity little Moses.  SIR OLIVER. If the man be a shadow of his Master this is the Temple of Dissipation indeed!       [Exeunt.]     SCENE III.--CHARLES, CARELESS, etc., etc.       At Table with Wine  CHARLES. 'Fore Heaven, 'tis true!--there is the great Degeneracy of the age--many of our acquaintance have Taste--Spirit, and Politeness--but plague on't they won't drink----  CARELESS. It is so indeed--Charles--they give into all the substantial Luxuries of the Table--and abstain from nothing but wine and wit--Oh, certainly society suffers by it intolerably--for now instead of the social spirit of Raillery that used to mantle over a glass of bright Burgundy their conversation is become just like the Spa water they drink which has all the Pertness and flatulence of champaine without its spirit or Flavour.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. But what are they to do who love Play better than wine----  CARELESS. True--there's Harry diets himself--for gaming and is now under a hazard Regimen.  CHARLES. Then He'll have the worst of it--what you wouldn't train a horse for the course by keeping him from corn--For my Part egad I am never so successful as when I'm a little--merry--let me throw on a Bottle of Champaine and I never lose--at least I never feel my losses which is exactly the same thing.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Aye that may be--but it is as impossible to follow wine and play as to unite Love and Politics.  CHARLES. Pshaw--you may do both--Caesar made Love and Laws in a Breath--and was liked by the Senate as well as the Ladies--but no man can pretend to be a Believer in Love, who is an abjurer of wine--'tis the Test by which a Lover knows his own Heart--fill a dozen Bumpers to a dozen Beauties, and she that floats atop is the maid that has bewitched you.  CARELESS. Now then Charles--be honest and give us yours----  CHARLES. Why I have withheld her only in compassion to you--if I toast her you should give a round of her Peers, which is impossible! on earth!  CARELESS. O, then we'll find some canonized Vestals or heathen Goddesses that will do I warrant----  CHARLES. Here then--Bumpers--you Rogues--Bumpers! Maria--Maria----  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Maria who?  CHARLES. Oh, damn the Surname 'tis too formal to be register'd in Love's calendar--but now Careless beware--beware--we must have Beauty's superlative.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Nay Never study[,] Careless--we'll stand to the Toast--tho' your mistress should want an eye--and you know you have a song will excuse you----  CARELESS. Egad so I have--and I'll give him the song instead of the Lady.----       SONG.--AND CHORUS--<4>       Here's to the maiden of bashful fifteen;         Here's to the widow of fifty;      Here's to the flaunting extravagant quean,         And here's to the housewife that's thrifty.      Chorus.  Let the toast pass,--                   Drink to the lass,      I'll warrant she'll prove an excuse for a glass.       Here's to the charmer whose dimples we prize;         Now to the maid who has none, sir;      Here's to the girl with a pair of blue eyes,         And here's to the nymph with but one, sir.      Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &c.       Here's to the maid with a bosom of snow:         Now to her that's as brown as a berry:      Here's to the wife with a face full of woe,         And now to the damsel that's merry.      Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &c.       For let 'em be clumsy, or let 'em be slim,         Young or ancient, I care not a feather;      So fill a pint bumper quite up to the brim,      So fill up your glasses, nay, fill to the brim,         And let us e'en toast them together.      Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &c.       [Enter TRIP whispers CHARLES]  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Bravo Careless--Ther's Toast and Sentiment too.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. E' faith there's infinite charity in that song.----  CHARLES. Gentlemen, you must excuse me a little.--Careless, take the Chair, will you?  CARELESS. Nay prithee, Charles--what now--this is one of your Peerless Beauties I suppose--has dropped in by chance?  CHARLES. No--Faith--to tell you the Truth 'tis a Jew and a Broker who are come by appointment.  CARELESS. O dam it let's have the Jew in.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Aye and the Broker too by all means----  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Yes yes the Jew and the Broker.  CHARLES. Egad with all my Heart--Trip--bid the Gentlemen walk in--tho' there's one of them a Stranger I can tell you----  TRIP. What Sir--would you chuse Mr. Premium to come up with----  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes--yes Mr. Premium certainly.  CARELESS. To be sure--Mr. Premium--by all means Charles, let us give them some generous Burgundy, and perhaps they'll grow conscientious----  CHARLES. O, Hang 'em--no--wine does but draw forth a man's natural qualities; and to make them drink would only be to whet their Knavery.       Enter TRIP, SIR OLIVER, and MOSES  CHARLES. So--honest Moses--walk in--walk in pray Mr. Premium--that's the Gentleman's name isn't it Moses.  MOSES. Yes Sir.  CHARLES. Set chairs--Trim.--Sit down, Mr Premium.--Glasses Trim.--sit down Moses.--Come, Mr. Premium I'll give you a sentiment--Here's Success to Usury--Moses fill the Gentleman a bumper.  MOSES. Success to Usury!  CARELESS. Right Moses--Usury is Prudence and industry and deserves to succeed----  SIR OLIVER. Then Here is--all the success it deserves!     [Drinks.]  CHARLES. Mr. Premium you and I are but strangers yet--but I hope we shall be better acquainted by and bye----  SIR OLIVER. Yes Sir hope we shall--more intimately perhaps than you'll wish. [Aside.<5>]  CARELESS. No, no, that won't do! Mr. Premium, you have demurred at the toast, and must drink it in a pint bumper.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. A pint bumper, at least.  MOSES. Oh, pray, sir, consider--Mr. Premium's a gentleman.  CARELESS. And therefore loves good wine.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Give Moses a quart glass--this is mutiny, and a high contempt for the chair.  CARELESS. Here, now for't! I'll see justice done, to the last drop of my bottle.  SIR OLIVER. Nay, pray, gentlemen--I did not expect this usage.  CHARLES. No, hang it, you shan't; Mr. Premium's a stranger.  SIR OLIVER. Odd! I wish I was well out of their company. [Aside.]  CARELESS. Plague on 'em then! if they won't drink, we'll not sit down with them. Come, Harry, the dice are in the next room.--Charles, you'll join us when you have finished your business with the gentlemen?  CHARLES. I will! I will!--       [Exeunt SIR HARRY BUMPER and GENTLEMEN;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19292"],["title","`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablet to Dr. Forel (#0)"],["body","to August Forel   by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá     Edition 1, (September 2006)                                 BAHA’I TERMS OF USE   You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing, emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading, transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the following:  1.

FOREL(1)     [Pages 6–10]   O revered personage, lover of truth! Thy letter dated 28 July 1921(2) hath been received. The contents thereof were most pleasing and indicated that, praised be the Lord, thou art as yet young, and searchest after truth, that thy power of thought is strong and the discoveries of thy mind manifest.  Numerous copies of the epistle I had written to Dr. F. are spread far and wide and every one knoweth that it hath been revealed in the year 1910. Apart from this, numerous epistles have been written before the war upon the same theme, and reference, too, hath been made to these questions in the Journal of the San Francisco University, the date whereof is known beyond any doubt.(3) In like manner have the philosophers of broad vision praised highly the discourse eloquently delivered in the above-named University.(4) A copy of that paper is thus enclosed and forwarded. Thy works are no doubt of great benefit, and if published, send us a copy of each.  By materialists, whose belief with regard to Divinity hath been explained, is not meant philosophers in general, but rather that group of materialists of narrow vision who worship that which is sensed, who depend upon the five senses only, and whose criterion of knowledge is limited to that which can be perceived by the senses. All that can be sensed is to them real, whilst whatever falleth not under the power of the senses is either unreal or doubtful. The existence of the Deity they regard as wholly doubtful.  It is as thou hast written, not philosophers in general but narrow-minded materialists that are meant. As to deistic philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, they are indeed worthy of esteem and of the highest praise, for they have rendered distinguished services to mankind. In like manner we regard the materialistic, accomplished, moderate philosophers, who have been of service (to mankind).  We regard knowledge and wisdom as the foundation of the progress of mankind, and extol philosophers who are endowed with broad vision. Peruse carefully the San Francisco University Journal that the truth may be revealed to thee.  Now concerning mental faculties, they are in truth of the inherent properties of the soul, even as the radiation of light is the essential property of the sun. The rays of the sun are renewed but the sun itself is ever the same and unchanged. Consider how the human intellect develops and weakens, and may at times come to naught, whereas the soul changeth not. For the mind to manifest itself, the human body must be whole; and a sound mind cannot be but in a sound body, whereas the soul dependeth not upon the body. It is through the power of the soul that the mind comprehendeth, imagineth and exerteth its influence, whilst the soul is a power that is free. The mind comprehendeth the abstract by the aid of the concrete, but the soul hath limitless manifestations of its own. The mind is circumscribed, the soul limitless. It is by the aid of such senses as those of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, that the mind comprehendeth, whereas the soul is free from all agencies. The soul as thou observest, whether it be in sleep or waking, is in motion and ever active. Possibly it may, whilst in a dream, unravel an intricate problem, incapable of solution in the waking state. The mind, moreover, understandeth not whilst the senses have ceased to function, and in the embryonic stage and in early infancy the reasoning power is totally absent, whereas the soul is ever endowed with full strength. In short, the proofs are many that go to show that despite the loss of reason, the power of the soul would still continue to exist. The spirit however possesseth various grades and stations.  As to the existence of spirit in the mineral: it is indubitable that minerals are endowed with a spirit and life according to the requirements of that stage. This unknown secret, too, hath become known unto the materialists who now maintain that all beings are endowed with life, even as He saith in the Qur’án, ‘All things are living’.  In the vegetable world, too, there is the power of growth, and that power of growth is the spirit. In the animal world there is the sense of feeling, but in the human world there is an all-embracing power. In all the preceding stages the power of reason is absent, but the soul existeth and revealeth itself. The sense of feeling understandeth not the soul, whereas the reasoning power of the mind proveth the existence thereof.  In like manner the mind proveth the existence of an unseen Reality that embraceth all beings, and that existeth and revealeth itself in all stages, the essence whereof is beyond the grasp of the mind. Thus the mineral world understandeth neither the nature nor the perfections of the vegetable world; the vegetable world understandeth not the nature of the animal world, neither the animal world the nature of the reality of man that discovereth and embraceth all things.  The animal is the captive of nature and cannot transgress the rules and laws thereof. In man, however, there is a discovering power that transcendeth the world of nature and controlleth and interfereth with the laws thereof. For instance, all minerals, plants and animals are captives of nature. The sun itself with all its majesty is so subservient to nature that it hath no will of its own and cannot deviate a hair’s-breadth from the laws thereof. In like manner all other beings, whether of the mineral, the vegetable or the animal world, cannot deviate from the laws of nature, nay, all are the slaves thereof. Man, however, though in body the captive of nature is yet free in his mind and soul, and hath the mastery over nature.  Consider: according to the law of nature man liveth, moveth and hath his being on earth, yet his soul and mind interfere with the laws thereof, and     [Pages 11–20]   even as the bird he flieth in the air, saileth speedily upon the seas and as the fish soundeth the deep and discovereth the things therein. Verily this is a grievous defeat inflicted upon the laws of nature.  So is the power of electrical energy: this unruly violent force that cleaveth mountains is yet imprisoned by man within a globe! This is manifestly interfering with the laws of nature. Likewise man discovereth those hidden secrets of nature that in conformity with the laws thereof must remain concealed, and transfereth them from the invisible plane to the visible. This, too, is interfering with the law of nature. In the same manner he discovereth the inherent properties of things that are the secrets of nature. Also he bringeth to light the past events that have been lost to memory, and foreseeth by his power of induction future happenings that are as yet unknown. Furthermore, communication and discovery are limited by the laws of nature to short distances, whereas man, through that inner power of his that discovereth the reality of all things, connecteth the East with the West. This, too, is interfering with the laws of nature. Similarly, according to the law of nature all shadows are fleeting, whereas man fixeth them upon the plate, and this, too, is interference with a law of nature. Ponder and reflect: all sciences, arts, crafts, inventions and discoveries, have been once the secrets of nature and in conformity with the laws thereof must remain hidden; yet man through his discovering power interfereth with the laws of nature and transfereth these hidden secrets from the invisible to the visible plane. This again is interfering with the laws of nature.  In fine, that inner faculty in man, unseen of the eye, wresteth the sword from the hands of nature, and giveth it a grievous blow. All other beings, however great, are bereft of such perfections. Man hath the powers of will and understanding, but nature hath them not. Nature is constrained, man is free. Nature is bereft of understanding, man understandeth. Nature is unaware of past events, but man is aware of them. Nature forecasteth not the future; man by his discerning power seeth that which is to come. Nature hath no consciousness of itself, man knoweth about all things.  Should any one suppose that man is but a part of the world of nature, and he being endowed with these perfections, these being but manifestations of the world of nature, and thus nature is the originator of these perfections and is not deprived therefrom, to him we make reply and say: the part dependeth upon the whole; the part cannot possess perfections whereof the whole is deprived.  By nature is meant those inherent properties and necessary relations derived from the realities of things. And these realities of things, though"]]]
