Our Guardian hopes that henceforth the secretaries of all local and national Assemblies will immediately upon their election inform the American National Assembly of their membership and the address, that the results may without delay be published in the Baha’i Year Book.  Our Guardian will not cease to pray for you all that the Beloved may guide you to achieve that which will conduce to the consolidation and extension of the influence of the Cause.  [From the Guardian:]  I trust the newly-elected Assembly will endeavour to follow the example of the American National Assembly in method, action, and procedure. The American Newsletter will indicate clearly the lines along which Baha’i National Assemblies are to conduct their work in future and I earnestly urge you to encourage the friends to follow and adopt the method outlined in its columns.  August 19, 1927     Extend the Scope of Activities   For a country like India and also Burma where the Baha’i communities are so much scattered and are of varied extraction a common centre to coordinate the different efforts and to link up together both the Assemblies within India and in the various parts of the world, is also ... necessary, and our Guardian hopes and trusts to see in time great results from this new measure. Of course much depends upon how well this organ functions.  Shoghi Effendi is in good health having taken a good rest during the summer. He awaits as much as ever the good news of the friends in India and above all news of real accomplishment.  [From the Guardian:]  I hope that nothing has transpired of late that might have in any manner affected the expansion of the work in those regions. I fully realize your single-handedness in such a vast and varied field, but I assure you, dearest friend, that your reward is proportionately great, for He that watches over you is aware of the great devotion which animates you in the pursuit of your arduous and noble task.  November 1, 1927     [Letter of November 16, 1927]   Your frequent communications keeping him in close touch with your activities and the work in India, are deeply appreciated, and he relies much upon your efforts to coordinate the work in India and to have more direct and material results than we have been accustomed to lately. When compared to some other countries and remembering the many years since the Cause was first known there, India, I am afraid, does not come up to expectations. Are we going to accept this secondary position or has the future a surprise in store? At any rate we patiently wait.  November 16, 1927     [Letter of May 6, 1928]   He was greatly pleased with the news of the work of Prof. Pritam Singh in Karachi and Lahore and he read his well-worded lectures with interest. It gives him immense pleasure to keep in touch with his activities and he prays for the success of his efforts from the bottom of his heart. He is confident that when his plans are carried out and he does travel throughout the whole of India in the interests of the Cause, he will show a record of constant progress and would have rendered valuable services to the Baha’i Faith. Please assure him of our Guardian’s unfailing prayers and good wishes and also kindly convey to the Amritsar Baha’is the loving greetings of Shoghi Effendi...  I am sure it will interest you to know that we have had during the Ridwan festivals the first Baha’i pilgrim from Tunis. The representative of the Tunis Assembly is a young man full of hopes and schemes for the future.  [From the Guardian:]  I will specially supplicate, on behalf of my dear brethren in India & Burma, at the Beloved’s Shrine, that they may arise with heart and soul and in perfect harmony and understanding to extend the scope of their activities, to consolidate the foundations of their work, to deepen their knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the Faith, and to carry out the Beloved’s explicit instructions for the establishment of Baha’u’llah’s undisputed sovereignty on this earth. May they be richly blessed and guided in their endeavours.  May 6, 1928     [Letter of June 22, 1928]   Among the subjects that the Guardian would expect your body to take are a coordination of the various efforts and endeavours throughout India and Burma, an acceleration and increase in the number of Baha’is and fellow-workers, ways and means to attract the attention of Indians from every class and creed to the message and vital dynamic spirit of the Baha’i Faith and as a cumulative and culminating step the final recognition of the Baha’i Community as a separate religious organization similar to what has been already achieved in America.  June 22, 1928     [Letter of August 21, 1928]   The news that we obtain from the various parts of the world are most gratifying, for though there are some great problems to solve, yet no one can fail to see the constant realization of those ideals we cherish. May that day soon dawn when the source of this spiritual power, which is permeating the whole of society, will be appreciated and venerated.  August 21, 1928     Present the Teachings at Various Conventions & Gatherings   This is to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ... reporting the events of the Brahmo Samaj Centenary gathering to Shoghi Effendi. Such meetings are wonderful occasions for showing the spirit and teachings of the Cause.... Shoghi Effendi’s hope is that at such Conventions and gatherings the friends would present the teachings to persons otherwise inaccessible for individual contact.  [From the Guardian:]  I heartily approve the project of a Baha’i Convention and would leave the choice of the site and other arrangements to the National Assembly. The Cause in various countries is making a great headway and the reference of the case of the Baghdad House to the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations is a great step forward.  October 10, 1928     The Faith Publicized in Turkey   He was glad to hear from you and he has read with deep satisfaction the account of the good work of Syed Ilmi in Burma. Shoghi Effendi has always wondered as to the reasons why despite so many years of effort and activity, the Cause has not spread more rapidly either in India or Burma, perhaps the latter can be more proud of its results. He would in fact appreciate your own personal opinion, although God’s ways are often hard to understand. We have lately had a remarkable illustration in Turkey where the Baha’is were an insignificant little group. Suddenly accused of constituting a secret political society the members of the N.S.A. in Constantinople and the S.A. in Smyrna were dragged to the police and kept for one night pending the formation of the Board of Inquiry. The next day the court sat and the president of the N.S.A. was cross-examined for eight consecutive hours. The result was that they were all dismissed, with the members of the Court deeply influenced and impressed by the teachings and principles which the President boldly and eloquently described. They asked for literature and many of them carried from that session much food for thought. Furthermore every paper in Turkey filled its front pages with the incident and a repetition of the teachings and good many a Turk heard of the Cause in a way that Baha’is could never bring about.  [From the Guardian:]  I trust and pray that circumstances will be favourable and the means provided for the holding of a Baha’i convention this year representative of India and Burma. A closer touch and more frequent interchange of thought among the Baha’i Centres in those lands are absolutely essential. I am sending you a copy of the recently issued “Baha’i World”, and wish you to urge the National and Local Assemblies in India & Burma to order as many copies as they possibly can from America for distribution among the enlightened public as well as a means for the assistance and encouragement of the Baha’i Publishing Committee in New York which is doing excellent service at the present time.  November 15, 1928 Assemblies Must Endeavour to Inspire Confidence  Although I had never meant that my enquiry from you as to the reasons of lack of progress of the Cause in India, should be asked from every individual Baha’i, yet I am sure, our Guardian will be interested to know the ideas and opinions of various sections of the friends both in India and Burma.  The expression of our views in written form sometimes helps us to think better and deeper and often brings various matters into proper perspective, enabling us thereby to disregard what is extraneous and unimportant. The answers to the question put forth, would, I feel, be extremely valuable to the N.S.A. in India, and with the proper backing, respect and support of the entire friends, they should not lose a minute in an endeavour to remedy and inspire what ought not and what should be done, in an effort to spread the Cause.  [From the Guardian:]  I trust that the forthcoming Convention will remedy most if not all the present deficiencies in the Cause and lend an unprecedented impetus to the progress of the Faith. The Teaching work should be stressed as it is the Fountain-head from which all future blessings will flow. We must first and foremost add to our small numbers, and introduce fresh blood into the organic life of the community. I will specially supplicate this bounty for the representative delegates to be assembled at Convention this year.  December 19, 1928     Maintain and Strengthen the Unity of the National Assembly   He was very glad to hear of the success of the Convention. He hopes that such gatherings will become yearly and, like in other countries, lead to a better understanding among the friends. It is surely true that as the Cause progresses differences will more and more arise. So unless there be a meeting place where the different views are thrashed, true unity of purpose and activity will not be obtained.  Just as much as the result of the Convention"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],["title","Dawn of a New Day (#6)"],["body"," him happy he was sorry to hear of the differences that exist between the N.S.A. members. The real source of the difficulty is, I believe, the lack of constant intercourse between the different members. As the country is so very vast meetings cannot be very frequent and well attended, and this ultimately leads to misunderstandings and lack of faith in each other. Shoghi Effendi knows the different individuals involved, he knows their integrity and faith in the Cause and its spirit. He is sure that they, each and all, have no other purpose but to serve the progress of the movement and uphold its interests. And they will surely not commit an act that would retard the very Cause they are serving. What the solution is, I do not know. What Shoghi Effendi has been hoping during the last two or three years is a spirit of mutual trust that would overcome physical handicaps. But that seems to be impossible. A lurking dissatisfaction is sure to appear at the end.  [From the Guardian:]  Your subsequent letter dated Jan. 24 has also reached me. I will specially remember our dear and valued co-worker Prof. Pritam Singh when I visit the sacred Shrine that the spirit of Baha’u’llah may inspire, guide and sustain him in his great task. Regarding your last convention and the non-participation of the Burma delegates, I feel that the utmost effort must be exerted during the coming elections in April to elect those who are best fitted for this supreme and responsible position, and once elected, resignation is not to be accepted. The members must meet and consult in person. Persia is preparing for the holding of national elections, and for India and Burma to revert to a system that is being abandoned by the Persian believers would be a decidedly retrograde step. We must at all costs maintain and strengthen the unity of the National Assembly. Everything must be subordinated to this end. I will supplicate our Beloved to enable you to achieve His purpose.  February 12, 1929  It is his sincere hope and desire to see the newly-elected National Assembly during its term of office, infuse a new and fresh spirit into every Baha’i activity both in India and Burma, and while establishing perfect unity and harmony within its own ranks and the entire body of the believers, should take vigorous steps to teach the Cause and to establish a progressive and representative Baha’i community in both countries.  June 20, 1929  With regard to your proposal that the N.S.A. should meet once in Burma and once in India, the Guardian wishes me to record his hearty approval and to even suggest that if it should be feasible they should meet even more often than that in both places.  It is his sincere hope that in this manner and through the individual effort of every member the misunderstandings existing between India and Burma will be wiped out altogether and that a fresh start will be made in a spirit of true and whole-hearted accord.  July 8, 1929  He hopes that the new National Assembly will do its utmost to bring about unity in its group and among the friends. For, as he has often stated, the work of the Cause will remain cramped unless that unity is obtained. The petty differences that do exist are the result of misunderstandings and these can surely be eliminated.  August 20, 1929     “Baha’i World”—Foremost Baha’i Publication   I write on behalf of the Guardian to remind you that the next issue of the ‘Baha’i World’ will soon appear and its editors are already busy compiling material.  He has been asked by the editors in America to request you please to make a special effort to contribute as much material as you possibly can in the form of photographs, reports, accounts, and individual articles; and to send them as soon as possible to America in order that a work which the Guardian considers our foremost Baha’i publication in the world, may be as representative of the many countries and especially Eastern peoples as we would all wish it to be.  December 15, 1929     “Huquq”   ...As regards “Huquq”, it is really 19 per cent of one’s income payable to the Guardian. But it is not obligatory now.  December 19, 1929     Syed Jenab Ali—Distinguished Baha’i Leader   He was very sorry to learn of the illness of Syed Jenab Ali and since the receipt of your letter, he has been extremely grieved to learn of his passing. His sudden departure throws a shadow of gloom upon all of us here and in India and while Burma loses a distinguished and truly earnest Baha’i leader, it must be especially unfortunate to you that just at a time when you were considering and preparing the ground for Government Recognition and a temporary consideration of Baha’i laws, you were deprived of his valued cooperation. The Cause in India is as yet in such a tender age that we can ill afford the loss of those few that keep the torch aflame.  [From the Guardian:]  The news of the passing of our dear and able friend and collaborator Syed Jenab Ali has brought profound sorrow to our hearts. He leaves a great gap behind him. I hope that the friends far from feeling disheartened and discouraged at such a great loss will arise and redouble their efforts in order to compensate for the loss which they have sustained. Kindly assure his relatives of my deep grief, and my prayers for his departed soul.  January 6, 1930     Martha Root Visits India   ...Miss Root is at present in Tehran and she does not know just how long she will stay, but surely before leaving for India she would inform you of her plans in time.  It is such a pity that Mr. Vakil is unwell. He is a man we cannot spare just as the passing of Syed Jenab Ali leaves a serious gap in Burma.  [From the Guardian:]  Miss Root will soon be with you, and I trust her visit may lend a fresh impetus to your work of consolidation and spread of the Cause. I will continue to pray for your efforts and activities from the depths of my heart. Be not disheartened. Persevere in your labours and rest assured that the Beloved will richly reward those who stand firm in the Faith, and those who persevere in their endeavours.  March 1, 1930  Miss Root has been delayed by the enthusiastic reception she has received in Persia and she is now planning to visit southern and eastern Persia where she has not yet been. We hope her visit to India will prove of some value in attracting the attention of the intelligent classes among the non-Baha’is, but perhaps the political agitation will entirely defeat that purpose at the present time.  April 26, 1930  He was very glad to hear of the activities of Miss Martha Root in India and hopes that they will all bear some wonderful fruits for the progress of the Cause in India. It is sure that with the existence of the present political unrest in that country few are ready to pay any attention to religious matters, but among the very intelligent people there are undoubtedly people whose vision extends further than the present difficulties and desire a spiritual rebirth for that much divided and troubled nation. To these the Baha’i teachings should undoubtedly present a much desired reform movement. Anyhow Shoghi Effendi hopes that with the help of Miss Root you have been able to approach such eminent persons and have sown in their heart the seed of faith.  July 4, 1930  Concerning the trip of Miss Martha Root, we have already heard about her activities from many sources. Shoghi Effendi sincerely hopes that the National Assembly will undertake such measures as would keep up the work and produce some tangible result from her visit. It is very important to follow up the work that she started and keep in touch with the people she has been able to interest.  [From the Guardian:]  With the assurance of my deep appreciation of your many and highly successful endeavours in connection with the visit of Miss Root and of my fervent and loving prayers for your own happiness and spiritual advancement.  September 19, 1930     Baha’i Representation at the All-Asian Women’s Conference   Concerning Baha’i representation at the All-Asian Women’s Conference; this is undoubtedly a most commendable thing to do especially as the Cause has so much concerning the position of women in society. Shoghi Effendi hopes that the National Assembly will do its best to win the admiration of all the assembled delegates for the teachings of the Cause along that line. We should always take such opportunities that present themselves. May be we would succeed to render some service to society and alleviate its ills.  November 10, 1930  Shoghi Effendi hopes that with the combined efforts of the friends and the Master’s infinite mercy a great success will be achieved at both of the conferences. While visiting the Blessed Shrines he will remember the delegates and ask for them divine guidance. If presented properly the position of women in the Baha’i teachings will surely attract much attention, for it is not only legal but also spiritual and educational. Our ideals are so high and at the same time so practicable that all other views will fall short if compared to them.  Shoghi Effendi hopes that many will be able to attend these conferences and render all the assistance they possibly can.  [From the Guardian:]  I trust that the message sent on behalf of the Greatest Holy Leaf and myself has reached in time and been conveyed to the members of the conference. May the Almighty Hand of Baha’u’llah guide your steps and sustain your efforts in the manifold services you are rendering to the Cause. I will continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart.  January 7, 1931     Publication of the “Dawn-Breakers”   The Guardian has also received the account of the National Fund of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of India & Burma and he read it with careful attention and deep interest.  He was very pleased to learn with what self-sacrificing efforts our Indian brothers are toiling and he fervently prays that the Almighty may continually shower His blessings upon "]]]
