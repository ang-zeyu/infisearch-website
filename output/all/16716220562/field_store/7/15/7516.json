Cut a thoroughly chilled cucumber in dice; put the cucumber on a bed of lettuce leaves in the bottom of the bowl, and the roe, well drained, above; mask with mayonnaise,--nearly a cup will be required,--in the top insert a few heart leaves of lettuce, and place around the centre of the mound a circle of cucumber slices overlapping one another; or alternate these with lozenges cut from pickled beet.   =Boudins-de-Saumon Salad.=  Butter four small dariole moulds, or small cups; sprinkle the butter with chopped parsley. Select four small pieces of cooked salmon, dry on a soft cloth so as to remove all oily liquor, and put a piece in each mould. Beat two eggs (or, better, one egg and the yolks of two) slightly, season with one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of paprica and a few drops of anchovy essence or onion juice; add half a cup of milk, and, when well mixed, pour into the moulds around the fish. Set the moulds in a pan of hot water and bake until the custard is set. Do not let the water boil. Chill thoroughly, then turn from the moulds on to lettuce leaves. Serve with a star of mayonnaise dressing on the top of each _boudin_.   =Russian Salad.=  (BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL.)  INGREDIENTS.            1 cup of carrots.           1 cup of potatoes.           1 cup of peas.           1 cup of beans (flageolets preferred).           6 tablespoonfuls of oil.           3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.           1 teaspoonful of salt.           1/4 a teaspoonful of pepper.           A head of lettuce.           1 cup of mayonnaise.           1 cup of shrimps.           1/4 a lb. of smoked salmon.           1 hard-boiled egg.  _Method._--Marinate the carrots and potatoes, cut in small pieces, also the peas and beans, with French dressing. Arrange on a dish in four sections, having lettuce for the foundation of each. Cover each vegetable with mayonnaise. Strew the tops of two sections with small pieces of smoked salmon; on a third section strew the sifted yolk of the egg, and on the fourth, the white of the egg, cut rather coarsely. Outline the inner side of each section with shrimps, by lightly pressing the ends of the shrimps into the mayonnaise. Finish with a tuft of lettuce in the centre of the dish.   =Spanish Salad.=  In the centre of a flat serving-dish arrange a mound of endive. Peel tomatoes, divide into sections or cut in slices, and arrange these around the endive. Shell cold, hard-boiled eggs; cut in halves, crosswise, and in points; remove the yolks and pound to a paste with an equal amount of the flesh of lobster, shrimp, anchovies or salmon. With this paste, seasoned to taste with oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper, fill the cups fashioned from the whites of the eggs, and arrange them around the tomatoes. Strew chopped shallot and sweet pepper over the endive. Mix equal portions of oil and vinegar, add salt and pepper to taste, and pour over the salad. Serve at once.   =Salmon Salad.=  (_For evening company, or fish course at a dinner party._)  INGREDIENTS.            Hard-boiled eggs.           1 teaspoonful of gelatine, softened in one tablespoonful             of cold water.           1 pint of string beans or asparagus tips.           1 pint of cooked peas.           French dressing.           2 slices of salmon, 2 inches thick.           Jelly mayonnaise, or fancy butter.           Capers.  _Method._--Cut the eggs into halves lengthwise; cut a thin slice from the round ends, that the pieces may be set upright; dip lightly in the gelatine dissolved over hot water, and arrange _miroton_ fashion around an oval serving-dish. Set aside, that the eggs may become fixed in position. Marinate the vegetables, separately, with French dressing; cook the salmon by the directions previously given; remove the skin and cover the sides with jelly mayonnaise or fancy butter. When cold decorate with whites of eggs and capers. Use the trimmings from the eggs, and fix them in place by dipping in jelly mayonnaise. Set aside for the decorations to become fixed. Drain the vegetables and arrange inside the border, higher in the centre. Lay the decorated slices of fish upon opposite sides of the mound, and serve either with or without mayonnaise.   =Halibut Salad.=  (_For evening company, or fish course at a dinner party._)  INGREDIENTS.            A slice of chicken halibut, 3 inches thick.           3 cups of cooked peas.           French dressing.           Hard-boiled eggs.           3 slices of pickled beet.           1 teaspoonful of gelatine.           Jelly mayonnaise, or green butter.           Heart leaves of lettuce.           2 olives.  _Method._--Prepare the eggs and fasten to the plate as in salmon salad. Dip diamond-shaped pieces of pickled beet in the dissolved gelatine and place upon the front and top of each half of egg. Spread the edge of the fish, after removing the skin, with jelly mayonnaise, or green butter, and, when set, decorate with figures cut from the cooked white of an egg. With forcing-bag and tube shape a pattern around the upper edge of the fish. Place the fish in the centre of the crown or _miroton_ of eggs, with the peas seasoned with French dressing around it; cover the place from which the bone was taken with the centre of a head of lettuce, cut in halves, and two fine olives. Serve with a bowl of mayonnaise.  [Illustration: Russian Salad.]  [Illustration: Halibut Salad.  (See page 64)]   =Shells of Fish and Mushrooms.=  Cut cold fish--salmon, halibut, lobster, etc.--into small cubes, mix with one-third in measure of cooked mushrooms, also cut small, and add for each cup of mushrooms and fish one tablespoonful of gherkins cut fine. Season with French dressing and let stand one hour; then drain, and mix with jellied mayonnaise. Fill chilled shells with this preparation, rounding it on the top. Make smooth, and mask with jellied mayonnaise. Decorate with gherkins and the white of a hard-boiled egg cut in fanciful shapes, and with stars of mayonnaise.   =Oysters in Aspic Jelly.=  Parboil, drain, cool, and wipe dry one quart of oysters. Make a pint of mayonnaise sauce with aspic jelly and coat the well-dried oysters with the sauce. Prepare a quart of chicken aspic. Dip in half-set aspic the white of egg, poached and cut in fanciful shapes, and small gherkins cut in thin slices, and decorate the bottom and sides of a charlotte or cylindrical mould standing in ice water. Pour in jelly to the depth of half an inch; when set, arrange the oysters on it in a circle, one overlapping another; pour in more jelly, and, when set, dispose upon it another circle of oysters. Continue this order until the mould is filled. When removed from the mould, garnish with chopped aspic and fans cut from gherkins and lettuce. Serve with the remainder of the pint of mayonnaise.   =Oyster-and-Celery Salad.=  Parboil the oysters (heating them to the boiling-point in their own liquor), drain, and, if large, halve each; marinate with a French dressing (_i.e._, toss the bits of oyster in oil enough to coat them nicely; then toss them in a little lemon juice, dust with salt and pepper, and set aside to become thoroughly chilled). When ready to serve, drain again and add about one-third as much in bulk of fine-chopped celery and one or two tablespoonfuls of pickled nasturtium seeds or capers; then mix with mayonnaise or a boiled dressing. Serve on a bed of lettuce leaves. Cabbage, sliced as for slaw, may be used in the place of celery. Garnish with small pickles cut in thin slices and spread to resemble a fan.   =Oyster-and-Sweetbread Salad.=  Cut a pair of cold cooked sweetbreads into cubes. Parboil one pint of oysters, drain, cool, and cut in halves; marinate the sweetbreads and oysters with French dressing, and allow them to stand at least half an hour; drain, mix with mayonnaise, and serve on a bed of lettuce or cress. Or, surround with a circle of chopped cucumbers seasoned with French dressing.   =Shrimp Salad in Cucumber Boats.=  Pare the cucumbers, which should be rather short, and cut them in halves lengthwise; remove the seeds and steam until tender; chill, and arrange on lettuce leaves, or on a bed of watercress. Clean and marinate the shrimps. If large, divide into two or three pieces. Mix with mayonnaise and place in the cucumbers. Decorate with stars of mayonnaise and whole shrimps.   =Shrimp Salad with Aspic Border.=  Set a border mould in ice water; dip hard-boiled eggs, cut in halves lengthwise and trimmed to fit the mould, in aspic jelly, and press against the sides of the mould alternately with small vegetable balls, or peas dipped in half-set aspic; fill gradually the empty space in the mould with partly cooled jelly, adding vegetables here and there if desired. Dip in hot water and turn from the mould. Fill in the centre with lettuce, torn in pieces, and one pint of shrimps, broken in pieces and dressed with French dressing. Smooth the mound and mask with jelly mayonnaise. Decorate with shrimps and small heart leaves of lettuce.   =Shrimp Salad with Aspic Border, No. 2.=  Decorate the sides of a ring mould, chilled, with hard-boiled eggs cut in halves, alternated with hearts of lettuce cut in halves; dip the egg and lettuce in half-set aspic, and they will adhere to the sides of the mould. Then proceed as above.   =Shrimp Salad.=  Take the shrimps from the shells, reserve the most perfect for garnishing, and break the others into pieces; marinate with French dressing. When ready to serve, drain, and mix with shredded lettuce, or celery cut fine, and mayonnaise. Shape in a mound on a bed of lettuce leaves and mask with mayonnaise. Use capers or olives, chopped very fine, to mark out five or six designs on the mound; a scroll effect is always pretty. Fill in the designs with shrimps and the rest of the mound with capers, sifted yolks or chopped whites of cooked eggs; or fill the designs with the capers or eggs and the rest of the mound with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19079"],["title","The Adventures of Lightfoot the Deer (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net      [Illustration: Wonderfully handsome was                Lightfoot the Deer.]     LIGHTFOOT THE DEER    BY  THORNTON W.

He had just seen Mr. and Mrs. Quack start toward the Big River for a brief visit before leaving on their long, difficult journey to the far-away Southland. Farewells are always rather sad, and this particular farewell had left Peter with a lump in his throat,--a queer, choky feeling.  \"If I were sure that they would return next spring, it wouldn't be so bad,\" he muttered. \"It's those terrible guns. I know what it is to have to watch out for them. Farmer Brown's boy used to hunt me with one of them, but he doesn't any more. But even when he did hunt me it wasn't anything like what the Ducks have to go through. If I kept my eyes and ears open, I could tell when a hunter was coming and could hide in a hole if I wanted to. I never had to worry about my meals. But with the Ducks it is a thousand times worse. They've got to eat while making that long journey, and they can eat only where there is the right kind of food. Hunters with terrible guns know where those places are and hide there until the Ducks come, and the Ducks have no way of knowing whether the hunters are waiting for them or not. That isn't hunting. It's--it's--\"  \"Well, what is it? What are you talking to yourself about, Peter Rabbit?\"  Peter looked up with a start to find the soft, beautiful eyes of Lightfoot the Deer gazing down at him over the top of a little hemlock tree.  \"It's awful,\" declared Peter. \"It's worse than unfair. It doesn't give them any chance at all.\"  \"I suppose it must be so if you say so,\" replied Lightfoot, \"but you might tell me what all this awfulness is about.\"  Peter grinned. Then he began at the beginning and told Lightfoot all about Mr. and Mrs. Quack and the many dangers they must face on their long journey to the far-away Southland and back again in the spring, all because of the heartless hunters with terrible guns. Lightfoot listened and his great soft eyes were filled with pity for the Quack family.  \"I hope they will get through all right,\" said he, \"and I hope they will get back in the spring. It is bad enough to be hunted by men at one time of the year, as no one knows better than I do, but to be hunted in the spring as well as in the fall is more than twice as bad. Men are strange creatures. I do not understand them at all. None of the people of the Green Forest would think of doing such terrible things. I suppose it is quite right to hunt others in order to get enough to eat, though I am thankful to say that I never have had to do that, but to hunt others just for the fun of hunting is something I cannot understand at all. And yet that is what men seem to do it for. I guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and don't know how it feels. Sometimes I think I'll hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson. What are you laughing at, Peter?\"  \"At the idea of you hunting a man,\" replied Peter. \"Your heart is all right, Lightfoot, but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one. Big as you are I wouldn't fear you.\"  With a single swift bound Lightfoot sprang out in front of Peter. He stamped his sharp hoofs, lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers, which people call horns, pointed straight at Peter, lifted the hair along the back of his neck, and made a motion as if to plunge at him. His eyes, which Peter had always thought so soft and gentle, seemed to flash fire.  \"Oh!\" cried Peter in a faint, frightened-sounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that Lightfoot was just pretending.  Lightfoot chuckled. \"Did you say I couldn't frighten any one?\" he demanded.  \"I--I didn't know you could look so terribly fierce,\" stammered Peter. \"Those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way. Why--why--what is that hanging to them? It looks like bits of old fur. Have you been tearing somebody's coat, Lightfoot?\" Peter's eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion.     CHAPTER II  LIGHTFOOT'S NEW ANTLERS   Peter Rabbit was puzzled. He stared at Lightfoot the Deer a wee bit suspiciously. \"Have you been tearing somebody's coat?\" he asked again. He didn't like to think it of Lightfoot, whom he always had believed quite as gentle, harmless, and timid as himself. But what else could he think?  Lightfoot slowly shook his head. \"No,\" said he, \"I haven't torn anybody's coat.\"  \"Then what are those rags hanging on your antlers?\" demanded Peter.  Lightfoot chuckled. \"They are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers,\" he explained.  \"What's that? What do you mean by new antlers?\" Peter was sitting up very straight, with his eyes fixed on Lightfoot's antlers as though he never had seen them before.  \"Just what I said,\" retorted Lightfoot. \"What do you think of them? I think they are the finest antlers I've ever had. When I get the rest of those rags off, they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the Green Forest.\"  Lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off.  Peter blinked very hard. He was trying to understand and he couldn't. Finally he said so.  \"What kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with?\" he demanded indignantly. \"Do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as I've known you? How can anything hard like those antlers grow? And if those are new ones, where are the old ones? Show me the old ones, and perhaps I'll believe that these are new ones. The idea of trying to make me believe that antlers grow just like plants! I've seen Bossy the Cow all summer and I know she has got the same horns she had last summer. New antlers indeed!\"  \"You are quite right, Peter, quite right about Bossy the Cow. She never has new horns, but that isn't any reason why I shouldn't have new antlers, is it?\" replied Lightfoot patiently. \"Her horns are quite different from my antlers. I have a new pair every year. You haven't seen me all summer, have you, Peter?\"  \"No, I don't remember that I have,\" replied Peter, trying very hard to remember when he had last seen Lightfoot.  \"I _know_ you haven't,\" retorted Lightfoot. \"I know it because I have been hiding in a place you never visit.\"  \"What have you been hiding for?\" demanded Peter.  \"For my new antlers "]]]
