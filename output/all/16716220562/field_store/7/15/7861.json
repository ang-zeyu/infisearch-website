[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19314"],["title","Raphael (#7)"],["body"," saying: \"What! you profess to heal the sick, and you can do nothing for this poor sufferer!\"  The figures in the background are crying aloud and stretching out their arms for aid. One can count the persons, but it looks as if there were a crowd behind that we do not see, all pressing forward.  On the other side of the picture are the disciples, all eager, with heads bent forward, and each gesturing to express his meaning. One, younger than the others, with his hand against his breast, looks at the father with a pitying but helpless expression, as if he would gladly help him if he only could. Another has an open book as though he were trying to find some word of comfort. One is pointing out the boy to his neighbor, and two in the background seem to be lost in perplexity.  But, after all, though most of the disciples are thus intent, the eye quickly notes the action of a figure near the centre, full of fire and energy, who is pointing upward, away from the group, and calling upon the father and the women to look that way. And the line of his arm thrust out is continued by that of another disciple behind him, who also points upward.  For these two have seen the Lord, and they are bidding the troubled parents look the same way for help. There, above all this turmoil and confusion, is a scene of dazzling light, of which they alone seem to be aware.  [Illustration: THE TRANSFIGURATION _Vatican Gallery, Rome_]  The upper part of the picture discloses the transfiguration of the Saviour. As the evangelist tells us, he had taken Peter and James and John with him, and had gone up into a mountain to pray.       \"And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was      altered, and his raiment was white and glistering. And,      behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and      Elias, who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which      he should accomplish at Jerusalem. But Peter and they that      were with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were      awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with      him.\"[8]  [Footnote 8: Luke, chapter ix., verses 29-32.]  The scene shown is at the moment of the awaking of the three disciples, one not daring to look up again, but bowing his head and folding his hands in prayer. They are dazzled with the glory. This glory is a cloud of brightness which envelops the three figures of Christ, Moses, and Elijah, or as the Greeks called him, Elias. The Saviour looks heavenward with rapture in his gaze.  On one side are seen two kneeling figures. They are said to stand for the father and uncle of the Cardinal who ordered the picture from Raphael. It was the fashion of the day thus to introduce a patron into a painting, and Raphael has made them as obscure as he well could.  We must not look at this great picture as if it were a panorama, where a succession of scenes is witnessed, or find fault with it because the Bible says that the transfiguration took place on one day and the scene below took place the next day, when Jesus and his disciples had come down from the mountain. Nor is anything said in the Bible which would lead us to suppose that Jesus and the prophets were raised above the ground.  No; what Raphael intended was to draw a contrast between an earthly scene of suffering and a heavenly scene of peace and serenity; and he took two scenes which lie next each other in the scripture narrative. That was his thought, and see how wonderfully he has expressed this contrast throughout!  There is the dark confusion and helplessness and grief below; above is a scene of light which is like a vision, and this vision two of the disciples see; and as we have pointed out, a contrast is made evident in various parts of the picture. Indeed, the painting is made up of contrasts; and not the least noticeable is that of the solid mass below, square shaped, and the light, pyramid-shaped composition above.  The Transfiguration was the last painting to which Raphael set his brush, and it was still unfinished when he was suddenly stricken with fever and died. As his body lay in state, in the hall where he had been working, this great picture was hung at the head, and the people who came in fell to weeping when they saw it.     XI  PARNASSUS   Raphael was but twenty-five years old when he was bidden adorn a room in the Vatican palace, and he made the four walls answer to four divisions in the ceiling, just as afterward in the Heliodorus room. The four divisions in the ceiling were filled with four figures, representing Theology, Poetry, Philosophy, and Justice. Beneath Poetry was this large, full design of Parnassus.  [Illustration: PARNASSUS _Vatican Palace, Rome_]  Parnassus, in the old Greek myth, was the mountain on which the muses were wont to meet, and here Apollo had his chief seat. Here, in the fancy of the ancients, the poets and historians and dramatists came to draw inspiration. So Raphael has made a great company of gods and goddesses, and ancient and modern poets.  By means of the accompanying diagram, all the figures in the composition can be made out.  As it is an imaginary scene, Raphael was free to bring together poets of different ages and countries, grouping them by the natural association of one with another. In this mythic realm time and space are as nothing, and the poets are united in the higher fellowship of the inspired imagination.  [Illustration: KEY TO PARNASSUS 1. Apollo 2. Calliope 3.

Apollo, of course, as the god of poetry and music, occupies the central position, seated beneath some laurel trees, near the sacred fountain of Hippocrene, with the nine Muses circling about him. Apollo is always spoken of as playing the lyre, but Raphael gives him a violin, because the action in playing that instrument is so graceful. Some think also he meant to pay a compliment to a famous violinist of that day.  Calliope, the muse of epic poetry, rests for a moment the long trumpet whose epic strains are wont to stir the courage of men. Polymnia, the muse of sacred poetry, leans upon the lyre whose vibrant strings thrill the gentler emotions of faith and love.  Blind old Homer advances chanting the adventures of the Greek heroes, and an eager youth writes down the verses. Behind him are Virgil and Dante, and Virgil seems to be calling on Dante to listen to Apollo.  Another group shows Pindar, a very aged figure, reciting his impassioned odes to Horace and another poet, who listen with admiration. Plautus and Terence, two writers of Latin comedy, walk together in pleasant companionship.  It was not an easy matter to dispose of the many figures and groups in a space cut into, as this wall is, by a window, but how free and how natural is the arrangement! It was among the first great paintings which Raphael executed in the Vatican, and the grace and harmony which mark his later works are here shown.  The picture is interesting also as another illustration of the great revival of learning which took place in Raphael's day. The old literature of Greece and Rome had been rediscovered. For centuries it had lain like a buried city, forgotten under the ignorance and the fighting of the Middle Ages. Now it was brought to light, and the recovered treasure was the common possession of Italy, not indeed so much of the plain people as of the learned men and the artists.  Raphael, as an artist, took delight in the statues which had been found, and the other signs of Greek and Roman art; but it is not to be supposed that he would know Homer and Virgil and Horace and Pindar and Sappho at first hand. He had, however, friends among the learned men, who could tell him of the treasures of classic literature, and his imagination was quick to seize this material and adapt it to artistic purposes.       NOTE.--The key to Parnassus on page 61 is based on the      description of the painting in Cav. E. G. Massi's      \"Descrizione delle Gallerie di Pittura nel Pontificio      Palazzo Vaticano,\" the authoritative guide-book to the      Vatican. Miss Eliza Allen Starr, in her monograph on the      frescoes of the Camera della Segnatura, called \"The Three      Keys,\" identifies some of the figures differently, following      the authority of Dandolo's lectures. The \"unknown\" figure      she calls Sordello.     XII  SOCRATES AND ALCIBIADES   In the same room which holds Parnassus, with Poetry above on the ceiling, there is another wall painting by Raphael, which commonly bears the name of The School of Athens, though that name was not originally applied to it. In the ceiling above is a figure representing Philosophy, and the picture below carries out the idea in its presentation of an assembly of scholars.  Just as in Parnassus Raphael brought together as in a beautiful dream the god of poetry, the nine muses, and famous poets of the ancient and what was to him the modern world, so, in the School of Athens, he has assembled a great company of philosophers, chiefly out of the famous line of Greek scholars. In a general way he has divided the assembly into two groups, one of men who devote themselves to pure thought, the other of those who apply their thought to science, like geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and music.  There are more than fifty figures in this great painting. Raphael has made it clear whom he meant to represent, in many cases. They were the philosophers, whom his friends among the cardinals and learned men were so enthusiastic about. But he has also gathered about these teachers those who might be their pupils; they are in many cases young Italians of his own day; indeed, he has even pictured himself"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19314"],["title","Raphael (#8)"],["body","in with a fellow artist.  What interested him was to paint a great number of persons who should show by their faces and their attitudes that they were busy, in an animated way, over what was worth thinking about. He placed them in a noble hall, with a domed recess at the end, such as a great architect of his day might have built. He showed a noble colonnade of pillars, and he placed in niches statues of the old Greek gods like Apollo and Minerva, who would be supposed to take an interest in what was going on.  The picture is so large and has so many figures that it would not be easy to reproduce it here, and give a good idea of its various parts; so a portion only is shown, depicting what is commonly known as the group of Socrates and Alcibiades. Socrates can surely be distinguished, for he had a singular face and head. Some have thought the companion was not Alcibiades, but Xenophon.  It does not greatly matter. Each was his companion and pupil, when he was living. Xenophon wrote a narrative of his master's life and death. Alcibiades is often mentioned in the dialogues of Plato, who also has preserved for us the great sayings of Socrates. Two or three men stand about, listening to a discussion which Socrates is having with his companion.  [Illustration: SOCRATES AND ALCIBIADES _Vatican Palace, Rome_]  The chief interest centres in Socrates, who seems to be explaining his principles, telling them off, one by one, on his fingers. In the old accounts which we have of this philosopher, he is shown to have been a man who had thought deeply about the most important things, but used the plainest, most homely speech when he was trying to make his meaning clear. His plain face and eccentric figure were a familiar sight in the market places, where he used to linger, drawing young men into conversation, by which he tried to show them the better things of life.  Alcibiades was, as Socrates acknowledged, \"the fairest and tallest of the citizens;\" he was also \"among the noblest of them,\" and the nephew of the powerful Athenian, Pericles. Moreover, he was rich, though this was a smaller matter. All these things, however, had lifted Alcibiades up; and with the vanity of youth, he was ambitious for a great oratorical career, without having in reality any sufficient preparation. It is at this juncture that he falls in with Socrates, who begins to question him kindly about his plans. The young man confesses his ambitions, and the philosopher innocently asks him where and how he has made his preparatory studies. Alcibiades seems to think that the ordinary subjects of oratory, such as questions of war and peace, justice and injustice, need no special knowledge but that learned of the people.  \"I cannot say that I have a high opinion of your teachers,\" says the shrewd old philosopher; \"you know that knowledge is the first qualification of any teacher?\"  _Alcibiades._ Certainly.  _Socrates._ And if they know, they must agree together and not differ?  _Alcibiades._ Yes.  _Socrates._ And would you say that they knew the things about which they differ?  _Alcibiades._ No.  _Socrates._ Then how can they teach them?  _Alcibiades._ They cannot.[9]  So little by little, as one question follows another, Alcibiades comes to see that the popular knowledge upon which he depends is a very weak and variable thing. He confesses at last his own folly, and declares his resolution to devote himself to thoughtful study.  [Footnote 9: From Plato's dialogue, _Alcibiades_, Jowett's translation.]     XIII  THE FLIGHT OF √ÜNEAS   In the series of rooms in the Vatican palace, of which one contains Parnassus, and another the Expulsion of Heliodorus and the Liberation of Peter, there is a room, the first of the series, which is called the Room of the Great Fire, because it contains a large picture of the Conflagration in the Borgo.  The Borgo is that quarter of Rome where the Vatican stands, and in the ninth century there was, one day, a great fire there. It was said that the fire was put out by the Pope of that time, Leo IV., who stood in a portico connected with the church of St. Peter, and made the sign of the cross.  Raphael was bidden make a painting upon one wall of the room, which should represent the scene, and in his characteristic fashion he made it to be not merely a copy of what he might suppose the scene to have been; he introduced a poetic element, which at once made the piece a work of great imagination.  A poet, who was describing such an event, might use an illustration from some other great historic fire. He might have said in effect: \"In this burning of the Borgo, men could have been seen carrying the aged away on their shoulders, as when in ancient times Troy was burned, and √Üneas bore his father Anchises away from the falling timbers.\"  This is exactly what Raphael did in painting. In the background of the picture is seen Pope Leo IV. with his clergy, in the portico of the old church of St. Peter's. The Pope's hand is raised, making the sign of the cross; on the steps of the church are the people who have fled to it for refuge. On each side of the foreground are burning houses. Men are busy putting out the fire, and women are bringing them water. Other men and women and children are escaping from the flames, and some are heroically saving the weak and helpless.  It is amongst these last that Raphael has placed the group called the Flight of √Üneas. The Trojan bears on his shoulders his father, the old, blind Anchises. Behind is Creusa, the wife of √Üneas, looking back with terror upon the burning city, and by the side of √Üneas is his young son Iulus, looking up into his face with a trusting gaze.  [Illustration: THE FLIGHT OF √ÜNEAS _Vatican Palace, Rome_]  Some one of Raphael's friends had no doubt told him the story, or read it to him out of Virgil's √Üneid, which was one of the favorite books in that day, when men were delighting in the recovery of the great poetry of Greece and Rome. Here is a part of the story as told by Virgil in the translation by C. P. Cranch:--      \"But when I reached my old paternal home,     My father, whom I wished to bear away     To the high mountains, and who first of all     I sought, refused to lengthen out his life,     And suffer exile, now that Troy was lost.     'O ye,' he said, 'whose blood is full of life,     Whose solid strength in youthful vigor stands,--     Plan ye your flight! But if the heavenly powers     Had destined me to live, they would have kept     For me these seats. Enough, more than enough,     That one destruction I have seen, and I     Survive the captured city. Go ye then,     Bidding this frame farewell--thus, lying thus     Extended on the earth! I shall find death     From some hand.'             *       *       *       *       *                          'O father, dost thou think     That I can go and leave thee here alone?     Comes such bad counsel from my father's lips?     If't is the pleasure of the gods that naught     From the whole city should be left, and this     Is thy determined thought and wish, to add     To perishing Troy thyself and all thy kin,--     The gate lies open for that death desired.'\"  So saying, √Üneas calls for his arms, resolved to remain with Father Anchises fighting the Greeks to the death. Thereupon Creusa his wife begins to weep, begging him not to leave her and her little boy Iulus to perish in the flames. In the midst of her lamentations a sacred omen is given, in the appearance of lambent flames playing about the head of Iulus. Anchises is convinced of the will of the gods.      \"'Now, now,' he cries, 'for us no more delay!     I follow; and wherever ye may lead,     Gods of my country, I will go! Guard ye     My family, my little grandson guard.     This augury is yours; and yours the power     That watches Troy. And now, my son, I yield,     Nor will refuse to go along with thee.'     And now through all the city we can hear     The roaring flames, which nearer roll their heat.     'Come then, dear father! On my shoulders I     Will bear thee, nor will think the task severe.     Whatever lot awaits us, there shall be     One danger and one safety for us both.     Little Iulus my companion be;     And at a distance let my wife observe     Our footsteps.'             *       *       *       *       *                      This said, a tawny lion's skin     On my broad shoulders and my stooping neck     I throw, and take my burden. At my side     Little Iulus links his hand in mine,     Following his father with unequal steps.     Behind us steps my wife. Through paths obscure     We wend; and I, who but a moment since     Dreaded no flying weapons of the Greeks,     Nor dense battalions of the adverse hosts,     Now start in terror at each rustling breeze,     And every common sound, held in suspense     With equal fears for those attending me,     And for the burden that I bore along.\"     XIV  ST. MICHAEL SLAYING THE DRAGON   There are many legends about St. Michael, who is also represented as the Archangel, or head of the whole company of angels, and most of these legends spring from a few passages in the Bible, chiefly two. One of these is in the Epistle of Jude, the ninth verse, where the archangel Michael is alluded to as \"contending with the Devil.\" The other is in the Book of Revelation, beginning at the seventh verse of the ninth chapter:--      \"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought     against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and     prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in     heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent     called the Devil, and Satan which deceiveth the whole world;     he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out     with him.\"  The Book of Revelation is full of strange imagery; and ever since it was written, men learned and unlearned have tried to turn its impassioned verses into real historical scenes, past or to come."]]]
