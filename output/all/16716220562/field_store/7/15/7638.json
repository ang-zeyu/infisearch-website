We could not understand this, nor why the light was thrown      from outside and above instead of from inside the flying machine,      but the explanation may be found in the immense heat that must have      been required to generate the light, since it illuminated the entire      country for fifty miles or so, and we were able to read without      trouble the fine print of the abbot's rubric. This Flying Ring moved      on an even keel at the tremendous velocity of about two hundred      miles an hour. We wondered what would happen if it turned turtle,      for in that case the weight of the superstructure would have      rendered it impossible for the machine to right itself. In fact,      none of us had ever imagined any such air monster before. Beside it      a Zeppelin seemed like a wooden toy.       The Ring passed over the mountains toward Cabes and within a short      time a volcanic eruption occurred that destroyed a section of the      Atlas Range. [Mr. Quinn here describes with considerable detail the      destruction of the mountains.] The next morning I found Biskra      crowded with Arabs, who reported that the ocean had poured through      the passage made by the eruption and was flooding the entire desert      as far south as the oasis of Wargla, and that it had come within      twelve miles of the walls of our own city. I at once hired a donkey      and made a personal investigation, with the result that I can report      as a fact that the entire desert east and south of Biskra is      inundated to a depth of from seven to ten feet and that the water      gives no sign of going down. The loss of life seems to have been      negligible, owing to the fact that the height of the water is not      great and that many unexpected islands have provided safety for the      caravans that were _in transitu_. These are now marooned and waiting      for assistance, which I am informed will be sent from Cabes in the      form of flat-bottomed boats fitted with motor auxiliaries.       Respectfully submitted,       D. W. QUINN, Jr.,      Acting U. S. Consul.  The Italian cruiser _Fiala_, which had been carried one hundred and eighty miles into the desert on the night of the eruption, grounded safely on the plateau of Tasili, but the volcanic tidal wave on which she had been swept along, having done its work, receded, leaving too little water for the _Fiala's_ draft of thirty-seven feet. Four launches sent out in different directions to the south and east reported no sign of land, but immense quantities of floating vegetable matter, yellow dust, and the bodies of jackals, camels, zebras, and lions. The fifth launch after great hardships reached the seacoast through the new channel and arrived at Sfax after eight days.  The mean tide level of the Mediterranean sank fifteen inches, and the water showed marked discoloration for several months, while a volcanic haze hung over Northern Africa, Sicily, Malta, and Sardinia for an even longer period.  Though many persons must have lost their lives the records are incomplete in this respect; but there is a curious document in the mosque at Sfax touching the effect of the Lavender Ray. It appears that an Arab mussel-gatherer was in a small boat with his two brothers at the time the Ring appeared above the mountains. As they looked up toward the sky the Ray flashed over and illuminated their faces. They thought nothing of it at the time, for almost immediately the mountains were rent asunder and in the titanic upheaval that followed they were all cast upon the shore, as they thought, dead men. Reaching Sfax they reported their adventures and offered prayers in gratitude for their extraordinary escape; but five days later all three began to suffer excruciating torment from internal burns, the skin upon their heads and bodies began to peel off, and they died in agony within the week.     VIII   It was but a few days thereafter that the President of the United States received the official note from Count von Koenitz, on behalf of the Imperial German Commissioners, to the effect that Germany would join with the other Powers in an armistice looking toward peace and ultimately a universal disarmament. Similar notes had already been received by the President from France, Great Britain, Russia, Italy, Austria, Spain, and Slavia, and a multitude of the other smaller Powers who were engaged in the war, and there was no longer any reason for delaying the calling of an international council or diet for the purpose of bringing about what Pax demanded as a ransom for the safety of the globe.  In the files of the State Department at Washington there is secreted the only record of the diplomatic correspondence touching these momentous events, and a transcript of the messages exchanged between the President of the United States and the Arbiter of Human Destiny. They are comparatively few in number, for Pax seemed to be satisfied to leave all details to the Powers themselves. In the interest of saving time, however, he made the simple suggestion that the present ambassadors should be given plenary powers to determine the terms and conditions upon which universal peace should be declared. All these proceedings and the reasons therefore were kept profoundly secret. It began to look as though the matter would be put through with characteristic Yankee promptness. Pax's suggestion was acceded to, and the ambassadors and ministers were given unrestricted latitude in drawing the treaty that should abolish war forever.  Now that he had been won over no one was more indefatigable than Von Koenitz, none more fertile in suggestions. It was he who drafted with his own hand the forty pages devoted to the creation of the commission charged with the duty of destroying all arms, munitions, and implements of war; and he not only acted as chairman of the preliminary drafting committee, but was an active member of at least half a dozen other important subcommittees. The President daily communicated the progress of this conference of the Powers to Pax through Bill Hood, and received daily in return a hearty if laconic approval.       \"I am satisfied of the sincerity of the Powers and with the      progress made. PAX.\"  was the ordinary type of message received. Meantime word had been sent to all the governments that an indefinite armistice had been declared, to commence at the end of ten days, for it had been found necessary to allow for the time required to transmit the orders to the various fields of military operations throughout Europe. In the interim the war continued.  It was at this time that Count von Koenitz, who now was looked upon as the leading figure of the conference, arose and said: \"Your Excellencies, this distinguished diet will, I doubt not, presently conclude its labours and receive not only the approval of the Powers represented but the gratitude of the nations of the world. I voice the sentiments of the Imperial Commissioners when I say that no Power looks forward with greater eagerness than Germany to the accomplishment of our purpose. But we should not forget that there is one menace to mankind greater than that of war--namely, the lurking danger from the power of this unknown possessor of superhuman knowledge of explosives. So far his influence has been a benign one, but who can say when it may become malignant? Will our labours please him? Perhaps not. Shall we agree? I hope so, but who can tell? Will our armies lay down their arms even after we have agreed? I believe all will go well; but is it wise for us to refrain from jointly taking steps to ascertain the identity of this unknown juggler with Nature, and the source of his power? It is my own opinion, since we cannot exert any influence or control upon this individual, that we should take whatever steps are within our grasp to safeguard ourselves in the event that he refuses to keep faith with us. To this end I suggest an international conference of scientific men from all the nations to be held here in Washington coincidently with our own meetings, with a view to determining these questions.\"  His remarks were greeted with approval by almost all the representatives present except Sir John Smith, who mildly hinted that such a course might be regarded as savouring a trifle of double dealing. Should Pax receive knowledge of the suggested conference he might question their sincerity and view all their doings with suspicion. In a word, Sir John believed in following a consistent course and treating Pax as a friend and ally and not as a possible enemy.  Sir John's speech, however, left the delegates unconvinced and with the feeling that his argument was over-refined. They felt that there could be no objection to endeavouring to ascertain the source of Pax's power--the law of self-preservation seemed to indicate such a course as necessary. And it had, in fact, already been discussed vaguely by several less conspicuous delegates. Accordingly it was voted, with but two dissenting voices,[2] to summon what was known as Conference No. 2, to be held as soon as possible, its proceedings to be conducted in secret under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, with the president of the Academy acting as permanent chairman. To this conference the President appointed Thornton as one of the three delegates from the United States.  [Footnote 2: The President of the United States also voted in the negative.]  The council of the Powers having so voted, Count von Koenitz at once transmitted, by way of Sayville, a message which in code appeared to be addressed to a Herr Karl Heinweg, Notary, at 12^{BIS} Bunden Strasse, Strassburg, and related to a mortgage about to fall due upon some of Von Koenitz's properties in Thüringen. When decoded it read:       \"_To the Imperial Commissioners of the German Federated"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19174"],["title","The Man Who Rocked the Earth (#8)"],["body",":_       \"I have the honour to report that acting according to your      distinguished instructions I have this day proposed an international      conference to consider the scientific problems presented by certain      recent phenomena and that my proposition was adopted. I believe that      in this way the proceedings here may be delayed indefinitely and      time thus secured to enable an expedition to be organized and      dispatched for the purpose of destroying this unknown person or      ascertaining the secret of his power, in accordance with my previous      suggestion. It would be well to send as delegates to this Conference      No. 2 several professors of physics who can by plausible arguments      and ingenious theories so confuse the matter that no determination      can be reached. I suggest Professors Gasgabelaus, of München, and      Leybach, of the Hague.      \"VON KOENITZ.\"  And having thus fulfilled his duty the count took a cab to the Metropolitan Club and there played a discreet game of billiards with Señor Tomasso Varilla, the ex-minister from Argentina.  Von Koenitz from the first had played his hand with a skill which from a diplomatic view left nothing to be desired. The extraordinary natural phenomena which had occurred coincidentally with the first message of Pax to the President of the United States and the fall of Cleopatra's Needle had been immediately observed by the scientists attached to the Imperial and other universities throughout the German Federated States, and had no sooner been observed than their significance had been realized. These most industrious and thorough of all human investigators had instantly reported the facts and their preliminary conclusions to the Imperial Commissioners, with the recommendation that no stone be left unturned in attempting to locate and ascertain the causes of this disruption of the forces of nature. The Commissioners at once demanded an exhaustive report from the faculty of the Imperial German University, and notified Von Koenitz by cable that until further notice he must seek in every way to delay investigation by other nations and to belittle the importance of what had occurred, for these astute German scientists had at once jumped to the conclusion that the acceleration of the earth's motion had been due to some human agency possessed of a hitherto unsuspected power.  It was for this reason that at the first meeting at the White House the Ambassador had pooh-poohed the whole matter and talked of snowstorms in the Alps and showers of fish at Heidelburg, but with the rending of the northern coast of Africa and the well-attested appearances of \"The Ring\" he soon reached the conclusion that his wisest course was to cause such a delay on the part of the other Powers that the inevitable race for the secret would be won by the nation which he so astutely represented. He reasoned, quite accurately, that the scientists of England, Russia, and America would not remain idle in attempting to deduce the cause and place the origin of the phenomena and the habitat of the master of the Ring, and that the only effectual means to enable Germany to capture this, the greatest of all prizes of war, was to befuddle the representatives of the other nations while leaving his own unhampered in their efforts to accomplish that which would make his countrymen, almost without further effort, the masters of the world. Now the easiest way to befuddle the scientists of the world was to get them into one place and befuddle them all together, and this, after communicating with his superiors, he had proceeded to do. He was a clever man, trained in the devious ways of the Wilhelmstrasse, and when he set out to accomplish something he was almost inevitably successful. Yet in spite of the supposed alliance between Kaiser and Deity man proposes and God disposes, and sometimes the latter uses the humblest of human instruments in that disposition.     IX   The Imperial German Commissioner for War, General Hans von Helmuth, was a man of extraordinary decision and farsightedness. Sixty years of age, he had been a member of the general staff since he was forty. He had sat at the feet of Bismarck and Von Moltke, and during his active participation in the management of German military affairs he had seen but slight changes in their policy: Mass--overwhelming mass; sudden momentous onslaught, and, above all, an attack so quick that your adversary could not regain his feet. It worked nine times out of ten, and when it didn't it was usually better than taking the defensive. General von Helmuth having an approved system was to that extent relieved of anxiety, for all he had to do was to work out details. In this his highly efficient organization was almost automatic. He himself was a human compendium of knowledge, and he had but to press a button and emit a few gutturals and any information that he wanted lay typewritten before him. Now he sat in his office smoking a Bremen cigar and studying a huge Mercatorial projection of the Atlantic and adjacent countries, while with the fingers of his left hand he combed his heavy beard.  From the window he looked down upon the inner fortifications of Mainz--to which city the capital had been removed three months before--and upon the landing stage for the scouting planes which were constantly arriving or whirring off toward Holland or Strassburg. Across the river, under the concealed guns of a sunken battery, stood the huge hangars of the now useless dirigibles Z^{51~57}. The landing stage communicated directly by telephone with the adjutant's office, an enormous hall filled with maps, with which Von Helmuth's private room was connected. The adjutant himself, a worried-looking man with a bullet head and an iron-gray moustache, stood at a table in the centre of the hall addressing rapid-fire sentences to various persons who appeared in the doorway, saluted, and hurried off again. Several groups were gathered about the table and the adjutant carried on an interrupted conversation with all of them, pausing to read the telegrams and messages that shot out of the pneumatic tubes upon the table from the telegraph and telephone office on the floor below.  An elderly man in rather shabby clothes entered, looking about helplessly through the thick lenses of his double spectacles, and the adjutant turned at once from the officers about him with an \"Excuse me, gentlemen.\"  \"Good afternoon, Professor von Schwenitz; the general is waiting for you,\" said he. \"This way, please.\"  He stalked across to the door of the inner office.  \"Professor von Schwenitz is here,\" he announced, and immediately returned to take up the thread of his conversation in the centre of the hall.  The general turned gruffly to greet his visitor. \"I have sent for you, Professor,\" said he, without removing his cigar, \"in order that I may fully understand the method by which you say you have ascertained the place of origin of the wireless messages and electrical disturbances referred to in our communications of last week. This may be a serious matter. The accuracy of your information is of vital importance.\"  The professor hesitated in embarrassment, and the general scowled.  \"Well?\" he demanded, biting off the chewed end of his cigar. \"Well? This is not a lecture room. Time is short. Out with it.\"  \"Your Excellency!\" stammered the poor professor, \"I--I----The observations are so--inadequate--one cannot determine----\"  \"What?\" roared Von Helmuth. \"But you said you _had_!\"  \"Only approximately, your Excellency. One cannot be positive, but within a reasonable distance----\" He paused.  \"What do you call a reasonable distance? I supposed your physics was an exact science!\" retorted the general.  \"But the data----\"  \"What do you call a reasonable distance?\" bellowed the Imperial Commissioner.  \"A hundred kilometres!\" suddenly shouted the overwrought professor, losing control of himself. \"I won't be talked to this way, do you hear? I won't! How can a man think? I'm a member of the faculty of the Imperial University. I've been decorated twice--twice!\"  \"Fiddlesticks!\" returned the general, amused in spite of himself. \"Don't be absurd. I merely wish you to hurry. Have a cigar?\"  \"Oh, your Excellency!\" protested the professor, now both ashamed and frightened. \"You must excuse me. The war has shattered my nerves. May I smoke? Thank you.\"  \"Sit down. Take your time,\" said Von Helmuth, looking out and up at a monoplane descending toward the landing in slowly lessening spirals.  \"You see, your Excellency,\" explained Von Schwenitz, \"the data are fragmentary, but I used three methods, each checking the others.\"  \"The first?\" shot back the general. The monoplane had landed safely.  \"I compared the records of all the seismographs that had registered the earthquake wave attendant on the electrical discharges accompanying the great yellow auroras of July. These shocks had been felt all over the globe, and I secured reports from Java, New Guinea, Lima, Tucson, Greenwich, Algeria, and Moscow. These showed the wave had originated somewhere in Eastern Labrador.\"  \"Yes, yes. Go on!\" ordered the general.  \"In the second place, the violent magnetic storms produced by the helium aurora appear to have left their mark each time upon the earth in a permanent, if slight, deflection of the compass needle. The earth's normal magnetic field seems to have had superimposed upon it a new field comprised of lines of force nearly parallel to the equator. My computations show that these great circles of magnetism centre at approximately the same point in Labrador as that indicated by the seismographs--about fifty-five degrees north and seventy-five degrees west.\"  The general seemed struck with this.  \"Permanent deflection, you say!\" he ejaculated.  \"Yes, apparently permanent. Finally the barometer records told the same story, although in less precise form. A compressional wave of air had been started in the far north and"]]]
