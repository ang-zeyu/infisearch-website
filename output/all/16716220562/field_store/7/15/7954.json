MOOMOOMON: And then that evening in the golden light I knew the purpose of Earth and why all things are.  XIMENUNG: What is the purpose, Moomoomon?  MOOMOOMON: I know not. I was content. I troubled not to remember.  ZOON: It was love.  XIMENUNG: Let us love.  OTHERS: Aye.  HUZ: Aye, that is best of all.  MELIFLOR: No, Princes. The best is idleness. Out of the idle hours all good things come.  HUZ: I will love. That is best.  MELIFLOR: It is like all things, the gift of the idle hours. The workers never love. Their fancies are fastened to the work they do, and do not roam towards love.  ALL: Love! Let us love.  MELIFLOR: We will love in idleness and praise the idle hours.  XIMENUNG: Whom will you love, lord of the shimmering fields?  MELIFLOR: I have but to show myself loitering by lanes in the evening.  XIMENUNG: I too will be there.  MELIFLOR: And when they see me ...  XIMENUNG: They will see me too ...  MELIFLOR (_rising_): Behold me.  XIMENUNG: So I do.  MELIFLOR: Will they look towards you when this is there?  XIMENUNG: Are birch-trees seen at dawn fairer than I?  MELIFLOR: Behold me; not a poplar is straighter, not a flower is fairer. I will loiter along the lanes at evening.  [_He draws his sword._ XIMENUNG _does the same._ MOOMOOMON _draws his too and places it between them._  MOOMOOMON: Be at peace. _I_ will go to the lanes, and there need be no quarrel between you, for _I_....  OTHERS: No, no, no....  HUZ: We will all go.  ANOTHER: We will all love. Hurrah for love.  [_They have all risen. They wave their swords on high, not threatening each other. Zoon alone has not risen._  MOOMOOMON (_to_ ZOON): You do not speak, Prince of Zoon. Will you not love along the idle hours?  ZOON: Yes, yes. I love.  MOOMOOMON: Come then to the lanes to loiter. It draws towards evening. Let us all come to the lanes, where the honeysuckle is hanging.  ZOON: I love not in the lanes.  MOOMOOMON: Not in the lanes? Then...!  OTHERS: Not in the lanes?  ZOON: I love her than whom there is no greater on earth--(_Some_ PRINCES: Ah!) unless it be that name that frightens Oomuz.  MOOMOOMON: He loves the...!  XIMENUNG: The ...  MELIFLOR: The Queen!  [OOMUZ _nods his head again._  ZOON: The Queen.  MOOMOOMON: If the Queen knew such a thing she would flee from the palace.  ZOON: I would pursue.  MOOMOOMON: She would go by Aether Mountain, where her mother went once before her.  ZOON: I would follow.  HUZ: We would all follow.  MELIFLOR: I would follow too. I would dance after her down the little street: the bright heels of my shoes would twinkle: my cloak would float out behind me: I would pursue her and call her name, beyond the street and over the moor as far as Aether Mountain: but I would not come up with her: that would be _too_ daring.  ZOON: Love is not a toy, Prince Meliflor. Love is no less than a mood of Destiny.  MELIFLOR: Pooh! We must enjoy the idle hours that are for us alone.  ZOON: There will be no idle hours on Aether Mountain, following from crag to crag; if it be true that she would go that way.  MOOMOOMON: It is true. They know it. They say her mother went that way before. It is one of the royal impulses.  ZOON: Oomuz, did the mother of the Queen go once up Aether Mountain?  OOMUZ: Aye, and _her_ mother.  ZOON: It is true.  XIMENUNG: You are sure of this?  OOMUZ: We know it. It has been said.  HUZ: We will all follow her up Aether Mountain.  MELIFLOR: We will follow merrily.  XIMENUNG: If we did this what would they do when we returned?  MELIFLOR: Who?  XIMENUNG: They.  MELIFLOR: They? They would not dare to speak to _us_.  XIMENUNG: Who knows what they would dare if we dared go after the Queen?  MOOMOOMON: They would dare nothing, knowing whence we come.  XIMENUNG: They care not whence we come.  MOOMOOMON: But they care for the event that is in our hands. They dare never touch us because of the event.  MELIFLOR: We are the heirs of the idle hours. For them is work. Surely they dare not leave their work to touch us.  MOOMOOMON: They care only for the event. Because it is prophesied that we are needed for the event we are sacred. Were it not for the event, why ...  MELIFLOR: Were it not for the event we might not dare to do it; but, being sacred, let us enjoy our idle hours.  XIMENUNG: What if the event should one day befall?  MELIFLOR: It was prophesied long ago and has not come. It will not come for a long time.  MOOMOOMON: No, not for a long time.  [_A sentry passes._  MELIFLOR: So we will follow the Queen.  HUZ: Yes, we will follow.  MOOMOOMON: We shall be a merry company.  MELIFLOR: Splendid to see.  ZOON: I would follow though I were not guarded for the event. Though the event should befall and we be immune no longer, still I should dare it.  MELIFLOR: I would dare it if I knew what they would do. But knowing not ...  MOOMOOMON: What matter? We are guarded by the event.  ZOON: I say I care not.  MELIFLOR: Let us drum with our heels and beat with our scabbards against the benches so that we frighten the Queen. She will run from the palace then, and we will go after her with all our merry company.  MOOMOOMON: Yes, let us drum all together. I will give the word. All together and she will run from the palace. We will go after and our cloaks will stream behind us.  HUZ: Brave! And our scabbards will show bright beneath them.  MELIFLOR: No, I will give the word. When she flees from the palace I will follow her first. Crowd not about my cloak as it streams in the wind. We must throw up our heels as we run to make our shoes twinkle. We must show gaily in the little street. Afterwards we can run more easily.  HUZ: Aye, in the street we must run beautifully.  MOOMOOMON: I think that I should give the word when we rattle our scabbards and all drum with our heels; but I waive the point. But I do not think that the Queen can run far. She has never left the palace. How could she run over the moor as far as Aether Mountain. She will faint at the end of the street and we shall come up with her and bow and offer her our assistance.  MELIFLOR: Good, good. It would be cold and rocky on Aether Mountain.  MOOMOOMON: The Queen could never go there over the moor.  HUZ: No, she is too dainty.  XIMENUNG: They say she could.  MELIFLOR: They; what do they know? Common workers. What should they know of queens?  XIMENUNG: They have the old prophesies that came over the fields from the dawn.  MELIFLOR: Yet they cannot understand the Queen.  XIMENUNG: They say her mother went there.  MELIFLOR: That was long ago. Women are quite different now.  XIMENUNG: Well, give the word.  MELIFLOR: Nay. You shall give the word, Moomoomon. When you raise your hand we will all drum with our heels together and rattle our scabbards together, and frighten the Queen.  MOOMOOMON: I honour your courtesy, lord of the deep meadows.  MELIFLOR: We are ready then. When you raise your hand----  [_A gust of laughter is heard off, from a far part of the palace._  MOOMOOMON: Hark! Hark!  MELIFLOR: It is the Queen! She laughed.  HUZ: Could she have guessed...?  MOOMOOMON: I trust not.  MELIFLOR: She--she--cannot have been thinking of _us_.  MOOMOOMON: She--she--seldom laughs.  HUZ: What can it be?  MOOMOOMON: Perhaps it was nothing and yet ...  MELIFLOR: Yet it makes me uneasy.  MOOMOOMON: It is not that I fear, but, when a queen laughs--it makes a feeling in the palace--as though all were not well.  HUZ: It makes one have forebodings. One cannot help it.  MELIFLOR: Perhaps; perhaps later we could return to our gallant scheme; for the present I think I'll hide a while.  MOOMOOMON: Yes, let us hide.  MELIFLOR: So that if there be anything wrong in the palace it will not find us.  [_Exeunt_ MOOMOOMON _and_ MELIFLOR.  HUZ: Let us hide.  [_Exeunt all but_ ZOON _and_ OOMUZ.  [ZOON _has sat always with bent head at table. He sits so, still._  ZOON (_bitterly_): They would follow the Queen.  OOMUZ: Mighty Highness----  ZOON (_still to himself_): They will come back boasting that they dared follow the Queen.  OOMUZ: Mighty Highness.  ZOON: Yes, good Oomuz.  OOMUZ: In other times once princes followed a queen and came back boasting. Master, the workers were angry. Be warned, Master, because you and I went together once to the hoard beyond the marshes. Be warned. They were angry, Master.  ZOON: I care not for the workers.  OOMUZ: Master, be warned. It was long ago and they say they were very angry.  ZOON: I care not, Oomuz. I come not boasting back from the hills under Aether Mountain. I shall not halt till I have told the Queen my love. I shall wed with her who is less only than Fate, if less she be. I am not as those, Oomuz. Who weds the Queen is more than the servant of Fate.  OOMUZ: Master----  [_He stretches out his hands towards_ ZOON _imploringly._  ZOON: Well, Oomuz?  OOMUZ: Master. There is a doom about the Queen.  ZOON: What doom, Oomuz?  OOMUZ: We know not, Master. We are simple people and we know not that. But we know from of old there is a doom about her. We know it, Master; we have been told from of old.  ZOON: Yes, there could well be a doom about the Queen.  OOMUZ: Follow not after, Master, when she goes to Aether Mountain. There is surely a doom about her. A doom was with her mother upon that very peak.  ZOON: Yes, Oomuz, a doom well becomes her.  OOMUZ: Doubt it not, Master; there is a doom about her.  ZOON: Oomuz, I doubt not. For there is something wonderful about the Queen, beyond all earthly wonders. Something like thunder beyond far clouds or hail hurling from heaven; there should be indeed a terrible doom about her.  OOMUZ: Master, I have warned you for the sake of the days when we raided the golden hoard beyond the marshes.  ZOON (_taking his hand_): Thank you, good Oomuz.  [_He goes towards door after the others._  OOMUZ: But where go you, Master?  ZOON: I wait to follow the Queen when she goes to Aether Mountain.  [_Exit._ OOMUZ _weeps silently on to the Queen's Treasure._  CURTAIN.

LADY OOZIZI: Lady, none.  [_The_ QUEEN _sighs._  You should not sigh, great lady.  QUEEN: Why should I not sigh, Oozizi?  OOZIZI: Great lady, because such things as sighs pertain only to love.  QUEEN: Love is a joy, Oozizi; love is a glow. Love makes them dance so lightly along rays of the sunlight. It is made of sunlight and gladness. It is like flowers in twilight. How should they sigh?  OOZIZI: Lady! Great lady! Say not such things of love!  QUEEN: Say not such things, Oozizi? Are they not true?  OOZIZI: True? Yes, great lady, true. But love is a toy of the humble; love is a common thing that the lowly use; love is ... Great lady, had any overheard you speaking then they might have thought, they might have madly dreamed ...  QUEEN: Dreamed what, Oozizi?  OOZIZI: Incredible things.  QUEEN (_meditatively_): I must not love, Oozizi.  OOZIZI: Lady! The common people love.  [_She points to door._  Lady, the green fields going from here to the blueness, and bending towards it, and going wandering on, and the rivers they meet and the woods that shade the rivers, all own you for their sovereign. Lady, a million lime-trees mellow your realm. The golden hoards are yours. Yours are the deep fields and the iris marshes. Yours are the roads of wandering and all ways home. The common delights of love your mere soldiers know. Lady, you may not love.  [_The_ QUEEN _sighs._ OOZIZI _continues her knitting._  QUEEN: My mother loved, Oozizi.  OOZIZI: Lady, for a day. For one day, mighty lady, As one might stoop in idleness to a broken toy and pick it up and throw it again away, so she loved for a day. That idle fancy of an afternoon tarnished no pinnacle that shone from her exalted station. But to love for more than a day--(QUEEN'S _face lights up_)--that were to place your high unequalled glory below a vulgar pastime. One alone may sit in the golden palace to reign over the green fields; but all may love.  QUEEN: Do all love but I, Oozizi?  OOZIZI: Wondrous many, lady.  QUEEN: How know you, Oozizi?  OOZIZI: The common shouts that come up at evening, the clamour of the lanes; they are but from love.  QUEEN: What is love, Oozizi?  OOZIZI: Love is a foolish thing.  QUEEN: How know you, Oozizi?  OOZIZI: They came tittering to me once; but I saw the foolishness of it.  QUEEN (_a little sadly_): And they came no more?  OOZIZI (_a little sadly too_): No more.  [_Both look thoughtfully out into dreams, the_ QUEEN _on her throne, chin on hand._  [_Suddenly a stir is heard from the Hall of the Hundred Princes._  QUEEN (_alarmed_): Hark! What was that?  OOZIZI (_rises, listening anxiously_): It sounded ... to come from the Hall ... of the Hundred Princes.  QUEEN: They were never heard here before.  OOZIZI: Lady, never.  QUEEN (_anxiously_): What can it mean?  OOZIZI: I know not, lady.  QUEEN: Sound never troubled our inner chamber before.  OOZIZI: All is quiet now.  QUEEN: Hark! (_They listen._)  OOZIZI: All is quiet.  QUEEN: Sound from beyond our wall, Oozizi. How it disturbs. I could not rule over the green fields if sounds came up to me from the further halls full of their strange thoughts. Why do sounds come to me, Oozizi?  OOZIZI: Great lady, it has never been before. It will never be again. You must forget it, lady. You must not let it disturb your reign.  QUEEN: It brought strange thoughts with it, Oozizi.  OOZIZI: All is quiet now.  QUEEN: If it came again....  OOZIZI: Lady, it will not come again. It will come no more. It is quiet.  QUEEN: If it came again ... Is the door open, Oozizi? Yes ... If it came again I should almost flee from the palace.  OOZIZI: Lady! Think not of leaving the golden palace!  QUEEN: If it came again.  OOZIZI: It will not come again.  [_The heels of the Princes drum louder, off._  QUEEN: Again, Oozizi:  [OOZIZI _pants._ _The_ QUEEN _waits, listening, in fear. Again the heels are heard._  [_The_ QUEEN _runs to the small door. She looks out._  OOZIZI: Lady! Lady!  QUEEN: Oozizi.  OOZIZI: Lady! Lady! You must never leave the palace. You must never leave it. You must not.  QUEEN: Hark, it is quiet now.  OOZIZI: Lady, it would be terrible to leave the golden palace. Who would reign? What would happen?  QUEEN: It is quiet now. What would happen, Oozizi?  OOZIZI: The world would end.  QUEEN: It is quiet now; perhaps I need not fly.  OOZIZI: Lady, you must not.  QUEEN: And yet I would fain go over those green fields all gleaming with summer, and see the golden hoards that no man guards, glittering with such a light as glows this June.  OOZIZI: O, speak not, great lady, of the green fields and June. It is these that have intoxicated the Princes so that they do this unrecorded thing, letting sound of them be heard in your sacred room.  QUEEN: Has June intoxicated them, Oozizi?  OOZIZI: Oh, lady, speak not of June.  QUEEN: Is June so terrible?  [_She returns towards_ OOZIZI.  OOZIZI: It does strange things.  [_The noise breaks out again._  Hark!  [_The_ QUEEN _runs to the door again._ OOZIZI _stretches out her arms to the_ QUEEN.  O, lady, never leave the golden palace.  [_The_ QUEEN _listens; all is silent; she looks outside._  QUEEN: I see the green fields gleaming. Strange flowers are standing among them, like princes I have not known.  OOZIZI: Oh, lady, speak not of the bewildering fields. They are all enchanted with Summer, and they have maddened the Princes. It is dangerous to look at them, lady.  [_The_ QUEEN _gazes on over the fields._  And yet you look.  QUEEN: I would fain go far over the strange soft fields; far and far to the high heathery lands----  OOZIZI: Lady, all is quiet; there is no danger; you must not leave the palace.  QUEEN: Yes, all is quiet.  [_The_ QUEEN _returns._  OOZIZI: It was a passing madness seized the Princes.  QUEEN: Oozizi, when I hear the sound of all their feet it is dreadful, and I must fly. And when I see the wonderful fields in the sunlight sloping away to lands I have never known, then I long to fly away and away for ever, passing from field to field and land to land.  OOZIZI: Lady, no, no!  QUEEN: Oozizi.  OOZIZI: Yes, great lady.  QUEEN: There is a mountain there that towers above the earth. It goes up into a calm of which our world knows nothing. Heaven, like a cloak, is draped about its shoulders. Why have none told me of this mountain, Oozizi?  OOZIZI (_awed_): Aether Mountain.  QUEEN: Why has none told me?  OOZIZI: When your glorious mother, lady, loved for a day ...  QUEEN: Yes, Oozizi ...  OOZIZI: She went, as all songs tell, to Aether Mountain.  QUEEN (_entranced_): To Aether Mountain?  OOZIZI: So they sing at evening, when they throw down their loads of gold and rest.  QUEEN: To Aether Mountain.  OOZIZI: Lady, Destiny sent her; but you must not go. You must not leave your throne to go to Aether Mountain.  QUEEN: There is a calm upon it not of earth.  OOZIZI: You must not go, lady, you must not go.  QUEEN: I will not go.  [_The Princes drum again, still louder with their heels._  Hark!  [OOZIZI _is frightened, The_ QUEEN _runs to the door._  It is louder! They are nearer! They are coming here!  OOZIZI: No, lady. They would not dare!  QUEEN: I must go, Oozizi; I must go.  OOZIZI: No, lady. They will never dare. You must not. Hark! They come no nearer. June has maddened them, but they come no nearer. They are quiet now. Come back, lady. Leave the door, they come no nearer. See, it is all quiet now. They come no nearer, lady. (OOZIZI _catches her by the sleeve._) Lady, you must not.  QUEEN (_much calmer, gazing away_): Oozizi, I must go.  OOZIZI: No, no, lady! All is quiet; you must not go.  QUEEN (_calmly_): It is calling for me, Oozizi.  OOZIZI: What is calling, lady? Nothing calls.  QUEEN: It is calling, Oozizi.  OOZIZI: Oh, lady, all is silent. No one calls.  QUEEN: It is calling for me now, Oozizi.  OOZIZI: No, no, lady. What calls?  QUEEN: Aether Mountain is calling. I know now who called my mother. It was Aether Mountain, Oozizi; he is calling.  OOZIZI: I--I scarce dare look out of the golden palace, lady, to where we must not go. Yet, yet I will look. (_She peers._) Yes, yes, indeed; there stands old Aether Mountain. But he does not call. Indeed he does not call. He is all silent in Heaven.  QUEEN: It is his voice, Oozizi.  OOZIZI: What, lady? I hear no voice.  QUEEN: That great, great silence is his voice, Oozizi. He is calling me out of that blue waste of Heaven.  OOZIZI: Lady, I cannot understand.  QUEEN: He calls, Oozizi.  OOZIZI: Come away, lady. It is bad to look so long. Oh, if the Princes had not made their clamour heard! Oh, if they had not you had not gone to the door and seen Aether Mountain, and this trouble had not come. Oh! Oh! Oh!  QUEEN: There is no trouble upon Aether Mountain.  OOZIZI: Oh, lady, it is terrible that you should leave the palace.  QUEEN: There is no trouble there. Aether Mountain goes all calm into Heaven. His grey-blue slopes are calm as the sky about him. There he stands calling. He is calling to me, Oozizi.  OOZIZI (_reflecting_): Can it be?  QUEEN: What would you ask, Oozizi?  Oozizi: Can it be that it is with you, great lady, as it was with the Queen, your mother, when Destiny sent her hence to Aether Mountain?  QUEEN: Aether Mountain calls.  OOZIZI: Lady, for a moment hear me. Come with me but a little while.  [_She leads the_ QUEEN _slowly by the arm back to the throne._  Lady, be seated here once more and take up the orb and sceptre in your small hands as of old.  [_The_ QUEEN _patiently does as she is told._  Now, if Destiny calls you, let him call to you as to a Queen. Now, if it be for no whim of those that pass, that you would go so far from here to that great mountain, say, seated upon your throne in the golden palace with sceptre and orb in hand, say would you go forth, lady?  QUEEN (_almost dreaming_): Aether Mountain calls.  [OOZIZI _bursts into tears. She"]]]
