VII  The Boy lost his skin but grew another and incidentally absorbed some ideas he never forgot.  On the day he was able to put on his clothes, it poured down rain and work in the fields was impossible. A sense of delicious joy filled him. He worked because he had to, not because he liked it. He was too proud to shirk, too brave to cry when every nerve and muscle of his little body ached with mortal weariness, but he hated it.  The sun rose bright and warm and shone clear in the Southern sky next morning before he was called. He climbed down the ladder from his loft wondering what marvellous thing had happened that he should be sleeping with the sun already high in the heavens.  \"What's the matter, Ma?\" he asked anxiously. \"Why didn't you call me?\"  \"It's too wet to plow. Your father's going to chop wood in the clearing. He wanted you to pile brush after him, but I asked him to let you off to go fishing for me.\"  He ate breakfast with his heart beating a tattoo, rushed into the garden, dug a gourd full of worms, drew his long cane rod from the eaves of the cabin, and with old Boney trotting at his heels was soon on his way to a deep pool in the bend of the creek.  Fishing for _her_! His mother understood. He wondered why he had ever been fool enough to disobey her that Sunday. He could die for her without a moment's hesitation.  It was glorious to have this marvellous day of spring all his own. The birds were singing on every field and hedge. The trees flashed their polished new leaves. The sweet languor of the South was in the air and he drew it in with deep breaths that sent the joy of life tingling through every vein.  Four joyous hours flew on tireless wings. He had caught five catfish and a big eel--more than enough for a good meal for the whole family.  He held them up proudly. How his mother's eyes would sparkle! He could see Sarah's admiring gaze and hear his father's good-natured approval.  He had just struck the path for home when the forlorn figure of a rough bearded man came limping to meet him.  He stepped aside in the grass to let him pass. But the man stopped and gazed at the fish.  \"My, my, Sonny, but you've got a fine string there!\" he exclaimed.  \"Pretty good for one day,\" the Boy proudly answered.  \"An' just ter think I ain't had nothin' ter eat in 'most two days.\"  \"Don't you live nowhere?\" the youngster asked in surprise.  \"I used ter have a home afore the war, but my folks thought I wuz dead an' moved away. I'm tryin' ter find 'em. Hit's a hard job with a Britisher's bullet still a-pinchin' me in the leg.\"  \"Did you fight with General Washington?\"  \"Lordy, no, I ain't that old, ef I do look like a scarecrow. No, I fit under Old Hickory at New Orleans. I tell ye, Sonny, them Britishers burnt out Washington fur us but we give 'em a taste o' fire at New Orleans they ain't goin' ter fergit.\"  \"Did we lick 'em good?\"  \"Boy, ye ain't never heard tell er sich a scrimmage--we thrashed 'em till they warn't no fight in 'em, an' they scrambled back aboard them ships an' skeddaddled home. Britishers can't fight nohow. We've licked 'em twice an' we kin lick 'em agin. But the old soldier that does the fightin'--everybody fergits him!\"  The Boy looked longingly at his string of fish for a moment with the pride of his heart, and then held up his treasure.  \"You can have my fish if ye want 'em; they'll make you a nice supper.\"  The old soldier stroked the tangled hair and took his string of fish.  \"You're a fine boy! I won't fergit you, Sonny!\"  The words comforted him until he neared the house. And then a sense of bitter loss welled up in spite of all.  \"Did I do right, Ma?\" he asked wistfully.  She placed her hand on his forehead:  \"Yes--I'm proud of you. I know what that gift cost a boy's heart. It was big because it was all you had and the pride of your soul was in it.\"  The sense of loss was gone and he was rich and happy again.  When the supper was over and they sat before the flickering firelight he asked her a question over which his mind had puzzled since he left the old soldier.  \"Why is it,\" he said thoughtfully, \"British soldiers can't fight?\"  The mother smiled:  \"Who said they couldn't fight?\"  \"The old soldier I gave my fish to. He said we just made hash out o' them. We've licked 'em twice and we can do it again!\"  The last sentence he didn't quote. He gave it as a personal opinion based on established facts.  \"We didn't win because the British couldn't fight,\" the mother gravely responded.  \"Then why?\" he persisted.  \"The Lord was good to us.\"  \"How?\"  The question came with an accent of indignation. Sometimes he couldn't help getting cross with his mother when she began to give the Lord credit for everything. If the Lord did it all why should he give his string of fish to an old soldier!  The grey eyes looked into his with wistful tenderness. She had been shocked once before by the fear that there was something in this child's eternal why that would keep him out of the church. The one deep desire of her heart was that he should be good.  \"Would you like to hear,\" she began softly, \"something about the Revolution which my old school teacher told me in Virginia?\"  \"Yes, tell me!\" he answered eagerly.  \"He said that we could never have won our independence but for God. We didn't win because British soldiers couldn't fight. We held out for ten years because we outran them. We ran quicker, covered more ground, got further into the woods and stayed there longer than any fighters the British had ever met before. That's why we got the best of them. Our men who fought and ran away lived to fight another day. General Washington was always great in retreat. He never fought unless he was ready and could choose his own field. He waited until his enemies were in snug quarters drinking and gambling, and then on a dark night, so dark and cold that some of his own men would freeze to death, he pushed across a river, fell on them, cut them to pieces and retreated.  \"The number of men he commanded was so small he could not face his foes in the open if he could avoid it. His men were poorly armed, poorly drilled, half-clothed and half-starved at times. The British troops were the best drilled and finest fighting men of the world in their day, armed with good guns, well fed, well clothed, and well paid.\"  She paused and smiled at the memory of her teacher's narrative.  \"What do you suppose happened on one of our battlefields?\"  \"I dunno--what?\"  \"When the Red-coats charged, our boys ran at the first crack of a gun. They ran so well that they all got away except one little fellow who had a game leg. He stumbled and fell in a hole. A big British soldier raised a musket to brain him. The little fellow looked up and cried: 'All right. Kill away, ding ye--ye won't get much!'  \"The Britisher laughed, picked him up, brushed his clothes and told him to go home.\"  The Boy laughed again and again.  \"He was a spunky one anyhow, wasn't he?\"  \"Yes,\" the mother nodded, \"that's why the Red-coat let him go. And we never could have endured if God hadn't inspired one man to hold fast when other hearts had failed.\"  \"And who was he?\" the Boy broke in.  \"General Washington. At Valley Forge our cause was lost but for him. Our men were not paid. They could get no clothes, they were freezing and starving. They quit and went home in hundreds and gave up in despair. And then, Boy----\"  Her voice dropped to a tense whisper:  \"General Washington fell on his knees and prayed until he saw the shining face of God and got his answer. Next day he called his ragged, hungry men together and said:  \"'Soldiers, though all my armies desert, the war shall go on. If I must, I'll gather my faithful followers in Virginia, retreat to the mountains and fight until our country is free!'  \"His words cheered the despairing men and they stood by him. We were saved at last because help came in time. Lord Cornwallis had laid the South in ashes, and camped at Yorktown, his army of veterans laden with spoils. He was only waiting for the transports from New York to take his victorious men North, join the army there and end the war, and then----\"  She drew a deep breath and her eyes sparkled:  \"And then, Boy, it happened--the miracle! Into the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, three big ships dropped anchor at the mouth of the York River. Our people on the shore thought they were the transports and that the end had come. But the ships were too far away to make out their flags, and so they sent swift couriers across the Peninsula, to see if there were any signs in the roadstead at Hampton. There--Glory to God! lay a great fleet flying the flag of France. The French had loaned us twenty millions of dollars, and sent their navy and their army to help us. Had the Lord sent down a host from the sky we couldn't have been more surprised. They landed, joined with General Washington's ragged men, and closed in on Cornwallis. Surprised and trapped he surrendered and we won.  \"But there never was a year before that, my Boy, that we were strong enough to resist the British army had the mother country sent a real general here to command her troops.\"  \"Why didn't she?\" the Boy interrupted.  Again the mother's voice dropped low:  \"Because God wouldn't let her--that's the only reason. If Lord Clive had ever landed on our shores, Washington might now be sleeping in a traitor's grave.\"  The voice again became soft and dreamy--almost inaudible.  \"And he didn't come?\" the Boy whispered.  \"No. On the day he was to sail he put the papers in his pocket, went into his room, locked the door and blew his own brains out. This is God's country, my son. He gave us freedom. He has great plans for us.\"  The fire flickered low and the Boy's eyes glowed with a strange intensity.   VIII  A barbecue, with political speaking, was held at the village ten miles away. The family started at sunrise. The day was an event in the lives of every man, woman and child within"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19135"],["title","The Southerner: A Romance of the Real Lincoln (#6)"],["body"," radius of twenty miles. Many came as far as thirty miles and walked the whole distance. Before nine o'clock a crowd of two thousand had gathered.  The dark, lithe young mother who led her boy by the hand down the crowded aisle of the improvised brush arbor that day performed a deed which was destined to change the history of the world.  The speaker who held the crowd spellbound for two hours was Henry Clay. The Boy not only heard an eloquent orator. His spirit entered for all time into fellowship with a great human soul.  In words that throbbed with passion, he pictured the coming glory of a mighty nation whose shores would be washed by two oceans, whose wealth and manhood would be the hope and inspiration of the world. Never before had words been given such wings. The ringing tones found the Boy's soul and set his brain on fire. A big idea was born within his breast. This was his country. His feet pressed its soil. Its hills and plains, its rivers and seas were his. His hands would help to build this vision of a great spirit into the living thing. He breathed softly and his eyes sparkled. When the crowd cheered, he leaped to his feet, swung his little cap into the air and shouted with all his might. When the last glowing picture of the peroration faded into a silence that could be felt, and the tumult had died away, he saw men and women crowding around the orator to shake his hand.  \"Take me, Ma!\" he whispered. \"I want to see him close!\"  The mother lifted him in her arms above the crowd, pressed forward, and the Boy's shining eyes caught those of the brilliant statesman. Over the heads of the men by his side the orator extended his hand and grasped the trembling outstretched fingers.  He smiled and nodded, that was all. The Boy understood. From that moment he had an ideal leader whose words were inspired.  The mother's dark face was lit for a moment with tender pride. She made no effort to reach the orator's side. It was enough that she had seen the flash from her Boy's eyes. She was content. The day was filled with a great joy.  The summer camp meetings began the following week. The grounds were located a mile from the straggling little village which was the center of the county's activities. All religious denominations used the spacious auditorium for their services. The Methodists camped there an entire month. The Baptists stayed but two weeks. The Baptist temperament frowned on the social frivolities which were inseparable from these long intimate associations at close quarters. The more volatile temperament of the Methodists revelled in them, and Methodism grew with astounding rapidity under the system.  The auditorium was simply a huge quadrangular shed with board roof uphold by cedar posts. At one end of the shed stood the platform on which was built the pulpit, a square box-like structure about four feet high. The seats were made of rough-hewn half logs set on pegs driven in augur holes. There were no backs to them. A single wide aisle led from the end facing the pulpit, and two narrow ones intersected the main aisle at the centre.  In front of the pulpit were placed the mourner's benches facing the three sides of the space left for the free movement of the mourners under the stress of religious emotion.  The Boy's mother and father were devout members of the Baptist Church, but they were not demonstrative. They modestly and reverently took their seats in an inconspicuous position about midway the building, entering from one of the small aisles on the side. The Boy had often been to a regular church service before, but this was his first camp meeting.  Four preachers sat in grim silence behind the pulpit's solid box front. The Boy could just see the tops of their heads over the board that held the big gilt-edged Bible.  The entire first two days and nights were given to a series of terrific sermons on Death, Hell, and the Judgment, with a brief glimpse of the pearly gates of Heaven and a few strains from the golden harps inside for the damned to hear by way of contrast. The first purpose of the preachers was to arouse a deep under-current of religious emotional excitement that at the proper moment would explode and sweep the crowd with resistless fire. Usually the fuse was timed to explode on the morning of the third day. Sometimes, when sermons of extraordinary power had followed each other in rapid succession, the fire broke out by a sort of spontaneous combustion on the night of the second day.  It did so this time. The mother had no trouble in keeping the Boy by her side through these first two days. He felt instinctively the growing emotional tension about him, and knew in his bones that something would break loose soon. He was keyed to a high pitch of interest to see just what it would be like.  The storm broke in the middle of the second sermon on the second night. The preacher had worked himself into a frenzy of emotional excitement. His arms were waving over his head, his eyes blazing, his feet stamping, his voice screaming in anguish as he described the agony of a soul lost forever in the seething cauldron of eternal hell fire!  A tremulous startled moan, half-wail, half-scream came from a girl just in front of the Boy, as she dropped her head in her hands.  \"What's the matter with her?\" he whispered. \"Has she got a pain?\"  His mother pressed his hand:  \"Sh!\"  And then the storm broke. From every direction came the startled cries of long pent terror and anguish. The girl staggered to her feet and started stumbling down the aisle to the mourners' bench without invitation, and from every row of seats they tumbled, crowding on her heels, sobbing, wailing, screaming, groaning.  The preacher ceased to talk and, in a high tremulous voice, that rang through the excited crowd as the peal of the Archangel's trumpet, began to sing:      \"Come humble sinners in whose breasts     A thousand thoughts revolve!\"  The crowd rose instinctively and all who were not mourning, joined in the half-savage, terror-stricken wail of the song. The sinners that hadn't given up at the first break of the storm could not resist the thrill of this wild music. One by one they pushed their way through the crowd, found the aisle and staggered blindly to the front.  The Boy noticed curiously that it seemed to be the rule for them to completely cover their streaming eyes with a handkerchief or with the bare hands and go it blindly for the mourners' benches. If they missed the way and butted into anything, a church member kindly took them by the arm and guided them to a vacant place where they dropped on their knees.  The Boy had leaped on the bench and stood beside his mother to get a better view of the turmoil. He couldn't keep his eyes off a tall, red-headed, thick-bearded man just across the aisle three rows behind who kept twitching his face, looking toward the door and struggling against the impulse to follow the mourners. Presently he broke down with a loud cry:  \"Lord, have mercy!\"  He placed his hands over his face and started on a run to the front.  The Boy giggled, and his mother pinched him.  \"Did ye see that red-headed feller, Ma,\" he whispered. \"He didn't do fair. He peeked through his fingers--I saw his eyes!\"  \"Sh!\"  The preachers had come down from the pulpit now and stood over the wailing prostrated mourners and exhorted them to repent and believe before it was forever and eternally too late. Three of them were talking at the same time to different groups of mourners. The louder they exhorted the louder the sinners cried. The fourth preacher walked down the aisle searching for those who were yet hardening their hearts and stiffening their necks. He paused beside a prim little old maid who had lately arrived from Tidewater Virginia. Her bright eyes were dry.  \"Dear lady, are you a child of God?\" the preacher cried.  The prim figured stiffened indignantly:  \"No, sir! I'm an Episcopalian!\"  The preacher groaned and passed on and the Boy stuffed his fist in his mouth.  For half an hour the roar of the conflict was incessant, and its violence indescribable. It was broken now and then by a kindly soul among the elderly women raising a sweet old-fashioned hymn.  Suddenly an exhorter threw his hands above his head and, in a voice that soared above the roar of mourners and their attendants, cried:  \"Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world!\"  Quick as a flash came an answering shout from the red-headed man who leaped to his feet and with wide staring eyes looked up at the roof.  \"I see him! I see Jesus up a tree!\"  A fat woman lifted her head and shouted:  \"Hold him till I get there!\"  And she started for the red-headed man. There was a single moment of strange silence and the Boy laughed aloud.  His mother caught and shook him violently. He crammed his little fist again into his mouth, but the stopper wouldn't hold.  He dropped to his seat to keep the people from seeing him, buried his face in his hands and laughed in smothered giggles in spite of all his mother could do.  At last he whispered:  \"Take me out quick! I'm goin' to bust--I'll bust wide open I tell ye!\"  She rose sternly, seized his arm and led him a half mile into the woods. He kept looking back and laughing softly.  She gazed at him sorrowfully:  \"I'm ashamed of you, Boy! How could you do such a thing!\"  \"I just couldn't help it!\"  He sat down on a stone and laughed again.  \"What makes the fools holler so?\" he asked through his tears.  \"They are praying God to forgive their sins.\"  \"But why holler so loud? He ain't deaf--is He? You said that God's in the sun and wind and dew and rain--in the breath we breathe. Ain't He everywhere then? Why do they holler at Him?\"  The mother turned away to hide a smile she couldn't keep back, and a cloud overspread her dark face. Surely this was an evil sign--this spirit of irreverent levity in the mind of a child so young. What could it mean? She had forgotten that she had been teaching him to"]]]
