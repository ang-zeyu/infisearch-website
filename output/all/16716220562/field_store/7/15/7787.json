The Guardian thinks that although this cannot be considered as constituting an obligation which a believer can impose upon the national body, yet, it would seem highly advisable that the N.S.A. should give a sympathetic consideration to any such request made to it by a believer. This, he feels, would avoid giving the impression that the assembly is working in an atmosphere of complete secrecy, and that it is motivated by dictatorial motives. The final decision in such matters; however, is entirely left to the discretion of the N.S.A. The basic principle that should always be remembered is that the N.S.A. cannot be required to reveal to any outsider all the details concerning its work. It may choose to do so if it wishes, but nobody has the right to enforce upon it any such action: This is, of course the purely legal side of the question. But a purely legalistic attitude in matters affecting the Cause, particularly now that the Faith is still in a state of infancy, is not only inadequate but fraught with unforeseen dangers and difficulties. The individuals and assemblies must learn to cooperate and to cooperate intelligently, if they desire to adequately discharge their duties and obligations towards the Faith. And no such cooperation is possible without mutual confidence and trust.  With loving greetings from the Guardian to you and to the members of the N.S.A. and with the assurance of his prayers on behalf of you all,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dear and valued co-worker:  I cannot refrain from expressing in person my deep sense of gratitude and indebtedness to the beloved co-workers in that land for their splendid achievements in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity. I feel truly proud of your accomplishments. I will continue to supplicate for every one of you the Beloved’s imperishable blessings.  Rest assured and persevere. Shoghi.      LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 26TH, 1935   September 26th, 1935.  Beloved Bahá’í co-worker,  On behalf of the Guardian I wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th of July last, with the enclosed copy of the minutes of the N.S.A. of the Bahá’ís of Australia and New-Zealand. I wish, in particular, to express his gratification at the news of the success of the last meeting of your N.S.A. held in Sydney. It gives him, indeed, much pleasure and encouragement to realize that your Assembly meetings are conducted with such a good deal of order and efficiency, and above all, in such a perfect spirit of unity and fellowship—the few other obstacles and difficulties left, he feels confident, will in due time disappear. The foundation has been now firmly laid down, and the work is bound to develop and expand. The friends should, therefore, be confident, and should exert their utmost that the institutions they have so painstakingly and laboriously established should flourish and yield their fruit.  In connection with the N.S.A.’s decision regarding the appointment of Mrs. Axford and Mr. Inman to keep records of Australian and New-Zealand activities for the “Bahá’í World”; the Guardian wishes you to assure your fellow-members in the assembly that he fully endorses their choice. He also wishes you to impress the newly-appointed correspondents with the vital importance of their task, and to urge them to acquit themselves of it with thoroughness, efficiency and vigour.  Regarding dear Mr. Hyde Dunn’s health; Shoghi Effendi is grieved beyond words to learn that he is growing so weak physically. Will you kindly assure him, as well as Mrs. Dunn, of his supplications for the amelioration of his health and for the complete restoration of his forces.  In closing will you also convey his love and greetings to the members of the N.S.A. and assure them once more of his continued prayers for their welfare, protection and guidance,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dear and valued co-worker:  The detailed report of the activities of the national assembly—the furthermost pillar of the Universal House of Justice which the high endeavours of the believers of Australia and New-Zealand have reared—has filled my heart and soul with immense joy and gratitude. The Beloved is surely watching over and continually blessing your splendid accomplishments, the plans you have conceived, the methods you have devised, the efforts you are exerting, the services which you have rendered. I will continue to pray for the consolidation and uninterrupted expansion of your laudable activities in the service of so glorious and mighty a Cause. Never relax nor despair. The tender plant which your hands have raised and nurtured shall grow and will ultimately gather beneath its shadow the whole of that far-off and promising continent.  Persevere and be happy. Shoghi.      LETTER OF JANUARY 3RD, 1936   January 3rd, 1936.  The N.S.A. of the Bahá’ís of Australia and New-Zealand  Dear Bahá’í Friends,  Miss Effie Baker is leaving for Australia with the consent and full approval of the Guardian.  As you know for over ten years she has been devotedly working for the Cause in Haifa, as keeper of the Western Pilgrim House and also as the custodian of the International Bahá’í Archives. During this long period of service she has accomplished much for our beloved Cause, and she is now in need of some rest after so many years of strenuous labours. She is going to join her mother, and will, it is hoped, prove of great help to the friends throughout Australia and New-Zealand in both their teaching and administrative activities.  The Guardian hopes, therefore, that the friends will give her all the opportunity she needs to help in the extension and consolidation of the Cause throughout Australia and New-Zealand.  He is entrusting Miss Baker with a beautiful and most precious present for the friends; it is one of the finest photographs of the Master which, he wishes your N.S.A. to place in your National Bahá’í Archives. He is, in addition, sending through her for the believers a bottle of attar of rose extracted by the friends in Persia.  With loving greetings and all good wishes for a most happy and prosperous New Year.  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.      LETTER OF APRIL 15TH, 1936   April 15th, 1936  Dear Miss Brooks,  On behalf of the Guardian I acknowledge with thanks and appreciation the receipt of your letter of March 12th with enclosure. He is grateful for the warm assistance extended by your N.S.A. to Miss Effie Baker, and hopes that she will be of valuable assistance to you all, specially to the friends in Melbourne. The task of organizing the believers in that center is no doubt a very responsible one, and the Guardian trusts that she will be able to fully acquit herself of it.  Regarding the “Herald of the South” magazine, Shoghi Effendi very much appreciates the fact that in spite of the many difficulties that your Assembly had to overcome this review is being regularly published, and that its standard is gradually improving. He would call upon all the English-speaking friends to contribute, as often as they can, such articles for publication in that magazine as would serve to make it a more direct and effective teaching medium for the spread of the Cause throughout Australia and New-Zealand. He is advising the American N.S.A. to specially ask the cooperation of the American believers for that purpose, and hopes that the response they will make to this call will be such as to further encourage you in your splendid efforts for the publication of this national organ of the Faith in Australia.  The Guardian would appreciate receiving detailed reports of the activities of the local assemblies, and would be very thankful if you send these to him as regularly as you can.  In closing may I ask you to convey his loving greetings to your distinguished fellow-members in the N.S.A. and to assure each and all of them of his supplications for their welfare and guidance. He also wishes you to express his best wishes to dear Father and Mrs. Dunn, and tell them how happy he is to learn that they are keeping in good health.  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dear and valued co-worker:  I am so glad to have received your letter and to have realised the progress of your activities. I trust and pray that the work in which the National Assembly is so energetically and devotedly engaged may steadily expand and be further consolidated. The teaching work is the corner-stone of its activities, the sole basis on which the administrative structure can flourish. A strenuous, systematic and continuous effort should, both individually and collectively, be now exerted to attain this supreme objective. With a heart full of gratitude I will pray for the success of your endeavours.  Shoghi.      LETTER OF APRIL 26TH, 1936   April 26th, 1936  Beloved Bahá’í Sister,  I am directed by the Guardian to thank you for your letter of the 30th March informing him of the date of Miss Kitty Carpenter’s arrival in Port-Said. You can be sure that the friends will be most delighted to meet her, and to render her journey to Haifa as safe and comfortable as possible.  The Guardian himself is eagerly looking forward to the pleasure of meeting her, and cherishes the hope that through this pilgrimage she may receive a renewed stimulus to better work for the promotion of the Faith upon her return home.  The Guardian has also noted with deep satisfaction the preparations made by your N.S.A. for this year’s meeting in Melbourne. He is praying that in spite of the difficulties you have encountered in carrying out your plans this important gathering of the Australian and New-Zealand believers may prove another landmark in the history of the Cause throughout that Continent.  With loving greetings to you and your dear fellow-members,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.

Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi.      LETTER OF JUNE 10TH, 1936   June 10th, 1936  Dear Miss Brooks,  I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge with deepest thanks the receipt of your letter of March 30th written on behalf of the N.S.A. of Australia and New-Zealand.  He is rejoiced to learn of the projected formation of a Spiritual Assembly in Perth, and hopes that by the time this letter reaches you the assembly will have been duly constituted and will be functioning with the utmost unity, efficiency and vigour.  In this connection he wishes me to bring to your Assembly’s attention the necessity of their taking the necessary steps for the incorporation of the N.S.A.. This step, he feels, is of a vital importance to the further development of your Assembly, and will no doubt give it more stability and an added influence, specially in the eyes of the general public.  The Guardian would also advise that the local assemblies take a similar step, and obtain official recognition from the authorities. In case the Auckland assembly has been registered in the government, will you be so kind as to send him photostatic reproductions of any registration papers or documents that the Auckland friends may have obtained from the authorities, as he wishes to have them published in the next “Bahá’í World”.  As regards the photograph of your N.S.A; the Guardian wishes me to inform you that in going over the manuscript of the “Bahá’í World”, which was sent to him from the States, he found your Assembly’s picture already incorporated in it. The manuscript has now been sent back to America and is awaiting publication.  With loving Bahá’í greetings, Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dear and valued co-worker:  The incessant efforts so devotedly exerted by the members of your distinguished assembly are assets that I greatly value and of which I am truly proud. I will fervently pray for the extension of your activities and the fulfilment of your dearest hopes. Rest assured and persevere.  Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi.      LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 23RD, 1936   September 23rd, 1936  Dear Miss Brooks,  Your detailed communication of July 14th written on behalf of the N.S.A. of Australia and New-Zealand, together with its enclosures have all duly arrived, and their contents read with deepest interest and appreciation by our beloved Guardian. Also the photographs and blocks have duly reached him, as well as the local Assembly reports sent under separate cover. Please accept his most sincere and grateful thanks for them all.  Regarding the proposed News Letter to be issued every three months by your N.S.A; this, the Guardian feels, is a splendid idea and can render a unique and much-needed help to your Assembly in its efforts for the establishment of the Administration, and the more effective functioning of its institutions throughout Australia and New-Zealand. Not only it has the great advantage of keeping the friends well-informed about the events and developments in the Cause, but in addition can help in consolidating the organic unity of the believers by bringing them within the full orbit of the N.S.A.’s jurisdiction. It is hoped that this body will do its utmost to maintain the publication of this bulletin, and will make full use of this splendid medium for the further widening and consolidation of the foundations of the local as well as national assemblies.  As regards Mrs. ...’s request that you assist her in her project of uniting the believers through correspondence; this is of course a task which is quite secondary compared to the duties and responsibilities you are called upon to discharge as secretary of the N.S.A. Your secretarial work in that body imposes upon you a paramount obligation which no other service can equal in importance. All your other Bahá’í activities should be subordinated to your work in the N.S.A. which is, undoubtedly, the most vital and urgent among them all.  Concerning the Greatest Name; this term refers both to “Alláh-u-Abhá” and to “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá”. The first is a form of Bahá’í greeting and should be used, while the other is an invocation, meaning “O Thou Glory of Glories!” These two words are both referred to as the Greatest Name.  The Guardian, while fully aware of the difficulties, both financial and otherwise which your N.S.A. is facing in connection with the publication of the “Herald of the South”, feels nevertheless the urge to advise you to continue with this magazine and not to feel in the least discouraged if your efforts for meeting the expenses incurred for its printing and circulation, and for raising its literary standard, do not bring the expected results. He very deeply values the self-sacrificing and sustained efforts exerted by your Assembly in this connection. May Bahá’u’lláh richly reward you for all your meritorious endeavours.  With warmest Bahá’í Greetings,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dear and valued co-worker:  The work in which your National Assembly is engaged, and which it is prosecuting with such fidelity, diligence and perseverance is near and dear to my heart. You are laying an unassailable foundation for the erection of mighty Bahá’í institutions which future generations are destined to extend and perfect. Your pioneer work is arduous and highly meritorious. I feel proud of your achievements, realizing as I do the circumstances in which you labour. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is watching over you and is well-pleased with your services. Persevere and rest assured.  Affectionately, Shoghi.      LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 25TH, 1936   September 25th, 1936  Dear Miss Brooks,  Our able and indefatigable co-worker Mr. Siegfried Schopflocher is on a tour to Australia, India and the Near East, and by the time this letter reaches you he may be already in your midst.  The Guardian wishes your N.S.A. to arrange for him to visit all the centers in Australia and if possible in New-Zealand too, and to make every effort to render his stay amongst you as abundant in its results as possible.  Mr. Schopflocher is surely known to you and to many friends in Australia. He is truly one of the most distinguished believers in the West. He has a deep knowledge of the Cause, and specially of the Administration, and has contributed a unique share towards its establishment and consolidation in the States. For many years a member of the American N.S.A., he revealed such great qualities of heart and mind as very few of his fellow-members were able to manifest. He supported valiantly and generously, and through both moral and financial means, the various institutions of the Cause, and in particular the institution of the Bahá’í Fund which, as you can well realize, is the foundation stone of every phase of Bahá’í activity.  In this connection it should be remembered that it was mainly due to his unfailing and most generous assistance that the Temple in Wilmette was built. The friends owe him indeed a great debt, and can never be too grateful for what he has accomplished, and is still so splendidly accomplishing, for the Faith in the West.  The Guardian hopes, nay he feels confident, your Assembly, as well as all the friends will extend a most cordial welcome to this dear and distinguished Servant of the Cause, and will fully avail yourselves of this splendid opportunity that has been offered you to further enrich the field of your experiences in the Faith.  With warmest greetings,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.      LETTER OF NOVEMBER 17TH, 1936   November 17th, 1936  Dear Miss Brooks,  On behalf of the Guardian I acknowledge with deepest thanks the receipt of your letter of the 17th October, and wish also to thank your Assembly for forwarding to him the photostatic reproduction of the registration certificate of the Assembly of Auckland. He fervently hopes that the formation of the Declaration of Trust of the N.S.A. will also be completed very soon, and that the difficulty you have encountered in this connection will be satisfactorily met and settled. He also trusts that the delay caused in registering the Sydney local assembly will be overcome, and that you will immediately proceed with the formation of your National Declaration of Trust. It is splendid, and a matter of deep satisfaction to our Beloved Guardian that in all these steps that you are taking for the administrative development and consolidation of the Faith in Australia and New-Zealand you are closely and faithfully following the example of America which, it should be admitted, occupies a pre-eminent rank among its sister communities in both the East and the West.  As regards the problem facing the N.S.A. in connection with the representation of Perth at the next Annual Convention; the Guardian believes that the fact that a certain assembly or community is not in a financial position to defray the expenses of its delegate or delegates does not constitute sufficient justification for depriving it from its sacred right of participation in the national elections and other activities of the Convention. Every assembly, no matter how poor, is entitled to take part in the Convention proceedings by sending one or more delegates to that meeting. It is absolutely essential that this principle be clearly understood and faithfully applied by the friends. Financial considerations can under no circumstances invalidate it, or allow the least compromise in its application. It is the duty of every N.S.A. to ensure that it will be carried out whenever the Convention elections are held.  With loving greetings,  Yours in the Guardian’s Service, H. Rabbani.
