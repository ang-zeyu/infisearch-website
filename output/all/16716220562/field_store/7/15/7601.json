Well, we have our percentage of failures. They are as few as it's humanly possible to make, and they give us every advantage that can be worked out for us----\"  \"Failures at what?\"  \"Operation Retrograde.\"  Somewhere down the hall a buzzer gave a muted whirr.  \"That's mess call. And I'm hungry, even if you're not.\" Ashe walked away as if Ross Murdock had ceased to exist.  But Ross Murdock did exist, and to him that was an important fact. As he trailed along behind Ashe he determined that he was going to continue to exist, in one piece and unharmed, Operation Retrograde or no Operation Retrograde. And he was going to pry a few enlightening answers out of somebody very soon.  To his surprise he found Ashe waiting for him at the door of a room from which came the sound of voices and a subdued clatter of trays and tableware.  \"Not many in tonight,\" Ashe commented in a take-it-or-leave-it tone. \"It's been a busy week.\"  The room was rather sparsely occupied. Five tables were empty, while the men gathered at the remaining two. Ross counted ten men, either already eating or coming back from a serving hatch with well-filled trays. All of them were dressed in slacks, shirt, and moccasins like himself--the outfit seemed to be a sort of undress uniform--and six of them were ordinary in physical appearance. The other four differed so radically that Ross could barely conceal his amazement.  Since their fellows accepted them without comment, Ross silently stole glances at them as he waited behind Ashe for a tray. One pair were clearly Oriental; they were small, lean men with thin brackets of long black mustache on either side of their mobile mouths. Yet he had caught a word or two of their conversation, and they spoke his own language with the facility of the native born. In addition to the mustaches, each wore a blue tattoo mark on the forehead and others of the same design on the backs of their agile hands.  The second duo were even more fantastic. The color of their flaxen hair was normal, but they wore it in braids long enough to swing across their powerful shoulders, a fashion unlike any Ross had ever seen. Yet any suggestion of effeminacy certainly did not survive beyond the first glance at their ruggedly masculine features.  \"Gordon!\" One of the braided giants swung halfway around from the table to halt Ashe as he came down the aisle with his tray. \"When did you get back? And where is Sanford?\"  One of the Orientals laid down the spoon with which he had been vigorously stirring his coffee and asked with real concern, \"Another loss?\"  Ashe shook his head. \"Just reassignment. Sandy's holding down Outpost Gog and doing well.\" He grinned and his face came to life with an expression of impish humor Ross would not have believed possible. \"He'll end up with a million or two if he doesn't watch out. He takes to trade as if he were born with a beaker in his fist.\"  The Oriental laughed and then glanced at Ross. \"Your new partner, Ashe?\"  Some of the animation disappeared from Ashe's brown face; he was noncommittal again. \"Temporary assignment. This is Murdock.\" The introduction was flat enough to daunt Ross. \"Hodaki, Feng,\" he indicated the two Easterners with a nod as he put down his tray. \"Jansen, Van Wyke.\" That accounted for the blonds.  \"Ashe!\" A man arose at the other table and came to stand beside theirs. Thin, with a dark, narrow face and restless eyes, he was much younger than the others, younger and not so well controlled. He might answer questions if there was something in it for him, Ross decided, and filed the thought away.  \"Well, Kurt?\" Ashe's recognition was as dampening as it could be, and Ross's estimation of the younger man went up a fraction when the snub appeared to have no effect upon him.  \"Did you hear about Hardy?\"  Feng looked as if he were about to speak, and Van Wyke frowned. Ashe made a deliberate process of chewing and swallowing before he replied. \"Naturally.\" His tone reduced whatever had happened to Hardy to a matter-of-fact proceeding far removed from Kurt's implied melodrama.  \"He's smashed up ... kaput....\" Kurt's accent, slight in the beginning, was thickening. \"Tortured....\"  Ashe regarded him levelly. \"You aren't on Hardy's run, are you?\"  Still Kurt refused to be quashed. \"Of course, I'm not! You know the run I am in training for. But that is not saying that such can not happen as well on my run, or yours, or yours!\" He pointed a stabbing finger at Feng and then at the blond men.  \"You can fall out of bed and break your neck, too, if your number comes up that way,\" observed Jansen. \"Go cry on Millaird's shoulder if it hurts you that much. You were told the score at your briefing. You know why you were picked....\"  Ross caught a faint glance aimed at him by Ashe. He was still totally in the dark, but he would not try to pry any information from this crowd. Maybe part of their training was this hush-hush business. He would wait and see, until he could get Kurt aside and do a little pumping. Meanwhile he ate stolidly and tried to cover up his interest in the conversation.  \"Then you are going to keep on saying 'Yes, sir,' 'No, sir,' to every order here----?\"  Hodaki slammed his tattooed hand on the table. \"Why this foolishness, Kurt? You well know how and why we are picked for runs. Hardy had the deck stacked against him through no fault of the project. That has happened before; it will happen again----\"  \"Which is what I have been saying! Do you wish it to happen to you? Pretty games those tribesmen on your run play with their prisoners, do they not?\"  \"Oh, shut up!\" Jansen got to his feet. Since he loomed at least five inches above Kurt and probably could have broken him in two over one massive knee, his order was one to be considered. \"If you have any complaints, go make them to Millaird. And, little man\"--he poked a massive forefinger into Kurt's chest--\"wait until you make that first run of yours before you sound off so loudly. No one is sent out without every ounce of preparation he can take. But we can't set up luck in advance, and Hardy was unlucky. That's that. We got him back, and that was lucky for him. He'd be the first to tell you so.\" He stretched. \"I'm for a game--Ashe? Hodaki?\"  \"Always so energetic,\" murmured Ashe, but he nodded as did the small Oriental.  Feng smiled at Ross. \"Always these three try to beat each other, and so far all the contests are draws. But we hope ... yes, we have hopes....\"  So Ross had no chance to speak to Kurt. Instead, he was drawn into the knot of men who, having finished their meal, entered a small arena with a half circle of spectator seats at one side and a space for contestants at the other. What followed absorbed Ross as completely as the earlier scene of the wolf killing. This too was a fight, but not a physical struggle. All three contenders were not only unlike in body, but as Ross speedily came to understand, they were also unlike in their mental approach to any problem.  They seated themselves crosslegged at the three points of a triangle. Then Ashe looked from the tall blond to the small Oriental. \"Territory?\" he asked crisply.  \"Inland plains!\" That came almost in chorus, and each man, looking at his opponent, began to laugh.  Ashe himself chuckled. \"Trying to be smart tonight, boys?\" he inquired. \"All right, plains it is.\"  He brought his hand down on the floor before him, and to Ross's astonishment the area around the players darkened and the floor became a stretch of miniature countryside. Grassy plains rippled under the wind of a fair day.  \"Red!\"  \"Blue!\"  \"Yellow!\"  The choices came quickly from the dusk masking the players. And upon those orders points of the designated color came into being as small lights.  \"Red--caravan!\" Ross recognized Jansen's boom.  \"Blue--raiders!\" Hodaki's choice was only an instant behind.  \"Yellow--unknown factor.\"  Ross was sure that sigh came from Jansen. \"Is the unknown factor a natural phenomenon?\"  \"No--tribe on the march.\"  \"Ah!\" Hodaki was considering that. Ross could picture his shrug.  The game began. Ross had heard of chess, of war games played with miniature armies or ships, of games on paper which demand from the players a quick wit and a trained memory. This game, however, was all those combined, and more. As his imagination came to life the moving points of light were transformed into the raiders, the merchants' caravan, the tribe on the march. There was ingenious deployment, a battle, a retreat, a small victory here, to be followed by a bigger defeat there. The game might have gone on for hours. The men about him muttered, taking sides and arguing heatedly in voices low enough not to drown out the moves called by the players. Ross was thrilled when the red traders avoided a very cleverly laid ambush, and indignant when the tribe was forced to withdraw or the caravan lost points. It was the most fascinating game he had ever seen, and he realized that the three men ordering those moves were all masters of strategy. Their respective skills checkmated each other so equally that an outright win was far away.  Then Jansen laughed, and the red line of the caravan gathered in a tight knot. \"Camped at a spring,\" he announced, \"but with plenty of sentries out.\" Red sparks showed briefly beyond that center core. \"And they'll have to stay there for all of me. We could keep this up till doomsday, and nobody would crack.\"  \"No\"--Hodaki contradicted him--\"someday one of you will make a little mistake and then----\"  \"And then whatever bully boys you're running will clobber us?\" asked Jansen. \"That'll be the day! Anyway, truce for now.\"  \"Granted!\"  The lights of the arena went on and the plains vanished into a dark, tiled floor. \"Any time you want a return engagement it'll be fine with me,\" said Ashe, getting up.  Jansen grinned. \"Put that off for a month or so, Gordon. We push into time tomorrow. Take care of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],["title","The Time Traders (#4)"],["body","yourselves, you two. I don't want to have to break in another set of players when I come back.\"  Ross, finding it difficult to shake off the illusion which had held him entranced, felt a slight touch on his shoulder and glanced up. Kurt stood behind him, apparently intent upon Jansen and Hodaki as they argued over some point of the game.  \"See you tonight.\" The boy's lips hardly moved, a trick Ross knew from his own past. Yes, he _would_ see Kurt tonight, or whenever he could. He was going to learn what it was this odd company seemed determined to keep as their own private secret.     CHAPTER 3   Ross stood cautiously against the wall of his darkened room, his head turned toward the slightly open door. A slight shuffling sound had awakened him, and he was now as ready as a cat before her spring. But he did not hurl himself at the figure now easing the door farther open. He waited until the visitor was approaching the bunk before he slid along the wall, closing the door and putting his shoulders against it.  \"What's the pitch?\" Ross demanded in a whisper.  There was a ragged breath, maybe two, then a little laugh out of the dark. \"You are ready?\" The visitor's accent left no doubt as to his identity. Kurt was paying him the promised visit.  \"Did you think that I wouldn't be?\"  \"No.\" The dim figure sat without invitation on the edge of the bunk. \"I would not be here otherwise, Murdock. You are plenty ... have plenty on the ball. You see, I have heard things about you. Like me, you were tricked into this game. Tell me, is it not true that you saw Hardy tonight.\"  \"You hear a lot, don't you?\" Ross was noncommittal.  \"I hear, I see, I learn more than these big mouths, like the major with all his do's and don'ts. That I can tell you! You saw Hardy. Do _you_ want to be a Hardy?\"  \"Is there any danger of that?\"  \"Danger!\" Kurt snorted. \"Danger--you have not yet known the meaning of danger, little man. Not until now. I ask you again, do you want to end like Hardy? They have not yet looped you in with all their big talk. That is why I came here tonight. If you know what is good for you, Murdock, you will make a break before they tape you----\"  \"Tape me?\"  Kurt's laugh was full of anger, not amusement. \"Oh, yes. They have many tricks here. They are big brains, eggheads, all of them with their favorite gadgets. They put you through a machine to get you registered on a tape. Then, my boy, you cannot get outside the base without ringing all the alarms! Neat, eh? So if you want to make a break, you must try it before they tape you.\"  Ross did not trust Kurt, but he was listening to him attentively. The other's argument sounded convincing to one whose general ignorance of science led him to be as fearful of the whole field as his ancestors had been of black magic. As all his generation, he was conditioned to believe that all kinds of weird inventions were entirely possible and probable--usually to be produced in some dim future, but perhaps today.  \"They must have you taped,\" Ross pointed out.  Kurt laughed again, but this time he was amused. \"They believe that they have. Only they are not as smart as they believe, the major and the rest, including Millaird! No, I have a fighting chance to get out of this place, only I cannot do it alone. That is why I have been waiting for them to bring in a new guy I could get to before they had him pinned down for good. You are tough, Murdock. I saw your record, and I'm betting that you did not come here with the intention of staying. So--here is your chance to go along with one who knows the ropes. You will not have such a good one again.\"  The longer Kurt talked, the more convincing he was. Ross lost a few of his suspicions. It was true that he had come prepared to run at the first possible opportunity, and if Kurt had everything planned, so much the better. Of course, it was possible that Kurt was a stool pigeon, leading him on as a test. But that was a chance Ross would have to take.  \"Look here, Murdock, maybe you think it's easy to break out of here. Do you know where we are, boy? We're near enough to the North Pole as makes no difference! Are you going to leg it back some hundreds of miles through thick ice and snow? A nice jaunt if you make it. I do not think that you can--not without plans and a partner who knows what he is about.\"  \"And how _do_ we go? Steal one of those atomjets? I'm no pilot--are you?\"  \"They have other things besides a-j's here. This place is strictly hush-hush. Even the a-j's do not set down too often for fear they will be tracked by radar. Where have you been, boy? Don't you know the Reds are circling around up here? These fellows watch for Red activity, and the Reds watch them. They play it under the table on both sides. We get our supplies overland by cats----\"  \"Cats?\"  \"Snow sleds, like tractors,\" the other answered impatiently. \"Our stuff is dumped miles to the south, and the cats go down once a month to bring it back. There's no trick to driving a cat, and they tear off the miles----\"  \"How many miles to the south?\" inquired Ross skeptically. Granted Kurt was speaking the truth, travel over an arctic wilderness in a stolen machine was risky, to say the least. Ross had only a very vague idea of the polar regions, but he was sure that they could easily swallow up the unwary forever.  \"Maybe only a hundred or so, boy. But I have more than one plan, and I'm willing to risk _my_ neck. Do you think I intend to start out blind?\"  There was that, of course. Ross had early sized up his visitor as one who was first of all interested in his own welfare. He wouldn't risk his neck without a definite plan in mind.  \"Well, what do you say, Murdock? Are you with me or not?\"  \"I'll take some time to chew it over----\"  \"Time is what you do not have, boy. Tomorrow they will tape you. Then--no over the wall for you.\"  \"Suppose you tell me your trick for fooling the tape,\" Ross countered.  \"That I cannot do, seeing as how it lies in the way my brain is put together. Do you think I can break open my skull and hand you a piece of what is inside? No, you jump with me tonight or else I must wait to grab the next one who lands here.\"  Kurt stood up. His last words were spoken matter-of-factly, and Ross believed he meant exactly what he said. But Ross hesitated. He wanted to try for freedom, a desire fed by his suspicions of what was going on here. He neither liked nor trusted Kurt, but he thought he understood him--better than he understood Ashe or the others. Also, with Kurt he was sure he could hold his own; it would be the kind of struggle he had experienced before.  \"Tonight....\" he repeated slowly.  \"Yes, tonight!\" There was new eagerness in Kurt's voice, for he sensed that the other was wavering. \"I have been preparing for a long time, but there must be two of us. We have to take turns driving the cat. There can be no rest until we are far to the south. I tell you it will be easy. There are food caches arranged along the route for emergencies. I have a map marked to show where they are. Are you coming?\"  When Ross did not answer at once the other moved closer to him.  \"Remember Hardy? He was not the first, and he will not be the last. They use us up fast here. That is why they brought you so quickly. I tell you, it is better to take your chance with me than on a run.\"  \"And what is a run?\"  \"So they have not yet briefed you? Well, a run is a little jaunt back into history--not nice comfortable history such as you learned out of a book when you were a little kid. No, you are dropped back into some savage time before history----\"  \"That's impossible!\"  \"Yes? You saw those two big blond boys tonight, did you not? Why do you suppose they sport those braids? Because they are taking a little trip into the time when he-men wore braids, and carried axes big enough to crack a man open! And Hodaki and his partner.... Ever hear of the Tartars? Maybe you have not, but once they nearly overran most of Europe.\"  Ross swallowed. He now knew where he had seen braids pictured on warriors--the Vikings! And Tartars, yes, that movie about someone named Khan, Genghis Khan! But to return into the past was impossible.  Yet, he remembered the picture he had watched today with the wolf slayer and the shaggy-haired man who wore skins. Neither of these was of his own world! Could Kurt be telling the truth? Ross's vivid memory of the scene he had witnessed made Kurt's story more convincing.  \"Suppose you get sent back to a time where they do not like strangers,\" Kurt continued. \"Then you are in for it. That is what happened to Hardy. And it is not good--not good at all!\"  \"But why?\"  Kurt snorted. \"_That_ they do not tell you until just before you take your first run. I do not want to know why. But I do know that I am not going to be sent into any wilderness where a savage may run a spear through me just to prove something or other for Major John Kelgarries, or for Millaird either. I will try my plan first.\"  The urgency in Kurt's protest carried Ross past the wavering point. He, too, would try the cat. He was only familiar with this time and world; he had no desire to be sent into another one.  Once Ross had made his decision, Kurt hurried him into action. Kurt's knowledge of the secret procedures at the base proved excellent. Twice they were halted by locked doors, but only momentarily, for Kurt had a tiny gadget, concealed in the palm of his hand, which had only to be held over a latch to open a recalcitrant door.  There was enough light in the corridors to give them easy passage, but the rooms were dark, and twice Kurt had to lead Ross by the hand, avoiding furniture or installations with the surety of one who had practiced that same route often. Murdock's opinion of his companion's ability underwent several upward revisions during that tour, and he began to believe that he was really in luck to have found such a partner.  In the last room, Ross willingly followed Kurt's orders to put on the"]]]
