It moved faster than she did.  \"Makes me povokin',\" said she, giving Dinah a shake. \"Um runs away and away, and all off!\"  Sometimes she remembered she was going to heaven, and sometimes she forgot it. She was on the way to the \"Pines,\" and many little flowers grew by the road-side. She began to pick a few, but the thorns on the raspberry bushes tore her tender hands, and one of the naughty branches caught Dinah by the frizzly hair, and carried her under. What did Flyaway spy behind the bushes? Dotty Dimple and Jennie Vance. They were eating wintergreen leaves; they did not see her. Flyaway kept as still as if she were sitting for a photograph, picked up Dinah, gave her a hug, and crept on.  She went so quietly that nobody heard her. When she was out of sight she purred for joy. She had got ahead of the girls on the way to heaven! She took the stick of candy out of her pocket and nibbled it to celebrate the occasion. \"A little hump-backed bumblebee\" saw her do it. He wanted some too, and followed Flyaway as if she had been a moving honeysuckle. For half a mile or more she \"gaed\" and she \"gaed,\" all the while nibbling the candy; but now she was growing very tired, and did it to comfort herself. Suddenly she remembered it was Charlie's candy. She held it up to her tearful eyes.  \"O dee,\" said she, \"it was big, but it keeps a-gettin' little!\"  The hungry bumblebee, who was just behind her, thought this was his last chance: so he pounced down upon Charlie's candy; and being cross, and not knowing Flyaway from any other little girl, he stung her on the thumb. Then how she cried, \"'Orny 'ting me! 'Orny 'ting me!\" for she had been treated just so before by a hornet. \"O my dee mamma! My dee mamma!\"  But her \"dee\" mamma could not hear her; she was in the city of Augusta; and as for the rest of the family, they supposed Flyaway was playing \"catch\" with Dotty Dimple in the barn.     CHAPTER IV.  \"A RAILROAD SAVAGE.\"   It now occurred to little Flyaway, with a sudden pang, that she must have come to the end of the world. \"Yes, cerdily!\" The world was full of folks and houses,--this place was nothing but trees. The world had horses and wagons in it,--this place hadn't. \"O dee!\"  Where was the hill gone, on the top of which stood that big house they called heaven,--the house where Charlie lived and played in the garden? Why, that hill had just walked off, and the house too! She parted the bushes and peeped through. Nothing to be seen but trees. Flyaway began to cry from sheer fright, as well as pain. \"'Tis a defful day! I can't _stay_ in this day!\"  More trouble had come to her than she knew how to bear; but worst of all was the cruel stab of the bumblebee. She pitied her aching \"fum,\" and kissed it herself to make it feel better; but all in vain; \"the pain kept on and on;\" the \"fum\" grew big as fast as the candy had grown little.  \"Somebody don't take 'are o' me,\" wailed she; \"somebody gone off, lef' me alone!\"  She was dreadfully hungry. \"When _was_ it be dinner time?\" She would not have been in the least surprised, but very much pleased, if a bird had flown down with a plate of roast lamb in his bill, and set it on the ground before her. Simple little Flyaway! Or if her far-away mother had sprung out from behind a tree with a bed in her arms, the tired baby would have jumped into the bed and asked no questions.  But nothing of the sort came to pass. Here she was, without any heaven or any mother; and the great yellow sun was creeping fast down the sky.  \"I'm tired out and sleepy out,\" wailed the young traveller, the tears rolling over the rims of her \"spetty-curls,\"--\"all sleepy out; and I can't get rested 'thout--my--muvver!\"  She sat down and hid her head in her black dolly's bosom.  \"Diny, you got some ears? We wasn't here by-fore!\"  This was all the way she had of saying she was lost.  The sky suddenly grew dark; a shower was coming up.  \"Where has the bwight sun gone?\" said Flyaway, with a shudder.  She was answered by a peal of thunder,--wagon-wheels, she supposed.  \"Here I is!\" shouted she.  Some one had come for her. Perhaps it was Charlie, and they meant to give her a ride up to heaven. A flash of light, and then another crash. Flyaway understood it then. It was logs. People were rolling logs up in the sky, on the blue floor. She had seen logs in a mill. Such a noise!  Then she dropped fast asleep, and somebody came right down out of the clouds and gave her a peach turnover as big as a dinner basket, or so she thought. Just as she was about to cut it, she was awakened by the rain dripping into her eyes. She started up, exclaiming, \"If you pees um, I want some cheese um.\"  But the turnover had gone! Then the feeling of desolation swept over her again. She had come to the end of the world, and dinner, and mother, and heaven had all gone off and left her.  \"O, Diny,\" sobbed she, turning to her unfeeling dolly for sympathy. \"I's free years old, and you's one years old. Don't you want to go to heaven, Diny, and sit in God's lap? What a great big lap he must have!\"  A gust of wind lifted the frizzles on Dinah's forehead, but that was all.  \"O dee, dee, dee! you don't hear nuffin 't all, Diny,\" said Flyaway--the only sensible remark she had made that day. It was of no use talking to Dinah; so she began to talk to herself.  \"What you matter, Flywer Clifford?\" said she, scowling to keep her courage up. \"What you matter?\"  And after she had said that, she cried harder than ever, and crept under the bushes, moaning like a wounded lamb.  \"I'm defful wetter, but I'm colder'n I's wetter; makes me shivvle!\"  After a while the clouds had poured out all the rain there was in them, and left the sky as clear as it was before; but by that time the sun had gone to bed, and the little birds too, sending out their good nights from tree to tree. Then the new moon came, and peeped over the shoulder of a hill at Flyaway. She sprang out from the bushes like a rabbit.  \"O, my shole!\" cried she, clapping her hands, \"the sun's camed again! A little bit o' sun. I sawed it!\"  [Illustration: LOST IN THE WOODS.]  Inspired with new courage, she and Dinah concluded to start for home; that is to say, they turned round three or four times, and then struck off into the woods.         *       *       *       *       *  Now you may be sure all this could not happen without causing great alarm at grandpa Parlin's. When the dinner bell rang, everybody asked, twice over, \"Why, where is little Fly?\" and Dotty Dimple answered, as innocently as if it were none of her affairs,--  \"Why, isn't she in the house? We s'posed she was. Jennie Vance and I have just been out in the garden, under your little _crying willow_, making a wreath. Thought she was in the barn, or somewhere.\"  \"But you haven't been in the garden all the while?\"  \"No'm; once we went up in the Pines,--grandma, you said we might,--but we haven't seen Fly,--why, we haven't seen her for the longest while!\"  Grace had dropped her knife and fork and was looking pale.  \"It was Susy and I that had the care of her, grandma; when you went out to see the sick lady, you charged us, and we forgot all about it.\"  \"Pretty works, I should think!\" cried Horace, springing out of his chair; \"I wouldn't sell that baby for her weight in gold; but I reckon _you_ would, Grace Clifford, and be glad of it, too.\"  Grandma held up a warning finger. \"I declare,\" said aunt Louise, very much agitated, \"I never shall consent to have Maria go out of town again, and leave Katie with us. If she will try to swim in the watering-trough, she is just as likely to take a walk on the ridgepole of the house.\"  Horace darted out of the room with a ghastly face, but came back looking relieved. He had been up in the attic, and climbed through the scuttle, without finding any human Fly on the roof, or on the dizzy tops of the chimneys, either.  But where was the child? Had Ruth seen her? Had Abner?  No; the last that could be remembered, she had been playing by herself in the green chamber, soaking Dinah's feet in a glass of water. The \"blue kitty,\" the only creature who had anything to tell, sat washing her face on the kitchen hearth, and yawning sleepily. Fly's shaker was gone from the \"short nail,\" and aunt Louise discovered some bank-bills in a wash-bowl,--\"Fly's work, of course.\" But this was all they knew.  Grandpa searched the barn, Abner the fields, Ruth the cellar; aunt Louise and Horace ran down to the river. In half an hour several of the neighbors had joined in the search.  \"I always thought there would be a last time,\" said poor Mrs. Dr. Gray, putting on her black bonnet, and joining Grace and Susy. \"That child seems to me like a little spirit, or a fairy, and I never thought she would live long. She and Charlie were too lovely for this world.\"  \"O, _don't_, Mrs. Gray,\" said Grace. \"If you knew how often she'd been lost, you would not say so! We always find her, after a while, somewhere.\"  Horace, who had gone on in advance, now came running back, swinging his boots in the air.  \"A trail!\" cried he. \"I've found a trail! Who planted these boots in the road, if it wasn't Fly Clifford?\"  \"Perhaps she has gone to aunt Martha's,\" said Mrs. Parlin, \"or tried to. Strange we did not think of that!\"  But aunt Martha had not seen her, nor had any one else. Horace and Abner went up to the Pines, but the forest beyond they never thought of exploring; it did not seem probable that such a small child could have strolled to such a distance as that.  Supper time came and went. There was a short thunder-shower. The Parlins shuddered at every flash of lightning, and shivered at every drop of rain; for where was delicate, lost little Fly?  Abner and Horace were out during the shower. Horace would have braved hurricanes and avalanches in the cause of his dear little Topknot.  \"There's one thing we haven't thought of,\" said Abner, shaking the drops from his hat and looking up at the sky, which had cleared again; \"we haven't thought"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19247"],["title","Dotty Dimple's Flyaway (#4)"],["body","the railroad surveyors! They are round the town everywhere with their compasses and spy-glasses.\"  It was not a bad idea of Abner's. He and Horace went to the hotel where the railroad men boarded. The engineer's face lighted at once.  \"I wish I had known before there was a child missing,\" he said. \"I saw the figure of a little girl, through my glass, not an hour ago. It was a long way beyond the Pines, and I wondered how such a baby happened up there; but I had so much else to think of that it passed out of my mind.\"  About eight o'clock, Flyaway was found in the woods, sound asleep, under a hemlock tree, her faithful Dinah hugged close to her heart.  There was a shout from a dozen mouths. Horace's eyes overflowed. He caught his beloved pet in his arms.  \"O, little Topknot!\" he cried. \"Who's got you? Look up, look up, little Brown-brimmer.\"  All Flyaway could do was to sob gently, and then curl her head down on her brother's shoulder, saying, sleepily, \"Cold, ou' doors stayin'.\"  \"Why did our darling run away?\"  \"Didn't yun away; I's goin' up to heaven see Charlie,\" replied Flyaway, suddenly remembering the object of her journey, and gazing around at Abner, Dr. Gray, and the other people, with eyes full of wonder. \"Where's the toppest hill? I's goin' up, carry Charlie some canny.\"  The people formed a line, and, as Prudy said, \"processed\" behind Katie all the way to the village.  \"Is we goin' to heaven?\" said the child, still bewildered. \"It yunned away and away, and all off!\"  \"No, you blessed baby, you are not going to heaven just yet, if we can help it,\" answered Dr. Gray, leaning over Horace's shoulder to kiss the child.  Flyaway was too tired to ask any more questions. She let first one person carry her, and then another, sometimes holding up her swollen thumb, and murmuring, \"'Orny 'ting me--tell my mamma.\" And after that she was asleep again.  Dotty Dimple, Susy, and Prudy were pacing the piazza when the party arrived, but poor grandma was on the sofa in the parlor, quite overcome with anxiety and fatigue, and Miss Polly Whiting was mournfully fanning her with a black feather fan. The sound of voices roused Mrs. Parlin. \"Safe! safe!\" was the cry. Dotty Dimple rushed in, shouting, \"A railroad savage found her! a railroad savage found her!\"  In another moment the runaway was in her grandmother's lap. All she could say was, \"'Orny 'ting me on my fum! 'Orny 'ting me on my fum!\" For this one little bite of a bee seemed greater to Flyaway Clifford than all the dangers she had passed. If grandma would only kiss her \"fum,\" it was no matter about going to heaven, or even being undressed.  But after she had had a bowl of bread and milk, and been nicely bathed, she forgot her sufferings, and laughed in her sleep. She was dreaming how Charlie came to the door of heaven and helped her up the steps.     CHAPTER V.  EAST AGAIN.   A whole year passed. Dotty Dimple became a school-girl, with a \"bosom friend\" and a pearl ring. Prudy, who called herself \"the middle-aged sister,\" grew tall and slender. Katie was four years old, and just a little heavier, so she no longer needed a cent in her pocket to keep her from blowing away.  The Parlins had been at Willowbrook a week before the Cliffords arrived. There was a great sensation over Katie. She was delighted to hear that she had grown more than any of the others.  \"I'm gettin' old all over!\" said she, gayly. \"Four--goin' to be five! Wish I was most six. Dotty Dimpul, don't you wish _you's_ most a _hunderd_?\"  \"O, you cunning little cousin!\" said Dotty, embracing her rapturously; \"I wish you loved me half as well as I love you; that's what I wish. I told Tate Penny you were prettier than Tid; and so you are. Such red cheeks! But what makes one cheek redder than the other?\"  \"O, I eat my bread 'n' milk that side o' my mouf,\" replied Flyaway; \"and that's why.\"  \"What an idea! And your hair is just as fine as ever it was; the color of my ring--isn't it, Prudy?\"  Flyaway put her little hand to her head, and felt the floss flying about as usual.  \"My hair comes all to pieces,\" explained she; \"_or nelse_ I have a ribbon to tie it up with.\"  \"Are you glad to come back to Willowbrook, you precious little dear?\" asked two or three voices.  \"Yes 'm,\" said Flyaway, doubtfully; \"Y--es--um.\"  \"She doesn't remember anything about it, I guess,\" said Prudy, kneeling before the little one, and kissing the sweet place in her neck.  \"Yes, I do,\" said Flyaway, winking hard and breathing quick in the effort to recall the very dim and very distant past; \"yes, I 'member.\"  \"Well, what do you 'member?\"  \"O, once I was grindin' coffee out there in a yellow chair, and somebody she came and put me in the sink.\"  \"She does know--doesn't she?\" said Dotty. \"That was Ruthie; come out in the kitchen and see her.\"  But when Flyaway first looked into Ruth's smiling face, with its black eyes and sharp nose, she could not remember that she had ever seen it before. Abner, too, was strange to her.  \"Come here,\" said he, \"and I can tell in a minute if you are a good little girl.\"  Flyaway cast down her soft eyes, and sidled along to Abner.  \"Here, touch this watch,\" said he, \"and if you are a good little girl it will fly open; if you are naughty it will stay shut.\"  Flyaway looked askance at Abner, her finger in her mouth, but dared not touch the watch.  \"Who'd 'a thought it, now?\" said Abner, pretending to be shocked. \"Looks to be a nice child; but of course she isn't, or she'd come right up and open the watch.\"  Flyaway thrust another finger in her mouth, and pressed her eyelids slowly together. Abner did not understand this, but it meant that he had not treated her with proper respect.  \"Here, Ruth,\" said he, in a low tone, \"hand me one of your plum tarts; that'll fetch her.--Come here, my pretty one, and see what's inside of this little pie.\"  Flyaway was very hungry. She took a step forward, and held her hand out, though rather timidly.  \"But she mustn't eat it without asking her mamma,\" said Ruth.  \"Yes; O, yes,\" cried Miss Flyaway, opening her little mouth for the first time, and shutting it again over a big bite of tart; \"I want to eat it and _s'prise_ my mamma.\"  Abner laughed in his hearty fashion. \"Some of the old mischief left there yet,\" said he, catching Flyaway and tossing her to the ceiling. \"Have you come here this summer to keep the whole house in commotion? Remember the Charlie boy--don't you--that had the meal-bags tied to his feet?\"  \"Did he? What for?\"  Flyaway had not the least recollection of Charlie; but Horace had talked to her about him, and she said, after a moment's thought,--  \"Yes, he washed the pig. Me and Charlie, we played all everything what we thinked about.\"  \"So you did, surely,\" said a woman who had just come in at the back door, and begun to drop kisses, as sad as tears, on Flyaway's forehead. \"Do you know who this is?\" Flyaway looked up with a sweet smile, but her mind had lost all impression of her melancholy friend, Miss Whiting. \"Look again,\" said the sad-eyed stranger, who did not like to have even a little child forget her; \"you used to call me the 'Polly woman.'\"  Katie looked again, and this time very closely.  \"There's a great deal o' yellowness in your face,\" exclaimed she, after a careful survey; \"but you was made so!\"  Miss Polly laughed drearily. \"So you don't remember how I took you out of the watering-trough, you sweet lamb! 'I's tryin' to swim,' you said; 'and _that's_ what is it.' Here's a summer-sweeting for you, dear; do you like them?\"  \"Yes'm, thank you,\" said Flyaway, \"but I like summer-_sourings_ the best.\"  At the same time she allowed herself to be taken in Miss Polly's lap, and won that tender-hearted woman's love by putting her arms round her neck, and saying, \"Let me kiss you so you'll feel all better. What makes you have tears in your eyes?--tell me.\"  \"We're good friends--I knew we should be,\" said Miss Polly, quite cheerily. \"Look out of the window, and see that swing. How many times I've pushed you and Dotty in that swing when it seemed as if it would break my back!\"  Flyaway looked out. There stood the two trees, and between them hung the old swing; but the charm was forgotten. In the field beyond, her eye fell on an object more interesting to her.  \"O, O,\" said she, \"I don't see how God _could_ make a man so homebly as that!\"  \"So homely as what?\"  \"Why,\" laughed Dotty, \"she means that scarecrow.\"  The corn was up long ago, but one direful image had still been left to flaunt in the sunlight and soak in the rain.  \"That isn't a man,\" said Prudy; \"it's only a great monstrous rag baby, with a coat on.\"  \"Put there to frighten away the crows,\" added Miss Polly. \"When Abner dropped corn in the ground, the great black crows wanted to come and pick it out, and eat it up.\"  Flyaway frowned in token of strong dislike to the crows. \"I wouldn't eat gampa's corn for anything in this world,\" said she,--\"'thout it's popped! 'Cause I don't like it.\"  Miss Polly laughed quite merrily.  \"There,\" said she, \"I've dropped a stitch in my side; it never agrees with me to laugh. I must be going right home, too; but there is one thing more I want to ask you, Katie; do you remember how you ran away, one day, and frightened the whole house, trying to climb up to heaven?\"  Katie's face was blank; she had forgotten the journey.  \"You passed Jennie Vance and me in the Pines,\" said Dotty, \"and went deep into the woods, and a bee stung you.\"  \"O, now I 'member,\" said Katie, suddenly. \"I 'member the bee as plain as 'tever 'twas!\" And she curled her lip with contempt for that small Flyaway, of long ago--that silly baby who had thought heaven was on a hill.  \"_I_ went up on a ladder when I was three years old,\" said Prudy.  \"Did you?\" said Flyaway. This was a consolation. \"Well, I was three years old, too; I didn't know 'bout angels--didn't know they had to have wings on.\"  Here Flyaway curled her lip again and smiled.  \"You are wiser now,\" sighed Miss Polly. \"You and"]]]
