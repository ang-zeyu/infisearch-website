No visit can be paid till three; and this gives me very little time in these short days.  Everything here is inflexible as the laws of the Medes and Persians, and though I am called “Mistress” even by old Cates with his grey hair and black coat, I cannot make one of them do anything, except _by_ the person and _at_ the time which English custom prescribes.  They are brought up to fill certain situations, and fill them perfectly, but cannot or will not vary.  I am frequently asked by the ladies here if I have formed a household to please me and I am obliged to confess that I have a very nice household, but that I am the only refractory member of it.  I am always asking the wrong person for coals, etc., etc.  The division of labor, or rather ceremonies, between the butler and footman, I have now mastered I believe in some degree, but that between the _upper_ and _under_ house-maid is still a profound mystery to me, though the upper has explained to me for the twentieth time that she did only “the top of the work.”  My cook comes up to me every morning for orders, and always drops the deepest curtsey, but then I doubt if her hands are ever profaned by touching a poker, and she _never_ washes a dish.  She is cook and _housekeeper_, and presides over the housekeeper’s room; which has a Brussels carpet and centre table, with one side entirely occupied by the linen presses, of which my maid (my vice-regent, only _much_ greater than me) keeps the key and dispenses every towel, even for the kitchen.  She keeps lists of everything and would feel bound to replace anything missing.  I shall make you laugh and Mrs. Goodwin stare, by some of my housekeeping stories, the next evening I pass in your little pleasant parlor (a word unknown here).    _To W. D. B. and A. B._                                                    LONDON, January 10, 1847.  MY VERY DEAR CHILDREN: . . . Yesterday we dined at Lady Charleville’s, the old lady of eighty-four, at whose house I mentioned an evening visit in my last, and I must tell you all about it to entertain dear Grandma. I will be minute for once, and give you the _little_ details of a London dinner, and they are all precisely alike.  We arrived at Cavendish Square a quarter before seven (very early) and were shown into a semi-library on the same floor with the dining-room.  The servants take your cloak, etc., in the passage, and I am never shown into a room with a mirror as with us, and never into a chamber or bedroom.  We found Lady Charleville and her daughter with one young gentleman with whom I chatted till dinner, and who, I found, was Sir William Burdette, son of Sir Francis and brother of Miss Angelina Coutts.  I happened to have on the corsage of my black velvet a white moss rose and buds, which I thought rather youthful for _me_, but the old lady had [them] on her cap.  She is full of intelligence, and has always been in the habit of drawing a great deal. . . . Very soon came in Lord Aylmer, [who] was formerly Governor of Canada, and Lady Colchester, daughter of Lord Ellenborough, a very pretty woman of thirty-five, I should think; Sir William and Lady Chatterton and Mr. Algernon Greville, whose grandmother wrote the beautiful “Prayer for Indifference,” an old favorite of mine, and Mr. MacGregor, the political economist.  Lord Aylmer took me out and I found him a nice old peer, and discovered that ever since the death of his uncle, Lord Whitworth, whose title is extinct, he had borne the arms of both Aylmer and Whitworth.  Mr. Bancroft took out Lady Colchester, and the old lady was wheeled out precisely as Grandma is.  At table she helped to the fish (cod, garnished round with smelts) and insisted on carving the turkey herself, which she did extremely well.  By the way, I observe they never carve the breast of a turkey _longitudinally_, as we do, but in short slices, a little diagonally from the centre.  This makes many more slices, and quite large enough where there are so many other dishes.  The four _entrée_ dishes are always placed on the table when we sit down, according to our old fashion, and not one by one.  They have [them] warmed with hot water, so that they keep hot while the soup and fish are eaten.  Turkey, even _boiled_ turkey, is brought on _after_ the _entrées_, mutton (a saddle always) or venison, with a pheasant or partridges.  With the roast is always put on the _sweets_, as they are called, as the term dessert seems restricted to the last course of fruits.  During the dinner there are always long strips of damask all round the table which are removed before the dessert is put on, and there is no brushing of crumbs.  You may not care for all this, but the housekeepers may.  I had Mr. Greville the other side of me, who seemed much surprised that I, an American, should know the “Prayer for Indifference,” which he doubted if twenty persons in England read in these modern days.  It is a great mystery to me yet how people get to know each other in London.  Persons talk to you whom you do not know, for no one is introduced, as a general rule.  I have sometimes quite an acquaintance with a person, and exchange visits, and yet do not succeed for a long time in putting their name and the person together. . . . It is a great puzzle to a stranger, but has its conveniences for the English themselves.  We are endeavoring to become acquainted with the English mind, not only through society, but through its products in other ways. Natural science is the department into which they seem to have thrown their intellect most effectively for the last ten or fifteen years.  We are reading Whewell’s “History of the Inductive Sciences,” which gives one a summary of what has been accomplished in that way, not only in past ages, but in the present.  Every moment here is precious to me and I am anxious to make the best use of it, but I have immense demands on my time in every way.    _To W. D. B. and A. B._                                             Tuesday night, January 19, 1847.  To-day we have been present at the opening of Parliament, but how can I picture to you the interest and magnificence of the scene.  I will begin quite back, and give you all the preparations for a “Court Day.”  Ten days before, a note was written to Lord Willoughby d’Eresby, informing him of my intention to attend, that a seat might be reserved for me, and also soliciting several tickets for American ladies and gentlemen. . . . I cannot take them with me, however, as the seat assigned to the ladies of Foreign Ministers is very near the throne.  This morning when I awoke the fog was thicker than I ever knew it, even here.  The air was one dense orange-colored mass.  What a pity the English cannot borrow our bright blue skies in which to exhibit their royal pageants!  Mr. Bancroft’s court dress had not been sent home, our servants’ liveries had not made their appearance, and our carriage only arrived last night, and I had not passed judgment upon it.  Fogs and tradesmen! these are the torments of London.  Very soon came the tailor with embroidered dress, sword, and chapeau, but, alas! Mr. Isidore, who was to have dressed my hair at half-past ten was not forthcoming, and to complete my perplexity, he had my head-dress in his possession.  At last, just as Russell had resumed her office at the toilet, came Isidore, a little before twelve, coiffure and all, which was so pretty that I quire forgave him all his sins.  It was of green leaves and white _fleur-de-lis_, with a white ostrich feather drooping on one side.  I wear my hair now plain in front, and the wreath was very flat and classical in its style.  My dress was black velvet with a very rich bertha.  A bouquet on the front of _fleur-de-lis_, like the coiffure, and a Cashmere shawl, completed my array.  I have had the diamond pin and earrings which you father gave me, reset, and made into a magnificent brooch, and so arranged that I can also wear it as a necklace or bracelet.  On this occasion it was my necklace.  Miss Murray came to go with me, as she wished to be by my side to point out everybody, and her badge as Maid of Honor would take her to any part of the house.  At half-past twelve she and I set out, and after leaving us the carriage returned for your father and Mr. Brodhead.  But first let me tell you something of our equipage.  It is a _chariot_, not a coach; that is, it has but one seat, but the whole front being glass makes it much more agreeable to such persons as have not large families.  The color is maroon, with a silver moulding, and has the American arms on the panel.  The liveries are blue and red; on Court Days they have blue plush breeches, and white silk stockings, with buckles on their shoes.  Your father leaves all these matters to me, and they have given me no little plague.  When I thought I had arranged everything necessary, the coachman, good old Brooks, solicited an audience a day or two ago, and began, “Mistress, did you tell them to send the pads and the fronts and the hand-pieces?”  “Heavens and earth! what are all these things?” said I.  “Why, ma’am, we always has pads under the saddle on Court Days, trimmed round with the colors of the livery, and we has fronts made of ribbin for the horses’ heads, and we has white hand-pieces for the reins.”  This is a specimen of the little troubles of court life, but it has its compensations.  To go back to Miss Murray and myself, who are driving through the park between files of people, thousands and thousands all awaiting with patient, loyal faces the passage of the Queen and of the State carriages.  The Queen’s was drawn by eight cream-colored horses, and the servants flaming with scarlet and gold.  This part of the park, near the palace, is only accessible to the carriages of the foreign ministers, ministers, and officers of the household.  We arrive at the Parliament House, move through the long corridor and give up our tickets at the door of the chamber."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1936"],["title","Letters from England, 1846-1849 (#6)"],["body","  It is a very long, narrow room.  At the upper end is the throne, on the right is the seat of the ambassadors, on the left, of their ladies.  Just in front of the throne is the wool-sack of the Lord Chancellor, looking like a drawing-room divan, covered with crimson velvet.  Below this are rows of seats for the judges, who are all in their wigs and scarlet robes; the bishops and the peers, all in robes of scarlet and ermine.  Opposite the throne at the lower end is the Bar of the Commons.  On the right of the Queen’s chair is a vacant one, on which is carved the three plumes, the insignia of the Prince of Wales, who will occupy it when he is seven or nine years old; on the left Prince Albert sits.  The seat assigned me was in the front row, and quite open, like a sofa, so that I could talk with any gentleman whom I knew.  Madam Van de Weyer was on one side of me and the Princess Callimachi on the other, and Miss Murray just behind me.  She insisted on introducing to me all her noble relatives.  Her cousin, the young Duke of Athol; the Duke of Buccleuch; her nephew the Marquis of Camden; her brother the Bishop of Rochester. There were many whom I had seen before, so that the hour passed very agreeably.  Very soon came in the Duke of Cambridge, at which everybody rose, he being a royal duke.  He was dressed in the scarlet kingly robe, trimmed with ermine, and with his white hair and whiskers (he is an old man) was most picturesque and scenic, reminding me of King Lear and other stage kings.  He requested to be introduced to me, upon which I rose, of course.  He soon said, “Be seated,” and we went on with the conversation. I told him how much I liked Kew Garden, where he has a favorite place.  When I first entered I was greeted very cordially by a personage in a black gown and wig, whom I did not know.  He laughed and said: “I am Mr. Senior, whom you saw only Saturday evening, but you do not know me in my wig.”  It is, indeed, an entire transformation, for it reaches down on the shoulders.  He is a master in chancery.  He stood by me nearly all the time and pointed out many of the judges, and some persons not in Miss Murray’s line.  But the trumpets sound! the Queen approaches!  The trumpet continues, and first enter at a side door close at my elbow the college of heralds richly dressed, slowly, two and two; then the great officers of the household, then the Lord Chancellor bearing the purse, seal, and speech of the Queen, with the macebearers before him.  Then Lord Lansdowne with the crown, the Earl of Zetland, with the cap of maintenance, and the Duke off Wellington, with the sword of State.  Then Prince Albert, leading the Queen, followed by the Duchess of Sutherland, Mistress of the Robes, and the Marchioness of Douro, daughter-in-law of the Duke of Wellington, who is one of the ladies in waiting.  The Queen and Prince sit down, while everybody else remains standing.  The Queen then says in a voice most clear and sweet: “My lords (rolling the r), be seated.”  Upon which the peers sit down, except those who enter with the Queen, who group themselves about the throne in the most picturesque manner.  The Queen had a crown of diamonds, with splendid necklace and stomacher of the same.  The Duchess of Sutherland close by her side with her ducal coronet of diamonds, and a little back, Lady Douro, also, with her coronet.  On the right of the throne stood the Lord Chancellor, with scarlet robe and flowing wig, holding the speech, surrounded by the emblems of his office; a little farther, one step lower down, Lord Lansdowne, holding the crown on a crimson velvet cushion, and on the left the Duke of Wellington, brandishing the sword of State in the air, with the Earl of Zetland by his side.  The Queen’s train of royal purple, or rather deep crimson, was borne by many train-bearers.  The whole scene seemed to me like a dream or a vision.  After a few minutes the Lord Chancellor came forward and presented the speech to the Queen.  She read it sitting and most exquisitely.  Her voice is flute-like and her whole emphasis decided and intelligent.  Very soon after the speech is finished she leaves the House, and we all follow, as soon as we can get our carriages.     [Picture: The Duke of Wellington.  From the portrait by Count Alfred        D’Orsay; photograph copyright by Walker & Cockerell, London]  Lord Lansdowne told me before she came in that the speech would be longer than usual, “but not so long as your President’s speeches.”  It has been a day of high pleasure and more like a romance than a reality to me, and being in the very midst of it as I was, made it more striking than if I had looked on from a distant gallery.    _To W. D. B. and A. B._                                                    LONDON, February 7, 1847.  MY DEAR SONS: . . . On Friday we dined with two bachelors, Mr. Peabody and Mr. Coates, who are American bankers.  Mr. Peabody is a friend of Mr. Corcoran and was formerly a partner of Mr. Riggs in Baltimore.  Mr. Coates is of Boston. . . . They mustered up all the Americans that could be found, and we dined with twenty-six of our countrymen.                                                             Monday Morning.  Last evening we were at home to see any Americans who might chance to come. . . . I make tea in the drawing-room, on a little table with a white cloth, which would not be esteemed _comme il faut_ with us.  There is none of the parade of eating in the largest evening party here.  I see nothing but tea, and sometimes find an informal refreshment table in the room where we put on our cloaks.  I got a note yesterday from the O’Connor Don, enclosing an order to admit me to the House of Commons on Monday. . . . You will be curious to know who is “The O’Connor Don.”  He is Dennis O’Connor, Esq., but is of the oldest family in Ireland, and the representative of the last kings of Connaught.  He is called altogether the O’Connor Don, and begins his note to me with that title.  You remember Campbell’s poem of “O’Connor’s Child”?                                                      Sunday, 14th February.  . . . Yesterday morning was my breakfast at Sir Robert Inglis’s.  The hour was halfpast nine, and as his house is two miles off I had to be up wondrous early for me.  The weather has been very cold for this climate for the last few days, though we should think it moderate.  They know nothing of extreme cold here.  But, to return to or breakfast, where, notwithstanding the cold, the guests were punctually assembled: The Marquis of Northampton and his sisters, the Bishop of London with his black apron, Sir Stratford Canning, Mr. Rutherford, Lord Advocate for Scotland, the Solicitor-General and one or two others.  The conversation was very agreeable and I enjoyed my first specimen of an English breakfast exceedingly. . . . Our invitations jostle each other, now Parliament has begun, for everybody invites on Wednesday, Saturday, or Sunday, when there are no debates.  We had three dinner invitations for next Wednesday, from Mr. Harcourt, Marquis of Anglesey, and Mrs. Mansfield.  We go to the former.  The Queen held a levée on Friday, for gentlemen only.  Your father went, of course.     [Picture: Sir Stratford Canning.  From the drawing by Richmond, make           about 1848, by permission of the Hon. Louisa Canning]                                                      Sunday, February 21st.  I left off on Sunday, on which day I got a note from Lady Morgan, saying that she wished us to come and meet some agreeables at her house. . . . There I met Sir William and Lady Molesworth, Sir Benjamin Hall, etc., and had a long talk with “Eōthen,” who is a quiet, unobtrusive person in manner, though his book is quite an effervescence. . . . On Wednesday we dined with Mr. Harcourt, and met there Lord Brougham, who did the talking chiefly, Lord and Lady Mahon, Mr. Labouchere, etc.  It was a most agreeable party, and we were very glad to meet Lord Brougham, whom we had not before seen.  Lord Brougham is entertaining, and very much listened to.  Indeed, the English habit seems to be to suffer a few people to do up a great part of the talking, such as Macaulay, Brougham, and Sydney Smith and Mackintosh in their day. . . . On Saturday evening, at ten o’clock, we went to a little party at Lady Stratheden’s.  After staying there three-quarters of an hour we went to Lady Palmerston’s, where were all the _great_ London world, the Duchess of Sutherland among the number.  She is most noble, and at the same time lovely. . . . We had an autograph note from Sir Robert Peel, inviting us to dine next Saturday, and were engaged.  I hope they will ask us again, for I know few things better than to see him, as we should in dining there.  I have the same interest in seeing the really distinguished men of England, that I should have in the pictures and statues of Rome, and indeed, much greater.  I wish I was better prepared for my life here by a more extensive culture; mere fine ladyism will not do, or prosy bluism, but one needs for a thorough enjoyment of society, a healthy, practical, and extensive culture, and a use of the modern languages in our position would be convenient.  I do not know how a gentleman can get on without it here, and I find it so desirable that I devote a good deal of time to speaking French with Louisa’s governess. Your father uses French a great deal with his colleagues, who, many of them, speak English with great difficulty, and some not at all. . . . Lady Charlotte Lindsay came one day this week to engage us to dine with her on Wednesday, but yesterday she came to say that she wanted Lord Brougham to meet us, and he could not come till Friday.  Fortunately we had no dinner engagement on that day, and we are to meet also the Miss Berrys; Horace Walpole’s Miss Berrys, who with Lady Charlotte herself, are the last remnants of the old school here.    _To I.
