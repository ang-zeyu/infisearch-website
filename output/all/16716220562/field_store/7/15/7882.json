The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.  Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.  Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\" but stopped at the first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.     STAVE TWO  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS   When Scrooge awoke it was so dark, that, looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.  To his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!  He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped.  \"Why, it isn't possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!\"  The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This was a great relief, because \"Three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,\" and so forth, would have become a mere United States security if there were no days to count by.  Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and, the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.  Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, \"Was it a dream or not?\"  Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was, perhaps, the wisest resolution in his power.  The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening ear.  \"Ding, dong!\"  \"A quarter past,\" said Scrooge, counting.  \"Ding, dong!\"  \"Half past,\" said Scrooge.  \"Ding, dong!\"  \"A quarter to it,\" said Scrooge.  \"Ding, dong!\"  \"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\"  He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.  The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.  It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand: and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.  Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was _not_ its strangest quality. For, as its belt sparkled and glittered, now in one part and now in another, and what was light one instant at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And, in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.  \"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?\" asked Scrooge.  \"I am!\"  The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if, instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.  \"Who and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.  \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"  \"Long Past?\" inquired Scrooge; observant of its dwarfish stature.  \"No. Your past.\"  Perhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.  \"What!\" exclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out, with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow?\"  Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.  \"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.  Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately:  \"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"  It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the arm.  \"Rise! and walk with me!\"  It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not to be resisted. He rose: but, finding that the Spirit made towards the window, clasped its robe in supplication.  \"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"  \"Bear but a touch of my hand _there_,\" said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more than this!\"  As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with the snow upon the ground.  \"Good Heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together as he looked about him. \"I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!\"  The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man's sense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long forgotten!  \"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is that upon your cheek?\"  Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.  \"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.  \"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could walk it blindfold.\"  \"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed the Ghost. \"Let us go on.\"  [Illustration: _\"You recollect the way?\" inquired the spirit. \"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19337"],["title","A Christmas Carol (#5)"],["body","our; \"I could walk it blindfold.\"_]  They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree, until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it.  \"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said the Ghost. \"They have no consciousness of us.\"  The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several homes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?  \"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.\"  Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.  They left the high-road by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes: for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast. There was an earthly savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.  They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he had used to be.  Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.  The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.  \"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \"It's dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him? And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii: there he is upon his head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had _he_ to be married to the Princess?\"  To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the City, indeed.  [Illustration: _\"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \"It's dear old honest Ali Baba.\"_]  \"There's the Parrot!\" cried Scrooge. \"Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?' The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\"  Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor boy!\" and cried again.  \"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: \"but it's too late now.\"  \"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.  \"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something: that's all.\"  The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying, as it did so, \"Let us see another Christmas!\"  Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct: that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.  He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.  It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her \"dear, dear brother.\"  \"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. \"To bring you home, home, home!\"  \"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.  \"Yes!\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home for good and all. Home for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And you're to be a man!\" said the child, opening her eyes; \"and are never to come back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.\"  \"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.  She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but, being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.  A terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master Scrooge's box, there!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of \"something\" to the postboy who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick wheels dashing the hoar frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.  \"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,\" said the Ghost. \"But she had a large heart!\"  \"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You're right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!\"  \"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think, children.\"  \"One child,\" Scrooge returned.  \"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"  Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, \"Yes.\"  Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.  The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it.  \"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was I apprenticed here?\"  They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:  \"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!\"  Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:  \"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"  Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.  \"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost. \"Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!\"  \"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-nig"]]]
