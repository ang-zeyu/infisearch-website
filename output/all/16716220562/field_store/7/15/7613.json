THE RETURN                                   by                   H. Beam Piper and John J.

Next he scraped the last morsel from his plate and ate it.  \"What did you make this out of, Jim?\" he asked. \"I hope you kept notes while you were concocting it. It's good.\"  \"The two smoked pork chops left over from yesterday evening,\" Loudons said, \"and that bowl of rice that's been taking up space in the refrigerator the last couple of days, together with a little egg powder and some milk. I ground the chops up and mixed them with the rice and other stuff. Then added some bacon, to make grease to fry it in.\"  Altamont chuckled. That was Loudons, all right: he could take a few left-overs, mess them together, pop them in the skillet, and have a meal that would turn the chef back at the Fort green with envy. He filled his cup and offered the pot.  \"Caffchoc?\" he asked.  Loudons held his cup out to be filled, blew on it, sipped, and then hunted on the ledge under the desk for the butt of the cigar he had half-smoked the evening before.  \"Did you ever drink coffee, Monty?\" the socio-psychologist asked, getting the cigar drawing to his taste.  \"Coffee? No. I've read about it, of course. We'll have to organize an expedition to Brazil, sometime, to get seeds and try raising some.\"  Loudons blew a smoke ring toward the rear of the cabin.  \"A much overrated beverage,\" he replied. \"We found some, once, when I was on that expedition into Idaho, in what must have been the stockroom of a hotel. Vacuum-packed in moisture-proof containers, and free from radioactivity. It wasn't nearly as good as caffchoc.  \"But then, I suppose, a pre-bustup coffee drinker couldn't stomach this stuff we're drinking.\"  Loudons looked forward, up the river they were following. \"Get anything on the radio?\" he asked. \"I noticed you took us up to about ten thousand, while I was shaving.\"  Altamont got out his pipe and tobacco pouch, filling the former slowly and carefully.  \"Not a whisper. I tried Colony Three, in the Ozarks, and I tried to call in that tribe of workers in Louisiana. I couldn't get either.\"  \"Maybe if we tried to get a little more power on the set....\"  That was Loudons, too, Altamont thought. There wasn't a better man at the Fort, when it came to dealing with people. But confront him with a problem about things and he was lost.  That was one of the reasons why he and the stocky, phlegmatic social scientist made such a good team, he thought. As far as he, himself, was concerned, people were just a mysterious, exasperatingly unpredictable order of things which were subject to no known natural laws.  And Loudons thought the same thing about machines: he couldn't psychoanalyze them.  Altamont gestured with his pipe toward the nuclear-electric conversion unit, between the control-cabin and the living quarters in the rear of the boxcar-sized helicopter.  \"We have enough power back there to keep this windmill in the air twenty-four hours a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, for the next fifteen years,\" he said. \"We just don't have enough radio. If I'd step up the power on this set any more, it'd burn out before I could say, 'Altamont calling Fort Ridgeway.'\"  \"How far are we from Pittsburgh now?\" Loudons wanted to know.  Altamont looked across the cabin at the big map of the United States as they had been, the red and green and blue and yellow patchwork of vanished political divisions. The colors gleamed through the transparent overlay on which this voyage of re-discovery was plotted.  The red line of their journey started at Fort Ridgeway, in what had been Arizona. It angled east by a little north, to Colony Three, in northern Arkansas ... sharply northeast to St. Louis and its lifeless ruins ... then to Chicago and Gary, where little bands of Stone Age reversions stalked and fought and ate each other ... Detroit, where things that had completely forgotten they were human emerged from their burrows only at night ... Cleveland, where a couple of cobalt bombs must have landed in the lake and drenched everything with radioactivity that still lingered after two centuries ... Akron, where vegetation was only beginning to break through the glassy slag ... Cincinnati, where they had last stopped....  \"How's the leg this morning, Jim?\" he asked.  \"Little stiff. Doesn't hurt much, though.\"  \"Why, we're about fifty miles, as we follow that river, and that's relatively straight.\" He looked down through the transparent nose of the copter at a town, now choked with trees that grew among the tumbled walls. \"I think that's Aliquippa.\"  Loudons looked and shrugged, then looked again and pointed.  \"There's a bear. Just ducked into that church or movie theater or whatever. I wonder what he thinks we are.\"  Altamont puffed slowly at his pipe. \"I wonder if we're going to find anything at all in Pittsburgh.\"  \"You mean people, as distinct from those biped beasts we've found so far? I doubt it,\" Loudons replied, finishing his caffchoc and wiping his mustache with the back of his hand. \"I think the whole eastern half of the country is nothing but forest like this, and the highest type of life is just about three cuts below Homo Neanderthalensis, almost impossible to contact, and even more impossible to educate.\"  \"I wasn't thinking about that. I've just about given up hope of finding anybody or even a reasonably high level of barbarism,\" Altamont said. \"I was thinking about that cache of microfilmed books that was buried at the Carnegie Library.\"  \"If it was buried,\" Loudons qualified. \"All we have is that article in that two-century-old copy of Time about how the people at the library had constructed the crypt and were beginning the microfilming. We don't know if they ever had a chance to get it finished, before the rockets started landing.\"  They passed over a dam of flotsam that had banked up at a wrecked bridge and accumulated enough mass to resist the periodic floods that had kept the river usually clear. Three human figures fled across a sand-flat at one end of it and disappeared into the woods. Two of them carried spears tipped with something that sparkled in the sunlight, probably shards of glass.  \"You know, Monty, I get nightmares, sometimes, thinking about what things must be like in Europe,\" Loudons said.  Five or six wild cows went crashing through the brush below. Altamont nodded when he saw them.  \"Maybe tomorrow, we'll let down and shoot a cow,\" he said. \"I was looking in the freeze-locker and the fresh meat's getting a little low. Or a wild pig, if we find a good stand of oak trees. I could enjoy what you'd do with some acorn-fed pork.\"  He looked across the table. \"Finished?\" he asked Loudons. \"Take over, then. I'll go back and wash the dishes.\"  They rose, and Loudons, favoring his left leg, moved over to the seat at the controls.  Altamont gathered up the two cups, the stainless-steel dishes, and the knives and the forks and spoons, going up the steps over the shielded converter and ducking his head to avoid the seat in the forward top machine-gun turret. He washed and dried the dishes, noting with satisfaction that the gauge of the water tank was still reasonably high, and glanced out one of the windows. Loudons was taking the big helicopter upstairs, for a better view.  Now and then, among the trees, there would be a glint of glassy slag, usually in a fairly small circle. That was to be expected: beside the three or four H-bombs that had fallen on the Pittsburgh area, mentioned in the transcripts of the last news to reach the Fort from the outside, the whole district had been pelted, more or less at random, with fission bombs.  West of the confluence of the Allegheny and the Monongahela, it would probably be worse than this.  \"Can you see Pittsburgh yet, Jim?\" he called out.  \"Yes, it's a mess! Worse than Gary, worse than Akron even.\"  \"Monty! Come here! I think I have something!\"  Picking up the pipe he had laid down, Altamont hurried forward, dodging his six-foot length under the gun turret and swinging down from the walkway over the converter.  \"What is it?\" he asked.  \"Smoke. A lot of smoke, twenty or thirty fires at the very least.\"  Loudons had shifted from Forward to Hover and was peering through a pair of binoculars. \"See that island, the long one? Across the river from it, on the north side, toward this end. Yes, by Einstein! And I can see cleared ground, and what I think are houses, inside a stockade....\"     II   Murray Hughes walked around the corner of the cabin into the morning sunlight, lacing his trousers, with his hunting shirt thrown over his bare shoulders. He found, without much surprise, that his father had also slept late. Verner Hughes was just beginning to shave.  Inside the kitchen, his mother and the girls were clattering pots and skillets.  Outside the kitchen door, his younger brother, Hector, was noisily chopping wood.  Going through the door, he filled another of the light-metal basins with hot water, found his razor, and went outside again, setting the basin on the bench.  Most of the ware in the Hughes cabin was of light-metal. Murray and his father had mined it in the dead city up the river, from a place where it had floated to the top of a puddle of slag, back when the city had been blasted, at the end of the hard times.  It had been hard work, but the stuff had been easy to carry down to where they had hidden their boat. And, for once, they'd had no trouble with the Scowrers.  Too bad they couldn't say as much for yesterday's "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19158"],["title","The Return (#1)"],["body","trip!  As he rubbed lather into the stubble on his face, he cursed with irritation. That had been a bad-luck hunt, all around.  They had gone out before dawn, hunting into the hills to the north. They'd spent the day at it, and shot one small wild pig. Lucky it was small, at that. They'd have had to abandon a full-grown one, after the Scowrers had began hunting them. Six of them, as big a band as he'd ever seen together at one time, had managed to cut them off from the stockade. He and his father had been forced to circle miles out of their way.  His father had shot one, and he'd had to leave his hatchet sticking in the skull of another, when his rifle had misfired.  That meant a trip to the gunsmith's, for a new hatchet and to have the mainspring of the rifle replaced. Nobody could afford to have a rifle that couldn't be trusted, least of all a hunter and prospector.  On top of everything else, he had had a few words with Alex Barrett, the gunsmith, the other day.  Well, at least that could be smoothed over. Barrett would be glad to do business with him, once the gunsmith saw that hard tool-steel he had dug out of that place down the river. Hardest steel either he or his father had ever found, and it hadn't been atom-spoiled, either.  He cleaned, wiped and stropped his razor and put it back in the case. He threw out the wash-water on the compost pile and went into the cabin, putting on his shirt and his belt. Then he passed through to the front porch, where his father was already eating at the table.  The people of the Toon like to eat in the open. It was something they'd always done, just as they'd always like to eat together in the evenings.  He sweetened his cup of chicory with a lump of maple sugar and began to sip it before he sat down, standing with one foot on the bench and looking down across the parade ground, past the Aitch-Cue House, toward the river and the wall.  \"If you're coming around to Alex's way of thinking--and mine--it won't hurt you to admit it, son,\" his father said.  Murray turned, looking at his father with the beginning of anger, and then he grinned. The elders were constantly keeping the young men alert with these tests. He checked back over his actions since he had come out onto the porch.  ... to the table, sugar in his chicory, one foot on the bench ... which had reminded him again of the absence of the hatchet from his belt and brought an automatic frown ... then the glance toward the gunsmith's shop, and across the parade ground ... the glance including the houses into which so much labor had gone, the wall that had been built from rubble and topped with pointed stakes, the white slabs of marble that marked the graves of the First Tenant and the men of the Old Toon....  He had thought, at that moment, that maybe his father and Alex Barrett and Reader Rawson and Tenant Mycroft Jones and the others were right: there were too many things here that could not be moved along with them, if they decided to move.  It would be false modesty, refusal to see things as they were, not to admit that he was the leader of the younger men, and the boys of the Irregulars. He had been forced to face the responsibilities of that fact since last winter.  Then, the usual theological arguments about the proper order of the Sacred Books and the true nature of the Risen One had been replaced by a violent controversy when Sholto Jiminez and Birdy Edwards had reopened the old question of the advisability of moving the Toon and settling elsewhere.  He had been in favor of the idea himself and found that the other young men had followed his lead. But, for the last month or so, he had begun to doubt the wisdom of it.  It was probably reluctance to admit this to himself that had brought on the strained feelings between himself and his old friend, the gunsmith.  \"I'll have to drill the Irregulars, today,\" he said. \"Birdy Edwards has been drilling them while we've been hunting. But I'll go up and see Alex about a new hatchet and fixing my rifle. I'll have a talk with him.\"  He stepped forward to the edge of the porch, still munching on a honey-dipped piece of cornbread, and glanced up at the sky. That was a queer bird; he had never seen a bird with a wing action like that.  Then he realized that the object was not a bird at all.  His father was staring at it, too.  \"Murray! That's ... that's like the old stories from the time of the wars!\"  But Murray was already racing across the parade ground toward the Aitch-Cue House, where the big iron ring hung by its chain from a gallows-like post, with a hammer beside it.     III   The stockaded village became larger, details grew plainer, as the helicopter came slanting down and began spiraling around it.  It was a fairly big place, some forty or fifty acres in a rough parallelogram, surrounded by a wall of varicolored stone and brick and concrete rubble from old ruins, topped with a palisade of pointed poles. There was a small jetty projecting into the river, to which six or eight boats of different sorts were tied; a gate opened onto this from the wall.  Inside the stockade, there were close to a hundred buildings, ranging from small cabins to a structure with a belfry. It seemed to have been a church, partly ruined in the war of two centuries ago and later rebuilt.  A stream came down from the woods, across the cultivated land around the fortified village. There was a rough flume which carried the water from a dam close to the edge of the forest and provided a fall to turn a mill wheel.  \"Look, strip farming,\" Loudons pointed. \"See the alternate strips of grass and plowed ground. These people understand soil conservation.  \"They have horses, too.\"  As he spoke, three riders left the village at a gallop. They separated, and the people in the fields, who had all started for the village, turned and began hurrying toward the woods. Two of the riders headed for a pasture in which cattle had been grazing and started herding them also into the woods.  For a while, there was a scurrying of little figures in the village below. Then, not a moving thing was in sight.  \"There's good organization,\" Loudons said. \"Everybody seems to know what to do, and how to get it done promptly. And look how neat the whole place is. Policed up. I'll bet anything we'll find that they have a military organization, or a military tradition at least.  \"We'll have a lot to find out: you can't understand a people until you understand their background and their social organization.\"  \"Humph. Let me have a look at their artifacts: that will tell what kind of people they are,\" Altamont said, swinging the glasses back and forth over the enclosure. \"Water-power mill, water-power sawmill--building on the left side of the water wheel, see the pile of fresh lumber beside it. Blacksmith shop, and from that chimney, I'd say a small foundry, too.  \"Wonder what that little building out on the tip of the island is, it has a water wheel too. Undershot wheel, and it looks like it could be raised or lowered. Now, I wonder....\"  \"Monty, I think we ought to land right in the middle of the enclosure, on that open plaza thing, in front of the building that looks like a reconditioned church. That's probably the Royal Palace, or the Pentagon, or the Kremlin, or whatever.\"  Altamont started to object, paused, and then nodded. \"I think you're right, Jim. From the way they scattered, and got their livestock into the woods, they probably expect us to bomb them. We have to get inside and that's the quickest way to do it.\" He thought for a moment. \"We'd better be armed, when we go out. Pistols, auto-carbines, and a few of those concussion-grenades in case we have to break up a concerted attack. I'll get them.\"  The plaza, the houses and the cabins around it, the two-hundred-year-old church, all were silent and apparently lifeless as they set the helicopter down. Once Loudons caught a movement inside the door of a house, and saw a metallic glint.  \"There's a gun up there,\" he said. \"Looks like a four-pounder. Brass. I knew that smith-shop was also a foundry. See that little curl of smoke? That's the gunner's slow-match.  \"I'd thought maybe that thing on the island was a powder mill. That would be where they'd put it. Probably extract their niter from the dung of their horses and cows. Sulfur probably from coal-mine drainage.  \"Jim, this is really something!\"  \"I hope they don't cut loose with that thing,\" Loudons said, looking apprehensively at the brass-rimmed black muzzle that was covering them from the belfry. \"I wonder if we ought to--Oh-oh, here they come!\"  Three or four young men stepped out of the wide door of the old church. They wore fringed buckskin trousers and buckskin shirts and odd caps of deerskin with visors to shade the eyes and similar beaks behind to protect the neck. They had powder horns and bullet pouches slung over their shoulders, and long rifles in their hands. They stepped aside as soon as they were out. Carefully avoiding any gesture of menace, they simply stood, watching the helicopter which had landed in their village.  Three other men followed them out. They, too, wore buckskins and the odd double-visored caps. One had a close-cropped white beard, and on the shoulders of his buckskin shirt, he wore the single silver bars of a first lieutenant of the vanished United States Army. He had a pistol on his belt. The pistol had the saw-handle grip of an automatic, but it was a flintlock, as were the rifles of the young men who stood so watchfully on either side of the door.  Two middle-aged men accompanied the bearded man and the trio advanced toward the helicopter.  \"All right, come on, Monty.\"  Loudons opened the door and let down the steps. Picking up an auto-carbine, he slung it and stepped out of the helicopter, Altamont behind him. They advanced to meet the party from the church, halting when they were about twenty feet apart.  \"I must apologize, lieutenant, for dropping in on you so"]]]
