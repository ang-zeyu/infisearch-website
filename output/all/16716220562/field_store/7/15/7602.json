The fit was not exact, but he surmised that Kurt had chosen as well as possible. A final door opened, and they stepped out into the polar night of winter. Kurt's mittened hand grasped Ross's, pulling him along. Together, they pushed back the door of a hangar shed to get at their escape vehicle.  The cat was a strange machine, but Ross was given no time to study it. He was shoved into the cockpit, a bubble covering settled down over them, closing them in, and the engine came to life under Kurt's urging. The cat must be traveling at its best pace, Ross thought. Yet the crawl which took them away from the mounded snow covering the base seemed hardly better than a man could make afoot.  For a short time Kurt headed straight away from the starting point, but Ross soon heard him counting slowly to himself as if he were timing something. At the count of twenty the cat swung to the right and made a wide half circle which was copied at the next count of twenty by a similar sweep in the opposite direction. After this pattern had been repeated for six turns, Ross found it difficult to guess whether they had ever returned to their first course. When Kurt stopped counting he asked, \"Why the dance pattern?\"  \"Would you rather be scattered in little pieces all over the landscape?\" the other snapped. \"The base doesn't need fences two miles high to keep us in, or others out; they take other precautions. You should thank fortune we got through that first mine field without blowing....\"  Ross swallowed, but he refused to let Kurt know that he was rattled. \"So it isn't as easy to get away as you said?\"  \"Shut up!\" Kurt began counting again, and Ross had some cold apprehensive moments in which to reflect upon the folly of quick decisions and wonder bleakly why he had not thought things through before he leaped.  Again they sketched a weaving pattern in the snow, but this time the arcs formed acute angles. Ross glanced now and then at the intent man at the wheel. How had Kurt managed to memorize this route? His urge to escape the base must certainly be a strong one.  Back and forth they crawled, gaining only a few yards in each of those angled strikes to right or left.  \"Good thing these cats are atomic powered,\" Kurt commented during one of the intervals between mine fields. \"We'd run out of fuel otherwise.\"  Ross fought down the impulse to move his feet away from any possible contact point with the engine. These machines must be safe to ride in, but the bogy of radiation was frightening. Luckily, Kurt was now back to a straight track, with no more weaving.  \"We are out!\" Kurt said with exultation. But he added no more than just the reassurance of their escape.  The cat crawled on. To Ross's eyes there was no trail to follow, no guideposts, yet Kurt steered ahead with confidence. A little later he pulled to a stop and said to Ross, \"We have to drive turn and turn about--your turn.\"  Ross was dubious. \"Well, I can drive a car--but this----\"  \"Is fool proof.\" Kurt caught him up. \"The worst was getting through the mine fields, and we are out of that now. See here--\" his hand made a shadow on the lighted instrument panel, \"this will keep you straight. If you can steer a car, you can steer this. Watch!\" He started up again and once more swung the cat to the left.  A light on the panel began to blink at a rate which increased rapidly as they veered farther away from their original course.  \"See? You keep that light steady, and you are on course. If it begins to blink, you cast about until it steadies again. Simple enough for a baby. Take over and see.\"  It was hard to change places in the sealed cabin of the cat, but they were successful, and Ross took the wheel gingerly. Following Kurt's directions, he started ahead, his eyes focused on the light rather than the white expanse before him. And after a few minutes of strain he caught the hang of it. As Kurt had promised, it was very simple. After watching him for a while, his instructor gave a grunt of satisfaction and settled down for a nap.  Once the first excitement of driving the cat wore off, the operation tended to become monotonous. Ross caught himself yawning, but he kept at his post with dogged stubbornness. This had been Kurt's game all the way through--so far--and he was certainly not going to resign his first chance to show that he could be of use also. If there had only been some break in the eternal snow, some passing light or goal to be seen ahead, it would not have been so bad. Finally, every now and then, Ross had to jiggle off course just enough so that the warning blink of light would alert him and keep him from falling asleep. He was unaware that Kurt had awakened during one of those maneuvers until the other spoke. \"Your own private alarm clock, Murdock? Okay, I do not quarrel with anyone who uses his head. But you had better get some shut-eye, or we will not keep rolling.\"  Ross was too tired to protest. They changed places, and he curled up as best he could on his small share of seat. Only now that he was free to sleep, he realized he no longer wanted to. Kurt must have thought Ross had fallen asleep, for after perhaps two miles of steady grinding along, he moved cautiously behind the wheel. Ross saw by the trace of light from the instrument panel that his companion was digging into the breast of his parka to bring out a small object which he held against the wheel of the cat with one hand, while with the other he tapped out an irregular rhythm.  To Ross the action made no sense. But he did not miss the other's sigh of relief as he restored his treasure to hiding once more, as if some difficult task was now behind him. Shortly afterward the cat ground to a stop, and Ross sat up, rubbing his eyes. \"What's the matter? Engine trouble?\"  Kurt had folded his arms across the wheel. \"No. It is just that we are to wait here----\"  \"Wait? For what? Kelgarries to come along and pick us up?\"  Kurt laughed. \"The major? How I wish that he _would_ arrive presently. What a surprise he would receive! Not two little mice to be put back into their cages, but the tiger cat, all claws and fangs!\"  Ross sat up straighter. This now had the bad smell of a frame, a frame with himself planted right in the middle. He figured out the possibilities and came up with an answer which would smear Ross Murdock all over any map. If Kurt were waiting to meet friends out here, they could only be of one brand.  For most of his short life Ross had been engaged in a private war against the restrictions imposed upon him by a set of legal rules to which something within him would not conform. And he had, during those same years filled with attacks, retreats, and strategic maneuvering, formulated a code of rules by which to play his dangerous game. He had not murdered, and he would never follow the path Kurt took. To one who was supremely impatient of restraint, the methods and aims of Kurt's employers were not only impossibly fantastic and illogical--they were to be opposed to the last ounce of any man's energy.  \"Your friends late?\" He tried to sound casual.  \"Not yet, and if you now plan to play the hero, Murdock, think better of it!\" Kurt's tone held the crack of an order--that note Ross had so much disliked in the major's voice. \"This is an operation which has been most carefully planned and upon which a great deal depends. No one shall spoil it for us now----\"  \"The Reds planted you on the project, eh?\" Ross wanted to keep the other talking to give himself a chance to think. And this was one time he had to think, clearly and with speed.  \"There is no need for me to tell you the sad tale of my life, Murdock. And you would doubtless find much of it boring. If you wish to continue to live--for a while, at least--you will remain quiet and do as you are told.\"  Kurt must be armed, for he would not be so confident unless he had a weapon he could now turn on Ross. On the other hand, if what Ross guessed were true, this _was_ the time to play the hero--when there was only Kurt to handle. Better to be a dead hero than a live captive in the hands of Kurt's dear friends across the pole.  Without warning, Ross threw his body to the left, striving to pin Kurt against the driver's side of the cabin, his hands clawing at the fur ruff bordering the other's hood, trying for a throat hold. Perhaps it was Kurt's over-confidence which betrayed him and left him open to a surprise attack. He struggled hard to bring up his arm, but both his weight and Ross's held him tight. Ross caught at his wrist, noticing a gleam of metal.  They threshed about, the bulkiness of the fur clothing hampering them. Ross wondered fleetingly why the other had not made sure of him earlier. As it was he fought with all his vigor to keep Kurt immobile, to try and knock him out with a lucky blow.  In the end Kurt aided in his own defeat. When Ross relaxed somewhat, the other pushed against him, only to have Ross flinch to one side. Kurt could not stop himself, and his head cracked against the wheel of the cat. He went limp.  Ross made the most of the next few moments. He brought his belt from under his parka, twisting it around Kurt's wrists with no gentleness. Then he wriggled about, changing places with the unconscious man.  He had no idea of where to go, but he was sure he was going to get away--at the cat's top speed--from that point. And with that in mind and only a limited knowledge of how to manage the machine, Ross started up and turned in a wide circle until he was sure the cat was headed in the opposite direction.  The light which had guided them was still on. Would reversing its process take him back to the base? Lost in the immensity of the cold wilderness, he made the only choice possible and gunned the cat again.     CHAPTER 4   Once again Ross sat waiting for others to decide his future. He was as outwardly composed as he had been in Judge Rawle's chambers, but inwardly he was far more apprehensive."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],["title","The Time Traders (#6)"],["body"," in the wilderness of the polar night he had had no chance for escape. Heading away from Kurt's rendezvous, Ross had run straight into the search party from the base, had seen in action that mechanical hound that Kurt had said they would put on the fugitives' trail--the thing which would have gone on hunting them until its metal rusted into powder. Kurt's boasted immunity to that tracker had not been as good as he had believed, though it had won them a start.  Ross did not know just how much it might count in his favor that he had been on his way back, with Kurt a prisoner in the cat. As his waiting hours wore on he began to think it might mean very little indeed. This time there was no show on the wall of his cell, nothing but time to think--too much of that--and no pleasant things to think about.  But he had learned one valuable lesson on that cold expedition. Kelgarries and the others at the base were the most formidable opponents he had ever met, and all the balance of luck and equipment lay on their side of the scales. Ross was now convinced that there could be no escape from this base. He had been impressed by Kurt's preparations, knowing that some of them were far beyond anything he himself could have devised. He did not doubt that Kurt had come here fully prepared with every ingenious device the Reds could supply.  At least Kurt's friends had had a rude welcome when they did arrive at the meeting place. Kelgarries had heard Ross out and then had sent ahead a team. Before Ross's party had reached the base there had been a blast which split the arctic night wide open. And Kurt, conscious by then, had shown his only sign of emotion when he realized what it meant.  The door to Ross's cell room clicked, and he swung his feet to the floor, sitting up on his bunk to face his future. This time he made no attempt to put on an act. He was not in the least sorry he had tried to get away. Had Kurt been on the level, it would have been a bright play. That Kurt was not, was just plain bad luck.  Kelgarries and Ashe entered, and at the sight of Ashe the taut feeling in Ross's middle loosened a bit. The major might come by himself to pass sentence, but he would not bring Ashe along if the sentence was a really harsh one.  \"You got off to a bad start here, Murdock.\" The major sat down on the edge of the wall shelf which doubled as a table. \"You're going to have a second chance, so consider yourself lucky. We know you aren't another plant of our enemies, a fact that saves your neck. Do you have anything to add to your story?\"  \"No, sir.\" He was not adding that \"sir\" to curry any favor; it came naturally when one answered Kelgarries.  \"But you have some questions?\"  Ross met that with the truth. \"A lot of them.\"  \"Why don't you ask them?\"  Ross smiled thinly, an expression far removed and years older than his bashful boy's grin of the shy act. \"A wise guy doesn't spill his ignorance. He uses his eyes and ears and keeps his trap shut----\"  \"And goes off half cocked as a result...\" the major added. \"I don't think you would have enjoyed the company of Kurt's paymaster.\"  \"I didn't know about him then--not when I left here.\"  \"Yes, and when you discovered the truth, you took steps. Why?\" For the first time there was a trace of feeling in the major's voice.  \"Because I don't like the line-up on his side of the fence.\"'  \"That single fact has saved your neck this time, Murdock. Step out of line once more, and nothing will help you. But just so we won't have to worry about that, suppose you ask a few of those questions.\"  \"How much of what Kurt fed me is the truth?\" Ross blurted out. \"I mean all that stuff about shooting back in time.\"  \"All of it.\" The major said it so quietly that it carried complete conviction.  \"But why--how--?\"  \"You have us on a spot, Murdock. Because of your little expedition, we have to tell you more now than we tell any of our men before the final briefing. Listen, and then forget all of it except what applies to the job at hand.  \"The Reds shot up Sputnik and then Muttnik.... When--? Twenty-five years ago. We got up our answers a little later. There were a couple of spectacular crashes on the moon, then that space station that didn't stay in orbit, after that--stalemate. In the past quarter century we've had no voyages into space, nothing that was prophesied. Too many bugs, too many costly failures. Finally we began to get hints of something big, bigger than any football roaming the heavens.  \"Any discovery in science comes about by steps. It can be traced back through those steps by another scientist. But suppose you were confronted by a result which apparently had been produced without any preliminaries. What would be your guess concerning it?\"  Ross stared at the major. Although he didn't see what all this had to do with time-jumping, he sensed that Kelgarries was waiting for a serious answer, that somehow Ross would be judged by his reply.  \"Either that the steps were kept strictly secret,\" he said slowly, \"or that the result didn't rightfully belong to the man who said he discovered it.\"  For the first time the major regarded him with approval. \"Suppose this discovery was vital to your life--what would you do?\"  \"Try to find the source!\"  \"There you have it! Within the past five years our friends across the way have come up with three such discoveries. One we were able to trace, duplicate, and use, with a few refinements of our own. The other two remain rootless; yet they are linked with the first. We are now attempting to solve that problem, and the time grows late. For some reason, though the Reds now have their super, super gadgets, they are not yet ready to use them. Sometimes the things work, and sometimes they fail. Everything points to the fact that the Reds are now experimenting with discoveries which are not basically their own----\"  \"Where did they get them? From another world?\" Ross's imagination came to life. Had a successful space voyage been kept secret? Had there been contact made with another intelligent race?  \"In a way it's another world, but the world of time--not space. Seven years ago we got a man out of East Berlin. He was almost dead, but he lived long enough to record on tape some amazing data, so wild it was almost dismissed as the ravings of delirium. But that was after Sputnik, and we didn't dare disregard any hints from the other side of the Iron Curtain. So the recording was turned over to our scientists, who proved it had a core of truth.  \"Time travel has been written up in fiction; it has been discussed otherwise as an impossibility. Then we discover that the Reds have it working----\"  \"You mean, they go into the future and bring back machines to use now.\"  The major shook his head. \"Not the future, the past.\"  Was this an elaborate joke? Somewhat heatedly Ross snapped out the answer to that. \"Look here, I know I haven't the education of your big brains, but I do know that the farther back you go into history the simpler things are. We ride in cars; only a hundred years ago men drove horses. We have guns; go back a little and you'll find them waving swords and shooting guys with bows and arrows--those that don't wear tin plate on them to stop being punctured----\"  \"Only they were, after all,\" commented Ashe. \"Look at Agincourt, m'lad, and remember what arrows did to the French knights in armor.\"  Ross disregarded the interruption. \"Anyway\"--he stuck doggedly to his point--\"the farther back you go, the simpler things are. How are the Reds going to find anything in history we can't beat today?\"  \"That is a point which has baffled us for several years now,\" the major returned. \"Only it is not _how_ they are going to find it, but _where_. Because somewhere in the past of this world they have contacted a civilization able to produce weapons and ideas so advanced as to baffle our experts. We have to find that source and either mine it ourselves or close it off. As yet we're still trying to find it.\"  Ross shook his head. \"It must be a long way back. Those guys who discover tombs and dig up old cities--couldn't they give you some hints? Wouldn't a civilization like that have left something we could find today?\"  \"It depends,\" Ashe remarked, \"upon the type of civilization. The Egyptians built in stone, grandly. They used tools and weapons of copper, bronze, and stone, and they were considerate enough to operate in a dry climate which preserved relics well. The cities of the Fertile Crescent built in mud brick and used stone, copper, and bronze tools. They also chose a portion of the world where climate was a factor in keeping their memory green.  \"The Greeks built in stone, wrote their books, kept their history to bequeath it to their successors, and so did the Romans. And on this side of the ocean the Incas, the Mayas, the unknown races before them, and the Aztecs of Mexico all built in stone and worked in metal. And stone and metal survive. But what if there had been an early people who used plastics and brittle alloys, who had no desire to build permanent buildings, whose tools and artifacts were meant to wear out quickly, perhaps for economic reasons? What would they leave us--considering, perhaps, that an ice age had intervened between their time and ours, with glaciers to grind into dust what little they did possess?  \"There is evidence that the poles of our world have changed and that this northern region was once close to being tropical. Any catastrophe violent enough to bring about a switch in the poles of this planet might well have wiped out all traces of a civilization, no matter how superior. We have good reason to believe that such a people must have existed, but we must find them.  \"And Ashe is a convert from the skeptics--\" the major slipped down from his perch on the wall shelf--\"he is an archaeologist, one of your tomb discoverers, and knows what he is talking about. We must do our hunting in time earlier than the first pyramid, earlier than the first"]]]
