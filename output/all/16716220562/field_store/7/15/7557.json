The dead went into the morgue aboard the ambulance, the ramp closed and the ambulance swung around and headed across the traffic lanes to eastbound NAT-26 and Philadelphia.  Outside, the four troopers had completed the task of collecting what little information they could from the smashed vehicles.  They returned to their cars and One One Nine's medical-surgical officer headed back to her own cubby-hole.  [Illustration]  The other patrol car swung into position almost touching Beulah's left flank. With Ben at the control seat, on command, both cars extended broad bulldozer blades from their bows. \"Let's go,\" Ben ordered. The two patrol vehicles moved slowly down the roadway, pushing all of the scattered scraps and parts onto a single great heap. They backed off, shifted direction towards the center police lane and began shoving the debris, foam and snow out of the green lane. At the edge of the police lane, both cars unshipped cranes and magnalifted the junk over the divider barrier onto the one-hundred-foot-wide service strip bordering the police lane. A slow cargo wrecker was already on the way from Pittsburgh barracks to pick up the wreckage and haul it away. When the last of the metallic debris had been deposited off the traffic lane, Martin called Control.  [Illustration]  \"Car 56 is clear. NAT 26-west green is clear.\"  Philly Control acknowledged. Seven miles to the east, the amber warning lights went dark and the detour barrier at Crossover 85 sank back into the roadway. Three minutes later, traffic was again flashing by on green lane past the two halted patrol cars.  \"Pitt Control, this is Car 119 clear of accident,\" the other car reported.  \"Car 119 resume eastbound patrol,\" came the reply.  The other patrol car pulled away. The two troopers waved at Martin and Ferguson in Beulah. \"See you later and thanks,\" Ben called out. He switched to intercom. \"Kelly. Any ID on that woman?\"  \"Not a thing, Ben,\" she replied. \"About forty years old, and she had a wedding band. She never was conscious, so I can't help you.\"  Ben nodded and looked over at his partner. \"Go get into some dry clothes, kid,\" he said, \"while I finish the report. Then you can take it for a while.\"  Clay nodded and headed back to the crew quarters.         *       *       *       *       *  Ben racked his helmet beside his seat and fished out a cigarette. He reached for an accident report form from the work rack behind his seat and began writing, glancing up from time to time to gaze thoughtfully at the scene of the accident. When he had finished, he thumbed the radio transmitter and called Philly Control. Somewhere in the bloody, oil and foam covered pile of wreckage were the registration plates for the two vehicles involved. When the wrecker collected the debris, it would be machine sifted in Pittsburgh and the plates fed to records and then relayed to Philadelphia where the identifications could be added to Ben's report. When he had finished reading his report he asked, \"How's the woman?\"  \"Still alive, but just barely,\" Philly Control answered. \"Ben, did you say there were just two vehicles involved?\"  \"That's all we found,\" Martin replied.  \"And were they both in the green?\"  \"Yes, why?\"  \"That's funny,\" Philly controller replied, \"we got the calls as a sideswipe in white that put one of the cars over into the green. There should have been a third vehicle.\"  \"That's right,\" Ben exclaimed. \"We were so busy trying to get that gal out and then making the try for the other man I never even thought to look for another car. You suppose that guy took off?\"  \"It's possible,\" the controller said. \"I'm calling a gate filter until we know for sure. I've got the car number on the driver that reported the accident. I'll get hold of him and see if he can give us a lead on the third car. You go ahead with your patrol and I'll let you know what I find out.\"  \"Affirmative,\" Ben replied. He eased the patrol car onto the police lane and turned west once again. Clay reappeared in the cab, dressed in fresh coveralls. \"I'll take it, Ben. You go and clean up now. Kelly's got a pot of fresh coffee in the galley.\" Ferguson slid into his control seat.  A light skiff of snow covered the service strip and the dividers as Car 56 swung back westward in the red lane. Snow was falling steadily but melting as it touched the warm ferrophalt pavement in all lanes. The wet roadways glistened with the lights of hundreds of vehicles. The chronometer read 1840 hours. Clay pushed the car up to a steady 75, just about apace with the slowest traffic in the white lane. To the south, densities were much lighter in the blue and yellow lanes and even the green had thinned out. It would stay moderately light now for another hour until the dinner stops were over and the night travelers again rolled onto the thruways.  Kelly was putting frozen steaks into the infra-oven as Ben walked through to crew quarters. Her coverall sleeves were rolled to the elbows as she worked and a vagrant strand of copper hair curled over her forehead. As Martin passed by, he caught a faint whisper of perfume and he smiled appreciatively.  In the tiny crew quarters, he shut the door to the galley and stripped out of his wet coveralls and boots. He eyed the shower stall across the passageway.  \"Hey, mother,\" he yelled to Kelly, \"have I got time for a shower before dinner?\"  \"Yes, but make it a quickie,\" she called back.  Five minutes later he stepped into the galley, his dark, crew-cut hair still damp. Kelly was setting plastic, disposable dishes on the little swing-down table that doubled as a food bar and work desk. Ben peered into a simmering pot and sniffed. \"Smells good. What's for dinner, Hiawatha?\"  \"Nothing fancy. Steak, potatoes, green beans, apple pie and coffee.\"  Ben's mouth watered. \"You know, sometimes I wonder whether one of your ancestors didn't come out of New England. Your menus always seem to coincide with my ideas of a perfect meal.\" He noted the two places set at the table. Ben glanced out the galley port into the headlight-striped darkness. Traffic was still light. In the distance, the night sky glowed with the lights of Chambersburg, north of the thruway.  \"We might as well pull up for dinner,\" he said. \"It's pretty slow out there.\"  Kelly shoved dishes over and began laying out a third setting. About half the time on patrol, the crew ate in shifts on the go, with one of the patrol troopers in the cab at all times. When traffic permitted, they pulled off to the service strip and ate together. With the communications system always in service, control stations could reach them anywhere in the big vehicle.  The sergeant stepped into the cab and tapped Ferguson on the shoulder. \"Dinnertime, Clay. Pull her over and we'll try some of your gracious living.\"  \"Light the candles and pour the wine,\" Clay quipped, \"I'll be with you in a second.\"  Car 56 swung out to the edge of the police lane and slowed down. Clay eased the car onto the strip and stopped. He checked the radiodometer and called in. \"Pitt Control, this is Car 56 at Marker 158. Dinner is being served in the dining car to the rear. Please do not disturb.\"  \"Affirmative, Car 56,\" Pittsburgh Control responded. \"Eat heartily, it may be going out of style.\" Clay grinned and flipped the radio to remote and headed for the galley.         *       *       *       *       *  Seated around the little table, the trio cut into their steaks. Parked at the north edge of the police lane, the patrol car was just a few feet from the green lane divider strip and cars and cargo carriers flashed by as they ate.  Clay chewed on a sliver of steak and looked at Kelly. \"I'd marry you, Pocahontas, if you'd ever learn to cook steaks like beef instead of curing them like your ancestral buffalo robes. When are you going to learn that good beef has to be bloody to be edible?\"  The girl glared at him. \"If that's what it takes to make it edible, you're going to be an epicurean delight in just about one second if I hear another word about my cooking. And that's also the second crack about my noble ancestors in the past five minutes. I've always wondered about the surgical techniques my great-great-great grandpop used when he lifted a paleface's hair. One more word, Clay Ferguson, and I'll have your scalp flying from Beulah's antenna like a coontail on a kid's scooter.\"  Ben bellowed and nearly choked. \"Hey, kid,\" he spluttered at Clay, \"ever notice how the wrong one of her ancestors keeps coming to the surface? That was the Irish.\"  Clay polished off the last of his steak and reached for the individual frozen pies Kelly had put in the oven with the steaks. \"Now that's another point,\" he said, waving his fork at Kelly. \"The Irish lived so long on potatoes and prayers that when they get a piece of meat on their menu, they don't know how to do anything but boil it.\"  \"That tears it,\" the girl exploded. She pushed back from the table and stood up. \"I've cooked the last meal this big, dumb Canuck will ever get from me. I hope you get chronic indigestion and then come crawling to me for help. I've got something back there I've been wanting to dose you with for a long time.\"  She stormed out of the galley and slammed the door behind her. Ben grinned at the stunned look on Clay's face. \"Now what got her on the warpath?\" Clay asked. Before Ben could answer the radio speaker in the ceiling came to life.  \"Car 56 this is Pitt Control.\"  Martin reached for the transmit switch beside the galley table. \"This is Five Six, go ahead.\"  \"Relay from Philly Control,\" the speaker blared. \"Reference the accident at Marker 92 at 1648 hours this date; Philly Control reports a third vehicle definitely involved.\"  Ben pulled out a pencil and Clay shoved a message pad across the table.  \"James J. Newhall, address 3409 Glen Cove Drive, New York City, license number BHT 4591 dash 747 dash 1609, was witness to the initial impact. He reports that a white over green, late model"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19111"],["title","Code Three (#6)"],["body","aire, with two men in it, sideswiped one of the two vehicles involved in the fatal accident. The Travelaire did not stop but accelerated after the impact. Newhall was unable to get the full license number but the first six units were QABR dash 46 ... rest of numerals unknown.\"  Ben cut in. \"Have we got identification on our fatalities yet?\"  \"Affirmative, Five Six,\" the radio replied. \"The driver of the car struck by the hit-and-run vehicle was a Herman Lawrence Hanover, age forty-two, of 13460 One Hundred Eighty-First Street South, Camden, New Jersey, license number LFM 4151 dash 603 dash 2738. With him was his wife, Clara, age forty-one, same address. Driver of the green lane car was George R. Hamilton, age thirty-five, address Box 493, Route 12, Tucumcari, New Mexico.\"  Ben broke in once more. \"You indicate all three are fatalities. Is this correct, Pitt Control? The woman was alive when she was transferred to the ambulance.\"  \"Stand by, Five Six, and I'll check.\"  A moment later Pitt Control was back. \"That is affirmative, Five Six. The woman died at 1745 hours. Here is additional information. A vehicle answering to the general description of the hit-and-run vehicle is believed to have been involved in an armed robbery and multiple murder earlier this date at Wilmington, Delaware. Philly Control is now checking for additional details. Gate filters have been established on NAT 26-West from Marker-Exit 100 to Marker-Exit 700. Also, filters on all interchanges. Pitt Control out.\"  Kelly Lightfoot, her not-too-serious peeve forgotten, had come back into the galley to listen to the radio exchange. The men got up from the table and Clay gathered the disposable dishware and tossed them into the waste receiver.  \"We'd better get rolling,\" Ben said, \"those clowns could still be on the thruway, although they could have got off before the filters went up.\"  They moved to the cab and took their places. The big engines roared into action as Ben rolled Car 56 back onto the police-way. Kelly finished straightening up in the galley and then came forward to sit on the jump seat between the two troopers. The snow had stopped again but the roadways were still slick and glistening under the headlights. Beulah rolled steadily along on her broad tracks, now cruising at one hundred miles an hour. The steady whine of the cold night wind penetrated faintly into the sound-proofed and insulated cabin canopy. Clay cut out the cabin lights, leaving only the instrument panel glowing faintly along with the phosphorescent buttons and knobs on the arms of the control seats.  A heavy express cargo carrier flashed by a quarter of a mile away in the blue lane, its big bulk lit up like a Christmas tree with running and warning lights. To their right, Clay caught the first glimpse of a set of flashing amber warning lights coming up from behind in the green lane. A minute later, a huge cargo carrier came abreast of the patrol car and then pulled ahead. On its side was a glowing star of the United States Army. A minute later, another Army carrier rolled by.  \"That's the missile convoy out of Aberdeen,\" Clay told Kelly. \"I wish our hit-runner had tackled one of those babies. We'd have scraped him up instead of those other people.\"  The convoy rolled on past at a steady one hundred twenty-five miles an hour. Car 56 flashed under a crossover and into a long, gentle curve. The chronometer clicked up to 2100 hours and the radio sang out. \"Cars 207, 56 and 82, this is Pitt Control. 2100 hours density report follows....\"  Pittsburgh Control read off the figures for the three cars. Car 82 was one hundred fifty miles ahead of Beulah, Car 207 about the same distance to the rear. The density report ended and a new voice came on the air.  \"Attention all cars and all stations, this is Washington Criminal Control.\" The new voice paused, and across the continent, troopers on every thruway, control station, checkpoint and relay block, reached for clipboard and pen.  \"Washington Criminal Control continuing, all cars and all stations, special attention to all units east of the Mississippi. At 1510 hours this date, two men held up the First National Bank of Wilmington, Delaware, and escaped with an estimated one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars. A bank guard and two tellers, together with five bank customers were killed by these subjects using automatic weapon fire to make good their escape. They were observed leaving the scene in a late model, white-over-green Travelaire sedan, license unknown. A car of the same make, model and color was stolen from Annapolis, Maryland, a short time prior to the holdup. The stolen vehicle, now believed to be the getaway car, bears USN license number QABR dash 468 dash 1113....\"  \"That's our baby,\" Ben murmured as he and Clay scribbled, on their message forms.  \"... Motor number ZB 1069432,\" Washington Criminal Control continued. \"This car is also now believed to have been involved in a hit-and-run fatal accident on NAT 26-West at Marker 92 at approximately 1648 hours this date.  \"Subject Number One is described as WMA, twenty to twenty-five years, five feet, eleven inches tall, medium complexion, dark hair and eyes, wearing a dark-gray sports jacket and dark pants, and wearing a gray sports cap. He was wearing a ring with a large red stone on his left hand.  \"Subject Number Two is described as WMA, twenty to twenty-five years, six feet, light, ruddy complexion and reddish brown hair, light colored eyes. Has scar on back left side of neck. Wearing light-brown suit, green shirt and dark tie, no hat.  \"These subjects are believed to be armed and psychotically dangerous. If observed, approach with extreme caution and inform nearest control of contact. Both subjects now under multiple federal warrants charging bank robbery, murder, and hit-and-run murder. All cars and stations acknowledge. Washington Criminal Control out.\"  The air chattered as the cars checked into their nearest controls with \"acknowledged.\"  \"This looks like it could be a long night,\" Kelly said, rising to her feet. \"I'm going to sack out. Call me if you need me.\"  \"Good night, princess,\" Ben called.  \"Hey, Hiawatha,\" Clay called out as Kelly paused in the galley door. \"I didn't mean what I said about your steaks. Your great-great-great grandpop would have gone around with his bare scalp hanging out if he had had to use a buffalo hide cured like that steak was cooked.\"  He reached back at the same instant and slammed the cabin door just as Kelly came charging back. She slammed into the door, screamed and then went storming back to the dispensary while Clay doubled over in laughter.  Ben smiled at his junior partner. \"Boy, you're gonna regret that. Don't say I didn't warn you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Martin turned control over to the younger trooper and relaxed in his seat to go over the APB from Washington. Car 56 bored steadily through the night. The thruway climbed easily up the slight grade cut through the hills north of Wheeling, West Virginia, and once more snow began falling.  Clay reached over and flipped on the video scanners. Four small screens, one for each of the westbound lanes, glowed with a soft red light. The monitors were synchronized with the radiometer and changed view at every ten-mile marker. Viewing cameras mounted on towers between each lane, lined the thruway, aimed eastward at the on-coming traffic back to the next bank of cameras ten miles away. Infra-red circuits took over from standard scan at dark. A selector system in the cars gave the troopers the option of viewing either the block they were currently patrolling; the one ahead of the next ten-mile block; or, the one they had just passed. As a rule, the selection was based on the speed of the car. Beamed signals from each block automatically switched the view as the patrol car went past the towers. Clay put the slower lane screens on the block they were in, turned the blue and yellow lanes to the block ahead.  They rolled past the interchange with NAT 114-South out of Cleveland and the traffic densities picked up in all lanes as many of the southbound vehicles turned west on to NAT 26. The screens flicked and Clay came alert. Some fifteen miles ahead in the one-hundred-fifty-to-two-hundred-mile an hour blue lane, a glowing dot remained motionless in the middle of the lane and the other racing lights of the blue lane traffic were sheering around it like a racing river current parting around a boulder.  \"Trouble,\" he said to Martin, as he shoved forward on the throttle.  A stalled car in the middle of the high-speed lane was an invitation to disaster. The bull horn blared as Beulah leaped past the two hundred mile an hour mark and safety cocoons slid into place. Aft in the dispensary, Kelly was sealed into her bunk by a cocoon rolling out of the wall and encasing the hospital bed.  Car 5 slanted across the police lane with red lights flashing and edged into the traffic flow in the blue lane. The great, red winking lights and the emergency radio siren signal began clearing a path for the troopers. Vehicles began edging to both sides of the lane to shift to crossovers to the yellow or green lanes. Clay aimed Beulah at the motionless dot on the screen and eased back from the four-mile-a-minute speed. The patrol car slowed and the headlight picked up the stalled vehicle a mile ahead. The cocoons opened and Ben slipped on his work helmet and dropped down the steps to the side hatch. Clay brought Beulah to a halt a dozen yards directly to the rear of the stalled car, the great bulk of the patrol vehicle with its warning lights serving as a shield against any possible fuzzy-headed speeders that might not be observing the road.  As Martin reached for the door, the Wanted bulletin flashed through his head. \"What make of car is that, Clay?\"  \"Old jalopy Tritan with some souped-up rigs. Probably kids,\" the junior officer replied. \"It looks O.K.\"  Ben nodded and swung down"]]]
