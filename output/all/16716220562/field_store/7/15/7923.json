The sun was getting rather low, and they had an idea that they would push on to Buldeo’s village and see that wicked witch. Buldeo said that, though it was his duty to kill the Devil-child, he could not think of letting a party of unarmed men go through the Jungle, which might produce the Wolf-demon at any minute, without his escort. He, therefore, would accompany them, and if the sorcerer’s child appeared--well, he would show them how the best hunter in Seeonee dealt with such things. The Brahmin, he said, had given him a charm against the creature that made everything perfectly safe.  “What says he? What says he? What says he?” the wolves repeated every few minutes; and Mowgli translated until he came to the witch part of the story, which was a little beyond him, and then he said that the man and woman who had been so kind to him were trapped.  “Does Man trap Man?” said Bagheera.  “So he says. I cannot understand the talk. They are all mad together. What have Messua and her man to do with me that they should be put in a trap; and what is all this talk about the Red Flower? I must look to this. Whatever they would do to Messua they will not do till Buldeo returns. And so----” Mowgli thought hard, with his fingers playing round the haft of the skinning-knife, while Buldeo and the charcoal-burners went off very valiantly in single file.  “I go hot-foot back to the Man-Pack,” Mowgli said at last.  “And those?” said Gray Brother, looking hungrily after the brown backs of the charcoal-burners.  “Sing them home,” said Mowgli, with a grin; “I do not wish them to be at the village gates till it is dark. Can ye hold them?”  Gray Brother bared his white teeth in contempt. “We can head them round and round in circles like tethered goats--if I know Man.”  “That I do not need. Sing to them a little, lest they be lonely on the road, and, Gray Brother, the song need not be of the sweetest. Go with them, Bagheera, and help make that song. When night is shut down, meet me by the village--Gray Brother knows the place.”  “It is no light hunting to work for a Man-cub. When shall I sleep?” said Bagheera, yawning, though his eyes showed that he was delighted with the amusement. “Me to sing to naked men! But let us try.”  He lowered his head so that the sound would travel, and cried a long, long, “Good hunting”--a midnight call in the afternoon, which was quite awful enough to begin with. Mowgli heard it rumble, and rise, and fall, and die off in a creepy sort of whine behind him, and laughed to himself as he ran through the Jungle. He could see the charcoal-burners huddled in a knot; old Buldeo’s gun-barrel waving, like a banana-leaf, to every point of the compass at once. Then Gray Brother gave the Ya-la-hi! Yalaha! call for the buck-driving, when the Pack drives the nilghai, the big blue cow, before them, and it seemed to come from the very ends of the earth, nearer, and nearer, and nearer, till it ended in a shriek snapped off short. The other three answered, till even Mowgli could have vowed that the full Pack was in full cry, and then they all broke into the magnificent Morning-song in the Jungle, with every turn, and flourish, and grace-note that a deep-mouthed wolf of the Pack knows. This is a rough rendering of the song, but you must imagine what it sounds like when it breaks the afternoon hush of the Jungle:--       One moment past our bodies cast        No shadow on the plain;      Now clear and black they stride our track,        And we run home again.      In morning hush, each rock and bush        Stands hard, and high, and raw:      Then give the Call: “Good rest to all        That keep The Jungle Law!”       Now horn and pelt our peoples melt        In covert to abide;      Now, crouched and still, to cave and hill        Our Jungle Barons glide.      Now, stark and plain, Man’s oxen strain,        That draw the new-yoked plough;      Now, stripped and dread, the dawn is red        Above the lit talao.       Ho! Get to lair! The sun’s aflare        Behind the breathing grass:      And cracking through the young bamboo        The warning whispers pass.      By day made strange, the woods we range        With blinking eyes we scan;      While down the skies the wild duck cries        “The Day--the Day to Man!”       The dew is dried that drenched our hide        Or washed about our way;      And where we drank, the puddled bank        Is crisping into clay.      The traitor Dark gives up each mark        Of stretched or hooded claw;      Then hear the Call: “Good rest to all        That keep the Jungle Law!”  But no translation can give the effect of it, or the yelping scorn the Four threw into every word of it, as they heard the trees crash when the men hastily climbed up into the branches, and Buldeo began repeating incantations and charms. Then they lay down and slept, for, like all who live by their own exertions, they were of a methodical cast of mind; and no one can work well without sleep.  Meantime, Mowgli was putting the miles behind him, nine to the hour, swinging on, delighted to find himself so fit after all his cramped months among men. The one idea in his head was to get Messua and her husband out of the trap, whatever it was; for he had a natural mistrust of traps. Later on, he promised himself, he would pay his debts to the village at large.  It was at twilight when he saw the well-remembered grazing-grounds, and the dhak-tree where Gray Brother had waited for him on the morning that he killed Shere Khan. Angry as he was at the whole breed and community of Man, something jumped up in his throat and made him catch his breath when he looked at the village roofs. He noticed that every one had come in from the fields unusually early, and that, instead of getting to their evening cooking, they gathered in a crowd under the village tree, and chattered, and shouted.  “Men must always be making traps for men, or they are not content,” said Mowgli. “Last night it was Mowgli--but that night seems many Rains ago. To-night it is Messua and her man. To-morrow, and for very many nights after, it will be Mowgli’s turn again.”  He crept along outside the wall till he came to Messua’s hut, and looked through the window into the room. There lay Messua, gagged, and bound hand and foot, breathing hard, and groaning: her husband was tied to the gaily-painted bedstead. The door of the hut that opened into the street was shut fast, and three or four people were sitting with their backs to it.  Mowgli knew the manners and customs of the villagers very fairly. He argued that so long as they could eat, and talk, and smoke, they would not do anything else; but as soon as they had fed they would begin to be dangerous. Buldeo would be coming in before long, and if his escort had done its duty, Buldeo would have a very interesting tale to tell. So he went in through the window, and, stooping over the man and the woman, cut their thongs, pulling out the gags, and looked round the hut for some milk.  Messua was half wild with pain and fear (she had been beaten and stoned all the morning), and Mowgli put his hand over her mouth just in time to stop a scream. Her husband was only bewildered and angry, and sat picking dust and things out of his torn beard.  “I knew--I knew he would come,” Messua sobbed at last. “Now do I KNOW that he is my son!” and she hugged Mowgli to her heart. Up to that time Mowgli had been perfectly steady, but now he began to tremble all over, and that surprised him immensely.  “Why are these thongs? Why have they tied thee?” he asked, after a pause.  “To be put to the death for making a son of thee--what else?” said the man sullenly. “Look! I bleed.”  Messua said nothing, but it was at her wounds that Mowgli looked, and they heard him grit his teeth when he saw the blood.  “Whose work is this?” said he. “There is a price to pay.”  “The work of all the village. I was too rich. I had too many cattle. THEREFORE she and I are witches, because we gave thee shelter.”  “I do not understand. Let Messua tell the tale.”  “I gave thee milk, Nathoo; dost thou remember?” Messua said timidly. “Because thou wast my son, whom the tiger took, and because I loved thee very dearly. They said that I was thy mother, the mother of a devil, and therefore worthy of death.”  “And what is a devil?” said Mowgli. “Death I have seen.”  The man looked up gloomily, but Messua laughed. “See!” she said to her husband, “I knew--I said that he was no sorcerer. He is my son--my son!”  “Son or sorcerer, what good will that do us?” the man answered. “We be as dead already.”  “Yonder is the road to the Jungle”--Mowgli pointed through the window. “Your hands and feet are free. Go now.”  “We do not know the Jungle, my son, as--as thou knowest,” Messua began. “I do not think that I could walk far.”  “And the men and women would be upon our backs and drag us here again,”  said the husband.  “H’m!” said Mowgli, and he tickled the palm of his hand with the tip of his skinning-knife; “I have no wish to do harm to any one of this village--YET. But I do not think they will stay thee. In a little while they will have much else to think upon. Ah!” he lifted his head and listened to shouting and trampling outside. “So they have let Buldeo come home at last?”  “He was sent out this morning to kill thee,” Messua cried. “Didst thou meet him?”  “Yes--we--I met him. He has a tale to tell and while he is telling it there is time to do much. But first I will learn what they mean. Think where ye would go, and tell me when I come back.”  He bounded through the window and ran along again outside the wall of the village till he came within ear-shot of the crowd round the peepul-tree. Buldeo was lying on the ground, coughing and groaning, and every one was asking him questions. His hair had fallen about his shoulders; his hands and legs were skinned from climbing up trees, and he could hardly speak, but he felt the importance of his position"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19370"],["title","Ullr Uprising (#0)"],["body","Team at https://www.pgdp.net                                   Transcriber's Note:     This etext was produced from Space Science Fiction, February and    March, 1953.

There both red and yellow           meant danger--and blood!         *       *       *       *       *     I   The big armor-tender vibrated, gently and not unpleasantly, as the contragravity field alternated on and off. Sometimes it rocked slightly, like a boat on the water, and, in the big screen which served in lieu of a window at the front of the control-cabin, the dingy-yellow landscape would seem to tilt a little. The air was faintly yellow, the sky was yellow with a greenish cast, and the clouds were green-gray.  No human had ever set foot on the surface, or breathed the air, of Niflheim. To have done so would have been instant death; the air was a mixture of free fluorine and fluoride gasses, the soil was metallic fluorides, damp with acid rains, and the river was pure hydrofluoric acid. Even the ordinary spacesuit would have been no protection; the glass and rubber and plastic would have disintegrated in a matter of minutes. People came to Niflheim, and worked the mines and uranium refineries and chemical plants, but they did so inside power-driven and contragravity-lifted armor, and they lived on artificial satellites two thousand miles off-planet. Niflheim was worse than airless; much worse.  The chief engineer sat at his controls, making the minor lateral adjustments in the vehicle's position which were not possible to the automatic controls. At his own panel of instruments, a small man with grizzled black hair around a bald crown, and a grizzled beard, chewed nervously at the stump of a dead cigar and listened intently. A large, plump-faced, young man in soiled khaki shirt and shorts, with extremely hairy legs, was doodling on his notepad and eating candy out of a bag. And a black-haired girl in a suit of coveralls three sizes too big for her, and, apparently, not much of anything else, lounged with one knee hooked over her chair-arm, staring into the screen at the distant horizon.  \"I can see them,\" the girl said, lifting a hand in front of her. \"At two o'clock, about one of my hand's-breaths above the horizon. But only four of them.\"  The man with the grizzled beard put his face into the fur around the eyepiece of the telescopic-'visor and twisted a dial. \"You have good eyes, Miss Quinton,\" he complimented. \"The fifth's inside the handling machine. One of the Ullrans. Gorkrink.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The largest of the specks that had appeared on the horizon resolved itself into a handling-machine, a thing like an oversized contragravity-tank, with a bull-dozer-blade, a stubby derrick-boom instead of a gun, and jointed, claw-tipped, arms at the sides. The smaller dots grew into personal armor--egg-shaped things that sprouted arms and grab-hooks and pushers in all directions. The man with the grizzled beard began talking rapidly into his hand-phone, then hung it up. There was a series of bumps, and the armor-tender, weightless on contragravity, shook as the handling-machine came aboard.  \"You ever see any nuclear bombing, Miss Quinton?\" the young man with the hairy legs asked, offering her his candybag.  \"Only by telecast, back Solside,\" Paula Quinton replied, helping herself. \"Test-shots at the Federation Navy proving-ground on Mars. I never even heard of nuclear bombs being used for mining till I came here, though.\"  \"It'll be something to see,\" he promised. \"These volcanoes have been dormant for, oh, maybe as long as a thousand years; there ought to be a pretty good head of gas down there. The volcanoes we shot three months ago yielded a fine flow of lava with all sorts of metals--nickel, beryllium, vanadium, chromium, iridium, as well as copper and iron.\"  \"What sort of gas were you speaking about?\" she asked.  \"Hydrogen. That's what's going to make the fireworks; it combines explosively with fluorine. The hydrogen-fluorine combination is what passes for combustion here: the result is hydrofluoric acid, the local equivalent of water. The subsurface hydrogen is produced when the acid filters down through the rock, combines with pure metals underneath.\"  The door at the rear of the control-cabin opened, and Juan Murillo, the seismologist, entered, followed by an assistant, who was not human. He was a biped, vaguely humanoid, but he had four arms and a face like a lizard's, and, except for some equipment on belt, he was entirely naked.  He spoke rapidly to Murillo, in a squeaking jabber. Murillo turned.  \"Yes, if you wish, Gorkrink,\" he said, in Lingua Terra. Then he turned back to Gomes as the Ullran sat down in a chair by the door.  \"Well, she's all yours, Louren蔞; shoot the works.\"  Gomes stabbed the radio-detonator button in front of him.         *       *       *       *       *  Out on the rolling skyline, fifty miles away, a lancelike ray of blue-white light shot up into the gathering dusk--a clump of five rays, really, from five deep shafts in an irregular pentagon half a mile across, blended into one by the distance. An instant later, there was a blinding flash, like sheet-lightning, and a huge ball of varicolored fire belched upward, leaving a series of smoke-rings to float more slowly after it. The fireball flattened, then spread to form the mushroom-head of a column of incandescent gas that mounted to overtake it, engorging the smoke-rings as it rose, twisting, writhing, changing shape, turning to dark smoke in one moment and belching flame and crackling with lightning the next.  \"In about half an hour,\" the large young man told Paula Quinton, \"the real fireworks should be starting. What's coming up now is just small debris from the nuclear blast. When the shock-waves get down far enough to crack things open, the gas'll come up, and then steam and ash, and then magma.\"  \"Well, even this was worth staying over for,\" the girl said, watching the screen.  \"You going on to Ullr on the _City of Canberra_?\" Louren蔞 Gomes asked. \"I wish I were; I have to stay over and make another shot, in a month or so, and I've had about all of Niflheim I can take, now.\"  \"When are you going to Terra?\" the girl asked him.  \"Terra? I don't know; a year, two years. But I'm going to Ullr on the next ship--the _City of Pretoria_--if we get the next blast off in time. They want me to design some improvements on a couple of power-reactors at Keegark so I'll probably see you when I get there.\"  \"Here she comes!\" the chief engineer called. \"Watch the base of the column!\"  The pillar of fiery smoke and dust, still boiling up from where the bombs had gone off far underground, was being violently agitated at the bottom. A series of new flashes broke out, lifting and spreading the incandescent radioactive gasses, and then a great gush of flame rose. A column of pure hydrogen must have rushed up into the vacuum created by the explosion; the next blast of flame, in a lateral sheet, came at nearly ten thousand feet above the ground. Then geysers of hot ash and molten rock spouted upward; some of the white-hot debris landed almost at the acid river, half-way to the armor-tender.  \"We've started a first-class earthquake, too,\" Murillo said, looking at the instruments.  \"About six big cracks opening in the rock-structure. You know, when this quiets down and cools off, we'll have more ore on the surface than we can handle in ten years, and more than we could have mined by ordinary means in fifty.\"  \"Well, that finishes our work,\" the large young man said, going to a kit-bag in the corner of the cabin and getting out a bottle. \"Get some of those plastic cups, over there, somebody; this one calls for a drink.\"  The Ullran, in the background, rose quickly and squeaked apologetically. Murillo nodded. \"Yes, of course, Gorkrink. No need for you to stay here.\" The Ullran went out, closing the door behind him.  \"That taboo against Ullrans and Terrans watching each other eat and drink,\" Paula Quinton commented. \"But you were speaking to him in Lingua Terra; I didn't know any of them understood it.\"  \"Gorkrink does,\" Murillo said, uncorking the bottle and pouring into the plastic cups. \"None of them can speak it, of course, because of the structure of their vocal organs, any more than we can speak their languages without artificial aids. But I can talk to him in Lingua Terra without having to put one of those damn gags in my mouth, and he can pass my instructions on to the others. He's been a big help; I'll be sorry to lose him.\"  \"Lose him?\"  \"Yes, his year's up; he's going back to Ullr on the _Canberra_. He's from Keegark; claims to be a prince, or something. But he's a damn good worker. Very smart; picks things up the first time you tell him. I'll recommend him unqualifiedly for any kind of work with contragravity or mechanized equipment.\"  They all had drinks, now, except the chief engineer, who wanted a rain-check on his.  \"Well, here's to us,\" Murillo said. \"The first A-bomb miners in history....\"     II   Carlos von Schlichten, General of the troops on Ullr, threw his cigarette away and set his monocle more firmly in his eye, stepping forward to let Brigadier-General Themistocles M'zangwe and little Colonel Hideyoshi O'Leary follow him out of the fort. On the little hundred-foot-square parade ground in front of the keep, his aircar was parked, and the soldiers were assembled.  Ten or twelve of"]]]
