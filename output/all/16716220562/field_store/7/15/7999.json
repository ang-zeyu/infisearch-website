You have to be the top man in Martiology, too. You can't leave that for anybody else--\" Lattimer shoved his chair back and got to his feet, leaving the table with an oath that was almost a sob of exasperation.  Maybe his feelings were too much for him. Maybe he realized, as Martha did, what he had betrayed. She sat, avoiding the eyes of the others, looking at the ceiling, as embarrassed as though Lattimer had flung something dirty on the table in front of them. Tony Lattimer had, desperately, wanted Selim to go home on the _Cyrano_. Martiology was a new field; if Selim entered it, he would bring with him the reputation he had already built in Hittitology, automatically stepping into the leading role that Lattimer had coveted for himself. Ivan Fitzgerald's words echoed back to her--when you want to be a big shot, you can't bear the possibility of anybody else being a bigger big shot. His derision of her own efforts became comprehensible, too. It wasn't that he was convinced that she would never learn to read the Martian language. He had been afraid that she would.         *       *       *       *       *  Ivan Fitzgerald finally isolated the germ that had caused the Finchley girl's undiagnosed illness. Shortly afterward, the malady turned into a mild fever, from which she recovered. Nobody else seemed to have caught it. Fitzgerald was still trying to find out how the germ had been transmitted.  They found a globe of Mars, made when the city had been a seaport. They located the city, and learned that its name had been Kukan--or something with a similar vowel-consonant ratio. Immediately, Sid Chamberlain and Gloria Standish began giving their telecasts a Kukan dateline, and Hubert Penrose used the name in his official reports. They also found a Martian calendar; the year had been divided into ten more or less equal months, and one of them had been Doma. Another month was Nor, and that was a part of the name of the scientific journal Martha had found.  Bill Chandler, the zoologist, had been going deeper and deeper into the old sea bottom of Syrtis. Four hundred miles from Kukan, and at fifteen thousand feet lower altitude, he shot a bird. At least, it was a something with wings and what were almost but not quite feathers, though it was more reptilian than avian in general characteristics. He and Ivan Fitzgerald skinned and mounted it, and then dissected the carcass almost tissue by tissue. About seven-eighths of its body capacity was lungs; it certainly breathed air containing at least half enough oxygen to support human life, or five times as much as the air around Kukan.  That took the center of interest away from archaeology, and started a new burst of activity. All the expedition's aircraft--four jetticopters and three wingless airdyne reconnaissance fighters--were thrown into intensified exploration of the lower sea bottoms, and the bio-science boys and girls were wild with excitement and making new discoveries on each flight.  The University was left to Selim and Martha and Tony Lattimer, the latter keeping to himself while she and the old Turco-German worked together. The civilian specialists in other fields, and the Space Force people who had been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping cameras, were all flying to lower Syrtis to find out how much oxygen there was and what kind of life it supported.  Sometimes Sachiko dropped in; most of the time she was busy helping Ivan Fitzgerald dissect specimens. They had four or five species of what might loosely be called birds, and something that could easily be classed as a reptile, and a carnivorous mammal the size of a cat with birdlike claws, and a herbivore almost identical with the piglike thing in the big _Darfhulva_ mural, and another like a gazelle with a single horn in the middle of its forehead.  The high point came when one party, at thirty thousand feet below the level of Kukan, found breathable air. One of them had a mild attack of _sorroche_ and had to be flown back for treatment in a hurry, but the others showed no ill effects.  The daily newscasts from Terra showed a corresponding shift in interest at home. The discovery of the University had focused attention on the dead past of Mars; now the public was interested in Mars as a possible home for humanity. It was Tony Lattimer who brought archaeology back into the activities of the expedition and the news at home.  Martha and Selim were working in the museum on the second floor, scrubbing the grime from the glass cases, noting contents, and grease-penciling numbers; Lattimer and a couple of Space Force officers were going through what had been the administrative offices on the other side. It was one of these, a young second lieutenant, who came hurrying in from the mezzanine, almost bursting with excitement.  \"Hey, Martha! Dr. von Ohlmhorst!\" he was shouting. \"Where are you? Tony's found the Martians!\"  Selim dropped his rag back in the bucket; she laid her clipboard on top of the case beside her.  \"Where?\" they asked together.  \"Over on the north side.\" The lieutenant took hold of himself and spoke more deliberately. \"Little room, back of one of the old faculty offices--conference room. It was locked from the inside, and we had to burn it down with a torch. That's where they are. Eighteen of them, around a long table--\"  Gloria Standish, who had dropped in for lunch, was on the mezzanine, fairly screaming into a radiophone extension:  \" ... Dozen and a half of them! Well, of course they're dead. What a question! They look like skeletons covered with leather. No, I do not know what they died of. Well, forget it; I don't care if Bill Chandler's found a three-headed hippopotamus. Sid, don't you get it? We've found the _Martians_!\"  She slammed the phone back on its hook, rushing away ahead of them.         *       *       *       *       *  Martha remembered the closed door; on the first survey, they hadn't attempted opening it. Now it was burned away at both sides and lay, still hot along the edges, on the floor of the big office room in front. A floodlight was on in the room inside, and Lattimer was going around looking at things while a Space Force officer stood by the door. The center of the room was filled by a long table; in armchairs around it sat the eighteen men and women who had occupied the room for the last fifty millennia. There were bottles and glasses on the table in front of them, and, had she seen them in a dimmer light, she would have thought that they were merely dozing over their drinks. One had a knee hooked over his chair-arm and was curled in foetuslike sleep. Another had fallen forward onto the table, arms extended, the emerald set of a ring twinkling dully on one finger. Skeletons covered with leather, Gloria Standish had called them, and so they were--faces like skulls, arms and legs like sticks, the flesh shrunken onto the bones under it.  \"Isn't this something!\" Lattimer was exulting. \"Mass suicide, that's what it was. Notice what's in the corners?\"  Braziers, made of perforated two-gallon-odd metal cans, the white walls smudged with smoke above them. Von Ohlmhorst had noticed them at once, and was poking into one of them with his flashlight.  \"Yes; charcoal. I noticed a quantity of it around a couple of hand-forges in the shop on the first floor. That's why you had so much trouble breaking in; they'd sealed the room on the inside.\" He straightened and went around the room, until he found a ventilator, and peered into it. \"Stuffed with rags. They must have been all that were left, here. Their power was gone, and they were old and tired, and all around them their world was dying. So they just came in here and lit the charcoal, and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep. Well, we know what became of them, now, anyhow.\"  Sid and Gloria made the most of it. The Terran public wanted to hear about Martians, and if live Martians couldn't be found, a room full of dead ones was the next best thing. Maybe an even better thing; it had been only sixty-odd years since the Orson Welles invasion-scare. Tony Lattimer, the discoverer, was beginning to cash in on his attentions to Gloria and his ingratiation with Sid; he was always either making voice-and-image talks for telecast or listening to the news from the home planet. Without question, he had become, overnight, the most widely known archaeologist in history.  \"Not that I'm interested in all this, for myself,\" he disclaimed, after listening to the telecast from Terra two days after his discovery. \"But this is going to be a big thing for Martian archaeology. Bring it to the public attention; dramatize it. Selim, can you remember when Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter found the tomb of Tutankhamen?\"  \"In 1923? I was two years old, then,\" von Ohlmhorst chuckled. \"I really don't know how much that publicity ever did for Egyptology. Oh, the museums did devote more space to Egyptian exhibits, and after a museum department head gets a few extra showcases, you know how hard it is to make him give them up. And, for a while, it was easier to get financial support for new excavations. But I don't know how much good all this public excitement really does, in the long run.\"  \"Well, I think one of us should go back on the _Cyrano_, when the _Schiaparelli_ orbits in,\" Lattimer said. \"I'd hoped it would be you; your voice would carry the most weight. But I think it's important that one of us go back, to present the story of our work, and what we have accomplished and what we hope to accomplish, to the public and to the universities and the learned societies, and to the Federation Government. There will be a great deal of work that will have to be done. We must not allow the other scientific fields and the so-called practical interests to monopolize public and academic support. So, I believe I shall go back at least for a while, and see what I can "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19445"],["title","Omnilingual (#8)"],["body","do--\"  Lectures. The organization of a Society of Martian Archaeology, with Anthony Lattimer, Ph.D., the logical candidate for the chair. Degrees, honors; the deference of the learned, and the adulation of the lay public. Positions, with impressive titles and salaries. Sweet are the uses of publicity.  She crushed out her cigarette and got to her feet. \"Well, I still have the final lists of what we found in _Halvhulva_--Biology--department to check over. I'm starting on Sornhulva tomorrow, and I want that stuff in shape for expert evaluation.\"  That was the sort of thing Tony Lattimer wanted to get away from, the detail-work and the drudgery. Let the infantry do the slogging through the mud; the brass-hats got the medals.         *       *       *       *       *  She was halfway through the fifth floor, a week later, and was having midday lunch in the reading room on the first floor when Hubert Penrose came over and sat down beside her, asking her what she was doing. She told him.  \"I wonder if you could find me a couple of men, for an hour or so,\" she added. \"I'm stopped by a couple of jammed doors at the central hall. Lecture room and library, if the layout of that floor's anything like the ones below it.\"  \"Yes. I'm a pretty fair door-buster, myself.\" He looked around the room. \"There's Jeff Miles; he isn't doing much of anything. And we'll put Sid Chamberlain to work, for a change, too. The four of us ought to get your doors open.\" He called to Chamberlain, who was carrying his tray over to the dish washer. \"Oh, Sid; you doing anything for the next hour or so?\"  \"I was going up to the fourth floor, to see what Tony's doing.\"  \"Forget it. Tony's bagged his season limit of Martians. I'm going to help Martha bust in a couple of doors; we'll probably find a whole cemetery full of Martians.\"  Chamberlain shrugged. \"Why not. A jammed door can have anything back of it, and I know what Tony's doing--just routine stuff.\"  Jeff Miles, the Space Force captain, came over, accompanied by one of the lab-crew from the ship who had come down on the rocket the day before.  \"This ought to be up your alley, Mort,\" he was saying to his companion. \"Chemistry and physics department. Want to come along?\"  The lab man, Mort Tranter, was willing. Seeing the sights was what he'd come down from the ship for. She finished her coffee and cigarette, and they went out into the hall together, gathered equipment and rode the elevator to the fifth floor.  The lecture hall door was the nearest; they attacked it first. With proper equipment and help, it was no problem and in ten minutes they had it open wide enough to squeeze through with the floodlights. The room inside was quite empty, and, like most of the rooms behind closed doors, comparatively free from dust. The students, it appeared, had sat with their backs to the door, facing a low platform, but their seats and the lecturer's table and equipment had been removed. The two side walls bore inscriptions: on the right, a pattern of concentric circles which she recognized as a diagram of atomic structure, and on the left a complicated table of numbers and words, in two columns. Tranter was pointing at the diagram on the right.  [Illustration]  \"They got as far as the Bohr atom, anyhow,\" he said. \"Well, not quite. They knew about electron shells, but they have the nucleus pictured as a solid mass. No indication of proton-and-neutron structure. I'll bet, when you come to translate their scientific books, you'll find that they taught that the atom was the ultimate and indivisible particle. That explains why you people never found any evidence that the Martians used nuclear energy.\"  \"That's a uranium atom,\" Captain Miles mentioned.  \"It is?\" Sid Chamberlain asked, excitedly. \"Then they did know about atomic energy. Just because we haven't found any pictures of A-bomb mushrooms doesn't mean--\"  She turned to look at the other wall. Sid's signal reactions were getting away from him again; uranium meant nuclear power to him, and the two words were interchangeable. As she studied the arrangement of the numbers and words, she could hear Tranter saying:  \"Nuts, Sid. We knew about uranium a long time before anybody found out what could be done with it. Uranium was discovered on Terra in 1789, by Klaproth.\"  There was something familiar about the table on the left wall. She tried to remember what she had been taught in school about physics, and what she had picked up by accident afterward. The second column was a continuation of the first: there were forty-six items in each, each item numbered consecutively--  \"Probably used uranium because it's the largest of the natural atoms,\" Penrose was saying. \"The fact that there's nothing beyond it there shows that they hadn't created any of the transuranics. A student could go to that thing and point out the outer electron of any of the ninety-two elements.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Ninety-two! That was it; there were ninety-two items in the table on the left wall! Hydrogen was Number One, she knew; One, _Sarfaldsorn_. Helium was Two; that was _Tirfaldsorn_. She couldn't remember which element came next, but in Martian it was _Sarfalddavas_. _Sorn_ must mean matter, or substance, then. And _davas_; she was trying to think of what it could be. She turned quickly to the others, catching hold of Hubert Penrose's arm with one hand and waving her clipboard with the other.  \"Look at this thing, over here,\" she was clamoring excitedly. \"Tell me what you think it is. Could it be a table of the elements?\"  They all turned to look. Mort Tranter stared at it for a moment.  \"Could be. If I only knew what those squiggles meant--\"  That was right; he'd spent his time aboard the ship.  \"If you could read the numbers, would that help?\" she asked, beginning to set down the Arabic digits and their Martian equivalents. \"It's decimal system, the same as we use.\"  \"Sure. If that's a table of elements, all I'd need would be the numbers. Thanks,\" he added as she tore off the sheet and gave it to him.  Penrose knew the numbers, and was ahead of him. \"Ninety-two items, numbered consecutively. The first number would be the atomic number. Then a single word, the name of the element. Then the atomic weight--\"  She began reading off the names of the elements. \"I know hydrogen and helium; what's _tirfalddavas_, the third one?\"  \"Lithium,\" Tranter said. \"The atomic weights aren't run out past the decimal point. Hydrogen's one plus, if that double-hook dingus is a plus sign; Helium's four-plus, that's right. And lithium's given as seven, that isn't right. It's six-point nine-four-oh. Or is that thing a Martian minus sign?\"  \"Of course! Look! A plus sign is a hook, to hang things together; a minus sign is a knife, to cut something off from something--see, the little loop is the handle and the long pointed loop is the blade. Stylized, of course, but that's what it is. And the fourth element, kiradavas; what's that?\"  \"Beryllium. Atomic weight given as nine-and-a-hook; actually it's nine-point-oh-two.\"  Sid Chamberlain had been disgruntled because he couldn't get a story about the Martians having developed atomic energy. It took him a few minutes to understand the newest development, but finally it dawned on him.  \"Hey! You're reading that!\" he cried. \"You're reading Martian!\"  \"That's right,\" Penrose told him. \"Just reading it right off. I don't get the two items after the atomic weight, though. They look like months of the Martian calendar. What ought they to be, Mort?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Tranter hesitated. \"Well, the next information after the atomic weight ought to be the period and group numbers. But those are words.\"  \"What would the numbers be for the first one, hydrogen?\"  \"Period One, Group One. One electron shell, one electron in the outer shell,\" Tranter told her. \"Helium's period one, too, but it has the outer--only--electron shell full, so it's in the group of inert elements.\"  \"_Trav, Trav._ _Trav's_ the first month of the year. And helium's _Trav, Yenth_; _Yenth_ is the eighth month.\"  \"The inert elements could be called Group Eight, yes. And the third element, lithium, is Period Two, Group One. That check?\"  \"It certainly does. _Sanv, Trav_; _Sanv's_ the second month. What's the first element in Period Three?\"  \"Sodium. Number Eleven.\"  That's right; it's _Krav, Trav_. Why, the names of the months are simply numbers, one to ten, spelled out.  \"_Doma_'s the fifth month. That was your first Martian word, Martha,\" Penrose told her. \"The word for five. And if _davas_ is the word for metal, and _sornhulva_ is chemistry and / or physics, I'll bet Tadavas Sornhulva is literally translated as: Of-Metal Matter-Knowledge. Metallurgy, in other words. I wonder what Mastharnorvod means.\" It surprised her that, after so long and with so much happening in the meantime, he could remember that. \"Something like 'Journal,' or 'Review,' or maybe 'Quarterly.'\"  \"We'll work that out, too,\" she said confidently. After this, nothing seemed impossible. \"Maybe we can find--\" Then she stopped short. \"You said 'Quarterly.' I think it was 'Monthly,' instead. It was dated for a specific month, the fifth one. And if _nor_ is ten, Mastharnorvod could be 'Year-Tenth.' And I'll bet we'll find that _masthar_ is the word for year.\" She looked at the table on the wall again. \"Well, let's get all these words down, with translations for as many as we can.\"  \"Let's take a break for a minute,\" Penrose suggested, getting out his cigarettes. \"And then, let's do this in comfort. Jeff, suppose you and Sid go across the hall and see what you find in the other room in the way of a desk or something like that, and a few chairs. There'll be a lot of work to do on this.\"  Sid Chamberlain had been squirming as though he were afflicted with ants, trying to contain himself. Now he let go with an excited jabber.  \"This is really it! _The_ it, not just it-of-the-week, like finding the "]]]
