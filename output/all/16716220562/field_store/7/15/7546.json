Γελῶ δὲ ὁρῶν γῆς περιόδος γράψαντας, πολλοὺς ἤδη καὶ οὐδένα νόον ἔχοντας ἐξηγησάμενον ὃι Ὠκεανόν τε ῥεόντα γράφουσι, πέριξ τήν τε γὴν ἐοῦσαν κυκλοτερέα ὡς ἀπὸ τόρνου.    [Greek: Gelô de horôn gês periodous grapsantas, pollous êdê kai   oudena noon echontas exêgêsamenon hoi Ôkeanon te rheonta graphousi,   perix tên te gên eousan kukloterea hôs apo tornou.]    “I cannot choose but laugh, (saith he) to see so many men venture to   describe the earths compasse, relating those things that are without   all sense, as that the Sea flowes about the World, and that the earth   it selfe is round as an Orbe.”  But this great ignorance is not so much to be admired in him, as in those learneder men of later times, when all sciences began to flourish in the World. Such was Saint _Austin_ who censures that relation of the Antipodes to be an incredible fable,[1] and with him agrees the eloquent _Lactantius_,[2]    _quid illi qui esse contrarios vestigiis nostris Antipodes putant?   num aliquid loquuntur? aut est quispiam tam ineptus, qui credat esse   homines, quorum vestigia sunt superiora quàm capita? aut ibi quæ apud   nos jacent inversa pendere? fruges & arbores deorsum versus crescere,   pluvias & nives, & grandinem sursum versus cadere in terram? &   miratur aliquis hortor pensiles inter septem mira narrari, quum   Philosophi, & agros & maria, & urbes & montes pensiles faciunt? &c._    “What (saith he) are they that thinke there are Antipodes, such as   walke with their feet against ours? doe they speake any likelyhood?   or is there any one so foolish as to believe that there are men whose   heeles are higher than their heads? that things which with us doe lie   on the ground doe hang there? that the Plants and Trees grow   downewards, that the haile, and raine, and snow fall upwards to the   earth? and doe wee admire the hanging Orchards amongst the seven   wonders, whereas here the Philosophers have made the Field and Seas,   the Cities and Mountaines hanging.”  What shall wee thinke (saith hee in _Plutarch_) that men doe clyng to that place like wormes, or hang by their clawes as Cats, or if wee suppose a man a little beyond the Center, to bee digging with a spade? is it likely (as it must bee according to this opinion) that the earth which hee loosened, should of it selfe ascend upwards? or else suppose two men with their middles about the center, the feete of the one being placed where the head of the other is, and so two other men crosse them, yet all these men thus situated according to this opinion should stand upright, and many other such grosse consequences would follow (saith hee) which a false imagination is not able to fancy as possible. Upon which considerations, _Bede_[3] also denies the being of any Antipodes,    _Neque enim Antipodarum ullatenus est Fabulis accommodandus assensus_,  “Nor should wee any longer assent to the Fable of Antipodes.” So also _Lucretius_ the Poet speaking of the same subject, sayes:    _Sed vanus stolidis hæc omnia finxerit error._[4]    [Sidenote 1: _De civit. Dei. lib. 16. cap. 9._]    [Sidenote 2: _Institut. l. 3. c. 24._]    [Sidenote 3: _De ratione temporum, Cap. 32._]    [Sidenote 4: _De nat. rerum, lib. 1._]  That some idle fancy faigned these for fooles to believe. Of this opinion was _Procopius Gazæus_,[1] but he was perswaded to it by another kinde of reason; for he thought that all the earth under us was sunke in the water, according to the saying of the Psalmist,[2] Hee hath founded the Earth upon the Seas, and therefore hee accounted it not inhabited by any. Nay _Tostatus_ a man of later yeeres and generall learning doth also confidently deny that there are any such Antipodes, though the reason which hee urges for it bee not so absurde as the former, for the Apostles, saith hee,[3] travelled through the whole habitable world, but they never passed the Equinoctiall; and if you answer that they are said to goe through all the earth, because they went through all the knowne world, hee replies, that this is not sufficient, since Christ would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of his truth,[4] and therefore ’tis requisite that they should have travelled thither also, if there had been any inhabitants, especially since he did expressely command them to goe and teach all nations, and preach the Gospell through the whole world,[5] and therefore he thinkes that as there are no men, so neither are there seas, or rivers, or any other conveniency for habitation: ’tis commonly related of one _Virgilius_, that he was excommunicated and condemned for a Heretique by _Zachary_ Bishop of _Rome_, because hee was not of the same opinion. But _Baronius_ saies,[6] it was because hee thought there was another habitable world within ours. How ever, you may well enough discerne in these examples how confident many of these great Schollars were in so grosse an errour, how unlikely, what an incredible thing it seemed to them, that there should be any Antipodes, and yet now this truth is as certaine and plaine, as sense or demonstration can make it. This then which I now deliver is not to be rejected; though it may seeme to contradict the common opinion.    [Sidenote 1: _Comment. in 1. Cap. Gen._]    [Sidenote 2: _Psal. 24. 2._]    [Sidenote 3: _Comment. in_ 1. Genes.]    [Sidenote 4: 1 Tim. 2. 4.]    [Sidenote 5: Mat. 28. 19]    [Sidenote 6: _Annal. Eccles. A.D. 748._]  2. Grosse absurdities have beene entertained by generall consent. I might instance in many remarkeable examples, but I will onely speake of the supposed labour of the Moone in her eclipses, because this is neerest to the chiefe matter in hand, and was received as a common opinion amongst many of the ancients, and therefore _Plutarch_ speaking of a Lunary eclipse, relates, that at such times ’twas a custome amongst the _Romanes_ (the most civill and learned people in the world) to sound brasse Instruments, and hold great torches toward the heaven. Τῶν δὲ Ρωμαίων (ὥσπερ ἐστω ἐνομισμένον) χαλκοῦ τε πατάγοις ἀνακαλουμένων τὸ φῶς αὐτὸς καὶ πυρὰ πολλὰ δαλοῖς καὶ δασσὶν ἀνεχόντων πρὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν,[1] for by this meanes they supposed the Moone was much eased in her labours, and therfore _Ovid_ calls such loud Instruments the auxiliaries or helpes of the Moone.[2]    _Cum frustra resonant æra auxiliaria Lunæ._  and therefore the Satyrist too describing a loud scold, saies, she was able to make noise enough to deliver the labouring Moone.[3]    _Vna laboranti poterit succurrere Lunæ._    [Sidenote 1: _In vita Paul. Æmil._]    [Sidenote 2: _Metam. l. 4._]    [Sidenote 3: _Iuven. Sat. 6_]  Now the reason of all this their ceremonie, was, because they feared the world would fall asleepe, when one of its eyes began to winke, and therefore they would doe what they could by loud sounds to rouse it from its drowsinesse, and keepe it awake by bright torches, to bestow that light upon it which it began to lose. Some of them thought hereby to keepe the Moone in her orbe, whereas otherwise she would have fallen downe upon the earth, and the world would have lost one of its lights, for the credulous people believed, that Inchanters, and Witches could bring the Moone downe, which made _Virgil_ say,    _Cantus & è cœlo possunt deducere Lunam._  And those Wizards knowing the times of her eclipses, would then threaten to shew their skill, by pulling her out of her orbe. So that when the silly multitude saw that she began to looke red, they presently feared they should lose the benefit of her light, and therefore made a great noise that she might not heare the sound of those Charmes, which would otherwise bring her downe, and this is rendered for a reason of this custome by _Pliny_ and _Propertius_:    _Cantus & è curru lunam deducere tentant,   Et facerent, si non æra repulsa sonent._[1]    [Sidenote 1: _Nat. hist. lib. 2. c. 12._]  _Plutarch_ gives another reason of it, and he sayes, ’tis because they would hasten the Moone out of the darke shade wherein shee was involv’d, that so she might bring away the soules of those Saints that inhabit within her, which cry out by reason they are then deprived of their wonted happinesse, and cannot heare the musicke of the Spheares, but are forced to behold the torments, and wailing of those damned soules which are represented to them as they are tortured in the region of the aire, but whether this or what ever else was the meaning of this superstition, yet certainly ’twas a very ridiculous custome, and bewrayed a great ignorance of those ancient times, especially since it was not onely received by the vulgar, such as were men of lesse note and learning, but believed also, by the more famous and wiser sort, such as were those great Poets, _Stesichorus_ and _Pindar_. And not onely amongst the more sottish heathens, who might account that Planet to be one of their Gods, but the primitive Christians also were in this kinde guilty; which made S. _Ambrose_ so tartly to rebuke those of his time, when he said,    _Tum turbatur carminibus Globus Lunæ, quando calicibus turbantur &   oculi_.  “When your heads are troubled with cups, then you thinke the Moone to be troubled with charmes.”  And for this reason also did _Maximus_ a Bishop,[1] write a Homily against it, wherein hee shewed the absurditie of that foolish superstition. I remember, that _Ludovicus Uives_ relates a more ridiculous story of a people that imprisoned an Asse for drinking up the Moone, whose image appearing in the water was covered with a cloud, as the Asse was drinking, for which the poore beast was afterward brought to the barre to receive a sentence according to his deserts, where the grave Senate being set to examine the matter, one of the Counsell (perhaps wiser than the rest) rises up, and out of his deepe judgement, thinkes it not fit that their Towne should lose its Moone, but that rather the Asse should be cut up, and that taken"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19103"],["title","The Discovery of a World in the Moone (#2)"],["body"," of him, which sentence being approved by the rest of those Politicians, as the subtillest way for the conclusion of the matter was accordingly performed. But whether this tale were true or no I will not question, however there is absurdity enough in that former custome of the ancients, that may confirme the truth to be proved, and plainly declare the insufficiency of common opinion to adde true worth or estimation unto any thing. So that from that which I have said may be gathered thus much.    [Sidenote 1: _Turinens. Episc._]  1. That a new truth may seeme absurd and impossible not onely to the    vulgar, but to those also who are otherwise wise men, and excellent    schollers; and hence it will follow, that every new thing which    seemes to oppose common Principles is not presently to be rejected,    but rather to be pry’d into with a diligent enquiry, since there    are many things which are yet hid from us, and reserv’d for future    discovery.  2. That it is not the commonnesse of an opinion that can priviledge it    for a truth, the wrong way is sometime a well beaten path, whereas    the right way (especially to hidden truths) may bee lesse trodden    and more obscure.  True indeed, the strangeness of this opinion will detract much from its credit; but yet we should know that nothing is in its selfe strange, since every naturall effect has an equall dependance upon its cause, and with the like necessity doth follow from it, so that ’tis our ignorance which makes things appeare so, and hence it comes to passe that many more evident truths seeme incredible to such who know not the causes of things: you may as soone perswade some Country peasants that the Moone is made of greene Cheese (as wee say) as that ’tis bigger than his Cart-wheele, since both seeme equally to contradict his sight, and hee has not reason enough to leade him farther than his senses. Nay, suppose (saith _Plutarch_) a Philosopher should be educated in such a secret place, where hee might not see either Sea or River, and afterwards should be brought out where one might shew him the great Ocean telling him the quality of that water, that it is blackish, salt, and not potable, and yet there were many vast creatures of all formes living in it, which make use of the water as wee doe of the aire, questionlesse he would laugh at all this, as being monstrous lies & fables, without any colour of truth. Just so will this truth which I now deliver appeare unto others; because we never dreamt of any such matter as a world in the Moone, because the state of that place hath as yet been vailed from our knowledge, therefore wee can scarcely assent to any such matter. Things are very hardly received which are altogether strange to our thoughts and our senses. The soule may with lesse difficulty be brought to believe any absurdity, when as it has formerly beene acquainted with some colours and probabilities for it, but when a new, and an unheard of truth shall come before it, though it have good grounds and reasons, yet the understanding is afraid of it as a stranger, and dares not admit it into its beliefe without a great deale of reluctancy and tryall. And besides things that are not manifested to the senses, are not assented unto without some labour of mind, some travaile and discourse of the understanding, and many lazie soules had rather quietly repose themselves in an easie errour, then take paines to search out the truth. The strangenesse then of this opinion which I now deliver will be a great hinderance to its beliefe, but this is not to be respected by reason it cannot bee helped. I have stood the longer in the Preface, because that prejudice which the meere title of the booke may beget cannot easily be removed without a great deale of preparation, and I could not tell otherwise how to rectifie the thoughts of the Reader for an impartiall survey of the following discourse.  I must needs confesse, though I had often thought with my selfe that it was possible there might be a world in the Moone, yet it seemed such an uncouth opinion that I never durst discover it, for feare of being counted singular and ridiculous, but afterward having read _Plutarch_, _Galilæus_, _Keplar_, with some others, and finding many of mine owne thoughts confirmed by such strong authority, I then concluded that it was not onely possible there might bee, but probable that there was another habitable world in that Planet. In the prosecuting of this assertion, I shall first endeavour to cleare the way from such doubts as may hinder the speed or ease of farther progresse; and because the suppositions imply’d in this opinion may seeme to contradict the principles of reason or faith, it will be requisite that I first remove this scruple, shewing the conformity of them to both these, and proving those truths that may make way for the rest, which I shall labour to performe in the second, third, fourth, and fifth Chapters, and then proceede to confirme such Propositions, which doe more directly belong to the maine point in hand.     Proposition 2.  _That a plurality of worlds doth not contradict any principle of   reason or faith._   Tis reported of _Aristotle_ that when hee saw the bookes of _Moses_ he commended them for such a majesticke stile as might become a God, but withall hee censured that manner of writing to be very unfitting for a Philosopher because there was nothing proved in them, but matters were delivered as if they would rather command than perswade beliefe. And ’tis observed that hee sets downe nothing himselfe, but he confirmes it by the strongest reasons that may be found, there being scarce an argument of force for any subject in Philosophy which may not bee picked out of his writings, and therefore ’tis likely if there were in reason a necessity of one onely world, that hee would have found out some such necessary proofe as might confirme it: Especially since hee labours for it so much in two whole Chapters. But now all the arguments which he himselfe urges in this subject,[1] are very weake and farre enough from having in them any convincing power. Therefore ’tis likely that a plurality of worlds doth not contradict any principle of reason. However, I will set downe the two chiefe of his arguments from his owne workes, and from them you may guesse the force of the other. The 1. is this,[2] since every heavy body doth naturally tend downwards, and every light body upwards, what a hudling and confusion must there bee if there were two places for gravity and two places for lightnesse: for it is probable that the Earth of that other World would fall downe to this Center, and so mutually the aire and fire here ascend to those Regions in the other, which must needes much derogate from the providence of nature, and cause a great disorder in his workes. To this I answere, that if you will consider the nature of gravity, you will plainely see there is no ground to feare any such confusion, for heavinesse is nothing else but such a quality as causes a propension in ’its subject to tend downewards towards its owne Centre, so that for some of that earth to come hither would not bee said a fall but an ascension, since it moved from its owne place, and this would bee impossible (saith _Ruvio_) because against nature,[3] and therefore no more to bee feared than the falling of the Heavens.    [Sidenote 1: _De Cœlo_ l. 1. c. 8. 9.]    [Sidenote 2: _Ibid._]    [Sidenote 3: _De Cœlo_ l. 1. c. 9. q. 1.]  Another Argument hee had from his master _Plato_,[1] that there is but one World, because there is but one first mover, God.[2]    [Sidenote 1: _Metaphys._ l. 12. c. 8.]    [Sidenote 2: _Diog. Laert. lib._ 3.]  But here I may deny the consequence, since a plurality of worlds doth not take away the unity of the first mover.    _Vt enim forma substantialis, sic primum efficiens apparentem   solummodo multiplicitatem induit per signatam materiam_  (saith a Countreyman of ours.)[1] As the substantiall forme, so the efficient cause hath onely an appearing multiplicity from its particular matter. You may see this point more largely handled, and these Arguments more fully answered by _Plutarch_ in his Booke (why Oracles are silent) and _Iacob Carpentarius_ in his comment on _Alcinous_.    [Sidenote 1: _Nic. Hill. de Philosop. Epic. partic. 379._]  But our opposites the Interpreters themselves, (who too often doe _jurare in verba magistri_) will grant that there is not any strength in these consequences, and certainely their such weake arguments could not convince that wise Philosopher, who in his other opinions was wont to bee swayed by the strength and power of reason: wherefore I should rather thinke that he had some by-respect, which made him first assent to this opinion, and afterwards strive to prove it. Perhaps it was because hee feared to displease his scholler _Alexander_, of whom ’tis related[1] that he wept to heare a disputation of another world, since he had not then attained the Monarchy of this, his restlesse wide heart would have esteemed this Globe of Earth not big enough for him, if there had beene another, which made the Satyrist say of him,    _Æstuat infœlix angusto limite mundi._[2]    “That he did vexe himselfe and sweate in his desires, as being pend   up in a narrow roome, when hee was confin’d but to one world.”  Before he thought to seate himselfe next the Gods, but now when hee had done his best, hee must be content with some equall, or perhaps superiour Kings.    [Sidenote 1: _Plutarch. de tranq. anim._]    [Sidenote 2: _Iuvenal._]  It may be, that _Aristotle_ was moved to this opinion, that hee might thereby take from _Alexander_ the occasion of this feare and discontent, or else, perhaps, _Aristotle_ himselfe was as loth to hold the possibility of a world which he could not discover, as _Alexander_ was to heare of one which he could not conquer. Tis likely that some such by-respect moved him to this opinion, since the arguments he urges for it are"]]]
