He saw the \"make-up,\" and recognized the clothes as some he had seen on the Kansan.  \"What were you up to?\" he demanded, with threatening emphasis. He saw forms moving in the campus, and he did not want to tarry with Pike.  \"Just a little sport!\" Pike whined. He was completely crushed.  \"You lie, Donald Pike! You had some object. I can almost guess what it was. You imitated Badger's voice and way of speaking, when you jumped on me. You are wearing Badger's clothing. That make-up is intended to lead any one who sees you into thinking you were Buck Badger. You wanted to make me believe that Badger had assaulted me.\"  \"Just a joke!\" Pike pleaded. \"Merriwell, I didn't mean anything, only to have a bit of sport. That is honest. I didn't know it was you.\"  \"Ah! That last sounds as if you meant it. I hardly think you did know who you were tackling. I think I shall take you over to Badger's room, and let him see you just as you are. Come along!\"  Pike was not anxious to be seen by the men who were crossing the campus, so he moved along, with Frank at his side.  Frank was thinking rapidly, in an effort to understand Pike's motives.  \"I want to know why you leaped on me in that cowardly way, and struck me when I was down. You wouldn't have served Badger that way! And if you wanted to have a little fun with Badger, you would not have disguised yourself and imitated his way of speaking. That story don't go with me, Pike!\"  Pike was watching for a chance to escape, intending to make a dash for liberty at the first opportunity.  \"You are disguised as Badger. Badger would not assault me that way, for Badger is a man! But you wanted to make some one think he had been assaulted by Badger. That one must be Bart Hodge!\"  Pike started to run, but Frank caught him by the collar, and jerked him back.  \"Don't be in a hurry, Pike! I've seen you through and through for some time, and understand your little game of this evening.\"  Donald Pike walked on for a time peaceably enough, but he was only watching for an opportunity to break away. Again he fancied the opportunity had come. But no sooner did he start than Frank tripped him, and he fell sprawling. Before he could get up, Frank's hand was on his collar.  He made another fierce struggle as soon as he was on his feet, only to discover that he was as helpless as a child in the hands of Frank Merriwell. He had never dreamed that Merriwell was possessed of such strength and skill.  The shadows were heavier at this point, and Merriwell kept a grip on Pike's collar.  \"See here, Pike!\" he exclaimed. \"If you try anything of that kind again I shall simply knock you down. You are going with me, if I have to tie and drag you. So you might as well come along quietly and save trouble.\"  \"I shall have you arrested for this!\" Pike blustered, now that whining and begging and fighting had failed.  \"Do! I think your friends would enjoy hearing the story of your remarkable masquerade told in court. Go ahead with the proceedings, Donald. Just now you are going with me, regardless of the after consequences.\"  Pike caught at a post, but Merriwell jerked him away from it, and then hurried him rapidly on in the direction of Badger's room. Pike was sure Badger was not in, and began to think that he might save himself bruises and rough treatment by apparent acquiescence.  \"I will go with you,\" he finally panted, \"but under protest. And I shall make you sorry for this outrage. You have no right to treat me thus.\"  Merriwell did not answer, but kept a hand on Pike's collar while he conducted him up the stairs. To Pike's consternation, Buck Badger was in the room and the door was open.  Before Pike could quite make up his mind to try again to escape, Merriwell had bundled him through the doorway.  Badger scrambled up.  \"There is your friend!\" said Merriwell, pointing a finger accusingly at Pike, who was too confused and humiliated to speak. \"He disguised himself that way, and attacked me awhile ago near my room, thinking I was Bart Hodge. He has found out his mistake. He wanted to make Hodge think that you had done the dirty work, so that you and Hodge would lock horns the first time you met, and there would be trouble again all around the camp. He is a contemptible and cowardly puppy, and I feel that I have soiled my hands by touching him. But I wanted you to see him in that rig, and know him as he is.\"  A fierce denial was on the lips of Donald Pike, but he had not the courage to utter it. He saw that something more than denials would be necessary to explain matters. The Westerner was as speechless as Pike, and Merriwell turned away.  \"I reckon we'll have a little explanation of this, Pike!\" were the words Merry heard as he reached the head of the stairs. They were spoken in an awesome tone of voice, and came from Badger's lips.  Then the door closed with a bang, and he knew that the Kansan had barred the way of Pike's escape from the room. The next morning Frank received this note:       \"MR. FRANK MERRIWELL: Pike and I had a settlement last night. He      tried to lie out of the thing, but I made him confess to the whole      truth. Then I kicked him down-stairs. We are not rooming together      any more whatever. BUCK BADGER.\"     CHAPTER IV.  AT THE HOME OF WINNIE LEE.   Frank Merriwell seemed the personification of spring as he approached the residence of Fairfax Lee, the next afternoon. Spring is the time when the wine of life flows warm through the veins of Nature. Its face holds the bloom of youth and the smile of hope. Its heart is all aglow with the joy of living. The golden summer is before it; and it has no dead past, for the winter seems to belong to the year that has gone.  A handsomer specimen of young manhood could not have been found. The flowering spray in his buttonhole seemed part of the jaunty new suit which so became him. He was clean-looking and energetically wholesome. From the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was nattily neat, yet he was as far from being dudish in appearance as it is possible for one to be. He looked to be what he was--strong, and lithe-limbed, almost physically perfect, with a handsome, intelligent face, hopeful, courageous heart, and active brain.  Yet many things had come to trouble him in the past twenty-four hours, even though his bright face showed not a trace of their annoying effect. Chief of these things, of course, was the defection of Bart Hodge. Hodge had gone away stubbornly angry, and Merriwell had not seen him since the moment of parting.  Every member of the \"flock\" was hot against Hodge, and had not hesitated to speak plainly. Hodge's rebellious spirit had rallied them round Merriwell as one man. Browning and Diamond had even argued that he ought not to be longer recognized as a member of Merriwell's set. The only one who had ventured to stand up for him, aside from Merriwell himself, was Harry Rattleton. Frank had defended him to the last, insisting that allowances should be made for the peculiarities of Bart's disposition, and asserting that he would be found all right in the end.  Frank was thinking of all this as he drew near the home of Winnie Lee. His intention was to call on Inza and have a talk with her about the 'Varsity boat-races at New London in June, for Inza was the \"mascot\" of the Yale crew that was to meet Harvard at New London. In addition, he expected to inform her and her friends of the arrangements made for the ball-game with Hartford on Saturday.  He looked about him after he had tripped lightly up the steps and rang the bell. The Lee home was in a fashionable and exclusive part of New Haven, and the spacious grounds were beginning to take on beauty and color under the reviving influences of spring. A fountain, shot through with rainbow hues, was spraying a marble sprite, while a rheumatic gardener troweled round the rim of a loamy flower-bed.  Winnie, who had observed Merriwell's approach, came to the door herself to admit him.  \"Oh, you didn't come to see me?\" she asked, when he inquired for Inza.  \"That would be pleasant enough, but it wouldn't do to make Buck jealous!\"  He laughed in his cheery way.  \"I don't think it would be easy to make him jealous of you now,\" she answered. \"And I'm so glad he is to pitch for you Saturday! I want to thank you for that, myself. It was just like you to send such an invitation.\"  Merriwell's eyes dropped under her earnest look. He dared not tell her just then that the invitation had been procured by Dunstan Kirk.  \"Who told you he is to pitch Saturday?\"  \"Why, he told me so this morning himself.\"  \"And, of course, you have told Elsie and Inza?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, I want to see Inza, and have a talk with her, about the New London races. So I think I will take a car for Mrs. Moran's.\"  Winnie had informed him that both Inza and Elsie had gone on an errand of mercy to the home of the grandmother of Barney Lynn.  \"And you won't come in, even a little while? You prefer their society to mine, I see! I am ashamed of you, Frank Merriwell! You are not as gallant as you used to be.\"  Her voice was merry and her heart light.  \"Some other afternoon or evening I shall be glad to come in and talk you to death. Just now I am pressed for time.\"  \"I ought to have gone down there with them,\" she confessed. \"But it seemed that I couldn't get away. Frank, you don't know what angels of mercy those girls have been! Elsie found out that Mrs. Moran was starving and dying by inches for lack of proper food and medicines, and since then she and Inza have been down there every day, and often two or three times a day.\"  \"I trust they don't venture after nightfall!\"  Frank was thinking of a fight Jack Ready had while rescuing Elsie from the drunken ruffian, Jim Haskins.  Then he thanked Winnie for her invitation, said good-by, and hurried away to catch the first car going in the direction which he wished to take.  \"I hope Badger is entirely worthy of her,\" he thought, his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19402"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Reward (#5)"],["body","on Winnie Lee. \"She is a fine girl, and if he gets her he will get a prize. Now, if they don't pass me, coming back in another car! Winnie hasn't the least idea that Buck was intoxicated when he went aboard the _Crested Foam_, and she shall never know it from me!\"  Neither of the girls heard Merriwell's gentle rap on Mrs. Moran's door, and he pushed into the house without further ceremony, feeling sure that they were busy in caring for the old lady or that her condition was such that they could not leave her. Then, looking through the doorway at the right of the corridor, his gaze fell on a pleasant sight.  The girls were seated by the bed, Elsie holding one of Mrs. Moran's wasted hands in her own warm palms, while Inza was reading to the old woman from a little copy of the New Testament.  Merriwell stopped for a moment, for his entrance had been unnoticed. Somehow, the pathos of the scene inexpressibly touched him.  \"They are angels of mercy, just as Winnie said!\" was his thought.  Inza had an excellent reading voice, as pure and liquid as falling water. It was a pleasure to listen to it. Frank had often heard her read, but it seemed to him never with such expression as at that moment. The sunlight, falling through the small west window, illuminated her face, making it almost radiant, and touched with brighter tints Elsie's crown of golden hair.  \"I wish I were a painter!\" he thought. \"I should like to preserve that scene. If I could have that to hang in my room, it would be like a flash of sunshine to look at. But no painter could do it justice. There are certain things that can't be painted, and this is one of them.\"  He noisily shifted his feet to call attention to his presence, and Inza looked up. The color flooded her cheeks, and her dark eyes showed surprise.  \"Why, Frank!\" she gasped. \"How did you come to be here?\"  Elsie also started up.  \"How did you get in?\" she asked.  \"Opened the door and walked in. You were so busy you didn't hear my knock, so I just took the liberty.\"  Mrs. Moran stirred, and turning feebly, looked at him, her eyes showing recognition.  \"I am very glad to see you!\" she whispered, as he advanced toward the bed, and she stretched out one of the feeble hands. \"Sometimes I think that I am not long for this world. I should have died here, I feel sure, if it had not been for these girls. And your other friend, Miss Winnie, has been very good, too! I hope you are quite well, Mr. Merriwell!\"  \"Quite well! Don't let me disturb you. Inza was reading to you. Let her go on. I will sit here in this chair.\"  So Inza read again, until the old woman was tired; after which the trio left the house, and walked down to the car line, where they took a car for the residence of the Honorable Fairfax Lee.  \"I went to Lee's to see you,\" Frank explained, \"for I wanted to talk over some details of the trip to New London and the June races. The mascot of the crew hasn't been down to the boat-house this week. And I wanted to invite both of you, and Winnie, to the ball-game Saturday forenoon.\"  \"I am sorry about Bart!\" Inza exclaimed. \"But he will come round all right, don't you think?\"  \"He may not play in this game, but he will see how foolish he is, and be heartily ashamed of it by and by.\"  \"Who is to catch for you, then?\"  \"Jack Ready!\"  \"What?\"  \"Perhaps you haven't seen Ready catch? He is a good one!\"  \"You need a strong battery, Frank!\" Elsie asserted.  \"Yes, like you and Hodge,\" nodded Inza. \"I'm afraid Badger and Ready will not be able to work well together. They haven't played together before, I believe?\"  Inza was full of bright, snappy conversation, as they sped homeward in the car with Merriwell. But Elsie was unusually silent.  \"She can't get Mrs. Moran out of her mind,\" Frank thought.  He left them at the door, for the hour had grown so late that he felt he could not just then spare the time to go into the house, much as he wanted to do so. Inza and Elsie went up-stairs together. Winnie was out or in another part of the house.  Inza shrugged her shapely shoulders.  \"What is the matter, Elsie, dear?\"  Elsie's lips were quivering as she faced round and confronted her friend.  \"You ought to know what is the matter, Inza Burrage!\" she declared.  \"I'm not the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter,\" said Inza, a bit defiantly. \"How should I know?\"  \"You do know!\"  \"I should say that you are showing a bit of jealousy, if pressed for an answer.\"  \"And haven't I a right to be jealous, Inza?\" Elsie demanded.  \"Haven't I a right to talk to Frank Merriwell and be nice to him, if I want to?\"  \"Of course, Inza, but--well--you know----\"  \"It seems to me, Elsie, that you came between Frank and me once! Isn't it so? Frank cared for me before he ever did for you. You came between us. I haven't come between you and Frank yet, but if I should do so would it be any worse than what you did?\"  \"Oh, I thought that was past!\" cried Elsie, flushing and trembling. \"You never understood me, Inza!\"  \"And do you fancy for a moment that you understand me?\"  \"Perhaps not; but I can see--I'm not blind!\"  \"Oh, yes, jealous people can see things that no one else can,\" laughed Inza, with a provoking toss of her proud head.  \"Do you want to make me hate you forever, Inza Burrage?\" Elsie cried. \"You hurt me! You are heartless!\"  A sudden look of deep pain shone in Inza's face, changing her manner in a twinkling, and she turned away as if trying to conceal it.  \"Of course, nothing ever hurts me!\" she said bitterly. \"I am steel and iron, and all that! Your heart is tender, and such things hurt you!\"  Elsie did not know what to say. She had tried to feel for a time that Inza had ceased to care for Frank, and then had told herself that Inza had no longer any right to care for him. She was beginning to realize that questions of right and wrong cut very little figure in affairs of the heart--that, in fact, love obeys no such laws.  When Inza turned back, her face had lost its trace of pain.  \"Elsie,\" she said, \"we will not quarrel about Frank, for Frank's sake. It would distress him if he knew it. He must never know it. Promise me that you will not say a word to him about it.\"  \"Of course I won't say anything about it,\" Elsie agreed. \"I should fear to, and I shouldn't want to.\"  \"Then we'll keep it to ourselves. You have discovered that I haven't ceased to care for Frank Merriwell. Perhaps I never shall. But that is neither here nor there.\"  The old wave of jealousy swept across the tortured soul of Elsie Bellwood.  \"Do you mean that you intend to win him if you can, after you have told me that you surrender all claim on him?\"  \"I haven't said anything of the kind. But I claim the right and privilege of talking to him and with him as much as I please. You and he are not engaged, even if he has seemed to prefer you. He may change his mind, just as he did before, but remember that I'm not trying to get him to!\"  \"Then you do intend to try to win him?\"  \"My dear, you must recognize the fact that Frank is the one to do the winning. I shall never run after any man.\"  Elsie's blue eyes flashed.  \"Do you mean to insinuate that I would?\"  \"I thought we weren't going to quarrel!\"  The look of pain came back into the dark, handsome face, and this time Elsie saw it. A feeling of remorse began to tug at her heart.  \"I am not worthy of Frank Merriwell,\" she said softly. \"I know that. But I thought----\"  \"You thought nothing could hurt me!\"  \"No, not that. I thought he was to be mine, and recently that hope has been slipping through my fingers. I can't tell you, Inza, how I have felt.\"  \"I can understand!\" said the dark-haired girl. \"I have good cause to understand!\"  \"I know that really you are more worthy of him, Inza, than I am. I have always thought that, when I wasn't crazy with the fear that you might win him away from me. But I just can't surrender my claim, slender as you think it!\"  \"For Frank's sake,\" repeated Inza, \"we will not quarrel about him! As for these other questions----\"  Winnie's light step was heard in the hall, and the sentence died unfinished.     CHAPTER V.  HODGE'S REPENTANCE.   Bart Hodge absented himself from class and lecture, but later that night, after all the members of the \"flock\" had departed from Merriwell's room, Bart came in. His face was flushed and feverish.  \"I don't care what the other fellows think, Merry!\" he said, dropping into a chair as if he felt that he had no right there. \"But I do care what you think! I went away in a huff, saying to myself that I'd never come back until you sent for me, when I knew that you wouldn't send for me, and that I would come back. And here I am.\"  \"How could I have sent for you, Bart?\" Merry questioned. \"I knew you would feel differently when you had time to think it all over, and I told the fellows so.\"  \"I don't care for their opinions!\" Bart snarled. \"I'd never come back for any of them!\"  \"They are my friends!\"  \"I've been miserable ever since. I have felt like a cur as I've sneaked round town. You needn't try to stop me! You are the truest friend I ever had, and I've treated you like a dog. I know it, and I'm sorry for it.\"  \"I am your friend, Bart, because I understand you, and appreciate you. The others would think as much of you as I do, if they understood you as well. We'll not talk any more about this matter, if you're willing, but just turn in for the night and say nothing about it.\"  \"How can you overlook a thing like that?\" Hodge asked.  \"Because I knew all the time that your better nature condemned what you did, and that you would by and by yield to your better nature. The man who meets a powerful temptation and finally masters it is stronger really than one who never is tempted. I forgave you long ago, Bart, and would have told you so if you had come back. I was angry at the time, but I didn't remain angry.\"  \"I've come back to tell you that I'll catch for you to-morrow--Saturday. I swore I'd never catch for Buck Badger, but I will. I'll catch for the "]]]
