[From the Guardian:]  Dear and valued co-workers:  The visit of our dear and cherished sister and exemplary co-worker, Martha, to your shores is approaching and I feel confident that her collaboration with you will lend an unprecedented impetus to the advancement of the Faith. Laden with laurels, animated by an unquenchable spirit, armed with a faith that none can surpass, she will, I feel sure, contribute magnificently to the magnificent work her co-workers in Australia and New Zealand have so valiantly achieved and are so energetically and methodically extending. My prayers for you and for her will continue to be offered with a heart filled with pride, joy and gratitude.  Your true brother, Shoghi.      LETTER OF FEBRUARY 15TH, 1939   February 15th, 1939.  Dear Miss Brooks:  Your letter of January 17th, enclosing one addressed to the Guardian by the Sydney Spiritual Assembly, have both duly arrived, and their contents read by him with deepest satisfaction and with feelings of unbounded gratitude.  He is writing the Sydney Assembly separately, assuring them that Miss Davis who is on a world tour, would be most welcome to visit the Holy Shrines in Haifa and Bahjí, but he himself is exceedingly sorry not to be able to meet her, as he is at present away from the Holy Land, and may not be back to Haifa before some time. He hopes, nevertheless, Miss Davis will benefit from her close contact with the Sacred Places of the Faith, and will gain such experiences as will stimulate still further her interest in the Cause, and lead her gradually to fully and unreservedly embrace its truth.  Regarding the extensive preparations made by the N.S.A. in connection with the teaching travels of our indefatigable and highly-esteemed Bahá’í sister Miss Martha Root throughout Australia and New-Zealand; the Guardian feels truly delighted and profoundly grateful to your Assembly for the befitting welcome you have extended to her, and for the arrangements you have made for her to broadcast her speeches, and to contact as many individuals and organisations as her time and health permit. You are certainly fully availing yourself of the opportunity of her presence in your midst to further intensify the campaign of teaching throughout Australia, and you can rest assured that Bahá’u’lláh will reinforce and bless your endeavours for the accomplishment of so vital and so sacred a task.  The draft for thirty pounds which you had enclosed in your letter, representing the contribution of the believers of Australia and New-Zealand toward the International Fund of the Cause, has been received with grateful appreciation by our beloved Guardian, and he wishes your Assembly to kindly convey to all the friends his deep sense of gratitude, as well as his profound admiration, for the exemplary devotion and loyal attachment to the Cause that has prompted them to make such generous donations.  With renewed and heartfelt thanks for your very kind letter, and reciprocating your greetings,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dearly-beloved co-workers:  I am so glad and grateful for the plans you have conceived for the reception, and organisation of the work, of Martha during her visit to your shores. The community of the believers in Australia and New Zealand is making remarkable progress in every phase of its activities, and deserves the highest praise in its magnificent and incessant labours. I am proud of the quality of its faith and the range of its achievements. May the Beloved infuse into each one of its members a greater measure of His power and of His spirit that will enable them to seek nobler heights in their historic service to His Cause!  Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi.      LETTER OF MARCH 17TH, 1939   March 17th, 1939.  Dear Miss Brooks,  Your communication of February the 12th addressed to our beloved Guardian, informing him of Martha’s safe arrival in Australia, has been received, and he was made truly happy to know how cordially and befittingly she had been welcomed by the friends. The wide acclamation with which you have greeted her upon her arrival, and the kind solicitude and warm affection you have displayed towards her by arranging for dear Dr. Bolton to give her the necessary treatment soon after her landing in Adelaide—such spontaneous expressions of your deep set admiration and love for this valiant and indefatigable star-servant of the Cause must have surely greatly warmed and touched her heart.  Your N.S.A., no less than the local assemblies of Perth and Adelaide, has undoubtedly spared no effort to use her presence as an opportunity for giving the Faith every publicity possible through both the radio and the press. It is to be hoped that before long the results of this campaign of publicity will be made apparent, and a good number of sincere and intelligent inquirers will be led to investigate and seriously study the Teachings, and enrol later on in the Community.  While the Guardian wishes the friends to take full advantage of Martha’s presence and invite her to speak and teach as frequently as her energies permit, yet he would advise that they should also take great care lest her health be seriously impaired through overwork, specially as she is already so frail, having extensively travelled and tirelessly laboured for a whole year throughout India. He would further entreat the believers to join him in ardently supplicating Bahá’u’lláh to continue bestowing upon our well-beloved and distinguished sister all the strength and energy that she requires for the continuation and successful termination of her teaching tour throughout Australia and New-Zealand.  With reference to Mr. and Mrs. Bolton’s request for permission to visit Haifa during next October or November, the Guardian wishes you to assure them that they would be most welcome to undertake this pilgrimage through which, he hopes, they will get refreshed spiritually and filled with renewed vigour and added determination to labour for the further promotion of the Faith upon their return home.  With the season’s best greetings to you and all the friends,  Yours ever in His Service, H. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dear and valued co-worker:  How deeply I appreciate what you and your dear collaborators are achieving for the success of Martha’s work amidst you. My heart brims over with gratitude for the manner in which you approach your task, discharge your duties and extend the range of your local and national activities. With your deeds you are demonstrating in that far-off continent what the power of the Greatest Name can achieve when it operates through channels that are pure, and receptive to its outpouring grace. My prayers are being continually offered for you all. Rest assured and be happy.  Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi.      LETTER OF JULY 12TH, 1939   July 12th, 1939.  Dear Miss Brooks,  On behalf of our beloved Guardian I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your deeply-appreciated message written on behalf of our Australian N.S.A., and of various materials, including Assembly reports and photographs of the Yerrinbool Summer-School, mailed under separate cover, all of which reached him safely, and for which kindly convey his heart’s deepest gratitude to your Assembly.  He has read with great pleasure the account of Miss Root’s last few weeks in Australia, and feels exceedingly gratified and thankful at this renewed evidence of the loving hospitality so spontaneously and generously extended to her by all the friends in each center she visited, and wishes me, in particular, to convey to you and to dear Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne his special thanks for having kindly offered to accompany our precious and well-beloved sister throughout the last stages of her journey to Melbourne and Tasmania. May Bahá’u’lláh richly reward you with His choicest blessings for all the tender care and affection you lavished upon her all through her teaching itinerary, and may He sustain, strengthen and guide you in your endeavours to further enrich and consolidate the notable teaching results she was able to accomplish in your midst during all these months.  The Guardian was highly encouraged to hear of the news of the confirmation of Miss Lamprill’s friend, and earnestly hopes and prays that through the combined, sustained, and loving exertions of these two dear believers the Cause will gradually make a headway in Hobart, and a group of well-confirmed souls will soon be established in that center. Kindly convey to these friends the expression of his warmest good wishes for the extension and success of their labours in service to our beloved Faith, and do urge them whole-heartedly, joyously and confidently persevere in their task of promulgating the message in Hobart.  With regard to Mrs. Routh’s request for permission to visit Haifa; much as the Guardian desires her to undertake such longed for visit to the Holy Shrines, he feels that owing to the continued disturbances agitating the Holy Land, and which give no sign of abating, it would be inadvisable for her to come at such a dangerous time. He hopes some day when the situation will have returned to normal in Palestine, she will have an opportunity of undertaking this pilgrimage.  Assuring you, and your newly-elected fellow-members in the N.S.A. of his continued prayers and best wishes, and with affectionate greetings to all the friends,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dear and valued co-workers:  The recent evidences of your marvellous activities in the service of our beloved Faith have brought infinite joy to my heart. The institutions you are so devotedly and laboriously erecting, multiplying and perfecting, notwithstanding your limited numbers, the scarcity of Bahá’í teachers and proper facilities, and despite your limited resources and the varied obstacles in your way, attest the splendid progress you have achieved "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],["title","Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#7)"],["body","augur well for the future of your historic work in His service. The summer-school is but one of those institutions which you have established with such a rare spirit of devotion, such magnificent loyalty and such assiduous care. The foundation you have laid is broad, solid and unassailable. The rising generation who will build upon it will extol your virtues, ennoble your task, preserve the record of your acts, and transmit to posterity the great tradition which you are now so happily and nobly establishing. My heart brims over with gratitude for all that you are achieving, and is filled with hopes for all that you will achieve in the near and distant future. Perseverance, fidelity, redoubled effort, will enable you to reap a rich harvest and to attain your shining goal.  Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi.      LETTER OF NOVEMBER 4TH, 1940   November 4th, 1940  Dear Miss Brooks,  Your communications dated April 22nd and August 23rd written on behalf of the N.S.A. of Australia and New-Zealand with the enclosed reports have all been safely received, and their contents noted with feelings of deepest satisfaction and gratitude by our beloved Guardian.  Also he has received the copy of the Mittagong Star, the reproduction of registration certificate, the three snaps and the three photographs which you had mailed under separate cover, for all of which he wishes you to heartily thank the N.S.A. on his behalf.  He wishes you, in particular, to convey his warmest greetings and congratulations to the members of the newly-elected N.S.A., whose names he has been very pleased to note, and to assure them of his prayers for their guidance and confirmation in the discharge of their heavy and sacred duties and responsibilites throughout this year. Despite the sorrow and distress created by the war, and the heavy sacrifices it is increasingly imposing upon the community of the faithful throughout Australia and New-Zealand, he confidently hopes that your Assembly, with the help and support of all the believers in that land, will continue prosecuting, with the same devoted zeal, resourcefulness and determination as before, its twofold task of extending the scope of the teaching work, and of further consolidating the foundations of the Administration. The unity and efficiency with which it has been functioning in the past year, as attested by the rich record of its accomplishments, indeed augur well for the future of its activities, and it is the Guardian’s fervent hope that, notwithstanding the delay and dislocation which the prosecution of the war has inevitably occasioned, it will continue to advance and prosper, and receive unforseen opportunities of spreading and of strengthening the foundations of the Cause throughout that far-off Continent.  In this time of world calamity his thoughts and prayers are often with our dearly-beloved friends in Australia and New Zealand, and he is ardently supplicating Bahá’u’lláh, on their behalf, that He may bestow upon them such measure of His guidance, protection and strength as would enable them to courageously and successfully meet the tests and trials of the days ahead.  Assuring you, in closing, of his special prayers on your own behalf, and reciprocating your greetings,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dear co-worker:  The report of your activities and of those of your fellow-workers, undertaken at such a time, and despite such difficulties and with such a courage, devotion, determination, thoroughness and fidelity, deserves indeed the highest praise and constitutes a powerful evidence of the unconquerable Spirit and the ever-extending range, and the ever-deepening influence of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. Your work is surely blessed by Him, and your fellow-labourers in distant lands derive great encouragement and inspiration from the incessant and remarkable efforts you are so devotedly exerting. Persevere and rest assured that I will, with increasing fervour, pray on your behalf at the Holy Shrines,  Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi.      LETTER OF JANUARY 3RD, 1941   January 3rd, 1941  Dear Miss Brooks,  At the Guardian’s direction I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of December 17th just arrived, together with the copy of the resolutions passed by the N.S.A. of Australia and New-Zealand in its August meeting, as well as the copy of the statement on the “Bahá’í Attitude to War” recently issued by your Assembly. He found that statement most satisfactory both in its form and in its clear and comprehensive presentation of the underlying principles governing the collective attitude of the believers in this vital issue of the hour.  The friends should indeed make a careful study of this statement, so as to be able to intelligently and correctly answer any questions put to them either by the authorities or individual inquirers.  The Guardian has been particularly pleased to note that the response of the Prime Minister, and of the premier of Victoria and other ministers to whom you had submitted a copy of the above statement has been so cordial, and he feels relieved to know that through this action of your Assembly any doubts or misapprehensions regading the attitude of the Bahá’ís to war have been dispelled, and that the authorities feel, as a result, much more favourable towards the Cause, now that they know for themselves that it is entirely non-political in character and that it enjoins absolute loyalty and obedience to the Government.  This opportunity your Assembly has had of establishing direct contact with the authorities is indeed a step of vital significance to the Cause in Australia and New-Zealand, and is bound to pave the way for its ultimate recognition as an independent religious Faith, entitled to the same rights and privileges which other religious bodies and institutions enjoy in that land.  The Guardian wishes me in closing to express his deepfelt appreciation of your teaching services in Melbourne and Hobart, in which cities you seem to have accomplished such splendid work, both in introducing the Cause to the general public and by assisting the friends in better conducting their teaching and administrative activities.  May the Beloved ever bless and guide your efforts, and may He also strengthen and confirm your fellow-members in the N.S.A. in the discharge of their arduous duties and responsibilities. To you and to them all he sends his warmest greetings,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dear co-workers:  The manner and spirit in which the dearly-beloved friends in Australia and New Zealand are discharging their multifarious and sacred responsibilities, in these days of strife and peril, augur well for the future of their mission in that far-off continent. The sound lines along which the administration of the Faith is evolving, the courage and fidelity with which they defend the integrity and assert the claims, and proclaim the verities of their beloved Cause are evidences of their onward march and the potentialities with which they are endowed. I rejoice and am thankful. I will continue to pray and seek for them still greater blessings.  Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi.      LETTER OF APRIL 19TH, 1941   Haifa, April 19th, 1941  Dear Bahá’í friends:  Shoghi Effendi has instructed me to answer your letter of March 16th, 1941.  He was very pleased to learn that Mother Dunn has accepted in such a noble and exemplary Bahá’í spirit the loss of dear Father Dunn, and that the friends of Sydney are preparing a full description of his death and the funeral. The Guardian would like very much to receive all such histories and reports for the next Vol. of “Bahá’í World”. He would also like you to send him three good photographs of Father Dunn and some of his grave and tombstone—whenever the latter are available.  The truly remarkable services of Hyde Dunn will never be forgotten. They have added a golden page to the history of the Formative Period of our Faith. The whole-hearted response to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s call, raised more than twenty years ago, which he and Mother Dunn made; their quiet and unassuming sacrifices for the Cause; the wisdom and permanence with which he laid the foundations of the work in Australia and New-Zealand; and the faithful love with which both of these noble souls tended the growing institutions of the Faith—all constitute a landmark in the victorious progress of the Faith. He is indeed the spiritual conqueror of that continent!  The Guardian was very impressed by your Assembly’s recent statement published in the January issue of “Bahá’í Quarterly”. So much so that he felt impelled to have the American N.S.A. publish it in “Bahá’í News” and also have it read at the annual Convention. He feels that in excellent form you have presented the very essence of the Bahá’í attitude on these matters. This has further strengthened his conviction that the Bahá’ís of Australia and New-Zealand display a remarkable soundness in their views on all matters concerning the Faith, a characteristic which greatly pleases him.  Concerning your question whether a Bahá’í Burial Service can be conducted for non-Bahá’ís if requested by them: if non-Bahá’ís desire that the believers should conduct such a service there is no objection at all.  The contemplated teaching trip of Miss Brooks, Mrs Hawthorne and Mrs Moffit to Queensland, meets with the Guardian’s whole-hearted approval. He will pray in the Holy Shrines that its outcome will be richly blessed and fruitful.  He was very sorry to learn that Miss Stevenson has passed on. He will pray for her joy and advancement in the Worlds beyond. She had the great honour and blessing of being the first New-Zealand believer and her reward must be great.  With the assurance of Shoghi Effendi’s most loving prayers for you all and with Bahá’í greetings,  Yours in His Service, R. Rabbani.  P.S. He wishes me also to thank you for the Naw-Rúz and Ridván"]]]
