By the addition of cream, in the proportion of a cup of whipped cream to a pint of dressing, those to whom oil has not become agreeable can so modify its \"tone\" that they too will enjoy the mayonnaise dressing.   =Boiled and Cream Dressings.=  For the French and mayonnaise dressings--particularly for the latter--we sometimes substitute a _boiled_ and sometimes a _cream_ dressing. In the first, butter, or cream, is substituted for oil, and the materials are combined by cooking. In the latter, as the name implies, cream is the basis, and this may be either sweet or sour.   =Important Points in Salad-Making.=  (1) The green vegetables should be served fresh and crisp.  (2) Meat and fish should be well marinated and cold.  (3) The ingredients composing the salad should not be combined until the last moment before serving.   =When to Serve Salads with French or Mayonnaise Dressing.=  As a rule, subject, however, to exceptions, light vegetable salads, dressed with French dressing, are served at dinner; while heavy meat or fish Salads are reserved for luncheon, or supper, and are served with mayonnaise or cream dressing.   =When to Serve a Fruit Salad.=  A fruit salad, with sweet dressing, is served with cake at a luncheon, or supper, or in the evening; that is, it may take the place of fruit in the dessert course. A fruit salad, with French or mayonnaise dressing, may be served as a first course at luncheon, or with the game or roast, though in the latter case the French dressing is preferable.   =Salads with Cheese.=  The rightful place of salads is with the roast or game. Here the crisp, green salad herbs, delicately acidulated, complement and correct the richness of these _plats_.  Occasionally when the game is omitted and an acid sauce accompanies the roast, a simple salad combined with cheese in some form, preferably cooked and hot, is selected to lengthen the menu. This same combination of hot cheese dish and salad should be a favorite one for home luncheons, when this meal is not made the children's dinner. The salad too in this combination, aided by the bread accompanying it, corrects by dilution the over concentration and richness of the cheese dish. In England neatly trimmed-and-cleansed celery stalks and cheese often precede the sweet course; but by virtue of its mission as a digester of everything but itself and of the common disinclination to have the taste of sweets linger upon the palate, the place of cheese as cheese is with the coffee.     HOW TO MAKE AROMATIC VINEGARS, TO KEEP VEGETABLES AND TO PREPARE GARNISHES.   =How to Boil Eggs Hard for Garnishing.=  Cover the eggs with boiling water. Set them on the back of the range, where the water will keep hot without boiling, about forty minutes. Cool in cold water, and with a thin, sharp knife cut as desired.   =To Poach Whites of Eggs.=  Turn the whites of the eggs into a well-buttered mould or cup, set upon a trivet in a dish of hot water, and cook until firm, either upon the back of the range or in the oven, and without letting the water boil. Turn from the mould, cut into slices, and then into fanciful shapes; or chop fine.   =Royal Custard for Moulds of Aspic.=  Beat together one whole egg and three yolks; add one-fourth a teaspoonful, each, of mace, salt and paprica, and, when well mixed, add half a cup of cream. Bake in a buttered mould, set in a pan of water, until firm. When cold cut in thin slices, then stamp out in fanciful shapes with French cutters. Use in decorating a mould for aspic jelly.   =How to Use Garlic or Onion in Salads.=  The salad-bowl may be rubbed with the cut surface of a clove of garlic, or a _chapon_ may be used. A _chapon_, according to gastronomic usage, is a thin piece of bread rubbed on all sides with the cut surface of a clove of garlic and put into the salad-bowl before the seasonings. It is tossed with the salad and dressings, to which it imparts its flavor. It may be divided and served with the salad. Oftentimes, instead of one piece, several small cubes of bread are thus used.  After a slice of onion has been removed, the cut surface of the onion may be pressed with a rotary motion against a grater and the juice extracted; or a lemon-squeezer kept for this special purpose may be used.   =How to Shell and Blanch Chestnuts.=  Score the shell of each nut, and put into a frying-pan with a teaspoonful of butter for each pint of nuts. Shake the pan over the fire until the butter is melted; then set in the oven five minutes. With a sharp knife remove the shells and skins together.   =How to Blanch Walnuts and Almonds.=  Put the nut meats over the fire in cold water, bring quickly to the boiling-point, drain, and rinse with cold water, then the skins may be easily rubbed from the almonds; a small pointed knife will be needed for the walnuts.   =How to Chop Fresh Herbs.=  Pluck the leaves close, discarding the stems; gather the leaves together closely with the fingers of the left hand, then with a sharp knife cut through close to the fingers; push the leaves out a little and cut again, and so continue until all are cut. Now gather into a mound and chop to a very fine powder, holding the point of the knife close to the board. Put the chopped herb into a cheese-cloth and hold under a stream of cold water, then wring dry. Use this green powder for dusting over a salad when required.   =How to Cut Radishes for a Garnish.=  Cut a thin slice from the leaf end of each; cut off the root end so as to leave it the length of the pistil of a flower. With a small, sharp knife score the pink skin, at the root end, into five or six sections extending half-way down the radish; then loosen the skin above these sections. Put the radishes in cold water for a little time, when they will become crisp, and the points will stand out like the petals of a flower.   =How to Clean Lettuce, Endive, Etc.=  A short time before serving cut off the roots and freshen the vegetable in cold water. Then break the leaves from the stalk; dip repeatedly into cold water, examining carefully, until perfectly clean, taking care not to crush the leaves. Put into a French wire basket made for the purpose, or into a piece of mosquito netting or cheese-cloth, and shake gently until the water is removed. Then spread on a plate or in a colander and set in a cool place until the moment for serving.   =How to Clean Cress.=  Pick over the stalks so as to remove grass, etc. Wash and dry in the same manner as the lettuce, but without removing the leaves from the stems, except when the stems are very coarse and large.   =How to Clean Cabbage and Cauliflower.=  Let stand head downwards half an hour in cold salted water, using a tablespoonful of salt to a quart of water.   =How to Render Uncooked Vegetables Crisp.=  Put into cold water with a bit of ice and a slice of lemon. When ready to use, dry between folds of cheese-cloth and let stand exposed to the air a few moments.   =How to Blanch and Cook Vegetables for Salads.=  Cut the vegetables as desired, in cubes, lozenges, balls, _juliennes_, etc. Put over the fire in boiling water, and, after cooking three or four minutes, drain, rinse in cold water, and put on to cook in boiling salted water to cover. Drain as soon as tender.   =How to Cut Gherkins for a Garnish.=  Select small cucumber pickles of uniform size. With a sharp knife cut them, lengthwise, into slices thin as paper, without detaching the slices at one end; then spread out the slices as a fan is spread.   =How to Fringe Celery.=  Cut the stalks into pieces about two inches in length. Beginning on the round side at one end, with a thin, sharp knife, cut down half an inch as many times as possible; then turn the stalk half-way around and cut in the opposite direction, thus dividing the end into shreds, or a fringe. If desired, cut the opposite end in the same manner. Set aside in a pan of ice water containing a slice of lemon.   =How to Shred Romaine and Straight Lettuce.=  Wash the lettuce leaves carefully, without removing them from the stalk; shake in the open air, and they will dry very quickly; fold in the middle, crosswise, and cut through in the fold. Hold the two pieces, one above the other, close to the meat-board with the left hand, and with a sharp knife cut in narrow ribbons not more than a quarter of an inch wide.   =How to Keep Celery, Watercress, Lettuce, Etc.=  Many green vegetables--celery in particular--discolor or rust, if allowed to stand longer than a few hours after being wet. When brought from the market they may be put aside, in a tightly closed pail, or in a paper bag, in a cool, dry place. By thus excluding the air they will keep fresh several days. A short time before serving put them into ice-cold water to which a slice or two of lemon has been added.   =How to Cook Sweetbreads and Brains.=  Remove the thin outer skin or membrane and soak in cold water, changing the water often, an hour or more. Cover with salted boiling water, acidulated with lemon juice and flavored with vegetables, and cook, just below the boiling-point, twenty minutes. They are then ready for preparation in any of the ways mentioned. Tie the brains in a cloth before cooking.   =How to Pickle Nasturtium Seeds.=  As the seeds are gathered wash and dry them; then put them into vinegar to which salt (half a teaspoonful to a pint) has been added. When a sufficient quantity has been collected, scald fresh vinegar, add salt as before, and the seeds from which the first vinegar has been drained. Pour scalding hot into bottles, having the seeds completely covered with vinegar.   =Nasturtium Vinegar.=  Fill a quart jar loosely with nasturtium blossoms fully blown; add a shallot and one-third a clove of garlic, both finely chopped, half a red pepper, and cold cider vinegar "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19077"],["title","Salads, Sandwiches and Chafing-Dish Dainties (#3)"],["body","fill the jar; cover closely and set aside two months. Dissolve a teaspoonful of salt in the vinegar, then strain and filter.   =Tarragon Vinegar.=  Fill a fruit jar with fresh tarragon leaves or shoots, putting them in loosely; add the thin _yellow_ paring of half a lemon with two or three cloves, and fill the jar with white wine or cider vinegar. Screw down the cover tightly, and allow the jar to stand in the sun two weeks; strain the vinegar through a cloth, pressing out the liquid from the leaves; then pass through filter paper, and bottle for future use. If a quantity be prepared, it were better to seal the bottles.   =Fines Herbes Vinegar.=  INGREDIENTS.            2 cups of tarragon vinegar.           2 tablespoonfuls of garden cress, chopped fine.           2 tablespoonfuls of sweet marjoram, chopped fine.           2 cloves of garlic, chopped fine.           4 small green capsicums, chopped fine.           2 shallots, chopped fine.  _Method._--Mix the ingredients in a pint fruit jar, cover closely, and set in the sun; after two weeks strain, pass through filter paper and store in tightly corked bottles.   =Fines Herbes Vinegar, No. 2.=  INGREDIENTS.            1 pint of tarragon vinegar.           2 tablespoonfuls of seeds of garden cress, bruised or crushed.           2 tablespoonfuls of celery seeds, crushed.           2 tablespoonfuls of parsley seeds, crushed.           4 capsicums, chopped fine.           2 cloves of garlic, chopped fine.  _Method._--Prepare as in preceding recipe.   =To Decorate Salads with Mayonnaise by Use of Pastry Bag and Tubes.=  Make the dressing very thick by the addition of oil, or use \"jelly mayonnaise.\" Put the dressing into a pastry bag with star tube attached; twist the large end of the bag with the left hand, pressing the mixture towards the tube, and with the right guide the tube as in writing, to produce the pattern desired. To form stars, hold the bag in an upright position, point downward, press out a little of the dressing, then push the tube down gently, and raise it quickly to break the flow.  [Illustration: \"The tender lettuce brings on softer sleep.\"--W. KING, _Art of Cookery_.]     SALAD DRESSINGS.     SALAD DRESSINGS.            \"Just, as in nature, thy proportions be,            As full of concord their variety.\"   =French Dressing.=  INGREDIENTS.            1/2 a teaspoonful of salt.           A few grains of cayenne or paprica.           1/4 a teaspoonful of pepper.           2 to 6 tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemon juice.           6 tablespoonfuls of oil.  If desired,--            1/2 a teaspoonful of prepared mustard.           1/2 a teaspoonful of onion juice, or rub the salad-bowl with               slice of onion, or clove of garlic.  _Method._--Mix the condiments, add the oil and mix again; then add the acid, a few drops at a time, and beat until an emulsion is formed; then pour over the vegetables, toss with the spoon and fork, and serve. In Chicago a method has obtained that is well worth a trial: Put a bit of ice into the bowl with the condiments, and, by means of a fork pressed against or into this, use in mixing.  _Second Method._--Pour the oil over the vegetables, toss, until the oil is evenly distributed, and dust with salt and pepper; then add the acid and toss again. When the salad is prepared at the table, the vegetables may be dressed in a bowl, then arranged on the serving-dish; or, if but one vegetable is used, it is preferable to serve from the dish in which it is dressed.   =To Mix a Quantity of Dressing.=  Put all the ingredients into a fruit jar, fit on one or more rubbers and the cover; then shake the jar vigorously, until a smooth dressing is formed.   =Claret Dressing.=  (_For lettuce or fruit salad._)  Mix half a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper, white or paprica, and four tablespoonfuls of oil; add gradually one tablespoonful of claret and one tablespoonful of lemon juice or vinegar.   =Mayonnaise Dressing.=  INGREDIENTS.            The yolks of 2 raw eggs.           1 pint of olive oil.           2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.           2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice.           1/2 a teaspoonful of salt.           A few grains of cayenne or paprica.  If desired,--            1 teaspoonful, each, of mustard and powdered sugar.  _Method._--An amateur will probably find it helpful to have all the utensils and ingredients thoroughly chilled, but the professional salad-maker thinks it expedient to have the ingredients and utensils of the same temperature as the room in which the dressing is to be served. Beat the yolks with a small wooden spoon or silver fork, add the condiments and mix again; then add one teaspoonful of vinegar, and, when well mixed with the other ingredients, add the oil, at first drop by drop. When the mixture has become of good consistency the oil may be added faster. When it is too thick to beat well, add a little of the lemon juice, then more oil, and so on alternately, until the ingredients are used. If a very heavy dressing is desired, as when it is to be put on with forcing-bag and tubes for a garnish, an additional half a cup of oil may be added without increasing the quantity of acid.  In preparing mayonnaise, there is absolutely no danger of curdling, if the eggs be fresh and the oil be added slowly, especially if the materials and utensils have been thoroughly chilled. If the yolks do not thicken when beaten with the condiments, but spread out over the bowl, you have sufficient indication that they will not thicken upon the addition of the oil, and it were better to select others and begin again. Take care to add the teaspoonful of acid to the yolks and condiments before beginning to drop in the oil, as this lessens the liability of the mixture to curdle.   =How to Make Mayonnaise in Quantity.=  If four quarts or more of dressing be required, make the full amount at one time; cut down the number of yolks to one for each pint of oil, but keep the usual proportions of the other ingredients. Use a Dover egg-beater from the start; after a little a teaspoonful of oil can be added instead of drops, and, very soon, a much larger quantity.   =Curdled Mayonnaise.=  Occasionally a mayonnaise will assume a curdled appearance; under such circumstances, often the addition of a very little of white of egg or a few drops of lemon juice, with thorough beating, will cause the sauce to resume its former smoothness. In case it does not become smooth, put the yolk of an egg into a cold bowl, beat well, and add to it the curdled mixture, a little at a time.   =Red Mayonnaise.=  Mix a level teaspoonful of Italian tomato pulp with a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing, and when well blended beat very thoroughly into a cup or more of the dressing, or add dressing until the desired tint is attained.   =Red Mayonnaise, No. 2.=  (_For fish._)  Pound dried lobster coral in a mortar, sift, and add gradually to the dressing, to secure the shade desired. Or, after the salad is arranged in the bowl, or in nests, mask the top with mayonnaise of the usual color, and sift the coral over the centre, leaving a ring of yellow around the edge.   =Sauce Tartare.=  Make a mayonnaise dressing, using tarragon vinegar. To each cup of dressing add one shallot, chopped fine, two tablespoonfuls, each, of finely chopped capers, olives and cucumber pickles, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and one-fourth a teaspoonful of powdered tarragon.   =Sardine Mayonnaise.=  Skin and bone three sardines and pound them to a pulp; sift the cooked yolks of three eggs and add to the pulp; work until smooth, then add to one cup of mayonnaise dressing.   =Jelly Mayonnaise.=  (_Used for masking cold fish or salads, or as a garnish with forcing-bag and tube._)  To a cup of mayonnaise dressing beat in gradually from two tablespoonfuls to one-third a cup of chilled but liquid aspic. More seasoning may be needed. Apply to a cold surface, or chill before using with forcing-bag.   =Livournaise Sauce.=  To a cup of mayonnaise dressing add a grating of nutmeg, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley and the pulp of eight anchovies.  To prepare the anchovies, wash, dry, remove skin and bones and pound to a pulp in a mortar.   =Boiled Dressing for Chicken Salad.=  INGREDIENTS.            1/2 a cup of chicken stock, well reduced.           1/2 a cup of vinegar.           1/4 a cup of mixed mustard.           1 teaspoonful of salt.           1/2 a teaspoonful of paprica.           Yolks of 5 eggs.           1/2 a cup of oil.           1/2 a cup of thick, sweet cream.  _Method._--Simmer the liquor in which a fowl has been cooked, until it is well reduced. Put the stock, vinegar and mustard into a double boiler, and add the salt and pepper. Beat the yolks of the eggs and add carefully to the hot mixture, cooking in the same manner as a boiled custard. When cold and ready to serve, beat in with a whisk the oil, and then fold in the cream, beaten stiff with a Dover egg-beater. Melted butter, added before the dressing is cold, may be substituted for the oil.   =Boiled Salad Dressing.=  INGREDIENTS.            1 teaspoonful of mustard.           1/2 a teaspoonful of salt.           1/4 a teaspoonful of paprica.           Yolks of 3 eggs.           4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.           2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.           1/2 a cup of thick cream.           2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice.  _Method._--Mix together the mustard, salt and paprica, and add the yolks of eggs; stir well and add slowly the butter, vinegar and lemon juice, and cook in the double boiler until thick as soft custard. When cool and ready to serve, add the cream, beaten stiff with the Dover egg-beater.   =Cream Salad Dressing.=  INGREDIENTS.            3/4 a cup of thick cream.           2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemon juice.           1/4 a teaspoonful of salt.           A dash of white pepper and paprica.  _Method._--Add the seasonings to the cream and beat with a Dover egg-beater until "]]]
