There was no challenge to the authority of NorCon. Public demand for faster and more powerful vehicles had forced the automotive industry to put more and more power under the touch of the ever-growing millions of drivers crowding the continent's roads. Piston drive gave way to turbojet; turbojet was boosted by a modification of ram jet and air-cushion drive was added. In the last two years, the first of the nuclear reaction mass engines had hit the roads. Even as the hot Ferraris and Jags of the mid-'60s would have been suicide vehicles on the T-model roads of the '20s so would today's vehicles be on the interstates of the '60s. But building roads capable of handling three hundred to four hundred miles an hour speeds was beyond the financial and engineering capabilities of individual states and nations. Thus grew the continental thruways with their four speed lanes in each direction, each a half-mile wide separated east and west and north and south by a half-mile-wide landscaped divider. Under the Three Nation Compact, the thruways now wove a net across the entire North American continent.  On the big wall map, NAT 26-west showed as four colored lines; blue and yellow as the two high and ultra-high speed lanes; green and white for the intermediate and slow lanes. Between the blue and yellow and the white and green was a red band. This was the police emergency lane, never used by other than official vehicles and crossed by the traveling public shifting from one speed lane to another only at sweeping crossovers.  The dispatcher picked up an electric pointer and aimed the light beam at the map. Referring to his notes, he began to recite.  \"Resurfacing crews working on 26-W blue at milestone Marker 185 to Marker 187, estimated clearance 0300 hours Tuesday--Let's see, that's tomorrow morning.\"  The two officers were writing the information down on their trip-analysis sheets.  \"Ohio State is playing Cal under the lights at Columbus tonight so you can expect a traffic surge sometime shortly after 2300 hours but most of it will stay in the green and white. Watch out for the drunks though. They might filter out onto the blue or yellow.  \"The crossover for NAT 163 has painting crews working. Might watch out for any crud on the roadway. And they've got the entrance blocked there so that all 163 exchange traffic is being rerouted to 164 west of Chillicothe.\"  The dispatcher thumbed through his reference sheets. \"That seems to be about all. No, wait a minute. This is on your trick. The Army's got a priority missile convoy moving out of the Aberdeen Proving Grounds bound for the west coast tonight at 1800 hours. It will be moving at green lane speeds so you might watch out for it. They'll have thirty-four units in the convoy. And that is all. Oh, yes. Kelly's already aboard. I guess you know about the weather.\"  Martin nodded. \"Yup. We should be hitting light snows by 2300 hours tonight in this area and it could be anything from snow to ice-rain after that.\" He grinned at his younger partner. \"The vacation is over, sonny. Tonight we make a man out of you.\"  Ferguson grinned back. \"Nuts to you, pop. I've got character witnesses back in Edmonton who'll give you glowing testimonials about my manhood.\"  \"Testimonials aren't legal unless they're given by adults,\" Martin retorted. \"Come on, lover boy. Duty calls.\"  Clay carefully embraced his armload of bundles and the two officers turned to leave. The dispatcher leaned across the counter.  \"Oh, Ferguson, one thing I forgot. There's some light corrugations in red lane just east of St. Louis. You might be careful with your souffles in that area. Wouldn't want them to fall, you know.\"  Clay paused and started to turn back. The grinning dispatcher ducked into the back office and slammed the door.         *       *       *       *       *  The wind had died down by the time the troopers entered the brilliantly lighted parking area. The temperature seemed warmer with the lessening winds but in actuality, the mercury was dropping. The snow clouds to the west were much nearer and the overcast was getting darker.  But under the great overhead light tubes, the parking area was brighter than day. A dozen huge patrol vehicles were parked on the front \"hot\" line. Scores more were lined out in ranks to the back of the parking zone. Martin and Ferguson walked down the line of military blue cars. Number 56 was fifth on the line. Service mechs were just re-housing fueling lines into a ground panel as the troopers walked up. The technician corporal was the first to speak. \"All set, Sarge,\" he said. \"We had to change an induction jet at the last minute and I had the port engine running up to reline the flow. Thought I'd better top 'er off for you, though, before you pull out. She sounds like a purring kitten.\"  He tossed the pair a waving salute and then moved out to his service dolly where three other mechs were waiting.  The officers paused and looked up at the bulk of the huge patrol car.  \"Beulah looks like she's been to the beauty shop and had the works,\" Martin said. He reached out and slapped the maglurium plates. \"Welcome home, sweetheart. I see you've kept a candle in the window for your wandering son.\" Ferguson looked up at the lighted cab, sixteen feet above the pavement.  Car 56--Beulah to her team--was a standard NorCon Patrol vehicle. She was sixty feet long, twelve feet wide and twelve feet high; topped by a four-foot-high bubble canopy over her cab. All the way across her nose was a three-foot-wide luminescent strip. This was the variable beam headlight that could cut a day-bright swath of light through night, fog, rain or snow and could be varied in intensity, width and elevation. Immediately above the headlight strip were two red-black plastic panels which when lighted, sent out a flashing red emergency signal that could be seen for miles. Similar emergency lights and back-up white light strips adorned Beulah's stern. Her bow rounded down like an old-time tank and blended into the track assembly of her dual propulsion system. With the exception of the cabin bubble and a two-foot stepdown on the last fifteen feet of her hull, Beulah was free of external protrusions. Racked into a flush-decked recess on one side of the hull was a crane arm with a two-hundred-ton lift capacity. Several round hatches covered other extensible gear and periscopes used in the scores of multiple operations the NorCon cars were called upon to accomplish on routine road patrols.  Beulah resembled a gigantic offspring of a military tank, sans heavy armament. But even a small stinger was part of the patrol car equipment. As for armament, Beulah had weapons to meet every conceivable skirmish in the deadly battle to keep Continental Thruways fast-moving and safe. Her own two-hundred-fifty-ton bulk could reach speeds of close to six hundred miles an hour utilizing one or both of her two independent propulsion systems.  At ultra-high speeds, Beulah never touched the ground--floating on an impeller air cushion and driven forward by a pair of one hundred fifty thousand pound thrust jets and ram jets. At intermediate high speeds, both her air cushion and the four-foot-wide tracks on each side of the car pushed her along at two hundred-mile-an-hour-plus speeds. Synchro mechanisms reduced the air cushion as the speeds dropped to afford more surface traction for the tracks. For slow speeds and heavy duty, the tracks carried the burden.  Martin thumbed open the portside ground-level cabin door.  \"I'll start the outside check,\" he told Clay. \"You stow that garbage of yours in the galley and start on the dispensary. I'll help you after I finish out here.\"  As the younger officer entered the car and headed up the short flight of steps to the working deck, the sergeant unclipped a check list from the inside of the door and turned towards the stern of the big vehicle.         *       *       *       *       *  Clay mounted to the work deck and turned back to the little galley just aft of the cab. As compact as a spaceship kitchen--as a matter of fact, designed almost identically from models on the Moon run--the galley had but three feet of open counter space. Everything else, sink, range, oven and freezer, were built-ins with pull-downs for use as needed. He set his bags on the small counter to put away after the pre-start check. Aft of the galley and on the same side of the passageway were the double-decked bunks for the patrol troopers. Across the passageway was a tiny latrine and shower. Clay tossed his helmet on the lower bunk as he went down the passageway. At the bulkhead to the rear, he pressed a wall panel and a thick, insulated door slid back to admit him to the engine compartment. The service crews had shut down the big power plants and turned off the air exchangers and already the heat from the massive engines made the compartment uncomfortably warm.  He hurried through into a small machine shop. In an emergency, the troopers could turn out small parts for disabled vehicles or for other uses. It also stocked a good supply of the most common failure parts. Racked against the ceiling were banks of cutting torches, a grim reminder that death or injury still rode the thruways with increasing frequency.  In the tank storage space between the ceiling and top of the hull were the chemical fire-fighting liquids and foam that could be applied by nozzles, hoses and towers now telescoped into recesses in the hull. Along both sides and beneath the galley, bunks, engine and machine-shop compartments between the walls, deck and hull, were Beulah's fuel storage tanks.  The last after compartment was a complete dispensary, one that would have made the emergency room or even the light surgery rooms of earlier-day hospitals proud.  Clay tapped on the door and went through. Medical-Surgical Officer Kelly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19111"],["title","Code Three (#2)"],["body","was sitting on the deck, stowing sterile bandage packs into a lower locker. She looked up at Clay and smiled. \"Well, well, you DID manage to tear yourself away from your adoring bevies,\" she said. She flicked back a wisp of golden-red hair from her forehead and stood up. The patrol-blue uniform coverall with its belted waist didn't do much to hide a lovely, properly curved figure. She walked over to the tall Canadian trooper and reached up and grabbed his ear. She pulled his head down, examined one side critically and then quickly snatched at his other ear and repeated the scrutiny. She let go of his ear and stepped back. \"Damned if you didn't get all the lipstick marks off, too.\"  Clay flushed. \"Cut it out, Kelly,\" he said. \"Sometimes you act just like my mother.\"  The olive-complexioned redhead grinned at him and turned back to her stack of boxes on the deck. She bent over and lifted one of the boxes to the operating table. Clay eyed her trim figure. \"You might act like ma sometimes,\" he said, \"but you sure don't look like her.\"  It was the Irish-Cherokee Indian girl's turn to flush. She became very busy with the contents of the box. \"Where's Ben?\" she asked over her shoulder.  \"Making outside check. You about finished in here?\"  Kelly turned and slowly scanned the confines of the dispensary. With the exception of the boxes on the table and floor, everything was behind secured locker doors. In one corner, the compact diagnostician--capable of analyzing many known human bodily ailments and every possible violent injury to the body--was locked in its riding clamps. Surgical trays and instrument racks were all hidden behind locker doors along with medical and surgical supplies. On either side of the emergency ramp door at the stern of the vehicle, three collapsible autolitters hung from clamps. Six hospital bunks in two tiers of three each, lined another wall. On patrol, Kelly utilized one of the hospital bunks for her own use except when they might all be occupied with accident or other kind of patients. And this would never be for more than a short period, just long enough to transfer them to a regular ambulance or hospital vehicle. Her meager supply of personal items needed for the ten-day patrol were stowed in a small locker and she shared the latrine with the male members of the team.  Kelly completed her scan, glanced down at the checklist in her hand. \"I'll have these boxes stowed in five minutes. Everything else is secure.\" She raised her hand to her forehead in mock salute. \"Medical-Surgical Officer Lightfoot reports dispensary ready for patrol, sir.\"  Clay smiled and made a checkmark on his clipboard. \"How was the seminar, Kelly?\" he asked.  Kelly hiked herself onto the edge of the operating table. \"Wonderful, Clay, just wonderful. I never saw so many good-looking, young, rich and eligible doctors together in one place in all my life.\"  She sighed and smiled vacantly into space.  Clay snorted. \"I thought you were supposed to be learning something new about tissue regeneration,\" he said.  \"Generation, regeneration, who cares,\" Kelly grinned.  Clay started to say something, got flustered and wheeled around to leave--and bounded right off Ben Martin's chest. Ferguson mumbled something and pushed past the older officer.  Ben looked after him and then turned back to Car 56's combination doctor, surgeon and nurse. \"Glad to see the hostess aboard for this cruise. I hope you make the passengers more comfortable than you've just made the first mate. What did you do to Clay, Kelly?\"  \"Hi, Ben,\" Kelly said. \"Oh, don't worry about junior. He just gets all fluttery when a girl takes away his masculine prerogative to make cleverly lewd witticisms. He'll be all right. Have a happy holiday, Ben? You look positively fat.\"  Ben patted his stomach. \"Carol's good cooking. Had a nice restful time. And how about you. That couldn't have been all work. You've got a marvelous tan.\"  \"Don't worry,\" Kelly laughed, \"I had no intention of letting it be all study. I spent just about as much time under the sun dome at the pool as I did in class. I learned a lot though.\"  [Illustration]  Ben grinned and headed back to the front of the car. \"Tell me more after we're on the road,\" he said from the doorway. \"We'll be rolling in ten minutes.\"  When he reached the cab, Clay was already in the right-hand control seat and was running down the instrument panel check. The sergeant lifted the hatch door between the two control seats and punched on a light to illuminate the stark compartment at the lower front end of the car. A steel grill with a dogged handle on the upper side covered the opening under the hatch cover. Two swing-down bunks were racked up against the walls on either side and the front hull door was without an inside handle. This was the patrol car brig, used for bringing in unwilling violators or other violent or criminal subjects who might crop up in the course of a patrol tour. Satisfied with the appearance of the brig, Ben closed the hatch cover and slid into his own control seat on the left of the cab. Both control seats were molded and plastiformed padded to the contours of the troopers and the armrests on both were studded with buttons and a series of small, finger-operated, knobs. All drive, communication and fire fighting controls for the massive vehicle were centered in the knobs and buttons on the seat arms, while acceleration and braking controls were duplicated in two footrest pedals beneath their feet.  Ben settled into his seat and glanced down to make sure his work-helmet was racked beside him. He reached over and flipped a bank of switches on the instrument panel. \"All communications to 'on,'\" he said. Clay made a checkmark on his list. \"All pre-engine start check complete,\" Clay replied.  \"In that case,\" the senior trooper said, \"let's give Beulah some exercise. Start engines.\"  Clay's fingers danced across the array of buttons on his seat arms and flicked lightly at the throttle knobs. From deep within the engine compartment came the muted, shrill whine of the starter engines, followed a split-second later by the full-throated roar of the jets as they caught fire. Clay eased the throttles back and the engine noise softened to a muffled roar.  Martin fingered a press-panel on the right arm of his seat.  \"Car 56 to Philly Control,\" Ben called.  The speakers mounted around the cab came to life. \"Go ahead Five Six.\"  \"Five Six fired up and ready to roll,\" Martin said.  \"Affirmative Five Six,\" came the reply, \"You're clear to roll. Philly Check estimates white density 300; green, 840; blue 400; yellow, 75.\"  Both troopers made mental note of the traffic densities in their first one-hundred-mile patrol segment; an estimated three hundred vehicles for each ten miles of thruway in the white or fifty to one hundred miles an hour low lane; eight hundred forty vehicles in the one hundred to one hundred fifty miles an hour green, and so on. More than sixteen thousand westbound vehicles on the thruway in the first one hundred miles; nearly five thousand of them traveling at speeds between one hundred fifty and three hundred miles an hour.  Over the always-hot intercom throughout the big car Ben called out. \"All set, Kelly?\"  \"I'm making coffee,\" Kelly answered from the galley. \"Let 'er roll.\"  Martin started to kick off the brakes, then stopped. \"Ooops,\" he exclaimed, \"almost forgot.\" His finger touched another button and a blaring horn reverberated through the vehicle.  In the galley, Kelly hurled herself into a corner. Her body activated a pressure plant and a pair of mummy-like plastifoam plates slid curvingly out the wall and locked her in a soft cocoon. A dozen similar safety clamps were located throughout the car at every working and relaxation station.  In the same instance, both Ben and Clay touched another plate on their control seats. From kiosk-type columns behind each seat, pairs of body-molded crash pads snapped into place to encase both troopers in their seats, their bodies cushioned and locked into place. Only their fingers were loose beneath the spongy substance to work arm controls. The half-molds included headforms with a padded band that locked across their foreheads to hold their heads rigidly against the backs of their reinforced seats. The instant all three crew members were locked into their safety gear, the bull horn ceased.  \"All tight,\" Ben called out as he wiggled and tried to free himself from the cocoon. Kelly and Clay tested their harnesses.  Satisfied that the safety cocoons were operating properly, Ben released them and the molds slid back into their recesses. The cocoons were triggered automatically in any emergency run or chase at speeds in excess of two hundred miles an hour.  Again he kicked off the brakes, pressed down on the foot feed and Car 56--Beulah--rolled out of the Philadelphia motor pool on the start of its ten-day patrol.         *       *       *       *       *  The motor pool exit opened into a quarter-mile wide tunnel sloping gently down into the bowels of the great city. Car 56 glided down the slight incline at a steady fifty miles an hour. A mile from the mouth of the tunnel the roadway leveled off and Ben kicked Beulah up another twenty-five miles an hour. Ahead, the main tunnel ended in a series of smaller portal ways, each emblazoned with a huge illuminated number designating a continental thruway.  Ben throttled back and began edging to the left lanes. Other patrol cars were heading down the main passageway, bound for their assigned thruways. As Ben eased down to a slow thirty, another patrol vehicle slid alongside. The two troopers in the cab waved. Clay flicked on the \"car-to-car\" transmit.  The senior trooper in Car 104 looked over at Martin and Ferguson. \"If it isn't the gruesome twosome,\" he called. \"Where have you two been? We thought the front office had finally caught up with you and found out that neither one of you could read or write and that they"]]]
