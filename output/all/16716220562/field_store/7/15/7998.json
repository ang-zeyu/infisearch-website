The middle basement had also been used, at least toward the end, for storage; it was cut in half by a partition pierced by but one door. They took half an hour to force this, and were on the point of sending above for heavy equipment when it yielded enough for them to squeeze through. Fitzgerald, in the lead with the light, stopped short, looked around, and then gave a groan that came through his helmet-speaker like a foghorn.  \"Oh, no! _No!_\"  \"What's the matter, Ivan?\" Sachiko, entering behind him, asked anxiously.  He stepped aside. \"Look at it, Sachi! Are we going to have to do all that?\"  Martha crowded through behind her friend and looked around, then stood motionless, dizzy with excitement. Books. Case on case of books, half an acre of cases, fifteen feet to the ceiling. Fitzgerald, and Penrose, who had pushed in behind her, were talking in rapid excitement; she only heard the sound of their voices, not their words. This must be the main stacks of the university library--the entire literature of the vanished race of Mars. In the center, down an aisle between the cases, she could see the hollow square of the librarians' desk, and stairs and a dumb-waiter to the floor above.  She realized that she was walking forward, with the others, toward this. Sachiko was saying: \"I'm the lightest; let me go first.\" She must be talking about the spidery metal stairs.  \"I'd say they were safe,\" Penrose answered. \"The trouble we've had with doors around here shows that the metal hasn't deteriorated.\"  In the end, the Japanese girl led the way, more catlike than ever in her caution. The stairs were quite sound, in spite of their fragile appearance, and they all followed her. The floor above was a duplicate of the room they had entered, and seemed to contain about as many books. Rather than waste time forcing the door here, they returned to the middle basement and came up by the escalator down which they had originally descended.  The upper basement contained kitchens--electric stoves, some with pots and pans still on them--and a big room that must have been, originally, the students' dining room, though when last used it had been a workshop. As they expected, the library reading room was on the street-level floor, directly above the stacks. It seemed to have been converted into a sort of common living room for the building's last occupants. An adjoining auditorium had been made into a chemical works; there were vats and distillation apparatus, and a metal fractionating tower that extended through a hole knocked in the ceiling seventy feet above. A good deal of plastic furniture of the sort they had been finding everywhere in the city was stacked about, some of it broken up, apparently for reprocessing. The other rooms on the street floor seemed also to have been devoted to manufacturing and repair work; a considerable industry, along a number of lines, must have been carried on here for a long time after the university had ceased to function as such.  On the second floor, they found a museum; many of the exhibits remained, tantalizingly half-visible in grimed glass cases. There had been administrative offices there, too. The doors of most of them were closed, and they did not waste time trying to force them, but those that were open had been turned into living quarters. They made notes, and rough floor plans, to guide them in future more thorough examination; it was almost noon before they had worked their way back to the seventh floor.  Selim von Ohlmhorst was in a room on the north side of the building, sketching the position of things before examining them and collecting them for removal. He had the floor checkerboarded with a grid of chalked lines, each numbered.  \"We have everything on this floor photographed,\" he said. \"I have three gangs--all the floodlights I have--sketching and making measurements. At the rate we're going, with time out for lunch, we'll be finished by the middle of the afternoon.\"  \"You've been working fast. Evidently you aren't being high-church about a 'qualified archaeologist' entering rooms first,\" Penrose commented.  \"Ach, childishness!\" the old man exclaimed impatiently. \"These officers of yours aren't fools. All of them have been to Intelligence School and Criminal Investigation School. Some of the most careful amateur archaeologists I ever knew were retired soldiers or policemen. But there isn't much work to be done. Most of the rooms are either empty or like this one--a few bits of furniture and broken trash and scraps of paper. Did you find anything down on the lower floors?\"  \"Well, yes,\" Penrose said, a hint of mirth in his voice. \"What would you say, Martha?\"  She started to tell Selim. The others, unable to restrain their excitement, broke in with interruptions. Von Ohlmhorst was staring in incredulous amazement.  \"But this floor was looted almost clean, and the buildings we've entered before were all looted from the street level up,\" he said, at length.  \"The people who looted this one lived here,\" Penrose replied. \"They had electric power to the last; we found refrigerators full of food, and stoves with the dinner still on them. They must have used the elevators to haul things down from the upper floor. The whole first floor was converted into workshops and laboratories. I think that this place must have been something like a monastery in the Dark Ages in Europe, or what such a monastery would have been like if the Dark Ages had followed the fall of a highly developed scientific civilization. For one thing, we found a lot of machine guns and light auto-cannon on the street level, and all the doors were barricaded. The people here were trying to keep a civilization running after the rest of the planet had gone back to barbarism; I suppose they'd have to fight off raids by the barbarians now and then.\"  \"You're not going to insist on making this building into expedition quarters, I hope, colonel?\" von Ohlmhorst asked anxiously.  \"Oh, no! This place is an archaeological treasure-house. More than that; from what I saw, our technicians can learn a lot, here. But you'd better get this floor cleaned up as soon as you can, though. I'll have the subsurface part, from the sixth floor down, airsealed. Then we'll put in oxygen generators and power units, and get a couple of elevators into service. For the floors above, we can use temporary airsealing floor by floor, and portable equipment; when we have things atmosphered and lighted and heated, you and Martha and Tony Lattimer can go to work systematically and in comfort, and I'll give you all the help I can spare from the other work. This is one of the biggest things we've found yet.\"  Tony Lattimer and his companions came down to the seventh floor a little later.  \"I don't get this, at all,\" he began, as soon as he joined them. \"This building wasn't stripped the way the others were. Always, the procedure seems to have been to strip from the bottom up, but they seem to have stripped the top floors first, here. All but the very top. I found out what that conical thing is, by the way. It's a wind-rotor, and under it there's an electric generator. This building generated its own power.\"  \"What sort of condition are the generators in?\" Penrose asked.  \"Well, everything's full of dust that blew in under the rotor, of course, but it looks to be in pretty good shape. Hey, I'll bet that's it! They had power, so they used the elevators to haul stuff down. That's just what they did. Some of the floors above here don't seem to have been touched, though.\" He paused momentarily; back of his oxy-mask, he seemed to be grinning. \"I don't know that I ought to mention this in front of Martha, but two floors above--we hit a room--it must have been the reference library for one of the departments--that had close to five hundred books in it.\"  The noise that interrupted him, like the squawking of a Brobdingnagian parrot, was only Ivan Fitzgerald laughing through his helmet-speaker.         *       *       *       *       *  Lunch at the huts was a hasty meal, with a gabble of full-mouthed and excited talking. Hubert Penrose and his chief subordinates snatched their food in a huddled consultation at one end of the table; in the afternoon, work was suspended on everything else and the fifty-odd men and women of the expedition concentrated their efforts on the University. By the middle of the afternoon, the seventh floor had been completely examined, photographed and sketched, and the murals in the square central hall covered with protective tarpaulins, and Laurent Gicquel and his airsealing crew had moved in and were at work. It had been decided to seal the central hall at the entrances. It took the French-Canadian engineer most of the afternoon to find all the ventilation-ducts and plug them. An elevator-shaft on the north side was found reaching clear to the twenty-fifth floor; this would give access to the top of the building; another shaft, from the center, would take care of the floors below. Nobody seemed willing to trust the ancient elevators, themselves; it was the next evening before a couple of cars and the necessary machinery could be fabricated in the machine shops aboard the ship and sent down by landing-rocket. By that time, the airsealing was finished, the nuclear-electric energy-converters were in place, and the oxygen generators set up.  [Illustration]  Martha was in the lower basement, an hour or so before lunch the day after, when a couple of Space Force officers came out of the elevator, bringing extra lights with them. She was still using oxygen-equipment; it was a moment before she realized that the newcomers had no masks, and that one of them was smoking. She took off her own helmet-speaker, throat-mike and mask and unslung her tank-pack, breathing cautiously. The air was chilly, and musty-acrid with the odor of antiquity--the first Martian odor she had smelled--but when she lit a cigarette,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19445"],["title","Omnilingual (#6)"],["body","lighter flamed clear and steady and the tobacco caught and burned evenly.  The archaeologists, many of the other civilian scientists, a few of the Space Force officers and the two news-correspondents, Sid Chamberlain and Gloria Standish, moved in that evening, setting up cots in vacant rooms. They installed electric stoves and a refrigerator in the old Library Reading Room, and put in a bar and lunch counter. For a few days, the place was full of noise and activity, then, gradually, the Space Force people and all but a few of the civilians returned to their own work. There was still the business of airsealing the more habitable of the buildings already explored, and fitting them up in readiness for the arrival, in a year and a half, of the five hundred members of the main expedition. There was work to be done enlarging the landing field for the ship's rocket craft, and building new chemical-fuel tanks.  There was the work of getting the city's ancient reservoirs cleared of silt before the next spring thaw brought more water down the underground aqueducts everybody called canals in mistranslation of Schiaparelli's Italian word, though this was proving considerably easier than anticipated. The ancient Canal-Builders must have anticipated a time when their descendants would no longer be capable of maintenance work, and had prepared against it. By the day after the University had been made completely habitable, the actual work there was being done by Selim, Tony Lattimer and herself, with half a dozen Space Force officers, mostly girls, and four or five civilians, helping.         *       *       *       *       *  They worked up from the bottom, dividing the floor-surfaces into numbered squares, measuring and listing and sketching and photographing. They packaged samples of organic matter and sent them up to the ship for Carbon-14 dating and analysis; they opened cans and jars and bottles, and found that everything fluid in them had evaporated, through the porosity of glass and metal and plastic if there were no other way. Wherever they looked, they found evidence of activity suddenly suspended and never resumed. A vise with a bar of metal in it, half cut through and the hacksaw beside it. Pots and pans with hardened remains of food in them; a leathery cut of meat on a table, with the knife ready at hand. Toilet articles on washstands; unmade beds, the bedding ready to crumble at a touch but still retaining the impress of the sleeper's body; papers and writing materials on desks, as though the writer had gotten up, meaning to return and finish in a fifty-thousand-year-ago moment.  It worried her. Irrationally, she began to feel that the Martians had never left this place; that they were still around her, watching disapprovingly every time she picked up something they had laid down. They haunted her dreams, now, instead of their enigmatic writing. At first, everybody who had moved into the University had taken a separate room, happy to escape the crowding and lack of privacy of the huts. After a few nights, she was glad when Gloria Standish moved in with her, and accepted the newswoman's excuse that she felt lonely without somebody to talk to before falling asleep. Sachiko Koremitsu joined them the next evening, and before going to bed, the girl officer cleaned and oiled her pistol, remarking that she was afraid some rust may have gotten into it.  The others felt it, too. Selim von Ohlmhorst developed the habit of turning quickly and looking behind him, as though trying to surprise somebody or something that was stalking him. Tony Lattimer, having a drink at the bar that had been improvised from the librarian's desk in the Reading Room, set down his glass and swore.  \"You know what this place is? It's an archaeological _Marie Celeste_!\" he declared. \"It was occupied right up to the end--we've all seen the shifts these people used to keep a civilization going here--but what was the end? What happened to them? Where did they go?\"  \"You didn't expect them to be waiting out front, with a red carpet and a big banner, _Welcome Terrans_, did you, Tony?\" Gloria Standish asked.  \"No, of course not; they've all been dead for fifty thousand years. But if they were the last of the Martians, why haven't we found their bones, at least? Who buried them, after they were dead?\" He looked at the glass, a bubble-thin goblet, found, with hundreds of others like it, in a closet above, as though debating with himself whether to have another drink. Then he voted in the affirmative and reached for the cocktail pitcher. \"And every door on the old ground level is either barred or barricaded from the inside. How did they get out? And why did they leave?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The next day, at lunch, Sachiko Koremitsu had the answer to the second question. Four or five electrical engineers had come down by rocket from the ship, and she had been spending the morning with them, in oxy-masks, at the top of the building.  \"Tony, I thought you said those generators were in good shape,\" she began, catching sight of Lattimer. \"They aren't. They're in the most unholy mess I ever saw. What happened, up there, was that the supports of the wind-rotor gave way, and weight snapped the main shaft, and smashed everything under it.\"  \"Well, after fifty thousand years, you can expect something like that,\" Lattimer retorted. \"When an archaeologist says something's in good shape, he doesn't necessarily mean it'll start as soon as you shove a switch in.\"  \"You didn't notice that it happened when the power was on, did you,\" one of the engineers asked, nettled at Lattimer's tone. \"Well, it was. Everything's burned out or shorted or fused together; I saw one busbar eight inches across melted clean in two. It's a pity we didn't find things in good shape, even archaeologically speaking. I saw a lot of interesting things, things in advance of what we're using now. But it'll take a couple of years to get everything sorted out and figure what it looked like originally.\"  \"Did it look as though anybody'd made any attempt to fix it?\" Martha asked.  Sachiko shook her head. \"They must have taken one look at it and given up. I don't believe there would have been any possible way to repair anything.\"  \"Well, that explains why they left. They needed electricity for lighting, and heating, and all their industrial equipment was electrical. They had a good life, here, with power; without it, this place wouldn't have been habitable.\"  \"Then why did they barricade everything from the inside, and how did they get out?\" Lattimer wanted to know.  \"To keep other people from breaking in and looting. Last man out probably barred the last door and slid down a rope from upstairs,\" von Ohlmhorst suggested. \"This Houdini-trick doesn't worry me too much. We'll find out eventually.\"  \"Yes, about the time Martha starts reading Martian,\" Lattimer scoffed.  \"That may be just when we'll find out,\" von Ohlmhorst replied seriously. \"It wouldn't surprise me if they left something in writing when they evacuated this place.\"  \"Are you really beginning to treat this pipe dream of hers as a serious possibility, Selim?\" Lattimer demanded. \"I know, it would be a wonderful thing, but wonderful things don't happen just because they're wonderful. Only because they're possible, and this isn't. Let me quote that distinguished Hittitologist, Johannes Friedrich: 'Nothing can be translated out of nothing.' Or that later but not less distinguished Hittitologist, Selim von Ohlmhorst: 'Where are you going to get your bilingual?'\"  \"Friedrich lived to see the Hittite language deciphered and read,\" von Ohlmhorst reminded him.  \"Yes, when they found Hittite-Assyrian bilinguals.\" Lattimer measured a spoonful of coffee-powder into his cup and added hot water. \"Martha, you ought to know, better than anybody, how little chance you have. You've been working for years in the Indus Valley; how many words of Harappa have you or anybody else ever been able to read?\"  \"We never found a university, with a half-million-volume library, at Harappa or Mohenjo-Daro.\"  \"And, the first day we entered this building, we established meanings for several words,\" Selim von Ohlmhorst added.  \"And you've never found another meaningful word since,\" Lattimer added. \"And you're only sure of general meaning, not specific meaning of word-elements, and you have a dozen different interpretations for each word.\"  \"We made a start,\" von Ohlmhorst maintained. \"We have Grotefend's word for 'king.' But I'm going to be able to read some of those books, over there, if it takes me the rest of my life here. It probably will, anyhow.\"  \"You mean you've changed your mind about going home on the _Cyrano_?\" Martha asked. \"You'll stay on here?\"  The old man nodded. \"I can't leave this. There's too much to discover. The old dog will have to learn a lot of new tricks, but this is where my work will be, from now on.\"  Lattimer was shocked. \"You're nuts!\" he cried. \"You mean you're going to throw away everything you've accomplished in Hittitology and start all over again here on Mars? Martha, if you've talked him into this crazy decision, you're a criminal!\"  \"Nobody talked me into anything,\" von Ohlmhorst said roughly. \"And as for throwing away what I've accomplished in Hittitology, I don't know what the devil you're talking about. Everything I know about the Hittite Empire is published and available to anybody. Hittitology's like Egyptology; it's stopped being research and archaeology and become scholarship and history. And I'm not a scholar or a historian; I'm a pick-and-shovel field archaeologist--a highly skilled and specialized grave-robber and junk-picker--and there's more pick-and-shovel work on this planet than I could do in a hundred lifetimes. This is something new; I was a fool to think I could turn my back on it and go back to scribbling footnotes about Hittite kings.\"  \"You could have anything you wanted, in Hittitology. There"]]]
