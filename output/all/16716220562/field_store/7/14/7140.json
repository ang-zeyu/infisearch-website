Bot. 2: 184. pl. 5. f. 1. 1788.  Thallus smooth or somewhat rough, more or less chinky or becoming obscurely small-areolate, ash- to green-gray, or becoming olivaceous, spreading over the substratum as a continuous, moderately thick crust; apothecia small to large, 0.5 to 1.5 mm. in diameter, adnate or more or less immersed, usually flat, almost always white or rusty-green pruinose, the black exciple rarely becoming covered; hypothecium brown to black-brown; hymenium commonly pale; paraphyses distinct, but usually coherent; asci clavate to inflated-clavate; spores ovoid-ellipsoid, 15 to 24 mic. long and 7 to 10 mic. wide.
