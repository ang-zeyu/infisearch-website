CLEVER GRETHEL   THERE was once a cook called Grethel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she went out in them she gave herself great airs, and thought herself very fine indeed. When she came home again, she would take a drink of wine to refresh herself, and as that gave her an appetite, she would take some of the best of whatever she was cooking, until she had had enough;--\"for,\" said she, \"a cook must know how things taste.\"  Now it happened that one day her master said to her,--  \"Grethel, I expect a guest this evening; you must make ready a pair of fowls.\"  \"Certainly, sir, I will,\" answered Grethel. So she killed the fowls, cleaned them, and plucked them, and put them on the spit, and then, as evening drew near, placed them before the fire to roast. And they began to be brown, and were nearly done, but the guest had not come.  \"If he does not make haste,\" cried Grethel to her master, \"I must take them away from the fire; it's a pity and a shame not to eat them now, just when they are done to a turn.\" And the master said he would run himself and fetch the guest. As soon as he had turned his back, Grethel took the fowls from before the fire.  \"Standing so long before the fire,\" said she, \"makes one hot and thirsty,--and who knows when they will come! in the meanwhile I will go to the cellar and have a drink.\" So down she ran, took up a mug, and saying, \"Here's to me!\" took a good draught. \"One good drink deserves another,\" she said \"and it should not be cut short;\" so she took another hearty draught. Then she went and put the fowls down to the fire again, and, basting them with butter, she turned the spit briskly round. And now they began to smell so good that Grethel saying, \"I must find out whether they really are all right,\" licked her fingers, and then cried, \"Well, I never! the fowls are good; it's a sin and a shame that no one is here to eat them!\"  So she ran to the window to see if her master and his guest were coming, but as she could see nobody she went back to her fowls. \"Why, one of the wings is burning!\" she cried presently, \"I had better eat it and get it out of the way.\" So she cut it off and ate it up, and it tasted good, and then she thought,  \"I had better cut off the other too, in case the master should miss anything.\" And when both wings had been disposed of she went and looked for the master, but still he did not come.  \"Who knows,\" said she, \"whether they are coming or not? they may have put up at an inn.\" And after a pause she said again, \"Come, I may as well make myself happy, and first I will make sure of a good drink and then of a good meal, and when all is done I shall be easy; the gifts of the gods are not to be despised.\" So first she ran down into the cellar and had a famous drink, and ate up one of the fowls with great relish. And when that was done, and still the master did not come, Grethel eyed the other fowl, saying, \"What one is the other must be, the two belong to each other, it is only fair that they should be both treated alike; perhaps, when I have had another drink, I shall be able to manage it.\" So she took another hearty drink, and then the second fowl went the way of the first.  Just as she was in the middle of it the master came back. \"Make haste, Grethel,\" cried he, \"the guest is coming directly!\" \"Very well, master,\" she answered, \"it will soon be ready.\" The master went to see that the table was properly laid, and, taking the great carving knife with which he meant to carve the fowls, he sharpened it upon the step. Presently came the guest, knocking very genteelly and softly at the front door. Grethel ran and looked to see who it was, and when she caught sight of the guest she put her finger on her lip saying, \"Hush! make the best haste you can out of this, for if my master catches you, it will be bad for you; he asked you to come to supper, but he really means to cut off your ears! Just listen how he is sharpening his knife!\"  The guest, hearing the noise of the sharpening, made off as fast as he could go. And Grethel ran screaming to her master. \"A pretty guest you have asked to the house!\" cried she.  \"How so, Grethel? what do you mean?\" asked he.  \"What indeed!\" said she; \"why, he has gone and run away with my pair of fowls that I had just dished up.\"  \"That's pretty sort of conduct!\" said the master, feeling very sorry about the fowls; \"he might at least have left me one, that I might have had something to eat.\" And he called out to him to stop, but the guest made as if he did not hear him; then he ran after him, the knife still in his hand, crying out, \"Only one! only one!\" meaning that the guest should let him have one of the fowls and not take both, but the guest thought he meant to have only one of his ears, and he ran so much the faster that he might get home with both of them safe.     The DEATH of the HEN   ONCE on a time the cock and the hen went to the nut mountain, and they agreed beforehand that whichever of them should find a nut was to divide it with the other. Now the hen found a great big nut, but said nothing about it, and was going to eat it all alone, but the kernel was such a fat one that she could not swallow it down, and it stuck in her throat, so that she was afraid she should choke.  \"Cock!\" cried she, \"run as fast as you can and fetch me some water, or I shall choke!\"  So the cock ran as fast as he could to the brook, and said, \"Brook, give me some water, the hen is up yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat.\" But the brook answered, \"First run to the bride and ask her for some red silk.\"  So the cock ran to the bride and said,  \"Bride, give me some red silk; the brook wants me to give him some red silk; I want him to give me some water, for the hen lies yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat.\"  But the bride answered,  \"First go and fetch me my garland that hangs on a willow.\" And the cock ran to the willow and pulled the garland from the bough and brought it to the bride, and the bride gave him red silk, and he brought it to the brook, and the brook gave him water. So then the cock brought the water to the hen, but alas, it was too late; the hen had choked in the meanwhile, and lay there dead. And the cock was so grieved that he cried aloud, and all the beasts came and lamented for the hen; and six mice built a little waggon, on which to carry the poor hen to her grave, and when it was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock drove. On the way they met the fox.  \"Halloa, cock,\" cried he, \"where are you off to?\"  \"To bury my hen,\" answered the cock.  \"Can I come too?\" said the fox.  \"Yes, if you follow behind,\" said the cock.  So the fox followed behind and he was soon joined by the wolf, the bear, the stag, the lion, and all the beasts in the wood. And the procession went on till they came to a brook.  \"How shall we get over?\" said the cock. Now in the brook there was a straw, and he said,  \"I will lay myself across, so that you may pass over on me.\" But when the six mice had got upon this bridge, the straw slipped and fell into the water and they all tumbled in and were drowned. So they were as badly off as ever, when a coal came up and said he would lay himself across and they might pass over him; but no sooner had he touched the water than he hissed, went out, and was dead. A stone seeing this was touched with pity, and, wishing to help the cock, he laid himself across the stream. And the cock drew the waggon with the dead hen in it safely to the other side, and then began to draw the others who followed behind across too, but it was too much for him, the waggon turned over, and all tumbled into the water one on the top of another, and were drowned.  So the cock was left all alone with the dead hen, and he digged a grave and laid her in it, and he raised a mound above her, and sat himself down and lamented so sore that at last he died. And so they were all dead together.     HANS IN LUCK   HANS had served his master seven years, and at the end of the seventh year he said,  \"Master, my time is up; I want to go home and see my mother, so give me my wages.\"  \"You have served me truly and faithfully,\" said the master; \"as the service is, so must the wages be,\" and he gave him a lump of gold as big as his head. Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket and tied up the lump of gold in it, hoisted it on his shoulder, and set off on his way home. And as he was trudging along, there came in sight a man riding on a spirited horse, and looking very gay and lively. \"Oh!\" cried Hans aloud, \"how splendid riding must be! sitting as much at one's ease as in an arm-chair, stumbling over no stones, saving one's shoes, and getting on one hardly knows how!\"  The horseman heard Hans say this, and called out to him,  \"Well Hans, what are you doing on foot?\"  \"I can't help myself,\" said Hans, \"I have this great lump to carry; to be sure, it is gold, but then I can't hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder.\"  \"I'll tell you what,\" said the horseman, \"we will change; I will give you my horse, and you shall give me your lump of gold.\"  \"With all my heart,\" said Hans; \"but I warn you, you will find it heavy.\" And the horseman got down, took the gold, and, helping Hans up, he gave the reins into his hand.  \"When you want to go fast,\" said he, \"you must click your tongue and cry 'Gee-up!'\"  And Hans, as he sat upon his horse, was glad at heart, and rode off with merry cheer. After a while he thought he should like to go quicker, so he began to click with his tongue and to cry \"Gee-up!\" And the horse began to trot, and Hans was thrown before he knew what was going to happen, and there he lay in the ditch by the side of the road. The horse would have got away but that he was caught by a peasant who was passing that way and driving a cow before him. And Hans pulled himself together and got"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],["title","Household Stories (#3)"],["body","his feet, feeling very vexed. \"Poor work, riding,\" said he, \"especially on a jade like this, who starts off and throws you before you know where you are, going near to break your neck; never shall I try that game again; now, your cow is something worth having, one can jog on comfortably after her and have her milk, butter, and cheese every day, into the bargain. What would I not give to have such a cow!\"  \"Well now,\" said the peasant, \"since it will be doing you such a favour, I don't mind exchanging my cow for your horse.\"  Hans agreed most joyfully, and the peasant, swinging himself into the saddle, was soon out of sight.  And Hans went along driving his cow quietly before him, and thinking all the while of the fine bargain he had made.  \"With only a piece of bread I shall have everything I can possibly want, for I shall always be able to have butter and cheese to it, and if I am thirsty I have nothing to do but to milk my cow; and what more is there for heart to wish!\"  And when he came to an inn he made a halt, and in the joy of his heart ate up all the food he had brought with him, dinner and supper and all, and bought half a glass of beer with his last two farthings. Then on he went again driving his cow, until he should come to the village where his mother lived. It was now near the middle of the day, and the sun grew hotter and hotter, and Hans found himself on a heath which it would be an hour's journey to cross. And he began to feel very hot, and so thirsty that his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth.  \"Never mind,\" said Hans; \"I can find a remedy. I will milk my cow at once.\" And tying her to a dry tree, and taking off his leather cap to serve for a pail, he began to milk, but not a drop came. And as he set to work rather awkwardly, the impatient beast gave him such a kick on the head with his hind foot that he fell to the ground, and for some time could not think where he was; when luckily there came by a butcher who was wheeling along a young pig in a wheelbarrow.  \"Here's a fine piece of work!\" cried he, helping poor Hans on his legs again. Then Hans related to him all that had happened; and the butcher handed him his pocket-flask, saying,  \"Here, take a drink, and be a man again; of course the cow would give no milk; she is old and only fit to draw burdens, or to be slaughtered.\"  \"Well, to be sure,\" said Hans, scratching his head. \"Who would have thought it? of course it is a very handy way of getting meat when a man has a beast of his own to kill; but for my part I do not care much about cow beef, it is rather tasteless. Now, if I had but a young pig, that is much better meat, and then the sausages!\"  \"Look here, Hans,\" said the butcher, \"just for love of you I will exchange, and will give you my pig instead of your cow.\"  \"Heaven reward such kindness!\" cried Hans, and handing over the cow, received in exchange the pig, who was turned out of his wheelbarrow and was to be led by a string.  So on went Hans, thinking how everything turned out according to his wishes, and how, if trouble overtook him, all was sure to be set right directly. After a while he fell in with a peasant, who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm. They bid each other good-day, and Hans began to tell about his luck, and how he had made so many good exchanges. And the peasant told how he was taking the goose to a christening feast.  \"Just feel how heavy it is,\" said he, taking it up by the wings; \"it has been fattening for the last eight weeks; and when it is roasted, won't the fat run down!\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Hans, weighing it in his hand, \"very fine to be sure; but my pig is not to be despised.\"  Upon which the peasant glanced cautiously on all sides, and shook his head.  \"I am afraid,\" said he, \"that there is something not quite right about your pig. In the village I have just left one had actually been stolen from the bailiff's yard. I fear, I fear you have it in your hand; they have sent after the thief, and it would be a bad look-out for you if it was found upon you; the least that could happen would be to be thrown into a dark hole.\"  Poor Hans grew pale with fright. \"For heaven's sake,\" said he, \"help me out of this scrape, I am a stranger in these parts; take my pig and give me your goose.\"  \"It will be running some risk,\" answered the man, \"but I will do it sooner than that you should come to grief.\" And so, taking the cord in his hand, he drove the pig quickly along a by-path, and lucky Hans went on his way home with the goose under his arm. \"The more I think of it,\" said he to himself, \"the better the bargain seems; first I get the roast goose; then the fat; that will last a whole year for bread and dripping; and lastly the beautiful white feathers which I can stuff my pillow with; how comfortably I shall sleep upon it, and how pleased my mother will be!\"  And when he reached the last village, he saw a knife-grinder with his barrow; and his wheel went whirring round, and he sang,      \"My scissors I grind, and my wheel I turn;     And all good fellows my trade should learn,     For all that I meet with just serves my turn.\"  And Hans stood and looked at him; and at last he spoke to him and said,  \"You seem very well off, and merry with your grinding.\"  \"Yes,\" answered the knife-grinder, \"my handiwork pays very well. I call a man a good grinder who, every time he puts his hand in his pocket finds money there. But where did you buy that fine goose?\"  \"I did not buy it, but I exchanged it for my pig,\" said Hans.  \"And the pig?\"  \"That I exchanged for a cow.\"  \"And the cow?\"  \"That I exchanged for a horse.\"  \"And the horse?\"  \"I gave for the horse a lump of gold as big as my head.\"  \"And the gold?\"  \"Oh, that was my wage for seven years' service.\"  \"You seem to have fended for yourself very well,\" said the knife-grinder. \"Now, if you could but manage to have money in your pocket every time you put your hand in, your fortune is made.\"  \"How shall I manage that?\" said Hans.  \"You must be a knife-grinder like me,\" said the man. \"All you want is a grindstone, the rest comes of itself: I have one here; to be sure it is a little damaged, but I don't mind letting you have it in exchange for your goose; what say you?\"  \"How can you ask?\" answered Hans. \"I shall be the luckiest fellow in the world, for if I find money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, there is nothing more left to want.\"  And so he handed over the goose to the pedlar and received the grindstone in exchange.  \"Now,\" said the knife-grinder, taking up a heavy common stone that lay near him, \"here is another proper sort of stone that will stand a good deal of wear and that you can hammer out your old nails upon. Take it with you, and carry it carefully.\"  Hans lifted up the stone and carried it off with a contented mind. \"I must have been born under a lucky star!\" cried he, while his eyes sparkled for joy. \"I have only to wish for a thing and it is mine.\"  After a while he began to feel rather tired, as indeed he had been on his legs since daybreak; he also began to feel rather hungry, as in the fulness of his joy at getting the cow, he had eaten up all he had. At last he could scarcely go on at all, and had to make a halt every moment, for the stones weighed him down most unmercifully, and he could not help wishing that he did not feel obliged to drag them along. And on he went at a snail's pace until he came to a well; then he thought he would rest and take a drink of the fresh water. And he placed the stones carefully by his side at the edge of the well; then he sat down, and as he stooped to drink, he happened to give the stones a little push, and they both fell into the water with a splash. And then Hans, having watched them disappear, jumped for joy, and thanked his stars that he had been so lucky as to get rid of the stones that had weighed upon him so long without any effort of his own.  \"I really think,\" cried he, \"I am the luckiest man under the sun.\" So on he went, void of care, until he reached his mother's house.     THE GOOSE GIRL.   THERE lived once an old Queen, whose husband had been dead many years. She had a beautiful daughter who was promised in marriage to a King's son living a great way off. When the time appointed for the wedding drew near, and the old Queen had to send her daughter into the foreign land, she got together many costly things, furniture and cups and jewels and adornments, both of gold and silver, everything proper for the dowry of a royal Princess, for she loved her daughter dearly. She gave her also a waiting gentlewoman to attend her and to give her into the bridegroom's hands; and they were each to have a horse for the journey, and the Princess's horse was named Falada, and he could speak. When the time for parting came, the old Queen took her daughter to her chamber, and with a little knife she cut her own finger so that it bled; and she held beneath it a white napkin, and on it fell three drops of blood; and she gave it to her daughter, bidding her take care of it, for it would be needful to her on the way. Then they took leave of each other; and the Princess put the napkin in her bosom, got on her horse, and set out to go to the bridegroom. After she had ridden an hour, she began to feel very thirsty, and she said to the waiting-woman,  \"Get down, and fill my cup that you are carrying with water from the brook; I have great desire to drink.\"  \"Get down yourself,\" said the waiting-woman, \"and if you are thirsty stoop down and drink; I will not be your slave.\"  [Illustration: GOOSE GIRL      'O WIND, BLOW CONRAD'S HAT AWAY,     AND MAKE HIM FOLLOW AS IT FLIES,     WHILE I WITH MY GOLD HAIR WILL PLAY     AND BIND IT UP IN SEEMLY WISE.' ]  And as her thirst was so great, the Princess had to get down and to stoop and drink of the water of the brook, and could not have her gold cup to serve her. \"Oh dear!\" said the poor Princess. And the three drops of blood heard her, and said,  \"If your mother knew of"]]]
