[FROM A FAIRY TO A CHILD.]       Lady dear, if Fairies may       For a moment lay aside     Cunning tricks and elfish play,       'Tis at happy Christmas-tide.      We have heard the children say--       Gentle children, whom we love--     Long ago, on Christmas Day,       Came a message from above.      Still, as Christmas-tide comes round,       They remember it again--     Echo still the joyful sound       \"Peace on earth, good-will to men!\"      Yet the hearts must childlike be       Where such heavenly guests abide:     Unto children, in their glee,       All the year is Christmas-tide!      Thus, forgetting tricks and play       For a moment, Lady dear,     We would wish you, if we may,       Merry Christmas, glad New Year!

LONDON  _First Issued in this Cheap Form in 1919_  _This Book was First Published (Crown 8vo) February 16th, 1911_     +-------------------------------------------------------------+ |Transcribers Note: In this book superscript is represented by| |the carat \"^\"                                                | +-------------------------------------------------------------+     PREFACE   The aim of the present volume is to deal with Old English Customs, not so much in their picturesque aspect--though that element is not wholly wanting--as in their fundamental relations to the organized life of the Middle Ages. Partly for that reason and partly because the work is comparatively small, it embraces only such usages as are of national (and, in some cases, international) significance. The writer is much too modest to put it forth as a scientific exposition of the basic principles of mediæval civilization. He is well aware that a book designed on this unassuming scale must be more or less eclectic. He is conscious of manifold gaps--_valde deflenda_. And yet, despite omissions, it is hoped that the reader may rise from its perusal with somewhat clearer conceptions of the world as it appeared to the average educated Englishman of the Middle Ages. This suggests the remark that the reader specially in view is the average educated Englishman of the twentieth century, who has not perhaps forgotten his Latin, for Latin has a way of sticking, while Greek, unless cherished, drops away from a man.  The materials of which the work is composed have been culled from a great variety of sources, and the writer almost despairs of making adequate acknowledgments. For years past admirable articles cognate to the study of mediæval relationships have been published from time to time in learned periodicals like \"Archæologia,\" the \"Archæological Journal,\" the \"Antiquary,\" etc., where, being sandwiched between others of another character, they have been lost to all but antiquarian experts of omnivorous appetite. Assuredly, the average educated Englishman will not go in quest of them, but it may be thought he will esteem the opportunity, here offered, of gaining enlightenment, if not in the full and perfect sense which might have been possible, had life been less brief and art not quite so long. The same observation applies to books, with this difference that, whereas in articles information is usually compacted, in some books at least it has to be picked out from amidst a mass of irrelevant particulars without any help from indices. If the writer has at all succeeded in performing his office--which is to do for the reader what, under other circumstances, he might have done for himself--many weary hours will not have been spent in vain, and the weariest are probably those devoted to the construction of an index, with which this book, whatever its merits or defects, does not go unprovided.  Mere general statements, however, will not suffice; there is the personal side to be thought of. The great \"Chronicles and Memorials\" series has been served by many competent editors, but by none more competent than Messrs. Riley, Horwood, and Anstey, to whose introductions and texts the writer is deeply indebted. Reeves' \"History of"]]]
