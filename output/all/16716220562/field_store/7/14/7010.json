No paper was allowed and only three matches.  What a scramble there was to find small dry twigs!  There was a smart breeze blowing, and most of the matches went out as soon as lighted, putting their owners out of the contest.  Sahwah was wise and piled her twigs where a huge stump sheltered them from the wind; Hinpoha sat between hers and the wind.  Even then it was difficult to get the twigs to burn.  It seemed as if they were in league against the contestants and firmly refused to light.  \"Two and a half minutes,\" called Nyoda warningly, her watch in her hand.  \"Mine's burning,\" shouted Hinpoha, jumping up as the flames began to curl up from the twigs.  Just then a gust of wind came up, and pouf! out went the fire.  \"Time's up!\" called Nyoda, and Sahwah rose from her knees, disclosing a neat little blaze.  She had wisely sheltered her fire until the last second, giving it a chance to kindle well.  Now it was the custom of the Winnebagos to have a folk story told by one of their number right after supper, but as the visitors would have to leave early Nyoda asked if the girls wouldn't like to tell the folk story before supper.  They agreed, as usual, to anything that would give pleasure to a guest.  It was Migwan's turn to tell the story, so seating herself on a rock in the midst of the group, she related the story of Aliquipiso, the heroic Oneida maiden.  \"Once upon a time the savage Mingoes made war upon the Oneidas, so the Oneidas were obliged to flee from their pleasant village and seek refuge in the depths of the forest.  So well did they hide their traces that the Mingoes were not able to find their hiding place and they remained safe. Their food supply, however, began to be exhausted, for they were hemmed in by the Mingoes and could not break through the lines.  They were facing destruction in two ways; either by slow starvation should they remain in hiding, or a cruel death at the hands of the Mingoes should they venture out.  The chiefs and warriors of the Oneidas held a council, but none had a plan to offer which would effect their salvation.  Then the maiden Aliquipiso stepped forward.  With becoming modesty she addressed the chiefs and warriors, saying that the Great Manitou had sent her a dream in which he showed her how great boulders could be dashed on the heads of the Mingoes if they could be lured to a spot directly beneath the bluff on which the Oneidas were hiding.  She went on to say that the Great Manitou had inspired her with the desire to be the means of luring the Mingoes to their destruction, and she was ready to start out on her mission.  \"The Oneida braves hailed her as the saviour of her people and the Beloved of the Great Spirit, and hung strings of wampum around her neck.  Bidding her people farewell, she left the hiding place and was found by the Mingoes wandering in the forest, apparently a lost maiden of the Oneida tribe.  They took her to their camp and put her to torture trying to make her tell where her people were hidden.  At last she broke down and promised that when night fell she would lead the Mingoes to the hiding place of the Oneidas.  \"Under cover of the darkness she led them to the gully at the foot of the ravine.  On each side of her was a Mingo warrior, ready to strike her dead at the first cry for help.  When she reached the spot where she knew the Oneidas were waiting to hurl immense boulders down over the cliff she uttered a piercing scream--the signal agreed upon.  The warrior next to her had just time to strike her dead with his club when the boulders came down, crushing him and all the Mingoes like worms beneath a giant's heel.  Thus the Oneidas owed their deliverance to the bravery of a maiden.\"  \"It must be fine to be a heroine,\" sighed Sahwah, when the applause was finished, \"to save a person's life or something.  I wish I had lived in the early days of the country.  Nothing ever happens now.\"  Unsuspecting Sahwah!  Little did she dream what was hidden under the wings of the Thunder Moon!  The guests rose to depart, after inspecting the tents and partaking of sandwiches and cocoa out on the Sunset Rock.  Nyoda took them across the lake in the _Sunbeam_, the little launch that belonged to camp.  Both gentlemen expressed their unbounded admiration for the physical prowess of the Winnebago girls and remarked on their splendid ability to pull together.  Professor Wheeler raved about Hinpoha's hair.  \"Let me come and paint her,\" he pleaded.  \"Sitting out on the rocks--with the sun on that hair--O, what a picture!\"  Gently but firmly, Nyoda refused permission.  \"The girls have come up here for a summer all by themselves; to learn the joys of camping out and of doing things together.  Such an interruption would break up the unity of their activities and lessen the influence of camp.\"  Professor Wheeler begged and entreated, but in vain; Nyoda stood her ground. The most she would promise to do was to send him Hinpoha's address at the close of camp so that he might take the matter up with her parents.  Nyoda returned home very thoughtful.  Hinpoha's dawning beauty was causing her many thoughtful moments of late.  Not that Hinpoha was in the least vain or self-conscious; on the contrary, she was the jolliest and most natural girl in the group, and the least fastidious.  That same red hair which Professor Wheeler raved over was the bane of her existence, and she had more than once threatened to cut it off when the curls became hopelessly snarled. Her chief aim in life was to have as much fun as possible and to get as many others mixed up in it as she could. Hinpoha, haughty and proud because of her good looks, was a picture that the imagination balked at.  Yet Nyoda could not help noticing that wherever the group went Hinpoha attracted by far the most attention from outsiders.  All the way down from Cleveland on the train Nyoda had watched men who had scarcely taken their eyes from Hinpoha.  The guardian sighed as she reflected on the problem, for she knew how difficult it would be for Hinpoha to live out the happy normal girl life which was her birthright.  When Nyoda reached camp Hinpoha and Sahwah were lying on their stomachs on the dock, rigging up a light-boat to be sent over the lake.  It consisted of a flat board for a keel and voluminous sails dipped in turpentine.  As Nyoda landed they set a match to the sails and shoved the boat out into the wind. It made a grand glare as it glided out over the lake and the girls cheered until the last spark had fallen hissing into the water.  \"Wasn't it a grand success all the way through?\" sighed Sahwah happily as they climbed the path to the tents at the sound of the first bugle.  \"First we thought it was going to rain and then the sun shone; and first we thought we weren't going to have any audience and then we did anyway, and the dinner didn't burn and everything was lovely!\"  The day had been pretty strenuous for most of the girls and it was not long before Nepahwin, the Spirit of Sleep, claimed them for his own.  Then it was that the Dream Manitou, hovering over the Omega tent, fluttered down on Sahwah's pillow.  In fancy she roamed through the virgin forest, before the white man had come to destroy the Indian lodges.  She was the daughter of a Chieftain, the acknowledged leader of the other maidens.  Now there was a young brave belonging to a neighboring tribe with whom she was in love, but there was enmity between her tribe and his, and he dared not ask for her hand.  So they were in the habit of meeting secretly in the forest.  One day when they were together they became aware of footsteps approaching, and peering through the bushes saw a number of braves belonging to the young man's tribe close upon them.  So great was their hatred of her father that for them to find her would mean instant death.  \"Fly!  fly!\" whispered her lover, \"fly to the edge of the cliff and jump for your life.  My canoe is at the foot of the cliff--take it and escape while I divert the attention of these braves!\"  Like an arrow from the bow she set out. Reaching the edge of the cliff, she poised for an instant, then leaped into the lake twenty feet below.  As she struck the water Sahwah woke up.  All about her was darkness and seeming chaos.  There was a swirling about her ears and her limbs seemed detached from her body.  She seemed to be rising rapidly.  Suddenly her head shot clear of the enveloping gloom and she saw the moon and stars overhead.  Just above her reared a black framework.  Mechanically she flung out her hand and grasped solid wood.  The next moment a voice rang out above her head. \"Sahwah! What are you doing?\"  Then a hand came over the edge of the dock and pulled her up.  It was Nyoda. Sahwah blinked at her stupidly.  \"Whatever possessed you to jump off the tower?\" persisted Nyoda.  \"He told me to jump and I did,\" said Sahwah, still in a daze. Then suddenly her eyes fell on her nightdress, dripping at every fold.  \"Where am I?\" she said sharply, her teeth beginning to chatter.  \"Why, _Nyoda!_\"  Nyoda laughed.  \"You dreamed it, dear,\" she said.  \"You jumped off the tower in your sleep.  Come up to bed now before you take cold.\"  Putting her arm around the shivering girl, she led her up the path to the tent and tucked her in between dry blankets. \"Too much celebration,\" she reflected, and then added to herself, \"It's a good thing I happened to see her.\"  Nyoda had wakened in the night and lay looking out through the tent door at the lake bathed in moonlight.  The diving tower was right in her line of vision, solitary and black against the moonlight.  Suddenly she became aware of a figure climbing up the ladder to the top.  She sat up in bed and rubbed her eyes and recognized Sahwah.  The girl poised for an instant on the edge and then jumped into the water.  Nyoda sped down the path and reached the dock just as Sahwah came up.  \"And up until now,\" thought"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18606"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls in the Maine Woods; Or, The Winnebagos Go Camping (#7)"],["body","da, as she dropped off to sleep again, \"I did think they were safe in their beds!\"    CHAPTER IV.  IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE.  At the close of singing hour one morning the week following the Fourth-of-July celebration Nyoda rose with an air of mystery and requested the girls not to make up their beds as usual, but instead to roll their blankets in their ponchos and pile them up together.  A shriek of joy went up from the girls.  \"What is it, Nyoda, a canoe trip?\"  Nyoda shook her head.  \"You'll see,\" was all she would say. Immediately she was surrounded by the girls clamoring to be told where they were going.  \"I surrender,\" she said, laughing at Migwan, who was embracing her feet in supplication, \"we're going hunting.\"  \"Hunting what?\" clamored the chorus.  \"Oh, adventures and such things,\" said Nyoda in an off-hand manner.  \"Where are we going?\"  \"How are we going?\"  \"When are we going to start?\" shouted the girls from all sides.  Nyoda put her hands over her ears and tapped for silence with her foot.  \"One at a time, please, ladies, and I will endeavor to answer any questions that may come into your minds,\" she said in her best lecture-room manner.  \"Oh, Nyoda, tell us,\" begged the girls.  \"Having your kind permission to speak,\" resumed Nyoda, \"I will try to state the case briefly.  Now then, one, two, three!  We're going to Balsam Lake!\"  \"It's a hike!\" shouted Sahwah, turning a handspring.  \"Is it, Nyoda?\" asked Migwan.  Nyoda nodded.  \"That's it.  We're going to hike through the woods to Balsam Lake, which is a distance of about twelve miles, camp there for the night, and return to-morrow by another route.\"  \"O Goody!\" cried Sahwah, hopping up and down on one foot, \"when are we going to start?\"  \"The first two will start at ten o'clock,\" said Nyoda.  \"The first two!\" echoed the girls.  \"Aren't we all going together?\"  Then Nyoda outlined her plan.  Believing that the girls would collect more adventures by going in pairs instead of all together, besides the fun of following a trail marked out by leaders, she had arranged the girls two by two.  The first pair, who would be the pathfinders and blaze the trail for those coming after, would leave at ten o'clock, the next pair twenty minutes later, then the next, and so on.  Their ponchos would be brought in a wagon over the main road and left for them; they would buy their supplies for supper and breakfast at the last village they passed through.  Their lunches, they would carry with them.  The first two were to buy potatoes and start the fire and put them in, while the rest would bring the other supplies.  \"Who and who are going to be partners?\" demanded Sahwah.  \"Listen, while I read the list,\" answered Nyoda.  \"Sahwah and Nakwisi, Hinpoha and Migwan, Gladys and Chapa, Medmangi and myself.  You will leave camp in the order I have named you. Sahwah and Nakwisi will be the pathfinders.\" Sahwah seized Nakwisi around the waist and the two danced for joy.  \"Who'll take care of the camp while we're away?\" asked Chapa.  \"I have arranged with a man from the village to look after things until we get back,\" answered Nyoda.  \"What are we to carry with us?\" asked Migwan.  \"You will each carry a hatchet, flashlight, notebook and pencil, a camera, a roll of antiseptic gauze and a roll of surgeon's plaster.  Sahwah and Nakwisi, here is a chart of the road you are to take and a can of vermilion paint with which to mark the trail.  Take all the pictures you can along the road, girls, and keep a list of the birds, animals, trees and flowers that you recognize.  We will compare them afterward and the pair who has observed the most will receive a local honor.  Hurry up, you pathfinders, you have only an hour to get ready!\"  With a wild scramble the girls made for their tents to get their ponchos rolled and things collected.  Nyoda had given them a demonstration of poncho rolling the week before so they all knew how.  Gladys, however, had to have a good deal of help from Chapa before she was ready to start.  Good-natured Chapa folded her blankets so the poncho extended on all sides and spread her nightgown, towel, brush and comb and toothbrush crosswise so they would roll.  Now Gladys understood why Nyoda had told her especially to bring a small, loosely-stuffed pillow.  It was to roll in the poncho.  When it came to the actual rolling Gladys had to take a hand herself, for it takes two to roll a poncho successfully.  \"Now you tie it up with a square knot,\" directed Chapa, when the stovepipe-like roll had been bent into a horseshoe.  \"What's a square knot?\" asked Gladys.  \"Why, this kind,\" said Chapa, dexterously tying one.  Gladys tried several times, but failed to produce a square knot.  \"O dear,\" she exclaimed impatiently, \"I can't tie the crazy thing. Why won't the other kind do?\"  \"A granny knot always comes untied,\" explained Chapa. \"Here, I'll tie your poncho up. It's getting late, and I want to help make the sandwiches for the girls who are starting first.\"  \"Close your tents before you leave, girls,\" said Nyoda, appearing in the doorway, \"it may rain while we are away.  Very neatly done,\" she said, indicating Gladys's poncho with its smooth ties, \"you are fast learning to be a camper.\"  Gladys said nothing about Chapa's having done it up for her, and of course Chapa would not say so.  Promptly at ten o'clock the pathfinders marched away, looking quite explorerfied with their hatchets hanging from their belts and their Wohelo knives chained to their bloomer pockets.  At twenty-minute intervals the other pairs started, Nyoda going the rounds before she left to see who had left her things in the neatest order, and whose poncho looked the best.  A banner would go to the pair who kept up the best style throughout the hike. She and Medmangi ate their lunch before starting, as they left so near noon.  Leaving camp in the care of the man from the village, they struck into the path through the woods.  The whole earth seemed filled with the scent of flowers and the invigorating odor of the pines. Here in Maine the wild strawberries were in full prime early in July, and the path was bordered with daisies and other bright flowers.  The two swung along in silence with an enjoyment too deep for words, for they appreciated as only Camp Fire Girls can the beauties and, wonders of nature.  Back somewhere in the world they had left behind dull care might be beating its incessant tom-tom, and the air was full of wars and rumors of wars, but here every harsh note was drowned in the singing of birds. \"Isn't it glorious?\" said Nyoda fervently, drinking in a long breath of the pine-scented air, and swelling out her already well-developed chest.  Presently the path they were on was crossed by another and at the intersection there was a splash of bright red paint on a tree. \"A blaze!\" cried Nyoda, stopping short.  \"Which path did they take, I wonder?\"  In the road at the foot of the blazed tree lay a small heap of stones pointing in the direction taken by the leaders.  \"What's this?\" asked Nyoda, picking up a small box from beside the stones.  It was marked \"For Nyoda.\"  She lifted the lid and out hopped a tiny live frog.  In the bottom of the box was a piece of paper on which was drawn a sunfish.  So they went on for nearly half an hour, following the red blazes, when suddenly they came upon Chapa and Gladys sitting in the road.  Gladys had a blister on her heel.  Nyoda bandaged it for her and showed her how to put a piece of adhesive on the other heel to keep it from blistering.  The rule of the road was that if one pair caught up with another they were to sit down and give them a ten minutes' start.  So Nyoda and Medmangi sat down and waited until Gladys and Chapa were well under way.  The next blaze they struck was truly startling.  It was a little silver birch tree with the stem painted entirely red.  Nailed to it with a big rusty nail was a piece of cardboard.  At the top was written:      \"Sahwah and the Starlore Maiden     Keep ahead though heavy laden.\"  Then followed a many-pointed symbol and the words, \"See our combination symbol? It's a starfish!\" Underneath was a couplet in a different writing.      \"Here come Migwan and Hinpoha     Two and two like the beasts of Noah.\"  Underneath that was a verse signed by \"The Chipmunk.\"      \"Gladys's heel is full of plaster,     Or else we would travel faster.\"  Nyoda and Medmangi shouted and took the card along for a souvenir, adding the lines,      \"Here Nyoda and Medmangi     Read the blaze and held a tangi.\"  A little farther on they discovered the legend:      \"Here we sit down in the road,     For Sahwah's stocking must be sewed.\"  \"What's the matter, Grumpy?\" said Migwan to Hinpoha, who had been stewing around to herself for the last ten minutes.  \"It's this old orange I brought along for lunch,\" burst out Hinpoha.  \"I don't know what to do with it.  If I put it in my bloomers it bangs against my leg, and if I carry it in my bag it bangs against my stomach, and if I carry it in my hand I drop it every other minute.  It's driving me crazy.\"  \"Why don't you eat it?\" asked Migwan simply.  \"Why, I never thought of that!\" exclaimed Hinpoha, and soon had the offending orange safely disposed of.  Lunch time found Sahwah and Nakwisi close to a farm house and they went in to ask for a drink of water.  The farmer's wife looked curiously at the two girls in bloomers carrying a can of red paint.  Sahwah introduced Nakwisi and herself and explained what they were doing.  \"Land sakes alive!\" exclaimed the farmer's wife, \"what girls don't do nowadays!  Livin' like Indians and walkin' their legs off just for the fun of it!  Come right in and I'll see if I can't find something better than water to give you.\"  She bustled out into the summer kitchen and returned with a pitcher of milk and two glasses.  \"Here, drink this along with your sandwiches, and try a dish of berries.\"  Sahwah and Nakwisi needed no second invitation.  Their sandwiches had been"]]]
