To break the silence he asked carelessly if the Inspector had gone.  Cayley nodded. Then he said abruptly, “He’s getting a warrant for Mark’s arrest.”  Bill made a suitably sympathetic noise, and Antony said with a shrug of the shoulders, “Well, he was bound to do that, wasn’t he? It doesn’t follow that—well, it doesn’t mean anything. They naturally want to get hold of your cousin, innocent or guilty.”  “Which do you think he is, Mr. Gillingham?” said Cayley, looking at him steadily.  “Mark? It’s absurd,” said Bill impetuously.  “Bill’s loyal, you see, Mr. Cayley.”  “And you owe no loyalty to anyone concerned?”  “Exactly. So perhaps I might be too frank.”  Bill had dropped down on the grass, and Cayley took his place on the seat, and sat there heavily, his elbows on his knees, his chin on his hands, gazing at the ground.  “I want you to be quite frank,” he said at last. “Naturally I am prejudiced where Mark is concerned. So I want to know how my suggestion strikes you—who have no prejudices either way.”  “Your suggestion?”  “My theory that, if Mark killed his brother, it was purely accidental—as I told the Inspector.”  Bill looked up with interest.  “You mean that Robert did the hold-up business,” he said, “and there was a bit of a struggle, and the revolver went off, and then Mark lost his head and bolted? That sort of idea?”  “Exactly.”  “Well, that seems all right.” He turned to Antony. “There’s nothing wrong with that, is there? It’s the most natural explanation to anyone who knows Mark.”  Antony pulled at his pipe.  “I suppose it is,” he said slowly. “But there’s one thing that worries me rather.”  “What’s that?” Bill and Cayley asked the question simultaneously.  “The key.”  “The key?” said Bill.  Cayley lifted his head and looked at Antony. “What about the key?” he asked.  “Well, there may be nothing in it; I just wondered. Suppose Robert was killed as you say, and suppose Mark lost his head and thought of nothing but getting away before anyone could see him. Well, very likely he’d lock the door and put the key in his pocket. He’d do it without thinking, just to gain a moment’s time.”  “Yes, that’s what I suggest.”  “It seems sound enough,” said Bill. “Sort of thing you’d do without thinking. Besides, if you are going to run away, it gives you more of a chance.”  “Yes, that’s all right if the key is there. But suppose it isn’t there?”  The suggestion, made as if it were already an established fact, startled them both. They looked at him wonderingly.  “What do you mean?” said Cayley.  “Well, it’s just a question of where people happen to keep their keys. You go up to your bedroom, and perhaps you like to lock your door in case anybody comes wandering in when you’ve only got one sock and a pair of braces on. Well, that’s natural enough. And if you look round the bedrooms of almost any house, you’ll find the keys all ready, so that you can lock yourself in at a moment’s notice. But downstairs people don’t lock themselves in. It’s really never done at all. Bill, for instance, has never locked himself into the dining-room in order to be alone with the sherry. On the other hand, all women, and particularly servants, have a horror of burglars. And if a burglar gets in by the window, they like to limit his activities to that particular room. So they keep the keys on the _out_side of the doors, and lock the doors when they go to bed.” He knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and added, “At least, my mother always used to.”  “You mean,” said Bill excitedly, “that the key was on the outside of the door when Mark went into the room?”  “Well, I was just wondering.”  “Have you noticed the other rooms—the billiard-room, and library, and so on?” said Cayley.  “I’ve only just thought about it while I’ve been sitting out here. You live here—haven’t you ever noticed them?”  Cayley sat considering, with his head on one side.  “It seems rather absurd, you know, but I can’t say that I have.” He turned to Bill. “Have you?”  “Good Lord, no. I should never worry about a thing like that.”  “I’m sure you wouldn’t,” laughed Antony. “Well, we can have a look when we go in. If the other keys are outside, then this one was probably outside too, and in that case—well, it makes it more interesting.”  Cayley said nothing. Bill chewed a piece of grass, and then said, “Does it make much difference?”  “It makes it more hard to understand what happened in there. Take your accidental theory and see where you get to. No instinctive turning of the key now, is there? He’s got to open the door to get it, and opening the door means showing his head to anybody in the hall—his cousin, for instance, whom he left there two minutes ago. Is a man in Mark’s state of mind, frightened to death lest he should be found with the body, going to do anything so foolhardy as that?”  “He needn’t have been afraid of _me_,” said Cayley.  “Then why didn’t he call for you? He knew you were about. You could have advised him; Heaven knows he wanted advice. But the whole theory of Mark’s escape is that he was afraid of you and of everybody else, and that he had no other idea but to get out of the room himself, and prevent you or the servants from coming into it. If the key had been on the inside, he would probably have locked the door. If it were on the outside, he almost certainly wouldn’t.”  “Yes, I expect you’re right,” said Bill thoughtfully. “Unless he took the key in with him, and locked the door at once.”  “Exactly. But in that case you have to build up a new theory entirely.”  “You mean that it makes it seem more deliberate?”  “Yes; that, certainly. But it also seems to make Mark out an absolute idiot. Just suppose for a moment that, for urgent reasons which neither of you know anything about, he had wished to get rid of his brother. Would he have done it like that? Just killed him and then run away? Why, that’s practically suicide—suicide whilst of unsound mind. No. If you really wanted to remove an undesirable brother, you would do it a little bit more cleverly than that. You’d begin by treating him as a friend, so as to avoid suspicion, and when you did kill him at last, you would try to make it look like an accident, or suicide, or the work of some other man. Wouldn’t you?”  “You mean you’d give yourself a bit of a run for your money?”  “Yes, that’s what I mean. If you were going to do it deliberately, that is to say—and lock yourself in before you began.”  Cayley had been silent, apparently thinking over this new idea. With his eyes still on the ground, he said now: “I hold to my opinion that it was purely accidental, and that Mark lost his head and ran away.”  “But what about the key?” asked Bill.  “We don’t know yet that the keys were outside. I don’t at all agree with Mr. Gillingham that the keys of the down-stairs rooms are always outside the doors. Sometimes they are, no doubt; but I think we shall probably find that these are inside.”  “Oh, well, of course, if they are inside, then your original theory is probably the correct one. Having often seen them outside, I just wondered—that’s all. You asked me to be quite frank, you know, and tell you what I thought. But no doubt you’re right, and we shall find them inside, as you say.  “Even if the key was outside,” went on Cayley stubbornly, “I still think it might have been accidental. He might have taken it in with him, knowing that the interview would be an unpleasant one, and not wishing to be interrupted.”  “But he had just told you to stand by in case he wanted you; so why should he lock you out? Besides, I should think that if a man were going to have an unpleasant interview with a threatening relation, the last thing he would do would be to barricade himself in with him. He would want to open all the doors and say, ‘Get out of it!’”  Cayley was silent, but his mouth looked obstinate. Antony gave a little apologetic laugh and stood up.  “Well, come on, Bill,” he said; “we ought to be stepping.” He held out a hand and pulled his friend up. Then, turning to Cayley, he went on, “You must forgive me if I have let my thoughts run on rather. Of course, I was considering the matter purely as an outsider; just as a problem, I mean, which didn’t concern the happiness of any of my friends.”  “That’s all right, Mr. Gillingham,” said Cayley, standing up too. “It is for you to make allowances for _me_. I’m sure you will. You say that you’re going up to the inn now about your bag?”  “Yes.” He looked up at the sun and then round the parkland stretching about the house. “Let me see; it’s over in _that_ direction, isn’t it?” He pointed southwards. “Can we get to the village that way, or must we go by the road?”  “I’ll show you, my boy,” said Bill.  “Bill will show you. The park reaches almost as far as the village. Then I’ll send the car round in about half an hour.”  “Thanks very much.”  Cayley nodded and turned to go into the house. Antony took hold of Bill’s arm and walked off with him in the opposite direction.     CHAPTER VII. Portrait of a Gentleman   They walked in silence for a little, until they had left the house and gardens well behind them. In front of them and to the right the park dipped and then rose slowly, shutting out the rest of the world. A thick belt of trees on the left divided them from the main road.  “Ever been here before?” said Antony suddenly.  “Oh, rather. Dozens of times.”  “I meant just here—where we are now. Or do you stay indoors and play billiards all the time?”  “Oh Lord, no!”  “Well, tennis and things. So many people with beautiful parks never by any chance use them, and all the poor devils passing by on the dusty road think how lucky the owners are to have them, and imagine them doing all sorts of jolly things inside.” He pointed to the right. “Ever been over there?”  Bill laughed, as if a little ashamed.  “Well, not very much. I’ve often been along here, of course, because it’s"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],["title","The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net/) from page images generously made available by the Kentuckiana Digital Library (http://kdl.kyvl.org/)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

Forced by his people to lead their cause, his genius created an engine of war so terrible in its power that through it five million Southerners, without money, without a market, without credit, withstood for four years the shock of twenty million men of their own blood and of equal daring, backed by boundless resources._  _The achievement is without a parallel in history, and adds new glory to the records of our race._  _The scenes have all been drawn from authentic records in my possession. I have not at any point taken a liberty with an essential detail of history._  Thomas Dixon.

THE VICTIM  The Prologue     THE VICTIM   PROLOGUE     I  KIDNAPPED   The hot sun of the South was sinking in red glow through the giant tree-tops of a Mississippi forest beyond the village of Woodville. A slender girl stood in the pathway watching a boy of seven trudge manfully away beside his stalwart brother.  Her lips trembled and eyes filled with tears.  \"Wait--wait!\" she cried.  With a sudden bound she snatched him to her heart.  \"Don't, Polly--you hurt!\" the little fellow faltered, looking at her with a feeling of sudden fear. \"Why did you squeeze me so hard?\"  \"You shouldn't have done that, honey,\" the big brother frowned.  \"I know,\" the sister pleaded, \"but I couldn't help it.\"  \"What are you crying about?\" the boy questioned.  Again the girl's arm stole around his neck.  \"What's the matter with her, Big Brother?\" he asked with a brave attempt at scorn.  The man slowly loosened the sister's arms.  \"I'm just going home with you, ain't I?\" the child went on, with a quiver in his voice.  The older brother led him to a fallen log, sat down, and held his hands.  \"No, Boy,\" he said quietly. \"I'd as well tell you the truth now. I'm going to send you to Kentucky to a wonderful school, taught by learned men from the Old World--wise monks who know everything. You want to go to a real school, don't you?\"  \"But my Mamma don't know--\"  \"That's just it, Boy. We can't tell her. She wouldn't let you go.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Well, she's a good Baptist, and it's a long, long way to the St. Thomas monastery.\"  \"How far?\"  \"A thousand miles, through these big woods--\"  The blue eyes dimmed.  \"I want to see my Mamma before I go--\" his voice broke.  The man shook his head.  \"No, Boy; it won't do. You're her baby--\"  The dark head sank with a cry.  \"I want to see her!\"  \"Come, come, Jeff Davis, you're going to be a soldier. Remember you're the son of a soldier who fought under General Washington and won our freedom. You're named after Thomas Jefferson, the great President. Your three brothers have just come home from New Orleans. Under Old Hickory we drove the British back into their ships and sent 'em flying home to England. The son of a soldier--the brother of soldiers--can't cry--\"  \"I will if I want to!\"  \"All right!\" the man laughed--\"I'll hold my hat and you can cry it full--\"  He removed his hat and held it smilingly under the boy's firm little chin. The childish lips tightened and the cheeks flushed with anger. His bare toes began to dig holes in the soft rich earth. The appeal to his soldier blood had struck into the pride of his heart and the insult of a hat full of tears had hurt.  At last, he found his tongue:  \"Does Pa know I'm goin'?\"  \"Yes. He thinks you're a very small boy to go so far, but knows it's for the best.\"  \"That's why he kissed me when I left?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I thought it was funny,\" he murmured with a half sob; \"he never kissed me before--\"  \"He's quiet and reserved, Boy, but he's wise and good and loves you. He's had a hard time out here in the wilderness fighting his way with a wife and ten children. He never had a chance to get an education and the children didn't either. Some of us are too old now. There's time for you. We're going to stand aside and let you pass. You're our baby brother, and we love you.\"  The child's hand slowly stole into the rough one of the man.  \"And I love you, Big Brother--\" the little voice faltered, \"and all the others, too, and that's-why-I'm-not-goin'!\"  \"I'm so glad!\" The girl clapped her hands and laughed.  \"Polly!--\"  \"Well, I am, and I don't care what you say. He's too little to go so far and you know he is--\"  The man grasped her hand and whispered:  \"Hush!\"  The brother slipped his arm around the Boy and drew him on his knee. He waited a moment until the hard lines at the corners of the firm mouth had relaxed under the pressure of his caress, pushed the tangled hair back from his forehead and looked into the fine blue-gray eyes. His voice was tender and his speech slow.  \"You must make up your mind to go, Boy. I don't want to force you. I like to see your eyes flash when you say you _won't_ go. You've got the stuff in you that real men are made of. That's why it's worth while to send you. I've seen that since you could toddle about the house and stamp your feet when things didn't suit you. Now, listen to me. I've made a vow to God that you shall have as good a chance as any man to make your way to the top. We're going to be the greatest nation in the world. I saw it in the red flash of guns that day at New Orleans as I lay there in the trench and watched the long lines of Red Coats go down before us. Just a lot of raw recruits with old flintlocks! The men who charged us, the picked veterans of England's grand army. But we cut 'em to pieces, Boy! I fired a cannon loaded with grape shot that mowed a lane straight through 'em. It must have killed two hundred men. They burned our Capitol at Washington and the Federalist traitors at"]]]
