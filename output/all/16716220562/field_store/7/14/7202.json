They went to New York, and in an out-of-the-way locality they went down to a wharf; but there was no steamer or vessel of any kind there, and the pier was falling to pieces from decay. Captain Passford stopped short, and seemed to be confounded when he found the dock was not occupied.  \"I am afraid we are too late, and that the steamer has sailed on her mission of destruction,\" said he, almost overcome by the discovery. \"She was here last night, and was watched till this morning. She has already cleared, bound to Wilmington, Delaware, with a cargo of old iron.\"  \"Do you know her name, Captain Passford?\" asked the commander of the Chateaugay.  \"She was a screw steamer of about six hundred tons, and was called the Ionian, but she is American.\"  It was useless to remain there any longer, for the steamer certainly was not there. Captain Passford hailed a passing-tug-boat, and they were taken on board. The master of the boat was instructed to steam down the East River, and the party examined every steamer at anchor or under way. The tug had nearly reached the Battery before the leader of the trio saw any vessel that looked like the Ionian. The tug went around this craft, for she resembled the one which had been in the dock, and the name indicated was found on her stern.  \"I breathe easier, for I was afraid she had given us the slip,\" said Captain Passford. \"She is evidently all ready to sail.\"  \"The Chateaugay is in commission, and ready to sail at a moment's notice,\" added her commander.  \"But you are not ready to leave at once, Christy,\" suggested Captain Passford, with some anxiety in his expression.  \"Yes, I am, father; I put my valises on board yesterday, and when mother and Florry went down to Mr. Pembroke's I bade them both good-by, for after I have waited so long for my passage, I felt that the call would come in a hurry,\" replied Christy. \"I am all ready to go on board of the Chateaugay at this moment.\"  \"And so am I,\" added Captain Chantor.  \"But I am not ready with your orders in full, though they are duly signed,\" said Captain Passford. \"I will put you on shore at the foot of Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, Captain Chantor, and you will hasten to your ship, get up steam, and move down to this vicinity. I will put my son on board as soon as I can have your papers completed.\"  The order necessary to carry out this procedure was given to the captain of the tug, and the commander of the Chateaugay was landed at the place indicated. The tug started for the other side of the river.  \"It seems to me this is very strange business, father,\" said Christy, as he and his father seated themselves at the stern of the boat.  \"Traitors do not work in the daylight, my son, as you have learned before this time,\" replied Captain Passford.  \"If you know the men who are engaged in supplying the enemy with machinery, why do you not have them arrested and put in Fort Lafayette?\" asked Christy, in a very low tone, after he had assured himself that no person was within possible hearing distance. \"It looks as though the case might be settled here, without going to sea to do it.\"  \"We have not sufficient evidence to convict them; and to make arrests without the means of conviction would be worse than doing nothing. The Ionian has cleared for Wilmington with a cargo of old iron. Everything looks regular in regard to her, and I have no doubt there is some party who would claim the castings if occasion required. The first thing to be ascertained is whether or not the steamer goes to Wilmington.\"  \"Then we can make short work of her.\"  \"My information in regard to this treason comes from Warnock--you know who he is?\"  \"Captain Barnes,\" replied Christy promptly, for the names of all the agents of his father in England and Scotland had been given to him on a former occasion, when the information received from one of the three had resulted in the capture of the Scotian and the Arran.  \"Barnes is a very shrewd man. He does not inform me yet in what manner he obtained the information that the Ovidio was to carry this machinery from Nassau into a rebel port; but I shall get it later in a letter. He gave me the name of the party who was to furnish the machinery; and one of his agents obtained this from the direction of a letter to New York. I placed four skilful detectives around this man, who stands well in the community. They have worked the case admirably, and spotted the Ionian. I have aided them in all possible ways; but the evidence is not complete. If this steamer proceeds beyond Wilmington, Captain Chantor will be instructed to capture her and send her back to New York.\"  \"Then this business will soon be settled,\" added Christy.  \"Perhaps not; the government official, with authority to act, is in New York. I shall see him at once. I have no doubt the detectives have already reported that the Ionian has moved down the river,\" said Captain Passford, as the tug came up to a pier, where father and son landed.  They went to an office in Battery Place, where the captain was informed that a special messenger had been sent to Bonnydale to acquaint him with the fact that the Ionian had moved down the river. Files of documents, containing reports of detectives and other papers, were examined and compared, and then the government official proceeded to finish the filling out of Captain Chantor's orders. The paper was given to Christy, with an order to deliver it to the commander of the Chateaugay. The tug had been detained for them, and they hastened on board of her.  They found the suspected steamer at her moorings still; but it was evident that she was preparing to weigh her anchor. The tug continued on her course towards the Navy Yard, and the Chateaugay was discovered in the berth she had occupied for the last two weeks. Everything looked lively on board of her, as though she were getting ready to heave up her anchor.  \"Christy, you will find on board of your steamer a man by the name of Gilfleur,\" said Captain Passford, as the tug approached the man-of-war.  \"That sounds like a French name,\" interposed Christy.  \"It is a French name, and the owner of it is a Frenchman who has been a detective in Paris. He has accomplished more in this matter than all the others put together, and he will go with you, for you will find in the commander's instructions that you have more than one thing to do on your way to the Gulf. I gave him a letter to you.\"  \"I shall be glad to see him.\"  \"Now, my son, we must part, for I have business on shore, and you may have to sail at any moment,\" said Captain Passford, as he took the two hands of his son. \"I have no advice to give you except to be prudent, and on this duty to be especially discreet. That's all--good-by.\"  They parted, after wringing each other's hands, as they had parted several times before. They might never meet again in this world, but both of them subdued their emotion, for they were obeying the high and solemn call of duty; both of them were fighting for the right, and the civilian as well as the naval officer felt that it was his duty to lay down his life for his suffering country. Christy mounted the gangway, and was received by Captain Chantor on the quarter-deck. He had been on board before, and had taken possession of his stateroom.  The passenger took from his pocket the files of papers given him by the official on shore; and then he noticed for the first time an envelope addressed to him. The commander retired to his cabin to read his instructions, and Christy went to his stateroom in the ward room to open the envelope directed to him. As soon as he broke the seal he realized that his father had done a great deal of writing, and he had no doubt the paper contained full instructions for him, as well as a history of the difficult case in which he was to take a part. A paper signed by the official informed him that he was expected to occupy a sort of advisory position near the commander of the Chateaugay, though of course he was in no manner to control him in regard to the management of the ship.  Christy read his father's letter through. The government was exceedingly anxious to obtain accurate information in regard to the state of affairs at Nassau, that hot-bed for blockade-runners. The Chateaugay was to look out for the Ovidio, whose ultimate destination was Mobile, where she was to convey the gun-making machinery, and such other merchandise as the traitorous merchant of New York wished to send into the Confederacy. The name of this man was given to him, and it was believed that papers signed by him would be found on board of the Ionian.  A knock at the door of his room disturbed his examination of the documents, and he found the commander of the steamer there. After looking about the ward room, and into the adjoining staterooms, he came in without ceremony.  \"Here is my hand, Mr. Passford,\" said he, suiting the action to the word. \"I find after reading my instructions that I am expected to consult with you, and as I have the very highest respect and regard for you after the brilliant record you have made\"--  \"Don't you believe that I won my promotion to my present rank through the influence of my father?\" demanded Christy, laughing pleasantly, as he took the offered hand and warmly pressed it.  \"If you did, your father did the very best thing in the world for his country, and has given it one of the bravest and best officers in the service,\" replied Captain Chantor, still wringing the hand of his passenger. \"But I don't believe anything of the kind; and no officer who knows you, even if he is thirsting for promotion, believes it. I have heard a great many of higher rank than either of us speak of you, and if you had been present your ears would have tingled; but I never heard a single officer of any rank suggest that you owed your rapid advancement to anything but your professional skill and your unflinching bravery, as well as to your absolute and hearty"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18803"],["title","Fighting for the Right (#3)"],["body","to your country. I rank you in date, Mr. Passford, but I would give a great deal to have your record written against my name.\"  \"Your praise is exceedingly profuse, Captain Chantor, but I must believe you are honest, however unworthy I may be of your unstinted laudation,\" said Christy with his eyes fixed on the floor, and blushing like a school-girl.  \"I hope and believe there will be no discount on our fellowship. A man came on board this afternoon, and gives me a letter from the proper authority, referring me to you in regard to his mission.\"  Christy decided to see this person at once.     CHAPTER III  THE DEPARTURE OF THE CHATEAUGAY   The commander told Christy that he would probably find the person who had brought the letter to him in the waist, for he knew nothing of his quality, position, or anything else about him, and he did not know where to berth him, though there was room enough in the ward room or the steerage. He was dressed like a gentleman, and brought two very handsome valises on board with him.  \"For all that, I did not know but that he might be a French cook, a steward, or something of that sort,\" added Captain Chantor, laughing.  \"He is a man who is said to be a Napoleon in his profession; but I will tell you all about him after we get under way, for I am in a hurry to speak with him,\" replied Christy.  \"He is evidently a Frenchman,\" continued the captain.  \"He is; but I never saw him in my life, and know nothing about him except what I have learned from a long letter my father gave me when I was coming on board.\"  \"I have been told that you speak French like a native of Paris, Mr. Passford,\" suggested the commander.  \"Not so bad as that; I have studied the language a great deal under competent instructors from Paris, but I am not so proficient as you may think, though I can make my way with those who speak it,\" replied the passenger, as he moved towards the door of the stateroom.  \"And I can't speak the first word of it, for I have been a sailor all my life, though I went through the naval academy somewhat hurriedly,\" continued the commander.  \"Fortunately you don't need French on the quarter-deck;\" and Christy left the stateroom.  The captain went into his cabin, but came out before the passenger could reach the deck. He informed Christy that he was directed to heave short on the anchor and watch for a signal mentioned, which was to be hoisted near the Battery. He might get under way at any minute.  Christy found the person of whom the captain had spoken in the waist. He was dressed in a black suit, and looked more like a dandy than a detective. He was apparently about forty years of age, rather slenderly built, but with a graceful form. He wore a long black mustache, but no other beard. He was pacing the deck, and seemed to be very uneasy, possibly because he was all alone, for no one took any notice of him, though the captain had received him very politely.  \"Monsieur Gilfleur?\" said Christy, walking up to him, and bowing as politely as a Parisian.  \"I am Mr. Gilfleur; have I the honor to address Lieutenant Passford?\" replied the Frenchman.  \"I am Lieutenant Passford, though I have no official position on board of this steamer.\"  \"I am aware of it,\" added Mr. Gilfleur, as he chose to call himself, taking a letter from the breast pocket of his coat, and handing it very gracefully to Christy.  \"Pardon me,\" added the young officer, as he opened the missive.  It was simply a letter of introduction from Captain Passford, intended to assure him of the identity of the French detective. Mr. Gilfleur evidently prided himself on his knowledge of the English language, for he certainly spoke it fluently and correctly, though with a little of the accent of his native tongue.  \"I am very happy to meet you, Mr. Gilfleur,\" said Christy in French, as he extended his hand to the other, who promptly took it, and from that moment seemed to lose all his embarrassment.  \"I thank you, Mr. Passford, for this pleasant reception, for it is possible that we may have a great deal of business together, and I hope you have confidence in me.\"  \"Unlimited confidence, sir, since my father heartily indorses you.\"  \"I thank you, sir, and I am sure we shall be good friends, though I am not a gentleman like you, Mr. Passford.\"  \"You are my equal in every respect, for though my father is a very rich man, I am not. But we are all equals in this country.\"  \"I don't know about that,\" said the Frenchman, with a Parisian shrug of the shoulders. \"Your father has treated me very kindly, and I have heard a great deal about his brave and accomplished son,\" said Mr. Gilfleur, with a very deferential bow.  \"Spare me!\" pleaded Christy, with a deprecatory smile and a shake of the head.  \"You are very modest, Mr. Passford, and I will not offend you. I am not to speak of our mission before the Chateaugay is out of sight of land,\" said the detective, looking into the eyes of the young man with a gaze which seemed to reach the soul, for he was doubtless measuring the quality and calibre of his associate in the mission, as he called it, in which both were engaged. \"I knew your father very well in Paris,\" he added, withdrawing his piercing gaze.  \"Then you are the gentleman who found the stewardess of the Bellevite when she ran away with a bag of French gold at Havre?\" said Christy, opening his eyes.  \"I have the honor to be that person,\" replied Mr. Gilfleur, with one of his graceful bows. \"It was a difficult case, for the woman was associated with one of the worst thieves of Paris, and it took me a month to run them down.\"  \"Though I was a small boy, I remember it very well, for I was on board of the Bellevite at the time,\" replied Christy. \"I know that he was very enthusiastic in his praise of the wonderful skill of the person who recovered the money and sent the two thieves to prison. I understand now why my father sent to Paris for you when he needed a very skilful person of your profession.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Passford; you know me now, and we shall be good friends.\"  \"No doubt of it; but here comes the captain, and I have a word to say to him,\" added Christy, as he touched his naval cap to the commander. \"Allow me to introduce to you my friend Mr. Gilfleur, whom my father employed in Havre six years ago.\"  The captain was as polite as the Frenchman, and gave him a hearty reception. Christy then suggested that his friend should be berthed in the ward room. The ship's steward was called, and directed to give Mr. Gilfleur a room next to the other passenger. As they were likely to have many conferences together in regard to the business on their hands, they were both particular in regard to the location of their rooms; and the chief steward suited them as well as he could.  The detective spoke to him in French, but the steward could not understand a word he said. Christy inquired if any of the ward-room officers spoke the polite language, for his friend might sometimes wish to converse in his own tongue.  \"I don't believe they do, for they all got into the ward room through the hawse-hole,\" replied the steward, laughing at the very idea.  When the passengers went on deck, the commander introduced them both to the officers of the ship. To each in turn, at the request of Christy, he put the question as to whether or not he could speak French; and they all replied promptly in the negative, and laughed at the inquiry.  \"Have you no one on board who speaks French, Captain Chantor?\" asked Christy.  \"I don't know anything about it, but as it seems to be of some importance to you and your friend, I will ascertain at once. Mr. Suppleton, will you overhaul the ship's company, and see if you can find any one that speaks French,\" continued the commander, addressing the chief steward.  In about half an hour he returned, and reported that he was unable to find a single person who could speak a word of French. Doubtless many of the officers, who were of higher grade than any on board of the Chateaugay, were fluent enough in the language, but they were not to be found in the smaller vessels of the navy; for, whatever their rank before the war, they had all been advanced to the higher positions. Every one of the officers on board of this steamer had been the captain of a vessel, and had been instructed in the profession after the war began. Though substantially educated, they were not to be compared in this respect with the original officers.  \"We can talk as much as we please of our mission after we get out of sight of land; and as long as we do it in French, no one will understand us,\" said Christy to his fellow-passenger.  \"As soon as we are permitted by my orders to do so, I shall have much to say to you, Mr. Passford,\" replied Mr. Gilfleur.  \"On deck!\" shouted a man in the mizzen-top.  \"Aloft!\" returned Mr. Birdwing, the first lieutenant.  \"Signal over the boarding-station, sir!\" reported the quartermaster in the top. \"It is a number--'Get under way!'\"  The executive officer reported the signal to the commander, though he was on deck, and had heard the words of the quartermaster.  \"Get under way at once, Mr. Birdwing,\" said the captain.  \"Boatswain, all hands up anchor!\" said the first lieutenant to this officer; and in a moment the call rang through the ship.  Every officer and seaman was promptly in his station, for it was a welcome call. The ship's company were dreaming of prize-money, for officers had made fabulous sums from this source. In one instance a lieutenant received for his share nearly forty thousand dollars; and even an ordinary seaman pocketed seventeen hundred from a single capture. The Chateaugayans were anxious to engage in this harvest, and in a hurry to be on their way to the field of fortune.  In a short time the steamer was standing down East River at moderate speed. The Ionian could not be seen yet, and nothing in regard to her was known to any one on board except the captain and his two passengers. As the ship approached"]]]
