Have all of you your money for the contribution box?\"  Ding-dong!  Ding-dong!  It was a blithe bell, a sweet, true bell, a holy bell, and to Justin, pacing his tavern room, as to Nancy, trembling in her maiden chamber, it rang a Christmas message:--     Awake, glad heart!  Arise and sing;    It is the birthday of thy King!  The congregation filled every seat in the old Meeting-House.  As Maria Sharp had prophesied, there was one ill-natured spinster from a rival village who declared that the church floor looked like Joseph's coat laid out smooth; but in the general chorus of admiration, approval, and good will, this envious speech, though repeated from mouth to mouth, left no sting.  Another item of interest long recalled was the fact that on that august and unapproachable day the pulpit vases stood erect and empty, though Nancy Wentworth had filled them every Sunday since any one could remember.  This instance, though felt at the time to be of mysterious significance if the cause were ever revealed, paled into nothingness when, after the ringing of the last bell, Nancy Wentworth walked up the aisle on Justin Peabody's arm, and they took their seats side by side in the old family pew.  (\"And consid'able close, too, though there was plenty o' room!\")  (\"And no one that I ever heard of so much as suspicioned that they had ever kept company!\")  (\"And do you s'pose she knew Justin was expected back when she scrubbed his pew a-Friday?\")  (\"And this explains the empty pulpit vases!\")  (\"And I always said that Nancy would make a real handsome couple if she ever got anybody to couple with!\")  During the unexpected and solemn procession of the two up the aisle the soprano of the village choir stopped short in the middle of the Doxology, and the three other voices carried it to the end without any treble. Also, among those present there were some who could not remember afterward the precise petitions wafted upward in the opening prayer.  And could it be explained otherwise than by cheerfully acknowledging the bounty of an overruling Providence that Nancy Wentworth should have had a new winter dress for the first time in five years--a winter dress of dark brown cloth to match her beaver muff and victorine?  The existence of this toilette had been known and discussed in Edgewood for a month past, and it was thought to be nothing more than a proper token of respect from a member of the carpet committee to the general magnificence of the church on the occasion of its reopening after repairs.  Indeed, you could have identified every member of the Dorcas Society that Sunday morning by the freshness of her apparel.  The brown dress, then, was generally expected; but why the white cashmere waist with collar and cuffs of point lace, devised only and suitable only for the minister's wedding, where it first saw the light?  \"The white waist can only be explained as showing distinct hope!\" whispered the minister's wife during the reading of the church notices.  \"To me it shows more than hope; I am very sure that Nancy would never take any wear out of that lace for hope; it means certainty!\" answered Maria, who was always strong in the prophetic line.  By sermon time Justin's identity had dawned upon most of the congregation.  A stranger to all but one or two at first, his presence in the Peabody pew brought his face and figure back, little by little, to the minds of the old parishioners.  When the contribution plate was passed, the sexton always began at the right-wing pews, as all the sextons before him had done for a hundred years.  Every eye in the church was already turned upon Justin and Nancy, and it was with almost a gasp that those in the vicinity saw a ten dollar bill fall in the plate.  The sexton reeled, or, if that is too intemperate a word for a pillar of the church, the good man tottered, but caught hold of the pew rail with one hand, and, putting the thumb of his other over the bill, proceeded quickly to the next pew, lest the stranger should think better of his gift, or demand change, as had occasionally been done in the olden time.  Nancy never fluttered an eyelash, but sat quietly by Justin's side with her bosom rising and falling under the beaver fur and her cold hands clasped tight in the little brown muff.  Far from grudging this appreciable part of their slender resources, she thrilled with pride to see Justin's offering fall in the plate.  Justin was too absorbed in his own thoughts to notice anything, but his munificent contribution had a most unexpected effect upon his reputation, after all; for on that day, and on many another later one, when his sudden marriage and departure with Nancy Wentworth were under discussion, the neighbours said to one another:--  \"Justin must be making money fast out West!  He put ten dollars in the contribution plate a-Sunday, and paid the minister ten more next day for marryin' him to Nancy; so the Peabody luck has turned at last!\" which, as a matter of fact, it had.  \"And all the time,\" said the chairman of the carpet committee to the treasurer of the Dorcas Society--\"all the time, little as she realized it, Nancy was laying the carpet in her own pew.  Now she's married to Justin she'll be the makin' of him, or I miss my guess.  You can't do a thing with men folks without they're right alongside where you can keep your eye and hand on 'em.  Justin's handsome and good and stiddy; all he need is some nice woman to put starch into him.  The Edgewood Peabodys never had a mite o' stiffenin' in 'em,--limp as dishrags, every blessed one!  Nancy Wentworth fairly rustles with starch.  Justin hadn't been engaged to her but a few hours when they walked up the aisle together, but did you notice the way he carried his head?  I declare I thought 't would fall off behind!  I shouldn't wonder a mite but they prospered and come back every summer to set in the old Peabody Pew.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19025"],["title","A Sweet Little Maid (#0)"],["body","[Illustration]  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  A SWEET LITTLE MAID  BY AMY E.

You make such a lovely Indian, just like a real one. I am almost afraid of you when you are painted up, and have feathers in your head.\"  Bubbles grinned at the compliment.  \"I will be the white maiden to be captured,\" said Dimple, as Bubbles coolly proceeded to take off her frock, displaying a red flannel petticoat.  \"I'll hunt up the feathers, and you get ready,\" Dimple went on. \"And the shawl--we must have the striped shawl for a blanket,\" and, running into the house, she soon came out with a little striped shawl, and a handful of stiff feathers. The shawl was arranged over Bubbles' shoulders, and produced a fine effect, when the feathers were stuck in her head.  \"Now if you could only have the hatchet. You go get it, Bubbles.\"  \"I dassent,\" said Bubbles.  \"Oh yes, you dare,\" Dimple said, coaxingly. \"I'd go ask mamma, but it is so hot and I've been in the house once.\"  \"'Deed, Miss Dimple\"--Bubbles began.  \"Don't you 'deed me. I tell you to go and I mean it. I'll send you to the orphan asylum, if you don't, and I wonder how you will like that; no more cakes, no more chicken and corn-bread for you, Miss Bubbles. Mush and milk, miss.\"  This dreadful threat had its desired effect, and Bubbles' bare black legs went scudding through the grass, and were back in a twinkling.  \"Hyah it is,\" she said. \"I was skeered, sho' 'nough.\"  \"Oh well, you are a goose,\" said Dimple. \"Who ever heard of an Indian being scared at a hatchet? Now I will go into the woodshed--that is my house, you know--and you must skulk softly along, and when you get to the door bang it open with the hatchet, and give a whoop.\"  So Dimple went in her house and shut the door, fearfully peeping through the cracks once in a while, as the terrible foe crept softly nearer and nearer, then with a terrific yell burst in.  \"Please, Mr. Indian, don't scalp me.\"  \"Ugh!\" said the Indian.  \"What shall I do?\" said Dimple. \"Make me take off my stockings and shoes, Bubbles. You know the captives must go barefooted.\"  \"Ugh!\" said the Indian, pointing to Dimple's feet.  \"My shoes and stockings? Well, I will give them to you,\" and she quickly took them off. The Indian gravely tied them around his neck, and taking Dimple by the hand he led her forth in triumph.  But here a disaster followed, for the captive, thinking it her duty to struggle, knocked the hatchet out of the Indian's hand, and it fell with its edge on Dimple's little white foot, making a bad gash.  \"Oh, you've killed me, sure enough,\" she cried. \"Oh, you wicked, wicked thing!\"  Poor Bubbles cried quite as hard as she, and begged not to be sent to the orphan asylum.  \"Oh! your mother will whip me,\" she cried. \"I 'spect I ought to be killed, but 'deed I didn't mean to, Miss Dimple; I wisht it had been my old black foot.\"  \"I wish it had,\" sobbed Dimple. \"Oh, I am bleeding all to nothing! Take me to mamma, Bubbles!\"  Bubbles stooped down and, being a little larger and stronger, managed to carry her to the house.  Dimple's mamma was horrified when they appeared at her door. Bubbles in war-paint and feathers, carrying the little barefooted girl, from whose foot blood was dropping on the floor.  \"What on earth is the matter? Oh, Dimple! Oh, Bubbles! What have you been doing?\"  But Bubbles was so overcome by terror, and Dimples by the sight of the blood, that neither could explain till the foot was washed and bandaged.  Then poor Bubbles flung herself on the floor and begged not to be sent to the orphan asylum.  \"You ridiculous child,\" said Dimple's mamma. \"Of course you ought to be careful, but it is not your fault any more than Dimple's. She should not have sent you for the hatchet. I am very sorry for my little Dimple; it is not so very serious, but she will not be able to walk for several days. Next time you want to play Indian, do without a hatchet. Put on your frock, Bubbles, and go into the kitchen, for I'm sure I heard Sylvy call you.\"  Bubbles went meekly out and Dimple was soon asleep on the sofa.  Bubbles' real name was Barbara. She was the child of a former servant who went away, leaving her, when she was about five years old, with Mrs. Dallas; as the mother never came back, and no one could tell of her whereabouts, Bubbles gradually became a fixture in Dimple's home.  Dimple, when she was just beginning to talk, tried hard to say Barbara, but got no nearer to it than Bubbles, and Bubbles the little darkey was always called.  Dimple herself was called so from the deep dimple in one cheek. Every one knew her by her pet name, and most persons forgot that her name ever was Eleanor.  She and Bubbles were devoted comrades. Bubbles would cheerfully have let Dimple walk over her and never forgot to call her _Miss_ Dimple, thereby expressing her willingness to serve her.  Dimple was the dearest little girl in the world, but considering Bubbles her special property, made her do pretty much as she pleased, and her most dreadful threat was to send her to the orphan asylum.  She had once said, \"Mamma, if you hadn't let Bubbles stay here, where would you have sent her?\"  \"To the orphan asylum, I suppose,\" her mamma answered; and Bubbles, hearing it, was ever after in mortal terror of the place, for Dimple gave her a graphic description of it, telling her she would never have anything to eat but mush and milk.  Dimple's foot did not get well as fast as she expected, and the little girl found it rather tiresome to lie on a lounge all day, although her mamma read to her, and tried to amuse her. Bubbles, too, was as obedient a nurse as could be, and, because she had been the cause of the accident, considered it her first and only duty to wait on Dimple.  \"Mamma,\" said Dimple, \"for a colored girl, Bubbles is the nicest I ever saw; but indeed, I should like a white girl to play with, just for a change. Couldn't you get me one?\"  \"Perhaps so,\" said her mamma. \"We will see what can be done.\"  \"Good-bye, little girl,\" said her papa the next morning. \"I am going away and will not be back till to-morrow. What shall I bring you? A new doll?\"  \"Oh, please, papa; and papa a white girl if you can get one that is real nice, something the same kind of girl that I am.\"  \"A girl like you would be hard to find, I think,\" said he, laughing, \"but I'll inquire around and see if there is one to be had.\"  Bubbles looked very sober all day, and rolled her eyes around at Dimple in such a reproachful way that finally she said:  \"I know just what you think, Bubbles. You believe I am going to send you to the orphan asylum and get a white girl, but I am not at all. If I get a white girl I shall want you all the same, because you will have to wait on her too.\"  Bubbles' face lighted up, as she said,  \"'Deed, cross my heart, Miss Dimple, I didn't fo' sure think yuh was gwine to send me off, but I tuck and thought yuh was conjurin' up somethin' agin me.\"  \"Why, Bubbles, I wouldn't do such a thing, unless you were out and out bad. It has been such a long day,\" she said, turning to her mamma. \"When will it be to-morrow?\"  Mrs. Dallas drew up a little table, and Bubbles brought Dimple's best set of dishes, and with a clean cloth spread on first, the dishes were arranged. Then Bubbles brought in a little dish of chicken, a glass of jelly, light rolls, little cakes, a pitcher of milk, tea, sugar, and butter; and then Mrs. Dallas said,  \"We will have our supper together, because papa is away, and Bubbles can wait on us here.\"  Bubbles had disappeared, but presently came back with a bunch of roses, which she put in the middle of the table.  \"Why, Bubbles, that is quite fine,\" said Dimple, and she ate her supper with a relish; after which, the time seemed very short until to-morrow, for she was soon asleep.  \"I believe this day is long too,\" she said, toward the afternoon of the next day. \"When will papa come?\"  \"Not till"]]]
