He was astonished at the brazen assurance of the other, for he had always seemed to him to be a fairly modest young man. Corny extended his hand to Christy, and it was accepted.  \"I am very glad to see you, Corny,\" said he of the South, \"and not the less glad because the meeting is so unexpected.\"  \"It is certainly very unexpected on my part, Corny,\" replied Christy, who began to comprehend the object of his cousin; but there was something so ludicrous in the situation that he was more disposed to laugh than to look upon it seriously.  \"I am very glad to see you, Corny,\" continued he who bore that name in reality. \"I did not expect to find you on board of the Vernon. How are uncle Homer, aunt Lydia, and Gerty?\"  \"I have not seen _my_ uncle Homer for several months; but I had not the remotest idea that you had an uncle Homer,\" replied Christy, laughing heartily, for the situation seemed so amusing to him that the serious part of his cousin's obvious plan had so far hardly dawned upon him. \"I should like to inquire of you, as one good turn deserves another, in regard to the health of your father and mother and Gerty.\"  \"My father is quite well, but he left Bonnydale last Tuesday to go to Washington, and had not returned when I left home. My mother is quite well, and so is Florry,\" replied the sick officer, who did not appear to be suffering from a very severe headache just then, for he was quite cheerful and animated.  \"This appears to be a family party,\" interposed Captain Battleton, who was very much amused to hear each of the young officers call the other by the same name, and both of them appeared to be Corny Passford.  \"It is a family party, captain,\" replied the sick officer, smiling as cheerfully as though he had never had any practical knowledge of headache and pains in the bones, which was the description of his malady given to the surgeon. \"As I have hinted before, my cousin Corny is a rebel of the first order; and you can imagine my astonishment at finding him in the uniform of a lieutenant on board a United States naval vessel.\"  \"Good, Corny!\" exclaimed Christy, dropping upon the divan of the cabin and laughing heartily.  \"I can easily imagine your astonishment, Mr. Passford, for it seems to me to be a very remarkable state of things,\" added the captain, as he looked from one to the other of the claimants. \"One thing seems to be admitted by both of you, that you are both Passfords, and that you are cousins.\"  \"So far we do not disagree by the breadth of a hair. My cousin Corny was _raised_ in the South, while I was raised in the North,\" continued the sick passenger.  \"I don't like to contradict my cousin, but I was _brought up_ in the North,\" said Christy, hoping Captain Battleton would notice the difference in the phraseology.  \"Then you were both brought up in the North,\" suggested the captain.  \"Not at all, for, as I said, my cousin Corny was brought up in the South, at Glenfield, near Mobile,\" protested the ailing officer, who was careful this time not to use the word \"raised.\"  \"Where were you yesterday, Corny?\" asked Christy, suddenly suppressing his mirth.  \"I was in New York, preparing to come on board of the Vernon.\"  \"Then you were not at Bonnydale?\" demanded Christy sharply.  \"Of course I was there; but it was a pretty day, and I went to the city to attend to some affairs of mine,\" replied the sick man, with the first signs of embarrassment he had exhibited.  \"In spite of the fact that it was a pretty day, I should think you would have spent your last day on shore with your mother and sister as I did,\" replied Christy.  \"I was sick, and I wished to be as near the Vernon as possible. I felt better in the afternoon and attended to my affairs; but I got bad again in the afternoon, and I came on board in the evening, for I was afraid I should not be able to do so in the morning,\" answered the invalid, becoming as lively as before.  \"Gentlemen, this seems to be a strange muddle,\" said the captain, who was not disposed to listen any longer to the sparring between the cousins. \"At the suggestion of the lieutenant who came on board this forenoon, I have taken the earliest opportunity to settle the question as to which is the original and genuine Mr. Passford who was ordered on board of the Vernon as a passenger for the Gulf, and who, I am informed, is appointed to the command of the Bronx. I have not much time to spare, and if you do not object, I shall call in the first lieutenant and the surgeon to take part in this conference. I am perplexed, and I desire witnesses if not assistants in these proceedings.\"  \"I have not the slightest objection to the presence of as many officers as you may choose to call in,\" added the invalid.  \"I shall be equally reasonable,\" said Christy. \"The more witnesses there are the better it will suit me.\"  Captain Battleton struck a bell on his table, and sent the steward who answered it to procure the attendance of the officers indicated, and they soon presented themselves.  \"Gentlemen, Lieutenant Salisbury, the executive officer of the Vernon,\" said the captain. \"Both of these gentlemen are Lieutenant Christopher Passford,\" he added, with a twinkle of the eye. \"Dr. Connelly, you have both met.\"  \"Are we to understand that one of these officers is the double of the other?\" asked the first lieutenant, who seemed to be disposed to take in the situation as a pleasantry of the commander.  \"Hardly; both of them claim to be the same officer, and I have invited you to assist me in deciding which is the real Mr. Passford.\"  The entire party then seated themselves at the table.     CHAPTER VI  THE CONFERENCE IN THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN   Captain Horatio Passford lived at Bonnydale on the Hudson. He was rich in several millions of dollars, but he was richer in the possession of a noble character, one of the most prominent traits of which was his patriotism. He had presented his large and fast-sailing steam yacht to the government of the nation at the beginning of the struggle. His motto was, \"Stand by the Union,\" and from the first he had done everything in his power to sustain his country against the assaults of dissolution.    [Illustration: The Conference in the Captain's Cabin.--Page 70.]  He had a wife, a daughter, and a son, and his family were as patriotic as he was himself. At sixteen Christy, the son, had gone into the navy. He had learned to be a sailor and an engineer in his repeated cruises in the Bellevite, his father's large steam yacht, now a man-of-war in the navy. In two years the young man had worked his way up to the rank of lieutenant. He was very large for his age, and his nautical and mechanical education had prepared him for service to a degree which made him almost a prodigy, though his courage and skill had been fully equalled, if not surpassed, by other naval officers not older than himself.  Homer Passford, the only brother of his father, had early in life settled in Alabama, and become a planter, where he had made a respectable fortune, though he was a poor man compared with the northern brother. He had a wife, a son, and a daughter. At the beginning of the war of the Rebellion he had promptly espoused the cause of the South, and from his point of view, he was fully as patriotic as his brother on the other side. He was ready to give himself, his son, and his fortune to the independence of the South. His character was quite as noble as that of his brother, and he had done all he could in person and with his wealth to insure the success of the Southern cause.  His son Cornelius followed the lead of his father, and was faithful to the teachings given him in his southern home. He had enlisted as a soldier; but when it was found that he could be more serviceable to the Confederacy in certain irregular enterprizes, he was detached for this service. He had been engaged in an attempt to capture the Bellevite in connection with older and more skilful persons. The plan had failed, Corny had been severely wounded, and while on parole had lived at Bonnydale. From there he had been sent to a military prison, and had been exchanged. From that time, Christy knew nothing about him until he met him on board of the Vernon.  Corny was two years older than Christy; but the latter looked even more mature than the former. The resemblance between them had hardly been noticed by the two families, though Christy had spent several months at different times at the plantation of his uncle. But the resemblance was noted and often spoken of by persons outside of the families, the members of which, being in the habit of seeing them often together, did not notice the similarity of features and expression. Both of them resembled their fathers, who were often mistaken the one for the other in their early years.  After he found that the sick officer was his cousin Corny Passford, Christy began to apprehend the object of his southern relative in presenting himself as the bearer of his name and rank in the navy, though he had no time to consider the subject. Corny had given him no opportunity to look the matter over, for he had talked most of the time as opportunity was presented.  Captain Battleton seated himself in the armchair which Corny had abandoned, and placed a quire of paper before him as though he intended to take notes of the proceedings. Christy was not at all disturbed by the formal aspect the affair was assuming, for he felt entirely confident that poor Corny would be a prisoner of war at its conclusion. He had his commission and his orders in his pocket, and he was positive that they would vindicate him.  \"I reported to the department that I had only a single vacant stateroom in the ward room of the Vernon, and I was ordered to receive Lieutenant Christopher Passford as a passenger, as I could not take another officer,\" said the captain. \"It is not a serious question compared with others at issue, but the occupation of the single room, now in possession of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18816"],["title","Stand By The Union (#7)"],["body","who came on board last evening, depends upon the result of our present inquiry.\"  \"I should say there would be no difficulty in settling this question,\" said Mr. Salisbury.  \"These gentlemen are cousins, and both of them bear the name of Passford,\" added the captain, as he raised his finger, pointing to Corny. \"Will you give us your name in full, if you please?\"  \"Christopher Passford,\" replied the invalid officer, with the most unblushing effrontery.  \"Your father's name?\"  \"Horatio Passford.\"  \"Where does he live?\"  \"At Bonnydale, on the Hudson,\" replied Corny confidently.  \"Excuse me, Captain Battleton; may I ask a question?\" interposed the first lieutenant.  \"Certainly, Mr. Salisbury. This is not a court-martial, but an informal investigation, and I shall be glad to have you and Dr. Connelly entirely free to ask any questions you please,\" replied the captain, who was anything but a martinet.  \"Where did you say your father lived, Mr. Passford?\" asked the executive officer.  \"At Bonnydale, on the Hudson,\" answered Corny, as we may call him now that the reader knows who he is.  \"Is Bonnydale the name of the town or city in which your father lives?\"  \"It is the name of my father's place,\" replied Corny; and Christy, who was observing him very closely, saw that he was a little disturbed.  \"Bonnydale sounds like a fancy name, such as any gentleman might give to his estate, as Sunnyside was the home of Washington Irving. Is this the fact?\" asked Mr. Salisbury.  \"I suppose it is,\" answered Corny, with increasing confusion.  \"Don't you know?\"  \"We always called it Bonnydale; and I know no other name for it.\"  \"But Bonnydale is not an incorporated town. In what city or town is your father's place situated?\"  \"I know no name but Bonnydale,\" replied Corny; and the flush of fever or something else was on his cheeks now.  \"Nothing more, captain,\" said the first lieutenant; and the stock of the other claimant mounted a little.  \"Mr. Passford,\" continued the captain, indicating Christy with his finger, \"your father's name, if you please.\"  \"Horatio Passford,\" replied Christy with a smile.  \"Where does he live?\"  \"At Bonnydale, on the Hudson.\"  \"Permit me, Captain Battleton,\" interposed Mr. Salisbury; and the commander nodded his acquiescence. \"Is Bonnydale the name of the town or city in which your father lives, Mr. Passford?\"  \"It is the name of my father's place,\" answered Christy, using the same words that Corny had.  \"Bonnydale sounds like a fancy name, such as any gentleman might give to his estate,\" continued Mr. Salisbury, smiling, as he repeated the phrases he had used before. \"Is this the fact?\"  \"It is; the name was given to the estate by my mother,\" replied Christy, unable to follow Corny any farther.  \"In what town or city is your father's estate situated?\"  \"It is within the limits of the town of Montgomery.\"  \"Nothing further, captain,\" said the executive officer; and the stock of this particular Lieutenant Passford mounted another trifle.  \"Your cousin, who, according to your statement, was raised in the South, seems to be better informed in regard to the geography of Bonnydale than you do,\" added Captain Battleton.  \"He is always inquiring into things that I don't care a straw about,\" replied Corny, vexed that he had been tripped up in a matter so simple.  The commander was disposed to carry the investigation a little farther in the same direction, and he sent Christy into the ward room, where he was instructed to remain until he was sent for. Captain Passford, senior, was well known to all the officers present by reputation, and he had assisted Dr. Connelly in procuring his appointment, so that the latter had had occasion to visit Bonnydale three times.  The captain asked Corny a hundred questions in regard to the estate, making memoranda of his answers. Once he suggested to the surgeon that he had better examine the pulse of his patient, for he did not wish to overtask him in the investigation. The subject of the inquiry declared that his headache had almost disappeared, and he needed no indulgence on account of his health.  After half an hour of questioning, Corny was sent to the ward room, and Christy was called to the captain's cabin. About the same questions were put to him as to his cousin; but both of them were prompt in their answers. In the last two years, Corny had been more at Bonnydale than Christy, and he was quite as much at home there, so that there was no reason why he should not be able to describe the mansion and its surroundings as accurately as the genuine Lieutenant Passford.  So far, Corny, with the single exception of his failure to give the geography of the estate, stood quite as well as his cousin. Then the first lieutenant questioned them both, as they were seated at the table, in a very general way. In their answers, Corny used the word \"raised,\" while Christy was \"brought up.\" Several phrases in more common use at the South than at the North were noted in his answers, which did not appear in the diction of Christy.  When the questioning was finished, the leaning of the trio of officers was in favor of Christy; but not one of them said anything in the presence of the two Passfords. The captain declared that he had already used up too much time in the inquiry, and he must close the conference very soon. Then he asked if either of the gentlemen had any papers they wished to present in support of his identity.  \"I have my commission as a lieutenant, and my orders to take passage in the Vernon, and to take command of the Bronx on my arrival at the station of the Eastern Gulf squadron,\" said Corny, as he pulled a huge envelope from his breast pocket; and Christy could not but notice the perfect confidence with which he spoke.  \"I have precisely the same papers,\" added Christy, with as much assurance as his cousin.  \"I had nearly forgotten the most important evidence that can be presented in this matter,\" said the captain with a smile. \"I dare say that each of the gentlemen will produce his commission, his orders, and his appointment to the command of the Bronx; and I don't know how we can decide between the papers. It looks as though the Bronx was likely to have two commanders.\"  \"Here are my papers, captain,\" added Corny, as he passed his envelope across the table to the commander.  \"This is not an official envelope,\" said the captain, as he took the package, and then fixed his gaze on the owner of the documents.  \"No, sir; it is not. I had the misfortune to leave it on the table at Bonnydale, and Walsh, the man-servant, supposing it to be of no value, threw it into the fire,\" replied Corny promptly.  The commission and other papers were all right in every respect. Christy handed his envelope to the commander, and he broke it open. It contained nothing but a lot of blank paper.     CHAPTER VII  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE DECISION   When Captain Battleton took from the envelope the blank papers, no one seemed to be inquisitive as to the result, for, as the commander had suggested, they all expected to find the commission and other papers regularly and properly made out and signed. Several sheets were unfolded and spread out upon the table, and Christy was hardly more surprised than the others at the table.  \"Your papers do not seem to be altogether regular, Mr. Passford,\" said the captain, as he held up one of them so that all could see it.  \"I see they are not,\" answered Christy blankly.  \"But they are enclosed in an official envelope,\" added the captain, as he held up the cover of the papers. \"In this respect they have the advantage of those presented by the other gentleman. You appear to be as much surprised as any of the rest of us, Mr. Passford. Can you explain the fact that you present nothing but blank papers instead of your commission and orders?\"  \"At present I cannot; after I have had an opportunity for reflection I may be able to do so,\" replied Christy, from whom a more decided demonstration than he made was expected.  \"It is evident from what we have heard, and from the documents submitted to me that one of these gentlemen is Lieutenant Christopher Passford,\" said Captain Battleton; \"but we have no means of identifying the officer. In what vessels have you served, Mr. Passford?\"  \"My first service was in the Bellevite, and my last in the Bronx, of which I was acting commander on her voyage from New York to the Gulf,\" answered Christy, to whom the question was addressed.  \"Is there any officer on board with whom you have served?\"  \"So far as I have seen, there is not.\"  \"Any seaman?\"  \"I have not noticed any seaman whose face was familiar to me.\"  \"If I am correctly informed, you came home as prize master of the Vixen, convoying quite a fleet of steamers and schooners,\" continued Captain Battleton, looking about the cabin as though the inquiry had become wearisome to him.  \"I did; you were correctly informed,\" answered Corny, as the wandering gaze of the commander rested upon him.  \"Both of you were in command of the Vixen, I suppose,\" added the captain with a smile.  \"I was, captain; but I cannot speak for my cousin Corny,\" replied the possessor of the commission.  \"I can say with entire confidence that I was in command of the Vixen,\" added Christy.  \"A considerable number of officers and seamen must have come with you in the Vixen and the other vessels,\" said the captain, raising his finger to indicate that the question was addressed to Christy.  \"Yes, sir; the Vixen was fully armed and manned to protect the fleet of prize vessels she convoyed.\"  \"Do you remember the names of the officers who served with you in the Vixen?\" asked the captain.  \"I could not very well forget them in so short a time,\" replied Corny, upon whom the gaze of the commander had again rested as he looked about him.  \"Very well; perhaps you had better answer the question;\" and the captain pointed at Corny. \"Who was your first lieutenant?\"  \"Ensign Gordon Fillbrook,\" replied Corny promptly.
