Well, then, I will tell you about their rings.  You can see the rings of the grasshopper people very plainly in their abdomens.  [Illustration]  Here is a picture of a grasshopper. It is not all drawn. The legs and wings are not shown, and the abdomen is drawn by itself so you can see it easily.  There are ten rings, you see.  The rings are covered with a hard, horny substance.  This horny substance is what makes the body of the insect so stiff. It would be soft but for the chitin, as the horny substance is called.  It is better for the insect to have a chitinous covering.  If you had no bones, you would be glad to have your skin hardened with chitin.  You see how it is, you wear your skeleton inside. Your skeleton is of bones; it is an inside skeleton.  The grasshoppers and all the insects wear their skeleton outside. It is made of chitin; it is an outside skeleton.  Insects have no bones.  They do not need any. They are kept stiff by the chitin.  Each ring in the insect's abdomen is made of four pieces, the back piece, the side pieces, and the under piece. You can see the back piece and one side piece in the picture, but you cannot see the other side piece nor the under piece without turning the insect over.  The rings are made in pieces so the insect can move.  Suppose each ring were made of one stiff piece like a finger ring. What a poor stiff, old grasshopper it would be! The rings are called segments.  Segment number one has only a back piece, you see.  All the other segments have four pieces.  Segments two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight are alike.  Segments nine and ten are modified to form the ovipositor.  The segments are fastened together by skin. The skin is soft so the segments can move back and forth.  The segments can be crowded close together to shorten the abdomen.  The segments can be separated from each other to lengthen the abdomen.  There is no chitin in the skin between the segments. It is soft so the segments can move.  Do you know how a telescope is made?  The abdomen of the insect can lengthen and shorten somewhat like a telescope.  It is easy to see the rings in the abdomen of the locust or grasshopper.  Now, what about the thorax?  That, you tell me, has no rings.  [Illustration]  Look again, and look carefully.  You will have to see another picture.  This is a picture of the head and thorax of the grasshopper. It is drawn to show the separate parts of the thorax.  Yes, John, the thorax has three segments. They are grown so close together you would not suspect it until you looked very close.  The front legs are fastened to the first segment.  What is fastened to the middle segment?  Yes, May, the middle pair of legs and the wing covers.  Mollie says the long hind legs and the flying wings are fastened to the third or hind segment.  Oh, you funny little folks! you are all made up of rings.  Yes, indeed, little Nell, the segments of the thorax are made of chitin; they are very stiff.  Ned thinks the segments of the legs are made of chitin too.  Their outside shell certainly is.  The whole outer shell of the insect is made of the horny chitin.  You hard little chitin-covered, segmented people, you are very different from us.  Ah! yes, May, they are like us in many ways.  Indeed, Mollie, insects do have brains.  They have muscles, too, to move their little bodies with.  We have muscles under our skin, you know. The muscles move our arms and legs and bodies.  If you clasp your fingers around your arm and then move your arm, you can feel the muscles.  The insects have muscles inside their chitinous shells. The muscles move their bodies.  The muscles are very, very strong.  They are stronger for their size than the muscles of a horse.  John, do you know how heavy a load a horse can pull?  Well, it cannot pull a load equal to the weight of its own body.  Now, listen to this,--almost any insect can pull a load that is five times the weight of its body!  Ah, yes, some insects can pull a much heavier weight than that. The honey bee, for instance, can pull a load twenty times as heavy as its body.  And think how our little insect friends can jump! Why, a kangaroo cannot begin to jump like a grasshopper.  No, indeed, Ned, the finest jumper in the world of men cannot begin to jump as well as a grasshopper, not even with the aid of a spring board. He is a mere baby in comparison.  Ah, yes, we can do a great many things better than the grasshoppers, but, you see, they can do some things better than we can.  What is that, John?  You want to know about the mouth parts of the grasshopper?  Suppose we leave the mouth parts.  They are difficult to understand. We have had a good many new names to learn lately.  What, May? You can't remember such hard words?  Oh, yes, of course you can.  You don't mind learning \"rhinoceros,\" and \"Mississippi,\" and \"Popocatepetl,\" and \"eenie, meenie, monie mike,\" and they are quite as hard as femur and tibia; and, besides, you have a femur yourself! Did you know it?  Your thigh bone, like the grasshopper's thigh, is called a femur.  Yes, Mollie, there is a bone in your leg called the tibia, and you have a tarsus in your foot.  So, after all, when you are learning hard words about insects you are learning a great deal besides, as you will find.  [Illustration]     PRETTY KATYDIDS  [Illustration]   Katy did!  Katy didn't!  Katy did!  Well, well, did she or didn't she, and what of it anyway.  Come here, Katy did and Katy didn't, the children want to see you.  She's a pretty little Did and Didn't, isn't she.  Katy, why do you not know your own mind and always tell the same story?  Krick--krick--krick, there, she is talking; that's her way of saying \"Katy did.\"  Krick--krick--krickkrick. Now she has said \"Katy didn't.\"  Well, we never shall know anything more about it.  No, little Nell, she doesn't really say Katy did or Katy didn't, but it sounds like that, and we make believe she says it.  John says he is sure the katydids are first cousins to the grasshoppers and locusts, and so they are.  They are very closely related to--which division of locusts, do you think?  Oh, yes, the longhorned, of course.  See their long, long antennæ, and the male has the same little musical places on his wings, little membranes that vibrate and make his song of Katy did and Katy didn't.  [Illustration]  No, the little lady katydid cannot sing--only the little male, and he keeps it up all night long.  We sometimes wish he would get tired or sleepy and stop, but he never does.  Why do you suppose he likes to sing so well in the night?  The katydids generally live on trees and bushes.  Yes, they are a beautiful, pale green people, and that is one reason we do not often see them. It is not easy to find a katydid among the green leaves.  The female katydids have a long sword-shaped ovipositor with which they roughen the bark on twigs, and place the eggs there, fastening them with a gummy substance.  The egg is glued fast so it will not fall off.  It hatches into a little dot of a katydid that has no wings, but, like the larvæ of the other insects we know about, it eats and grows and moults, and at last its wings and the rest of its body are full grown.  It casts its skin for the last time; it is no longer a larva, but a full-grown insect.  Yes, May, we call the young of all insects larvæ.  [Illustration]  See this dainty katydid that Charlie has caught for us.  How pretty it is!  Its feelers are like long green threads.  And how sensitive they are!  It quickly starts away when we touch one of the feelers.  Yes, Mollie, the katydid walks more than the grasshopper.  It can jump well with those long, slender hind legs. How beautiful its hind legs are! They are longer and more delicate than those of the grasshopper.  And its wings, how gauzy and dainty! Its wing covers are not so stiff as those of the grasshopper. They look almost like flying wings, they are so delicate.  See, they open, and fasten themselves open, like the wing covers of the grasshopper; and when they are at rest they overlap like the wings of the grasshopper.  The inner wings are like fine lace.  They look too delicate for use, and yet the katydid flies very well indeed with them.  They are a little longer than the wing covers.  [Illustration]  When the katydid is at rest you can see the tips of the wings extending beyond the ends of the wing covers.  The part of the inner wing that extends beyond the wing covers is green, like the wing covers, you see.  But the rest of the inner wing is not green, it is like very thin glass, or like fine isinglass.  Look for a moment at the long curved ovipositor of the female katydid.  If you look sharp, you will see teeth on it like a little saw. It is with these teeth the little katydid is able to rasp the surface of the twigs, and make a place to fasten her eggs to.  Her wings are wrapped about her form like an ample cloak of green.  [Illustration]  Now, my little katydid, you may fly away if you want to.  We are very much obliged to you for letting us look at you, and we hope we have not troubled you too much.  See her go!  How prettily the katydids fly.  They seem almost like little birds.  I am sure they love to fly about in the bright summer-time.  Happy katydids.     THE CRICKET-LIKE GRASSHOPPERS  [Illustration]   Now what strange-looking little creature are you?  John says it looks like a grasshopper, only it has no wings and its body is not that of a grasshopper.  May says it looks like a cricket, only it has the long legs of a grasshopper.  It is called the cricket-like grasshopper, and it is partly like a cricket, as you see, and partly like a grasshopper.  It is a funny little fellow that lives around in dark corners, usually in the woods.  Do see those long, spiny legs!  [Illustration]  How he _can_ jump.  He has strong, short, sharp spines on the femurs and on the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18794"],["title","Three Years' War (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

R. de Wet     New York Charles Scribner's Sons 1902 Copyright, 1902, by Charles Scribner's Sons All rights reserved Published, December, 1902 Trow Directory Printing and Bookbinding Company New York           TO MY FELLOW SUBJECTS       OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE     Preface   By way of introduction to my work I wish, dear reader, to say only this short word: \"I am no book-writer.\"--But I felt that the story of this struggle, in which a small people fought for liberty and right, is rightly said, throughout the civilized world, to be unknown, and that it was my duty to record my personal experiences in this war, for the present and for the future generations, not only for the Afrikander people, but for the whole world.  Not only did I consider this my duty, but I was encouraged to write by the urgings of prominent men among my people, of men of various nationalities and even of several British officers.  Well, dear reader, I hope that you will not feel disappointed in reading these experiences, as it is not in me, as is perhaps sometimes the case with historical authors, to conjure up thrilling pictures--imaginary things--and put them together merely to make up a book or to make a name for themselves. That be far from me! In publishing my book (although it is written in simple style) _I had one object only_, viz., to give to the world a story which, although it does not contain the whole of the truth, as regards this wondrous war, yet contains nothing but the truth.  The original has been written by me in Dutch, and I can therefore not be answerable for its translation into other languages.  C. R. DE WET.

Before proceeding any further I should like to explain that portion of the Commando Law which dealt with commandeering. It stipulated that every burgher between the ages of sixteen and sixty must be prepared to fight for his country at any moment; and that, if required for active service, he must provide himself with a riding-horse, saddle and bridle, with a rifle and thirty cartridges--or, if he were unable to obtain a rifle, he must bring with him thirty bullets, thirty caps, and half a pound of powder--in addition he must be provisioned for eight days. That there should have been an alternative to the rifle was due to the fact that the law was made at a time when only a few burghers possessed breech-loading rifles--_achterlaaiers_, as we call them.  With reference to the provisions the law did not specify their quality or quantity, but there was an unwritten but strictly observed rule amongst the burghers that they should consist of meat cut in strips, salted, peppered, and dried, or else of sausages and \"Boer biscuits.\"[1] With regard to quantity, each burgher had to make his own estimate of the amount he would require for eight days.  It was not long after they were notified to hold themselves ready that the burghers were called up for active service. On the 2nd of October, 1899, the order came. On that day the Veldtcornets, or their lieutenants, visited every farm and commandeered the men.  Amongst the commandeered was I; and thus, as a private burgher, I entered on the campaign. With me were my three sons--Kootie, Isaac, and Christiaan.  The following day the men of the sub-district of Krom Ellenborg, in the district of Heilbron--to which I belonged--mustered at Elandslaagte Farm. The Veldtcornet of this sub-district was Mr. Marthinus Els, and the Commandant of the whole contingent Mr. Lucas Steenekamp. It soon became known that the War Commission had decided that our commando was to proceed as rapidly as possible to the Natal frontier, and that with us were to go the troops from Vrede and Harrismith, as well as some from Bethlehem, Winburg, and Kroonstad. Carrying out these orders, we all arrived at Harrismith six days later.  Commando life now began in real earnest.  The eight days during which the burghers had to feed themselves were soon over, and now it was the duty of the Government to provide for them.  It may be interesting to mention here that the British commissariat differed greatly from ours. Rations were served out daily to their troops. Each soldier received the same quantity and the same quality as his comrade. Our methods were very different, except as regards flour, coffee, sugar, and other articles of that nature. The British soldier, for instance, received his meat ready cooked in the form of bully-beef (_blikkiescost_ we called it), whilst the burgher received his meat raw, and had to cook it as best he could.  Before I leave this subject I may be forgiven if I describe the method of distributing meat to the burghers. After it had been cut up, the Vleeschkorporaal[2] handed out the pieces--a sufficiently responsible task, as it proved, for, as the portions differed much in quality, it became of the first importance that the Vleeschkorporaal should be a man whose impartiality was above suspicion. To avoid any temptations to favouritism, this useful personage used to turn his back on the burghers, and as the men came up in turn he would pick up the piece of meat which lay nearest to hand and, without looking round, give it to the man who was waiting behind him to receive it.  This arrangement should have been satisfactory to all, but it sometimes happened that some burgher, whom fortune had not favoured, made no effort to conceal his discontent, and thus squabbles frequently occurred. Then the Vleeschkorporaal, fully convinced of his own uprightness, would let his tongue go, and the burgher who had complained was a man to be pitied. But such quarrels only occurred"]]]
