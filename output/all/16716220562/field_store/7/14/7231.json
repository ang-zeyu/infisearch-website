I was not aware of it. I came on board last night? I was not aware of that fact,\" said Christy.  The petty officer did not hear his remarks, for he had been called by the second lieutenant in the waist, and, with a touch of his cap, hastened away. The lieutenant opened his eyes very wide, as he looked down at the seams in the deck, and wondered whether he were asleep or awake. He had been quite sick, and he had come on board the night before! It was very strange that he was not at all aware of either of these facts. He felt reasonably confident that he had slept in his own chamber at Bonnydale the night before, and at that time he was certainly in a very robust state of health, however it might be at the present moment. Even now, he could not complain of anything more severe than an embryo cold in the head, which the medicine his mother had given him would probably reduce to a state of subjection in a day or two.  At first, he was disposed to be amused at the answers the quartermaster had given him, for it was evident to him then that he had been mistaken for another person. It looked as though some officer had come on board, and reported under his name, for he had not yet learned anything in regard to the gentleman who had appeared to be quite sick when he reported himself. It had the elements of another mystery in it. But the petty officer could easily have made an honest mistake; and this was the solution he accepted, without bothering his bewildered brain any further about it.  The commander appeared to be less occupied at this moment than he had been before, and Christy stepped forward to the quarter-deck, and politely saluted him. Captain Battleton was not less punctilious in his etiquette. He was a young man, though he was apparently six or seven years older than Christy. He was an ensign, and looked like a gentleman who was likely to give a good account of himself when he was called to more active duty than that of commanding a store ship.  \"Good-morning, Lieutenant Passford!\" said Captain Battleton, as he extended his hand to his passenger. \"I am glad to see that you are better.\"  Christy was utterly confounded at this salutation.     CHAPTER IV  THE SICK OFFICER IN THE STATEROOM   Captain Battleton spoke to Christy as though he had met him before, and needed no introduction. He was glad to see that the young officer was better, which indicated that he had been sick. He was confounded by the situation, for he had not been sick an hour, and he had never seen the commander of the Vernon in his life. The petty officer had told him that he appeared to be quite sick when he came on board the night before.  What he had learned within the last few moments was even more perplexing than the mysterious visitation at Bonnydale. Then the appearance of Walsh on board, and his denial of his identity, were still in his mind, and he wondered whether or not all these strange circumstances had any connection. But he was standing in the presence of the commander of the steamer, and he had no time to reach a conclusion of any kind, satisfactory or otherwise.  Christy took the offered hand of Captain Battleton, and looked earnestly into his face to determine whether he had ever seen him before; but the face was entirely new to him. He was quite confident that he had never seen the commander before. There was something rather ludicrous in the situation, and he felt as though he was taking part in a farce; at any rate, there was nothing serious or compromising in it, and in spite of the confusion in his mind, he could not help smiling.  \"I thank you, Captain Battleton, for your very kind interest in the state of my health, but with the exception of the first signs of a cold in the head, I never was better in my life,\" said Christy in reply to the salutation of the commander, still holding his hand.  \"Then you have improved wonderfully since last evening,\" added Captain Battleton.  \"I am glad to be informed of the fact, for I am not conscious of any such improvement as you describe. In fact, I am not in quite so good condition in a sanitary point of view as I was last evening, for I took my cold about midnight, or a little later, last night,\" added Christy, his smile becoming a little more pronounced.  It was now the turn of Captain Battleton to be puzzled, if not mystified, by the statement of his passenger, and he looked inquiringly into his face as if to ascertain if he was not the victim of a practical joke. But naval officers on duty are not given to pleasantries; and if he had any such suspicion, he banished it at once, for there was nothing in the appearance of the lieutenant to warrant it.  \"Pardon me, Mr. Passford, but were you not sick when you came on board of the Vernon last evening?\" asked the commander, with something like a frown upon his brow as the situation became more bewildering.  \"If you will excuse me for making an indirect reply, captain, I did not come on board of the Vernon last evening,\" answered Christy, his smile becoming still more decided; and if he had not been on the quarter-deck of a vessel in service, he might have suspected that he was himself the victim of a practical joke.  \"You did not come on board of the Vernon last evening!\" exclaimed Captain Battleton, gazing very earnestly into the face of his passenger.  \"I did not, captain,\" replied Christy quietly, though he was amused rather than disquieted by the earnestness of the commander.  \"You did not?\"  \"Certainly not; and if my simple affirmation is not enough, I could prove that I slept in my father's house at Bonnydale last night, took my breakfast there this morning, and was in the city of New York at ten o'clock this forenoon,\" answered Christy, in the best of humor.  \"This is very strange,\" said Captain Battleton, fixing his gaze upon the planks on which he stood, possibly considering whether he or his passenger was dreaming or out of his head.  \"If I were still at Brooklyn doubtless I could find the boatman who put me on board of the Vernon not more than an hour ago,\" continued Christy, willing to convince his auditor that he was entirely in earnest in his statement.  \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Passford, but I did not intend to question the truth of your reply to my question,\" said the commander, fearing that he had overstated his doubts. \"I am simply bewildered, confused, confounded by this interview.\"  \"So am I, captain,\" added the lieutenant, laughing outright at the perplexity in which both of them were involved. \"I have told you the simple truth in regard to my movements.\"  \"And you did not come on board of the Vernon last evening?\"  \"Emphatically I did not.\"  \"You were not sick last evening?\"  \"I was not; not even as sick as I am at this moment,\" replied Christy, using his handkerchief.  \"I don't understand it,\" said Captain Battleton, shaking his head.  \"Now, captain, will you permit me ask what you do not understand, for I assure you I am profoundly ignorant of the situation which perplexes you. I was ordered to be on board of the Vernon at one o'clock, and I found her under way at eleven. I happened to find a boatman before I left the ferry-boat, who put me on board, or I should have missed my passage. That is simply all I know about the matter.\"  \"When I called upon you in your stateroom this morning, you told me that\"--  \"I beg your pardon, Captain Battleton, but I have not been in any stateroom, sick or well, on board of the Vernon, and I respectfully suggest that it was quite impossible for you to have called upon me this morning, or at any other time,\" Christy interposed, very pleasantly, though quite as perplexed as the commander.  \"Of course I shall not raise an issue as to your veracity, Mr. Passford, but after the statement you have made to me, I must change the form of my phraseology,\" continued the commander, using a smile to cover any possible doubts or suspicions in his mind. \"When I called at the stateroom of the officer who reported on board last evening as Lieutenant Christopher Passford, he told me that I was expected to get under way and proceed to my destination as soon as the officer and the seamen were on board.\"  \"Did he bring you an order to this effect?\" asked Christy more seriously.  \"He did not, and perhaps I have made a mistake, though my superior officer told me at the yard that it would be safe for me to obey the verbal order,\" replied Captain Battleton, looking somewhat troubled.  \"I have no intention to meddle with what does not concern me, captain. It appears that Lieutenant Passford has already reported to you,\" said Christy; and this was the astounding fact to him of the situation.  He was absolutely confident that he was himself Lieutenant Christopher Passford, and as absolutely confident that the other officer could not be that person, whoever else he might be. The commander appeared to be considering what Christy had suggested to him in regard to his orders, and the passenger had a minute or two to think of the situation in which he found himself placed. But what was the use to think of it? He was at the end of a blind alley, where there was no light from any direction except that by which he had entered it. He had no premises from "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18816"],["title","Stand By The Union (#5)"],["body","to reason, and it was useless to consider the matter.  \"Mr. Passford, I find myself placed in a very unpleasant position,\" said the commander, after he had deliberated a few minutes. \"I have stated the facts to you; and the deduction I have to draw from them is, that I have two persons by the name of Lieutenant Passford on board.\"  \"That seems to me to be a correct deduction,\" added Christy.  \"The brilliant officer who bears this name is too well known to hide his light under a bushel. I have not the honor to be personally acquainted with him, and therefore I am unable to decide which of the gentlemen who report to me under that name is the real one.\"  \"Precisely so.\"  \"You will pardon me if I add that I think one or the other of them must be an impostor,\" added Captain Battleton with some diffidence.  \"That is a perfectly justifiable conclusion; and it rests with you to decide which is the genuine Lieutenant Passford, and which is the impostor,\" replied Christy frankly. \"You will be perfectly justified in calling upon both for all the evidence they are able to present. I suggest that each of them must carry his commission about him, as well as his orders from the department; and it seems to me that these documents will enable you to decide without any delay;\" and Christy involuntarily put his hand upon his breast pocket, where he carried these valuable papers.  He could feel the envelope that contained them, and he was satisfied of the triumph which awaited him when the evidence should be required of the two claimants of the name. At the same time he felt that he was moving in a cloud of mystery, which had begun to enfold him in the middle of the preceding night.  \"I thank you for the suggestion, Mr. Passford, and I must say that you seem to be entirely fair,\" said the commander.  \"If I am the impostor, I do not know myself; but I have no desire to forestall your decision. You saw the sick officer when he came on board last evening, and you have visited him in his stateroom to-day. Do I look enough like him to be taken for him?\" asked Christy with a smile, as he placed himself in an attitude to be scrutinized by the commander.  \"I am sure that you do, sir; and when I saw you on the quarter-deck for the first time, I had no doubt you were the officer who came on board sick last evening,\" replied Captain Battleton.  \"That makes it all the more remarkable, for I was not aware that there was any officer in the navy who resembled me so closely,\" added Christy more bewildered than before, and beginning to scent a plot of some kind against him or his country.  \"I must say that any man who will take upon himself the position and reputation of the real Lieutenant Passford is a bold man, and even, if he succeeds in taking his place, he will fail in playing the _rôle_.\"  \"I should thank you, Captain Battleton, for the compliment, if I were not under suspicion of being some other person. May I ask when it will be convenient for you to settle the question, for it is not pleasant for me to feel that I am looked upon as even a possible impostor?\"  \"I shall not regard you as an impostor, Mr. Passford, for I mean to be entirely impartial, and I shall not brand you even in thought until the evidence warrants me in doing so,\" replied the commander, as he called the surgeon who was just coming on deck. \"How do you find your patient, Dr. Connelly?\"  \"I find him--I thought I found him; but he appears to be on deck,\" replied the surgeon, as he fixed his gaze upon Christy, preluded by a start, dramatic enough to prove that he was astonished to find his patient was not in his room below. \"I left him not five minutes ago, for I have not yet been able to discover what ails him. He complained of a severe headache and pains in his bones; but he has not a particle of fever, or any symptom of anything that I can discover. I am glad to see you on deck, Mr. Passford. How is your headache?\"  \"If I have had any headache, I have entirely recovered from it,\" replied Christy, laughing heartily. \"I came on board only an hour ago, doctor, and I have had no headache, thank you.\"  \"Looking at you more closely, I see that you are not my patient, and you will excuse me for giving you a headache. But you resemble my patient very closely,\" added the doctor.  \"I did not answer your question, Mr. Passford,\" interposed Captain Battleton. \"In an hour we will settle the question.\"  Christy seated himself and began to consider the strange situation.     CHAPTER V  LIEUTENANT PASSFORD AND HIS APPARENT DOUBLE   The Vernon continued on her course, and in another hour the pilot had been discharged. Christy had puzzled his brains over the events of the day and the night before without being able to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. He was extremely anxious to see the officer who had taken his name and assumed his character, as he was to obtain all the information within his reach. His reflections assured him that some one had chosen the _rôle_ of an impostor for the purpose of accomplishing some treasonable object, and he was anxious to fathom the mystery for his country's sake rather than his own.  Captain Battleton would soon begin his investigation, and Christy was confident that the sick officer would be proved to be the impostor. He was not at all worried or even disturbed in regard to the result, for he felt that \"truth is mighty and must prevail.\" His only solicitude was to unravel the plot. Bands of Confederates had been put on board of several steamers for the purpose of capturing them; and it was possible that this plan had been adopted to obtain possession of the Vernon, for she was a good vessel, and was fitted out as a man-of-war.  It was plain enough to Christy that the remarkable attempt of one or the other of the officers on board as passengers to personate the other had been explained to those on the quarter-deck, for he observed that they all regarded him with curiosity, and were interested in the matter. As the surgeon passed near him he spoke to him.  \"Does your patient below seem to be improving, doctor?\" he asked.  \"He still complains that his head and his bones ache, so that I cannot say he is improving,\" replied Dr. Connelly.  \"How old a man does he appear to be?\"  \"I should take him for a young man of twenty or twenty-one, but he says he is only eighteen. He is a very young officer to be put in charge of a steamer, for I understand that he is ordered to the command of the Bronx. But then he has made a reputation as the commander of that vessel, which doubtless justifies his appointment.\"  \"Does he talk at all?\"  \"Oh, yes; he has told me about some of his exploits; and as he seems to forget his aches when he speaks of them, I have encouraged him to talk as much as possible.\"  \"Is he really sick, doctor?\" asked Christy, with a smile which meant something.  \"He says he is, and I have to take his word for it,\" replied the surgeon, with a corresponding smile.  \"I heard you tell the captain that you could not make out the nature of his malady.\"  \"I cannot so far, though that does not prove that he is not sick; but I will venture to say he could not get his discharge from the navy on his present symptoms. He may have drunk too much wine or whiskey recently, though he certainly was not in liquor when he came on board.\"  \"How is your patient, Dr. Connelly?\" asked Captain Battleton, joining them at this moment.  \"About the same the last time I saw him. He ate all the toast I sent to him, and seemed to enjoy it. I don't think he is in a dangerous condition,\" replied the surgeon.  \"I am glad to hear it. Have you informed him that we have another lieutenant on board of the Vernon?\" continued the commander.  \"No, captain: I have not. That is not my affair, and I don't meddle with what does not concern me.\"  \"An excellent rule. Is he aware of the fact that there is another Richmond in the field?\"  \"If he is, he has said nothing to me about the matter.\"  \"Do you think he could go out into the cabin, doctor?\" asked the captain. \"I wish to see him on a matter of the utmost importance. Is he dressed?\"  \"He is; he dressed himself this morning, and sits up part of the time.\"  \"Then you will oblige me by getting him into the cabin; I mean my cabin. I will be there in ten minutes.\"  The surgeon went below, leaving the commander and Christy together.  \"Can you make anything of this affair yet, Mr. Passford?\" asked Captain Battleton.  \"I can come to no conclusion in regard to it, though I may be able to do so when I have seen my double,\" replied Christy, whose curiosity in regard to the sick officer was strongly excited. \"It looks like a conspiracy of some kind, but I can go no farther in the direction of a solution.\"  The commander looked at his watch after they had conversed a little while longer, and then invited Christy to visit his cabin with him. The other Lieutenant Passford was seated in an arm-chair at the table. Christy looked at him with the deepest interest, but the back of the other was turned to him, and he did not get a full view of his face. The sick man was dressed in the naval uniform with the shoulder straps of a lieutenant.  \"I wish to introduce a gentleman to you; Lieutenant Passford, let me make you acquainted with Lieutenant Passford,\" said the commander as he led the way into the captain's cabin.  \"Thank you, Captain Battleton; I shall be very happy to make the acquaintance of Lieutenant Passford,\" said the occupant of the cabin, rising as he spoke, and approaching Christy. \"Corny Passford!\" exclaimed the sick officer. \"I did not expect to see you here. This gentleman is my own cousin, Captain Battleton, though I am sorry to say that he is a rebel; but for all that he is one of the finest fellows in the known world, and you will appreciate everything about him except his politics, which I do not admire myself.\"  Christy was not stunned or overwhelmed by this impudent speech. He looked at the speaker, and promptly recognized his"]]]
