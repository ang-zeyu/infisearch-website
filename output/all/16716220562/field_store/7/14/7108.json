The mists that hung over the ragged lines of the western horizon were no longer fogs that might conceal an army. They were the folds of a huge veil which Nature was softly drawing over the face of a beautiful bride. Why had he not seen this before?  The awful silence of the plains from which he had fled to books had suddenly become God's great whispering gallery. He listened with joyous awe and reverence.  The stars had been his guides by night to find the trail. He had merely lifted his eyes to make the reckoning. He had never seen before the crystal flash from their jeweled depths.  He looked into the eyes of the graceful young rider by his side and longed to tell her of this miracle wrought in his soul. But he hesitated. She was too dignified and self-possessed. It would be silly when put into words.  But the world to-day was too beautiful to hurry through it. He just couldn't.  \"Let's stop on this hill and watch the sunset, Miss Sarah?\" he suggested.  \"I'd love to,\" was the simple answer.  With a light laugh, she sprang from the saddle. They touched the ground at the same moment.  He looked at her with undisguised admiration.  \"You're a wonderful rider,\" he said.  \"A soldier's daughter must be--it's part of her life.\"  He tied their horses to the low hanging limbs of a cluster of scrub trees, and found a seat on the bowlders which the Indians had set for a landmark on the lonely hilltop.  Westward the plains stretched, a silent ocean of green, luscious grass.  \"What's that dark spot in the valley?\" the girl eagerly asked.  \"Watch it a moment--\"  They sat in silence for five minutes.  \"Why, it's moving!\" she cried.  \"Yes.\"  \"How curious--\"  \"An illusion?\" he suggested.  \"Nonsense, I'm not dreaming.\"  \"I've been dreaming a lot lately--\"  A smile played about the corners of her fine mouth. But she ignored the hint.  \"Tell me,\" she cried; \"you studied the sciences at West Point, what does it mean?\"  \"Look closely. Any fifteen-year-old boy of the plains could explain it.\"  \"Am I so ignorant?\" she laughed.  \"No,\" he answered soberly, \"our eyes just refuse to see things at which we are looking until the voice within reveals. The eyes of a hunter could make no mistake about such a spot--particularly if it moved.\"  \"It might be a passing cloud--\"  \"There's none in the sky.\"  \"Tell me!\" she pleaded.  \"A herd of buffalo.\"  \"That big black field! It must be ten acres--\"  The man laughed at her ignorance with a sudden longing in his heart to help and protect her.  \"Ten acres! Look again. They are twenty miles away. The herd is packed so densely, the ground is invisible. They cover a thousand acres.\"  \"Impossible--\"  \"I assure you, it's true. They were once even more plentiful. But we're pushing them back with the Indians into the sunset. And they, too, will fade away into the twilight at last--\"  He stopped suddenly. He had almost spoken a sentence that would have committed him beyond retreat. It was just on his lips to say:  \"I didn't take such tender views of Indians and buffaloes until I met you!\"  For the life of him he couldn't make the girl out. Her voice was music. Her laughter contagious. And yet she was reserved. About her personality hung a spell which forbade familiarity. Flirting was a pastime in the army. But it had never appealed to him. He was not so sure about her when she laughed.  And then her father worried him. The fiery old Southerner had the temper of the devil when roused. He could see that this second daughter was his favorite. He had caught a look of unreasonable anger and jealousy in his eye only that afternoon when they rode away together.  Still he must risk it. He had really suggested this sunset scene for that purpose. The field was his own choosing. Only a coward could run now.  He managed at last to get his lips to work.  \"Since you came, Miss Sarah--I've been seeing life at a new angle--\" he paused awkwardly.  The red blood mounted to her cheeks.  \"You have given me new eyes--\"  [Illustration: \"'You have given me new eyes'\"]  She turned her head away. There was no mistaking the tremor of his tones. She was too honest to simper and pretend. Her heart was pounding so loudly she wondered if he could hear.  He fumbled nervously with his glove, glanced at her from the corner of his eye, and his voice sank to a whisper:  \"I--I love you, Sarah!\"  She turned slowly and looked at him through dimmed eyes:  \"And I love you--\"  She paused, brushed a tear from her cheek, and with sweet reproach quietly added:  \"Why didn't you tell me sooner? We've lost so many beautiful days that might have been perfect--\"  He suddenly stooped and kissed her full lips.  \"We'll not lose any more--\"  \"The world _is_ beautiful, isn't it, dear!\" she said, nestling closer.  \"Since I see with your eyes--yes. It was only a place to fight in, before. Now it's a fairy world, and these wild flowers that cover the plains only grow to make a carpet for the feet of the girl I love--\"  \"A fairy world--yes--\" she whispered, \"it's been just that to me since I first sang the 'Fairy Bells' for you--\"  \"I'll never love another song as that,\" he said reverently.  \"Nor I,\" was the low response. \"My heart will beat to its music forever--it just means you, now--\"  For a long time they sat without words, holding each other's hand. The sun hung a glowing ball of fire on the rim of the far-away hills, and the shadows of the valley deepened into twilight.  \"How wonderful the silence of the plains!\" the lover sighed.  \"It used to oppress me.\"  The man nodded.  \"And now, I hear the beat of angels' wings and know that God is near--\"  \"Because we love--\" and she laughed for joy.  Again they sat in sweet, brooding silence.  A horseman rode over the hilltop in the glow of the fading sun. From its summit, he lifted his hand and waved a salute. They looked below, and in the doorway of a cabin, a young mother stood, a babe in her arms answering with hand uplifted high above her child.  \"What does it matter, dear,\" she whispered, \"a cabin or a palace!\"     IX  WAR   Side by side through the still white light of the full moon they rode home, in each heart the glow of the wonder and joy of Love's first revelation. Words were an intrusion. The eyes of the soul were seeing now the hidden things of life.  The gleam of the lights at the Fort brought them sharply out of dreamland into the world of fact.  \"You must see my father to-night, dear,\" she said eagerly.  \"Must I, to-night?\"  \"It's best.\"  \"I'd rather face a hundred Red Men in war paint.\"  A merry laugh was her answer as she leaned close:  \"Don't be silly, he likes you.\"  \"But he _loves_ you.\"  \"Of course, and for that reason my happiness will be his.\"  \"God knows, I hope so,\" was the doleful response. \"But if I must, I must. I'll see him.\"  A quick kiss in the friendly shadows and she was gone.  He walked alone an hour after supper, screwing up his courage to the point of bearding the Colonel in his den. He fumbled the door-bell at last, his heart in his throat.  Old Rough and Ready was not inclined to help him in his embarrassment. Never had he seen the lines of his strong jaw harder or more set than when he grunted:  \"Sit down, sir. Don't stand there staring. I'm not on inspection.\"  The perspiration started on his forehead and he moistened his dry lips.  \"I beg your pardon, Colonel. I was a little flustered. I've--a--something--on--my mind--\"  \"Out with it!\"  \"I--I--I'm in love with Miss Sarah.\"  \"You don't say?\"  \"Y-yes, sir.\"  \"Well, it's no news to me. The whole family have been enjoying the affair for some time. I suppose you're asking--or think you're asking--for my daughter's hand in marriage?\"  \"That's it--yes, sir--exactly.\"  \"I guessed as much. I'm glad to tell you, young man, that I've always had the kindliest feelings for you personally--\"  \"Thank you, sir--\"  \"And the warmest admiration for your talents as an officer. You're a good soldier. You have brains. You have executive ability. You're a leader of men. You'll go far in your profession--\"  \"Thank you, sir--\"  \"And that's why I don't like you as a son-in-law.\"  \"W--Wha--\"  \"I love my daughter, and I want her to be happy in a real home with a real husband and children by her side. A soldier's life is a dog's life. I've pitied the poor girl who gave up her home for me. Many a bitter tear has she shed over my absence, in torturing dread of the next letter from the frontier--\"  He paused and sprang to his feet:  \"A hundred times I've sworn no daughter of mine should ever marry a soldier! The better the soldier, the more reason she should not marry him--\"  \"But, sir--\"  \"There's no 'but' about it!\" the Colonel thundered. \"You're asking me to let you murder my girl, that's all--but it's life. I'll have to give my consent and wish you good luck, long life, and all the happiness you can get out of a soldier's lot.\"  The Colonel extended his hand and the Lieutenant grasped it with grateful eagerness.  The days that followed were red lettered in the calendar of life.  And then it came--a crash of thunder out of the clear sky--the thing he had somehow felt and dreaded.  A petty court-martial was called to adjust a question of army discipline. The court was composed of Z. Taylor, Colonel Commanding, Major Thomas F. Smith, a fiery-tempered gay officer of the old army, Lieutenant Jefferson Davis, and the new Second Lieutenant who had just arrived from the Jefferson Barracks at St. Louis.  The army regulations required that each officer sitting in court-martial should be in full uniform. The new arrival from St. Louis had come without his uniform. His trunk had miscarried and was returned to the Jefferson Barracks.  He rose with embarrassment:  \"I must beg the pardon of the Court, Colonel,\" he began cautiously, \"for not appearing in my uniform. As it is in St. Louis I respectfully ask to be excused to-day from wearing it.\"  The old Colonel scowled. It was just like a young fool to wish to sit in solemn judgment on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],["title","The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#8)"],["body"," fellow officer--in his shirt sleeves. If he had asked to be excused from serving on the Court--yes--he could accept his excuse and let him go. But this insolence was unbearable. The Colonel glanced over the Court before putting the question to a vote. Smith was his enemy. Whichever way he voted as President, the Major could be depended on to go against his decision. There was a feud between those two hot-tempered fire-eaters which had lasted for years. He glanced at his future son-in-law with a smile of assured victory. Tom Smith would vote against him, but the trembling youngster who had quailed before him that night asking for his daughter's hand was practically in the family. He smiled at the certainty of downing Smith once more.  In a voice, whose tones left nothing to the imagination of the presumptuous Second Lieutenant, the Colonel growled:  \"Gentlemen, we are asked to allow an officer to sit in the formal judgment of a court-martial without uniform--I put the question to a vote and cast mine. No!\"  \"I vote yes!\" shouted the Major.  The Colonel did not condescend to look his way. He knew what that vote was before he heard it. He bent his piercing eyes on his future son-in-law:  \"Lieutenant Davis?\"  There was just a moment's hesitation. The Lieutenant smiled at his embarrassed young fellow officer and mildly answered:  \"I think, Colonel, in view of the distance to St. Louis, we may excuse the young man for the first offense--I vote--yes.\"  The old Colonel stared at him in speechless amazement. Smith grinned.  The Colonel's face grew purple with rage. He was just able to gasp his words during the progress of the trial. It was brief, and when it ended and the rest had gone, he faced the Lieutenant with blazing eyes:  \"How dare you, sir, vote with that damned fool against me?\"  \"Why, I never thought to hurt you, Colonel--\"  \"No? And what _did_ you think?\"  \"I only thought of relieving the evident embarrassment of a young officer--\"  \"You did, eh?--no thought of me or my feelings, of my wishes. You're a hell of a son-in-law, you are--\"  He paused for breath and choked with rage no words could express. When at last his tongue found speech, he swore in oaths more expressive and profound than modern man has ever dreamed. He damned the Court. He damned Tom Smith. He damned the Second Lieutenant. He damned the regiment. He damned the Government that created it. He damned the Indians that called it to the plains. He damned the world and all in it, and all things under it. But, particularly and specifically, he damned the young ass who dared to flaunt his feelings and opinions after smiling in his face at his house, for days and weeks and months.  Finally, facing the blushing Lieutenant, his eyes flashing indignant scorn, he shouted:  \"No man who votes with a damned fool like Tom Smith, can marry my daughter!\"  \"Colonel, I protest,\" pleaded the heartsick lover.  \"I forbid you to ever put your foot inside my quarters again!\"  \"Colonel--\"  \"Silence, sir! I forbid you to ever speak to my daughter again!\"  \"But, Colonel--\"  \"I repudiate you and all yours. I wipe you from the map. You don't exist. I don't know you. I never knew you. Get out of my sight!\"  The tall, slender form slowly straightened and a look of cold pride shot from the depths of his blue eyes. Without a word he turned and left.     X  ROMANCE   Black Hawk was leading his red warriors in a great uprising. A wave of fierce excitement swept the frontier. There was stern work now for men to do and women must wait alone.  The regiment marched to the front. The Colonel as a man was freezingly formal with the Lieutenant. As an officer, he knew his worth and relied on it in every emergency. The State of Illinois had raised two companies of raw recruits to join in subduing the Indians. The Colonel sent his most efficient subordinate to swear in the new soldiers. On the morning of the muster, there appeared before the tall Lieutenant, a man full three inches taller, and famous in his county as the gawkiest, slab-sidest, homeliest, best-natured fellow in the State. He was dressed in a suit of blue jeans.  In slow, pleasing drawl, he announced:  \"I am the Captain, of this company--\"  And he waved his long arm toward the crowd of his countrymen on the right.  Lieutenant Jefferson Davis promptly administered to Abraham Lincoln his first oath to support the Constitution and laws of the United States.  Two men destined to immortal fame had met and passed with scarcely a glance at each other. The young army officer was too much of a gentleman to mark the ill-fitting blue jeans of the awkward captain of militia. Great events, after all, make men great. Only the eye of God could foresee the coming tragedy in which these two would play their mighty rôles.  At the end of the brief struggle on the frontier, Black Hawk's people were scattered to the four winds and the brave old warrior, with a handful of his men, sought Colonel Taylor's command to surrender.  Again, the Colonel sent his most accomplished officer, the Lieutenant whom he had forbidden to enter his house,--to treat with the fallen Chief.  The Lieutenant received with kindly words the broken-hearted warrior, his two sons and sixty braves, and conducted them at once as prisoners of war to the barracks at St. Louis.  The cholera was raging at Rock Island, and on the boat two of the Indian prisoners were seized with the fatal disease. The Lieutenant, at the risk of his life, personally ministered to their needs. The two stricken men made known to the commander in broken words and signs that they had sworn an oath of eternal friendship. In pleading tones the stronger said:  \"We beg the good Chief to put us ashore that hand in hand we may go to the happy hunting grounds together.\"  Near the first little settlement their prayer was granted.  The young officer turned to his boat with a sigh as he saw the red warriors slip their arms about each other and slowly sink to the ground to die alone and unattended.  Old Black Hawk sat in silent, stolid indifference to his fate until the curious settlers began to crowd on the boat and stare at his misery.  The Lieutenant interfered with sharp decision.  \"Push those men back, Corporal!\" he ordered angrily.  The crowd was roughly pushed back and the Lieutenant took Black Hawk kindly by the arm and led him into a reserved apartment where he was free from vulgar eyes.  The old man's lips tightened. He gazed at the officer steadily and spoke in measured tones:  \"The young war Chief treats me with much kindness. He is good and brave. He puts himself in my place and sees all that I suffer. With him I am much pleased.\"  The Lieutenant bowed and left him under the protection of the guard. Courtesy to a fallen foe in the old days was the first obligation of an officer and a gentleman.  In the autumn, Colonel Taylor again sent his Lieutenant on a distant duty--this time one of peculiar danger. He was ordered to Louisville and Lexington on recruiting service. And the cholera was known to be epidemic but a few miles from Lexington.  The good-by scene that night at the lovers' trysting place, the little tent reception-room of the McCreas', was long and tender and solemn.  \"Oh, I feel dreadful about this trip, dear,\" his sweetheart kept repeating with pitiful despair that refused to be comforted.  \"You must be brave, my own,\" he answered with a frown. \"A soldier's business is to die. I am a soldier. I go where duty calls--\"  \"To battle--yes--but this black pestilence that comes in the night--I'm afraid--I just can't help it--I'm afraid. I've always had a horror of such things. I've a presentiment that you'll die that way--\"  \"Presentiments and dreams go by opposites. I'll live to a ripe old age--\"  She looked up into his face with a tender smile:  \"You think so?\"  \"Yes, why not?\"  \"Well--I've something to tell you--\"  She paused and the man bent low.  \"What?\"  \"I've made a vow to God--\" the voice stopped with a sob--\"that if He will only send you safely back to me this time--I'll wait no longer on my father's whim--I am yours--\"  The lover clasped her trembling form to his heart.  \"Good-by, dearest,\" he said at last. \"I wish to go with that promise ringing in my soul.\"  Ten days after he reached Lexington, the cholera broke out, and hundreds fled. He stood by his men, watched their diet, nursed the sick, and buried the dead. He helped the carpenter make the coffins and reverently bore the victims to their graves. No fear was in his soul. Love was chanting the anthem of Life.  A strange new light was burning in the eyes of the woman he loved on the day he returned in safety.  She seized his hand and spoke with decision:  \"Come with me.\"  Her father was standing at the gate. She faced him, holding defiantly the hand of her lover.  The old man saw and understood. His jaw was set with sullen determination and his face hardened.  \"We have waited two long years,\" she began softly. \"We have been patient and hopeful, but you have given no sign. My lover's character is beyond reproach, and I am proud of him. I am sorry to cross you, Father, but I've made up my mind, I am going to marry him now.\"  The Colonel turned in silence and slowly walked into the house.  Captain McCrea engaged a stateroom for her on the boat for Louisville. The lovers planned to meet at her aunt's, the Colonel's oldest sister. The tearful good-bys had been said to Mother and sisters and brother.  The Colonel had not spoken, but he had business on the boat before she cast her lines from the shore.  The daughter drew him into her stateroom and slipped her arms around his neck. Few words were spoken and they were broken.  \"Please, Father--please?--I love you--please--\"  \"No.\"  \"I'm no longer a child. I'm a woman. You're a real man and you know I could have no respect for myself if I should yield my life's happiness to a whim--\"  The old Colonel stroked her shoulder:  \"I understand. You're a chip off the old block. You're just as"]]]
