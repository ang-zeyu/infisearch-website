She thought she would try and say something to please Platypus; so she asked, very kindly, if the bone ever hurt it. But this strange creature did not seem to notice the remark. Settling itself more comfortably amongst the grass, it muttered in calmer tones, \"I trace my ancestry back to the Oolite Age. Where does man come in?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Dot.  \"Of course you don't!\" replied the Platypus, contemptuously, \"Humans are so ignorant! That is because they are so new. When they have existed a few more million years, they will be more like us of old families; they will respect quiet, exclusive living, like that of the Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus, and will not be so inquisitive, pushing, and dangerous as now. The age will come when they will understand, and will cease to write books, and there will be peace for everyone.\"  The Kangaroo now thought it a good opportunity to change the subject, and gently introduced the topic of Dot's lost way, saying how she had found the little girl, and had taken care of her ever since.  The Platypus did not seem interested, and yawned more than once whilst the Kangaroo spoke.  \"The question is,\" concluded the Kangaroo, \"who shall I ask to find it? Someone must know where it is.\"  \"Of course,\" said the Platypus, yawning again, without so much as putting its web foot in front of its bill, which Dot thought very rude, or else very ancient manners. \"Little Human,\" it said, \"tell me what kind of bush creatures come about your burrow.\"  \"We live in a cottage,\" she said, but seeing that the Platypus did not like to be corrected, and that the Kangaroo looked quite shocked at her doing so, she hurriedly described the creatures she had seen there. She said there were Crickets, Grasshoppers, Mice, Lizards, Swallows, Opossums, Flying Foxes, Kookooburras, Magpies, and Shepherd's Companions----  \"Stop!\" interrupted the Platypus, with a wave of its web foot; \"that is the right one.\"  \"Who?\" asked the Kangaroo and Dot anxiously, together.  \"The bird you call Shepherd's Companion. Some of you call it Rickety Dick, or Willy Wagtail.\" Turning to the Kangaroo especially, it continued. \"If you can bring yourself to speak to anything so obtrusive and gossiping, without any ancestry or manners whatever, you will be able to learn all you need from that bird. Humans and Wagtails fraternise together. They're both post-glacial.\"  \"I knew you could advise me,\" said the Kangaroo, gratefully.  \"Oh! Platypus, how clever you are!\" cried Dot, clapping her hands.  Directly Dot had spoken she saw that she had offended the queer little creature before her. It raised itself with an air of offended dignity that was unmistakable.  \"The name Platypus is insulting,\" it remarked, looking at the child severely, \"it means _broad-footed_, a vulgar pseudonym which could only have emanated from the brutally coarse expressions of a Human. My name is Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus. Besides, even if my front feet can expand, they can also contract; see! as narrow and refined as a bird's claw. Observe, too, that my hind feet are narrow, and like a seal's fin, though it has been described as a mole's foot.\"  As the Platypus spoke, and thrust out its strangely different feet, the Kangaroo edged a little closer to Dot and whispered in her ear. \"It's getting angry, and is beginning to use long words; do be careful what you say or it will be terrible!\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" said Dot; \"I did not wish to hurt your feelings, Para--, Pa--ra--dox--us.\"  \"_Ornithorhynchus_ Paradoxus, if you please,\" insisted the little creature. \"How would you like it if your name was Jones-Smith-Jones, and I called you one Jones, or one Smith, and did not say both the Jones and the Smiths? You have no idea how sensitive our race is. You Humans have no feelings at all compared with ours. Why! my fifth pair of nerves are larger than a man's! Humans get on my nerves dreadfully!\" it ended in disgusted accents.  \"She did not mean to hurt you,\" said the gentle Kangaroo, soothingly. \"Is there anything we can do to make you feel comfortable again?\"  \"There is nothing you can do,\" sighed the Platypus, now mournful and depressed. \"I must sing. Only music can quiet my nerves. I will sing a little threnody composed by myself, about the good old days of this world before the Flood.\" And as it spoke, the Platypus moved into an upright position amongst the tussock grass, and after a little cough opened its bill to sing.  The Kangaroo kept very close to Dot, and warned her to be very attentive to the song, and not to interrupt it on any account. Almost before the Kangaroo had ceased to whisper in her ear, Dot heard this strange song, sung to the most peculiar tune she had ever heard, and in the funniest of little squeaky voices.     The fairest Iguanodon reposed upon the shore;   Extended lay her beauteous form, a hundred feet and more.   The sun, with rays flammivomous, beat on the blue-black sand;   And sportive little Saurians disported on the strand;   But oft the Iguanodon reproved them in their glee,   And said, \"Alas! this Saurian Age is not what it should be!\"    Then, forth from that archaic sea, the Ichthyosaurus   Uprose upon his finny wings, with neocomian fuss,   \"O Iguanodon!\" he cried, as he approached the shore,   \"Why art thou thus dysthynic, love? Come, rise with me, and soar,   Or leave these estuarian seas, and wander in the grove;   Behold! a bird-like reptile fish is dying for thy love!\"    Then, through the dark coniferous grove they wandered side by side,   The tender Iguanodon and Ichthyosaurian bride;   And through the enubilious air, the carboniferous breeze,   Awoke, with _their_ amphibious sighs, the silence in the trees.   \"To think,\" they cried, botaurus-toned, \"when ages intervene,   Our osseous fossil forms will be in some museum seen!\"    Bemoaning thus, by dumous path, they crushed the cycad's growth,   And many a crash, and thunder, marked the progress of them both.   And when they reached the estuary, the excandescent sun   Was setting o'er the hefted sea; their saurian day was done.   Then raised they paraseline eyes unto the flaming moon,   And wept--the Neocomian Age was passing all too soon!    O Iguanodon! O Earth! O Ichthyosaurus!   O Melanocephalous saurians! Oh! oh! oh!                          (Here the Platypus was sobbing)    Oh, Troglyodites obscure--oh! oh!   At this point of the song, the poor Platypus, whose voice had trembled with increasing emotion and sobbing in each verse, broke down, overcome by the extreme sensitiveness of its fifth pair of nerves and the sadness of its song, and wept in terrible grief.  The gentle Kangaroo was also deeply moved, seeing the Platypus in such sorrow, and Dot mastered her aversion to touching cold, damp fur, and stroked the little creature's head.  The Platypus seemed much soothed by their sympathy, but hurriedly bid them farewell. It said it must try and restore its shattered fifth pair of nerves by a few hydrophilus latipalpus beetles for lunch, and a sleep.  It wearily dragged itself down to the edge of the pool, and looked backwards to the Kangaroo and Dot, who called out \"Good-bye\" to it. Its eyes were dim with tears, for it was still thinking of the Iguanodon and Ichthyosaurus, and of the good old days before the Flood.  \"It breaks my heart to think that they are all fossils,\" it exclaimed, mournfully shaking its head. \"Fossils!\" it repeated, as it plunged into the pool and swam away. \"Fossils!\" it cried once more, in far, faint accents; and a second later it dived out of sight.  For several moments after the Platypus had disappeared from view, the Kangaroo and Dot remained just as it had left them. Then Dot broke the silence.  \"Dear Kangaroo,\" said she, \"what was that song about?\"  \"I don't know,\" said the animal wistfully, \"no one ever knows what the Platypus sings about.\"  \"It was very sad,\" said Dot.  \"Dreadfully sad!\" sighed the Kangaroo; \"but the Platypus is a most learned and interesting creature,\" she added hastily. \"Its conversation and songs are most edifying; everyone in the bush admits it.\"  \"Does anyone understand its conversation?\" asked Dot. She was afraid she must be very stupid, for she hadn't understood anything except that Willy Wagtail could help them to find her way.  \"That is the beauty of it all,\" said the Kangaroo. \"The Platypus is so learned and so instructive, that no one tries to understand it; it is not expected that anyone should.\"  [Illustration: DOT DANCES WITH THE NATIVE COMPANIONS]     CHAPTER V   \"Now we must find Willy Wagtail,\" said the Kangaroo. \"The chances are Click-i-ti-clack, his big cousin who lives in the bush, will be able to tell us where to find him; for he doesn't care for the bush, and lives almost entirely with Humans, and the queer creatures they have brought into the country now-a-days. We may have to go a long way, so hop into my pouch, and we will get on our way.\"  Once more Dot was in the kind Kangaroo's pouch. It was in the latter end of autumn, and the air was so keen, that, as her torn little frock was now very little protection to her against the cold, she was glad to be back in that nice fur bag. She was used now to the springy bounding of the great Kangaroo, and felt quite safe; so that she quite enjoyed the wonderful and seemingly dangerous things the animal did in its great leaps and jumps.  With many rests and stops to eat berries or grass on their way, they searched the bush for the rest of the day without finding the big bush Wagtail. All kinds of creatures had seen him, or heard his strange rattling, chattering song; but it always seemed that he had just flown off a few minutes before they heard of him. It was most vexatious, and Dot saw that another night must pass before they would be able to hear of her home. She did not like to think of that, for she could picture to herself all those great men, on their big rough horses, coming back"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18891"],["title","Dot and the Kangaroo (#7)"],["body","her father's cottage that night, and how they would begin to be quiet and sad.  She thought it would not be half so bad to be lost, if the people at home could only know that one was safe and snug in a kind Kangaroo's pouch; but she knew that her parents could never suppose that she was so well cared for, and would only think that she was dying alone in the terrible bush--dying for want of food and water, and from fear and exposure. How strange it seemed that people should die like that in the bush, where so many creatures lived well, and happily! But then they had not bush friends to tell them what berries and roots to eat, and where to get water, and to cuddle them up in a nice warm fur during the cold night. As she thought of this she rubbed her face against the Kangaroo's soft coat, and patted her with her little hands; and the affectionate animal was so pleased at these caresses, that she jumped clean over a watercourse, twenty feet at least, in one bound.  It was getting evening time, and the sun was setting with a beautiful rosy colour, as they came upon a lovely scene. They had followed the watercourse until it widened out into a great shallow creek beside a grassy plain. As they emerged from the last scattered bushes and trees of the forest, and hopped out into the open side of a range of hills, miles and miles of grass country, with dim distant hills, stretched before them. The great shining surface of the creek caught the rosy evening light, and every pink cloudlet in the sky looked doubly beautiful reflected in the water. Here and there out of the water arose giant skeleton trees, with huge silver trunks and contorted dead branches. On these twisted limbs were numbers of birds: Shag, blue and white Cranes, and black and white Ibis with their bent bills. Slowly paddling on the creek, with graceful movements, were twenty or thirty black Swans, and in and out of their ranks, as they passed in stately procession, shot wild Ducks and Moor Hens, like a flotilla of little boats amongst a fleet of big ships. All these birds were watching a pretty sight that arrested Dot's attention at once. By the margin of the creek, where tufted rushes and tall sedges shed their graceful reflection on the pink waters, were a party of Native Companions dancing.  \"In these times it is seldom we can see a sight like this,\" said the Kangaroo. \"The water is generally too unsafe for the birds to enjoy themselves. It often means death to them to have a little pleasure.\"  As the Kangaroo spoke, one of the Native Companions caught sight of her, and leaving the dance, opened her wings, and still making dainty steps with her long legs, half danced and half flew to where the Kangaroo was sitting.  \"Good evening, Kangaroo,\" she said, gracefully bowing; \"will you not come a little nearer to see the dance?\" Then the Native Companion saw Dot in the Kangaroo's pouch, and made a little spring of surprise. \"Dear me!\" she said, \"what have you in your pouch?\"  \"It's a Human,\" said the Kangaroo, apologetically; \"it's quite a little harmless one. Let me introduce you.\"  So Dot alighted from the pouch, and joined in the conversation, and the Native Companion was much interested in hearing her story.  \"Do you dance?\" asked the Native Companion, with a quick turn of her head, on its long, graceful neck. Dot said that she loved dancing. So the Native Companion took her down to the creek, and all the other Companions stopped dancing and gathered round her, whilst she was introduced and her story told. Then they spread their wings, and with stately steps escorted her to the edge of the water, whilst the Kangaroo sat a little way off, and delightedly watched the proceedings.  Dot didn't understand any of the figures of the dance; but the scenery was so lovely, and so was the pink sunset, and the Native Companions were so elegant and gay, that, catching up her ragged little skirts in both hands, she followed their movements with her bare brown feet as best she could, and enjoyed herself very much. To Dot, the eight birds that took part in the entertainment were very tall and splendid, with their lovely grey plumage and greeny heads, and she felt quite small as they gathered round her sometimes, and enclosed her within their outspread wings. And how beautiful their dancing was! How light their dainty steps! as their feet scarcely touched the earth; and what fantastic measures they danced! advancing, retreating, circling round--with their beautiful wings keeping the rhythm of their feet. There was one figure that Dot thought the prettiest of all--when they danced in line at the margin of the water; stepping, and bowing, and gracefully gyrating to their shadows, which were reflected with the pink clouds of evening on the surface of the creek.  Dot was very sorry, and hot, and breathless, when the dance came to an end. The sun had been gone a long time, and all the pink shades had slowly turned to grey; the creek had lost its radiant colour, and looked like a silver mirror, and so desolate and sombre, that no one could have imagined it to have been the scene of so much gaiety shortly before.  Dot hastily returned to the Kangaroo, and all the Native Companions came daintily, and made graceful adieus to them both. Afterwards, they spread their great, soft wings, and, stretching their long legs behind them, wheeled upwards to the darkening sky. Then all the birds in the bare trees preened their feathers, and settled down for the night; and the Kangaroo took her little Human charge back to the bush, where there was a cosy sheltering rock, under which to pass the night, and they lay down together, with the stars peeping at them through the branches of the trees.  They had slept for a long time, as it seemed to Dot, when they were awakened by a little voice saying:  \"Wake up, Kangaroo! you are in danger. Get away, as soon as possible!\"  The moon was shining fitfully, as it broke through swift flying clouds. In the uncertain light, Dot could see a little creature near them, and knew at once that it was an Opossum.  \"What is the matter?\" asked the Kangaroo, softly. \"Blacks!\" said the Opossum. And as it spoke, Dot heard a sound as of a half dingo dog howling and snapping in the distance. As that sound was heard, the Opossum made one flying leap to the nearest tree, and scrambled out of sight in a moment.  \"I wish he had told us a little more,\" said the Kangaroo. \"Still, for a 'possum, it was a good-natured act to wake me up. They are selfish, spiteful little beasts, as a rule. Now I wonder where those Blacks are? I shall have to go a little way to sniff and listen. I won't go far, so don't be afraid, but stay quietly here until I come back.\"     CHAPTER VI   It was terrible to Dot to see the Kangaroo hop off into the dark bush, and to find herself all alone; so she crawled out from under the ledge of rock into the moonlight, and sat on a stone where she could see the sky, and watch the black ragged clouds hurry over the moon. But the bush was not altogether quiet. She could hear an owl hooting at the moon. Not far off was a camp of quarrelsome Flying Foxes, and the melancholy Nightjar in the distance was fulfilling its mission of making all the bush creatures miserable with its incessant, mournful \"mo-poke! mo-poke!\" As Dot could understand all the voices, it amused her to listen to the wrangles of the Flying Foxes, as they ate the fruit of a wild fig tree near by. She saw them swoop past on their huge black wings with a solemn flapping. Then, as each little Fox approached the tree, the Foxes who were there already screamed, and swore in dreadfully bad language at the visitor. For every little Fox on the tree was afraid some other Flying Fox would eat all the figs, and as each visitor arrived he was assailed with cries of, \"Get away! you're not wanted here!\"  \"This is my branch, my figs!\"  \"Go and find figs for yourself!\"  \"These figs are not half ripe like the juicy ones on the other side of the tree!\"  Then the new-comer Flying Fox, with a spiteful squeal, would pounce down on a branch already occupied, and angry spluttering and screams would arise, followed by a heavy fall of fighting Foxes tumbling with a crash through the trees. Then out into the open sky swept dozens of black wings, accompanied by abusive swearing from dozens of wicked little brown Foxes; and, as they settled again on the tree, all the fighting would begin again, so that the squealing, screaming, and swearing never ended.  As Dot was listening to the fighting of the Flying Foxes, she heard a sound near her that alarmed her greatly. It was impossible to say what the noise was like. It might have been the braying of a donkey mixed up with the clattering of palings tumbled together, and with grunts and snorts. Dot started to her feet in fright, and would have run away, only she was afraid of being lost worse than ever, so she stood still and looked round for the terrible monster that could make such extraordinary sounds. The grunts and clattering stopped, and the noise died away in a long doleful bray, but she could not see where it came from. Having peered into the dark shadows, Dot went more into the open, and sat with her back to a fallen tree, keeping an anxious watch all round.  \"Perhaps it is the Blacks. What would they do with me if they found me? What will happen if they have killed my dear Kangaroo?\" and she covered her face with her hands as this terrible thought came into her head. Soon she heard something coming towards her stealthily and slowly. She would not look up she was so frightened. She was sure it was some fierce-looking Black man, with his spear, about to kill her. She shut her eyes closer, and held her breath. \"Perhaps,\" she thought, \"he will not see me.\" Then a cold shiver went through her little body, as she felt something claw hold of her hair, and she thought she was about to be killed. She kept her eyes shut, and the clawing went on, and then to her astonishment"]]]
