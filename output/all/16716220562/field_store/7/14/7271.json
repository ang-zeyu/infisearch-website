And when it reached the mid-point of the terrace, it flung up its head as if to challenge. But words issued from between those curved fangs, words which Dane might not understand but which undoubtedly held meaning for the men nodding in time to the hypnotic cadence of that da--da--da....  \"Beautiful!\" Tau spoke in honest admiration, his own eyes almost as feral as those of the talking beast as he leaned forward, his fists on his knees.  Now the animal was dancing also, its paws following the pace set by the masked attendants. It must be a man in an animal skin. But Dane could hardly believe that. The illusion was too perfect. His own hands went to the knife sheath at his belt. Out of deference to local custom they had left their stun rods in the palace, but a belt knife was an accepted article of apparel. Dane slid the blade out surreptitiously, setting its point against the palm of his hand and jabbing painfully. This was another of Tau's answers for breaking a spell. But the white and black creature continued to dance; there was no blurring of its body lines into those of a human being.  It sang on in a high-pitched voice, and Dane noted that those of the audience nearest the stools where Asaki and the captain were seated now watched the Chief Ranger and the space officer. He felt Tau tense beside him.  \"Trouble coming....\" The warning from Tau was the merest thread of sound. Dane forced himself to look away from the swaying cat-dog, to watch instead the singers who were now furtively eying their lord and his guest. The Terran knew that there were feudal bonds between the Ranger and his men. But suppose this was a showdown between Lumbrilo and Asaki--whose side would these men take?  He watched Captain Jellico's hand slide across his knee, his fingers drop in touching distance of knife hilt. And the hand of the Chief Ranger, hanging lax at his side, suddenly balled into a fist.  \"So!\" Tau expelled the word as a hiss. He moved with sure-footed speed. Now he passed between the stools to confront the dancing cat-dog. Yet he did not look at that weird creature and its attendants. Instead his arms were flung high as if to ward off--or perhaps welcome--something on the mountain side as he shouted:  \"_Hodi, eldama! Hodi!_\"  As one, those on the terrace turned, looked up toward the slope. Dane was on his feet, holding his knife as he might a sword. Though of what use its puny length would be against that huge bulk moving in slow majesty toward them, he did not try to think.  Gray-dark trunk curled upward between great ivory tusks, ears went wide as ponderous feet crunched volcanic soil. Tau moved forward, his hands still upraised, clearly in greeting. That trunk touched skyward as if in salute to the man who could be crushed under one foot.  \"_Hodi, eldama!_\" For the second time Tau hailed the monster elephant and the trunk raised in silent greeting from one lord of an earth to another he recognized as an equal. Perhaps it had been a thousand years since man and elephant had stood so, and then there had been only war and death between them. Now there was peace and a current of power flowing from one to the other. Dane sensed this, saw the men on the terrace likewise drawing back from the unseen tie between the medic and the bull he had so clearly summoned.  Then Tau's upheld hands came together in a sharp clap and men held their breath in wonder. Where the great bull had stood there was nothing--except rocks in the sun.  As Tau swung around to face the cat-dog, that creature had no substance either. For he fronted no animal but a man, a small, lean man whose lips wrinkled back from his teeth in a snarl. His attendant priests fell back, leaving the spaceman and the witch doctor alone.  \"Lumbrilo's magic is great,\" Tau said evenly. \"I hail Lumbrilo of Khatka.\" His hand made the open-palmed salute of peace.  The snarl faded as the man brought his face under control. He stood naked, but he was clothed in inherit dignity. And there was power with that dignity, power and a pride before which even the more physically impressive Chief Ranger might have to give place.  \"You have magic also, outlander,\" he replied. \"Where walks this long-toothed shadow of yours now?\"  \"Where once the men of Khatka walked, Lumbrilo. For it was men of your blood who long, long past hunted this shadow of mine and made its body their prey.\"  \"So that it now might have a blood debt to settle with us, outlander?\"  \"That you said, not I, man of power. You have shown us one beast, I have shown another. Who can say which of them is stronger when it issues forth from the shadows?\"  Lumbrilo pattered forward, his bare feet making little sound on the stones of the terrace. Now he was only an arm's-length away from the medic.  \"You have challenged me, off-world man.\" Was that a question or a statement? Dane wondered.  \"Why should I challenge you, Lumbrilo? To each race its own magic. I come not to offer battle.\" His eyes held steady with the Khatkan's.  \"You have challenged me.\" Lumbrilo turned away and then looked back over his shoulder. \"The strength you depend upon may become a broken staff, off-worlder. Remember my words in the time when shadows become substance, and substance the thinnest of shadows!\"     III   \"You are truly a man of power!\"  Tau shook his head in answer to that outburst from Asaki.  \"Not so, sir. Your Lumbrilo is a man of power. I drew upon his power and you saw the results.\"  \"Deny it not! What we saw never walked this world.\"  Tau slung the strap of a trail bag over his shoulder. \"Sir, once men of your blood, men who bred your race, hunted the elephant. They took his tusks for their treasure, feasted upon his flesh--yes, and died beneath the trampling of his feet when they were unlucky or unwary. So there is that within you which can even now be awakened to remember _eldama_ in his might when he was king of the herd and need fear nothing save the spears and cunning of small, weak men. Lumbrilo had already awakened your minds to see what he willed you to see.\"  \"How does he do this?\" asked the other simply. \"Is it magic that we see not Lumbrilo but a lion before us?\"  \"He weaves his spell with the drums, with the chant, by the suggestion his mind imposes upon yours. And, having woven his spell, he cannot limit it to just the picture he suggests if ancient racial memories raise another. I merely used the tools of Lumbrilo to show you yet another picture your people once knew well.\"  \"And in so doing made an enemy.\" Asaki stood before a rack of very modern weapons. Now he made his selection, a silver tube with a stock curved to fit a man's shoulder. \"Lumbrilo will not forget.\"  Tau laughed shortly. \"No, but then I have merely done as you wished, have I not, sir? I have focused on myself the enmity of a dangerous man, and now you hope I shall be forced, in self-defense, to remove him from your path.\"  The Khatkan turned slowly, resting the weapon across his forearm. \"I do not deny that, spaceman.\"  \"Then matters here are indeed serious--\"  \"They are so serious,\" Asaki interrupted, speaking not only to Tau but to the other off-worlders as well, \"that what happens now may mean the end of the Khatka that I know. Lumbrilo is the most dangerous game I have faced in a lifetime as a hunter. He goes, or we draw his fangs--or else all that I am, all I have labored here to build, will be swept away. To preserve this I will use any weapon.\"  \"And I am now your weapon, which you hope will be as successful as that needler you are carrying.\" Tau laughed again, without much humor. \"Let us hope I shall prove as effective.\"  Jellico moved out of the shadows. It was just after dawn, and the grayness of the vanishing night still held in the corners of the armory. Deliberately he took his own stand before the arms racks and chose a short-barreled blaster. Only when its butt was cupped in his hand did he glance at his host.  \"We came guesting, Asaki. We have eaten salt and bread under this roof.\"  \"On my body and my blood it is,\" returned the Khatkan grimly. \"I shall go down to the blackness of Sabra before you do, if the flames of death are against us.\" From his belt he flipped loose his knife and offered the hilt to Jellico. \"My body for a wall between you and the dark, Captain. But also understand this: to me, what I do now is greater than the life of any one man. Lumbrilo and the evil behind him must be rooted out. There was no trickery in my invitation!\"  They stood eye to eye, equal in height, in authority of person, and that indefinable something which made them both masters in their own different worlds. Then Jellico's hand went out, his fingertip flicked the hilt of the bared blade.  \"There was no trickery,\" he conceded. \"I knew that your need was great when you came to the _Queen_.\"  Since both the captain and Tau appeared to accept the situation, Dane, not quite understanding it all, was prepared to follow their lead. And for the moment they had nothing more in plan than to visit the Zoboru preserve.  They went by flitter--Asaki, one of his Hunter pilots, and the three from the _Queen_--lifting over the rim of mountains behind the fortress-palace and speeding north with the rising sun a flaming ball to the east. Below, the country was stark--rocks and peaks, deep purple shadows marking the veins of crevices. But that was swiftly behind and they were over a sea of greens, many shades of green, with yellow, blue, even red cutting into the general verdant carpet of treetops. Another chain of heights and then open land, swales of tall grass already burnt yellow by the steady sun. There was a river here, a crazy, twisted stream coiling nearly back upon itself at times.  Once more broken land, land so ravished by prehistoric volcanic action that it was a grotesque nightmare of erosion-whittled outcrops and mesas. Asaki pointed to the east. There was a dark patch widening out into a vast wedge.  \"The swamp of Mygra."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],["title","Voodoo Planet (#4)"],["body"," has not yet been explored.\"  \"You could air map it,\" Tau began.  The Chief Ranger was frowning. \"Four flitters have been lost trying that. Com reports fail when they cross that last mountain ridge eastward. There is some sort of interference which we do not yet understand. Mygra is a place of death; later we may be able to travel along its fringe and then you shall see. Now--\" He spoke to the pilot in his own tongue and the flitter pointed up-nose at an angle as they climbed over the highest peak they had yet seen in this mountainous land, to reach at last a country of open grass dotted with small forest stands. Jellico nodded approvingly.  \"Zoboru?\"  \"Zoboru,\" Asaki assented. \"We shall go up to the northern end of the preserve. I wish to show you the roosts of the fastals. This is their nesting season and the sight is one you will long remember. But we shall take an eastern course; I have two Ranger stations to check on the way.\"  It was after they left the second station that the flitter swung farther out eastward, again climbing over the chain of heights to sight one of the newly discovered wonders the staff at the last station had reported--a crater lake.  And the flitter skimmed down across water which was a rich emerald in hue, filling the crater from one rock wall to the other with no beach at the foot of those precipitant cliffs. As the machine arose to clear the far wall, Dane tensed. One of his duties aboard the _Queen_ was flitter pilot for planetwise trips. And ever since they had taken off that morning he had unconsciously flown with the Khatkan pilot, anticipating each change or adjustment of the controls. Now he felt that sluggish response to the other's lift signal, and instinctively his own hand went out to adjust a power feed lever.  They made the rise, were well above the danger of the cliff wall. But the machine was not responding properly. Dane did not need to watch the pilot's swiftly moving hands to guess that they were in trouble. And his slight concern deepened into something else as the flitter began to drop nose again. In front of him, Captain Jellico shifted uneasily, and Dane knew that he, too, was alerted.  Now the pilot had plunged the power adjuster to the head against the control board. But the nose of the flitter acted as if it were overweighted or magnetically attracted by the rocks below. The best efforts of the man flying it could not keep it level. They were being drawn earthward, and all the pilot could do only delayed the inevitable crack-up. The Khatkan was turning the machine north to avoid what lay below, for here a long arm of the Mygra swamp clasped about the foot of the mountain.  The Chief Ranger spoke into the mike of the com unit while the pilot continued to fight against the pull which was bringing them down. Now the small machine was below the level of the volcanic peak which cradled the lake, and the mountain lay between them and the preserve.  Asaki gave a muffled exclamation, slapped the com box, spoke more sharply into the mike. It was apparent he was not getting the results he wanted. Then with a quick glance about he snapped an order:  \"Strap in!\"  His Terran companions had already buckled the wide webbing belts intended to save them from crash shock. Dane saw the pilot push the button to release fend cushions. In spite of his pounding heart, a small fraction of his brain recognized the other's skill as the Khatkan took a course to bring them down on a relatively level patch of sand and gravel.  Dane raised his head from the shelter of his folded arms. The Chief Ranger was busy with the pilot, who lay limply against the controls. Captain Jellico and Tau were already pulling at the buckles of their protective crash belts. But one look at the front of the flitter told Dane that it would not take to the air again without extensive repairs. Its nose was bent up and back, obscuring the forward view completely. However, the pilot had made a miraculously safe landing considering the terrain.  Ten minutes later, the pilot restored to consciousness and the gash in his head bandaged, they held a council of war.  \"The com was off, too. I did not have a chance to report before the crash,\" Asaki put the situation straightly. \"And our exploring parties have not yet mapped this side of the range; it has a bad reputation because of the swamp.\"  Jellico measured the heights now to their west with resigned eyes. \"Looks as if we climb.\"  \"Not here,\" the Chief Ranger corrected him. \"There is no passing through the crater lake region on foot. We must travel south along the edge of the mountain area until we do find a scalable way into the preserve region.\"  \"You seem very certain we are not going to be rescued if we stay right here,\" Tau observed. \"Why?\"  \"Because I'm inclined to believe that any flitter that tries to reach us may run into the same trouble. Also, they have no com fix on us. It will be at least a day or more before they will even begin to count us missing, and then they will have the whole northern portion of the preserve to comb; there are not enough men here--I can give you a multitude of reasons, Medic.\"  \"One of which might be sabotage?\" demanded Jellico.  Asaki shrugged. \"Perhaps. I am not loved in some quarters. But there may also be something fatal to flitters here as there is over Mygra. We thought the crater lake district safely beyond the swamp influence, but it may not be so.\"  But you took the chance of traveling over it, Dane thought, though he did not comment aloud. Was this another of the Chief Ranger's attempts to involve them in some private trouble of his own? Though to deliberately smash up a flitter and set them all afoot in this wilderness was a pretty drastic move.  Asaki had started to unload emergency supplies from the flitter. They each had a trail bag for a pack. But when the pilot staggered over to pull out a set of stass belts and Jellico began to uncoil them, the Chief Ranger shook his head.  \"With the feeder beam shut off by the mountains, I fear those will no longer work.\"  Jellico tossed one on the crumpled nose of the flitter and punched its button with the tip of the needler barrel. Then he threw a rock at the dangling belt. The stone landed, taking the wide protective band with it to the ground. That force field which should have warded off the missile was not working.  \"Oh, fine!\" Tau opened his trail bag to pack concentrates. Then he smiled crookedly. \"We aren't signed in for killing licenses, sir. Do you pay our fines if we are forced to shoot a hole through something that disputes the right of way?\"  To Dane's surprise, the Chief Ranger laughed. \"You are off preserve now, Medic Tau. The rules do not cover wild land. But I would suggest we now hunt a cave before nightfall.\"  \"Lions?\" asked Jellico.  Dane, remembering the black and white beast Lumbrilo had presented, did not enjoy that thought. They had--his gaze went from man to man checking weapons--the needler Asaki carried, and another the pilot had slung by its carrying strap over his shoulder. Tau and the captain both were armed with blasters and he had a fire ray and a force blade, both considered small arms but deadly enough perhaps even to dampen a lion's enthusiasm for the chase.  \"Lions, graz, rock apes,\" Asaki fastened the mouth of his trail bag. \"All are hunters or killers. The graz send out scouts, and they are big and formidable enough to have no enemies. Lions hunt with intelligence and skill. Rock apes are dangerous, but luckily they cannot keep silent when they scent their prey and so give one warning.\"  As they climbed up-slope from the flitter, Dane, looking back, saw that perhaps Asaki was right in his belief that they had better try to help themselves rather than wait for rescue. Putting aside the excuse of fearing another crack-up, the wrecked flitter made no outstanding mark on the ground. The higher they climbed, the less it could be distinguished from the tumble of rocks about it.  He had lagged a little behind and, when he hurried to catch up, found Jellico standing with his distance vision lenses to his eyes, directing them toward that shadow marking the swamp. As the younger spaceman reached him, the captain lowered the glasses and spoke:  \"Take your knife, Thorson, and hold it close to that rock--over there.\" He pointed to a rounded black knob protruding from the soil a little off their path.  Dane obeyed, only to have the blade jerk in his hand. And when he loosened his hold in amazement, the steel slapped tight against the stone.  \"Magnetic!\"  \"Yes. Which might explain our crash. Also this.\" Jellico held out a field compass to demonstrate that its needle had gone completely mad.  \"We can use the mountain range itself for a guide,\" Dane said with more confidence than he felt.  \"True enough. But we may have trouble when we head west again.\" Jellico let the lenses swing free on their cord about his neck. \"If we were wrecked on purpose\"--his mouth tightened and the old blaster burn on his cheek stretched as did his jaw set--\"then someone is going to answer a lot of questions--and fast!\"  \"The Chief Ranger, sir?\"  \"I don't know. I just don't know!\" The captain grunted as he adjusted his pack and started on.  If fortune had failed them earlier, she smiled on them now. Asaki discovered a cave before sundown, located not too far from a mountain stream. The Ranger sniffed the air before that dark opening as the Hunter pilot shed his equipment and crept forward on his hands and knees, his head up and his nostrils expanding as he, too, tested the scent from the cave mouth.  Scent? It was closer to a stench, and one ripe enough to turn the stomach of an off-worlder. But the Hunter glanced back over his shoulder and nodded reassuringly.  \"Lion. But old. Not here within five days at least.\"  \"Well enough. And even old lion scent will keep away rock apes. We'll clean some and then we can rest undisturbed,\" was his superior's comment.  The cleaning was"]]]
