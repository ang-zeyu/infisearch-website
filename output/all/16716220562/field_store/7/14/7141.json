LEAFY J. CORRINGTON.   Two genera, _Peltigera_ and _Nephroma_, constitute the _Peltigeraceae_ as represented in the flora of Ohio. The thallus is plainly foliose with the margins of the lobes usually ascending and is gray-green to brown in color. The lower surface is often conspicuously veined. There are two pronounced distinctions between the two genera. _Peltigera_ has a well-developed cortex on the upper side of the thallus only (Fig. 1), while in _Nephroma_ there is a well-developed cortex on both upper and lower sides (Fig. 2).  The position of the apothecia constitutes another distinction. In both genera the apothecia are marginal or submarginal on the lobes, which are usually narrow and somewhat extended; but in _Peltigera_ they are immersed in the upper surface, while in _Nephroma_ they are imbedded in the lower surface.  _Peltigera_ furnishes seven species for Ohio, while only one species of _Nephroma_ has thus far been found in the State.  The algal hosts are usually _Dactylococcus_ or _Polycoccus_, and both hosts are sometimes found in the same thallus. The chains of cells are usually badly broken up, and the nature of the algal host is, therefore, difficult to distinguish. Other algae doubtless sometimes occur in the thalli of _Peltigerae_.  _Nephroma_ with cortex on both sides, is to be regarded higher than _Peltigera_, which has the cortex on the upper side only. The family is most closely related to the _Stictaceae_, from which family it is kept distinct on account of the absence of cyphellae and the difference in disposition of the apothecia.  The collecting on which this paper is based was partly by Bruce Fink in connection with general collecting of fungi in Butler County and in collecting in Adams, Warren, Fairfield, Preble, Ross, Highland, and Lake counties for the Ohio Biological Survey. However, a considerable amount of material found by other collectors and previously reported from Ohio was examined. Hence, the collecting for the Ohio Biological Survey added little to knowledge of the _Peltigeraceae_ of Ohio, except in way of addition to distribution in the State.  [Footnote B: Contributions from the Botanical Laboratory of Miami University--XIX]     _Systematic Account._  PELTIGERACEAE   Thallus foliose, with plectenchymatous cortex above (Fig. 5), or both above and below (Fig. 2), with medulla of loosely interwoven hyphae, trichomatic hyphae, usually present, attached to the substratum by compound rhizoids; apothecia of considerable size, commonly on extended lobes, usually imbedded in the tissues on the upper side, or more rarely on the lower side; exciple inconspicuous; hypothecium usually light or darker brown; hymenium usually pale below and brown or tinged brown above; paraphyses simple or branched, distinct, seldom gelatinized or coherent; spores hyaline or brown, 4- to several-celled, elongated.   KEY TO THE GENERA  1. Cortex developed on the upper side of thallus only,   spores hyaline                                            Peltigera.  2. Cortex developed on both upper and lower sides of   thallus, spores brown                                      Nephroma.     _Peltigera Willd. Fl. Berol. Prodr. 347. 1787._  Thallus foliose, usually adnate toward the center, with the lobes more or less ascending at the margins, green-gray varying toward brown, the upper surface sometimes bare, or again clothed with trichomatic hyphae, giving it a downy appearance, or bearing cephalodia or isidioid branchlets, the lower surface usually conspicuously veined, with tufted rhizoids descending from the veins, color of these light or dark; cross section showing two distinct layers, the upper plectenchymatous cortex composed of 2 to 4 layers of meshes, and the medulla, composed of densely interwoven and irregularly disposed hyphae; lower cortex lacking, but the hyphae of the lower portion in some instances more or less horizontally arranged and produced into hyphal rhizoids, thus serving for support and protection much like a true plectenchymatous cortex; apothecia usually orbicular, frequently revolute, imbedded in the upper surface of the lobes; exciple plectenchymatous (Fig. 4); hypothecium of interwoven hyphae, usually tinged brown; hymenium commonly pale below and brown above; paraphyses usually simple, but some branched ones present in all of the species, hyaline in the main, but usually enlarged and tinged brown at the apex; asci usually cylindrico-clavate; spores hyaline, fusiform to acicular, sometimes curved, 4 to 8-celled, 8 arranged parallel in the asci.  The algal host cells lie in the medulla, just below the upper cortex.   KEY TO THE SPECIES OF PELTIGERA  Upper surface of the thallus bearing cephalodia             1.
