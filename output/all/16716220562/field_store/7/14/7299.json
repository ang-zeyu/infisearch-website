'In a few cases, in which the Tarantula was under no misapprehension    as to the trap which I was setting for her, I was not a little    surprised, when I pushed the stalk far enough down to twist it round    her hiding-place, to see her play with the spikelet more or less    contemptuously and push it away with her legs, without troubling to    retreat to the back of her lair.     'The Apulian peasants, according to Baglivi's {4} account, also hunt    the Tarantula by imitating the humming of an insect with an oat-stalk    at the entrance to her burrow.  I quote the passage:     '\"_Ruricolae nostri quando eas captare volunt, ad illorum latibula    accedunt, tenuisque avenacae fistulae sonum, apum murmuri non    absimilem, modulantur.  Quo audito, ferox exit Tarentula ut muscas vel    alia hujus modi insecta, quorum murmur esse putat, captat; captatur    tamen ista a rustico insidiatore_.\" {5}     'The Tarantula, so dreadful at first sight, especially when we are    filled with the idea that her bite is dangerous, so fierce in    appearance, is nevertheless quite easy to tame, as I have often found    by experiment.     'On the 7th of May 1812, while at Valencia, in Spain, I caught a fair-    sized male Tarantula, without hurting him, and imprisoned him in a    glass jar, with a paper cover in which I cut a trap-door.  At the    bottom of the jar I put a paper bag, to serve as his habitual    residence.  I placed the jar on a table in my bedroom, so as to have    him under frequent observation.  He soon grew accustomed to captivity    and ended by becoming so familiar that he would come and take from my    fingers the live Fly which I gave him.  After killing his victim with    the fangs of his mandibles, he was not satisfied, like most Spiders,    to suck her head: he chewed her whole body, shoving it piecemeal into    his mouth with his palpi, after which he threw up the masticated    teguments and swept them away from his lodging.     'Having finished his meal, he nearly always made his toilet, which    consisted in brushing his palpi and mandibles, both inside and out,    with his front tarsi.  After that, he resumed his air of motionless    gravity.  The evening and the night were his time for taking his walks    abroad.  I often heard him scratching the paper of the bag.  These    habits confirm the opinion, which I have already expressed elsewhere,    that most Spiders have the faculty of seeing by day and night, like    cats.     'On the 28th of June, my Tarantula cast his skin.  It was his last    moult and did not perceptibly alter either the colour of his attire or    the dimensions of his body.  On the 14th of July, I had to leave    Valencia; and I stayed away until the 23rd.  During this time, the    Tarantula fasted; I found him looking quite well on my return.  On the    20th of August, I again left for a nine days' absence, which my    prisoner bore without food and without detriment to his health.  On    the 1st of October, I once more deserted the Tarantula, leaving him    without provisions.  On the 21st, I was fifty miles from Valencia and,    as I intended to remain there, I sent a servant to fetch him.  I was    sorry to learn that he was not found in the jar, and I never heard    what became of him.     'I will end my observations on the Tarantulae with a short description    of a curious fight between those animals.  One day, when I had had a    successful hunt after these Lycosae, I picked out two full-grown and    very powerful males and brought them together in a wide jar, in order    to enjoy the sight of a combat to the death.  After walking round the    arena several times, to try and avoid each other, they were not slow    in placing themselves in a warlike attitude, as though at a given    signal.  I saw them, to my surprise, take their distances and sit up    solemnly on their hind-legs, so as mutually to present the shield of    their chests to each other.  After watching them face to face like    that for two minutes, during which they had doubtless provoked each    other by glances that escaped my own, I saw them fling themselves upon    each other at the same time, twisting their legs round each other and    obstinately struggling to bite each other with the fangs of the    mandibles.  Whether from fatigue or from convention, the combat was    suspended; there was a few seconds' truce; and each athlete moved away    and resumed his threatening posture.  This circumstance reminded me    that, in the strange fights between cats, there are also suspensions    of hostilities.  But the contest was soon renewed between my two    Tarantulae with increased fierceness.  One of them, after holding    victory in the balance for a while, was at last thrown and received a    mortal wound in the head.  He became the prey of the conqueror, who    tore open his skull and devoured it.  After this curious duel, I kept    the victorious Tarantula alive for several weeks.'  My district does not boast the ordinary Tarantula, the Spider whose habits have been described above by the Wizard of the Landes; but it possesses an equivalent in the shape of the Black-bellied Tarantula, or Narbonne Lycosa, half the size of the other, clad in black velvet on the lower surface, especially under the belly, with brown chevrons on the abdomen and grey and white rings around the legs.  Her favourite home is the dry, pebbly ground, covered with sun-scorched thyme.  In my _harmas_ {6} laboratory there are quite twenty of this Spider's burrows.  Rarely do I pass by one of these haunts without giving a glance down the pit where gleam, like diamonds, the four great eyes, the four telescopes, of the hermit.  The four others, which are much smaller, are not visible at that depth.  Would I have greater riches, I have but to walk a hundred yards from my house, on the neighbouring plateau, once a shady forest, to-day a dreary solitude where the Cricket browses and the Wheat-ear flits from stone to stone.  The love of lucre has laid waste the land.  Because wine paid handsomely, they pulled up the forest to plant the vine.  Then came the Phylloxera, the vine-stocks perished and the once green table-land is now no more than a desolate stretch where a few tufts of hardy grasses sprout among the pebbles.  This waste-land is the Lycosa's paradise: in an hour's time, if need were, I should discover a hundred burrows within a limited range.  These dwellings are pits about a foot deep, perpendicular at first and then bent elbow-wise.  The average diameter is an inch.  On the edge of the hole stands a kerb, formed of straw, bits and scraps of all sorts and even small pebbles, the size of a hazel-nut.  The whole is kept in place and cemented with silk.  Often, the Spider confines herself to drawing together the dry blades of the nearest grass, which she ties down with the straps from her spinnerets, without removing the blades from the stems; often, also, she rejects this scaffolding in favour of a masonry constructed of small stones.  The nature of the kerb is decided by the nature of the materials within the Lycosa's reach, in the close neighbourhood of the building-yard.  There is no selection: everything meets with approval, provided that it be near at hand.  Economy of time, therefore, causes the defensive wall to vary greatly as regards its constituent elements.  The height varies also.  One enclosure is a turret an inch high; another amounts to a mere rim.  All have their parts bound firmly together with silk; and all have the same width as the subterranean channel, of which they are the extension.  There is here no difference in diameter between the underground manor and its outwork, nor do we behold, at the opening, the platform which the turret leaves to give free play to the Italian Tarantula's legs.  The Black-bellied Tarantula's work takes the form of a well surmounted by its kerb.  When the soil is earthy and homogeneous, the architectural type is free from obstructions and the Spider's dwelling is a cylindrical tube; but, when the site is pebbly, the shape is modified according to the exigencies of the digging.  In the second case, the lair is often a rough, winding cave, at intervals along whose inner wall stick blocks of stone avoided in the process of excavation.  Whether regular or irregular, the house is plastered to a certain depth with a coat of silk, which prevents earth-slips and facilitates scaling when a prompt exit is required.  Baglivi, in his unsophisticated Latin, teaches us how to catch the Tarantula.  I became his _rusticus insidiator_;  I waved a spikelet at the entrance of the burrow to imitate the humming of a Bee and attract the attention of the Lycosa, who rushes out, thinking that she is capturing a prey.  This method did not succeed with me.  The Spider, it is true, leaves her remote apartments and comes a little way up the vertical tube to enquire into the sounds at her door; but the wily animal soon scents a trap; it remains motionless at mid-height and, at the least alarm, goes down again to the branch gallery, where it is invisible.  Leon Dufour's appears to me a better method if it were only practicable in the conditions wherein I find myself.  To drive a knife quickly into the ground, across the burrow, so as to cut off the Tarantula's retreat when she is attracted by the spikelet and standing on the upper floor, would be a manoeuvre certain of success, if the soil were favourable. Unfortunately, this is not so in my case: you might as well try to dig a knife into a block of tufa.  Other stratagems become necessary.  Here are two which were successful: I recommend them to future Tarantula-hunters.  I insert into the burrow, as far down as I can, a stalk with a fleshy spikelet, which the Spider can bite into.  I move and turn and twist my bait.  The Tarantula, when touched by the intruding"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1887"],["title","The Life of the Spider (#2)"],["body","dy, contemplates self-defence and bites the spikelet.  A slight resistance informs my fingers that the animal has fallen into the trap and seized the tip of the stalk in its fangs.  I draw it to me, slowly, carefully; the Spider hauls from below, planting her legs against the wall.  It comes, it rises.  I hide as best I may, when the Spider enters the perpendicular tunnel: if she saw me, she would let go the bait and slip down again.  I thus bring her, by degrees, to the orifice.  This is the difficult moment.  If I continue the gentle movement, the Spider, feeling herself dragged out of her home, would at once run back indoors.  It is impossible to get the suspicious animal out by this means.  Therefore, when it appears at the level of the ground, I give a sudden pull.  Surprised by this foul play, the Tarantula has no time to release her hold; gripping the spikelet, she is thrown some inches away from the burrow.  Her capture now becomes an easy matter. Outside her own house, the Lycosa is timid, as though scared, and hardly capable of running away.  To push her with a straw into a paper bag is the affair of a second.  It requires some patience to bring the Tarantula who has bitten into the insidious spikelet to the entrance of the burrow.  The following method is quicker: I procure a supply of live Bumble-bees.  I put one into a little bottle with a mouth just wide enough to cover the opening of the burrow; and I turn the apparatus thus baited over the said opening.  The powerful Bee at first flutters and hums about her glass prison; then, perceiving a burrow similar to that of her family, she enters it without much hesitation.  She is extremely ill-advised: while she goes down, the Spider comes up; and the meeting takes place in the perpendicular passage.  For a few moments, the ear perceives a sort of death-song: it is the humming of the Bumble-bee, protesting against the reception given her.  This is followed by a long silence.  Then I remove the bottle and dip a long-jawed forceps into the pit.  I withdraw the Bumble-bee, motionless, dead, with hanging proboscis.  A terrible tragedy must have happened.  The Spider follows, refusing to let go so rich a booty.  Game and huntress are brought to the orifice.  Sometimes, mistrustful, the Lycosa goes in again; but we have only to leave the Bumble-bee on the threshold of the door, or even a few inches away, to see her reappear, issue from her fortress and daringly recapture her prey.  This is the moment: the house is closed with the finger, or a pebble and, as Baglivi says, '_captatur tamen ista a rustico insidiatore_,' to which I will add, '_adjuvante Bombo_.' {7}  The object of these hunting methods was not exactly to obtain Tarantulae; I had not the least wish to rear the Spider in a bottle.  I was interested in a different matter.  Here, thought I, is an ardent huntress, living solely by her trade.  She does not prepare preserved foodstuffs for her offspring; {8} she herself feeds on the prey which she catches.  She is not a 'paralyzer,' {9} who cleverly spares her quarry so as to leave it a glimmer of life and keep it fresh for weeks at a time; she is a killer, who makes a meal off her capture on the spot.  With her, there is no methodical vivisection, which destroys movement without entirely destroying life, but absolute death, as sudden as possible, which protects the assailant from the counter-attacks of the assailed.  Her game, moreover, is essentially bulky and not always of the most peaceful character.  This Diana, ambushed in her tower, needs a prey worthy of her prowess.  The big Grasshopper, with the powerful jaws; the irascible Wasp; the Bee, the Bumble-bee and other wearers of poisoned daggers must fall into the ambuscade from time to time.  The duel is nearly equal in point of weapons.  To the venomous fangs of the Lycosa the Wasp opposes her venomous stiletto.  Which of the two bandits shall have the best of it?  The struggle is a hand-to-hand one.  The Tarantula has no secondary means of defence, no cord to bind her victim, no trap to subdue her.  When the Epeira, or Garden Spider, sees an insect entangled in her great upright web, she hastens up and covers the captive with corded meshes and silk ribbons by the armful, making all resistance impossible.  When the prey is solidly bound, a prick is carefully administered with the poison-fangs; then the Spider retires, waiting for the death-throes to calm down, after which the huntress comes back to the game.  In these conditions, there is no serious danger.  In the case of the Lycosa, the job is riskier.  She has naught to serve her but her courage and her fangs and is obliged to leap upon the formidable prey, to master it by her dexterity, to annihilate it, in a measure, by her swift-slaying talent.  Annihilate is the word: the Bumble-bees whom I draw from the fatal hole are a sufficient proof.  As soon as that shrill buzzing, which I called the death-song, ceases, in vain I hasten to insert my forceps: I always bring out the insect dead, with slack proboscis and limp legs.  Scarce a few quivers of those legs tell me that it is a quite recent corpse.  The Bumble-bee's death is instantaneous.  Each time that I take a fresh victim from the terrible slaughter-house, my surprise is renewed at the sight of its sudden immobility.  Nevertheless, both animals have very nearly the same strength; for I choose my Bumble-bees from among the largest (_Bombus hortorum_ and _B. terrestris_).  Their weapons are almost equal: the Bee's dart can bear comparison with the Spider's fangs; the sting of the first seems to me as formidable as the bite of the second.  How comes it that the Tarantula always has the upper hand and this moreover in a very short conflict, whence she emerges unscathed?  There must certainly be some cunning strategy on her part.  Subtle though her poison may be, I cannot believe that its mere injection, at any point whatever of the victim, is enough to produce so prompt a catastrophe.  The ill-famed rattlesnake does not kill so quickly, takes hours to achieve that for which the Tarantula does not require a second.  We must, therefore, look for an explanation of this sudden death to the vital importance of the point attacked by the Spider, rather than to the virulence of the poison.  What is this point?  It is impossible to recognize it on the Bumble-bees. They enter the burrow; and the murder is committed far from sight.  Nor does the lens discover any wound upon the corpse, so delicate are the weapons that produce it.  One would have to see the two adversaries engage in a direct contest.  I have often tried to place a Tarantula and a Bumble-bee face to face in the same bottle.  The two animals mutually flee each other, each being as much upset as the other at its captivity. I have kept them together for twenty-four hours, without aggressive display on either side.  Thinking more of their prison than of attacking each other, they temporize, as though indifferent.  The experiment has always been fruitless.  I have succeeded with Bees and Wasps, but the murder has been committed at night and has taught me nothing.  I would find both insects, next morning, reduced to a jelly under the Spider's mandibles.  A weak prey is a mouthful which the Spider reserves for the calm of the night.  A prey capable of resistance is not attacked in captivity.  The prisoner's anxiety cools the hunter's ardour.  The arena of a large bottle enables each athlete to keep out of the other's way, respected by her adversary, who is respected in her turn. Let us reduce the lists, diminish the enclosure.  I put Bumble-bee and Tarantula into a test-tube that has only room for one at the bottom.  A lively brawl ensues, without serious results.  If the Bumble-bee be underneath, she lies down on her back and with her legs wards off the other as much as she can.  I do not see her draw her sting.  The Spider, meanwhile, embracing the whole circumference of the enclosure with her long legs, hoists herself a little upon the slippery surface and removes herself as far as possible from her adversary.  There, motionless, she awaits events, which are soon disturbed by the fussy Bumble-bee.  Should the latter occupy the upper position, the Tarantula protects herself by drawing up her legs, which keep the enemy at a distance.  In short, save for sharp scuffles when the two champions are in touch, nothing happens that deserves attention.  There is no duel to the death in the narrow arena of the test-tube, any more than in the wider lists afforded by the bottle.  Utterly timid once she is away from home, the Spider obstinately refuses the battle; nor will the Bumble-bee, giddy though she be, think of striking the first blow.  I abandon experiments in my study.  We must go direct to the spot and force the duel upon the Tarantula, who is full of pluck in her own stronghold.  Only, instead of the Bumble-bee, who enters the burrow and conceals her death from our eyes, it is necessary to substitute another adversary, less inclined to penetrate underground.  There abounds in the garden, at this moment, on the flowers of the common clary, one of the largest and most powerful Bees that haunt my district, the Carpenter-bee (_Xylocopa violacea_), clad in black velvet, with wings of purple gauze.  Her size, which is nearly an inch, exceeds that of the Bumble-bee.  Her sting is excruciating and produces a swelling that long continues painful.  I have very exact memories on this subject, memories that have cost me dear.  Here indeed is an antagonist worthy of the Tarantula, if I succeed in inducing the Spider to accept her.  I place a certain number, one by one, in bottles small in capacity, but having a wide neck capable of surrounding the entrance to the burrow.  As the prey which I am about to offer is capable of overawing the huntress, I select from among the Tarantulae the lustiest, the boldest, those most stimulated by hunger.  The"]]]
