The main-line engine she's built for speed as well as power. That's one to the 9.15 up.”  “The Green Dragon,” said Phyllis.  “We calls her the Snail, Miss, among ourselves,” said the Porter. “She's oftener be'ind'and nor any train on the line.”  “But the engine's green,” said Phyllis.  “Yes, Miss,” said Perks, “so's a snail some seasons o' the year.”  The children agreed as they went home to dinner that the Porter was most delightful company.  Next day was Roberta's birthday. In the afternoon she was politely but firmly requested to get out of the way and keep there till tea-time.  “You aren't to see what we're going to do till it's done; it's a glorious surprise,” said Phyllis.  And Roberta went out into the garden all alone. She tried to be grateful, but she felt she would much rather have helped in whatever it was than have to spend her birthday afternoon by herself, no matter how glorious the surprise might be.  Now that she was alone, she had time to think, and one of the things she thought of most was what mother had said in one of those feverish nights when her hands were so hot and her eyes so bright.  The words were: “Oh, what a doctor's bill there'll be for this!”  She walked round and round the garden among the rose-bushes that hadn't any roses yet, only buds, and the lilac bushes and syringas and American currants, and the more she thought of the doctor's bill, the less she liked the thought of it.  And presently she made up her mind. She went out through the side door of the garden and climbed up the steep field to where the road runs along by the canal. She walked along until she came to the bridge that crosses the canal and leads to the village, and here she waited. It was very pleasant in the sunshine to lean one's elbows on the warm stone of the bridge and look down at the blue water of the canal. Bobbie had never seen any other canal, except the Regent's Canal, and the water of that is not at all a pretty colour. And she had never seen any river at all except the Thames, which also would be all the better if its face was washed.  Perhaps the children would have loved the canal as much as the railway, but for two things. One was that they had found the railway FIRST--on that first, wonderful morning when the house and the country and the moors and rocks and great hills were all new to them. They had not found the canal till some days later. The other reason was that everyone on the railway had been kind to them--the Station Master, the Porter, and the old gentleman who waved. And the people on the canal were anything but kind.  The people on the canal were, of course, the bargees, who steered the slow barges up and down, or walked beside the old horses that trampled up the mud of the towing-path, and strained at the long tow-ropes.  Peter had once asked one of the bargees the time, and had been told to “get out of that,” in a tone so fierce that he did not stop to say anything about his having just as much right on the towing-path as the man himself. Indeed, he did not even think of saying it till some time later.  Then another day when the children thought they would like to fish in the canal, a boy in a barge threw lumps of coal at them, and one of these hit Phyllis on the back of the neck. She was just stooping down to tie up her bootlace--and though the coal hardly hurt at all it made her not care very much about going on fishing.  On the bridge, however, Roberta felt quite safe, because she could look down on the canal, and if any boy showed signs of meaning to throw coal, she could duck behind the parapet.  Presently there was a sound of wheels, which was just what she expected.  The wheels were the wheels of the Doctor's dogcart, and in the cart, of course, was the Doctor.  He pulled up, and called out:--  “Hullo, head nurse! Want a lift?”  “I wanted to see you,” said Bobbie.  “Your mother's not worse, I hope?” said the Doctor.  “No--but--”  “Well, skip in, then, and we'll go for a drive.”  Roberta climbed in and the brown horse was made to turn round--which it did not like at all, for it was looking forward to its tea--I mean its oats.  “This IS jolly,” said Bobbie, as the dogcart flew along the road by the canal.  “We could throw a stone down any one of your three chimneys,” said the Doctor, as they passed the house.  “Yes,” said Bobbie, “but you'd have to be a jolly good shot.”  “How do you know I'm not?” said the Doctor. “Now, then, what's the trouble?”  Bobbie fidgeted with the hook of the driving apron.  “Come, out with it,” said the Doctor.  “It's rather hard, you see,” said Bobbie, “to out with it; because of what Mother said.”  “What DID Mother say?”  “She said I wasn't to go telling everyone that we're poor. But you aren't everyone, are you?”  “Not at all,” said the Doctor, cheerfully. “Well?”  “Well, I know doctors are very extravagant--I mean expensive, and Mrs. Viney told me that her doctoring only cost her twopence a week because she belonged to a Club.”  “Yes?”  “You see she told me what a good doctor you were, and I asked her how she could afford you, because she's much poorer than we are. I've been in her house and I know. And then she told me about the Club, and I thought I'd ask you--and--oh, I don't want Mother to be worried! Can't we be in the Club, too, the same as Mrs. Viney?”  The Doctor was silent. He was rather poor himself, and he had been pleased at getting a new family to attend. So I think his feelings at that minute were rather mixed.  “You aren't cross with me, are you?” said Bobbie, in a very small voice.  The Doctor roused himself.  “Cross? How could I be? You're a very sensible little woman. Now look here, don't you worry. I'll make it all right with your Mother, even if I have to make a special brand-new Club all for her. Look here, this is where the Aqueduct begins.”  “What's an Aque--what's its name?” asked Bobbie.  “A water bridge,” said the Doctor. “Look.”  The road rose to a bridge over the canal. To the left was a steep rocky cliff with trees and shrubs growing in the cracks of the rock. And the canal here left off running along the top of the hill and started to run on a bridge of its own--a great bridge with tall arches that went right across the valley.  Bobbie drew a long breath.  “It IS grand, isn't it?” she said. “It's like pictures in the History of Rome.”  “Right!” said the Doctor, “that's just exactly what it IS like. The Romans were dead nuts on aqueducts. It's a splendid piece of engineering.”  “I thought engineering was making engines.”  “Ah, there are different sorts of engineering--making road and bridges and tunnels is one kind. And making fortifications is another. Well, we must be turning back. And, remember, you aren't to worry about doctor's bills or you'll be ill yourself, and then I'll send you in a bill as long as the aqueduct.”  When Bobbie had parted from the Doctor at the top of the field that ran down from the road to Three Chimneys, she could not feel that she had done wrong. She knew that Mother would perhaps think differently. But Bobbie felt that for once she was the one who was right, and she scrambled down the rocky slope with a really happy feeling.  Phyllis and Peter met her at the back door. They were unnaturally clean and neat, and Phyllis had a red bow in her hair. There was only just time for Bobbie to make herself tidy and tie up her hair with a blue bow before a little bell rang.  “There!” said Phyllis, “that's to show the surprise is ready. Now you wait till the bell rings again and then you may come into the dining-room.”  So Bobbie waited.  “Tinkle, tinkle,” said the little bell, and Bobbie went into the dining-room, feeling rather shy. Directly she opened the door she found herself, as it seemed, in a new world of light and flowers and singing. Mother and Peter and Phyllis were standing in a row at the end of the table. The shutters were shut and there were twelve candles on the table, one for each of Roberta's years. The table was covered with a sort of pattern of flowers, and at Roberta's place was a thick wreath of forget-me-nots and several most interesting little packages. And Mother and Phyllis and Peter were singing--to the first part of the tune of St. Patrick's Day. Roberta knew that Mother had written the words on purpose for her birthday. It was a little way of Mother's on birthdays. It had begun on Bobbie's fourth birthday when Phyllis was a baby. Bobbie remembered learning the verses to say to Father 'for a surprise.' She wondered if Mother had remembered, too. The four-year-old verse had been:--       Daddy dear, I'm only four      And I'd rather not be more.      Four's the nicest age to be,      Two and two and one and three.      What I love is two and two,      Mother, Peter, Phil, and you.      What you love is one and three,      Mother, Peter, Phil, and me.      Give your little girl a kiss      Because she learned and told you this.  The song the others were singing now went like this:--       Our darling Roberta,      No sorrow shall hurt her      If we can prevent it         Her whole life long.      Her birthday's our fete day,      We'll make it our great day,      And give her our presents         And sing her our song.      May pleasures attend her      And may the Fates send her      The happiest journey         Along her life's way.      With skies bright above her      And dear ones to love her!      Dear Bob!  Many happy         Returns of the day!  When they had finished singing they cried, “Three cheers for our Bobbie!” and gave them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry--you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin they were all kissing and hugging her.  “Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.”  They were very nice presents.

A TEXT-BOOK OF ASSAYING: FOR THE USE OF THOSE CONNECTED WITH MINES.  by  C. AND J. J. BERINGER.  Revised by  J. J.

With numerous Diagrams and Tables.  Ninth Edition.        London: Charles Griffin and Company, Limited, Exeter Street, Strand. 1904. [All rights reserved.]     PUBLISHER'S NOTE TO THE NINTH EDITION   The continued popularity of the present work, the last edition of which was published only a little over a year ago, continues to be a source of gratification to the publishers, who have much pleasure in issuing the present edition.  _January 1904._   PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION  The principal changes in this edition are additions to the articles on Gold, Cyanides, and Nickel, and a much enlarged Index. The additional matter covers more than forty pages.  J. J. BERINGER.  CAMBORNE, _January 1900._     PREFACE.   The Text-book now offered to the public has been prepared to meet the existing want of a practical \"handy book\" for the Assayer.  To mining men the word \"assaying\" conveys a sufficiently clear meaning, but it is difficult to define. Some writers limit it to the determination of silver and gold, and others imagine that it has only to do with \"furnace-work.\" These limitations are not recognised in practice. In fact, assaying is becoming wider in its scope, and the distinction between \"assayers\" and \"analysts\" will in time be difficult to detect. We have endeavoured rather to give what will be of use to the assayer than to cover the ground within the limits of a faulty definition.  At first our intention was to supply a description of those substances only which have a commercial value, but on consideration we have added short accounts of the rarer elements, since they are frequently met with, and occasionally affect the accuracy of an assay.  Under the more important methods we have given the results of a series of experiments showing the effect of varying conditions on the accuracy of the process. Such experiments are often made by assayers, but seldom recorded. Statements like those generally made--that \"this or that substance interferes\"--are insufficient. It is necessary to know under what conditions and to what extent.  Students learning any particular process cannot do better than repeat such a series of experiments. By this means they will, at the same time, acquire the skill necessary for performing an assay and a confidence in their results based upon work under different conditions.  The electrolytic method of copper assaying given under _Copper_ is a modification of Luckow's; it was introduced by us into the offices of the Rio Tinto Copper Company, and has been in use for many years with success. This modification is now employed in copper-works in Spain, Germany, and England, and is used in place of the dry assay for the commercial valuation of copper ores.  We have adhered to the gram and the \"c.c.\" as the units of weight and volume. Those who prefer working with grains and grain-measures can use the figures given, multiplied by ten. For example:--When 1 gram is mentioned, 10 grains should be used, and 10 grain-measures take the place of 1 \"c.c.\" It is not advisable to mix the two systems, as by using gram weights and grain-measures.  We have intentionally to a large extent omitted to mention the names of those who have originated or modified the various processes. The practice of naming a process after its discoverer has developed of late years, and is becoming objectionable. It is a graceful thing to name a gas-burner after Bunsen, or a condenser after Liebig; but when the practice has developed so far that one is directed to \"Finkenerise\" a residue, or to use the \"Reichert-Meissl-Wollny\" process, it is time to stop.  We are indebted to the standard works of Allen, Crookes, Fresenius, Lunge, Michell, Percy, and Sutton, and wish to express our sense of special indebtedness to Mr. Richard Smith, of the Royal School of Mines. One or two of the illustrations are taken from Mr. Sexton's excellent little book on _Qualitative Analysis_. Our obligation to some others is mentioned in the text.  Finally, we have to thank for assistance in the experimental work Messrs. Bailey, Beswick, Clarke, Grant, Higgins, and Smith.  THE AUTHORS.  CAMBORNE, _Nov. 1889_.     CONTENTS.   PART I.
