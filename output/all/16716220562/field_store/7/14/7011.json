When they finally rose to go the farmer's wife brought out a plate of cookies which she urged them to take along to eat on the road.  She stood looking after them for a long time as they trudged along in the yellow dust.  \"I wish I could go along with 'em, over the hills,\" she exclaimed suddenly to the unheeding hens that were walking up and down the steps, \"I'm tired of staying at home and doing the same things over and over again.  I wish I could go along too!\"  Chapa and Gladys, following the blazes through the woods, found their path barred at one place by a rather wide brook. The trail was marked again on the other side.  \"How are we going to get across?\" asked Gladys.  \"Wade through,\" said Chapa, briefly, sitting down and commencing to pull off her shoes and stockings.  Gladys put her hand into the water and shook her head.  \"It's too cold,\" she said, drawing back.  \"No, it isn't,\" said Chapa, \"the rest went through it.  Come on, you'll be all right.\"  Stuffing her stockings into her shoes, she threw them to the farther bank, and then stepping into the swift little stream she waded across calmly.  Gladys hesitated for several minutes before she could make up her mind to put her feet in the water, but finally, encouraged by Chapa, she stepped gingerly in.  \"Be careful of the rocks, they're slippery,\" warned Chapa, but the warning was hardly out of her mouth when Gladys slipped on one of the smooth stones and sat down with a mighty splash. Chapa flew to the rescue and pulled her out on the bank.  \"What will I do?\" wailed Gladys, \"I can't go on with these wet bloomers.\"  \"Wear my bathing suit,\" suggested Chapa, untying it from around her waist where she had been wearing it as a sort of sash, with all her impedimenta stuck into the folds.  So Gladys changed to the bathing suit, and Chapa fixed the wet bloomers on a stick which they could carry between them, so they would be dry by the time they reached the night's encampment.  \"We ought to be pretty near the end of our journey,\" said Nyoda to Medmangi, at about half-past four in the afternoon.  \"Have you caught sight of Balsam Lake yet?\"  Medmangi shook her head.  \"The woods are too thick to see anything through,\" she answered.  \"Let's call,\" said Nyoda. Together they raised their hands to their mouths and sent out the long, yodling call of the Camp Fire Girls, and then stood silent, listening.  Before the echoes had ceased coming out of the woods the call was answered from somewhere beyond the trees.  \"We're nearly there!\" said Nyoda, and they quickened their pace as they went through the last strip of woods.  Soon they heard voices and saw figures moving about in the distance, and presently they came upon the rest of the girls on the shore of the tiny lake.  Some of the girls were lying at full length on the soft ground; others were preparing supper.  Hinpoha was chopping wood with her hatchet; Sahwah was shaving chocolate with hers.  The fire was built close to the water's edge and the firelight shone out redly across the water.  Migwan set a can of beans in the embers to warm, then she sat down on the beach to enjoy the view.  The late afternoon sun was pouring its full glory on the lake, making its surface one dazzling sheet of light.  Migwan shaded her eyes with her hand, and drank in the splendor of the scene with all her beauty-loving soul.  \"Now I know how Scott felt when he wrote:      \"One burnished sheet of living gold,     Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled,\"'  mused Migwan, and fell to dreaming dreams as golden as the setting sun.  Around the fire the tongues were wagging merrily.  \"We met a man with a wagon and he said, 'Jump in,' and we said, 'No, thank you,' and he said, 'Well, don't, then, ding it.'--\"  \"We ate our lunch beside a brook and Migwan dropped her sandwiches in and had bread soup--\"  \"We met a bull and Hinpoha climbed the fence into a field and there were two bulls in that field--\"  \"Nyoda sat down in a potato patch to tie her shoe and the farmer came out and yelled--\"  BANG!  There was a terrific explosion that scattered the firebrands among the girls and showered them with ashes and fragments of potatoes.  They sprang to their feet, extinguishing the fires that started in various places, and asking what had happened.  Nyoda's glance happened to fall on Hinpoha, who had sat nearest the fire.  The whole front of her middy was plastered with--_beans!_  On the ground by the fire lay the flattened remains of a tin can. Migwan had put the beans to heat without opening the can. Shrieks of laughter  arose when the truth dawned on the girls and it was many a day before they left off teasing Migwan about it.  The fire was built up again, bacon \"frizzled,\" and toast and cocoa made.  \"And my mouth was just watering for baked potatoes,\" wailed Hinpoha.  \"And mine for baked beans,\" echoed Sahwah.  \"You shouldn't eat potatoes if you want to get thin,\" said Migwan.  \"Shouldn't I, Nyoda?\" asked Hinpoha, appealing to her guardian.  Nyoda pursed up her lips and recited with a judicial air:      \"If you would slimmer grow, my daughter,     Eat no starches, drink no water.\"  Sahwah then took up the tale:      \"Look not on the candy sweet,     Fall not for the fat of meat.\"  Thus it went round the circle, each girl pointing her finger at Hinpoha and reciting a couplet:      \"If your fat you'd wear away,     Exercise ten hours a day,\"      \"If you would grow thin and graceful,     Eat of lemons this whole caseful.\"      \"If you think that you're too large,     Swim ahead and tow the barge.\"      \"If you really would grow small,     Don't eat anything at all.\"  \"I think you're mean,\" said Hinpoha, wiping away mock tears. Immediately all the girls flung themselves on her, hugging and caressing her.  \"Never mind, 'Poha,\" they comforted, \"we love you anyhow.  We couldn't live without you.\"  \"Did anybody catch up with anybody else today?\" asked Sahwah. Nyoda and Medmangi sprang to their feet, and pointing scornfully at Chapa and Gladys, sang to the tune of \"Forsaken:      \"O'ertaken, o'ertaken, o'ertaken were they,     On a stone by the roadside they sat plain as day;     We sat down beside them and sang them this song,     Which caused them to rise up and travel along.\"  \"We made a song, too,\" cried Migwan and Hinpoha, springing to their feet. \"It's to the tune of 'Jingle Bells.'\"  And keeping time with their feet, they sang:      \"Marching through the woods,     Onward day by day,     Round the lake we go,     Singing all the way.     Packs strapped to our backs,     There our eats we stow,     Oh, what fun it is to hike     With the girls of Wohelo!      Wohelo, Wohelo,     Singing all the day,     O what fun it is to hike     Around the world away!\"  The girls joined in the chorus, and then went back to the beginning, and in a few minutes the song had been \"adopted for use.\"  By this time the fire was burning low and Nyoda reminded the girls that they had walked twelve miles that day and had a still longer tramp ahead on the morrow.  \"It doesn't seem possible that I've walked so far today,\" said Migwan, sitting up and stretching.  \"I'm not nearly as tired as I have been some days last winter after school.\"  The girls had all picked out their sleeping places before dark and made up their beds on the ground.  Before retiring they all took a dip in the lake, splashing around in the darkness and barking their shins on the rocks. Gladys and Chapa sought their beds first.  It was the first time that Gladys had ever slept on the ground.  \"There's a rock in my back and my feet are higher than my head,\" she wailed.  \"Then let's move,\" said Chapa, and suiting the action to the word, she picked up the bed and deposited it in another place. This was fairly comfortable and they subsided.  Next an uproar arose from a bed near the beach.  \"There's a million ants in my bed!\" shrieked Migwan, jumping up and shaking her blankets.  She had spread her bed on a colony of ant hills, and the ants had improved the shining hours until bedtime by crawling between the blankets.  Sahwah was the last in bed, having stayed in the water longer than the others.  She was strangely wakeful and lay for a long time staring up at the pines towering above her, that seemed to rise hundreds of feet before a branch appeared.  She amused herself by reaching out her hand and identifying her belongings, which hung on a bush at her head.  Her hand closed over the can of red paint.  Like lightning she had an inspiration. She raised her head and looked at the next bed.  \"It's Migwan,\" she said to herself.  Grasping the paint brush, she reached over and daubed the face of the sleeper.  Then she settled down and slept.  Gladys woke up in the gray dawn and looked out from her sandwich bed.  The lake was completely hidden by a thick mist.  Drops were coming down, patter, patter, on her poncho.  \"Chapa,\" she whispered excitedly to her partner, \"it's raining!\"  \"Well, what of it?\" answered Chapa, without opening her eyes, and pulling the poncho over their heads, she resumed her slumbers. Gladys drew a horrified breath at the idea of sleeping on the ground in the rain, but the cozy dryness of her bed soon wooed her back to slumber.  When she opened her eyes again the sun was rising over the lake.  No, there were two suns, one in the lake which was making it boil and send up clouds of steam, and another in the sky which was drawing up the vapor.

R. S., awoke with a start and discovered himself to be bathed in cold perspiration. The moonlight shone in at his window, but did not touch the bed, therefore his awakening could not be due to this cause. He lay for some time listening for any unfamiliar noise which might account for the sudden disturbance of his usually sound slumbers. In the house below nothing stirred. His windows were widely open and he could detect that vague drumming which is characteristic of midnight London; sometimes, too, the clashing of buffers upon some siding of the Brighton railway where shunting was in progress and occasional siren notes from the Thames. Otherwise--nothing.  He glanced at the luminous disk of his watch. The hour was half-past two. Dawn was not far off. The night seemed to have become almost intolerably hot, and to this heat Stuart felt disposed to ascribe both his awakening and also a feeling of uncomfortable tension of which he now became aware. He continued to listen, and, listening and hearing nothing, recognized with anger that he was frightened. A sense of some presence oppressed him. Someone or something evil was near him--perhaps in the room, veiled by the shadows. This uncanny sensation grew more and more marked.  Stuart sat up in bed, slowly and cautiously, looking all about him. He remembered to have awakened once thus in India--and to have found a great cobra coiled at his feet. His inspection revealed the presence of nothing unfamiliar, and he stepped out on to the floor.  A faint clicking sound reached his ears. He stood quite still. The clicking was repeated.  \"There is someone downstairs in my study!\" muttered Stuart.  He became aware that the fear which held him was such that unless he acted and acted swiftly he should become incapable of action, but he remembered that whereas the moonlight poured into the bedroom, the staircase would be in complete darkness. He walked barefooted across to the dressing-table and took up an electric torch which lay there. He had not used it for some time, and he pressed the button to learn if the torch was charged. A beam of white light shone out across the room, and at the same instant came another sound.  If it came from below or above, from the adjoining room or from  Outside in the road, Stuart knew not. But following hard upon the mysterious disturbance which had aroused him it seemed to pour ice into his veins, it added the complementary touch to his panic. For it was a kind of low wail--a ghostly minor wail in falling cadences--unlike any sound he had heard. It was so excessively horrible that it produced a curious effect.  Discovering from the dancing of the torch-ray that his hand was trembling, Stuart concluded that he had awakened from a nightmare and that this fiendish wailing was no more than an unusually delayed aftermath of the imaginary horrors which had bathed him in cold perspiration.  He walked resolutely to the door, threw it open and cast the beam of light on to the staircase. Softly he began to descend. Before the study door he paused. There was no sound. He threw open the door, directing the torch-ray into the room.  Cutting a white lane through the blackness, it  shone fully upon his writing-table, which was a rather fine Jacobean piece having a sort of quaint bureau superstructure containing cabinets and drawers. He could detect nothing unusual in the appearance of the littered table. A tobacco jar stood there, a pipe resting in the lid. Papers and books were scattered untidily as he had left them, surrounding a tray full of pipe and cigarette ash. Then, suddenly, he saw something else.  One of the bureau drawers was half opened.  Stuart stood quite still, staring at the table. There was no sound in the room. He crossed slowly, moving the light from right to left. His papers had been overhauled methodically. The drawers had been replaced, but he felt assured that all had been examined. The light switch was immediately beside the outer door, and Stuart walked over to it and switched on both lamps. Turning, he surveyed the brilliantly illuminated room. Save for himself, it was empty. He looked out into the hallway again. There was no one there. No sound broke the stillness. But that consciousness of some near presence asserted itself persistently and uncannily.  \"My nerves are out of order!\" he muttered. \"No one has touched my papers. I must have left the drawer open myself.\"  He switched off the light and walked across to the door. He had actually passed out intending to return to his room, when he became aware of a slight draught. He stopped.  Someone or something, evil and watchful, seemed to be very near again. Stuart turned and found himself gazing fearfully in the direction of the open study door. He became persuaded anew that someone was hiding there, and snatching up an ash stick which lay upon a chair in the hall he returned to the door. One step into the room he took and paused--palsied with a sudden fear which exceeded anything he had known.  A white casement curtain was drawn across the French windows ... and outlined upon this moon-bright screen he saw a tall figure. It was that of a _cowled man_!  Such an apparition would have been sufficiently alarming had the cowl been that of a monk, but the outline of this phantom being suggested that of one of the Misericordia brethren or the costume worn of old by the familiars of the Inquisition!  His heart leapt wildly, and seemed to grow still. He sought to cry out in his terror, but only emitted a dry gasping sound.  The psychology of panic is obscure and has been but imperfectly explored. The presence of the terrible cowled figure afforded a confirmation of Stuart's theory that he was the victim of a species of waking nightmare.  Even as he looked, the shadow of the cowled man moved--and was gone.  Stuart ran across the room, jerked open the curtains and stared out across the moon-bathed lawn, its prospect terminated by high privet hedges. One of the French windows was wide open. There was no one on the lawn; there was no sound.  \"Mrs. M'Gregor swears that I always forget to shut these windows at night!\" he muttered.  He closed and bolted the window, stood for a moment looking out across the empty lawn, then turned and went out of the room.     CHAPTER II  THE PIBROCH OF THE M'GREGORS   Dr. Stuart awoke in the morning and tried to recall what had occurred during the night. He consulted his watch and found the hour to be six a. m.  No one was stirring in the house, and he rose and put on a bath robe. He felt perfectly well and could detect no symptoms of nervous disorder. Bright sunlight was streaming into the room, and he went out on to the landing, fastening the cord of his gown as he descended the stairs.  His study door was locked, with the key outside. He remembered having locked it. Opening it, he entered and looked about him. He was vaguely  disappointed. Save for the untidy litter of papers upon the table, the study was as he had left it on retiring. If he could believe the evidence of his senses, nothing had been disturbed.  Not content with a casual inspection, he particularly examined those papers which, in his dream adventure, he had believed to have been submitted to mysterious inspection. They showed no signs of having been touched. The casement curtains were drawn across the recess formed by the French windows, and sunlight streamed in where, silhouetted against the pallid illumination of the moon, he had seen the man in the cowl. Drawing back the curtains, he examined the window fastenings. They were secure. If the window had really been open in the night, he must have left it so himself.  \"Well,\" muttered Stuart--\"of all the amazing nightmares!\"  He determined, immediately he had bathed and completed his toilet, to write an account of the dream for the Psychical Research Society, in whose work he was interested. Half an hour later, as the movements of an awakened household began to proclaim themselves, he sat down at his writing-table and commenced to write.  Keppel Stuart was a dark, good-looking man of about thirty-two, an easy-going bachelor who, whilst not over ambitious, was nevertheless a brilliant physician. He had worked for the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and had spent several years in India studying snake poisons. His purchase of this humdrum suburban practice had been dictated by a desire to make a home for a girl who at the eleventh hour had declined to share it. Two years had elapsed since then, but the shadow still lay upon Stuart's life, its influence being revealed in a certain apathy, almost indifference, which"]]]
