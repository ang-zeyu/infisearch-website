(_Page 62_)]  Rabbit in her severest tone. \"You know very well that Farmer Green raises these cabbages for home use only.\"  \"Well,\" said Jimmy Rabbit, \"I'll make myself at home here, then.\" And turning a cold shoulder on Henrietta Hen he began nibbling at a cabbage-leaf once more.  Henrietta felt quite helpless. Somehow nothing she could say to the intruder seemed to have the slightest effect on him. And he appeared to be enjoying his luncheon so thoroughly that it made Henrietta Hen very hungry just to see him eat. In spite of herself she couldn't resist joining him at luncheon.  \"Ah!\" he exclaimed between mouthfuls, \"I see you're making yourself at home, too.\"  Henrietta Hen tried to look very dignified. She pecked at the cabbage in an absent-minded fashion, pretending that it was no treat to her. As a matter of fact, she had been trying to get a taste of cabbage for a long while. And this was the first time she had managed to crawl through the garden fence. \"One has to eat something,\" she murmured.  Jimmy Rabbit smiled slyly. Henrietta Hen couldn't deceive him. He knew that she was as fond of cabbage as he was himself.  \"Did you ever hear it said,\" he asked her suddenly, \"that eating too much cabbage causes long ears?\"     XIV  EARS--SHORT OR LONG   Henrietta Hen's heart began to thump. She dropped a bit of cabbage out of her bill, letting it fall as if it burned her. And usually she was very careful as to her table-manners. \"Goodness!\" she said to Jimmy Rabbit, who was busily munching cabbage in Farmer Green's garden. \"You frighten me!\"  He had just asked her this strange question: \"Did you ever hear it said that eating too much cabbage causes long ears?\" And Henrietta Hen didn't want long ears. She knew they would be sure to spoil her beauty.  Jimmy Rabbit had no time to say anything more to Henrietta Hen. Although he had not finished his luncheon he left the garden suddenly--and in great haste. For old dog Spot began barking just beyond the fence; and Jimmy Rabbit always wanted to get as far from that sound as he could.  When Spot scurried into the cabbage-patch a little later Henrietta Hen called to him.  \"What is it?\" he asked her impatiently. \"I'm in a great hurry. I don't like to stop.\"  \"This is a very important matter,\" said Henrietta Hen. \"Do you like cabbage?\" she demanded.  \"Cabbage?\" he repeated after her as a puzzled look came over his face.  \"You needn't act so surprised,\" Henrietta told him coldly. \"You didn't come running into the garden for nothing. And I have reason to believe that you intended to eat some of Farmer Green's cabbages.\"  \"What's your reason?\" old Spot inquired.  \"You have long ears,\" said Henrietta.  \"Nonsense!\" cried Spot. \"What a person eats doesn't make his ears either long or short.\"  \"Are you sure of that?\" Henrietta Hen wanted to know.  \"I've never eaten cabbage in all my life,\" he declared.  Still she couldn't rid herself of her fears.  \"Perhaps,\" she said, \"if you had eaten it your ears would have grown twice as long as they are now.\"  He shook his head. \"I don't think so,\" he muttered.  \"There's only one way to find out,\" Henrietta announced. \"Eat a lot of cabbage--all you can! And we'll soon see whether your ears are growing longer.\"  But old dog Spot refused flatly to do anything of the sort. He said that his ears suited him quite well, just as they were.  \"What!\" Henrietta cried. \"Wouldn't you eat cabbage to oblige a lady?\"  Old Spot said he was sorry; but he had no liking for cabbage.  \"How can you tell if you've never tasted it?\" she asked.  He made no answer to that question. Instead, he asked her one of his own.  \"Would you like long ears?\" he inquired.  \"Certainly not!\" she cried.  \"How can you tell if you've never tried wearing any?\" he demanded.  \"Don't be stupid!\" she snapped. \"None of my family wears ears that can be seen. What a sight I'd be with long ears! Ears are very ugly things, and I only hope that I haven't eaten so much cabbage that mine will begin to grow.... Do you suppose they'd hang down like yours or stick up like Jimmy Rabbit's? He didn't say anything about that.\"  Old dog Spot let out a howl.  \"Jimmy Rabbit!\" he growled. \"Was he talking with you just before I arrived?\"  \"Yes!\" said Henrietta. \"It was he that asked me if I had ever heard that eating cabbage made a person's ears grow.\"  \"I might have known that it was that young Rabbit who put such a silly notion into your head,\" Spot grumbled. \"If you hadn't stopped me I'd have stopped _him_ by this time.... But it's too late now.\"  \"You don't suppose he was joking, do you?\" Henrietta inquired.  \"Of course he was,\" said Spot--and none too pleasantly.  \"Well,\" Henrietta mused, as she pecked at a cabbage-leaf, \"I must say that I think the joke's on you.\"     XV  HENRIETTA'S FRIGHT   When the old horse Ebenezer stood in his stall in the barn he was always glad to talk with anybody that came along.  Henrietta Hen sometimes strolled into the horse-barn to see if she could find a little grain that had spilled on the floor. So it came about that she and Ebenezer had many a chat together. Henrietta had no great opinion of horses. She thought that they had altogether more than their share of grain.  But she was willing to pass the time of day with Ebenezer, because he let her walk right into his stall and pick up tidbits that had dropped upon the floor beneath his manger.  It was on such an occasion, on a summer's day, that he said to her with a sigh, \"Haying's going to begin to-morrow.\"  Henrietta Hen remarked that she wasn't at all interested in the news. \"And I don't see why you should sigh,\" she added. \"Goodness knows you'll eat your share of the hay--and probably more--before the winter's over.\"  \"It's the work that I'm thinking of,\" Ebenezer explained. \"They'll hitch me to the hayrake and Johnnie Green will drive me all day long in the hot hayfields. I always hate to hear the clatter of the mowing machine,\" he groaned. \"It means that the hayrake will come out of the shed next.\"  Henrietta Hen caught her breath.  \"The mowing machine!\" she gasped. \"Is Farmer Green going to use the mowing machine now?\"  \"Certainly!\" said Ebenezer. \"I hear he's going to harness the bays to it to-morrow morning.\"  \"My! my!\" Henrietta wailed. \"Isn't there any way I can stop him from doing that?\"  \"I don't know of any,\" Ebenezer told her. \"I've often felt just as you do about it. There's nobody that dreads hearing the mowing machine more than I do.\"  \"You can't feel the way I do,\" Henrietta declared.  \"On the contrary,\" the old horse insisted, \"I don't see how it can matter to you in the least. _You_ don't have to pull the mowing machine nor the hayrake. Besides, didn't you just tell me that my news about haying didn't interest you?\"  \"But it does!\" Henrietta cried. \"I was mistaken. It means _everything_ to me. It's the worst news I ever heard in all my life.\"  Old Ebenezer looked down at her with mild astonishment on his long, honest face.  \"Why is it bad news?\" he inquired. \"If you'll tell me, perhaps I can help you.\"  So Henrietta Hen explained her difficulty. Whatever it was, it amazed Ebenezer. And he had to admit that he could think of no way out of the trouble.  \"It was very, very careless of you,\" he told Henrietta. Then suddenly he had a happy thought. \"Cheer up!\" he cried. \"If Farmer Green sits on them, maybe they'll hatch.\"  \"Hatch!\" she groaned. \"They'll _break_!\"  And she ran out of the stall and hurried into the yard.  She was just in time to hear Farmer Green calling to his son Johnnie.  \"Look here!\" said he. \"I started to oil the mowing machine so I could use it to-morrow; and just see what I found in the seat!\"  Johnnie Green came a-running. And there in the seat of the mowing machine, nestling in the hay which had been put there for a cushion the summer before, three eggs greeted Johnnie's eyes.  \"They must belong to the speckled hen,\" Johnnie decided. \"I knew she'd stolen her nest again. I couldn't find it anywhere.\" He picked up the eggs and put them in his hat. \"She's a sly one,\" he said.  That remark made Henrietta Hen somewhat angry. At the same time she was glad that Farmer Green had discovered the eggs before it was too late. She wouldn't have liked him to sit on them.  It always upset her to see her eggs broken.     XVI  THE ROOSTER UPSET   During the summer Henrietta Hen roamed about the farmyard as she pleased. To be sure, she always came a-running at feeding time. But except when there was something there to eat, she didn't go near the henhouse. She \"stole her nest,\" to use Johnnie Green's words, now in one place and now in another. And at night she roosted on any handy place in the barn or the haymow, under the carriage-shed or even over the pigpens.  However, when the nights began to grow chilly Henrietta was glad enough to creep into the henhouse with her companions. She always retired early. And being a good sleeper, she slept usually until the Rooster began to crow towards dawn. Of course now and then some fidgetty hen fancied that she heard a fox prowling about and waked everybody else with her squalls.  Such interruptions upset Henrietta. After the flock had gone to sleep again Henrietta Hen was more than likely to dream that Fatty Coon was in the henhouse. And she would squawk right out and start another commotion.  Luckily such disturbances didn't happen every night. Often nothing occurred to break the silence of the henhouse. And Henrietta would dream only of pleasant things, such as cracked corn, or crisp cabbage-leaves, or bone meal. After dreams of that sort Henrietta couldn't always be sure, when the Rooster waked her with his crowing, that she hadn't already breakfasted. But she would peck at her breakfast, when feeding time came, and if it tasted good she would know then that the other food had been nothing but a dream.  One night, soon after she had gone back to roost in the henhouse, it seemed to Henrietta that she had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18652"],["title","The Tale of Henrietta Hen (#5)"],["body","fallen asleep when the Rooster crowed.  She awoke with a start.  \"Goodness!\" she exclaimed under her breath. \"I must have slept soundly, for I haven't dreamed a single dream all night long.\" Then she noticed that none of the other hens had stirred. \"Lazy bones!\" Henrietta remarked to the Rooster. \"You won't get 'em up in a hurry. They, don't hear you at all.\"  To her surprise she received no answer.  \"He couldn't have heard me,\" she said to herself. So she repeated her speech in a louder tone. And still the Rooster made no reply. Henrietta couldn't understand it, he was always so polite to the ladies. Could it be that he was snubbing her?  Henrietta grew a bit angry as that thought popped into her head.  \"What's the matter?\" she snapped. \"Have you lost your voice? It was loud enough to wake me up a few moments ago.\"  Receiving no response whatsoever, Henrietta completely lost her temper. \"I'll see what's wrong with you!\" she cackled. And throwing herself off her roost, though it was dark as a pocket in the henhouse, she flung herself upon the perch just opposite, where she knew the Rooster had slept.  It was no wonder that Henrietta Hen blundered in the dark. It was no wonder that she missed her way and stumbled squarely into the Rooster, knocking him headlong on the floor.  He set up a terrible clamor. And he made Henrietta Hen angrier than ever, for he cried out in a loud voice something that would have displeased anybody. \"A skunk is after me!\" he bawled.     XVII  A SIGN OF RAIN   There was a terrible hubbub in the henhouse. The Rooster squalled so loudly that he waked up every hen in the place. And when they heard him crying that a skunk had knocked him off his roost they were as frightened as he was, and set up a wild cackle. All but Henrietta Hen! She knew there was no skunk there.  \"Don't be a goose--er--don't be a gander!\" she hissed to the Rooster. \"I'm the one that bumped into you.\"  The Rooster quickly came to his senses.  \"Don't be alarmed, ladies!\" he called to the flock. \"There's no danger. There's been a slight mistake.\" He pretended that he hadn't been scared. But he had been. And now he was somewhat uneasy about Henrietta Hen. He feared he was in for a scolding from her.  \"If you had answered me when I spoke to you I wouldn't have left my perch in the dark,\" she told the Rooster severely. \"When I moved to your perch to see what was the matter I blundered into you. And then you thought I was a skunk! You owe me an apology, sir!\"  The Rooster was glad it was not lighter in the henhouse, for he felt himself flushing hotly.  \"You must pardon me,\" he said. \"I had no idea it was you, for you waked me out of a sound sleep.\"  \"Sound sleep, indeed!\" Henrietta Hen exclaimed with a sniff. \"Why, you had been crowing only a few moments before. In fact it was your crowing that roused me.\"  \"No doubt!\" said the Rooster. \"But you see, I fell asleep again immediately.\"  \"Then you must be ill,\" Henrietta retorted, \"for I've never known you to go to sleep again, once you've begun your morning's crowing.\"  \"But it's not morning now,\" the Rooster informed her. \"It's not even late at night--certainly not an hour since sunset.\"  Henrietta Hen was astonished.  \"I noticed that the night seemed short,\" she muttered.  The Rooster thought it a great joke.  \"Ha! ha!\" he laughed. And he said to the rest of the flock, with a chuckle, \"Henrietta thought it was morning! No doubt she'd have gone out into the yard if the door hadn't been shut.\" And the other hens all tittered. They always did, if the rooster expected them to.  Well, if there was one thing that Henrietta Hen couldn't endure, it was to be laughed at.  \"Don't be silly!\" she cried. \"Why shouldn't I think it was morning, when he crowed almost in my ear?\"  \"Don't you know why I crowed?\" the Rooster asked her. And without waiting for any reply, he said, \"I crowed to let Farmer Green know it was going to rain to-morrow.\"  Of course Henrietta Hen had to have the last word. The Rooster might have known she would.  \"Then,\" she observed, \"I suppose you squawked to let him know there was a skunk in the henhouse.\"     XVIII  IN NEED OF ADVICE   Something was troubling Henrietta Hen. She seemed to have some secret sorrow. No longer did she move with her well-known queenly manner among her neighbors in the farmyard. Instead, she spent a good deal of her time moping. And no one could guess the reason. She didn't even care to talk to anybody--not even to boast about her fine, speckled coat. And that certainly was not in the least like Henrietta Hen.  Always, before, Henrietta had seized every chance to parade before the public. Now she seemed to crave privacy.  What was the matter? To tell the truth, Henrietta Hen herself did not know the answer to that question. That is to say, she did not know _why_ a certain thing was so. She only knew that a great misfortune had befallen her. And she dreaded to tell anybody about it.  To be sure, there was old Whitey--a hen who had lived on the farm longer than any other. Most members of the flock often asked her advice. Even Henrietta herself had done that. But this difficulty was something she didn't want to mention to a neighbor. If there were only somebody outside the flock to whom she could go for help! But she knew of no one.  Then Henrietta happened to hear of Aunt Polly Woodchuck. The Muley Cow, who went to the pasture every day, mentioned Aunt Polly's name to Henrietta. According to the Muley Cow, Aunt Polly Woodchuck was an herb doctor--and a good one, too. No matter what might be troubling a person, Aunt Polly was sure to have something right in her basket to cure it.  \"I'd like to see her,\" Henrietta Hen had said. \"But I can't go way up in the pasture, under the hill.\"  \"Could you go to the end of the lane?\" the Muley Cow inquired.  \"Yes!\"  \"Then I'll ask Aunt Polly Woodchuck to meet you by the bars to-morrow morning,\" the Muley Cow promised.  That suited Henrietta Hen.  \"I'll be there--if it doesn't rain,\" she agreed.  Early the next day she followed the cows through the lane. And she hadn't waited long at the bars when Aunt Polly Woodchuck came hobbling up to her. Being a very old lady, Aunt Polly was somewhat lame. But she was spry, for all that. And her eyes were as bright as buttons.  Henrietta Hen saw at once that Aunt Polly was hopelessly old-fashioned. She carried a basket on her arm, and a stick in her hand.  \"Well, well, dearie! Here you are!\" cried Aunt Polly Woodchuck. \"The Muley Cow tells me you're feeling poorly. Do tell me all about yourself! No doubt I've something in my basket that will do you a world of good.\"  [Illustration: \"Don't Worry!\" Said Aunt Polly Woodchuck. (_Page 91_)]     XIX  AUNT POLLY HELPS   Somehow Henrietta Hen couldn't help liking Aunt Polly Woodchuck, in spite of her old-fashioned appearance. She certainly had a way with her--a way that made a person _want_ to tell her his troubles.  \"I don't know whether you can help me or not,\" said Henrietta Hen. \"Have you any feathers in your basket?\"  \"No--no! No feathers!\" Aunt Polly replied. \"I use herbs in my business of doctoring. But I've heard that a burnt feather held under a body's nose will do wonders sometimes.... I must always carry a feather in my basket, hereafter.\"  \"_One_ feather wouldn't do me any good,\" said Henrietta Hen with a doleful sigh. \"I need a great many more than one.\"  \"You do?\" Aunt Polly cried.  \"Yes!\" Henrietta answered. \"Half my feathers have dropped off me. And that's why I've come to ask your advice. I'm fast losing my fatal beauty.\"  Henrietta Hen's voice trembled as she told Aunt Polly Woodchuck the dreadful news. \"I don't believe you'll be able to help me,\" she quavered. \"I'll soon look like a perfect fright. Besides, winter's coming; and how I'll ever keep warm with no feathers is more than I know.\"  Henrietta Hen couldn't understand how Aunt Polly managed to stay so calm. Henrietta had expected her to throw up her hands and say something like \"Sakes alive!\" or \"Mercy on us!\" But the old lady did nothing of the sort.  She set her basket down on the ground; and pushing her spectacles forward to the end of her nose, she leaned over and looked closely at Henrietta Hen. Aunt Polly's gaze travelled over Henrietta from head to foot and then back again. And she took hold of one of Henrietta's feathers and gave it a gentle twitch.  \"Look out!\" Henrietta cried. \"You'll pull it out if you're not careful. And I can't afford to lose any more feathers than I have to.\"  \"Don't worry!\" Aunt Polly Woodchuck advised her. \"Cheer up! There's nothing the matter with you. You are molting. You are going to get a new outfit of feathers for winter. Your old ones have to fall out in order to make room for the new. And no doubt the fresh ones will be much handsomer than the old.\"  Henrietta couldn't believe that Aunt Polly knew what she was talking about.  \"I can't be molting as early in the fall as this,\" she protested. \"I've never got my winter feathers so soon.... I fear you're mistaken,\" she told Aunt Polly.  \"Oh, no! I'm not mistaken,\" Aunt Polly Woodchuck insisted. \"I know it's early for molting--but haven't you noticed that the wheat grew big this year, and that the bark on young trees is thick? And haven't you observed that Frisky Squirrel is laying up a great store of nuts in his hollow tree, and that the hornets built their paper houses far from the ground this summer?\"  Henrietta Hen's mouth fell open as she stared at Aunt Polly Woodchuck. And when the old lady paused, Henrietta looked quite bewildered.  \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" she murmured. \"I don't see what all this has to do with molting.\"  \"Some of those signs,\" Aunt Polly explained, \"mean an early winter; and some of 'em mean a cold one. I've never known 'em to fail. And you're molting early so you'll have a good warm coat of feathers by the time winter comes.\"  Well, Henrietta Hen began to feel better at once. She actually smiled--something she had"]]]
