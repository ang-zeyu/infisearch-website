Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.  [Illustration]  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.  \"Would it be of any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.  \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought Alice. \"I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"OÃ¹ est ma chatte?\" which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats.\"  \"Not like cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would _you_ like cats, if you were me?\"  \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \"don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather not.\"  \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\"  [Illustration: Alice at the Mad Tea Party.]  \"I won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.  So she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned 'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\"  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore.  [Illustration]     III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE   They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross and uncomfortable.  [Illustration]  The first question, of course, was how to get dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.  \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with an important air. \"Are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'--\"  \"Ugh!\" said the Lory, with a shiver.  \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable'--\"  \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck.  \"Found _it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what 'it' means.\"  \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said the Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\"  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.  \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\"  \"In that case,\" said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\"  \"Speak English!\" said the Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!\"  \"What I was going to say,\" said the Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\"  \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice.  [Illustration]  \"Why,\" said the Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded 'round it, panting and asking, \"But who has won?\"  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought. At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes.\"  \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of voices asked.  \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, in a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\"  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them 'round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round.  The next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.  \"You promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.  \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to Alice and sighing.  \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:--      \"Fury said to       a mouse, That          he met in the             house, 'Let               us both go                 to law: _I_                  will prosecute                _you_.--                  Come, I'll               take no denial:              We            must have         the trial;      For really     this morning     I've     nothing     to do.'     Said the      mouse to       the cur,        'Such a         trial, dear            sir, With                no jury                 or judge,                    would                   be wasting                 our              breath.'          'I'll be         judge,        I'll be       jury,'      said     cunning     old      Fury;       'I'll        try         the          whole           cause,           and          condemn        you to     death.'\"  \"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you thinking of?\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got to the fifth bend, I think?\"  \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.  \"Please come back and finish your story!\" Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker.  \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone.  \"I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     IV--THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL   It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; Alice heard "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033"],["title","Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (#2)"],["body","muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an angry tone, \"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\"  \"He took me for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"W. RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.  By this time, Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and put it to her lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\"  Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any more.\"  Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?\"  [Illustration]  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen.  \"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\" Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it.  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll go 'round and get in at the window.\"  \"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort.  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And then a voice she had never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\"  \"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?\"  \"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\"  \"Well, it's got no business there, at any rate; go and take it away!\"  There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were _two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll do next!\" thought Alice. \"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could_!\"  She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other ladder? Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master says you've got to go down the chimney!\"  Alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next.  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\" then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch him, you by the hedge!\" Then silence and then another confusion of voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--What happened to you?\"  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\"  After a minute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A barrowful will do, to begin with.\"  \"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in my size.\"  So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.  [Illustration: \"The Duchess tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's.\"]  \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other, but the great question is 'What?'\"  Alice looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.  [Illustration]     V--ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR   At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed Alice in a languid, sleepy voice.  \"Who are _you_?\" said the Caterpillar.  [Illustration]  Alice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have changed several times since then.\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain yourself!\"  \"I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm not myself, you see--being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\" She drew herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\"  \"Why?\" said the Caterpillar.  As Alice could not think of any good reason and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.  \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \"I've something important to say!\" Alice turned and came back again.  \"Keep your temper,\" said the Caterpillar.  \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.  \"No,\" said the Caterpillar.  It unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you think you're changed, do you?\"  \"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!\"  \"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar.  \"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a wretched height to be.\"  \"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).  In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\"  \"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to herself.  \"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment, it was out of sight.  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.  \"And now which is which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin--it had struck her foot!  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit....  \"Come, my head's free at last!\" "]]]
