And I think we had better take those ropes off their necks as they can't get out of the yard without going through the house or jumping the fence, and it is much too high for them to do that.\"  Little did those sailors and the old man know of the jumping powers of these three animals or he would never have had them untied. When the sailors and the old man had disappeared in the house, the three Chums walked around the yard looking for a loop-hole to crawl through, or for a weak board Billy might butt down. As for Button, all he had to do was to run up the fence and jump down on the other side. And did they but know it, Stubby could do the same stunt as he had watched the police dogs in Paris run up the side of an eight-foot fence, balance themselves on the top and leap down on the other side. As for Billy, when he was ready to go he could jump on top of an old packing box that stood beside the shed, and from that leap to the roof of the shed. From there he could spring into the alley. But what bothered them now was where they should go when they escaped. The city was very large and it stretched itself out along the banks of the Hudson River for miles and miles. They wanted to go in that direction, as 'way up north lived Nannie, Billy's little wife whom he was crazy to see after his long absence abroad. She was away up in Wisconsin on the dear old farm and it would take weeks and weeks to reach there if they traveled by foot all the way. But they expected to steal some rides as they always did when traveling. Stubby and Button had not a relative in the world they knew of, but they loved Nannie and all of Billy's family as if they were their very own blood relations. They had known them for years and years and had always been very kind to them, especially Nannie and Daisy, Billy's son's wife, while the Kids, Billy's twin grandchildren, were their delight.  [Illustration]  The three Chums were lying perfectly still, each engrossed in his own thoughts and plans as how best to get out of the city when they were aroused by a loud meow over their heads. Looking up, they saw a big, striped cat sitting on the fence.  \"Good-morning, friends and distinguished travelers!\" said the cat. \"I hope I am not disturbing you, but the cats and the dogs of the neighborhood--and there is a goodly number of them--appointed me the head of a committee to call upon you and welcome you to our shores.\"  As the cat had been talking, other cats had been appearing on top of the fence and now a line of them, all sizes, colors and descriptions, sat on the top of the fence winking down at the Chums, while through holes under the fence appeared dogs' heads, as evidently they were too large of body to crawl through the small holes.  \"The canary you see in the cage hanging out of that upper window, and the parrot in the window of the next house sang and called out to us this morning that celebrated travelers from the War had just arrived from overseas and were shut in Grandpa Stubbs' back yard. Every one around here calls Mr. Stubbs grandpa because he is so kind to little children and to all animals. We are always glad to hear some things of the outside world, and when we heard that you were fresh from the war zone, we determined to make your acquaintance and invite you to speak and tell us of some of your adventures on the other side. I am president of the Dog and Cat Information Bureau, and we are holding a meeting to-night in a big, empty warehouse that has just been finished for the storage of ammunition. We have a very large membership--five hundred dogs and cats belonging. Having no newspaper, we meet to exchange the news of the day. If we did not, we would not know what was going on in the world outside our city. As it is, we are well posted for dogs and cats journey here from all over the world to speak at our meetings and to tell us what is happening in the countries from which they come. Now I hope all of you will favor us by speaking at our meeting to-night. It begins at twelve o'clock, and I will come and escort you to our place of meeting. We start rather late as it is easier for us to steal away from our homes unmolested at that hour than at any other. Many of our members are children's pets and can't get away until they are tucked in bed as they keep such close track of them.\"  Billy stood up and bowing to the line of cats on the fence and to the heads of the dogs under the fence, he began:  \"Friends and countrymen, we thank you for your courtesy and kind invitation to speak before your club this evening. This we will be pleased to do provided we can escape our host and are not locked in the shed. But I think I can promise you we will be there for if we should be shut in the shed, my good strong head can butt down and make short work of a board or two that would give us access to the alley. Should we be tied, we can easily chew the rope in two. Consequently I think you may expect us at the appointed hour if some one will kindly show us the way to where your meeting is to be held.\"  Just then Mr. Stubbs opened the back door, and stepped into the yard.  \"Bless my soul! I never saw so many dogs and cats in my life. I must be seeing things, for surely there can't be that many cats and dogs in this neighborhood.\" He rubbed his eyes to make sure he had seen a line of cats sitting on top of the fence and a line of dogs peeping under the fence. But when he looked again, there was not a single cat or dog to be seen. The only ones he could discover were Stubby and Button, both apparently asleep outside the shed door.  \"Well, I declare that is the most peculiar thing that ever happened to me in my life! I distinctly saw dozens of cats and dogs and now I can't see one. Heigho! My old eyes must be playing tricks with me.\" And that was all he thought about it. He had come out to shut the Chums in the shed, but seeing them all three fast asleep, he decided to let them sleep on and not shut them in the shed that night.    [Illustration: Billy saw the man raise the mop to come after him   (Page 35)]     CHAPTER II  THE NEW YORK DOG AND CAT CLUB   \"He really is an accommodating old fellow, isn't he,\" said Billy, \"to leave us out all night? It will save him a broken shed door, though he will never know it.\"  \"What time do you suppose it is?\" asked Stubby.  \"From the height of the moon I should say it must be about half past ten,\" answered Button.  \"That will give us an hour and a half to think up what we are going to talk about at the club to-night. What are you going to tell them, Billy?\" said Stubby.  \"I really don't know. Guess I will wait for the inspiration of the moment.\"  \"You better think up something extra exciting. Why not tell them about the time you were blown out of the trenches and lost a piece of your tail? Or, better yet, when you broke into the German headquarters and butted the great Hindenburg himself,\" advised Button.  \"Very well, I will, as probably that would be as interesting as anything I could recount. What are you two fellows going to relate to them?\"  \"I think I shall tell them about our trip on the canal boat in France,\" replied Button.  \"And I plan to describe to them the Dog Hospital and tell how it was blown up by the Germans,\" added Stubby.  \"It is quite an idea,\" said Billy, \"their having a club like this. It keeps them in touch with all that goes on throughout the whole country. I am quite anxious to see what it is like.\"  As the hands of the clock in the Ferry station pointed to twelve, they heard a loud meow and looking up they saw the big cat that had first appeared to them sitting on the fence.  \"Well, friends, here I am! Are you ready to start?\"  \"All ready!\" replied Billy.  \"But how are you to get out?\"  \"We will show you,\" said Stubby, whereupon Billy hopped up on the packing box and from it onto the roof of the shed and then jumped down into the alley.  \"Very cleverly done!\" commended the cat, whose name, by the way, was Tiger because he was striped like one. \"But what puzzles me is how your friends are to get out as the jump is too high for them.\"  \"Too high for them, did you say? Nothing is too high for a dog that has done police duty in France. Listen! Did you not hear something hit the fence and then the scratch of nails on the boards? Well, that is my friend Stubby running up the side of the fence. From the sounds, evidently he did not get enough of a running start and fell back. But here he comes! See his head appearing over the top?\"  In a second Stubby appeared, balancing himself on the ridge of the fence. The next moment he stood beside them. At the same time Button also ran down a post of the fence.  \"Now we are all here, we'll have to hurry to allow for having to stop to hide when we see watchmen and strange dogs. Not knowing any of our members, you will have to be careful not to attack them, thinking they are enemies. I will give you the password. It is three short, sharp barks. On seeing another dog, all our members bark this password and if the dog they bark at does not reply in like manner, they know it is a stray dog. The cats all give three caterwauls in the same manner.\"  \"Oh,\" exclaimed Button, \"here comes a brute of a bulldog, whose mouth looks as if it were just watering for the back of a cat. Unless he gives the password quickly I shall take no chance but run up this tree. I am willing to tackle almost any dog but a bulldog.\"  \"Bow! Wow! Wow!\" barked the bulldog as he approached them.  \"Bow! Wow! Wow!\" replied Stubby, while Billy baaed, \"Baa! Baa! Baa!\" and Button meowed, \"Mew! Mew! Mew!\"  By this time the bulldog had come up to them and Tiger introduced them, telling the dog what distinguished friends he was meeting.  [Illustration]  They found him most agreeable and that his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18990"],["title","Billy Whiskers' Adventures (#2)"],["body","really belied him, just as the appearance of many persons does. As they all trotted along toward the big warehouse down by the dock, Stubby and the bulldog ran side by side, while Billy and the two cats ran on ahead. Presently Stubby barked: \"Oh, Billy! What do you think? Our new friend here says he is the full brother of Boozer, the bulldog that belonged to Captain Percy, and that he was in the Dog Hospital at the same time we were there, laid up with a broken leg.\"  \"The world is small after all. To think we should meet over here just after seeing your brother in France!\"  \"Hiss!\" warned Tiger. \"No more talking until we are inside the building. We are approaching the warehouse now and we must not let the watchmen see us. The only way we can get in is through a window in the basement that has been left open by mistake. There is a broad plank running from the window down to the floor that the men use with their wheelbarrows to carry out the dirt. It makes it very handy to get out. We all could jump down, but few of our club members can jump up so high. None of us can jump like Stubby here.\"  \"Bow-wow!\" barked the bulldog in a low voice as a man with a lantern turned into the alley down which they all were running. \"Hide quickly until he passes!\"  As the man passed them, they heard him muttering to himself: \"I never saw so many cats and dogs in my life as I have seen to-night in this alley. I did not know there were so many in the world! And when I get up to where I saw them they are all gone--disappeared--vamoosed. They must be the ghosts of the dead and gone dogs and cats that used to live in the warehouse.\"  Just then the bulldog, whose name was Buster, sneezed, which so startled the man that he ran as if he had been shot.  \"Nice brave watchmen they have!\" said Billy.  \"Plague take my nose!\" said Buster. \"It is so short and stubby that all the dust gets into it and to save my life I can't help sneezing. And I always do it at the most inopportune moment.\"  Just then a whistle sounded, and Tiger said, \"We must hurry! There goes the twelve o'clock whistle at the factory down the river. It is the signal for the night shift to come on.\"  [Illustration]  The warehouse being near where they were, in about five minutes they found themselves entering the low window Buster had spoken about. When they looked inside, it was pitch dark and as if they were looking into a coal pit. But their eyes being such that they could see in the dark, they had no trouble in walking the plank and soon found themselves on the floor of the cellar. It looked a black square in shape and there was absolutely nothing in it, Tiger said. Still in the distance they could see black shapes moving about.  \"What in the world is over in that corner?\" asked Billy.  \"Oh, they are only wharf rats,\" replied Tiger. \"Shall we charge down on them just for fun?\"  \"Say we do! But I hate rats as I do poison,\" said Billy.  \"So do I, but they are our natural enemies,\" answered Tiger.  \"Ours too,\" from Stubby.  \"You stand and watch the fun, while we rat haters kill a few,\" suggested Tiger.  \"Very well!\"  \"When I say _three_, all of you run for the bunch and kill as many as you can,\" instructed Tiger.  For the next ten minutes you never in all your life heard such squealing, snarling and snipping of teeth as there was in that cellar. Two unusually big cats and two dogs all bound to kill rats were fighting these fierce wharf rats. But what made the battle such a bloody one was that wharf rats are braver than house rats and will fight to the death when attacked. Being large, and having long, sharp teeth, more often than not they get the better of ordinary cats and dogs that are sicked on them. In less than fifteen minutes hundreds of rats had been killed, for Buster was a noted rat killer. All he did was to open his jaws, grab a rat in the middle of its back, give his head a shake and the rat's back was broken. Then he tossed that rat aside and served another one likewise.  The rats had all disappeared or else were lying dead in heaps when Billy heard Stubby give a whine of pain, and turning to discover where he was, he saw him standing in the midst of a pile of dead rats with one nearly half as large as himself hanging to his throat under his jaw. The rat had hold of Stubby in such a way he could not shake him off, and all the time the rat was sucking his blood.  Billy saw him in a minute and with one bound he was beside Stubby and had ripped the rat open with his long, sharp horn, which made its mouth open and set Stubby free.  \"Thank you, old fellow, for saving me! I was almost gone when you came with your timely assistance.\"  [Illustration]  \"I guess we have had enough fun with rats for one night,\" said Tiger, \"and we better be getting on or we will be late for the opening exercises.\"  \"I am a perfect mess!\" said Stubby in disgust. \"See how bloody I am.\"  \"So am I,\" replied Tiger.  \"I too,\" chimed in Button.  \"I tell you what let's do,\" proposed Stubby. \"It won't take five minutes. Let's run out and take a swim in the river. I can never appear before a strange audience with my coat looking like this.\"  \"I'll go with you,\" replied Buster.  \"I think,\" said Button, \"I would prefer cleaning my coat by rolling in that nice clean bank of sand in the corner of the cellar to swimming in the river.\"  \"I am with you on that proposition,\" said Tiger. \"No water for me when I can get good, clean sand! After a roll I shall come out as clean and shining as if I had been sent to the cleaner and run through a vat of gasoline.\"  Stubby and Buster went to the river and were soon swimming around and having great sport in the water as it was nice and warm. But presently Stubby stopped short and stared ahead of him, and what do you think he saw but a whole drove of rats swimming out to a big sea-going vessel that lay at anchor in the harbor.  \"Let's go ashore. I've seen all the rats I want to see for a coon's age. And you can't get me out of here too soon for they may attack us.\"  Soon Stubby and Buster, looking as clean as whistles, found Button and Tiger who also looked spick and span, and the four entered the clubroom, which was on one of the upper floors and as light as day for the light from four big electric street lamps came streaming in the window, lighting the room from corner to corner and making it as bright as if the lamps were in the room itself. And what a sight was there! Hundreds of dogs and cats were there sitting on benches arranged in a semicircle and graduated like the seats in a theater. For this room had been used as a lecture room to give instructions to sailors and soldiers before going overseas, and the benches and platform were just as they had left them.  On the platform, sitting upon their hind legs on chairs one could see every specie of dog from the Eskimo dog of the North to the tiny hairless dog of the tropics. There were big dogs, little dogs, middle-sized dogs, and cats of all sizes, colors and breeds. The snow-white Angora was there as well as the mangy alley cat. But all were on an equal at these meetings and there was no quarreling between aristocrat and the animal with no pedigree. All was harmony there. Could only the human race be as harmonious as these animals, the Brotherhood of Man would be established.  One after another the cats and dogs went on the platform and either told some funny episode that had happened to them or some tragedy that had occurred where they lived, or else they described the country from which they had come, and told how the natives lived.     CHAPTER III  AN EXCITING EVENING   The first dog called upon to lecture was an Eskimo dog with bright, snappy eyes, short, sharply pointed ears, strong legs and a bushy tail that gave him the appearance of a wolf, especially as his coat was just the color of that animal. And what more natural, as the Eskimo dog is the direct descendant of the timber wolf of the North? And though they may appear docile at times, still they always retain that half wild, ferocious look and manner.  He was a handsome, alert dog and spoke in quick, short sentences and to the point. He began by saying:  \"I expect that none of you are familiar with the far North, where it is day six months of the year and night the other six. But though the sun does not shine, don't think for a moment that we live in pitch darkness, for the stars and the Northern Lights make our nights most beautiful. In fact, they are more beautiful and varied than our days. Instead of the blazing rays of the sun that blind one, we have the ever varied, many colored rays of the Aurora Borealis, shooting stars and electrical displays of all kinds that far surpass even your most elaborate Fourth of July celebrations.  \"One moment the sky will be a sea-shell pink, with bars of vivid green, lavender and purple playing across it, while in the center will be a misty golden ball as if the sun was trying to shine through. The next instant all may be pitch darkness until this too is chased away by another electrical outburst. These go on constantly for the whole six months until they become so common an occurrence that the inhabitants pay no more attention to those magnificent displays than you do to your sun on a summer day.  \"Picture to yourself this wonderful sky, against which huge icebergs are seen, taller than your tallest church steeple, and more beautiful to look upon with their lacelike frostwork than your most elaborately carved white marble cathedral. All of this is reflected in detail in the clear, cold, deep green waters of the Arctic Ocean, where the big walruses, whales and seals live, to say nothing of the clumsy white polar bears that sit idly on a cake of ice waiting for an unwary fish to swim by so he may catch it and make a breakfast on it.  \"In round-topped, oven-like mounds made of ice and snow live our masters, the Eskimos. They live on whale oil, blubber, fish and the meat of the musk ox, bear and other animals"]]]
