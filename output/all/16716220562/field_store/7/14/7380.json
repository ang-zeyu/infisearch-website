He had no explanation of Tom's singular act, except the very plausible one that Tom had lost his former lively interest in the troop, even so much as to have forgotten about those three cabins to which they had always seemed to have a prior right; which had been like home to them in the summertime.  When you look through green glass everything is green, and now Roy thought he could remember many little instances of Tom's waning interest in the troop. Naturally enough, Roy thought, these scout games and preparations for camping seemed tame enough to one who had gone to France and fought in the trenches. Tom was older now, not only in years but in experience, and was it any wonder that his interest in \"the kids\" should be less keen?  And Roy was not going to let that break up the friendship. Loyal and generous as he was, he would not ask himself why Tom had done that thing; he would not let himself think about it. He and the other scouts would get ready and go to camp, live in tents there, and have just as much fun.  So no longer blaming Tom, he now blamed himself, and the thing he blamed himself for most of all was his angry declaration that Tom was probably acquainted with the scoutmaster of that fortunate troop in Ohio. He knew that must have cut Tom, for in his heart he knew Tom's blunt sense of fairness. Whatever was the cause or reason of Tom's singular act it was not favoritism, Roy felt sure of that. He would have given anything not to have said those words. Lukewarm, thoughtless, Tom might be, but he was not disloyal. It was no new friendship, displacing these old friendships, which had caused Tom to do what he had done, Roy knew that well enough.  In the morning, unknown to any of the troop he went early to the bank building to wait for Tom there, and to tell him that he was sorry for the way he had spoken.  But everything went wrong that morning, the trails did not cross at the right places. Probably it was because Lucky Luke was concerned in the matter. The fact is that it being Saturday, a short and busy day, Tom had gone very early to the Temple Camp office and was already upstairs when Roy was waiting patiently down at the main door.     CHAPTER X  TOM RECEIVES A SURPRISE   When Tom reached the office, he found among the Temple Camp letters, one addressed to him personally. It was postmarked Dansburg, Ohio, and he opened it with some curiosity, for the former letters in this correspondence had been addressed to Mr. Burton, as manager. His curiosity turned to surprise as he read,      DEAR MR. SLADE:      In one of the little circulars of Temple Camp which you sent us,     your name appears as assistant to Mr. Burton in the Temple Camp     office.      I am wondering whether you can be the same Tom Slade who was in the     Motorcycle Corps in France? If so, perhaps you will remember the     soldier who spent the night with you in a shell-hole near Epernay.     Do you remember showing me the Gold Cross and saying that you had     won it while a scout in America? I think you said you had been in     some Jersey Troop.      If you are the same Tom Slade, then congratulations to you for     getting home safely, and I will promise my scouts that they will     have the chance this summer of meeting the gamest boy on the west     front. I suppose you will be up at the camp yourself.      Send me a line and let me know if you're the young fellow whose arm     I bandaged up. I'm thinking the world isn't so big after all.                                          Best wishes to you,                                                         WILLIAM BARNARD,      Scoutmaster 1st Dansburg Troop, B.S.A.,     Dansburg, Ohio.  Tom could hardly believe his eyes as he read the letter. William Barnard! He had never known that fellow's name, but he knew that the soldier who had bandaged his arm (whatever his name was) had saved his life. Would he ever forget the long night spent in that dank, dark shell-hole? Would he ever forget that chance companion in peril, who had nursed him and cheered him all through that endless night? He could smell the damp earth again and the pungent atmosphere of gunpowder which permeated the place and almost suffocated him. Directly over the shell-hole a great British tank had stopped and been deserted, locking them in as in a dungeon. And when he had recovered from the fumes, he had heard a voice speaking to him and asking him if he was much hurt.  William Barnard!  And he had given the three cabins on the hill to Scoutmaster Barnard's troop in Dansburg, Ohio.  No one but Tom had arrived at the office and for just a few moments, standing there near Miss Ellison's typewriter and with the prosy letter files about, he was again in France. He could hear the booming of the great guns again, see the flashes of fire....  He sat down and wrote,      DEAR MR. BARNARD:      I got your letter and I am the same Tom Slade. I was going to ask     you where you lived in America so I could know you some more when we     got back, but when the doctors came to take me away, I didn't see     you anywhere. I had to stay in the hospital three weeks, but it     wasn't on account of my arm, because that wasn't so bad. It was the     shell-shock that was bad--it makes you forget things even after you     get better.      I was sorry early this morning that I gave you those cabins, because     they're the same ones that my own troop always used to have, and it     was a crazy thing for me to forget about that. But now I'm glad,     because I have thought of another scheme. I thought of it while I     was lying in bed last night and couldn't sleep. So now I'm glad you     have those cabins. And you bet I'm glad you wrote to me. It's funny     how things happen.      Maybe you'll remember how I thought I was going to die in that hole,     and you said how we could dig our way out with your helmet, because     if a fellow _has_ to do something he can do it. I'm glad you said     that, because I thought about it last night. And thinking of that     made me decide I would do something.      I would like it if you will write to me again before summer, and you     can send your letters care of Temple Camp, Black Lake.      When you come, you bet I'll be glad to see you.                                                    Your friend,                                                           TOM SLADE.  When Tom had sealed and stamped this letter, he laid the other one on Miss Margaret Ellison's desk, thinking that she might be interested to read it.     CHAPTER XI  TOM AND ROY   Anxious that his letter should go as soon as possible, Tom went down in the elevator and was about to cross the street and post it when he ran plunk into Roy, who was waiting on the steps.  \"Good night, look who's here,\" Roy said, in his usual friendly tone; \"I might have known that you were upstairs. You've got the early bird turning green with envy.\"  \"I always come early Saturdays,\" Tom said.  \"I want to tell you that I'm sorry about the way I spoke to you last night, Tom,\" Roy spoke up. \"I see now that it wasn't so bad. I guess you have a whole lot to do up in the office, and maybe you just forgot about how we always had the hill cabins. You can't do _everything_ you want to do, gee I realize that.\"  \"I can do anything I want to do,\" Tom said.  Roy looked at him as if he did not quite understand.  \"Going back on people isn't the way to square things,\" Tom said. \"You got to make things right without anybody losing anything. There's always two ways, only you've got to find the other one.\"  Roy did not quite understand the drift of his friend's talk, it was not always easy to follow Tom, and indeed he did not care much what Tom meant; he just wanted him to know that their friendship had not been wrecked--could not be wrecked by any freakish act of Tom's.  \"I don't care thirty cents what anybody says,\" Tom said; \"I got to be fair.\"  \"I'm not mad, you old grouch,\" Roy said, \"and you should say sixty cents, because the price of everything is double. We should worry. I was waiting here to meet you so as to tell you that I don't know why you did that and I don't care. People have done crazier things than that, I should hope. We can bunk in tents, all right. So don't be sore, Tomasso. I'm sorry I said what I did and I know perfectly well that you just didn't think. You don't suppose I really meant that I thought you knew anybody in that troop out in Ohio, do you? I just said it because I was mad. Gee whiz, I know you wouldn't give anybody the choice before _us_--before your own fellows. I was mad because I was disappointed. But now I know how maybe you were all kind of--you know--rattled on account of being so busy.  \"I ain't mad,\" said Tom, in his dull, stolid way; \"I got to go across the street and mail this letter.\"  \"And you'll come to meeting next Friday night?\" Roy asked, anxiously.  \"I don't know,\" Tom said.  \"And I'm going to tell the fellows that you assigned five, six, and seven, to that Ohio troop just because you were thinking about something else when you did it, and that you didn't know anything more about those fellows than if they were the man in the moon,\" Roy paused a moment. \"Did you?\" he said conclusively.  \"You can tell them whatever you want to,\" Tom said. \"You can tell them that I didn't know anything about them if you want to. I don't care what you tell them.\"  Roy paused, hardly knowing what to say. In talking with Tom one had to get him right just as a wrestler must get his victim right and Roy knew that he must watch his step, so to speak.  \"You can tell them they won't lose anything,\" Tom said.  \"They'll lose something all right if they lose _you_, Tomasso,\" Roy said, with a note of deep feeling in his voice. \"But we're not going to lose you, I can tell you that. They think you have no use for the scouts any more, because you met so many people in France, and know a lot of grown-up"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18943"],["title","Tom Slade at Black Lake (#6)"],["body"," people.\"  \"Is that what they think?\" Tom asked.  They both stepped aside for Margaret Ellison, the Temple Camp stenographer, to pass in, and spoke pleasantly with her until she had entered the elevator.  \"I don't care what they think,\" Roy said; \"a scout is observant. Can't I see plain enough that you have your pioneer scout badge on? That shows you're thinking about the scouts.\"  \"I put it on for a reason,\" said Tom.  \"You bet your life you did,\" Roy said, \"and it shows you're a scout. Once a scout, always a scout; you can't get away from that, Tomasso.\"  \"Maybe you'll find that out,\" Tom said, his meaning, as usual, a little cloudy.  \"I don't have to find it out, Tom,\" Roy said. \"Don't you suppose I know where you stand? Do you think I'll ever forget how you and I hiked together, and how we camped up on my lawn together, when you first got to be a scout--do you think I will? I always liked you better than any fellow, gee whiz, that's sure. And I know you think more of us than you do of any one else, too. Don't you?\"  \"I got to go and mail this letter,\" Tom said.  \"First you've got to say that you're for the scouts first, last and always,\" said Roy gayly, and standing in his friend's path.  Tom looked straight at him, his eyes glistening.  \"Do you have to ask me that?\" he said.  And then was when the trails went wrong, and didn't cross right and come out right. Roy went up in the elevator to get some circulars from Temple Camp office, and Tom, on his way back from across the street went into the bank to speak with Mr. Temple's secretary. And the girl spoiled everything, as Peewee Harris always said that girls are forever doing.  She was in a great hurry to get the cover off her machine and other matters straightened out, before Mr. Burton came in, so she did not trouble herself to talk much with Roy. She did, however, think to call after him just as he was leaving and he heard her words, with a kind of cold chill, as he stepped into the elevator.  She called to him in her sweetest tone, \"Isn't it too funny! A scoutmaster, named Barnard, from out in Ohio who is going to be up at camp knew Tom in France. Won't they have a perfectly _scrumptious_ vacation together, talking about old times?\"     CHAPTER XII  THE LONG TRAIL   \"You can tell them whatever you want to. You _can tell them that I didn't know anything about them_ if you want to. I don't care what you tell them.\" These were the words that rang in Roy Blakeley's mind as he went down in the elevator, and they made him sick at heart. That Tom had so much forgotten about the troop, _his_ troop, as to assign their three cabins to strangers--that Roy could overlook. He could not understand it, but in his fondness for Tom, he could overlook it, as his talk with Tom had proved.  But that Tom should lie to him and make him a party to that lie by authorizing him to repeat it, that he could not forget or forgive. \"_You can tell them that I did not know anything about them if you want to_.\" And all the while he, Tom, had known this Barnard, or whatever his name was, and had fixed things so that he and Barnard might be together at Temple Camp. Barnard was a grown-up fellow, Roy told himself, and a soldier, and he didn't exactly blame Tom, but....  And then their trails crossed again, right there at the foot of the elevator shaft, where Tom was waiting to go up.  Roy's first impulse was to brush past his friend saying nothing, but when he had all but reached the door he wheeled about and said, \"If you want to hand out any lies to the troop, you'd better do it yourself; I'm not going to do it for you.\"  \"What?\" said Tom, a little startled out of his usual stolid manner.  \"Oh, you know what, all right,\" Roy answered sneeringly. \"You thought I'd never find out, didn't you? You didn't think I'd go up to the office. You thought you'd get away with it and have me lying to the troop--the fellows that used to be your friends before you met Barnyard or whatever you call him. I know who he is, all right. If you wanted to give him our cabins, him and his troop, why didn't you come and say so? Gee whiz, we would have been willing to do them a good turn. We've camped in tents before, if it comes to that.\"  Tom stood perfectly motionless, with no more expression, either of anger or sorrow or surprise, than he usually showed. His big, tight set, resolute mouth was very conspicuous, but Roy did not notice that. The elevator came down, and the metallic sound of its door opening was emphasized in the tense silence which followed Roy's tirade.  \"Going up,\" the colored boy said.  The door rolled shut and still Tom Slade stood there, stolid and without any show of emotion, looking straight at Roy. \"I didn't ever tell a lie--not since I got in with the scouts,\" he said simply.  \"Well, that makes two,\" said Roy mercilessly; \"do you mean to tell me you don't know what's-his-name--Barnard? Will you stand there and say you don't know him?\"  \"I do know him,\" Tom said; \"he saved my life in France.\"  \"And didn't you tell me only ten minutes ago that I could tell the fellows that you didn't know anything about--about that troop--about him and his troop? Didn't you? Do you deny that you did? You told me I could go back and lie to the fellows--you did! If you think I'll do that you've got another guess, I can tell you that much!\"  \"I never told you you should lie,\" said Tom with straightforward simplicity, \"and I admit I forgot about the cabins. I was away two summers. I had a lot of different things to think about. I got shell-shocked the very same night I met that fellow, and that's got something to do with it, maybe. But I wouldn't stand here, I wouldn't, and try to prove that I didn't tell a lie. If you want to think I did, go ahead and think so. And if the rest of the troop want to think so, let them do it. If anybody says I forgot about the scouts, he lies. And you can tell them they won't lose anything, either; you can tell them I said so. I ain't changed. Didn't I--didn't I ride my motorcycle all the way from Paris to the coast--through the floods--didn't I? Do you think it's going to be hard to make everything right? I--I can do anything--I can. And I didn't lie, either. You go up to Temple Camp on the first of August like you--like we--always did; that's all _I_ say.\"  He was excited now, and his hand trembled, and Roy looked at him a bit puzzled, but he was neither softened nor convinced. \"Didn't you as much as say you didn't know anything about who made that application--didn't you?\" Roy demanded.  \"I said it good and plain and you can go and tell them so, too,\" Tom said.  \"And you do know this fellow named Barnard, don't you?\"  \"I know him and he saved my life,\" Tom said, \"and if you----\"  \"Going up,\" the colored boy called again.  And the young fellow, scout and soldier, who would not bother to prove his truthfulness to his old companion and friend, was gone. He had hit his own trail in his own way, as he usually did; a long devious, difficult, lonesome trail. The clearly defined trail of the sidewalk leading to the troop room, where a few words of explanation might have straightened everything out, was not the trail for Tom Slade, scout. He would straighten things out another way. He would face this thing, not run away from it, just as he had set his big resolute mouth and faced Pete Connigan. They would lose nothing, these boys. Let them think what they might, they would lose nothing. To be falsely accused, what was that, provided these boys lost nothing? That was all that counted. What difference did it make if they thought he had lied and deceived them, so long as _he_ knew that he had not?  And what a lot of fuss about three cabins! Had he not the power to straighten out his own mistake in the best possible way--the scout way? And how was that? By going to Mr. Burton and taking the matter up and perhaps causing disappointment to those boys out in Ohio, for the sake of these boys in Bridgeboro? Robbing Peter to pay Paul?  Perhaps Mr. Burton would have done that, under all the circumstances. Perhaps Mr. John Temple, head of the whole shebang, would have approved this--under the circumstances. Perhaps the average clerk would have proposed this; would have suggested hitting this convenient little trail, about as short and prosy as a back alley. All you need on that trail is a typewriter machine. Perhaps Tom Slade was not a good clerk. His way out of the difficulty was a longer and more circuitous way. But it was the scout way. He was a scout and he hit the long trail.     CHAPTER XIII  ROY'S TRAIL   As for Roy, he went home feeling heavy of heart, but he was not sorry for what he had said. He had known that Tom had been slipping away from the troop and that his interest in the old associations had waned ever since his return from France. But that Tom should have lied to him and that he should use Temple Camp and that old beloved spot up on the hill for new friends, deliberately giving them precedence over these companions of his real scouting days--_that_ Roy could not stand. And he told himself that he was through with Tom, even as Tom was through with the troop.  The trail of Roy and his friends is short and easy to follow, and it is not the main trail of this story. It took them into the city where they bought a tent, (not a very large one, for they could not get together much money), but big enough to bunk in and enable them to spend their vacation at the beloved, familiar spot. He said that \"he should worry about that fellow Barnard,\" and that he guessed Tom's fondness for that individual was like Peewee's fondness for mince pie--a case of love at first bite. But did he forget about Tom, and miss him at the meetings?  We shall have to guess as to that. Tom was seldom mentioned, at all events. The first member of the Bridgeboro troop to outgrow his companions and turn his thoughts to new friends and associates had broken away from the hallowed circle and deserted them, and"]]]
