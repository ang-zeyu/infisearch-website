The starlings have increased so fast in this limited region since their first permanent settlement in Central Park about 1890 that farmers and suburban dwellers have feared that they might become as undesirable citizens as some other Europeans -- the brown rat, the house mouse, and the English sparrow. But a very thorough investigation conducted by the United States Bureau of Biological Survey (Bulletin No. 868, 1921) is most reassuring in its results.  Let us first state the case for the prosecution: (1) the starling must plead guilty to a fondness for cultivated cherries; (2) he is often a persecutor of native birds, like the bluebird and flicker; (3) his roosts, where he sometimes congregates in thousands in the autumn, are apt to become public nuisances, offensive alike to the eye, the nose and the ear.  But these offences are not so very serious after all. He does not eat so many cherries as our old friend the robin, though his depredations are more conspicuous, for whereas the robins in ones and twos will pilfer steadily from many trees for many days without attracting notice, a crowd of starlings is occasionally observed to descend en masse upon a single tree and strip it in a few hours. Naturally such high-handed procedure is observed by many and deeply resented by the owner of the tree, who suffers the steady but less spectacular raids of the robins without serious disquiet,  Less can be said in defense of the starling's scandalous treatment of some native birds. \"Unrelenting perseverance dominates the starling's activities when engaged in a controversy over a nesting site. More of its battles are won by dogged persistence in annoying its victim than by bold aggression, and its irritating tactics are sometimes carried to such a point that it seems almost as if the bird were actuated more by a morbid pleasure of annoying its neighbors than by any necessity arising from a scarcity of nesting sites...  \"In contests with the flicker the starling frequently makes up in numbers what disadvantage it may have in size. Typical of such combats was the one observed on May 9, at Hartford, Conn., where a group of starlings and a flicker were in controversy over a newly excavated nest. The number of starlings varied, but as many as 6 were noted at one time. Attention was first attracted to the dispute by a number of starlings in close proximity to the hole and by the sounds of a tussle within. Presently a flicker came out dragging a starling after him. The starling continued the battle outside long enough to allow one of its comrades to slip into the nest. Of course the flicker had to repeat the entire performance. He did this for about half an hour, when he gave up, leaving the starlings in possession of the nest...  \"Economically considered, the starling is the superior of either the flicker, the robin, or the English sparrow, three of the species with which it comes in contact in its breeding operations. The eggs and young of bluebirds and wrens may be protected by the use of nest boxes with circular openings 1 1/2 inches or less in diameter. This leaves the purple martin the only species readily subject to attack by the starling, whose economic worth may be considered greater than that of the latter, but in no case was the disturbance of a well-established colony of martins noted.\"  As for the nuisance of a big established roost of starlings, it may be abated by nightly salvos of Roman candles or blank cartridges, continued for a week or at most ten days.  So much for the starling in his aspect as an undesirable citizen. Government investigators, by a long-continued study, have discovered that his good deeds far outnumber his misdemeanors. Primarily he feeds on noxious insects and useless wild fruits. Small truck gardens and individual cherry trees may be occasionally raided by large flocks with disastrous results in a small way. But on the whole he is a useful frequenter of our door-yards who 'pays his way by destroying hosts of cut-worms and equally noxious' insects. \"A thorough consideration of the evidence at hand indicates that, based on food habits, the adult starling is the economic superior of the robin, catbird, flicker, red-winged blackbird, or grackle.\" Need more be said for him?   BIRDS CONSPICUOUSLY BLACK AND WHITE    Red-headed Woodpecker   Hairy Woodpecker   Downy Woodpecker   Yellow-bellied Woodpecker   Chewink   Snowflake   Rose-breasted Grosbeak   Bobolink   Black-poll Warbler   Black-and-white Creeping Warbler  See also the Swallows; the Shrikes; Nuthatches and Titmice, the Kingbird and other Flycatchers; the Nighthawk; the Redstart; and the following Warblers: the Myrtle; the Bay-breasted, the Blackburnian; and the Black-throated Blue Warbler.  BIRDS CONSPICUOUSLY BLACK AND WHITE   RED-HEADED WOODPECKER (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) Woodpecker   family  Called also: TRI-COLOR, RED-HEAD  Length -- 8.50 to 9.75 inches. An inch or less smaller than the   robin. Male and Female -- Head, neck, and throat crimson; breast and   underneath white; back black and white; wings and tail blue   black, with broad white band on wings conspicuous in flight. Range -- United States, east of Rocky Mountains and north to   Manitoba. Migrations -- Abundant but irregular migrant. Most commonly seen   in Autumn, and rarely resident.  In thinly populated sections, where there are few guns about, this is still one of the commonest as it is perhaps the most conspicuous member of the woodpecker family, but its striking glossy black-and-white body and its still more striking crimson head, flattened out against the side of a tree like a target, where it is feeding, have made it all too tempting a mark for the rifles of the sportsmen and the sling-shots of small boys. As if sufficient attention were not attracted to it by its plumage, it must needs keep up a noisy, guttural rattle, ker-r-ruck, ker-r-ruck, very like a tree-toad's call, and flit about among the trees with the restlessness of a fly-catcher. Yet, in spite of these invitations for a shot to the passing gunner, it still multiplies in districts where nuts abound, being \"more common than the robin\" about Washington, says John Burroughs.  All the familiar woodpeckers have two characteristics most prominently exemplified in this red-headed member of their tribe. The hairy, the downy, the crested, the red-bellied, the sapsucker, and the flicker have each a red mark somewhere about their heads as if they had been wounded there and bled a little -- some more, some less; and the figures of all of them, from much flattening against tree-trunks, have become high-shouldered and long-waisted.  The red-headed woodpecker selects, by preference, a partly decayed tree in which to excavate a hole for its nest, because the digging is easier, and the sawdust and chips make a softer lining than green wood. Both male and female take turns in this hollowing-out process. The one that is off duty is allowed twenty minutes for refreshments, \"consisting of grubs, beetles, ripe apples or cherries, corn, or preferably beech-nuts. At a loving call from its mate in the hollow tree, it returns promptly to perform its share of the work, when the carefully observed time is up.\" The heap of sawdust at the bottom of the hollow will eventually cradle from four to six glossy-white eggs.  This woodpecker has the thrifty habit of storing away nuts in the knot-holes of trees, between cracks in the bark, or in decayed fence rails--too often a convenient storehouse at which the squirrels may help themselves. But it is the black snake that enters the nest and eats the young family, and that is a more deadly foe than even the sportsman or the milliner.   HAIRY WOODPECKER (Dryobates villosus) Woodpecker family  Length--9 to 10 inches. About the size of the robin. Male--Black and white above, white beneath. White stripe down the   back, composed of long hair-like feathers. Brightred band on   the nape of neck. Wings striped and dashed with black and   white. Outer tail feathers white, without bars. White stripe   about eyes and on sides of the head. Female--Without the red band on head, and body more brownish than   that of the male. Range--Eastern parts of United States, from the Canadian border   to the Carolinas. Migrations--Resident throughout its range.  The bill of the woodpecker is a hammering tool, well fitted for its work. Its mission in life is to rid the trees of insects, which hide beneath the bark, and with this end in view, the bird is seen clinging to the trunks and branches of trees through fair and wintry weather, industriously scanning every inch for the well-known signs of the boring worm or destructive fly.  In the autumn the male begins to excavate his winter quarters, carrying or throwing out the chips, by which this good workman is known, with his beak, while the female may make herself cosey or not, as she chooses, in an abandoned hole. About her comfort he seems shamefully unconcerned. Intent only on his own, he drills a perfectly round hole, usually on the underside of a limb where neither snow nor wind can harm him, and digs out a horizontal tunnel in the dry, brittle wood in the very heart of the tree, before turning downward into the deep, pear-shaped chamber, where he lives in selfish solitude. But when the nesting season comes, how devoted he is temporarily to the mate he has neglected and even abused through the winter! Will she never learn that after her clear-white eggs are laid and her brood raised he will relapse into the savage and forget all his tender wiles?  The hairy woodpecker, like many another bird and beast, furnishes much doubtful weather lore for credulous and inexact observers. \"When the woodpecker pecks low on the trees, expect warm weather\" is a common saying, but when different individuals are seen pecking at the same time, one but a few feet from the ground,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1889"],["title","Bird Neighbors (#8)"],["body"," another among the high branches, one may make the prophecy that pleases him best.  The hairy woodpeckers love the deep woods. They are drummers, not singers; but when walking in the desolate winter woods even the drumming and tapping of the busy feathered workmen on a resonant limb is a solace, giving a sense of life and cheerful activity which is invigorating.   DOWNY WOODPECKER (Dryobates pubescens) Woodpecker family  Length -- 6 to 7 inches. About the size of the English sparrow. Male -- Black above, striped with white. Tail shaped like a wedge   Outer tail feathers white, and barred with black. Middle tail   feathers black. A black stripe on top of head, and distinct   white band over and under the eyes. Red patch on upper side of   neck. Wings, with six white bands crossing them transversely;   white underneath. Female -- Similar, but without scarlet on the nape, which is   white. Range -- Eastern North America, from Labrador to Florida. Migrations -- Resident all the year throughout its range.  The downy woodpecker is similar to his big relative, the hairy woodpecker, in color and shape, though much smaller. His outer tail feathers are white, barred with black, but the hairy's white outer tail feathers lack these distinguishing marks.  He is often called a sapsucker -- though quite another bird alone merits that name -- from the supposition that he bores into the trees for the purpose of sucking the sap; but his tongue is ill adapted for such use, being barbed at the end, and most ornithologists consider the charge libellous. It has been surmised that he bores the numerous little round holes close together, so often seen, with the idea of attracting insects to the luscious sap. The woodpeckers never drill for insects in live wood. The downy actually drills these little holes in apple and other trees to feed upon the inner milky bark of the tree -- the cambium layer. The only harm to be laid to his account is that, in his zeal, he sometimes makes a ring of small holes so continuous as to inadvertently damage the tree by girdling it. The bird, like most others, does not debar himself entirely from fruit diet, but enjoys berries, especially poke-berries.  He is very social with birds and men alike. In winter he attaches himself to strolling bands of nuthatches and chickadees, and in summer is fond of making friendly visits among village folk, frequenting the shade trees of the streets and grapevines of back gardens. He has even been known to fearlessly peck at flies on window panes.  In contrast to his large brother woodpecker, who is seldom drawn from timber lands, the little downy member of the family brings the comfort of his cheery presence to country homes, beating his rolling tattoo in spring on some resonant limb under our windows in the garden with a strength worthy of a larger drummer.  This rolling tattoo, or drumming, answers several purposes: by it he determines whether the tree is green or hollow; it startles insects from their lurking places underneath the bark, and it also serves as a love song.   YELLOW-BELLIED WOODPECKER (Sphyrapicus varius) Woodpecker family  Called also: THE SAPSUCKER; [YELLOW-BELLIED SAPSUCKER, AOU 1998]  Length -- 8 to 8.6 inches. About one-fifth smaller than the   robin. Male -- Black, white, and yellowish white above, with bright-red   crown, chin, and throat. Breast black, in form of crescent A   yellowish-white line, beginning at bill and passing below eye,   merges into the pale yellow of the bird underneath. Wings   spotted with white, and coverts chiefly white. Tail black;   white on middle of feathers. Female -- Paler, and with head and throat white. Range -- Eastern North America, from Labrador to Central America. Migrations -- April. October. Resident north of Massachusetts.   Most common in autumn.  It is sad to record that this exquisitely marked woodpecker, the most jovial and boisterous of its family, is one of the very few bird visitors whose intimacy should be discouraged. For its useful appetite for slugs and insects which it can take on the wing with wonderful dexterity, it need not be wholly condemned. But as we look upon a favorite maple or fruit tree devitalized or perhaps wholly dead from its ravages, we cannot forget that this bird, while a most abstemious fruit-eater, has a pernicious and most intemperate thirst for sap. Indeed, it spends much of its time in the orchard, drilling holes into the freshest, most vigorous trees; then, when their sap begins to flow, it siphons it into an insatiable throat, stopping in its orgie only long enough to snap at the insects that have been attracted to the wounded tree by the streams of its heart-blood now trickling down its sides. Another favorite pastime is to strip the bark off a tree, then peck at the soft wood underneath -- almost as fatal a habit. It drills holes in maples in early spring for sap only. If it drills holes in fruit trees it is for the cambium layer, a soft, pulpy, nutritious under-bark.  These woodpeckers have a variety of call-notes, but their rapid drumming against the limbs and trunks of trees is the sound we always associate with them and the sound that Mr. Bicknell says is the love-note of the family.  Unhappily, these birds, that many would be glad to have decrease in numbers, take extra precautions for the safety of their young by making very deep excavations for their nests, often as deep as eighteen or twenty inches.   THE CHEWINK (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) Finch family  Called also: GROUND ROBIN; TOWHEE; TOWHEE BUNTING; TOWHEE GROUND FINCH; GRASEL; [EASTERN TOWHEE, AOU 1998]  Length -- 8 to 8.5 inches. About one-fifth smaller than the   robin. Male -- Upper parts black, sometimes margined with rufous. Breast   white; chestnut color on sides and rump. Wings marked with   white. Three outer feathers of tail striped with white,   conspicuous in flight. Bill black and stout. Red eyes; feet   brown. Female -- Brownish where the male is black. Abdomen shading from   chestnut to white in the centre. Range -- From Labrador, on the north, to the Southern States;   West to the Rocky Mountains. Migrations -- April. September and October. Summer resident. Very   rarely a winter resident at the north.  The unobtrusive little chewink is not infrequently mistaken for a robin, because of the reddish chestnut on its under parts. Careful observation, however, shows important distinctions. It is rather smaller and darker in color; its carriage and form are not those of the robin, but of the finch. The female is smaller still, and has an olive tint in her brown back. Her eggs are inconspicuous in color, dirty white speckled with brown, and laid in a sunken nest on the ground. Dead leaves and twigs abound, and form, as the anxious mother fondly hopes, a safe hiding place for her brood. So careful concealment, however, brings peril to the fledglings, for the most cautious bird-lover may, and often does, inadvertently set his foot on the hidden nest.  The chewink derives its name from the fancied resemblance of its note to these syllables, while those naming it \"towhee\" hear the sound to-whick, to-whick, to-whee. Its song is rich, full, and pleasing, and given only when the bird has risen to the branches above its low foraging ground.  It frequents the border of swampy places and bushy fields. It is generally seen in the underbrush, picking about among the dead leaves for its steady diet of earthworms and larvae of insects, occasionally regaling itself with a few dropping berries and fruit.  When startled, the bird rises not more than ten or twelve feet from the earth, and utters its characteristic calls. On account of this habit of flying low and grubbing among the leaves, it is sometimes called the ground robin. In the South our modest and useful little food-gatherer is often called grasel, especially in Louisiana, where it is white-eyed, and is much esteemed, alas! by epicures.   SNOWFLAKE (Plectrophenax nivalis) Finch family  Called also: SNOW BUNTING [AOU 1998]; WHITEBIRD; SNOWBIRD; SNOW   LARK  Length -- 7 to 7.5 inches. About one-fourth smaller than the   robin. Male and Female -- Head, neck, and beneath soiled white, with a   few reddish-brown feathers on top of head, and suggesting an   imperfect collar. Above, grayish brown obsoletely streaked with   black, the markings being most conspicuous in a band between   shoulders. Lower tail feathers black; others, white and all   edged with white. Wings brown, white, and gray. Plumage   unusually variable. In summer dress (in arctic regions) the   bird is almost white. Range -- Circumpolar regions to Kentucky (in winter only). Migrations -- Midwinter visitor; rarely, if ever, resident south   of arctic regions.  These snowflakes (mentioned collectively, for it is impossible to think of the bird except in great flocks) are the \"true spirits of the snowstorm,\" says Thoreau. They are animated beings that ride upon it, and have their life in it. By comparison with the climate of the arctic regions, no doubt our hardiest winter weather seems luxuriously mild to them. We associate them only with those wonderful midwinter days when sky, fields, and woods alike are white, and a \"hard, dull bitterness of cold\" drives every other bird and beast to shelter. It is said they often pass the night buried beneath the snow. They have been seen to dive beneath it to escape a hawk.  Whirling about in the drifting snow to catch the seeds on the tallest stalks that the wind in the open meadows uncovers, the snowflakes suggest a lot of dead leaves being blown through the all-pervading whiteness. Beautiful soft brown, gray, and predominating black-and-white coloring distinguish these capricious visitors from the slaty junco, the \"snowbird\" more commonly known. They are, indeed, the only birds we have that are nearly white; and rarely, if ever, do they rise far above the ground their plumage so admirably imitates.
