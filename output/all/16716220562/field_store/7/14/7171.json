That he will be beaten I've no doubt. We'll conquer Canada and settle North American affairs for all time. Perhaps it will be the last great war.\"  Robert was listening with the closest attention, and it seemed to him that the New Yorker was right. With Canada conquered and the French power expelled it would be the last great war so far as North America was concerned? How fallible men are! How prone they are to think when they have settled things for themselves they have settled them also for all future generations!  \"And then,\" continued Mr. Hervey, \"New York will become a yet greater port than it now is. It may even hope to rival Philadelphia in size and wealth. It will be London's greatest feeder.\"  The soup, not neglected in the least, gave way to fish, and then to many kinds of meat, in which game, bear, deer and wild fowl were conspicuous. Robert took a little of everything, but he was absorbed in the talk. He felt that these men were in touch with great affairs, and, however much they diverged from such subjects they had them most at heart. It was a thrilling thought that the future of North America, in some degree at least, might be determined around that very table at which he was sitting as a guest. He had knowledge and imagination enough to understand that it was not the armies that determined the fate of nations, but the men directing them who stood behind them farther back, in the dark perhaps, obscure, maybe never to become fully known, but clairvoyant and powerful just the same. He was resolved not to lose a word. So he leaned forward just a little in his seat, and his blue eyes sparkled.  \"Dagaeoga is glad to be here,\" said Tayoga in an undertone.  \"So I am, Tayoga. They talk of things of which I wish to hear.\"  \"As I told you, these be sachems with whom we sit. They be not chiefs who lead in battle, but, like the sachems, they plan, and, like the medicine men, they make charms and incantations that influence the souls of the warriors and also the souls of those who lead them to battle.\"  \"The same thought was in my own mind.\"  Wine smuggled from France or Spain was served to the men, though young Lennox and the Onondaga touched none. In truth, it was not offered to them, Master Jacobus saying, with a glance at Robert:  \"I have never allowed you and Tayoga to have anything stronger than coffee in my house, and although you are no longer under my charge I intend to keep to the rule.\"  \"We wish nothing more, sir,\" said Robert.  \"As for me,\" said the Onondaga, \"I shall never touch any kind of liquor. I know that it goes ill with my race.\"  \"Yours, I understand, is the Onondaga nation,\" said Mr. Hervey, looking at him attentively.  \"The Onondaga, and I belong to the clan of the Bear,\" replied Tayoga proudly. \"The Hodenosaunee have held the balance in this war.\"  \"That I know full well. I gladly give the great League ample credit. It has been a wise policy of the English to deal honestly and fairly with your people. In general the French surpass us in winning and holding the affections of the native races, but some good angel has directed us in our dealings with the Six Nations. Without their Indians the French could have done little against us. I hear of one of their leaders who has endeared himself to them in the most remarkable manner. There has been much talk in New York of the Chevalier de St. Luc, and being nearer the seat of action you've perhaps heard some of it here in Albany, Jacobus!\"  Robert leaned a little farther forward and concentrated every faculty on the talk, but he said nothing.  \"Yes, we've heard much of him, Alan,\" replied Master Jacobus. \"I think he's the most dangerous foe that we have among Montcalm's lieutenants. He passes like a flame along the border, and yet report speaks well of him, too. All our men who have come in contact with him say he is a gallant and chivalrous foe.\"  Robert glanced at Master Benjamin Hardy, but the great merchant's face was blank.  \"Robert saw him, too, when he was a prisoner among the French,\" said Mr. Huysman.  Mr. Hervey looked at Robert, who said:  \"I saw him several times at Ticonderoga, where he was the chief adviser of Montcalm during the battle, and I've seen him often elsewhere. All that they say about him is true. He's a master of forest warfare, and his following is devoted.\"  He glanced again at Benjamin Hardy, but the New Yorker was helping himself to an especially tender bit of venison and his face expressed nothing but appreciation of his food. Robert sighed under his breath. They would never do more than generalize about St. Luc. Tayoga and he asked presently to be excused. The men would sit much longer over their nuts and wine, and doubtless when the lads were gone they would enter more deeply into those plans and ventures that lay so near their hearts.  \"I think I shall wander among the trees behind the house,\" said Tayoga, when they were out of the dining-room. \"I want fresh air, and I wish to hear the wind blowing among the leaves. Then I can fancy that I am back in the great forest, and my soul will be in peace.\"  \"And commune, perhaps, with Tododaho on his star,\" said Robert, not lightly but in all seriousness.  \"Even so, Dagaeoga. He may have something to tell me, but if he does not it is well to be alone for a while.\"  \"I won't let you be alone just yet, because I'm going out with you, but I don't mean to stay long, and then you can commune with your own soul.\"  It was a beautiful night, cooled by a breeze which came crisp and strong from the hills, rustling through the foliage, already beginning to take on the tints of early autumn. After the warm room and many courses of food it was very grateful to the two lads who stood under the trees listening to the pleasant song of the breeze. But in five minutes Robert said:  \"I'm going back into the house now, Tayoga. I can see your star in the clear heavens, and perhaps Tododaho will speak to you.\"  \"I shall see. Farewell for an hour, Dagaeoga.\"  Robert went in.     CHAPTER III  THE PURSUIT OF GARAY   Robert paused a few moments in the hall. Sounds of voices came from the dining room, showing that the supper was still in progress. He thought of going back there to listen to the talk, but he reflected that the time for youth at the table had passed. They were in their secrets now, and he strolled toward the large room that contained the chest of drawers.  A dim light from an unshuttered window shone into the apartment and it was in his mind to wait there for Tayoga, but he stopped suddenly at the door and stared in astonishment. A shadow was moving in the room, thin, impalpable and noiseless, but it had all the seeming of a man. Moreover, it had a height and shape that were familiar, and it reminded him of the spy, Garay.  He was too much surprised to move, and so he merely stared. Garay knelt before the chest of drawers and began to work at it with a small sharp tool that he drew from his coat. Robert saw, too, that his attention was centered on the third drawer from the top. Then he came out of his catalepsy and started forward, but in doing so his foot made a slight noise on the floor.  Garay leaped to his feet, gave Robert one glance and then disappeared through the open window, with incredible dexterity and speed. Robert stared again. The man was there and then he was not. It could not be Garay, but his ghost, some illusion, a trick of the eye or mind. Then he knew it was no fancy. With extraordinary assurance the man had come there to rifle the drawer--for what purpose Robert knew not.  He ran to the window, but saw nothing save the peaceful night, the waving trees and the quiet lawn lying beyond. Then he walked to the chest and examined the third drawer, noticing new scratches around the lock. There was not the slightest doubt that Garay had been trying to open it.  He went to the door, resolved to tell Mr. Huysman at once of the attempt upon the chest, but he stopped irresolute. The low sounds of talk still came from the dining-room. He was only a boy and his was a most improbable tale. They might think he had been dreaming, though he knew full well that he had seen straight and true. And then Garay was gone, leaving no trace. No, he would not interrupt Mr. Huysman now, but he would talk it over with Tayoga.  He found the Onondaga standing among the trees, gazing with rapt vision at his star.  \"Did Tododaho speak to you?\" asked Robert.  \"He did,\" replied Tayoga earnestly.  \"What did he say?\"  \"That the great war will go on, and that you and I and the Great Bear, who is away, will encounter many more perils. The rest is veiled.\"  \"And while we take our ease, Tayoga, our enemies are at work.\"  \"What does Dagaeoga mean?\"  \"I went into the room containing the chest of drawers, the story of which you read, and found there Garay, the spy, trying to open it.\"  \"Dagaeoga does not dream?\"  \"Oh, I thought for a moment or two that I did, but it was reality. Garay escaped through the open window, and, on the lock of the third drawer, were scratches that he left where he had been working with a sharp tool. Come, Tayoga, and look at them.\"  The two went into the house. Robert lighted a lamp for better light, and Tayoga knelt before the drawer, giving it a long and close examination.  \"Garay is a very clever man,\" he said at last, \"much cleverer, perhaps, than we gave him the credit of being.\"  \"I think so too,\" said Robert.  \"As events show, he came into this house to obtain the papers in this drawer, and you and I feel quite certain that those papers concern you. And as you saw him and the slaver together, it indicates that they have some plot against you, what I know not. But the papers here have much to do with it.\"  \"Do you think I should speak of it to Master Jacobus and Mr. Hardy now?\"  \"I think not, Dagaeoga. Whatever is the mystery about you it is evident that they do not wish to tell you of it yet. So,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18774"],["title","The Sun of Quebec: A Story of a Great Crisis (#8)"],["body","what you are, you will not ask them, but wait until such time as they see fit. I think these scratches on the lock were made by the sharp point of a hunting knife. Garay did not succeed in opening it, though it is likely that he would have done so if you had not interrupted him.\"  \"When he saw me he was gone like a flash. I did not know a man could skip through a window with so much celerity.\"  \"One has to be skillful at such things to carry on the trade of a spy. That is why he could have opened this lock, large and strong as it is, with the point of his hunting knife had he been allowed time, and that is why he flew through the window like a bird when you came upon him.\"  He examined the window, and then laughed a little.  \"But he did not go without leaving further proof of himself,\" he said. \"Here on the sill is the faintest trace of blood where he bruised his hand or wrist in his rapid flight.\"  \"Suppose you try to trail him, Tayoga. I believe you could find out which way he went, even here in Albany. The men will talk in there a long time, and won't miss us. There's a fair moon.\"  \"I will try,\" said Tayoga in his precise fashion. \"First we will look at the ground under the window.\"  They went outside and the Onondaga examined the grass beneath it, the drop being five or six feet.  \"As he had to come down hard, he ought to have left traces,\" said Robert.  \"So he did, Dagaeoga. I find several imprints, and there also are two or three drops of blood, showing that he scratched his hand considerably when he went through the window. Here go the traces, leading north. Garay, of course, knows this immediate locality well, as he observed it closely when he made his attempt upon you before. It is lucky that it rained yesterday, leaving the ground soft. We may be able to follow him quite a distance.\"  \"If anybody can follow him, you can.\"  \"It is friendship that makes Dagaeoga speak so. The trail continues in its original course, though I think that sooner or later it will turn toward the river.\"  \"Meaning that Garay will meet the slaver somewhere, and that the natural place of the latter is on the water.\"  \"Dagaeoga reasons well. That, I think, is just what Garay will do. It is likely, too, that he will curve about the town. If he went upon a hard street we would lose him, since he would leave no trail there, but he will keep away because he does not wish to be seen. Ah, he now turns from the houses and into the fields! We shall be able to follow him. The moon is our friend. It is pouring down rays enough to disclose his trail, if trail he leaves.\"  They were soon beyond the houses and climbed three fences dividing the fields. At the third, Tayoga said:  \"Garay paused here and rested. There is a drop of blood on the top rail. He probably sat there and looked back to see if he was followed. Ah, here is a splinter on a lower rail freshly broken!\"  \"What do you make of it, Tayoga?\"  \"The spy was angry, angry that his effort, made at such great risk, should have failed through the mere chance of your coming into the room at that particular time. He was angry, too, that he had bruised his hand so badly that it bled, and continued to bleed. So, his disappointment made him grind his heel against the rail and break the splinter.\"  \"I'm glad he felt that way. A man in his trade ought to suffer many disappointments.\"  \"When he had satisfied himself that no pursuit was in sight, he jumped to the ground. Here are deep imprints made by his descending weight, and now he becomes less careful. Albany is behind us, and he thinks all danger of pursuit has passed. I see a little brook ahead, and it is safe to say that he will kneel at it and drink.\"  \"And also to bathe his wounded hand.\"  \"Even so, Dagaeoga. Lo, it is as we said! Here are the imprints of his knees, showing that he refreshed himself with water after his hurried flight. The ground on the other side of the brook is soft and we shall be able to find his imprints there, even if it were pitch dark. Now I think they will turn very soon toward the river.\"  \"Yes, they're curving. Here they go, Tayoga.\"  The trail led across a field, over a hill, and then through a little wood, where Tayoga was compelled to go slowly, hunting about like a hound, trying to trace a scent. But wherever he lost it he finally picked it up again, and, when they emerged from the trees, they saw the river not far ahead.  \"Our trail will end at the stream,\" said Tayoga confidently.  As he had predicted, the imprints led directly to the river, and there ended their pursuit also. The Hudson flowed on in silence. There was nothing on its bosom.  \"The slaver in a boat was waiting for him here,\" said Tayoga. \"I think we can soon find proof of it.\"  A brief examination of the bank showed traces where the prow had rested.  \"It was probably a boat with oars for two,\" he said. \"The slaver sat in it most of the time, but he grew impatient at last and leaving the boat walked up the bank a little distance. Here go his steps, showing very plainly in the soft earth in the moonlight, and here come those of Garay to meet him. They stood at the top of the bank under this oak, and the spy told how he had failed. Doubtless, the slaver was much disappointed, but he did not venture to upbraid Garay, because the spy is as necessary to him as he is to the spy. After they talked it over they walked down the bank together--see their trails going side by side--entered the boat and rowed away. I wish the water would leave a trail, too, that we might follow them, but it does not.\"  \"Do you think they'll dare go back to Albany?\"  \"The slaver will. What proof of any kind about anything have we? Down! Dagaeoga, down!\"  Fitting the action to the word, the Onondaga seized Robert by the shoulders suddenly and dragged him to the earth, falling with him. As he did so a bullet whistled where Robert's head had been and a little puff of smoke rose from a clump of bushes on the opposite shore.  \"They're there in their boat among the bushes that grow on the water's edge!\" exclaimed Tayoga. \"I ought to have thought of it, but I did see a movement among the bushes in time! I cannot see their faces or the boat, either, but I know it is Garay and the slaver.\"  \"I have no weapon,\" said Robert. \"It did not occur to me that I would need one.\"  \"I have a pistol in my tunic. I always carry one when I am in the white man's country. It is wise.\"  \"Under the circumstances, I think we'd better slip away and leave the spy and the slaver to enjoy the river as they please, for to-night at least.\"  He was about to rise, but Tayoga pulled him down a second time and a report heavier than the first came from the far shore. Another bullet passed over their heads and struck with a sough in the trunk of a big tree beyond them.  \"That was from a rifle. The other was from a pistol,\" said Tayoga. \"It is the slaver, of course, who has the rifle, and they mean to make it very warm for us. Perhaps an unexpected chance gives them hope to do here what they expected to achieve later on.\"  \"Meaning a final disposition of me?\"  \"That was in my mind, Dagaeoga. I think it is you at whom they will shoot and you would better creep away. Lie almost flat and edge along until you come to the trees, which are about twenty yards behind us. There, you will be safe.\"  \"And leave you alone, Tayoga! What have I ever done to make you think I'd do such a thing?\"  \"It is not Tayoga whom they want. It is Dagaeoga. I cannot go without taking a shot at them, else my pistol would burn me inside my tunic. Be wise as I am, Dagaeoga. Always carry a pistol when you are in the white man's towns. Life is reasonably safe only in the red man's forest.\"  \"It looks as if you were right, Tayoga, but remember that I stay here with you as long as you stay.\"  \"Then keep close to the earth. Roll back a bit and you will be sheltered better by that little rise.\"  Robert obeyed, and it was well that he did so, as the heavy rifle cracked a second time, and a plowing bullet caused fine particles of earth to fly over him. Tayoga leveled his pistol at the flash and smoke, but did not pull the trigger.  \"Why didn't you fire, Tayoga?\" asked Robert.  \"I could not see well enough. They and their boat are still hidden by the bushes in which they remain, because from there they can command the bank where we lie.\"  \"Then it looks as if each side held the other. If they come out of the bushes you use your pistol on 'em, and if we retreat farther they use their rifle on us. You'll notice, Tayoga, that we're in a little dip, and if we go out of it on our far side in retreat we'll make a target of ourselves. If they leave the bushes on their far side to climb their own bank they come into view. It's checkmate for both.\"  \"It is so, Dagaeoga. It is a difficult position for you, but not for me. We of the red races learn to have patience, because we are not in such a hurry to consume time as you white people are.\"  \"That is true, but it is not a moment for a discussion of the relative merits of white and red.\"  \"We are likely to have plenty of leisure for it, since I think we are doomed to a long wait.\"  \"I think you're happy over it, Tayoga. Your voice has a pleased ring.\"  \"I'm not unhappy. I see a chance to gratify a curiosity that I have long had. I wish to see whether the white race, even in great danger, where it is most needed, has as much patience as the red. Ah, Dagaeoga, you were incautious! Do not raise your head again. You, at least, do not have as much patience as the occasion requires.\"  The third bullet had passed so near Robert that cold shivers raced over his body and he resolved not to raise his head again a single inch, no matter what the temptation.  \"Remember that it is you whom they want,\" said Tayoga in his precise, book English. \"Having the rifle they can afford to try shots at longer range, but with the pistol I must wait until I can see them clearly. Well, Dagaeoga, it is a fine evening, not too cold, "]]]
