Foresters (#8)"],["body","at, don't you think?\"  \"There's allers somethin' that ain't worth much to be got cheap,\" said the cowboy, \"but I don't look friendly none on payin' a cheap price for a horse. Speakin' generally, there's somethin' that every feller likes a whole lot, an' out here, where domestic life ain't our chief play, it's mostly a horse. Leastways, when I hit the long trail, I'll be just as sorry to leave some ponies behind as I will humans.\"  \"A horse can be a great chum,\" assented Wilbur. \"So can a dog.\"  \"No dogs in mine,\" said Bob-Cat emphatically, \"they reminds me too much o' sheep. But when it comes to a horse, I tell ye, there's a lot more in the deal than buyin' an animal to carry you; there's buyin' somethin' that all the money in the world can't bring you sometimes--an' that's a friend.\"  Wilbur waited a moment without reply, and then the cowboy, deliberately changing the topic to cloak any strain of sentiment which he thought he might have been betrayed into showing, continued:  \"How about saddles?\"  \"I'd been thinking about that,\" replied the boy, \"and I thought I'd wait until I got out here before deciding. You can't use an English saddle-tree, of course, and I hate it anyway, and one like yours is too big. Those lumbering Mexican saddles always look to me as if they were as big a load for a little pony to carry as a man.\"  \"Sure, they're heavy. But you can't do any ropin' without them. If you try 'n' rope on a small saddle the girth'll pretty near cut a pony in two. But you ain't got any ropin' to do, so I sh'd think an army saddle-tree would be about right. There's Rifle-Eye Bill comin' out of the bunk-house now. Ask him. He'll know.\"  Wilbur looked up, and saw emerging from the door of the bunk-house a tall, gaunt mountaineer. He strolled over to the corral with a long, loose-jointed stride.  \"Got him, all right, Bob-Cat, did you?\" he said in a measured drawl, then, turning to the boy, added: \"Glad to see you, son.\"  \"I've been hearing all about you, sir,\" answered Wilbur, \"and I'm awfully glad to meet you here.\" He was about to dismount, but noting that Bob-Cat had merely thrown a leg over the horn of his saddle, he stayed where he was.  The old Ranger looked him over critically and closely, so that Wilbur felt himself flushing under the direct gaze, though he met the clear gray eye of his new acquaintance without flinching. Presently the latter turned to the range-rider.  \"What do you think of him?\" he asked in a slow, curiously commanding way.  Bob-Cat squirmed uneasily.  \"You is sure annoyin',\" he said in an aggrieved manner, \"askin' me to go on record so plumb sudden. I'm no mind-reader.\"  There was a pause, but the Ranger quietly waited.  \"It's embarrassin',\" said Bob-Cat, \"to try an' trot out a verdic' on snap-jedgment. I don't know.\"  Rifle-Eye, quite unperturbed, looked at him steadily and inquiringly.  \"You know what you think,\" he said.  \"He's sure green,\" replied the cowboy, shrugging his shoulders in protest, \"an' he ain't much more humble-minded than a hen that's jest laid an egg of unusooal size, but I reckon he's got the makin's.\"  \"It's a good thing to be green,\" said the old Ranger thoughtfully, \"nothin' grows much after it's dry, Bob-Cat. The heart's got to be green anyway. Ye git hard to bend an' easy to break when ye're gettin' old.\"  \"Then it's a cinch you'll never get old,\" promptly responded the other.  But the mountaineer continued talking, half to himself:  \"An' he's too sure of himself! Wa'al, he's young yet. I've seen a pile o' sickness in my day, Bob-Cat, but that's about the easiest one to cure there is.\"  \"What is?\"  \"Bein' young. Well, son, ye'd better turn the pony in.\"  The boy dismounted, and, half in pique at the dubious character given him by Bob-Cat and half in thanks for the meeting at the station and the ride, he turned to the cowboy, and said:  \"I'm glad I've 'got the makings' anyway, and I'm much obliged, Bob-Cat, for all the yarns you told me on the trail. But, next time I come to the ranch I'll try not to be as green, and I know I'll not be as young.\"  The cowboy laughed.  \"It's no use tryin' to dodge Rifle-Eye,\" he said. \"You stand about as good a chance as if you was tryin' to sidestep a blizzard or parryin' the charge from a Gatlin' gun. If he asks a question you can gamble every chip in your pile that you're elected, and you've got to ante up with the answer whether it suits your hand or no.\"  Wilbur, following the suggestion of the Ranger, unsaddled his pony, turned him into the corral, and hung his saddle on the fence. Then together they went up to the house, where Wilbur met the boss, and after a few moments' chat they returned to the corral.  As the lad had come to the ranch especially for the purpose of buying a couple of ponies, he was anxious to transact the business as quickly as possible, and together with Bob-Cat and Rifle-Eye he scanned the horses in the enclosure, endeavoring to display, as he did so, what little knowledge of horseflesh he possessed. After the boy had commented on several, Rifle-Eye pointed out first one and then a second which he had previously decided on as being the best animals for the boy. But Wilbur's eye was attracted to a fine sorrel, and, turning to Rifle-Eye, he said decidedly:  \"I want that one!\"  The old Ranger, remarking quietly that it was a fine horse, but not suitable to the purpose for which Wilbur wanted the animal, passed on to the discussion of several other ponies near by, teaching the boy to discern the fine points of a horse, not for beauty, but for service.  But as soon as he had finished speaking, after a purely perfunctory assent, Wilbur burst out again:  \"But, Rifle-Eye, I really want that sorrel most.\"  \"You really think you want him?\"  \"Yes!\"  \"You wouldn't if you knew a little more about horses, son,\" said the Ranger. \"It's all right to be sure what you want, but what you want is to be sure that what you want is right.\"  \"Oh, I'm sure I'm right,\" answered the boy confidently.  \"You can't be too careful choosin' a horse,\" commented Rifle-Eye. \"Choosin' a horse is a good deal like pickin' out a sugar pine for shakes. You know what shakes are?\"  \"No, Rifle-Eye,\" answered the boy.  \"They're long, smooth, split sheets of wood that the old-timers used for shingles. There's lots of sugar pine that'll make the finest kind o' lumber, an' all of it's good for fuel, but there ain't one tree in a hundred that'll split naturally an' easily into shakes. An' there ain't more'n one man in a hundred as can tell when a tree will do. But when you do get one just right, it's worth any ten other trees. An' the pine that's good ain't because it's a pretty tree to look at, or an easy one to cut down, or because of any other reason than that the grain's right. Same way with a horse. It ain't for his looks, nor for his speed, nor because he's easy to ride, nor for his strength you want him, but because his grain's right.\"  \"Well, I'm sure that sorrel looks just right.\"  \"Do looks always tell?\"  \"Oh, I can always tell a horse by his looks,\" replied Wilbur boastfully. \"Anyhow, I want him.\"  \"Persistent?\" chuckled Bob-Cat, who was standing by enjoying every word, \"why, cockle-burs ain't nothin' to him.\"  \"But, supposin',\" the old scout began gently, \"I told you that the sorrel was the worst you could have, not the best?\"  \"But he ain't,\" broke in Bob-Cat, who could not bear to hear a friend's pony harshly criticised, \"that's one of Bluey's string, an' he allers had good horses.\"  \"There--you hear,\" said Wilbur triumphantly.  \"I said--for the boy, Bob-Cat,\" answered the old Ranger firmly.  \"I--I suppose you would have good reasons,\" said Wilbur, answering the old scout's question, \"but I want him just the same, and I don't see why I can't buy him, if he's for sale. It's my money!\"  \"Sure, it's your money. An' the sorrel's a good horse,\" said the cowboy, to whom the persistence of Wilbur was giving great delight.  The Ranger slowly turned his head in silent rebuke, but although Bob-Cat was conscious of it, he was enjoying the fun too much to stop.  \"You know he couldn't ride the sorrel, Bob-Cat,\" said Rifle-Eye reproachfully.  \"But I can ride him, I know,\" said Wilbur. \"I'm a good rider, really I am. And he looks gentle, besides. He is gentle, isn't he, Bob-Cat?\"  \"He's playful enough,\" was the reply, \"some like a kitten, an' he surely is plenty restless in his habits. But where he shines is nerves. Why, pard, he c'd make a parcel of females besieged by a mouse look as if they was posin' for a picter, they'd be so still by comparison. But he's gentle, all right.\"  \"I wouldn't want to try it if he was vicious, Rifle-Eye,\" said the boy appealingly, \"but I really can ride, and he looks like a good horse.\"  \"Are you buyin' this horse for your own pleasure or the work o' the Service? You're goin' to do your ridin' on my range, an' I reckon you'll admit I have some say.\"  \"But I can break him to the work of the Service. Do let me try him!\" Wilbur's persistence appeared in every look and word. \"I don't see why I can't try, anyway, and then if I can't do it, there's no harm done.\"  \"Can you throw a rope?\" queried the Ranger.  \"No,\" returned the boy promptly. \"I never learned. But I can try.\"  \"If you can't rope, how do you expect to saddle him? These ain't farm horses that you c'n harness or saddle while they eat oats out of your hand.\" He turned to the cowboy. \"Can the sorrel be saddled without ropin'?\"  \"Bluey does,\" was the reply, \"but I don't know that he'll let me.\"  \"Won't you saddle him for me, Bob-Cat? I know I can ride him if I have a fair show.\"  The range-rider turned to the old Ranger.  \"How about it?\" he said. \"The kid'll hunt leather for a while and then eat grass. But there's nothin' mean in the sorrel, an' he won't get hurt.\"  \"I'll ride him,\" said Wilbur stoutly.  \"You might, at that,\" rejoined Bob-Cat. \"He's a game little sport, Rifle-Eye,\" he added, turning to the tall figure beside him, \"why not let him play his hand"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18881"],["title","The Idiot (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net/)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

It was only proper that during the honey-moon, at least, of the happy couple hostilities between the Idiot and his fellow-boarders should cease. It was expecting too much of mankind, however, to look for a continued armistice, and the morning arrived when Nature once more reasserted herself, and trouble began. Just what it was that prompted the remark no one knows, but it happened that the Idiot did say that he thought that, after all, life on a canal-boat had its advantages. Mr. Pedagog, who had come into the dining-room in a slightly irritable frame of mind, induced perhaps by Mrs. Pedagog's insistence that as he was now part proprietor of the house he should be a little more prompt in making his contributions towards its maintenance, chose to take the remark as implying a reflection upon the way things were managed in the household.  \"Humph!\" he said. \"I had hoped that your habit of airing your idiotic views had been put aside for once and for all.\"  \"Very absurd hope, my dear sir,\" observed the Idiot. \"Views that are not aired become musty. Why shouldn't I give them an atmospheric opportunity once in a while?\"  \"Because they are the sort of views to which suffocation is the most appropriate end,\" snapped the School-Master. \"Any man who asserts, as you have asserted, that life on a canal-boat has its advantages, ought to go further, and prove his sincerity by living on one.\"  \"I can't afford it,\" said the Idiot, meekly. \"It isn't cheap by any manner of means. In the first place, you can't live happily on a canal-boat unless you can afford to keep horses. In fact, canal-boat life is a combination of the most expensive luxuries, since it combines yachting and driving with domesticity. Nevertheless, if you will put your mind on it, you will find that with a canal-boat for your home you can do a great many things that you can't do with a house.\"  \"I decline to put my mind on a canal-boat,\" said Mr. Pedagog, sharply, passing his coffee back to Mrs. Pedagog for another lump of sugar, thereby contributing to that good lady's discomfiture, since before their marriage the mere fact that the coffee had been poured by her fair hand had given it all the sweetness it needed; or at least that was what the School-Master had said, and more than once at that.  \"You are under no obligation to do so,\" the Idiot returned. \"Though if I had a mind like yours I'd put it on a canal-boat and have it towed away somewhere out of sight. These other gentlemen, however, I think, will agree with me when I say that the mere fact that a canal-boat can be moved about the country, and is in no sense a fixture anywhere, shows that as a dwelling-place it is superior to a house. Take this house, for instance. This neighborhood used to be the best in town. It is still far from being the worst neighborhood in town, but it is, as it has been for several years, deteriorating. The establishment of a Turkish bath on one corner and a grocery-store on the other has taken away much of that air of refinement which characterized it when the block was devoted to residential purposes entirely. Now just suppose for a moment that this street were a canal, and that this house were a canal-boat. The canal could run down as much as it pleased, the neighborhood could deteriorate eternally, but it could not affect the value of this house as the home of refined people as long as it was possible to hitch up a team of horses to the front stoop and tow it into a better locality. I'd like to wager every man at this table that Mrs. Pedagog wouldn't take five minutes to make up her mind to tow this house up to a spot near Central Park, if it were a canal-boat and the streets were water instead of a mixture of water, sand, and Belgian blocks.\"  \"No takers,\" said the Bibliomaniac.  \"Tutt-tutt-tutt,\" ejaculated Mr. Pedagog.  [Illustration: \"THE NUISANCE OF HAVING TO PAY\"]  \"You seem to lose sight of another fact,\" said the Idiot, warming up to his subject. \"If man had had the sense in the beginning to adopt the canal-boat system of life, and we were used to that sort of thing, it would not be so hard upon us in summer-time, when we have to live in hotels in order that we and our families may reap the benefits of a period of country life. We could simply drive off to that section of the country where we desired to be. Hotels would not be needed if a man could take his house along with him into the fields, and one phase of life which has more bad than good in it would be entirely obliterated. There is nothing more disturbing to the serenity of a domestic man's mind than the artificial manner of living that prevails in most summer hotels. The nuisance of having to pay bills every Monday morning under the penalty of losing one's luggage would be obviated, and all the comforts of home would be directly within reach. The trouble incident upon getting the trunks packed and the children ready for a long day's journey by rail, and the fatigue arising from such a journey, would be reduced to a minimum. The troubles attendant upon going into a far country, and leaving one's house in the sole charge of a lot of servants for a month or two every year, would be done away with entirely; and if at any time it became necessary to discharge one of these servants, she could be put off the boat in an instant, and then the boat could be pushed out into the middle of the canal, so that the discharged domestic could not possibly get aboard again and take her revenge by smashing your crockery and fixtures. That is one of the worst features of living in a stationary house. You are entirely at the mercy of vindictive servants. They know precisely where you live, and you cannot escape them. They can come back when there is no man around, and raise several varieties of Ned with your wife and children. With a movable house, such as the canal-boat would be, you could always go off and leave your family in perfect safety.\"  [Illustration: \"SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GET ABOARD AGAIN\"]  \"How about safety in a storm?\" asked the Bibliomaniac.  \"Safety in a storm?\" echoed the Idiot. \"That seems an absurd sort of a question to one who knows anything about canal-boats. I, for one, never heard of a canal-boat being seriously damaged in a storm as long as it was anchored in the canal proper. It certainly isn't any more dangerous to be in a canal-boat in a storm than it is to be in a house that offers resistance to the winds, and is shaken from roof to cellar at every blast. More houses have been blown from their foundations than canal-boats sunk, provided ordinary care has been taken to protect them.\"  \"And you think the canal-boat would be healthy?\" asked the Doctor. \"How about dampness and all that?\"  \"That is a professional question,\" returned the Idiot, \"which I think you could answer better than I. I don't see why a canal-boat shouldn't be healthy, however. The dampness would not amount to very much. It would be outside of one's dwelling, and not within it, as is the case with so many houses. A canal-boat having no cellar could not have a damp one, and if by some untoward circumstance it should spring a leak, the water could be pumped out at once and the leak plugged up. However this might be, I'll offer another wager to this board on that point, and that is that more people die in houses than on canal-boats.\"  \"We'd rather give you our money right out,\" retorted the Doctor.  \"Thank you,\" said the Idiot. \"But I don't need money. I don't like money. Money is responsible for more extravagance than any other commodity in existence. Besides, it and I are not intimate enough to get along very well together, and when I have any I immediately do my level best to rid myself of it. But to return to our canal-boat, I note a look of disapproval in Mr. Whitechoker's eyes. He doesn't seem to think any more of my scheme than do the rest of you--which I regret, since I believe that he would be the gainer if land edifices were supplanted by the canal system as proposed by myself. Take church on a rainy morning, for instance. A great many people stay at home from church on rainy mornings just because they do not want to venture out in the wet. Suppose we all lived "]]]
