For Christ his sake answer a poor old widow woman!”  “What is it, dame?” quoth Amyas, gently enough.  “Did you see my son to the Indies?--my son Salvation?”  “Salvation?” replied he, with the air of one who recollected the name.  “Yes, sure, Salvation Yeo, of Clovelly. A tall man and black, and sweareth awfully in his talk, the Lord forgive him!”  Amyas recollected now. It was the name of the sailor who had given him the wondrous horn five years ago.  “My good dame,” said he, “the Indies are a very large place, and your son may be safe and sound enough there, without my having seen him. I knew one Salvation Yeo. But he must have come with--By the by, godfather, has Mr. Oxenham come home?”  There was a dead silence for a moment among the gentlemen round; and then Sir Richard said solemnly, and in a low voice, turning away from the old dame,--  “Amyas, Mr. Oxenham has not come home; and from the day he sailed, no word has been heard of him and all his crew.”  “Oh, Sir Richard! and you kept me from sailing with him! Had I known this before I went into church, I had had one mercy more to thank God for.”  “Thank Him all the more in thy life, my child!” whispered his mother.  “And no news of him whatsoever?”  “None; but that the year after he sailed, a ship belonging to Andrew Barker, of Bristol, took out of a Spanish caravel, somewhere off the Honduras, his two brass guns; but whence they came the Spaniard knew not, having bought them at Nombre de Dios.”  “Yes!” cried the old woman; “they brought home the guns, and never brought home my boy!”  “They never saw your boy, mother,” said Sir Richard.  “But I've seen him! I saw him in a dream four years last Whitsuntide, as plain as I see you now, gentles, a-lying upon a rock, calling for a drop of water to cool his tongue, like Dives to the torment! Oh! dear me!”  and the old dame wept bitterly.  “There is a rose noble for you!” said Mrs. Leigh.  “And there another!” said Sir Richard. And in a few minutes four or five gold coins were in her hand. But the old dame did but look wonderingly at the gold a moment, and then--  “Ah! dear gentles, God's blessing on you, and Mr. Cary's mighty good to me already; but gold won't buy back childer! O! young gentleman! young gentleman! make me a promise; if you want God's blessing on you this day, bring me back my boy, if you find him sailing on the seas! Bring him back, and an old widow's blessing be on you!”  Amyas promised--what else could he do?--and the group hurried on; but the lad's heart was heavy in the midst of joy, with the thought of John Oxenham, as he walked through the churchyard, and down the short street which led between the ancient school and still more ancient town-house, to the head of the long bridge, across which the pageant, having arranged “east-the-water,” was to defile, and then turn to the right along the quay.  However, he was bound in all courtesy to turn his attention now to the show which had been prepared in his honor, and which was really well enough worth seeing and hearing. The English were, in those days, an altogether dramatic people; ready and able, as in Bideford that day, to extemporize a pageant, a masque, or any effort of the Thespian art short of the regular drama. For they were, in the first place, even down to the very poorest, a well-fed people, with fewer luxuries than we, but more abundant necessaries; and while beef, ale, and good woollen clothes could be obtained in plenty, without overworking either body or soul, men had time to amuse themselves in something more intellectual than mere toping in pot-houses. Moreover, the half century after the Reformation in England was one not merely of new intellectual freedom, but of immense animal good spirits. After years of dumb confusion and cruel persecution, a breathing time had come: Mary and the fires of Smithfield had vanished together like a hideous dream, and the mighty shout of joy which greeted Elizabeth's entry into London, was the key-note of fifty glorious years; the expression of a new-found strength and freedom, which vented itself at home in drama and in song; abroad in mighty conquests, achieved with the laughing recklessness of boys at play.  So first, preceded by the waits, came along the bridge toward the town-hall a device prepared by the good rector, who, standing by, acted as showman, and explained anxiously to the bystanders the import of a certain “allegory” wherein on a great banner was depicted Queen Elizabeth herself, who, in ample ruff and farthingale, a Bible in one hand and a sword in the other, stood triumphant upon the necks of two sufficiently abject personages, whose triple tiara and imperial crown proclaimed them the Pope and the King of Spain; while a label, issuing from her royal mouth, informed the world that--       “By land and sea a virgin queen I reign,      And spurn to dust both Antichrist and Spain.”  Which, having been received with due applause, a well-bedizened lad, having in his cap as a posy “Loyalty,” stepped forward, and delivered himself of the following verses:--       “Oh, great Eliza! oh, world-famous crew!      Which shall I hail more blest, your queen or you?      While without other either falls to wrack,      And light must eyes, or eyes their light must lack.      She without you, a diamond sunk in mine,      Its worth unprized, to self alone must shine;      You without her, like hands bereft of head,      Like Ajax rage, by blindfold lust misled.      She light, you eyes; she head, and you the hands,      In fair proportion knit by heavenly hands;      Servants in queen, and queen in servants blest;      Your only glory, how to serve her best;      And hers how best the adventurous might to guide,      Which knows no check of foemen, wind, or tide,      So fair Eliza's spotless fame may fly      Triumphant round the globe, and shake th' astounded sky!”  With which sufficiently bad verses Loyalty passed on, while my Lady Bath hinted to Sir Richard, not without reason, that the poet, in trying to exalt both parties, had very sufficiently snubbed both, and intimated that it was “hardly safe for country wits to attempt that euphuistic, antithetical, and delicately conceited vein, whose proper fountain was in Whitehall.” However, on went Loyalty, very well pleased with himself, and next, amid much cheering, two great tinsel fish, a salmon and a trout, symbolical of the wealth of Torridge, waddled along, by means of two human legs and a staff apiece, which protruded from the fishes' stomachs. They drew (or seemed to draw, for half the 'prentices in the town were shoving it behind, and cheering on the panting monarchs of the flood) a car wherein sate, amid reeds and river-flags, three or four pretty girls in robes of gray-blue spangled with gold, their heads wreathed one with a crown of the sweet bog-myrtle, another with hops and white convolvulus, the third with pale heather and golden fern. They stopped opposite Amyas; and she of the myrtle wreath, rising and bowing to him and the company, began with a pretty blush to say her say:--       “Hither from my moorland home,      Nymph of Torridge, proud I come;      Leaving fen and furzy brake,      Haunt of eft and spotted snake,      Where to fill mine urns I use,      Daily with Atlantic dews;      While beside the reedy flood      Wild duck leads her paddling brood.      For this morn, as Phoebus gay      Chased through heaven the night mist gray,      Close beside me, prankt in pride,      Sister Tamar rose, and cried,      'Sluggard, up! 'Tis holiday,      In the lowlands far away.      Hark! how jocund Plymouth bells,      Wandering up through mazy dells,      Call me down, with smiles to hail,      My daring Drake's returning sail.'      'Thine alone?' I answer'd.  'Nay;      Mine as well the joy to-day.      Heroes train'd on Northern wave,      To that Argo new I gave;      Lent to thee, they roam'd the main;      Give me, nymph, my sons again.'      'Go, they wait Thee,' Tamar cried,      Southward bounding from my side.      Glad I rose, and at my call,      Came my Naiads, one and all.      Nursling of the mountain sky,      Leaving Dian's choir on high,      Down her cataracts laughing loud,      Ockment leapt from crag and cloud,      Leading many a nymph, who dwells      Where wild deer drink in ferny dells;      While the Oreads as they past      Peep'd from Druid Tors aghast.      By alder copses sliding slow,      Knee-deep in flowers came gentler Yeo      And paused awhile her locks to twine      With musky hops and white woodbine,      Then joined the silver-footed band,      Which circled down my golden sand,      By dappled park, and harbor shady,      Haunt of love-lorn knight and lady,      My thrice-renowned sons to greet,      With rustic song and pageant meet.      For joy! the girdled robe around      Eliza's name henceforth shall sound,      Whose venturous fleets to conquest start,      Where ended once the seaman's chart,      While circling Sol his steps shall count      Henceforth from Thule's western mount,      And lead new rulers round the seas      From furthest Cassiterides.      For found is now the golden tree,      Solv'd th' Atlantic mystery,      Pluck'd the dragon-guarded fruit;      While around the charmed root,      Wailing loud, the Hesperids      Watch their warder's drooping lids.      Low he lies with grisly wound,      While the sorceress triple-crown'd      In her scarlet robe doth shield him,      Till her cunning spells have heal'd him.      Ye, meanwhile, around the earth      Bear the prize of manful worth.      Yet a nobler meed than gold      Waits for Albion's children bold;      Great Eliza's virgin hand      Welcomes you to Fairy-land,      While your native Naiads bring      Native wreaths as offering.      Simple though their show may be,      Britain's worship in them see.

His fifth birthday was not celebrated by the usual horde of noisy, hungry kids running wild in the afternoon. It started at seven, with cocktails. They were served by his host, Paul Brennan, to the celebrants, the boy's father and mother. The guest of honor sipped ginger ale and nibbled at canapés while he was presented with his gifts: A volume of Kipling's _Jungle Tales_, a Spitz Junior Planetarium, and a build-it-yourself kit containing parts for a geiger counter and an assortment of radioactive minerals to identify. Dinner was served at eight, the menu selected by Jimmy Holden--with the exception of the birthday cake and its five proud little candles which came as an anticipated surprise from his \"Uncle\" Paul Brennan.  After dinner, they listened to some music chosen by the boy, and the evening wound up with three rubbers of bridge. The boy won.  They left Paul Brennan's apartment just after eleven o'clock. Jimmy Holden was tired and pleasantly stuffed with good food. But he was stimulated by the party. So, instead of dropping off to sleep, he sat comfortably wedged between his father and mother, quietly lost in his own thoughts until the car was well out of town.  Then he said, \"Dad, why did you make that sacrifice bid on the last hand?\" Father and son had been partners.  \"You're not concerned about losing the rubber, are you?\" It had been the only rubber Jimmy lost.  \"No. It's only a game,\" said Jimmy. \"I'm just trying to understand.\"  His father gave an amused groan. \"It has to do with the laws of probability and the theory of games,\" he said.  The boy shook his head. \"Bridge,\" he said thoughtfully, \"consists of creating a logical process of play out of a random distribution of values, doesn't it?\"  \"Yes, if you admit that your definition is a gross oversimplification. It would hardly be a game if everything could be calculated beforehand.\"  \"But what's missing?\"  \"In any game there is the element of a calculated risk.\"  Jimmy Holden was silent for a half-mile thinking that one over. \"How,\" he asked slowly, \"can a risk be calculated?\"  His father laughed. \"In fine, it can't. Too much depends upon the personality of the individual.\"  \"Seems to me,\" said Jimmy, \"that there's not much point in making a bid against a distribution of values known to be superior. You couldn't hope to make it; Mother and Uncle Paul had the cards.\"  His father laughed again. \"After a few more courses in higher mathematics, James, you'll begin to realize that some of the highest mathematics is aimed at predicting the unpredictable, or trying to lower the entropy of random behavior--\"  Jimmy Holden's mother chuckled. \"Now explain entropy,\" she said. \"James, what your father has been failing to explain is really not subject to simple analysis. Who knows why any man will hazard his hard-earned money on the orientation of a pair of dice? No amount of education nor academic study will explain what drives a man. Deep inside, I suppose it is the same force that drives everybody. One man with four spades will take a chance to see if he can make five, and another man with directorships in three corporations will strive to make it four.\"  Jimmy's father chuckled. \"Some families with one infant will try to make it two--\"  \"Not on your life!\"  \"--And some others are satisfied with what they've got,\" finished Jimmy Holden's father. \"James, some men will avoid seeing what has to be done; some men will see it and do it and do no more; and a few men will see what has to be done, do it, and then look to the next inevitable problem created by their own act--\"  A blinding flash of light cut a swath across the road, dazzling them. Around the curve ahead, a car careened wide over the white line. His mother reached for him, his father fought the wheel to avoid the crash. Jimmy Holden both heard and felt the sharp _Bang!_ as the right front tire went. The steering wheel snapped through his father's hands by half a turn. There was a splintering crash as the car shattered its way through the retaining fence, then came a fleeting moment of breathless silence as if the entire universe had stopped still for a heartbeat.  Chaos! His mother's automatic scream, his father's oath, and the rending crash split the silence at once. The car bucked and flipped, the doors were slammed open and ripped off against a tree that went down. The car leaped in a skew turn and began to roll and roll, shedding metal and humans as it racketed down the ravine.  Jimmy felt himself thrown free in a tumbleturn that ended in a heavy thud.         *       *       *       *       *  When breath and awareness returned, he was lying in a depression filled with soft rotting leaves.  He was dazed beyond hurt. The initial shock and bewilderment oozed out of him, leaving him with a feeling of outrage, and a most peculiar sensation of being a spectator rather than an important part of the violent drama. It held an air of unreality, like a dream that the near-conscious sleeper recognizes as a dream and lives through it because he lacks the conscious will to direct it.  Strangely, it was as if there were three or more of him all thinking different things at the same time. He wanted his mother badly enough to cry. Another part of him said that she would certainly be at his side if she were able. Then a third section of his confused mind pointed out that if she did not come to him, it was because she herself was hurt deeply and couldn't.  A more coldly logical portion of his mind was urging him to get up and _do_ something about it. They had passed a telephone booth on the highway; lying there whimpering wasn't doing anybody any good. This logical part of his confused mind did not supply the dime for the telephone slot nor the means of scaling the heights needed to insert the dime in the adult-altitude machine.  Whether the dazzle of mental activity was serial or simultaneous isn't important. The fact is that it was completely disorganized as to plan or program, it leaped from one subject to another until he heard the scrabble and scratch of someone climbing down the side of the ravine.  Any noise meant help. With relief, Jimmy tried to call out.  But with this arrival of help, afterfright claimed him. His mouth worked silently before a dead-dry throat and his muscles twitched in uncontrolled nervousness; he made neither sound nor motion. Again he watched with the unreal feeling of being a remote spectator. A cone of light from a flashlight darted about and it gradually seeped into Jimmy's shocked senses that this was a new arrival, picking his way through the tangle of brush, following the trail of ruin from the broken guard rail to the smashed car below.  The newcomer paused. The light darted forward to fall upon a crumpled mass of cloth.  With a toe, the stranger probed at crushed ribs. A pitifully feeble moan came from the broken rag doll that lay on the ground. The searcher knelt with his light close to peer into the bloody face, and, unbelieving, Jimmy Holden heard the voice of his mother straining to speak, \"Paul--I--we--\"  The voice died in a gurgle.  The man with the flashlight tested the flaccid neck by bending the head to one side and back sharply. He ended this inspection by letting the head fall back to the moist earth. It landed with a thud of finality.  The cold brutality of this stranger's treatment of his mother shocked Jimmy Holden into frantic outrage. The frozen cry for help changed into protesting anger; no one should be treated that--  \"One!\" muttered the stranger flatly.  Jimmy's burst of protest died in his throat and he watched, fascinated, as the stranger's light moved in a sweep forward to stop a second time. \"And there's number two!\" The callous horror was repeated. Hypnotically, Jimmy Holden watched the stranger test the temples and wrists and try a hand under his father's heart. He watched the stranger make a detailed inspection of the long slash that laid open the entire left abdomen and he saw the red that seeped but did not flow.  \"That's that!\" said the stranger with an air of finality. \"Now--\" and he stood up to swing his flashlight in widening circles, searching the area carefully.         *       *       *       *       *  Jimmy Holden did not sicken. He went cold. He froze as the dancing flashlight passed over his head, and relaxed partially when it moved away in a series of little jumps pausing to give a steady light for close inspection. The light swung around and centered on the smashed automobile. It was upside down, a ruin with one wheel still turning idly.  The stranger went to it, and knelt to peer inside. He pried ripped metal away to get a clear sight into the crushed interior. He went flat on his stomach and tried to penetrate the area between the crumpled car-top and the bruised ground, and he wormed his way in a circle all around the car, examining the wreck minutely.  The sound of a distant automobile engine became audible, and the searching man mumbled a curse. With haste he scrambled to his feet and made a quick inspection of the one wabbly-turning wheel. He stripped a few shards of rubber away, picked at something in the bent metal rim, and put whatever he found in his pocket. When his hand came from the pocket it held a packet of paper matches. With an ear cocked at the road above and the sound of the approaching car growing louder, the stranger struck one match and touched it to the deck of matches. Then with a callous gesture he"]]]
