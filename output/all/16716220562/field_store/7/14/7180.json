[Illustration]  It is not a native of this country, but is supposed to have been brought to England by soldiers from the Crimea, and later it found its way to America.  We call it the croton bug, but it is not a bug at all, it is a cockroach.  It is particularly numerous about water pipes, and, like the rest of the cockroaches, it hides in the daytime.  At night out troop crowds and crowds of the little tan-colored water bugs. They run about the floor, and over the pantry shelves. They get into everything they can find, and have a beautiful time.  They are funny little fellows, and if they were not so troublesome, we might admire them.  How they can run!  All the cockroaches run very fast, so that it is hard to catch one. And they are hard and smooth, too, which makes it yet more difficult to catch them. They are well made to escape their enemies, and they are so flat they can hide in cracks or almost anywhere.  No, May, they do not fly very much. You see this one has short wings. It is a male cockroach. The female of this species of cockroach has no wings at all, only little hints of wings, as it were.  Such little useless wings we call \"rudimentary\" wings.  John says he thinks that is a long word for short wings.  Yes, but it is not a hard word,--ru-di-ment-ary, see if you can remember it.  The croton bugs have longer wings and they sometimes fly.  If you were to spread out the wings of a cockroach, you would find it had four.  What is that, May? You wouldn't spread them out for anything?  Yet wise men have been very much interested in our poor, ill-smelling old cockroaches, and have studied carefully all about them.  [Illustration]  If you dislike to touch the cockroach so much, perhaps you will look at this picture of a croton bug.  See, the upper wings are different; the cockroach does not fly with them, he merely uses them to cover up the under wings, and we call them wing covers.  It is the under wings the cockroach flies with.  Cockroaches may not be pleasant, but who can say they are not interesting?  What other insect lays its eggs in little bandboxes?  Here is one of the little boxes, shiny and hard.  [Illustration]  This little case is at first a sticky substance that soon hardens. The eggs lie in it side by side in two rows.  These cases remain attached to the abdomen of the female cockroach until the eggs are all laid. Then the case falls off, and soon out runs a crowd of infant cockroaches.  [Illustration]  The case is something like a satchel that shuts with a spring. The youngsters are packed close together, side by side, with their heads towards the mouth of the satchel.  As soon as one hatches it pushes open the side of the case and creeps out. Then the case springs together again to protect the rest of the brood.  They are funny fellows when they first come out, little and white-looking. But they eat and grow of course, and shed their skins, and after each moult they become darker in color.  Now, do look again at this cockroach I have taken such pains to catch for you and put into the tumbler.  I think even May will own that it has a cunning little head.  See it turn its head around to look at us.  After all, the cockroach is a knowing little fellow.  This one is hungry; it has had nothing to eat for some time. We will give it this crumb of cake.  Be careful, or it will get away; it can run very fast, and it is very quick, you see, in all its motions.  Ah, it is examining the crumb with the tips of its long antennæ.  See how daintily it touches the crumb.  It can smell with its antennæ, you know.  Now it has decided the cake is good to eat.  See how eager it is!  [Illustration]  It almost stands on its head to reach just the part it wants.  John says he does not understand how insects smell with their antennæ.  I can tell you a little about it, John.  If you look at one of the cockroach's antennæ under the magnifying glass, you will see it is made up of a good many short pieces, or segments, as we call them, fastened together end to end.  Yes, Mollie, that is why it can move about so easily. It can curl up like a whiplash, you see.  Next the head is a round segment that fits into a socket.  [Illustration]  Double up your right fist and fit it into the half-closed palm of your left hand.  There! That is like the ball-and-socket joint.  You see you can move your fist around in all directions.  The insect can move its antennæ in all directions because they are fastened to its head by ball-and-socket joints.  On the segments of the antennæ, particularly towards the tip, are little dots.  You cannot see the dots without the help of a strong microscope, but they are there.  These little dots are sensitive spots. There is a nerve coming from the insect's brain to each dot.  Some of the dots are sensitive to odors, just as the nerves of our nose are sensitive to odors.  May thinks it is very funny that the insects smell with antennæ instead of with noses.  The insects, no doubt, would think it very funny for us to smell with, noses instead of with antennæ, if they thought about it at all.  The little dots on the antennæ are extremely sensitive to smells. They are often much more sensitive than our noses.  Put a bit of food at some distance from a hungry cockroach, and it will not be long before a pair of long, sensitive feelers will come waving to and fro out of some dark corner.  [Illustration]  Little Mrs. Cockroach has smelled the dainty morsel, and, as soon as it is dark, out she will run, her feelers moving eagerly this way and that, until she has found it.  Yes, May, insects also feel with their antennæ. That is why the antennæ are often called \"feelers.\"  There are other dots on the segments that are sensitive to touch. Sometimes there are tiny hairs on the antennæ, also sensitive to touch.  The little fellows feel and smell, yes, and oftentimes _hear_ with their antennæ.  Many insects have spots sensitive to sound on the antennæ.  Yes, indeed, May, it is wonderful that such tiny threads as an insect's antennæ should hold so many kinds of sensitive spots.  An insect's antennæ are among the most wonderful things in the world.  And _I_ think a cockroach, in spite of its bad reputation, is a very wonderful little fellow.  What is that, May? Our cockroach is drawing one of its antennæ through its mouth?  Ah, yes, see it clean its antenna, children.  It seems to nibble at it as it draws it through its mouth.  Insects are very careful to keep their antennæ clean.  It would not do to let these sensitive spots become covered with dust, you know.  [Illustration]     NEIGHBOR WALKING STICK   Isn't this a pretty place to sit down and--  \"Ouch! ow! ow! ow!\"  Why, May, what is the matter?  Anybody would think you had seen a cockroach.  What has she found, John?  [Illustration]  Oh, it is a walking stick!  Why do I call it that?  Look and see.  Does it not look like a stick?  And does it not walk?  Then why is not walking stick a good name for it?  May thinks its legs look like a collection of pine needles, for they are green and flat on the upper joints.  It is as pretty as it is queer, with its brown body and its green legs.  This is the male walking stick; the female has brown legs. She is brown all over, just the color of dried leaves, and she is not as slender as her mate.  Mollie thinks it is the long and slender thorax that makes the walking stick look so queer.  See its thorax. Its six legs are attached to its thorax, which is as long and as slender as the abdomen.  John thinks it looks queer because everything about it is so long and slender.  [Illustration]  Long antennæ, long legs, long thorax, long abdomen--that is Mr. Walking Stick.  Sir, why do you have such long antennæ? Can you hear and feel and smell extra well because of them?  I wish you could tell us about them.  Now where is it?  Oh, yes, it is standing on that brown twig. It is so nearly the color of the twig and so much the shape of a little stick itself, that it is not easy to find it.  There, it is walking off again.  [Illustration]  It has a good name, for I am sure that if a stick tried to walk, it could not do it more awkwardly.  See now, what it is doing, hanging by one foot from that twig.  How still it is.  Who would imagine, seeing it thus for the first time, that it was a living creature?  The walking sticks feed on leaves, and I suppose their queer shape and their color protect them from being eaten by birds.  A bird would have to be very close to a walking stick to tell it from a twig.  The female drops the eggs on the ground, and leaves them to hatch out and make their way in the world as best they can.  [Illustration]  The young walking sticks look just like their parents, only of course they are very small, and they are green in color, like the leaves they eat.  Yes, little Nell, I should like to find some too; they must be cunning little things.  They eat and grow and moult, and eat and grow and moult, until they are grown up.  There are a good many species of walking sticks in the world, particularly in hot countries; and to their family belong the longest of known insects, some being nearly a foot long. Just imagine a walking stick a foot long!  And some of them are quite prettily colored, though certain species are not pleasant to handle, as they give forth a bad-smelling milky fluid when disturbed.  They are gentle little folk, all of them, and move slowly about over the leaves and twigs, not wishing to harm any living thing.  Some members of the walking stick family have wings, and these are even more curious than those that have none.  Their wings and legs are flattened to look like leaves, so that it is very difficult to find them among the foliage.  [Illustration]  Yes, May, they are also the color of the leaves they live among.  Here is a picture of one that will give some idea of these strange little people.  We have none of these leaf-like insects in our country, but we do"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18790"],["title","The Insect Folk (#5)"],["body","a near relative to the walking sticks, though it does not feed on leaves, I assure you.  How many of you are acquainted with his lordship, the praying mantis?  [Illustration]  Charlie says he has seen these fellows in Kansas, and Nellie says she has a cousin in the South who has told her about them.  Here is a picture of one; is it not a beauty!  Its wings are green and its body is brown, so that it can stealthily creep about among the foliage without being noticed.  When at rest it holds its front legs up as though it were raising its arms in an attitude of devotion.  But not a thought of devotion lies in that cruel little head. There is only one idea there; and if any unwary insect were to come along, those devotional arms would be thrust out with incredible rapidity, and the unfortunate insect clasped tightly in them.  Then the mantis, hugging its prey in the strong trap-like clasp of its spiked legs, would coolly proceed to devour it alive, eating it as a boy would eat an apple.  [Illustration]  This praying mantis is called a \"mule-killer\" in the South, where the people think the brown liquor it spits out of its mouth, when disturbed, is fatal to mules.  The mantis is also called a devil-horse, a rear-horse, a camel-cricket, and many other names inspired by its outlandish appearance.  Some have even thought it looked wise, standing in that knowing attitude with extended arms, and so it has been called prophet and soothsayer, as though it could foretell what is going to happen.  Undoubtedly it never foretells anything but the approaching death of some insect and possibly a coming change in the weather, for insects often know when the weather is going to change long before we do.  Although our mantes are brown or green, there are a great many species living in hot countries that are much more brightly attired; and when you find yourself on a visit to the tropics, you must look for the flower mantis.  It mimics in color the brilliant hues of the showy orchids in which it hides.  It does not seem to wear its gorgeous robes from a love for the beautiful, however, but rather that it may the better lie concealed in the heart of the gay flowers, to pounce upon unsuspecting insects that come there for refreshing draughts of honey.  [Illustration]  In some parts of Africa the mantis is worshipped by the natives, and in France these fellows are believed to point out the way to travellers by stretching out one leg when questioned.  Its strange attitude, with uplifted arms, has won the mantis regard in all parts of the world, though the insects it clasps in these uplifted arms would not be likely to share the good opinion held of this hardy cannibal.  For it is a cannibal, and enjoys eating another mantis as much as anything else.  The mantes are terrible fighters, too, and if there is a meeting between two of them, there is very apt to be a battle in which one is vanquished and devoured by the other.  Our mantis lays its eggs, thirty or forty in number, on tree twigs, and they are embedded in a soft substance that soon becomes very tough and horny. These strange egg-cases of the mantis are easily recognized because they look as though they were braided on top, as you can see in the picture.  [Illustration]  Yes, May, the tough covering is to protect the eggs from wet and from prying birds and hungry insects.  The young mantes are similar to their parents, only they have no wings. But they hold up their spiny front legs and catch insects, and they grow and moult in the usual way.  While we have been talking about leaf-like insects and mule-killers our walking stick has gone off.  [Illustration]  Well, well, let him go, and good luck go with him.  I am glad you like the walking stick, children.  And now, May, let me tell you something.  This queer fellow is a very near relative of your friend, the cockroach.  [Illustration]     THE GRASSHOPPER TRIBES   Don't you often wonder where they come from? The swarms of grasshoppers in the late summer?  Charlie says he walked across a field last night where he believes there were as many grasshoppers as there were blades of grass.  Just think of it! and yet they do not seem to do any harm.  In some places, however, they do a great deal of harm.  They come flying in swarms that darken the sun, and they settle on the trees and the crops and eat up every green thing. There is nothing a Western farmer dreads so much as the passing of the grasshoppers.  Grasshoppers are funny little fellows, and we like them--when there are not too many of them.  Summer would not seem quite like summer unless we heard the grasshoppers shrilling.  There are a great many species of them, and we have placed them in two divisions,--The Shorthorned Grasshoppers and The Longhorned Grasshoppers.  [Illustration]     THE SHORTHORNED GRASSHOPPERS   They have no horns, of course, but some have short antennæ that stick out like little horns, and those we call shorthorned.  The right name for the shorthorned grasshoppers is locusts.  We call another insect a locust, but the shorthorned grasshoppers are the true locusts.  Some say it was these locusts that John the Baptist ate with his honey in the wilderness.  [Illustration]  A good many people in different parts of the world still eat locusts.  They are said to be good food when roasted, but I would rather eat roasted peanuts.  Come here, little locust, and let us look at you.  Now, stand still, and show us your short \"horns.\"  See its eyes!  Yes, May, they are compound eyes, but I do not know how many facets they have.  What a funny little rabbit face it has.  See it move its little mouth parts.  It bites bits out of the leaves and chews them up very fast.  Has it teeth? May is asking.  Well, yes, but not like our teeth. Sometime you must see the mouth parts of the grasshopper under the microscope. They are very interesting.  Mollie says the locust has a cape on.  John says the cape is the top of its thorax.  [Illustration]  Frank has been counting its legs; he says it has six.  See it walk. It uses all six legs to walk with.  But it does something besides walk with its hind legs.  Yes, it jumps with them. How long and large they are! Now watch it jump.  See! It draws those long hind legs close up to its body, then suddenly straightens them out--and away it goes as though it had been shot from a spring board.  John says its hind legs work just like a spring, and so they do. It can leap several times the length of its body. Amy thinks it should be called a grass-jumper instead of a grasshopper.  Suppose we all look carefully at the locust's long hind leg, segment by segment.  What, John? You do not know what a segment is?  Well, a segment is the part between two joints. The joints are where the leg bends, you know.  May proposes that we draw a picture of the long hind leg.  It will be fun to try.  There are two tiny segments close to the body.  If you are not careful, you will find only one.  You must look sharp to see both of them.  How well Charlie has drawn his! He has both the little segments.  [Illustration]  The one next the body we will mark I, and we will call it the coxa.  The next little one we will mark II, and that we will call the trochanter.  The long, strong one, III, we will call the femur.  The next one, long and narrow, we will mark IV, and call the tibia.  All the rest of the leg, made of several short segments, we will call the tarsus, and we will mark it V.  Now how are we to remember all those hard names?  Here is a jingle that perhaps will help us:--    _Coxa_ first, and then _trochanter_,   Number three the _femur_ stands,   After this, the long, straight _tibia_,   And last of all the _tarsus_ comes.  Now let us see who can learn it first.  Charlie says we are taking a good deal of trouble over the hind legs of a grasshopper.  [Illustration]  Very true, Mr. Philosopher, but let me tell you something.  When we have learned the names of the segments in the grasshopper's hind leg, we have learned the names of the segments in the legs of all insects.  You see all the legs are made on one common plan, and it is very convenient, as you will soon see, to have the parts named.  What a fine set of drawings of the grasshopper's hind leg we have!  Why do you suppose the coxa and trochanter are so small?  Yes, John, it is in order that the leg can move easily.  The grasshopper can turn its leg in almost any direction because of these small upper segments.  It can put its leg up over its head if it wants to. Next to the little coxa and trochanter is the longest and largest segment in the grasshopper's leg; I suppose nobody remembers its name.  Listen to little Nell,--\"number three the _femur_ stands.\"  So it does, and what a very useful femur it is!  If it were not for the long femur and the long, slender tibia, the grasshopper would not be a grasshopper--it could not hop at all.  Watch the grasshopper, and see how he uses those long segments to jump with.  [Illustration]  First he draws the tibia close up to the femur--now he is off!  He just straightened those long hind legs out with a jerk, and away he went!  [Illustration]  What do you suppose the two little sharp spines at the end of the tibia are for?  What, May? You did not see any spines?  [Illustration]  Look again.  See, Charlie has drawn them very plainly in his picture of the grasshopper's leg. Mark them _s_, Charlie.  Now we must all look at Charlie's picture.  He says he thinks he knows what the spines are for--they are to keep the grasshopper from slipping when he makes his leap forward.  I have no doubt Charlie is right.  May wants us to look at the beautiful little hinge x where the femur and the tibia are fastened together.  [Illustration]  Let us mark it _X_.  See the little ball on the end of the tibia. How well it fits into the hollow on the end of the femur.  In order to see this hollow or groove, you must look on the under side of the leg.  Yes, John, it reminds us of the"]]]
