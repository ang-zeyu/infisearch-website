I am not of English blood, but when things look worst iss the time when England shows best, and the people here are of the same breed. I do not despair. What did you say had become of Willet?\"  \"Shortly before we reached Albany he turned aside to see Sir William Johnson. We had, too, with us, a young Englishman named Grosvenor, a fine fellow, but he went at once to the English camp here to report for duty. He was in the battle at Ticonderoga and he also will testify that our army, although beaten, could have brought up its artillery and have fought again in a day or two. It would have gained the victory, too.\"  \"I suppose so! I suppose so! But it did not fight again, and what might have been did not happen. It means a longer war in this country and a longer war all over the world. It spreads! It iss a great war, extending to most of the civilized lands, the greatest war of modern times and many think it will be the last war, but I know not. The character of mankind does not change. What do you two boys mean to do?\"  \"We have not decided yet,\" replied Robert, speaking for both. \"We'll go back to the war, of course, which means that we'll travel once more toward the north, but we'll have to rest a few days.\"  \"And this house iss for you to rest in--a few days or many days, as you please, though I hope it will be many. Caterina shall cook for you four, five meals a day, if you wish, and much at every meal. I do not forget how when you were little you raided the fruit trees, and the berry bushes and the vines. Well, the fruit will soon be ripe again und I will turn my back the other way. I will make that fat Caterina do the same, and you and Tayoga can imagine that you are little boys once more.\"  \"I know you mean that, Mynheer Jacobus, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts,\" said Robert, as the moisture came into his eyes.  \"Here comes Master Alexander McLean,\" said Mr. Huysman, who had turned back to the window. \"He must have heard of your arrival and he wishes to see if your perils in the woods have made you forget your ancient history.\"  In a minute or two Master McLean, tall, thin, reddish of hair, and severe of gaze entered, his frosty blue eyes lighting up as he shook hands with the boys, though his manner remained austere.  \"I heard that you had arrived after the great defeat at Ticonderoga,\" he said, \"and you are fortunate to have escaped with your lives. I rejoice at it, but those who go into the woods in such times must expect great perils. It is of course well for all our young men to offer their lives now for their country, but I thought I saw in you at least, Robert Lennox, the germ of a great scholar, and it would be a pity for you to lose your life in some forest skirmish.\"  \"I thank you for the compliment,\" said Robert, \"but as I was telling Mynheer Jacobus I mean to go back into the woods.\"  \"I doubt it not. The young of this generation are wise in their own conceit. It was hard enough to control Tayoga and you several years ago, and I cannot expect to do it now. Doubtless all the knowledge that I have been at such pains to instill into you will be lost in the excitement of trail and camp.\"  \"I hope not, sir, though it's true that we've had some very stirring times. When one is in imminent danger of his life he cannot think much of his Latin, his Greek and his ancient history.\"  The severe features of Master Alexander McLean wrinkled into a frown.  \"I do not know about that,\" he said. \"Alexander the Great slept with his Homer under his pillow, and doubtless he also carried the book with him on his Asiatic campaigns, refreshing and strengthening his mind from time to time with dips into its inspiring pages. There is no crisis in which it is pardonable for you to forget your learning, though I fear me much that you have done so. What was the date, Robert, of the fall of Constantinople?\"  \"Mahomet the Second entered it, sir, in the year 1453 A. D.\"  \"Very good. I begin to have more confidence in you. And why is Homer considered a much greater poet than Virgil?\"  \"More masculine, more powerful, sir, and far more original. In fact the Romans in their literature, as in nearly all other arts, were merely imitators of the Greeks.\"  The face of Master McLean relaxed into a smile.  \"Excellent! Excellent!\" he exclaimed. \"You have done better than you claimed for yourself, but modesty is an attribute that becomes the young, and now I tell you again, Robert, that I am most glad you and Tayoga have come safely out of the forest. I wish to inform you also that Master Benjamin Hardy and his chief clerk, Jonathan Pillsbury, have arrived from New York on the fast packet, _River Queen_, and even now they are depositing their baggage at the George Inn, where they are expecting to stay.\"  Master Jacobus who had been silent while the schoolmaster talked, awoke suddenly to life.  \"At the George Inn!\" he exclaimed. \"It iss a good inn, good enough for anybody, but when friends of mine come to Albany they stay with me or I take offense. Bide here, my friends, and I will go for them. Alexander, sit with the lads and partake of refreshment while I am gone.\"  He hastened from the room and Master McLean, upon being urged, joined Robert and Tayoga at the table, where he showed that he too was a good man at the board, thinness being no bar to appetite and capacity. As he ate he asked the boys many questions, and they, knowing well his kindly heart under his crusty manner, answered them all readily and freely. Elderly and bookish though he was, his heart throbbed at the tale of the great perils through which they had gone, and his face darkened when Robert told anew the story of Ticonderoga.  \"It is our greatest defeat so far,\" he said, \"and I hope our misfortunes came to a climax there. We must have repayment for it. We must aim at the heart of the French power, and that is Quebec. Instead of fighting on the defense, Britain and her colonies must strike down Canada.\"  \"So it seems to me too, sir,\" said Robert. \"We're permitting the Marquis de Montcalm to make the fighting, to choose the fields of battle, and as long as we do that we have to dance to his music. But, sir, that's only my opinion. I would not presume to give it in the presence of my superiors.\"  \"You've had much experience despite your youth and you're entitled to your thoughts. But I hear heavy steps. 'Tis odds that it's Jacobus with his friends.\"  The door was opened and Mr. Huysman with many words of welcome ushered in his guests, who being simple and strong men brought their own baggage from the inn. Robert rose at once and faced Benjamin Hardy in whose eyes shone an undoubted gladness. The merchant did not look a day older than when Robert had last seen him in New York, and he was as robust and hearty as ever. Jonathan Pillsbury, tall, thin and dressed with meticulous care, also permitted himself a smile.  \"Robert, my lad!\" exclaimed Benjamin Hardy, dropping his baggage and holding out two sinewy hands. \"'Tis a delight to find you and Tayoga here. I knew not what had become of you two, and I feared the worst, the times being so perilous. Upon my word, we've quite a reunion!\"  Robert returned his powerful and friendly grasp. He was more than glad to see him for several reasons; for his own sake, because he liked him exceedingly, and because he was sure Master Benjamin held in his keeping those secrets of his own life which he was yet to learn.  \"Sir,\" he said, \"'tis not my house, though I've lived in it, and I know that Mr. Huysman has already given you a most thorough welcome, so I add that it's a delight to me to see you again. 'Twas a pleasant and most memorable visit that Tayoga and I had at your home in New York.\"  \"And eventful enough, too. You came very near going to the Guineas on a slave trip. That was the kind of hospitality I offered you.\"  \"No fault of yours, sir. I shall never forget the welcome you gave us in New York. It warms my heart now to think of it.\"  \"I see you've not lost your gift of speech. Words continue to well from your lips, and they're good words, too. But I talk overmuch myself. Here is Jonathan waiting to speak to you. I told him I was coming to Albany. 'Upon what affair?' he asked. ''Tis secret,' I replied. 'Meaning you do not want to tell me of its nature,' he said. 'Yes,' I replied. Then he said, 'Whatever its gist, you'll need my presence and advice. I'm going with you.' And here he is. Doubtless he is right.\"  Jonathan Pillsbury clasped Robert's hand as warmly as he ever clasped anybody's and permitted himself a second smile, which was his limit, and only extraordinary occasions could elicit two.  \"Our conversation has been repeated with accuracy,\" he said. \"I do not yet know why I have come to Albany, but I feel sure it is well that I have come.\"  Mr. Huysman hustled about, his great red face glowing while fat Caterina brought in more to eat. He insisted that the new guests sit at the table and eat tremendously. It was a time when hospitality meant repeated offerings of food, which in America was the most abundant of all things, and Mr. Hardy and Mr. Pillsbury easily allowed themselves to be persuaded.  \"And now, Robert, you must tell me something more about Dave,\" said the merchant as they rose from the table.  Young Lennox promptly narrated their adventures among the peaks and about the lakes while the older men listened with breathless attention. Nor did the story of the great hunter suffer in Robert's telling. He had an immense admiration for Willet and he spoke of his deeds with such vivid words and with so much imagery and embroidery that they seemed to be enacted again there in that quiet room before the men who listened.  \"Ah, that is Dave! True as steel. As honest and brave as they ever make 'em,\" said Master Benjamin Hardy, when he had finished. \"A man! a real man if ever one"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18774"],["title","The Sun of Quebec: A Story of a Great Crisis (#2)"],["body","this earth!\"  \"And don't forget Tayoga here,\" said Robert. \"The greatest trailer ever born. He saved us more than once by his ability to read the faintest sign the earth might yield.\"  \"When Dagaeoga begins to talk he never knows how to stop,\" said Tayoga; \"I but did the things all the warriors of my nation are taught to do. I would be unworthy to call myself a member of the clan of the Bear, of the nation Onondaga, of the great League of the Hodenosaunee, if I could not follow a trail. Peace, Dagaeoga!\"  Robert joined in the laugh, and then the men began to talk about the prospects of an attack upon Albany by the French and Indians, though all of them inclined to Robert's view that Montcalm would not try it.  \"As you were a prisoner among them you ought to know something about their force, Robert,\" said Mr. Hardy.  \"I had opportunities to observe,\" replied the lad, \"and from what I saw, and from what I have since heard concerning our numbers I judge that we were at least four to one, perhaps more. But we threw away all our advantage when we came with bare breasts against their wooden wall and sharpened boughs.\"  \"It is a painful thing to talk about and to think about, but Britain never gives up. She marches over her mistakes and failures to triumph, and we are bone of her bone. And you saw St. Luc!\"  \"Often, sir. In the battle and in the preparations for it he was the right arm of the Marquis de Montcalm. He is a master of forest war.\"  \"He is all that, Robert, my lad. A strange, a most brilliant man, he is one of our most formidable enemies.\"  \"But a gallant one, sir. He did nothing to prevent my escape. I feel that at Ticonderoga as well as elsewhere I am greatly in his debt.\"  \"Undoubtedly he favors you. It does not surprise me.\"  Intense curiosity leaped up in Robert's heart once more. What was he to St. Luc! What was St. Luc to him! All these elderly men seemed to hold a secret that was hidden from him, and yet it concerned him most. His lips twitched and he was about to ask a question, but he reflected that, as always before, it would not be answered, it would be evaded, and he restrained his eager spirit. He knew that all the men liked him, that they had his good at heart, and that when the time came to speak they would speak. The words that had risen to his lips were unspoken.  Robert felt that his elders wanted to talk, that something they would rather not tell to the lads was in their minds, and meanwhile the brilliant sunshine and free air outside were calling to him and the Onondaga.  \"I think,\" he said, addressing them all collectively, \"that Tayoga and I should go to see Lieutenant Grosvenor. He was our comrade in the forest, and he has been somewhat overcome by his great hardships.\"  \"The idea would not be bad,\" said Master Benjamin Hardy. \"Youth to youth, and, while you are gone, we old fellows will talk of days long ago as old fellows are wont to do.\"  And so they did want him and Tayoga to go! He had divined their wishes aright. He was quite sure, too, that when he and the Onondaga were away the past would be very little in their minds. These active men in the very prime of their powers were concerned most about the present and the future. Well, whatever it was he was sure they would discuss it with wisdom and foresight.  \"Come, Tayoga,\" he said. \"Outdoors is calling to us.\"  \"And be sure that you return in time for supper,\" said Master Jacobus. \"This house is to be your home as long as you are in Albany. I should be offended mortally if you went elsewhere.\"  \"No danger of that,\" said Robert. \"Tayoga and I know a good home when we find it. And we know friends, too, when we see them.\"  It was a bit of sentiment, but he felt it very deeply and he saw that all of the men looked pleased. As he and Tayoga went out he noticed that they drew their chairs about the dining-room table that Caterina had cleared, and before the door closed upon the two lads they were already talking in low and earnest tones.  \"They have affairs of importance which are not for us,\" he said, when he and the Onondaga were outside.  \"It is so,\" said Tayoga. \"The white people have their chiefs and sachems like the nations of the Hodenosaunee, and their ranks are filled by age. The young warriors are for the trail, the hunt, and the war path, and not for the council. It is right that it should be thus. I do not wish to be a chief or a sachem before my time. I am glad, Dagaeoga, to enjoy youth, and let our elders do the hard thinking for us.\"  \"So am I,\" said Robert joyfully as he filled his lungs with draught after draught of the fresh air. \"No seat at the council for me! Not for twenty years yet! Give me freedom and action! Let others do the planning and take the responsibility!\"  He felt a great elation. His sanguine temperament had made a complete rebound from the depression following Ticonderoga. Although he did not know it the result was partly physical--good food and abundant rest, but he did not seek to analyze the cause, the condition was sufficient. The color in his cheeks deepened and his eyes glowed.  \"Dagaeoga is feeling very, very good,\" said Tayoga.  \"I am,\" replied Robert with emphasis. \"I never felt better. I'm forgetting Ticonderoga; instead, I'm beholding our army at Quebec, and I'm seeing our flag wave over all Canada.\"  \"Dagaeoga sees what he wants to see.\"  \"It's not a bad plan. Then the lions die in your path.\"  \"It is so. Dagaeoga speaks a great truth. We will now see how Red Coat feels.\"  A portion of the army that had retreated from Ticonderoga was camped on the flats near the town, and Robert and Tayoga walked swiftly toward the tents. It was a much more silent force, British and American, than that which had gone forth not so very long ago to what seemed certain victory. Officers and men were angry. They felt that they had been beaten when there was no reason why they should have been defeated. Obeying orders, they had retreated in sullen silence, when they had felt sure they could have gone on, fought a new battle, and have crushed Montcalm. Now they waited impatiently for another call to advance on Canada, and win back their lost laurels. Both lads felt the tension.  \"They are like the wounded bear,\" said Tayoga. \"They feel very sore, and they wish for revenge.\"  They learned that Grosvenor was in his tent and soon found him there lying upon his blankets. Some of the ruddy color was gone from his cheeks, and he looked worn and thin. But he sat up, and welcomed Robert and Tayoga joyously.  \"It's foolish of me to break down like this,\" he said, \"but after we got back to civilization something seemed to cave in. I hope you chaps won't overlook the fact that I'm not as much used to the forest as you are, and bear in mind that I did my best.\"  \"Red Coat's best was very good,\" said Tayoga in his grave, precise manner. \"Few who have been in the forest as little as he could have done as much and have borne as much.\"  \"Do you really think so, Tayoga? You're not merely flattering me?\"  \"Our wisest sachem would tell you so, Red Coat.\"  \"Thanks, my friend. You make me feel better. I was lucky enough to go through the great battle with little hurt. It was a most ghastly slaughter, and I still dream of it. I stood up all right until we got back to Albany, and then I collapsed. But to-morrow I'll be on my feet again. Your friends, Colden, Wilton and Carson are all here. They showed great courage and they have some slight wounds, but not enough to trouble 'em.\"  Robert found the Philadelphians a little later, and they all went back to Grosvenor's tent, where they were joined in a half hour by the Virginians, Walter Stuart and James Cabell, who had been with them in Braddock's defeat and whom Robert had known at Williamsburg. It was a tight squeeze for them all in the tent, but there was another and joyous reunion. Youth responded to youth and hope was high.  \"Stuart and I did not arrive in time for Ticonderoga,\" said Cabell, \"but we mean to be in the next great battle.\"  \"So we do!\" exclaimed Cabell. \"The Old Dominion had a taste of defeat at Fort Duquesne and you've had the like here. Now we'll all wait and see how victory agrees with us.\"  \"Some of us have been in at both defeats,\" said Grosvenor rather sadly.  But the presence of so many friends and the cheerful talk made him feel so much better that he averred his ability to go anywhere and do anything at once.  \"You've leave of absence if you wish it?\" asked Cabell.  \"For several days more,\" replied Grosvenor.  \"Then let's all go into the town. I haven't had a good look at Albany yet. I want to see if it's as fine a place as Williamsburg.\"  \"It's larger,\" said Robert.  \"But size is not everything. That's where you northern people make your mistake.\"  \"But you'll admit that Philadelphia's a fine city, won't you?\" said Colden, \"and you know it's the largest in the colonies.\"  \"But it's comparatively near to Virginia,\" said Cabell briskly, \"and our influence works wonders.\"  \"We've our own conceit in Philadelphia,\" said Wilton, \"but conceit and Virginia are just the same words, though they may have a different sound.\"  \"Come on to the George Inn,\" said Grosvenor, \"and you can argue it out there. Old England likes to see this healthy rivalry among her children. She doesn't mind your being bumptious.\"  \"We're bumptious, because we're like our parent,\" said Cabell. \"It's a matter of inheritance.\"  \"Let the George Inn settle it. Come on, lads.\"  Grosvenor was feeling better and better. He was adaptable and this was a sprightly group, full of kindred spirits. The Virginians were as English as he was, and the others nearly as much so. He had acquitted himself well in the New World, in fields with which he was unfamiliar, and these lads were friends. Danger and hardships faded quite away into a forgotten past. He was strong and well once more.  \"You shall all be my guests at the George Inn!\" he exclaimed. \"We shall have refreshment and talk, plenty of both.\"  \"A"]]]
