With the Five Families to push and lead, a new civilization developed, and when Survey came to call they were no longer savages. Combine bought the trade rights about seventy-five years ago. Then the Company and the Five Families got together and marketed a luxury item to the galaxy. You know how every super-jet big shot on twenty-five planets wants to say he's hunted on Khatka. And if he can point out a graz head on his wall, or wear a tail bracelet, he's able to strut with the best. To holiday on Khatka is both fabulous and fashionable--and very, very profitable for the natives and for Combine who sells transportation to the travelers.\"  \"I hear they have poachers, too,\" Dane remarked.  \"Yes, that naturally follows. You know what a glam skin brings on the market. Wherever you have a rigidly controlled export you're going to have poachers and smugglers. But the Patrol doesn't go to Khatka. The natives handle their own criminals. Personally, I'd cheerfully take a ninety-nine-year sentence in the Lunar mines in place of what the Khatkans dish out to a poacher they net!\"  \"So that rumor has spread satisfactorily!\"  Coffee slopped over the brim of Tau's mug and Dane dropped the packet of steak concentrate he was about to feed into the cooker. Chief Ranger Asaki loomed in the doorway of the mess as suddenly as if he had been teleported to that point.  The medic arose to his feet and smiled politely at the visitor.  \"Do I detect in that observation, sir, the suggestion that the tales I have heard were deliberately set to blast where they would do the most good as deterrents?\"  A fleeting grin broke the impassive somberness of the black face.  \"I was informed you are a man skilled in 'magic,' Medic. You certainly display the traditional sorcerer's quickness of wit. But this rumor is also truth.\" The quirk of good humor had gone again, and there was an edge in the Chief Ranger's voice which cut. \"Poachers on Khatka would welcome the Patrol in place of the attention they now receive.\"  He came into the mess cabin, Jellico behind him, and Dane pulled down two of the snap seats. He was holding a mug under the spout of the coffee dispenser as the captain made introductions.  \"Thorson--our acting-cargo-master.\"  \"Thorson,\" the Khatkan acknowledged with a grave nod of his head, and then glanced down to floor level with a look of surprise. Weaving a pattern about his legs, purring loudly, Sindbad was offering an unusually fervent welcome of his own. The Ranger went down on one knee, his hand out for Sindbad's inquiring sniff. Then the cat butted that dark palm, batted at it playfully with claw-sheathed paw.  \"A Terran cat! It is of the lion family?\"  \"Far removed,\" Jellico supplied. \"You'd have to add a lot of bulk to Sindbad to promote him to the lion class.\"  \"We have only the old tales.\" Asaki sounded almost wistful as the cat jumped to his knee and clawed for a hold on his chest belts. \"But I do not believe that lions were ever so friendly toward my ancestors.\"  Dane would have removed the cat, but the Khatkan arose with Sindbad, still purring loudly, resting in the crook of his arm. The Ranger was smiling with a gentleness which changed the whole arrogant cast of his countenance.  \"Do not bring this one to Khatka with you, Captain, or you will never take him away again. Those who dwell in the inner courts would not let him vanish from their sight. Ah, so this pleases you, small lion?\" He rubbed Sindbad gently under the throat and the cat stretched his neck, his yellow eyes half closed in bliss.  \"Thorson,\" the Captain turned to Dane, \"that arrival report on my desk was the final one from Combine?\"  \"Yes, sir. There's no hope of the _Rover_ setting down here before that date.\"  Asaki sat down, still holding the cat. \"So you see, Captain, fortune has arranged it all. You have two tens of days. Four days to go in my cruiser, four days for your return here, and the rest to explore the preserve. We could not ask for better luck, for I do not know when our paths may cross again. In the normal course of events I will not have another mission to Xecho for a year, perhaps longer. Also--\" He hesitated and then spoke to Tau. \"Medic, Captain Jellico has informed me that you have made a study of magic on many worlds.\"  \"That is so, sir.\"  \"Do you then believe that it is real force, or that it is only a superstition for child-people who set up demons to howl petitions to when some darkness falls upon them?\"  \"Some of the magic I have seen is trickery, some of it founded upon an inner knowledge of men and their ways which a shrewd witch doctor can use to his advantage. There always remains\"--Tau put down his mug, \"--there always remains a small residue of happenings and results for which we have not yet found any logical explanations--\"  \"And I believe,\" Asaki interrupted, \"it is also true that a race can be conditioned from birth to be sensitive to forms of magic so that men of that blood are particularly susceptible.\" That was more of a statement than a question, but Tau answered it.  \"That is very true. A Lamorian, for example, can be 'sung' to death. I have witnessed such a case. But upon a Terran or another off-world man the same suggestion would have no effect.\"  \"Those who settled Khatka brought such magic with them.\" The Chief Ranger's fingers still moved about Sindbad's jaw and throat soothingly, but his tone was chill, the coldest thing in the cramped space of the mess cabin.  \"Yes, a highly developed form of it,\" Tau agreed.  \"More highly developed perhaps than even you can believe, Medic!\" That came in a hiss of cold rage. \"I think that its present manifestation--death by a beast that is not a beast--could be worth your detailed study.\"  \"Why?\" Tau came bluntly to the point.  \"Because it is a killing magic and it is being carefully used to rid my world of key men, men we need badly. If there is a weak point in this cloudy attack shaping against us, we must learn it, and soon!\"  It was Jellico who added the rest. \"We are invited to visit Khatka and survey a new hunting range as Chief Ranger Asaki's personal term guests.\"  Dane drew a deep breath of wonder. Guest rights on Khatka were jealously guarded--they were too valuable to their owners to waste. Whole families lived on the income from the yearly rental of even half a one. But the Rangers, by right of office, had several which they could grant to visiting scientists or men from other worlds holding positions similar to their own. To have such an opportunity offered to an ordinary Trader was almost incredible.  His wonder was matched by Tau's and must have been plain to read for the Chief Ranger smiled.  \"For a long time Captain Jellico and I have exchanged biological data on alien life-forms--his skill in photographing such, his knowledge as an xenobiologist are widely recognized. And so I have permission for him to visit the new Zoboru preserve, not yet officially opened. And you, Medic Tau, your help, or at least your diagnosis, we need in another direction. So, one expert comes openly, another not so openly. Though, Medic, your task is approved by my superiors. And\"--he glanced at Dane--\"perhaps to muddle the trail for the suspicious, shall we not ask this young man also?\"  Dane's eyes went to the captain. Jellico was always fair and his crew would have snapped into action on his word alone--even if they were fronting a rain of Thorkian death darts and that order was to advance. But, on the other hand, Dane would never have asked a favor, and the best he hoped for was to be able to perform his duties without unfavorable comment upon their commission. He had no reason to believe Jellico was willing to agree to this.  \"You have two weeks' planet-side leave coming, Thorson. If you want to spend it on Khatka....\" Jellico actually grinned then. \"I take it that you do. When do we up-ship, sir?\"  \"You said that you must wait for the return of your other crew members--shall we say mid-afternoon tomorrow?\" The Chief Ranger stood up and put Sindbad down though the cat protested with several sharp meows.  \"Small lion,\" the tall Khatkan spoke to the cat as to an equal, \"this is your jungle, and mine lies elsewhere. But should you ever grow tired of traveling the stars, there is always a home for you in my courts.\"  When the Chief Ranger went out the door, Sindbad did not try to follow, but he uttered one mournful little cry of protest and loss.  \"So he wants a trouble shooter, does he?\" Tau asked. \"All right, I'll try to hunt out his goblins for him; it'll be worth that to visit Khatka!\"  Dane, remembering the hot glare of the Xecho spaceport, the sea one could not swim in, contrasted that with the tri-dees he had seen of the green hunters' paradise on the next planet of the system. \"Yes, sir!\" he echoed and made a haphazard choice for the cooker.  \"Don't be too lighthearted,\" Tau warned. \"I'll say that any stew which was too hot for that Ranger to handle might give us burned fingers--and quick. When we land on Khatka, walk softly and look over your shoulder, and be prepared for the worst.\"     II   Lightning played along the black ridges above them, and below was a sheer drop to a river which was only a silver thread. Under their boots, man-made and yet dominating the wildness of jungle and mountain, was a platform of rock slabs, fused to support a palace of towering yellow-white walls and curved cups of domes, a palace which was also half fortress, half frontier post.  Dane set his hands on the parapet of the river drop, blinked as a lightning bolt crackled in a sky-splitting glare of violet fire. This was about as far from the steaming islands of Xecho as a man could imagine.  \"The demon graz prepare for battle.\" Asaki nodded toward the distant crackling.  Captain Jellico laughed. \"Supposed to be whetting their tusks, eh? I wouldn't care to meet a graz that could produce"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],["title","Voodoo Planet (#2)"],["body"," a display by mere tusk whetting.\"  \"No? But think of the reward for the tracker who discovers where such go to die. To find the graveyard of the graz herds would make any man wealthy beyond dreams.\"  \"How much truth is there in that legend?\" Tau asked.  The Chief Ranger shrugged. \"Who can say? This much _is_ true: I have served my life in the forests since I could walk. I have listened to the talk of Trackers, Hunters, Rangers in my father's courtyards and field camps since I could understand their words. Yet never has any man reported the finding of a body of a graz that died a natural death. The scavengers might well account for the bulk of flesh, but the tusks and the bones should be visible for years. And this, too, I have seen with my own eyes: a graz close to death, supported by two of its kind and being urged along to the big swamps. Perhaps it is only that the suffering animal longs for water at its end, or perhaps in the heart of that morass there does lie the graz graveyard. But no man has found a naturally dead graz, nor has any returned from exploring the big swamps....\"  Lightning on peaks which were like polished jet--bare rock above, the lush overgrowth of jungle below. And between, this fortress held by men who dared both the heights and the depths. The wildly burgeoning life of Khatka had surrounded the off-worlders since they had come here. There was something untameable about Khatka; the lush planet lured and yet repelled at the same time.  \"Zoboru far from here?\"  The Chief Ranger pointed north in answer to the captain's question.  \"About a hundred leagues. It is the first new preserve we have prepared in ten years. And it is our desire to make it the best for tri-dee hunters. That is why we are now operating taming teams--\"  \"Taming teams?\" Dane had to ask.  The Chief Ranger was ready enough to discuss his project.  \"Zoboru is a no-kill preserve. The animals, they come to learn that after a while. But we cannot wait several years until they do. So we make them gifts.\" He laughed, evidently recalling some incident. \"Sometimes, perhaps, we are too eager. Most of our visitors who wish to make tri-dees want to picture big game--graz, amplet, rock apes, lions--\"  \"Lions?\" echoed Dane.  \"Not Terran lions, no. But my people, when they landed on Khatka, found a few animals that reminded them of those they had always known. So they gave those the same names. A Khatkan lion is furred, it is a hunter and a great fighter, but it is not the cat of Terra. However, it is in great demand as a tri-dee actor. So we summon it out of lurking by providing free meals. One shoots a poli, a water rat, or a landeer and drags the carcass behind a low-flying flitter. The lion springs upon the moving meat, which it can also scent, and the rope is cut, leaving a free dinner.  \"The lions are not stupid. In a very short time they connect the sound of a flitter cutting the air with food. So they come to the banquet and those on the flitter can take their tri-dee shots at ease. Only there must also be care taken in such training. One forest guard on the Komog preserve became too enterprising. He dragged his kill at first. Then, to see if he could get the lions to forget man's presence entirely, he hung the training carcasses on the flitter, encouraging them to jump for their food.  \"For the guard that was safe enough, but it worked too too well. A month or so later a Hunter was escorting a client through Komog and they swung low to get a good picture of a water rat emerging from the river. Suddenly there was a snarl behind them and they found themselves sharing the flitter with a lioness annoyed at finding no meat waiting on board.  \"Luckily, they both wore stass belts; but they had to land the flitter and leave until the lioness wandered off, and she seriously damaged the machine in her irritation. So now our guards play no more fancy tricks while on taming runs. Tomorrow--no,\" he corrected himself, \"the day after tomorrow I will be able to show you how the process works.\"  \"And tomorrow?\" inquired the captain.  \"Tomorrow my men make hunting magic.\" Asaki's voice was expressionless.  \"Your chief witch doctor being?\" questioned Tau.  \"Lumbrilo.\" The Chief Ranger did not appear disposed to add to that but Tau pursued the subject.  \"His office is hereditary?\"  \"Yes. Does that make any difference?\" For the first time there was a current of repressed eagerness in the other's tone.  \"Perhaps a vast amount of difference,\" Tau replied. \"A hereditary office may carry with it two forms of conditioning, one to influence its holder, one to affect the public-at-large. Your Lumbrilo may have come to believe deeply in his own powers; he would be a very remarkable man if he did not. It is almost certain that your people unquestionably accept him as a worker of wonders?\"  \"They do so accept.\" Once more Asaki's voice was drained of life.  \"And Lumbrilo does not accept something you believe necessary?\"  \"Again the truth, Medic. Lumbrilo does not accept his proper place in the scheme of things!\"  \"He is a member of one of your Five Families?\"  \"No, his clan is small, always set apart. From the beginning here, those who spoke for gods and demons did not also order men.\"  \"Separation of church and state,\" commented Tau thoughtfully. \"Yet in our Terran past there have been times when church and state were one. Does Lumbrilo desire that?\"  Asaki raised his eyes to the mountain peaks, to the northward where lay his beloved work.  \"I do not know what Lumbrilo wants, save that it makes mischief--or worse! This I tell you: hunting magic is part of our lives and it has at its core some of those unexplainable happenings which you have acknowledged do exist. I have used powers I can neither explain nor understand as part of my work. In the jungle and on the grasslands an off-worlder must guard his life with a stass belt if he goes unarmed. But I--any of my men--can walk unharmed if we obey the rules of our magic. Only Lumbrilo does other things which his forefathers did not. And he boasts that he can do more. So he has a growing following of those who believe--and those who fear.\"  \"You want me to face him?\"  The Chief Ranger's big hands closed upon the rim of the parapet as if they could exert enough pressure to crumble the hard stone. \"I want you to see whether there is trickery in this. Trickery I can fight, for that there are weapons. But if Lumbrilo truly controls forces for which there is no name, then perhaps we must patch up an uneasy peace--or go down in defeat. And, off-worlder, I come from a line of warriors--we do not drink defeat easily!\"  \"That I also believe,\" Tau returned quietly. \"Be sure, sir, if there is trickery in this man's magic and I can detect it, the secret shall be yours.\"  \"Let us hope that so it shall be.\"  Subconsciously, Dane had always associated the practice of magic with darkness and the night. But the next morning the sun was high and hot when he made one of the party coming down to a second and larger walled terrace where the Hunters, Trackers, Guards and other followers of the Chief Ranger were assembled in irregular rows.  There was a low sound which was more a throb in the clear air about them, getting into a man's blood and pumping in rhythm there. Dane tracked the sound to its source: four large drums standing waist high before the men who tapped them delicately with the tips of all ten fingers.  The necklaces of claws and teeth about those dusky throats, the kilts of fringed hide, the crossed belts of brilliantly spotted or striped fur were in contrast to the very efficient and modern side arms each man wore, to the rest of the equipment sheathed and strapped at their belts.  There was a carved stool for the Chief Ranger, another for Captain Jellico. Dane and Tau settled themselves on the less comfortable seats of the terrace steps. Those tapping fingers increased their rate of beat, and the notes of the drums rose from the low murmur of hived bees to the mutter of mountain thunder still half a range away. A bird called from those inner courts of the palace from which the women never ventured.  Da--da--da--da.... Voices took up the thud-thud of the drums, the heads of the squatting men moved in a slow swing from side to side. Tau's hand closed about Dane's wrist and the younger man looked around, startled, to see that the medic's eyes were alight, that he was watching the assembly with the alertness of Sindbad approaching prey.  \"Calculate the stowage space in Number One hold!\"  That amazing order, delivered in a whisper, shocked Dane into obeying it. Number One hold ... there were three divisions now and the stowage was--He became aware that for a small space of time he had escaped the net being woven by the beat of the drum, the drone of voices, the nodding of heads. He moistened his lips. So that was how it worked! He had heard Tau speak often enough about self-hypnotism under such conditions, but this was the first time the meaning of it had been clear.  Two men were shuffling out of nowhere, wearing nothing on their dark bodies but calf-length kilts of tails, black tails with fluffy white tips, which swayed uniformly in time to their pacing feet. Their heads and shoulders were masked by beautifully cured and semi-mounted animal heads displaying half-open jaws with double pairs of curved fangs. The black-and-white striped fur, the sharply pointed ears, were neither canine nor feline, but a weird combination of the two.  Dane gabbled two trading formulas under his breath and tried to think of the relation of Samantine rock coinage to galactic credits. Only this time his defenses did not work. From between the two shuffling dancers padded something on four feet. The canine-feline creature was more than just a head; it was a loose-limbed, graceful body fully eight feet in length, and the red eyes in the prick-eared head were those of a confident killer. It walked without restraint, lazily, with arrogance,"]]]
