And the English merchants and ship owners, who were losing heavily because the Americans refused to buy any English goods as long as the Stamp Act was in force, joined in begging Parliament that the act be repealed. This was done the next year.  Other unjust measures followed, but before we take them up, let us catch another glimpse of Patrick Henry, ten years after his great speech at Williamsburg.   ANOTHER GREAT SPEECH BY PATRICK HENRY  The people of Virginia are again greatly aroused. King George has caused Parliament to send English soldiers to Boston to force the unruly people of Massachusetts to obey some of his commands, against which they had rebelled. Virginia has stood by her sister colony, and now the royal governor of Virginia, to punish her, has prevented the House of Burgesses from meeting at Williamsburg.  But the Virginians are not so easily kept from doing their duty. With a grim determination to defend their rights as free men, they elect some of their leaders to act for them at this trying time.  These meet in Richmond at old St. John's Church, which is still standing. Great is the excitement, and thoughtful people are very serious, for the shadows of the war-cloud grow blacker hour by hour.  The Virginians have already begun to make ready to fight if they must. But many still hope that all disagreements may yet be settled peaceably, and therefore advise acting with caution.  [Illustration: St. John's Church, Richmond.]  Patrick Henry is not one of these. He believes that the time has come when talking should give place to prompt, decisive action. The war is at hand. It cannot be avoided. The colonists must fight or slavishly submit.  So intense is his belief that he offers in this meeting a resolution that Virginia should at once prepare to defend herself. Many of the leading men stoutly oppose this resolution as rash and unwise.  At length Patrick Henry rises to his feet, his face pale, and his voice trembling with deep emotion. Again we see the bent shoulders straighten and the eyes flash. His voice rings out like a trumpet. As he goes on with increasing power, men lean forward in breathless interest. Listen to his ringing words:  \"We must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of Hosts is all that is left us! They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of the means which the God of nature hath placed in our hands.... There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come!  \"... Gentlemen may cry peace, peace--but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!\"  What wonder that the audience sways to his belief!  He was a true prophet, for in less than four weeks the first gun of the Revolution was fired in the quiet town of Lexington, Massachusetts. Undoubtedly Patrick Henry's fiery spirit had done much to kindle the flame which then burst forth.  Not long after this, he was made commander-in-chief of the Virginia forces (1775), and the next year was elected governor of Virginia.  When the war--in the declaring of which he had taken so active a part--was over, Patrick Henry retired at the age of fifty-eight (1794), to an estate in Charlotte County called \"Red Hill,\" where he lived a simple and beautiful life. He died in 1799.  Without doubt he was one of the most eloquent orators our country has ever produced, and we should be grateful to him because he used his great gift in helping to secure the freedom we now enjoy.   SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT  1. What was the Stamp Act? Why did Parliament pass it, and why did the colonists object to it?  2. What did Patrick Henry mean by saying that the General Assembly of Virginia, _and only_ the General Assembly of Virginia had the right and the power of laying taxes upon the people of that colony?  3. Have you in your mind a picture of young Patrick Henry as he rode on horseback along the country road toward Williamsburg? Describe this picture as clearly as you can.  4. What did William Pitt think of the Stamp Act? Why did Parliament repeal it?  5. Can you explain Patrick Henry's power as an orator? When did he make a great speech in St. John's Church, Richmond?  6. What do you admire in Patrick Henry?  7. Do not fail to locate every event upon your map.     CHAPTER II  SAMUEL ADAMS   While Patrick Henry was leading the people of Virginia in their defiance of the Stamp Act, exciting events were taking place in Massachusetts under another colonial leader. This was Samuel Adams. Even before Virginia took any action, he had introduced in the Massachusetts Assembly resolutions opposing the Stamp Act, and they were passed.  This man, who did more than any one else to arouse the love of liberty in his colony, was born in Boston in 1722. His boyhood was quite different from that of Patrick Henry. He liked to go to school and to learn from books, and he cared little for outdoor life or sport of any kind.  [Illustration: Samuel Adams.]  As he grew up, his father wished him to become a clergyman, but Samuel preferred to study law. His mother opposing this, however, he entered upon business life. This perhaps was a mistake, for he did not take to business, and, like Patrick Henry, he soon failed, even losing most of the property his father had left him.   SAMUEL ADAMS AN INSPIRING LEADER  But although not skilful in managing his own affairs, he was a most loyal and successful worker for the interests of the colony. In fact, before long, he gave up most of his private business and spent his time and strength for the public welfare.  His whole income was the very small salary which he received as clerk of the Assembly of Massachusetts. This was hardly sufficient to pay for the food needed in his household. But his wife was so thrifty and cheerful, and his friends so glad to help him out because of the time he gave to public affairs, that his home life, though plain, was comfortable, and his children were well brought up.  Poor as he was, no man could be more upright. The British, fearing his influence, tried at different times to bribe him with office under the King and to buy him with gold. But he scorned any such attempts to turn him aside from the path of duty.  The great purpose of his life seemed to be to encourage the colonists to stand up for their rights as freemen, and to defeat the plans of King George and Parliament in trying to force the colonists to pay taxes. In this he was busy night and day. In the assembly and in the town meeting all looked to him as an able leader; and in the workshops, on the streets, or in the shipyards men listened eagerly while he made clear the aims of the English King, and urged them to defend their rights as free-born Englishmen.  Even at the close of a busy day, this earnest, liberty-loving man gave himself little rest. Sometimes he was writing articles for the newspapers, and sometimes urgent letters to the various leaders in Massachusetts and in the other colonies. Long after midnight, those who passed his dimly lighted windows could see \"Sam Adams hard at work writing against the Tories.\"  [Illustration: Patriots in New York Destroying Stamps Intended for Use in Connecticut.]  Had you seen him at this time, you would never have thought of him as a remarkable man. He was of medium size, with keen gray eyes, and hair already fast turning white. His head and hands trembled as if with age, though he was only forty-two years old and in good health.  He was a great power in the colony. Not only did he rouse the people against the Stamp Act, but he helped to organize, in opposition to it, societies of patriots called \"Sons of Liberty,\" who refused to use the stamps and often destroyed them. In Massachusetts, as in Virginia and elsewhere, the people refused to buy any English goods until this hateful act was repealed.  At the close of a year, before it had really been put into operation, the act was repealed, as we have already seen. But this did not happen until many resolutions had been passed, many appeals made to the King, and after much excitement. Then great was the rejoicing! In every town in the country bonfires were lighted, and every colonial assembly sent thanks to the King.  But the obstinate, power-loving George III was not happy about this repeal. In fact, he had given in very much against his will. He wanted to rule England in his own way, and how could he do so if he allowed his stubborn colonists in America thus to get the better of him?  So he made up his mind to insist upon some sort of a tax. In 1767, therefore, only one year after the repeal of the Stamp Act, he asked Parliament to pass a law taxing glass, lead, paper, tea, and a few other articles imported into the colonies.  This new tax was laid, but again the colonists said: \"We had no part in levying it, and if we pay it, we shall be giving up our rights as freemen. But how can we help ourselves?\"  Samuel"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18618"],["title","Stories of Later American History (#3)"],["body"," and other leaders answered: \"We can resist it just as we did the Stamp Act--by refusing to buy any goods whatever from England.\" To this the merchants agreed. While the unjust tax was in force, they promised to import no English goods, and the people promised not to ask for such goods.  Then many wealthy people agreed to wear homespun instead of English cloths, and to stop eating mutton in order to have more sheep to produce wool for this homespun, thus showing a willingness to give up for the cause some of the luxuries which they had learned to enjoy.  Of course, this stand taken by the colonists angered the King. He called them rebels and sent soldiers to Boston to help enforce the laws (1768).  From the first the people of Boston felt insulted at having these soldiers in their midst, and it was not long before trouble broke out. In a street fight at night the troops fired upon the crowd, killing and wounding a number of men.  This caused great excitement. The next day, under the leadership of Samuel Adams, the citizens of Boston demanded that all the soldiers should be removed. Fearing more serious trouble if the demand was disregarded, the officers withdrew the soldiers to an island in the harbor.  Still the feeling did not die down. The new taxes were a constant irritation. \"Only slaves would submit to such an injustice,\" said Samuel Adams, and his listeners agreed. In Massachusetts and in other colonies the English goods were refused, and, as in the case of the Stamp Act, the English merchants felt the pinch of heavy losses, and begged that the new tax laws be repealed.   SAMUEL ADAMS AND THE \"BOSTON TEA PARTY\"  Feeling grew stronger and matters grew worse until at length, after something like three years, Parliament took off all the new taxes except the one on tea. \"They must pay one tax to know we keep the right to tax,\" said the King. It was as if the King's followers had winked slyly at one another and said: \"We shall see--we shall see! Those colonists must have their tea to drink, and a little matter of threepence a pound they will overlook.\"  It would have been much better for England if she had taken off all the taxes and made friends with the colonists. Many leaders in that country said so, but the stubborn King was bent upon having his own way. \"I will be King,\" he said. \"They shall do as I say.\"  Then he and his followers worked up what seemed to them a clever scheme for hoodwinking the colonists. \"We will make the tea cheaper in America than in England,\" they said. \"Such a bargain! How can the simple colonists resist it?\" Great faith was put in this foolish plan.  But they were soon to find out that those simple colonists were only Englishmen across the sea, that they too had strong wills, and that they did not care half so much about buying cheap tea as they did about giving up a principle and paying a tax, however small, which they had no part in levying.  King George went straight ahead to carry out his plan. It was arranged that the East India Company should ship cargoes of tea to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.  In due time the tea arrived. Then the King's eyes were opened. What did he find out about the spirit of these colonists? That they simply would _not_ use this tea. The people in New York and Philadelphia refused to let it land, and in Charleston they stored it in damp cellars, where it spoiled.  But the most exciting time was in Boston, where the Tory governor, Hutchinson, was determined to carry out the King's wishes. Hence occurred the famous \"Boston Tea Party,\"--a strange tea-party, where no cups were used, no guests invited, and no tea drunk! Did you ever hear of such a party? Let us see what really happened.  It was on a quiet Sunday, the 28th of November, 1773, when the Dartmouth, the first of the three tea ships bound for Boston, sailed into the harbor. The people were attending service in the various churches when the cry, \"The Dartmouth is in!\" spread like wild-fire. Soon the streets were alive with people. That was a strange Sunday in Puritan Boston.  The leaders quickly sought out Benjamin Rotch, the owner of the Dartmouth, and obtained his promise that the tea should not be landed before Tuesday. Then they called a mass meeting for Monday morning, in Fanueil Hall, afterward known as the \"Cradle of Liberty.\"  [Illustration: Fanueil Hall, Boston.]  The crowd was so great that they adjourned to the Old South Church, and there they overflowed into the street. There were five thousand in all, some of them from near-by towns. Samuel Adams presided. In addressing the meeting, he asked: \"Is it the firm resolution of this body not only that the tea shall be sent back, but that no duty shall be paid thereon?\" \"Yes!\" came the prompt and united answer from these brave men.  So the patriots of Boston and the surrounding towns, with Samuel Adams at their head, were determined that the tea should not be landed. Governor Hutchinson was equally determined that it should be. A stubborn fight, therefore, was on hand.  The Boston patriots appointed men, armed with muskets and bayonets, to watch the tea ships, some by day, others by night. Six post-riders were appointed, who should keep their horses saddled and bridled, ready to speed into the country to give the alarm if a landing should be attempted. Sentinels were stationed in the church belfries to ring the bells, and beacon-fires were made ready for lighting on the surrounding hilltops.  Tuesday, December 16, dawned. It was a critical day. If the tea should remain in the harbor until the morrow--the twentieth day after arrival--the revenue officer would be empowered by law to land it forcibly.  [Illustration: Old South Church, Boston.]  Men, talking angrily and shaking their fists with excitement, were thronging into the streets of Boston from the surrounding towns. By ten o'clock over seven thousand had assembled in the Old South Church and in the streets outside. They were waiting for the coming of Benjamin Rotch, who had gone to see if the collector would give him a \"clearance,\" or permission to sail out of the port of Boston with the tea.  Rotch came in and told the angry crowd that the collector refused to give the clearance. The people told him that he must get a pass from the governor. Then the meeting adjourned for the morning.  At three o'clock in the afternoon a great throng of eager men again crowded the Old South Church and the streets outside to wait for the return of Rotch. It was an anxious moment. \"If the governor refuses to give the pass, shall the revenue officer be allowed to seize the tea and land it to-morrow morning?\" Many anxious faces showed that men were asking themselves this momentous question.  [Illustration: The \"Boston Tea Party.\"]  But while, in deep suspense, the meeting waited for Rotch to come they discussed the situation, and suddenly John Rowe asked: \"Who knows how tea will mingle with salt water?\" At once a whirlwind of applause swept through the assembly and the masses outside. A plan was soon formed.  The afternoon light of the short winter day faded, and darkness deepened; the lights of candles sprang up here and there in the windows. It was past six o'clock when Benjamin Rotch entered the church and, with pale face, said: \"The governor refuses to give a pass.\"  An angry murmur arose, but the crowd soon became silent as Samuel Adams stood up. He said quietly: \"This meeting can do nothing more to save the country.\"  These words were plainly a signal. In an instant a war-whoop sounded outside, and forty or fifty \"Mohawks,\" or men dressed as Indians, who had been waiting, dashed past the door and down Milk Street toward Griffin's Wharf, where the tea ships were lying at anchor.  It was then bright moonlight, and everything could be plainly seen. Many men stood on shore and watched the \"Mohawks\" as they broke open three hundred and forty-two chests, and poured the tea into the harbor. There was no confusion. All was done in perfect order. But what a strange \"tea party\" it was! Certainly no other ever used so much tea or so much water.  Soon waiting messengers were speeding to outlying towns with the news, and Paul Revere, \"booted and spurred,\" mounted a swift horse and carried the glorious message through the colonies as far as Philadelphia.   SOME RESULTS OF THE \"BOSTON TEA PARTY\"  The Boston Tea Party was not a festivity which pleased the King. In fact, it made him very furious. He promptly decided to punish the rebellious colony. Parliament therefore passed the \"Boston Port Bill,\" by which the port of Boston was to be closed to trade until the people paid for the tea. But this they had no mind to do. They stubbornly refused.  Not Boston alone came under the displeasure of King George and Parliament. They put Massachusetts under military rule, with General Gage as governor, and sent more soldiers. The new governor gave orders that the colonial assembly should hold no more meetings. He said that the people should no longer make their own laws, nor levy their own taxes. This punishment was indeed severe.  With no vessels allowed to enter or leave the harbor and trade entirely cut off, the people of Boston soon began to suffer. But the brave men and women would not give in. They said: \"We will not pay for the tea, nor will we tell the King we are sorry for what we have done.\"  When the people of the other colonies heard of the suffering in Boston, they sent wheat, cows, sheep, fish, sugar, and other kinds of food to help out. The King thought that by punishing Boston he would frighten the other colonies. But he was mistaken, for they said: \"We will help the people of our sister colony. Her cause is our cause. We must all pull together in our resistance to King George and the English Parliament.\" So his action really united the colonies.  In order to work together to better advantage, the colonies agreed that each should send to a great meeting some of their strongest men to talk"]]]
