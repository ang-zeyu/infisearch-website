He had rushed from the room, and during the deep silence that ensued he could be heard throwing things about in the chamber overhead, and in a very few moments the banging of the front door and scurrying down the brown-stone steps showed that he had gone out of doors to cool off.  [Illustration: HE COULD BE HEARD THROWING THINGS ABOUT]  \"It is too bad,\" said the Idiot, after a while, \"that he has such a quick temper. It doesn't do a bit of good to get mad that way. He'll be uncomfortable all day long, and over what? Just because I attempted to say a good word for him, and announce the restoration of my confidence in his temperance qualities, he cuts up a high-jinks that makes everybody uncomfortable.  \"But to resume about this fish business,\" continued the Idiot. \"Fish--\"  \"Oh, fish be hanged!\" said the Doctor, impatiently. \"We've had enough of fish.\"  \"Very well,\" returned the idiot; \"as you wish. Hanging isn't the best treatment for fish, but we'll let that go. I never cared for the finny tribe myself, and if Mrs. Pedagog can be induced to do it, I for one am in favor of keeping shad, shark, and shrimps out of the house altogether.\"     VI   The Idiot was unusually thoughtful--a fact which made the School-Master and the Bibliomaniac unusually nervous. Their stock criticism of him was that he was thoughtless; and yet when he so far forgot his natural propensities as to meditate, they did not like it. It made them uneasy. They had a haunting fear that he was conspiring with himself against them, and no man, not even a callous school-master or a confirmed bibliomaniac, enjoys feeling that he is the object of a conspiracy. The thing to do, then, upon this occasion, seemed obviously to interrupt his train of thought--to put obstructions upon his mental track, as it were, and ditch the express, which they feared was getting up steam at that moment to run them down.  \"You don't seem quite yourself this morning, sir,\" said the Bibliomaniac.  \"Don't I?\" queried the Idiot. \"And whom do I seem to be?\"  \"I mean that you seem to have something on your mind that worries you,\" said the Bibliomaniac.  \"No, I haven't anything on my mind,\" returned the Idiot. \"I was thinking about you and Mr. Pedagog--which implies a thought not likely to use up much of my gray matter.\"  \"Do you think your head holds any gray matter?\" put in the Doctor.  \"Rather verdant, I should say,\" said Mr. Pedagog.  \"Green, gray, or pink,\" said the Idiot, \"choose your color. It does not affect the fact that I was thinking about the Bibliomaniac and Mr. Pedagog. I have a great scheme in hand, which only requires capital and the assistance of those two gentlemen to launch it on the sea of prosperity. If any of you gentlemen want to get rich and die in comfort as the owner of your homes, now is your chance.\"  \"In what particular line of business is your scheme?\" asked Mr. Whitechoker. He had often felt that he would like to die in comfort, and to own a little house, even if it had a large mortgage on it.  \"Journalism,\" said the Idiot. \"There is a pile of money to be made out of journalism, particularly if you happen to strike a new idea. Ideas count.\"  \"How far up do your ideas count--up to five?\" questioned Mr. Pedagog, with a tinge of sarcasm in his tone.  \"I don't know about that,\" returned the Idiot. \"The idea I have hold of now, however, will count up into the millions if it can only be set going, and before each one of those millions will stand a big capital S with two black lines drawn vertically through it--in other words, my idea holds dollars, but to get the crop you've got to sow the seed. Plant a thousand dollars in my idea, and next year you'll reap two thousand. Plant that, and next year you'll have four thousand, and so on. At that rate millions come easy.\"  \"I'll give you a dollar for the idea,\" said the Bibliomaniac.  \"No, I don't want to sell. You'll do to help develop the scheme. You'll make a first-rate tool, but you aren't the workman to manage the tool. I will go as far as to say, however, that without you and Mr. Pedagog, or your equivalents in the animal kingdom, the idea isn't worth the fabulous sum you offer.\"  \"You have quite aroused my interest,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"Do you propose to start a new paper?\"  \"You are a good guesser,\" replied the Idiot. \"That is a part of the scheme--but it isn't the idea. I propose to start a new paper in accordance with the plan which the idea contains.\"  \"Is it to be a magazine, or a comic paper, or what?\" asked the Bibliomaniac.  \"Neither. It's a daily.\"  \"That's nonsense,\" said Mr. Pedagog, putting his spoon into the condensed-milk can by mistake. \"There isn't a single scheme in daily journalism that hasn't been tried--except printing an evening paper in the morning.\"  \"That's been tried,\" said the Idiot. \"I know of an evening paper the second edition of which is published at mid-day. That's an old dodge, and there's money in it, too--money that will never be got out of it. But I really have a grand scheme. So many of our dailies, you know, go in for every horrid detail of daily events that people are beginning to tire of them. They contain practically the same things day after day. So many columns of murder, so many beautiful suicides, so much sport, a modicum of general intelligence, plenty of fires, no end of embezzlements, financial news, advertisements, and head-lines. Events, like history, repeat themselves, until people have grown weary of them. They want something new. For instance, if you read in your morning paper that a man has shot another man, you know that the man who was shot was an inoffensive person who never injured a soul, stood high in the community in which he lived, and leaves a widow with four children. On the other hand, you know without reading the account that the murderer shot his victim in self-defence, and was apprehended by the detectives late last night; that his counsel forbid him to talk to the reporters, and that it is rumored that he comes of a good family living in New England.  \"If a breach of trust is committed, you know that the defaulter was the last man of whom such an act would be suspected, and, except in the one detail of its location and sect, that he was prominent in some church. You can calculate to a cent how much has been stolen by a glance at the amount of space devoted to the account of the crime. Loaf of bread, two lines. Thousand dollars, ten lines. Hundred thousand dollars, half-column. Million dollars, a full column. Five million dollars, half the front page, wood-cut of the embezzler, and two editorials, one leader and one paragraph.  \"And so with everything. We are creatures of habit. The expected always happens, and newspapers are dull because the events they chronicle are dull.\"  \"Granting the truth of this,\" put in the School-Master, \"what do you propose to do?\"  \"Get up a newspaper that will devote its space to telling what hasn't happened.\"  \"That's been done,\" said the Bibliomaniac.  \"To a much more limited extent than we think,\" returned the Idiot. \"It has never been done consistently and truthfully.\"  \"I fail to see how a newspaper can be made to prevaricate truthfully,\" asserted Mr. Whitechoker. To tell the truth, he was greatly disappointed with the idea, because he could not in the nature of things become one of its beneficiaries.  [Illustration: \"HE WAS NOT MURDERED\"]  \"I haven't suggested prevarication,\" said the Idiot. \"Put on your front page, for instance, an item like this: 'George Bronson, colored, aged twenty-nine, a resident of Thompson Street, was caught cheating at poker last night. He was not murdered.' There you tell what has not happened. There is a variety about it. It has the charm of the unexpected. Then you might say: 'Curious incident on Wall Street yesterday. So-and-so, who was caught on the bear side of the market with 10,000 shares of J. B. & S. K. W., paid off all his obligations in full, and retired from business with $1,000,000 clear.' Or we might say, 'Superintendent Smithers, of the St. Goliath's Sunday-school, who is also cashier in the Forty-eighth National Bank, has not absconded with $4,000,000.'\"  [Illustration: \"SUPERINTENDENT SMITHERS HAS NOT ABSCONDED\"]  \"Oh, that's a rich idea,\" put in the School-Master. \"You'd earn $1,000,000 in libel suits the first year.\"  \"No, you wouldn't, either,\" said the Idiot. \"You don't libel a man when you say he hasn't murdered anybody. Quite the contrary, you call attention to his conspicuous virtue. You are in reality commending those who refrain from criminal practice, instead of delighting those who are fond of departing from the paths of Christianity by giving them notoriety.\"  \"But I fail to see in what respect Mr. Pedagog and I are essential to your scheme,\" said the Bibliomaniac.  \"I must confess to some curiosity on my own part on that point,\" added the School-Master.  \"Why, it's perfectly clear,\" returned the Idiot, with a conciliating smile as he prepared to depart. \"You both know so much that isn't so, that I rather rely on you to fill up.\"     VII   A new boarder had joined the circle about Mrs. Pedagog's breakfast-table. He had what the Idiot called a three-ply name--which was Richard Henderson Warren--and he was by profession a poet. Whether it was this that made it necessary for him to board or not, the rewards of the muse being rather slender, was known only to himself, and he showed no disposition to enlighten his fellow-boarders on the subject. His success as a poet Mrs. Pedagog found it hard to gauge; for while the postman left almost daily numerous letters, the envelopes of which showed that they came from the various periodicals of the day, it was never exactly clear whether or not the missives contained remittances or rejected"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18881"],["title","The Idiot (#6)"],["body","nuscripts, though the fact that Mr. Warren was the only boarder in the house who had requested to have a waste-basket added to the furniture of his room seemed to indicate that they contained the latter. To this request Mrs. Pedagog had gladly acceded, because she had a notion that therein at some time or another would be found a clew to the new boarder's past history--or possibly some evidence of such duplicity as the good lady suspected he might be guilty of. She had read that Byron was profligate, and that Poe was addicted to drink, and she was impressed with the idea that poets generally were bad men, and she regarded the waste-basket as a possible means of protecting herself against any such idiosyncrasies of her new-found genius as would operate to her disadvantage if not looked after in time.  This waste-basket she made it her daily duty to empty, and in the privacy of her own room. Half-finished \"ballads, songs, and snatches\" she perused before consigning them to the flames or to the large jute bag in the cellar, for which the ragman called two or three times a year. Once Mrs. Pedagog's heart almost stopped beating when she found at the bottom of the basket a printed slip beginning, \"_The Editor regrets that the enclosed lines are unavailable_,\" and closing with about thirteen reasons, any one or all of which might have been the main cause of the poet's disappointment. Had it not been for the kindly clause in the printed slip that insinuated in graceful terms that this rejection did not imply a lack of literary merit in the contribution itself, the good lady, knowing well that there was even less money to be made from rejected than from accepted poetry, would have been inclined to request the poet to vacate the premises. The very next day, however, she was glad she had not requested the resignation of the poet from the laureateship of her house; for the same basket gave forth another printed slip from another editor, begging the poet to accept the enclosed check, with thanks for his contribution, and asking him to deposit it as soon as practicable--which was pleasing enough, since it implied that the poet was the possessor of a bank account.  Now Mrs. Pedagog was consumed with curiosity to know for how large a sum the check called--which desire was gratified a few days later, when the inspired boarder paid his week's bill with three one-dollar bills and a check, signed by a well-known publisher, for two dollars.  [Illustration: THE INSPIRED BOARDER PAID HIS BILL]  By the boarders themselves the poet was regarded with much interest. The School-Master had read one or two of his effusions in the Fireside Corner of the journal he received weekly from his home up in New England--effusions which showed no little merit, as well as indicating that Mr. Warren wrote for a literary syndicate; Mr. Whitechoker had known of him as the young man who was to have written a Christmas carol for his Sunday-school a year before, and who had finished and presented the manuscript shortly after New-Year's day; while to the Idiot, Mr. Warren's name was familiar as that of a frequent contributor to the funny papers of the day.  \"I was very much amused by your poem in the last number of the _Observer_, Mr. Warren,\" said the Idiot, as they sat down to breakfast together.  \"Were you, indeed?\" returned Mr. Warren. \"I am sorry to hear that, for it was intended to be a serious effort.\"  \"Of course it was, Mr. Warren, and so it appeared,\" said the School-Master, with an indignant glance at the Idiot. \"It was a very dignified and stately bit of work, and I must congratulate you upon it.\"  \"I didn't mean to give offence,\" said the Idiot. \"I've read so much of yours that was purely humorous that I believe I'd laugh at a dirge if you should write one; but I really thought your lines in the _Observer_ were a burlesque. You had the same thought that Rossetti expresses in 'The Woodspurge':     'The wind flapped loose, the wind was still,     Shaken out dead from tree to hill;     I had walked on at the wind's will,     I sat now, for the wind was still.'  That's Rossetti, if you remember. Slightly suggestive of 'Blow Ye Winds of the Morning! Blow! Blow! Blow!' but more or less pleasing.\"  \"I recall the poem you speak of,\" said Warren, with dignity; \"but the true poet, sir--and I hope I have some claim to be considered as such--never so far forgets himself as to burlesque his masters.\"  \"Well, I don't know what to call it, then, when a poet takes the same thought that has previously been used by his masters and makes a funny poem--\"  \"But,\" returned the Poet, warmly, \"it was not a funny poem.\"  \"It made me laugh,\" retorted the Idiot, \"and that is more than half the professedly funny poems we get nowadays can do. Therefore I say it was a funny poem, and I don't see how you can deny that it was a burlesque of Rossetti.\"  \"Well, I do deny it _in toto_.\"  \"I don't know anything about denying it _in toto_,\" rejoined the Idiot, \"but I'd deny it in print if I were you. I know plenty of people who think it was a burlesque, and I overheard one man say--he is a Rossetti crank--that you ought to be ashamed of yourself for writing it.\"  \"There is no use of discussing the matter further,\" said the Poet. \"I am innocent of any such intent as you have ascribed to me, and if people say I have burlesqued Rossetti they say what is not true.\"  \"Did you ever read that little poem of Swinburne's called 'The Boy at the Gate'?\" asked the Idiot, to change the subject.  \"I have no recollection of it,\" said the Poet, shortly.  \"The name sounds familiar,\" put in Mr. Whitechoker, anxious not to be left out of a literary discussion.  \"I have read it, but I forget just how it goes,\" vouchsafed the School-Master, forgetting for a moment the Robert Elsmere episode and its lesson.  \"It goes something like this,\" said the Idiot:     \"Sombre and sere the slim sycamore sighs;     Lushly the lithe leaves lie low o'er the land;     Whistles the wind with its whisperings wise,     Grewsomely gloomy and garishly grand.     So doth the sycamore solemnly stand,     Wearily watching in wondering wait;     So it has stood for six centuries, and     Still it is waiting the boy at the gate.\"  \"No; I never read the poem,\" said Mr. Whitechoker, \"but I'd know it was Swinburne in a minute. He has such a command of alliterative language.\"  \"Yes,\" said the Poet, with an uneasy glance at the Idiot. \"It is Swinburnian; but what was the poem about?\"  \"'The boy at the gate,'\" said the Idiot. \"The idea was that the sycamore was standing there for centuries waiting for the boy who never turns up.\"  \"It really is a beautiful thought,\" put in Mr. Whitechoker. \"It is, I presume, an allegory to contrast faithful devotion and constancy with unfaithfulness and fickleness. Such thoughts occur only to the wholly gifted. It is only to the poetic temperament that the conception of such a thought can come coupled with the ability to voice it in fitting terms. There is a grandeur about the lines the Idiot has quoted that betrays the master-mind.\"  \"Very true,\" said the School-Master, \"and I take this opportunity to say that I am most agreeably surprised in the Idiot. It is no small thing even to be able to repeat a poet's lines so carefully, and with so great lucidity, and so accurately, as I can testify that he has just done.\"  \"Don't be too pleased, Mr. Pedagog,\" said the Idiot, dryly. \"I only wanted to show Mr. Warren that you and Mr. Whitechoker, mines of information though you are, have not as yet worked up a corner on knowledge to the exclusion of the rest of us.\" And with these words the Idiot left the table.  \"He is a queer fellow,\" said the School-Master. \"He is full of pretence and hollowness, but he is sometimes almost brilliant.\"  \"What you say is very true,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"I think he has just escaped being a smart man. I wish we could take him in hand, Mr. Pedagog, and make him more of a fellow than he is.\"  Later in the day the Poet met the Idiot on the stairs. \"I say,\" he said, \"I've looked all through Swinburne, and I can't find that poem.\"  \"I know you can't,\" returned the Idiot, \"because it isn't there. Swinburne never wrote it. It was a little thing of my own. I was only trying to get a rise out of Mr. Pedagog and his Reverence with it. You have frequently appeared impressed by the undoubtedly impressive manner of these two gentlemen. I wanted to show you what their opinions were worth.\"  [Illustration: \"I KNOW YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE IT ISN'T THERE\"]  \"Thank you,\" returned the Poet, with a smile. \"Don't you want to go into partnership with me and write for the funny papers? It would be a splendid thing for me--your ideas are so original.\"  \"And I can see fun in everything, too,\" said the Idiot, thoughtfully.  \"Yes,\" returned the Poet. \"Even in my serious poems.\"  Which remark made the Idiot blush a little, but he soon recovered his composure and made a firm friend of the Poet.  The first fruits of the partnership have not yet appeared, however.  As for Messrs. Whitechoker and Pedagog, when they learned how they had been deceived, they were so indignant that they did not speak to the Idiot for a week.     VIII   It was Sunday morning, and Mr. Whitechoker, as was his wont on the first day of the week, appeared at the breakfast table severe as to his mien.  \"Working on Sunday weighs on his mind,\" the Idiot said to the Bibliomaniac, \"but I don't see why it should. The luxury of rest that he allows himself the other six days of the week is surely an atonement for the hours of labor he puts in on Sunday.\"  But it was not this that on Sunday mornings weighed on the mind of the Reverend Mr. Whitechoker. He appeared more serious of visage then because he had begun to think of late that his fellow-boarders lived too much in the present, and ignored almost totally that which might be expected to come. He had been revolving in his mind for several weeks the question as to whether it was or was not"]]]
