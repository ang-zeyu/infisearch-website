The only thing that bothered me was when you appeared to be betraying yourself by alluding to the mate,\" replied Graines.  \"I did not do that by accident; but I desired to get the whole attention of the captain, and I got it. The rest all followed in due course. Now tell all the men to go down to the shore, and wait a little distance from the two boats till you and I join them. Tell them all to be hungry. Your name is Mr. Balker, the mate of the Rattler, the blockade-runner from which we escaped in a whaleboat. My name is Jerry Sandman, the second mate, for the want of a better. Tell them not to forget any of these names,\" continued Christy.  \"They heard the whole story, and they were deeply interested in it, for they could not help seeing what was coming,\" added the engineer, as he went to carry out the order he had just received.  The seamen still kept together in pairs, and Graines instructed them by twos, impressing them with the necessity of remembering the names they had heard in the lieutenant's story, which was a \"story\" in the double sense of the word. As each couple received their lesson, they sauntered in the direction of the shore.  \"What's going to be done, Mr. Graines?\" asked French, who was one of the second pair the engineer instructed.  \"That is none of your business, French. You are to remember the names I have given you, and then obey orders,\" replied Graines rather sharply, for it was a very unusual thing for a seaman, or even an officer, to ask such a question of his superior; and the discipline of the Bellevite was as exacting as it was kind and fatherly.  \"Excuse me, Mr. Graines; I only wanted to be ready for whatever was coming,\" pleaded French.  \"Excused; but don't ask such questions. You listened to the conversation between your officer and the captain of the schooner; and if you cannot comprehend the meaning of it, ask Lines, and he will explain it,\" added the engineer, \"Where are Londall and Vogel?\"  \"Right by that pile of rubbish, sir,\" replied French, as he led the way to the shore.  The last pair were instructed and sent with the others, and they asked no questions. Graines joined the lieutenant, who had seated himself on a log, and reported that all was going on right.  \"As I said before, Charley, you will be the mate of the Rattler, and will no doubt be engaged for the same position on board of the West Wind. I will ship as second mate, if one of the two men now on board of the vessel is not shipped as such, for I wish to be among the men,\" said Christy, after looking about him to see that no one was within hearing distance of them.  \"I take it I shall not make a long voyage as mate,\" replied Graines.  \"Probably not, though I cannot tell how long you will have to serve in that capacity. I purpose to have the Tallahatchie tow the schooner as far down as practicable; but we shall doubtless have business on our hands before it is time to cut the towline. Now we will wait upon the captain.\"  They found him walking up and down the shore, apparently somewhat excited; and doubtless he had not entire confidence in the promises of \"Jerry Sandman.\" The six seamen had not joined Captain Sullendine on the shore, but had placed themselves behind a coal shanty quite near the water.  \"I've brought the mate down, Cap'n Sull'dine,\" Christy began, as he and the engineer halted in front of the master of the schooner. \"Here he is, an' I reckon there ain't no better sailor in the great Confed'racy. This yere is Mr. Balker.\"  \"How are ye, Mr. Balker? You are just the man I want more'n I want my supper. Now tell me something about yourself.\"  Graines invented a story suited to the occasion. Then the conversation was about wages; and the candidate haggled for form's sake, but finally accepted the lay the captain offered.  \"By the way, Captain Sullendine, do you happen to have a second mate?\" asked the engineer when the terms were arranged.  \"I had one; but he run away with Bird Riley. He wa'n't good for nothin', and I'm glad he's gone,\" replied the skipper.  \"The man you talked with is Jerry Sandman, and he was the other mate of the Rattler. He isn't a showy fellow, but he was a first-class second mate,\" continued Graines.  \"Then I ship him as second mate;\" and they arranged the wages without much difficulty.  The six seamen were promptly shipped. The whole party then embarked in the two boats, Captain Sullendine dividing them into two parties for the purpose. The fog had settled down very densely upon the shore; but the West Wind was easily found, and they went on board, where one boat was hoisted up to the stern davits, and the other on the port quarter.  \"Here you be, Mr. Balker,\" said Captain Sullendine when the party reached the quarter-deck; and he was so lively in his movements, and so glib in his speech, as to provoke the suspicion that he had imbibed again at the conclusion of his oration on shore. \"Here, you, Sopsy!\" he continued in a loud voice.  A lantern was burning on the companion, which enabled the party to see that the waist of the vessel was compactly packed with bales of cotton. The schooner seemed to be of considerable size, and Christy thought she must be loaded with a very large cargo of the precious merchandise. In answer to the captain's call, Sopsy, who proved to be the negro cook of the vessel, presented himself.  \"All these people want something to eat, Sopsy. Let the crew eat in the deck-house for'ad, and bring a lunch into the cabin right off,\" continued Captain Sullendine.  \"Yis, sar,\" replied the cook with emphasis. \"Git 'em quicker'n a man kin swaller his own head. Libes dar a man wid soul so dead\"--  \"Never mind the varse, Sopsy,\" interposed the captain.  \"--As never to hisself have said\"--  \"Hurry up, Sopsy!\"  \"He don't say dat, Massa Cap'n,\" added the cook, as he shuffled off over the bales of cotton.  \"Hullo there, Bokes! Where are you, Bokes?\" called the captain again.  \"On deck, Cap'n,\" replied a white man, crawling out from a small opening in the bales.  \"Wake up, Bokes! You ain't dead yet.\"  \"No, sir; wide awake's a coon in a hencoop,\" added the man, who appeared to be one of the two left on board by the deserters, the cook being the other.  \"Be alive, Bokes! Here, wait a minute!\" and the captain ran down the companion ladder to the cabin, from which he presently appeared with a bottle in each hand. \"Do you see them men on the cotton, Bokes?\" he asked, pointing with one of them at the six Belleviters, who stood where they had taken their stations after hoisting up the quarter-boat.  \"I see sunthin over thar,\" replied the seaman, who seemed to be hardly awake yet.  \"Them's the new crew I shipped to-night--six on 'em, or seven with the second mate,\" added the captain. \"Show 'em over to the deck-house, and let 'em pick out their bunks.\"  \"Seven on 'em; the cook and me makes nine, and they ain't but eight berths in the deck-house, Cap'n,\" replied Bokes, who seemed to be afraid of losing his own sleeping quarters.  \"You can sleep on the deck, then. These are all good men, and they must have good berths,\" added the captain. \"You can sleep as well in the scuppers as anywhere else, Bokes; and you ain't more'n half awake any time.\"  \"Must have my berth, Cap'n, or I go ashore,\" persisted the seaman.  \"Small loss anyhow,\" growled the captain.  \"How is the cabin, Captain Sullendine?\" interposed Graines.  \"Two staterooms and four berths,\" replied the master.  \"Then why can't the second mate take one of the berths in the cabin?\" suggested the new mate. \"He is a first-rate fellow, and I reckon he's a better sailor than I am, for he's been to sea about all his life.\"  \"'Tain't reg'lar to have the second mate in the cabin. He'll have t'eat with us if he bunks there,\" argued the master.  \"He'll have to keep his watch on deck when we eat, and I reckon he'll have to take his grub alone,\" reasoned the mate.  \"I'd ruther live in the deck-house with the crew,\" said Christy.  \"But there ain't no room thar,\" added Graines, who thought his superior had made the remark simply to keep up his character.  \"Let him come into the cabin, then,\" said Captain Sullendine, in order to settle the question. \"Now, Bokes, take this apple-jack, and show the other six to the deck-house. Give 'em one or two drinks all round. It'll do 'em good.\"  Bokes obeyed the order, after the master had lighted another lantern for his use, and he went over the bales of cotton to the seamen.  Captain Sullendine remarked with great complacency that he always treated his men well, gave them enough to eat and drink, and he thought the apple-jack he had sent them would do them good. He liked to be liberal with his crew, for he believed a tot of grog would go further with them than \"cussin' 'em;\" and the two mates did not gainsay him, though they believed in neither grog nor \"cussin'.\"  Though Christy never drank a drop of intoxicating fluid under any circumstances, and Graines almost never, both of them believed that \"apple-jack\" had been a very serviceable ally during the night so far. Rut they considered it useful only in the hands of the enemy, and they were sorry to see the bottles sent forward for the use of Belleviters; for they were afraid some of them might muddle and tangle their brains with the fiery liquor.  \"Come, mates, let's go down into the cabin now,\" continued the captain, descending the ladder without waiting for them.  \"I will go forward for a few minutes, Charley,\" whispered Christy in the ear of the engineer, who followed the captain below.  When the lieutenant reached the deck-house he found the men there, with Bokes in the act of taking a long pull at one of the bottles, while French was holding the other.  \"Here's the second mate,\" said the seaman with the bottle.  \"You can keep the bottle you have, Bokes,\" said Christy. \"Now go aft with it.\" The sleepy sailor was willing enough to obey such a welcome"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1868"],["title","Penelope's Postscripts (#0)"],["body","from the 1915 Hodder and Stoughton edition by David Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org                            [Picture: Book cover]                                Penelope’s Postscripts                                       BY                            KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN                                 AUTHOR OF                “PENELOPE’S EXPERIENCES: ENGLAND, IRELAND,”           “TIMOTHY’S QUEST,” “REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM,” ETC.                                  * * * * *                             HODDER AND STOUGHTON                     LONDON      NEW YORK      TORONTO                                   MCMXV                                  * * * * *        _Printed in Great Britain by Hazell_, _Watson & Viney_, _Ld._,                          _London and Aylesbury_.

If you had ever travelled through Europe with a charming spinster who never sat down at a Continental _table d’hôte_ without being asked by an American _vis-à-vis_ whether she were one of the P.’s of Salem, Massachusetts, you would understand why I call my friend Salemina.  She doesn’t mind it.  She knows that I am simply jealous because I came from a vulgarly large tribe that never had any coat-of-arms, and whose ancestors always sealed their letters with their thumb nails.  Whenever Francesca and I call her “Salemina,” she knows, and we know that she knows, that we are seeing a group of noble ancestors in a sort of halo over her serene and dignified head, so she remains unruffled under her _petit nom_, inasmuch as the casual public comprehends nothing of its spurious origin and thinks it was given her by her sponsors in baptism.  Francesca, Salemina, and I have very different backgrounds.  The first-named is an extremely pretty person of large income who is travelling with us simply because her relatives think that she will “see Europe” more advantageously under our chaperonage than if she were accompanied by persons of her own age or “set.”  Salemina is a philanthropist and educator of the first rank, and is collecting all sorts of valuable material to put at the service of her own country when she returns to it, which will not be a moment before her letter of credit is exhausted.  I, too, am quasi-educational, for I had a few years of experience in mothering and teaching little waifs and strays of the streets before I began to paint pictures.  Never shall I regret those nerve-racking, back-breaking, heart-warming, weary, and beautiful years, when, all unconsciously, I was learning to paint children by living with them. Even now the spell still works and it is the curly head, the “shining morning face,” the ready tear, the glancing smile of childhood that enchains me and gives my brush whatever skill it possesses.  We had not been especially high-minded or educational in Switzerland, Salemina and I.  The worm will turn; and there is a point where the improvement of one’s mind seems a farce, and the service of humanity, for the moment, a duty only born of a diseased imagination.  How can one sit on a vine-embowered balcony facing lovely Lake Geneva and think about modern problems,—Improved Tenements, Child Labour, Single Tax, Sweat Shops, and the Right Training of the Rising Civilization? Blue Lake Geneva!—blue as a woman’s eye, blue as the vault of heaven, dropped into the lap of the green earth like a great sparkling sapphire! Mont Blanc you know to be just behind the clouds on the other side, and that presently, after hours or days of patient waiting, he may condescend to unveil himself to your worshipful gaze.  “He is wise in his dignity and reserve,” mused Salemina as we sat on the veranda.  “He is all the more sublime because he withdraws himself from time to time.  In fact, if he didn’t see fit to cover himself occasionally, one could neither eat nor sleep, nor do anything but adore and magnify.”  The day before this interview we had sailed to the end of the sapphire lake and visited the “snow-white battlements” of the Castle of Chillon; seen its “seven pillars of Gothic mould,” and its dungeons deep and old, where poor Bonnivard, Byron’s famous “Prisoner of Chillon,” lay captive for so many years, and where Rousseau fixes the catastrophe of his Héloïse.  We had just been to Coppet too; Coppet where the Neckers lived and Madame de Staël was born and lived during many years of her life.  We had wandered through the shaded walks of the magnificent château garden, and strolled along the terrace where the eloquent Corinne had walked with the Schlegels and other famous _habitués_ of her salon.  We had visited Calvin’s house at 11 Rue des Chanoines, Rousseau’s at No. 40 on the Grande Rue, and Voltaire’s at Ferney.  And so we had been living the past, Salemina and I.  But      “Early one morning,     Just as the day was dawning.”  my slumbering conscience rose in Puritan strength and asserted its rights to a hearing.  “Salemina,” said I, as I walked into her room, “this life that we are leading will not do for me any longer.  I have been too much immersed in ruins.  Last night in writing to a friend in New York I uttered the most disloyal and incendiary statements.  I said that I would rather die than live without ruins of some kind; that America was so new, and crude, and spick and span, that it was obnoxious to any æsthetic soul; that our tendency to erect hideous public buildings and then keep them in repair afterwards would make us the butt of ridicule among future generations. I even proposed the founding of an American Ruin Company, Limited,—in which the stockholders should purchase favourably situated bits of land and erect picturesque ruins thereon.  To be sure, I said, these ruins wouldn’t have any associations at first, but what of that?  We have plenty of poets and romancers; we could manufacture suitable associations and fit them to the premises.  At first, it is true, they might not fire the imagination; but after a few hundred years, in being crooned by mother to infant and handed down by father to son, they would mellow with age, as all legends do, and they would end by being hallowed by rising generations.  I do not say they would be absolutely satisfactory from every standpoint, but I do say that they would be better than nothing.  “However,” I continued, “all this was last night, and I have had a change of heart this morning.  Just on the borderland between sleeping and waking, I had a vision.  I remembered that to-day would be Monday the 1st of September; that all over our beloved land schools would be opening and that your sister pedagogues would be doing your work for you in your absence.  Also I remembered that I am the dishonourable but Honorary President of a Froebel Society of four hundred members, that it meets to-morrow, and that I can’t afford to send them a cable.”  “It is all true,” said Salemina.  “It might have been said more briefly, but it is quite true.”  “Now, my dear, I am only a painter with an occasional excursion into educational fields, but you ought to be gathering stories of knowledge to lay at the feet of the masculine members of your School Board.”  “I ought, indeed!” sighed Salemina.  “Then let us begin!” I urged.  “I want to be good to-day and you must be good with me.  I never can be good alone and neither can you, and you know it.  We will give up the lovely drive in the diligence; the luncheon at the French restaurant and those heavenly little Swiss cakes” (here Salemina was almost unmanned); “the concert on the great organ and all the other frivolous things we had intended; and we will make an educational pilgrimage to Yverdon.  You may not remember, my dear,”—this was said severely because I saw that she meditated rebellion and was going to refuse any programme which didn’t include the Swiss cakes,—“you may not remember that Jean Henri Pestalozzi lived and taught in Yverdon. Your soul is so steeped in illusions; so submerged in the Lethean waters of the past; so emasculated by thrilling legends, paltry titles, and ruined castles, that you forget that Pestalozzi was the father of popular education and the sometime teacher of Froebel, our patron saint.  When you return to your adored Boston, your faithful constituents in that and other suburbs of Salem, Massachusetts, will not ask you if you have seen the Castle of Chillon and the terrace of Corinne, but whether you went to Yverdon.”  Salemina gave one last fond look at the lake and picked up her Baedeker. She searched languidly in the Y’s and presently read in a monotonous, guide-book voice.  “Um—um—um—yes, here it is, ‘Yverdon is sixty-one miles from Geneva, three hours forty minutes, on the way to Neuchâtel and Bâle.’  (Neuchâtel is the cheese place; I’d rather go there and we could take a bag of those Swiss cakes.)  ‘It is on the southern bank of Lake Neuchâtel at the influx of the Orbe or Thiele.  It occupies the site of the Roman town of Ebrodunum.  The castle dates from the twelfth century and was occupied by Pestalozzi as a college.’”  This was at eight, and at nine, leaving Francesca in bed, we were in the station at Geneva.  Finding that we had time to spare, we went across the street and bargained for an _in-transit_ luncheon with one of those dull native shopkeepers who has no idea of American-French.  Your American-French, by the way, succeeds well enough so long as you practise, in the seclusion of your apartment, certain assorted sentences which the phrase-book tells you are likely to be needed.  But so far as my experience goes, it is"]]]
