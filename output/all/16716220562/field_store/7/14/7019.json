He is no good for the hansom I drive, for when folks take a hansom, they want to drive like the wind. But for a four-wheeler that takes families and their luggage, he's the very horse. I bought him cheap and I'll sell him cheap.\"  \"Oh, I don't want him,\" said Diamond's father.  \"Well, come and see him anyway,\" said his friend. So he went.  What was his delight on going into the stable to find that the horse was no other than his own old Diamond! Diamond, grown very thin and bony and long-legged. The horse hearing his master's voice, turned his long neck. And when his old friend went up to him and laid his hand on his side, he whinnied for joy and laid his big head on his master's breast. This settled the matter. Diamond's father put his arms around old Diamond's neck and fairly cried.  The end of it was that Diamond's father bought old Diamond again, together with a four-wheeled cab. As there were some rooms to be had over the stable, he took them, wrote to his wife to come home, and set up as a cabman.  It was late in the afternoon when Diamond and his mother and the baby reached London. His father was waiting for them with his own cab but they had not told Diamond who the horse was. For his father wanted to enjoy the pleasure of his surprise when he found it out. He got in with his mother without looking at the horse and was quite proud of riding home in his father's cab.  When he got to the stables where their rooms were he could not help being a little dismayed at first. But he thought of the song of the river at the back of the north wind and just looked about for things that were pleasant. He said to himself that it was a fine thing that all their old furniture was there. Then he began to search out the advantages of the place.  A thick, dull rain was falling and that was depressing. But the weather would change and there was a good fire burning in the room, which a neighbor had made for them. The tea things were put out and the kettle was boiling on the fire. And with a good fire and tea and bread and butter, things cannot be so _very_ bad.  But Diamond's father and mother were rather miserable and Diamond began to feel a kind of darkness spreading over him. At the same moment, he said, \"This will never do! I can't give in to this. I've been at the back of the north wind. Things go right there and they must be made to go right here!\"  So he said out loud, \"What nice bread and butter this is!\" And when he had eaten it, he began to amuse the baby who was soon shrieking with laughter. His father and mother had to laugh too and things began to look better.  It was indeed a change for them all, not only from Sandwich but from their old place. Instead of the great river where the huge barges with their brown and yellow sails went up and down, their windows now looked out upon a dirty paved yard. There was no garden more for Diamond to run into when he pleased, with gay flowers about his feet, and lofty trees over his head.  Neither was there a wooden wall at the back of his bed with a hole in it for North Wind to come in at when she liked. Indeed, there was such a high wall that North Wind seldom got into the place. And the wall at the head of Diamond's new bed only divided it from the room where a cabman lived who drank too much beer and came home to quarrel with and abuse his wife. It was dreadful for Diamond to hear the scolding and the crying. But he was determined it should not make him miserable for he had been at the back of the north wind.     CHAPTER VI  DIAMOND LEARNS TO DRIVE A HORSE   The wind blew loudly all night long, the first night Diamond slept in his new home, but he did not hear it. My own belief is that when Diamond slept too soundly to remember anything about it in the morning, he had been all night at the back of the north wind. Sometimes something did seem to remain in his mind like the low far-off murmur of the river singing its song. He sometimes tried to hold on to the words it sung. But ever as he came _awaker_--as he would say--one line faded away and then another. At last there was nothing left but the sense that everything went right there and could--and must--be made to go right here.  That was how he awoke that first morning and he jumped up at once saying, \"I've been ill a long time and given a great deal of trouble. Now let's see how I can help my mother.\"  When he went into her room, he found her lighting the fire and his father just getting up. So he took up the baby who was awake too and cared for him till his mother had the breakfast ready. She was looking gloomy and his father too was silent. Diamond felt that in a few minutes, he would be just as miserable. But he tried with all his might to be jolly with the baby and presently his mother just had to smile.  \"Why, Diamond, child!\" she said at last. \"You are as good to your mother as if you were a girl--nursing the baby and toasting the bread, and sweeping up the hearth. I declare a body would think you had been among the fairies.\"  \"I've been at the back of the north wind,\" said Diamond to himself happily.  And now his father was more cheerful too. \"Won't you come out and see the cab, Diamond?\" he asked.  \"Yes, father, in just a minute after I put the baby down.\"  So his father went on ahead. When Diamond got out into the yard, the horse was between the shafts. Diamond went around to look at him. The sight of him made him feel very queer. He could not make it out. What horse was it that looked so familiar? When he came around in front and the old horse put out his long neck and began rubbing against him, Diamond saw it could be no other than old Diamond and he just put his arms around his neck and cried.  \"Isn't it jolly, father!\" he said. \"Was there ever anybody so lucky as we! Dear old Diamond!\" He hugged the horse again and kissed both his big, hairy cheeks. He could only manage one at a time, however--the other cheek was so far off on the other side of old Diamond's big head. And now his father took up the reins to drive off.  \"Oh, father, do let me drive a bit!\" cried Diamond jumping up on the box beside him. His father put the reins into his hands and began to show him how to drive. He let Diamond drive quite a little way and then the boy jumped down and ran gaily back to his mother.  Now it happened that the man who sold old Diamond back to his father, saw how delighted little Diamond was to learn to drive. And that evening, shortly before Diamond's father came home, the man asked Diamond's mother if the boy might not go a little way with him.  \"He cannot go far,\" said his mother, \"for he is not very strong yet.\"  \"I will take him only as far as the square,\" said the man.  Diamond's mother said he might go as far as that. Dancing with delight, Diamond ran to get his cap and in a few minutes was jumping into the cab. The man gave him the reins and showed him how to drive safely through the gate and Diamond got along famously. Just as they were turning into the square, they had an adventure. It was getting quite dusky. A cab was coming rapidly from the other direction, and Diamond pulling aside and the other driver pulling up, they just escaped a collision. And there was his father!  \"Why, Diamond, it is a bad beginning to run into your own father,\" he said.  \"But, father, wouldn't it have been a bad ending for you to run into your own son!\" answered the boy. And both men laughed heartily.  \"He is a good little driver, though,\" said the man. \"He would be fit to drive on his own hook in a week or two. But he had better go back with you now.\"  \"Come along then, Diamond,\" said his father. Diamond jumped across into the other cab and they drove away home.  It was not long before Diamond was a great favorite with all the men about the stables--he was so jolly! It was not the best place in the world for him to be brought up in and at first he did hear a good many rough and bad words. But as he did not like them, he never learned to say them and they did him little harm. Before long, the men grew rather ashamed to use them. One would nudge the other to remind him that the boy was within hearing and the words choked themselves before they got any further.  One day, they gave him a curry comb and brush to try his hand on old Diamond's coat. He used them deftly and thoroughly as far as he could reach.  \"You must make haste and grow,\" the men told him. \"It won't do to clean a horse half way up and leave his back dirty, you know.\"  \"Put me up,\" said Diamond. In a moment he was on the old horse's back with the comb and brush. There he combed and brushed and combed and brushed. Every now and then, old Diamond would whisk his tail and once he sent the comb flying out of the stable door to the great amusement of the men. But they brought it back to him and Diamond finished his task.  \"Oh, dear!\" said Diamond, when he had done. \"I'm so tired!\" And he laid himself down at full length on old Diamond's back. The men were much amused and from that time were always ready to teach him to drive.  So in one way and another, he did learn to drive all sorts of horses, and through the most crowded streets in London city. One day his father took him on his own cab and as they were standing waiting for a passenger, his father left him alone for a few minutes. Hearing a noise, Diamond looked around to see what it was. There was a crossing near the cab-stand where a girl was sweeping. Some young roughs had picked a quarrel with her and were now trying to pull her broom away from her. Diamond was off his box in a moment and running to the help of the girl. The roughs began to act worse than ever. Just then Diamond's father came back and sent them flying. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18614"],["title","At the Back of the North Wind (#7)"],["body","thanked Diamond and began sweeping again as if nothing had happened.  She did not forget her friends, however. A moment after, she came running up with her broom over her shoulder, calling \"Cab, there! Cab!\" And when Diamond's father reached the curbstone, who should it be but Mrs. Coleman and Miss Coleman! Diamond and his father were very happy to see them again and gladly drove them home. When they wanted to pay for it, Diamond's father would not hear of it, but jumped on his box and drove away.  It was a long time since Diamond had seen North Wind or even thought much about her. Now, as his father drove along, he was thinking not about her but about the crossing sweeper. He was wondering what made him feel as if he knew her quite well when he could not remember anything of her. But a picture arose in his mind of a little girl running before the wind, and dragging her broom after her. From that, he recalled the whole adventure of the night when he had gone out with North Wind and made her put him down in a London street.  A few nights after this, Diamond woke up suddenly, believing he heard the north wind thundering along. But it was something quite different. South Wind was moaning around the chimneys, to be sure, for she was not very happy that night. But it was not her voice that had wakened Diamond. It was a loud angry voice, now growling like that of a beast, now raving like that of a madman. It was the voice of the drunken cabman whose room was just through the wall at the back of Diamond's bed.  At length, there came a cry from the woman and a scream from the baby. Diamond thought it was time somebody did something. He jumped up and went to see. The voice of the crying baby guided him to the right door and he peeped in. The drunken cabman had dropped into a chair, his wife lay sobbing on the bed, and the baby was wailing in its cradle.  Diamond's first thought was to run away from the misery of it. But he remembered at once that he had been at the back of the north wind. People who had been there must always try to destroy misery wherever they saw it. But what could he do? Well, there was the baby. He stole in and lifted it into his arms and soon had it on his knee, smiling at the light that came in from the street lamp. He began to sing to it in a low voice--the song of the river as it ran over the soft grass and among the flowers in the country at the back of the north wind. He sang on till the baby went sound asleep. He himself got sleepier and sleepier, though the cabman and his wife only got wider awake all the time. At length, Diamond found himself nodding. He got up and laid the baby gently in its cradle and stole quietly out and home again to his own bed.  \"Wife,\" said the cabman, \"did you see that angel?\"  \"Yes,\" answered his wife, \"it is little Diamond who lives in the next yard.\"  She knew him well enough. She was the neighbor who had the fire lighted and the tea ready for them when Diamond and his mother came home from Sandwich on that rainy, gloomy night. Her husband was somehow very sorry now and ashamed of the misery he had caused--was it the song of the river which Diamond had sung that caused it? He tried hard to forget where the drink shop stood and for a good many weeks managed to keep away from it.  One day when their cab was waiting for a fare, Diamond jumped down to run a little and stretch his legs. He strolled up to the crossing where Nanny and her broom were to be found in all weathers. Just as he was going to speak to her a tall gentleman stepped upon the crossing. He was glad to find it clean and he gave the girl a penny. When she made him a courtesy, he looked at her again and said, \"Where do you live, my child?\"  \"Paradise Row,\" she answered. \"Next door to the Adam and Eve--down the area.\"  \"Whom do you live with?\" he asked.  \"My wicked old granny,\" she replied.  \"You should not call your granny wicked,\" said the gentleman.  \"But she is!\" said Nanny. \"If you don't believe me, you can come and take a look at her.\"  The gentleman looked very grave at hearing her. It was not a nice way for a little girl to talk. He was turning away, when he saw the face of Diamond looking up into his own.  \"Please,\" said Diamond, \"her granny is very cruel to her sometimes--and shuts her out in the streets at night if she happens to be late.\"  \"So, my little man. And what can you do?\" asked the gentleman turning towards him.  \"Drive a cab,\" said Diamond proudly.  \"Anything else?\" asked the gentleman smiling.  \"Take care of the baby,\" said Diamond; \"clean father's boots and make him a bit of toast for his tea.\"  \"You are a useful little man,\" said the gentleman. \"Can you read?\"  \"No, but father and mother can and they are going to teach me soon.\"  \"Well, here is a penny for you, and when you learn to read, come to me and I will give you six-pence and a book with fine pictures in it.\"  He gave Diamond a card with his address on it. \"Thank you,\" said Diamond and put the card into his pocket. The gentleman walked away but he saw Diamond give the penny to Nanny and say, \"I have a father and mother and little brother and you have nothing but a wicked old granny. You may have my penny.\"  The girl put the penny in her pocket and Diamond asked, \"Is she as cruel as ever?\"  \"Just the same. But I get more coppers, so I can buy myself some food. She is so blind that she doesn't see that I do not eat her old scraps. I hide them in my pocket.\"  \"What do you want them for?\"  \"To give to cripple Jim. His leg was broken when he was young, so he isn't good for much. But I love Jim. I always keep something for him.\"  \"Diamond! Diamond!\" called his father, just then.  So Diamond ran back and told him about the gentleman and showed him the card he had given him.  \"Why, it is not many doors from our stables!\" cried his father looking at the address. \"Take care of it, Diamond. One needs all the friends he can get in this world.\"  \"We've got many friends,\" said Diamond. \"Haven't we? There's mother and the baby and old Diamond--and the man next door who drinks--and his wife and baby--and Mrs. Coleman and Miss Coleman--and--and a many!\"  His father just laughed and drove off.  [Illustration: WITHIN A MONTH HE WAS ABLE TO SPELL OUT MOST OF THE VERSES FOR HIMSELF]     CHAPTER VII  DIAMOND DRIVES THE CAB   The question of the tall gentleman as to whether Diamond could read or not, set his father to thinking it was high time he could. As soon as old Diamond was fed and bedded, he began the task of teaching him that very night. It was not much of a task to Diamond for his father took for the lesson book the same one which North Wind had waved the leaves of on the sands at Sandwich. Within a month, he was able to spell out most of the verses for himself. But he never found in it the river song which he thought his mother had read from it. Could it have been North Wind doing the reading in his mother's voice?  It was not long before Diamond managed with many blunders to read all the rhymes in his book to his mother. Then he said, \"In a week or so, I shall be able to go to the tall gentleman and tell him I can read.\" But before the week was out he had another reason for going to the gentleman, whose name he found out was Mr. Raymond. For three days, Nanny had not been at her crossing. Diamond was quite anxious about her, fearing she must be ill. On the fourth day not seeing her yet, he said to his father, \"I want to go and look after Nanny. She can't be well.\"  \"All right,\" said his father. \"Only take care of yourself, Diamond.\"  So Diamond set off to find his way to Nanny's home. It was a long distance and he had to ask his way over and over again. But he kept on without getting discouraged and at last he came to it.  Happily for Diamond, the ugly old granny had gone out. He laid his ear to the door and thought he heard a moaning within. He tried the door and found it was not locked. It was a dreary place indeed--and very dark, for the window was below the level of the street and was covered with mud. And the smell in the room was dreadful!  He could see next to nothing at first but he heard the moaning plainly enough now. Soon he found his friend lying with closed eyes and a white suffering face on a heap of rags in a corner. He went up to her and spoke but she made him no answer. She did not even hear him. Taking out a lump of barley sugar candy he had brought for her he laid it down beside her and hurried away. He was going to find Mr. Raymond and see if he could not do something for Nanny.  It was a long walk to Mr. Raymond's door but he got there at last. Yet after all, the servant was not going to let him in, only Mr. Raymond came out into the hall just then and saw him and recognized him at once.  \"Come in, my little man,\" he said. \"I suppose you have come to claim your six-pence.\"  \"No, sir, not that.\"  \"What! Can't you read yet?\"  \"Yes,\" said Diamond. \"I can now a little. But I've come to tell you about Nanny--the little girl at the crossing.\"  \"Oh, yes, I remember her,\" said Mr. Raymond. \"What is it about Nanny?\"  Diamond told him all about her--how she was sick, and how dark it was where she lived and with bad smells. Now, Mr. Raymond was one of the kindest men in London and was well known at the children's hospital. He hurried there now, and some one went from there at once to find Nanny. Before night, they sent a litter for her and soon the little girl was lying in a nice clean bed, though she was too sick to know anything about it.  Diamond overheard a doctor say to Mr. Raymond, \"How do you suppose the little chap knew what to do about Nanny?\"  \"He doesn't know that I have been at the back of the north wind,\" he said to himself. \"If you have once been there, it just comes to you how to do a little to help.\"  After Nanny had been well seen to, Mr. Raymond took the boy home with him and they soon settled the matter of the six-pence between them.  \"And now, what will you do with it?\" the gentleman asked him.  \"T"]]]
