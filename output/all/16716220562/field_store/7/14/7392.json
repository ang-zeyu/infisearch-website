Instantly Archer's hands were against the door ready to push it up.  \"Wait a minute,\" whispered Tom; \"don't fly off the handle. How do we know who's wandering round? Sh-h! Think I want to run plunk into the Prussian soldier that walked over our heads? Take your time.\"  In his excitement Archer had forgotten that ominous tread above their prison, and he drew back while Tom raised the door to the merest crack and peered cautiously out. The fresh air afforded them infinite relief.  The night was still and clear, the sky thick with stars. Far away a range of black heights was outlined against the sky, and over there the moon was rising. It seemed to be stealthily creeping up out of that battle-scourged plain in France for a glimpse of Alsace. It was from beyond those mountains that had come the portentous rumblings which they had heard.  \"The blue Alsatian mountains,\" murmured Tom. \"I wish we were across them.\"  \"We'll have to go down and around if we everr get therre,\" Archer said.  \"Sh-h-h!\" warned Tom, putting his head out and peering about while Archer held the lid up.  The moonlight, glinting down through the interstices of the trellised vine, made animated shadows in the quiet vineyard, conjuring the wooden supports and knotty masses of vine stalk into lurking human forms. Here some grim figure waited in silence behind an upright, only to dissolve with the changing light. There an ominous helmet seemed to stir amid the thick growth.  The two fugitives, elated at their deliverance, but tremblingly apprehensive, stood hesitating at so radical a move as complete emergence from their hiding place.  \"We can't crawl out of herre in daylight, that's surre,\" whispered Archer. \"D'you think maybe she'll come even now--if we waited?\"  \"It must be long after midnight,\" Tom answered. \"You wait here and hold the door up while I crawl out. Don't move and don't speak. What's that shining over there? See?\"  \"Nothin' but an old waterring can.\"  \"All right--sh-h-h!\"  Cautiously, silently, Tom crept out, peering anxiously in every direction. Stealthily he raised himself. Then suddenly he made a low sound and with a rapidity which startled Archer, dropped to his hands and knees.  \"What's the matterr?\" Archer whispered. \"Come inside--quick!\"  But Tom was engrossed with something on the ground.  \"What is it?\" Archer whispered anxiously. \"His footprints?\"  \"Yop,\" said Tom, less cautiously. \"Come on out. He's standing over there in the field now. Come on out, don't be scared.\"  Archer did not know what to make of it, but he crept out and looked over to the adjacent field where Tom pointed. A kindly, patient cow, one of those they had seen before, was grazing quietly, partaking of a late lunch in the moonlight.  \"Here's her footprint,\" said Tom simply. \"She gave us a good scare, anyway.\"  \"Well--I'll--be----\" Archer began.  \"Sh-h!\" warned Tom. \"We don't know yet why Frenchy's sister don't come. But there weren't any soldiers here--that's one sure thing. We had a lot of worry for nothin'. Come on.\"     CHAPTER VIII  THE HOME FIRE NO LONGER BURNS   \"That's the first time I was everr scarred by a cow,\" said Archer, his buoyant spirit fully revived, \"but when I hearrd those footsteps overr my head, _go-od night_! It's good you happened to think about looking for footprints, hey?\"  \"I didn't _happen_ to,\" said Tom. \"I always do. Same as you never forget to get a souvenir,\" he added soberly.  \"I'd like to get a sooveneerr from that cow, hey? _You_ needn't talk; if it hadn't been for that wire, where'd we be now? Sooveneerrs arre all right. But I admit you've got to have ideas to go with 'em.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Tom.  \"Keep the change,\" said Archer jubilantly. \"Believe me, I don't carre what becomes of me as long as I'm above ground--on terra cotta----\"  \"We've got to get away from here before daylight, so come on,\" interrupted Tom.  \"Are we going up to the house?\"  \"What else can we do?\"  The explanation of those appalling footfalls by no means explained the failure of Florette to keep her promise, and the fugitives started along the path which led to the house.  They walked very cautiously, Tom scrutinizing the earth-covered planking for any sign of recent passing. The door of the stone kitchen stood open, which surprised them, and they stole quietly inside. A lamp stood upon the table, but there was no sign of human presence.  Tom led the way on tiptoe through the passage where they had passed before, and into the main room where another lamp revealed a ghastly sight. The heavy shutters were closed and barred, just as Florette had closed them when she had brought the boys into the room. Upon the floor lay old Pierre, quite dead, with a cruel wound, as from some blunt instrument, upon his forehead. His whitish gray hair, which had made him look so noble and benignant, was stained with his own blood. Blood lay in a pool about his fine old head, and the old coat which he wore had been torn from him, showing the stump of the arm which he had so long ago given to his beloved France.  Near him lay sprawled upon the floor a soldier in a gray uniform, also dead. A little bullet wound in his temple told the tale. Beside him was a black helmet with heavy brass chin gear. Archer picked it up with trembling hands. Across its front was a motto:       \"_Mitt Gott--und Vaterland_.\"  The middle of it was obscured by the flaring German coat-of-arms. A pistol lay midway between the two bodies and part of an old engraved motto was still visible on that. Tom could make out the name Napoleon.  \"What d'you s'pose happened?\" whispered Archer, aghast.  Tom shook his head. \"Come on,\" said he. \"Let's look for the others.\"  Taking the lamp, he led the way silently through the other rooms. On a couch in one of these was laid a soldier's uniform and a loose paper upon the floor showed that it had but lately been unwrapped. There was no sign of Florette or her mother, and Tom felt somewhat relieved at this, for he had feared to find them dead also.  \"What d'you think it means?\" Archer asked again, as they returned to the room of death.  \"I suppose they came for her just like she said,\" Tom answered in a low tone. \"Her father must have shot the soldier, and probably whoever killed the old man took her and her mother away.\"  He looked down at the white, staring face of old Pierre and thought of how the old soldier had risen from his seat and had stood waiting with his fine military air at the moment of his own arrival at the shadowed and stricken home. He remembered how the old man had waited eagerly for his daughter to translate his and Archer's talk and of his humiliation at the shabby hospitality he must offer them. He took the helmet, a grim-looking thing, from the table where Archer had laid it, and read again, \"Mitt Gott----\"  It seemed to Tom that this was all wrong--that God must surely be on the side of old Pierre, no matter what had happened.  \"Do you know what I think?\" he said simply. \"I think it was just the way I said--and like she said. They came to get her and maybe they didn't treat her just right, and her father hit one of them. Or maybe he shot him first off. Anyway, I think that soldier suit must be the one Frenchy had to wear, 'cause he told me that the boys in Alsace had to drill even before they got out of school. I guess she was going to bring it to us so one of us could wear it.... We got to feel sorry for her, that's one sure thing.\"  It was Tom's simple, blunt way of expressing the sympathy which surged up in his heart.  \"I liked her; she treated us fine,\" said Archer.  For a few seconds Tom did not answer; then he said in his old stolid way, \"I don't know where they took her or what they'll make her do, but anybody could see she didn't have any muscle. Whenever I think of her I'll fight harder, that's one sure thing.\"  For a few moments he could hardly command himself as he contemplated this tragic end of the broken home. Florette, whom he had seen but yesterday, had been taken away--away from her home, probably from her beloved Alsace, to enforced labor for the Teuton tyrant. He recalled her slender form as she hurried through the darkness ahead of them, her gentle apology for their poor reception, her wistful memories of her brother as she showed them their hiding-place, her touching grief and apprehension as she stood talking with him under the trellis....  And now she was gone and awful thoughts of her peril and suffering welled up in Tom's mind.  He looked at the stark figure and white, staring face of old Pierre and thought of the impetuous embrace the old man had given him. He thought of his friend, Frenchy. And the mother--where was she? Good people, kind people; trying in the menacing shadow of the detestable Teuton beast to keep their flickering home fire burning. And this was the end of it.  Most of all, he thought of Florette and her wistful, fearful look haunted him. \"_Maybe for ze great Krupps_\"--the phrase lingered in his mind and he stood there appalled at the realization of this awful, unexplained thing which had happened.  Then Tom Slade did something which his scout training had taught him to do, while Archer, tremulous and unstrung, stood awkwardly by, watching. He knelt down over the lifeless form of the old man and straightened the prostrate figure so that it lay becomingly and decently upon the hard floor. He bent the one arm and laid it across the breast in the usual posture of dignity and peace. He took the threadbare covering from the old melodeon and placed it over the face. So that the last service for old Pierre Leteur was performed by an American boy; and at least the ashes of the home fire were left in order by a scout from far across the seas.  \"It's part of first aid,\" explained Tom quietly, as he rose; \"I learned how at Temple Camp.\"  Archer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18954"],["title","Tom Slade with the Boys Over There (#6)"],["body","nothing.  \"When a scout from Maryland died up there, I saw how they did it.\"  \"You got to thank the scouts for a lot,\" said Archer; \"forr trackin' an' trailin'----\"  \"'Tain't on account of them,\" said Tom, his voice breaking a little, \"it's on account of her----\"  And he kneeled again to arrange the corner of the cloth more neatly over the wrinkled, wounded face....     CHAPTER IX  FLIGHT   \"Anyway, we've got to get away from here quick,\" said Tom, pulling himself together; \"never mind about clothes or anything. One thing sure, they'll be back here soon. See if he has a watch,\" he added, indicating the dead soldier.  \"No, but he's got a little compass around his neck; shall I take it?\"  \"Sure, we got a right to capture anything from the enemy.\"  \"He's got some papers, too.\"  \"All right, take 'em. Come on out through the kitchen way--hurry up. Don't make any noise. You look for some food--I'll be with you right away.\"  Tom crept cautiously out to the road and, kneeling, placed his ear to the ground. There was no sound, and he hurried back to the stone kitchen where Archer was stuffing his pockets with such dry edibles as he could gather.  \"All right, come on,\" he whispered hurriedly. \"What have you got?\"  \"Some hard bread and a couple of salt fish----\"  \"Give me one of those,\" Tom interrupted: \"and hand me that tablecloth. Come on. Got some matches?\"  \"Yes, and a candle, too.\"  \"Good. Don't strike a light. You go ahead, along the plank walk.\"  Leaving the scene of the tragedy, they hurried along the board walk under the trellis, Tom dragging the tablecloth so that it swept both of the narrow planks and obliterated any suggestion of footprints. When they had gone about fifty yards he stooped and flung the salt fish from him so that it barely skimmed the earth and rested at some distance from the path.  \"If they should have any dogs with 'em, that'll take 'em off the trail,\" he said.  \"I'm sorry I didn't get you a souveneerr too,\" said Archer, as they hurried along.  This was the first intimation Tom had that Archer regarded the little compass merely as a souvenir.  \"You can give me those papers you took,\" he said, half in joke.  \"It's only an envelope,\" Archer said. \"Have you got your button all right?\"  \"Sure.\"  When they reached the wine vat, Tom threw the old tablecloth into it, and pulled the vine more carefully so as to conceal the door. They were tempted to rest here, but realized that if they spent the balance of the night in their former refuge it would mean another long day in the dank hole.  The vineyard ended a few yards from the wine vat and beyond was an area of open lowlands across which the boys could see a range of low wooded hills.  \"We've got about four hours till daylight,\" said Tom; \"let's make for those woods.\"  \"That's east,\" said Archer. \"_We_ want to go south.\"  \"We want to see where we're going before we go anywhere,\" Tom answered. \"If we can get into the woods on those hills, we can climb a tree tomorrow and see where we're at. What I want is a bird's-eye squint to start off with, 'cause we can't ask questions of anybody.\"  \"No, and believe me, we don't want to run into any cities,\" said Archer. \"We got through one night anyway, hey?\"  Notwithstanding that they were without shelter, and facing the innumerable perils of a hostile country about which they knew nothing, they still found action preferable to inaction and their spirits rose as they journeyed on with the star-studded sky overhead.  They found the meadows low and marshy, which gratified Tom who was always fearful of leaving footprints. The hills beyond were low and thickly wooded, the face of the nearest being broken by slides and forming almost a precipice surmounted by a jumble of rocks and underbrush. The country seemed wild and isolated enough.  \"I suppose it's the beginning of the Alps, maybe,\" Tom panted as they scrambled up.  \"There's nobody up here, that's surre,\" Archer answered.  \"We'll just lie low till daylight and see if we can get a squint at the country. Then tomorrow night we'll hike it south. If we go straight south we've _got_ to come to Switzerland.\"  \"It's lucky we've got the compass,\" said Archer.  \"Maybe this is a ridge we're on,\" Tom said. \"If it is, we're in luck. We may be able to go thirty or forty miles along it. One thing sure, it'll be more hilly the farther south we get 'cause we'll be getting into the beginning of the Alps. There ought to be water up here.\"  \"I wish there were some apples,\" said Archer.  \"You're always thinking about apples and souvenirs. Let's crawl in under here.\"  They had scrambled to the top of the precipitous ascent and found themselves upon the broken edge of the forest amid a black chaos of piled up rock and underbrush. Evidently, the land here was giving way, little by little, for here and there they could see a tree canting tipsily over the edge, its network of half-exposed roots making a last gallant stand against the erosive process and helping to hold the weight of the great boulders which ere long would crash down into the marshy lowlands.  They crept into a sort of leafy cave formed by a fallen tree and stretched their weary bodies and relaxed their tense nerves after what had seemed a nightmare.  \"As long as we're going to join the army,\" said Tom, \"we might as well make a rule now. We won't both sleep at the same time till we're out of Germany. We got to live up to that rule no matter how tired we get.\"  \"I'm game,\" said Archer. \"You go to sleep now and when I get good and sleepy I'll wake you up.\"  \"In about two hours,\" said Tom. \"Then you can sleep till it's light. Then we'll see if it's safe to stay here. Keep looking in that direction--the way we came. And if you see any lights, wake me up.\"  Archer did not obey these directions at all, for he sat with his hands clasped over his knees, gazing down across the dark marshland below. Two hours, three hours, four hours, he sat there and scarcely stirred. And as the time dragged on and there were no lights and no sounds he took fresh courage and hope. He was beginning to realize the value of the stolid determination, the resourcefulness, the keen eye and stealthy foot and clear brain of the comrade who lay sleeping at his side. He had wanted to tell Tom Slade what he thought of him and how he trusted him, but he did not know how. So he just sat there, hour in and hour out, and let the weary pathfinder of Temple Camp sleep until he awoke of his own accord.  \"All right,\" said Archer then, blinking. \"Nothing happened.\"     CHAPTER X  THE SOLDIER'S PAPERS   All that day they stayed in their leafy refuge. They could look down across the marshy meadows they had crossed to the trellised vineyard of the Leteurs, looking orderly and symmetrical in the distance like a two-storied field, and beyond that the massive gables of the gray, forsaken house.  They could see the whole neighboring country in panorama. Other houses were discernible at infrequent intervals along the road which wound southward through the lowland between the hills where the boys were and the Vosges Mountains (the \"Blue Alsatian Mountains\") to the west. Through the long, daylight hours Tom studied the country carefully. Now, as never before (for he knew how much depended on it), he watched for every scrap of knowledge which might afford any inference or deduction to help them in their flight.  \"You can see how it is,\" he told Archer, as they watched the little compass needle, waiting for it to settle. \"This is a ridge and it runs north and south. I kind of think it's the west side of the valley of a river, like Daggett's Hills are to Perch River up your way.\"  \"I'd like to be therre now,\" said Archer.  \"I'd rather be in France,\" Tom answered.  \"Of course it'll fizzle out in places and we'll come to villages, but there's enough woods ahead of us for us to go twenty miles tonight. That's the way it seems to me, anyway.\"  Once Tom ventured out on hands and knees into the woods in quest of water, and returned with the good news that he had had a refreshing drink from a brook to which he directed Archer.  \"Do you know what this is?\" he said, emptying an armful of weeds on the ground. \"It's chicory. If I dared to build a fire I could make you a good imitation of coffee with that. But we can eat the roots, anyway. Now I remember it used to be in the geography in school about so much chicory growing in the Alps----\"  \"Oh, Ebeneezerr!\" shouted Archer, much to Tom's alarm. \"I'm glad you said that 'cause it reminds me about the mussels.\"  \"The _what_?\"  \"'The mountain streams abound with the pearrl-bearing mussels which are a staple article of diet with the Alpine natives,'\" quoted Archer in declamatory style. \"I had to write that two hundred and fifty times f'rr whittlin' a hole in the desk----\"  \"I s'pose you were after a souvenir,\" said Tom dryly.  \"Firrst I wrote it once 'n' then I put two hundred and forty-nine ditto marrks. _Ebenezerr!_ Wasn't the teacherr mad! I had to write it two hundred and fifty times f'rr vandalism and two hundred and fifty morre f'rr insolence.\"  \"Served you right,\" said Tom.  \"Oh, I guess you weren't such an angel in school either!\" said Archer. \"I'll never forget about those pearrl-bearing mussels as long as I live--you can bet!\"  Tom separated the chicory roots from the stalks and Archer went to wash them in the stream. In a little while he returned with a triumphant smile all over his round, freckled face and half a dozen mussels in his cupped hands.  \"_Now_ what have you got to say, huh? It's good I whittled that desk and was insolent--you can bet!\"  Tom's practical mind did not quite appreciate this line of reasoning, but he was glad enough to see the mussels, the very look of which was cool and refreshing.  \"I always said I had no use for geographies except to put mustaches and things on the North Pole explorers and high hats on Columbus and Henry Hudson, but, believe _me_, I'm glad I remembered about those pearrl-bearing"]]]
