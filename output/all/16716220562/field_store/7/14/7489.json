No, he had never been there before, he said.  He had a measure of Anita's earnest na√Øve personality. Or was he a very clever scoundrel, with irony lurking in his soft voice, and a chuckle that could so befool me?  \"Well talk again, Haljan. You interest me--I've enjoyed it.\"  He sauntered away from me, joining the saturnine Ob Hahn, with whom presently I heard him discussing religion.  The arrest of Johnson had caused considerable discussion among the passengers. A few had seen me drag him forward to the cage. The incident had been the subject of discussion all afternoon. Captain Carter had posted a notice to the effect that Johnson's accounts had been found in serious error, and that Dr. Frank for this voyage would act in his stead.         *       *       *       *       *  It was near midnight when Snap and I closed and sealed the radio room and started for the chart room, where we were to meet with Captain Carter and the other officers. The passengers had nearly all retired. A game was in progress in the smoking room, but the deck was almost deserted.  Snap and I were passing along one of the interior corridors. The stateroom doors were all closed. The metal grid of the floor echoed our footsteps. Snap was in advance of me. His body suddenly rose in the air. He went like a balloon to the ceiling, struck it gently, and all in a heap came floating down and landed on the floor!  \"What in the infernal--\"  He was laughing as he picked himself up. But it was a brief laugh. We knew what had happened: the artificial gravity controls in the base of the ship, which by magnetic force gave us normality aboard, were being tampered with! For just this instant, this particular small section of this corridor had been cut off. The slight bulk of the _Planetara_, floating in space, had no appreciable gravity pull on Snap's body, and the impulse of his step as he came to the unmagnetized area of the corridor had thrown him to the ceiling. The area was normal now. Snap and I tested it gingerly.  He gripped me. \"That never went wrong by accident, Gregg! Someone--\"  We rushed to the nearest descending ladder. In the deserted lower room the bank of dials stood neglected. A score of dials and switches were here, governing the magnetism of different areas of the ship. There should have been a night operator, but he was gone.  Than we saw him lying nearby, sprawled, face down on the floor! In the silence and dim, lurid glow of the fluorescent tubes, we stood holding our breaths, peering and listening. No one here.  The guard was not dead. He lay unconscious from a blow on the head. A brawny fellow. We had him revived in a few moments. A broadcast flash of the call buzz brought Dr. Frank from the chart room.  \"What's the matter?\"  \"Someone was here,\" I said hastily, \"experimenting with the magnetic switches. Evidently unfamiliar with them--pulling one or another to test their workings and so see their reactions on the dials.\"  We told him what had happened to Snap in the corridor; the guard here was no worse off for the episode, save a lump on the head by an invisible assailant. We left him nursing his head, sitting belligerent at his post, alert to any danger and armed now with my heat-ray cylinder.  \"Strange doings this voyage,\" he told us. \"All the crew knows it. I'll stick it out now, but when we get back home I'm done with this star travelin'. I belong on the sea anyway.\"  We hurried back to the upper level. We would indeed have to plan something at this chart room conference. This was the first tangible attack our adversaries had made.  We were on the passenger deck headed for the chart room when all three of us stopped short, frozen with horror. Through the silent passenger quarters a scream rang out! A girl's shuddering, gasping scream. Terror in it. Horror. Or a scream of agony. In the silence of the dully vibrating ship it was utterly horrible.... It lasted an instant--a single long scream; then was abruptly stilled.  And with blood pounding my temples and rushing like ice through my veins, I recognized it.  Anita!     IX   \"Good God, what was that?\" Dr. Frank's face had gone white. Snap stood like a statue of horror.  The deck here was patched as always, with silver radiance from the deck ports. The empty deck chairs stood about. The scream was stilled, but now we heard a commotion inside--the rasp of opening cabin doors; questions from frightened passengers.  I found my voice. \"Anita! Anita Prince!\"  \"Come on!\" shouted Snap. \"In her stateroom, A22!\" He was dashing for the lounge archway.  Dr. Frank and I followed. I realized that we passed the deck door and window of A22. But they were dark, and evidently sealed on the inside. The dim lounge was in a turmoil; passengers standing at their cabin doors.  I shouted, \"Go back to your rooms! We want order here--keep back!\"  We came to the twin doors of A22 and A20. Both were closed. Dr. Frank was in advance of Snap and me now. He paused at the sound of Captain Carter's voice behind us.  \"Was it from in there? Wait a moment!\"  Carter dashed up. He had a large heat-ray projector in his hand. He shoved us aside. \"Let me in first. Is the door sealed? Gregg, keep those passengers back!\"  The door was not sealed. Carter burst into the room. I heard him gasp, \"Good God!\"  Snap and I shoved back three or four passengers. And in that instant Dr. Frank had been in the room and out again.  \"There's been an accident! Get back, Gregg! Snap, help me keep the crowd away.\" He shoved me forcibly.  From within, Carter was shouting, \"Keep them out! Where are you, Frank? Come back here! Send a flash for Balch!\"  Dr. Frank went back into the room and banged the cabin door upon Snap and me. I was unarmed. Weapon in hand, Snap forced the panic-stricken passengers back to their rooms.  Snap reassured them glibly; but he knew no more about the facts than I. Moa, with a nightrobe drawn tight around her thin, tall figure, edged up to me.  \"What has happened, _Set_ Haljan?\"  I gazed around for her brother Miko, but did not see him.  \"An accident,\" I said shortly. \"Go back to your room. Captain's orders.\"  She eyed me and then retreated. Snap was threatening everybody with his cylinder. Balch dashed up. \"What in hell! Where is Carter?\"  \"In there.\" I pounded on A22. It opened cautiously. I could see only Carter, but I heard the murmuring voice of Dr. Frank through the interior connecting door to A20.  The Captain rasped, \"Get out, Haljan! Oh, is that you, Balch? Come in.\" He admitted the older officer and slammed the door upon me again. And immediately reopened it.  \"Gregg, keep the passengers quieted. Tell them everything's all right. Miss Prince got frightened--that's all. Then go to the turret. Tell Blackstone what's happened.\"  \"But I don't know what's happened.\"  Carter was grim and white. He whispered, \"I think it may turn out to be murder, Gregg! No, not dead yet.... Dr. Frank is trying ... don't stand there like an ass, man. Get to the turret! Verify our trajectory--no--wait....\"  The Captain was almost incoherent. \"Wait a minute. I don't mean that! Tell Snap to watch his radio room. Arm yourselves and guard our weapons.\"  I stammered, \"If ... if she dies ... will you flash us word?\"  He stared at me strangely. \"I'll be there presently, Gregg.\"  He slammed the door upon me.  I followed his orders but it was like a dream of horror. The turmoil of the ship gradually quieted. Snap went to the radio room; Blackstone and I sat in the tiny chart room; how much time passed, I do not know. I was confused. Anita hurt! She might die ... murdered.... But why? By whom? Had George Prince been in his own room when the attack came? I thought now I recalled hearing the low murmur of his voice in there with Dr. Frank.  Where was Miko? It stabbed at me. I had not seen him among the passengers in the lounge.  Carter came into the chart room. \"Gregg, you get to bed. You look like a ghost.\"  \"But--\"  \"She's not dead. She may live. Dr. Frank and her brother are with her. They're doing all they can.\" He told us what had happened. Anita and George Prince had both been asleep, each in his respective room. Someone unknown had opened Anita's corridor door.  \"Wasn't it sealed?\"  \"Yes. But the intruder opened it.\"  \"Burst it? I didn't think it was broken.\"  \"It wasn't broken. The assailant opened it somehow, and assaulted Miss Prince--shot her in the chest with a heat ray. Her left lung.\"  \"Shot her?\"  \"Yes. But she did not see who did it. Nor did Prince. Her scream awakened him, but the intruder evidently fled out the corridor door of A22, the way he entered.\"  I stood weak and shaken at the chart room entrance. Anita--dying, perhaps; and all my dreams were fading into a memory of what might have been.  I was glad enough to get away. I would lie down for an hour and then go to Anita's stateroom. I'd demand that Dr. Frank let me see her.  I went to the stern deck where my cubby was located. My mind was confused but some instinct within me made me verify the seals of my door and window. They were intact. I entered cautiously, switched on the dimmer of the tube lights, and searched the room. It had only a bunk, my tiny desk, a chair and clothes robe. There was no evidence of any intruder here. I set my door and window alarm. Then I audiphoned to the radio room.  \"Snap?\"  \"Yes.\"  I told him about Anita. Carter cut in on us from the chart room. \"Stop that, you fools!\"  We cut off. Fully dressed, I flung myself on my bed. Anita might die....  I must have fallen into a tortured sleep, I was awakened by the sound of my alarm buzzer. Someone was tampering with my door! Then the buzzer ceased; the marauder outside must have found a way of silencing it. But it had done its work--awakened me.  I had switched off the light; my cubby was Stygian black. A heat cylinder was in the bunk-bracket over my head. I searched for it, pried it loose softly.  I was fully awake. Alert."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19066"],["title","Brigands of the Moon (#8)"],["body"," could hear a faint sizzling--someone outside trying to unseal the door. In the darkness, cylinder in hand, I crept softly from the bunk. Crouched at the door. This time I would capture or kill this night prowler.  The sizzling was faintly audible. My door seal was breaking. Upon impulse I reached for the door, jerked it open.  No one there! The starlit segment of deck was empty. But I leaped and struck a solid body, crouching in the doorway. A giant man. Miko!  His electronized metallic robe burned my hands. I lunged against him--I was almost as surprised as he. I shot, but the stab of heat evidently missed him. The shock of my encounter, short-circuited his robe; he materialized in the starlight. A brief, savage encounter. He struck the weapon from my hand. He had dropped his hydrogen torch, and tried to grip me. But I twisted away from his hold.  \"So it's you!\"  \"Quiet, Gregg Haljan! I only want to talk.\"  Without warning, a stab of radiance shot from a weapon in his hand. It caught me. Ran like ice through my veins. Seized and numbed my limbs.  I fell helpless to the deck. Nerves and muscles paralyzed. My tongue was thick and inert. I could not speak, nor move. But I could see Miko bending over me, and hear him:  \"I don't want to kill you, Haljan. We need you.\"  He gathered me up like a bundle in his huge arms; carried me swiftly across the deserted deck.  Snap's radio room in the network under the dome was diagonally overhead. A white actinic light shot from it--caught us, bathed us. Snap had been awake; had heard the commotion of our encounter.  His voice rang shrilly: \"Stop! I'll shoot!\" His warning siren rang out to alert the ship. His spotlight clung to us.  Miko ran with me a few steps. Then he cursed and dropped me; fled away. I fell like a sack of carbide to the deck. My senses faded into blackness....  \"He's all right now.\"  I was in the chart room with Captain Carter, Snap and Dr. Frank bending over me. The surgeon said,  \"Can you speak now, Gregg?\"  I tried it. My tongue was thick, but it moved. \"Yes.\" I was soon revived. I sat up, with Dr. Frank vigorously rubbing me.  \"I'm all right.\" I told them what had happened.  Captain Carter said, \"Yes, we know that. And it was Miko also who killed Anita Prince. She told us before she died.\"  \"Died!...\" I leaped to my feet. \"She ... died....\"  \"Yes, Gregg. An hour ago. Miko got into her stateroom and tried to force his love upon her. She repulsed him. He killed her....\"  It struck me blank. And then with a rush came the thought, \"He says Miko killed her\"....  I heard myself stammering, \"Why--why we must get him!\" I gathered my wits; a surge of hate swept me; a wild desire for vengeance.  \"Why, by God, where is he? Why don't you go get him? I'll get him--I'll kill him!\"  \"Easy, Gregg!\" Dr. Frank gripped me.  The Captain said gently. \"We know how you feel, Gregg. She told us before she died.\"  \"I'll bring him in here to you! But I'll kill him, I tell you!\"  \"No you won't, lad. We don't want him killed, not attacked, even. Not yet. We'll explain later.\"  They sat me down, calming me....  Anita dead. The door of the shining garden was closed. A brief glimpse given to me and to her of what might have been. And now she was dead....     X   I had not been able at first to understand why Captain Carter wanted Miko left at liberty. Within me there was that cry of vengeance, as though to strike Miko down would somehow lessen my own grief. Whatever Carter's purpose, Snap had not known it. But Balch and Dr. Frank were in the Captain's confidence--all three of them working on some plan of action.  It was obvious that at least two of our passengers were plotting with Miko and George Prince; trying on this voyage to learn what they could about Grantline's activities on the Moon--scheming doubtless to seize the treasure when the _Planetara_ stopped at the Moon on the return voyage. I thought I could name those masquerading passengers. Ob Hahn, supposedly a Venus mystic. And Rance Rankin, who called himself an American magician. Those two, Snap and I agreed, seemed most suspicious. And there was the purser.  I sat for a time on the deck outside the chart room with Snap. Then Carter summoned us back, and we sat listening while he, Balch and Dr. Frank went on with their conference. Listening to them, I could not but agree that our best plan was to secure evidence which would incriminate all who were concerned in the plot. Miko, we were convinced, had been the Martian who followed Snap and me from Halsey's office in Greater New York. George Prince had doubtless been the invisible eavesdropper outside the radio room. He knew, and had told the others that Grantline had found that priceless metal on the Moon and that the _Planetara_ would stop there on the way home.  But we could not incarcerate George Prince for being an eavesdropper. Nor had we the faintest possible evidence against Ob Hahn or Rankin. And even the purser would probably be released by the Interplanetary Court of Ferrok-Shahn when it heard our evidence.  There was only Miko. We could arrest him for the murder of Anita. But if we did that now, the others would be put on their guard. It was Carter's idea to let Miko remain at liberty for a time and see if we could identify and incriminate his fellows. The murder of Anita obviously had nothing to do with any plot against Grantline Moon treasure.  \"Why,\" exclaimed Balch, \"there might be--probably are--huge Martian interests concerned in this thing. These men aboard are only emissaries, making this voyage to learn what they can. When they get to Ferrok-Shahn, they'll make their report, and then we'll have a real danger on our hands. Why, an outlaw ship could be launched from Ferrok-Shahn that would beat us back to the Moon--and Grantline is entirely without warning of any danger!\"  It seemed obvious. Unscrupulous criminals in Ferrok-Shahn would be dangerous indeed, once these details of Grantline were given them. So now it was decided that in the remaining nine days of our outward voyage, we would attempt to secure enough evidence to arrest all these plotters.  \"I'll have them all in the cage when we land,\" declared Carter grimly. \"They'll make no report to their principals!\"  Ah, the futile plans of men!  Yet, at the time, we thought it practical. We were all doubly armed now. Bullet projectors and heat ray cylinders. And we had several eavesdropping microphones which we planned to use whenever occasion offered.  Only twenty-eight hours of this eventful voyage had passed. The _Planetara_ was some six million miles from the Earth; it blazed behind us, a tremendous giant.  The body of Anita was being made ready for burial. George Prince was still in his stateroom. Glutz, effeminate little hairdresser, who waxed rich acting as beauty doctor for the women passengers, and who, in his youth, had been an undertaker, had gone with Dr. Frank to prepare the body.  Gruesome details. I tried not to think of them. I sat, numbed, in the chart room.  An astronomical burial--there was little precedent for it. I dragged myself to the stern deck where, at five A.M., the ceremony took place.  We were a solemn little group, gathered there in the checkered starlight with the great vault of the heavens around us. A dismantled electronic projector--necessary when a long range gun was mounted--had been rigged up in one of the deck ports.  They brought out the body. I stood apart, gazing reluctantly at the small bundle, wrapped like a mummy in a dark metallic screen-cloth. A patch of black silk rested over her face. Four cabin stewards carried her; and beside her walked George Prince. A long black robe covered him, but his head was bare. And suddenly he reminded me of the ancient play-character of Hamlet. His black, wavy hair; his finely chiseled, pallid face, set now in a stern patrician cast. And staring, I realized that however much of the villain this man might be, at this instant, walking beside the body of his dead sister, he was stricken with grief. He loved that sister with whom he had lived since childhood; and to see him now no one could doubt it.  The little procession stopped in a patch of starlight by the port. They rested the body on a bank of chairs. The black-robed chaplain, roused from his bed and still trembling from excitement of this sudden, inexplicable death on board, said a brief, solemn little prayer. An appeal: That the Almighty Ruler of all these blazing worlds might guard the soul of this gentle girl whose mortal remains were now to be returned to Him.  Ah, if ever God seemed hovering close, it was now at this instant, on this starlit deck floating in the black void of space.  Then Carter for just a moment removed the black shroud from her face. I saw her brother gaze silently; saw him stoop and implant a kiss--and turn away. I did not want to look, but I found myself moving slowly forward.  She lay, so beautiful. Her face, white and calm and peaceful in death. My sight blurred.  \"Easy Gregg,\" Snap was whispering to me. He had his arm around me. \"Come on away.\"  They tied the shroud over her face. I did not see them as they put the body in the tube, sent it through the exhaust chamber and dropped it.  But a moment later I saw it, a small black, oblong bundle hovering beside us. It was perhaps a hundred feet away, circling us. Held by the _Planetara's_ bulk, it had momentarily become our satellite. It swung around us like a moon. Gruesome satellite, by nature's laws forever to follow us.  Then from another tube at the bow, Blackstone operated a small zed-co-ray projector. Its dull light caught the floating bundle, neutralizing its metallic wrappings.  It swung off at a tangent. Speeding. Falling free in the dome of the heavens. A rotating black oblong. But in a moment distance dwindled it to a speck. A dull silver dot with the sunlight on it. A speck of human Earth dust, falling free....  It vanished. Anita--gone.     XI   I turned from the deck. Miko was near"]]]
