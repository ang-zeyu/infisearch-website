I asked you what you were _doing_.\"  \"I'm not doing anything just now,\" Dickie Deer Mouse faltered.  \"Yes, you are!\" Mr. Crow corrected him. \"You're sitting on a limb of my tree.... Get off it at once!\"  So Dickie Deer Mouse moved to a more distant perch.  \"Now you're sitting on another!\" Mr. Crow exploded. \"Get out of my tree this instant!\" It always made him ill-tempered to be awakened from a sound sleep in the middle of the night.  Once more Dickie Deer Mouse asked his pardon.  \"I was told,\" he explained, \"that you had moved lately. And I did not expect to find you here.\"  \"Ah!\" said Mr. Crow. \"I know now why you came sneaking into my house. You'd like to live here yourself.\"  \"Pardon me!\" Dickie Deer Mouse exclaimed with the lowest of bows. \"You are mistaken, Mr. Crow. Though your house is a fine, large one, it's much too small to hold us both.\"  And whisking about, while Mr. Crow stared at him, he ran down the tall elm as fast as he could go.  It was clear that if Mr. Crow wasn't going to move he would have to look elsewhere for a summer home.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  IV  THE BLACKBIRD'S NEST   For a few days after his visit to Mr. Crow's elm, Dickie Deer Mouse kept watch carefully of Mr. Crow's comings and goings. And he decided at last that the old gentleman liked his home too well to leave it.  But Dickie was not discouraged. He had no doubt that he could find some other pleasant quarters in which to spend the summer--quarters that would prove almost as airy, and perhaps more convenient--because they were not so high.  For there was no denying that Mr. Crow's nest was a long, long way from the ground.  So Dickie began to search for birds' nests. And for a time he had to suffer a great deal of scolding by his feathered neighbors. It must be confessed that they were none too fond of Dickie Deer Mouse. There was a story of something he was said to have done one time--a tale about his having driven a Robin family away from their nest, in order to live in it himself.  That seems a strange deed on the part of anyone so gentle as Dickie Deer Mouse. But old Mr. Crow always declared that it was true. And Solomon Owl often remarked that he wished Dickie Deer Mouse would try to drive _him_ away from his home in the hollow hemlock.  [Illustration: Dickie scampered through the woods with his friends]  But during his hunt for birds' nests Dickie Deer Mouse was careful to keep away from Solomon Owl, and his cousin Simon Screecher, and all the rest of the Owl family. He contented himself with hasty peeps into nests built by such smaller folk as Blackbirds and Robins. And if it happened that anybody was living in one of those nests, Dickie soon found it out. For the angry owners were sure to fly at him with screams of rage, and peck at his head as they darted past him.  It was really not worth while getting into a fight over a bird's nest, when there was plenty of old ones in which nobody dwelt. To be sure, many of them were almost ready to fall apart. But Dickie Deer Mouse finally found one to his liking--a last year's bird's nest where two Blackbirds had reared a promising family. They had not come back to Pleasant Valley. And there was their house, almost as good as new, just waiting for some one to move in and make himself at home.  Nobody objected when Dickie took the old nest for his home, though many a bird in the neighborhood remarked in his hearing that _he_ would hate to be too lazy to build a house for himself.  Dickie Deer Mouse was too mild and gentle-mannered to make any reply to such rude speeches. Besides, he expected to make a good many changes in the old nest before the place was exactly what he wanted.  \"I don't understand,\" he said aloud to nobody in particular, \"why most birds don't know how a house should be built. Of all the birds in Pleasant Valley the only good nest-builder I know is Long Bill Wren. He must be a very sensible fellow, because he puts a roof on his house.\"  Now, Dickie Deer Mouse may--or may not--have known that some of his bird neighbors were near at hand, watching him. Certainly they must have heard what he said, for they began to scold at the top of their voices. And one rude listener named Jasper Jay screamed with fine scorn:  \"What do you know about building a nest?\" And then he laughed harshly.  But Dickie Deer Mouse only looked very wise and said nothing.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  V  DICKIE'S SUMMER HOME   Dickie Deer Mouse was busier than ever. When he wasn't looking for food--and eating it when he had found it--he gathered cat-tail down in Cedar Swamp.  If there was one thing that he liked in a house it was a soft bed. And he knew that if the weather happened to be chilly now and then, he could snuggle into the cat-tail down and sleep as comfortably as he pleased.  The swamp was none too near his new home; and he might have found moss or shreds of bark near-by that would have served his purpose. But he would rather have cat-tail down, even though he had to make a good many trips back and forth before he finally lined the old bird's nest to his liking.  Then, having finished his bed, he had to make a roof over it. So he covered the top of his house with moss, leaving a hole right under the eaves, for a doorway.  When Dickie's home was done he was so pleased with it that he asked all his neighbors if they didn't like his \"improvements,\" as he called the additions he had made. And all his Deer Mouse relations told him that he certainly had a fine place.  But none of the birds cared for it at all, except Long Bill Wren; and even he remarked that the house would be better \"if it was rounder.\"  As for Jasper Jay, he told Dickie Deer Mouse that, in his opinion, the house was ruined.  \"It's nothing but a trap,\" he declared. \"And I'd hate to go to sleep inside it.\"  His views, however, did not trouble Dickie Deer Mouse in the least. The place suited him. And he was so happy in it that sometimes when the weather was bad and he wasn't whisking about in the trees, or scurrying around on the ground, he would stay inside his cozy home, with only his head sticking out through the doorway, while his big, bright, bulging, black eyes took in everything that happened in his dooryard.  Dickie Deer Mouse knew that one needed sharp eyes to spy him when he was peeping from his house in that fashion. And often when somebody of whom he was really afraid came wandering through the woods, Dickie would keep quite still, while he watched the newcomer without being seen.  But with some of the wood folk he took no chances. Whenever he heard Solomon Owl's rolling call, or his cousin Simon Screecher's quavering whistle, Dickie Deer Mouse always pulled his head inside his house in a hurry.  For they were usually on the lookout for him. And he knew it.  Of course, if they had been aware that Dickie Deer Mouse was hidden inside his rebuilt, last year's bird's nest, either of them, with his sharp claws, could easily have torn the moss roof off Dickie's home. But luckily for Dickie, there were some things that they didn't know.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  VI  A WARNING   If old Mr. Crow had minded his own affairs everything would have gone well with Dickie Deer Mouse, after he moved into his new home. But Mr. Crow could not forget the time when Dickie had awakened him out of a sound sleep and frightened him almost out of his mind.  So whenever he caught sight of Dickie the old gentleman was sure to drop down upon the ground and ask him in a loud voice whose house he had prowled into lately.  \"Nobody's!\" Dickie Deer Mouse always told him. And then he would assure Mr. Crow that he was very sorry to have disturbed his rest.  It was quite like Mr. Crow, on such occasions, to act grumpy.  \"I haven't had a good night's sleep since you broke into my house,\" he declared to Dickie one day.  \"Perhaps you're over-eating,\" Dickie suggested politely.  Old Mr. Crow did not appear to like that remark.  \"Nothing of the sort!\" he bawled. \"I don't eat enough to keep a mosquito alive.\"  \"I often see you in the cornfield,\" Dickie Deer Mouse told him.  \"Ha!\" Mr. Crow exclaimed. \"What are you doing in the cornfield, I should like to know?\"  \"Sometimes I go there to get a few kernels of corn,\" Dickie explained.  \"Ha!\" Mr. Crow cried once more. \"That's where the corn's going! Farmer Green thinks I'm taking it. And so you're getting me into a peck of trouble, young man.\"  Dickie Deer Mouse couldn't help being worried when Mr. Crow said that. And he looked puzzled, too.  \"I don't see,\" he said, \"how I could have got you into a _peck_ of trouble, Mr. Crow, for I haven't eaten a peck of Farmer Green's corn. I've had only a few kernels of it--not more than half a pint.\"  \"Then you've got me into a half-pint of trouble, anyway,\" old Mr. Crow insisted. \"And that's too much, for a person of my age. You'll have to keep away from my--ahem!--from Farmer Green's cornfield. And what's more, Fatty Coon says the same thing.\"  At the mention of Fatty Coon's name Dickie Deer Mouse had to smile.  \"Fatty Coon!\" he echoed. \"How he does like corn!\"  \"Yes! But he doesn't like you,\" Mr. Crow snapped. \"You'd better look out for him,\" he warned Dickie. \"He'll come to call on you some night, the first thing you know.  \"By the way, where are you living now?\" Mr. Crow inquired.  But Dickie Deer Mouse made no answer. Right before Mr. Crow's sharp eyes he vanished among the roots of a tree. And it made the old gentleman quite peevish because he couldn't discover where Dickie Deer Mouse had hidden himself.  For a little while Mr. Crow stood like a black statue and peered at the tangle where Dickie Deer Mouse had disappeared. But Mr. Crow couldn't see him anywhere. And at last his patience came to an end.  \"He never answered my question,\" Mr. Crow "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18953"],["title","The Tale of Dickie Deer Mouse (#2)"],["body","grumbled. \"He wouldn't tell me where he lived. But I'll find out. I'll ask my cousin, Jasper Jay; for there isn't much that _he_ doesn't know.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  VII  NOISY VISITORS   Of course Jasper Jay knew where Dickie Deer Mouse lived. And he took great pleasure in pointing out the exact spot to his curious cousin, old Mr. Crow.  It was broad daylight when they visited the tree where Dickie's house hung. The two rogues did not know that he was drowsing inside his snug home, because he had been out late the night before.  No one that knew the two cousins would need to be told that they could never talk together quietly. Perched close to Dickie's house, Mr. Crow croaked in a hoarse voice, while Jasper Jay squalled harshly.  \"This is it!\" Jasper had announced, as soon as they arrived. \"This is his house. And isn't it a sight?\"  \"I should say so!\" old Mr. Crow agreed. \"It's got a roof on it--ha! ha!\"  And the two visitors laughed loudly, as if they thought there was a huge joke somewhere.  They made such a noise, from the very first, that Dickie Deer Mouse awoke and heard almost everything they said. But he didn't mind their remarks in the least--until he caught Fatty Coon's name.  It was old Mr. Crow who mentioned it first.  \"I'll have to tell Fatty Coon about this queer house,\" he chuckled. \"It's too good a joke to keep. He'll be over here as soon as he knows where to come, for he'll be glad to see it; and he wants to talk to Dickie Deer Mouse about taking our corn.\"  Dickie had still felt somewhat sleepy during the first part of this talk outside his house. But when Mr. Crow began to speak about Fatty Coon, Dickie became instantly wide awake. He sprang quickly to his feet; and thrusting his head through his doorway, he called in his loudest tone:  \"When do you think Fatty Coon will call on me?\"  The two cousins looked at each other. And then they looked all around.  \"What was that strange squeaking?\" Mr. Crow asked Jasper Jay.  \"To me it sounded a good deal like a rusty hinge on Farmer Green's barn door,\" Jasper Jay answered.  But Mr. Crow shook his head. \"It couldn't have been that,\" he said.  \"Maybe Mrs. Green is rocking on a loose board on the porch,\" Jasper suggested.  Still Mr. Crow couldn't agree with him.  \"Don't be silly!\" he snapped. \"We're half a mile from the farmhouse.\"  \"Well, what do _you_ think the noise was?\" Jasper Jay inquired.  Old Mr. Crow cocked an eye upward into the tree-top above him. \"I'd think it was a Squirrel if it was louder,\" he replied. Jasper Jay laughed in a most disagreeable fashion.  \"I'd think it was thunder if it was loud enough,\" he sneered.  And at that the two cousins began to quarrel violently. To tell the truth, they never could be together long without having a dispute.  For a short time Dickie Deer Mouse listened to their rude remarks, hoping that they would stop wrangling long enough to hear his question about Fatty Coon.  But they talked louder and louder. And since Dickie Deer Mouse never quarreled with anybody, and hated to hear such language as the two cousins used, he slipped out of his house without their seeing him and went over to the cornfield.  For he was hungry.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  VIII  IN THE CORNFIELD   In one way, especially, Fatty Coon and Dickie Deer Mouse were alike: They were night-prowlers. When they slept it was usually broad daylight outside, and the birds--except for a few odd fellows like Willie Whip-poor-will and Mr. Night Hawk--were abroad, and singing, and twittering. And when most of the birds went to sleep Dickie and Fatty Coon began to feel quite wide awake.  It was not strange, therefore, that Dickie Deer Mouse was surprised when he found himself face to face with Fatty Coon in the cornfield at midday.  Dickie tried to slip out of sight under a pumpkin vine that grew between the rows; but Fatty Coon saw him before he could hide. And Fatty began to make the queerest noise, as if he were almost choking.  Dickie Deer Mouse stopped. And he trembled the least bit; for Fatty looked terribly fierce. Perhaps (Dickie thought) he was choking with rage.  \"Can I help you?\" Dickie asked him. \"Would you like me to thump you on the back?\"  Fatty Coon shook his head. There was nothing the matter with him, except that he had stuffed his mouth so full that he couldn't speak. After swallowing several times he wiped his mouth on the back of his paw--a habit of which his mother had never been able to break him. It was no wonder that dainty Dickie Deer Mouse shuddered again, when Fatty did that.  \"May I go and get you a napkin?\" Dickie asked, as he edged away.  \"No!\" Fatty Coon growled. \"I've been wanting to have a talk with you. And now that I've found you, you needn't run off.\"  Then, to Dickie's horror, Fatty stopped talking and licked both his paws.  \"May I get you a finger bowl?\" Dickie inquired.  Fatty Coon actually didn't know what he meant.  \"Is that something to eat?\" he asked. And he looked much interested, and seemed quite downcast when Dickie said \"No!\"  \"Then you needn't trouble yourself,\" Fatty Coon told him with a sigh.  \"Can't you find corn enough for a good meal?\" Dickie asked him wonderingly.  \"I could,\" said Fatty Coon, \"if other people didn't take so much of it.... Now, there's Mr. Crow,\" he complained. \"I had to get out of bed and come over here to-day, in the sunlight, because I was afraid he wouldn't leave any corn for me.  \"There's no use saying anything to him,\" Fatty continued, \"because he thinks this is _his_ cornfield.... But little chaps like you will have to keep away from this place.... Now I've warned you,\" he added. \"And if I hear of your eating any more corn I'll come straight to your house--when I find out where it is--and I'll----\"  He did not finish his threat. But he looked so darkly at Dickie that what he _didn't_ say made Dickie Deer Mouse shiver all over, though the warm midday sun fell upon the cornfield.  Now, Dickie Deer Mouse hadn't eaten a single kernel of corn all that day. But he suddenly lost his appetite for it; and murmuring a faint good-bye he turned and ran for the woods as fast as he could go.  \"Stop! Stop!\" Fatty Coon called after him. \"There's something more I want to say to you.\"  But whatever it may have been, Dickie Deer Mouse did not wait to hear it.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  IX  FATTY COON NEEDS HELP   The moment he plunged into the woods beyond the cornfield Dickie Deer Mouse began to feel better. He knew that Fatty Coon would not leave that place of plenty until he had filled himself almost to bursting with tender young corn.  After Dickie had eaten a few seeds that he found under the trees, as well as a plump bug that was hiding beneath a log, he actually told himself that he was glad he had met Fatty Coon in the cornfield.  \"Now that he has talked with me,\" Dickie reasoned, \"he won't trouble himself to come to my house when old Mr. Crow tells him where I live.\"  That thought was a great comfort to him. Ever since he had waked up and heard Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay talking outside his house he had felt most uneasy. If Mr. Crow was going to guide Fatty Coon to his new home, Dickie hardly thought it safe to stay there any longer.  But now he was sure that that danger was past. Fatty had given him his warning. And Dickie had no doubt that so long as he kept away from the corn his greedy neighbor would never bother to disturb him.  So instead of quitting his snug home--as he had feared he must--he went back to it to finish his nap.  Now, Dickie Deer Mouse had lost so much sleep--through being disturbed by Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay--that when night came he kept right on sleeping. Yes! Instead of joining his friends in a mad scamper through the woods in the moonlight, Dickie Deer Mouse slept on and on and on, until--something shook the small tree where he lived and made it sway as if an earthquake had come.  Dickie Deer Mouse roused himself with a start. His sharp ears caught a scratching sound. And sticking his head through his doorway, he looked out.  One quick glance told him what was happening. That pudgy rascal, Fatty Coon, was climbing the tree! And every moment brought him nearer and nearer to Dickie's house.  Dickie's big, black eyes bulged more than ever as he whisked out of his house and scampered to the top of the tree, where the branches were so small that Fatty Coon could never follow him.  \"Stop!\" Fatty Coon cried. \"Mr. Crow told me where I could find you. And I want to have a word with you.\"  \"What sort of word?\" Dickie Deer Mouse inquired.  \"It's about the cornfield,\" Fatty Coon explained.  \"I haven't been near that place since you last saw me there,\" Dickie declared.  \"I know you haven't,\" Fatty told him. \"That's just why I want to have a word with you. I'm in a peck of trouble. And I want you to help me.\"  Dickie Deer Mouse could scarcely believe it. But being a very polite young gentleman, he told Fatty that he would be glad to do anything in his power to assist him--or at least, anything except to come down out of the top of the tree.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  X  A BIT OF ADVICE   \"It's like this,\" Fatty Coon said, puffing a bit--on account of his climb--as he looked up at Dickie Deer Mouse. \"Old Mr. Crow says that Farmer Green is going to sick old dog Spot on me if I don't keep out of the cornfield.\"  \"Well, I should say it was very kind of Mr. Crow to tell you,\" Dickie remarked.  Fatty Coon was not so sure of that.  \"He'd like to have the cornfield to himself,\" he told Dickie. \"He'd like nothing better than to keep me out of it. And if old dog Spot is coming there after me, I certainly don't want to go near the place again.\"  \"Then I'd stay away, if I were you,\" Dickie Deer Mouse told him.  \"Ah! That's just the trouble!\" Fatty Coon cried. \"I can't! I'm too fond of corn. And that's why I've come here to have a word with you,\" he went on. \"I've noticed that you haven't set foot in the cornfield since I spoke to you over there "]]]
