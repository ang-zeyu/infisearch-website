It isn't much but she saves it up to buy shoes for me. And there's the baby--he'll want shoes soon. And every six-pence is something, isn't it?\"  \"To be sure, my little man. And here is the book for you, full of pictures and stories.\"  There were poems in it too, and Diamond at once began to puzzle out one of them which ran like this:            I have only one foot, but thousands of toes;           My one foot stands but never goes.           I have many arms and they are mighty, all;           And hundreds of fingers large and small.           From the ends of my fingers my beauty grows,           I breathe with my hair and I drink with my toes.           In the summer, with song I shake and quiver,           But in winter, I fast and groan and shiver.  When Diamond ran home with his new book in his hand, he found his father at home already. He was sitting by the fire and looking rather miserable for his head ached and he looked sick. The next day, he had to stay in bed while his wife nursed him, and Diamond took care of the baby. By the next day, he was very ill indeed. And it was not long before their money was all gone.  Diamond's mother could not help crying over it but she came into Diamond's room so that the poor sick father should not hear it. Diamond was frightened when he heard her sobbing and said, \"Is father worse?\"  \"No, no,\" said his mother, \"he is better. But the money is all gone and what are we to do?\"  \"Don't cry,\" said Diamond. \"We'll get along some how. Let me read to you out of North Wind's book.\"  So he read a little story about the early bird that caught the nice fat worm.  \"I wish you were like that little bird, dear,\" said his mother, \"and could catch something to eat!\"  After she was gone away, Diamond lay thinking and somehow he seemed to hear the murmur of North Wind's river blowing through his thoughts and telling him about something he could do. The next morning he got up as soon as he heard the men moving in the yard. When he went down, the stable was just opened. \"I'm the early bird, I think,\" he said to himself, \"and I hope I'll catch the worm.\"  [Illustration: HE FASTENED THE CHEEK-STRAP VERY CAREFULLY]  He would not ask any one to help him because he was afraid he would be kept from doing what he wanted. With the aid of an old chair, he got the harness on old Diamond. The dear old horse opened his mouth for the bit just as if Diamond was giving him an apple. He fastened the cheek-strap very carefully, and got all the pieces of harness on and buckled. By this time some of the men were watching him to see if he would get it all done by himself. And when he put old Diamond between the shafts, got his whip, and jumped up on the box, the men broke into a cheer.  The cheer brought his mother to the window and when she saw her little boy setting out all alone in the cab, she called \"Diamond! Diamond!\" But Diamond did not hear her for the rattle of the cab and so he drove away. He was very much afraid no one would hire him because he was such a little driver. But before he got to his regular stand, he was hailed by a man who wanted to catch a train and was in too great a hurry to think about the driver. He got a good fare for that and reached the cab-stand the first one after all. As the other cabmen came, he told them about his father and said that he was going to drive the cab in his place.  \"Well, you are a plucky one!\" they all said. \"And you shall have a fair chance with the rest.\"  And he did, for another gentleman came up very soon for him. When he saw the boy, he was much astonished. \"Are you the driver of this cab?\" he asked. \"Yes, sir,\" answered Diamond, showing his father's badge of which he was proud.  \"You are the youngest cabman I ever saw!\" said the gentleman greatly amused. \"But I believe I'll risk you!\"  He jumped in and soon found that Diamond got him over the ground very well. The trip was one of several miles and the gentleman paid him three shillings for the drive. When Diamond got back, he stopped at a stand where he had never been before and got down to put on old Diamond's nose-bag of oats. The men there did not treat him very nicely and a group of rough boys came up and began to torment him. But who do you think came to his rescue? Why, the drunken cabman whose room was next to Diamond's and whose baby Diamond had once rocked and put to sleep.  \"What is up here?\" the cabman asked.  \"Do you see this young snip?\" the boys cried, \"He pretends to drive a cab!\"  \"Yes, I do see him,\" said the cabman. \"I see you, too. You'd better take yourselves away from here or you won't find me very agreeable!\"  And they went in a hurry!  When Diamond went home that night, he carried one pound, one shilling and six-pence. His mother had grown very anxious and was almost afraid to look when she heard his cab coming at last. But there was the old horse, and there was the cab, all right! And there was Diamond on the box his face as triumphant as a full moon! One of the men took the horse to put him up and Diamond ran into the house and into the arms of his mother!  \"See! See!\" he cried. \"Here is the worm I caught!\" He poured out the six-pences and shillings into her lap. His mother burst out crying again, but with joy this time and ran to show his father. Then how pleased _he_ was! And Diamond snatched up the baby and began to sing and dance, he was so happy!  The next morning, Diamond was up almost as early as before. But the men would not let him do the harnessing any more. They got the cab all ready for him and sent him in to eat all the breakfast he could and get well bundled up. His first passenger was a young woman to be taken to the docks. When he started back some roughs came along and tried to steal his fare. But a pale-faced man came up and beat them off with his stick, and told Diamond to drive away. Diamond begged him to get into the cab and ride. The man said he could not spare the money to ride--he was too poor.  \"Oh, do come!\" said Diamond. \"I don't want the money. You helped me. Let me help you.\"  \"Well,\" said the man, \"if you will take me to Chiswick, I can pay for that. Drive to the Wilderness--Mr. Coleman's place. I'll show you when we get there.\"  Now Diamond had been thinking he had seen the gentleman before and when he said this, it flashed upon him that it was Mr. Evans who had been going to marry Miss Coleman. North Wind had sunk his and Mr. Coleman's ship because their business was not honest and was making bad men of them. She had carried Mr. Evans away to a desert island. He had just got back again and was poor now and humble and willing to begin to work again in an honest way.  It was plain he did not know that Mr. Coleman had been ruined too and had been forced to sell the Wilderness and move into a poor house in the city. But Diamond knew, and as he drove along he was thinking what he ought to do. The gentleman would not find Miss Coleman at the Wilderness. And if he told him where she lived now, perhaps he would not go to see her because he would be so ashamed of having brought all this trouble on her by trying so hard to be rich.  Still he must want to see her very much and she must want to see him. So Diamond made up his mind to drive straight to where Miss Coleman lived now, and then they could explain to each other. So on he went.  Now the wind was blowing furiously and when old Diamond finally got to Miss Coleman's house and held back to stop, one of the straps of the harness broke. Diamond jumped down and opened the cab door and asked the gentleman if he would not step into this house where friends of his lived and wait while he mended the strap. Then he ran and rang the bell and whispered to the maid who came to call Miss Coleman. A few minutes later, he was not at all sure he had done the right thing. For suddenly there came the sound of a great cry and then a running to and fro in the house. But after a little while, they came and called him in and Miss Coleman put her arms around him and hugged him tight!  The rest of the day, he did very well. And what a story he had to tell his father and mother that night about Mr. Evans and the Colemans. They were sure he had done right and he was so glad!     CHAPTER VIII  DIAMOND VISITS NANNY   For a fortnight, Diamond went on driving his cab and helping his family. Some people began to know him and to look for him to drive them where they wanted to go. One old gentleman who lived near the stables hired him to carry him into the city every morning at a certain hour. And Diamond was as regular as clock work. After that fortnight, his father was able to go out again. Then Diamond began to think about little Nanny and went off to inquire about her.  The first day his father took up his work again, Diamond went with him as usual. In the afternoon, however, his father went home and left Diamond to drive the cab for the rest of the day. It was hard for old Diamond to do all the work but they could not afford to have another horse. They saved him as much as they could and fed him well and he did bravely.  The next morning, his father was so much stronger that Diamond thought he might go and ask Mr. Raymond to take him to see Nanny. Mr. Raymond was quite willing to go and so they walked over to the hospital which was close at hand.  When Diamond followed Mr. Raymond into the room where those children lay who had got over the worst of their illness, and were growing better, he saw a number of little iron beds. Each one of them stood with its head to the wall and in each one was a child whose face showed just how far it had left the pain behind and was getting well. Diamond looked all around but he could see no Nanny. He turned to Mr. Raymond with a question in his eyes.  \"Well?\" said Mr. Raymond.  \"Nanny's not here,\" said Diamond.  \"Oh, yes, she is.\"  \"I don't see her!\"  \"I do, though.

To my Son-in-Law,                 SOL SMITH RUSSELL,          of the United States of America,    though Residing in Minneapolis, Minnesota,                   who is always \"On the Blockade\" against Melancholy, \"The Blues,\"            and all similar maladies,                    This Volume           is affectionately dedicated.     PREFACE   \"ON THE BLOCKADE\" is the third of \"The Blue and the Gray Series.\" Like the first and second volumes, its incidents are dated back to the War of the Rebellion, and located in the midst of its most stirring scenes on the Southern coast, where the naval operations of the United States contributed their full share to the final result.  The writer begs to remind his readers again that he has not felt called upon to invest his story with the dignity of history, or in all cases to mingle fiction with actual historic occurrences. He believes that all the scenes of the story are not only possible, but probable, and that just such events as he has narrated really and frequently occurred in the days of the Rebellion.  The historian is forbidden to make his work more palatable or more interesting by the intermixture of fiction with fact, while the story-writer, though required to be reasonably consistent with the spirit and the truth of history, may wander from veritable details, and use his imagination in the creation of incidents upon which the grand result is reached. It would not be allowable to make the Rebellion a success, if the writer so desired, even on the pages of romance; and it would not be fair or just to ignore the bravery, the self-sacrifice, and the heroic endurance of the Southern people in a cause they believed to be holy and patriotic, as almost universally admitted at the present time, any more than it would be to lose sight of the magnificent spirit, the heroism, the courage, and the persistence, of the Northern people in accomplishing what they believed then, and still believe, was a holy and patriotic duty in the preservation of the Union.  Incidents not inconsistent with the final result, or with the spirit of the people on either side in the great conflict are of comparatively little consequence. That General Lee or General Grant turned this or that corner in reaching Appomattox may be important, but the grand historical tableau is the Christian hero, noble in the midst of defeat, disaster, and ruin, formally rendering his sword to the impassible but magnanimous conqueror as the crowning event of a long and bloody war. The details are historically important, though overshadowed by the mighty result of the great conflict.  Many of the personages of the preceding volumes have been introduced in the present one, and the central figure remains the same. The writer is willing to admit that his hero is an ideal character, though his lofty tone and patriotic spirit were fully paralleled by veritable individuals during the war; and he is not prepared to apologize for the abundant success which attended the career of Christy Passford. Those who really struggled as earnestly and faithfully deserved his good fortune, though they did not always obtain it.    Dorchester, Mass., April 24, 1890.

I have sailed with all her officers, and Paul Vapoor and I have been cronies for years,\" continued Christy, with a shade of gloom on his bright face.  \"You will probably see them occasionally, and if your life is spared you may again find yourself an officer of the Bellevite. But I think you have no occasion to indulge in any regrets,\" said Captain Passford, imparting a cheerful expression to his dignified countenance. \"Allow me to call your attention to the fact that you are the commander of this fine little steamer. Here you are in your own cabin, and you are still nothing but a boy, hardly eighteen years old.\"  \"If I have not earned my rank, it is not my fault that I have it,\" answered Christy, hardly knowing whether to be glad or sorry for his rapid advancement. \"I have never asked for anything; I did not ask or expect to be promoted. I was satisfied with my rank as a midshipman.\"  \"I did not ask for your promotion, though I could probably have procured for you the rank of master when you entered the navy. I do not like to ask favors for a member of my own family. I have wished you to feel that you were in the service of your country because it needs you, and not for glory or profit.\"  \"And I have tried to feel so, father.\"  \"I think you have felt so, my son; and I am prouder of the fact that you are a disinterested patriot than of the rank you have nobly and bravely won,\" said Captain Passford, as he took some letters from his pocket, from which he selected one bearing an English postage stamp. \"I have a letter from one of my agents in England, which, I think, contains valuable information. I have called the attention of the government to these employes of mine, and they will soon pass from my service to that of the naval department. The information sent me has sometimes been very important.\"  \"I know that myself, for the information that came from that source"]]]
