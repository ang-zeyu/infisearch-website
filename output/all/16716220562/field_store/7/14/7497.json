And when she came to look out at the door, she saw him and shrieked out for joy; and he dismounted and took her in his arms, and she kissed him, saying,  \"Now hast thou set me free from my enchantment, and to-morrow we will be married.\"     THE FROG PRINCE   IN the old times, when it was still of some use to wish for the thing one wanted, there lived a King whose daughters were all handsome, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun himself, who has seen so much, wondered each time he shone over her because of her beauty. Near the royal castle there was a great dark wood, and in the wood under an old linden-tree was a well; and when the day was hot, the King's daughter used to go forth into the wood and sit by the brink of the cool well, and if the time seemed long, she would take out a golden ball, and throw it up and catch it again, and this was her favourite pastime.  Now it happened one day that the golden ball, instead of falling back into the maiden's little hand which had sent it aloft, dropped to the ground near the edge of the well and rolled in. The king's daughter followed it with her eyes as it sank, but the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. Then she began to weep, and she wept and wept as if she could never be comforted. And in the midst of her weeping she heard a voice saying to her,  \"What ails thee, king's daughter? thy tears would melt a heart of stone.\"  And when she looked to see where the voice came from, there was nothing but a frog stretching his thick ugly head out of the water.  \"Oh, is it you, old waddler?\" said she; \"I weep because my golden ball has fallen into the well.\"  \"Never mind, do not weep,\" answered the frog; \"I can help you; but what will you give me if I fetch up your ball again?\"  \"Whatever you like, dear frog,\" said she; \"any of my clothes, my pearls and jewels, or even the golden crown that I wear.\"  \"Thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, and thy golden crown are not for me,\" answered the frog; \"but if thou wouldst love me, and have me for thy companion and play-fellow, and let me sit by thee at table, and eat from thy plate, and drink from thy cup, and sleep in thy little bed,--if thou wouldst promise all this, then would I dive below the water and fetch thee thy golden ball again.\"  \"Oh yes,\" she answered; \"I will promise it all, whatever you want, if you will only get me my ball again.\"  But she thought to herself, \"What nonsense he talks! as if he could do anything but sit in the water and croak with the other frogs, or could possibly be any one's companion.\"  But the frog, as soon as he heard her promise, drew his head under the water and sank down out of sight, but after a while he came to the surface again with the ball in his mouth, and he threw it on the grass.  The King's daughter was overjoyed to see her pretty play-thing again, and she caught it up and ran off with it.  \"Stop, stop!\" cried the frog; \"take me up too; I cannot run as fast as you!\"  But it was of no use, for croak, croak after her as he might, she would not listen to him, but made haste home, and very soon forgot all about the poor frog, who had to betake himself to his well again.  The next day, when the King's daughter was sitting at table with the King and all the court, and eating from her golden plate, there came something pitter patter up the marble stairs, and then there came a knocking at the door, and a voice crying \"Youngest King's daughter, let me in!\"  And she got up and ran to see who it could be, but when she opened the door, there was the frog sitting outside. Then she shut the door hastily and went back to her seat, feeling very uneasy. The King noticed how quickly her heart was beating, and said,  \"My child, what are you afraid of? is there a giant standing at the door ready to carry you away?\"  \"Oh no,\" answered she; \"no giant, but a horrid frog.\"  \"And what does the frog want?\" asked the King.  \"O dear father,\" answered she, \"when I was sitting by the well yesterday, and playing with my golden ball, it fell into the water, and while I was crying for the loss of it, the frog came and got it again for me on condition I would let him be my companion, but I never thought that he could leave the water and come after me; but now there he is outside the door, and he wants to come in to me.\"  And then they all heard him knocking the second time and crying,      \"Youngest King's daughter,     Open to me!     By the well water     What promised you me?     Youngest King's daughter     Now open to me!\"  \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform,\" said the King; \"so go now and let him in.\"  So she went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in, following at her heels, till she reached her chair. Then he stopped and cried,  \"Lift me up to sit by you.\"  But she delayed doing so until the King ordered her. When once the frog was on the chair, he wanted to get on the table, and there he sat and said,  \"Now push your golden plate a little nearer, so that we may eat together.\"  And so she did, but everybody might see how unwilling she was, and the frog feasted heartily, but every morsel seemed to stick in her throat.  \"I have had enough now,\" said the frog at last, \"and as I am tired, you must carry me to your room, and make ready your silken bed, and we will lie down and go to sleep.\"  Then the King's daughter began to weep, and was afraid of the cold frog, that nothing would satisfy him but he must sleep in her pretty clean bed. Now the King grew angry with her, saying,  \"That which thou hast promised in thy time of necessity, must thou now perform.\"  So she picked up the frog with her finger and thumb, carried him upstairs and put him in a corner, and when she had lain down to sleep, he came creeping up, saying, \"I am tired and want sleep as much as you; take me up, or I will tell your father.\"  Then she felt beside herself with rage, and picking him up, she threw him with all her strength against the wall, crying,  \"Now will you be quiet, you horrid frog!\"  But as he fell, he ceased to be a frog, and became all at once a prince with beautiful kind eyes. And it came to pass that, with her father's consent, they became bride and bridegroom. And he told her how a wicked witch had bound him by her spells, and how no one but she alone could have released him, and that they two would go together to his father's kingdom. And there came to the door a carriage drawn by eight white horses, with white plumes on their heads, and with golden harness, and behind the carriage was standing faithful Henry, the servant of the young prince. Now, faithful Henry had suffered such care and pain when his master was turned into a frog, that he had been obliged to wear three iron bands over his heart, to keep it from breaking with trouble and anxiety. When the carriage started to take the prince to his kingdom, and faithful Henry had helped them both in, he got up behind, and was full of joy at his master's deliverance. And when they had gone a part of the way, the prince heard a sound at the back of the carriage, as if something had broken, and he turned round and cried,  \"Henry, the wheel must be breaking!\" but Henry answered,      \"The wheel does not break,     'Tis the band round my heart     That, to lessen its ache,     When I grieved for your sake,     I bound round my heart.\"  Again, and yet once again there was the same sound, and the prince thought it must be the wheel breaking, but it was the breaking of the other bands from faithful Henry's heart, because it was now so relieved and happy.     CAT & MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP.   A CAT having made acquaintance with a mouse, professed such great love and friendship for her, that the mouse at last agreed that they should live and keep house together.  \"We must make provision for the winter,\" said the cat, \"or we shall suffer hunger, and you, little mouse, must not stir out, or you will be caught in a trap.\"  So they took counsel together and bought a little pot of fat. And then they could not tell where to put it for safety, but after long consideration the cat said there could not be a better place than the church, for nobody would steal there; and they would put it under the altar and not touch it until they were really in want. So this was done, and the little pot placed in safety.  But before long the cat was seized with a great wish to taste it.  \"Listen to me, little mouse,\" said he; \"I have been asked by my cousin to stand god-father to a little son she has brought into the world; he is white with brown spots; and they want to have the christening to-day, so let me go to it, and you stay at home and keep house.\"  \"Oh yes, certainly,\" answered the mouse, \"pray go by all means; and when you are feasting on all the good things, think of me; I should so like a drop of the sweet red wine.\"  But there was not a word of truth in all this; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to stand god-father: he went to the church, straight up to the little pot, and licked the fat off the top; then he took a walk over the roofs of the town, saw his acquaintances, stretched himself in the sun, and licked his whiskers as often as he thought of the little pot of fat; and then when it was evening he went home.  \"Here you are at last,\" said the mouse; \"I expect you have had a merry time.\"  \"Oh, pretty well,\" answered the cat.  \"And what name did you give the child?\" asked the mouse.  \"Top-off,\" answered the cat, drily.  \"Top-off!\" cried the mouse, \"that is a singular and wonderful name! is it common in your family?\"  \"What does it matter?\" said the cat; \"it's not any worse than Crumb-picker, like your god-child.\"  A little time after this the cat was again seized with a longing.  \"Again I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],["title","Household Stories (#7)"],["body","ask you,\" said he to the mouse, \"to do me a favour, and keep house alone for a day. I have been asked a second time to stand god-father; and as the little one has a white ring round its neck, I cannot well refuse.\"  So the kind little mouse consented, and the cat crept along by the town wall until he reached the church, and going straight to the little pot of fat, devoured half of it.  \"Nothing tastes so well as what one keeps to oneself,\" said he, feeling quite content with his day's work. When he reached home, the mouse asked what name had been given to the child.  \"Half-gone,\" answered the cat.  \"Half-gone!\" cried the mouse, \"I never heard such a name in my life! I'll bet it's not to be found in the calendar.\"  Soon after that the cat's mouth began to water again for the fat.  \"Good things always come in threes,\" said he to the mouse; \"again I have been asked to stand god-father, the little one is quite black with white feet, and not any white hair on its body; such a thing does not happen every day, so you will let me go, won't you?\"  \"Top-off, Half-gone,\" murmured the mouse, \"they are such curious names, I cannot but wonder at them!\"  \"That's because you are always sitting at home,\" said the cat, \"in your little grey frock and hairy tail, never seeing the world, and fancying all sorts of things.\"  So the little mouse cleaned up the house and set it all in order. Meanwhile the greedy cat went and made an end of the little pot of fat.  \"Now all is finished one's mind will be easy,\" said he, and came home in the evening, quite sleek and comfortable. The mouse asked at once what name had been given to the third child.  \"It won't please you any better than the others,\" answered the cat. \"It is called All-gone.\"  \"All-gone!\" cried the mouse. \"What an unheard-of-name! I never met with anything like it! All-gone! whatever can it mean?\" And shaking her head, she curled herself round and went to sleep. After that the cat was not again asked to stand god-father.  When the winter had come and there was nothing more to be had out of doors, the mouse began to think of their store.  \"Come, cat,\" said she, \"we will fetch our pot of fat, how good it will taste, to be sure!\"  \"Of course it will,\" said the cat, \"just as good as if you stuck your tongue out of window!\"  So they set out, and when they reached the place, they found the pot, but it was standing empty.  \"Oh, now I know what it all meant,\" cried the mouse, \"now I see what sort of a partner you have been! Instead of standing god-father you have devoured it all up; first Top-off, then Half-gone, then\"----  \"Will you hold your tongue!\" screamed the cat, \"another word, and I devour you too!\"  And the poor little mouse, having \"All-gone\" on her tongue, out it came, and the cat leaped upon her and made an end of her. And that is the way of the world.     The WOLF and the SEVEN LITTLE GOATS.   THERE was once an old goat who had seven little ones, and was as fond of them as ever mother was of her children. One day she had to go into the wood to fetch food for them, so she called them all round her.  \"Dear children,\" said she, \"I am going out into the wood; and while I am gone, be on your guard against the wolf, for if he were once to get inside he would eat you up, skin, bones, and all. The wretch often disguises himself, but he may always be known by his hoarse voice and black paws.\"  \"Dear mother,\" answered the kids, \"you need not be afraid, we will take good care of ourselves.\" And the mother bleated good-bye, and went on her way with an easy mind.  It was not long before some one came knocking at the house-door, and crying out,  \"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is come back, and has brought each of you something.\"  But the little kids knew it was the wolf by the hoarse voice.  \"We will not open the door,\" cried they; \"you are not our mother, she has a delicate and sweet voice, and your voice is hoarse; you must be the wolf.\"  Then off went the wolf to a shop and bought a big lump of chalk, and ate it up to make his voice soft. And then he came back, knocked at the house-door, and cried,  \"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is here, and has brought each of you something.\"  But the wolf had put up his black paws against the window, and the kids seeing this, cried out,  \"We will not open the door; our mother has no black paws like you; you must be the wolf.\"  The wolf then ran to a baker.  \"Baker,\" said he, \"I am hurt in the foot; pray spread some dough over the place.\"  And when the baker had plastered his feet, he ran to the miller.  \"Miller,\" said he, \"strew me some white meal over my paws.\" But the miller refused, thinking the wolf must be meaning harm to some one.  \"If you don't do it,\" cried the wolf, \"I'll eat you up!\"  And the miller was afraid and did as he was told. And that just shows what men are.  And now came the rogue the third time to the door and knocked. \"Open, children!\" cried he. \"Your dear mother has come home, and brought you each something from the wood.\"  \"First show us your paws,\" said the kids, \"so that we may know if you are really our mother or not.\"  And he put up his paws against the window, and when they saw that they were white, all seemed right, and they opened the door; and when he was inside they saw it was the wolf, and they were terrified and tried to hide themselves. One ran under the table, the second got into the bed, the third into the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the cupboard, the sixth under the sink, the seventh in the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and gave them short shrift; one after the other he swallowed down, all but the youngest, who was hid in the clock-case. And so the wolf, having got what he wanted, strolled forth into the green meadows, and laying himself down under a tree, he fell asleep.  Not long after, the mother goat came back from the wood; and, oh! what a sight met her eyes! the door was standing wide open, table, chairs, and stools, all thrown about, dishes broken, quilt and pillows torn off the bed. She sought her children, they were nowhere to be found. She called to each of them by name, but nobody answered, until she came to the name of the youngest.  \"Here I am, mother,\" a little voice cried, \"here, in the clock-case.\"  And so she helped him out, and heard how the wolf had come, and eaten all the rest. And you may think how she cried for the loss of her dear children. At last in her grief she wandered out of doors, and the youngest kid with her; and when they came into the meadow, there they saw the wolf lying under a tree, and snoring so that the branches shook. The mother goat looked at him carefully on all sides and she noticed how something inside his body was moving and struggling.  \"Dear me!\" thought she, \"can it be that my poor children that he devoured for his evening meal are still alive?\" And she sent the little kid back to the house for a pair of shears, and needle, and thread. Then she cut the wolf's body open, and no sooner had she made one snip than out came the head of one of the kids, and then another snip, and then one after the other the six little kids all jumped out alive and well, for in his greediness the rogue had swallowed them down whole. How delightful this was! so they comforted their dear mother and hopped about like tailors at a wedding.  \"Now fetch some good hard stones,\" said the mother, \"and we will fill his body with them, as he lies asleep.\"  And so they fetched some in all haste, and put them inside him, and the mother sewed him up so quickly again that he was none the wiser.  When the wolf at last awoke, and got up, the stones inside him made him feel very thirsty, and as he was going to the brook to drink, they struck and rattled one against another. And so he cried out:      \"What is this I feel inside me     Knocking hard against my bones?     How should such a thing betide me!     They were kids, and now they're stones.\"  So he came to the brook, and stooped to drink, but the heavy stones weighed him down, so he fell over into the water and was drowned. And when the seven little kids saw it they came up running.  \"The wolf is dead, the wolf is dead!\" they cried, and taking hands, they danced with their mother all about the place.  [Illustration: FAITHFUL JOHN  \"IT HAPPENED, AS THEY WERE STILL JOURNEYING ON THE OPEN SEA, THAT FAITHFUL JOHN, AS HE SAT IN THE FORE PART OF THE SHIP, & MADE MUSIC, CAUGHT SIGHT OF THREE RAVENS FLYING OVERHEAD. THEN HE STOPPED PLAYING & LISTENED TO WHAT THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER\"]     FAITHFUL JOHN   THERE was once an old King, who, having fallen sick, thought to himself, \"This is very likely my death-bed on which I am lying.\"  Then he said, \"Let Faithful John be sent for.\"  Faithful John was his best-beloved servant, and was so called because he had served the King faithfully all his life long. When he came near the bed, the King said to him,  \"Faithful John, I feel my end drawing near, and my only care is for my son; he is yet of tender years, and does not always know how to shape his conduct; and unless you promise me to instruct him in all his actions and be a true foster-father to him, I shall not be able to close my eyes in peace.\"  Then answered Faithful John, \"I will never forsake him, and will serve him faithfully, even though it should cost me my life.\"  And the old King said, \"Then I die, being of good cheer and at peace.\" And he went on to say,  \"After my death, you must lead him through the whole castle, into all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and show him the treasures that in them lie; but the last chamber in the long gallery, in which lies hidden the picture of the Princess of the Golden Palace, you must not show him. If he were to see that picture, he would directly fall into so great a love for her, that he would faint with the strength of it, and afterwards for her sake run into great dangers; so you must guard him well.\"  And as Faithful John gave him his hand"]]]
