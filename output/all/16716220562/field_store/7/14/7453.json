I went to the station, Florence, and I found out there that you hadn't really gone home; then I thought you were lost, or that the cars had run over you, or the gypsies had stolen you, or that--oh I'm so miserable,\" she caught her breath, and shivered with cold and excitement.  Her mother was unfastening her wet garments. She felt that Dimple's naughtiness had brought its own punishment. \"I think Florence has changed her mind about going home,\" she said, quietly.  Dimple raised a tear-stained face. \"Oh, Florence, have you?\" she exclaimed. \"I'm so glad. I don't want you to think I don't love you, for I do. I love you dearly, dearly, Florence, and I think your hair is lovely.\"  This was too much for Florence's tender heart, and she sobbed out, \"It was my fault too, Dimple. I said hateful things, and I couldn't forgive myself when I thought you had gone, I didn't know where. I had no business to scare you so. Please, Aunt Flo, kiss us and forgive us, and please, for my sake, don't scold Dimple.\"  Mrs. Dallas gathered the two little penitents into her loving arms. They were so truly sorry, and had suffered really more than they deserved. \"I think Dimple sees her fault quite plainly, dear,\" Florence was told, \"but I am afraid you will both be ill, and so I think I must put you to bed, not for punishment, but because you must be kept warm, and must have something hot to keep you from taking cold. Where is Bubbles, Dimple? Wasn't she with you?\"  \"Not all the time, mamma, but she came after me, and found me on the corner. Please don't punish her. She only went out because she wanted to find me.\"  \"I understand that, and I know she did not mean to do wrong. She did what she felt to be her duty to you. I'll not scold her, nor punish her, daughter.\"  Dimple gave a sigh of relief, and pressed her wet cheek against her mother's. \"Please kiss me, mamma,\" she whispered, \"and then I'll know you forgive naughty me.\"  Mrs. Dallas immediately consented, and when she left the room, two very contrite little girls cuddled up close to each other, and took without a murmur the hot herb tea which Mrs. Dallas brought to them. And the next morning when they woke, lo! the sun was shining, and not an ache nor a pain did either little girl feel to remind her of the dreary yesterday.     CHAPTER IV  Housebreakers   Despite all this unpleasant experience, it was only about a week later that Dimple and Florence came near getting into trouble again. This time, however, it was Florence who set the ball rolling. It was not exactly from a spirit of mischief, but because her fancy was appealed to, and because she did not see any harm in what she proposed.  The two little girls had been to take a note to Mrs. Hardy, and on their way home they passed a pretty house and grounds which greatly attracted Florence.  \"Oh, do let us stop and look in,\" she said. \"I think this is the very prettiest place here, don't you, Dimple?\"  \"Yes,\" was the reply, \"I like it best. The grounds are so lovely. See those roses.\"  The two pressed their faces against the iron railing, and let their eyes wander over the lawn and to the garden beyond.  \"How very quiet it is,\" Florence remarked, presently. \"We can't hear a sound except the wind among the trees, and the robins singing. There doesn't seem to be a soul about. Who lives here, Dimple?\"  \"The Atkinsons. Mamma and papa know them.\"  \"Are there any little children?\"  \"Not now; there used to be a little girl named Stella, but she died two years ago, and now there is only their eldest son living; he has just gone abroad with his mother. That is why it's so quiet. They are all away. You see the house is shut up.\"  \"Ah, I wonder if they would mind if we went in and looked around. Do you think they would mind? I should love so to go and sit on that porch for a few minutes.\"  Dimple hesitated. She wasn't quite sure that it would be right for them to go in, especially when no one was at home.  \"You know,\" Florence went on, \"it would be just exactly the same as if we went there to call, and they should happen to be out. It won't hurt anybody or anything for us to walk around and look at the grounds.\"  At last Dimple consented. So they lifted the latch of the gate and shut it behind them very gingerly.  \"Do you often come here?\" asked Florence, when they had made their tour of the grounds and were sitting on the porch in the shadow of the vines.  \"Not so very often, but I have been here with mamma when she came to call. I remember Stella very well. She died of diphtheria, and they have a lovely portrait of her. She was such a pretty little girl, and the portrait shows her with a great big dog she used to have.\"  \"How I should like to see the portrait. Wouldn't it be nice if the door should suddenly open, and we could walk right in?\"  Dimple laughed. \"I'd be scared if that should happen. The house is beautiful inside. I never saw so many pretty things. Mrs. Atkinson's father was a naval officer, and she has curiosities from all over the world.\"  \"I wish Mrs. Atkinson had said, 'Dimple, here are the keys, come in as often as you like while we are away; in fact, I wish you would try to come in and look around once in a while to see if everything is all right.'\"  \"Maybe she would have said that if she had thought of it,\" returned Dimple, \"for she is always so nice and pleasant.\"  Florence cast wistful eyes up and down the side of the house; then she went out on the lawn, at the side, and looked up. \"Dimple, come here,\" she called, and her cousin obeyed. \"We could get in as easily as anything,\" said Florence. \"See, that's a very easy tree to climb, and that long branch goes right over the upper porch. We could reach that; then we could go in by raising the window.\"  \"If the window is not fastened down. Maybe there is some one in the house, after all. I shouldn't think they would leave it with no one ever to look after it. We might go around to the back door and see.\"  \"Let's try climbing the tree anyhow. It will be easy enough to do that, and won't do a bit of harm. See, I'm going,\" and Florence put her foot against the rough bark, and swung herself up, reaching the porch without difficulty. But Dimple would not follow and her cousin climbed down again, not, however, as easily as she had gone up.  \"It was nothing at all to do,\" she declared. \"I think you might try it, Dimple. I'll tell you what we'll do: let's bring our dolls to-morrow, and go up there and play. I'm sure if I had a pretty place like this, I should be glad if two little girls, like us, could come and enjoy it. Ah, Dimple, you don't know how fine it is on that upper porch. It would be the finest place in the world to play in.\"  The idea took such possession of her that the next morning she broached the subject again.  \"I'll ask mamma,\" said Dimple, at last consenting with this proviso. But Mrs. Dallas had gone out to spend the morning with a friend, and finally Florence's persuasions overcame Dimple's scruples, and with Celestine and Rubina they set forth.  At first Florence was contented to play on the corner porch, but the memory of the day before was too much for her, and she again climbed to the upper porch. \"Do come up, Dimple,\" she coaxed. \"You've no idea how fine it is, with the tree all around. It's just like a nest,\" and Dimple decided that she would try it too.  \"Wait, we mustn't leave the dolls,\" Florence said. \"I wish we had a piece of string. See if you can find a piece, Dimple.\"  After much searching Dimple hunted up an end of rope, which she found by the kitchen shed, and brought around. \"Will this do?\" she asked.  \"Finely. Can you throw it so I can catch it?\"  \"I don't know. Maybe I could if I tied a stone to it. Don't let it hit you, Florence.\"  After several attempts the rope was landed, and when the dolls were fastened to it, they were drawn safely up, and then Dimple made her ascent successfully.  \"It is nice,\" she declared. \"Isn't it fun to be here, where no one can see us? I wonder if that window will open.\" She gave the shutters a little shake and lo! they offered no resistance, but opened easily, and, the latch being out of order, the window, too, yielded to their efforts, and before they knew it, they were inside.  \"Now we're here, we might as well go through the house,\" said Florence. \"And you can show me the portrait.\"  They proceeded stealthily through rooms whose furniture was swathed in sheets to keep away the dust. It all looked rather bare and desolate upstairs in the dim rooms, but it was better below, especially in the dining-room, where a big bay window let in a flood of light when the inside shutters were opened.  \"Let's pretend it's our house, and keep house really,\" Florence exclaimed. \"Here is a broom and a duster. I'll sweep and you can dust. Then if we can find some dishes, we'll set the table. I wish we had brought something to eat. Oh, Dimple, you haven't shown me the portrait yet; where is it?\"  \"In the library. Come, we'll go there now.\"  \"My, but it's dark in here!\" Florence exclaimed, as they entered the room. \"Let us open the shutters a little so we can see the picture.\"  This they managed to do, shutting the window carefully.  \"It seems dark still,\" Dimple remarked. \"I wonder what makes this such a dark room.\" Just then they heard a mighty crash and both started, then clung to each other, whispering, \"What's that?\"  \"It is thunder,\" said Dimple, when a second peal was heard. \"Oh, how dark it is. Come, Florence; we must hurry. Open the window and shut the shutters as quick as you can and I'll go to the dining-room. We must leave everything as we found it.\"  \"Don't leave me,\" Florence implored. \"I can't bear to be alone when the lightning flashes so.\" And together they fastened the shutters and the windows, then ran to the porch, where they had left their dolls.  An angry gust was blowing the dust about furiously. The trees swayed and creaked, lashing "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19025"],["title","A Sweet Little Maid (#6)"],["body","branches about in a very terrifying way. The thunder growled and muttered, while sharp flashes of lightning zigzagged across the sky almost incessantly.  \"We would never dare to go down the tree while it is blowing so,\" said Florence, after they had surveyed the scene for a moment in silence.  \"But it is beginning to rain. Oh, dear! What shall we do? It's coming down a perfect torrent. Come back, Florence; we'll have to go inside,\" cried Dimple. And snatching up their dolls, they retreated into the house in no enviable state of mind, between fear of the tempest and alarm at being obliged to stay alone where they were.  \"We might as well make ourselves comfortable,\" Florence said at last. \"Suppose we go down to the library or the dining-room. We can open the inside shutters, and it won't seem so gloomy. I'd rather see the lightning than stay up here in the dark.\"  \"Oh, dear! I wish we hadn't come at all,\" sighed Dimple. \"I wish we were safe at home. Mamma will be so worried, for she won't know where we are. I do wish we hadn't come.\"  Florence was very uncomfortable, but she tried to brave it out. \"Anyhow,\" she said, \"it's a great deal better than to be out in the storm. I am sure auntie will be very glad when she knows we were safe here, and it isn't as if you had come to a perfectly strange house. The Atkinsons are your friends, and they won't mind a bit our coming here for shelter. I know they won't. They'd be very hard-hearted if they did mind.\"  \"Yes, I s'pose so,\" returned Dimple, somewhat comforted.  \"Very likely your mamma isn't bothering at all about us,\" Florence went on. \"She probably hasn't gone home herself, on account of the storm.\"  They had been conversing together at the top of the stairs, and now made their way to the dining-room, where, after opening the shutters, they stood looking out at the rain. The peals of thunder had died away into distant mutterings, but it was still raining hard.  \"Somehow we always get into trouble when it rains,\" Dimple remarked.  \"Don't let's talk about that,\" returned Florence. \"See how the raindrops dance up and down. Little water fairies they are. Don't they look as if they were having a good time?\"  \"Yes; but I'm getting hungry. I wonder if it isn't most dinner time. Do you suppose it will rain all afternoon, Florence?\"  \"I don't know. If it holds up we'll have to run between the drops.\"  \"But how can we get out? We could never climb down that sopping wet tree, and we would be very wicked to leave any part of the house down here unfastened. Some one might see us and try to get in.\"  They lapsed into a grave silence which was presently broken by a startled \"What's that?\" from Dimple. She heard a sound like the click of a key turning in a latch. They listened fearfully, as the sound was followed by the shutting of a door, and the noise of footsteps along the hall. The two girls looked at each other. \"Let's hide,\" whispered Florence, but before they had decided what to do, a man was seen standing in the doorway. It was Mr. Atkinson.  \"Well, well, well,\" he exclaimed, \"where did you little girls come from? You came in out of the rain, I suppose, but how did you manage it? Why, Eleanor, is it you? I declare, I didn't know you. It is fortunate you managed to escape the storm; it was a hard one.\"  Dimple stood very much confused, her color coming and going, and her eyes very bright. But she summoned up courage to make the confession: \"We did come in out of the rain, Mr. Atkinson, but no one let us in, and we didn't happen to come here on account of the storm.\"  \"You didn't! Come here, then, and tell me about it.\" He drew her to his side and looked down at her very kindly.  She dropped her eyes and hung her head in confusion, but she went on, \"We,--we thought it was so pretty here, and--and we thought you wouldn't mind if we came and brought our dolls and sat on the porch a little while; we didn't think you'd care if we were very good and didn't touch anything. Then it was so easy to climb the tree and get on the other porch, and when we got there,--why I wanted to show Florence the portrait of your little girl, and we did not have to force the shutter at all; it opened just as easy, and so did the window; and we went downstairs, and while we were looking at the portrait the storm came up and we were afraid to climb down the tree; it was blowing about so, and we didn't like to go out any other way and leave the windows downstairs unfastened. So--we stayed.\"  Mr. Atkinson listened quietly. \"So you were housebreakers. Don't you know that's a prison offence? Burglary is a pretty serious crime.\" He looked very serious, and Dimple did not see the twinkle in his eyes. Her own grew round with horror.  \"Oh!\" she gasped. \"Oh! we didn't mean--\" The tears began to gather, and the child's lips quivered. She was overcome with dismay. \"I am so sorry, so dreadfully sorry,\" she quavered.  Mr. Atkinson put his hand on her sunny head. \"There, dear, never mind,\" he said, \"you were a very innocent pair of housebreakers, and you are a very brave and honest little girl to tell me the truth about it, when you might easily have allowed me to think it happened another way. Of course, on general principles, it isn't right to break into any one's house, but I think you may have done me a good turn by letting me know about that weak place upstairs, and you may have prevented a real thief from breaking in. You see, I come down from the city every Saturday to look after things while my wife and son are away, and I am glad I happened to be here just now. Let us forget all about the unpleasant part of this, and make ourselves comfortable. You are my guests. Who is your little friend?\"  \"My cousin Florence.\"  \"Ah, yes. I am glad to see you, Florence. Now don't you think it would be wise, Eleanor, if I were to speak to your father over the 'phone, and let him know you are safe?\"  \"Oh, yes, thank you. Is there a telephone in the house?\"  \"Yes, and I can call up your father at his office. You can speak to him yourself, if you like. What time does he go home to dinner?\"  \"About half-past one o'clock.\"  Mr. Atkinson consulted his watch. \"We shall catch him, I think.\" And in a few minutes Dimple, listening, heard her father's voice in reply to Mr. Atkinson's \"Hallo! is that you, Dallas?\"  \"Don't you want to speak to him yourself?\" asked Mr. Atkinson, when he had told Mr. Dallas that Dimple and her cousin were safely housed. He lifted the little girl up so she could call her father. \"I'm safe here, papa, and so is Florence,\" she said; \"please tell mamma.\"  The answer came, \"I will, daughter; I'm glad you are in good hands. I'll tell mamma to send Bubbles for you when it has stopped raining.\"  \"Let them stay till I take them home,\" spoke up Mr. Atkinson. \"I can take care of them, and it will be a great pleasure to have them here.\"  \"Very well, if you like. I shall be satisfied to have them in such safe hands. Good-bye,\" came Mr. Dallas's parting words.  \"Good-bye,\" and Mr. Atkinson hung up the receiver, and turned to his guests. \"Now, young ladies, I suspect you are hungry. I am, for one. Suppose we see what we can find to eat.\" He took out his keys and unlocked the pantry door. The girls looked at each other. There were delightful possibilities before them.  \"I'll forage in here,\" continued Mr. Atkinson, \"while you set the table. You'll find dishes in there.\" And he pointed to a china-closet.  This was such an unexpected outcome of the morning's affair, that the two little girls retired behind the door and hugged each other, and then briskly went to work to set the table, upon which Mr. Atkinson placed various articles.  \"I keep a lot of such truck in here,\" he told them. \"So, in case I get hungry, I can find a bite to eat. Do you like sardines or canned salmon best?\"  \"Sardines!\" exclaimed both the girls.  \"That settles it. We haven't any ice, or we could have some lemonade. We'd better have chocolate. What do you say?\"  \"It would be very nice, but we have no fire.\"  \"Fire enough. See here.\" He turned on the gas, and lighted a little stove over which the chocolate was made, condensed milk being at hand for use.  \"Now, let me see. I've some ginger-snaps somewhere, and some marmalade. This is rather a mixed meal, I am thinking, but it will keep us from starving.\"  \"I should think so,\" said Florence, surveying the table. \"I think it is fine.\"  \"And we can wash the dishes afterward. Will you let us?\" asked Dimple.  \"I shall be charmed to have you,\" Mr. Atkinson assured her. \"It was one of the points upon which I felt uncertain. I confess to disliking, very much, that part of the business; and now you relieve my anxiety.\"  They made a merry meal of it, and became very well acquainted with their host before it was over. He told them funny stories and kept them laughing so that they were a long time getting their appetites satisfied, and as it had become much cooler, Bubbles appeared with wraps for them before they had finished with the dishes.  \"We have had such a lovely, lovely time,\" said Dimple, as she raised a beaming face to Mr. Atkinson. \"You know just what to do to make little girls have a good time, don't you?\"  He stooped and kissed her. \"I had a little girl once,\" he replied, gravely.  Dimple put her two arms closely around his neck. She felt so very, very sorry when she remembered pretty little Stella. \"I'd like to be your little girl, if I had to be any one's but papa's and mamma's,\" she whispered.  \"Thank you, dear child, I appreciate that. It is a very great compliment,\" he answered, slowly. \"I want you two little girls to come over whenever you can. I am always here on Saturday afternoons. Will you come to see me often?\"  \"If mamma will let us. I'm afraid maybe she will not, because we were naughty about coming when we had no right to.\"  \"Well, we'll see how we can manage it. I will tell your father about it, myself, or, better still, I will walk home with you, and you can tell your story"]]]
