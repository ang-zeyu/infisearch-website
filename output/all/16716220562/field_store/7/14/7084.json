He discharged this duty very faithfully; and before he reached his objective point he was confident he could draw a map of the region, with what information he had obtained before, which would meet the requirements of Captain Breaker.  \"What's that?\" demanded Graines, suddenly placing his hand on the arm of his companion, and stopping short, as they were approaching the crown of the elevation.  A fire was burning on the ground in a depression of the surface, which doubtless concealed its light from persons in the vicinity of the fort, if there were any there. Around it could be seen four men, as the two officers looked over the crest of the hill, who appeared to be engaged in eating and drinking; and they were doing more of the latter than of the former, for the bottle passed very frequently from one to another.  \"It looks like a bivouac on the part of those fellows,\" said Christy in a low tone.  \"But who and what are they?\" asked Graines.  \"They may be deserters from Fort Morgan, though if they were they would hardly bivouac so near it,\" replied Christy, who did not seem to his companion to be at all disturbed by the discovery of the men. \"They are more likely to be sailors from some intending blockade-runner at anchor off the point, who have come on shore to make a night of it; and they appear to have made considerable progress in the debauch.\"  \"They are not soldiers, for you can see by the light of the fire that they are not dressed in uniform,\" added the engineer.  \"This is the third year of the war, and uniforms for the soldiers are not particularly abundant in the Confederacy.\"  \"We can't see the waters of the bay till we reach the top of the knoll yonder, and we don't know whether there are any vessels at anchor there or not. But we can easily avoid these fellows by keeping behind the ridge till we get where they cannot see us.\"  \"I don't know that we want to avoid them, for I should like very much to know who and what they are. They must be tipsy to a greater or less degree by this time, for they do twice as much drinking as eating,\" answered Christy, as he advanced a little way farther up the hill. \"They have a basket of food, and I do not believe they are mere tramps. They are more likely to be engaged in some occupation which brought them to this point, and I think we had better fraternize with them. They may be able to give us some valuable information; and it looks as though they were drunk enough to tell all they know without making any difficulty about it.\"  \"Do you think it is quite prudent, Mr. Passford, to approach them?\" asked the engineer.  \"When we come on an excursion of this kind we have to take some risk. If I were alone I should not hesitate to join them, and take my chances, for they must know something about affairs in this vicinity,\" replied Christy in a quiet tone, so that his answer might not be interpreted as a boast or a reproach to his companion.  \"I am ready to follow you, Mr. Passford, wherever you go, and to depend upon your judgment for guidance,\" said Graines very promptly. \"If it comes to a fight with those fellows, I beg you to understand that I will do my full share of it, and obey your orders to the letter.\"  \"Of course I have no doubt whatever in regard to your courage and your readiness to do your whole duty, Mr. Graines,\" added Christy, as he led the way to the summit of the elevation. \"Now lay aside your grammar and rhetoric, and we must be as good fellows as those bivouackers are making themselves. We are simply sailors who have just escaped from a captured blockade-runner.\"  \"I don't see anything around the fire that looks like muskets,\" said the engineer, as they descended from the elevation.  \"I see nothing at all except the provision-basket and the bottles,\" replied Christy.  \"But they may be armed for all that.\"  \"We must take our chances. They are so busy eating and drinking that they have not seen us yet. Perhaps we had better be a little hilarious,\" continued the lieutenant, as he began to sing, \"We won't go home till morning,\" in which he was joined by his companion as vigorously as the circumstances would permit.  Singing as they went, and with a rolling gait, they approached the revellers.     CHAPTER IV  THE REVELATIONS OF THE REVELLERS   \"'We won't go home till morning,'\" sang the two counterfeit revellers, as they approached the fire of the bivouackers.  The four carousel's sprang to their feet when the first strain reached their ears. They were not as intoxicated as they might have been, for they were able to stand with considerable firmness on their feet, after the frequency with which the bottle had been passed among them. They did not do what soldiers would naturally have done at such an interruption, grasp their muskets, and it was probable they had no muskets to grasp.  \"'We won't go home till morning, till daylight doth appear,'\" continued the two officers, without halting in their march towards the revellers.    [Illustration: \"The two counterfeit revellers.\" Page 48.]  No weapons of any kind were exhibited; but the tipplers stood as though transfixed with astonishment or alarm where they had risen, but were rather limp in their attitude. They evidently did not know what to make of the interruption, and they appeared to be waiting for further developments on the part of the intruders.  \"It isn't mornin' yit, but we just emptied our bottle,\" said Christy, with a swaggering and slightly reeling movement, and suiting his speech to the occasion. \"How are ye, shipmates?\"  \"Up to G, jolly tars,\" replied one of the men, with a broad grin on his face. \"We done got two full bottles left, at your sarvice.\"  \"Much obleeged,\" returned the lieutenant, as he took the bottle the reveller passed to him. \"Here's success to us all in a heap, and success to our side in the battle that's go'n' on.\"  \"I'm with you up to the armpits,\" added Graines, as another of the four handed him a bottle.  One sniff at the neck of the bottle was enough to satisfy Christy, who was a practical temperance man of the very strictest kind, and he had never drank a glass of anything intoxicating in all his life. The bottle contained \"apple-jack,\" or apple-brandy, the vilest fluid that ever passed a tippler's gullet. He felt obliged to keep up his character, taken for the occasion, and he retained the mouth of the bottle at his lips long enough to answer the requirement of the moment; but he did not open them, or permit a drop of the nauseous and fiery liquor to pollute his tongue. It was necessary for him to consider that he was struggling for the salvation of his beloved country to enable him even to go through the form of \"taking a drink.\"  Graines was less scrupulous on the question of temperance, and he took a swallow of the apple-jack; but that was enough for him, for he had never tasted anything outside of the medicine-chest which was half as noxious. If he had been compelled to keep up the drinking, he would have realized that his punishment was more than he could bear. Fortunately the tipplers had no tumblers, so that the guests were not compelled to pour out the fluid and drink it off. All drank directly from the bottles, so that the two officers could easily conceal in the semi-darkness the extent of their indulgence.  \"Who be you, strangers?\" asked the man who had acted thus far as spokesman of the party.  \"My name is Tom Bulger, born and brought up in the island of Great Abaco, and this feller is my friend and shipmate, Sam Riley,\" replied Christy, twisting and torturing his speech as much as was necessary. \"Now who be you fellers?\"  \"Born and fetched up in Mobile: my name is Bird Riley; and I reckon t'other feller is a first cousin of mine, for he's got the same name, and he's almost as handsome as I am. Where was you born, Sam?\"  \"About ten miles up the Alabama, where my father was the overseer on a plantation before the war,\" replied Graines as promptly as though he had been telling the truth.  \"Then you must be one of my cousins, for I done got about two hundred and fifty on 'em in the State of Alabammy. Give us your fin, Sam.\"  Bird Riley and Sam shook hands in due and proper form, and the relationship appeared to be fully established. The names of the three other revellers were given, but the spokesman was disposed to do all the talking, though he occasionally appealed to his companions to approve of what he said. It was evident that he was the leading spirit of the party, and that he controlled them. He was rather a bright fellow, while the others were somewhat heavy and stupid in their understanding. The bottles were again handed to the guests, both of whom went through the form of drinking without taking a drop of the vile stuff.  \"What be you uns doin' here?\" asked Bird Riley, after the ceremony with the bottle had been finished.  \"We was both tooken in a schooner that was gwine to run the blockade,\" answered Christy. \"We was comin' out'n Pass Christian, and was picked up off Chand'leer [Chandeleur] Island, and fotched over hyer. We didn't feel too much to hum after we lost our wages, and we done took a whaleboat and came ashore here, with only one bottle of whiskey atween us. That's all there is on't. Now, how comes you uns hyer?\"  \"I'm the mate of the topsail schooner West Wind, and t'others is the crew; all but two we done left on board with the cap'n,\" replied Bird, apparently with abundant confidence in his newly found friends.  \"You left her?\" asked Christy.  \"That's just what we done do.\"  \"Where is the West Wind now?\" inquired Christy, deeply interested in the subject at this point.  \"She done come down from Mobile three days ago, and done waited for a chance to run the blockade. Her hole is full o' cotton, and she done got a deck-load too,\" answered Bird Riley without any hesitation.  \"Where does the West Wind keep herself now, Bird?\"  \"Just inside the p'int, astern "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18678"],["title","A Victorious Union (#5)"],["body","the Trafladagar.\"  \"The Trafladagar?\" repeated Christy.  \"That's her name, or sunthin like it. I never see it writ out.\"  \"She's a schooner, I reckon,\" continued Christy, concealing what knowledge he possessed in regard to the vessel.  \"She ain't no schooner, you bet; she's jest the finist steamer that ever runned inter Mobile, and they've turned her into a cruiser,\" Bird Riley explained.  \"How big is she?\"  \"I heerd some un say she was about eight hun'ed tons: an' I'll bet she'll pick up every Yankee craft that she gits a sight on.\"  \"And you say the Trafladagar is at anchor off the p'int?\" added Christy, not daring to call the steamer by her true name.  \"That's jest where she is; and the West Wind is hitched to her, like a tandem team,\" replied Bird Riley. \"Look yere, Tom Bulger, you don't make love to that bottle as though you meant business. Take another drink, and show you done got some manhood in yer.\"  The bottle went the rounds again, and the guests apparently took long pulls; but really they did not taste a drop of the infernal liquid.  \"That's good pizen, Bird Riley; but it is not jest the stingo that I like best,\" said Christy, as he wiped his mouth with his sleeve in proper form, for he did not like the smell of the fluid lightning that clung to his lips.  \"Whiskey suits me most; but they waste the corn makin' bread on't, and there ain't much on't left to make the staff of life. Howsomever, we don't choke to death on apple-jack, when we can get enough on't,\" argued Bird Riley.  \"Jest now you got a tandem team hitched up out on the Trafladagar and the West Wind,\" continued Christy cautiously, and with apparent indifference, drawing the mate of the schooner back to the matter in which he was the most deeply interested. \"What's this team hitched up that way for? Is the steamer go'n' to tow the schooner up to Mobile?\"  \"I reckon you're a little more'n half drunk, Tom Bulger,\" replied Bird Riley, with a vigorous horse laugh. \"Tow the schooner up to Mobile! Didn't I tell yer the Trafladagar's been waiting here three days for a good chance to run out?\"  \"You said that as true as you was born,\" added Graines, who thought it necessary to say something, for he had been nearly silent from the beginning.  \"Sam Riley ain't quite so drunk as you be, Tom Bulger; an' he knows what's what; and thar he shows the Riley blood in his carcass,\" chuckled the mate.  \"And you said the West Wind was loaded with cotton, in the hole and on deck,\" added Graines, hoping to hurry the conference along a little more rapidly.  \"That's jest what I said. I reckon you ain't much used to apple-jack, fur it fusticates your intelleck, and makes yer forget how old y'are. Come, take another, jest to set your head up right,\" said Bird, passing the bottle to Christy, who was doing his best to keep up the illusion by talking very thick, and swaying his body about like a drunken man.  Both the guests went through the ceremony of imbibing, which was only a ceremony to them. The fire had exhausted its supply of fuel, and it was fortunate that the darkness prevented the revellers from measuring the quantity left in the bottles as they were returned to the owners, or they might have seen that the strangers were not doing their share in consuming the poison.  \"Sam Riley does honor to the blood as runs in his body, for he ain't no more drunk'n I am; an' he knows what we been talkin' about,\" said the mate, who seemed to be greatly amused at the supposed effect of the liquor upon Christy. \"You won't know nothin' about the Trafladagar or the West Wind in half an hour from now, Tom Bulger. I reckon it don't make no difference to you about the tandem team, and to-morrer mornin' you won't know how the team's hitched up.\"  \"I don't think I will,\" replied Christy boozily, as he rolled over on the sand, and then struggled for some time to resume his upright position, to the great amusement of Bird Riley and his companions. \"But Sam Riley's got blood in him, the best blood in Alabammy, and he kin tell you all about it if yer want ter know. He kin stan' up agin a whole bottle o' apple-jack.\"  \"I say, Cousin Bird, what's this tandem team hitched up fer?\" asked Graines, permitting his superior officer to carry out the illusion upon which he had entered, in order more effectually to blind the mate, and induce him to talk with entire freedom.  \"I reckon you ain't too drunk to un'erstan' what I say, Sam, as t'other feller is.\"  \"I'm jest drunk enough to un'erstan' yer, Cousin Bird; but I cal'late I won't know much about it by to-morrer mornin',\" added Graines.  \"Let's take another round, Sam; but I reckon Tom Bulger's got more'n he can kerry now,\" continued the mate.  Bird took a long draught from the bottle, and then passed it to his guest. Three of the four revellers had already toppled over at full length on the ground; and Christy thought he could hurry matters by doing the same thing, and he tumbled over all in a heap. Graines drank nothing himself, though he contrived to spill a quantity of the fluid on the ground, so that it might not seem too light to his only remaining wakeful companion. The last dram of Bird had been a very heavy one, and the engineer realized that he could not hold out much longer.  \"What's that tandem team fer?\" asked Graines, in the thickest of tones, while he swayed back and forth as Bird was doing by this time.  \"The Trafladagar's gwine to tow the West Wind out; and both on 'em's sure to be tooken,\" stammered the mate. \"We uns don't bleeve in't, and so we runned away, and left Captain Sullendine to paddle his own punt. They get off at three in the morn in'.\"  Bird Riley took another drink, and then he toppled over.     CHAPTER V  IN THE VICINITY OF THE CONFEDERATE FORT   It was a favorable night for running the blockade, for the fog had settled down more densely upon the region in the vicinity of the ship channel, though it occasionally lifted, and permitted those on board of the Bellevite to see the tall tower of the Sand Island Lighthouse, which had not been illuminated for three years. The mists were generally thicker and remained longer towards daylight than at any other time, and this was the evident reason why three o'clock in the morning had been fixed upon for the departure of the Trafalgar and the West Wind in tow.  The engineer's head was as clear as it had ever been, notwithstanding the tipsy swaying and doubling-up of his body which he simulated, and he realized that his companion and himself had obtained very important revelations from the revellers. The hour at which the steamer was to leave, evidently by arrangement with the officers of the fort, was valuable knowledge, and he hoped they would be able to carry or send seasonable warning of the time to the Bellevite, for she was the only ship on the blockade that could be counted upon to overhaul the Trafalgar, if the reports of her great speed had been correctly given.  Both Christy and Graines had listened attentively to the revelations of Bird Riley; but neither of them could understand why the four men, including the mate, had deserted the West Wind only a few hours before she was to depart on her voyage to Nassau, where she was believed to be bound. The reason assigned by the tipsy mate was that she was going out in tow of the steamer, and was sure to be taken by the blockaders. Both of the listeners thought this fact improved her chances of getting clear of any possible pursuers.  Bird Riley had fallen back on the ground; but he still continued to talk, though his speech was very nearly incoherent. Graines was very anxious to know what time it was, for the most important part of the enterprise was to give the Bellevite timely notice of the coming of the Trafalgar. He struck a match and lighted a cigar, offering one to the mate, which he took and lighted. It was half-past twelve by his watch, as he informed Bird, though he did so more for the information of the lieutenant than of the mate.  \"I reckon we are all about full enough to go to sleep, and we might as well turn in,\" said Graines. \"But I suppose you uns mean to sleep on board of the West Wind.\"  \"I don't reckon we'll do nothin' o' that sort,\" hiccoughed the mate. \"We done got a p'int to kerry, and I reckon we're gwine to kerry it.\"  \"All right,\" gobbled the engineer, who overdid his part, if anything. \"What's the p'int, shipmate?\"  \"Cap'n Sull'dine's sho't handed,\" replied the mate, his speech turning somersets as he labored to utter the words, for he still had a portion of his senses left.  \"I see,\" added Graines, tumbling over, but regaining his perpendicularity with a trying effort. \"Only six men left after you four done runned away.\"  \"Six!\" exclaimed Bird, raising himself up with a desperate struggle, like a wounded hawk. \"No six in it; only two left. He don't, can't no how, go to sea with only two men. I'll pilot the schooner out by the Belican Channel an' Mis'sip' Sound. Cap'n Sull'dine 'n' I fit over it, an' I left, with most of the crew. Hah, ha, ha! He done got 'nuff on't! Let's take a swigger, and then we gwine to go to sleep, like the rest on 'em.\"  With no little difficulty Bird Riley got the bottle to his lips, wasting no little of the liquor in the operation. He was entirely \"full\" then. He handed the bottle to the engineer, and dropped over on his back, overcome by his frequent potions. Graines did not find it necessary to go through the form of putting the bottle to his lips again, and after waiting a few minutes he was satisfied that the mate was in a deep slumber, from which he was not likely to wake for several hours.  But all the information he appeared to be capable of giving had been imparted, and Graines rose to his feet as steady as he ever was in his life, having taken hardly a swallow of the repulsive poison. He walked away from the sleeping group on the ground, halting about twenty feet from them. Christy saw him, for his eyes were open all the time, and he had listened with "]]]
