I have sent Bubbles for a book, and I will read to you, to pass the time away.\"  Six o'clock came at last, and soon after Dimple heard her papa's voice in the hall.  \"Come right up,\" she heard him say.  \"I do believe he has brought the white girl,\" she said, clasping her hands; and, to be sure, when he opened the door, some one was behind him.  \"This is the nearest like you I could get,\" he said, and led forward some one in a grey frock and hat.  Dimple screamed, \"Why, it is Florence. Oh! papa, you didn't say you were going to auntie's!\"  \"No. I wanted to surprise you,\" he replied. \"And I thought your own cousin ought to be more like you than any one else.\"  \"Well, I am delighted. You are sure to stay a long, long time, Florence. Take off your hat and sit right here,\" she said, moving up on the lounge. \"I never had such a surprise.\"  \"You forgot I promised a doll, too,\" said her papa, as he opened a package. \"I thought Florence would like one, so I brought two, as near alike as if they were cousins,\" he added.  \"Oh! you preciousest papa,\" said Dimple; \"let me hug you all to pieces. I do think you are the most delightful man. I don't wonder mamma married you. When you go down please send Bubbles up here, so I can tell her I am almost glad she cut my foot, for it is worth it, to have Florence and a new doll too.\"  Bubbles came in beaming.  \"Bubbles,\" cried Dimple, \"see Florence and our new dolls,--and Bubbles, you shall have one of my old ones,--and Bubbles, when I grow up, you shall live with me always, because you cut my foot, and you must never, never think of the orphan asylum again.  \"Now, tell me, Florence,\" she said, turning to her, \"all about your coming. Didn't you have to get ready in a hurry?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" replied Florence, \"and, oh Dimple, I was so glad when uncle asked mamma and she said 'yes,' and she just packed up my things in a jiffy, and we stopped at papa's office, and said good-bye to him, and uncle bought me oranges and papers on the cars, and we didn't seem a bit long coming.\"  \"Well, I am too glad,\" returned Dimple. \"Won't we have fun with the dolls? O, Florence, do eat your supper up here with me instead of going downstairs.\"  \"Of course,\" said Florence, \"unless you would rather go down, for uncle said he would carry you.\"  \"I know,\" said Dimple, \"but it is more fun to have it up here with my tea-set, and Bubbles to wait on us.\"  So they had their tea upstairs, with the table set by the window, where the wistaria peeped in to look at them, and a little brown bird, quite envious, put his head on one side, and stood on the sill a full minute before he flew away.  \"Oh! I think it is just lovely here,\" said Florence. \"Ever so much nicer than at our house.\"  \"Do you think so?\" said Dimple, quite pleased. \"You have a lovely house, though, Florence; it is four stories high, and has such beautiful things in it, and when you look out of the windows there is so much to see, carriages, and people all dressed up.\"  \"Yes, and dirty old beggars and ragmen,\" said Florence, \"and nasty, muddy streets.\"  They both laughed.  \"What cunning little doylies,\" said Florence. \"Who worked the little figures on them?\"  \"Mamma,\" said Dimple. \"Aren't they sweet? She always sends them up with my supper, one over the milk pitcher, and one over the cake. Do you like lots of sugar in your tea, Florence?\"  \"Two lumps.\"  \"Only two! Why I like three, and I believe I could take another; mamma says I have a sweet tooth, but I don't know where it is, for I have put my tongue on all of them and they all taste alike. Bubbles, go down and ask mamma if we mayn't have a little teensy-weensy bit more honey, we are both so hungry.\"  Bubbles took the little glass dish, and went off.  \"I wish I had a Bubbles,\" said Florence. \"We have a black man, but I think a little girl is ever so much nicer; then there is nurse, she takes us to walk; and then there is Kate, the cook, and Lena, the chambermaid, they are always fussing and quarreling. I get tired of so many.\"  \"We only have Sylvy and Bubbles,\" said Dimple. \"Sylvy is black too; she is real nice but she will get mad with Bubbles sometimes. Bubbles cleans knives, and runs errands, sets the table, wipes the dishes, and is a lot of help. You don't know how much she can do, and she learns something new every little while. Have some more honey, Florence, for that piece of bread. I never can come out even; sometimes I have to take more bread for the honey, and then more honey for the bread, till I do eat so much. Have you finished? I believe I have too.\"  \"It is _so_ nice here,\" said Florence, as they settled themselves after their tea, \"just delicious. It is so much pleasanter to see green grass, and trees, and flowers, than brick walls, and pavements. Do you play out of doors much?\"  \"Yes, all day, nearly; but I haven't since my foot was hurt. I couldn't run about, and I should have to wait for some one to bring me in; then I always want to be close to mamma when anything is the matter with me. Are you that way?\"  \"Yes,\" said Florence. \"Aren't mammas the best thing in the world? I hope mine doesn't miss me.\"  \"Now, Florence, don't get homesick, for I shall be distressed if you do. Let's talk about the dolls. Here comes mamma. We will ask her what we can dress them in.  \"Mamma, mamma, did you see our beauty dolls? Won't you get out your reserve bag to-morrow? I have looked over my piece box so much, and it would be perfectly splendid to have something I had never seen before.\"  \"What is a reserve bag?\" asked Florence.  \"Why, you see,\" said Dimple, \"mamma has a lot of bags, one for silk pieces, and one for white pieces, and one for pieces like our frocks, and so on, but the nicest is the one she keeps for occasions, like Christmas and birthdays and fairs, and there are the prettiest bits of velvet and silk in it. Mamma, bring out your reserve bag, that is a lovely blue-eyed mamma,\" said Dimple, coaxingly.  \"You are very complimentary,\" said her mamma, laughing. \"If you won't tease or worry me, to-morrow I will bring it out and you can each choose what you want.\"  \"Oh! mamma, you are lovelier and more blue-eyed than ever,\" said Dimple, \"let us both kiss you. We will be good as gold, won't we, Florence?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said she. \"Auntie, you are lovely.\"  \"I think if you don't go to bed,\" said Mrs. Dallas, \"you will keep me awake all night with your flattery.\"  \"Florence is to sleep with me, isn't she, mamma?\"  \"Certainly, and the sooner you go, the sooner it will be to-morrow.\"  \"Well, we will go now. See me ride, Florence,\" said Dimple, as her mamma put her in a rocking-chair and pushed the chair along through the door into Dimple's little blue and white room.  It was a dear little room, and Dimple, with the help of Bubbles, took care of it all herself.  There was a white curtained window around which roses and honeysuckle grew, and threw their tendrils about in a such a reckless way, that one or two had made up their minds to live in the room instead of outdoors, and were climbing around the window sash.  A little brass bedstead, a mantel with a blue and white lambrequin, a blue and white toilet set, pretty pictures on the wall, and a small bookshelf, made a very cozy looking nest for a little girl, and so Florence thought, who had no room of her own, but slept with an older sister.  They were both tired, and even the delightful topic of dolls could not keep them awake very long, for a half hour later when the moon looked in on her way across the sky, she saw them both sound asleep, an auburn head on Florence's pillow, and a yellow one on Dimple's.     CHAPTER II  Dolls   Florence and Dimple were on the back porch where it was always cool in the morning.  Bubbles was cleaning knives on the steps, the temptation to watch the dressing of the dolls being too great to keep her in the kitchen.  \"I declare,\" said Dimple, \"we haven't named them yet.\"  \"That is so,\" returned Florence.  \"You take first choice, then,\" said Dimple. \"I shall have to think, for I've had a Rose and a Violet and a Lily, besides one named Victoria, and one Aurelia.\"  Florence sat still watching Bubbles briskly scouring her knives. \"Dear me,\" she said, presently, \"it's awfully hard. How do you suppose our mothers found names for us?\"  \"Oh! that was easy enough,\" answered Dimple. \"I was named Eleanor after your mamma, and you were named Florence after mine; but, you see we are not sisters, so we can't do that. I'll tell you what let's do; you tell mamma the names you like best, and I will tell her those I like; then she can write them down and put them in a hat, and we will draw lots for them.\"  \"That will be a good plan,\" said Florence. \"She is coming now with the reserve bag.\"  \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" they cried, as Mrs. Dallas shook out its contents.  \"Let Florence choose first, dear,\" said she as Dimple began making dives at the fluttering ends of silk. \"You may each have two pieces.\"  Dimple looked a little disappointed; being an only child she was used to first choice herself, but she yielded with a very good grace.  Florence finally chose a piece of maroon satin, and another of yellow brocaded velvet, while Dimple picked out a piece of silk with velvet stripes of a lovely pink, and another bit of blue silk brocade. \"Mamma,\" whispered she, \"give Bubbles a little piece, if she is black,\" and so the brightest bit of scarlet was picked out for Bubbles, who was made perfectly happy by it.  \"Now, names,\" exclaimed Dimple, as the rest of the pieces were returned to the bag. \"First Florence one and then I one. How many, Florence?\"  \"Four, I think. Ethel first, for me. No, you choose first, Dimple. I had first choice in the pieces.\"  \"No, you're company.\"  Being company, Florence took her rights, and Ethel went down.  \"Blanche, for me, mamma,\" said Dimple.  \"And Celestine for me, auntie.\"  \"Irene,\" said Dimple.  \"Geraldin"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19025"],["title","A Sweet Little Maid (#2)"],["body","e,\" said Florence.  \"Adele,\" said Dimple.  \"My last,\" said Florence. \"Rubina.\"  \"Oh, what a lovely name!\" exclaimed Dimple. \"If you don't draw it, I should like it, so I won't say any more till you have drawn.\"  The slips were shaken up in a hat, and Florence, with eyes shut, drew out Celestine.  \"I am glad,\" she said. \"I believe I like that best; it has a sort of a heavenly sound, and my doll is angelic.\"  \"Well, mamma, I will take Rubina. You don't care, do you, Florence?\"  \"No, indeed. I am glad you like it.\"  \"Now they are named, we will dress them.\"  \"How are you going to dress yours, Dimple?\"  \"I think I'll have a skirt of the blue and a waist of the pink. No, the other way, will look best, because the velvet is thickest, the skirt of pink and the waist of blue.\"  \"Well, I will have to make my doll's frock of all the same, with velvet trimming. Will that look well?\"  \"Lovely! What are you going to do with your piece, Bubbles?\"  \"Make a overskirt for Floridy Alabamy,\" said Bubbles, importantly.  \"Who?\" said Dimple, with her scissors ready to cut into the pink.  \"Floridy Alabamy,\" said Bubbles, gravely.  \"What a name!\" shrieked Dimple, throwing back her head in a fit of laughter. \"Florence, _did_ you hear? Floridy Alabamy.\"  And the girls laughed till the tears ran down their cheeks.  \"Bubbles, you are too ridiculous,\" said Dimple, while Bubbles pinned her bit of scarlet on her doll.  Just then Sylvy called her, and she ran off, holding her doll admiringly at arm's length.  \"She will dress it just like a darkey. You see,\" said Dimple, \"she has a purple dress on it now; think of that, with a scarlet overskirt; and I know she will make it a blue waist out of one of my old sash ribbons I gave her.\"  And sure enough, Floridy Alabamy did wear the three colors in triumph.  \"Do you like big or little dolls best?\" asked Florence.  \"I don't know,\" said Dimple. \"I think rather big or real little. Middle sizes are so hard to dress. They have to have such little fidgety sleeves and waists. I have two little dolls upstairs, and we can dress them up next. I believe one of them has an arm off, but it can be mended. How many dolls have you?\"  \"Four, now,\" answered Florence. \"I had five, but Gertrude broke one. Gertrude is such a mischief, I have to keep all my things locked up. I hope to goodness they won't let her get at them while I'm away.\"  \"Oh, you must make a traveling dress for your Celestine. I have a piece of grey linen that will just do.\"  By the time the dinner bell rang, both the dolls were dressed gorgeously.  \"Aren't they lovely, papa?\" said Dimple, as she hobbled out to meet him.  \"Yes; they look like two butterflies,\" he said, lifting her up, doll and all.  \"Are you having a good time, Florence? I hope Dimple hasn't pinched or scratched you yet.\"  \"Why, papa,\" said Dimple, looking very much hurt. \"Florence will think I am a regular little cat,\" but seeing a twinkle in his eyes, she knew he was only in fun, and was consoled by the kiss he gave her as he put her in her chair at the table.  There was a long afternoon before them, and, although Dimple could not walk very well with her bandaged foot, she managed to get down to her favorite place, under a big tree, where the grass was long and thick.  \"Now we can play beautifully with our dolls, Florence,\" she said, \"and have no one to disturb us, for Bubbles doesn't count. She has to be in the kitchen for a while anyhow.\"  They had not been out very long before Bubbles came running to them. \"There is a lady and a boy in the house, Miss Dimple,\" she said, \"and your mamma's a bringin' the boy out hyah.\"  \"A boy!\" said both the girls in horror.  \"Think of it, Florence, a horrid boy! What will we do with him? I can't run, and boys despise dolls. As for talking, I never could talk to boys. They shut me up like a clam. I always feel as if they wanted to get away, and I believe they would if they could,\" said Dimple in a disgusted tone.  But, by this time, Mrs. Dallas had come up to them.  \"This is Rock Hardy, girls,\" said she. \"As Dimple is a little lame, I brought him out here, rather than take her in the house,\" and so saying, she left them. There was a deep silence after they had shaken hands; all looking rather bashful for a few minutes.  Finally Rock took courage to say, \"What pretty dolls.\"  This was encouraging; Florence and Dimple exchanged pleased glances.  \"Do you think they are pretty?\" asked Dimple. \"I thought boys hated dolls.\"  \"I don't,\" said Rock. \"I played with them myself for a long time, and I have one now, but I don't play with it because I like to read better.\"  \"He _is_ a nice boy,\" thought the girls.  \"How funny,\" said Florence. \"How came you to play with dolls?\"  \"Why, you see, I haven't any brothers and sisters. When I was a little fellow I used to get so lonely, that my mother dressed a boy doll for me, and I talked to it and pretended it was another boy.\"  \"I haven't any brothers, or sisters either,\" said Dimple, \"but Florence has. I have Bubbles, though. Everybody can't have a Bubbles; she is next best to a sister, or a cousin.\"  \"Who is Bubbles?\" asked Rock.  \"She is the little colored girl you saw when you came out of the house; she has lived here ever since I was a baby; she is a year older than I am; her mother ran off and left her, and she is real nice to play with.\"  Dimple was fast getting over her embarrassment.  \"Don't you go to school?\" asked Rock.  \"No, mamma has always taught me at home, but I am going next year. It is vacation now.\"  \"Yes, I know,\" said Rock, \"that is why we came here. We are going to stay for some time. I like to play with girls. Will you let me come and play with you sometimes?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Dimple, in her warm-hearted way. \"My foot is nearly well, and I can soon run about. I think I should like to play with a nice boy.\"  \"I hope I'm a nice boy,\" said Rock, \"but I don't know. I suppose everybody is mean sometimes.\"  \"I think you look nice,\" said Dimple, honestly, looking at him from head to foot.  \"Why don't you say something, Florence?\"  Florence thus appealed to, could say nothing.  \"Florence is my cousin,\" said Dimple. \"She lives in Baltimore and she came here yesterday.\"  \"Why, I live in Baltimore,\" said Rock. \"What street do you live on, Florence?\"  Florence told him, and they found it was in the next street to that on which Rock lived, so they all began to feel like old friends.  \"If I had my scroll saw here, I could make you each a chair for your dolls,\" said Rock. \"Maybe my mother will let me send for it. I will ask her.\"  \"Oh, that would be lovely,\" said the girls.  \"And I will lend you some of my books to read,\" said Dimple. \"If you will please hand me that little cane, we will go in and you can choose them.\"  \"Oh, thank you,\" said Rock. \"I shall like to have them, for I like to read better than to do anything else.\"  They all went in and found Rock's mother and Mrs. Dallas in the parlor.  Dimple told her mamma what they had come for, and her mamma suggested her taking Rock into the library first, as he might find something there that he liked.  So Rock was taken to the bookcase, and found there a book of travels he had been wanting to read, so he bade them good-bye, with it under his arm, promising soon to come again.  Then Dimple and Florence returned to the garden where they had left a colony of grasshoppers imprisoned in a small house built for them out of bits of wood and bark.  \"Baby Grasshopper has gone,\" said Florence, in dismay, as she peeped in to see the prisoners.  \"I knew he would get out; he was so little,\" returned Dimple. \"Let's set them all free, Florence. We'll pretend that they escaped in the night, or that peace has been declared.\"  \"Or that a tornado blew down their prison.\"  \"Yes, that will be the best. We'll blow real hard, and maybe it will come down.\"  So, with cheeks much puffed out they blew and blew, but without avail, and finally they picked up their hats and fanned the little bark structure so vigorously that it toppled over, and the grasshoppers escaped in every direction, the children laughing to see how quickly they disappeared.  They sat there in the grass wondering what to do next when Dimple exclaimed, \"There comes papa with Mr. Coulter,--he's the carpenter, you know--I wonder what he is going to do. See, Mr. Coulter is measuring the ground, and papa is explaining something. I can tell by the way he keeps doing so, with his hand. He always does that when he is explaining. Help me up, Florence, and let's go over there and see what's going on. Papa must mean to have something built. I hope it isn't a fence. No, it can't be that, for it would be too near the other one. Isn't it funny to watch men talking? They do so many funny things. Mr. Coulter keeps nodding his head like a horse.\"  Florence laughed and they made their way over to where the two men stood. As soon as they were within speaking distance, Dimple began to put her questions. \"Are you going to build something, papa? What is it? Please don't say it's a fence, or a--a pig-sty.\"  Mr. Coulter chuckled as he went on laying his foot-rule along the ground.  \"I hope it won't turn into a pig-sty,\" Mr. Dallas replied, with a smile. \"It won't unless little pigs get into it.\"  \"Are you going to keep little pigs?\" Dimple asked.  \"I didn't say so.\"  \"Oh, papa, you are so mystiferious. I wish you would tell us all about it. What are you going to build? Any sort of house?\"  \"Yes, one sort of house.\"  \"What is it to be for?\"  \"Little chicks.\"  \"Ah!\" Dimple was quite satisfied. \"I see. You need a new hen house. Isn't the old one big enough? To be sure we don't get very many eggs just now, for so many of the hens are sitting. Oh, I know, maybe you are going to build a place like Mr. Lind's, with a--what is that thing? A inkybator. Are you going to have one of those? and a brooder? Are you, papa?\"  \"I haven't decided exactly what is to be in it, just yet. I think we'll let mamma see to that--she knows best what is "]]]
