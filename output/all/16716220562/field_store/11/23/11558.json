We must have good wagon roads, well built railroads, tunnels through the mountains, and bridges over the rivers. Lighthouses are necessary to warn the vessels of the rocks at night or in the storms.   4  When people need things from a distance they cannot always go all the way to the place and bring back the products or articles. It is quicker and easier to send messages asking for what is needed. How would your mother send an order to the butcher for meat if she did not wish to go for it? How could a farmer send a message to the city ordering new milk cans and strawberry boxes? How do messages come to your house?  In olden days the persons had to carry all of their messages for themselves or send them by other persons. The messenger would often run for miles without resting so as to deliver the letters as soon as possible. At last the people decided to give all of their letters to a postman who would ride on horseback from place to place with the mail. Stagecoaches were next used. It took a week for a coach to go as far as a train can go now in a few hours. Our mail is now carried from one place to another by trains or vessels, and then the letter carriers deliver it at our city houses or to our town post office or rural mail-box.  The quickest way to send a message is by cable, telegraph, telephone or wireless message. Over the electric wires or through the air the words are flashed for miles in a few minutes.     CHAPTER IX  FAMILIAR SURFACE FEATURES    1. Hill and plain.         3. River   2. Mountain and valley.    4. Ocean       5. Island and peninsula.      _Note to the Teacher._--Consider at this time only such familiar     features as belong to the children's immediate environment in or     very near their neighborhood. Defer the study of the other land and     water forms until later, as suggested in the Introduction. For     further details of these features, see Chapters I and IV in Part II.   1  HILL AND PLAIN  Some streets and roads are flat and level. Others slope like _hills_. Can you name a street which is level, and one that slants or slopes? Which road is easier to walk on? Why? Do you prefer the level or the sloping street when roller-skating? Why? Which is the best when you are coasting?  You may have noticed that some of the fields in the park or in the country are nearly flat. Other fields lie on slopes or hills. We call the flat part of the land a _plain_, whether it is in the city or in the country. The sloping part of the land forms a hill. Have we mostly hills or plains in the streets of our city?   2  Some plains and some hills are covered with trees. If you were in the woods, surrounded by trees, how would you know whether you were on a plain or on a hill?  [Illustration: HILLS AND VALLEYS.]  Some hills look very different from others. Some slope very gradually, while some are very steep. Some hills have city streets on them. Others have great fields of grass for cows to graze upon. Still others are planted with corn, wheat, rye or vegetables. There are wooded hills covered with trees. How do we know that all of these very different forms are hills?  In the same way plains vary greatly. While some have been made into city streets, others are large, flat, grassy fields, with streams sometimes flowing through them. Some plains are covered with forests. Others are planted with grain and vegetables. How can you know when you see a plain if there are so many different kinds?   3  Look through the pictures in this book and decide which show hills and which show plains. Which is easier for a farmer to plow, a hill or a plain? Why?  If you were sent upon an errand, would you choose to go by way of a hilly road or by a level one? Which is the pleasantest place for a summer home, upon a hill or upon a plain?  How must a driver help his horses when they are pulling a heavy load up or down a hill?   4  MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS  Some hills are so very, very high that they have been called _mountains_. What are our neighboring mountains named? Have you ever been to the top of one of these mountains? Describe the beautiful view from the summit. Did you see any wild creatures along the way? Tell about any trees and other plants that you noticed.  When people build homes in mountain regions they generally place them in the low land between the high mountains. Why? This lower land is called a _valley_. The people in the valley town can often look beyond the fields and see the mountains rising high and steep beyond. Some mountains are covered with trees. At places you may see great bare, rough rocks on the mountain side. The scenery is very beautiful. There are often streams and broad rivers down in the valley.  [Illustration: THE UPPER DELAWARE.]  Many lumbermen work on the mountains. Why do they cut down the trees? The mountains give the miners work too. The men go far into the mines to bring out the useful minerals. Are there any mines in the mountains near our home? What do the miners take from these mines?  [Illustration: AN OCEAN STEAMSHIP.   (Copyright, 1911, William H. Rau, Philadelphia.)]   5  RIVERS  What _river_ flows near our home? Have you ever seen it? Where were you when you saw it? How did it look? What did you notice along its banks? What was on the river? Was there any way of crossing over to the opposite bank?  Did you see where the boats land? Men have built many wharves on the banks of the rivers. If you stand on the wharf, you may see great ferry-boats crowded with people. Back and forth these boats go, carrying the people from one side of the river to the other.  Sometimes great steamers come up the river. They have carried people, food and clothing on a long journey. Some boats are loaded with coal or lumber. There are many pretty sailboats and rowboats too. In some you will see fishermen. They bring the fish back for the city people to eat.  Before the city was built there was beautiful country all along the banks. If you travel up the river, leaving the city far behind, you will see some fine scenery. Perhaps you will pass beautiful woods. Some of the trees bend over the river as if they were looking at their reflections in the clear water. At places there are broad fields where the cows come down to drink the cool water. Farther up there are hills or mountains rising far above the banks. You will notice that the river is growing narrower and narrower until it is but a small stream. If you go down the river again, you will see that it gradually widens as it flows on to the mouth.   6  Most cities get their water supply from a nearby river. Do you know where the water in your bath-room comes from? When you take a drink in our school-yard what water are you swallowing? How does this water get to our home and school? Pipes run under the streets from the river to all the buildings of the town. There are big pumping stations on the river bank to pump the water out of the river through pipes to the houses. Millions of gallons of water are pumped each day into the homes, schools, mills and factories. For what is this water used?  [Illustration: PUBLIC LIBRARY, NEWARK, N. J.]   7  Plants need more than good soil to make them grow. They will wither and die unless they have plenty of rain to keep the earth soft and moist. There are many places in the world where no trees, nor grass, nor plants of any kind can grow. This is because there is no water to wet the earth.  We all know that clouds bring the rain; but how do the clouds get the water? Whenever there is water on the earth, as in the rivers, the air is continually drawing up the moisture in tiny invisible drops. This moisture rises in the air and forms clouds. When the clouds get very heavy, down comes the water which we call rain. In cold weather it is changed into snow.  [Illustration: ELEPHANT IN THE \"ZOO.\"]  Where there is no moisture there can be no rain, for the air cannot draw up moisture to form clouds. Where there are many rivers there has been much rain, and the soil is kept fertile. Plants will grow in it. Do you see how our food, our clothing and our shelter are dependent upon rainfall? Do you see how we are kept alive by rivers?   8  Think of the many, many uses of rivers. There are thousands of useful rivers in the world.  What are the three great necessities of human life? How do rivers help us to get _food_ and _clothing_ and to build our _homes_ and make them comfortable?  SOME USES OF RIVERS  1. Water supply; washing and drinking.  2. Water power; flour, textile and planing mills.  3. Commerce; transportation.  4. Life; fish, plants.  5. Fertility of soil, rainfall.  6. Beauty of scenery.   9  Look at the map of our neighborhood. See the lines that represent the river. Notice how it bends. Does it show where bridges cross it?   10  THE OCEAN  Have you ever stood on the beach and watched the big waves roll in? The great _ocean_ stretches away as far as you can see. It seems to meet the sky. The weaves roll and break, and roll and break from morning till night forever. Where there are rocks along the shore the ocean dashes against them. The sparkling snowy spray then leaps high into the air with a boom and a swish!      _Note to the Teacher._--See the details for studying about the     oceans in Part II, Chapter I.   11  ISLANDS AND PENINSULAS  [Illustration: THE OCEAN.]  As you sail up the river you may see large portions of land lying right out in the water. There are pieces of land lying out in the ocean too. The water lies around them on all sides. We call such portions of land _islands_. If you were standing on the shore how could you go to an island which you saw out in the water? How could you get there if you had no boat? Some islands are joined to the shores by bridges.  Many islands are no larger than this room. Others are so large that it would take days to travel around them. Whether they are large or small they have water entirely around them.  [Illustration: PART OF A ROCKY"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22911"],["title","Where We Live (#5)"],["body",".]  Some of us have been to a large island that has been built up into a city. When the New York boys and girls want to leave their city they must either go in a boat, or over a bridge, or through a tunnel far under a river. Why? When you visit Atlantic City your train goes over a bridge into the city. Why?   12  Look at some pictures of islands and notice how many kinds there are. Some are all wooded. Others are covered with fields. Notice one that is rocky and steep, and another that is level and built into a city.  Some islands are so large as to have many cities built upon them, and there are many farms and dense woods besides upon the same islands. Some have many rivers flowing through them.  If you were on a large island, how could you prove that it was an island? If you wanted to leave it, how could you do so? Notice on the map of our neighborhood whether a river with islands in it is shown.   13  Sometimes a piece of land has water flowing only part way around it. If you take a boat and try to go all around it, you will come to a place where the boat cannot go because there is land there. This land that is nearly an island, but does not have the water completely around it, is called a _peninsula_. Where have you seen a peninsula?     CHAPTER X  DIRECTION   A LESSON IN THE SCHOOL YARD AT NOON TIME  Face the sun. We are facing the south. Does the sun always lie south of us? Where was it early this morning when it arose? That was east. Where will it be at sunset? That is west. Move your hand to show the sun's daily journey from east to south to west. The sun is south of us only at noon time.  [Illustration]  Face your shadow. Now the sun is behind you. What direction is back of you? You are facing north. Look at the shadows of the school, of the fence, of the pole, and of all the other children. They are all falling to the north. Can you make your shadow fall east or west or south? Why not? When only will shadows fall north? Can you think of any time when the shadows would fall east or west? Could they ever fall south? Why not?   2  Draw this diagram on the yard pavement, and mark the parts that are north, south, east and west. Stand at the middle of the cross. Face north. What is behind you? What direction is at your right side and which is at your left side? Learn these words:  \"When I face the north the south is behind me; the east is at my right hand and the west is at my left hand.\"  If you pass a weather vane on your way home, see if you can read the letters on it and find out what they mean.   3  With soft chalk draw a line on your desk with one end toward the north and one end toward the south. Mark N for north and S for south. Draw a line across the middle of it, and mark E for east and W for west.  What is north of you, south of you, east of you and west of you?  In what direction from you is your teacher's desk?  On what side of you are the blackboards? On which side are the windows?  Walk toward the north, toward the east, toward the south, toward the west.  Which boy or girl is north of you? Which pupil is west of you?  What is south of your room? What is east of it?  On what side of your room is the corridor? On which side is the street? On which side is the school yard?  What is north of your teacher's desk? What is south of your teacher's chair? What is west of the table? What is east of the windows?   4  [Illustration: POINTS OF THE COMPASS.]  Draw a plan of your desk. Mark north, south, east and west upon it. Hang it up with north at the top. Draw a plan of your schoolroom. Mark the north, south, east and west. Hang up the plan with north at the top.  Look at the plan of the town. We call it a map. North is at the top. Find the rivers. At which side of the city are they?  Look at a plan of the entire school floor with all of the rooms and the corridor. How shall we hang it?   5  Men have made plans of the city, the country, and the whole world. These plans which show the land and water are called maps. On all maps north is usually at the top.  Look at the map of the whole world. How can you tell which part means land and which means water? What direction is at the top of the map, at the bottom, at the right side, and at the left side?   6  See where we find the north-east, south-east, south-west and north-west.     PART TWO     CHAPTER I  THE EARTH AS A WHOLE   1  [Illustration]  Long ago wise men found out that the great earth on which we live is not flat, but round like a ball. It is so very large, and we see so small a part of it at one time, that it looks flat to us. Take a piece of paper and tear out a small hole. Hold the hole over your globe so that a small part of the surface shows through. Does the small piece of the globe look very curved?  These men noticed ships sailing away across the water. When the ships were far away the lower part of the boat could not be seen. More and more disappeared till only the tops of the masts could be seen; and at last they were gone too. If you make a little paper boat and let it sail flat across your desk and then try it over the globe, you can see how this proves that the earth is not flat.  Did you ever see an eclipse of the moon? The big curved shadow was the earth's shadow. Why was the shadow round?  A globe shows the shape of the earth.   2  Look at all of the globes and maps in the room. Find how the land and the water are shown. Can you see any islands, any peninsulas? A tiny dot may mean the whole city with hundreds of homes, factories and other buildings. Do you remember how we looked down on our town from a great height and saw the many houses? Just think of a tiny dot meaning all of our town.  [Illustration: WESTERN HEMISPHERE]  [Illustration: EASTERN HEMISPHERE]   3  How are the rivers drawn? Think of the great wide flowing river with its wharves and its boats. It flows on for miles and miles. Some day all of its water will reach the ocean. This little black line means all of that great broad river.  Why do we have such tiny things to represent such great things?  See this land called North America. It would take five days and nights in a fast express train to travel straight across it.   4  We can cut the globe in half and make a flat picture of the two parts as they look when placed side by side.  Another name for the globe is sphere. \"Hemi\" means \"half,\" so each half of the globe is called a \"hemisphere.\"  One half is called the Eastern Hemisphere and the other half the Western Hemisphere.  In the Western Hemisphere we have the Western Continent, which is America. This Western Continent is made of two grand divisions, North America and South America. Why are they so named? We live in North America. Find our city and the river nearest to it. North America was joined to South America by a narrow strip of land called the _Isthmus of Panama_. Look at the map and think why millions of dollars have been spent through many years to cut through this isthmus. Now vessels can pass through this Panama Canal.  Look at the map of the Western Hemisphere and notice what it contains besides the Western Continent of America. There is more water than land. This water forms the great oceans.  Perhaps you have been to Atlantic City or some other seashore place and have seen the Atlantic Ocean. Do you remember the big waves which rolled in on the sandy beach and the pretty white-caps far out? Did you see the big nets drawn in full of hundreds of fish? Perhaps you bathed in the ocean and got your mouth full of water. It did not taste like the water we drink, for it was salty. All of the water of the ocean is salt water, but the water of rivers is fresh.  The oceans are very large. It would take us five or six days and nights on a great steamer to cross to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. In what direction should we go?   5  On the western side of America there is another great ocean, the Pacific Ocean. It has salt water like the Atlantic Ocean, and it also is constantly in motion with great waves.  North of North America, in the intensely cold region, is the Arctic Ocean. Great masses of ice called icebergs and ice floes are floating through this ocean.  Far south of South America is the Antarctic Ocean. It does not touch South America. It too is in a cold part of the world.   6  Do you know of any people who came here from England, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy or Russia? Their homes were in the Eastern Hemisphere. The Eastern Hemisphere has a great mass of land called the Eastern Continent. The Eastern Continent is composed of three grand divisions, Europe, Asia and Africa.  Find the great island named Australia. That is sometimes called the Australian Continent because it is so large.   7  The same oceans which are in the Western Hemisphere extend into the Eastern Hemisphere. Can you name them? The Eastern Hemisphere also contains the Indian Ocean, which is not in the Western Hemisphere.   8  1. How can people go from North America to Europe?  2. How do the Chinese, whose home is in Asia, come to America?  3. Nearly all of the rubber which we use for automobile tires, overshoes, erasers, and hundreds of other articles comes from South America. Over what ocean does it come?  4. On what ocean did Peary sail on his journey to the North Pole?  5. When Amundsen searched for the South Pole, he started from an island near Australia. On what oceans did he sail?  6. When the first negroes were brought here from Africa over what ocean did they come?  7. What ocean trip is shortest from Africa to Asia?  8. Of what use is the ocean?  9. Which ocean can we reach most quickly from our home? How long would it take us to get to this ocean?  10. How long would it take us to reach the Pacific Ocean?      \"Behold the sea, ... splendid and strong, yet beautiful as the rose     or the rainbow; full of food, nourisher of man, purger of the world,     creating a sweet climate.\"--_Emerson_.     CHAPTER II  THE SEASONS   1  What kind of weather are we having now? "]]]
