And she had on an ugly but thoroughly useful chocolate-colored dress that Betty would have made her throw into the fire at once.  \"Betty, it was always Betty with Esther Crippen!\"  If only she could reach Esther in some way through their friend.  This was an ugly thought of Polly's.  She was ashamed of it and yet felt herself driven to using almost any means toward attaining her end.  \"Look here, Esther Crippen,\" she began, breaking the silence first.  \"I wonder if it has ever occurred to you that you may some day have a secret in your life (or you may have one already for all that I know), which you want more than anything to keep hidden from people.  Say you particularly wished Betty never to find it out.  Well, suppose I discovered your secret, suppose I knew about it right now, would you want me to tell Betty everything that I had found out just because I decided that it would be the right thing to do?\"  Polly happened to be staring into her own lap as she delivered this speech, feeling none too proud of it and having to trust to her imagination as she went along.  Now, however, she glanced up into the face of the other girl, who was standing near her.  Then with an exclamation of regret, almost of fear, Polly jumped to her feet.  \"Good heavens!  Esther, what is the matter with you?  Are you ill, do you feel like you were going to faint?  If you are sick why on earth haven't you told me before?  We could talk over this business of mine any time.\"  And Polly, forgetting her anger, put her arm reassuringly about her former friend, fairly leading her to a chair.  Esther continued staring at her, with a deathly white face, evidently trying to speak, but not able.  Then suddenly the girl collapsed and dropping her head on her arm began to cry.  She was ordinarily self-restrained; and being brought up in an orphan asylum among people who took no interest in her emotions she had learned unusual self-control.  Probably only three or four persons had ever seen her give way like this before in her life. So she did not cry easily, but in a kind of shaken, broken fashion that brought a remorseful Polly on the floor at her feet.  \"What on earth have I said that has hurt you so, Esther?\" she begged. \"I know I am a wretched little beast who does or say 'most anything sometimes in order to get my own way.  But of course I don't know any secret of yours and if I did I should never tell.  I only like to threaten things because I'm cross.  You see I don't believe in telling secrets.\"  This was a Polly-like way of apologizing and yet driving in her own claim at the same time.  If only at this moment Esther had had the Princess' understanding of Polly O'Neill's character, most certainly she would have laughed.  But Esther could not pull herself together so quickly.  A few moments later, however, she put her hands on Polly's shoulders and in the face of all that had just happened, kissed her.  \"No, Polly,\" she said, \"I know that if ever you should make up your mind that there was something, which I thought best should never be known, you would never tell it, even if I betray your secret now. Perhaps we don't agree about some things.  But you could never be revengeful.  I am sure I don't know what I ought to do.  Of course you have the right to choose for yourself.  I--I wish you wouldn't do what you have decided upon.  But if I don't tell and yet don't let you stay here with me, what on earth would you do about this theatrical scheme?\"  \"Why, go to some other boarding house for two weeks,\" Polly replied calmly.  \"I am sure that is exactly what you are doing, boarding in New York and going on with your work.  Of course your work happens to be studying music at present, but you have already sung at two church concerts and----\"  This time Esther did laugh.  \"Well, church concerts are hardly to be compared with the stage, Polly.  And please look in your mirror and remember that I am I and you are you.  But of course you realize that if you will go on with this whim of yours, I am not going to let you live in any place by yourself.  You would be sure to get ill or something dreadful might happen.  No, I shall beg you every minute till the time comes, not to do what you must know would worry your mother. But if you still persist, why, you are coming right here to stay with me and I shall be your shadow every moment until you go back to school.\"  Polly jumped up hastily.  \"What an impolite suggestion for a hostess!\" she murmured, pretending that the seriousness of the situation was now entirely past.  \"Go back to school?  Dear me, that is what I must do this very minute!  Good-bye.\"  And kissing Esther hastily on the hair, Polly seized her hat and fled out the door.  Yet halfway down the long stairs the girl hesitated and stopped for an instant as if intending to return.  \"Perhaps I ought to give up and be good for once,\" she whispered to herself.  \"It won't be fair, and mother and Mollie and Betty may be angry with Esther for not telling.  Even if I have the right to get into trouble myself, I haven't the right to drag in other people.  But, oh dear! what fun it will be!  And with Esther for my duenna, things are sure to turn out all right.\"  On the lowest steps Polly passed a small boy hobbling up toward Esther's room.  He was evidently a boy from the streets, as he was shabbily dressed and carried half a dozen papers under his arm.  But there was a hungry, eager look in his face that Polly remembered having seen sometimes in Esther's in those early days of her first coming to Mrs. Ashton's home.  So straightway she guessed that the boy was some child, whom Esther had discovered, with a talent and love for music and that she was giving him lessons in her leisure moments.     CHAPTER VIII  PREPARATIONS FOR THE HOLIDAYS  \"But if you won't come, Betty dear, I shan't wish to give the party,\" Meg Everett announced in a disappointed fashion.  \"With Polly and Esther not to be here, there are so few of our old Camp Fire circle anyhow.  And you see I only wanted to have our club and a few of John's young men friends.  The idea is that we girls are to cook the entire dinner and then just talk or dance or play games afterwards.  It is not to be anything like a _real_ party.\"  Betty smiled.  She and Meg and Mollie O'Neill were taking a winter tramp through the woods in the direction of the Sunrise Cabin, which had been closed for the past six months.  \"I should dearly love to come, Meg,\" Betty confessed.  \"There is no use in my pretending that I shouldn't feel desperately lonely with the thought of your having such a good time without me.  But mother----\"  Mollie gave her arm an affectionate squeeze.  \"There, Betty Ashton, that is just exactly what I knew you would say.  So I talked the whole matter over with your mother myself first.  And she declares that there isn't any reason why you should not accept Meg's invitation.  She is quite sure that your father would never have wished you not to be as happy as possible.  You have had trouble enough, goodness knows!   And then the extra disappointment of Polly's and Esther's remaining in New York!  I am glad enough Meg is going to give a party, and I hope there will be dozens of delightful things that Polly O'Neill will miss.  What on earth do you suppose has possessed her to want to stay on with Esther?\"  And Mollie sighed.  The three months without her sister may have passed by in greater peacefulness than with her, but then Polly always added a zest and flavor to existence.  And this was the longest time that the two girls had ever been separated.  \"Oh, I don't know.  She must have had some very good reason,\" Betty returned.  \"Polly wrote me that she had, and now we must not believe that she did not love us as much as ever.  She wasn't able to explain the particulars just at present; but if we only trust her and forgive her some day we will understand.\"  Mollie frowned.  With a much quieter and more amiable temperament than her twin, yet nearly eighteen years of intimate living with her had given her a pretty clear comprehension of her sister's character. Privately Mollie was puzzled over Polly's behavior and a good deal worried.  It was not like Polly to have conceived so sudden a devotion to Esther as to be unwilling to leave her for two weeks.  And her claim that she might not be particularly happy at home because of her stepbrother's presence was not convincing.  For Betty Ashton had invited Polly to be her guest.  No, Polly certainly had some special design in staying on in New York.  Of this Mollie was completely convinced.  But what the purpose was, neither from her own imaginings nor from any hint dropped by her sister's letters, could she get the slightest clue.  The three girls had come to a narrow path through the woods, and for a little while were compelled to walk in single file.  For a few moments they were silent, each one busy with her own thoughts, Mollie happening to be in the middle.  \"I believe I'll ask Billy what he thinks,\" she remarked suddenly aloud. And then she bit her lips, blushing until the very tips of her ears grew warm.  For Meg and Betty were both laughing in the most ridiculous way.  \"Is it as bad as that, Mollie?\" Meg teased.  \"Ask Billy what he thinks on one or all subjects, dear?\" Betty queried.  To both of which questions Mollie naturally deigned no reply.  She and Billy Webster were extremely good friends.  Indeed, they seemed always to have been since the day of their first meeting, when she had bound up his injured head.  And this winter, with Polly away and Betty so busy and Meg wrapped up in keeping house and Sylvia spending all her spare hours in studying with Dr. Barton when not at school, she had enjoyed the walks and talks with the young man perhaps more than usual. But it was not because of their intimacy that she had considered putting this problem of Polly's failure to return home before him.  Her reason was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22938"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls in the Outside World (#8)"],["body","in their long conversations about her sister, Billy had always seemed not only to be interested in Polly but able to understand her disposition peculiarly well.  So it was stupid for her two friends to have taken her foolish exclamation as meaning anything personal.  The next ten minutes Betty and Meg had rather a difficult time in making peace; for Mollie had not a strong sense of humor--a fact which both girls should have remembered.  But because she was always so gentle and kind herself, no one of her friends could bear the idea of hurting her feelings under any circumstances.  However while Betty was in the midst of apologizing, Billy Webster himself came swinging along the same path from the opposite direction. He had his gun over his shoulder and half a dozen birds in his hand.  \"Who is it taking my name in vain?\" he demanded of Betty.  And Mollie had a dreadful moment of fearing that Betty might betray what they had been talking about.  However, as nothing of the kind happened, ten minutes later Meg and Betty were walking ahead deep in conversation about the party, while Mollie and Billy strolled after them only a few feet behind.  The young man had been on his way into Woodford to divide the product of his day's hunting between Mrs. Ashton and Mrs. O'Neill.  Now, hearing that the girls were on a pilgrimage to Sunrise Cabin, he had been invited to accompany them.  \"No, it won't be like a meeting of our Camp Fire Club, Meg,\" Betty argued thoughtfully, after having satisfied herself by a glance over her shoulder that Mollie and Billy were too absorbed in each other to take any notice of them.  \"I have been coming to our Camp Fire Club meetings all winter and because I am in mourning made no difference. But with John inviting his friends to your entertainment, why, I can't make up my mind yet, dear, whether I have the courage to come.\"  Betty spoke bravely, but Meg slipped her arm across her friend's shoulder, holding her fast.  The two girls were closer friends now that Polly and Esther were both away and Meg understood that sometimes Betty did not feel so cheerful as she pretended.  \"John won't ask more than just one other fellow to keep him company, if we can have you with us in no other way,\" Meg conceded.  \"You see, Betty, John is only to be at home for a few days.  As this is his senior year at college he wants to so some special work during the holidays.  But he likes you so much better than any of the other girls in Woodford, that I am quite sure----\"  But Betty had stuffed her fingers in her ears and was refusing to listen.  \"It is bad enough to have you girls spoil me because I am in trouble, but when it comes to telling fibs I won't hear you.  Of course you know, Meg Everett, that I am not going to let you spoil everybody's pleasure on my account,\" she answered.  Feeling the victory already won, Meg laughed.  \"John is only to invite Billy Webster and Frank Wharton and Ralph Bowles and three or four of his Boy Scout camp.  By the way, Betty, one of the things I particularly wished to talk to you about is this: Shall we ask Anthony Graham?  He seems rather uncouth and the other fellows won't have anything to do with him.  But he is Nan's brother and she is so splendid I should hate to hurt her feelings.\"  Betty shook her head.  \"Anthony isn't the kind of person to invite though, Meg,\" she replied without a moment's hesitation.  \"Of course he is trying to pull up and keep straight and I feel that we should do all we can to help him.  But inviting him to our parties and treating him as if he were exactly our equal!\"  Betty's chin went up in the air and her face betrayed such a delicate, high-bred disdain that apparently Anthony's fate was immediately settled.  The little party had now reached the familiar pine woods and there, only a few yards ahead, stood their deserted cabin.  The totem pole raised its gaunt head to greet them, still decorated with the history of their year in the woods together.  But the doors and windows of the cabin were barred with heavy planks.  Nowhere was there a sign of life.  \"Let's go back home at once, please, now that we have seen that everything is all right,\" Mollie begged a moment later.  \"It always gives me the blues dreadfully to see Sunrise Cabin closed up and to know that perhaps no one of us shall ever live there again.  I never dreamed when we said good-bye to it last spring that we would not come out here often for club meetings and parties.\"  \"Parties?\" Meg repeated.  Then she continued standing perfectly still and silent for several moments, although the others were moving about laughing and talking.  \"Parties!\" she exclaimed again, speaking in such a loud tone that her companions turned to stare at her in surprise.  \"Betty Ashton, Mollie O'Neill and Billy Webster, if you and some of the others will help us, why can't we have our dinner party here at the cabin?  We are not planning to have it until New Year, so there will be plenty of time to make arrangements.\"  However, Meg could get no further with her suggestion, for Betty and Mollie had both flung their arms about her and Betty exclaimed:  \"It will almost make me have a happy holiday time, Meg dearest, and I can never bear to refuse your invitation if we are to be together at Sunrise Cabin once again.\"     CHAPTER IX  THE CASTLE OF LIFE  It seemed to Esther Crippen that she had been sitting in the wings of the theater every evening for half her lifetime, although it had been only a week since Polly's initial appearance as the Fairy of the Woods in the dramatization of the ancient legend \"The Castle of Life.\"  At first she had spent every moment after Polly's departure from the dressing room in peering out from some inconspicuous corner at whatever action was taking place upon the stage.  Now, however, the play and even the actors themselves had become a comparatively old story.  Her interest centered itself chiefly in Polly--in Polly and the odd human characters that she saw everywhere about her.  Indeed, except for her nervousness and care of her friend, this week had been almost as absorbing to Esther Crippen as to the other girl.  For after the first two nights she had lost her fear that Polly might make an absolute failure of her part, and also the impression that either of them might be insulted or unkindly treated by the men and women about them. People had been rough perhaps, but thoroughly business-like.  And if Polly were told to hurry, or to move on, or corrected for some mistake in her work, it was all done in so impersonal a fashion that both girls had learned valuable lessons from the experience.  Esther had been amazed at the spirit in which Polly had accepted the discipline and hard work.  Perhaps, after all, she had been making a mountain out of a mole hill and this disobedience on Polly's part, wrong though it certainly was, might not result in anything so disastrous as she had at first feared.  And there was no doubt that Polly was achieving a real success, one that surprised her and every one else.  Her part was only a small one, with but few words to speak; otherwise she could never have managed it with no previous experience and so little time for rehearsing. Nevertheless she had made one of those sudden yet conspicuous triumphs that are so frequent in stage life.  Sometimes it may happen with a girl playing the part of a maid, sometimes with a man who has not half a dozen sentences to recite.  It is the quality in the acting that counts.  And the manager in choosing Polly for the special rôle he had desired had chosen wisely.  For it was not so much the girl's method of playing that had won sympathy and applause, as her manner and appearance.  And curiously enough, though Polly was frightened the first night of the performance, she was not so much so as on that evening of the Camp Fire play the previous year, before an audience of friends.  Polly felt herself at the heart of her first great adventure.  The play itself, the other actors and actresses, the strangeness of her surroundings, all occupied her to the forgetting of her own individuality.  It seemed as though she were only living out a kind of dream.  Nothing was real, nothing was actual about her.  The audience did not terrify her, nor the lights, nor the darkness, nor the queer smell of dust and paint and artificiality, that is a necessary part of the background of stage life.  Perhaps the girl had found her element.  For there is for each one of us a place in this world, some niche into which one really fits.  And though this place may seem crowded, or ugly, or undesirable to other people, if it should be our own, it holds a feeling of comfort and of possession that no other spot can.  But Polly had not been thinking of niches or elements or anything of the kind either tonight or during the week past.  All of her being was too deeply absorbed in the interest of the play and the actors and her own little part.  At the present moment she was in hiding behind a piece of scenery, eagerly awaiting the cue for her own entrance; yet she was as keenly intent upon each detail of the acting taking place upon the stage as if tonight it were a first experience.  The players happened to be the two persons who had been kindest and most helpful to her in the company.  And one of them one was the brown-eyed girl whose lead she had followed on the day of her own engagement.  Polly had been glad to make the discovery later that this same girl had been engaged to play the part of Grazioso's grandmother in \"The Castle of Life.\"  The other actor was the star, a young man of about twenty-six or seven, who was impersonating Grazioso, the hero of the fairy story.  The stage was in semi-darkness, while the grandmother related to the boy the tale of her first meeting with the fairies.  A small, shabby room revealed a low fire burning in the grate.  In an armchair sat the old woman, while her grandson lay on the floor at her feet with his"]]]
