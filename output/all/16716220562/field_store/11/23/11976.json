All four reclined under the willow for some minutes without speaking, till at length the bride of the Colonel poutingly observed, \"It's of no use pretending any more, and we had better give it up.\"  \"Hah!\" exclaimed the Pirate. \"Pretending?\"  \"Don't go on like that; you worry me,\" returned his Bride.  The lovely Bride of Tinkling echoed the incredible declaration. The two warriors exchanged stoney glances.  \"If,\" said the Bride of the Pirate-Colonel, \"grown-up people WON'T do what they ought to do, and WILL put us out, what comes of our pretending?\"  \"We only get into scrapes,\" said the Bride of Tinkling.  \"You know very well,\" pursued the Colonel's Bride, \"that Miss Drowvey wouldn't fall. You complained of it yourself. And you know how disgracefully the court-martial ended. As to our marriage; would my people acknowledge it at home?\"  \"Or would my people acknowledge ours?\" said the Bride of Tinkling.  Again the two warriors exchanged stoney glances.  \"If you knocked at the door and claimed me, after you were told to go away,\" said the Colonel's Bride, \"you would only have your hair pulled, or your ears, or your nose.\"  \"If you persisted in ringing at the bell and claiming Me,\" said the Bride of Tinkling to that gentleman, \"you would have things dropped on your head from the window over the handle, or you would be played upon by the garden-engine.\"  \"And at your own homes,\" resumed the Bride of the Colonel, \"it would be just as bad. You would be sent to bed, or something equally undignified. Again: how would you support us?\"  The Pirate-Colonel replied, in a courageous voice, \"By rapine!\" But his Bride retorted, suppose the grown-up people wouldn't be rapined? Then, said the Colonel, they should pay the penalty in Blood. But suppose they should object, retorted his bride, and wouldn't pay the penalty in Blood or anything else?  A mournful silence ensued.  \"Then do you no longer love me, Alice?\" asked the Colonel.  \"Redforth! I am ever thine,\" returned his Bride.  \"Then do you no longer love me, Nettie?\" asked the present writer.  \"Tinkling! I am ever thine,\" returned my Bride.  We all four embraced. Let me not be misunderstood by the giddy. The Colonel embraced his own Bride, and I embraced mine. But two times two make four.  \"Nettie and I,\" said Alice, mournfully, \"have been considering our position. The grown-up people are too strong for us. They make us ridiculous. Besides, they have changed the times. William Tinkling's baby-brother was christened yesterday. What took place? Was any king present? Answer, William.\"  I said No, unless disguised as great-uncle Chopper.  \"Any queen?\"  There had been no queen that I knew of at our house. There might have been one in the kitchen; but I didn't think so, or the servants would have mentioned it.  \"Any fairies?\"  None that were visible.  \"We had an idea among us, I think,\" said Alice, with a melancholy smile, \"we four, that Miss Grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy, and would come in at the christening with her crutch-stick, and give the child a bad gift? Was there anything of that sort? Answer, William.\"  [Illustration: We had an idea among us ... that Miss Grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy.]  I said that Ma had said afterwards (and so she had), that great-uncle Chopper's gift was a shabby one; but she hadn't said a bad one. She had called it shabby, electrotyped, second-hand, and below his income.  \"It must be the grown-up people who have changed all this,\" said Alice. \"_We_ couldn't have changed it, if we had been so inclined, and we never should have been. Or perhaps Miss Grimmer _is_ a wicked fairy, after all, and won't act up to it, because the grown-up people have persuaded her not to. Either way, they would make us ridiculous if we told them what we expected.\"  \"Tyrants!\" muttered the Pirate-Colonel.  \"Nay, my Redforth,\" said Alice, \"say not so. Call not names, my Redforth, or they will apply to Pa.\"  \"Let 'em,\" said the Colonel. \"I don't care. Who's he?\"  Tinkling here undertook the perilous task of remonstrating with his lawless friend, who consented to withdraw the moody expressions above quoted.  \"What remains for us to do?\" Alice went on in her mild wise way. \"We must educate, we must pretend in a new manner, we must wait.\"  The Colonel clenched his teeth--four out in front, and a piece off another, and he had been twice dragged to the door of a dentist-despot, but had escaped from his guards. \"How educate? How pretend in a new manner? How wait?\"  \"Educate the grown-up people,\" replied Alice. \"We part to-night. Yes, Redforth,\"--for the Colonel tucked up his cuffs,--\"part to-night! Let us in these next Holidays, now going to begin, throw our thoughts into something educational for the grown-up people, hinting to them how things ought to be. Let us veil our meaning under a mask of romance;[A] you, I, and Nettie. William Tinkling being the plainest and quickest writer, shall copy out. Is it agreed?\"  The Colonel answered, sulkily, \"I don't mind.\" He then asked, \"How about pretending?\"  \"We will pretend,\" said Alice, \"that we are children; not that we are those grown-up people who won't help us out as they ought, and who understand us so badly.\"  The Colonel, still much dissatisfied, growled, \"How about waiting?\"  \"We will wait,\" answered little Alice, taking Nettie's hand in hers, and looking up to the sky, \"we will wait--ever constant and true--till the times have got so changed as that everything helps us out, and nothing makes us ridiculous, and the fairies have come back. We will wait--ever constant and true--till we are eighty, ninety, or one hundred. And then the fairies will send _us_ children, and we will help them out, poor pretty little creatures, if they pretend ever so much.\"  [Illustration]  \"So we will, dear,\" said Nettie Ashford, taking her round the waist with both arms and kissing her. \"And now if my Husband will go and buy some cherries for us, I have got some money.\"  In the friendliest manner I invited the Colonel to go with me; but he so far forgot himself as to acknowledge the invitation by kicking out behind, and then lying down on his stomach on the grass, pulling it up and chewing it. When I came back, however, Alice had nearly brought him out of his vexation, and was soothing him by telling him how soon we should all be ninety.  As we sat under the willow-tree and ate the cherries (fair, for Alice shared them out), we played at being ninety. Nettie complained that she had a bone in her old back and it made her hobble, and Alice sang a song in an old woman's way, but it was very pretty, and we were all merry. At least I don't know about merry exactly, but all comfortable.  There was a most tremendous lot of cherries and Alice always had with her some neat little bag or box or case, to hold things. In it, that night, was a tiny wine-glass. So Alice and Nettie said they would make some cherry-wine to drink our love at parting.  [Illustration: There was a most tremendous lot of cherries.]  Each of us had a glassful, and it was delicious, and each of us drank the toast, \"Our love at parting.\" The Colonel drank his wine last, and it got into my head directly that it got into his directly. Anyhow his eyes rolled immediately after he had turned the glass upside down, and he took me on one side and proposed in a hoarse whisper that we should \"Cut 'em out still.\"  \"How did he mean?\" I asked my lawless friend.  \"Cut our Brides out,\" said the Colonel, \"and then cut our way, without going down a single turning, Bang to the Spanish Main!\"  We might have tried it, though I didn't think it would answer; only we looked round and saw that there was nothing but moonlight under the willow-tree, and that our pretty, pretty wives were gone. We burst out crying. The Colonel gave in second, and came to first; but he gave in strong.  We were ashamed of our red eyes, and hung about for half an hour to whiten them. Likewise a piece of chalk round the rims, I doing the Colonel's, and he mine, but afterwards found in the bedroom looking-glass not natural, besides inflammation. Our conversation turned on being ninety. The Colonel told me he had a pair of boots that wanted soleing and heeling but he thought it hardly worth while to mention it to his father, as he himself should so soon be ninety, when he thought shoes would be more convenient. The Colonel also told me with his hand upon his hip that he felt himself already getting on in life, and turning rheumatic. And I told him the same. And when they said at our house at supper (they are always bothering about something) that I stooped, I felt so glad!  This is the end of the beginning-part that you were to believe most.

From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt whether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see the loom of the opposite houses.  The first day Holmes had spent in cross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had been patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his hobby--the music of the Middle Ages.  But when, for the fourth time, after pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon the window-panes, my comrade's impatient and active nature could endure this drab existence no longer.  He paced restlessly about our sitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping the furniture, and chafing against inaction.  \"Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?\" he said.  I was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of criminal interest.  There was the news of a revolution, of a possible war, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come within the horizon of my companion.  I could see nothing recorded in the shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile.  Holmes groaned and resumed his restless meanderings.  \"The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow,\" said he in the querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. \"Look out this window, Watson.  See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and then blend once more into the cloud-bank.  The thief or the murderer could roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen until he pounces, and then evident only to his victim.\"  \"There have,\" said I, \"been numerous petty thefts.\"  Holmes snorted his contempt.  \"This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than that,\" said he.  \"It is fortunate for this community that I am not a criminal.\"  \"It is, indeed!\" said I heartily.  \"Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who have good reason for taking my life, how long could I survive against my own pursuit?  A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over. It is well they don't have days of fog in the Latin countries--the countries of assassination.  By Jove! here comes something at last to break our dead monotony.\"  It was the maid with a telegram.  Holmes tore it open and burst out laughing.  \"Well, well!  What next?\" said he.  \"Brother Mycroft is coming round.\"  \"Why not?\" I asked.  \"Why not?  It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane. Mycroft has his rails and he runs on them.  His Pall Mall lodgings, the Diogenes Club, Whitehall--that is his cycle.  Once, and only once, he has been here.  What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?\"  \"Does he not explain?\"  Holmes handed me his brother's telegram.      \"Must see you over Cadogan West.  Coming at once.\"       MYCROFT.  \"Cadogan West?  I have heard the name.\"  \"It recalls nothing to my mind.  But that Mycroft should break out in this erratic fashion!  A planet might as well leave its orbit.  By the way, do you know what Mycroft is?\"  I had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the Adventure of the Greek Interpreter.  \"You told me that he had some small office under the British government.\"  Holmes chuckled.  \"I did not know you quite so well in those days.  One has to be discreet when one talks of high matters of state.  You are right in thinking that he is under the British government.  You would also be right in a sense if you said that occasionally he IS the British government.\"  \"My dear Holmes!\"  \"I thought I might surprise you.  Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty pounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind, will receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most indispensable man in the country.\"  \"But how?\"  \"Well, his position is unique.  He has made it for himself. There has never been anything like it before, nor will be again. He has the tidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing facts, of any man living.  The same great powers which I have turned to the detection of crime he has used for this particular business.  The conclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the central exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance.  All other men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience.  We will suppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves the Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his separate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft can focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the other.  They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he has made himself an essential.  In that great brain of his everything is pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant.  Again and again his word has decided the national policy.  He lives in it.  He thinks of nothing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if I call upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems. But Jupiter is descending to-day.  What on earth can it mean?  Who is Cadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?\"  \"I have it,\" I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the sofa.  \"Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough!  Cadogan West was the young man who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning.\"  Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.  \"This must be serious, Watson.  A death which has caused my brother to alter his habits can be no ordinary one.  What in the world can he have to do with it?  The case was featureless as I remember it.  The young man had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself.  He had not been robbed, and there was no particular reason to suspect violence.  Is that not so?\"  \"There has been an inquest,\" said I, \"and a good many fresh facts have come out.  Looked at more closely, I should certainly say that it was a curious case.\"  \"Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a most extraordinary one.\"  He snuggled down in his armchair. \"Now, Watson, let us have the facts.\"  \"The man's name was Arthur Cadogan West.  He was twenty-seven years of age, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.\"  \"Government employ.  Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!\"  \"He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night.  Was last seen by his fiancee, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about 7:30 that evening.  There was no quarrel between them and she can give no motive for his action.  The next thing heard of him was when his dead body was discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just outside Aldgate Station on the Underground system in London.\"  \"When?\"  \"The body was found at six on Tuesday morning.  It was lying wide of the metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a point close to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in which it runs.  The head was badly crushed--an injury which might well have been caused by a fall from the train.  The body could only have come on the line in that way. Had it been carried down from any neighbouring street, it must have passed the station barriers, where a collector is always standing.  This point seems absolutely certain.\"  \"Very good.  The case is definite enough.  The man, dead or alive, either fell or was precipitated from a train.  So much is clear to me. Continue.\"  \"The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was found are those which run from west to east, some being purely Metropolitan, and some from Willesden and outlying junctions.  It can be stated for certain that this young man, when he met his death, was travelling in this direction at some late hour of the night, but at what point he entered the train it is impossible to state.\"  \"His ticket, of course, would show that.\"  \"There was no ticket in his pockets.\"  \"No ticket!  Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. According to my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a Metropolitan train without exhibiting one's ticket. Presumably, then, the young man had one.  Was it taken from him in order to conceal the station from which he came?  It is possible.  Or did he drop it in the carriage?  That is also possible.  But the point is of curious interest.  I understand that there was no sign of robbery?\"  \"Apparently not.  There is a list here of his possessions.  His purse contained two pounds fifteen.  He had also a check-book on the Woolwich branch of the Capital and Counties Bank.  Through this his identity was established.  There were also two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich Theatre, dated for that very evening.  Also a small packet of technical papers.\"  Holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.  \"There we have it at last, Watson!  British government--Woolwich. Arsenal--technical papers--Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete.  But here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.\"  A moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered into the room.  Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its steel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind.  At his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard--thin and austere.  The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest. The detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled out of his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.  \"A most annoying business, Sherlock,\" said he.  \"I extremely dislike altering my habits, but the powers"]]]
