You Jews are fit only for trading and money lending--not fighting. You'll melt away quickly enough in the heat of your first battle.\"  \"Listen to me, Tim Durgan,\" retorted Franks, quietly enough, but with a dangerous sparkle in his eyes. \"I've endured your sneering ever since I came to camp and I'm growing weary of it, too. I didn't know why you wouldn't be friends with me, when I've never done anything to offend you; but if it's because I'm a Jew--\"  \"I want no Hebrew coward for a friend of mine,\" was the surly answer.  \"You can call me a coward as much as you like--I'll show you you're wrong when we face the redcoats. But you're not going to insult my people--understand?\"  Tim laughed contemptuously. \"How are you going to stop me?\" He looked down at Isaac who was a full head shorter than himself and of slighter build. \"Going to fight me?\"  At that moment the long lines of buff and blue straightened as one man and a murmur of \"the General\" passed down the ranks. Franks, the angry flush slowly dying from his cheeks, straightened his shoulders and gazed straight ahead; but he was not too intent on the arrival of General Washington to fling a fierce aside to his tormentor: \"That's just what I intend to do if you don't take it back--fight you until you do!\"  But a moment later all private hates and insults were forgotten as the boy looked toward the general, his soul in his eyes. Seated upon his great horse, the sun streaming upon his noble, powdered head and broad shoulders, the commander of the American Army looked what he later proved himself to be--an uncrowned king of men. A long, vibrating cheer rose from the soldiers' throats; then died away as Washington raised his hand for silence.  The young officer who rode beside him unrolled a piece of paper he carried, and read in a loud, clear voice the words which today every school boy knows or should know by heart. But the boys and men, pledged to fight and die for their country, heard them for the first time that day and thrilled at the rolling sentences of the Declaration of Independence, which declared them free forever from the rule of the British tyrant, King George III.  \"We hold these truths to be self-evident,\" the noble words rang forth to the listening soldiers, \"That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" An answering thrill awoke in every heart. Isaac Franks felt his lashes wet with sudden tears. The son of a nation of exiles, Jews driven from land to land from the days the Romans ploughed the place where once their Temple stood, he could appreciate the blessings of a home land where even the despised Jew might know the meaning of equality and liberty and justice. Then he thought of the taunts of his comrade and his face hardened; but only for a moment was he depressed. In America--the land which had pledged itself to grant equal opportunities to all men--his was the opportunity to show what the Jew was worth. He would teach Tim and his fellows that the descendants of David and the Maccabees were soldiers worthy of their ancestors.  Smiling a little grimly, he turned his face again toward the young officer and listened with stirring pulses to the charges brought against the British king; boy that he was, he realized that he and his companions were fighting not the English people, but a servile Parliament and an unworthy ruler who, according to the Declaration, was indeed a \"tyrant unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\" How he wished that King George himself would cross the ocean to frighten the colonists into submission; he would much rather meet him in battle than any of his overdressed officers or those wretched Hessians, sold by their ruler like so much cattle to do battle for a country in which they had no interest. Well, anyhow, Isaac told himself resolutely, he would do his best to defeat the redcoats--but he would teach Tim Durgan a well-needed lesson first!  \"And for the support of this declaration,\" ended the reader, \"with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\"  Silence at first--then a mighty shout from the assembled soldiers. The air rang with cries of \"With our lives--With our honor!\" as the men of the new Republic pledged themselves to fight for the faith she had just declared to the world. Isaac Franks looked toward Washington; the Virginian sat leaning forward slightly in his saddle. His usually calm, almost cold face was working with emotion; his lips moved as though he were about to address his men. Then he leaned toward the officer who had read the Declaration and murmured something in a low tone. The latter turned to the army.  \"The general hopes,\" the clear tones rang forth, \"that this important event will serve as an incentive to every officer and soldier to act with fidelity and courage, as knowing that now the peace and safety of the country depend, under God, solely on the success of our arms and that he is in the service of a state possessed of sufficient power to reward his merit and advance him to the highest honors of a free country.\"  Slowly the soldiers broke ranks, the dullest man among them touched and awed as though he had attended a new church and had consecrated himself to her service. For a moment Isaac Franks forgot his jeering comrade and his own threats; he walked to his quarters, head high in the air, eyes looking far away, as boy-like he dreamed of the days when a grateful commonwealth would \"reward his merit and advance him to the highest honors of a free country.\" He walked on air, painting the future in the bright colors known only to seventeen, forgetful of the world about him, until he was recalled to earth by a mocking laugh and the question: \"Still want to fight, Jew soldier?\"  Franks stiffened and turned to face his tormentor, his face hot with anger. \"Yes, I'll fight you this minute,\" he answered so loudly that several soldiers passing by overhead his words and stopped to see the fun. \"And thank you for reminding me, Durgan.\"  He pulled off his coat with a deliberate calm he was far from feeling at that moment, for he knew only too well that his opponent was vastly superior to him in strength and perhaps in experience as well. But Isaac did not hesitate in spite of the goodnatured advice of big Bob MacDonald who stepped up at that moment: \"Let him alone, son--you can't whip him and it's no use to try.\"  But Tim had already taken off his coat and stood leering down upon Isaac who felt that he could never retreat now; that he would always despise himself as a coward, a traitor to the heroes of his race. Setting his teeth for the drubbing he felt certain he would receive, he struck out blindly. Then he felt a hand grip his arm so tightly that he winced with pain, and looking up, saw that General Washington stood beside him.  \"Well, men?\" the commander's voice was very stern. \"Have you nothing better to do than spend your time brawling like a couple of tavern roisterers? Give me a good and sufficient reason for such behaviour or I'll have you both tied up and flogged to teach you to act like gentlemen and soldiers of the American Army.\"  His quiet eyes scanned the flushed, angry faces of the two lads. He turned sharply to Franks. \"I am waiting!\" he said.  For a moment Isaac wavered. He had heard enough of Washington's sense of justice to realize that if the chief knew his reason for challenging Durgan he might escape with a slight reprimand, or even a word of praise for defending his race. But only for a moment. A gentleman and a soldier in the American Army, young Franks decided, did not tell tales. He shook his head.  \"I am sorry, your excellency,\" he answered, respectfully, \"but I cannot tell you the reason of our quarrel since it concerns only ourselves.\"  Tim Durgan, who had waited for Isaac's accusation with a mocking smile about his mouth, gave an incredulous whistle. The despised \"Jew soldier\" was a man after all, who would risk undeserved punishment rather than betray a comrade, no matter how much he hated him. In his sudden admiration for the boy he forgot his awe of General Washington and burst out before he was granted permission to speak.  \"I'll tell you, Excellency,\" he cried, warmly. \"I've been plaguing and tormenting the lad and for no fault of his own. I never saw a Jew in my whole life before I joined the army, but I'd heard tales of them; cowards and afraid of their own shadows. And I teased the boy, never knowing he'd mind, and when he did I just kept on to spite him. And when he threatened to fight me, I wanted to laugh, for you can see for yourself, Excellency, that I'm taller and broader than he and could toss him about if I'd a mind to. But he wasn't afraid and if you hadn't come up, he'd have tried to fight me all the same.\" He paused for breath, smiling broadly, and held out his hand to Franks. \"It's all my fault, Your Excellency, and I'm willing to take what I ought to for it, but first let me shake hands with him and tell him such a game cock ought to've been born an Irishman and no mistake.\"  The general smiled as the two clasped hands. Then: \"I am sorry I was disorderly, Your Excellency,\" apologized Franks. \"I would have tried to forget a personal insult but I could not stand by and allow my people to be slandered. But I know now that he did not understand.\"  \"It takes a long time for some of us to understand, my boy,\" answered the general slowly, and, so thought Isaac, a little sadly, too. \"But some day, God grant it, we will all understand the words you both have heard today and America will know no distinction of race, creed or station--only the worth that makes a man.\" He turned suddenly to Tim Durgan. \"You come of a fighting breed, my man,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22915"],["title","The New Land (#6)"],["body"," said warmly, \"and just now when you confessed your fault you showed true courage. I need fighters as strong as your Irish ancestors; learn to fight only for our country and forget your petty quarrels and prejudices.\" He placed a kindly hand on Isaac's shoulder. \"And a boy who is as loyal a Jew as you, must be a loyal American. I hope you will always carry yourself as honorably as you did today. What is your name, my lad?\"  \"Isaac Franks, sir,\" answered the boy, flushing beneath his commander's praise.  \"Isaac Franks of this city?\"  \"Yes, sir. I have always lived in New York and I enlisted here.\"  \"Then you must be the boy of whom Colonel Lescher spoke to me. He said that you were so eager to serve that you even bought your own uniform and field equipment. I expect to hear from you again.\" He was about to pass on, then paused to add kindly: \"And since this is a holiday afternoon, why not spend it abroad instead of wrangling here. Now,\" with a slight smile, \"my Hebrew David and my Irish Jonathan, be off with you; and hereafter keep your blows for the British,\" he added, half jestingly, as he walked off, leaving the two lads staring somewhat sheepishly at each other as they strolled a little apart from the others.  Tim was the first to speak. \"It was great of you not to tell when he asked you,\" he said warmly. \"And if I can ever make up to you for what I said about Jews--\" which proves that Tim Durgan never made a foe or a friend by halves.  \"We'll forget all about that,\" answered Franks lightly. \"But we've wasted a good part of the afternoon already. Let's take a long walk and drink to our friendship in some good brown ale. I know a tavern near Bowling Green where there's always jolly company and a full measure for a men in uniform.\"  Chatting idly together, the two began their walk through the camp, passing rapidly down the crowded streets. There was a great stir in the city, for the storm clouds of hate against the British ruler which had been gathering for so many months had suddenly burst at the news of the signing of the Declaration at Philadelphia, and the air was heavy with protests of loyalty to the new government, and threats against King George. So when Tim and Isaac reached Bowling Green it was an excited crowd that they found there, gathered about the leaden statue of King George III; men and half-grown boys, with here and there a soldier enjoying his half-holiday.  \"One would think the British were already here,\" Tim growled goodnaturedly. \"If these merchants would stop cackling together like the hens in my father's poultry yard at home, and shoulder a gun, we'd drive Master George's tin soldiers and the Hessians back across the water so quick they'd hardly know they'd been here at all.\"  From the confused murmur of many voices came one rumbling cry which the boys caught and smiled to hear: \"Down with King George! We are free men. Down with King George!\"  A thin little man in a black coat elbowed his way to the base of the statue from which vantage point he tried to address the crowd. \"Friends,\" he quavered, as the uproar died, the idle mob ever ready for some new amusement, \"friends, don't be too rash. Look before you leap. We are only a handful of untrained farmers and merchants. The armies of King George----\"  But before he could speak further, the crowd suddenly broke lose with: \"Another cursed Tory! He is in the King's hire!--Drag him down!--Hang him to a tree to teach other Tories and traitors to hold their tongues!\"  The suggestion was like a fire brand to dry timber. Before the two soldiers on the outskirts of the crowd could fully realized what had happened, a stout apprentice lad in a leather apron had procured a rope which another brawny fellow flung around the Tory's neck. He tried to plead for mercy but his voice was silenced by the howling of the mob, so desperate in its rage against the king that they sought blind vengeance on their victim for daring to speak in his behalf.  Isaac started forward, his face white and tense. \"Come, Tim,\" he cried, \"We must make them set him free.\"  The Irishman shrugged. \"A Tory more or less! Let them hang him and welcome.\"  Isaac Franks did not answer. He only pushed his way through the mob, the crowd giving place to his uniform. He knew he could do nothing against them single-handed; yet he felt that he could not let this innocent man die. And, curiously enough, he thought less of the Tory's fate than the shame that would fall upon the people of his native city, if they committed such a crime in their reckless fury. He neared the front where several older and cooler citizens stood trying in vain to persuade the angry patriots to release the Tory. Then a splendid thought flashed through his quick mind, and springing lightly upon the leaden statue, he cried in a ringing voice: \"I come from General Washington.\"  The magic name hushed the angry crowd. They waited eagerly for the boy's words.  \"I serve the general of the American Army,\" continued Franks, \"and I am as loyal as any of you, for I carry a gun to defend my country while you do nothing but cackle, cackle like the hens in a poultry yard.\" The crowd, quick to respond to every suggestion, laughed goodhumoredly at Tim's mocking description which was now standing his friend in good stead. \"And you have as much brains as the hens in a poultry yard,\" continued the boy, following his advantage, \"for instead of pulling out the roots of your trouble, you attack this poor fool who never saw King George and is not even one of his soldiers.\" He leaned down and half pulled the rope from the Tory's neck. \"He is not worthy the honor of hanging. Use your good rope to haul down the statue of his Gracious Majesty, King George III--which has cumbered our city too long. And melt the lead into bullets which the soldiers of General Washington will use against any Briton who dares to enter our New York.\"  A roar of applause broke from the crowd. \"Down with King George!\" they cried as a dozen eager hands pulled the rope from the frightened Tory's neck and flung it about the statue. The Tory, only too glad to make his escape, crept away unnoticed in the crowd, already intent upon pulling the leaden effigy to the ground. They tugged as one man, that howling, maddened mob until with a great crash the deposed statue of the hated British king lay upon the ground. Then: \"Bullets\" was the cry, \"bullets for our soldiers,\" as, laughing and shouting, the citizens of New York dragged the statue away to be melted into bullets for colonial rifles.  Isaac Franks looked longingly after them. But he knew that it would soon be time for \"taps\" and he dared not be late. With a little sigh, he turned his face toward the camp, where, under General Washington, he hoped to learn to become a good soldier of the Republic.     THE LAST SERVICE  _The Story of a Rabbi Who Lived in New York When it Was Captured by the British in 1776._   A Sabbath hush brooded over the garden of the Rev. Mr. Gershom Mendes Seixas, minister of New York's one synagogue, _Shearith Israel_. The tall pink and white hollyhocks that bordered the prim paths nodded languidly in the warm September breeze. From the trees came the twitter of sparrows, now low and conversational, now high and shrill, \"just like people in the synagogue,\" thought little David Phillips, as he strolled in his grandmother's garden on the other side of the hedge. And if David had pulled aside the white curtains of the Rabbi's study windows, he would have seen that the same Sabbath peace filled the low-ceilinged room, the walls covered with books, most of them rather forbidding in their musty, leather bindings. A peaceful, restful room on the Jewish rest day; but, boy as he was, David would have seen at a glance that Rabbi Seixas was not at peace with himself. A keen-eyed, quick-moving young man of about thirty, he paced restlessly up and down between the bookshelves, his hands clasped behind his back, his brows knit in thought. Several times he glanced at the tall clock his father had brought from Lisbon; it would soon be time for him to go to the synagogue; but what message had he to give his people?  Down the quiet street came the roll of drums, and David rushed to the gate, wishing with all his heart that he might follow the soldiers. But he knew that his grandmother expected him to take her to the synagogue, and he did not dare to leave the garden; instead he stood kicking holes in the path with his shining Sabbath boots which at that moment he hated with all his might, just as he hated the ruffles of fine linen that his grandmother had painfully stitched for him with her loving, rheumatic old fingers, and his Sabbath suit in which he was never allowed to romp or play. And at that moment, with the British actually knocking at New York's front door, one could hardly blame a small boy for growing impatient at the restrictions of a doting old grandmother, no matter how much she might indulge the orphan grandson whom his dying father had left in her charge the year before. If he were only a man, thought David, longingly; only old enough to be with General Washington's troops across the river. But a ten-year-old boy, who couldn't even play the drum like Frank Morris, the apprentice lad who had run away to join the army, couldn't serve his country any better than a feeble old lady like Grandma or a minister like the rabbi next door.  The roll of drums had startled the rabbi as well as his young neighbor and he now appeared in his garden, walking with swift, nervous steps to the gate. At first, he did not seem to see David; only stared down the road with wide, eager eyes, his hands gripping the rails of the gate until his knuckles showed hard and white; then, as the drums grew fainter, his shoulders relaxed a little, he sighed deeply, and, turning toward David, nodded kindly, even smiling, as though he had no deeper thought in his mind than giving his young friend a Sabbath greeting.  \"Good _Shabbas_,"]]]
