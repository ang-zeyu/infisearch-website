At times we went across the bay, in various directions, but oftenest we strove through the sand to the ocean beach, stopping here and there to botanize, and gather the sweet yellow and purple lupin, and to rest on the limbs of the scrub-oaks. On the beach we roasted potatoes and made coffee, and then ate ravenously. A happy gipsying it was, and she, the queen, forgot her cares. Not a pebble at our feet, nor a floating seaweed, nor a shell, nor a seal on the rock, but opened up an instructive talk from our teacher, or started Charley Stoddard reciting a poem, or set a girl singing. Before starting homeward, the whole party, including Shirley, shoes and stockings off, waded into the surf, and afterwards rested on the warm beds of sand. A fine comradeship, that, and one that never died.  Shirley, I should also mention, wrote some respectable poetry. I have fondly preserved, treasured, and cherished the original manuscript of a poem written by her at the time Margaret Fuller Ossoli was lost by shipwreck in 1850. This poem was included in my collection of California poetry, but was not printed in Outcroppings. I append it to this paper, of which it can hardly be considered an essential part.  I married and went to the mines, and our home was on the Mariposa Grant. We lived on a bed of gold. Once, upon a visit to the city, I found Shirley nervous and worn. Her vacation was about to begin. She went home with me, and stayed in bed the first three days. Then she was daily swung in a hammock under an oak. Soon we had horseback-rides, and up the creek she again panned out gold. Later we set out in the stage-coach for the hotel at the big Mariposa Grove. Mr. Lawrence put us in charge of Mr. Galen Clark, a rare scholar, and the guardian of the Big Tree Grove and of the Yosemite Valley. This charming man was much interested in Shirley. From the hotel we took daily rides with him through the great forest, and then made the twenty-five-mile horseback-ride and found Mr. James M. Hutchings, of the Illustrated California Magazine, awaiting us at the entrance to the valley. He escorted us to his picturesque hotel, where he and his interesting wife made our three weeks' stay most delightful. Down in the meadows we came upon John Muir sawing logs. He dropped his work, and we three went botanizing, and soon were learning all about the valley's formation as he entrancingly talked. We met many tourists of distinction, and Shirley forgot that she ever had a care, and on our way back she galloped along recklessly.  At our home in Mariposa we invited friends to come and enjoy Shirley's Shakespearean readings, chiefly comedy. In these Mr. Lawrence had a happy part.  In time Shirley went to New York, to her niece, Genevieve Stebbins, who was successful in a delightful line of art-work. Before leaving San Francisco, her faithful pupils and other friends gave a musicale and realized about two thousand dollars, which was presented her as a loving gift. In the great metropolis her genius was recognized soon after her arrival, and she was importuned to give lectures on art and literature. The Field family, who delightedly discovered her, took her to Europe, where she visited all the art-galleries, a treat that had been a lifelong heart's desire. In New York she had at once made her home with Dr. Ewer's widow and children, but, in the end, she went to Morristown, New Jersey, where, it was said, she again happily met and renewed her friendship with Bret Harte's accomplished and delightful wife and her attractive children, while Bret Harte himself was sojourning in Europe, a successful author. Mrs. John F. Swift, her long-time appreciative friend, Charley Stoddard, myself, and others, contributed to her pleasure by letters till the close of her perfect life at Morristown, New Jersey, on February 9, 1906. No other woman has left a more lasting impress on the California community. But back to Rich Bar! Back to the gold-fields! DAME SHIRLEY is abroad, and again she is weaving her wizard spell!         \"ALONE\"      A REMINISCENCE OF MARGARET FULLER OSSOLI      _By_ SHIRLEY LEE       Beneath thy spirit-eyes I stand alone,         Nor deem thee of the dead     As mournfully I gaze, sad-hearted one,         On that calm brow and head.      The starry crown of genius could not save         From woman's gift of grief;     The moaning billows o'er thy breast that have         Emblem thy life too brief.      O Margaret! my weak heart-pulses shiver         In wordless woe for thee,     Thy wasted tenderness, thy love that never         Might its fruition see.      Thou hadst no youth, O wondrous child! no youth         Haloed thy later life;     Sternly thy girl heart sought its solemn truth         In battle and in strife.      In thine own Northern home didst thou not live         \"Alone,\" always \"alone\"?     What heart to thine uplifted heart could give         Ever an answering tone?      In suffering, labor, strife, we saw thee stand         With lips that would not moan,     While shone thy regal brow and eyes with grand         Aspirings all thine own.      At last among thy Romans thou didst find         A shrine for that large heart;     It understood thee not, the Northern mind,         But coldly shrunk apart,      When those pale lips--from whence, an hour agone,         Flew out, like rifted light,     Winged words of wit--murmured their wailed \"Alone\"         To the pitying midnight.      And I have read thy life, its mournful story         Of loneliness and blight;     But o'er its close there shines a solemn glory,         A setting star's trailed light.      Margaret! white-robed, thy hair unbound, thy veil,         Most like a bride wert thou     When Ocean clasped thee, and, with lips all pale         And icy, kissed thy brow.      And lovely as a white unfolded blossom         Lay the child Angelo,     Hushed to his dreamless flower-sleep on that bosom         Which would not let him go.      Husband, and wife, and child together flutter         Up to the great white throne,     Where nevermore may Margaret Fuller utter         That piteous \"Alone!\"     _The_ Contents   _The_ PRINTER'S FOREWORD _to this_ EDITION                     PAGE v   DAME SHIRLEY                                               PAGE xxvii  BEING _a_ PAPER _prepared by_ MRS.
