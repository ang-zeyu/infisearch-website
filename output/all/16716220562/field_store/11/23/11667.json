Without hesitation, I determined to perform the voyage in my own vessel.  She was a remarkably good sea boat, and a fast sailer, and for her size was very roomy.  She was called by a curious coincidence the _May Flower_, which was the name of the vessel which carried over the first pilgrim fathers to America; and certainly, when my vessel was named, I never contemplated attempting to cross the ocean in her.  Although she was under sixty tons, I considered that properly handled she was as well calculated to double the Cape as a far larger vessel, and I felt sure from what I had heard, that if I got her out safe to the colony she would fetch a high price.  If, however, she was to be swamped--as my whole family and property would have gone to the bottom at the same time--there would be no one left behind to mourn our loss.  I do not mean to say that I for one moment thought we should be lost, but still I knew that it was possible, and I reconciled myself to the chance with that reflection.  The first thing I did was to haul up my vessel, and to give her a thorough repair, then to refit her rigging, and to raise her bulwarks somewhat, so as to make her snugger.  As she was from the first fitted so as to be easily handled, her masts were short and very stout; and as her hull was as strong as wood and iron could make it, she was in every way suited for a long sea voyage.  As I had made up my mind to attempt to carry out some sheep, I divided her hold into compartments, one as a pen, another for hay and water, a third for implements of agriculture, and a few select goods which I calculated would sell well, and provisions for ourselves.  In the after part of the vessel were cabins for my wife, myself, and my daughters, while the boys with the two men who formed the crew were berthed forward.  Just as my preparations were ready my eldest son returned home from sea, and delighted he was to find that his next voyage was to be made with those he loved.  I was fortunate in disposing of my house and the heavier part of my furniture to advantage, and the remainder I stowed away on board.  It is extraordinary what number of things the little vessel held.  There were numerous casks of water, salted meat, potatoes, bread, rice, and many other sorts of provisions for six or seven months.  I had no wish to be starved; then there was the hay for the sheep, which I got pressed into very tight packages in a way since become common, and by the time the sheep came on board there was not much space to spare, I can assure you.  When all was ready for sea, my wife and I and all my children took a last farewell of the house where we had lived, and the neighbours we had known so many years, and we then went to church to pray God for a safe passage, and as soon as service was over we returned on board, and that evening dropped down the Thames.  I have not yet said a word about the sheep, for I did not take them on board till afterwards.  I was acquainted with a man at Hamburg who understood sheep well, and to him I had written to buy for me the two finest merino rams he could find, and four ewes of the same breed.  I calculated that I could not carry hay and water for more.  We had fine summer weather and a fair wind to carry us across Channel, and when I put into Hamburg to take the sheep on board, I found that my friend had not disappointed me; he had in truth selected six magnificent animals, and I felt certain that if I could carry them safely to the colony they would fetch a pretty high price. Having filled up one water-cask, we again put to sea, and were now fairly on our voyage.  We had a beautiful run down Channel, and indeed from first to last Providence watched over us, nothing went wrong, and everything prospered far more than we could have expected.  My wife and daughters turned out capital sailors, and soon learned to take their turn at the helm, to relieve my boys and our two men.  Both of these were characters in their way.  Old Bob Hunt had sailed with me for many years in the coasting trade, and a trusty hand he was, but he knew no more of the broad seas than the child unborn, or of geography either; and when I told him that I was thinking of going out to New Holland, he asked if I expected to make the place in a week or so, as he supposed it wasn't very far from Old Holland, where the people speak Dutch.  And when I told him that the natives were as black as his shoe, and spoke a language no Christian man could understand, he would scarcely believe me.  \"Never mind,\" he said, after a moment's thought, \"no one shall say I deserted you because you were bound on a long voyage; if we were to be a year about getting there I would go with you.  I shall leave behind no more kith nor kin than you do, so that's settled.\"  Old Bob was a capital seaman, but what is strange, he never touched liquor, nor smoked, nor over chewed tobacco.  He ate, too, as little as any man I ever saw at his meals; and as for sleeping, it was difficult to find him with his eyes shut.  The least noise would awake him, and if the breeze freshened up a bit he was sure to be on deck in a moment to see that all was right.  He was a most invaluable hand, and worth any two other men I ever had.  In spite of his age Bob was active as a monkey, and short and thin, and so occupied wonderfully little space in the small craft; which was convenient, as also for another reason, for his companion, Dick Nailor, was one of the biggest men I ever met, a perfect giant, but gentle as a lamb, and with an excellent temper.  He used to say that he and Bob together only took up their fair amount of room.  If Bob was never seen asleep Dick was seldom found broad awake, but he was keeping a bright look-out notwithstanding, and when roused up he was active enough, and strong as a lion.  The children were very fond of him.  He could take them all up in his arms and dance a hornpipe with them hanging about him, as lightly as a young lady in satin shoes.  My eldest boy, Peter, named after me, was one of the steadiest fellows I ever met.  At eighteen he was second officer of a ship, and might have been entrusted with the command.  I was sorry to take him away from the line he was following, and yet it was a great thing to have all my family together.  He wished to come, and did not disappoint my expectation.  Mark and John, my next boys, were always together, and yet very different.  Mark was one of the merriest chaps you ever saw, and up to all sorts of harmless pranks.  John looked like gravity itself, but that arose from his eyes and the shape of his mouth; give him anything to laugh at and he would indeed laugh heartily.  Mark was his chief object of admiration.  He thought no one his equal, yet many people liked John the most.  He was so humble and gentle, and never thought a thing about himself.  My eldest girl, Mary, was like her elder brother as to steadiness and discretion, just what an elder sister should be; so good-natured and kind, too, it was pleasant to see her standing all the bothering the young ones gave her without a word of complaint.  It was a valuable quality in a person who was to be shut up for four or five months in a small craft with a number of youngsters.  She was next to Peter in age, and then came Susan, as kind-hearted, industrious a little creature as ever lived, not very bright, but wanting to do right; and then the two boys, and then Margaret, a bright-eyed, fair child, such a little dear; then another boy, Tommy, always in a mess because he didn't know how to keep out of one; and one more girl, Sarah Ann, and there you have the whole lot of them; they, with their mother, a good woman if any one ever deserved the name, with the two men and myself, made up the complement of the human souls embarked on board the _May Flower_.  Then we had a dog, _Steadfast_, and a cat, _Duchess_, the only thing of much rank aboard us; two fine cocks and ten hens for laying eggs, besides a couple of dozen other fowls, to be eaten by my wife and the girls.  We had a pair of pigeons, a pair of robins and sparrows, and a hen lark--her mate died just as we were going on board--belonging to Mark and John.  I don't think we had much else.  Yes, we had some primrose, violets, snowdrops, daisies, and other roots and small plants, which took up little space, to remind us of old England.  We sailed in the autumn, so as to arrive in the summer, and to get housed before the rains set in.  We took our departure from Ashanto, and shaped a course for Rio Janeiro, in the Brazils, there to take in a further supply of water and fresh provisions.  Thence I hoped to carry the trade wind across the Atlantic, and round the Cape, though I thought it possible that I might have to touch at the Cape, unless we had an unusually fast run, for water.  You see our little craft couldn't carry enough for ourselves and the sheep for as long a time as we could have wished, and yet you may depend on it we wasted none.  I have often thought of the story of the poor Arab who, wishing to make the caliph the most valuable present in his power, took him a skin bottle full of muddy water from the desert.  He, when journeying across the desert esteemed it of more value than silver, gold, or precious stones.  We, too, learned how to value fresh water, and I would not have filled up my cask with wine instead of it, had I been offered the finest in the world.  We were especially favoured with fine weather and a fair wind, and we made good use of our time, for every one on board was as busy as a bee from morning till night.  We had prayers regularly morning and evening out of the Prayer-book, and on a Sunday I read out of Galpin's sermons, and that the lessons it taught might not be forgotten I used to talk about them every day for the week which the Sunday began, and asked the young people questions about it.  Then I set them their lessons, and Mary or Peter "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],["title","Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#4)"],["body","them, and they got on famously.  They gave their mind to the work, do you see, and did it well.    CHAPTER FOUR.  THE RESCUED STRANGER.  We made the Desertas off Rio without having had one day on which my wife and the children couldn't be on deck with comfort.  They were tried somewhat by the heat, for it was hot in our little cabin with the sun striking down on the deck all day, but they didn't mind that much.  I was most anxious about the sheep.  I had made up my mind that we were to do great things with them, and I dreaded any of them dying.  We used to have them up on deck every day to walk about, two at a time, and they all became as tame as lambs; indeed, they lived like aldermen, and grew as sleek and fat, for we kept them well washed and clean, for I couldn't help thinking that would be conducive to their health.  It was necessary to go into Rio, but I was sorry to have to do it on one account.  It is so beautiful a place that I thought my wife and daughter might think meanly of our future home after it.  It is a beautiful country, with its magnificent harbour, and surrounding hills, and tropical trees and villas, and the city looks very fine till you get into it.  I hoped not to be detained there more than three days, so as soon as Peter had returned from the shore where he went to order our provisions, and to learn where we could get the best water, I took my wife and Mary and the rest of the children there, that they might see what a foreign city is like.  Scarcely had we set foot on shore than we saw collected on the quay nearly two hundred black people all huddled together, men and women, young girls and boys, and little children, with hardly a rag to cover them, looking wretched and startled and wild, very little like human beings.  Mary drew closer to me.  \"Oh, father, what are they?\" she asked.  \"Those are negroes just landed from a slave ship,\" said I, for in those days the Brazilians had no law against slaving.  \"They are on their way to a shed, to be washed, fed, and dressed a little may be, and then sent up to the slave market, where they will be sold one by one, or a lot together, just as buyers may require, as a farmer sells his sheep and cattle to a butcher or a grazier, to kill or fatten.\"  \"And those poor people have souls just as we have,\" exclaimed Mary. \"How dreadful!\"  As we walked on we passed numbers of negroes grunting under heavy loads, some working for their owners, others let out to hire like beasts of burden, but none labouring for themselves.  A little further on we passed a shrine, a little house open in front, with a figure in it, and ornamented with flowers, and candles burning; and some people, women and old men, were kneeling down before it, and muttering words as quickly as their lips could move, and counting on necklaces with small and large beads, and a cross at the end; and suddenly, as soon as they had done, it seemed, up they jumped, and walked on, and other people passing just made a bow and the sign of the cross, and hurried away.  \"Is that an idol, father?\" asked Mary; \"I didn't know these people were heathen.\"  I thereon told her that the figure was that of a saint, and that the people in their ignorance had got to worship the figure instead of saying prayers to the saint, though even that to our notion was very bad, as Christ had taught us to pray to God only.  I saw that my dear wife, and Mary and Susan, were greatly shocked at this, but they were to see something worse, for before long we espied a great crowd moving towards us, and we got up into a porch to avoid them.  Presently there came by first some men holding up a rich silken canopy, under which walked a priest in magnificent robes all gold and silver, and he had something in his hand; and as soon as the people saw him, whites and blacks alike fell down on their knees and worshipped him, or rather, as we were afterwards told, what he carried in his hands, which was the host.  This is a wafer and some wine, which the people believe is turned into the real body and blood of Christ.  After him came a number of people with masks on their faces, and large cloaks on, so that they could not be known, bearing on their shoulders a huge figure of the Virgin Mary, and the infant Jesus in her arms.  She was dressed in robes of silk with a crown of gold on her head, and numberless jewels glittering on her shoulders.  Many other figures followed--one of Christ bearing the cross, and of various saints; and there were little boys looking like girls dressed up in pink and blue silk, and gold and silver dresses all stuck out with glittering wings; and there were big boys or priests in red and white gowns swinging censers, and others ringing bells and chanting; and lastly there came regiments of soldiers with bands playing before them, and the procession went on through a number of streets, and at last into a church, when the soldiers marched away in different directions.  We were told that it was a religious procession, though we could not understand how it was to advance the cause of religion; indeed, we were particularly struck by the indifference with which all the people looked on, and those especially who walked in the procession.  The men in black masks and hoods who carried the figures were, we were told, doing penance for their sins, and that they believed that they were thus washing away all the sins they had committed for the year past; they, poor people, were not told by their priests that the blood of Christ can alone cleanse men from sin.  We saw many other things, some of which we admired, for the city has some fine squares, and open places, and broad streets, and handsome buildings.  I need not have been afraid of my wife wishing to remain in the country, for she was in a hurry to get on board again, and declared that no money would tempt her to live among people who held their fellow-creatures in slavery, and practised such wicked mummeries and idolatries.  \"No,\" she exclaimed, \"let me live where I can have a parish church, in which all pray and sing praises to God together in our own language, and hear a simple sermon which we can understand, reminding us of our duties, and admonishing us of our faults.  That's what I call public worship.\"  \"And that's what I hope we shall get, dear wife, in time, out where we are going, but I doubt whether we have much chance of it yet,\" said I; for I knew that people when they get away from England are too apt to grow careless about their church, and their religion also.  We quickly got on board our water, and fuel, and fresh provisions, and some green stuff, and hay for the sheep, and corn for the fowls.  The two boys went on shore with their brothers and brought off a bowl of gold and silver fish, as they said, to make amends for the lark and one of the robins which had died.  Once more the little _May Flower_ was ploughing the ocean with her head to the east.  People at Rio were very much astonished when they heard of the long voyage we were making.  \"I would rather be in that little craft with a clear conscience, than in many a ship ten times her size which I have met at sea,\" I answered, and it was proved that I was right.  As we were losing sight of the coast of South America, my wife, looking back at it again, expressed her thankfulness that we were not compelled to live among its inhabitants.  \"But,\" said I, \"it's a beautiful place, Martha.  So is this world a very beautiful world, but it's man that mars it.  If man were free from sin, it would be next to heaven itself.\"  For ten days or more we had a beautiful run to the eastward.  I never saw the little craft go along so fast; it was difficult to believe that, with the smooth sea we now had, we were out in mid-ocean, hundreds of miles from any land.  We were in the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope, and expected to make the land in a few days, when the weather gave signs of changing.  We had hitherto been greatly favoured, and I had, with the rest, begun to believe that we should escape bad weather altogether.  The sea got up, and the wind went on increasing, but we got the schooner under snug canvas in good time.  As we were undermanned, it was necessary to be very careful in that respect.  I told my wife and children that they must look out for a regular gale, such as they had not been accustomed to, and make everything fast in the cabins.  We got the sheep slung, so as to prevent them being knocked over, and then at last battened down the hatches, intending to heave the vessel to, should the gale not abate.  I had been well accustomed to face bad weather in the Channel in my little vessel, and so had my boys; and I knew well what she would do; but when they saw the heavy seas now rolling up towards us, their young cheeks turned pale with alarm.  It certainly did look as if one of those heavy, moving, dark green, watery hills rising up on every side, with the spoon-drift flying from their summits, must ere long engulf us; but the tight little craft, buoyant as a cork, with her stout masts and strong new canvas, every rope well served, and not a strand even chafed, rose up, and then sunk down the steep slopes into the wide valleys between the seas, not one breaking aboard us, though we were every now and then pretty well blinded with the showers of spray which drove across the deck.  Still we could not tell what might happen, and the time was an anxious one.  At last, when I found how beautifully the schooner was behaving, I determined to call my wife and daughters up, that they might witness a sight which I certainly hoped they might never have to look on again.  I slid back the companion hatch and called them. My wife would not venture to move, but Mary and Susan came up.  They stood for a minute or more with their eyes opening and very pale; Mary holding my arm, Susan her brother's.  \"I called you girls to show you what the ocean is like sometimes, happily not very often.\"  Mary continued"]]]
