You may think that helmet and those stripes on your arm give you more brains than the common run of people, but it isn't so!  I say I protest!\"  \"And much good your protest may do you at this time and place,\" was the calm answer.  Then, drawing his eyebrows down until the blue eyes were scarcely able to peer beneath them, he continued: \"I, Heinrich von Liebknecht, Captain in His Imperial Majesty's army in command of a detachment sent forward to capture this city, have decided that it is better that you remain with us.  There is nothing more to say.\"  \"But there is a great deal more to say!\" stormed the boy.  \"Jimmie,\" cautioned another lad, stepping forward and laying a hand on the arm of the red-headed boy, \"perhaps it would be better to say no more just at this time.  There must be some way out of this.\"  \"Silence!\" commanded the man who had called himself von Liebknecht. \"The decision has been made.  I leave you now, but will return in a few moments.  By that time you will have said farewell to your friends and be ready to accompany me for service under the Kaiser!\"  The lad addressed as Jimmie could scarcely restrain a sneer as the other finished speaking.  His contempt was unbounded, and he did not seem to be making any great effort to conceal his emotion.  Just as the door was closing behind the departing man Jimmie permitted himself to wrinkle his freckled nose in that direction and accompanied the gesture with a motion indicative of great disgust and contempt well known to many.  The scene was one unusual in the extreme.  Four young boys were standing in a room from which the ceiling had been partly removed by an exploding shell from a cannon.  They were in one of the houses that had only partly escaped destruction during the bombardment of Peremysl by the Germans on that memorable first day of June, 1915.  Three of the boys were about eighteen years of age and wore the well-known uniforms of the Boy Scouts of America.  The eldest, Ned Nestor, was slightly older than the others and wore insignia that denoted his rank as patrol leader of the Wolf Patrol, New York City.  Jack Bosworth and Harry Stevens stood beside Ned, their uniforms slightly the worse for wear, due to the extremely active experiences they had just undergone.  These boys were members of the Black Bear Patrol of New York City, and were fast friends of Ned Nestor and his red-headed chum, Jimmie McGraw, the fourth member of the group.  Just now Jimmie was not wearing the Boy Scout uniform.  Instead he was dressed in the uniform of a Russian Cossack, and this was the immediate reason for the controversy that had arisen between the boy and the German officer.  Those of our readers who have followed the adventures of the boys as related in previous volumes of this series, and particularly that entitled \"Boy Scouts with the Cossacks, or Poland Recaptured,\" will at once recall the exciting circumstances that resulted in Jimmie's donning the Cossack uniform and the reason for the presence of the four boys in Peremysl at this time.  Jimmie seemed to be too much overcome by his emotion at what he considered rank injustice to be able to carry on rational conversation.  \"I tell you, Ned,\" he sputtered, \"just because I happen to have on some clothes a little different from others they needn't think I'm any different myself!  I'll fix his clock, all right!\"  \"Don't forget about using slang, Jimmie!\" cautioned Ned, half laughing. \"But you see the German officer, von Liebknecht, is really more than a little bit right at that.\"  \"How's that?\" inquired Jimmie in astonishment.  \"They say clothes don't make the man,\" replied Ned, \"but in a great many cases clothes are like one's reputation--they play an important part in other people's estimate of us.  In this case, for instance, the Germans have just captured this city from the Russians.  You are discovered wearing a Russian Cossack uniform, and they naturally and almost excusably conclude that the wearer of the uniform is a subject of the country it represents.\"  \"Oh, I see,\" slowly replied the lad, nodding his red head.  \"Yes, Jimmie,\" put in Harry Stevens, \"you see it pays to 'Be Prepared,' just as our motto says.  We never can tell just when we'll be required to depend upon our reputation or our uniform for a favorable opinion from those who see us or hear of us.\"  \"That's all very well,\" interrupted Jack Bosworth, \"but how are we to get Jimmie out of this predicament?  General or Captain von Liebknecht seems to think that he's going to make a German soldier out of Jimmie just to keep him out of harm's way, and I don't like it.\"  \"Perhaps we can find some of the other uniforms or clothes of some sort for Jimmie to change into,\" suggested Harry eagerly.  Ned shook his head in a despondent manner.  \"I'm afraid that wouldn't work, boys,\" he said presently.  \"We would only be caught at it and all tried for spies, and maybe find ourselves in a worse predicament than we now are.  Perhaps the German officer will listen to reason when he returns.\"  \"Yes,\" scorned Jimmie.  \"Perhaps the sun will shine at midnight, or water will start running uphill, or something like that will happen!\"  \"You don't seem to have much faith in the German ability to change the mind?\" inquired Jack.  \"Maybe this fellow'll be different.\"  \"No, sir!\" pursued Jimmie gloomily.  \"The average German is a pretty decent fellow in a great many ways, but when it comes to changing his mind--why, it 'can't be did,' because it's impossible.\"  \"Hush!\" commanded Ned.  \"Here he comes.  I'll talk to him.\"  But, though Ned endeavored by every art of conversation at his command to influence the German Captain to change his mind, that individual insisted that since Jimmie had been found in the captured city wearing the uniform of a Russian Cossack he must be treated as one.  The only alternative he would admit was that Jimmie must give evidence of his claim that he was not a Russian by enlisting in the German army.  \"So,\" decided the German, \"you haf been to riding horses accustomed. Goot.  You shall now ride a horse for der Kaiser, und,\" he added meaningly, \"you shall do it vell.  You may now say goot bye to dese odder poys und come mit me.  Der oath ve vill administer.\"  Several soldiers fully armed, standing about, stepped forward at the Captain's signal.  Placing themselves between Jimmie and his chums, they advanced, fairly compelling the lad to accompany them.  Thunderstruck at the proceedings, but unable to render any assistance to their comrade, the three lads watched Jimmie disappear through the doorway.  Then, as they were left quite alone, they turned to one another with an air of dejection.  \"What shall we do, Ned?\" inquired Jack presently.  \"Yes, Ned,\" put in Harry, with something very like a catch in his voice, \"let's have your ideas.  You are always ready with some suggestion in an emergency.  What shall we do?\"  \"In the first place, boys,\" answered Ned, \"I'm mighty glad to hear you ask questions like that.  It shows me that you are ready for action instead of wanting to sit down and give way to despair.  I'm ready for action this minute if I could only decide what should be done.\"  \"I move we hunt around and find some guns and go hold that bunch of Germans up and take Jimmie away from them!\" said Harry impulsively.  \"Do you suppose the Captain will make good on his threat of making Jimmie enlist in their cavalry regiment?\" asked Jack, ignoring Harry's suggestion.  \"If they do, can't he slip away some night?\"  \"What if he does?\" inquired Harry.  \"Where would he slip to, and where shall we get to help him?  It seems to me that every minute counts now. If they get him into a cavalry regiment they'll want to be on the move right away.  At times like these, with Germany fighting the whole of Europe, they can't afford to let a regiment remain idle.\"  \"That's very true,\" nodded Ned thoughtfully.  \"Germany has won a victory over Russia, and that may relieve some of her forces in the east, at least temporarily, until Russia gathers enough of an army to make another assault.  In that case they might send the cavalry regiment toward the western front in Prance or Belgium, where Germany is meeting the French, English and other troops.\"  \"Do you think they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22991"],["title","Boy Scouts Mysterious Signal; Or, Perils of the Black Bear Patrol (#1)"],["body"," make Jimmie go along and fight the allies?\" questioned Jack.  \"If they do that, he may get killed.\"  \"Perhaps that would suit the German Captain as well as anything else,\" observed Ned.  \"It would save him the trouble and responsibility of ordering the red-head shot immediately.\"  \"Then in that case,\" continued Jack, \"I second Harry's motion and hope it is carried unanimously.  Let's get busy and get the boy.\"  \"I think you are right,\" agreed Ned.  \"Now, if we can have some plan of action we'll be able to make more headway than without it.\"  \"Right you are, Scout Master!\" cried Jack.  \"What is your plan?\"  \"Well,\" began Ned, glancing at his comrades, \"it seems almost too bold a thing to try just at first thought, but I can't think of anything better than to try to get away from this place in the Eagle, and then watch our chance to kidnap Jimmie from those fellows.\"  \"A fine idea!\" was Harry's almost cheerful response.  \"Ned, there's nothing too bold to try once, anyway.  Maybe we can get Jimmie out of their hands.  If we ever do--\"  Harry's clenched first, which he shook at the door out of which the Germans had led Jimmie, spoke more eloquently than his unfinished sentence.  Plainly he was ready for action.  \"Let's slip out of here while we have a chance,\" suggested Ned.  \"Just the thing!\" agreed Jack.  \"It's the best time we'll ever find. The incoming army is pretty busy just now and won't see us.\"  With one accord the three lads moved toward the door.  Ned glanced around the partially wrecked apartment in the hope of discovering something that would be of use to them in their endeavor to help Jimmie escape.  An object in one corner caught his attention.  As Ned stepped forward to examine the object he had seen, he was startled to hear a cry from Jack, who had been looking from a window.  \"Look!\" cried the boy, pointing toward the street.  \"They're actually making Jimmie take an oath of enlistment!\"  Quickly joining Jack, Ned and Harry saw Jimmie standing in the street, surrounded by German soldiers wearing the uniforms of Uhlans.  Directly behind the lad stood one of the soldiers with the muzzle of a gun pressed against Jimmie's back.  Before him an officer stood, apparently administering some form of oath.  The three boys could see Jimmie's lips move in response to the prompting of the officer.  Directly the ceremony was ended and the soldiers turned as if preparing to mount their horses, standing near.  \"There's a bunch coming back to this house!\" declared Jack.  \"Wonder what they want?\" mused Harry in a puzzled manner.  \"I think they have decided they want three more recruits!\"  \"Good night!\" was the lad's startled ejaculation.  \"Let's go!\"  \"Come over here,\" directed Ned, springing toward a corner of the room. \"I think I've found something that will help us out.\"     CHAPTER II  A FRIEND APPEARS  Harry and Jack hastened to cross the room strewn with wreckage left by the exploding shell.  Ned was already kneeling in the corner.  \"What is it, Ned?\" cried Jack excitedly.  \"Have you got a gun?\"  \"No, not a gun,\" replied Ned in suppressed excitement, \"but it may prove more useful than a gun at this time.\"  \"Oh, I see what it is!\" was Harry's exclamation.  \"Hurrah!  We may be able to beat them out after all.  Hurry!\"  \"Huh!\" scornfully put in Jack.  \"Nothing but a trap door into the cellar!  I wouldn't give much for that!\"  Ned, without replying to either lad, was busily scraping away the refuse from the corner.  Almost concealed by the litter, he had seen a huge ring in the floor and, naturally concluding that it was fitted into a trap door, had begun an investigation for the purpose of discovering if the door led to a passage that might afford a means of escape for the lads.  The proximity of the approaching soldiers made their need of some haven of refuge an imperative one.  Presently Ned discovered the outlines of the trap door, which he had correctly surmised to be in that spot.  The location of the debris favored the quick plan that had formulated in Ned's fertile brain.  He rose to his feet and gave a quick glance about the room.  Without wasting time or effort in conversation, the lad quickly pointed toward a table that lay upturned not far from the trap door. Signalling to his comrades for assistance, he darted toward the object and began dragging it to a position directly over the trap door.  Jack and Harry, divining his intention, hastened to assist Ned.  Their united efforts soon placed the table in position.  It was the work of but a moment to raise the trap door and prop it up with a short piece of wood from the wreckage strewn about.  Making the well-known signal used by railroad men in the United States as a sign for a fireman to shovel more coal into the firebox, Ned urged the others to descend into the darkness that yawned mysteriously at their feet.  Jack was first through the opening.  He clung to the rim for a moment with his hands.  Then he released his hold and dropped.  Harry and Ned, impatiently waiting for Jack to pass through the door, heard him drop to a floor below and give a startled cry.  Then they prepared to follow just as the tramp of many feet resounded through the passage outside the room.  Harry slipped into the opening and in turn dropped out of sight.  Ned followed feet first and for an instant hung from the sill.  Grasping the stick that had been used as a prop, Ned gave a mighty wrench backward and fell.  He said afterward that it seemed as if he had taken a full week to drop from his position to the floor below.  In reality the drop was not a great one.  The distance was, however, greater than the height of any of the three boys, and explained their inability to gain a foothold before releasing their hold upon the floor above.  For a moment Ned was unable to regain his breath.  Presently he sat upright and began to search for his comrades.  \"Jack, Harry!\" he called softly.  \"Where are you?\"  \"Here we are, Ned,\" came a whisper from the darkness that shut the boys in on every hand.  \"Can you see us?\"  \"Can't see a thing!\" declared Ned.  \"Where are you, anyway?\"  \"Stay right where you are and we'll be there in a moment,\" was Harry's answer.  \"This is one horrible place or I'm a Dutchman!\"  \"Come on, then, and be quick about it,\" urged Ned.  \"I wonder if we have dropped out of the frying pan into the fire,\" he added.  \"Impossible,\" chuckled Jack, in spite of the seriousness of their predicament.  \"Where there's fire there's light, and I can't see a single ray of light in this miserable place!\"  \"Hush, Jack!\" cautioned Harry.  \"Not so loud or they'll find us.  Can't you hear them tramping about in the room above?\"  Harry's question brought Ned and Jack to a realization of the fact that the room they had so recently quitted was occupied by the soldiers from whom they had tried to escape.  Footsteps echoed along the stout floor, and the boys could hear sounds indicating that pieces of furniture were being hurriedly overturned.  \"Uh!\" grunted Jack as he suddenly bumped into Ned.  \"Wonder you wouldn't blow signals when you're going to cross ahead of a fellow.\"  \"Hush!\" whispered Ned.  \"They may hear us!  Let's wait a bit!\"  All three boys drew close together.  They instinctively clasped hands in the darkness, looking for some degree of comfort in the act.  The noises above them gradually lessened.  Presently they ceased altogether, and the boys could hear footsteps clattering along the floor in the direction they assumed the door to be.  Directly quiet reigned in the place.  \"They've gone, I guess,\" Ned said after a moment's wait.  \"Now what shall we do?  Shall we climb back into the house?\"  \"I move that we explore this apartment first,\" said Jack.  \"Oh, no!\" urged Harry.  \"This isn't a nice place to go poking around in.  We have troubles enough already without hunting more.\"  \"What's your objection to looking the place over?\" asked Ned.  \"Rats!\" was Harry's brief but expressive explanation.  \"Rats?\" queried Ned.  \"What do you mean?  Are there rats here?\"  \"There certainly are, and lots of them,\" was the positive answer. \"When I dropped into this place I think I dropped onto one, and must have crushed him before he had time to squeal.  I heard others running.\"  \"We really ought to make a light,\" returned Ned.  \"We can't tell what the place is like without some way of seeing it.\"  \"There's a light!\" was Jack's sudden exclamation.  \"See it over there to the right.  Why,\" he added, \"there are two lights!\"  \"And I see others!\" cried Harry.  \"I believe it's the eyes of the rats. Perhaps they were frightened away and are coming back.\"  \"Have you any matches?\" asked Ned.  \"I haven't a one with me.  It's careless, I know, but not a match can I find in my pockets.\"  \"Where's your searchlight?\" inquired Jack.  \"Haven't you that?\"  \"No; the Germans took that away from me when they searched us.\"  \"I have two matches,\" said Harry, \"but I don't want to waste them. Perhaps it will be a long time before we get any more, and I feel that we ought to save them if possible.\"  \"Maybe we can find some stuff here dry enough to make a fire with, and that'll give us light!\" suggested Jack.  \"Good idea!\" responded Ned.  \"The place feels dry enough.\"  \"Let's keep hold of hands and move slowly about,\" put in Harry.  \"In that way we won't be separated and may find just what we want.\"  Acting on this suggestion, the boys clasped hands and moved slowly about, feeling their way cautiously with their feet.  They seemed to be in a cellar with a solid stone floor that had been made quite smooth.  \"Here's something!\" exclaimed Harry as his foot struck a small object. \"This feels like a piece of wood.\"  \"Here's my knife; let's whittle some shavings,\" offered Jack.  In a short time the boy had succeeded in producing the desired shavings from the board Harry had discovered.  Gathering these carefully in his hands, he held them ready to receive the flame from Harry's match.  All three lads eagerly gathered closer "]]]
