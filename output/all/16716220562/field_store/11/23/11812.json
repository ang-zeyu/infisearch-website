Even if he were to be late at other places, I should always be sure he would show up when there was anything to eat.\"  \"You bet I would,\" announced the boy, with a good-humored grin.  \"I shall have enough chintz for curtains for all your windows,\" interrupted Nancy, who had been busy taking careful measurements during the conversation. \"We'll get some brass rods and make the hangings so they will slip back and forth easily; they will be much nicer than window shades.\"  \"Ain't there nothin' I can donate?\" inquired Mat Maguire anxiously. \"A rag rug, now--why wouldn't that be a good thing? The missus makes 'em by the dozen and our house is full of 'em. We're breakin' our necks mornin', noon, and night on 'em. A couple to lay down here wouldn't be so bad, I'm thinking. You could put one beside your bed and another before the door to wipe your feet on. They'd cheer the room up as well as help keep you warm. Just say the word, sonny, and you shall have 'em.\"  \"I'd like them tremendously.\"  The kind-hearted Irishman beamed with pleasure.  \"Sure, they'll be better out of our house than in it,\" remarked he, trying to conceal his gratification. \"You can try stumbling over 'em a spell instead of me. 'Twill be interesting to see which of us breaks his neck first.\"  It was amazing to see how furniture came pouring in at Ted's bachelor quarters during the next few days. The chintz curtains were finished and hung; the Maguire rugs made their appearance; Mr. Turner produced a shiny alarm clock; and Nancy a roll of colored prints which she had cut from the magazines.  \"You'll be wanting some pictures,\" said she. \"Tack these up somewhere. They'll brighten up the room and cover the bare walls.\"  Thus it was that day by day the wee shack in the woods became more cheery and homelike.  \"I've managed to hunt up a few trap's for you,\" called Mr. Wharton one morning, as he met the boy going to work. \"If you want to run over to the cabin now and unlock the door, I'll send a man over with them.\"  Want to! Ted was off in a second, impatient to see what new treasures he was to receive. He had not long to wait, for soon one of the farm trucks came into sight, and the driver began to deposit its contents on the wooden platform which sloped from the door down to the river.  As Ted helped the man unload, his eyes shone with delight. Could any gifts be rarer? To be sure the furniture was not new. In fact, some of it was old and even shabby with wear. But the things were all whole, and although they were simple they were serviceable and perhaps looked more in harmony with the old-fashioned curtains and the quaint rugs than if they had come fresh from the shop. There was a chest of drawers; a rocking chair, a leather armchair, and a straight wooden chair; a mirror with frame of faded gilt; a good-sized wooden table; and, best of all, a much scarred, flat-topped desk. Ted had never owned a desk in all his life. Often he had dreamed of sitting behind one when he grew to be a man. But to have it now--here! To have it for his own! How it thrilled him!  After the furniture was in place and the teamster had gone, he arranged his few papers and pencils in the desk drawers a score of times, trying them first in one spot and then in another. It was marvelous how much room there was in such an article of furniture. What did men use to fill up such a mighty receptacle, anyway? Stretch his possessions as he would, they only made a scattered showing at the bottom of three of the drawers. He laughed to see them lying there and hear them rattle about when he brought the drawers to with a click. However, it was very splendid to have a desk, whether one had anything to put in it or not, and perhaps in time he would be able to collect more pencils, rulers and blocks of paper. The contrast between not having any room at all for his things and then so much that he did not know what to do with it was amusing.  Now at last he was fully equipped to take up residence in his new abode and every instant he could snatch from his duties that day he employed in settling his furniture, making up his bed, filling his water pitcher from the river and completing his final preparations for residence at the boathouse. That night he moved in.  Nothing had been omitted that would contribute to his comfort. Mr. Wharton had given him screens for the windows and across the broad door he had tacked a curtain of netting that could be dropped or pushed aside at will. The candlelight glowing from a pair of old brass candlesticks on the shelf above the fireplace contributed rather than took away from the effect and to his surprise the room assumed under the mellow radiance a quality actually Ã¦sthetic and beautiful.  \"I don't believe Aldercliffe or Pine Lea have anything better than this to offer,\" the boy murmured aloud, as he looked about him with pride. \"I'd give anything to have Mr. Wharton see it now that it's done!\"  Strangely enough, the opportunity to exhibit his kingdom followed on the very heels of his desire, for while he was arranging the last few books he had brought from home on the shelf above his desk he heard a tap at the door.  \"Are you in bed, son?\" called the manager. \"I saw your light and just dropped round to see if you had everything you wanted.\"  Rushing to the door, Ted threw it open.  \"I haven't begun to go to bed yet,\" returned he. \"I've been too excited. How kind of you to come!\"  \"Curiosity! Curiosity!\" responded the man hastily. Although Ted knew well that the comment was a libel, he laughed as Mr. Wharton came in, drawing the door together behind him.  \"By Jove!\" burst out the manager, glancing about the room.  \"You like it?\"  \"Why--what in goodness have you done to the place? I--I--mercy on us!\"  \"You do like it then?\" the boy insisted eagerly.  \"Like it! Why, you've made it into a regular little palace. I'd no idea such a thing was possible. Where did you get your candlesticks and your andirons?\"  \"From home. We have radiators in the apartment and so my sisters had stored them away and were only too glad to have me take them.\"  \"Humph! And your curtains came from home, too?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, you've missed your calling, is all I can say. You belong in the interior decorating business,\" asserted Mr. Wharton. \"Wait until Mr. Clarence sees this place.\" Again the elder man looked critically round the interior. \"I wouldn't mind living here myself--hanged if I would. The only thing I don't like is those candles. There is a good deal of a draught here and you are too near the pines to risk a fire. Electricity would be safer.\"  Whistling softly to himself, he began to walk thoughtfully about.  \"I suppose,\" he presently went on, \"it would be a simple enough matter to run wires over here from the barn.\"  \"Wouldn't that be bully!\"  \"You'd like it?\"  \"Yes, siree!\"  The manager took up his hat.  \"Well, we'll see what can be done,\" he answered, moving toward the door.  But on the threshold he stopped once more and looked about.  \"I'm going to bring some of the Fernalds over here to see the place,\" observed he. \"For some time Mr. Clarence has been complaining that this shack was a blot on the estate and threatening to pull it down. He'd better have a peep at it now. You may find he'll be taking it away from you.\"  He saw a startled look leap into the boy's eyes.  \"No, no, sonny! Have no fears. I was only joking,\" he added. \"Nevertheless, the house will certainly be a surprise to anybody who saw it a week ago. I wouldn't have believed such a transformation was possible.\"  Then as he disappeared with his flash-light through the windings of the pine woods he called:  \"We'll see about that electric wiring. I imagine it won't be much of a job, and I should breathe easier to eliminate those candles, pretty as they are. Until something is done, just be careful not to set yourself and us afire!\"  With that he was gone.  Ted dropped the screen and loitered a moment in the doorway, looking out into the night. Before him stretched the river; so near was it that he could hear the musical lappings of its waters among the tall grasses that bordered the stream. From the ground, matted thickly with pine needles, rose a warm, sun-scorched fragrance heavy with sleep.  The boy stretched his arms and yawned. Then he rolled the doors together and began to undress.  Suddenly he paused with one shoe in his hand. A thought had come to him. If Mr. Wharton ran the electric wires over to the shack, what was to prevent him from utilizing the current for some of his own contrivances? Why, he could, perhaps, put his wireless instruments into operation and rig up a telephone in his little dwelling. What fun it would be to unearth his treasures from the big wooden box in which they had been so long packed away and set them up here where they would interfere with no one but himself!  He hoped with all his heart the manager would continue to be nervous about those candles.     CHAPTER V  A VISITOR   Fervent as this wish was, it was several days before Ted saw Mr. Wharton again and in the meantime the boy began to adapt himself to his new mode of living with a will. His alarm clock got him up in the morning in time for a plunge in the river and after a brisk rub-down he was off to breakfast with the Stevens's, whose cottage was one of a tiny colony of bungalows where lived the chauffeurs, head gardener, electricians, and others who held important positions on the two estates.  It did not take many days for Ted to become thoroughly at home in the pretty cement house where he discovered many slight services he could perform for Mrs. Stevens during the scraps of leisure left him after meals. His farm training had rendered him very handy with tools and he was quick to see little things which needed to be done."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23292"],["title","Ted and the Telephone (#6)"],["body","oreover, the willingness to help, which from the moment of his advent to Aldercliffe and Pine Lea had made him a favorite with Mr. Wharton and the men, speedily won for him a place with the kindly farmer's wife.  Had Ted known it, she had been none too well pleased at the prospect of adopting into her home a ravenous young lad who might, nay, probably would be untidy and troublesome; but she did not dare oppose Mr. Wharton when the plan was suggested. Nevertheless, although she consented, she grumbled not a little to her husband about the inconvenience of the scheme. The money offered her by the manager had been the only redeeming factor in the case. Quite ignorant of these conditions, Ted had made his advent into the house and she soon found to her amazement that the daily coming of her cheery boarder became an event which she anticipated with motherly interest.  \"He is such a well-spoken boy and so nice to have round,\" asserted she to Mr. Wharton. \"Not a mite of trouble, either. In fact, he's a hundred times handier than my own man, who although he can make a garden thrive can't drive a nail straight to save his life. And there's never any fussing about his food. He eats everything and enjoys it. I believe Stevens and I were getting dreadful pokey all alone here by ourselves. The lad has brightened us up no end. We wouldn't part with him now for anything.\"  Thus it was that Ted Turner made his way. His password was usefulness. He never measured the hours he worked by the clock, never was too busy or too tired to fill in a gap; and although he was popular with everybody, and a favorite with those in authority, he never took advantage of his position to escape toil or obtain privileges. In fact, he worked harder if anything than did the other men, and as soon as his associates saw that the indulgence granted him did not transform him into a pig, they ceased any jealousy they cherished and accorded him their cordial goodwill. For Ted was always modestly respectful toward older persons; and if he knew more about farming and some other things than did a good many of the laborers on the place, he did not push himself forward or boast of his superiority.  Consequently when he ventured to say, \"I wonder if somebody would help me with this harrow?\" he would receive a dozen eager responses, the men never suspecting that Mr. Wharton had given this little chap authority to order them to aid with the harrowing of the field. Instead each workman thought his cooperation a free-will offering and enjoyed giving it.  Thus a fortnight passed and no one could have been happier than was Ted Turner on a certain clear June evening. He had finished his Saturday night supper of baked beans and brown bread and after it was over had lingered to feed the Stevens's hens, in order to let Mr. Stevens go early to Freeman's Falls to purchase the Sunday dinner. As a result, it was later than usual when he started out for his camp on the river's brink. The long, busy day was over; he was tired and the prospect of his comfortable bed was very alluring. It was some distance to the shack, and before he was halfway through the pine woods that separated Aldercliffe from Pine Lea darkness had fallen, and he was compelled to move cautiously along the narrow, curving trail. How black the night was! A storm must be brewing, thought he, as he glanced up into the starless heavens. Stumbling over the rough and slippery ground on he went. Then suddenly he rounded a turn in the path and stood arrested with terror.  Not more than a rod away, half concealed in the denseness of the sweeping branches rose his little shack, a blaze of light! A wave of consternation turned him cold and two solutions of the mystery immediately flashed into his mind--fire and marauders. Either something had ignited in the interior of the house; or, since it was isolated and had long been known to be vacant, strolling mischief-makers had broken in and were ransacking it. He remembered now that he had left a window open when he had gone off in the morning. Doubtless thieves were at this moment busy appropriating his possessions. Of course it could not be any of the Fernald workmen. They were too friendly and honorable to commit such a dastardly deed. No, it was some one from outside. Was it not possible men had come down the river in a boat from Melton, the village above, and spying the house had made a landing and encamped there for the night?  Well, live or die, he must know who his unwelcome guests were. It would be cowardly to leave them in possession of the place and make no attempt to discover their identity. For that invaders were inside the shack he was now certain. It was not a fire. There was neither smoke nor flame. Softly he crept nearer, the thick matting of pine needles muffling his footsteps. But how his heart beat! Suppose a twig should crack beneath his feet and warn the vandals of his approach? And suppose they rushed out, caught him, and--for a moment he halted with fear; then, summoning every particle of courage he possessed, he tiptoed on and contrived to reach one of the windows.  There he halted, staring, his knees weak from surging reaction.  Instead of the company of bandits his mind had pictured, there in the rocker sat Mr. Wharton and opposite him, in the great leather armchair, was Mr. Clarence Fernald. The latter fact would have been astounding enough. But the marvel did not cease there. The light suffusing the small room came from no flickering candles but glowed steadily from two strong, unblinking electric lights, one of which had been connected with a low lamp on his desk, and the other with a fixture in the ceiling.  Ted could scarcely believe his eyes. All day, during his absence, electricians must have been busy. How carefully they had guarded their secret. Why, he had talked with Tim Toyer that very morning on his way to work and Tim had breathed no word, although he was the head electrician and had charge of the dynamo which generated the current both for Aldercliffe and Pine Lea. The Fernalds had never depended on Freeman's Falls for their electricity; on the contrary, they maintained a small plant of their own and used the power for a score of purposes on the two estates.  Evidently either Mr. Wharton or Mr. Clarence Fernald himself must have given the order which had with such Aladdin-like magic been so promptly and mysteriously fulfilled. It certainly was kind of them to do this and Ted determined they should not find him wanting in gratitude. Pocketing his shyness, he opened the door and stepped into the room. \"Well, youngster, I thought it was about time the host made his appearance,\" exclaimed Mr. Wharton. \"We could not have waited much longer. Mr. Fernald, this is Ted Turner, the lad I have been telling you about.\"  Ted waited.  The mill-owner nodded, let his eye travel over the boy's flushed face, and then, as if satisfied by what he saw there, he put out his hand.  \"I have been hearing very excellent reports of you, Turner,\" said he, \"and I wished to investigate for myself the quarters they have given you to live in. You've made a mighty shipshape little den of this place.\"  \"It didn't need very much done to it,\" protested Ted, blushing under the fixed gaze of the great man. \"I just cleaned it up and arranged the furniture. Mr. Wharton was kind enough to give me most of it.\"  \"I can't claim any thanks,\" laughed the manager. \"The traps I gave you were all cast-offs and not in use. It is what you have done with them that is the marvel.\"  \"You certainly have turned your donations to good purpose,\" Mr. Fernald observed. \"I've been noticing your books in your absence and see that most of them are textbooks on electricity. I judge you are interested in that sort of thing.\"  \"Yes, sir, I am.\"  \"Humph!\"  The financier drummed reflectively on the arm of his chair.  \"How did you happen to go into that?\" he asked presently.  \"I have been studying it at school. My father is letting me go through the high school--at least he hopes to let me finish my course there. I have been two years already. That is why I am working during the summer.\"  \"I see. And so you have been taking up electricity at school, eh?\"  \"Yes, sir. I really am taking a business course. The science work in the laboratory is an extra that I just run in because I like it. My father wanted me to fit myself for business. He thought it would be better for me,\" explained Ted.  \"But you prefer the science?\"  \"I am afraid I do, sir,\" smiled Ted, with ingratiating honesty. \"But I don't mean to let it interfere with my regular work. I try to remember it is only a side issue.\"  Mr. Clarence Fernald did not answer and during his interval of silence Ted fell to speculating on what he was thinking. Probably the magnate was disapproving of his still going to school and was saying to himself how much better it would have been had he been put into the mill and trained up there instead of having his head stuffed with stenography and electrical knowledge.  \"What did you do in electricity?\" the elder man asked at length.  \"Oh, I fussed around some with telephones, wireless, and telegraph instruments.\"  Mr. Fernald smiled.  \"Did you get where you could take messages?\" inquired he with real interest.  \"By telegraph?\"  The financier nodded.  \"I did a little at it,\" replied Ted. \"Of course I was slow.\"  \"And what about wireless?\"  \"I got on better with that. I rigged up a small receiving station at home but when the war came I had to take it down.\"  \"So that outfit was yours, was it?\" commented Mr. Fernald. \"I noticed it one day when I was in the village. What luck did you have with it?\"  \"Oh, I contrived to pick up messages within a short radius. My outfit wasn't very powerful.\"  \"I suppose not. And the telephone?\"  They saw an eager light leap into the lad's eyes.  \"I've worked more at that than anything else,\" replied he. \"You see one of the instruments at the school gave out and they set me to"]]]
