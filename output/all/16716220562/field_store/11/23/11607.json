Rollo took a seat by a window where he could look out as the train went on, and see, as he said, how Holland looked. The country was one immense and boundless plain, and there were no fences or other close enclosures of any kind. And yet the face of it was so endlessly varied with rows of trees, groves, farm houses, gardens, wind mills, roads, and other elements of rural scenery, that Rollo found it extremely beautiful. The fields were very green where grass was growing, and the foliage of the trees, and of the little ornamental hedges that were seen here and there adorning the grounds of the farm houses, was very rich and full. As Rollo looked out at the window, a continued succession of the most bright and beautiful pictures passed rapidly before his eyes, like those of a gayly painted panorama, and they all called forth from him continually repeated exclamations of delight. Mr. George sat at his window enjoying the scene perhaps quite as much as Rollo did, though he was much less ardent in expressing his admiration.  \"See these roads, uncle George,\" said Rollo; \"they run along on the tops of the embankment like railroads. Are those dikes?\"  \"No,\" said Mr. George. \"The dikes are built along the margin of the sea, and along the banks of rivers and canals, to take the water out. These are embankments for the roads, to raise them up and keep them dry.\"  There were rows of trees on the sides of these raised roads, which formed beautiful avenues to shelter the carriage way from the sun. These avenues could sometimes be seen stretching for miles across the country.  \"Now, pretty soon,\" said Rollo, \"we shall come to the water, and then we shall take a steamboat.\"  \"Then we do not go all the way by the train,\" said Mr. George.  \"No,\" said Rollo. \"The railroad stops at a place called Moerdyk, and there we take a steamer and go along some of the rivers.  \"But I can't find out by the map exactly how we are to go,\" he continued, \"because there are so many rivers.\"  Rollo had found, by the map, that the country all about Rotterdam was intersected by a complete network of creeks and rivers. This system was connected on the land side with the waters of the Rhine, by the immense multitude of branches into which that river divides itself towards its mouth, and on the other side by innumerable creeks and inlets coming in from the sea. This network of channels is so extensive, and the water in the various branches of it is so deep, that ships and steamers can go at will all about the country. It would be as difficult to make a railroad over such a tract of mingled land and water as this, as it is easy to navigate a steamer through it; and, accordingly, the owners of the line had made arrangements for stopping the trains at Moerdyk, and then transferring the passengers to a steamer.  \"I have great curiosity,\" said Rollo, \"to see whether, when we come to the water, we shall go _up_ to it, instead of _down_ to it.\"  \"Do you think that we shall go up to it?\" asked Mr. George.  \"I don't know,\" replied Rollo. \"We do in some parts of Holland. In some places, according to what the guide book says, the land is twenty or thirty feet below the level of the water, and so when you come to the shore you go _up an embankment_, and there you find the water on the other side, nearly at the top of it.\"  When at length the train stopped at Moerdyk, the conductor called out from the platform that all the passengers would descend from the carriages to embark on board the steamer. Rollo was too much interested in making the change, and in hurrying Mr. George along so as to get a good seat in the steamer, to make any observation on the comparative level of the land and water. There was quite a little crowd of passengers to go on board; and as they walked along the pier towards the place where the steamer was lying, all loaded with as many bags, cloaks, umbrellas, or parcels of some sort, as they could carry, Rollo and Mr. George pressed on before them, Rollo leading the way. The steamer was a long and narrow boat, painted black, in the English fashion. There was no awning over the deck, and most of the passengers went below.  \"I don't see what they are all going below for,\" said Rollo. \"I should think that they would wish to stay on deck and see the scenery.\"  So Rollo chose a seat by the side of a small porch which was built upon the deck over the entrance to the cabin, and sat down immediately upon it, making room for Mr. George by his side. There was a little table before him, and he laid down his guide book and his great coat upon it.  \"Now,\" said he, \"this is good. We have got an excellent seat, and we will have a first rate time looking at Holland as we go along.\"  Just then a young man, dressed in a suit of gray, and with a spy glass hanging at his side, suspended by a strap from his shoulder, and with a young and pretty, but rather disdainful looking lady on his arm, came by.  \"Now, Emily,\" said he, \"which would you prefer, to sit here upon the deck or go below?\"  \"O George,\" said she, \"let us go below. There's nothing to be seen on the deck. The country is every where flat and uninteresting.\"  \"We might see the shores as we go along,\" suggested her husband.  \"O, there's nothing to be seen along the shores,\" said she; \"nothing but bulrushes and willows. We had better go below.\"  So Emily led George below.  \"Rollo,\" said Mr. George, \"if you would like to take a bet, I will bet you the prettiest Dutch toy that you can find in Amsterdam, that that is another Mrs. Parkman.\"  \"I think it very likely she is,\" said Rollo. \"But, uncle George, what do you think they have got down below? I've a great mind to go down and see.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mr. George.  \"And will you keep my place while I am gone?\" asked Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"or you can put your cap in it to keep it.\"  So Rollo put his cap in his seat, and went down below. In a few minutes he returned, saying that there was a pretty little cabin down there, with small tables set out along the sides of it, and different parties of people getting ready for breakfast.  \"It is rather late for breakfast,\" said Mr. George. \"It is after twelve o'clock.\"  \"Then perhaps they call it luncheon,\" said Rollo. \"But I'd rather stay on deck. We might have something to eat here. Don't you think we could have it on this table?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Mr. George, \"that is what the table is put here for.\"  \"Well!\" said Rollo, his eye brightening up at the idea.  \"We can have it here, or we can wait and have it at the hotel in Rotterdam,\" said Mr. George. \"You may decide. I'll do just as you say.\"  Rollo finally concluded to wait till they arrived at Rotterdam, and then to have a good dinner all by themselves at some table by a window in the hotel, and in the mean time to devote himself, while on board the steamer, to observing the shores of the river, or arm of the sea, whichever it might be, on which they were sailing.  The steamer had before this time set sail from the pier, and after backing out of a little sort of creek or branch where it had been moored, it entered a broad channel of deep water, and began rapidly to move along. The day was pleasant, and though the air was cool, Rollo and Mr. George were so well sheltered by the little porch by the side of which they were sitting, that they were very comfortable in all respects.  Before long the channel of water in which the steamer was sailing became more narrow, and the steamer passed nearer a bank, which Rollo soon perceived was formed by a dike.  \"See, see! uncle George,\" said he. \"There are the roofs of the houses over on the other side of the dike. We can just see the tops of them. The ground that the houses stand upon must be a great deal below the water.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"and see, there are the tops of the tall trees.\"  The dike was very regular in its form, and it was ornamented with two rows of trees along the top of it. There were seats here and there under the trees, and some of these seats had people sitting upon them, looking at the passing boats and steamers. The water was full of vessels of all kinds, coming and going, or lying at anchor. These vessels were all of very peculiar forms, being built in the Dutch style, and not painted, but only varnished, so as to show beautifully the natural color of the wood of which they were made. They had what Rollo called _fins_ on each side, which were made to be taken up or let down into the water, first on one side and then on the other, as the vessel was on different tacks in beating against the wind.  Opposite to every place where there was a house over beyond the dike, there was a line of steps coming down the face of the dike on the hither side, towards the water, with a little pier, and a boat fastened to it, below. These little flights of steps, with the piers and the boats, and the seats under the trees on the top of the dike, and the roofs of the houses, and the tops of the trees beyond, all looked extremely pretty, and presented a succession of very peculiar and very charming scenes to Mr. George and Rollo as the steamer glided rapidly along the shore.  In some places the dike seemed to widen, so as to make room for houses upon the top of it. There were snug little taverns, where the captains and crews of the vessels that were sailing by could stop and refresh themselves, when wind or tide bound in their vessels, and now and then a shop or store of some kind, or a row of pretty, though very queer-looking, cottages. At one place there was a ferry landing. The ferry house, together with the various buildings appertaining to it, was on the top of the dike, and a large pier, with a snug and pretty basin by the side of it, below. There was a flight of stairs leading up from the pier to the ferry house, and also a winding road for carriages. At the time that the steamer went by this place, the ferry boat was just"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22972"],["title","Rollo in Holland (#8)"],["body","in with a carriage on board of it.  There were a great many wind mills here and there along the dike. Some were for pumping up water, some for sawing logs, and some for grinding grain. These wind mills were very large and exceedingly picturesque in their forms, and in the manner in which they were grouped with the other buildings connected with them. Rollo wished very much that he could stop and go on shore and visit some of these wind mills, so as to see how they looked inside.  At length the vessels and ships seemed to increase in numbers, and Mr. George said that he thought that they must be approaching a town. Rollo looked upon the map and found that there was a large town named Dort, laid down on the shores of the river or branch on which they were sailing.  \"It is on the other side,\" said he. \"Let us go and see.\"  So they both rose from their seats and went round to the other side of the boat, and there, there suddenly burst upon their view such a maze of masts, spires, roofs, and wind mills, all mingled together in promiscuous confusion, as was wonderful to behold. In the centre of the whole rose one enormous square tower, which seemed to belong to a cathedral.  This was Dort, or Dordrecht, as it is often called.  As the steamer glided rapidly along the shores, and Mr. George and Rollo attempted to look into the town, they saw not streets, but canals. Indeed, the whole place seemed just level with the surface of the water, and far in the interior of it the masts of ships and the roofs of the houses were mingled together in nearly equal proportion.  The steamer threaded its way among the fleets of boats and shipping that lay off the town, and at length came to a stop at a pier. The passengers destined for this place began to disembark. Mr. George and Rollo stood together on the deck, looking at the buildings which lined the quay, and wondering at the quaint and queer forms which every thing that they saw assumed.  \"I should really like to go ashore here,\" said Mr. George, \"and see what sort of a place it is.\"  \"Let us do it, uncle George!\" said Rollo, eagerly. \"Let us do it!\"  \"Only we have paid to Rotterdam,\" said Mr. George.  \"Never mind,\" said Rollo. \"It will not make much difference.\"  But before Mr. George could make up his mind to go on shore, the exchange of passengers was effected, and the plank was pulled in, the ropes were cast off, and the steamer once more began to move swiftly along over the water.  \"It is too late,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"and on the whole it is better for us to go on.\"  In about an hour more the steamer began to draw near to Rotterdam. The approach to the town was indicated by the multitude of boats and vessels that were passing to and fro, and by the numbers of steamers and wind mills that lined respectively the margins of the water and of the land. The wind mills were prodigious in size. They towered high into the air like so many lighthouses; the tops of the sails, as Mr. George estimated, reached, as the vanes revolved, up to not less than one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet into the air. It was necessary to build them high, in order that the sails might not be becalmed by the houses.  [Illustration: DORT.]  At length the steamer stopped at a pier. Two policemen stood at the plank, as the passengers landed, and demanded their passports. Mr. George gave up his passport, as he was directed, and then he and Rollo got into a carriage and were driven to the hotel.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER V.  WALKS ABOUT ROTTERDAM.   The hotel where Mr. George and Rollo were set down was a very magnificent edifice standing on the quay opposite to a line of steamers. On entering it, both our travellers were struck with the spaciousness of the hall and of the staircase, and with the sumptuous appearance in general of the whole interior. They called for a chamber. The attendants, as they soon found, all understood English, so that there was no occasion at present to resort to the language of signs, as Mr. George had supposed might be necessary. In answer to Mr. George's request to be shown to a room, the servant showed him and Rollo a very large and lofty apartment, with immense windows in front looking down upon the pier. On the back side of the room were two single beds.  \"This will do very well for us,\" said Mr. George.  \"Will you dine at the table d'hote?\"[3] asked the waiter.  [Footnote 3: Pronounced _tahble dote_.]  The table d'hote is the public table.  \"At what time is the table d'hote?\" asked Mr. George.  \"At half past four,\" said the waiter.  \"No,\" said Mr. George, \"we shall want to be out at that time. We will take something now as soon as we can have it. Can you give us a beefsteak?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the waiter.  \"Very well. Give us a beefsteak and some coffee, and some bread and butter.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the waiter. \"Will you have two beefsteaks, or one beefsteak?\"  \"Two,\" said Rollo, in an under tone to Mr. George.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"and coffee for two, also.\"  So the waiter left the travellers in their room, and went down stairs. In about ten minutes Mr. George and Rollo went down too. At the foot of the grand staircase they turned into the dining room, where they saw several tables set, and at one of them, near a window, were the preparations for their meal.  The window looked out upon the quay, and Rollo could see the men at work getting out hogsheads and bales of goods from a steamer that was moored there. Besides looking across to the quay, Rollo could also look up and down the street without putting his head out of the window. The way in which he was enabled to do this, was by means of looking glasses placed outside. These looking glasses were attached to an iron frame, and they were placed in an inclined position, so as to reflect the whole length of the street in through the window. Thus a person sitting at his ease within the room, could look up and down the street, as well as across it, at his pleasure.  Rollo afterwards observed such looking glasses attached to the windows of almost all the houses in town.  The dinner was soon brought in, and Mr. George and Rollo ate it with excellent appetites. Just as they had finished their meal, a neatly-dressed young man came to the table and asked them if they wished for some one to show them about the town.  \"Because,\" said he, \"I am a _valet de place_, and I can take you at once to all the places of interest, and save you a great deal of time.\"  \"How much do you ask to do it?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Five francs a day,\" said the man.  \"That's right,\" said Mr. George. \"That's the usual price. But we shall not want you, at least for this afternoon. We may want you to-morrow. We shall stay in town a day or two.\"  The young man said that he should be very happy to serve them if they should require his services, and then bowed and went away.  After having finished their meal, Mr. George and Rollo set out to take a ramble about the town by themselves.  \"We will go in search of adventures,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"and if we lose our way, we shall be likely to _have_ some adventures, for we cannot speak Dutch to inquire for it.\"  \"Never mind,\" said Rollo, \"I'm not afraid. We will be careful which way we go.\"  So they went out and took quite a long ramble through the town. The first aspect of the streets struck them with astonishment. The space was now more than half filled with docks and basins, and with canals in which ships and boats of every kind were moving to and fro. In fact almost every street consisted one half of canal, and one half of road way, so that in going through it you could have your choice of going in a boat or in a carriage. The water part of the streets was crowded densely with vessels, some of them of the largest size, for the water was so deep in the canals that the largest ships could go all about the town.  It was curious to observe the process of loading and unloading these vessels, opposite to the houses where the merchants who owned them lived. These houses were very large and handsome. The upper stories were used for the rooms of the merchant and his family, and the lower ones were for the storage of the goods. Thus a merchant could sit at his parlor window with his family about him, could look down upon his ship in the middle of the street before his house, and see the workmen unlading it and stowing the goods safely on his own premises, in the rooms below.  In some of the streets the canal was in the centre, and there was a road way along by the houses on each side. In others there was a road way only on one side, and the walls of the houses and stores rose up directly from the water's edge on the other. It was curious, in this case, to see the men in the upper stories of these stores, hoisting goods up from the vessels below by means of cranes and tackles projecting from the windows.  There was one arrangement in the streets which Rollo at first condemned, as decidedly objectionable in his mind, and that was, that the sidewalks were smooth and level with the pavement of the street, differing only from the street by being paved with bricks, while the road way was paved with stone.  \"I think that that is a very foolish plan,\" said Rollo.  \"I should not have expected so crude a remark as that from so old and experienced a traveller as you,\" said Mr. George.  \"Why, uncle George,\" said Rollo. \"It is plainly a great deal better to have the sidewalk raised a little, for that keeps the wheels of the carts and carriages from coming upon them. Besides, there ought to be a gutter.\"  \"People that have never been away from home before,\" said Mr. George, \"are very apt, when they first land in any strange country, and observe any strange or unusual way of doing things, or of making things, to condemn it at once, and say how much better the thing is in their country. But I thought that you had travelled enough to know better than that.\"  \"How so?\" asked Rollo.  \"Why, you"]]]
