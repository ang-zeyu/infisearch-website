You must have things here; you must have money to spend, and feel the pleasure of spending it, or you will die.\"  \"Thank you,\" laughed Sergeant Hal, \"but at present my health is excellent. As for dying, that has no terror for the soldier.\"  \"Ah, yes, to die like a soldier!\" protested the Filipino, with a shrug of his shoulders. \"But would you die of sheer weariness and envy? There are pleasures in this country which only money will buy. Without the money, without these pleasures, life soon becomes bitter. You do not know, but I do, for I have watched thousands of your _Americano_ soldiers here. Now, I have money--too much! It is my whim to see that the _soldados_ enjoy themselves. I have begged many a soldier to honor me by letting me purchase him a little pleasure. Come, I will show you now! Wait! I will send for a carriage--not a _quilez,_ but a victoria. Say the word, give the consent, and I will show you at once what is called pleasure here in the East--in Manila.\"  Though he spoke in low tones, the Filipino made almost extravagant gestures. As he kept on he warmed up to his subject.  \"Shall I call a victoria?\" he asked.  \"If you wish,\" replied Sergeant Hal dryly.  \"Ah, that is the way I like to hear you say it!\" cried the little Filipino, and hastened toward the door.  He went away so rapidly, in fact, that he did not have time to note young Sergeant Overton's altered manner. From a feeling of embarrassment over having to repulse a stranger's ill-advised offer of generosity, Hal, his eyes watching the man's face, speedily took a dislike to the Filipino.  \"Come along, Noll,\" Overton whispered. \"We'll get out of this. I don't like the fellow.\"  \"You like him as well as I do,\" muttered Sergeant Terry.  At the door of the store they again caught sight of the dandy, who, with hand extended, was at that moment signaling a _cochero_ to drive his victoria in to the curb.  \"It could not have been better,\" cried the little brown tempter. \"Just as I came out I saw an empty victoria.\"  \"I congratulate you,\" smiled Sergeant Hal.  \"No, but this is the carriage, here,\" cried the Filipino, as Hal and Noll turned to walk down the Escolta.  \"Get in, then, and enjoy yourself,\" called back Hal.  In an instant the Filipino was in front of them, barring their way.  \"But you permitted me to stop a carriage,\" he protested, bewildered.  \"Exactly,\" nodded Hal, \"and we hope you will enjoy yourself. Step aside, please, for we want to pass on.\"  \"But you are not going with me, after----\"  \"Nothing was said about that,\" Hal answered, \"and we have other plans. Good-bye.\"  As the Filipino dandy once more tried to place himself in front of the young sergeant, Hal gently but firmly thrust the insistent fellow aside.  The Filipino stood glaring after them until the two Army boys were out of sight. The glint in his eyes was far from pleasant.  \"Now, what on earth did that fellow want of us?\" demanded Noll wonderingly.  \"Nothing good, anyway,\" returned Hal Overton. \"Intending benefactors don't act in that fashion. He may represent a bad phase of life out here. Let's forget him. Say, here's a store we must have overlooked on our way up here. Let's go in.\"  Half an hour later the Army boys came out of the store, each carrying a small parcel. For his first present home each young soldier had bought for his mother a small assortment of the wonderfully filmy _pina_ lace handkerchiefs made by the native women.  \"No _quilez_ around here for hire,\" said Hal, after looking up and down the Escolta. \"Let's walk across the bridge over the Pasig. We'll be more likely to find an idle _cochero_ on the other side of the river.\"  As they started the sky was darkening, and the lightning beginning to flash, for this was in early July, at the height of the rainy season.  \"I hope we find a _cochero_ soon,\" muttered Noll, looking up at the dark sky. \"I don't fancy the idea of walking all the way out to Malate in a downpour.\"  They were not quite over the bridge when the storm broke in all its force. Tropical thunder crashed with a fury that made artillery fire seem trifling. Great sheets of lightning flashed on all sides.  \"Hustle, before we get drowned,\" laughed Sergeant Hal, breaking into a fast run. \"There's shelter just beyond the end of the bridge.\"  The shelter for which both soldiers headed was a kiosk, barely larger than a sentry-box, that had once been erected for the convenience of the native boys who stood there with relief horses for the service of the old street car line.  The door stood open. Eager to make any port in a storm, Hal and Noll bolted inside just in time to hear an angry voice declare:  \"I had them picked out--two young _sergentes_, mere boys. At first they were very polite--a minute later they made fun of me to my face--me, Vicente Tomba! But I shall know them again, I shall see them, and I shall make them wish they had never been born. I----\"  The Filipino dandy stopped short as the two Army boys stepped briskly inside. He gave a gasp as he recognized them.  \"We meet again,\" remarked Hal dryly.  The dandy's companion, a big, florid-faced man of forty, in the usual immaculate white duck of the white man, eyed the boys keenly.     CHAPTER II  A MEETING AT THE NIPA BARRACKS   It was only for a moment.  Then, without answering Hal's remark, the Filipino clutched at the white man's arm, shoving him out into the rain. The native followed.  Just then a _cochero_ with an empty _quilez_ drove up. With instant presence of mind Vicente Tomba, as the dandy had called himself, held up his hand.  It was all done in an instant, and native and white friend were driving away through the gusts of rain.  \"Wonder who our friends are?\" Noll remarked curiously.  \"We know that one of them calls himself Vicente Tomba,\" replied Sergeant Hal.  \"But he spoke of having us picked out for something, and he seemed almost peevish because we didn't suit him,\" smiled Noll.  \"I can't imagine what it is,\" replied Hal, undisturbed. \"It couldn't be anything in the high treason line, anyway.\"  \"Why not even that?\" demanded Sergeant Noll.  \"Why, look here, old fellow, we're just two plain, kid, doughboy sergeants of the line. If that fellow had wanted anything in the treasonable variety, what sort of goods could we deliver him, anyway? Nothing, much, beyond our own arms and a copy of the company's roll.\"  \"Then what on earth was the fellow up to, anyway?\"  \"I don't know, Noll, and I don't much care. I've heard that there are sharks of all sorts here in Manila, ready to put up all sorts of games to get the easy-mark soldier's pay away from him. Probably Tomba and his friend belong in that class.\"  \"Pooh! Tomba has plenty of money,\" snorted Noll Terry. \"He wouldn't have to be out for a poor, buck-foot soldier's pay.\"  \"Swindlers sometimes do have plenty of money, for a while, until the law rounds them up and puts them where they ought to be,\" observed Sergeant Hal sagely. \"Let's forget the fellow, Noll, unless we see him again. Tomba is evidently up to something crooked, and we're not, so we haven't any real interest in him, have we?\"  \"Except to be on our guard,\" said Noll.  \"You speak as though you had some forebodings regarding Tomba, or Tomba and his friend,\" smiled Hal quizzically.  \"Well, then, I have,\" returned Noll Terry.  \"Not scared, are you?\"  \"That's a fine question to ask a soldier,\" sniffed Noll.  \"Well, I'm not going to waste any more thoughts on Tomba, or on his white-man companion, either. Whee! Look at that rain. It----\"  But a fearfully vivid flash of tropical lightning caused Sergeant Hal Overton to step further back into the little shed and close his eyes for an instant. Right after the flash came a prolonged, heavy roll of thunder that made the earth shake.  \"_Cochero, para!_\" shouted Noll right after that, and a fareless _quilez_ stopped near the door of the shed.  \"_Occupado_ (occupied)?\" called Noll.  \"No, se√±or.\"  Hal and Noll bolted through the rain, darted into the _quilez_ through the door at the rear, and plumped themselves down on the seats.  \"_Sigue directio, Malate, cuartel nipa,_\" ordered Hal, thus instructing the driver to go straight ahead to Malate and to take them to the nipa barracks.  The Filipino driver himself was drenched. In his thin cotton clothing the little brown man perched on the box outside, shivered until his teeth chattered. He did not propose, however, to let personal discomfort stop him from earning a fare.  Around the Walled City (Old Manila) the _quilez_ carried the young soldiers. These massive walls, centuries old, enclose perhaps a square mile of city. Once past the Walled City the little vehicle glided on through pretty Ermita. Here, passing along Calle Real (Royal Street), the driver turned into the straight stretch for the next suburb, Malate.  For months before sailing for the Philippines both young sergeants had devoted a good deal of their spare time to the study of Spanish. They had, however, learned the best Spanish of old Castile. First Sergeant Gray, who had put in three terms of service in the Philippines, had taken pains to teach them much of the local Spanish dialect as it is spoken in this far-away colony of Uncle Sam's.  To-day the Filipino children speak English rather well and musically, for English is the language of the public schools of the islands. Many of the older natives, however, even those with English-speaking children, know only a few words at most of the tongue of the _Americanos_.  By the time that the little cab turned in at the barracks grounds much of the fury of the storm had passed. The rain, however, continued at a steady downpour, and seemed good for the night.  \"We may have to be campaigning in this kind of weather in another fortnight,\" remarked Hal.  \"Fine business,\" commented Noll dryly.  \"Well, it all goes in the life of a soldier. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23447"],["title","Uncle Sam's Boys in the Philippines; or, Following the Flag against the Moros (#3)"],["body","can't hurt the soldier much, either, for somehow he's healthier than fellows who clerk or work in machine shops.\"  \"Clerking? Shops?\" repeated Noll, with a smile of mild disgust. \"Did we ever stand that sort of life, Hal?\"  \"Once upon a time, Noll.\"  \"Thank goodness that day has gone by.\"  \"Here we are,\" announced Sergeant Hal, reaching for the rear door and opening it. \"I'll pay the _cochero_ this time, Noll; you paid for our last ride.\"  On the broad veranda of the barracks, well out of the rain, lounged half a hundred of the men of the Thirty-fourth. A few of them were at tables writing home letters.  \"Did you give my regards to the Escolta, Sergeant?\" called Private Kelly, from one of the groups.  \"I didn't forget you, Kelly,\" laughed Hal.  \"Get those picture post cards for me?\" called Corporal Hyman.  \"Here you are, Hyman,\" responded Noll, opening his blouse and exploring an inner pocket. \"I hope I haven't got them too wet, and that the views will suit.\"  \"Any views will suit,\" retorted Hyman. \"My kid brothers and cousins have never been out here and one view will please them as well as another.\"  A few more soldiers came forward to ask about errands that the young sergeants had undertaken. No one's commissions had been forgotten.  \"Your leave didn't do you two so much good this afternoon,\" grinned Corporal Hyman.  \"Why not?\" Sergeant Overton wanted to know.  \"On account of the weather we didn't have parade, anyway.\"  \"I'm no parade shirker,\" retorted Hal. \"On the busiest day we're not being overworked here. We may strike something hard in the tropics yet, but so far, since reaching Manila, the men of this regiment haven't been worked more than a quarter as hard as in barracks at home. But I wonder when we go south?\"  \"Haven't you heard?\" asked Corporal Hyman.  \"Not a word,\" Hal declared.  \"I haven't, either. But we heard that the 'Warren' came in this afternoon.\"  The \"Warren\" was the United States Army transport vessel that was much used in carrying troops between the different islands.  \"We ought to be under way soon, then,\" Hal replied thoughtfully. \"I suppose we're still slated to go down among the Moros.\"  \"That's the talk in the regiment, anyway,\" replied Corporal Hyman.  \"I hope it's true.\"  \"You're one of the few that does, then,\" retorted Hyman, with a grimace. \"In these islands the real fine place for a regiment to be stationed is right here on the outskirts of Manila. Plenty of grub, kitchen-cooked; little work to do, and no danger of anything except guard duty to call us out of our bunks.\"  \"That's altogether too lazy for a soldier,\" objected Hal, with spirit. \"I don't want to see any trouble start in these islands, but if there's going to be any campaigning, I want to see the Thirty-fourth right in the thick of it.\"  \"You'll get over that, by and by, Sergeant,\" responded Corporal Hyman. \"More than half of the fellows in the Thirty-fourth have been out here in other years, and have seen plenty of fighting. Now, getting shot at by a lot of strangers is all right enough for a soldier when it has to be done; but you'll find that the older men in this regiment are not doing any praying that 'Ours' will get more than its share of fighting.\"  \"Perhaps I won't, when I've seen as much fighting as some of you fellows have,\" Hal nodded. \"I've never been in a real battle yet.\"  \"You've been under stiff enough fire, right back in the good old Rocky Mountains,\" retorted Corporal Hyman. \"You don't need any more by way of training.\"  \"Perhaps not; but I want it, just the same. I'm a hog, ain't I?\" laughed the boyish young sergeant.  \"No; you're simply a kid soldier,\" grumbled Hyman. \"All the kids want a heap of fighting--until after they've had it. When you've been with the colors a few years longer you'll be ready to agree that three 'squares' a day and a soft bed at night are miles and miles ahead of desperate charges or last-ditch business.\"  \"So the 'Warren' is in port from her last trip south,\" Hal went on. \"Oh, I wonder when we start.\"  \"So do a lot of us,\" retorted Private Kelly. \"But we hope it won't be soon, Sarge.\"  \"Oh, you coffee-coolers!\" taunted Hal good-naturedly.  The Army \"coffee-cooler\" is the man who is left behind in stirring times. Uncle Sam's soldiers explain that a coffee-cooler is a man who won't go forward, in the morning, until his coffee is cool enough for him to drink it with comfort. Hence a coffee-cooler is a man who is detailed on work at the rear of the fighting line simply because he is of no earthly use at the front.  It is not as bad, however, to be a coffee-cooler as a cold-foot. A \"cold-foot\" is a soldier paralyzed with terror; he is worse than useless anywhere in the Army. The cold-foot is ironically asked why he didn't bring his woolen socks along. If a cold-foot gets into deadly action it is said that the cold chills chase each other down his spine and all settle in his feet, so that he is frozen in his tracks. However, a soldier who betrays cowardice in the face of the enemy may be shot for his cowardice, for which reason \"cold feet\" sometimes become cold for all time to come.  Soldiers there have been who have shown \"cold feet\" in their first battle or two, and yet have been among the best of soldiers later on. But the cold-foot is a rarity, anyway, among the regulars.  \"Hello,\" broke in Kelly, peering out through the rain, \"there goes some good fellow to the rainmakers.\"  Many of the other soldiers looked. Two hospital-corps men were carrying a stretcher in the direction of the post hospital. None could make out, however, who was on the stretcher, as, owing to the downpour of rain, the unfortunate one was covered with three or four rubber ponchos.  \"I hope none of our good fellows is badly hurt,\" broke in Sergeant Noll Terry.  \"Rheumatism, most likely,\" grunted Corporal Hyman. \"Did you ever see a country where the rain fell as steadily when it got started?\"  \"Well, this is the rainy season, isn't it?\" inquired Noll.  \"Yes.\"  \"But half of the year we have a dry season, don't we?\"  \"We do,\" admitted Hyman. \"Yet, of the two, you'll prefer the wet season a whole lot. In the dry season the dust is blowing in your face day and night.\"  An orderly stepped briskly out on the veranda.  \"Sergeant Overton is directed to report immediately to Lieutenant Prescott at the latter's quarters.\"  \"I'll be there before the words are out of your mouth, Driggs,\" laughed Hal, rising and starting.  \"Hold on, Sarge,\" called Private Kelly. \"Look at the sheets of dew coming down, and you haven't your poncho. Here, put mine on.\"  \"Thank you; I will,\" Hal assented, halting.  The poncho is a thin rubber, blanket-like affair. In the field the men usually spread the poncho on the ground, under their blankets. But in the middle of the poncho is a hole through which the head may be thrust, the poncho then falling over the trunk of the body like a rain coat.  Getting this on and replacing his campaign hat, Hal started briskly toward officers' quarters.  Lieutenant Prescott was in his room when Hal knocked, and promptly called, \"Come in.\"  Hal entered, saluting his lieutenant, who was writing at a table. He looked up long enough to receive and return Hal's soldierly salute.  \"With you in a moment, Sergeant,\" stated Lieutenant Prescott, who then turned back to his writing.  \"Very good, sir.\"  Hal did not stir, but merely changed from his position of attention to one of greater ease.  Lieutenant Prescott is no stranger to our readers. He was second lieutenant of Captain Cortland's B Company of the Thirty-fourth. Readers of our \"HIGH SCHOOL BOYS SERIES\" recall Dick Prescott as a schoolboy athlete, and readers of the \"WEST POINT SERIES\" have followed the same Dick Prescott through his four years of cadetship at the United States Military Academy.  After finishing a page and signing it, Lieutenant Prescott wiped his pen, laid it down and wheeled about in his chair.  \"You heard about Sergeant Gray?\" asked the young West Pointer.  \"Nothing in especial, sir.\"  \"He was badly hurt ten minutes ago in stopping the runaway horses of Colonel Thorpe, of the Thirty-seventh Infantry. Colonel Thorpe was visiting our colonel, and only the two little Thorpe youngsters were in the carriage when the horses bolted, pitching the native driver from the seat.\"  \"Badly hurt, sir?\" cried Hal Overton in a tone of genuine distress. \"That will be bad news in the company, sir. I don't think any of them know it yet, or I would have heard it before. Sergeant Gray is a man we swear by, sir, in the squad rooms.\"  \"Sergeant Gray is a splendid soldier,\" observed Lieutenant Prescott warmly. \"It is not believed that he will have to be retired, but he may have to put in two or three months on sick report before he can come back to duty. But that is not what I sent for you to tell you, Sergeant Overton. As Sergeant Hupner was left behind on detailed duty in the United States, the accident to Gray now leaves you the ranking sergeant in the company. Until further orders you will take over the duties of acting first sergeant, by Captain Cortland's direction.\"  \"Very good, sir.\"  \"This is Tuesday, Sergeant. Thursday, at eleven in the morning, the Thirty-fourth is due before the office of the captain of the port, to take boats for the transport 'Warren.' This regiment sails for Iloilo and other ports.\"  \"May I repeat that to the men, sir?\"  \"It is going to be necessary, for you will have to see to it that all the personal and company baggage is ready for the teamsters at four to-morrow afternoon.\"  \"Very good, sir.\"  \"And, Sergeant, this is not official, but I believe it to be reliable; some of the Moro _dattos_ (chieftains) are said to be preparing to stir up trouble in some of the southern islands. In that case the Thirty-fourth will bear the brunt of it all.\"  \"I am really very glad to hear that, sir,\" cried Sergeant Hal eagerly.  \"So am I, Sergeant,\" admitted the lieutenant, who, like most of the younger officers, hungered for active"]]]
