Th' divvils pwhat shtole th' girrul can't git away, fer Merriwell has tilegraphed it all over this parrut av th' counthry, an' it's big rewards he has offered fer th' apprehinsion av th' rascals. Whin th' shtorm comes, Ben, ye want to git out from under. There'll be a terrible crash, moind pwhat Oi say.\"  \"Ben him git big money for what him do.\"  \"It's litthle good money will do yez wid yer neck shtretched, an' th' bhoys are carryin' ropes fer th' gints pwhat run off wid th' girrul. Oi'd not fool yez fer th' worruld,\" O'Toole continued, in his most convincing manner. \"Says Oi to mesilf whin Oi made up me moind ye wur wid the gints pwhat done ut, said Oi, 'Pat, me bhoy, Ben is yer friend, an' ye are his friend, an' it's up to ye to go along an' foind him an' give him a tip to git under cover before it rains.' Oi'm here. It's roight foine luck Oi found yez. A foine broth av a bhoy is Frank Merriwell, an' whin he knows ye hilped save th' girrul, Oi'll shtake me loife he pays ye well fer it.\"  The Irishman was doing his level best to win the Indian over, and his words were not without effect. After a while Red Ben said:  \"You go to um Merriwell, ask how much he give Ben to bring gal. Ask if him swear Ben no git hurt. Ask if him dare meet Ben an' swear he no git hurt to bring gal. Come soon, tell what him say.\"  \"It's darruk it will be, fer th' sun is down now.\"  \"Ben stay here. Men who steal gal leave him to watch. He stay. You know owl hoot. When you come back make owl hoot so Ben no think it somebody else an' shoot um. Must know what Merriwell him say. Must have him promise.\"  Evidently the Indian was determined to drive the best bargain possible, and at the same time he was resolved to take every precaution to insure his own safety in case he betrayed Inza's captors.  O'Toole knew the redskin well enough to comprehend quickly that further argument and pleading would be a waste of words. Once Red Ben had set his mind on anything he was stubborn as a mule.  \"All roight me bhoy,\" said the Irishman, rising. \"Oi'll do jist pwhat ye say; but don't yez be afther lettin' thim carry off th' girrul whoile Oi'm spinding toime this way. It's a bit nervous Oi am about thrampin' round through th' woods afther darruk since Oi shot thot divvil Dil Noort, but it's no more he'll bother any wan at all, at all, an' soon Oi think some of his foine friends will be in th' same box wid him.\"  \"You shoot um Del Norte?\" asked Red Ben, with a show of interest. \"Him say Irishman do it, but Ben no think it him friend.\"  \"He said so?\" cried O'Toole. \"Begorra, thot's th' firrust toime Oi ivver knew av anny wan thot had hearrud a dead mon talk!\"  \"You think you kill um Del Norte?\" asked the Indian.  \"Oi know Oi did onless a man can live wid a bullet clean through his head,\" declared the Irishman.  Out of the shadows suddenly appeared a man, who exultantly cried, as he pointed a finger at O'Toole:  \"Diablo! I have you! Traitor, this is my time of vengeance!\"  As O'Toole saw before him Del Norte, with a white bandage about his head, the face of the Irishman turned ashen gray and his knees smote together.  \"Howly saints!\" he groaned. \"It is the dead aloive!\"  A moment later, uttering a wild shriek of terror, he turned and ran blindly toward the precipice close at hand, over which he rushed, being unable to check himself when he reached the brink.  As the poor fellow fell he uttered another shriek, which was followed by the silence of death.     CHAPTER VIII.  AT THE FOOT OF THE PRECIPICE.   The strange disappearance of O'Toole, who was unaccountably missing, caused much wonderment among the searchers for Inza Burrage and her captors.  There were at least thirty of these searchers in that vicinity, Frank Merriwell being their leader.  Some hunters camped on the northeastern shore of Lake Placid had seen Del Norte and his companions, having the girl a captive, land at a certain point after leaving the island, conceal the boat and canoe there, and then strike into the wilderness.  These hunters had aided the party of searchers led by Frank to pick up the trail early on the morning following the kidnapping of the girl.  Merriwell's skill as a trailer had enabled him to follow the villains to a point in the vicinity of the mountain where, at the suggestion of Red Ben, Del Norte had sought concealment in a cave, the mouth of which was hidden by thick shrubbery.  The craft of Red Ben in covering the trail had bothered and baffled the pursuers for some time. They had broken up into smaller parties for the purpose of scouring the woods thereabouts. Belmont Bland had insisted on accompanying them, and he clung to Merriwell with a persistence that annoyed Frank, who could not help suspecting the man of treachery.  It was Merry's belief that Bland had been well paid by Del Norte while in New York to betray Old Gripper's plans and keep the Mexican posted on Frank's movements. He had no proof of this, but all Bland's actions had seemed suspicious down to his seeming illness that had prevented him from returning to New York with Watson Scott.  Merriwell communicated his suspicions to Hodge, whom he urged to keep a close watch on Bland. He then divided the searchers into five parties, leaving Bart in charge of the one including Bland, while he took O'Toole with him.  The Irishman had disappeared, and, having appointed a definite spot at which to meet, Frank's party scattered to look for O'Toole and continue the search at the same time.  Was it chance or fate that led Merry to the vicinity of the foot of the precipice over which O'Toole plunged in his unreasoning terror? At any rate, Frank was down there in the gloom of the valley. He heard the last cry that came from the doomed man's lips as he fell, and a few moments later, a short distance away, there came a crashing amid the trees, followed by a sodden thud and silence.  Merry shuddered, for he knew the cry had been that of a human being, and he felt that he would find the unfortunate wretch at the spot where the crash and thud had sounded. With his rifle ready for use, he tried to obtain a position which would command a clear view of the brink of the precipice far, far above him, but this was not easy, and up there on the mountain no living thing seemed stirring.  Darkness was gathering in the silent valley. Through the trees the western sky glowed redly, but this glow was fading and dying behind the black peaks.  That a terrible tragedy had occurred Merry was certain, but whether a human being had fallen from the mountain by some misstep or had been hurled to his doom he could not say.  He did not hesitate long.  Advancing swiftly, alert and ready for anything, he sought the one who had fallen. His keen eyes soon discovered a dark form sprawled on the ground.  \"I was not mistaken,\" he muttered, as he knelt beside the form. \"It is a man. Here is where he crashed down through the branches of this tree. Poor devil! Who can it be? I wonder if he still lives.\"  He turned the man upon his back, discovering signs of life as he did so. Hastily lighting a match, he held the blaze protected by his curved hands and threw the light upon the man's face.  \"O'Toole!\" he gasped.  The Irishman was breathing faintly, and instantly Frank did what he could to restore him. In a few moments the poor fellow moaned a bit.  Striking another match, Merry found O'Toole's eyes were wide open, but he was bleeding from the mouth and presented a ghastly appearance. He was conscious, however.  \"O'Toole, where are you hurt?\" asked Merry.  \"Me back is broke,\" was the faint answer. \"Oi'm a dead mon.\"  \"What happened? How did you fall? Tell me, for, at least, I may be able to avenge you.\"  \"It's the dead returned to loife!\" gasped the dying man. \"Oi saw him up there, me bhoy!\"  \"Who did you see?\"  \"Thot human divvil Porrfeeus dil Noort.\"  \"Impossible! Del Norte is dead.\"  \"Thin it wur his ghost, fer Oi saw him, with his--face pale--an' a whoite bandage about his head. This is me punishmint--fer havin'--fer havin' anything to do wid th' loikes av him!\"  O'Toole labored through this speech with failing strength, and Frank saw he was sinking rapidly.  \"Tell me quickly, man,\" urged Merry, \"just where you saw him.\"  \"Up yonder, me bhoy. Red Ben is there. Oi found him, an' Oi wur--talkin' wid him. Oi know Ben, an' Oi saved his loife wance by--by stroikin' up the hand av a mon who wur--goin' to shoot him.\"  It was with the greatest difficulty that O'Toole labored to draw his breath. Frank was deeply moved by the dying agonies of the unfortunate fellow, for Merry's experience convinced him that the Irishman was indeed dying.  However, Frank felt it his duty to learn everything possible while O'Toole could speak, and so he urged him to go on.  \"It's me best Oi--did fer ye, Misther Merriwell--an' fer th' girrul. Oi had Red Ben ready to--ready to turrn on th' villains--pwhat carried her off. It's your promise av protiction he asked fer if he--done thot. Oi wur comin'--to foind ye. Jist thin th'--the divvil--dead ur aloive--walked out, pointin' av--his finger at me. Oi shtarted to run away, an' thin--an' thin Oi fell. Thot's all, me bhoy.\"  Remarkable and unaccountable though it seemed, Frank came to believe, while O'Toole talked, that Del Norte still lived. That explained the kidnapping of Inza. Merry had wondered that Del Norte's late companions should make such a move; but now, knowing the Mexican's passion for her, the motive of her capture was clear.  The thought of Inza in the hands of that villain fired Frank's blood.  \"If Del"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22874"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Pursuit; Or, How to Win (#8)"],["body","lives, O'Toole,\" said Merry, \"I swear to you now that you shall be avenged, for never will I know a moment of rest until Inza is rescued and he is dead beyond the shadow of a doubt.\"  A gurgling groan came from the Irishman. Striking another match, Frank saw the man was dead.     CHAPTER IX.  THE KNIFE DUEL.   The moon came up in due time and flooded the wooded mountain wilds with its mellow light.  With the caution of a creeping panther Frank Merriwell had climbed the mountain side. He had waited patiently for the moon to rise, believing it would aid him on that unfamiliar ground. He was now in the vicinity of the top of the precipice over which the Irishman had plunged to his death.  Suddenly a sound reached his ears, causing him to crouch on the alert, with his rifle ready for use.  He quickly decided that some one was approaching the precipice, and in this he made no mistake. Twice he caught a glimpse of the man before the latter appeared in the full moonlight. When this man did appear, Frank's heart gave a mighty bound of exultation, and the butt of the rifle leaped to his shoulder.  \"Halt, Del Norte!\" he commanded, in a low, distinct voice. \"Stand in your tracks! If you try to run I'll shoot you dead!\"  Del Norte it was, and he stopped like a man turned to stone.  \"Up with your hands!\" ordered Merriwell. \"Your heart is covered by my rifle!\"  For a single instant it seemed that the villain would make an effort to reach cover. Had he attempted it Frank would have shot him down. This Merry did not wish to do, as he intended forcing the scoundrel to give Inza up.  The Mexican's courage to attempt escape by a plunge into the shadows failed him, and reluctantly he lifted his empty hands, snarling an oath.  \"Keep them up!\" ordered Merry, as he slowly advanced.  But when he was fairly in the moonlight another voice issuing from the shadows near at hand brought him to a halt.  \"Drop um gun! Ben him ready to shoot!\"  It was the redskin sentinel.  Frank glanced round without turning his head, but he could see nothing of Red Ben.  \"Shoot, Ben--shoot him down!\" panted Del Norte.  \"Ben got him foul,\" was the assurance. \"Him shoot you, Ben shoot him.\"  \"Shoot first, you fool!\" snarled the Mexican.  \"No shoot 'less have to,\" was the retort. \"Ben he no want hang for murder.\"  Frank realized that he was in a trap. Were he to fire at Del Norte it was almost certain the hidden redskin would shoot from cover. In his eagerness he had stepped into a bad snare. His wits worked swiftly to discover a manner in which he might extricate himself.  \"Del Norte,\" he quickly said, \"listen to me. We have met here face to face, and we are deadly enemies. The end of our enmity must be destruction for one of us. There can be no other end.\"  \"You are the one, Señor Merriwell,\" declared Del Norte. \"Had you shot me from cover you might have escaped. But now----\"  \"I never strike a foe from cover. We are face to face, and I propose that we settle our trouble man to man in combat. I challenge you to fight me.\"  \"Heap fair,\" said Red Ben, from the shadows, satisfaction in his voice.  \"Why should I agree?\" cried Del Norte. \"I have the best of you now. A friend of mine has you covered, gringo dog, and he can shoot you down.\"  \"Ben him no do it 'less forced,\" declared the hidden Indian. \"Him make fair offer. Let best man win. You kill him, you have gal. He kill you, he git gal. Heap fair.\"  Plainly the redskin was delighted with the proposition, and Frank saw this was the only way out of the trap.  \"Select the weapons, Del Norte,\" he said. \"I accept Red Ben as the referee. It's plain he believes in fair play.\"  The Mexican realized there was no method of avoiding the encounter, so he cried:  \"It shall be knives, and I'll drive mine through your heart, cur of a gringo! With pistols you would be my equal, but I know the art of fighting with the knife, and I'll cut you to pieces!\"  \"Knives it shall be,\" agreed Frank, still holding the man covered. \"If you have a pistol, cast it aside. Should you try to shoot as you pretend to drop the pistol, I'll drop you where you are.\"  Uttering a sneering laugh, Del Norte removed and flung aside his coat, saying his pistol was in it. He produced a knife, the blade of which glittered in the moonlight.  \"I have no weapon of that sort,\" said Merry. \"Have you another?\"  \"Here,\" called Red Ben.  Something whizzed through the air and fell at Frank's feet.  It was the Indian's hunting knife.  Del Norte was advancing, the moonlight showing a deadly look of hatred on his face.  Merry dropped his rifle and flung off his coat in a twinkling. Stooping, he caught up Red Ben's knife just as his foe rushed upon him.  With a quick, sidestepping movement, Merry flung up his hand and deftly parried the blow of Del Norte's blade, steel clashing against steel.  \"Ha!\" panted Del Norte, as he was flung back by a surge of Merry's powerful arm. \"Next time, gringo--next time!\"  He was at Frank again in a twinkling, but once more the young American met and baffled him.  Out of the shadows stalked Red Ben, holding his rifle in both hands and standing near as if ready to use it in a twinkling. The moonlight fell full on his dusky face, showing there an expression of savage satisfaction in the battle he was witnessing.  \"Best man shall have gal,\" he muttered. \"Ben he see fair play. Merriwell him best man, Ben stand by him.\"  The ground was somewhat rough. Over its broken surface the men dashed, and leaped, and turned, and circled. Once Del Norte uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he struck, but Merry leaped away and the keen blade of Del Norte's knife simply cut a long slit in his shirt front.  \"Near it that time, gringo dog!\" panted the Mexican.  \"A miss is as good as a mile,\" retorted Frank.  As the blades clashed together again Frank's knuckles were slightly cut and the blood flowed freely.  \"First blood!\" exulted Del Norte.  \"A scratch,\" was the retort.  But soon that scratch began to prove troublesome, for the flowing blood covered the haft of the knife and made it slippery. This came near proving fatal for the American youth. Again the blades clashed, and, with a twisting movement, the Mexican wrenched Merry's knife from his grasp.  The weapon rattled on the rocks ten feet away.  \"Now you die, gringo!\" snarled Frank's enemy, with a wolfish laugh.  He launched himself at the defenseless youth with frightful fury, but Frank managed to clutch the wrist of his foe and check the stroke that would have been fatal. With a surge he flung the Mexican aside, at the same time springing toward the spot where Red Ben's hunting knife lay. The moonlight revealed it plainly, and Merry had it in a twinkling.  Del Norte had followed him up, and was at him with a madness that was almost irresistible. He sent Frank staggering from the shock, and Merry tripped over a stone, nearly falling.  Seeing this, the Mexican uttered another cry of exultation, which turned into a curse as he saw the youth regain his footing like a cat.  \"Much good fight!\" muttered Red Ben.  \"I'll get you yet, gringo!\" panted the Mexican. \"I have sworn to leave you dead, with my knife in your heart. Then the beautiful Señorita Inza will be mine--all mine! With you dead and gone, I'll have your mine and your sweetheart.\"  In this manner he sought to infuriate Frank and lead him to some act of rashness.  Although Frank's blood was burning like lava in his veins, outwardly he was wonderfully cool. As always happened in a time of great danger, he laughed outright.  \"You boaster!\" he exclaimed.  Del Norte was beginning to breathe heavily from his exertions. Again and again he struck at Frank, but each time the strokes were parried, blocked, or avoided. At last he began to realize that the American was a wonderful fighter with a knife, and, to his dismay, he saw Merriwell appeared almost as fresh and vigorous as when the fight began.  \"Must end it quick,\" thought Del Norte.  But when he lunged again Frank leaped aside and struck him in the shoulder, from which the blood flowed swiftly, staining the Mexican's white shirt.  \"The fiends must protect you, gringo!\" hissed the wounded man.  \"Fair fight!\" muttered Red Ben. \"Merriwell him win, he git gal.\"  For a few moments Del Norte's injury seemed to make him fiercer and more dangerous. A little while he kept Frank on the defensive, and then he was slashed in the forearm.  Clapping his free hand to the wound, he leaped backward, Spanish oaths flowing from his lips.  \"Him beaten!\" whispered the watching Indian. \"Merriwell kill him soon now.\"  Frank followed Del Norte up.  \"Stand up to it, greaser,\" he urged. \"The fight has just begun. You have threatened to leave your knife in my heart. I could have split yours a dozen times, but I have spared you. When you are well cut up, I'll wring from your lips the secret of Inza's hiding place.\"  \"Never!\" vowed the Mexican. \"If die I do, I'll tell nothing. But I'll not die! I'll yet kill you!\"  Fancying he saw an opening, as Frank's hands were both hanging by his sides, Del Norte leaped in. He was sent reeling back with another wound, this time in the ribs.  Frank followed up his failing foe, forcing him to the edge of the cleared space. He kept close, fearing Del Norte might attempt to flee. Instead, the man danced round Merry till his back was toward the centre of the cleared space, while the dark shadows of the scraggy timber was behind Frank.  Again Del Norte rushed, but this time his wrist was seized and given a wrench that brought him, with a gasping groan of pain, to his knees.  \"Fight done now!\" muttered Red Ben, as he saw Merriwell lift his blood-stained blade.  \"You're at my mercy, Del Norte,\" said Merry. \"I can kill you with a single stroke. I'll spare you if you speak the truth. Where is Inza Bur----\"  Out of the shadows behind Merriwell darted a figure. A heavy club crashed on Frank's head.  Thus treacherously struck down, the brave youth dropped his knife and fell senseless to the"]]]
