Rossie believes the discovery should be simultaneously revealed on a world-wide basis, and let man adapt to it as best he can. I think it should be suppressed until man has grown up a little--if he ever does. The doctor vacillates between the two positions. What he would truly like to see, is the method kept only for the use of qualified scientists, but even our good doctor realizes what a dream that is.\"  Crowley took them all in, one at a time. \"Well, what the devil are you going to do?\"  \"That's a good question,\" Ross said unhappily.  \"This experiment was a farce,\" Patricia said irritably. \"After all our trouble locating Don, our _Common Man_, we have found out nothing that we didn't know before. His reactions were evidently largely similar to our own and....\" She broke it off and frowned thoughtfully. The other three looked at her questioningly.  Patricia said, \"You know, we simply haven't seen this thing through as yet.\"  \"What do you mean, Pat?\" Ross growled.  She turned to him. \"We haven't given Don the chance to prove which one of us is right. One day is insufficient. Half the things he wished to do, such as sneaking around picking up stock tips in Wall Street and inside information on sporting events....\"  \"Hey, take it easy,\" Crowley protested. \"I was just, like, curious.\"  Ross said heatedly, \"That's not fair. I'll admit, I, too, thought of exactly the same possibilities. But _thinking_ about them and going through with them are different things. Haven't you ever thought about what you'd do if given the chance to be world-wide supreme dictator? But, truly, if the job was offered, would you take it?\"  \"Good heavens,\" Patricia said disgustedly, \"remind me to break off our engagement if I haven't already done it. I hate overpowering men. All I'm saying is that we'll have to give Don at least a week. One day isn't enough.\"  Dr. Braun cocked his head to one side and said uncomfortably, \"I'm not sure but that in a week's time our friend Don might be able.... See here, Don, do you mind going on down to the hotel's bar while we three talk this through?\"  Crowley obviously took umbrage at that, but there was nothing to be done. Frowning peevishly, he left.  The doctor looked from one to the other of his associates. \"By Caesar, do you realize the damage friend Don could accomplish in a week's time?\"  Patricia laughed at him. \"That's what I keep telling the two of you. Do you realize the damage _any_ person could do with invisibility? Not to speak of giving it to every Tom, Dick and Harry in the world.\"  Ross said, \"We've started this, lets go through with it. I back Pat's suggestion, that we give Don sufficient serum to give him twelve hours of invisibility a day for a full week. However, we will ration it out to him day by day, so that if things get out of hand we can cut his supply.\"  \"That's an idea,\" Patricia said. \"And I suspect that within half the period we'll all be convinced that the process will have to be suppressed.\"  Ross leaned forward. \"Good. I suggest we three keep this suite and get Don a room elsewhere, so he won't be inhibited by our continual presence. Once a day we'll give him enough serum for one shot and he can take it any time he wishes to.\" He ran his beefy hand back through his red crew cut in a gesture of satisfaction. \"If he seems to get out of hand, we'll call it all off.\"  Dr. Braun cleared his throat unhappily. \"I have premonitions of disaster, but I suppose if we've come this far we should see the experiment through.\"  Patricia said ungraciously, \"At least the lout will be limited in his accomplishments by his lack of imagination. Imagine going into that French girl's dressing room.\"  \"Yeah,\" Ross said ludicrously trying to make his big open face look dreamy.  \"You wretch,\" Patricia laughed. \"The wedding is off!\"         *       *       *       *       *  But Crowley was no lout. He was full of the folk wisdom of his people.  _God helps those who help themselves._  _It's each man for himself and the devil take the hindmost._  Not to speak of.  _Never give a sucker an even break._  _If I didn't do it, somebody else would._  Had he been somewhat more of a student he might also have run into that nugget of the ancient Greek. _Morals are the invention of the weak to protect themselves from the strong._  Once convinced that the three eggheads were incapable of realizing the potentialities of their discovery, he had little difficulty in arguing himself into the stand that he should. It helped considerably to realize that in all the world only four persons, including himself, were aware of the existence of the invisibility serum.  He spent the first day in what Marx called in \"Das Kapital\" the \"original accumulation of capital,\" although it would seem unlikely that even in the wildest accusations of the most confirmed Marxist, no great fortune was ever before begun in such wise.  It was not necessary, he found, to walk into a large bank and simply seemingly levitate the money out the front door. In fact, that would have meant disaster. However, large sums of money are to be found elsewhere on Manhattan and for eleven hours Crowley used his native ingenuity and American know-how, most of which had been gleaned from watching TV crime shows. By the end of the day he had managed to accumulate in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand dollars and was reasonably sure that the news would not get back to his sponsors. The fact was, he had cleaned out the treasuries of several numbers rackets and those of two bookies.  It was important, he well realized, that he be well under way before the three eggheads decided to lower the boom.  The second day he spent making his preliminary contacts, an operation that was helped by his activities of the day before. He was beginning already to get the feel of the underworld element with which he had decided he was going to have to work, at least in the early stages of his operations.  Any leader, be he military, political or financial, knows that true greatness lies in the ability to choose assistants. Be you a Napoleon with his marshals, a Roosevelt with his brain trust, a J. P. Morgan with his partners, the truism applies. No great leader has ever stood alone.  But Crowley also knew instinctively that he was going to have to keep the number of his immediate associates small. They were going to have to know his secret, and no man is so na√Øve as not to realize that while one person can keep a secret, it becomes twice as hard for two and from that point on the likelihood fades in a geometric progression.  On the fifth day he knocked on the door of the suite occupied by Dr. Braun and his younger associates and pushed his way in without waiting for response.  The three were sitting around awaiting his appearance and to issue him his usual day's supply of serum. They greeted him variously, Patricia with her usual brisk, almost condescending smile; Dr. Braun with a gentle nod and a speaking of his first name; Ross Wooley sourly. Ross obviously had some misgivings, the exact nature of which he couldn't quite put his finger upon.  Crowley grinned and said, \"Hello, everybody.\"  \"Sit down, Don,\" Braun said gently. \"We have been discussing your experiment.\"  While the newcomer was finding his seat, Patricia said testily, \"Actually, we are not quite happy about your reports, Don. We feel an ... if you'll pardon us ... an evasive quality about them. As though you aren't completely frank.\"  \"In short,\" Ross snapped, \"have you been pulling things you haven't told us about?\"  Crowley grinned at them. \"Now you folks are downright suspicious.\"  Dr. Braun indicated some notes on the coffee table before him. \"It seems hardly possible that your activities would be confined largely to going to the cinema, to the swankier night clubs and eating in the more famed restaurants.\"  Crowley's grin turned into a half embarrassed smirk. Patricia thought of a small boy who had been caught in a mischief but was still somewhat proud of himself. He said, \"Well, I gotta admit that there's been a few things. Come on over to my place and I'll show you.\" He looked at Braun. \"Hey, Doc, about how much is one of them Rembrandt paintings worth?\"  Braun rolled his eyes toward the ceiling, \"Great Caesar,\" he murmured. He came to his feet and looked around at the rest of them. \"Let us go over there and learn the worst,\" he said.  At the curb, before the hotel, Ross Wooley looked up and down the street for a cab.  Crowley said, his voice registering self-deprecation, \"Over here.\"  Over here was a several toned, fantastically huge hover-limousine, a nattily dressed, sharp-looking, expressionless-faced young man behind the wheel.  The three looked at Crowley.  He opened the door. \"Climb in folks. Nothing too good for you scientists, eh?\"  Inside, sitting next to a window with Patricia beside him and Dr. Braun at the far window, and with Ross in a jump seat, Crowley said expansively, \"This is Larry. Larry, this is Doc Braun and his friends I was telling you about, Ross Wooley and Pat O'Gara. They're like scientists.\"  Larry said, \"Hi,\" without inflection, and tooled the heavy car out into the traffic.  [Illustration]  Ross spun on Crowley. \"Don, where'd you get this car?\"  Crowley laughed. \"You'll see. Take it easy. You'll see a lot of things.\"         *       *       *  They were too caught up in their own thoughts and in the barrage of demands they were leveling at Crowley to notice direction. It wasn't until they were already on the George Washington Bridge that Patricia blurted, \"Don, this isn't the way to your hotel!\"  Crowley said tolerantly, \"Take it easy, Pat. We're taking a short detour. Something I have to show you in Jersey.\"  \"I don't like this,\" Ross snapped. The redhead shifted his heavy shoulders in a reflexive protest against the confining tweed coat he wore.  \"Relax,\" Crowley told him reasonably. \"I'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23194"],["title","The Common Man (#4)"],["body","been thinking things out quite a bit and I've got a lot to discuss with you folks.\"  They were across the bridge now and Larry headed into the maze which finally unraveled itself to the point that it was obvious they were heading north. Larry hit the lift lever and they rose ten feet from the surface.  Dr. Braun said evenly, \"You had no intention of taking us to your room. You used that as a ruse to get us out of our hotel and, further, across the bridge until we are now in a position where it's quite impossible for us to summon police assistance.\"  Crowley grinned. \"That's right, Doc. Didn't I tell you these three were real eggheads, Larry? Look how quick he figured that out.\"  Larry grunted in what might have been amusement.  Ross, growling low in his throat, turned suddenly in his jump seat and grabbed Crowley by the coat front. \"What's going on here?\"  Crowley snapped, \"Larry!\"  From seemingly nowhere, the chauffeur had produced a thin black automatic and was now lazily pointing it, not so much at Ross Wooley as at Dr. Braun and Patricia. He said evenly, softly, \"Easy, friend.\"  Ross released his grip, \"Put that thing away,\" he blurted.  \"Sure, sure,\" Larry said, his voice all but disinterested. The gun disappeared.  Crowley, only slightly ruffled, said now, \"Take it easy, Ross. Nothing's going to happen to you. I'm going to need you folks and I'm going to treat you right.\"  \"Where are we going?\" Ross growled.  \"I had the boys rent me a big estate like up in the Catskills. Big place, nice and quiet. In fact, the last tenants used it for one of these rest sanitariums. You know, rich people with DTs or trying to get a monkey off their back.\"  \"The boys?\" Patricia said softly.  He looked at her and grinned again. Crowley was obviously enjoying himself. \"I got a few people working for me,\" he explained.  Dr. Braun blurted, \"You fool! You mean you've revealed the existence of the process Pat, Ross and I worked out to a group of ignoramuses?\"  Crowley said angrily, \"Now look, Doc, let's don't get on that bit. Maybe I'm just a country boy but I'm as smart as the next man. Just because some of you eggheads spend half your life in college don't mean you've got any monopoly on good common sense. I went to the school of hard knocks, understand, and I got plenty of diplomas to prove it. Take it easy on that ignoramus talk.\"  Patricia said suddenly, \"Don's right, Dr. Braun. I think you've badly underestimated him.\"  Ross snorted sourly at that remark. \"We've all underestimated him. Well, I think you'll agree that our friend Don will get no more injections of the invisibility serum.\"  Crowley chuckled.  They looked at him. Three sinkings of stomach taking place simultaneously.  \"Now, you know I thought that might be your altitude....\"  \"Attitude,\" Ross muttered.  \"... So I went to the trouble of coming up to your suite last night and sort of confiscating the supply. By the looks of it, I'd say there was enough for another ten shots or so.\"  \"See,\" Patricia said to Ross. \"You're not as smart as you thought you were. Don's one up on you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The estate which the \"boys\" had secured for Crowley was two or three miles out of Tannersville on a mountainside and quite remote. He took considerable pride in showing them about, although it was obvious that he had been here before only once himself.  He was obviously enjoying the situation thoroughly and had planned it out in some detail. Besides the empty-faced Larry, who had driven the car, they were introduced to two more of Crowley's confederates, neither of whom gave any indication that the three were present under duress. The first was a heavy-set, moist palmed southerner with a false air of the jovial. He shook hands heartily, said nothing with a good many words for a few minutes and then excused himself. The third confidant was an older man of sad mien who would have passed easily in the swankest of Washington, New York or London private clubs. He was introduced simply as Mr. Whitely, greeted them pleasantly as though all were fellow guests, had a word to say about the weather then and passed on.  Patricia was frowning. \"Your southern friend, Paul Teeter, it seems to me I've heard his name before.\"  Crowley grinned. \"Oh, Paul's been in the news from time to time.\"  Ross was looking after Mr. Whitely who had disappeared into the main building. They were standing on the lawn, as part of the guided tour Crowley was giving them. He growled, \"I suppose the two of them are experienced confidence men, or something.\"  \"Take it easy with those cracks, Ross,\" Crowley said. \"Whitely used to have a seat on the Stock Exchange. A real big shot. But that was before they disbarred him, or whatever they call it.\"  \"See here,\" Dr. Braun said urgently. \"We've had enough of all this, Don. I propose we go somewhere where it will be possible for us to bring you to your senses, and save you from disaster.\"  \"Kind of a powwow, eh? O.K., Doc, come on in here.\" He led them to the entrance, conducted them inside and into a library that led off the main _entrada_. He said, \"By the way, Larry has a few of his boys up here just kind of like estate watchmen. Some of them aren't much used to being out of the city and they get nervous. So....\"  Ross growled, \"All right, all right, don't try to make like a third-rate villain in a B-Movie. You have guards about and it would be dangerous to try to leave without your permission.\"  \"How about that?\" Crowley exclaimed as though amazed. \"Man, you eggheads catch on quick. Nothing like a college education.\" He waved them to chairs. \"I'm going to have to leave for a while. Whitely's got some big deal brewing and we got to work it out.\" He grinned suddenly. \"And Larry's got a different kind of deal. One he's been planning for years but hasn't been able to swing one or two details. It's a caution how many details a little man who wasn't there can handle in one of these king-size capers.\"  He had used the pseudo-criminal term, caper, with considerable satisfaction. Crowley was obviously having the time of his life.  \"Very well,\" Braun said, \"we'll wait.\" When the other had left the room, leaving the door open behind him, the doctor turned to his two younger associates. \"What children we've been.\"  Ross Wooley growled unhappily, \"Brother, we couldn't have picked a worse so-called Common Man, if we'd tried. That character is as nutty as a stuffed date. Do you realize what he's in a position to do?\"  Patricia twisted her mouth thoughtfully. \"I wonder if any of us really realize. I am afraid even with all our speculation, we never truly thought this out.\"  Dr. Braun pushed his glasses back on his nose with a forefinger. He shook his head. \"You make a mistake, Ross. We didn't make a bad choice in our selection of Don Crowley for our typical Common Man.\"  Ross looked at him and snorted.  Braun said doggedly, \"Remember, we attempted to find the average man, the common man, the little man, the man in the street. Well, it becomes obvious to me that we did just that.\"  Patricia said thoughtfully, \"I don't know. I'm inclined to think that from the beginning you two have underestimated Don. He has certainly shown considerable ingenuity. Do you realize that he's done all this in a matter of less than a week?\"  \"Done all _what_?\" Ross said sarcastically.  She gestured. \"Look at this establishment. He's obviously acquired considerable money, and he already has an organization, or at least the beginnings of one.\"  \"That is beside the point,\" Braun said ruefully. \"I say that he is reacting as would be expected. As the average man in the street would react given the opportunity to seize almost unlimited power, and with small chance of reprisal.\"  Patricia shrugged as though in disagreement.  Braun looked at Ross Wooley. \"Close the door, Ross. Lord knows when we'll have another chance to confer. Obviously, something must be done.\"  Ross came quickly to his feet, crossed to the door, looked up and down the hallway which was empty and then closed the door behind him. He came back to the others and drew his chair in closer so that they could communicate in low voices.  Braun said, \"One thing is definite. We must not allow him to secure further serum. For all we know, he might be planning to inject some of those gangsters he's affiliated himself with.\"  Patricia shook her head thoughtfully. \"I still think you underestimate Don. He must realize he can't trust them. At this stage, he has had to confide in at least two or three, fully to utilize his invisibility. But in the long run it isn't to his advantage to have _anybody_ know about it. If the authorities, such as the F.B.I., began looking for an invisible man, sooner or later they would penetrate the field of invisibility.\"  \"You mean you think Crowley will use these men for a time and then ... destroy them?\"  \"He'll have to, or sooner or later the secret will be out.\"  Braun said in soft logic, \"If he can't allow anyone to know about it, then we, too, must be destroyed.\"  Ross growled, \"Then we've got to finish him first.\"  Patricia said, \"Now, I don't know. Don is showing considerably more sense than you two evidently give him credit for. I think in many ways what he's done is quite admirable. He's seen his chance--and has grasped it. Why, I wouldn't be surprised that Don will be the most powerful man in the country within months.\"  The two men were staring at her. Ross sputtered, \"Have you gone completely around the bend? Are you defending this ... this....\"         *       *       *  A voice chuckled, \"Mind your language, Buster. Just take it easy or you'll wind up with some missing teeth.\"  Ross jumped to his feet as though couched with an electric prod. Dr. Braun stiffened in his chair and his eyes darted about the room.  Patricia alone seemed collected. \"Don Crowley!\" she exclaimed. \"You should be ashamed of yourself, listening in on private conversations.\"  \"Yeah,\" the voice said. \"Howeve"]]]
