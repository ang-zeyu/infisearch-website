Now, be a good boy, Son, and run along, and maybe some time papa will buy you a lemon stick,\" and at this remark there was a general laugh, in the midst of which Dan Soppinger threw up his hands, turned and left the room.  It was several days after the hunting expedition, and the Rover boys had settled down once more to their studies. This was the off hour in the evening, and, as was usual, a number of their friends had dropped in to see them.  \"Only three weeks more to the winter holidays,\" announced Gif presently. \"What are you fellows going to do with yours?\"  \"We haven't decided yet, Gif, any further than that we're going home,\" answered Jack.  \"If you feel like it, you had better come and pay me a visit. I know my folks would be only too glad to have you.\"  \"And we'd be glad to have you come down to New York and stay with us, Gif,\" was the reply.  During the days that had gone by since the hunt, the Rover boys had had several little differences with Professor Lemm. The teacher had spoken to Colonel Colby about their coming in late, but the master of the Hall had passed this matter over as being of no importance, somewhat to Asa Lemm's chagrin.  \"Oh, how I love that man!\" had been Andy's comment.  The weather had remained clear, but on Thursday of that week came another fall of snow, and by Friday this was in good condition for sleighing.  \"I wonder if we can't get up a sleighing party for Saturday afternoon and take out some of the girls from Clearwater Hall?\" said Jack.  \"We ought to be able to get some sort of box-sled down at the Haven Point livery stable,\" answered Randy. \"Suppose we call the liveryman up on the 'phone and see what he has to say, and then call up the girls?\"  This was done without delay, and, as a result, it was arranged that the liveryman should call at the school early Saturday afternoon for the four boys and some of their chums, bringing with him a large box-sled drawn by four horses. Then the boys were to get the girls, and all were to take a ride until the supper hour. It was arranged that the four Rovers should go on the ride, and also Spouter Powell, Gif Garrison, Fatty Hendry, and some others.  \"Of course, Fatty, we really ought to make you pay double price,\" remarked Andy to the fat boy, when the arrangements were being made.  \"Nothing doing,\" grunted Fatty. \"I don't weigh a bit more than Spouter or Gif.\"  \"Oh, no, not at all--only about sixty pounds more!\" remarked Gif.  Some of the girls attending Clearwater Hall had stated that they wished to do a little shopping in Haven Point before going on the ride, and so all had promised to meet the boys in front of the moving picture theater, which was a resort well-known to all of them.  \"Now if the weather only remains good, we ought to have a peach of a time,\" announced Randy, after all the arrangements had been settled.  The weather remained good, and promptly on time the liveryman drove up to the entrance of the Hall with his big box-sled, which he had filled with straw and robes. Into the sled piled the boys, Fatty Hendry perching himself up on the front seat beside the driver.  Some of the lads had provided themselves with tin horns, and they set off on the trip with a grand flourish, a number of the cadets left behind gazing after them wistfully. But these lads were not utterly disconsolate, for the reason that skating and coasting were now both very good around the school.  The horses pulling the box-sled were fine animals, and in a short space of time they jangled merrily into Haven Point, the boys blowing their horns loudly to attract attention.  In the meantime, Ruth Stevenson and May Powell, accompanied by Alice Strobell, Annie Larkins, and some of their chums from Clearwater Hall, had arrived in the town and gone to several of the stores on various errands. Then, a few minutes before the time appointed for meeting the cadets, they hurried over in the direction of the moving picture theater.  Several of the girls went into a drugstore close to the theater, leaving Ruth and May standing on the sidewalk, looking at the various gaudy billboards which were displayed there. The girls were discussing the picture of a well-known moving-picture actress, when suddenly Ruth felt some one touch her arm. Turning, she found herself confronted by a tall, heavy-set youth, rather loudly dressed, and accompanied by another boy, wearing a fur cap and fur-lined overcoat.  \"Excuse me, but this is Miss Ruth Stevenson, I believe?\" said the big youth, with a broad smile on his coarse face.  Ruth was not at all pleased by being thus addressed, for she had recognized the fellow as Slugger Brown, and also recognized Nappy Martell. Nappy raised his cap and bowed pleasantly, both to her and to May.  \"We just got back to Haven Point,\" said Slugger Brown smoothly. \"Been away a short while, you know.\"  \"And we thought we would go into the movies before going back to school,\" put in Nappy Martell. \"Were you going in, too? If you were, let's go in together. I'll get the tickets,\" and he opened his coat to thrust his fingers into his vest pocket and bring forth a small roll of bills.  \"Thank you, we are not going into the theater,\" answered May stiffly. She did not like either Slugger or Nappy, and was sorry the pair had shown themselves.  \"How about it?\" broke out Slugger, taking hold of Ruth's arm in a decidedly familiar way. \"Let's go in. You've got time enough.\"  \"Thank you, but we have something else to do, Mr. Brown,\" responded Ruth icily.  \"You can't do much outside on a cold day like this,\" went on the bully. \"Come on in--I'm sure it's nice and warm in there, and they've got some dandy pictures. Come ahead.\"  \"Sure!\" broke out Nappy. \"I'll get the tickets,\" and he took several steps toward the ticket booth.  \"Thank you, but I said I didn't want to go with you,\" said May, quite loudly and with flashing eyes.  \"We pick our company when we go anywhere,\" added Ruth, giving Slugger Brown a look which would almost have annihilated any ordinary boy. But the bully was proof against anything of that sort.  \"Oh, you needn't get on your high horse about it, Ruth Stevenson,\" he sneered. \"Some day maybe you'll be glad to go to a show with me.\"  \"If you won't go, I guess there are other girls just as good, and maybe better,\" added Nappy Martell, not knowing what else to say.  It was at this moment that the big box-sled containing the cadets hove into sight. With a flourish, the driver drew up to the curb with the boys tooting loudly on their tin horns, but this salute came to a sudden end when the lads caught sight of their former schoolmates.  \"Look who's here, will you!\" ejaculated Randy.  \"Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell,\" murmured Fred.  \"Say, they are talking to Ruth and May!\" broke in Andy.  To all this Jack said nothing. But he lost no time in leaping to the pavement and walking up to the girls, who came forward to greet him.  \"Oh, I'm so glad you got here!\" exclaimed Ruth in a low voice, and she looked at Jack appealingly and then let her eyes rove in the direction of the bully and his crony.  \"Those boys are just too horrid for anything!\" murmured May, by way of explanation.  \"What did they do?\" demanded Spouter of his cousin, he having quickly followed Jack from the sled.  \"They almost insisted upon it that we accompany them into the movies!\"  \"Why, they hardly know you!\"  \"That's true, Dick. And I think it was awful of them, the way they came up.\"  \"That Brown boy caught me by the arm, and he had no right to do that,\" said Ruth to Jack. \"I don't want a thing to do with him.\"  \"You get into the sled, girls, and we'll tend to Brown and Martell,\" announced Spouter, and the tone of his voice showed his anger.  The girls did as bidden, being assisted by the others; and, in the meantime the remaining girls came from the store and also got into the sled. Spouter and Jack strode across the pavement, and caught Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell just as they were on the point of dropping their tickets into the ticket box.  \"Come here a minute. I want to talk to you,\" said Spouter, catching Martell by the arm.  \"And I want to talk to you,\" added Jack, as he detained Slugger Brown.  \"I won't talk to you,\" retorted Nappy Martell, and tried to pass.  \"Yes, you will!\" answered Spouter. \"You listen to me, Nappy! After this you leave my cousin, May Powell, alone. If you don't, you'll have an account to settle with me.\"  \"And you leave both of those girls alone!\" said Jack to Slugger Brown. \"Miss Stevenson doesn't want anything to do with you. Now, you mind what I'm telling you, or you'll get into trouble the first thing you return to the Hall!\"  \"Oh, say, Rover, you make me tired!\" sneered the bully, glaring at Jack. \"I'm not going to try to take your girl away from you. There are plenty of better girls around Haven Point. You go about your business and leave me alone;\" and, thus speaking, Slugger Brown passed into the moving-picture theater, followed a moment later by Nappy Martell. The two others watched them out of sight, and then looked at each other knowingly.  \"One fine pair, believe me!\" was Spouter's comment.  \"I'm mighty sorry Colonel Colby allowed them to return to the Hall,\" answered Jack. \"I'm afraid it spells just one thing--Trouble!\"     CHAPTER VIII  THE SLEIGHING PARTY   \"What did you say to those horrid young men?\" asked May, after Jack and Spouter had returned to the box-sled and the driver had picked up the reins and started through the main street of Haven Point.  \"Oh, we told them to mind their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23"],["title","Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (#0)"],["body","of the Life of FREDERICK DOUGLASS  AN AMERICAN SLAVE.

FREDERICK DOUGLASS.    CHAPTER I    CHAPTER II    CHAPTER III    CHAPTER IV    CHAPTER V    CHAPTER VI    CHAPTER VII    CHAPTER VIII    CHAPTER IX    CHAPTER X    CHAPTER XI    APPENDIX    A PARODY       PREFACE   In the month of August, 1841, I attended an anti-slavery convention in Nantucket, at which it was my happiness to become acquainted with _Frederick Douglass_, the writer of the following Narrative. He was a stranger to nearly every member of that body; but, having recently made his escape from the southern prison-house of bondage, and feeling his curiosity excited to ascertain the principles and measures of the abolitionists,—of whom he had heard a somewhat vague description while he was a slave,—he was induced to give his attendance, on the occasion alluded to, though at that time a resident in New Bedford.  Fortunate, most fortunate occurrence!—fortunate for the millions of his manacled brethren, yet panting for deliverance from their awful thraldom!—fortunate for the cause of negro emancipation, and of universal liberty!—fortunate for the land of his birth, which he has already done so much to save and bless!—fortunate for a large circle of friends and acquaintances, whose sympathy and affection he has strongly secured by the many sufferings he has endured, by his virtuous traits of character, by his ever-abiding remembrance of those who are in bonds, as being bound with them!—fortunate for the multitudes, in various parts of our republic, whose minds he has enlightened on the subject of slavery, and who have been melted to tears by his pathos, or roused to virtuous indignation by his stirring eloquence against the enslavers of men!—fortunate for himself, as it at once brought him into the field of public usefulness, “gave the world assurance of a MAN,” quickened the slumbering energies of his soul, and consecrated him to the great work of breaking the rod of the oppressor, and letting the oppressed go free!  I shall never forget his first speech at the convention—the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind—the powerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory, completely taken by surprise—the applause which followed from the beginning to the end of his felicitous remarks. I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment; certainly, my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted by it, on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered far more clear than ever. There stood one, in physical proportion and stature commanding and exact—in intellect richly endowed—in natural eloquence a prodigy—in soul manifestly “created but a little lower than the angels”—yet a slave, ay, a fugitive slave,—trembling for his safety, hardly daring to believe that on the American soil, a single white person could be found who would befriend him at all hazards, for the love of God and humanity! Capable of high attainments as an intellectual and moral being—needing nothing but a comparatively small amount of cultivation to make him an ornament to society and a blessing to his race—by the law of the land, by the voice of the people, by the terms of the slave code, he was only a piece of property, a beast of burden, a chattel personal, nevertheless!  A beloved friend from New Bedford prevailed on Mr. DOUGLASS  to address the convention. He came forward to the platform with a hesitancy and embarrassment, necessarily the attendants of a sensitive mind in such a novel position. After apologizing for his ignorance, and reminding the audience that slavery was a poor school for the human intellect and heart, he proceeded to narrate some of the facts in his own history as a slave, and in the course of his speech gave utterance to many noble thoughts and thrilling reflections. As soon as he had taken his seat, filled with hope and admiration, I rose, and declared that PATRICK HENRY, of revolutionary fame, never made a speech more eloquent in the cause of liberty, than the one we had just listened to from the lips of that hunted fugitive. So I believed at that time—such is my belief now. I reminded the audience of the peril which surrounded this self-emancipated young man at the North,—even in Massachusetts, on the soil of the Pilgrim Fathers, among the descendants of revolutionary sires; and I appealed to them, whether they would ever allow him to be carried back into slavery,—law or no law, constitution or no constitution. The response was unanimous and in thunder-tones—“NO!” “Will you succor and protect him as a brother-man—a resident of the old Bay State?” “YES!” shouted the whole mass, with an energy so startling, that the ruthless tyrants south of Mason and Dixon’s line might almost have heard the mighty burst of feeling, and recognized it as the pledge of an invincible determination, on the part of those who gave it, never to betray him that wanders, but to hide the outcast, and firmly to abide the consequences.  It was at once deeply impressed upon my mind, that, if Mr. DOUGLASS could be persuaded to consecrate his time and talents to the promotion of the anti-slavery enterprise, a powerful impetus would be given to it, and a stunning blow at the same time inflicted on northern prejudice against a colored complexion. I therefore endeavored to instil hope and courage into his mind, in order that he might dare to engage in a vocation so anomalous and responsible for a person in his situation; and I was seconded in this effort by warm-hearted friends, especially by the late General Agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, Mr. JOHN A. COLLINS, whose judgment in this instance entirely coincided with my own. At first, he could give no encouragement; with unfeigned diffidence, he expressed his conviction that he was not adequate to the performance of so great a task; the path marked out was wholly an untrodden one; he was sincerely apprehensive that he should do more harm than good. After much deliberation, however, he consented to make a trial; and ever since that period, he has acted as a lecturing agent, under the auspices either of the American or the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. In labors he has been most abundant; and his success in combating prejudice, in gaining proselytes, in agitating the public mind, has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations that were raised at the commencement of his brilliant career. He has borne himself with gentleness and meekness, yet with true manliness of character. As a public speaker, he excels in pathos, wit, comparison, imitation, strength of reasoning, and fluency of language. There is in him that union of head and heart, which is indispensable to an enlightenment of the heads and a winning of the hearts of others. May his strength continue to be equal to his day! May he continue to “grow in grace, and in the knowledge of God,” that he may be increasingly serviceable in the cause of bleeding humanity, whether at home or abroad!  It is certainly a very remarkable fact, that one of the most efficient advocates of the slave population, now before the public, is a fugitive slave, in the person of _Frederick Douglass_; and that the free colored population of the United States are as ably represented by one of their own number, in the person of _Charles Lenox Remond_, whose eloquent appeals have extorted the highest applause of multitudes on both sides of the Atlantic. Let the calumniators of the colored race despise themselves for their baseness and illiberality of spirit, and henceforth cease to talk of the natural inferiority of those who require nothing but time and opportunity to attain to the highest point of human excellence.  It may, perhaps, be fairly questioned, whether any other portion of the population of the earth could have endured the privations, sufferings and horrors of slavery, without having become more degraded in the scale of humanity than the slaves of African descent. Nothing has been left undone to cripple their intellects, darken their minds, debase their moral nature, obliterate all traces of their relationship to mankind; and yet how wonderfully they have sustained the mighty load of a most frightful bondage, under which they have been groaning for centuries! To illustrate the effect of slavery on the white man,—to show that he has no powers of endurance, in such a condition, superior to those of his black brother,—_Daniel O’Connell_, the distinguished advocate of universal emancipation, and the mightiest champion of prostrate but not conquered Ireland, relates the following anecdote in a speech delivered by him in the Conciliation Hall, Dublin, before the Loyal National Repeal Association, March 31, 1845. “No matter,” said _Mr. O’Connell_, “under what specious term it may disguise itself, slavery is still hideous. _It has a natural, an inevitable tendency to brutalize every noble faculty of man._ An American sailor, who was cast away on the shore of Africa, where he was kept in slavery for three years, was, at the expiration of that period, found to be imbruted and stultified—he had lost all reasoning power; and having forgotten his native language, could only utter some savage gibberish between Arabic and English, which nobody could understand, and which even he himself found difficulty in pronouncing. So much for the humanizing influence of _The Domestic Institution_!” Admitting this to have been an extraordinary case of mental deterioration, it proves at least "]]]
