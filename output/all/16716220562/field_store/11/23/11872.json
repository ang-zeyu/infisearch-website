Mr Auberly locked away his papers, pulled out his watch, wound it up, and then, lighting a bedroom candle, proceeded with much gravity upstairs.  He was a very stately-looking man, and strikingly dignified as he walked upstairs to his bedroom--slowly and deliberately, as though he were marching at his own funeral to the tune of something even deader than the \"Dead March in Saul.\"  It is almost a violation of propriety to _think_ of Mr Auberly doing such a very undignified thing as \"going to bed!\"  Yet truth requires us to tell that he did it; that he undressed himself as other mortals do; that he clothed himself in the wonted ghostly garment; and that, when his head was last seen--in the act of closing the curtains around him-- there was a conical white cap on it, tied with a string below the chin, and ornamented on the top with a little tassel, which waggled as though it were bidding a triumphant and final adieu to human dignity!  Half an hour later, Mrs Rose, the housekeeper, a matronly, good-looking woman, with very red cheeks, was busy in the study explaining to Matty Merryon her duties.  She had already shown her all over the house, and was now at the concluding lesson.  \"Look here now, Merryon,\" began the housekeeper.  \"Oh, please don't call me Merryon--I ain't used to it.  Call me Matty, _do_ now!\"  \"Very well, Matty,\" continued Mrs Rose, with a smile, \"I've no objection; you Irish are a strange race!  Now, look here.  This is master's study, and mind, he's very partikler, dreadful partikler.\"  She paused and looked at her pupil, as if desirous of impressing this point deeply on her memory.  \"He don't like his papers or books touched; not even dusted!  So you'll be careful not to dust 'em, nor to touch 'em even so much as with your little finger, for he likes to find 'em in the mornin' just as he left 'em at night.\"  \"Yes, Mrs Rose,\" said Matty, who was evidently giving up her whole soul to the instruction that was being imparted.  \"Now,\" continued the housekeeper, \"the arranging of this room will be your last piece of work at night.  You'll just come in, rake out the grate, carry off the ashes, lay the noo fire, put the matches handy on the chimney-piece, look round to see that all's right, and then turn off the gas.  The master is a early riser, and lights the fire his-self of a mornin'.\"  \"Yes, 'm,\" said Matty, with a courtesy.  \"Now, go and do it,\" said Mrs Rose, \"that I may see you understand it. Begin with the grate an' the ashes.\"  Matty, who was in truth an experienced maid-of-all-work, began with alacrity to discharge the duties of her new station.  She carried off the ashes, and returned with the materials for next day's fire in a shovel.  Here she gave a slight indication of her so-called carelessness (awkwardness would have been more appropriate) by letting two or three pieces of stick and a bit of coal fall on the carpet, in her passage across the room.  \"Be careful, Matty,\" said Mrs Rose gently.  \"It's all owin' to haste. Take your time, an' you won't do such things.\"  Matty apologised, picked up the materials, and laid the fire.  Then she took her apron and approached the writing-table, evidently with the intention of taking the dust off the corners, but not by any means intending to touch the books or papers.  \"Stop!\" cried Mrs Rose sternly.  Matty stopped with a guilty look.  \"Not a touch,\" said Mrs Rose.  \"Not even the edges, nor the legs?\" inquired the pupil.  \"Neither edges nor legs,\" said the instructor.  \"Sure it could do no harm.\"  \"Matty,\" said Mrs Rose solemnly, \"the great thing that your countrywomen have to learn is _obedience_.\"  \"Thank 'ee, 'm,\" said Matty, who, being overawed by the housekeeper's solemnity, felt confused, and was uncertain whether the reference to her countrywomen was complimentary or the reverse.  \"Now,\" continued Mrs Rose, \"the matches.\"  Matty placed the box of matches on the chimney-piece.  \"Very well; now you've got to look round to see that all's right.\"  Matty looked round on the dark portraits that covered the walls (supposed to be ancestors), on the shelves of books, great and small, new and old (supposed to be read); on the vases, statuettes, chairs, tables, desks, curtains, papers, etcetera, etcetera, and, being utterly ignorant of what constituted right and what wrong in reference to such things, finally turned her eyes on Mrs Rose with an innocent smile.  \"Don't you see that the shutters are neither shut nor barred, Matty?\"  She had _not_ seen this, but she at once went and closed and barred them, in which operation she learned, first, that the bars refused to receive their respective \"catches,\" with unyielding obstinacy for some time; and, second, that they suddenly gave in without rhyme or reason and pinched her fingers severely.  \"Now then, what next?\" inquired Mrs Rose.  \"Put out the gas,\" suggested Matty.  \"And leave yourself in the dark,\" said the housekeeper, in a tone of playful irony.  \"Ah! sure, didn't I forgit the candle!\"  In order to rectify this oversight, Matty laid the unlighted candle which she had brought with her to the room on the writing-table, and going to the chimney-piece, returned with the match-box.  \"Be careful now, Matty,\" said Mrs Rose earnestly.  \"There's nothink I've such a fear of as fire.  You can't be too careful.\"  This remark made Matty, who was of an anxious temperament, extremely nervous.  She struck the match hesitatingly, and lighted the candle shakily.  Of course it would not light (candles never do on such occasions), and a long red-hot end of burnt wood projected from the point of the match.  \"Don't let the burnt end drop into the wastepaper basket!\" exclaimed Mrs Rose, in an unfortunate moment.  \"Where?\" exclaimed Matty with a start that sent the red-hot end into the centre of a mass of papers.  \"There, just at your feet; don't be so nervous, girl!\" cried Mrs Rose.  Matty, in her anxiety not to drop the match, at once dropped it into the waste-paper basket, which was instantly alight.  A stamp of the foot might have extinguished it, but this did not occur to either of the domestics.  The housekeeper, who was a courageous woman, seized the basket in both hands and rushed with it to the fireplace, thereby fanning the flame into a blaze and endangering her dress and curls.  She succeeded, however, in cramming the basket and its contents into the grate; then the two, with the aid of poker, tongs, and shovel, crushed and beat out the fire.  \"There!  I said you'd do it,\" gasped Mrs Rose, as she flung herself, panting, into Mr Auberly's easy-chair; \"this comes of bein' in a hurry.\"  \"I was always unfort'nit,\" sighed Matty, still holding the shovel and keeping her eye on the grate, as if ready to make a furious attack on the smallest spark that should venture to show itself.  \"Come, now, we'll go to bed,\" said Mrs Rose, rising, \"but first look well round to see that all is safe.\"  A thorough and most careful investigation was made of the basket, the grate, and the carpet surrounding the fireplace, but nothing beyond the smell of the burnt papers could be discovered, so the instructor and pupil put out the gas, shut the door, and retired to the servants'-hall, where Hopkins, the cook, the housemaid, and a small maid-of-all-work awaited their arrival--supper being already on the table.  Here Mrs Rose entertained the company with a graphic--not to say exaggerated--account of the \"small fire\" in the study, and wound up with an eloquent appeal to all to \"beware of fire,\" and an assurance that there was nothing on the face of the whole earth that she had a greater horror of.  Meanwhile the \"little spark\" among the papers--forgotten in the excitement of the succeeding blaze of the waste-paper basket--continued to do its slow but certain work.  Having fallen on the cloth between two bundles, it smouldered until it reached a cotton pen-wiper, which received it rather greedily in its embrace.  This pen-wiper lay in contact with some old letters which were dry and tindery in their nature, and, being piled closely together in a heap, afforded enlarged accommodation, for the \"spark,\" which in about half an hour became quite worthy of being termed a \"swell.\"  After that things went on like--\"like a house on fire\"--if we may venture to use that too often misapplied expression, in reference to the elegant mansion in Beverly Square on that raw November night.    CHAPTER TWO.  ANOTHER LITTLE \"SPARK.\"  Whistling is a fine, free, manly description of music, which costs little and expresses much.  In all its phases, whistling is an interesting subject of study; whether we regard its aptitude for expressing personal independence, recklessness, and jollity; its antiquity--having begun no doubt with Adam--or its modes of production; as, when created grandly by the whistling gale, or exasperatingly by the locomotive, or gushingly by the lark, or sweetly by the little birds that \"warble in the flowering thorn.\"  The peculiar phase of this time-honoured music to which we wish to draw the reader's attention at present, is that which was exemplified one November night (the same November night of which mention has been made in the previous chapter) by a small boy who, in his progress through the streets of London, was arrested suddenly under the shadow of St. Paul's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23380"],["title","Fighting the Flames (#2)"],["body"," by the bright glare and the tempting fare of a pastry-cook's window.  Being hungry, the small boy, thrusting his cold hands deep into his empty trouser-pockets, turned his fat little face and round blue eyes full on the window, and stared at the tarts and pies like a famishing owl.  Being poor--so poor that he possessed not the smallest coin of the realm--he stared in vain; and, being light of heart as well as stout of limb, he relieved his feelings by whistling at the food with inexpressible energy.  The air selected by the young musician was Jim Crow--a sable melody high in public favour at that time--the familiar strains of which he delivered with shrill and tuneful precision, which intensified as he continued to gaze, until they rose above the din of cabs, vans, and 'busses; above the house-tops, above the walls of the great cathedral, and finally awakened the echoes of its roof, which, coming out, from the crevices and cornices where they usually slept, went dancing upwards on the dome, and played around the golden cross that glimmered like a ghost in the dark wintry sky.  The music also awakened the interest of a tall policeman whose beat that night chanced to be St. Paul's Churchyard.  That sedate guardian of the night, observing that the small boy slightly impeded the thoroughfare, sauntered up to him, and just as he reached that point in the chorus where Mr Crow is supposed to wheel and turn himself about, spun him round and gave him a gentle rap on the head with his knuckles, at the same time advising him to move on.  \"Oh!\" exclaimed the small boy, looking up with an expression of deep concern on his countenance, as he backed off the pavement, \"I _hope_ I didn't hurt you, bobby; I _really_ didn't mean to; but accidents will happen, you know, an' if you won't keep your knuckles out of a feller's way, why--\"  \"Come,\" muttered the policeman, \"shut up your potato-trap for fear you catch cold.  Your mother wants you; she's got some pap ready for you.\"  \"Ha!\" exclaimed the small boy, with his head a little on one side, as though he were critically inspecting the portrait of some curious animal, \"a prophet it is--a blue-coated prophet in brass buttons, all but choked with a leather stock--if not conceit.  A horacle, six fut two in its stockin's.  I say, bobby, whoever brought you up carried you up much too high, both in body and notions.  Wot _wouldn't_ they give for 'im in the Guards, or the hoss-marines, if he was only eight inches wider across the shoulders!\"  Seeing that the policeman passed slowly and gravely on without condescending to take further notice of him, the small boy bade him an affectionate farewell; said that he would not forget to mention him favourably at head-quarters, and then continued his progress through the crowded streets at a smart pace, whistling Jim Crow at the top of his shrill pipe.  The small boy had a long walk before him; but neither his limbs, spirits, nor lips grew weary by the way.  Indeed, his energies seemed to increase with every step, if one might judge from the easy swagger of his gait, and the various little touches of pleasantry in which he indulged from time to time; such as pulling the caps over the eyes of boys smaller than himself, winking at those who were bigger, uttering Indian war-whoops down alleys and lanes that looked as if they could echo, and chaffing all who appeared to be worthy of his attentions. Those eccentricities of humour, however, did not divert his active mind from the frequent and earnest study of the industrial arts, as these were exhibited and exemplified in shop-windows.  \"Jolly stuff that, ain't it?\" observed another small boy, in a coat much too long for him, as they met and stopped in front of a chocolate-shop at the top of Holborn Hill, where a steam-engine was perpetually grinding up such quantities of rich brown chocolate, that it seemed quite unreasonable, selfish, and dog-in-the-manger-ish of the young man behind the counter to stand there, and neither eat it himself, nor let anyone else touch it.  \"Yes, it's very jolly stuff,\" replied the first small boy, regarding his questioner sternly.  \"I know you'd like some, wouldn't you?  Go in now an' buy two pen'orth, and I'll buy the half from you w'en you come out.\"  \"_Walker_!\" replied the boy in the long coat.  \"Just so; and I'd advise you to become a walker too,\" retorted the other; \"run away now, your master's bin askin' after you for half an hour, _I_ know, and more.\"  Without waiting for a reply, the small boy (our small boy) swaggered away whistling louder than ever.  Passing along Holborn, he continued his way into Oxford Street, where the print-shop windows proved irresistibly attractive.  They seemed also to have the effect of stimulating his intellectual and conceptive faculties, insomuch that he struck out several new, and, to himself, highly entertaining pieces of pleasantry, one of which consisted of asking a taciturn cabman, in the meekest of voices:  \"Please, sir, you couldn't tell me wot's o'clock, could you?\"  The cabman observed a twinkle in the boy's eye; saw through him; in a metaphorical sense, and treated him with silent contempt.  \"Oh, I beg pardon, sir,\" continued the small boy, in the same meek tone, as he turned to move humbly away; \"I forgot to remember that cabbies don't carry no watches, no, nor _change_ neither, they're much too wide awake for that!\"  A sudden motion of the taciturn cabman caused the small boy to dart suddenly to the other side of the crowded street, where he resumed his easy independent air, and his interrupted tune.  \"Can you direct me to Nottin' Hill Gate, missus?\" he inquired of an applewoman, on reaching the neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road.  \"Straight on as you go, boy,\" answered the woman, who was busying herself about her stall.  \"Very good indeed,\" said the small boy, with a patronising air; \"quite correctly answered.  You've learnt geography, I see.\"  \"What say?\" inquired the woman, who was apparently a little deaf.  \"I was askin' the price o' your oranges, missus.\"  \"One penny apiece,\" said the woman, taking up one.  \"They ain't biled to make 'em puff out, are they?\"  To this the woman vouchsafed no reply.  \"Come, missus, don't be cross; wot's the price o' yer apples now?\"  \"D'you want one?\" asked the woman testily.  \"Of course I does.\"  \"Well, then, they're two a penny.\"  \"Two a penny!\" cried the small boy, with a look of surprise; \"why, I'd 'a said they was a penny apiece.  Good evenin', missus; I never buys cheap fruit--cheap and nasty--no, no; good evenin'.\"  It seemed as if the current of the small boy's thoughts had been diverted by this conversation, for he walked for some time with his eyes cast on the ground, and without whistling, but whatever the feelings were that might have been working in his mind, they were speedily put to flight by a facetious butcher, who pulled his hat over his eyes as he passed him.  \"Now then, pig-sticker, what d'ye mean by that?\" he shouted, but as the butcher walked on without deigning to reply, he let off his indignation by yelling in at the open door of a tobacco-shop and making off at a brisk run.  From this point in his progress, he became still more hilarious and daring in his freaks, and turned aside once or twice into narrow streets, where sounds of shouting or of music promised him fresh excitement.  On turning the corner of one of those streets, he passed a wide doorway, by the side of which was a knob with the word FIRE in conspicuous letters above it, and the word BELL below it.  The small boy paused, caught his breath as if a sudden thought had struck him, and glanced round.  The street was comparatively quiet; his heart beat high; he seized the bell with both hands, pulled it full out, and bolted!  Now it chanced that one of the firemen of the station happened to be standing close to the door, inside, at the time.  He, guessing the meaning of the ring at once, darted out and gave chase.  The small boy fled on the wings of terror, with his blue eyes starting from their sockets.  The fireman was tall and heavy, but he was also strong and in his prime, so that a short run brought him up with the fugitive, whom he seized with a grip of iron.  \"Now, then, young bottle-imp, what did you mean by that?\"  \"Oh! please, sir,\" gasped the small boy, with a beseeching look, \"I _couldn't_ help it.\"  There was such a tone of truthfulness in this \"_couldn't_\" that it tickled the fireman.  His mouth relaxed in a quiet smile, and, releasing his intended victim, he returned to the station, while the small boy darted away in the direction of Oxford Street.  He had scarcely reached the end of the street, however, when a man turned the corner at full speed and ran him down--ran him down so completely that he sent him head-over-heels into the kennel, and, passing on, darted at the fire-bell of the station, which he began to pull violently.  The man was tall and dishevelled, partially clad in blue velvet, with stockings which had once been white, but were now covered from garter to toe with mud.  One shoe clung to his left foot, the other was fixed by the heel in a grating over a cellar-window in Tottenham Court Road. Without hat or coat, with his shirt-sleeves torn by those unfortunates into whose arms he had wildly rushed, with his hair streaming backwards, his eyes blood-shot, his face pale as marble, and perspiration running down his cheeks, not even his own most intimate friends would have recognised Hopkins--the staid, softspoken, polite, and gentle Hopkins-- had they seen him that night pulling like a maniac at the fire-bell.  And, without doubt, Hopkins _was_ a maniac that night--at least he was afflicted with temporary insanity!    CHAPTER THREE.  FIRE!!!  \"Hallo, that'll do, man!\" cried the same stalwart fireman who had seized the small boy, stepping out and laying his hand on Hopkins's shoulder, whereabouts is it?  Hopkins heard him not.  One idea had burnt itself into the poor"]]]
