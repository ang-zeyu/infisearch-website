The man was a Canadian half-breed.  His wife was an Indian woman.  They were both moderately young and well matched, for they thoroughly agreed in everything conceivable--or otherwise.  In the length and breadth of the Settlement there could not have been found a lazier or more good-natured or good-for-nothing couple than La Certe and his spouse. Love was, if we may venture to say so, the chief element in the character of each.  Love of self was the foundation.  Then, happily, love of each other came next.  Rising gracefully, the superstructure may be described as, love of tobacco, love of tea, love of ease, and love of general comfort, finishing off with a top-dressing, or capital, of pronounced, decided, and apparently incurable love of indolence.  They had only one clear and unmistakable hatred about them, and that was the hatred of work.  They had a child about four years of age which was like-minded--and not unlike-bodied.  In the wilderness, as in the city, such individuals are well-known by the similarity of their characteristics.  It is not that they can't work, but they won't work--though, of course, if taxed with this disposition they would disclaim it with mild indignation, or an expression of hurt remonstrance, for they are almost too lazy to become enraged.  \"Take life easy, or, if we can't take it easy, let us take it as easy as we can,\" is, or ought to be, their motto.  In low life at home they slouch and smile.  In high life they saunter and affect easy-going urbanity--slightly mingled with mild superiority to things in general.  Whatever rank of life they belong to they lay themselves out with persistent resolution to do as little work as they can; to make other people do as much work for them as possible; to get out of life as much of enjoyment as may be attainable--consistently, of course, with the incurable indolence--and, to put off as long as may be the evil day which, they perceive or suspect, must inevitably be coming.  The curious thing about this race of beings is, that, whether in high or low station, they are never ashamed of themselves--or of their position as drones in the world's hive.  They seem rather to apologise for their degradation as a thing inevitable, for which they are not accountable-- and sometimes, in the case of the rich, as a thing justifiable.  \"I'm glad I did not go to the plains this fall,\" said La Certe, stirring the logs on the fire with his toe and emitting a prolonged sigh of mingled smoke and contentment, while a blast from the bleak nor'-west shook every blackened rafter in his little hut.  \"Heel hee!\" responded his wife, whose Indian name--translated--was Slowfoot, and might have been Slowtongue with equal propriety, for she was quite an adept at the art of silence.  She frequently caused a giggle to do duty for speech.  This suited her husband admirably, for he was fond of talking--could tell a good story, sing a good song, and express his feelings in a good hearty laugh.  \"Yes, it will be hard for the poor boys who have gone to the plains, the weather is so awful, to say nothing of the women.\"  \"Ho,\" replied Slowfoot--though what she meant to express by this no mortal knows--nor, perhaps, cares.  It meant nothing bad, however, for she smiled seraphically and sent forth a stream of smoke, which, mingling with that just emitted by her husband, rose in a curling harmony to the roof.  Slowfoot was not a bad-looking woman as North American Indians go.  She was brown unquestionably, and dirty without doubt, but she had a pleasant expression, suggestive of general good-will, and in the budding period of life must have been even pretty.  She was evidently older than her husband, who might, perhaps, have been a little over thirty.  \"I should not wonder,\" continued La Certe, \"if the buffalo was drove away, and the people starved this year.  But the buffalo, perhaps, will return in time to save them.\"  \"Hm!\" responded the wife, helping herself to some very strong tea, which she poured out of a tin kettle into a tin mug and sweetened with maple sugar.  \"Do you know if Cloudbrow went with them?\" asked the half-breed, pushing forward his mug for a supply of the cheering beverage.  \"No, he stopped in his house,\" replied the woman, rousing herself for a moment to the conversational point, but relapsing immediately.  The man spoke in patois French, the woman in her native Cree language. For convenience we translate their conversation as near as may be into the English in which they were wont to converse with the Scotch settlers who, some time before, had been sent out by the Earl of Selkirk to colonise that remote part of the northern wilderness.  La Certe's father was a French Canadian, his mother an Indian woman, but both having died while he was yet a boy he had been brought or left to grow up under the care of an English woman who had followed the fortunes of the La Certe family.  His early companions had been half-breeds and Indians.  Hence he could speak the English, French, and Indian languages with equal incorrectness and facility.  \"You don't like Cloudbrow,\" remarked the man with an inquiring glance over the rim of his mug.  \"Why you not like him?\"  \"Hee! hee!\" was Slowfoot's lucid reply.  Then, with an unwonted frown on her mild visage, she added with emphasis--  \"No!  I _not_ like him.\"  \"I know that,\" returned the husband, setting down his mug and resuming his pipe, \"but why?\"  To this the lady answered with a sound too brief to spell, and the gentleman, being accustomed to his wife's little eccentricities, broke into a hilarious laugh, and assured her that Cloudbrow was not a bad fellow--a capital hunter and worthy of more regard than she was aware of.  \"For,\" said he, \"Cloudbrow is willing to wait till spring for payment of the horse an' cart I hired from him last year.  You know that I could not pay him till I go to the plains an' get another load of meat an' leather.  You will go with me, Slowfoot, an' we will have grand times of it with buffalo-humps an' marrow bones, an' tea an' tobacco.  Ah! it makes my mouth water.  Give me more tea.  So.  That will do.  What a noise the wind makes!  I hopes it won't blow over the shed an' kill the horse.  But if it do I cannot help that.  Cloudbrow could not ask me to pay for what the wind does.\"  There came another gust of such violence, as he spoke, that even Slowfoot's benignant expression changed to a momentary glance of anxiety, for the shingles on the roof rattled, and the rafters creaked as if the hut were groaning under the strain.  It passed, however, and the pair went on smoking with placid contentment, for they had but recently had a \"square\" meal of pemmican and flour.  This compost when cooked in a frying-pan is exceedingly rich and satisfying--not to say heavy--food, but it does not incommode such as La Certe and his wife.  It even made the latter feel amiably disposed to Cloudbrow.  This _sobriquet_ had been given by the half-breeds to a young Scotch settler named Duncan McKay, in consequence of the dark frown which had settled habitually on his brow--the result of bad temper and unbridled passion.  He was younger brother to that Fergus who has already been introduced to the reader.  Having been partially trained, while in Scotland, away from the small farm-house of his father, and having received a better education, Duncan conceived himself to stand on a higher level than the sedate and uneducated Fergus.  Thus pride was added to his bad temper.  But he was not altogether destitute of good points.  What man is?  One of these was a certain reckless open-handedness, so that he was easily imposed on by the protestations and assurances of the sly, plausible, and lazy La Certe.  The couple were still engaged in smoking, quaffing tea, and other intellectual pursuits, when they heard sounds outside as of some one approaching.  Another moment, and the door burst open, and a man in white stepped in.  He saluted them with a familiar and hasty \"_bonjour_,\" as he stamped and beat the snow vigorously from his garments.  \"What?  Antoine Dechamp!\" exclaimed La Certe, rising slowly to welcome his friend; \"you seem in hurry?\"  \"Ay--in great hurry!  They are starving on the plains!  Many are dead! Davidson has come in!  He is more than half-dead!  Can hardly tell the news!  Drops asleep when he is speaking!  Luckily I met him when going home in my cariole!  Okematan, the Indian, was with me.  So he got out, and said he would pilot Davidson safe home!  He said something about Fergus McKay, which I could not understand, so I have come on, and will drive to Fort Garry with the news!  But my horse has broke down!  Is yours in the stable?\"  Dechamp was a sturdy young half-breed and an old playmate of La Certe. He spoke with obvious impatience at the delay caused by having so much to tell.  \"Is your horse in the stable?\" he demanded sharply a second time, while his friend began, with exasperating composure, to assure him that it was, but that the horse was not his.  \"Cloudbrow is its owner,\" he said, \"and you know if anything happens to it he will ---.  Stay, I will get you lantern--\"  He stopped, for Dechamp, observing a large key hanging on the wall, had seized it and rushed out of the hut without waiting for a lantern.  \"Strange, how easy some men get into a fuss!\" remarked La Certe to his surprised, but quiet, spouse as he lighted a large tin lantern, and went to the door.  Looking out with an expression of discomfort, he put on his cap, and prepared to face the storm in the cause of humanity.  He held the lantern high up first, however, and peered under it as if to observe the full extent of the discomfort before braving it.  Just then a furious gust blew out the light.  \"Ha!  I expected that,\" he said, with a sigh that was strongly suggestive of relief, as he returned to the fire to relight the lantern.  On going the second time to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23372"],["title","The Buffalo Runners: A Tale of the Red River Plains (#2)"],["body"," he observed the form of his friend leading the horse past--both of them looking dim and spectral through the driving snow.  \"Dechamp have good eyes!\" he remarked, halting on the threshold.  \"There is light enough without the lantern; besides--ha! there, it is out again!  What a trouble it is!  Impossible to keep it in--such a night!\"  \"Hee! hee!\" giggled Slowfoot, who was busy refilling her pipe.  La Certe was still standing in a state of hesitancy, troubled by a strong desire to help his friend, and a stronger desire to spare himself, when he was thrown somewhat off his wonted balance by the sudden reappearance of Dechamp, leading, or rather supporting, a man.  Need we say that it was Fergus McKay, almost blind and dumb from exhaustion, for the parting from Dan Davidson which we have mentioned had proved to be the last straw which broke them both down, and it is probable that the frozen corpse of poor Dan would have been found next day on the snow, had he not been accidentally met by Dechamp, and taken in charge by the Indian Okematan.  Fergus, having a shorter way to go, and, perhaps, possessing a little more vitality or endurance, had just managed to stagger to La Certe's hut when he encountered the same man who, an hour previously, had met and saved his companion further down the Settlement.  The moment Fergus entered the hut, he looked wildly round, and opened his mouth as if to speak.  Then he suddenly collapsed, and fell in a heap upon the floor, scattering flakes of snow from his person in all directions.  La Certe and his wife, though steeped in selfishness, were by no means insensible to the sufferings of humanity when these were actually made visible to their naked eyes.  Like many--too many--people, they were incapable of being impressed very deeply through their ears, but could be keenly touched through the eyes.  No sooner did they behold the condition of Fergus--who was well-known to them--than they dropped their apathetic characters as though they had been garments.  In her haste Slowfoot let fall her pipe, which broke to atoms on the floor--but she heeded it not.  La Certe capsized his mug of tea--but regarded it not; and while the former proceeded to remove the shawl from Fergus's neck and chafe his cold hands, the latter assisted Dechamp to drag the exhausted man a little nearer to the fire, and poured a cup of warm tea down his throat.  Their efforts, though perchance not as wisely directed as they might have been, were so vigorously conducted that success rewarded them. Fergus soon began to show signs of returning animation.  A hunter of the western wilderness is not easily overcome, neither is he long of reviving, as a rule, if not killed outright.  They set him up in a sitting posture with his back against a box, and his feet towards the fire.  Heaving a deep sigh, Fergus looked round with a bewildered, anxious expression.  In a moment intelligence returned to his eyes, and he made a violent attempt to rise, but Dechamp held him down.  \"Let me up!\" he gasped, \"life and death are in the matter--if it iss not death already--\"  \"Be still, Fergus McKay,\" said Dechamp, with that firmness of manner and tone which somehow command respect; \"I know all about it.  Take one bit of bread, one swig more of tea, and you go with me to Fort Garry, to tell the Gov'nor what you know.  He will send help at once.\"  Great was the relief of Fergus when he heard this.  Submitting to treatment like an obedient child, he was soon fit to stagger to the sleigh or cariole, into which he was carefully stuffed and packed like a bale of goods by La Certe and his wife, who, to their credit be it recorded, utterly ignored, for once, the discomforts of the situation.  Fergus was asleep before the packing was quite done.  Then Dechamp jumped in beside him, and drove off in the direction of the Hudson's Bay Company's establishment, Fort Garry, while our worthy couple returned to their hut to indulge in a final and well-earned pipe and a mug of the strongest possible tea.    CHAPTER THREE.  TO THE RESCUE.  Winnipeg city, with its thousands of inhabitants, now covers the spot to which Antoine Dechamp drove his friend Fergus McKay.  At the time we write of, the only habitation there was Fort Garry, a solitary stone building of some strength, but without regular troops of any kind, and held only by a few employes of the Hudson's Bay Company, who were there only in the capacity of fur-traders.  Here the Governor of the colony received the unexpected guests with hospitality; heard the tale of Fergus with a sympathetic ear, and at once organised a rescue-expedition with dog-sledges and provisions.  While this was being done at the fort, Dan Davidson was similarly employed at Prairie Cottage, the residence of his mother, who, since the death of her husband--a farmer from the Scottish Lowlands--had managed her farm with the aid of her two sons, Dan and Peter; the latter being a youth of seventeen.  She was also assisted by her only daughter, Jessie, who was over thirteen years of age, and already esteemed an authority on the subjects of poultry, cookery, and dairy produce.  A small servant--a French half-breed named Louise--completed the household of the widow Davidson.  On reaching home, Dan, like Fergus McKay, experienced difficulties that he had not counted on, for his overtaxed strength fairly broke down, and he found himself almost incapable at first of telling his tale of disaster.  Then, when he tried to go about the needful preparations for rescue, he found himself unable to resist drowsiness, and if he ventured to sit down for a moment he fell sound asleep at once.  Those who have experienced this condition know how overwhelming and intensely disagreeable it is, especially if resistance to it is rendered imperative by a matter of life or death.  Davidson struggled bravely against it of course, but the struggle had already been so long continued that his efforts were now in vain.  Starting up from the supper which Jessie had spread before him, and which he was languidly attempting to eat, he said, almost fiercely, \"Where is the wash-tub, Louise?\"  The surprised little domestic pointed to the article in question.  \"Here; fetch some cold water.\"  \"It is full,\" said Louise with a strong French accent and a pretty lisp.  Without the ceremony even of throwing back his collar Dan plunged his head into the water, and, after steeping it for a few seconds, drew it out refreshed.  His younger brother entered the room at that moment.  \"Peter,\" he said, drying his head violently with a jack-towel, \"have you got the sledge ready, and the provisions packed, and the empty sledge wi' the buffalo-robes?\"  \"Ay--all ready,\" answered the other, for he was a sprightly, willing youth, who rejoiced in any unexpected demand on his superabundant energies.  \"But I say, Dan, you are quite unfit to start off again without rest.\"  He looked in his brother's face anxiously, for Dan had seated himself once more to his food, but seemed unable to deal with it properly. \"Why, you've got the knife and fork in the wrong hands, Dan!  You _must_ have an hour's rest before we start.\"  \"Impossible,\" returned the other with a dazed look, as he seized a mug of water and drank it off.  \"An hour's delay may mean death to Elspie and old Duncan McKay.\"  \"But let _me_ start off at once,\" returned Peter, eagerly.  \"I've a pretty good guess, from your description, where you left them.  Besides, the gale is not so bad now.  After an hour's sleep you will be able to start fresh, maybe overtake me.  Jess will be sure to waken you in--\"  He stopped, for his brother's head had bent slowly forward while he was speaking, and now rested on his arms on the table.  The worn-out man was sound asleep.  \"Just leave him, Peter, and be off wi' the dogs,\" said Mrs Davidson. \"Okematan will keep you in the right track.  I'll be sure to wake him in time to catch you up.\"  \"No, mother, not without his leave,\" said the youth, firmly.  \"Dan! Dan! rouse up, old boy!  Shall we start without you?\"  \"Yes, yes--I'm ready,\" said the poor fellow, starting up and swaying to and fro like a drunken man; \"but--I say, Peter, I'm done for.  I depend on you, lad, to keep me up to the scratch.  Lay the dog-whip across my shoulders if I try to lie down.  Promise me that.  D'ee hear!\"  \"Yes, I understand,\" returned the youth with intense earnestness.  \"Now look here, Dan, you know me: will you trust me?\"  \"Of course I will,\" answered Dan with a languid smile.  \"Well, then; come along, we'll rescue Elspie--you may depend on that. Okematan and I will look after you and see that all goes right.  Come.\"  He took his brother by the arm, and led him unresistingly away, followed by the dark-skinned Indian, who, with the usual reticence of his race, had stood like a brown statue, silently observing events.  Jessie Davidson, who was a fair and comely maiden, touched him on the arm as he was passing out--  \"Oh! take care of him, Okematan,\" she said, anxiously.  Okematan replied \"Ho!\" in a sort of grunt.  It was an expressively uttered though not very comprehensible reply; but Jessie was satisfied, for she knew the man well, as he had for a considerable time been, not exactly a servant of the house, but a sort of self-appointed hanger-on, or unpaid retainer.  For an Indian, he was of a cheerful disposition and made himself generally useful.  When they were outside, it was found that the gale had abated considerably, and that the moon was occasionally visible among the clouds which were driving wildly athwart the heavens, as though the elemental war which had ceased to trouble the earth were still raging in the sky.  \"Peter,\" said the brother, as they stood for a moment beside two Indian sledges, one of which was laden with provisions, the other empty--\"Peter, don't forget your promise.  Lay the whip on heavy. Nothing else will keep me awake!\"  \"All right!  Sit down there for a moment.  We're not quite ready yet.\"  \"I'd"]]]
