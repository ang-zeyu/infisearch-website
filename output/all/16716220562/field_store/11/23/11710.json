She was poor in arithmetic and weak in geometry, but if you gave her a rose, a bit of ribbon, and a seven-by-nine looking-glass she could make herself as pretty as a pink in two minutes.  Safely sheltered behind the pines, Miss Dearborn began to practice mysterious feminine arts.  She flew at Rebecca's tight braids, opened the strands and rebraided them loosely; bit and tore the red, white, and blue ribbon in two and tied the braids separately.  Then with nimble fingers she pulled out little tendrils of hair behind the ears and around the nape of the neck. After a glance of acute disapproval directed at the stiff balloon skirt she knelt on the ground and gave a strenuous embrace to Rebecca's knees, murmuring, between her hugs, \"Starch must be cheap at the brick house!\"  This particular line of beauty attained, there ensued great pinchings of ruffles; the fingers that could never hold a ferule nor snap children's ears being incomparable fluting-irons. Next the sash was scornfully untied, and tightened to suggest something resembling a waist.  The chastened bows that had been squat, dowdy, spiritless, were given tweaks, flirts, bracing little pokes and dabs, till, acknowledging a master hand, they stood up, piquant, pert, smart, alert!  Pride of bearing was now infused into the flattened lace at the neck, and a pin (removed at some sacrifice from her own toilette) was darned in at the back to prevent any cowardly lapsing. The short white cotton gloves that called attention to the tanned wrists and arms were stripped off and put in her own pocket. Then the wreath of pine-cones was adjusted at a heretofore unimagined angle, the hair was pulled softly into a fluffy frame, and finally, as she met Rebecca's grateful eyes, she gave her two approving, triumphant kisses. In a second the sensitive face lighted into happiness; pleased dimples appeared in the cheeks, the kissed mouth was as red as a rose, and the little fright that had walked behind the pine-tree stepped out on the other side Rebecca, the lovely.  As to the relative value of Miss Dearborn's accomplishments, the decision must be left to the gentle reader; but though it is certain that children should be properly grounded in mathematics, no heart of flesh could bear to hear Miss Dearborn's methods vilified who had seen her patting, pulling, squeezing Rebecca from ugliness into beauty.  Now all was ready; the moment of fate was absolutely at hand; the fife and drum corps led the way and the States followed; but what actually happened Rebecca never knew; she lived through the hours in a waking dream. Every little detail was a facet of light that reflected sparkles, and among them all she was fairly dazzled. The brass band played inspiring strains; the mayor spoke eloquently on great themes; the people cheered; then the rope on which so much depended was put into the children's hands, they applied superhuman strength to their task, and the flag mounted, mounted, smoothly and slowly, and slowly unwound and stretched itself until its splendid size and beauty were revealed against the maples and pines and blue New England sky.  Then after cheers upon cheers and after a patriotic chorus by the church choirs, the State of Maine mounted the platform, vaguely conscious that she was to recite a poem, though for the life of her she could not remember a single word.  \"Speak up loud and clear, Rebecky,\" whispered Uncle Sam in the front row, but she could scarcely hear her own voice when, tremblingly, she began her first line.  After that she gathered strength, and the poem \"said itself,\" while the dream went on. She saw her friend Adam Ladd leaning against a tree; Aunt Jane and Aunt Miranda palpitating with nervousness; Clara Belle Simpson gazing cross-eyed but adoring from a seat on the side; and in the far, far distance, on the very outskirts of the crowd, a tall man standing in a wagon--a tall, loose-jointed man with red upturned mustaches, and a gaunt white horse whose head was turned toward the Acreville road.  Loud applause greeted the State of Maine, the slender little white-clad figure standing on the mossy boulder that had been used as the centre of the platform. The sun came up from behind a great maple and shone full on the star-spangled banner, making it more dazzling than ever, so that its beauty drew all eyes upward.  Abner Simpson lifted his vagrant shifting gaze to its softly fluttering folds and its splendid massing of colors, thinking:--  \"I don't know's anybody'd ought to steal a flag, the thunderin' idjuts seem to set such store by it, and what is it, anyway? Nothin' but a sheet o' buntin'!'\"  Nothing but a sheet of bunting? He looked curiously at the rapt faces of the mothers, their babies asleep in their arms; the parted lips and shining eyes of the white-clad girls; at Cap'n Lord, who had been in Libby Prison, and Nat Strout, who had left an arm at Bull Run; at the friendly, jostling crowd of farmers, happy, eager, absorbed, their throats ready to burst with cheers. Then the breeze served, and he heard Rebecca's clear voice saying:--    \"For it's your star, my star, all the stars together,   That make our country's flag so proud   To float in the bright fall weather!\"  \"Talk about stars! She's got a couple of 'em right in her head,\" thought Simpson. \"If I ever seen a young one like that layin' on anybody's doorstep I'd hook her quicker'n a wink, though I've got plenty to home, the Lord knows! And I wouldn't swap her off neither.--Spunky little creeter, too; settin' up in the wagon lookin' 'bout's big as a pint o' cider, but keepin' right after the flag!--I vow I'm 'bout sick o' my job! Never with the crowd, allers jest on the outside, 's if I wa'n't as good's they be! If it paid well, mebbe would n't mind, but they're so thunderin' stingy round here, they don't leave out anything decent for you to take from 'em, yet you're reskin' your liberty 'n' reputation jest the same!--Countin' the poor pickin's 'n' the time I lose in jail I might most's well be done with it 'n' work out by the day, as the folks want me to; I'd make 'bout's much, n' I don' know's it would be any harder!\"  He could see Rebecca stepping down from the platform, while his own red-headed little girl stood up on her bench, waving her hat with one hand, her handkerchief with the other, and stamping with both feet.  Now a man sitting beside the mayor rose from his chair and Abner heard him call:--  \"Three cheers for the women who made the flag!\"  \"Hip, hip, hurrah!\"  \"Three cheers for the State of Maine!\"  \"Hip, hip, hurrah!\"  \"Three cheers for the girl who saved the flag from the hands of the enemy!\"  \"Hip, hip, hurrah!\"  It was the Edgewood minister, whose full, vibrant voice was of the sort to move a crowd. His words rang out into the clear air and were carried from lip to lip. Hands clapped, feet stamped, hats swung, while the loud huzzahs might almost have wakened the echoes on old Mount Ossipee.  The tall, loose-jointed man sat down in the wagon suddenly and took up the reins.  \"They're gettin' a little mite personal, and I guess it's 'bout time for you to be goin', Simpson!\"  The tone was jocular, but the red mustaches drooped, and the half-hearted cut he gave to start the white mare on her homeward journey showed that he was not in his usual reckless mood.  \"It's a lie!\" he burst out in a vindictive undertone, as the mare swung into her long gait. \"It's a lie! I thought 't was somebody's wash!  I ain't an enemy!\"  While the crowd at the raising dispersed in happy family groups to their picnics in the woods; while the Goddess of Liberty, Uncle Sam, Columbia, and the proud States lunched grandly in the Grange Hall with distinguished guests and scarred veterans of two wars, the lonely man drove, and drove, and drove through silent woods and dull, sleepy villages, never alighting to replenish his wardrobe or his stock of swapping material.  At dusk he reached a miserable tumble-down house on the edge of a pond.  The faithful wife with the sad mouth and the habitual look of anxiety in her faded eyes came to the door at the sound of wheels and went doggedly to the horse-shed to help him unharness. \"You did n't expect to see me back to-night, did you?\" he asked satirically; \"leastwise not with this same horse? Well, I'm here! You need n't be scairt to look under the wagon-seat, there ain't nothin' there, not even my supper, so I hope you're suited for once! No, I guess I ain't goin' to be an angel right away, neither. There wa'n't nothin' but flags layin' roun' loose down Riverboro way, 'n' whatever they say, I ain't sech a hound as to steal a flag!\"  It was natural that young Riverboro should have red, white, and blue dreams on the night after the new flag was raised.  A stranger thing, perhaps, is the fact that Abner Simpson should lie down on his hard bed with the flutter of bunting before his eyes, and a whirl of unaccustomed words in his mind.  \"For it is your star, my star, all our stars together.\"  \"I'm sick of goin' it alone,\" he thought; \"I guess I'll try the other road for a spell;\" and with that he fell asleep."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23153"],["title","The Big Bounce (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustration.

TEVIS  _Seeing it in action, anybody would quaver in alarm: What hath Farnsworth overwrought?_  Illustrated by Johnson        \"Let me show you something,\" Farnsworth said. He set his near-empty drink--a Bacardi martini--on the mantel and waddled out of the room toward the basement.  I sat in my big leather chair, feeling very peaceful with the world, watching the fire. Whatever Farnsworth would have to show to-night would be far more entertaining than watching T.V.--my custom on other evenings. Farnsworth, with his four labs in the house and his very tricky mind, never failed to provide my best night of the week.  When he returned, after a moment, he had with him a small box, about three inches square. He held this carefully in one hand and stood by the fireplace dramatically--or as dramatically as a very small, very fat man with pink cheeks can stand by a fireplace of the sort that seems to demand a big man with tweeds, pipe and, perhaps, a saber wound.  Anyway, he held the box dramatically and he said, \"Last week, I was playing around in the chem lab, trying to make a new kind of rubber eraser. Did quite well with the other drafting equipment, you know, especially the dimensional curve and the photosensitive ink. Well, I approached the job by trying for a material that would absorb graphite without abrading paper.\"  I was a little disappointed with this; it sounded pretty tame. But I said, \"How did it come out?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He screwed his pudgy face up thoughtfully. \"Synthesized the material, all right, and it seems to work, but the interesting thing is that it has a certain--ah--secondary property that would make it quite awkward to use. Interesting property, though. Unique, I am inclined to believe.\"  This began to sound more like it. \"And what property is that?\" I poured myself a shot of straight rum from the bottle sitting on the table beside me. I did not like straight rum, but I preferred it to Farnsworth's rather imaginative cocktails.  \"I'll show you, John,\" he said. He opened the box and I could see that it was packed with some kind of batting. He fished in this and withdrew a gray ball about the size of a golfball and set the box on the mantel.  \"And that's the--eraser?\" I asked.  \"Yes,\" he said. Then he squatted down, held the ball about a half-inch from the floor, dropped it.  It bounced, naturally enough. Then it bounced again. And again. Only this was not natural, for on the second bounce the ball went higher in the air than on the first, and on the third bounce higher still. After a half minute, my eyes were bugging out and the little ball was bouncing four feet in the air and going higher each time.  I grabbed my glass. \"What the hell!\" I said.  Farnsworth caught the ball in a pudgy hand and held it. He was smiling a little sheepishly. \"Interesting effect, isn't it?\"  \"Now wait a minute,\" I said, beginning to think about it. \"What's the gimmick? What kind of motor do you have in that thing?\"  His eyes were wide and a little hurt. \"No gimmick, John. None at all. Just a very peculiar molecular structure.\"  \"Structure!\" I said. \"Bouncing balls just don't pick up energy out of nowhere, I don't care how their molecules are put together. And you don't get energy out without putting energy in.\"  \"Oh,\" he said, \"that's the really interesting thing. Of course you're right; energy _does_ go into the ball. Here, I'll show you.\"  He let the ball drop again and it began bouncing, higher and higher, until it was hitting the ceiling. Farnsworth reached out to catch it, but he fumbled and the thing glanced off his hand, hit the mantelpiece and zipped across the room. It banged into the far wall, richocheted, banked off three other walls, picking up speed all the time.  When it whizzed by me like a rifle bullet, I began to get worried, but it hit against one of the heavy draperies by the window and this damped its motion enough so that it fell to the floor.         *       *       *       *       *  It started bouncing again immediately, but Farnsworth scrambled across the room and grabbed it. He was perspiring a little and he began instantly to transfer the ball from one hand to another and back again as if it were hot.  \"Here,\" he said, and handed it to me.  I almost dropped it.  \"It's like a ball of ice!\" I said. \"Have you been keeping it in the refrigerator?\"  \"No. As a matter of fact, it was at room temperature a few minutes ago.\"  \"Now wait a minute,\" I said. \"I only teach physics in high school, but I know better than that. Moving around in warm air doesn't make anything cold except by evaporation.\"  \"Well, there's your input and output, John,\" he said. \"The ball lost heat and took on motion. Simple conversion.\"  My jaw must have dropped to my waist. \"Do you mean that that little thing is converting heat to kinetic energy?\"  \"Apparently.\"  \"But that's impossible!\"  He was beginning to smile thoughtfully. The ball was not as cold now as it had been and I was holding it in my lap.  \"A steam engine does it,\" he said, \"and a steam turbine. Of course, they're not very efficient.\"  \"They work mechanically, too, and only because water expands when it turns to steam.\"  \"This seems to do it differently,\" he said, sipping thoughtfully at his dark-brown martini. \"I don't know exactly how--maybe something piezo-electric about the way its molecules slide about. I ran some tests--measured its impact energy in foot pounds and compared that with the heat loss in BTUs. Seemed to be about 98 per cent efficient, as close as I could tell. Apparently it converts heat into bounce very well. Interesting, isn't it?\"  \"_Interesting?_\" I almost came flying out of my chair. My mind was beginning to spin like crazy. \"If you're not pulling my leg with this thing, Farnsworth, you've got something by the tail there that's just a little bit bigger than the discovery of fire.\"  He blushed modestly. \"I'd rather thought that myself,\" he admitted.  \"Good Lord, look at the heat that's available!\" I said, getting really excited now.         *       *       *       *       *  Farnsworth was still smiling, very pleased with himself. \"I suppose you could put this thing in a box, with convection fins, and let it bounce around inside--\"  \"I'm way ahead of you,\" I said. \"But that wouldn't work. All your kinetic energy would go right back to heat, on impact--and eventually that little ball would build up enough speed to blast its way through any box you could build.\"  \"Then how would you work it?\"  \"Well,\" I said, choking down the rest of my rum, \"you'd seal the ball in a big steel cylinder, attach the cylinder to a crankshaft and flywheel, give the thing a shake to start the ball bouncing back and forth, and let it run like a gasoline engine or something. It would get all the heat it needed from the air in a normal room. Mount the apparatus in your house and it would pump your water, operate a generator and keep you cool at the same time!\"  I sat down again, shakily, and began pouring myself another drink.  Farnsworth had taken the ball from me and was carefully putting it back in its padded box. He was visibly showing excitement, too; I could see that his cheeks were ruddier and his eyes even brighter than normal. \"But what if you want the cooling and don't have any work to be done?\"  \"Simple,\" I said. \"You just let the machine turn a flywheel or lift weights and drop them, or something like that, outside your house. You have an air intake inside. And if, in the winter, you don't want to lose heat, you just mount the thing in an outside building, attach it to your generator and use the power to do whatever you want--heat your house, say. There's plenty of heat in the outside air even in December.\"  \"John,\" said Farnsworth, \"you are very ingenious. It might work.\"  \"Of course it'll work.\" Pictures were beginning to light up in my head. \"And don't you realize that this is the answer to the solar power problem? Why, mirrors and selenium are, at best, ten per cent efficient! Think of big pumping stations on the Sahara! All that heat, all that need for power, for irrigation!\" I paused a moment for effect. \"Farnsworth, this can change the very shape of the Earth!\"  Farnsworth seemed to be lost in thought. Finally he looked at me strangely and said, \"Perhaps we had better try to build a model.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I was so excited by the thing that I couldn't sleep that night. I kept dreaming of power stations, ocean liners, even automobiles, being operated by balls bouncing back and forth in cylinders.  I even worked out a spaceship in my mind, a bullet-shaped affair with a huge rubber ball on its end, gyroscopes to keep it oriented properly, the ball serving as solution to that biggest of missile-engineering problems, excess heat. You'd build a huge concrete launching field, supported all the way down to bedrock, hop in the ship and start bouncing. Of course it would be kind of a rough ride....  In the morning, I called my superintendent and told him to get a substitute for the rest of the week; I was going to be busy.  Then I started working in the machine shop in Farnsworth's basement, trying to turn out a working model of a device that, by means of a crankshaft, oleo dampers and a reciprocating cylinder, would pick up some of that random kinetic energy from the bouncing ball and do something useful with it, like turning a drive shaft. I was just working out a convection-and-air pump system for circulating hot air around the ball when Farnsworth came in.  He had tucked carefully under his arm a sphere of about the size of a basketball and, if he had made it to my"]]]
