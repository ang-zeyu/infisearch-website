But it will do you no good.\"  \"No?\" questioned Uncle Sam's young soldier. \"Why not?\"  \"There is but one way out of here.\"  \"And then?\"  \"To pass out that way you must go by a dozen of my men, and you can judge for yourself what that will mean.\"  \"Yes; I have an idea,\" nodded Hal thoughtfully.  \"Then you see the folly of thinking you can escape?\"  \"No; I am thinking that your men will be able to get me.\"  \"To be sure.\"  \"Yet I am quick, Tomba, and before they can finish me, I shall have settled my score with you for good and all.\"  \"And thrown away your own life?\"  \"You forget that I am a soldier, Tomba. I am inclined to feel that it will be worth even my own life to make sure that you are where you can no longer plot against the American Government.\"  \"But your own life, Señor Sergente?\"  \"My own life is less than worthless to me if I may be permitted to lose it in doing one last valuable act for the Flag of my country.\"  \"You are boasting now!\"  \"As to that, Tomba, you will soon be in a position to know. And I warn you that the slightest sign of treachery on your part will be my excuse for ridding these islands of the disgrace of your presence.\"  \"You are attempting too much,\" jeered the little brown man. \"I see and I admit that you are brave, yet you are bound to lose.\"  \"The time for talking is past, Tomba, and now we come to action,\" returned the Army boy, speaking slowly and easily. \"Come, get upon your feet and obey every order of mine the instant that you receive it. In another minute or two you and I will be in the sunlight again--or else you and I have both already had our last glimpse of the light of day.\"  Tomba smiled, though he felt the mastery of this young wearer of Uncle Sam's uniform.  \"Get up on your feet,\" ordered Hal. \"Stand right before me, your back to me. Do you feel the point of the creese?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Tomba in a low voice, though the brown man spoke steadily.  \"You will walk before me, very slowly. If you attempt to turn, or to disobey, I shall know what to do with this wavy-bladed creese. If you make a move to spring away from me, I shall show you how good a jumper I am--and then the creese! Now, walk, very slowly, toward the exit from this place.\"  [Illustration: \"Steady, Now, Tomba!\"]  As they started Hal held the lantern with his left hand so that the rays of light flashed ahead of them.  Vicente Tomba walked to the far end of this underground room. As far as young Overton's eyes could see they were moving toward a blank wall.  \"Halt!\" commanded the young sergeant easily.  Tomba obeyed.  \"You are taking me to a secret door?\"  \"It is so, señor.\"  \"And you know how to open it?\"  \"Yes; it is simple.\"  \"Then step to the door. But, Tomba!\"  \"Si, señor.\"  \"Do not let any wild plan run through your mind that you will open the door suddenly, bolt through it and close it in my face. Do you still feel the creese? Well, I am on the alert!\"  In truth that had been Vicente Tomba's very plan. Now he gave up the idea, for Sergeant Hal's tone and manner made it very plain that treachery would prove but another name for suicide.  \"Then look out, Señor Sergente, that when I open the door there is no rush on the part of my brave ones.\"  \"Whether you or they plan the rush, it will be the end of the world for you, Tomba,\" Overton warned him steadily.  \"I will do my best, señor,\" replied Tomba in a voice well nigh as steady as the Army boy's.  Then he bent forward, pressing until he found a hidden spring. In the seemingly solid stone wall a large block of stone swung around on a pivot, disclosing a larger cellar room beyond.  \"Steady, now, Tomba!\"  Sergeant Overton flashed the lantern's rays over the Filipino's left shoulder.  Nor was it a reassuring sight that the light of the lantern revealed to the young soldier.  Instead of a dozen brown-skinned men in the next room, there were eight, if Hal's hurried count was correct. Moreover, he believed them to be the same eight who had first received and bound him.  The most disquieting fact, however, was that five of the men wore revolvers at their belts, and a pistol usually has a knife at a disadvantage.  \"Explain to them, Tomba,\" muttered the young soldier in English, \"that any move of your own, or any move of theirs to help you, will be expensive for you. Warn them, for I am watching all the rascals at once and I shall not endure an instant's treachery or disobedience of my orders.\"  Tomba spoke to them rapidly, partly in the Tagalo and partly in the Moro dialect. Sergeant Hal listened, watched, waited in keen anxiety, for life and death hung on the issue.     CHAPTER VII  THE KIND OF MAN WHO MASTERS OTHERS   Every one of the eight sullen fellows stood as though rooted in his tracks.  While Tomba spoke none answered, but many baleful glances were cast at Sergeant Hal Overton of the Thirty-fourth Infantry.  When Tomba had ceased speaking two or three of the rascals spoke, slowly, briefly.  \"What do the scoundrels say?\" demanded the Army boy.  \"They do not like the situation, señor.\"  \"Can you blame them? Or can they help the situation in the new turn that it has taken?\"  The Filipino shrugged his shoulders.  \"Well, ask the brown pirates what they intend to do?\"  Tomba spoke as though translating the question into the two tongues that these surly fellows understood.  \"They say that they do not know,\" replied Vicente Tomba presently.  \"Can't make up their minds, eh?\" jeered Hal. \"Then I'll form their decisions for them. There's a further way out of this place?\"  Vicente Tomba hesitated, muttering.  \"Now, don't you try my old trick of trying to gain time,\" warned the boyish sergeant crisply. \"I know all about that little trick and I don't intend to put up with it in the enemy. Tomba, tell your fellows to open the way out of here, and to get out as quickly as they know how. Tell them that, as soon as you stop talking, I'm going to begin to count ten in English, and that the instant I count ten I shall drive this creese deep into the back of your neck. Tell them that I know how to handle a weapon like this, and that I'll finish you with one blow.\"  As he spoke, Sergeant Hal dropped the lantern that he had been holding with his left hand. It fell with a crash, and the light went out, but he needed it no longer, for there were two other lighted lanterns in the room.  \"Go on, Tomba! Tell them just what I told you to say. Be sure you get it straight, too. Remember how much hangs in the balance for you!\"  Tomba began speaking, his voice wonderfully steady. Sergeant Hal could not help admiring the evident courage of this little Filipino, who knew well enough that his life was hanging on a thread from second to second.  Hal's left hand now rested tightly on the little brown man's shoulder. Tomba's body was no slight protection against the pistols of these surly fellows in case they evidenced a disposition to shoot. And the Army boy did not intend to let this human bulwark get away from him.  \"You have told them, Tomba?\" queried Hal Overton, as soon as the Filipino's voice ceased.  \"Even so, señor.\"  \"They understand?\"  \"If they do not, then they are idiots, Señor Sergente.\"  \"Then tell them I am going to begin to count.\"  Again Tomba spoke, this time briefly.  The grip of young Overton's hand on the Filipino's shoulder tightened. A slight shudder ran through the brown man's frame, but otherwise he showed no fear.  \"One!\" began Hal.  From the surly ones beyond an angry babel of protest went up.  But Hal coolly disregarding the clamor, merely raised his own voice enough to make it heard:  \"Two!\"  Sergeant Overton now let go of the Filipino's shoulder, but only to throw his arm around the fellow's neck. Tomba's head was drawn back, almost chokingly, against the boyish sergeant's shoulder.  \"Three!\"  Still no motion among the dark-skinned eight.  \"Four!\"  And then:  \"Five! Tomba, your friends are cheerful about your fate, aren't they? Six!\"  Vicente Tomba spoke, sharply, hissingly. Now some stir was noticeable among the wretches, though whether they meant to obey or to try to rush the lone soldier was more than Overton could guess.  \"Seven!\"  Hal's voice, as steady as ever, must have carried conviction with it. Certainly Tomba's shuddering had increased, though the little brown man, no match in muscle for the white soldier, made not the least effort to wrest himself away from that dangerous grip.  \"Eight!\" announced Hal Overton, his voice on the verge of absolute cheeriness.  Again Tomba spoke, this time still more angrily.  There was a shuffling of feet, as the men moved further away. Then one of the wretches stepped forward and threw open a door, just as Hal came calmly out with:  \"Nine!\"  \"Stop counting, señor,\" urged Vicente Tomba quite coolly. \"These men have yielded and are going. They will open the other door, pass through it hurriedly, and leave the way open for you.\"  \"Lucky for you, if they do, my Tagalo friend! I will suspend the count for an instant only.\"  Another stone door was suddenly swung open, by one of the surly fellows, revealing a passage beyond. Into this the eight fairly raced.  \"Do not follow too quickly, señor, or one of the rascals may forget himself and turn to fight,\" declared Tomba.  \"It will be bad for you if it happens!\"  \"It is of myself that I am thinking, señor!\" returned the Filipino dryly. Then, after a pause:  \"Come, señor. Surely we can pass out safely now.\"  \"Then we'll do so,\" agreed Sergeant Hal, \"and your life be upon our success! Don't try to go more quickly than I move, or I shall suspect you, and with me to suspect is to----\"  \"Say no more, señor,\" interrupted the little Filipino. \"I understand you better than I did, and I am taking no chances.\"  Sergeant Overton still retained his left-handed hold on Tomba as the pair"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23449"],["title","Behind the Beyond, and Other Contributions to Human Knowledge (#0)"],["body","http://www.eBookForge.net    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations and       links to the page images of the book from which       this e-text was taken.

Cries of \"Program!\" \"Program!\" are heard. There is a buzz of brilliant conversation, illuminated with flashes of opera glasses and the rattle of expensive jewelry.  Then suddenly, almost unexpectedly, in fact just as if done, so to speak, by machinery, the lights all over the theater, except on the stage, are extinguished. Absolute silence falls. Here and there is heard the crackle of a shirt front. But there is no other sound.  In this expectant hush, a man in a check tweed suit walks on the stage: only one man, one single man. Because if he had been accompanied by a chorus, that would have been a burlesque; if four citizens in togas had been with him, that would have been Shakespeare; if two Russian soldiers had walked after him, that would have been melodrama. But this is none of these. This is a problem play. So he steps in alone, all alone, and with that absolute finish of step, that ability to walk as if,--how can one express it?--as if he were walking, that betrays the finished actor.  He has, in fact, barely had time to lay down his silk hat, when he is completely betrayed. You can see that he is a finished actor--finished about fifteen years ago. He lays the hat, hollow side up, on the silk hat table on the stage right center--bearing north, northeast, half a point west from the red mica fire on the stage which warms the theater.  All this is done very, very quietly, very impressively. No one in the theater has ever seen a man lay a silk hat on a table before, and so there is a breathless hush. Then he takes off his gloves, one by one, _not_ two or three at a time, and lays them in his hat. The expectancy is almost painful. If he had thrown his gloves into the mica fire it would have been a relief. But he doesn't.  [Illustration: The Curtain rises.]  The man on the stage picks up a pile of letters from the letter department of the hat table. There are a great many of these letters, because all his business correspondence, as well as his private letters, are sent here by the General Post Office. Getting his letters in this way at night, he is able to read them like lightning. Some of them he merely holds upside down for a fraction of a second.  Then at last he speaks. It has become absolutely necessary or he wouldn't do it. \"So--Sao Paolo risen two--hum--Rio Tinto down again--Moreby anxious, 'better sell for half a million sterling'--hum . . .\"  (Did you hear that? Half a million sterling and he takes it just as quietly as that. And it isn't really in the play either. Sao Paolo and Rio Tinto just come in to let you know the sort of man you're dealing with.)  \"Lady Gathorne--dinner--Thursday the ninth--lunch with the Ambassador--Friday the tenth.\"  (And mind you even this is just patter. The Ambassador doesn't come into the play either. He and Lady Gathorne are just put in to let the people in the cheaper seats know the kind of thing they're up against.)  Then the man steps across the stage and presses a button. A bell rings. Even before it has finished ringing, nay, just before it begins to ring, a cardboard door swings aside and a valet enters. You can tell he is a valet because he is dressed in the usual home dress of a stage valet.  He says, \"Did you ring, Sir John?\"  There is a rustle of programs all over the house. You can hear a buzz of voices say, \"He's Sir John Trevor.\" They're all on to him.  When the valet says, \"Did you ring, Sir John,\" he ought to answer, \"No, I merely knocked the bell over to see how it would sound,\" but he misses it and doesn't say it.  \"Has her ladyship come home?\"  \"Yes, Sir John.\"  \"Has any one been here?\"  \"Mr. Harding, Sir John.\"  \"Any one else?\"  \"No, Sir John.\"  \"Very good.\"  The valet bows and goes out of the cardboard door, and everybody in the theater, or at least everybody in the seats worth over a dollar, knows that there's something strange in the relations of Lady Cicely Trevor and Mr. Harding. You notice--Mr. Harding was there and no one else was there. That's enough in a problem play.  The double door at the back of the stage, used only by the principal characters, is opened and Lady Cicely Trevor enters. She is young and very beautiful, and wears a droopy hat and long slinky clothes which she drags across the stage. She throws down her feather hat and her crêpe de what-you-call-it boa on the boa stand. Later on the valet comes in and gathers them up. He is always gathering up things like this on the stage--hats and boas and walking sticks thrown away by the actors,--but nobody notices him. They are his perquisites.  Sir John says to Lady Cicely, \"Shall I ring for tea?\"  And Lady Cicely says, \"Thanks. No,\" in a weary tone.  This shows that they are the kind of people who can have tea at any time. All through a problem play it is understood that any of the characters may ring for tea and get it. Tea in a problem play is the same as whisky in a melodrama.  Then there ensues a dialogue to this effect: Sir John asks Lady Cicely if she has been out. He might almost have guessed it from her coming in in a hat and cloak, but Sir John is an English baronet.  Lady Cicely says, \"Yes, the usual round,\" and distributes a few details about Duchesses and Princesses, for the general good of the audience.  Then Lady Cicely says to Sir John, \"You are going out?\"  \"Yes, immediately.\"  \"To the _House_, I suppose.\"  This is very impressive. It doesn't mean, as you might think, the Workhouse, or the White House, or the Station House, or the Bon Marché. It is the name given by people of Lady Cicely's class to the House of Commons.  \"Yes. I am extremely sorry. I had hoped I might ask to go with you to the opera. I fear it is impossible--an important sitting--the Ministers will bring down the papers--the Kafoonistan business. The House will probably divide in committee. Gatherson will ask a question. We must stop it at all costs. The fate of the party hangs on it.\"  Sir John has risen. His manner has changed. His look is altered. You can see him alter it. It is now that of a statesman. The technical details given above have gone to his head. He can't stop.  He goes on: \"They will force a closure on the second reading, go into committee, come out of it again, redivide, subdivide and force us to bring down the estimates.\"  While Sir John speaks, Lady Cicely's "]]]
