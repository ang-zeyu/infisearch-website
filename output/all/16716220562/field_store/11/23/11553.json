He holds forth a card; salutes, and says:  \"A gentleman inquiring for Colonel Putnam.\"  And the gentleman is but a step or two behind--an aging man with silvery hair and beard, with lines of sorrow in his refined and scholarly face, and fatigue and anxiety easily discernible in his bent figure--a gentleman evidently, and the colonel turns courteously to greet him.  \"Doctor Warren!\" he says, interrogatively, as he holds forth his hand.  \"Yes, colonel, they told me you were about going back to Frederick, and I desired to see you at once. I am greatly interested in a young officer of your regiment who is here, wounded; he is a college friend of my only son's, sir--Guthrie Warren, killed at Seven Pines.\" The colonel lifts his forage cap with one hand while the other more tightly clasps that of the older man. \"I hear that the reports were exaggerated and that he is able to be about. It is Lieutenant Abbot.\"  \"Judge for yourself, doctor,\" is the smiling reply. \"Here he sits.\"  With an eager light in his eyes the old gentleman steps forward towards Abbot, who is slowly rising from the bench. He, too, courteously raises his forage cap. In a moment both the doctor's hands have clasped the thin, white hand that leans so heavily on the stick.  \"My dear young friend!\" he says. \"My gallant boy! Thank God it is not what we feared!\" and his eyes are filling, his lip is trembling painfully.  \"You are very kind, sir,\" says Abbot, vaguely, \"I am doing quite well.\" Then he pauses. There is such yearning and--something he cannot fathom in the old man's face. He feels that he is expected to say still more--that this is not the welcome looked for. \"I beg a thousand pardons, sir, perhaps I did not catch the name aright. Did you say Doctor Warren?\"  \"Certainly, B--Guthrie Warren's father--you remember?\" and the look in the sad old eyes is one of strange perplexity. \"I cannot thank you half enough for all you have written of my boy.\"  And still there is no sign of recognition in Abbot's face. He is courteous, sympathetic, but it is all too evident that there is something grievously lacking.  \"I fear there is some mistake,\" he gently says; \"I have no recollection of knowing or writing of any one of that name.\"  \"Mistake! Good God! How can there be?\" is the gasping response. The tired old eyes are ablaze with grief, bewilderment, and dread commingled. \"Surely this is Lieutenant Paul Revere Abbot--of the--th Massachusetts.\"  \"It certainly is, doctor, but--\"  \"It surely is your photograph we have: surely you wrote to--to us all this last year--letter after letter about my boy--my Guthrie.\"  There is an instant of silence that is almost agonizing. The colonel stands like one in a state of shock. The old doctor, trembling from head to foot, looks with almost piteous entreaty; with anguish and incredulity, and half-awakened wrath, into the pale and distressed features of the young soldier.  \"I bitterly grieve to have to tell you, sir,\" is the sorrowful answer, \"but I know no such name. I have written no such letters.\"  Another instant, and the old man has dropped heavily upon the bench, and buried his face in his arms. But for the colonel he might have fallen prone to earth.     II.   An hour after sundown and the rattling old cabriolet has two occupants as it drives back to town. Colonel Putnam comes forth with the old gentleman whom he had so tenderly conducted to the farmhouse but a few moments after the strange scene out on the bank, and is now his escort to Frederick. The sergeant of the guard has been besieged with questions, for several of the men saw the doctor drop upon the bench and were aware of the melodramatic nature of the meeting. Lieutenant Abbot with a face paler than before, with a strange look of perplexity and smouldering wrath about his handsome eyes, has gone over to his own tent, where the surgeon presently visits him. The colonel and his civilian visitor are closeted together over half an hour, and the latter looks more dead than alive, say the men, as he feebly totters down the steps clinging to the colonel's arm.  \"What did you say was the name of the officer who was killed--his son?\" asks one of the guards as he stands at the entrance to the tent.  \"Warren--Guthrie Warren,\" answers the sergeant, briefly. \"I don't know whether the old man's crazy or not. He said the lieutenant had been writing to him for months about his son, and the lieutenant denied having written a line.\"  \"He lied then, by----!\" comes a savage growl from within the tent. \"Where is the old man? Give me a look at him!\" and the scowling face of Rix makes its sudden appearance at the tent-flop, peering forth into the fire-light.  \"Be quiet, Rix, and go back where you belong. You've made more than enough trouble to-day,\" is the sergeant's low-toned order.  \"I tell you I only want to see the old man,\" answers the teamster, struggling, \"Don't you threaten me with that bayonet, Drake,\" he growls savagely at the sentry, who has thrown himself in front of the opening. \"It'll be the worse for you fellows that you ever confined me, no matter by whose order; but as for that stuck-up prig, by----! you'll see soon enough what'll come of _his_ ordering me into the guard-tent.\"  His voice is so hoarse and loud with anger that the colonel's attention is attracted. He has just seated Doctor Warren in the vehicle, and is about to take his place by his side when Rix's tirade bursts upon his ear. The words are only partially distinguishable, but the colonel steps promptly back.  \"What is the matter with your prisoner, sergeant? Is he drunk or crazy, that he persists in this uproar?\"  \"I don't think it either, sir,\" answers the sergeant; while Rix, at sight of his commanding officer, pops his head back within the tent, and shuts the narrow slit. \"He's simply ugly and bent on making trouble.\"  \"Well, stop it! If he utters another insubordinate word, have him bucked and gagged at once. He is disgracing the regiment, and I won't tolerate it. Do you understand?\"  \"I do, sir.\"  The colonel turns abruptly away, while the prisoner, knowing his man, keeps discreetly out of sight, and correspondingly silent. At the gate the older officer stops once more and calls to a soldier who is standing near.  \"Give my compliments to Lieutenant Abbot, and say that I will be out here again to-morrow afternoon. Now, doctor, I am with you.\"  The old gentleman is leaning wearily back in his corner of the cab; a strange, stunned, lethargic feeling seems to have come over him. His eyes are fixed on vacancy, if anything, and the colonel's attempt at cheeriness meets no response. As the vehicle slowly rattles away he makes an effort, rouses himself as it were from a stupor-like condition, and abruptly speaks:  \"You tell me that--that you have seen Lieutenant Abbot's mail all summer and spring and never saw a--our postmark--Hastings?\"  \"I have seen his mail very often, and thought his correspondents were all home people. I am sure I would have noticed any letters coming frequently in one handwriting, and his father's is the only masculine superscription that was at all regular.\"  \"My letters--our home letters--were not often addressed by me,\" hesitates the doctor. \"The postmark might have given you an idea. I had not time--\" but he breaks off, weakly. It is so hard for him to prevaricate: and it is bitter as death to tell the truth, now. And worse--worse! What is he to tell--_how_ is he to tell her?  The colonel speaks slowly and sadly, but with earnest conviction:  \"No words can tell you how I mourn the heartlessness of this trick, doctor; but you may rest assured it is no doing of Abbot's. What earthly inducement could he have? Think of it! a man of his family and connections--and character, too. Some scoundrel has simply borrowed his name, possibly in the hope of bleeding you for money. Did none of the letters ever suggest embarrassments? It is most unfortunate that you did not bring them with you. I know the writing of every officer and many of the men in the regiment, and it would give me a clew with which to work. Promise me you will send them when you reach home.\"  The Doctor bows his head in deep dejection. \"What good will it do? I thought to find a comrade of my boy's. Indeed! it must be one who knew him well!--and how can I desire to bring to punishment one who appreciated my son as this unknown writer evidently did. His only crime seems to have been a hesitancy about giving his own name.\"  \"And a scoundrelly larceny of that of a better man in every way. No, doctor. The honor of my regiment demands that he be run down and brought to justice; and you must not withhold the only proof with which we can reach him. Promise me!\"  \"I--I will think. I am all unstrung now, my dear sir! Pray do not press me! If it was not Mr. Abbot, who could it have been? Who else could have known him?\"  \"Why, Doctor Warren, there are probably fifty Harvard men in this one regiment--or were at least,\" says the colonel, sadly, \"up to a month ago. Cedar Mountain, Bull Run, South Mountain, and Antietam have left but a moiety. Most of our officers are graduates of the old college, and many a man was there. I dare say I could have found a dozen who well knew your son. In the few words I had with Abbot, he told me he remembered that there had been some talk among the officers last July after your son was killed. Some one saw the name in the papers, and said that it must have been Warren of the class of '58, and our Captain Webster, who was killed at Manassas, was in that class and knew him well. Abbot said he remembered him, by sight, as a sophomore would know a senior, but had never spoken to him. Anybody hearing all the talk going on at the time we got the news of Seven Pines could have woven quite a college history out of it--and somebody has.\"  \"Ah, colonel! There is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22906"],["title","A War-Time Wooing: A Story (#4)"],["body","the fact of the photograph, and the letters that were written about Guthrie all last winter--long before Seven Pines.\"  The colonel looks utterly dejected, too; he shakes his head, mournfully. \"That troubles Abbot as much as it does me. Fields, gallant fellow, was our adjutant then, and he and Abbot were close friends. He could hardly have had a hand in anything beyond the photograph and letter which, you tell me, were sent to the Soldier's Aid Society in town. I remember the young fellows were having quite a lot of fun about their Havelocks when we lay at Edwards's Ferry--but Fields was shot dead, almost the first man, at Cedar Mountain, and of the thirty-five officers we had when we crossed the Potomac the first time, only eleven are with the--th to-day. Abbot, who was a junior second lieutenant then, is a captain now, by rights, and daily expecting his promotion. I showed you several letters in his hand, and they, you admit, are utterly unlike the ones you received. Indeed, doctor, it is impossible to connect Abbot with it in any way.\"  The doctor's face is covered by his hands. In ten minutes or less he must be at _her_ side. What can he tell his little girl? What shall he say? What possible, probable story can man invent to cover a case so cruel as this? He hardly hears the colonel's words. He is thinking--thinking with a bursting heart and whirling brain. For a time all sense of the loss of his only son seems deadened in face of this undreamed-of, this almost incredible shadow that has come to blight the sweet and innocent life that is so infinitely dear to him. What can he say to Bessie when he meets those beautiful, pleading, trusting, anxious eyes? She has borne up so bravely, silently, patiently. Their journey has been trying and full of fatigue, but once at Frederick he has left her in the hands of a sympathetic woman, the wife of the proprietor of the only tavern in which a room could be had, and, promising to return as soon as he could see the lieutenant, he has gone away on his quest with hopeful heart. A soldier claiming to be of the--th Massachusetts told them that very morning at the Baltimore station that Mr. Abbot was well enough to be up and about. It is barely nine o'clock now. In less than an hour there will be a train going back. All he can think of is that they must go--go as quick as possible. They have nothing now to keep them here, and he has one secret to guard from all--his little girl's. No one must know, none suspect that. In the bitterness of desolation, still stunned and bewildered by the cruelty of the blow that has come upon them, his mind is clear on that point. If possible no one, except those people at the tavern, must know she was with him. None must suspect--above all--none must suspect the bitter truth. It would crush her like a bruised and trodden flower.  \"If--if it had been a correspondence where there was a woman in the case,\" begins the colonel again--and the doctor starts as though stung, and his wrinkled hands wring each other under the heavy travelling-shawl he wears--\"I could understand the thing better. Quite a number of romantic correspondences have grown up between our soldiers and young girls at home through the medium of these mittens and things; they seem to have lost their old significance. But you give me to understand that--that there was none?\"  \"The letters were solely about my son, all that ever came to me,\" said the doctor, nervously.  \"That seems to complicate the matter. If it were a mere flirtation by letter, such as is occasionally going on, _then_ somebody might have borrowed his name and stolen his photograph; but I don't see how he could have secured the replies--the girl's letters--in such a case. No. As you say, doctor, that wasn't apt to be the solution, though I'm at a loss to account for the letters that came from you. They were addressed to Lieutenant Abbot, camp of the--th Massachusetts, you tell me, and Abbot declares he has never heard from any one of your name, or had a letter from Hastings. He would be the last man, too, to get into a correspondence with a woman--for he is engaged.\"  The doctor starts again as though stung a second time. Was there not in one of those letters a paragraph over which his sweet daughter had blushed painfully as she strove to read it aloud? Did it not speak of an entanglement that once existed; an affair in which his heart had never been enlisted, but where family considerations and parental wishes had conspired to bring about a temporary \"understanding\"? The cabriolet is bouncing about on the cobblestones of the old-fashioned street, and the doctor is thankful for the physical jar. Another moment and they draw up at the door of the old Maryland hostelry, and the colonel steps out and assists his companion to alight.  \"Let me take you to your room now, doctor; then I'll have our staff surgeon come over and see you. It has been a shock which would break a younger man--\"  But the old gentleman has nerved himself for the struggle. First and foremost--no one must follow him to his room--none suspect the trial there awaiting him. He turns sadly, but with decision.  \"Colonel, I cannot thank you now as you deserve; once home, I will write, but now what I need is absolute rest a little while. I am stunned, bewildered. I must think this out, and my best plan is to get to sleep first. Forgive me, sir, for my apparent discourtesy, and do not take it amiss if I say that for a few moments--for the present--I should like to be alone. We--we will meet again, sir, if it rest with me, and I will write. Good-night, colonel. Good-night, sir.\"  And he turns hurriedly away. For a moment the soldier stands uncertain what to do. Then he enters the hallway determined to bespeak the best offices of the host in behalf of his stricken friend. There is a broad stairway some distance back in the hall, and up this he sees the doctor slowly laboring. He longs to go to his assistance, but stands irresolute, fearing to offend. The old gentleman nears the top, and is almost on the landing above, when a door is suddenly opened, a light, quick step is heard, and in an instant a tall, graceful girl, clad in deep black--a girl whom the colonel sees is young, beautiful, and very pale--springs forward into view, places her hands on the old man's shoulders, and looks eagerly, imploringly, into his face. What she asks, what she says, the colonel cannot hear; but another moment solves all doubt as to his proper course. He sees her clasped to the doctor's breast; he sees them clinging to each other one instant, and then the father, with sudden rally, bears her pale and probably fainting from his sight. A door shuts with muffled slam, and they are gone; and with the intuition of a gentleman Colonel Putnam realizes why his proffer of services would now be out of place.  \"And so there is a woman in the case, after all,\" he thinks to himself as he steps forth into the cool evening air. \"And it is for her sake the good old man shrinks from dragging the matter into the light of day--his daughter, probably; and some scoundrel has been at work, and in my regiment.\"  The colonel grinds his teeth and clinches his fists at this reflection. He is a husband and father himself, and now he understands some features in the old doctor's trouble which had puzzled him before. He strolls across the street to the sidewalk under the quaint old red-brick, dormer-windowed houses where lights are still gleaming, and where groups of people are chatting and laughing in the pleasant air. Many of them are in the rough uniform of the army--teamsters, drivers, and slightly wounded soldiers out on pass from the neighboring field hospitals. The old cabriolet is being trundled off to some neighboring stable after a brief confabulation between the driver thereof and the landlord of the tavern, and the colonel is about hailing and tendering the Jehu another job for the morrow, when he sees that somebody else is before him; and, bending down from his seat, the driver is talking with a man who has come out from the shadow of a side porch. There is but little light in the street, and the colonel has turned on reaching the curb, and is seeking among the windows across the way for one which may possibly prove to be the young lady's. He is interested in the case more than ever now, but the windows give no sign. Some are lighted, and occasional shadows flit across them, but none that are familiar. Suddenly he hears a sound that brings him back to himself--the tramp of marching feet, and the sudden clash of arms as they halt; a patrol from the provost-marshal's guard comes quickly around a corner from the soft dust of a side street, and the non-commissioned officers are sharply halting all neighboring men in uniform, and examining their passes. Several parties in army overcoats shuffle uneasily up the street, only to fall into the clutches of a companion patrol that pops up as suddenly around the next corner beyond. \"Rounding up the stragglers,\" thinks the colonel, with a quiet smile of approval, and, like the soldier he is, he finds time to look on a moment and watch the manner in which the work is done. The patrol seems to have possessed itself of both sides of the street at the same instant, and \"spotted\" every man in blue. These are bidden to stand until their papers are examined by the brace of young officers who appear upon the scene, belted and sashed, and bearing small lanterns. Nor are uniforms alone subject to scrutiny. Ever since Second Bull-Run there has been much straggling in the army, and not a little desertion; and though a fortnight has passed since Antietam was fought, the provost-marshal's men have not yet finished scouring the country, and a sharp lookout is kept for deserters. Those civilians who can readily establish their identity as old residents of the town have no trouble. Occasionally a man is encountered whom nobody seems to know, and, despite their"]]]
