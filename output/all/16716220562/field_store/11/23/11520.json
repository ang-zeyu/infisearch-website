You have been paid, but I will pay you doubly if you stick by me to the end. You know every mile of these mountains and forests. You can help me get away, and by it you shall lose nothing.\"  The Indian shook his head.  \"Much bad! much bad!\" he declared. \"What you do with gal?\"  \"I shall keep her.\"  \"How you do it. Mebbe she no want to stay. She have many friend. They hunt you same like a real wolf.\"  \"Then they shall find that the wolf has teeth. I expect her gringo lover will hunt. Ha! ha! ha! It is the joy of my soul to wring his heart and make it bleed! I hate him! Between him and me it is a struggle to the death, and in my body runs the blood of old Guerrero, who feared no peril and never paused to count the cost when he struck at a foe. Could I leave him dead, even as he thought me dead, my path would be clear. The prize is worth the peril, for it is a double prize, the fairest señorita and a great fortune. Listen, Ben: if by me you stay fast and I slay my enemy, five hundred dollars shall be yours. Think of that. Five hundred is as much as you can obtain as guide in a season.\"  \"But the white man's law,\" said the Indian. \"I know him. Once I steal a hoss. White man officer arrest me, take me to court, where white man judge say go to jail one year. I go. No want some more like that. Once I 'most kill man down at Long Lake. White man officer hunt me long time. I remember jail. No want some more. I hide. Send word no let um officer take me alive. Bimeby they no hunt me some more. 'Nother time I git drunk, burn house. Have to hide again long, long while till snow come, an' nobody look for me some more. If I help you do some bad things now, mebbe git officer after me 'gain.\"  \"You will not be to blame for anything I do, and the money will pay you so you can afford to hide until the trouble is past. My friends will join us here, as we planned. After that we can get away into the woods. With you to guide, we can baffle all pursuit. But I pray the señorita's gringo lover seeks to follow, so that we may meet. I'll leave him for the wild beasts, with my knife in his heart!\"  \"But gal she hate you then.\"  \"I'll teach her to love me. I have sworn she shall be mine, and the oath of a Del Norte is never broken. Leave everything to me. Go back and watch for our friends. They will come as soon as they can get away and reach us without being seen.\"  Silently the redskin turned away and disappeared into the path.  Then the wolf once more turned to the girl. He was somewhat startled to discover her eyes were wide open and fastened upon him. Quickly he bent over her, speaking softly and with an effort to reassure her.  \"Fear not, señorita; you are not injured, and in my hands you are safe, for I will guard you with my life. A thousand pardons I ask if I have caused your heart to beat with alarm.\"  With an effort she rose on one hand, holding up the other as if to ward him off.  \"Don't touch me, you monster!\" she gasped. \"I shall scream!\"  \"Spare yourself the effort, fair one,\" he said, \"for though you were to shriek with all your strength no one could hear you. You were unconscious, and while thus I brought you here.\"'  \"Where am I?\"  \"Many miles from the spot where I found you, señorita.\"  \"That voice!\" she whispered, shrinking in terror. \"It cannot be that you are---- I am dreaming!\"  \"It is no dream, sweet one. Could you see into my heart you would fear me no longer. Trust me and all will be well.\"  \"Trust you! Trust a monster who has done what you have done! I fear you as I would fear a venomous reptile!\"  \"Ah! how little you understand, señorita!\"  He knelt on one knee before her, holding out his open hands.  \"If you would only believe in me and trust me, my beautiful gringo flower! You will learn in time to do so, for I shall teach you. Some day you shall bless your guardian angel that to-night I found you and snatched you from your boastful lover.\"  To his surprise, she leaned toward him, as if to permit him to clasp her in his arms. A moment later, with a swift movement, she caught at the wolf mask and tore it from his head.  \"Porfias del Norte!\" she cried, falling back and staring at him as he knelt with the moonlight shining on his face and his bandaged head.  He smiled in that remarkable manner that ever made his face seem handsome to a wonderful degree.  \"Yes, señorita,\" he murmured, with that strange sweetness in his voice, \"I am Porfias del Norte.\"  \"Not dead!\"  \"Far from it, fair one.\"  \"But Frank said----\"  \"He thought he had left me dead in the old hut where I was shot down by a treacherous dog who shall pay the penalty with his life. The bullet struck me here, but Heaven changed its course and spared my life. My time had not come, Señorita Inza.\"  \"Heaven had no hand in it!\" cried the girl. \"Some evil spirit protected you!\"  \"Some time you will think differently.\"  \"Never! You monster, how dared you do what you have done to-night?\"  \"Dare!\" he laughed. \"Have you yet to learn that a Del Norte dares anything? Have you yet to learn a Del Norte will risk anything to secure the woman he loves?\"  She fought against the great terror that threatened to overcome her and rob her of consciousness once more.  \"You must be deranged!\" she said. \"You cannot realize what your act will bring about. It is plain you do not yet know Frank Merriwell. If you did you would not fancy you could do this thing and escape the punishment he will surely bring upon you. Why, he will find you and make you suffer, even though he had to employ a hundred men and rake over every inch of these mountains. Once arouse him, as he must now be aroused, and he will follow like a Nemesis on your trail. There is but one escape for you.\"  \"Only one?\" questioned the man, with a touch of mockery in his voice.  \"Only one.\"  \"And that is--tell me what, señorita?\"  \"You must permit me to return to him without delay. You must see that I return unharmed. If you do that, I give you my promise to keep him still long enough for you to get far away. If you are wise you will make all haste back to your own country.\"  Del Norte laughed softly.  \"You have yet much to learn of me. In this game I hold the winning cards. In my employ is an Indian who knows where in these mountains we may hide so securely that a thousand men cannot find us. In one of these hiding places I shall keep you secure. If your gringo lover comes, I'll meet him. I'll fight him to the death. One of us will conquer, and no man ever triumphed over one in whose blood was the spirit of old Guerrero. If we meet in fair battle and I am his master, then you will realize how much superior I am to the boasting Americano you thought you cared for. In time you will learn to love me a thousand times more deeply than you ever loved him.\"  \"It's plain you reckon all women on the standard of such women as you have known. Only women of savage races transfer their affection from dead lovers to their slayers. But you do not yet comprehend the fearful task before you. Your conceit is colossal. In single combat with Frank Merriwell you would not have one chance in a thousand.\"  He could not help feeling the scorn and contempt in her face and words, but still he laughed.  \"Time will show you your mistake, señorita; words cannot. Do not fear me. I have sworn that you shall love me, and to win your love I'll be as tender and considerate as possible.\"  \"Tender and considerate!\" panted the trembling girl. \"After this night I shall fear and loathe you a thousand times more than ever before. Keep away! Don't touch me!\"  \"It saddens me to see that you fear me so,\" he sighed, rising to his feet and standing with folded arms. \"I have ventured everything on this move, and I shall carry it through. You American women love wealth and power. Señorita, all the vast wealth that is coming to me will I place at your feet. Yours shall be all the power it can command. As my wife you shall some day be admired and envied by all women.\"  \"Now I know you are deranged!\" she declared, also rising. \"Any man in his right mind could not think to win the love of a woman after such a fashion. Porfias del Norte, that wound has made you a madman!\"  \"It is love that has made me mad, my Northern flower. Since parting from you on the crown of Mount Battie, up in Maine, I have thought of you, and dreamed of you, until you took possession of my whole being. I felt that I must have you for my own to keep always until death came between us. I have felt that to have you thus I would face a thousand deadly perils. To-night I saw you at the dance. Even though your face was hidden, my heart gave a leap the moment my eyes rested on you. By your grace I recognized you, yet I was not certain until I found an opportunity to speak with you. I watched my opening and grasped it the moment Merriwell left you. Even though I felt that you might discover my identity and betray me, I ventured to speak with you.\"  \"I believed you dead; otherwise I should have recognized you, even though you disguised your voice.\"  \"No doubt, señorita. I feared then that you might tell him, and he would make a move that should baffle me. I spoke to my comrades. Fortune aided me in the wild plan I quickly formed. He saw them and engaged in altercation with them, which gave me the opening I sought. You were again left alone, and in a moment I acted. I carried you away, but in the struggle your garment of white was torn from you, and it lies in the canoe that brought us to this spot. I have no doubt that my comrades will join me soon, and then we shall move again. By daybreak we will be safely hidden in one of the many safe places known to the Indian who is with me.\"  Inza was desperate. She did not know they were on an island, and now her terror led her, having somewhat recovered her strength, to wheel suddenly and flee as fast as her feet would carry her. By chance she struck into the path and came quickly to the shore"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22874"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Pursuit; Or, How to Win (#6)"],["body","lay the canoe, with Red Ben standing near it.  \"Help!\" she cried, appealing to him. \"Save me! You shall be paid--anything, anything you ask!\"  In her excitement she clutched his arm. He turned toward her a grim, immovable face. Not a word did he speak in reply.  Del Norte issued from the path and deliberately approached.  \"It is useless, señorita,\" he declared. \"Flee whither you will, there is no escape. You are on an island. This is my Indian comrade.\"  \"Others come,\" said Red Ben.  \"Where?\" asked the Mexican anxiously.  \"There.\"  The redskin lifted his arm and pointed away over the surface of the silent lake.  \"My friends!\" gasped the girl. \"They are coming to rescue me.\"  In the distance a black spot lay on the water. The faint clanking of oars was heard.  Del Norte whistled a sharp signal.  In return there was a similar answer.  \"Señorita,\" he laughed, \"you are wrong; those who come are my friends.\"     CHAPTER VII.  THE SENTINEL.   With the sun slipping down toward the western peaks, another day was passing.  Hidden on the side of a wooded mountain, yet having a position that commanded a wide expanse of country, with a view of the lower hills and valleys, Red Ben lay prone on his stomach. At his side lay a loaded rifle.  In front of the Indian was a precipice, over which he peered at intervals, his keen eyes searching the valley below.  Finally he stirred quickly, sat up and turned with the rifle in his hands.  A man was approaching, but the moment this man appeared plainly in view Red Ben put down the rifle.  Del Norte came hurriedly forward.  \"Have you seen anything of pursuers?\" he anxiously questioned.  The redskin nodded.  \"They near,\" he answered.  \"You have seen them?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Down there,\" with a motion of one brown hand toward the valley beneath them.  \"When?\"  \"Hour ago.\"  \"How many?\"  \"Five.\"  \"Whither did they go?\"  \"So,\" with another gesture up the valley.  \"Then they are not on the trail. Your trick in covering our tracks in case they found and followed the trail was successful. Are you sure they were pursuers? Perhaps they were hunters looking for deer.\"  \"No,\" asserted the Indian decidedly. \"Ben he know. Make no mistake. They hunt for lost gal.\"  \"They'll never find her. In that cave she is as safe as if buried a thousand feet underground. Even if they passed within ten feet of the entrance they could not discover it. Was Merriwell with them?\"  Ben shook his head.  \"No can tell. Ben not know him. Two young men; others older.\"  From a pocket the Mexican drew a pistol, which he examined, making sure it was in perfect working order. His usually handsome face wore a look that transformed it, while there was a deadly glitter in his black eyes.  \"Listen, Ben,\" he said; \"I will describe the hated gringo to you. If he is near, I wish to find the opportunity to meet him again face to face. Twice he has nearly destroyed me, but my escapes have told me my life is charmed, and I know it is next his turn. When again we meet I'll leave him food for the wolves, with this in his heart!\"  He suddenly produced and flourished a keen dagger. His description of Frank was accurate and flattering, for he confessed that the young American was handsome and manly in appearance, with a resolute face and a fearless eye. He declared that the redskin could not mistake Merriwell, as the very appearance of the latter proclaimed him a leader among his companions.  \"Of course,\" he added, \"I wish no chance to face him in company with many of his friends, but I pray the Virgin he may give me the opportunity alone.\"  \"Not much chance,\" grunted Red Ben. \"How gal?\"  \"She is wonderful in her courage and defiance. Never did I see her equal, and it is this spirit that makes me love her all the more. How long do you think we'll have to hide here in the cave, Ben?\"  \"Can't stay long. Little grub.\"  \"If necessary you could bring food at night.\"  \"Mebbe so. Much dangerous to stay long. First chance we best go quick. Your friend they watch her?\"  \"Yes, they are guarding her now.\"  \"She run quick she git chance.\"  \"She'll have no chance.\"  The redskin surveyed Del Norte curiously.  \"You want marry gal?\" he asked.  \"I have sworn to make her my wife.\"  \"No good! She no do it. You waste time. You fix um your enemy, better leave her, git out fast. Canada up there. You reach Canada, have chance to git 'way.\"  \"Even with the gringo dead, my triumph would not be complete if she escaped me. I will take her to Mexico.\"  \"Where Mexico?\" asked the Indian. \"No hear of it any before.\"  \"It is far from here, my own fair land!\"  \"Gal make heap trouble 'fore you git um there. Ben him know. Him see in her eye how she hate you. Gals no good. Alwus make bad trouble for anybody. Men big fools over gals. Ben know. Once him git foolish over 'nother man's squaw. Heap fight over her. Prit' near git um head shot off. Let squaws 'lone sence that.\"  \"You cannot understand,\" declared Del Norte, with a gesture. \"This thing I have set myself to do I will do, and all the powers of earth shall not thwart me.\"  Ben grunted and shrugged his shoulders.  \"When white man gits that way him go it lickety split till him finish up done for. All right. Ben he got nothin' to say. No waste talk. You pay him, he do all he can for you.\"  \"That's all I ask and all I want. Keep your eyes open. If the hunters come near, give me warning. If Merriwell strays alone, let me know and I will hasten to meet him.\"  A few moments later the redskin was again left as a sentinel on the mountain side, while Del Norte retraced his steps to the cave where he had sought concealment with his fair captive.         *       *       *       *       *  The sun was touching the tip of a rocky western peak. For a long time Red Ben had been watching a solitary man who was making his way slowly and cautiously up the mountain. The eyes of the Indian glittered and his fingers closed firmly on his rifle, which was ready for use.  Nearer and nearer came the unsuspecting man. At times he disappeared from view amid the timber, only to reappear at some point anticipated by the watcher.  Finally he drew near the spot where the Indian lay. Slowly Red Ben pushed forward his rifle, bringing the butt against his shoulder. The muzzle covered the heart of the unsuspecting man, who also carried a rifle.  At that moment the man dropped like a flash and rolled over twice until he lay behind a sheltering bowlder.  Red Ben was astonished, for he realized that the other had scented danger, yet how this had happened was more than the redskin could comprehend.  \"Howld on there, ye spalpane!\" cried a voice. \"Don't be afther shootin' yer bist friend. Oi know ye're there, fer Oi saw th' bushes wiggle a wee bit. If it's Red Ben ye are, ye ought to know Pat O'Toole, so ye had.\"  The astonishment of the Indian increased, but for some moments he neither spoke nor made a sound.  \"Nivver a bit av good will it do to kape so shtill,\" declared he of the rich Irish brogue. \"Oi know ye're there. It's not often Pat O'Toole makes a mishtake.\"  The Indian sat up, exposing the upper part of his body.  \"Come,\" he invited. \"Ben no shoot.\"  O'Toole rose from his place of concealment, grinning triumphantly.  \"Begorra, Oi think Oi saved mesilf a foine hole in me shkin,\" he chuckled, as he advanced. \"Whin Misther Browning towld me about th' Injun in th' boat wid the wolf, sez Oi to mesilf, sez Oi, 'Oi'll bet me loife Oi know th' mon, an' it's Red Ben.' Misther Merriwell wur sure th' spalpane he's afther must be somewhere here, an' it's the counthry all over they are searchin'. Oi took it on mesilf to invistigate this soide av th' mountain, but Oi had me oies open all th' toime. Something towld me ye'd be on th' watch if ye wur with them; an' it's sudint Oi dhropped whin Oi saw th' bushes move.\"  \"How,\" said Red Ben, accepting O'Toole's extended hand.  \"Howdy yersilf. Long toime no see, eh?\"  \"What you do here?\"  \"Pwhat th' divvil are you doin', Ben? It's a bad shcrape ye're afther gettin' yersilf in through this girrul business. Arter Oi saved ye from bein' shot full av lead fer foolin' round Bill Curran's woife Oi thought ye'd know betther than to iver monkey wid a female again.\"  \"Ben he no monkey. White man him gal crazy.\"  \"But ye're afther hilpin' him, ye lunatick, an' it's a schrape ye'll foind yersilf in. Oi've known ye tin year now. We've worruked togither guidin' more than wance, and nivver a bit av a quarrel did we have. Oi'd not tell ye a loie, an' Oi want ye to know thot Frank Merriwell will rake these mountains down an' lay them level av he don't foind thot girrul. It's a big oath he has taken to make anny wan shmart thot has caused her wan minute av distress.\"  \"How you know so much 'bout him?\" asked Red Ben, a heavy frown on his face.  \"It's a long shtory, an' Oi'll not tell ye the whole av it. Oi wur paid to hilp do him a bad turn, an' Oi troied to bate th' head off him. It's a foine lickin' Oi got. Afther thot he saved me loife whin a mad buck had me down an' wur about cuttin' me to pieces wid his hoofs. Sure Oi found him a foine young gintleman, an' it's his friend Oi became. Wid me own hand Oi put a bullet through the head av thot shnale Porrfeeus dil Noort; an' now it's some av Dil Noort's gang that's seekin' to git square by carryin' off Merriwell's girrul.

Av ye refuse it's more than wan year ye'll be afther spindin' in jail fer your foolishness.\"  The Indian had listened with the frown growing deeper.  \"Mebbe you go back on me?\" he questioned. \"Mebbe you tell um Merriwell Red Ben help carry off gal?\"  \"Oi didn't have to tell him. His bist friend saw ye in your canoe afther ye shtarted wid th' girrul.
