It is estimated above at 20,000 square miles, and has been described in enthusiastic terms, by the Bishop of Oregon--De Smet--in his \"Oregon Missions.\"  The territory of the Kootonais Indians would seem, from his glowing description, to be divided in favourable proportion between forests and prairies.  Of timber, he names birch, pine of different species, cedar, and cypress. He remarked specimens of coal, and \"great quantities of lead,\" apparently mixed with silver.  The source of the Columbia seemed to impress him as \"a very important point.\"  He observes that \"the climate is delightful\"--that the extremes of heat and cold are seldom known, the snow disappearing as it falls.  He reiterates the opinion \"that the advantages nature seemed to have bestowed on the Columbia, will render its geographical position very important at some future day, and that the hand of civilised man would transform it into a terrestrial paradise.\"  It is an interesting coincidence that Bishop De Smet published in a Saint Louis paper, a few months since, a similar description of this region, adding that it could be reached from Salt Lake City along the western base of the Rocky Mountains with waggons, and that Brigham Young proposed to lead his next Mormon exodus to the sources of the Columbia River.  Such a movement is not improbable, and would exhibit far greater sagacity than an emigration to Sonora.  THE ATHABASCA DISTRICT.  The valleys of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers, which occupy the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains from latitudes 55 degrees to 59 degrees share the Pacific climate in a remarkable degree.  The Rocky Mountains are greatly reduced in breadth and mean elevation, and through the numerous passes between their lofty peaks the winds of the Pacific reach the district in question.  Hence it is that Sir Alexander Mackenzie, under date of 10th May, mentions the \"exuberant verdure of the whole country\"--trees about to blossom, and buffalo attended by their young. During the late parliamentary investigation, similar statements were elicited.  Dr Richard King, who accompanied an expedition in search of Sir John Ross, as \"surgeon and naturalist,\" was asked what portion of the country he saw was available for the purpose of settlement.  In reply, he described as a \"very fertile valley,\" a \"square piece of country,\" bounded on the south by Cumberland House, and by the Athabasca Lake on the north.  His own words are as follows:--\"The sources of the Athabasca and the sources of the Saskatchewan include an enormous area of country; it is, in fact, a vast piece of land surrounded by water. When I heard Dr Livingstone's description of that splendid country which he found in the interior of Africa within the equator, it appeared to me to be precisely the kind of country which I am now describing. ... It is a rich soil interspersed with well-wooded country, there being growth of every kind and the whole vegetable kingdom alive.\"  When asked concerning mineral productions, his reply was,--\"I do not know of any other mineral except limestone; this is apparent in all directions. ... The birch, the beech, and the maple are in abundance, and there is every sort of fruit.\"  When questioned further as to the growth of trees, Dr King replied by a comparison \"with the magnificent trees round Kensington Park in London.\"  He described a farm near Cumberland House under very successful cultivation--\"luxuriant wheat\"--potatoes, barley, pigs, cows and horses.  SASKATCHEWAN, ASSINEBOIN, AND RED RIVER DISTRICT.  The area of this continent, north-west of Minnesota, and known as the Saskatchewan district, is estimated by English authorities to comprise 368,000 square miles.  North-west from Otter Tail Lake, the geographical centre of Minnesota, extends a vast silurian formation, bounded on the west along the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains by coal measures. Such a predominance of limestone implies fertility of soil, as in the north-western States, and the speedy colonisation of Saskatchewan would be assured if the current objection to the severity of climate was removed.  On this point a few facts will be presented.  The Sea of Azof, which empties into the Black Sea, forming the eastern border of the Crimean peninsula, freezes about the beginning of November, and is seldom open before the beginning of April.  A point less than one hundred miles north, but far down in southern Russia, namely, Catherineoslay, has been found, from the observation of many years, to be identical in summer and winter climate with Fort Spelling. Nine-tenths of European Russia, therefore, the main seat of population and resources, is further north than Saint Paul.  In fact, Pembina is the climatic equivalent of Moscow, and for that of Saint Petersburg, (which is 60 degrees north), we may reasonably go to latitude 55 degrees on the American continent.  Like European Russia, also, the Saskatchewan district has a climate of extremes--the thermometer having a wide range; but it is well understood that the growth of the cereals and of the most useful vegetables depends chiefly on the intensity and duration of the summer heats, and is comparatively little influenced by the severity of winter cold, or the lowness of the mean temperature during the year.  Therefore it is important to observe that the northern shore of Lake Huron has the mean summer heat of Bordeaux, in southern France, or 70 degrees Fahrenheit; while Cumberland House, in latitude 54 degrees, longitude 102 degrees, on the Saskatchewan, exceeds in this respect Brussels and Paris.  The United States Army Meteorological Register has ascertained that the line of 70 degrees mean summer heat crosses the Hudson River at West Point, thence descends to the latitude of Pittsburg, but, westward, is traced through Sandusky, Chicago, Fort Snelling, and Fort Union, near latitude 49 degrees, into British America.  The average annual heat at Quebec is experienced as far north as latitude 52 degrees in the Saskatchewan country.  Mr Blodget states that not only all the vicinity of the south branch of the Saskatchewan is as mild in climate as Saint Paul, but that the north branch of that river is almost equally favourable, and that the ameliorating influence of the Pacific, through the gorges of the Rocky Mountains, is so far felt on Mackenzie's River, that wheat may be grown in its valley nearly to the 65th parallel.  In the foregoing account of the districts of the _interior_, we have given faithfully, as in duty bound, the _fact_ that have been elicited in the various investigations, public and otherwise, that have taken place.  At the same time, we think it but fair to state, that large portions of these fine districts, especially the Athabasca and Saskatchewan, are at present very far beyond the reach of any civilised market, and overrun by hordes of warlike Indians.  We have thus given a brief survey of the position and resources, of the territory surrounding the new El Dorado.  One observation we may be permitted to hazard.  Perhaps there is no more striking illustration of the wisdom of that Providence which presides over the management of our affairs, than in the fact that emigration was first led to the eastern coast, rather than to the slopes or plains of the west.  Had the latter been first occupied, it is doubtful whether the rocks and lagoons of the seaboard would ever have been settled.  No man would have turned from the prairie sward of the Pacific to the seamed elopes of the Atlantic edge.  As it is, we have the energy and patience which the difficult soil of the east generates, with that magnificent sweep of western territory, which, had it been opened to us first, might, from its very luxuriousness, have generated among those occupying it, an ignoble love of ease.    CHAPTER THREE.  ROUTES, ETCETERA.  For some time to come, the great line of route to the new El Dorado will likely be by water from the different settlements along the coast of the Pacific.  Steam communication has long been established between Panama and San Francisco, and a line of vessels is now regularly plying between the latter port and Vancouver's Island, from whence easy access is had to the diggings, by means of small steamers.  The steamers at present running on the coast make the voyage from Panama to Vancouver's Island in fourteen or fifteen days.  The following statistics of fares and freights are supplied by the _Times'_ correspondent:--  \"The rates of passage at present from San Francisco to New York are-- Steerage, 150 dollars; second cabin, 250 dollars; first cabin, 300 dollars per berth for each passenger.  An entire state-room is the price of two passengers--600 dollars.  From New York to San Francisco the fares are the same.  San Francisco to Panama, sometimes the same as to New York, and sometimes one-third less.  Freight on specie, 1 per cent, to New York;  and three quarters per cent to Panama with a slight discount to shippers of large amounts.  Freight on merchandise from Panama, 2 dollars 10 cents per foot.  The quantity of freight is considerable in French silks, cloths, and light goods, but the bulk is in Havannah cigars, nearly all the supply for this market coming _via_ Panama.  The fares up by the steamers from San Francisco to Victoria are--Steerage, 30 dollars; cabin, 60 dollars.\"  This route, besides being at present the most direct and expeditious, presents another great advantage.  Passing along the coast of California, it gives passengers an opportunity of either settling there, or continuing their journey to British Columbia.  That this is no unimportant advantage, will be at once conceded when it is borne in mind that it is not the gold-producing country on the Fraser River alone that offers strong inducements to emigrants.  In a letter published on 4th August, the _Times'_ correspondent remarks:--\"In a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23389"],["title","Handbook to the new Gold-fields (#7)"],["body","weeks, with a continuance of the present drain upon our mining, mechanical, and labouring population generally, as good a field for labour of every kind will again be open in California as there was from 1849 to 1851, when the country became flooded with immigrants. In fact, the openings now being made in the mines and in labour of all sorts, and the rise of wages in consequence of the exodus hence, offer greater inducements to emigrants than existed in the first years of our organisation.  Then there was little besides mining that a man could turn his hand to.  Now the gradual development of the resources of the country has opened many avenues for labour of various kinds, and mining claims, which pay well, and in which a competency would be realised in a moderate space of time, are abandoned because they do not produce gold in bushels, as their owners hope to find the new mines to yield.\"  And in another letter, the same authority says:--\"The excitement in the interior is universal.  I was up the country this week, and returned only last night; so that I had an opportunity of judging for myself. From every point of the compass squads of miners were to be seen making for San Francisco to ship themselves off; and I heard of arrangements having been completed for driving stock overland to meet the demands of the new population congregating in the Puget Sound country.  One man had purchased a drove of mules, and another had speculated in 200 Californian horses, to supply the demand for `packing.'  These two `ventures' were to proceed overland in two days hence.  The speculator in horses had been at Fraser River, and returned convinced of the judiciousness of his `spec.'  He spoke of the overland trip with enthusiasm; plenty of game and of grass, a fine climate, and no molestation from Indians.  As a natural result of all this emigration, business in the interior is becoming much deranged.  The operations of the country merchants are checked; rents and the value of property in the interior towns are diminishing.  Some of the merchants are `liquidating,' and some have already moved their business to San Francisco, to take advantage of the business which must spring up between that port and the north-west.  All the movements made in consequence of the new gold discovery have tended to benefit San Francisco, and she will, no doubt, continue to derive great advantages from the change.  The increase of business will bring an increase of immigration to the city, for there is every reason to believe, judging from past experience, that a considerable proportion of the emigration from Europe, the Atlantic States, and Australia, will rest here; that the city will increase rapidly, and that an advance in the value of property must ensue in consequence.  The fact is, that there is now in California so extensive an association of capital and labour engaged in mining successfully, that, happen what may in other countries, the `yield' here most continue to be very great.  Companies of men who have large amounts of money invested in mining of a variety of sorts, such as `tunnelling,' `sluicing,' and `quartz crushing,' on a large scale, are not going to abandon well-developed properties which produce profitable returns.  We have no fear of having to suffer any inconvenience from a scarcity of gold in California in consequence of the removal from the country of so many miners.  I make these statements for the information of parties abroad engaged in business with this country.\"  The following is the journal of a traveller who lately proceeded on this route:--  \"Left San Francisco on Thursday, the 24th of June, at 4 and a half p.m., and arrived in Esquimault Harbour, near Victoria, on the following Tuesday, at six in the morning--distance, 800 miles.  The steamer was so crowded with gold-hunters, speculators, merchants, tradesmen, and adventurers of all sorts, that exercise even on the quarterdeck could only be coaxed by the general forbearance and good-humour of the crowd. Before starting there were stories to the prejudice of the steamer, the Oregon, belonging to the Pacific Mail Company, rife enough to damp the courage of the timid; but she behaved well, and beat another boat that had five hours' start of her.  The fact is we had a model captain, a well-educated, gentlemanly man, formerly a lieutenant in the United States navy, whose intelligence, vigour, and conduct inspired full confidence in all.  With Captain Patterson I would have gone to sea in a tub.  Whatever may be the sins of the company as monopolists of the carrying trade on this coast, justice must award them the merit of having selected a staff of commanders who atone for many shortcomings.  \"The voyage from San Francisco to Vancouver's Island, which in a steamer is made all the way within sight of the coast, is one of the most agreeable when the voyager is favoured with fine weather.  I know none other so picturesque out of the Mediterranean.  The navigation is so simple that a schoolboy could sail a steamer, for a series of eighteen headlands, which jut out into the ocean all along the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington Territory, served as landmarks to direct the mariner in his course.  All he has to do is to steer from one to another; from Point Reyes outside the Golden Gate to Point Arena, the next in succession, and so on till he comes to Cape Flattery, upon rounding which he enters the Straits of Fuca, towards the end of his voyage.  \"The northern portion of the coast of California and the whole length of the coasts of Oregon and Washington are thickly wooded.  In fact, this vast stretch of country is one continuous pine forest.  From the shore, where the trees dip into the sea, back to the verge of the distant horizon, over hills, down valleys, across ravines, and on and around the sides and tops of mountains, it is one great waving panorama of forest scenery.  Timber--enough to supply the wants of the world for ages, one would think.  Yet the broken character of the country relieves the scene from monotony, and it fully realises the idea of the grand and the beautiful combined.  One spot in particular made an impression upon me which I wish I had the power to convey by words.  Between Cape Mendocina and Humboldt Bay, on the northern limits of California, a grand collection of hills and mountains of every variety of size, shape, and form occurs.  This grand group recedes in a gentle sweep from the coast far inland, where it terminates in a high conical mountain, overtopping the entire mass of pinnacles which cluster around it.  The whole is well clothed with trees of that feathery and graceful foliage peculiar to the spruce and larch, and interspersed with huge round clumps of evergreens, with alternations of long glades and great open patches of lawn covered with rich grass of that bright emerald green peculiar to California. This woodland scene, viewed of an early morning, sparkling with dew-drops under the rising sun which slowly lifted the veil of mist hanging over it, surpassed in beauty anything I have seen on this continent.  Here everything in nature is on a grand scale.  All her works are magnificent to a degree unknown in Europe.  A trip to these regions will pay the migratory Englishman in search of novelty to his heart's content, and I will bear the blame if he is not well pleased with his journey.  California alone should satisfy a traveller of moderate desires.  Here he will find combined the beauty and loveliness of English landscape with the bolder and grander features of the scenery of the Western continent--a combination, perhaps, unequalled in any other country.  On this, the northern coast, the bold and the picturesque predominate over the tamer park-like scenery of the interior valleys, which so nearly resemble the `fine old places' of England.\"  Another route, which it is proposed to open on the other side of the country, from Minnesota to the Fraser River gold mines, would appear to be very feasible.  From Saint Anthony the Mississippi is navigable for large steamers as far as the Sauk Rapids.  Thence to Breckenridge, at the head of the navigation of the Red River of the North, is a distance of 125 miles.  This part of the journey must be made overland; but already this district is being fast occupied by settlers, and a good road may easily be constructed.  At Breckenridge a settlement has also been established.  Here commences the fertile valley of the Red River, and from this point, as appears from Captain Pope's survey, the river, which runs due north, is navigable for steamers all the way to its mouth, at the southern extremity of Lake Winnepeg.  It begins with four feet of water, and gradually deepens to fifteen feet Lake Winnepeg, which is long, narrow, and deep, receives near its northern end the Saskatchewan, flowing from the west, and having its sources in the Rocky Mountains.  The river, and the country on its banks, have recently attracted attention as well fitted for colonisation.  Taking the climate of the eastern portion of the continent, and of the region round Hudson's Bay, as a standard, it was long supposed that all the interior of North America, beyond the 48th or 49th degree of north latitude, was too cold to produce grain crops; and unfit, therefore, for the habitation of civilised men.  Recent investigations, however, have fully established the curious and very important fact, that west of the western end of Lake Superior, at about the 100th degree of west longitude, a remarkable change begins to take place in the climate; to such an extent, that as we proceed westward the limit of vegetable growth, and of the production of grain, is extended far to the north, so as to include the whole valley of the Saskatchewan, which is represented as in other respects well fitted for settlement.  The Saskatchewan is a river larger and longer than the Red River of the North; and, according to Governor Simpson, of"]]]
