Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________ In this book we meet once again \"Wandering Will\", one of Ballantyne's perpetual heroes.  They are on a touristic cruise in the eastern Pacific, when the second mate, Griffin, eggs on some of the seamen to mutiny and take over the ship.  The captain and some of the senior officers are cast off in a ship's dinghy to survive however they can, while Will and others of his party are retained on board the \"Rover\", because of their medical knowledge, which Griffin believes might one day come in useful.  They visit a small island to restock the larder, and then head for the mainland of South America.  On arriving a party goes ashore, including our heroes, landing through heavy surf.  Everyone made it to shore, but Griffin touches ground on quicksand, and suddenly disappears from sight, never to be seen again. At this point our heroes manage to give the mutineers the slip, and disappear into the forest. Unfortunately they become disorientated, so their original plan of regaining the coast and then travelling northward along it until they should come to some major settlement had to be abandoned.  Hence the title of the book.  Thereafter we are given an interesting tour of the Andes, very well written and entertaining.  Eventually our heroes find a way to where they can take ship for England.  ________________________________________________________________________ LOST IN THE FOREST, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  AT SEA--AN ALARMING CRY AND A RESCUE.  \"At sea once more!\" said Will Osten in a meditative mood.  Our hero made this remark one night to himself, which was overheard and replied to by his friend, Captain Dall, in a manner that surprised him.  \"It's my opinion, doctor,\" said the captain in a low voice, \"that this is the last time you or I will ever be at sea, or anywhere else, if our skipper don't look better after his men, for a more rascally crew I never set eyes on, and, from a word or two I have heard dropped now and then, I feel sure some mischief is in the wind.  Come aft with me to a place where we ain't so likely to be overheard by eavesdroppers, and I'll tell you all about it.\"  Will Osten was so much astonished at his friend's remark, that he followed him to the after part of the ship without uttering a word, and there sat down on the taffrail to listen to what he had to communicate.  There was no moon in the clear sky, and the hosts of stars that studded the dark vault overhead did not shed any appreciable light on the waters of the Pacific, on which the _Rover_ floated almost motionless.  That beautiful and mysterious phosphorescence which sometimes illumines the sea was gleaming in vivid flashes in the vessel's wake, and a glowing trail of it appeared to follow the rudder like a serpent of lambent fire.  It was one of those calm, peaceful nights in which God seems to draw nearer than usual to the souls of His creatures.  The only sounds that broke the profound stillness were the pattering of reef-points on the sails as the vessel rose and sank gently on the oily swell; the measured tread of the officer of the watch, and the humming of the man at the wheel, as he stood idly at his post, for the vessel had scarcely steering-way.  \"Doctor,\" said Captain Dall in a low whisper, taking Will Osten by the button-hole and bending forward until his eyes were close to those of his young friend, \"I little thought when I set sail from England that, in a few weeks after, my good ship the _Foam_ would come a wreck an' sink to the bottom of the Pacific before my eyes.  Still less did I think that I should be cast on a coral island, have to fight like a naked savage, and be saved at last by missionaries from being roasted and eaten.  Yet all this has happened within a few months.\"  At any other time Will Osten would have smiled at the solemn manner in which this was said, but there was something in the hour, and also in the tone of his friend's voice, which tended to repress levity and raise a feeling of anxiety in his mind.  \"Well, captain,\" he said, \"what has this to do with the present evil that you seem to apprehend?\"  \"To do with it, lad? nothing--'xcept that it reminds me that we little know what is in store for us.  Here are we becalmed--three day's sail from the coral island, where the niggers were so near converting us into cooked victuals, and I wouldn't at this minute give twopence in security for the life of any one on board the _Rover_.\"  \"Why, what mean you?\" asked Will, with increasing perplexity.  \"Some of the crew are bad enough, no doubt, but many of them are evidently good men--what is it that you fear?\"  \"Fear! why, there's everything to fear,\" said the captain in a suppressed but excited whisper, drawing still closer to his friend. \"I've often sailed in these seas, and I know that while some of the traders sailing between these islands and South America and other parts are decentish enough, others are as great cut-throats as ever deserved to swing at the yard-arm.  But that's not the point.  I have overheard, of late, some of the rascals plotting to murder the officers and take this ship.  But I cannot point 'em out, for though I heard their voices I couldn't see their faces.  I think I know who they are, but could not swear to 'em, and it would be worse than useless to denounce them till we have some evidence to go on.  I therefore want you to help me with your advice and assistance, so that we may get up a counterplot to spoil their fun--for I'm quite certain that if we fail to--hark! what's that?\"  Will did not answer, but both listened intently to the sound which had interrupted Captain Dall's discourse.  It was evident that the officer and men of the watch had also heard it, for they, too, had ceased to walk to and fro, and their figures could be dimly seen in a listening attitude at the gangway.  For several minutes they listened without hearing anything--then a hoarse, guttural shout broke the stillness of the night for a few seconds and died away.  The men looked at each other, and some of the more superstitious among them grew pale.  Again the cry was repeated, somewhat nearer, and again all was still.  Some of the oldest hands in the watch stood transfixed and powerless with terror.  They would have faced death in any form manfully, but this mysterious sound unnerved them!  The officer of the watch went down to report it to Captain Blathers, who immediately came on deck.  Just as he appeared, the cry was repeated and a slight splash was heard.  \"Some one in distress,\" cried Captain Blathers promptly; \"a crew for the starboard quarter-boat to pick him up.  Stand by to lower.  Be smart, lads!\"  These words, heartily uttered, put superstitious fears to flight at once.  The men threw off their jackets; the boat was lowered, and in a few minutes was pulling about and searching in all directions.  Our hero was one of the first to leap into her, and he pulled the bow oar.  For some time they rowed about in vain.  The night was intensely dark, and the cry was not repeated, so that they had nothing to guide them in their movements.  A lantern was fixed in the ship half way up the mizzen rigging, but the lantern in the boat was concealed until the moment when it should be required, because it is easier for men to distinguish surrounding objects in comparative darkness than when a light is glaring near them.  Presently Will Osten saw a dark object like a small canoe right ahead of the boat.  \"Back water--all!\" he shouted.  The men obeyed, but it was too late; the boat struck the object, and overturned it.  Will saw something like a human form roll into the water, and heard a gurgling cry.  Without a moment's hesitation he leaped overboard, head foremost, and catching hold of the object, brought it to the surface.  He remembered at that moment having heard of a fact which is worth stating here.  The best way to save a drowning man is to approach him from behind, seize him under the armpits, and, then, getting on your back, draw him partly on to your breast and swim _on your back_ to the shore, or to a place of safety.  Thought is quicker than the lightning flash.  Will could not, of course, carry out this plan fully, nevertheless the memory of it served him in good stead, for, the instant he caught the drowning man by the hair, he kept him at arm's length, and thus avoided his death-clutch until he could grasp him under the armpits _from behind_, and thus render him powerless.  He then rose and drew him gently upon his breast, at the same time striking out with his feet and shouting--  \"Bear a hand, lads--I've got him!\"  A loud \"hurrah!\" burst from the men in the boat, and was re-echoed vehemently from the ship.  They had overshot the spot only by a few yards.  Instantly they pulled round: two strokes brought them to the spot where Will was swimming, and in another moment our hero and the rescued man were hauled into the boat.  The men gave vent to another loud and prolonged cheer, which was again replied to from the ship.  The boat was soon alongside, and the rescued man, who proved to be a man of colour in a very emaciated and exhausted condition, was hoisted on board.  His story was soon told.  He was not a native of the islands, but had been living on one of them, and had gone off to fish in a canoe, when a gale sprang up and blew him out to sea.  Four days and nights had he been exposed to the storm in his frail bark, without food or water, and was on the point of perishing when the ship chanced to pass near him.  The utterance of the cry which had attracted attention, was almost the last effort of which he was capable.  He spoke a little broken English, having learnt it while serving on board of an English trading vessel.  His name, he said, was Bunco, and a fine powerful-looking fellow he was, despite the sad condition to which he had been reduced. His shoulders, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23274"],["title","Lost in the Forest: Wandering Will's Adventures in South America (#1)"],["body","most parts of his body, were blistered by the continual washing of the sea over him, and when he was lifted on board his skin was icy cold.  Had he not been a man of iron mould, he must certainly have perished.  The poor fellow was at once taken into the cabin and carefully attended to.  He was first bathed in fresh water, then rolled in blankets, and a tumbler of hot wine and water administered, which greatly revived him, and soon caused him to fall into a sound sleep.  Whether it was that this incident softened the hearts of the seamen for a time, or that their plans were not yet ripe for execution, we cannot tell, but certain it is that nothing whatever occurred to justify Captain Dall's suspicions for several weeks after that.    CHAPTER TWO.  DESCRIBES A MUTINY, AND SHOWS THAT THE BEST OF FRIENDS MAY PART SOONER THAN THEY EXPECT.  \"A wilful man will have his way.\"  That this is a true proverb is almost universally admitted; indeed, there is reason to believe that it is equally true of women as of men; nevertheless, Captain Blathers did not believe it although he was himself a living illustration of its truth. He laughed at Captain Dall when that worthy warned him of the mutinous intentions of his crew, and when several weeks had passed away without any signs of disaffection appearing, he rallied him a good deal about what he styled his suspicious disposition, and refused to take any steps to guard against surprise.  The consequence was, that when the storm did break, he was utterly unprepared to meet it.  Griffin, the second mate, was the leader of the conspiracy, but so ably did he act his villainous part, that no one suspected him.  He was a tall, powerful, swarthy man, with a handsome but forbidding countenance.  One evening a little before sunset, while the captain was sitting at tea with those who usually messed in the cabin, Griffin looked down the skylight and reported \"a sail on the weather bow.\"  The captain immediately rose and went on deck.  The moment he appeared he was seized by Griffin.  Captain Blathers was an active and powerful man, and very passionate.  He clenched his fist and struck the second mate a blow on the chest, which caused him to stagger back, but, before he could repeat it, two sailors seized him from behind and held him fast.  The noise of the scuffle at once brought up the first mate, who was followed by Will Osten, Captain Dall, and others, all of whom were seized by the crew and secured as they successively made their appearance.  Resistance was of course offered by each, but in vain, for the thing was promptly and thoroughly carried out.  Four strong men stood at the head of the companion with ropes ready to secure their prisoners, while the greater part of the crew stood close by, armed with pistols and cutlasses.  \"It is of no use resisting, Captain Blathers,\" said Griffin, when the former was pinioned; \"you see we are quite prepared, and thoroughly in earnest.\"  The captain looked round, and a glance sufficed to convince him that this was true.  Not a friendly eye met his, because those of the crew who were suspected of being favourable to him, or who could not be safely relied on, had been seized by another party of mutineers at the same time that those in the cabin were captured, and among them were three friends of our hero--Mr Cupples the mate, Muggins, and Larry O'Hale, seamen belonging to the lost _Foam_ to which Captain Dall had referred while conversing with Will.  For a few seconds Captain Blathers' face blazed with wrath, and he seemed about to make a desperate attempt to break his bonds, but by a strong effort he restrained himself.  \"What do you intend to do?\" he asked at length, in a deep, husky voice.  \"To take possession of this ship,\" replied the second mate, with a slightly sarcastic smile.  \"These men have taken a fancy to lead a free, roving life, and to make me their captain, and I am inclined to fall in with their fancy, and to relieve you of the command.\"  \"Scoundrel!\" exclaimed the captain, \"say rather that you have misled the men, and that--\"  He checked himself, and then said sternly, \"And pray what do you intend to do with _me_?\"  \"I shall allow you a boat and provisions, Captain Blathers, for the use of yourself and your friends, and then bid you farewell.  You see we are mercifully inclined, and have no desire to shed your blood.  Ho! there-- lower one of the quarter boats.\"  This order was obeyed with promptitude.  Some provisions were thrown into the boat, and the captain was cast loose and ordered to get into it.  He turned to make a last appeal to the crew, but Griffin presented a pistol at his head and ordered him peremptorily to get into the boat. It is probable that he would have made another effort, had not two of the men forced him over the side.  Seeing this, Will Osten was so indignant and so anxious to quit the ship, that he stepped forward with alacrity to follow him.  \"No, no, my fine young fellow,\" said Griffin, thrusting him back, \"we want your help as a doctor a little longer.  It may be that you are not inclined to serve us, but we can find a way of compelling you if you're not.  Come, Mr Dall, be good enough to go next.\"  When Captain Dall's hands were loosed, he shook his fist in the second mate's face, and said, \"Rascal, you'll swing for this yet; mark my words, you'll swing for it.\"  Having relieved his feelings thus, he went over the side.  While this was going on, Larry O'Hale, Muggins, and Mr Cupples, with several others, were brought to the gangway.  Griffin addressed these before ordering them into the boat.  \"My lads,\" he said, \"I have no objection to your remaining aboard, if you choose to take part with us.\"  \"I, for one, will have nothing to do with 'e,\" said Mr Cupples sternly.  \"Then you may go,\" said Griffin, with a sneer.  Muggins, who, to use one of his own phrases, looked \"as sulky as a bear with a broken head,\" made no reply, but Larry O'Hale exclaimed, \"Sure, then, what better can I do than take part with yees?  It's a heavenly raigin o' the arth this, an good company.  Put me down on the books, Capting Griffin, dear.  I'd niver desart ye in your troubles,--be no mains.\"  There was a slight laugh at this, and Larry was graciously cast loose, and permitted to remain.  Both Will Osten and Muggins gazed at him, however, in amazement, for they had supposed that their comrade would rather have taken his chance in the captain's boat.  Suddenly an intelligent gleam shot athwart the rough visage of Muggins, and he said--  \"Of coorse I'll remain too.  It would be madness for an old salt like me to go paddlin' about the ocean in a cockleshell of a boat when he has the chance of sailin' in a good ship.  Put me down too, capting.  I'm game for anything a'most, from pitch an' toss to manslaughter.\"  So Muggins was added to the ship's company, and poor Mr Cupples went over the side with a face almost as long as his thin body, because of what he deemed the depravity and desertion of his old shipmates. Several of the ship's crew, who refused to join, also went into the boat, which was then cast loose, and dropped rapidly astern.  The whole of this exciting scene passed so quickly, that it was only when the boat was far away, like a speck on the sea, that Will Osten realised the fact that he had actually said farewell, perhaps for over, to his late comrades.  But he had not much time given him for reflection, for the new captain, after changing the course of the ship, and making a few arrangements to suit the altered state of affairs, ordered him to go forward and do duty as a common seaman, telling him that he did not intend to have any land-lubbers or idlers aboard, and that he would be called to do doctor's work when his services should be required.  That night our hero contrived to hold a whispering interview, in a dark corner of the forecastle, with his friends Larry O'Hale and Muggins.  He found that the former had resolved to join the crew in order to be near himself; that Muggins had joined, because of his desire to share the fortunes of Larry; and that both had made up their minds to effect their escape on the first favourable opportunity.  \"Now, ye see, boys,\" said Larry, \"this is how it is--\"  \"Don't open your bread-basket hatch so wide,\" growled Muggins, \"else you'll be overheerd--that's wot it is.\"  \"This is how it is,\" repeated Larry, \"not bein' fish, nor gulls, nor say sarpints, we haven't the ghost of a chance of gettin' away from this ship till we're close to land, an' even then we wont have much chance if it's suspected that we want to escape.  What then?--why, let us from this hour agree to give each other the cowld shoulder, and go at our work as if we liked it.\"  \"You're right, Larry,\" said Will.  \"If they see us much together, they'll naturally suspect that we are plotting, so--\"  At this point a voice growled from an adjacent hammock--  \"Avast spinnin' yarns there, will 'e!\"  \"Ay, it's that sea-cook, Larry O'Hale,\" cried Muggins aloud; \"he was always over fond o' talking.\"  Larry, who at the first sound had slipped away to his hammock, shouted from under the blankets, \"Ye spalpeen, it's no more me than yersilf; sure I'd have been draimin' of ould Ireland if ye--hadn't--(snore) me grandmother--(yawn) or the pig--\"  A prolonged snore terminated this sentence, and Muggins turned into his hammock, while Will Osten rose, with a quiet laugh, and went on deck.  One morning, some weeks after the conversation just related, our hero was leaning over the bulwarks near the fore-chains, watching the play of the clear waves as the ship glided quietly but swiftly through them before a light breeze.  Will was in a meditative frame of mind, and had stood there gazing dreamily down for nearly half an hour, when his elbow was touched by the man named Bunco, who had long before recovered from his exposure in the canoe.  Will was a little surprised, for he had not had much intercourse with the man, and could"]]]
