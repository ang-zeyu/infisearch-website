P'r'aps there's a bit left in some corner o'--\"  He plunged his hands into each pocket in his garments, one after another, but without success until he came to the left breast-pocket of his coat.  When he had searched that to its deepest recesses he stopped and looked up with a beaming countenance.  \"Ho! got 'im?\" asked Ebony, with interest.  Hockins did not reply, but, slowly and tenderly, drew forth--not a quid, but--a little piece of brown wood about five or six inches long.  \"A penny whistle!\" exclaimed Mark.  \"Speak with reverence, Doctor,\" returned the sailor, with a quiet smile, \"it ain't a penny whistle, it's a flageolet.  I stuck it here the last time I was amoosin' the crew o' the _Eastern Star_ an' forgot I hadn't putt it away.  Wait a bit, you shall hear.\"  Saying this Hockins put the tiny instrument to his lips, and drew from it sounds so sweet, so soft, so melodious and tuneful, that his companions seemed to listen in a trance of delight, with eyes as well as with ears!  \"Splendid!\" exclaimed Mark, enthusiastically, when the sailor ceased to play.  \"Why, Hockins, I had no idea you could play like that!  Of course I knew that you possessed musical powers to some extent, for I have heard the tooting of your flageolet through the bulkheads when at sea; but two or three inches of plank don't improve sweet sounds, I suppose.\"  \"Ho! massa, didn't I tell you t'ree or four times dat he play mos' awrful well?\"  \"True, Ebony, so you did; but I used to think your energetic praise was due to your enthusiastic disposition, and so paid no attention to your invitations to go for'ard an' listen.  Well, I confess I was a loser. You must have played the instrument a long time, surely?\"--turning to the seaman.  \"Yes, ever since I was a small boy.  My father played it before me, and taught me how to finger it.  He was a splendid player.  He used sometimes to go to the back of the door when we had a small blow-out, an' astonish the company by playin' up unexpectedly.  He was great at Scotch tunes--specially the slow ones, like this.\"  He put the little instrument to his lips again, and let it nestle, as it were, in his voluminous beard, as he drew from it the pathetic strains of \"Wanderin' Willie,\" to the evidently intense enjoyment of Ebony, who regarded music as one of the chief joys of life--next, perhaps, to cooking!  But Mark and Ebony were not the only listeners to that sweet strain. Just outside the mouth of the cave there stood a man, who, to judge from the expression of his face, was as much affected by the music as the negro.  Though he stood in such a position as to be effectually screened from the view of those within, a gleam of reflected light fell upon his figure, showing him to be a tall, handsome man in the prime of life.  He was clothed in what may be styled a mixed European and native costume, and a gun on which he rested both hands seemed to indicate him a hunter. He carried no other weapon, except a long knife in his girdle.  The mixed character of his garb extended also to his blood, for his skin, though dark and bronzed from exposure, was much lighter than that of most natives of the island, and his features were distinctly European. Quiet gravity was the chief characteristic of his countenance, and there was also an expression of profound sadness or pathos, which was probably caused by the music.  When Hockins finished his tune the three friends were almost petrified with astonishment--not unmingled with alarm--as they beheld this man walk coolly into the cave, rest his gun on the side of it, and sit gravely down on the opposite side of the fire.  The first impulse of our three friends, of course, was to spring up, but the action of the man was so prompt, and, withal, so peaceful, that they were constrained to sit still.  \"Don't be alarmed.  I come as a friend.  May I sit by your fire?\"  He spoke in good English, though with a decidedly foreign accent.  \"You are welcome, since you come as a friend,\" said Mark, \"though I must add that you have taken us by surprise.\"  \"Well now, stranger,\" said Hockins, putting his musical instrument in his pocket, \"how are we to know that you _are_ a friend--except by the cut o' your jib, which, I admit, looks honest enough, and your actions, which, we can't deny, are peaceable like?\"  The seaman put this question with a half-perplexed, half-amused air. The stranger received it without the slightest change in his grave aspect.  \"You have no other means of knowing,\" he replied, \"except by my `jib' and my actions.\"  \"Dat's a fact, anyhow,\" murmured Ebony.  \"Who _are_ you, and where do you come from?\" asked Mark.  \"I am an outlaw, and I come from the forest.\"  \"That's plain-speakin', an' no mistake,\" said Hockins, with a laugh, \"an' deserves as plain a return.  We can't say exactly that _we_ are outlaws, but we are out-an'-outers, an' we're going through the forest to--to--Anty-all-alive-O! or some such name--the capital, you know--\"  \"Antananarivo,\" suggested the outlaw.  \"That's it!  That's the name--I couldn't recall,\" said Mark, quickly. \"We are going there, if we can only find the way.\"  \"I know the way,\" returned the outlaw, \"and my reason for coming here is to offer to show it you.\"  \"Indeed!  But how came you to know our intentions, and what makes you take so much interest in us?\" asked Mark, with a look of suspicion.  \"My reason for being interested in you,\" returned the stranger, \"is a matter with which you have nothing to do.  How I came to know your intentions it is easy to explain, for I have followed you from the sea-coast step by step.  I saw you escape from the savages, saw you frightened out of the cave by my friends the outlaws, who dwell in it, followed you while you traversed the forest, listened to your conversations, witnessed your exploit with the bull, and observed you when you helped and bandaged the wounded native.\"  It would be difficult to describe the looks or feelings with which the three friends received this information.  Ebony's eyes alone would have taken at least half-an-hour of the pencil to portray.  \"But--but--why?\" stammered Mark.  \"Never mind the why,\" continued the outlaw, with a pleasant look.  \"You see that I know all about you--at least since you landed--and I also know that you have been several times in unseen danger, from which I have shielded you.  Now, you have arrived at a part of the forest which is swarming with brigands, into whose hands you are sure to fall unless I am with you.  I therefore come to offer myself as your guide.  Will you have me?\"  \"It seems to me,\" returned Mark, with something of scorn in his tone, \"that we have no choice, for you have us at your mercy--we cannot refuse.  I suppose you are the brigand chief, and are guarding us for some sinister purpose of your own.\"  \"I said not that I was a brigand,\" returned the stranger, quietly; \"I said I was an outlaw.  What else I am, and my motives of action, I choose not to tell.  You say truly--I have you in my power.  That is one reason why I would befriend you, if you will trust me.\"  The outlaw rose up as he spoke.  There was such an air of quiet dignity and evident sincerity in the man that Mark was strongly impressed.  Rising promptly, he stretched his hand across the fire, saying, \"We will trust you, friend, even though we were _not_ in your power.\"  The outlaw grasped the youth's hand with a gratified look.  \"Now,\" he added, as he took up his gun, \"I will go.  In the morning at day-break I will return.  Sleep well till then.\"  With something like a courtly salute, the mysterious stranger left them, and disappeared into the depths of the forest.    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE OUTLAW'S FRIENDS.  THREATENED DANGER CURIOUSLY AVERTED.  As might be supposed, the unexpected appearance of the outlaw, as well as his sudden departure, tended somewhat to interfere with the sleep which he had wished the travellers at parting, and the night was far advanced before they grew tired of wondering who he could be, speculating as to where he came from, and commenting on his personal appearance.  In short, at the close of their discourse, they came to the conclusion which was well embodied in the remark of Ebony, when he said, \"It's my opinion, founded on obsarvashun, dat if we was to talk an tink de whole night long we would come no nearer de troot, so I'll turn in.\"  He did turn in accordingly, and, after exhausting the regions of conjecture, the powers of speculation, and the realms of fancy, Mark and Hockins followed his example.  One consequence of their mental dissipation was that they slept rather beyond the hour of day-break, and the first thing that recalled the two white men to consciousness was the voice of their black comrade exclaiming:--  \"Ho! hi! hallo!  I smells a smell!\"  They lifted their three heads simultaneously and beheld the outlaw sitting calmly beside the fire roasting steaks.  For the first time the mysterious stranger smiled--and it was a peculiarly sweet half-grave sort of attractive smile, as far removed from the fiendish grin of the stage bandit as night is from day.  \"I knew you would be hungry, and guessed you would be sleepy,\" he said, in a deep musical voice, \"so I have prepared breakfast.  Are you ready?\"  \"Ready!\" repeated Hockins, rising with a mighty yawn, and stretching himself, as was his wont; \"I just think we are.  Leastwise _I_ am.  Good luck to 'ee Mister Outlaw, what have 'ee got there?\"  \"Beef, marrow-bones, and rice,\" replied the man.  \"You may call me Samuel if you like.  It was my father's first name, but I'm best known among my friends as Ravoninohitriniony.\"  \"Well, that _is_ a jaw-breaker!\" exclaimed Hockins, with a laugh, as they all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23263"],["title","The Fugitives: The Tyrant Queen of Madagascar (#7)"],["body","down to breakfast.  \"Ra-vo--what did 'ee say?\"  \"Better not try it till arter breakfast,\" suggested Ebony.  \"Couldn't we shorten it a bit?\" said Mark, beginning to consult a marrow-bone.  \"What say you to the first half--Ravonino?\"  \"As you please,\" replied the outlaw, who was already too much absorbed with steaks to look up.  \"Not a bad notion,\" said Hockins.  \"Sam'l Ravonino--I've heerd wuss; anyhow it's better than the entire complication--eh, Ebony?\"  \"Mush better,\" assented the negro; \"dere's no use wotsomediver for de hitri--hitri-folderol-ony bit of it.  Now, 'Ockins, fair play wid de marrow-bones.  Hand me anoder.\"  \"Is it far, Mr Ravonino,\" asked Mark, \"from here to the capital--to Antananarivo?\"  \"You cleared 'im that time, Doctor!\" murmured Hockins, wiping his mouth with a bunch of grass which he carried as a substitute for a pocket-handkerchief.  \"Yes, it is a long way,\" said the outlaw; \"many days' journey over mountain and plain.\"  \"And are you going to guide us all the way there?\"  \"No, not all the way.  You forget I am an outlaw.  It would cost me my life if I were to appear in Antananarivo.\"  Mark was on the point of asking why, but, remembering the rebuff of the previous night, forbore to put questions relative to his new friend's personal affairs.  Indeed he soon found that it was useless to do so, for whenever he approached the subject Ravonino became so abstracted and deaf that no reply could be drawn from him.  As if to compensate for this, however, the man was exceedingly communicative in regard to all other subjects, and there was a quiet urbanity in his manner which rendered his conversation exceedingly attractive.  Moreover, to the surprise of Mark, this mysterious stranger gave evidence of a considerable amount of education.  He also gratified Hockins by his evident delight in the flageolet, and his appreciation of nautical stories and \"lingo,\" while he quite won the heart of Ebony by treating him with the same deference which he accorded to his companions.  In short each of our travellers congratulated himself not a little on this pleasant acquisition to the party--the only drawback to their satisfaction being their inability to reconcile the existence of such good qualities with the condition of an outlaw!  \"However,\" remarked Hockins, after a long talk with his comrades on this subject when Ravonino was absent, \"it's none of our business what he's bin an' done to other people.  What we've got to do with is the way he behaves to _us_, d'ee see?\"  \"He's a trump,\" said Ebony, with a nod of decision.  \"I agree with you,\" said Mark; \"and I only wish he was a little more communicative about himself.  However, we must take him as we find him, and try to win his confidence.\"  During the whole of that first day their guide conducted them through such intricate and evidently unfrequented parts of the forest that their advance was comparatively slow and toilsome, but, being young and strong and well-fed, they did not mind that.  In fact Mark Breezy enjoyed it, for the wilder and more tangled the scenery was through which they forced their way, the more did it accord with the feelings of romance which filled him, and the thought, too, of being guided through the woods by an outlaw tended rather to increase his satisfaction.  \"Are all the roads in your island as bad as these?\" he asked, after plumping up to the knees in a quagmire, out of which he scrambled with difficulty.  \"No, many of them are worse and some better,\" answered the guide; \"but I keep away from them, because the Queen's soldiers and spies are hunting about the land just now.\"  \"Oho!\" thought Mark, \"I begin to see; you are a rebel.\"  Then, aloud, \"Your country, then, is governed by a queen?\"  \"Misgoverned,\" returned Ravonino in a tone of bitterness, which, however, he evidently tried to restrain.  Fearing to tread again on forbidden ground, Mark forbore to put questions about the guide's objections to his queen, but simply asked her name, and if she had reigned long.  \"Her name,\" said Ravonino, \"is Ranavalona.  She has reigned for twenty-seven years--twenty-seven long and weary years!  I was a little boy when she usurped the throne.  Now my sun has reached its meridian, yet she is still there, a blight upon the land.  But God knows what is best.  He cannot err.\"  This was the first reference that Ravonino had made to the Creator, and Mark was about to push his inquiries further, when a confused sound of voices was heard not far in advance of them.  Ravonino, who had been walking with an easy nonchalant air ahead of the party, on a very narrow footpath, suddenly stopped to listen with a look of anxiety.  A moment later and he entered the bush that fringed the path and overhung it.  \"Come,\" he said in a low voice, \"follow me, close!\"  Without a word of explanation he strode into the dense undergrowth, through which he went with the agility of a panther and the sinuosity of a serpent.  The others, being, as we have said, very active and strong, kept close at his heels, though not without difficulty.  Coming at last to a place where the shrubbery was so intertwined that it was impossible to see more than a yard or two in advance, they suddenly found themselves stopped by a sheer precipice.  Only for a few seconds, however, was their progress arrested, while their guide turned to explain.  \"There is another and an easier way to the place I am making for, but it is much longer and more exposed.  I take for granted that you have strong arms and steady heads, but if not, speak out, for I would not lead you into danger.\"  \"Lead on,\" said Mark, promptly, \"wherever you go, we will follow.\"  With something like an amused twinkle of the eye, Ravonino began to climb up the face of the precipice, holding on to roots and rope-like creepers like a monkey.  \"If this here sort o' cordage was only a bit more taut I wouldn't mind it so much,\" growled Hockins, as he lost his footing at one place, and swung off the face of the precipice,--holding on to a stout creeper, however, with seaman-like grip and coolness.  He quickly caught hold of another creeper, and drew himself again into comparative safety.  A minute later and they all stood on a ledge, high up on the face of the cliff, and close to what appeared to be the mouth of a cavern.  \"Look there,\" said their guide, pushing aside the bushes which overhung the cliff in all directions.  They looked, and through the opening beheld a band of men moving in single file along the track they had just left.  They were most of them nearly naked, with only short calico breeches which did not quite reach to their knees, but all had muskets on their shoulders and cross-belts on their dark bodies, one of which belts sustained apparently a cartridge-box, the other a bayonet.  Their own thick hair was all the cap they wore, excepting two or three men of superior rank, who wore cloths wrapped in turban fashion on their heads, and a voluminous plaid-like garment on their shoulders.  These carried swords instead of muskets.  \"The soldiers of the Queen,\" said Ravonino, in answer to Mark Breezy's look.  \"They are out hunting.\"  \"What do they hunt for?\" asked Mark.  \"Men and women.\"  \"By which I suppose you mean rebels.\"  \"No, they are not rebels; they are the queen's most loyal subjects!\"  \"But loyal subjects do not usually fly from their rulers,\" objected Mark.  \"True, but loyal subjects sometimes fly from tyranny,\" returned the guide.  \"Come, I will introduce you to some fugitives from tyranny.\"  He turned as he spoke and led the way into the cave before mentioned. Profound darkness did not prevent his advancing with a firm unhesitating step.  As he led Mark by the hand, Hockins and Ebony held on to him and to each other, and had no difficulty in following.  Presently they came to a wooden obstruction which proved to be a door.  Voices in conversation were heard on the other side of it.  A knock from the guide produced sudden silence.  Another knock drew from those within an exclamation of surprise, and next moment the heavy door swung open on creaking hinges.  \"Yes, it _is_ Ravoninohitriniony!  I knew his knock.  He is come!\" exclaimed a girlish voice, as a pair of arms were seen dimly to encircle the guide's neck.  Of course the girl spoke in the native tongue, which was quite incomprehensible to our travellers, but if we are to enlighten our readers we must needs translate as we go along.  \"My sister, Ra-Ruth,\" said the guide, presenting her to his new friends. \"She was a lady in the palace of the queen once.  Now she is an outlaw, like myself--has fled from tyranny, and, perhaps, death.  All in this cave are in the same case--fugitives from our tyrant queen.\"  They reached the interior of the place as he spoke, and Ravonino, pointing to a bundle of dried ferns, bade his companions rest there until he had explained some private matters to the people.  Nothing loth--for they were all somewhat fatigued by their recent exertions--our travellers flung themselves on what proved to be a luxurious couch, and observed what went on around them.  Truly it was a strange scene, romantic enough even to satisfy the longings of Mark Breezy!  The cavern itself was a curious one, being in the form of a vast hall, with three smaller chambers opening out of it.  The central hall seemed to have no roof, for although brightly lighted by several torches fixed to its rugged walls the upper part was lost in profound obscurity.  This strange abode was peopled by a considerable number of men and women--natives of the island--who from the variety in their costume, features, and complexion, evidently belonged to different tribes.  Some were strong, tall, and rather harsh-featured, others were more slender in build and with refined countenances.  A few were almost black, others of a light olive colour, and several made that approach to whiteness of skin which in England is known as brunette.  All were more or less characterised by that"]]]
