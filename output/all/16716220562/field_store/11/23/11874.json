He who gave this order was a tall, sinewy man, middle-aged apparently, and of grave demeanour.  His dress was similar to that of the other firemen, but there was an air of quiet unobtrusive authority about him, which showed that he was a leader.  \"We might get on the roof now, Mr Braidwood,\" suggested Dale, touching his helmet as he addressed the well-known chief of the London Fire-Engine Establishment.  \"Not yet, Dale, not yet,\" said Braidwood; \"get inside and see if you can touch the fire through the drawing-room floor.  It's just fallen in.\"  Dale and his men at once entered the front door of the building, dragging the branch and hose along with them, and were lost in smoke.  Previous to the arrival of the fire-engines, however, a scene had been enacted which Willie Willders had not witnessed.  A fire-escape was first to reach the burning house.  This was then, and still is, usually the case, owing to the fact that escapes are far more numerous in London than engines, so that the former, being always close at hand, often accomplish their great work of saving life before the engines make their appearance.  The escape in the immediate neighbourhood of Beverly Square was under the charge of Conductor Samuel Forest, a man who, although young, had already saved many lives, in the service of the Society for the Protection of Life from Fire.  When Forest reached the field of action, Mr James Auberly was seen at an upper window in a state of undignified _dishabille_, shouting for help, and half suffocated with smoke, with Mrs Rose hanging round his neck on one side and Matty Merryon at the other.  Poor Auberly, having tried the staircase on the first alarm, was driven back by smoke, and rushed wildly to the window, where the two domestics, descending in terror from their attic, clung to him and rendered him powerless.  Forest at once pitched his escape--which was just a huge scientifically-constructed ladder, set on wheels.  The head of it reached to the windows of the second floor.  By pulling a rope attached to a lever, he raised a second ladder of smaller size, which was fitted to the head of the large one.  The top of this second ladder was nearly sixty feet from the ground, and it reached the window at which Mr Auberly was still shouting.  Forest at once sprang up.  \"Leave me; save the women,\" gasped Auberly, as a man entered the room, but the dense smoke overpowered him as he spoke, and he fell forward. The women also sank to the ground.  Forest instantly seized Mrs Rose in his powerful arms, and hurrying down the ladder to the top of the escape, put her into the canvas trough or sack which was suspended below the ladder all the way.  Down this she slid somewhat violently but safely to the ground, while Forest ran up again and rescued Matty in the same way.  Mr Auberly was more difficult to manage, being a heavy man, and his rescuer was almost overpowered by the thick smoke in the midst of which all this was done.  He succeeded, however, but fainted on reaching the ground.  It was at this point that the first engine arrived, and only a few minutes elapsed when the second made its appearance, followed by the cab from which the young man leapt with the exclamation of surprise and alarm that had astonished Willie Willders.  Pushing his way to the place where Mr Auberly and the others lay, the youth fell on his knees.  \"My father!\" he exclaimed wildly.  \"He's all right, lad,\" said Mr Braidwood, coming up at that moment, and laying his hand kindly on the youth's shoulder; \"he's only choked with smoke, and will be better in a minute.  Any more in the house?\" he added quickly.  Young Auberly leaped up with a shout.  \"My sister! is she not saved?  Are _all_ here?\"  He waited not for a reply, but in another moment was on the fire-escape.  \"After him, two of you,\" said Braidwood, turning to his men.  Two at once obeyed.  In fact, they had leaped forward almost before the brief command was uttered.  One of these firemen was conspicuous for his height and strength.  He was first up the ladder.  Close upon him followed Baxmore with a lantern.  Nothing but smoke had yet reached the room into which young Auberly entered, so that he instantly found himself in impenetrable darkness, and was almost choked as well as blinded.  \"Have a care, Frank; the floor must be about gone by this time,\" said Baxmore, as he ran after his tall comrade.  The man whom he called Frank knew this.  He also knew that it was not likely any one had been left in the room from which the master of the house had been rescued, and he thought it probable that his daughter would occupy a room on the same floor with her father.  Acting on this supposition, and taking for granted that the room they were about to enter was Mr Auberly's bedroom, the tall fireman dashed at once through the smoke, and tumbled over the prostrate form of young Auberly.  \"Look after him, Baxmore,\" he gasped, as he seized the lamp from his comrade's hand, and darted across the room and out into the passage, where he went crash against a door and burst it open.  Here the smoke was not so dense, so that he could breathe, though with difficulty.  One glance showed him where the bed was.  He felt it.  A female form was lying on it.  The light weight and the long hair which swept across his face as he raised it gently but swiftly on his shoulder, told him that it was that of a girl.  At that moment he heard a loud shout from the crowd, which was followed by a crash.  Dashing once more across the passage, he saw that a lurid flame was piercing the smoke in the other room.  The staircase he knew was impassable; probably gone by that time; but he had not time to think, so he drew the blanket over the girl's head and bounded towards the window.  There was a feeling of softness under his feet, as if the floor were made of pasteboard.  He felt it sinking beneath him.  Down it went, just as he laid hold of the head of the fire-escape, from which he hung suspended in the midst of the smoke and sparks that rose from the falling ruin.  Strong though the young fireman was, he could not raise himself by one arm, while the other was twined round Louisa Auberly.  At that moment, Baxmore, having carried young Auberly down in safety, again ascended and appeared at the window.  He seized Frank by the hair of the head.  \"Let go my hair, and catch the girl!\" shouted Frank.  \"All right,\" said Baxmore, seizing Loo and lifting her over the window sill.  Frank being thus relieved, swung himself easily on the sill, and grasping Loo once more, descended to the street, where he was met by Mr Auberly, who had recovered from his state of partial suffocation, and who seized his child and hurried with her into a neighbouring house. Thither he was followed by Mrs Rose and Matty, who had also recovered.  During these episodes, the firemen had continued at their work with cool and undistracted attention.  And here the value of organisation was strikingly and beautifully brought out; for, while the crowd swayed to and fro, now breathless with anxiety lest the efforts of the bold conductor of the fire-escape should fail; anon wild with excitement and loud in cheers when he succeeded, each fireman paid devoted and exclusive attention to his own prescribed piece of duty, as if nothing else were going on around him, and did it with all his might--well knowing that every other piece of work was done, or point of danger guarded, by a comrade, while the eagle eyes of Mr Braidwood and his not less watchful foremen superintended all, observed and guided, as it were, the field of battle.  And truly, good generalship was required, for the foe was fierce and furious.  The \"devouring element\" rushed onward like a torrent.  The house was large and filled with rich furniture, which was luxurious food for the flames as they swept over the walls, twined round the balustrades, swallowed the paintings, devoured the woodwork, and melted the metal in their dread progress.  But the foe that met them was, on this occasion, more than a match for the flames.  It was a hand-to-hand encounter.  The men followed them foot by foot, inch by inch--sometimes almost singeing their beards or being well-nigh choked and blinded by dense volumes of smoke, but, if driven back, always returning to the charge.  The heat at times beat on their helmets so fiercely that they were forced to turn their faces aside and half-turn their backs on the foe, but they _always_ kept their weapons--the \"branches\"--to the front, and continued to discharge upon him tons and tons of aqueous artillery.  \"Get up to the windows now; use the escape,\" said Mr Braidwood; and as he said this he passed through the doorway of the burning house.  Some of the men rushed up the escape and let down a line, to which one of the branches was made fast.  \"Avast pumpin', number two!\" shouted Baxmore from the midst of clouds of smoke that were bursting out from the window.  Number two engine was stopped.  Its branch was pulled up and pointed inside _straight at the fire_; the signal given, \"Down with number two!\" and a hiss was followed by volumes of steam.  The work of extinction had at last begun in real earnest.  As long as they could only stand in the street and throw water in through the windows at haphazard, they might or might not hit the fire--and at all events they could not attack its strong points; but now, Baxmore at one window, and one of the men of the first engine at another, played point-blank into the flames, and, wherever the water hit, they were extinguished.  Presently they got inside and began to be able to see through the smoke; a blue glimmer became visible, the branch was pointed, and it was gone.  By this time the second floor had partly given way, and fire was creeping down the rafters to the eaves of the house.  Baxmore observed this; and pointed the branch straight up.  The fire at that part was put out, and a heavy shower"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23380"],["title","Fighting the Flames (#6)"],["body","water fell back on the fireman, drenching him to the skin.  The attack had now become general.  The firemen swarmed in at the doors and windows the moment that it was possible for a human being to breathe the smoke and live.  One of the engines attached two additional lengths of hose, dragged the branch through the first floor to the back of the house, got upon an outhouse, in at a back window, and attacked the foe in rear.  On the roof, Frank and Dale were plying their hatchets, their tall figures sharply defined against the wintry sky, and looking more gigantic than usual.  The enemy saved them the trouble of cutting through, however, for it suddenly burst upwards, and part of the roof fell in.  It would certainly have taken Frank prisoner had not Dale caught him by the collar, and dragged him out of danger.  Instantly a branch was pointed downwards, and the foe was beaten back; from above, below, before, and behind, it was now met with deluges of water, which fell on the shoulders of the men in the lower floor in a continuous hot shower, while they stood ankle-deep in hot water.  In ten minutes after this the fire was effectually subdued, the lower floor having been saved, although its contents were severely damaged by water.  It was only necessary now, that one of the engines should remain for a time, to make good the victory.  The others rolled up their hose, and prepared to depart.  The King Street engine was the first to quit the field of battle.  While the men were getting ready, Mr Auberly, muffled in a long cloak, stepped from the crowd and touched Frank, the tall fireman, on the shoulder.  \"Sir,\" said he in a low voice, \"you saved my child.  I would show my sense of gratitude.  Will you accept of this purse?\"  Frank shook his head and a smile played on his smoke-begrimed countenance as he said:  \"No, Mr Auberly.  I am obliged to you, but I cannot accept of it.  I do not want it, and besides, the men of the brigade are not allowed to take money.\"  \"But you will let me do something for you?\" urged Mr Auberly.  \"Is there nothing that I can do?\"  \"Nothing, sir,\" said Frank.  He paused for a moment, and then resumed--\"Well, there _is_ something that perhaps you could do, sir.  I have a little brother out of employment; if you could get him a situation, sir.\"  \"I will,\" said Mr Auberly with emotion.  \"Send him to me on Thursday forenoon.  He will find me living next door to my--to my late home.  I shall stay with a friend there for some time.  Good-night.\"  \"Men of King Street engine get up,\" cried Dale.  \"Stay--what is your name?\" said Mr Auberly turning round.  But Frank was gone.  He had leaped to his place on the engine and was off at a rattling pace through the now silent and deserted streets of the sleeping city.  Although they drove on at great speed there was no shouting now, for neither 'bus, cab, nor foot-passenger blocked up the way, and the men, begrimed with smoke and charcoal, wet, and weary with two hours of almost uninterrupted labour of a severe as well as dangerous character, sat or stood in their places in perfect silence.  On reaching the fire-station they leaped to the ground, and all went quickly and silently to their neighbouring homes and beds, except the two men on duty.  These, changing their coats and boots, lay down on the trestles, and at once fell fast asleep--the engine and horses having been previously housed--and then Dale sat down to make an entry of the event in his day-book.  The whole thing might have been only a vivid dream, so silent was the room and so devoid of any evidence of recent excitement, while the reigning tranquillity was enhanced rather than decreased by the soft breathing of the sleepers, the ticking of the clock, and the scratching of Dale's pen as he briefly recorded the facts of the fire that night in Beverly Square.    CHAPTER FIVE.  WILLIE WILLDERS IN DIFFICULTIES.  During the progress of the fire, small Willie Willders was in a state of the wildest, we might almost say hilarious, excitement; he regarded not the loss of property; the fire never struck him in _that_ light.  His little body and big spirit rejoiced in the whole affair as a magnificent display of fireworks and heroism.  When the fire burst through the library windows he shouted; when Sam Forest, the conductor of the fire-escape, saved Mr Auberly and the women, he hurrahed; when the tall fireman and Baxmore rescued Louisa Auberly he cheered and cheered again until his shrill voice rose high above the shouting of the crowd.  When the floors gave way he screamed with delight, and when the roof fell in he shrieked with ecstasy.  Sundry and persevering were the efforts he made to break through the police by fair means and foul; but, in his energy, he over-reached himself, for he made himself so conspicuous that the police paid special attention to him, and wherever he appeared he was snubbed and thrust back, so that his great desire to get close to the men while they were at work was frustrated.  Willie had a brother who was a fireman, and he wished earnestly that he might recognise him, if present; but he knew that, being attached to the southern district of the City, he was not likely to be there, and even if he were, the men were all so much alike in their uniform, that it was impossible at a distance to distinguish one from another.  True it is that his brother was uncommonly tall, and very strong; but as the London firemen were all picked men, many of them were very tall, and all of them were strong.  Not until the last engine left the ground, did Willie Willders think it advisable to tear himself away, and hasten to his home in Notting Hill, where he found his mother sitting up for him in a state of considerable anxiety.  She forebore to question him that night, however.  When Willie appeared next morning--or rather, the same morning, for it was nearly four o'clock when he went to bed--he found his mother sitting by the fire knitting a sock.  Mrs Willders was a widow, and was usually to be found seated by the fire, knitting a sock, or darning one, or mending some portion of male attire.  \"So you were at a fire last night, Willie?\" said the widow.  \"Yes, I was,\" replied the boy, going up to his mother, and giving her what he styled a \"roystering\" kiss, which she appeared to like, although she was scarcely able to bear it, being thin and delicately formed, and somewhat weak from bad health.  \"No lives lost, I hope, Willie?\"  \"No; there ain't often lives lost when Sam Forest, the fire-escape-man, is there.  You know Forest, mother, the man that we've heard so much of? Ah, it _was_ sitch fun!  You've no notion!  It would have made you split your sides wi' laughin' if you'd seen Sam come out o' the smoke carryin' the master o' the house on his shoulder in his shirt and drawers, with only one sock on, an' his nightcap tied so tight under his chin that they had to cut it off--him in a swound, too, hangin' as limp as a dead eel on Sam's shoulder, with his head down one side, an' his legs down the other.  Oh, it _was_ a lark!\"  The boy recalled \"the lark\" to his own mind so vividly, that he had to stop at this point, in order to give vent to an uproarious fit of laughter.  \"Was Frank there?\" inquired the widow, when the fit subsided.  \"Not that I know of, mother; I looked hard for him, but didn't see him. There was lots o' men big enough to be him; but I couldn't get near enough to see for the bobbies.  I wonder what them bobbies were made for!\" continued Willie, with a look of indignation, as he seated himself at the table, and began to eat a hearty breakfast; \"the long lamp-posts! that are always in the way when nobody wants 'em.  I do believe they was invented for nothin' else than to aggravate small boys and snub their inquiring minds.\"  \"Where was the fire, Willie?\"  \"In Beverly Square.  I say, mother, if that there grocer don't send us better stuff than this here bacon in future, I'll--I'll have to give him up.\"  \"I can't afford to get better, dear,\" said the widow meekly.  \"I know that, mother; but _he_ could afford to _give_ better.  However, it's down now, so it don't much matter.\"  \"Did you hear whose house was burned, Willie?\"  \"A Mr Oberly, or somethin' like that.\"  \"Auberly!\" exclaimed the widow, with a start.  \"Well, p'raps it is Auberly; but whichever it is, he's got a pretty kettle o' fish to look after this mornin'.  You seem to have heard of him before, mother?\"  \"Yes, Willie, I--I know him a--at least I have met with him often.  You see I was better off once, and used to mingle with--but I need not trouble you with that.  On the strength of our former acquaintance, I thought I would write and ask him to get you a situation in an office, and I have got a letter from him, just before you came down to breakfast, saying that he will do what he can, and bidding me send you to him between eleven and twelve to-morrow.\"  \"Whew!\" whistled Willie, \"an' he burnt out o' house and home, without a coat to his back or a shoe to his foot.  It strikes me I'll have to try to get _him_ a situation.\"  \"He won't be found at the house, now, I dare say, my son, so we'll have to wait a little; but the burning of his house and furniture won't affect him much, for he's rich.\"  \"Humph! p'raps not,\" said Willie; \"but the burnin' of his little girl might have--\"  \"You said that _no_ lives were lost,\" cried Mrs Willders, turning pale.  \"No more there was, mother; but if it hadn't bin for one o' the firemen that jumped in at a blazin' winder an' brought her out through fire an' smoke, she'd have bin a cinder by this time, an' money wouldn't have bought the rich man another daughter, _I_ know.\"  \"True, my son,\" observed Mrs Willders, resting her forehead on her hand; then, as if suddenly recollecting something, she looked up and said, \"Willie, I want you to go down to the City with these socks to Frank.  This is his birthday, and I sat late last night on purpose to get them finished.  His station is a"]]]
