[Illustration]    But the beautiful wife   Of F. Ferdinand Fife     Was the wildest that ever was known:   She'd grumble and glare,   Till the man didn't dare     To say that his soul was his own.   She sneered at his ills,   And quadrupled his bills,     And spent nearly twice what he earned;   Her husband deserted,   And frivoled, and flirted,     Till Ferdinand's reason was turned.    [Illustration]    He repented too late,   And his terrible fate     Upon him so heavily sat,   That he swore at the day   When he sat down to play     At cards with John Jeremy Platt.   He was dead in a year,   And the fair Guinevere     In society sparkled again,   While the chaperons fluttered   Their fans, as they muttered:     \"She's getting exceedingly plain!\"     _The Moral_: Predicaments often are found   That beautiful duty is apt to get round:   But greedy extortioners better beware   For dutiful beauty is apt to get square!    [Illustration: _This shows how at poker one loses his pelf                  When the other's a joker and knave in himself._]       How a Fair One no Hope to His Highness Accorded     She has slid down the channels   Of history's annals     Disguised as the child of a king,   But that is a glib   And iniquitous fib,     For she never was any such thing:   They called her the Fair One with Golden Locks,   And it's true she had lovers who swarmed in flocks,   But the rest is ironic;   Her business chronic   Was selling hair-tonic                     By bottle and box!    From the dawn till the gloaming   She used to sit combing     Her hair in a languorous way.   And her suitors would stop   To look into the shop,     And stand there the rest of the day.   She filled them with mute, but with deep despair,   For she never glanced up, with a smile, to where   They stood about, crushing   Each other, and blushing:   She simply kept brushing                     Her beautiful hair.    But a prince who was passing,   Engaged in amassing     Some facts on American life,   Was suddenly struck   By the fact that his luck     Might give him that girl for a wife!   His rashness he didn't attempt to excuse,   He entered the shop and he stated his views.   Remarking,                 \"My jewel,   I'm confident you will   Not wish to be cruel                     Enough to refuse.    [Illustration]    \"Most winsome of creatures,\"   He told her, \"your features     Have led me to candidly say   That no other beside   Would I have for a bride:     We'll be married a week from to-day!   I belong to a long and a titled line,   And the least of your wishes I won't decline;   Next month I will usher   My wife into Russia:--   Sweet comber and brusher,                     Consider you're mine!\"    She looked at him squarely,   Considered him fairly,     Her glance was as keen as a knife,   Then she turned up her nose,   And, with icy repose,     She answered: \"Well, not on your life!   You're not on the paper the only blot!   Do you think I come twelve in a parcel--what?   _Me_ pose as your dearie?   Oh, go and chase Peary!   You're making me weary.                     Now git!\"                      (He got!)    [Illustration: _This shows how, with never a shadow of doubt,                  When you go in for love you are apt to come out._]    The crowd that had waited   Outside was elated     So much by the prince's mischance,   That they greeted with jeers   And ironical cheers,     The end of his little romance.   They said: \"Did it hurt when the ground you hit?\"   They searched for some mark where the prince had lit,   And as he looked colder,   They only grew bolder,   And tapped on his shoulder                     With: \"Tag! You're It!\"    The lengthy discussion   That sensitive Russian     Compiled on the U. S. A.   Was read by the maid,   As she carelessly played     With her beautiful hair one day.   \"The talk you hear in that primitive land,\"   He wrote, \"nobody can understand.\"   \"Somebody who guffed him,\"   She said, \"has stuffed him,   And easily bluffed him                     To beat the band!\"     _The Moral_: The people across the brine   Are exceedingly strong on Auld Lang Syne,   But they're lost in the push when they strike a gang   That is strong on American new line slang!    [Illustration]       How Thomas a Maid from a Dragon Released     Though Philip the Second   Of France was reckoned     No coward, his breath came short   When they told him a dragon   As big as a wagon     Was waiting below in the court!   A dragon so long, and so wide, and so fat,   That he couldn't get in at the door to chat:   The king couldn't leave him   Outside and grieve him,   He had to receive him                     Upon the mat,    [Illustration]    The dragon bowed nicely,   And very concisely     He stated the reason he'd called:   He made the disclosure   With frigid composure.     King Philip was simply appalled!   He demanded for eating, a fortnight apart,   The monarch's ten daughters, all dear to his heart.   \"And now you'll produce,\" he   Concluded, \"the juicy   And succulent Lucie                     By way of start!\"    King Philip was pliant,   And far from defiant     --\"And servile,\" no doubt you retort!--   But if _you_ struck a snag on   A bottle-green dragon,     Who filled up two-thirds of your court,   And curled up his tail on your new tin roof,   And made your piazza groan under his hoof,   Would you threaten and thunder,   Or just knuckle under   Completely, I wonder,                     If put to proof?    [Illustration]    By way of a truce, he   Brought out little Lucie     And watched her conducted away,   But all of the others   Were out with their brothers!     Thus gaining a little delay,   He promised through heralds sent west and east,   His crown, and his kingdom, and last, not least,   His daughter so sightly   To any one knightly   Who'd come and politely                     Wipe out that beast!    For love of the charmer,   Arrayed in his armor,     Each suitor for glory who yearned,   Would gallantly hasten,   The dragon to chasten,     But none of them ever returned!   When the dragon had eaten some sixteen score   He hung up this sign on his cavern door,   Whereat he lay pronely   In majesty lonely:    +------------------------------+   |_There's Standing Room Only   |   |      For Three Knights More!_|   +------------------------------+    A slim adolescent,   His beard only crescent,     Rode up at this stage of the game   To where the old sinner   Lay gorged with his dinner,     And breathing out torrents of flame.   He gathered a tip from the flaunting sign,   And took his position the fourth in line,   Until, as foreboded,   By food incommoded,   The dragon exploded                     At half-past nine.    [Illustration: _This shows how a servant may laugh at the Fates,                  Since everything comes to the fellow who waits._]    The king was delighted   At first when he sighted     The victor, but then in dismay   Regretted his promise.   The stripling was Thomas,     His Majesty's _valet-de-pied_!   He asked him at once: \"Will you compromise?\"   But Thomas looked straight in his master's eyes,   And answered severely:   \"I see your game clearly,   And scorn it sincerely.                     Hand out the prize!\"    Not long did he linger   Before on the finger     Of Lucie he fitted a ring:   A month or two later   They made him dictator,     In place of the elderly king:   He was lauded by pulpit, and boomed by press,   And no one had ever a chance to guess,   Beholding this hero   Who ruled like a Nero,   His valor was zero,                     Or something less.     _The Moral:_ And still from Nice to Calais   Discretion's the better part of--                     --_valets!_       _How a Beauty was Waked and Her Suitor was Suited_     Albeit wholly penniless,   Prince Charming wasn't any less     Conceited than a Croesus or a modern millionaire:   Though often in necessity,   No one would ever guess it. He     Was candidly insolvent, and he frankly didn't care!   Of the many debts he made   Not a one was ever paid,     But no one ever pressed him to refund the borrowed gold:   While he recklessly kept spending,   People gladly kept on lending,     For the fact they knew a title                     Was requital                       Twenty-fold!        (He lived in sixteen sixty-three,          This smooth unblushing article,        Since when, as far as I can see,          Men haven't changed a particle!)    In Charming's principality   There was a wild locality,     Composed of sombre forest, and of steep and frowning crags,   Of pheasant and of rabbit, too;   And here it was his habit to     Go hunting with his courtiers in the keen pursuit of stags.   But the charger that he rode   So mercurially strode     That the prince on one occasion left the others in the lurch,   And the falling darkness found him,   With no vassals left around him,     Near a building like an abbey,                     Or a shabby                       Ruined church.   His Highness said: \"I'll ring the bell     And stay till morning in it!\" (He   Took Hobson's choice, for no hotel     There was in the vicinity.)    His ringing was so vehement   That any one could see he meant     To suffer no refusal, but, in spite of all the din,   There was no answer audible,   And so, with courage laudable,     His Royal Highness turned the knob, and stoutly entered in.   Then he strode across the court,   But he suddenly stopped short     When he passed within the castle by a massive oaken door:   There were courtiers without number,   But they all were plunged in slumber,     The prince's ear delighting                     By uniting   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23024"],["title","Grimm Tales Made Gay (#4)"],["body","                    In a snore.   The prince remarked: \"This must be Philadelphia,       Pennsylvania!\"   (And so was born the jest that's still     The comic journal's mania!)    [Illustration: _This shows how the prince won the princess's heart,                  And the end of her sleeping was simply a start._]    With torpor reprehensible,   Numb, comatose, insensible,     The flunkeys and the chamberlains all slumbered like the dead,   And snored so loud and mournfully,   That Charming passed them scornfully     And came to where a princess lay asleep upon a bed.   She was so extremely fair   That His Highness didn't care     For the risk, and so he kissed her ere a single word he spoke:--   In a jiffy maids and pages,   Ushers, lackeys, squires, and sages,     As fresh as if they'd been at least                     A week awake,                       Awoke,   And hastened, bustled, dashed and ran     Up stairways and through galleries:   In brief, they one and all began     Again to earn their salaries!    [Illustration]    Aroused from her paralysis,   As if in deep analysis     Of him who had awakened her, the princess met his eye:   Her glance at first was critical,   And sternly analytical.     And then she dropped her lashes and she gave a little sigh.   As he watched her, wholly dumb,   She observed: \"You doubtless come     For one of two good reasons, and I'm going to ask you which.   Do you mean my house to harry,   Or do you propose to marry?\"     He answered: \"I may rue it,                     But I'll do it,                       If you're rich!\"   The princess murmured with a smile:     \"I've millions, at the least, to come!\"   The prince cried: \"Please excuse me, while     I go and get the priest to come!\"    [Illustration]     _The Moral_: When affairs go ill   The sleeping partner foots the bill.       _How Jack Found that Beans May go Back on a Chap_     Without the slightest basis   For hypochondriasis     A widow had forebodings which a cloud around her flung,   And with expression cynical   For half the day a clinical     Thermometer she held beneath her tongue.    Whene'er she read the papers   She suffered from the vapors,     At every tale of malady or accident she'd groan;   In every new and smart disease,   From housemaid's knee to heart disease,     She recognized the symptoms as her own!    She had a yearning chronic   To try each novel tonic,     Elixir, panacea, lotion, opiate, and balm;   And from a homoeopathist   Would change to an hydropathist,     And back again, with stupefying calm!    [Illustration]    The closets of her villa   Were full of sarsaparilla,     Ammonia, digitalis, bronchial troches, soda mint.   Restoratives hirsutical,   And soaps to clean the cuticle,     And iodine, and peptonoids, and lint.    She was nervous, cataleptic,   And anemic, and dyspeptic:     Though not convinced of apoplexy, yet she had her fears.   She dwelt with force fanatical   Upon a twinge rheumatical,     And said she had a buzzing in her ears!    Now all of this bemoaning   And this grumbling and this groaning     The mind of Jack, her son and heir, unconscionably bored.   His heart completely hardening,   He gave his time to gardening,     For raising beans was something he adored.    [Illustration]    Each hour in accents morbid   This limp maternal bore bid     Her callous son affectionate and lachrymose good-bys.   She never granted Jack a day   Without some long \"Alackaday!\"     Accompanied by rolling of the eyes.    But Jack, no panic showing,   Just watched his beanstalk growing,     And twined with tender fingers the tendrils up the pole.   At all her words funereal   He smiled a smile ethereal,     Or sighed an absent-minded \"Bless my soul!\"    That hollow-hearted creature   Would never change a feature:     No tear bedimmed his eye, however touching was her talk.   She never fussed or flurried him,   The only thing that worried him     Was when no bean-pods grew upon the stalk!    But then he wabbled loosely   His head, and wept profusely,     And, taking out his handkerchief to mop away his tears,   Exclaimed: \"It hasn't got any!\"   He found this blow to botany     Was sadder than were all his mother's fears.     _The Moral_ is that gardeners pine   Whene'er no pods adorn the vine.   Of all sad words experience gleans   The saddest are: \"It _might_ have beans.\"     (I did not make this up myself:     'Twas in a book upon my shelf.     It's witty, but I don't deny     It's rather Whittier than I!)    [Illustration]       _How a Cat Was Annoyed and a Poet Was Booted_     A poet had a cat.   There is nothing odd in that--     (I _might_ make a little pun about the _Mews_!)   But what is really more   Remarkable, she wore     A pair of pointed patent-leather shoes.       And I doubt me greatly whether         E'er you heard the like of that:       Pointed shoes of patent-leather                       On a cat!    [Illustration]    His time he used to pass   Writing sonnets, on the grass--     (I _might_ say something good on _pen_ and _sward_!)   While the cat sat near at hand,   Trying hard to understand     The poems he occasionally roared.       (I myself possess a feline,         But when poetry I roar       He is sure to make a bee-line                       For the door.)    The poet, cent by cent,   All his patrimony spent--     (I _might_ tell how he went from _werse_ to _werse_!)   Till the cat was sure she could,   By advising, do him good     So addressed him in a manner that was terse:       \"We are bound toward the scuppers,         And the time has come to act,       Or we'll both be on our uppers                       For a fact!\"    On her boot she fixed her eye,   But the boot made no reply--     (I _might_ say: \"Couldn't speak to save _its sole_!\")   And the foolish bard, instead   Of responding, only read     A verse that wasn't bad upon the whole:       And it pleased the cat so greatly,         Though she knew not what it meant,       That I'll quote approximately                       How it went:--    \"If I should live to be   The last leaf upon the tree\"--     (I _might_ put in: \"I think I'd just as _leaf_!\")   \"Let them smile, as I do now,   At the old forsaken bough\"--     Well, he'd plagiarized it bodily, in brief!       But that cat of simple breeding         Couldn't read the lines between,       So she took it to a leading                       Magazine.    [Illustration]    She was jarred and very sore   When they showed her to the door.     (I _might_ hit off the _door_ that was _a jar_!)   To the spot she swift returned   Where the poet sighed and yearned,     And she told him that he'd gone a little far.       \"Your performance with this rhyme has         Made me absolutely sick,\"       She remarked. \"I think the time has                       Come to kick!\"    [Illustration]    I could fill up half the page   With descriptions of her rage--     (I _might_ say that she went a bit _too fur_!)   When he smiled and murmured: \"Shoo!\"   \"There is one thing I can do!\"     She answered with a wrathful kind of purr.       \"You may shoo me, and it suit you,         But I feel my conscience bid       Me, as tit for tat, to boot you!\"                       (Which she did.)    [Illustration]     _The Moral_ of the plot   (Though I say it, as should not!)     Is: An editor is difficult to suit.   But again there're other times   When the man who fashions rhymes     Is a rascal, and a bully one to boot!       _How Much Fortunatus Could Do with a Cap_     Fortunatus, a fisherman Dane,   Set out on a sudden for Spain,     Because, runs the story,     He'd met with a hoary         Mysterious sorcerer chap,     Who, trouble to save him,     Most thoughtfully gave him         A magical traveling cap.   I barely believe that the story is true,   But here's what that cap was reported to do.    [Illustration]    Suppose you were sitting at home,   And you wished to see Paris or Rome,     You'd pick up that bonnet,     You'd carefully don it,         The name of the city you'd call,     And the very next minute     By Jove, you were in it,         Without having started at all!   One moment you sauntered on upper Broadway,   And the next on the Corso or rue de la Paix!    [Illustration: _This shows Fortunatus, a restlessness feeling,                  Forsaking his fishing, and leaving his ceiling._]    Why, it beat every journey of Cook's,   Knocked spots out of Baedeker's books!     He stepped from his doorway     Direct into Norway,         He hopped in a trice to Ceylon,     He saw Madagascar,     Went round by Alaska,         And called on a girl in Luzon:   If they said she'd be down in a moment or two,   He took, while he waited, a peek at Peru!    He could wake up at eight in Siam,   Take his tub, if he wanted, in Guam.     Eat breakfast in Kansas,     And lunch in Matanzas,         Go out for a walk in Brazil,     Take tea in Madeira,     Dine on the Riviera,         And smoke his cigar in Seville,   Go out to the theatre in Vladivostok,   And retire in New York at eleven o'clock!    [Illustration]    Every tongue he could readily speak:   French, German, Italian, Greek,     Norwegian, Bulgarian,     Turkish, Bavarian,         Japanese, Hindustanee,     Russian and Mexican!     He was a lexicon,         Such as you seldom will see.   His knowledge linguistic gave Ollendorff fits,   And brought a hot flush to the face of Berlitz!    He would bow in an intimate way   To Menelik and to Loubet,     He was frequently beckoned,     By William the Second,         A word of advice to receive,     He talked with bravado     About the Mikado,         King Oscar, Oom Paul, the Khedive,   King Victor Emmanuel Second, the Shah,   King Edward the Seventh, Kwang Su, and the Czar!    [Illustration]    But what did he get from it all?   His wife used to wait in the hall!     When this wandering mortal     Set foot on the portal,         She always appeared on the scene, "]]]
