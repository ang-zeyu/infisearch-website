For one of them would act so marvelously that she would be able to cast laurels at your feet, while the other would sing you back to fortune.  But as it is, you will just have to put up with poor me until Dick gets his chance.  Now do eat your breakfast while I relate the details of our good luck storm.  In the first place, we are not going to have to give up our beloved house.  At least not yet, and perhaps never if our German-American Pension plan turns out satisfactorily.\"  Betty drank a swallow of coffee, hardly appreciating what she was doing, so deep was her absorption in their affairs.  \"Honestly, mother, I should never have dreamed of being so interested in this plan of Rose's and Miss McMurtry's for us, if it had not been for Dick's letters.  But if German ladies can keep successful pensions, why not Americans?  Remember what a funny lot of people Dick has described--the fat widow with the two musical daughters.  I hope one of them won't set her cap for Dick, he loves music so dearly.  Then you know the young boy student who was nearly starving when Dick rescued him, and the old Baron who wears a wig, and the half dozen others?  But no matter how queer and funny they may be, they can be no more so than our pensioners.  There is Miss McMurtry herself and Anthony Graham, and Dr. Barton moving into town to have an office in our old library.  I wonder sometimes if he and Rose are still friends.  They had a disagreement once out at the cabin and she just speaks to him since.\"  Then Betty Ashton hesitated and devoted herself to finishing her breakfast.  \"I am sure I don't understand why you fail to mention Herr Crippen, child, who is to have a room here with us and teach his pupils in our big drawing room.  I am glad he has been so successful with his music pupils that he is able to give Esther the advantage of studying in New York.  I wish you did not have such a ridiculous prejudice against him. Indeed, my dear, I have a very strong reason for insisting that you be kind to him.  He is Esther's father and----\"  Mrs. Ashton spoke more firmly than was usual with her.  But Betty shrugged her shoulders imperceptibly.  \"Oh, of course I am glad enough to have the Professor here and I have never said I did not like him.  But I am specially happy that Edith Norton's family has moved away so she is to have a room with us.  I am kind of lonely without Polly and Esther, and somehow Edith,\"----Betty broke off abruptly.  Not even to her mother did she feel like mentioning the fact that Edith did not seem to be turning out quite so well as the other Sunrise Camp Fire girls.  With a hurried movement she next picked up the breakfast tray, exclaiming:  \"Thank heavens we are not going to have to give our lodgers anything but their rooms and that Martha is coming back to do our cooking and the cleaning.  Good old soul to offer to do it without pay.  She said that she could not bear living anywhere except with us and that she had enough of father's money stored away in bank not to need any more.  But we could not have had her work without pay.\"  Betty kissed her mother lightly on the forehead.  \"If any one else turns up today and wishes a room, just refer them to me.  I'm afraid I won't leave us a bed to sleep in.  I am getting so anxious to surprise Dick by really earning a lot of money.\"  \"Well, don't rent the back room that Esther used to have, Betty.  You may move into it yourself some day if you like, but I would rather not have a stranger occupy it.  I----\"  \"What on earth is queer about that room?\" Betty interrupted.  \"I have not time to listen now, but you _must_ tell me.  You talk as though it were a kind of Bluebeard's Chamber of Horrors.  Yet I don't suppose you would put me in it if I were likely to have my head cut off in consequence.  Good-bye, dear.\"  And Betty fled out into the hall, realizing that it must be almost school time.  The door of Esther's old room happened by accident to be standing open, and still holding on to her tray, Betty paused before it for a few moments.  She was not thinking of a possible mystery or secret in connection with the room, only wondering if Esther and Polly were to be at home for the Christmas holidays.  They both wanted to come, she thought.  But Esther was not sure of being able to afford it and Polly was uncertain of whether she wished to stay in her stepfather's house at a time when her stepbrother, Frank Wharton, whom she disliked so much, should also be at home for his holidays.  The girl's face was a little wistful.  She so longed to see both her friends.  Without them and without Dick, this first Christmas under such changed conditions at home might be rather trying.  \"Oh!\" Betty exclaimed a trifle indignantly, with her arm shaking so that the dishes in her hands rattled dangerously.  \"What in the world are you doing in the house at this hour, Anthony Graham?  You frightened me nearly to death, turning up at my elbow in such an unexpected fashion.  I thought you had been gone hours!\"  Anthony put down his coal scuttle and took hold of Betty's tray.  \"I have been away, but I came back for a moment because your mother wished me to do something for her as soon as I had the spare time.\"  His tone was so surly that Betty smiled.  Anthony had been brought up with such a different class of people that he was unable to understand sarcasm or pretense of any kind.  Whatever one said he accepted in exactly the words in which it was spoken.  And Betty and her friends had always been accustomed to joking with one another, to saying one thing, often meaning another.  Anthony should have had the sense to realize that she was not really cross, that her indignation was partly assumed. Therefore she did not intend taking the trouble to set him right in the present instance.  \"I'll carry the dishes down myself.  I have plenty of time,\" she protested coldly.  But Anthony only held the more firmly to the tray, with his face crimsoning.  The truth was that he had been appreciating in the past few days a truth of which the girl herself was as yet unconscious.  Betty's manner toward him had noticeably changed.  In the excitement of their Thanksgiving day meeting and his romantic return of the money which she had completely forgotten, she had shown far more interest and friendliness than she now did.  On that occasion Betty had overlooked the young fellow's roughness, his lack of education and family advantages.  Really Anthony had never been taught even the common civilities of life and had to trust to a kind of instinct, even in knowing when to take off his hat, when to shake hands, how to enter or leave a room.  And he understood keenly enough his own limitations. Yet the change in Betty's attitude had hurt him, even though he acknowledged to himself his failure to deserve even her original kindness.  She was still kind enough of course in the things which she thought counted.  She was cordial about his having his room in the house with her mother and herself and most careful of thanking him for any assistance which he rendered them.  Yet the difference was there. For neither in heart nor mind had Betty yet grown big enough to feel real comradeship with a boy so beneath her in social position and opportunities.  Nevertheless she did not mean to be ungracious and something in the carriage of the young man's head as he moved off down the hall suggested that he was either hurt or angry, although exactly why Betty could not understand.  \"Don't go for a second, Anthony,\" she called after him.  \"I wanted to tell you that you are living in a house with a haunted chamber.  At least I don't know whether this room is exactly haunted, but there is something queer about it that my mother and brother have never confided to me.  Perhaps I shall move in and find out for myself what it is.  I will if there is a chance of my friends, Esther Crippen and Polly O'Neill, coming home for the holidays.  For it is so big that we could stay in it together.  And perhaps Mrs. O'Neill will let Polly come here and visit me for a little while.  Both the girls are doing wonderful things in New York City.  And I am afraid if they don't come home pretty soon they will both have outgrown me.  It is so horrid to be a perfectly ordinary person.\"  As Betty moved off, the expression on her companion's face did not suggest that he thought of her as entirely ordinary.     CHAPTER IV  TEMPTATION  \"You are perfectly absurd and I haven't the faintest intention of confiding in any one of you.\"  And Polly O'Neill, with her cheeks flaming, rushed away from a group of girls and into her own bedroom, closing the door and locking it behind her.  This winter at boarding school in New York City had not been in the least what she had anticipated.  Perhaps the character of the school she and her mother had chosen had been unfortunate.  Yet they had selected it with the greatest care and it was expensive beyond Polly's wildest dreams.  For, apart from her own small inheritance, her stepfather, Mr. Wharton, had insisted on being allowed to contribute to her support, and not to appear too ungracious both to her mother and to him, his offer had been accepted.  Yet Polly did not consider herself any greater success in thus masquerading as a rich girl than she had been as a poor one.  Was she never to be satisfied?  Her school companions were all wealthy and few of them had any ideas beyond clothes and society.  To them Polly had seemed a kind of curiosity. She was so impetuous, so brilliant, so full of a thousand moods.  Betty Ashton had once said that to know Polly O'Neill was a liberal education, and yet in order to know her one ought to have had a liberal education beforehand.  Today during the recreation hour at \"Miss Elkins' Finishing School,\" which was Polly's present abode, there had been a sudden discussion of plans for the future.  And Polly, partly because she was in a contradictory mood and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22938"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls in the Outside World (#4)"],["body","because she really wished it to be known, had boldly announced herself as poor as a church mouse with no chance of not starving to death in the future unless she could learn to make her own living.  And this had started the onslaught of questions from which she had just torn herself away.  For Polly had absolutely determined not to confide in any one of her new companions her ambition to go upon the stage.  They would not understand and would only be stupid and inquisitive.  Why, had they not worried her nearly to death simply because of her acquaintance with Miss Margaret Adams?  For one day the great actress had driven up to the school and taken Polly for a drive.  And ever afterwards the other girls were determined to find out how and when she had met her and what she was like in every smallest particular, until Polly was nearly frantic.  Now in her own room, which was a small one, but belonged to her alone, the girl dashed cold water on her face until she began to feel her temper cooling down.  Then with a book in her lap she planted herself in a low chair.  The book was a collection of Camp Fire songs which Sylvia Wharton had given her.  And although Polly could not sing, the poetry and inspiration of them was so lovely that she felt they might be a consoling influence.  Nevertheless Polly did not commence reading at once.  Instead, her thin shoulders drooped forward pathetically, and putting one elbow on her knee she rested her pointed chin in her hand.  For she was unhappy without any real reason in the world.  Polly O'Neill was one of the sensitive and emotional persons who must always be more or less miserable in the wrong environment.  She did not like being at boarding school and yet she did not wish to return to Woodford to live in her stepfather's house in circumstances so different from those of her old life.  Besides, had not Miss Adams advised that she spend several years away from Woodford in order to see more of the outside world and its myriad types of men and women?  She could not ask to be allowed to come back home now, after the fight she had made to leave.  Moreover, she was learning many things that might be useful to her as an actress.  Miss Adams herself had said so.  There was no fault with the opportunities for study at Miss Elkins', only with the interest of the girls.  She herself was working hard at French and German and physical culture and was having some special private teaching in elocution by a master recommended by Miss Adams.  No, Polly did not intend to give up.  Only she was trying to decide whether or not to return to Woodford for the Christmas holidays.  She was longing to see her mother and Mollie and Betty Ashton.  Yet Frank Wharton would be at home and she and Frank had quarreled all the time that they had been in the house together during the past summer.  And her mother and Mollie were so wrapped up in one another and in the splendid new home and in Mr. Wharton!  Polly felt herself almost an outsider when she thought of the days when they had lived in their own little cottage just opposite the Princess.  Then, at the thought of Betty Ashton, the slightly hard look in Polly's Irish blue eyes faded.  Of the Princess' understanding and affection she could always feel sure.  And what a brave fight she was making! Every letter from her mother or Mollie or from any one of their old Camp Fire circle had something admiring to say of her.  And yet she and Mollie had always thought of their Princess as only a spoiled darling, beautiful and meant only for cherishing.  Ah well, the Princess was really an aristocrat in the old meaning of the word.  She had never been in the least like these New York girls, caring for money for its own sake and feeling superior to other people just because of her money.  Betty had birth and beauty and brains.  Suddenly Polly dashed the tears from her eyes and with a smile jumped to her feet, dropping her Camp Fire book.  There was no use sitting there and thinking of all the virtues that her Princess possessed that began with \"b.\"  This was Friday afternoon and she was free to do what she liked.  Esther was living in a boarding house not far away, and she had not seen her in two weeks.  And in all the world there was nothing Esther liked to talk about so much as Betty.  Besides, if Esther were going home for the holidays, why, Polly felt that she would rather like to have some one persuade her into making her own decision.  Is it good or evil fortune that makes one so readily influenced by outside conditions?  The December afternoon was cold and brilliant; and in few places is the climate of early winter so stimulating as in New York City.  Esther was not at home, and for a few minutes her visitor felt disappointed.  But the streets were so beautiful and alluring and there were so many people out!  It was true that Polly had received permission only to call upon her friend, but what wrong could there be in her taking a walk?  She had only to keep straight along Broadway and there could be no possible chance of getting lost.  Polly was not in the least timid or unable to take care of herself.  She was a girl from a small town, and yet no one could have imagined that she had not been a New Yorker all her life, except for her quick and eager interest in the sights about her.  No one noticed or molested Polly in the least.  It was only that in her usual unthinking fashion she flung herself into the way of temptation. Farther down Broadway than she had ever been before, Polly stopped for a moment to look more closely at a group of girls.  Most of them were several years older than herself.  They were standing close together near a closed door, and yet only occasionally did one of them make a remark to the other; for apparently they were strangers to one another.  At first the girls themselves attracted Polly's attention because the larger number appeared so nervous and anxious.  More than half of them had their faces rouged and powdered and were fashionably dressed, yet even when they smiled their expressions were uneasy.  They interested the country girl immensely.  In order not to seem rude or inquisitive she pretended to wish to gaze into a shop window near them.  Then, as they continued waiting and showed no sign of what they were waiting for, Polly O'Neill's curiosity overcame her good manners. Another girl had separated herself from the group and was standing within two feet of Polly, also pretending to stare into the same window.  Polly edged closer to her.  The young woman must have been nearly twenty-five.  She had been pretty once, yet already her face was haggard and she had circles under her big brown eyes.  Unexpectedly Polly smiled at her, and there was always something almost irresistible in Polly's smile.  \"Could you, would you mind telling me why so many girls are standing here in this one particular spot?\" she inquired.  \"It is a cold day when one is still.  And yet I have been here almost ten minutes and no one has even started to move away.\"  \"We are waiting to try to get jobs,\" the older girl answered listlessly.  \"And we have come sooner than we were told because each one of us hoped to get ahead of the other.\"  \"Jobs?\" Polly repeated stupidly.  \"What kind of work is it that you are looking for?\"  \"Oh, theatrical jobs,\" the young woman explained.  \"It's coming on to be Christmas time and the managers are putting on extras for the holidays.\"  She turned away from her questioner, believing that she had heard a faint noise at the door near which they were lingering.  A quick tug at her coat attracted her attention again.  \"Can any one apply for a position who wants it?\" Polly queried.  Her eyes were shining, her cheeks were crimson and her breath coming in kind of broken gasps as though she were frightened.  But the magic door had opened at last and the older woman had no time to waste.  \"Oh, yes, any one can apply,\" she returned with a kind of hardness.  And then she failed to observe that the girl she had been talking with was following close behind her.  Polly herself hardly realized what she was doing.  Once more she had yielded to that old wretched habit of hers, of acting first and then thinking afterwards.  Like a flash of lightning it had but this instant occurred to her that more than anything she would like to see inside a theatrical manager's office.  It would be like placing the tips of one's toes on the promised land.  Of course, Polly knew perfectly well that she was being reckless, only she would not allow herself time to consider this point of view.  She would simply slip in with these other girls and pretend that she would like a position should she be forced into it.  As she had had no experience, there could be no possibility of her getting an engagement.  Ten minutes afterwards she would slip out again and return to school.  With a dozen or more other girls, Polly was the next moment ushered into a room that was quite dark and had only a few chairs in it.  There they were told to wait until the manager could be free to speak to them.  So Polly crowded herself into the farthest, darkest corner and immediately her heart began to thump and her knees to shake, while she wished herself a thousand miles away.  What would her mother say to this latest of her escapades; and Mollie and Betty?  What would Miss Adams, for that matter, think of her?  She was an actress herself; but of course Polly never imagined that she had started her career in any such humble fashion.  Coming partially to her senses, Polly started hurriedly toward the closed door.  There was no reason in the world for her remaining in this room unless she wished it.  But just as she turned the knob the manager entered from the hall.  And Polly's curiosity got the better of her again.  She would stay just half a minute longer and see what happened.
