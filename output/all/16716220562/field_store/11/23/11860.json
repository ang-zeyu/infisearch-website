I've done my best to fulfil the conditions, but they are not easy.\"  \"Indeed!  How is that?\"  \"Well, you see, my sister is firmly convinced that there is deadly danger in wet feet, and one of her conditions is that Milly is not to be allowed to wet her feet.  Now you know it is not easy for a Londoner to understand the difficulty of keeping one's feet dry while skipping over the mountains and peat-hags of the Western Isles.\"  \"From which I conclude that Mrs Moss is a Londoner,\" returned Barret, with a laugh.  \"She is.  Although a Gordon, and born in the Argyll Highlands, she was sent to school in London, where she was married at the age of seventeen, and has lived there ever since.  Her husband is dead, and nothing that I have been able to say has yet tempted her to pay me a visit.  She regards my home here as a wild, uninhabitable region, though she has never seen it, and besides, is getting too old and feeble to venture, as she says, on a long voyage.  Certes, she is not yet feeble in mind, whatever she may be in body; but she's a good, amiable, affectionate woman, and I have no fault to find with her, except in regard to her severe conditions about Milly, and her anxiety to get her home again. After all, it is not to be wondered at, for Milly is her only child; and I am quite sure if I had not gone to London, and made all sorts of promises to be extremely careful of Milly and personally take her home again, she never would have let her come at all.  See, there is one of Milly's favourite views,\" said the laird, pulling up, and pointing with his whip to the scene in front, where a range of purple hills formed a fine background to the loch, with its foreground of tangle-covered stones; \"she revels in depicting that sort of thing.\"  Barret, after expressing his thorough approval of the young girl's taste in the matter of scenery, asked if Milly's delicate health was the cause of her mother's anxiety.  \"Delicate health!\" exclaimed the laird.  \"Why, man, sylph-like though she appears, she has got the health of an Amazon.  No, no, there's nothing wrong with my niece, save in the imagination of my sister.  We will stop at this cottage for a few minutes.  I want to see one of my men, who is not very well.\"  He pulled up at the door of a little stone hut by the roadside, which possessed only one small window and one chimney, the top of which consisted of an old cask, with the two ends knocked out.  A bare-legged boy ran out of the hut to hold the horse.  \"Is your brother better to-day?\" asked the laird.  \"No, sir; he's jist the same.\"  \"Mind your head,\" said the laird, as he stooped to pass the low doorway, and led his friend into the hut.  The interior consisted of one extremely dirty room, in which the confined air was further vitiated by tobacco smoke, and the fumes of whisky.  One entire side of it was occupied by two box-beds, in one of which lay a brawny, broad-shouldered man, with fiery red hair and scarcely less fiery red eyes, which seemed to glare out of the dark den in which he lay.  \"Well, Ivor, are ye not better to-day, man?\"  There was a sternness in Mr Gordon's query, which not only surprised but grieved his young companion; and the surprise was increased when the sick man replied in a surly tone--  \"Na, laird, I'm not better; an' what's more, I'll not be better till my heed's under the sod.\"  \"I'm afraid you are right, Ivor,\" returned the laird, in a somewhat softer tone; \"for when a man won't help himself, no one else can help him.\"  \"Help myself!\" exclaimed the man, starting up on one elbow, and gazing fiercely from under his shaggy brows.  \"Help myself!\" he repeated.  And then, as if resolving suddenly to say no more, he sank down and laid his head on the pillow, with a short groan.  \"Here, Ivor, is a bottle o' physic that my wife sends to ye,\" said Mr Gordon, pulling a pint bottle from his pocket, and handing it to the man, who clutched it eagerly, and was raising it to his mouth when his visitor arrested his hand.  \"Hoot, man,\" he said, with a short laugh, \"it's not whisky!  She bid me say ye were to take only half a glass at a time, every two hours.\"  \"Poor't oot, then, laird--poor't oot,\" said the man, impatiently. \"Ye'll fin' a glass i' the wundy.\"  Fetching a wine-glass from the window Mr Gordon half filled it with a liquid of a dark brown colour, which the sick man quaffed with almost fierce satisfaction, and then lay down with a sigh.  \"It seems to have done ye good already, man,\" said the laird, putting the bottle and glass on that convenient shelf--the window-sill.  \"I've no idea what the physic is, but my good wife seems to know, and that's enough for me; and for you, too, I think.\"  \"Ay, she's a good wumin.  Thank her for me,\" responded Ivor.  Remounting the dog-cart the old gentleman explained, as they drove along, that Ivor Donaldson's illness was the result of intemperance.  \"He is my gamekeeper,\" said the laird; \"and there is not a better or more trustworthy man in the island, when he is sober; but when he takes one of his drinking fits, he seems to lose all control over himself, and goes from bad to worse, till a fit of _delirium tremens_ almost kills him.  He usually goes for a good while after that without touching a drop, and at such times he is a most respectful, painstaking man, willing to take any amount of trouble to serve one, but when he breaks down he is as bad as ever--nay, even worse.  My wife and I have done what we could for him, and have tried to get him to take the temperance pledge, but hitherto without avail.  My wife has even gone the length of becoming a total abstainer, in order to have more influence over him; but I don't quite see my way to do that myself.\"  \"Then _you_ have not yet done all that you could for the man, though your wife has,\" thought Barret; but he did not venture to say so.  At this point in the conversation they reached a place where the road left the shores of the loch and ascended into the hills.  Being rather steep at its lower end, they alighted and walked; the laird pointing out, as they ascended, features in the landscape which he thought would interest his young guest.  \"Yonder,\" he said, pointing to a wood on the opposite side of the valley, \"yonder is a good piece of cover for deer.  The last time we had a drive there we got three, one o' them a stag with very fine antlers. It was there that a young friend of mine, who was not much accustomed to sporting, shot a red cow in mistake for a deer!  The same friend knocked over five or six of my tame ducks, under the impression that they were wild ones, because he found them among the heather!  Are you fond of sport?\"  \"Not particularly,\" answered Barret; \"that is, I am not personally much of a sportsman, though I have great enjoyment in going out with my sporting friends and watching their proceedings.  My own tastes are rather scientific.  I am a student of natural history--a botanist and geologist--though I lay no claim to extensive knowledge of science.\"  \"Ah! my young friend, then you will find a powerful sympathiser in my niece Milly--that is, when the poor child gets well--for she is half mad on botany.  Although only two weeks have passed since she came to us, she has almost filled her room with specimens of what she calls rare plants.  I sometimes tease her by saying it is fortunate that bracken does not come under that head, else she'd pull it all up and leave no cover for the poor rabbits.  She has also half-filled several huge books with gummed-in specimens innumerable, though I can't see that she does more than write their names below them.\"  \"And that is no small advance in the science, let me tell you,\" returned Barret, who was stirred up to defend his co-scientist.  \"No one can succeed in anything who does not take the first steps, and undergo the drudgery manfully.\"  \"Womanfully, in this case, my friend; but do not imagine that I underrate my little niece.  My remark was to the effect that I do not see that she _does_ more, though I have no manner of doubt that her pretty little head _thinks_ a great deal more.  Now we will get up here, as the road is more level for a bit.  D'you see the group of alders down in the hollow yonder, where the little stream that runs through the valley takes a sudden bend?  There's a deep pool there, where a good many sea-trout congregate.  You shall try it soon--that is, if you care for fishing.\"  \"Oh, yes, I like fishing,\" said Barret.  \"It is a quiet, contemplative kind of sport.\"  \"Contemplative!\" exclaimed the old gentleman with a laugh; \"well, yes, it is, a little.  Sometimes you get down into the bed of the stream with considerable difficulty, and you have to contemplate the banks a long time, occasionally, before deciding as to which precipice is least likely to give you a broken neck.  Yes, it is a contemplative sport.  As to quiet, that depends very much on what your idea of quietude may be. Our burn descends for two or three miles in succession of leaps and bounds.  If the roaring of cataracts is quieting to you, there is no end of it down there.  See, the pool that I speak of is partly visible now, with the waterfall above it.  You see it?\"  \"Yes, I see it.\"  \"We call it Mac's pool,\" continued the laird, driving on, \"because it is a favourite pool of an old school companion of mine, named MacRummle, who is staying with us just now.  He tumbles into it about once a week.\"  \"Is that considered a necessary part of the process of fishing?\" asked Barret.  \"No, it may rather be regarded as an eccentric addition peculiar to MacRummle.  The fact is, that my good friend is rather too old to fish now; but his spirit is still so juvenile, and his sporting instincts are so keen, that he is continually running into dangerous positions and getting into scrapes.  Fortunately he is very punctual in returning to meals; so if he fails"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23377"],["title","The Lively Poll: A Tale of the North Sea (#0)"],["body","Lively Poll, by R.M.

One of the boats is commanded by a man who is called the Admiral of the fleet.  He commands the other boats as to when and where they are to start working with their trawl nets, for if such control were not imposed there would be chaos, with a hundred or more boats crossing each other's paths and consequently entangling their nets.  After a night's fishing the fish are gutted, filleted, and boxed.  A steam vessel approaches, and takes their catches, so that they can be landed at the nearest fishing port, such as Yarmouth and Gorleston, and rushed to London and other great cities, to be fresh on tables the following day.  But there is another type of vessel that trades with the \"Lively Poll\" and other ships of that fishing fleet--the Dutch \"coper\", bringing goods to trade for fish, including tobacco and schnapps, for the Demon Drink is the ruination of many a good man.  That is what this book is really all about, the ruination of some men, and the salvation of others, for even out at sea there are missionaries working to try and save souls.  ________________________________________________________________________ THE LIVELY POLL, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE FLEET.  Manx Bradley was an admiral--\"admiral of the fleet\"--though it must be admitted that his personal appearance did not suggest a position so exalted.  With rough pilot coat and sou'-wester, scarred and tarred hands, easy, rolling gait, and boots from heel to hip, with inch-thick soles, like those of a dramatic buccaneer, he bore as little resemblance to the popular idea of a lace-coated, brass-buttoned, cock-hatted admiral as a sea-urchin bears to a cockle-shell.  Nevertheless Manx was a real admiral--as real as Nelson, and much harder worked.  His fleet of nearly two hundred fishing-smacks lay bobbing about one fine autumn evening on the North Sea.  The vessels cruised round each other, out and in, hither and thither, in all positions, now on this tack, now on that, bowsprits pointing north, south, east, and west, as if without purpose, or engaged in a nautical game of \"touch.\" Nevertheless all eyes were bent earnestly on the admiral's vessel, for it was literally the \"flagship,\" being distinguishable only by a small flag attached to its fore stay.  The fleet was hovering, awaiting orders from the admiral.  A fine smart \"fishing breeze\" was blowing.  The setting sun sparkled on the wave-crests; thin fleecy clouds streaked the sky; everything gave promise of a satisfactory night, and a good haul of fish in the morning.  With the quiet air of an amiable despot Manx nodded his venerable head. Up went the signal, and in a few minutes the fleet was reduced to order. Every smack swept round into position, and, bending over on the same tack, they all rushed like a shoal of startled minnows, away in the same direction--the direction signalled by the admiral.  Another signal from our venerable despot sent between one and two hundred trawl-nets down to the bottom of the sea, nets that were strong enough to haul up tons of fish, and rocks, and wreckage, and rubbish, with fifty-feet beams, like young masts, with iron enough in bands and chains to sink them, and so arranged that the beams were raised a few feet off the ground, thus keeping the mouths of the great nets open, while cables many fathoms in length held the gears to their respective vessels.  So the North Sea Fishermen began the night's work--the _Nancy_, the _Coquette_, the _Rattler_, the _Truant_, the _Faith_, the _Playfellow_, the _Cherub_, and all the rest of them.  Of course, although the breeze was fresh, they went along slowly, because of the ponderous tails that they had to draw.  Do you ask, reader, why all this order? why this despotic admiral, and all this unity of action? why not \"every man for himself\"?  Let me reply by asking you to think for a moment.  Wind blowing in one direction, perhaps you are aware, does not necessarily imply vessels sailing in the same direction.  With variation of courses possible, nearly two hundred tails out astern, and no unity of action, there would arise the certainty of varied and striking incident.  The _Nancy_ would go crashing into the bows of the _Coquette_, the bowsprit of the _Rallier_ would stir up the cabin of the _Truant_, the tail of the _Faith_ would get entangled with that of the _Cherub_, and both might hook on to the tail of the _Playfellow_; in short, the awful result would be wreck and wretchedness on the North Sea, howling despair in the markets of Columbia and Billingsgate, and no fish for breakfast in the great metropolis.  There is reason for most things--specially good reason for the laws that regulate the fisheries of the North Sea, the fleets of which are over twelve in number, and the floating population over twelve thousand men and boys.  For several hours this shoal of vessels, with full sails and twinkling lights, like a moving city on the deep, continued to tug and plunge along over the \"banks\" of the German ocean, to the satisfaction of the fishermen, and the surprise no doubt of the fish.  About midnight the admiral again signalled, by rocket and flares, \"Haul up,\" and immediately, with capstan, bar, and steam, the obedient crews began to coil in their tails.  It is not our intention to trouble the reader with a minute account of this process or the grand result, but, turning to a particular smack, we solicit attention to that.  She is much like the others in size and rig. Her name is the _Lively Poll_.  Stephen Lockley is her skipper, as fine a young fisherman as one could wish to see--tall, handsome, free, hearty, and powerful.  But indeed all deep-sea fishermen possess the last quality.  They would be useless if not physically strong.  Many a Samson and Hercules is to be found in the North Sea fleets.  \"No better nursery or training-school in time of war,\" they say.  That may be true, but it is pleasanter to think of them as a training-school for times of peace.  The night was very dark.  Black clouds overspread the sky, so that no light save the dim rays of a lantern cheered the men as they went tramp, tramp, round the capstan, slowly coiling in the trawl-warp.  Sheets of spray sometimes burst over the side and drenched them, but they cared nothing for that, being pretty well protected by oilskins, sou'-westers, and sea-boots.  Straining and striving, sometimes gaining an inch or two, sometimes a yard or so, while the smack plunged and kicked, the contest seemed like a doubtful one between _vis inertiae_ and the human will.  Two hours and a half it lasted, until the great trawl-beam came to the surface, and was got up on the vessel's side, after which these indomitable men proceeded to claw up the huge net with their fingers, straining and heaving with might and main.  \"Yo, ho!\" cried the skipper, \"heave her in, boys!\"  \"Hoy!\" growled Peter Jay, the mate, giving a tug that should have torn the net to pieces--but didn't!  \"Looks like as if we'd got hold of a lump o' wreck,\" gasped Bob Lumsden, the smack's boy, who was also the smack's cook.  \"No, no, Lumpy,\" remarked David Duffy, who was no respecter of names or persons, \"it ain't a wreck, it's a mermaid.  I've bin told they weigh over six ton when young.  Look out when she comes aboard--she'll bite.\"  \"I do believe it's old Neptune himself,\" said Jim Freeman, another of the \"hands.\"  \"There's his head; an' something like his pitchfork.\"  \"It does feel heavier than I ever knowed it afore,\" remarked Fred Martin.  \"That's all along of your bein' ill, Fred,\" said the mate.  \"It may be so,\" returned Martin, \"for I do feel queer, an' a'most as weak as a baby.  Come heave away!\"  It was indeed a huge mass of wreck entangled with sea-weed which had rendered the net so heavy on that occasion, but there was also a satisfactory mass of fish in the \"cod-end,\" or bag, at the extremity of the net, for, when, by the aid of the winch, this cod-end was finally got inboard, and the cord fastening the bottom of it was untied, fish of all kinds gushed over the wet decks in a living cataract.  There were a few expressions of satisfaction from the men, but not much conversation, for heavy work had still to be done--done, too, in the dark.  Turbot, sole, cod, skate, and all the other treasures of the deep, had to be then and there gutted, cleaned, and packed in square boxes called \"trunks,\" so as to be ready for the steam-carrier next morning.  The net also had to be cleared and let down for another catch before daybreak.  Now it is just possible that it may never have occurred to the reader to consider how difficult, not to say dangerous, must be the operation of gutting, cleaning, and packing fish on a dark night with a smack dancing a North Sea hornpipe under one's feet.  Among the dangers are two which merit notice.  The one is the fisherman's liability, while working among the \"ruck,\" to run a sharp fish-bone into his hand, the other to gash himself with his knife while attempting to operate on the tail of a skate.  Either accident may be slight or it may be severe.  A sudden exclamation from one of the men while employed in this cleaning and packing work told that something had happened.  \"There goes Martin,\" growled Joe Stubley; \"you can always tell when it's him, 'cause he don't curse an' swear.\"  Stubley--or Stubby, as his mates called him--did not intend this for a compliment by any means, though it may sound like one.  Being an irreligious as well as a stupid man, he held that all who professed religion were hypocritical and silly.  Manliness, in poor Jo's mind, consisted of swagger, quiet insolence, cool cursing, and general godlessness.  With the exception of Fred Martin, the rest of the crew of the _Lively Poll_ resembled him in his irreligion, but they were very different"]]]
