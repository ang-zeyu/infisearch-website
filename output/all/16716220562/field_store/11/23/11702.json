He was not going to undergo the trouble of a fly, until the necessity arose for so doing; and, as it was, he seemed to be satisfied that that necessity had not yet arrived.  The swim cost him much less muscular exertion than flying would have done, and he judged that the current, here very swift, would carry him out of reach of his pursuers.  It soon began to appear that he judged rightly; and the voyageurs, to their chagrin, saw that, instead of gaining upon him, as they had expected, every moment widened the distance between him and the canoe. The bird had an advantage over his pursuers.  Three distinct powers propelled him, while they had only two to rely upon.  He had the current in his favour--so had they.  He had oars or paddles--his feet; they had oars as well.  He \"carried sail,\" while they spread not a \"rag.\"  The wind chanced to blow directly down-stream, and the broad wings of the bird, held out from his body, and half extended, caught the very pith of the breeze on their double concave surfaces, and carried him through the water with the velocity of an arrow.  Do you think that he was not aware of this advantage when he started in the race?  Do you suppose that these birds do not _think_?  I for one am satisfied they do, and look upon every one who prates about the _instinct_ of these creatures as a philosopher of a very old school indeed.  Not only does the great swan think, but so does your parrot, and your piping bullfinch, and the little canary that hops on your thumb.  All think, and _reason_, and _judge_.  Should it ever be your fortune to witness the performance of those marvellous birds, exhibited by the graceful Mademoiselle Vandermeersch in the fashionable _salons_ of Paris and London, you will agree with me in the belief that the smallest of them has a mind like yourself.  Most certainly the swan, which our voyageurs were pursuing, thought, and reasoned, and judged, and calculated his distance, and resolved to keep on \"the even tenor of his way,\" without putting himself to extra trouble by beating the air with his wings, and lifting his heavy body--thirty pounds at least--up into the heavens.  His judgment proved sound; for, in less than ten minutes from the commencement of the chase, he had gained a clear hundred yards upon his pursuers, and continued to widen the distance.  At intervals he raised his beak higher than usual, and uttered his loud booming note, which fell upon the ears of the voyageurs as though it had been sent back in mockery and defiance.  They would have given up the pursuit, had they not noticed that a few hundred yards farther down the river made a sharp turn to the right. The swan, on reaching this, would no longer have the wind in his favour. This inspired them with fresh hopes.  They thought they would be able to overtake him after passing the bend, and then, either get a shot at him, or force him into the air.  The latter was the more likely; and, although it would be no great gratification to see him fly off, yet they had become so interested in this singular chase that they desired to terminate it by putting the trumpeter to some trouble.  They bent, therefore, with fresh energy to their oars, and pulled onward in the pursuit.  First the swan, and after him the canoe, swung round the bend, and entered the new \"reach\" of the river.  The voyageurs at once perceived that the bird now swam more slowly.  He no longer \"carried sail,\" as the wind was no longer in his favour.  His wings lay closely folded to his body, and he moved only by the aid of his webbed feet and the current, which last happened to be sluggish, as the river at this part spread over a wide expanse of level land.  The canoe was evidently catching up, and each stroke was bringing the pursuers nearer to the pursued.  After a few minutes' brisk pulling, the trumpeter had lost so much ground that he was not two hundred yards in the advance, and \"dead ahead.\"  His body was no longer carried with the same gracefulness, and the majestic curving of his neck had disappeared.  His bill protruded forward, and his thighs began to drag the water in his wake.  He was evidently on the threshold of flight.  Both Francois and Basil saw this, as they stood with their guns crossed and ready.  At this moment a shrill cry sounded over the water.  It was the scream of some wild creature, ending in a strange laugh, like the laugh of a maniac!  On both sides of the river there was a thick forest of tall trees of the cotton-wood species (_Populus angustifolia_).  From this forest the strange cry had proceeded, and from the right bank.  Its echoes had hardly ceased, when it was answered by a similar cry from the trees upon the left.  So like were the two, that it seemed as if some one of God's wild creatures was mocking another.  These cries were hideous enough to frighten any one not used to them.  They had not that effect upon our voyageurs, who knew their import.  One and all of them were familiar with the voice of the _white-headed eagle_!  The trumpeter knew it as well as any of them, but on him it produced a far different effect.  His terror was apparent, and his intention was all at once changed.  Instead of rising into the air, as he had premeditated, he suddenly lowered his head, and disappeared under the water!  Again was heard the wild scream and the maniac laugh; and the next moment an eagle swept out from the timber, and, after a few strokes of its broad wing, poised itself over the spot where the trumpeter had gone down.  The other, its mate, was seen crossing at the same time from the opposite side.  Presently the swan rose to the surface, but his head was hardly out of the water when the eagle once more uttered its wild note, and, half folding its wings, darted down from above.  The swan seemed to have expected this, for before the eagle could reach the surface, he had gone under a second time, and the latter, though passing with the velocity of an arrow, plunged his talons in the water to no purpose.  With a cry of disappointment the eagle mounted back into the air, and commenced wheeling in circles over the spot.  It was now joined by its mate, and both kept round and round watching for the reappearance of their intended victim.  Again the swan came to the surface, but before either of the eagles could swoop upon him he had for the third time disappeared.  The swan is but an indifferent diver; but under such circumstances he was likely to do his best at it.  But what could it avail him?  He must soon rise to the surface to take breath--each time at shorter intervals.  He would soon become fatigued and unable to dive with sufficient celerity, and then his cruel enemies would be down upon him with their terrible talons.  Such is the usual result, unless the swan takes to the air, which he sometimes does.  In the present case he had built his hopes upon a different means of escape.  He contemplated being able to conceal himself in a heavy sedge of bulrushes (_Scirpus lacustris_) that grew along the edge of the river, and towards these he was evidently directing his course under the water.  At each emersion he appeared some yards nearer them, until at length he rose within a few feet of their margin, and diving again was seen no more!  He had crept in among the sedge, and no doubt was lying with only his head, or part of it, above the water, his body concealed by the broad leaves of the _nymphae_, while the head itself could not be distinguished among the white flowers that lay thickly along the surface.  The eagles now wheeled over the sedge, flapping the tops of the bulrushes with their broad wings, and screaming with disappointed rage.  Keen as were their eyes they could not discover the hiding-place of their victim.  No doubt they would have searched for it a long while, but the canoe--which they now appeared to notice for the first time--had floated near; and, becoming aware of their own danger, both mounted into the air again, and with a farewell scream flew off, and alighted at some distance down the river.  \"A swan for supper!\" shouted Francois, as he poised his gun for the expected shot.  The canoe was headed for the bulrushes near the point where the trumpeter had been last seen; and a few strokes of the paddles brought the little craft with a whizzing sound among the sedge.  But the culms of the rushes were so tall, and grew so closely together, that the canoemen, after entering, found to their chagrin they could not see six feet around them.  They dared not stand up, for this is exceedingly dangerous in a birch canoe, where the greatest caution is necessary to keep the vessel from careening over.  Moreover, the sedge was so thick, that it was with difficulty they could use their oars.  They remained stationary for a time, surrounded by a wall of green bulrush.  They soon perceived that that would never do, and resolved to push back into the open water.  Meanwhile Marengo had been sent into the sedge, and was now heard plunging and sweltering about in search of the game.  Marengo was not much of a water-dog by nature, but he had been trained to almost every kind of hunting, and his experience among the swamps of Louisiana had long since relieved him of all dread for the water.  His masters therefore had no fear but that Marengo would \"put up\" the trumpeter.  Marengo had been let loose a little too soon.  Before the canoe could be cleared of the entangling sedge, the dog was heard to utter one of his loud growls, then followed a heavy plunge, there was a confused fluttering of wings, and the great white bird rose majestically into the air!  Before either of the gunners could direct their aim, he was beyond the range of shot, and both prudently reserved their fire.  Marengo having performed his part, swam back to the canoe, and was lifted over the gunwale.  The swan, after clearing the sedge, rose almost vertically into the air.  These birds usually"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23129"],["title","The Young Voyageurs: Boy Hunters in the North (#5)"],["body","at a great elevation--sometimes entirely beyond the reach of sight.  Unlike the wild geese and ducks, they never alight upon land, but always upon the bosom of the water.  It was evidently the intention of this one to go far from the scene of his late dangers, perhaps to the great Lake Winnipeg itself.  After attaining a height of several hundred yards, he flew forward in a horizontal course, and followed the direction of the stream.  His flight was now regular, and his trumpet-note could be heard at intervals, as, with outstretched neck, he glided along the heavens.  He seemed to feel the pleasant sensations that every creature has after an escape from danger, and no doubt he fancied himself secure.  But in this fancy he deceived himself.  Better for him had he risen a few hundred yards higher, or else had uttered his self-gratulation in a more subdued tone; for it was heard and answered, and that response was the maniac laugh of the white-headed eagle.  At the same instant two of these birds--those already introduced--were seen mounting into the air.  They did not fly up vertically, as the swan had done, but in spiral curves, wheeling and crossing each other as they ascended.  They were making for a point that would intersect the flight of the swan should he keep on in his horizontal course.  This, however, he did not do.  With an eye as quick as theirs, he saw that he was \"headed;\" and, stretching his long neck upward, he again pursued an almost vertical line.  But he had to carry thirty pounds of flesh and bones, while the largest of the eagles--the female bird--with a still broader spread of wing, was a \"light weight\" of only seven.  The result of this difference was soon apparent.  Before the trumpeter had got two hundred yards higher, the female of the eagles was seen wheeling around him on the same level.  The swan was now observed to double, fly downward, and then upward again, while his mournful note echoed back to the earth.  But his efforts were in vain. After a series of contortions and manoeuvres, the eagle darted forward, with a quick toss threw herself back downward, and, striking upward, planted her talons in the under part of the wing of her victim.  The lacerated shaft fell uselessly down; and the great white bird, no longer capable of flight, came whistling through the air.  But it was not allowed to drop directly to the earth; it would have fallen on the bosom of the broad river, and that the eagles did not wish, as it would have given them some trouble to get the heavy carcass ashore.  As soon as the male--who was lower in the air--saw that his partner had struck the bird, he discontinued his upward flight, and, poising himself on his spread tail, waited its descent.  A single instant was sufficient.  The white object passed him still fluttering; but the moment it was below his level he shot after it like an arrow, and, clutching it in his talons, with an outward stroke sent it whizzing in a diagonal direction. The next moment a crashing was heard among the twigs, and a dull sound announced that the swan had fallen upon the earth.  The eagles were now seen sailing downward, and soon disappeared among the tops of the trees.  The canoe soon reached the bank; and Francois, accompanied by Basil and Marengo, leaped ashore, and went in search of the birds.  They found the swan quite dead and lying upon its back as the eagles had turned it. Its breast was torn open, and the crimson blood, with which they had been gorging themselves, was spread in broad flakes over its snowy plumage.  The eagles themselves, scared by the dog Marengo, had taken flight before the boys could get within shot of them.  As it was just the hour for a \"noon halt\" and a luncheon, the swan was carried to the bank of the river, where a crackling fire was soon kindled to roast him; and while this operation was going on the \"naturalist\" was requested by his companions to give them an account of the \"swans of America.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  THE SWANS OF AMERICA.  \"Very well, then,\" said Lucien, agreeing to the request.  \"I shall tell you all I know of the swans; and, indeed, that is not much, as the natural history of these birds in their wild state is but little understood.  On account of their shy habits, there is not much opportunity of observing them; and as they annually migrate and breed in those desolate regions within the Arctic circle, where civilised men do not live, but little information has been collected about them.  Some of the species, however, breed in the temperate zones, and the habits of these are better known.  \"For a long time it was fancied there was but one species of swan.  It is now known that there are several, distinguished from each other in form, colour, voice, and habits.  `White as a swan,' is a simile as old, perhaps; as language itself.  This, I fancy, would sound strangely to the ears of a native Australian, who is accustomed to look upon swans as being of the very opposite colour, for the black swan is a native of that country.  \"According to the naturalist Brehm, who has given much attention to this subject, there are four distinct species of swans in Europe.  They are all white, though some of the species have a reddish orange tinge about the head and neck.  Two of them are `gibbous,' that is, with a knob or protuberance upon the upper part of the bill.  One of these Brehm terms the `white-headed gibbous swan' (_Cygnus gibbus_).  The other is the `yellow-headed' (_Cygnus olor_); and this last also is known as the _mute_ or _tame_ swan, because it is that species most commonly seen in a tame state upon the ornamental lakes and ponds of England.  The other two European species Brehm has designated `singing swans,' as both of them utter a note that may be heard to a considerable distance.  \"The black swan of Australia (_Cygnus niger_) has been naturalised in Europe, and breeds freely in England, where, from its great size and peculiar markings, it is one of the most ornamental of water-fowls.  It is, moreover, a great tyrant, and will not permit other birds to approach its haunt, but drives them off, striking them furiously with its strong broad wings.  \"Until a late period the swans of America were supposed to be all of one kind.  This is not the case.  There are now known to be three distinct species inhabiting the fur countries, and migrating annually to the South.  That which is best known is the `whistler,' or `hooper' (_Cygnus Americanus_), because it is the species that abounds in the old States upon the Atlantic, and was therefore more observed by naturalists.  It is believed to be identical with one of the European `singing' swans (_Cygnus ferus_), but this is not certain; and for my part, I believe they are different, as the eggs of the American swan are greenish, while those of its European congener are brownish, with white blotches.  \"The `hooper' is four and a half feet in length, though there are males still larger, some of them measuring five feet.  Its colour is white, except upon the head and back part of the neck, where there is a coppery tinge.  The bill and feet are black.  From the angle of the mouth to the eye there is a small naked `cere,' of a bright yellow colour.  These swans, like others of the genus, do not care much for the salt water. They are rarely seen upon the sea, except near its shores, where they may find the aquatic plants upon which they feed.  Nor do they go out upon the large lakes.  When found upon these, it is generally close in to the land.  This is accounted for by the fact that the swans do not `dive' for their food, but stretch down for it with their long necks, which Nature has peculiarly adapted to this very purpose.  Their favourite food consists of the roots of aquatic plants, which are often farinaceous.  As these grow best in the shallow small lakes and along the margins of rivers, such places are the usual resort of the swans. Although their diet is a vegetable one, it is not exclusively so, as they will eat frogs, worms, and small fish.  Unlike the ducks and geese, they rarely feed upon land, but while floating upon the surface of the water.  They walk but awkwardly on land, and are at home only on water or in the air.  In the air they are quite at home, and fly so swiftly that it is no easy matter to shoot them, especially when going before the wind.  At such times they are supposed to fly at the rate of one hundred miles an hour.  When moulting, and unable to rise into the air, it is no easy matter to follow them even with a canoe.  By means of their broad feet and strong wings, they can flutter so quickly over the water, now and then diving, that the hunter cannot overtake them in his boat, but is obliged to use his gun in the pursuit.  \"The `hoopers' are migratory,--that is, they pass to the north every spring, and southward again in the autumn.  Why they make these annual migrations, remains one of the mysteries of nature.  Some believe they migrate to the north, because they there find those desolate uninhabited regions where they can bring forth their young in security.  But this explanation cannot be the true one, as there are also uninhabited regions in the south, even under the equator, where they may be equally free from the presence of man.  Another explanation might be offered. In hot and tropical countries most of the small lakes and swamps, where these birds love to dwell, dry up during the summer months: hence the necessity of a migration to colder and moister regions.  But this would only hold good of the wading and water birds; it would not account for the migration of the many other birds of passage.  \"A better explanation may be this: The north and the cold zones are the natural habitat of most migratory birds.  It is there that they bring forth their young, and there they are at home.  In tropical regions they are only sojourners for a season, forced thither, some of them, by a cold which they do not relish; but"]]]
