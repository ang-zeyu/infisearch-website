But because of a certain thrilling excitement she felt that she must have wings and because of a heavy weight inside her that she must be in the depth of the sea.  For Polly had just signed an engagement to act for two weeks in a Christmas pantomime.  It sounds incredible.  And it was possibly as unwise and headstrong a thing as a girl could well do.  And yet Polly had originally no actual intention or desire to do wrong.  Simply she had yielded to a sudden impulse, to an intense curiosity.  But now things were different; for Polly was realizing her wilfulness completely, and instead of repenting and turning back to confess her folly, was every moment trying to plan by what method her purpose could be accomplished.  Not for anything in the world would her mother give her consent to her experiment.  And that in itself should have been a sufficient argument against it.  Yet Polly explained to herself that, after all, there could not be any great harm in doing what she so much wished, provided that she made confession afterwards.  She was almost eighteen, and thousands of girls in New York City were earning their living, who were years younger than she.  Perhaps it might even do her good to find out what this stage life really was like--whether it was as fascinating as she dreamed, or all tinsel as most grown people were so fond of telling her.  No, the question that was uppermost with Polly O'Neill was not in connection with her decision.  It was how her decision might best be carried out.  Fortunately she had been writing that she did not believe that she would come home for the Christmas holidays.  She did wish to see her mother and Mollie and Betty, of course, and had almost given way to this longing only an hour before.  But now, had not fate itself intervened, flinging her into the path of her desire?  And Polly was Irish and had always declared that she believed in the leadings of fate, even when her mother and sister had insisted that fate and her own wish were too often confused in her mind.  Had she not hidden herself in the corner when the theatrical manager entered the room, with every intention of running away as soon as she could escape unobserved?  And then had he not suddenly swooped down upon her, selecting her from the dozens of other applicants?  Polly was not exactly sure of what had happened, except that the man had said that she looked the part of the character he was after.  The fact that she had confessed having had no stage experience had not even deterred him.  The new play was to be chiefly for young people and the manager particularly required youthful actors and actresses.  The play to be produced was the dramatization of a wonderful old Bohemian fairy story, which Polly remembered to have read years before, called \"The Castle of Life.\"  The story is that of a little boy, Grazioso, brought up by his grandmother, whom he loves better than all else in the world.  Then one day he sees that the grandmother is growing old and fears that she must soon leave him.  And so he sets out to find \"The Castle of Life\" in order once more to bring back youth to the old woman.  The play follows his adventures on the road to the castle, and includes his meeting with two fairies--the Fairy of the Woods and the Fairy of the Water.  Polly was to impersonate the wood spirit.  Her appearance did suggest the character, though naturally she could not appreciate this fact.  But there was always something a bit eerie and fantastic about her, something not exactly of the everyday world--her high cheekbones and thin, emotional face with its scarlet lips and intense expression faintly foreshadowing an unusual future.  But Polly at the present moment was not feeling in the least unusual, only rather more self-willed and more calculating.  Never could she recall having deliberately deceived any one before in her entire life. And yet to accomplish her present purpose there was no other way than the way of deception.  No one in Woodford must guess at her reason for remaining in New York during the holidays, nor must Miss Elkins have any possible cause for suspicion.  Of course she could not stay on at boarding school.  That idea was utterly ridiculous.  She would never be allowed to go out for a single evening alone.  Already her right to liberty had been considerably overreached by this walk of hers down town.  And what she had done during the walk!  The offender smiled rather wickedly at the thought of the consternation and excitement that the discovery of her act would create.  Home she would go to Woodford then to stay indefinitely!  But Polly did not mean to be found out, She meant to have her little taste of emancipation and then go back into routine again, until she was old enough for a larger freedom.  So for this reason, although she should have returned to school an hour before, she continued walking slowly, devising and rejecting a dozen plans.  It was going to be tremendously difficult to accomplish her purpose.  But this she had foreseen five minutes after she had promised to accept the theatrical manager's offer.  However she would \"find a way.\"  She remembered how often the Princess had said that she had more talent than \"Sentimental Tommy\" in this particular direction.  She reached Miss Elkins' school and received five minutes' scolding from that lady, in the meekest spirit, still without having any idea of what she could possibly do to accomplish her design.  All evening she talked so little and her attention was so concentrated upon the lesson which she appeared to be studying, that her school companions left her entirely alone.  Polly's passion for studying had always been regarded as an eccentricity.  But now since she had announced on that afternoon that she had her own living to make there was possibly some excuse for her industry.  Nevertheless the girls felt more convinced than ever that she was not in the least like any of the rest of them and, although rather fascinating and unusual, not a person whom one would care to know intimately.  The difference in her manner and expression that night attracted the attention of one of the teachers--the girl's face was so tense and white, her blue eyes showed such dark shadows beneath them.  It was owing to this teacher's advice that Polly was allowed to leave the study hall an hour earlier than usual and go to her own room and to bed.  She was not feeling particularly well.  Her head did ache and her conscience troubled her the least little bit, notwithstanding she had not the faintest intention of surrender.  With hot cheeks and cold hands she lay still for a long time until the noises of the other girls retiring had quieted down and the big house was silent.  Then Polly suddenly sat up in bed.  A moment later she had crawled out on the floor and lighted a candle by her writing desk.  The electric lights had been turned off for the night.  But even in the pitch darkness Polly would still have composed her letter.  For an idea had at last come to her.  And if only she could get just one person to accede to it her way would be plain.  The one person might be difficult.  Polly was perfectly aware of this, but then she had great faith in her own powers of persuasion.     CHAPTER VI  ESTHER'S ROOM  Just above the small alcohol lamp the teakettle was beginning to sing. On a table near-by were teacups and saucers, with one plate of sandwiches covered over with a small napkin, and another of cookies.  Several times a tall girl glanced at the clock and then walked across the room to take the kettle off the stove, only to place it back again the next instant.  Then at last she seated herself by an open piano.  There was very little furniture in the room except the piano, a small cot and the table.  Yet it had an atmosphere of home and comfort, such as some persons are able to give to a tent in a desert.  And standing in a row at the back of the same tea table were three candles in ten-cent-store glass candlesticks, waiting to be lighted.  The afternoon was a dismal one, with occasional flurries of snow; so that when the proper time came for the candle-lighting, the flames would not be ungrateful.  But in order to make the waiting seem less long the girl was evidently trying to distract her attention by practicing her music.  Several times she sang over the scales.  And then, dissatisfied with her own work, repeated them until finally her voice rose with unusual resonance and power.  Then, after another slight pause, she drifted almost unconsciously into the words of a song:    \"Burn, fire, burn!   Flicker, flicker, flame!   Whose hand above this blaze is lifted   Shall be with magic touch engifted,   To warm the hearts of lonely mortals   Who stand without their open portals.   The torch shall draw them to the fire   Higher, higher   By desire.   Whoso shall stand by this hearthstone,   Flame-fanned,   Shall never, never stand alone;   Whose house is dark and bare and cold,   Whose house is cold,   This is his own.   Flicker, flicker, flicker, flame;   Burn, fire burn!\"   She had not heard the door open softly nor even noticed the figure that crept softly into the small room.  But now a pair of gloved hands were clasped eagerly together and an enthusiastic voice said:  \"Esther Crippen, that is the loveliest song in all the world and you are the loveliest singer of it!  How glad I am to have arrived at just this moment!  Why, your little room makes me feel that it is a _real_ refuge from all that is dark and bare and cold.  And you surely are with the 'magic touch engifted to warm the hearts of lonely mortals' with that beautiful voice of yours.\"  And Polly O'Neill, putting one hand on each of Esther's cheeks, kissed her with unexpected ardor.  It made Esther flush and tremble slightly as she rose to greet her long-desired guest.  Any compliment made Esther shy and one from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22938"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls in the Outside World (#6)"],["body","more than from another person.  For although each girl admired the other's talents and character, they had never understood each other especially well.  Esther always seemed to Polly far too sober and almost too unselfish and self-effacing, while Polly to the quieter girl had all the brilliance and unreliability of a will-o'-the-wisp.  Before coming to New York for the winter their intimacy had been due largely to their mutual devotion to Betty; but now, both lonely and both in a new environment, they had been greatly drawn together.  Polly's occasional visits had been one of Esther's few sources of pleasure outside her work.  \"How charming you are looking, Polly,\" Esther began, taking off her guest's dark coat and hat, and seeing her emerge in a crimson woolen dress, which made a bright spot of color in the shabby room.  Polly, you must remember, was only pretty on occasions; but this afternoon was certainly one of her good-looking days.  The cold had made her pale cheeks flame and given a softer glow to her eyes.  \"I am simply ravenous, Esther, and dying for your delicious tea,\" Polly next remarked, following her hostess to the tea table and taking her seat, while Esther poured out the boiling water.  \"It is a kind of a homesick day and I have been wishing that we were going to have a meeting of our old Sunrise Hill Camp Fire circle.  What wouldn't you give for a glimpse of the Princess this afternoon?\"  Esther's lips twitched as she lighted her three candles.  \"Almost anything I possess,\" she returned.  \"But you are going to see her pretty soon?  You are going back to Woodford for Christmas?\"  Polly tried to hide her own nervousness in putting this simple question.  With her eyes shining over the edge of her cup she continued slowly drinking her tea, so that the rest of her face could not be seen.  But Esther was not paying her any special attention.  Quietly she shook her head.  \"No, Polly, I am not going home.  I am so sorry, for I wanted to dreadfully.  But my music lessons are so expensive that father does not feel he can afford to let me come.  I haven't yet had the courage to write and break the news to the Princess.  She is fond of me, don't you think so, Polly?  She will be sorry that I can't be with her for the holidays?  Of course I know she does not care for me as she does for you.  I shall never expect that.  But it does mean so much to me to feel sure of her affection.\"  Polly frowned in a slightly puzzled fashion.  Esther's adoration even of her beloved Betty seemed a little unnatural.  Why should one girl care so much about the attitude of another one?  She loved Betty herself, of course, and Betty loved her.  Yet she doubted very much if either one worried over the emotions of the other.  \"Oh, yes, Esther,\" Polly returned a trifle impatiently.  \"Of course Betty is devoted to you.  Why shouldn't she be?  Really, I do think you would let her almost trample upon you if she liked.  Only Betty never would like to hurt any one, thank heaven!  But I am glad to hear you are not going home for the Christmas holidays, because I am not going either.\"  There was nothing so remarkable in this statement that it should make Polly turn white and then red again.  But fortunately the three Camp Fire candles, \"Work, Health and Love,\" were now flickering so that the elder girl could not get a clear vision of the other's face.  But instead of appearing pleased over this news Esther seemed disappointed.  \"I am so sorry, for Betty's sake,\" she returned.  \"She wouldn't mind my not being with her so much if she only might have you.\"  Polly shrugged her thin shoulders in a fashion she had when vexed.  \"O Esther, I think you might have been polite enough to say that you would be glad to have me in town if you were to be here--particularly when I came to ask you if I might spend the holidays with you.\"  \"Spend the holidays with me?\" Esther repeated in rather a stupid fashion.  Naturally she was puzzled as to just why a girl in Polly's position should elect to spend her Christmas vacation in a cheap New York boarding house with another girl for whom she had no special sentiment.  \"Why in the world do you want to remain in the city with me?\" she asked again, too honest to pretend that pleasure was her first sentiment until she got a more definite understanding of the situation.  But Polly was now making no effort to devote her attention either to eating or drinking.  Instead she had rested both elbows on the table and was looking at her companion with the half-pleading, half-commanding expression that both Mollie and Betty knew so well.  \"Promise not to say anything until I have finished?\" she began coaxingly.  \"For you see it is to explain why I want to stay with you that made me write to ask you to make this engagement with me for this afternoon.\"     CHAPTER VII  THE THREAT  \"Then you refuse to help me or to keep my secret?\" Polly O'Neill protested indignantly.  \"Really, Esther, I never knew any one with such a gift for considering herself her sister's keeper.  We belong to the same Camp Fire Club.  And if that means anything I thought it was loyalty and service toward one another.    \"'As fagots are brought from the forest     Firmly held by the sinews which bind them,   So cleave to these others, your sisters,     Wherever, whenever you find them.'\"   Esther had walked across the room and had her back turned during this recitation.  But now she moved around, facing her visitor until it was Polly's eyes that dropped before her own.  The older girl had always the dignity that comes from truth and sincerity.  \"Don't be absurd, Polly,\" she said, speaking quietly, but with no lack of decision.  \"You know as well as I do that loyalty has nothing to do with aiding one another to do what one does not believe to be right.  I don't want to preach.  Yet don't you think perhaps _you_ are breaking a part of our Camp Fire law?  'Be Trustworthy.  This law teaches us not to undertake enterprises rashly.'\"  \"Oh, please hush, Esther,\"  Polly insisted.  \"There is no use in our quarreling, and we are sure to if you go on preaching like that.  I told you what I have made up my mind to do.  If you don't wish to help me, that of course is your affair.  All I have the right to demand is, that what I told you in the strictest confidence you repeat to no one else.\"  She picked up her coat and began slowly buttoning it, waiting for Esther's reply, which did not come at once.  \"I don't know whether I can promise you even that,\" the older girl answered finally.  Her face was white and she moved her hands in the old nervous fashion that Betty had almost broken her of.  \"I don't suppose you can understand, Polly, what an almost dangerous thing you are about to undertake.  And without your mother knowing it!  O Polly, please don't!  Why, if anything should happen to you what would she say to me or Molly and Betty, if knowing your intention I did not warn them?\"  Polly was like a hot flame in her anger.  In her life Esther scarcely remembered ever having seen any one in such intense yet quiet passion. All the blue seemed to have gone out of her visitor's eyes until they were almost black.  Her lips were drawn and although she tried to control her voice, it quivered like a too-tightly-drawn violin string.  \"Esther,\" she said, \"I shall not leave this room until I have your solemn promise.  Perhaps you don't know anything about the standards of conduct between people of birth and breeding.  You were brought up in an orphan asylum and had no mother.  Whether you disapprove of me or not makes no difference.  I am not objecting to your disapproval.  I can perfectly understand that.  But what I absolutely will not endure is for you to tell my secret because it happens to strike your conscience that that is the right thing to do.  My secret belongs to me as absolutely as my clothes or any of my other possessions do.  And because you chance not to approve of it or of them is no reason why you should steal them from me and give them away to other people.\"  Again Esther was silent and her eyes filled with tears.  What was the use of arguing with Polly when she was in this mood?  Yet there were so many things that she could honestly say.  And one of them, that if she had had the good fortune to have a mother, she at least would not have tried to deceive her as Polly was doing.  However Esther was not sure that the latter part of her companion's argument was not true.  Had she the right to betray Polly's confidence, even though she might consider it for her good?  For Polly had begun her revelation by insisting that what she told be kept in the strictest secrecy, and she had listened with that understanding.  Unfortunately Esther's failure to reply did not strike her visitor as indicating a change in her point of view.  Polly flung herself angrily down into a chair, as though intent upon beginning a siege.  She was trying in a measure to control her temper, realizing how ashamed she usually felt after the flare of it was past.  Still she did honorably consider that Esther's attitude in the present situation was the wrong one.  Perhaps she was being disobedient, wilful, wicked even.  Yet she had made up her mind to take the consequences (at least the consequences that she was now able to foresee).  And she had no idea of being frustrated in her purpose by an outside person, whose assistance she had been foolish enough to ask.  No, some way must be devised that would force Esther into silence.  Polly glanced desperately about the small room.  There was a big photograph of the Princess, smiling at her from the wall, the Princess at her loveliest, with her exquisitely refined features, her delicate, high-bred air.  She turned away from it rather quickly to look again at her companion.  Goodness, what a contrast there still was between the two girls!  They had believed that Esther was improving a little in her appearance.  Yet just now worry and uncertainty"]]]
