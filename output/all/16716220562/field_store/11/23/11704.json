He had hunted deer in the same manner; he had shot, he said, hundreds of these animals upon the banks of rivers, where they had come down to the water to drink, and stood gazing at the light.  His cousins could well credit his statements.  They themselves had hunted deer by torchlight in the woods of Louisiana, where it is termed \"fire-hunting.\"  They had killed several in this way.  The creatures, as if held by some fascination, would stand with head erect looking at the torch carried by one of the party, while the other took sight between their glancing eyes and fired the deadly bullet.  Remembering this, they could easily believe that the swans might act in a similar manner.  It was not long until they were convinced of it by actual experience. As the canoe rounded a bend in the river, three large white objects appeared in the \"reach\" before them.  A single glance satisfied all that they were swans, though, in the deceptive glare of the torch, they appeared even larger than swans.  Their long upright necks, however, convinced the party they could be nothing else, and the canoe was headed directly for them.  As our hunters approached, one of the birds was heard to utter his strange trumpet-note, and this he repeated at intervals as they drew nearer.  \"I have heard that they sing before death,\" muttered Francois to Basil, who sat nearest him.  \"If so, I hope that's the song itself;\" and Francois laughed quietly at the joke he had perpetrated.  Basil also laughed; and Lucien, who had overheard the remark, could not restrain himself from joining in the laughter.  \"I fear not,\" rejoined Basil; \"there is hardly enough music in the note to call it a song.  They may live to `blow their own trumpet' a long while yet.\"  This remark called forth a fresh chorus of laughter, in which all took part; but it was a very silent kind of laughter, that could not have been heard ten yards off: it might have been termed \"laughing in a whisper.\"  It soon ended, however, as matters now became serious: they were already within less than two hundred yards of the game, and the greatest caution had to be observed.  The gunners had arranged the order of fire: Basil was to shoot first, taking steady aim with his rifle at any one of the birds; while Francois should fire as soon as he heard the report of his brother's gun, taking the remaining swans upon the wing, with one or both barrels, as he best might.  At length Basil deemed himself near enough, and, levelling his piece, fired.  The bird threw out its wings, and flattened down upon the water, almost without a struggle.  The other two were rising into the air, when \"crack! crack!\" went the two barrels of Francois' piece, and one of the swans fell back with a broken wing, and fluttered over the surface of the stream.  Basil's had been shot dead, and was taken up easily; but the wounded bird was only captured after a long chase with the canoe; and when overtaken, it struck so fiercely with its remaining wing, that one of the blows inflicted a painful wound on the wrist of Francois. Both, however, were at length got safely aboard, and proved to be a male and female of the largest dimensions.    CHAPTER SIX.  \"CAST AWAY.\"  Of course, the reports of the guns must have frightened any other swans that were near.  It was not likely they would find any more before going some distance farther down the river; so, having stowed away in a safe place the two already killed, the hunters paddled rapidly onward.  They had hardly gone half a mile farther, when another flock of swans was discovered.  These were approached in a similar way, and no less than three were obtained--Francois making a remarkable shot, and killing with both barrels.  A little farther down, one of the \"hoopers\" was killed; and still farther on, another trumpeter; making in all no less than seven swans that lay dead in the bottom of the canoe!  These seven great birds almost filled the little craft to the gunwales, and you would think that our \"torch-hunters\" ought to have been content with such a spoil; but the hunter is hard to satisfy with game, and but too often inclined to \"spill much more blood\" than is necessary to his wants.  Our voyageurs, instead of desisting, again set the canoe in motion, and continued the hunt.  A short distance below the place where they had shot the last swan, as they were rounding a bend in the river, a loud rushing sounded in their ears; similar to that produced by a cascade or waterfall.  On first hearing it, they were startled and somewhat alarmed.  It might be a \"fall,\" thought they.  Norman could not tell: he had never travelled this route; he did not know whether there were falls in the Red River or not, but he believed not.  In his voyage to the South, he had travelled by another route; that was, up the Winnipeg River, and through Rainy Lake and the Lake of the Woods to Lake Superior.  This is the usual and well-known track followed by the _employes_ of the Hudson's Bay Company; and Norman had travelled it.  In this uncertainty the canoe was brought to a stop, and our voyageurs remained listening.  The noise made by the water was not very distant, and sounded like the roaring of \"rapids,\" or the rush of a \"fall.\"  It was evidently one or the other; but, after listening to it for a considerable time, all came to the conclusion that the sound did not proceed from the Red River itself, but from some stream that emptied into it upon the right.  With this belief they again put the canoe in motion, and glided slowly and cautiously onward.  Their conjecture proved to be correct.  As they approached nearer, they perceived that the noise appeared every moment more and more to their right; and presently they saw, below them, a rapid current sweeping into the Red River from the right bank.  This was easily distinguished by the white froth and bubbles that were carried along upon its surface, and which had evidently been produced by some fall over which the water had lately passed.  The hunters now rowed fearlessly forward, and in a few moments came opposite the _debouchure_ of the tributary stream, when a considerable cascade appeared to their view, not thirty yards from the Red River itself.  The water foamed and dashed over a series of steps, and then swept rapidly on, in a frothy current.  They had entered this current, and were now carried along with increased velocity, so that the oarsmen suspended operations, and drew their paddles within the canoe.  A flock of swans now drew their attention.  It was the largest flock they had yet seen, numbering nearly a score of these noble birds,--a sight, as Norman informed them, that was exceedingly rare even in the most favoured haunts of the swan.  Rarely are more than six or seven seen together, and oftener only two or three.  A grand _coup_ was determined upon.  Norman took up his own gun, and even Lucien, who managed the stern oar, and guided the craft, also brought his piece--a very small rifle--close to his hand, so that he might have a shot as well as the others.  The canoe was directed in such a manner that, by merely keeping its head down the stream, it would float to the spot where the swans were.  In a short while they approached very near the great birds, and our hunters could see them sitting on the water, with upraised necks, gazing in wonder at the torch.  Whether they sounded their strange note was not known, for the \"sough\" of the waterfall still echoed in the ears of the canoemen, and they could not hear aught else.  Basil and Norman fired first, and simultaneously; but the louder detonations of Francois' double-barrel, and even the tiny crack of Lucien's rifle, were heard almost the instant after.  Three of the birds were killed by the volley, while a fourth, evidently \"winged,\" was seen to dive, and flutter down-stream.  The others mounted into the air, and disappeared in the darkness.  During the time occupied in this manoeuvre, the canoe, no longer guided by Lucien's oar, had been caught by some eddy in the current, and swept round stern-foremost.  In this position the light no longer shone upon the river ahead, but was thrown up-stream.  All in a downward direction was buried in deep darkness.  Before the voyageurs could bring the canoe back to its proper direction, a new sound fell upon their ears that caused some of them to utter a cry of terror.  It was the noise of rushing water, but not that which they had already heard and passed.  It was before them in the river itself.  Perhaps it was a cataract, and _they were sweeping rapidly to its brink_!  The voice of Norman was heard exclaiming, \"Hold with your oars!--the rapids!--the rapids!\"  At the same time he himself was seen rising up and stretching forward for an oar.  All was now consternation; and the movements of the party naturally consequent upon such a sudden panic shook the little craft until her gunwales lipped the water.  At the same time she had swung round, until the light again showed the stream ahead, and a horrid sight it was.  Far as the eye could see was a reach of foaming rapids.  Dark points of rocks, and huge black boulders, thickly scattered in the channel, jutted above the surface; and around and against these, the water frothed and hissed furiously.  There was no cataract, it is true--there is none such in Red River--but for all purposes of destruction the rapids before them were equally dangerous and terrible to the eyes of our voyageurs.  They no longer thought of the swans.  The dead were permitted to float down unheeded, the wounded to make its escape.  Their only thought was to stop the canoe before it should be carried upon the rapids.  With this intent all had taken to the oars, but in spite of every exertion they soon found that the light craft had got within the influence of the strong current, and was sucked downward more rapidly than ever.  Their backward strokes were to no purpose.

MacAPP  ILLUSTRATED BY GAUGHAN                 There's nothing wrong with                dying--it just hasn't ever                had the proper sales pitch!   It all began when the new bookkeeping machine of a large Midwestern coffin manufacturer slipped a cog, or blew a transistor, or something. It was fantastic that the error--one of two decimal places--should enjoy a straight run of okays, human and mechanical, clear down the line; but when the figures clacked out at the last clacking-out station, there it was. The figures were now sacred; immutable; and it is doubtful whether the President of the concern or the Chairman of the Board would have dared question them--even if either of those two gentlemen had been in town.  As for the Advertising Manager, the last thing he wanted to do was question them. He carried them (they were the budget for the coming fiscal year) into his office, staggering a little on the way, and dropped dazedly into his chair. They showed the budget for his own department as exactly one hundred times what he'd been expecting. That is to say, fifty times what he'd put in for.  When the initial shock began to wear off, his face assumed an expression of intense thought. In about five minutes he leaped from his chair, dashed out of the office with a shouted syllable or two for his secretary, and got his car out of the parking lot. At home, he tossed clothes into a travelling bag and barged toward the door, giving his wife a quick kiss and an equally quick explanation. He didn't bother to call the airport. He meant to be on the next plane east, and no nonsense about it....         *       *       *       *       *  With one thing and another, the economy hadn't been exactly in overdrive that year, and predictions for the Christmas season were gloomy. Early retail figures bore them out. Gift buying dribbled along feebly until Thanksgiving, despite brave speeches by the Administration. The holiday passed more in self-pity than in thankfulness among owners of gift-oriented businesses.  Then, on Friday following Thanksgiving, the coffin ads struck.  Struck may be too mild a word. People on the streets saw feverishly-working crews (at holiday rates!) slapping up posters on billboards. The first poster was a dilly. A toothy and toothsome young woman leaned over a coffin she'd been unwrapping. She smiled as if she'd just received overtures of matrimony from an eighty-year-old billionaire. There was a Christmas tree in the background, and the coffin was appropriately wrapped. So was she. She looked as if she had just gotten out of bed, or were ready to get into it. For amorous young men, and some not so young, the message was plain. The motto, \"_The Gift That Will Last More Than a Lifetime_\", seemed hardly to the point.  Those at home were assailed on TV with a variety of bright and clever skits of the same import. Some of them hinted that, if the young lady's gratitude were really precipitous, and the bedroom too far away, the coffin might be comfy.  Of course the more settled elements of the population were not neglected. For the older married man, there was a blow directly between the eyes: \"_Do You Want Your Widow to Be Half-Safe?_\" And, for the spinster without immediate hopes, \"_I Dreamt I Was Caught Dead Without My Virginform Casket!_\"  Newspapers, magazines and every other medium added to the assault, never letting it cool. It was the most horrendous campaign, for sheer concentration, that had ever battered at the public mind. The public reeled, blinked, shook its head to clear it, gawked, and rushed out to buy.  Christmas was not going to be a failure after all. Department store managers who had, grudgingly and under strong sales pressure, made space for a single coffin somewhere at the rear of the store, now rushed to the telephones like touts with a direct pronouncement from a horse. Everyone who possibly could got into the act. Grocery supermarkets put in casket departments. The Association of Pharmaceutical Retailers, who felt they had some claim to priority, tried to get court injunctions to keep caskets out of service stations, but were unsuccessful because the judges were all out buying caskets. Beauty parlors showed real ingenuity in merchandising. Roads and streets clogged with delivery trucks, rented trailers, and whatever else could haul a coffin. The Stock Market went completely mad. Strikes were declared and settled within hours. Congress was called into session early. The President got authority to ration lumber and other materials suddenly in starvation-short supply. State laws were passed against cremation, under heavy lobby pressure. A new racket, called boxjacking, blossomed overnight.  The Advertising Manager who had put the thing over had been fighting with all the formidable weapons of his breed to make his plant managers build up a stockpile. They had, but it went like a toupee in a wind tunnel. Competitive coffin manufacturers were caught napping, but by Wednesday after Thanksgiving they, along with the original one, were on a twenty-four hour, seven-day basis. Still only a fraction of the demand could be met. Jet passenger planes were stripped of their seats, supplied with Yankee gold, and sent to plunder the world of its coffins.  It might be supposed that Christmas goods other than caskets would take a bad dumping. That was not so. Such was the upsurge of prosperity, and such was the shortage of coffins, that nearly everything--with a few exceptions--enjoyed the biggest season on record.  On Christmas Eve the frenzy slumped to a crawl, though on Christmas morning there were still optimists out prowling the empty stores. The nation sat down to breathe. Mostly it sat on coffins, because there wasn't space in the living rooms for any other furniture.  There was hardly an individual in the United States who didn't have, in case of sudden sharp pains in the chest, several boxes to choose from. As for the rest of the world, it had better not die just now or it would be literally a case of dust to dust.  [Illustration]         *       *       *       *       *  Of course everyone expected a doozy of a slump after Christmas. But our Advertising Manager, who by now was of course Sales Manager and First Vice President also, wasn't settling for any boom-and-bust. He'd been a frustrated victim of his choice of industries for so many years that now, with his teeth in something, he was going to give it the old bite. He gave people a short breathing spell to arrange their coffin payments and move the presents out of the front rooms. Then, late in January, his new campaign came down like a hundred-megatonner.  Within a week, everyone saw quite clearly that his Christmas models were now obsolete. The coffin became the new status symbol.  The auto industry was of course demolished. Even people who had enough money to buy a new car weren't going to trade in the old one and let the new one stand out in the rain. The garages were full of coffins. Petroleum went along with Autos. (Though there were those who whispered knowingly that the same people merely moved over into the new industry. It was noticeable that the center of it became Detroit.) A few trucks and buses were still being built, but that was all.  Some of the new caskets were true works of art. Others--well, there was variety. Compact models appeared, in which the occupant's feet were to be doubled up alongside his ears. One manufacturer pushed a circular model, claiming that by all the laws of nature the foetal position was the only right one. At the other extreme were virtual houses, ornate and lavishly equipped. Possibly the largest of all was the \"_Togetherness_\" model, triangular, with graduated recesses for Father, Mother, eight children (plus two playmates), and, in the far corner beyond the baby, the cat.  The slump was over. Still, economists swore that the new boom couldn't last either. They reckoned without the Advertising Manager, whose eyes gleamed brighter all the time. People already had coffins, which they polished and kept on display, sometimes in the new \"Coffin-ports\" being added to houses. The Advertising Manager's reasoning was direct and to the point. He must get people to use the coffins; and now he had all the money to work with that he could use.  The new note was woven in so gradually that it is not easy to put a finger on any one ad and say, \"It began here.\" One of the first was surely the widely-printed one showing a tattooed, smiling young man with his chin thrust out manfully, lying in a coffin. He was rugged-looking and likable (not too rugged for the spindly-limbed to identify with) and he oozed, even though obviously dead, virility at every pore. He was probably the finest-looking corpse since Richard the Lion-Hearted.  Neither must one overlook the singing commercials. Possibly the catchiest of these, a really cute little thing, was achieved by jazzing up the Funeral March.  It started gradually, and it was all so un-violent that few saw it as suicide. Teen-agers began having \"Popping-off"]]]
