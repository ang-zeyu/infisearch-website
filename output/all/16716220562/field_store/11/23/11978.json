It is all very bad.\"  \"But surely, Holmes, character goes for something?  Then, again, why should he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a felony?\"  \"Exactly!  There are certainly objections.  But it is a formidable case which they have to meet.\"  Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office and received us with that respect which my companion's card always commanded.  He was a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his cheeks haggard, and his hands twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been subjected.  \"It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad!  Have you heard of the death of the chief?\"  \"We have just come from his house.\"  \"The place is disorganized.  The chief dead, Cadogan West dead, our papers stolen.  And yet, when we closed our door on Monday evening, we were as efficient an office as any in the government service.  Good God, it's dreadful to think of!  That West, of all men, should have done such a thing!\"  \"You are sure of his guilt, then?\"  \"I can see no other way out of it.  And yet I would have trusted him as I trust myself.\"  \"At what hour was the office closed on Monday?\"  \"At five.\"  \"Did you close it?\"  \"I am always the last man out.\"  \"Where were the plans?\"  \"In that safe.  I put them there myself.\"  \"Is there no watchman to the building?\"  \"There is, but he has other departments to look after as well. He is an old soldier and a most trustworthy man.  He saw nothing that evening. Of course the fog was very thick.\"  \"Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building after hours; he would need three keys, would he not, before he could reach the papers?\"  \"Yes, he would.  The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and the key of the safe.\"  \"Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?\"  \"I had no keys of the doors--only of the safe.\"  \"Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?\"  \"Yes, I think he was.  I know that so far as those three keys are concerned he kept them on the same ring.  I have often seen them there.\"  \"And that ring went with him to London?\"  \"He said so.\"  \"And your key never left your possession?\"  \"Never.\"  \"Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate.  And yet none was found upon his body.  One other point:  if a clerk in this office desired to sell the plans, would it not be simpler to copy the plans for himself than to take the originals, as was actually done?\"  \"It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an effective way.\"  \"But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West has that technical knowledge?\"  \"No doubt we had, but I beg you won't try to drag me into the matter, Mr. Holmes.  What is the use of our speculating in this way when the original plans were actually found on West?\"  \"Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking originals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have equally served his turn.\"  \"Singular, no doubt--and yet he did so.\"  \"Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable.  Now there are three papers still missing.  They are, as I understand, the vital ones.\"  \"Yes, that is so.\"  \"Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers, and without the seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?\"  \"I reported to that effect to the Admiralty.  But to-day I have been over the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it.  The double valves with the automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers which have been returned.  Until the foreigners had invented that for themselves they could not make the boat.  Of course they might soon get over the difficulty.\"  \"But the three missing drawings are the most important?\"  \"Undoubtedly.\"  \"I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round the premises.  I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.\"  He examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the iron shutters of the window.  It was only when we were on the lawn outside that his interest was strongly excited. There was a laurel bush outside the window, and several of the branches bore signs of having been twisted or snapped.  He examined them carefully with his lens, and then some dim and vague marks upon the earth beneath.  Finally he asked the chief clerk to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to me that they hardly met in the centre, and that it would be possible for anyone outside to see what was going on within the room.  \"The indications are ruined by three days' delay.  They may mean something or nothing.  Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can help us further.  It is a small crop which we have gathered. Let us see if we can do better in London.\"  Yet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left Woolwich Station.  The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with confidence that he saw Cadogan West--whom he knew well by sight--upon the Monday night, and that he went to London by the 8:15 to London Bridge.  He was alone and took a single third-class ticket.  The clerk was struck at the time by his excited and nervous manner.  So shaky was he that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped him with it.  A reference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was the first train which it was possible for West to take after he had left the lady about 7:30.  \"Let us reconstruct, Watson,\" said Holmes after half an hour of silence.  \"I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever had a case which was more difficult to get at.  Every fresh advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we have surely made some appreciable progress.  \"The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been against young Cadogan West; but the indications at the window would lend themselves to a more favourable hypothesis.  Let us suppose, for example, that he had been approached by some foreign agent.  It might have been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from speaking of it, and yet would have affected his thoughts in the direction indicated by his remarks to his fiancee.  Very good.  We will now suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he suddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the direction of the office. He was an impetuous man, quick in his decisions.  Everything gave way to his duty.  He followed the man, reached the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued the thief.  In this way we get over the objection that no one would take originals when he could make copies.  This outsider had to take originals. So far it holds together.\"  \"What is the next step?\"  \"Then we come into difficulties.  One would imagine that under such circumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to seize the villain and raise the alarm.  Why did he not do so? Could it have been an official superior who took the papers? That would explain West's conduct.  Or could the chief have given West the slip in the fog, and West started at once to London to head him off from his own rooms, presuming that he knew where the rooms were?  The call must have been very pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no effort to communicate with her.  Our scent runs cold here, and there is a vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of West's body, with seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train. My instinct now is to work from the other end.  If Mycroft has given us the list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two tracks instead of one.\"  Surely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street.  A government messenger had brought it post-haste.  Holmes glanced at it and threw it over to me.  There are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an affair.  The only men worth considering are Adolph Mayer, of 13 Great George Street, Westminster; Louis La Rothiere, of Campden Mansions, Notting Hill; and Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caulfield Gardens, Kensington. The latter was known to be in town on Monday and is now reported as having left.  Glad to hear you have seen some light.  The Cabinet awaits your final report with the utmost anxiety.  Urgent representations have arrived from the very highest quarter.  The whole force of the State is at your back if you should need it.  Mycroft.  \"I'm afraid,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"that all the queen's horses and all the queen's men cannot avail in this matter.\"  He had spread out his big map of London and leaned eagerly over it. \"Well, well,\" said he presently with an exclamation of satisfaction, \"things are turning a little in our direction at last.  Why, Watson, I do honestly believe that we are going to pull it off, after all.\"  He slapped me on the shoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity.  \"I am going out now.  It is only a reconnaissance.  I will do nothing serious without my trusted comrade and biographer at my elbow.  Do you stay here, and the odds are that you will see me again in an hour or two.  If time hangs heavy get foolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative of how we saved the State.\"  I felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind, for I knew well that he would not depart so far from his usual austerity of demeanour unless there was good cause for exultation.  All the long November evening I waited, filled with impatience for his return.  At last, shortly after nine o'clock, there arrived a messenger with a note:  Am dining at Goldini's Restaurant, Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please come at once and join me there.  Bring with you a jemmy, a dark lantern, a chisel, and a revolver.  S.H.  It was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the dim, fog-draped streets.  I stowed them all discreetly away in my overcoat and drove straight to the address given.  There sat my friend at a little round table near the door of the garish Italian restaurant.  \"Have you had something to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2346"],["title","The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans (#4)"],["body","at?  Then join me in a coffee and curacao. Try one of the proprietor's cigars.  They are less poisonous than one would expect.  Have you the tools?\"  \"They are here, in my overcoat.\"  \"Excellent.  Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with some indication of what we are about to do.  Now it must be evident to you, Watson, that this young man's body was PLACED on the roof of the train.  That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact that it was from the roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.\"  \"Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?\"  \"I should say it was impossible.  If you examine the roofs you will find that they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing round them.  Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was placed on it.\"  \"How could he be placed there?\"  \"That was the question which we had to answer.  There is only one possible way.  You are aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels at some points in the West End.  I had a vague memory that as I have travelled by it I have occasionally seen windows just above my head. Now, suppose that a train halted under such a window, would there be any difficulty in laying a body upon the roof?\"  \"It seems most improbable.\"  \"We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.  Here all other contingencies HAVE failed.  When I found that the leading international agent, who had just left London, lived in a row of houses which abutted upon the Underground, I was so pleased that you were a little astonished at my sudden frivolity.\"  \"Oh, that was it, was it?\"  \"Yes, that was it.  Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13 Caulfield Gardens, had become my objective.  I began my operations at Gloucester Road Station, where a very helpful official walked with me along the track and allowed me to satisfy myself not only that the back-stair windows of Caulfield Gardens open on the line but the even more essential fact that, owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways, the Underground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at that very spot.\"  \"Splendid, Holmes!  You have got it!\"  \"So far--so far, Watson.  We advance, but the goal is afar. Well, having seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and satisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown.  It is a considerable house, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms. Oberstein lived there with a single valet, who was probably a confederate entirely in his confidence.  We must bear in mind that Oberstein has gone to the Continent to dispose of his booty, but not with any idea of flight; for he had no reason to fear a warrant, and the idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to him.  Yet that is precisely what we are about to make.\"  \"Could we not get a warrant and legalize it?\"  \"Hardly on the evidence.\"  \"What can we hope to do?\"  \"We cannot tell what correspondence may be there.\"  \"I don't like it, Holmes.\"  \"My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street.  I'll do the criminal part.  It's not a time to stick at trifles.  Think of Mycroft's note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who waits for news.  We are bound to go.\"  My answer was to rise from the table.  \"You are right, Holmes.  We are bound to go.\"  He sprang up and shook me by the hand.  \"I knew you would not shrink at the last,\" said he, and for a moment I saw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had ever seen.  The next instant he was his masterful, practical self once more.  \"It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry.  Let us walk,\" said he.  \"Don't drop the instruments, I beg.  Your arrest as a suspicious character would be a most unfortunate complication.\"  Caulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced pillared, and porticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle Victorian epoch in the West End of London.  Next door there appeared to be a children's party, for the merry buzz of young voices and the clatter of a piano resounded through the night.  The fog still hung about and screened us with its friendly shade.  Holmes had lit his lantern and flashed it upon the massive door.  \"This is a serious proposition,\" said he.  \"It is certainly bolted as well as locked.  We would do better in the area.  There is an excellent archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude. Give me a hand, Watson, and I'll do the same for you.\"  A minute later we were both in the area.  Hardly had we reached the dark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog above.  As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set to work upon the lower door.  I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it flew open.  We sprang through into the dark passage, closing the area door behind us.  Holmes led the way up the curving, uncarpeted stair.  His little fan of yellow light shone upon a low window.  \"Here we are, Watson--this must be the one.\"  He threw it open, and as he did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud roar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his light along the window-sill.  It was thickly coated with soot from the passing engines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places.  \"You can see where they rested the body.  Halloa, Watson! what is this? There can be no doubt that it is a blood mark.\"  He was pointing to faint discolourations along the woodwork of the window.  \"Here it is on the stone of the stair also.  The demonstration is complete.  Let us stay here until a train stops.\"  We had not long to wait.  The very next train roared from the tunnel as before, but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of brakes, pulled up immediately beneath us.  It was not four feet from the window-ledge to the roof of the carriages. Holmes softly closed the window.  \"So far we are justified,\" said he.  \"What do you think of it, Watson?\"  \"A masterpiece.  You have never risen to a greater height.\"  \"I cannot agree with you there.  From the moment that I conceived the idea of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very abstruse one, all the rest was inevitable.  If it were not for the grave interests involved the affair up to this point would be insignificant.  Our difficulties are still before us. But perhaps we may find something here which may help us.\"  We had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon the first floor.  One was a dining-room, severely furnished and containing nothing of interest.  A second was a bedroom, which also drew blank.  The remaining room appeared more promising, and my companion settled down to a systematic examination.  It was littered with books and papers, and was evidently used as a study.  Swiftly and methodically Holmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer and cupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten his austere face.  At the end of an hour he was no further than when he started.  \"The cunning dog has covered his tracks,\" said he.  \"He has left nothing to incriminate him.  His dangerous correspondence has been destroyed or removed.  This is our last chance.\"  It was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-desk. Holmes pried it open with his chisel.  Several rolls of paper were within, covered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to what they referred.  The recurring words, \"water pressure\" and \"pressure to the square inch\" suggested some possible relation to a submarine. Holmes tossed them all impatiently aside.  There only remained an envelope with some small newspaper slips inside it.  He shook them out on the table, and at once I saw by his eager face that his hopes had been raised.  \"What's this, Watson?  Eh?  What's this?  Record of a series of messages in the advertisements of a paper.  Daily Telegraph agony column by the print and paper.  Right-hand top corner of a page. No dates--but messages arrange themselves.  This must be the first:  \"Hoped to hear sooner.  Terms agreed to.  Write fully to address given on card.  \"Pierrot.  \"Next comes:  \"Too complex for description.  Must have full report, Stuff awaits you when goods delivered.  \"Pierrot.  \"Then comes:  \"Matter presses.  Must withdraw offer unless contract completed. Make appointment by letter. Will confirm by advertisement.  \"Pierrot.  \"Finally:  \"Monday night after nine.  Two taps.  Only ourselves.  Do not be so suspicious.  Payment in hard cash when goods delivered.  \"Pierrot.  \"A fairly complete record, Watson!  If we could only get at the man at the other end!\"  He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the table.  Finally he sprang to his feet.  \"Well, perhaps it won't be so difficult, after all.  There is nothing more to be done here, Watson.  I think we might drive round to the offices of the Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good day's work to a conclusion.\"   Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after breakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our proceedings of the day before.  The professional shook his head over our confessed burglary.  \"We can't do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes,\" said he. \"No wonder you get results that are beyond us.  But some of these days you'll go too far, and you'll find yourself and your friend in trouble.\"  \"For England, home and beauty--eh, Watson?  Martyrs on the altar of our country.  But what do you think of it, Mycroft?\"  \"Excellent, Sherlock!  Admirable!  But what use will you make of it?\"  Holmes picked up the Daily Telegraph which lay upon the table.  \"Have you seen Pierrot's advertisement to-day?\"  \"What?  Another one?\"  \"Yes, here it is:  \"To-night.  Same hour.  Same place.  Two taps.  Most vitally important. Your own safety at stake.  \"Pierrot.  \"By George!\" cried Lestrade.  \"If he answers that we've got him!\"  \"That was"]]]
