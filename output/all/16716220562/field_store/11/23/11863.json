It's not that, it's money, that's keepin' him from goin' afloat again.\"  \"How's that?\" asked Puffy.  \"This is how it was.  He got a letter which axed him to call on a lawyer in Lun'on, who told him an old friend of his father had made a lot o' tin out in Austeralia, an' he died, an' left some hundreds o' pounds--I don't know how many--to his mother.\"  \"Humph! that's just like him, the hypercrit,\" growled Joe Stubley; \"no sooner comes a breeze o' good luck than off he goes, too big and mighty for his old business.  He was always preachin' that money was the root of all evil, an' now he's found it out for a fact.\"  \"No, Fred never said that `money was the root of all evil,' you thick-head,\" returned Duffy; \"he said it was the _love_ of money.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it--or rather, in your glass an' drink it, for that's the way to get it clearer in your fuddled brain.\"  \"Hold on, boys; you're forgettin' my yarn,\" interposed Lockley at this point, for he saw that Stubley was beginning to lose temper.  \"Well, you must know it was about six years ago--I was little more than a big lad at the time, on board the _Saucy Jane_, Black Thomson bein' the skipper. You've heard o' Black Thomson, that used to be so cruel to the boys when he was in liquor, which was pretty nigh always, for it would be hard to say when he wasn't in liquor?  He tried it on wi' me when I first went aboard, but I was too--well, well, poor fellow, I'll say nothin' against him, for he's gone now.\"  \"Fred Martin was there at the time, an' it was wonderful what a hold Fred had over that old sinner.  None of us could understand it, for Fred never tried to curry favour with him, an' once or twice I heard him when he thought nobody was near, givin' advice to Black Thomson about drink, in his quiet earnest way, that made me expect to see the skipper knock him down.  But he didn't.  He took it well--only he didn't take his advice, but kep' on drinkin' harder than ever.  Whenever a _coper_ came in sight at that time Thomson was sure to have the boat over the side an' pay him a visit.  \"Well, about this time o' the year there came one night a most tremendous gale, wi' thick snow, from the nor'ard.  It was all we could do to make out anything twenty fathom ahead of us.  The skipper he was lyin' drunk down below.  We was close reefed and laying to with the foresail a-weather, lookin' out anxiously, for, the fleet bein' all round and the snow thick, our chances o' runnin' foul o' suthin' was considerable.  When we took in the last reef we could hardly stand to do it, the wind was so strong--an' wasn't it freezin', too!  Sharp enough a'most to freeze the nose off your face.  \"About midnight the wind began to shift about and came in squalls so hard that we could scarcely stand, so we took in the jib and mizzen, and lay to under the foresail.  Of course the hatchways was battened down and tarpaulined, for the seas that came aboard was fearful.  When I was standin' there, expectin' every moment that we should founder, a sea came and swept Fred Martin overboard.  Of course we could do nothing for him--we could only hold on for our lives; but the very next sea washed him right on deck again.  He never gave a cry, but I heard him say `Praise the Lord!' in his own quiet way when he laid hold o' the starboard shrouds beside me.  \"Just then another sea came aboard an' a'most knocked the senses out o' me.  At the same moment I heard a tremendous crash, an' saw the mast go by the board.  What happened after that I never could rightly understand.  I grabbed at something--it felt like a bit of plank--and held on tight, you may be sure, for the cold had by that time got such a hold o' me that I knew if I let go I would go down like a stone.  I had scarce got hold of it when I was seized round the neck by something behind me an' a'most choked.  \"I couldn't look round to see what it was, but I could see a great black object coming straight at me.  I knew well it was a smack, an' gave a roar that might have done credit to a young walrus.  The smack seemed to sheer off a bit, an' I heard a voice shout, `Starboard hard!  I've got him,' an' I got a blow on my cocoanut that well-nigh cracked it.  At the same time a boat-hook caught my coat collar an' held on.  In a few seconds more I was hauled on board of the _Cherub_ by Manx Bradley, an' the feller that was clingin' to my neck like a young lobster was Fred Martin.  The _Saucy Jane_ went to the bottom that night.\"  \"An' Black Thomson--did he go down with her?\" asked Duffy.  \"Ay, that was the end of him and all the rest of the crew.  The fleet lost five smacks that night.\"  \"Admiral's a-signallin', sir,\" said one of the watch on deck, putting his head down the hatch at that moment.  Lockley went on deck at once.  Another moment, and the shout came down--\"Haul!  Haul all!\"  Instantly the sleepers turned out all through the fleet.  Oiled frocks, sou'-westers, and long boots were drawn on, and the men hurried on the decks to face the sleet-laden blast and man the capstan bars, with the prospect before them of many hours of hard toil--heaving and hauling and fish-cleaning and packing with benumbed fingers--before the dreary winter night should give place to the grey light of a scarcely less dreary day.    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE TEMPTER'S VICTORY.  \"I wouldn't mind the frost or snow, or anything else,\" growled Joe Stubley, pausing in the midst of his labours among the fish, \"if it warn't for them sea-blisters.  Just look at that, Jim,\" he added, turning up the hard sleeve of his oiled coat, and exposing a wrist which the feeble rays of the lantern showed to be badly excoriated and inflamed.  \"Ay, it's an ugly bracelet, an' I've got one myself just begun on my left wrist,\" remarked Jim Freeman, also suspending labour for a moment to glance at his mate's wound.  \"If our fleet had a mission ship, like some o' the other fleets, we'd not only have worsted mitts for our wrists, but worsted helmets for our heads an' necks--to say nothin' of lotions, pills an' plasters.\"  \"If they'd only fetch us them things an' let alone tracts, Bibles, an' religion,\" returned Stubley, \"I'd have no objection to 'em, but what's the use o' religion to a drinkin', swearin', gamblin' lot like us?\"  \"It's quite clear that your notions about religion are muddled,\" said David Duffy, with a short laugh.  \"Why, what's the use o' physic to a sick man, Stubs?\"  \"To make him wuss,\" replied Stubs promptly.  \"You might as well argify with a lobster as with Joe Stubs,\" said Bob Lumsden, who, although burdened with the cares of the cooking department, worked with the men at cleaning and packing.  \"What does a boy like you know about lobsters, 'cept to cook 'em?\" growled Stubley.  \"You mind your pots an' pans.  That's all your brains are fit for--if you have brains at all.  Leave argification to men.\"  \"That's just what I was advisin' Duffy to do, an' not waste his breath on the likes o' you,\" retorted the boy, with a grin.  The conversation was stopped at this point by the skipper ordering the men to shake out a reef, as the wind was moderating.  By the time this was accomplished daybreak was lighting up the eastern horizon, and ere long the pale grey of the cold sea began to warm up a little under the influence of the not yet visible sun.  \"Goin' to be fine,\" said Lockley, as he scanned the horizon with his glass.  \"Looks like it,\" replied the mate.  Remarks were few and brief at that early hour, for the men, being pretty well fagged, preferred to carry on their monotonous work in silence.  As morning advanced the fleet was clearly seen in all directions and at all distances around, holding on the same course as the _Lively Poll_. Gradually the breeze moderated, and before noon the day had turned out bright and sunny, with only a few thin clouds floating in the wintry sky.  By that time the fish-boxes, or trunks, were all packed, and the men availed themselves of the brief period of idleness pending the arrival of the steam-carrier from Billingsgate to eat a hearty breakfast.  This meal, it may be remarked, was a moveable feast, depending very much on the duties in hand and the arrival of the steamer.  To get the fish ready and shipped for market is always regarded as his first and all-important duty by the deep-sea trawler, who, until it is performed, will not condescend to give attention to such secondary matters as food and repose.  These are usually taken when opportunity serves.  Pipes and recreation, in the form of games at cards, draughts, dominoes, and yarns, are also snatched at intervals between the periods of severe toil.  Nevertheless, there are times when the fisherman's experience is very different.  When prolonged calms render fishing impossible, then time hangs heavily on his hands, and--in regard to the fleet of which we write and all those similarly circumstanced--the only recreations available are sleeping, drinking, gambling, and yarn-spinning.  True, such calms do not frequently occur in winter, but they sometimes do, and one of them prevailed on the afternoon of the particular winter's day, of which we treat.  After the departure of the carrier that day, the wind fell so much that the admiral deemed it advisable not to put down the nets.  Before long the light air died away altogether, and the fleet was left floating idly, in picturesque groups and with flapping sails, on the glassy sea.  Among the groups thus scattered about, there was one smack which had quietly joined the fleet when the men were busy transhipping or \"ferrying\" the fish to the steam-carrier.  Its rig was so similar to that of the other smacks that a stranger might have taken it for one of the fleet but the fishermen knew better.  It was that enemy of souls, that floating grog-shop, that pirate of the North Sea,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23377"],["title","The Lively Poll: A Tale of the North Sea (#6)"],["body"," _coper_.  \"Good luck to 'ee,\" muttered Joe Stubley, whose sharp, because sympathetic, eye was first to observe the vessel.  \"It's bad luck to _you_ anyhow,\" remarked Bob the cook, who chanced to pass at the moment.  \"Mind your own business, Lumpy, an' none o' your sauce, if you don't want a rope's-endin',\" retorted the man.  \"Ain't I just mindin' my own business?  Why, wot is sauce but part of a cook's business?\" returned the boy.  \"I _won't_ go to her,\" thought Stephen Lockley, who overheard the conversation, and in whose breast a struggle had been going on, for he also had seen the _coper_, and, his case-bottle having run dry, he was severely tempted to have it replenished.  \"Would it not be as well, skipper, to go aboard o' the _coper_, as she's so near at hand!\" said the mate, coming aft at the moment.  \"Well, no, Peter; I think it would be as well to drop the _coper_ altogether.  The abominable stuff the Dutchmen sell us is enough to poison a shark.  You know I'm not a teetotaller, but if I'm to be killed at all, I'd rather be killed by good spirits than bad.\"  \"Right you are,\" replied Jay, \"but, you see, a lot of us are hard up for baccy, and--\"  \"Of course, of course; the men must have baccy,\" interrupted the skipper, \"an' we don't need to buy their vile brandy unless we like. Yes, get the boat out, Jay, an' we'll go.\"  Stephen Lockley was not the first man who has deceived himself as to his motives.  Tobacco was his excuse for visiting the floating den of temptation, but a craving for strong drink was his real motive.  This craving had been created imperceptibly, and had been growing by degrees for some years past, twining its octopus arms tighter and tighter round his being, until the strong and hearty young fisherman was slowly but surely becoming an abject slave, though he had fancied himself heretofore as free as the breezes that whistled round his vessel.  Now, for the first time, Lockley began to have uncomfortable suspicions about himself.  Being naturally bold and candid, he turned sharply round, and, as it were, faced _himself_ with the stern question, \"Stephen, are you sure that it's baccy that tempts you aboard of the _coper_?  Are you clear that schnapps has nothing to do with it?\"  It is one of the characteristics of the slavery to which we refer, that although strong-minded and resolute men put pointed questions of this sort to themselves not unfrequently, they very seldom return answers to them.  Their once vigorous spirits, it would seem, are still capable of an occasional heave and struggle--a sort of flash in the pan--but that is all.  The influence of the depraved appetite immediately weighs them down, and they relapse into willing submission to the bondage.  Lockley had not returned an answer to his own question when the mate reported that the boat was ready.  Without a word he jumped into her, but kept thinking to himself, \"We'll only get baccy, an' I'll leave the _coper_ before the lads can do themselves any harm.  I'll not taste a drop myself--not a single drop o' their vile stuff.\"  The Dutch skipper of the _coper_ had a round fat face and person, and a jovial, hearty manner.  He received the visitors with an air of open-handed hospitality which seemed to indicate that nothing was further from his thoughts than gain.  \"We've come for baccy,\" said Lockley, as he leaped over the bulwarks and shook hands, \"I s'pose you've plenty of that?\"  \"Ya,\" the Dutchman had \"plenty tabac--ver sheep too, an' mit sooch a goot vlavour!\"  He was what the Yankees would call a 'cute fellow, that Dutchman. Observing the emphasis with which Lockley mentioned tobacco, he understood at once that the skipper did not want his men to drink, and laid his snares accordingly.  \"Com',\" he said, in a confidential tone, taking hold of Lockley's arm, \"com' b'low, an' you shall zee de tabac, an' smell him yourself.\"  Our skipper accepted the invitation, went below, and was soon busy commenting on the weed, which, as the Dutchman truly pointed out, was \"_so_ sheep as well as goot.\"  But another smell in that cabin overpowered that of the tobacco.  It was the smell of Hollands, or some sort of spirit, which soon aroused the craving that had gained such power over the fisherman.  \"Have some schnapps!\" said the Dutch skipper, suddenly producing a case-bottle as square as himself, and pouring out a glass.  \"No, thank 'ee,\" said Stephen firmly.  \"No!\" exclaimed the other, with well-feigned surprise.  \"You not drink?\"  \"Oh yes, I drink,\" replied Lockley, with a laugh, \"but not to-day.\"  \"I not ask you to buy,\" rejoined the tempter, holding the spirits a little nearer to his victim's nose.  \"Joost take von leetle glass for goot vellowship.\"  It seemed rude to decline a proposal so liberally made, and with such a smiling countenance.  Lockley took the glass, drank it off and went hurriedly on deck, followed by the Dutchman, with the case-bottle in one hand and the glass in the other.  Of course the men had no objection to be treated.  They had a small glass all round.  \"That's the stuff for my money!\" cried Stubley, smacking his lips.  \"I say, old chap, let's have a bottle of it.  None o' your thimblefuls for me.  I like a good swig when I'm at it.\"  \"You'd better wait till we get aboard, Joe, before you begin,\" suggested Lockley, who was well aware of Joe's tendencies.  Joe admitted the propriety of this advice, but said he would treat his mates to one glass before starting, by \"way o' wetting their whistles.\"  \"Ya, joost von glass vor vet deir vistles,\" echoed the Dutchman, with a wink and a look which produced a roar of laughter.  The glass was accepted by all, including Lockley, who had been quite demoralised by the first glass.  The victory was gained by the tempter for that time at least.  The fishermen who went for baccy, remained for schnapps, and some of them were very soon more than half drunk.  It was a fierce, maddening kind of spirit, which produced its powerful effects quickly.  The skipper of the _Lively Poll_ kept himself better in hand than his men, but, being very sociable in disposition, and finding the Dutchman a humorous and chatty fellow, he saw no reason to hurry them away. Besides, his vessel was close alongside, and nothing could be done in the fishing way during the dead calm that prevailed.  While he and his men were engaged in a lively conversation about nothing in particular--though they were as earnest over it as if the fate of empires depended on their judgment--the Dutch skipper rose to welcome another boat's crew, which approached on the other side of the _coper_. So eager and fuddled were the disputants of the _Lively Poll_ that they did not at first observe the newcomers.  It was the _Fairy's_ boat, with Dick Martin in charge.  \"Hallo, Dick, mein boy; gif me your vlipper.\"  A sign from Martin induced the Dutchman to lean over the side and speak in lower tones.  \"Let's have a keg of it,\" said Dick, with a mysterious look.  \"Ned Bryce sent me for a good supply, an' here's _fish_ to pay for it.\"  The fish--which of course belonged to the owner of the _Fairy_, not to Ned Bryce--were quickly passed up, and a keg of spirits passed down. Then the Dutchman asked if Dick or his men wanted tabac or schnapps for themselves.  \"I vill take jersey, or vish, or sail, or boots, or vat you please in exchange.  Com' aboard, anyhow, an' have von leetle glass.\"  Dick and his men having thus smartly transacted their chief business, leaped on deck, made fast their painter, let the boat drop astern, and were soon smoking and drinking amicably with the crew of the _Lively Poll_.  Not long afterwards they were quarrelling.  Then Dick Martin, who was apt to become pugnacious over his liquor, asserted stoutly that something or other \"was.\"  Joe Stubley swore that it \"_was not_,\" whereupon Dick Martin planted his fist on Joe Stubley's nose and laid its growly owner flat on the deck.  Starting up, Joe was about to retaliate, when Lockley, seizing him by the neck thrust him over the side into the boat, and ordered his more or less drunken crew to follow.  They did so with a bad grace, but the order was given in a tone which they well understood must not be disobeyed.  As they pushed off, Stubley staggered and fell into the sea.  Another moment and he would have been beyond all human aid, but Lockley caught a glimpse of his shaggy black head as it sank.  Plunging his long right arm down, and holding on to the boat with his left, he caught the drowning man by the hair.  Strong and willing arms helped, and Stubley was hauled inboard--restored to life, opportunity, and hope--and flung into the bottom of the boat.  The oars were shipped, and they pulled for the _Lively Poll_.  As they rode away they saw that other boats were proceeding towards the _coper_. The men in them were all anxious to buy baccy.  No mention was made of drink.  Oh dear no!  They cared nothing for that, though, of course, they had no sort of objection to accept the wily Dutchman's generous offer of \"von leetle glass vor goot vellowship.\"    CHAPTER SIX.  THE POWER OF SYMPATHY.  One fine afternoon, not long after the visit to the _coper_, Bob Lumsden, _alias_ Lumpy, was called from his culinary labours to assist in hauling in the net.  Now it is extremely interesting to note what a wonderful effect the power of loving sympathy can have on a human being.  Lumpy was a human being--though some of his mates insisted that he must have been descended from a cod-fish, because his mouth was so large.  No doubt it was, and when the boy laughed heartily he was, indeed, apt to remind one of that fish; nevertheless it was a good, well-shaped mouth, though large, with a kindly expression about it, and a set of splendid white teeth inside of it.  But, whether human or fishy in his nature, Bob Lumsden had been overwhelmed by a flood of sympathy ever since that memorable day when he had first caught a glimpse of the sweet, pale face of the little invalid Eve Mooney."]]]
