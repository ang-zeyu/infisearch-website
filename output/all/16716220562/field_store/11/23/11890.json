Anxiously and swiftly did Francois drag his master out, and great was his relief when poor Redding looked at him with a bewildered gaze and demanded to know what had happened!  \"Oh!  I see, capsized,\" he said, rising and pressing his hand to his brow, \"I believe I must have hit my head against a stump, for I've been slightly stunned.  However, `all's well that ends well.'  Not hurt, Francois?\"  \"No, Monsieur,--not fatever.\"  \"That's right, lend a hand to lift the sleigh--hoop! there--jump in.\"  Le Rue obeyed.  The bear-rug was replaced around them, and the pony, which had stood as quiet as a lamb during the accident, started forward again.  \"Voila! von light,\" exclaimed the Canadian.  At that moment they had rounded the corner of a high cliff, and come into view of Boulder Creek.  There was just light enough to make the chaotic grandeur of the place visible in a ghostly degree.  Great boulders and masses of rock, which had fallen from the neighbouring mountains and cliffs, lay piled about in the creek or gully in wildest confusion.  Some of these masses were as large as a small hut, but they were of all sizes as well as shapes.  It was a weird scene, and forbidding; nevertheless some human being had seen fit to take up his abode there, as was made apparent by the light referred to by Le Rue.  Picking their way carefully among the boulders, the travellers at last reached a log-hut which was so small, weather-worn, and grey, that, from a short distance, it might have easily been mistaken, even in daylight, for one of the rocks by which it was surrounded.  The door stood wide open, and through it streamed the light of a roaring fire of wood.  So powerful was the contrast between the ruddy light and the cold grey scene without, that to the approaching travellers it appeared as if the whole interior of the hut glowed with fervent heat.  In the small doorway stood the figure of a man who was so large as almost to fill up the entrance, and so black, by contrast with the glowing background, that neither feature nor form was distinguishable save his sharp outline.  The outline, however, was a remarkably telling one.  It told of a broad chest and square shoulders, of massive limbs, and an easy air, and a sturdy attitude, and suggested difficulty in the way of entering that hut without leave asked and obtained.  \"Hallo!\" exclaimed the outline, in a voice so deep that it must have been unfathomable.  \"How d'ee do, Bellew?\" cried Reginald Redding, as he drove into the stream of light, pulled up, and sprang from the sleigh.  \"Hearty, sir, hearty, thank 'ee,\" replied the outline, advancing and becoming a little more visible on the surface as he did so.  \"Hallo!  Le Rue, how are 'ee?  Glad to see you both.  Step in.  A good fire on a coldish night is cheery--ain't it, Mister Redding?\"  \"Indeed it is, Bellew, especially when the night happens to be also darkish.\"  \"Ha! oui,\" interposed Le Rue, bustling into the hut with the bear-rug, \"it vas so darkish dat ve capsize under de cliff an' a'most knock de whole affair to smattoms--sleigh, cheval, an' peepil.\"  \"I'm glad to see that the `peepil' is all right, however,\" said Bellew, glancing at his visitors with what may be called a grave smile; \"it might have bin worse, for that's an ugly corner under the cliff, an' needs careful drivin' even in daylight.\"  \"I've not come off quite scatheless, however,\" said Redding, rubbing the top of his head tenderly, \"for here is a bump that would perplex the whole college of phrenologists.\"  \"Skin broke, sir?\" asked Bellew, advancing and examining the part.  \"No, all right.  A good supper will be the best cure for it.  If I was a phrenologist now, I'd name it the bump of top-heaviness.  Sit down, sir; sit down, Le Rue, an' look after my kettle while I see to your nag.\"  So saying, their host went out and left his unexpected, but evidently welcome, guests to make themselves comfortable.  Although Jonas Bellew was a recluse, he was by no means an ascetic.  He was marked by deep gravity of countenance coupled with a kindly humorous disposition.  No one knew where he came from, or why he had taken up his abode in such a lonely spot.  Many of the rough fellows who hang on the outskirts of the wilderness had tried as they said, to \"pump\" him on these points, but Jonas was either a dry well or a deep one, for pumping brought forth nothing.  He gained a livelihood by shooting, fishing, trapping wild animals for their skins, and, sometimes, by doing what he called \"odd jobs\" in the settlements.  \"Your home appears to me to grow wilder every time I see it,\" said Redding, as Bellew re-entered the hut, and busied himself in spreading on a rough deal table the materials of a plain but substantial meal.  \"That seems to be the idea of most men who come here,\" replied the trapper, \"but it's not many that favour me with a visit.\"  \"Ha! vraiment, dat must be true,\" interposed the Canadian, \"for no body vill com' here 'xcept them as do want hims legs broke.\"  \"Well, I have seen a few damaged shins and broken heads since I came to this location,\" said Jonas, \"but such accidents occur chiefly among the Canadian French, who seem on the whole to be a clumsy set.\"  \"Not von half so clumsy as de Engleesh, or Irish, or Scosh,\" retorted Le Rue.  \"Perhaps you're right, an' mayhap you're wrong, lad, anyway here is supper.  The Frenchmen are always good at their victuals, so sit in an' go to work.  Take the keg, Mister Redding.  I've not found time yet to make chairs, but it's wonderful how well a man gets along without such luxuries.\"  \"Especially when a man sits down to a venison-steak like this,\" said the fur-trader, taking the offered seat, while his man sat down on a block of wood set on end, and prepared to prove the truth of the trapper's assertion in regard to French capacity for food.  \"'Taint venison,\" said Bellew, assisting his companions to the meat in question, \"it's bear.\"  \"Indeed? and not bad food for a hungry man,\" returned Redding, as he began supper.  \"Where got you him?\"  \"Down near Jenkins Creek, where the McLeods are setting up their saw-mill.\"  \"The McLeods!\" exclaimed Redding, looking up suddenly, \"have you seen the McLeods?\"  \"Ay, I've bin helpin' them a bit wi' the mill.  Goin' down again to-morrow.  If this weather holds, the ice must give way soon, and then we'll be able to push ahead faster.\"  The trapper said this quietly, and without looking up from the bear-steak with which he was busy, so that Redding's look of surprise appeared to be lost on him.  The fur-trader and his man exchanged glances.  For a few minutes the process of mastication completely engrossed the trio, but the thoughts of the fur-trader were busy, for he was disappointed to find that one whom he respected so much as Jonas Bellew should thus coolly state that he was aiding the interlopers.  Presently he laid down his knife and fork, and said:--  \"Are you aware, Bellew, that these McLeods have settled themselves on the Company's reserve lands?\"  \"No, sir, I wasn't aware of it.\"  \"Well, then, I now tell you that they have,\" said Redding, who, unfortunately for himself and others, possessed an easily-roused spirit and was apt to become irascible when the rights--real or supposed--of the Company which he represented appeared in danger of violation.  \"At least,\" he continued, in a less positive tone, \"I have reason to believe that such is the case, and I am now on my way to--\"  He paused abruptly, feeling the impropriety of revealing his plans to one who, although a quiet and sensible man, and not given to talk too much, was, nevertheless, by his own admission, an aider and abettor of the enemy.  \"Whereabouts is the boundary line?\" asked Bellew, after a short silence.  \"At Jenkins Creek--_that_ creek is the boundary,\" answered the fur-trader.  \"On which side of the creek have they begun to build the mill?\"  \"They haven't begun yet, sir, but I believe they intend to commence on the south side.\"  \"So far well,\" replied Redding, \"but if I find that they have raised a stone or planted a stake on the _north_ side of the creek, I'll--\"  Here feeling that he was about to give way to a boastful spirit, he got himself out of the difficulty of having to finish the sentence by making a sudden and somewhat stern demand for \"more bear-steak.\"  \"Vid pleasieur, Monsieur,\" said Le Rue, placing a huge slice on his master's plate.  \"Well, sir, I hope you'll find that they haven't overstepped the boundary,\" said Bellew, \"because the McLeods look as if they'd be troublesome customers to deal with.\"  The fur-trader made no reply.  He felt indignant at the bare idea of his being checked in doing his duty by any man, or men, who were \"troublesome,\" by which expression he understood Bellew to mean that they were resolute and physically powerful in opposition; he therefore thought it best to avoid any further tendency to boast by holding his tongue.  Not so his volatile retainer, who stuck his fork into a lump of meat vindictively, as if it had been the body of a McLeod, and exclaimed:--  \"Hah! vat you say? troblesom, eh? who care for dat?  If de Macklodds do touche, by von small hinch, de lands of de Companie--ve vill--hah!\"  Another stab of the fork was all that the savage Le Rue vouchsafed as an explanation of his intentions.  In this frame of mind Reginald Redding and his man started off next morning on foot at an early hour, slept that night at a place called Sam's hut, and, the following evening, drew near to the end of their journey.    CHAPTER THREE.  A BRIEF BUT AGREEABLE MEETING.  The little outskirt settlement of Partridge Bay was one of those infant colonies which was destined to become in future years"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23388"],["title","Wrecked but not Ruined (#2)"],["body"," flourishing and thickly-peopled district of Canada.  At the period of our story it was a mere cluster of dwellings that were little better than shanties in point of architecture and appearance.  They were, however, somewhat larger than these, and the cleared fields around them, with here and there a little garden railed in, gave them a more homelike aspect than the dwellings of the wood-men.  The valley in which the settlement stood was one of those magnificent stretches of primeval forest which used to be the hunting-grounds of the red man, and from which he had not at that time been thrust by the \"paleface,\" for, here and there, his wigwam might still be seen sending its wreath of blue smoke above the tree-tops.  It was evening--a calm, sunny, glorious, spring evening--when Redding and his man overtopped the heights that enclosed the vale, and paused as well to gaze upon the scene as to recover breath.  Far below them lay the hamlet, a cluster of black dots on a field of pure snow.  Roseate lights on undulations, and cold blue shadows in hollows, were tamed down in effect by the windows of the hamlet which shot forth beams of blazing fire at the setting sun.  Illimitable space seemed to stretch away to the place where the horizon would have been if it had not lost itself in a golden glory, and this vast reach was a varied irregular network of dark pines and fields of snow--the pines tipped everywhere with sparkling snow-wreaths, the fields streaked everywhere with long shadows.  Little winding lines of a grey colour which radiated from the hamlet indicated the tracks where the settlers drove their sleighs and wood-sledges.  Many of these were seen moving along the far-off tracks like insects, while the tinkle of the sleigh-bells floated upwards like fairy music.  \"Yes, I shall take up my abode there,\" murmured Redding, as he gazed in rapt admiration on the beautiful scene.  \"Monsieur?\" said his companion.  \"I say that I should like to dwell there,\" answered Redding.  \"It is a splendid country, and will be better known in days to come.\"  \"Vraiment, truly, a magnifircent kontry,\" returned Le Rue, \"gorgeows, magnifique!  I vould giv moche, ver moche, to have leetil cottage, an vife, an cow, an pigs dere.\"  As Redding had been thinking of something similar, he laughed, and commenced the descent of the zigzag track that led to the hamlet.  They had proceeded only a few yards when, turning round a cluster of pines, they suddenly discovered some travellers in difficulty--a man whose horse had shied or stumbled off the narrow track and was embedded up to the girths in the soft snow, and two females, whose furry garments, all besprinkled with snow, showed that they had just emerged from the sledge, which lay on its side behind the horse.  The driver's chief anxiety seemed to be to quiet and restrain his horse, which being high-spirited, was plunging in vain and frantic efforts to extricate himself, to the great danger of shafts and harness.  To run up and aid the man was of course the instant impulse of our travellers.  \"Ah! good luck to 'ee,\" exclaimed the driver, in tones that were unmistakably Irish, \"here, howld 'is head till I get the sled clear.\"  \"All right,\" cried the Englishman, seizing the reins near the mouth of the terrified animal and holding its head forcibly down, while Le Rue assisted the owner to unharness.  In a few minutes the vehicle was righted, and the horse released.  While the driver was busy readjusting the harness, he accompanied the operation with a running fire of grateful expressions, such as--\"there now, ain't ye in luck, Rooney?  Arrah! gentleman, it's my blissin' I bestow on yez.  Och! but I'd have bin lost intirely widout ye.  Well well, it's always the way.  I'm no sooner in a scrape than I'm sure to get out of it.  It's meself is a favoured man.  Now thin, ladies, git in, for we're late enough on the road.\"  On the two \"ladies\" thus addressed Redding and his man had been gazing in silent surprise, for they were so good-looking and so blooming, that it seemed to the two men, who had been accustomed of late to the sight of none but the brown dames of the red skins, as if a couple of beings from another and a purer world had dropped suddenly upon their path. One of the two was evidently a lady, and was possessed of no common share of beauty.  Her dark hair contrasted powerfully with the fairness of her skin and the whiteness of her teeth.  Her dazzling black eyes almost, and her red lips altogether, laughed as she observed Redding's gaze of astonishment.  Her companion, a very pretty Canadian girl, was evidently her maid.  \"We owe you many thanks, kind sirs,\" said the lady, \"for your opportune assistance.\"  \"Pardon me, madam,\" said Redding, hastening forward in some confusion as he recovered from his rather rude stare of surprise, \"I dwell in the wilderness and have been so unaccustomed of late to the sight of ladies that--that--allow me to assist you into the sleigh!\"  \"Mademoiselle, permettez moi,\" said Le Rue, advancing to the waiting-maid and politely offering his hand.  Another moment and the \"ladies\" were seated in the vehicle and carefully repacked by our travellers, while their Irish driver mounted to his seat in front and gathered up the reins.  \"Thanks, gentlemen, many thanks,\" repeated the ladies, with bewitching smiles.  \"Good luck to 'ee both,\" cried the driver, as he flourished his whip and drove away.  Redding and his man stood silently gazing for several minutes at the turn in the road where the vision had vanished.  \"Heaven for two minits, an' now--gone for evair!\" said Le Rue, with a deep sigh.  Redding echoed the sigh, and then laughed at the lugubrious expression of his man's face.  \"Oh _such_ eyes!\" exclaimed Le Rue.  \"Yes, she's rather good-looking,\" replied Redding, thinking of the lady.  \"Good-looking! non--bootifool--exiquitely bootifool,\" cried Le Rue, thinking of the maid.  Again Redding laughed.  \"Well well, Francois,\" said he, \"whether good-looking or beautiful matters little, for it's not likely that we shall ever see them again, so the less you think about them the better.--Allons! we are late enough and must not loiter.\"  They pushed ahead at once at a rapid pace, but although neither spoke, each thought with somewhat similar feelings of the little incident just described.  Lest the reader should be surprised at so small a matter affecting them so deeply, we must remark that these fur-traders had lived for some years in a region where they saw no females except the brown and rather dirty squaws of the Indians who visited the Cliff Fort with furs.  Their fort was indeed only three days' journey from the little settlement of Partridge Bay, but as the space which lay between was a particularly rugged part of the wilderness, with only a portion of road--unworthy of the name--here and there, and the greater part of the way only passable on foot or by means of dog-sledges, none but an occasional red man or a trapper went to and fro; and as the nature of the fur-trader's business called for very little intercourse with the settlements--their furs being sent by water to Quebec in summer--it followed that the inhabitants of the Cliff Fort rarely visited Partridge Bay.  The sudden vision, therefore, of two pretty females of a higher type had not only the effect on Redding and his man of novelty, but also stirred up old memories and associations.  Such good use did they now make of their time that the settlement of Partridge Bay was reached before dark, and our hero went off immediately in quest of the surveyor.  Mr Gambart was a cheerful, healthy, plump little man, with a plump little wife, and three plump little daughters.  Plumpness was not only a characteristic of the Gambarts, but also of their surroundings, for the cottage in which they dwelt had a certain air of plumpness about it, and the spot on which it stood was a round little knob of a hill.  Here Reginald Redding was hospitably received--we might almost say joyfully, because visitors to the settlement were so rare that whoever made his appearance was sure to be received as a \"welcome guest\" if he only carried the credentials of honesty and ordinary good nature on his countenance.  Redding's impatience, however, to get at the truth of the matter that had brought him there, induced him very soon to forsake the society of the three plump little daughters and retire to the plump little father's work-room.  \"It is my opinion,\" said Mr Gambart, as he carefully unfolded the plan, \"that you may find the McLeods have trespassed somewhat on your reserves, for, if my memory serves me rightly, there is a small islet-- as you see here--just in the centre of the creek, _half_ of which belongs to you.\"  \"I see it,\" said the fur-trader, earnestly gazing on the dot which represented the said island.  \"Well,\" continued the surveyor, \"that islet is a mere rock just above the waterfall, and I am of opinion that it would be almost impossible for any one to erect a mill there without encroaching to some extent on your half of it.\"  \"Good,\" replied the fur-trader, \"can you let me have a copy of the plan to-morrow?\"  \"To-night if you please.  I have one by me.\"  \"Then I'll be off by daybreak the day after to-morrow,\" said Redding, with much decision.  \"Why such haste?\" asked the surveyor, \"the McLeods are not likely to run away from you.  I know them well, for they dwelt long in this settlement, and were ever regarded as men of firm purpose--quite immovable indeed when once they had made up their minds on any point, so you'll be sure to find them at Jenkins Creek carrying out their plans, even though you should delay your return for a month.  Come, make up your mind to stay with us at least a few days.  It will do you as well as me good, and will send you back to banishment in a better frame of mind.\"  Redding, although strongly tempted by the comforts of civilised life and the hospitality of his host--not to mention the"]]]
