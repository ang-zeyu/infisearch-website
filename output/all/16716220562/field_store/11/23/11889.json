Our hero, Harry Boyns, held the steering oar.  He had been appointed by the parent Institution to the position of \"Local Secretary of the Covelly Lifeboat Branch,\" and, of course, was anxious to know the qualities of his vessel.  Harry, we may remark in passing, having lost his situation, and finding that his mother's health was failing, had made up his mind to stay on shore for a year or two, and seek employment in his native town.  Being a well-educated man, he obtained this in the office of a mercantile house, one of the partners of which was related to his mother.  The rowing powers of the new boat were soon tested.  Then Harry steered to the pier, where a tackle had been prepared for the purpose of upsetting her.  This was an interesting point in the proceedings, because few there had seen a self-righting boat, and, as usual, there was a large sprinkling in the crowd of that class of human beings who maintain the plausible, but false, doctrine, that \"seeing is believing!\"  Considerable difficulty was experienced in getting the boat to overturn. The operation was slowly accomplished; and all through there appeared to be an unwillingness on the part of the boat to upset!--a symptom which gave much satisfaction to her future crew, who stood ready on her gunwale to leap away from her.  At last she was raised completely on one side, then she balanced for a moment, and fell forward, keel up, with a tremendous splash, while the men, not a moment too soon, sprang into the sea, and a wild cheer, mingled with laughter, arose from the spectators.  If the upsetting was slow and difficult, the self-righting was magically quick and easy.  The boat went right round, and, almost before one could realise what had occurred, she was again on an even keel.  Of course she was nearly full of water at the moment of rising; but, in a few seconds, the discharging holes in her bottom had cleared the water completely away.  The whole operation of self-righting and self-emptying, from first to last, occupied only _seventeen seconds_!  If there was laughter mingled with the shouts when she overturned and threw her crew into the sea, there was nothing but deep-toned enthusiasm in the prolonged cheer which hailed her on righting, for then it was fully realised, especially by seafaring men, what genuine and valuable qualities the boat possessed, and the cheers became doubly enthusiastic when the crew, grasping the lifelines which were festooned round her sides, clambered on board again, and were reseated at the oars in less than two minutes thereafter.  This done, the boat was hauled up on her carriage, and conveyed to the house near the beach which had been prepared for her reception, there to wait, in constant readiness, until the storm should call her forth to display her peculiar qualities in actual service.  But another, and, if possible, a still more interesting ceremony remained to be performed.  This was the presentation of the gold and silver medals of the Institution to several men of the town, who, in a recent storm, had rendered signal service in the saving of human life.  The zealous and indefatigable secretary of the Institution had himself come down from London to present these.  The presentation took place in the new town hall, a large building capable of containing upwards of a thousand people, which, on the occasion, was filled to overflowing.  The mayor presided, of course, and opened proceedings, as many chairmen do, by taking the wind out of the sails of the principal speaker!  That is to say, he touched uninterestingly on each topic that was likely to engage the attention of the meeting, and stated many facts and figures in a loose and careless way, which every one knew the secretary would, as a matter of course, afterwards state much better and more correctly than himself.  But the mayor was a respected, well-meaning man, and, although his speech was listened to with manifest impatience, his sitting down was hailed with rapturous applause.  At this point--the mayor having in his excitement forgotten to call upon the secretary to speak--a stout man on the platform took advantage of the oversight and started to his feet, calling from a disgusted auditor the expression, \"Oh, there's that bore Dowler!\"  It was indeed that same Joseph who had, on a memorable occasion long past, signed himself the \"humble\" friend of Mr Webster.  Before a word could escape his lips, however, he was greeted with a storm of yells and obliged to sit down. But he did so under protest, and remained watchful for another favourable opportunity of breaking in.  Dowler never knew when he was \"out of order;\" he never felt or believed himself to be \"out of order!\" In fact, he did not know what \"out of order\" meant _when applied to himself_.  He was morally a rhinoceros.  He could not be shamed by disapprobation; could not be cowed by abuse; never was put out by noise--although he frequently was by the police; nor put down by reason--though he sometimes was by force; spoke everywhere, on all subjects, against the opinions (apparently) of everybody; and lived a life of perpetual public martyrdom and protest.  Silence having been obtained, the secretary of the Lifeboat Institution rose, and, after a few complimentary remarks on the enthusiasm in the good cause shown by the town, and especially by the lady who had presented the boat, he called Captain Harry Boyns to the platform, and presented him with the gold medal of the Institution in an able speech, wherein he related the special act of gallantry for which it was awarded--telling how that, during a terrible gale, on a dark night in December, the gallant young captain, happening to walk homewards along the cliffs, observed a vessel on the rocks, not twenty yards from the land, with the green seas making clean breaches over her; and how that-- knowing the tide was rising, and that before he could run to the town, three miles distant, for assistance, the vessel would certainly be dashed to pieces--he plunged into the surf, at the imminent risk of his life, swam to the vessel, and returned to the shore with a rope, by which means a hawser was fixed to the cliffs, and thirty-nine lives were rescued from the sea!  Well did every one present know the minute details of the heroic deed referred to, but they were glad to hear the praises of their townsman re-echoed by one who thoroughly understood the merits of the case, and whose comments thereon brought out more clearly to the minds of many the extent of the danger which the gallant captain had run, so that, when Harry stepped forward to receive the medal, he was greeted with the most enthusiastic cheers.  Thereafter, the secretary presented silver medals to two fishermen of the Cove, namely, Old Jacobs and Robert Gaston, both of whom had displayed unusual daring at the rescue of the young lady who was the donor of the lifeboat.  He then touched on the value of lifeboats in general, and gave an interesting account of the origin of the Society which he represented; but as this subject deserves somewhat special treatment, we shall turn aside from the thread of our tale for a little, to regard the Work and the Boats of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, assuring our reader that the subject is well worthy the earnest consideration of all men.  The first lifeboat ever launched upon the stormy sea was planned and built by a London coach-builder, named Lionel Lukin, who took out a patent for it in November 1785, and launched it at Bamborough, where it was the means of saving many lives the first year.  Although Lukin thus demonstrated the possibility of lives being saved by a boat which could live under circumstances that would have proved fatal to ordinary boats, he was doomed to disappointment.  The Prince of Wales (George the Fourth) did indeed befriend him, but the Lords of Admiralty were deaf, and the public were indifferent.  Lukin went to his grave unrewarded by man, but stamped with a nobility which can neither be gifted nor inherited, but only won--the nobility which attaches to the character of \"national benefactor.\"  The public were aroused from their apathy in 1789 by the wreck of the _Adventure_ of Newcastle, the crew of which perished in the presence of thousands, who could do nothing to save them.  Models of lifeboats were solicited, and premiums offered for the best.  Among those who responded, William Wouldhave, a painter, and Henry Greathead, a boat-builder of South Shields, stood pre-eminent.  The latter afterwards became a noted builder and improver of lifeboats, and was well and deservedly rewarded for his labours.  In 1803 Greathead had built thirty-one boats--eighteen for England, five for Scotland, and eight for other countries.  This was, so far, well, but it was a wretchedly inadequate provision for the necessities of the case.  It was not until 1822 that a great champion of the lifeboat cause stood forth in the person of Sir William Hillary, Baronet.  Sir William, besides being a philanthropist, was a hero!  He not only devised liberal things and carried them into execution, but he personally shared in the danger of rescuing life from the sea.  He dwelt on the shores of the Isle of Man, where he established a Sailors' Home at Douglas.  He frequently embarked in the boats that went off to rescue lives from the wrecks that were constantly occurring on the island. Once he had his ribs broken in this service, and was frequently in imminent danger of being drowned.  During his career he personally assisted in the saving of 305 human lives!  He was the means of stirring up public men, and the nation generally, to a higher sense of their duty towards those who, professionally and otherwise, risk their lives upon the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23388"],["title","Wrecked but not Ruined (#0)"],["body","but not Ruined, by R.M.

On the northern shores of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence there stood, not very long ago, a group of wooden houses, which were simple in construction and lowly in aspect.  The region around them was a vast uncultivated, uninhabited solitude.  The road that led to them was a rude one.  It wound round a rugged cliff, under the shelter of which the houses nestled as if for protection from the cold winds and the snowdrifts that took special delight in revelling there.  This group of buildings was, at the time we write of, an outpost of the fur-traders, those hardy pioneers of civilisation, to whom, chiefly, we are indebted for opening up the way into the northern wilderness of America.  The outpost was named the Cliff after the bold precipice, near the base of which it stood.  A slender stockade surrounded it, a flag-staff rose in the centre of it, and a rusty old ship's carronade reared defiantly at its front gate.  In virtue of these warlike appendages the place was sometimes styled \"the Fort.\"  When first established, the Cliff Fort lay far beyond the outmost bounds of civilised life, but the progress of emigration had sent forward wave after wave into the northern wilderness, and the tide rose at last until its distant murmur began to jar on the ears of the traders in their lonely dwelling; warning them that competition was at hand, and that, if they desired to carry on the trade in peace, they must push still further into the bush, or be hopelessly swallowed up in the advancing tide.  When the unwelcome sounds of advancing civilisation first broke the stillness of this desolate region, the chief of the trading-post was seated at breakfast with his clerk.  He was a tall, good-looking, young Englishman, named Reginald Redding.  The clerk, Bob Smart, was a sturdy youth, who first saw the light among the mountains of Scotland. Doubtless he had been named Robert when baptised, but his intimates would not have understood you had you mentioned him by that name.  Bob had just helped Reginald to the wing of a salt goose, and was about to treat himself to a leg of the same when the cook entered.  This cook was a man.  It may also be said with truth that he was more than most men.  At the outpost men were few, and of women there were none.  It may be imagined, then, that the cook's occupations and duties were numerous.  Francois Le Rue, besides being cook to the establishment, was waiter, chambermaid, firewood-chopper, butcher, baker, drawer-of-water, trader, fur-packer, and interpreter.  These offices he held professionally.  When \"_off duty_,\" and luxuriating in tobacco and relaxation, he occupied himself as an amateur shoemaker, tailor, musician, and stick-whittler, to the no small advantage of himself and his fellow-outcasts, of whom there were five or six, besides the principals already mentioned.  Le Rue's face bore an expression of dissatisfaction and perplexity as he entered the hall.  \"Oh, Monsieur Redding,\" he exclaimed, \"dem squatters, de black scoundrils what is be called Macklodds has bin come at last.\"  \"Ho, ho! the McLeods have come, have they?\" said Redding, laying down his knife and fork, and looking earnestly at the man; \"I had heard of their intention.\"  \"Oui, yis, vraiment,\" said Le Rue, with vehemence, \"dey has come to Jenkins Creek more dan tree veeks pass.  Von sauvage come an' tell me he have see dem.  Got put up von hut, an' have begin de saw-mill.\"  \"Well, well, Francois,\" returned Redding, with a somewhat doubtful smile, as he resumed his knife and fork, \"bring some more hot water, and keep your mind easy.  The McLeods can't do us much harm.  Their saw-mill will work for many a day before it makes much impression on the forests hereabouts.  There is room for us all.\"  \"Forests!\" exclaimed the cook, with a frown and a shrug of his shoulders, \"non, dey not hurt moche timber, but dey vill trade vid de Injins--de sauvages--an' give dem drink, an' git all de furs, an' fat den vill come of dat?\"  Without waiting for a reply the indignant cook went in quest of hot water, leaving the traders to discuss the salt goose and the news.  \"That's bad news,\" said Bob Smart.  \"What do you propose to do in the circumstances?\"  \"Something definite must be done,\" replied Redding, \"but I don't yet see my way as to what.\"  Having finished the goose between them, and turned its skeleton over with an inquisitive glance to make sure that nothing eatable had escaped, the two friends finished their frugal meal with a cup of tea and a fried cake of the simplest elements--flour and water--after which they drew their chairs to the fireplace,--a large open chimney well filled with blazing logs,--lighted their pipes, and entered on a discussion of the McLeods and their present position.  When their pipes were emptied, Redding arose, and, turning his back to the fire, said:--  \"Well, Bob Smart, this is the outcome of our cogitations.  I am almost certain that these McLeods have taken up their quarters within the boundary of our Company's reserve lands, and if so, they must be routed out of their nest at once.  Delay in such matters is often fatal.  The law of use and wont, Bob, is soon established; but I have a strong objection to act in uncertainty.  I will therefore drive up to the hut of Jonas Bellew, with whom I shall leave horse and sleigh, as the track ends at Boulder Creek, and proceed on snow-shoes to the new settlement in Partridge Bay, where the surveyor lives, who has the plans of our reserve lands.  I shall examine these plans, and if I find that our property has been invaded, then--\"  \"Death and confusion to the McLeods,\" interrupted Bob.  \"Well, perhaps that is the best thing to do; but the spring is well advanced.  The thermometer stood high this morning.  If a thaw should set in, you will find the walking in snow-shoes bad.\"  \"`If' is a word to which you attach too much importance, Bob.  We have not at present to do with what may be, but with what is.\"  \"True, nevertheless a prudent man has regard to probabilities,\" replied Bob, with an air of much wisdom, as he relighted his pipe.  \"Just so,\" returned Redding, \"and as there is every probability that I shall be absent a good many days, I leave you in charge of this establishment, with strict injunctions to keep aloof from the McLeods, and at the same time to keep an eye on them.  Francois Le Rue will accompany me.  I shall start immediately, therefore be pleased to go and tell Le Rue to get himself and the sleigh ready while I put on my travelling gear.\"  Obedient to the order, Smart left the room while his superior clothed himself in a leathern coat and leggings, fur cap, moccasins, and mittens.  In half an hour Redding and his man stepped into a sleigh, which was barely large enough to hold them.  They packed themselves up to the armpits in bearskin rugs, and then Redding gave his rough little nag a touch of the whip, which caused him to start forward with a jerk that set all the bells on his harness ringing merrily.  Another minute and they dashed out at the gate, swept round the base of the beetling cliff that frowned above the outpost, and entered the sombre shadow of the forest.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE RECLUSE OF BOULDER CREEK.  The road along which the travellers proceeded was desolate and dreary in the extreme.  Already darkened by clouds and snow-drift, it was rendered still more gloomy by overhanging and snow-laden branches of stunted pines.  It was just broad enough to permit the passage of a single vehicle, being a mere woodman's track, which had been extended beyond the ordinary limits of such tracks, for his personal convenience, by Jonas Bellew, a trapper who dwelt at that part of the coast already mentioned as Boulder Creek. The track followed the windings of a streamlet which was at that time covered with snow, and only distinguishable by the absence of bushes along its course.  It turned now to the right, now to the left, as rocks, or mounds, or cliffs presented obstacles.  In some places it dived precipitately into a hollow that necessitated careful driving; in others it ran straight up to the brow of a hill at an angle that obliged the travellers not only to get out and walk, but also to aid their panting pony by putting their shoulders to the back of the sleigh.  Here and there a level patch occurred over which they trotted briskly, and then down they went again by a steep incline into the bed of an ice-buried stream, to find a similarly steep ascent on the other side. Occasionally, coming to a wall-like cliff surrounded by a tangled and trackless forest, they were forced to seek the shores of the sea, and there, among rocks and ice-drift, pick their way slowly along.  Fortunately this road, just opposite to Jenkins Creek, where the McLeods had commenced their squatting operations, ran along the shore at some distance from the entrance to the creek, so that Redding could pass without encountering the newcomers, whom he was anxious to avoid until the question of the invasion of the Fur Company's rights was settled.  Despite their utmost efforts, night began to close upon the travellers before they reached Bellew's shanty in Boulder Creek.  \"Take care, Monsieur, there is von portion dangereux here,\" said Francois Le Rue.  \"Where?\" asked Redding, as he checked the pony a little and looked earnestly ahead.  \"Ah! dere!\" exclaimed Le Rue.  His remark was needless, for at that moment the sleigh turned over a ledge of rock and pitched its occupants into a snow-drift.  \"Killded?\""]]]
