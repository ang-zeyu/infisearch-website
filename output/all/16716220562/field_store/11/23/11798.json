Old Peter, who was close at his heels, fell after him, and Larry, who followed Peter to encourage and spur him on, also tumbled in.  Muggins alone was able to stop short in time.  \"Hallo, boys!\" he cried in a hoarse whisper, \"are yer timbers damaged?\"  \"Broke to smithereens,\" groaned Larry from the abyss.  Will Osten, who had scrambled out in a moment, cried hastily, \"Jump in, Muggins.  I'll lead 'em off the scent.  Stop till I return, boys, d'ye hear?\"  \"Ay, ay,\" said Larry.  Away went Will at right angles to their former course, uttering a shout of defiance, only just in time, for the mate of the _Rover_, who led the chase, was close on him.  Soon the sounds told those in hiding that the _ruse_ had been successful.  The sounds died away in the distance and the deep silence of the forest succeeded--broken only now and then by the cry of some wild animal.  Meanwhile, our hero used his legs so well that he not only left his pursuers out of sight and hearing behind, but circled gradually around until he returned to the hole where his comrades lay.  Here they all remained for nearly an hour, and then, deeming themselves safe, issued forth none the worse of their tumble.  They commenced to return to the coast, having settled that this was their wisest course, and that they could easily avoid their late comrades by keeping well to the northward. This deviation, however, was unfortunate.  Those who have tried it, know well how difficult it is to find one's way in a dense forest.  The more they attempted to get out of the wood the deeper they got into it, and at length, when night began to close in, they were forced to come to the conclusion that they were utterly lost--lost in the forest--\"a livin' example,\" as Larry O'Hale expressed it, \"of the babes in the wood!\"    CHAPTER FIVE.  SHOWS WHAT THE LOST ONES DID, AND HOW THEY WERE FOUND.  The condition of being \"lost\" is a sad one in any circumstances, but being lost in a forest--a virgin forest--a forest of unknown extent, in a vast continent such as that of South America, must be admitted to be a peculiarly severe misfortune.  Nevertheless, we are bound to say that our hero and his friends did not appear to regard their lost condition in this light.  Perhaps their indifference arose partly from their ignorance of what was entailed in being lost in the forest.  The proverb says, that \"where ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise.\"  Whether that be true or not, there can be no question that it is sometimes an advantage to be ignorant.  Had our lost friends known the extent of the forest, in which they were lost, the number of its wild four-footed inhabitants, and the difficulties and dangers that lay before them, it is certain that they could not have walked along as light-heartedly as they did, and it is probable that they would have been less able to meet those difficulties and dangers when they appeared.  Be this as it may, Will Osten and Larry O'Hale, Muggins, and Old Peter, continued to wander through the forest, after discovering that they were lost, until the increasing darkness rendered further progress impossible; then they stopped and sat down on the stump of a fallen tree.  \"It is clear,\" said our hero, \"that we shall have to pass the night here, for there is no sign of human habitation, and the light is failing fast.\"  \"That's so,\" said Muggins curtly.  \"I'm a'feard on it,\" observed Old Peter with a sigh.  \"Faix, I wouldn't mind spindin' the night,\" said Larry, \"av it worn't that we've got no grub.  It would be some comfort to know the name o' the country we're lost in.\"  \"I can tell you that, Larry,\" said Will Osten; \"we are in Peru; though what part of it I confess I do not know.\"  \"Peroo, is it?  Well, that's a comfort--anyhow.\"  \"I don't 'xacly see where the comfort o' that lies,\" said Muggins.  \"That's cause yer intellects is obtoose, boy!\" retorted Larry; \"don't ye know that it's a blissin' to know where ye are, wotiver else ye don't know?  Supposin', now, a stranger shud ax me, `Where are ye, Paddy?'--ov course I cud say at wance, `In Peroo, yer honour;' an' if he shud go for to penetrate deeper into my knowledge o' geography, sure I cud tell him that Peroo is in South Ameriky, wan o' the five quarters o' the globe, d'ye see?\"  \"But suppose, for the sake of argyment as Shikspur says, that the stranger wos to ax ye wot ye know'd about Peroo, what 'ud ye say to that, lad?\" asked Old Peter.  \"Wot would I say!  Why, I'd ax him with a look of offended dignity if he took me for a schoolmaster, an' then may be I'd ax him wot he know'd about it himself--an' krekt him av he wos wrong.\"  \"I can tell you this much about it, at all events,\" said Will, with a laugh, \"that it is a Republic, and a celebrated country for gold mines.\"  \"And I can add to yer information,\" said Old Peter, \"that there's an oncommon lot o' tigers an' other wild beasts in it, and that if we would avoid bein' eat up alive we must kindle a fire an' go to sleep in a tree.  By good luck I've got my flint and steel with me.\"  \"By equal good luck I have two biscuits in my pocket,\" said Will; \"come, before we do anything else, let us inquire into our resources.\"  Each man at once turned his pockets inside out with the following result:--  Our hero, besides two large coarse sea-biscuits, produced one of those useful knives which contain innumerable blades, with pickers, tweezers, corkscrews, and other indescribable implements; also a note-book, a pencil, a small pocket-case of surgical instruments (without which he never moved during his wanderings), and a Testament--the one that had been given to him on his last birthday by his mother.  Old Peter contributed to the general fund his flint, steel, and tinder--most essential and fortunate contributions--and a huge clasp-knife.  Indeed we may omit the mention of knives in this record, for each man possessed one as a matter of course.  It was by no means a matter of course, however, but a subject of intense gratification to at least three of the party, that Muggins had two pipes and an unusually large supply of tobacco.  Larry also had a short black pipe and a picker, besides a crooked sixpence, which he always kept about him \"for luck,\" a long piece of stout twine, and a lump of cheese.  The sum total was not great, but was extremely useful in the circumstances.  All this wealth having been collected together, it was agreed that the biscuits, cheese, tobacco, and pipes should be common property.  They were accordingly divided with the utmost care by Will, who, by the way, did not require a pipe as he was not a smoker.  We do not record this as an evidence of his superior purity!  By no means.  Will Osten, we regret to say, was not a man of strong principle.  All the principle he had, and the good feelings which actuated him, were the result of his mother's teaching--not of his own seeking.  He did not smoke because his mother had discouraged smoking, therefore--not having acquired the habit--he disliked it.  Thousands of men might (and would) have been free from this habit to-day had they been affectionately dissuaded from it in early youth.  So, too, in reference to his Testament--Will always carried it about with him, not because he valued it much for its own sake, or read it often, but because it was the last gift he received from his mother.  It reminded him of her; besides, it was small and did not take up much room in his pocket.  Blessed influence of mothers!  If they only knew the greatness of their power, and were more impressed with the importance of using it for the glory of God, this would be a happier world!  The costume of these wanderers, like their small possessions, was varied.  All wore white duck trousers and blue Guernsey or cotton shirts with sou'-westers or straw hats, but the coats and cravats differed. Larry wore a rough pilot-cloth coat, and, being eccentric on the point, a scarlet cotton neckerchief.  Old Peter wore a blue jacket with a black tie, loosely fastened, sailor fashion, round his exposed throat. Muggins wore the dirty canvas jacket in which he had been engaged in scraping down the masts of the _Rover_ when he left her.  Will Osten happened to have on a dark blue cloth shooting-coat and a white straw hat, which was fortunate, for, being in reality the leader of the party, it was well that his costume should accord with that responsible and dignified position.  They had no weapons of any kind, so their first care was to supply themselves with stout cudgels, which each cut in proportion to his notions of the uses and capacities of such implements--that of Larry O'Hale being, of course, a genuine shillelah, while the weapon cut by Muggins was a close imitation of the club of Hercules, or of that used by the giant who was acquainted with the celebrated giant-killer named Jack!  \"Now, boys, if we're goin' to ait and slaip, the sooner we set about it the better,\" observed Larry, rising and commencing to collect sticks for a fire.  The others immediately followed his example, and in a few minutes a bright blaze illuminated the dark recesses of the tangled forest, while myriads of sparks rose into and hung upon the leafy canopy overhead.  There was something cheering as well as romantic in this.  It caused the wanderers to continue their work with redoubled vigour.  Soon a fire that would have roasted an ox whole roared and sent its forked tongues upwards.  In the warm blaze of it they sat down to their uncommonly meagre supper of half a biscuit and a small bit of cheese each--which was washed down by a draught from a neighbouring stream.  They had finished this, and were in the act of lighting their pipes, when a roar echoed through the woods which caused them to pause in their operations and glance uneasily at each other.  \"Sure, it's a tiger!\" exclaimed Larry.  \"There's "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23274"],["title","Lost in the Forest: Wandering Will's Adventures in South America (#5)"],["body","tigers in them parts,\" said Muggins.  \"I don't know that, lad,\" observed Old Peter.  \"I've hear'd that there are jaguars an' critters o' that sort, which is as big and as bad as tigers, an' goes by the name, but p'raps--\"  Old Peter's observations were here cut short by the loud report of a gun close at hand.  As if by instinct every man leaped away from the light of the fire and sheltered himself behind a tree.  For some time they stood listening eagerly to every sound, but no foe appeared, nor was there a repetition of the shot.  The longer they listened the more inclined were they to believe that their senses had deceived them, and Larry O'Hale's heart was beginning to make a troublesome attack on his ribs, as he thought of ghosts--especially foreign ghosts--when all eyes were attracted to a human form which appeared to flit to and fro among the tree stems in the distance, as if to avoid the strong light of the fire.  Knowing that one man with a gun could make certain of shooting the whole party if he chose, and that he would not be more likely to attempt violence if trust in his generosity were displayed, Will Osten, with characteristic impetuosity, suddenly walked into the full blaze of the firelight and made signals to the stranger to approach.  Larry and the others, although they disapproved of the rashness of their young leader, were not the men to let him face danger alone.  They at once joined him, and awaited the approach of the apparition.  It advanced slowly, taking advantage of every bush and tree, and keeping its piece always pointed towards the fire.  They observed that it was black and partially naked.  Suddenly Muggins exclaimed--\"I do b'lieve it's--\" He paused.  \"Sure, it's the nigger--och! av it isn't Bunco!\" cried Larry.  Bunco it was, sure enough, and the moment he perceived that he was recognised, he discarded all precaution, walked boldly into the encampment, and shook them all heartily by the hand.    CHAPTER SIX.  BUNCO BECOMES A FRIEND IN NEED AND INDEED, AND LARRY \"COMES TO GRIEF\" IN A SMALL WAY.  \"Sure yer face is a sight for sore eyes, though it _is_ black and ugly,\" exclaimed Larry, as he wrung the hand of the good-humoured native, who grinned from ear to ear with delight at having found his friends.  \"Wot ever brought ye here?\" inquired Muggins.  \"Mine legses,\" replied Bunco, with a twinkle in his coal-black eyes.  \"Yer legses, eh?\" repeated Muggins in a tone of sarcasm--\"so I supposes, for it's on them that a man usually goeses; but what caused you for to desart the ship?\"  \"'Cause I no want for be pyrit more nor yourself, Mister Muggles--\"  \"Muggins, you lump of ebony--don't miscall me.\"  \"Well, dat be all same--only a litil bit more ogly,\" retorted Bunco, with a grin, \"an' me no want to lose sight ob Doctor Os'n here: me come for to show him how to go troo de forest.\"  \"That's right, my good fellow,\" cried Will, with a laugh, slapping the native on the shoulder; \"you have just come in the nick of time to take care of us all, for, besides having utterly lost ourselves, we are quite ignorant of forest ways in this region--no better than children, in fact.\"  \"True for ye, boy, riglar babes in the wood, as I said before,\" added Larry O'Hale.  \"Well, that being the case,\" continued Will, \"you had better take command at once, Bunco, and show us how to encamp, for we have finished our pipes and a very light supper, and would fain go to sleep.  It's a pity you did not arrive sooner, my poor fellow, for we have not a scrap of food left for you, and your gun will be of no use till daylight.\"  To this Bunco replied by displaying his teeth and giving vent to a low chuckle, while he lifted the flap of his pea-jacket and exhibited three fat birds hanging at the belt with which he supported his nether garments.  \"Hooray!\" shouted Larry, seizing one of the birds and beginning to pluck it; \"good luck to your black mug, we'll ait it right off.\"  \"That's your sort,\" cried Muggins, whose mouth watered at the thought of such a delightful addition to his poor supper.  \"Hand me one of 'em, Larry, and I'll pluck it.\"  Larry obeyed; Old Peter seized and operated on the last bird, and Bunco raked the embers of the fire together, while Will Osten looked on and laughed.  In a very few minutes the three birds were plucked and cleaned, and Larry, in virtue of his office, was going to cook them, when Will suggested that he had better resign in favour of Bunco, who was doubtless better acquainted than himself with the best modes of forest cookery.  To this Larry objected a little at first, but he was finally prevailed on to give in, and Bunco went to work in his own fashion.  It was simple enough.  First he cut three short sticks and pointed them at each end, then he split each bird open, and laying it flat, thrust a stick through it, and stuck it up before the glowing fire to roast.  When one side was pretty well done he turned the other, and, while that was cooking, cut off a few scraps from the half-roasted side and tried them.  We need scarcely add that none of the party were particular.  The birds were disposed of in an incredibly short time, and then the pipes were refilled for a second smoke.  \"How comes it,\" inquired Will, when this process was going on, \"that you managed to escape and to bring a gun away with you?  We would not have left the ship without you, but our own escape was a sudden affair; we scarcely expected to accomplish it at the time we did.  I suppose you had a sharp run for it?\"  \"Run! ductor, no, me no run--me walk away quite comfrabil an' tooked what me please; see here.\"  As he spoke, Bunco opened a small canvas bag which no one had taken notice of up to that moment, and took from it a large quantity of broken biscuit, a lump of salt beef, several cocoa-nuts, a horn of gunpowder, and a bag of shot and ball--all of which he spread out in front of the fire with much ostentation.  The satisfaction caused by this was very great, and even Muggins, in the fulness of his heart, declared that after all there were worse things than being lost in a forest.  \"Well, and how did you manage to get away?\" said Will, returning to the original question.  \"Git away? why, dis here wos de way.  When me did see the rincumcoshindy goin' on ashore, me say, `Now, Bunco, you time come; look alive;' so, w'en de raskil called de fuss mate orders out de boat in great hurry, me slip into it like one fish.  Then dey all land an' go off like mad into de woods arter you--as you do knows.  Ob coorse me stop to look arter de boat; you knows it would be very bad to go an' leave de boat all by its lone, so w'en deys gone into de woods, me take the mate's gun and poodair an' shot an' ebbery ting could carry off--all de grub, too, but der worn't too moche of dat--and walk away in anoder d'rection.  Me is used to de woods, you sees, so kep' clear o' de stoopid seamans, who soon tires der legses, as me knows bery well; den come round in dis d'rection; find you tracks; foller im up; shoots tree birds; sees a tiger; puts a ball in him skin, an' sends him to bed wid a sore head-- too dark for kill him--arter which me find you out, an' here me is. Dere.  Dat's all about it.\"  \"A most satisfactory account of yourself,\" said Will Osten.  \"An' purtily towld,\" observed Larry; \"where did ye larn English, boy, for ye have the brogue parfict, as me gran'mother used to say to the pig when she got in her dotage (me gran'mother, not the pig), `only,' says she, `the words isn't quite distinc'.'  Couldn't ye give us a skitch o' yer life, Bunco?\"  Thus appealed to, the gratified native began without hesitation, and gave the following account of himself:--  \"Me dun know when me was born--\"  \"Faix, it wasn't yesterday,\" said Larry, interrupting.  \"No, nor de day before to-morrow nother,\" retorted Bunco; \"but it was in Callyforny, anyhow.  Me fadder him wos a Injin--\"  \"Oh! come!\" interrupted Muggins in a remonstrative tone.  \"Yis, him _wos_ a Injin,\" repeated Bunco stoutly.  \"Wos he a _steam-ingine_?\" inquired Muggins with a slight touch of sarcasm.  \"He means an Indian, Muggins,\" explained Will.  \"Then why don't he say wot he means?  However, go ahead, Ebony.\"  \"Hims wos a Injin,\" resumed Bunco, \"ant me moder him wos a Spanish half-breed from dis yer country--Peru.  Me live for years in de forests an' plains an' mountains ob Callyforny huntin' an fightin'.  Oh, dem were de happy days!  After dat me find a wife what I lub berry moche, den me leave her for short time an' go wid tradin' party to de coast. Here meet wid a cap'n of ship, wot wos a big raskil.  Him 'tice me aboord an' sail away.  Short ob hands him wos, so him took me, an' me never see me wife no more!\"  There was something quite touching in the tone in which the poor fellow said this, insomuch that Larry became sympathetic and abused the captain who had kidnapped him in no measured terms.  Had Larry known that acts similar to this wicked and heartless one were perpetrated by traders in the South Seas very frequently, he would have made his terms of abuse more general!  \"How long ago was that?\" inquired Old Peter.  \"Tree year,\" sighed Bunco.  \"Since dat day I hab bin in two tree ships, but nebber run away, cause why? wot's de use ob run away on _island_? Only now me got on Sout 'Meriky, which me know is not far from Nord 'Meriky, an' me bin here before wid me moder, so kin show you how to go--and speak Spanish too--me moder speak dat, you sees; but mesilf larn English aboord two tree ships, an', so, speak him fust rate now.\"  \"So ye do, boy,\" said Larry, whose sympathetic heart was drawn towards the unfortunate and ill-used native; \"an', faix, we'll go on travellin' through this forest till we comes to Callyforny an' finds your missus-- so cheer up, Bunco, and let us see how we're to go to roost, for it seems that we must slaip on a tree this night.\"  During the course of the conversation which we have just detailed, the wild denizens of the forest had been increasing"]]]
