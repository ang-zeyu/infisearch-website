Behind the desk the doctor smiled down at James Wheatley through thick glasses. \"Now, then! What seems to be the trouble?\"  Wheatley had been palpitating for five days straight at the prospect of coming here. \"I know it's silly,\" he said. \"But I've been having a pain in my toe.\"  \"Indeed!\" said the doctor. \"Well, now! How long have you had this pain, my man?\"  \"About six months now, I'd say. Just now and then, you know. It's never really been bad. Until last week. You see--\"  \"I see,\" said the doctor. \"Getting worse all the time, you say.\"  Wheatley wiggled the painful toe reflectively. \"Well--you might say that. You see, when I first--\"  \"How old did you say you were, Mr. Wheatley?\"  \"Fifty-five.\"  \"Fifty-_five_!\" The doctor leafed through the medical record on his desk. \"But this is incredible. You haven't had a checkup in almost ten years!\"  \"I guess I haven't,\" said Wheatley, apologetically. \"I'd been feeling pretty well until--\"  \"_Feeling_ well!\" The doctor stared in horror. \"But my dear fellow, no checkup since January 1963! We aren't in the Middle Ages, you know. This is 1972.\"  \"Well, of course--\"  \"Of course you may be _feeling_ well enough, but that doesn't mean everything is just the way it should be. And now, you see, you're having pains in your toes!\"  \"One toe,\" said Wheatley. \"The little one on the right. It seemed to me--\"  \"One toe _today_, perhaps,\" said the doctor heavily. \"But _tomorrow_--\" He heaved a sigh. \"How about your breathing lately? Been growing short of breath when you hurry upstairs?\"  \"Well--I _have_ been bothered a little.\"  \"I thought so! Heart pound when you run for the subway? Feel tired all day? Pains in your calves when you walk fast?\"  \"Uh--yes, occasionally, I--\" Wheatley looked worried and rubbed his toe on the chair leg.  \"You know that fifty-five is a dangerous age,\" said the doctor gravely. \"Do you have a cough? Heartburn after dinner? Prop up on pillows at night? Just as I thought! And no checkup for ten years!\" He sighed again.  \"I suppose I should have seen to it,\" Wheatley admitted. \"But you see, it's just that my toe--\"  \"My dear fellow! Your toe is _part_ of you. It doesn't just exist down there all by itself. If your _toe_ hurts, there must be a _reason_.\"  Wheatley looked more worried than ever. \"There must? I thought--perhaps you could just give me a little something--\"  \"To stop the pain?\" The doctor looked shocked. \"Well, of course I could _do_ that, but that's not getting at the root of the trouble, is it? That's just treating symptoms. Medieval quackery. Medicine has advanced a long way since your last checkup, my friend. And even treatment has its dangers. Did you know that more people died last year of _aspirin_ poisoning than of _cyanide_ poisoning?\"  Wheatley wiped his forehead. \"I--dear me! I never realized--\"  \"We have to _think_ about those things,\" said the doctor. \"Now, the problem here is to find out _why_ you have the pain in your toe. It could be inflammatory. Maybe a tumor. Perhaps it could be, uh, functional ... or maybe vascular!\"  \"Perhaps you could take my blood pressure, or something,\" Wheatley offered.  \"Well, of course I _could_. But that isn't really my field, you know. It wouldn't really _mean_ anything, if I did it. But there's nothing to worry about. We have a fine Hypertensive man at the Diagnostic Clinic.\" The doctor checked the appointment book on his desk. \"Now, if we could see you there next Monday morning at nine--\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Very interesting X rays,\" said the young doctor with the red hair. \"_Very_ interesting. See this shadow in the duodenal cap? See the prolonged emptying time? And I've never seen such beautiful pylorospasm!\"  \"This is my toe?\" asked Wheatley, edging toward the doctors. It seemed he had been waiting for a very long time.  \"Toe! Oh, no,\" said the red-headed doctor. \"No, that's the Orthopedic Radiologist's job. I'm a Gastro-Intestinal man, myself. Upper. Dr. Schultz here is Lower.\" The red-headed doctor turned back to his consultation with Dr. Schultz. Mr. Wheatley rubbed his toe and waited.  Presently another doctor came by. He looked very grave as he sat down beside Wheatley. \"Tell me, Mr. Wheatley, have you had an orthodiagram recently?\"  \"No.\"  \"An EKG?\"  \"No.\"  \"Fluoroaortogram?\"  \"I--don't _think_ so.\"  The doctor looked even graver, and walked away, muttering to himself. In a few moments he came back with two more doctors. \"--no question in _my_ mind that it's cardiomegaly,\" he was saying, \"but Haddonfield should know. He's the best Left Ventricle man in the city. Excellent paper in the AMA Journal last July: 'The Inadequacies of Modern Orthodiagramatic Techniques in Demonstrating Minimal Left Ventricular Hypertrophy.' A brilliant study, simply brilliant! Now _this_ patient--\" He glanced toward Wheatley, and his voice dropped to a mumble.  Presently two of the men nodded, and one walked over to Wheatley, cautiously, as though afraid he might suddenly vanish. \"Now, there's nothing to be worried about, Mr. Wheatley,\" he said. \"We're going to have you fixed up in just no time at all. Just a few more studies. Now, if you could see me in Valve Clinic tomorrow afternoon at three--\"  Wheatley nodded. \"Nothing serious, I hope?\"  \"Serious? Oh, no! Dear me, you _mustn't_ worry. Everything is going to be all right,\" the doctor said.  \"Well--I--that is, my toe is still bothering me some. It's not nearly as bad, but I wondered if maybe you--\"  Dawn broke on the doctor's face. \"Give you something for it? Well now, we aren't Therapeutic men, you understand. Always best to let the expert handle the problem in his own field.\" He paused, stroking his chin for a moment. \"Tell you what we'll do. Dr. Epstein is one of the finest Therapeutic men in the city. He could take care of you in a jiffy. We'll see if we can't arrange an appointment with him after you've seen me tomorrow.\"  Mr. Wheatley was late to Mitral Valve Clinic the next day because he had gone to Aortic Valve Clinic by mistake, but finally he found the right waiting room. A few hours later he was being thumped, photographed, and listened to. Substances were popped into his right arm, and withdrawn from his left arm as he marveled at the brilliance of modern medical techniques. Before they were finished he had been seen by both the Mitral men and the Aortic men, as well as the Great Arteries man and the Peripheral Capillary Bed man.  The Therapeutic man happened to be in Atlantic City at a convention and the Rheumatologist was on vacation, so Wheatley was sent to Functional Clinic instead. \"Always have to rule out these things,\" the doctors agreed. \"Wouldn't do much good to give you medicine if your trouble isn't organic, now, would it?\" The Psychoneuroticist studied his sex life, while the Psychosociologist examined his social milieu. Then they conferred for a long time.  Three days later he was waiting in the hallway downstairs again. Heads met in a huddle; words and phrases slipped out from time to time as the discussion grew heated.  \"--no doubt in my mind that it's a--\"  \"But we can't ignore the endocrine implications, doctor--\"  \"You're perfectly right there, of course. Bittenbender at the University might be able to answer the question. No better Pituitary Osmoreceptorologist in the city--\"  \"--a Tubular Function man should look at those kidneys first. He's fifty-five, you know.\"  \"--has anyone studied his filtration fraction?\"  \"--might be a peripheral vascular spasticity factor--\"  After a while James Wheatley rose from the bench and slipped out the door, limping slightly as he went.         *       *       *       *       *  The room was small and dusky, with heavy Turkish drapes obscuring the dark hallway beyond. A suggestion of incense hung in the air.  In due course a gaunt, swarthy man in mustache and turban appeared through the curtains and bowed solemnly. \"You come with a problem?\" he asked, in a slight accent.  \"As a matter of fact, yes,\" James Wheatley said hesitantly. \"You see, I've been having a pain in my right little toe....\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22869"],["title","The Dark Door (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _The Counterfeit Man More Science     Fiction Stories by Alan E.

The  Dark  Door     1   It was almost dark when he awoke, and lay on the bed, motionless and trembling, his heart sinking in the knowledge that he should never have slept. For almost half a minute, eyes wide with fear, he lay in the silence of the gloomy room, straining to hear some sound, some indication of their presence.  But the only sound was the barely audible hum of his wrist watch and the dismal splatter of raindrops on the cobbled street outside. There was no sound to feed his fear, yet he knew then, without a flicker of doubt, that they were going to kill him.  He shook his head, trying to clear the sleep from his brain as he turned the idea over and over in his mind. He wondered why he hadn't realized it before, long before, back when they had first started this horrible, nerve-wracking cat-and-mouse game. The idea just hadn't occurred to him. But he knew the game-playing was over. They wanted to kill him now. And he knew that ultimately they _would_ kill him. There was no way for him to escape.  He sat up on the edge of the bed, painfully, perspiration standing out on his bare back, and he waited, listening. How could he have slept, exposing himself so helplessly? Every ounce of his energy, all the skill and wit and shrewdness at his command were necessary in this cruel hunt; yet he had taken the incredibly terrible chance of sleeping, of losing consciousness, leaving himself wide open and helpless against the attack which he knew was inevitable.  How much had he lost? How close had they come while he slept?  Fearfully, he walked to the window, peered out, and felt his muscles relax a little. The gray, foggy streets were still light. He still had a little time before the terrible night began.  He stumbled across the small, old-fashioned room, sensing that action of some sort was desperately needed. The bathroom was tiny; he stared in the battered, stained reflector unit, shocked at the red-eyed stubble-faced apparition that stared back at him.  This is Harry Scott, he thought, thirty-two years old, and in the prime of life, but not the same Harry Scott who started out on a ridiculous quest so many months ago. This Harry Scott was being hunted like an animal, driven by fear, helpless, and sure to die, unless he could find an escape, somehow. But there were too many of them for him to escape, and they were too clever, and they _knew_ he knew too much.  He stepped into the shower-shave unit, trying to relax, to collect his racing thoughts. Above all, he tried to stay the fear that burned through his mind, driving him to panic and desperation. The memory of the last hellish night was too stark to allow relaxation--the growing fear, the silent, desperate hunt through the night; the realization that their numbers were increasing; his frantic search for a hiding place in the New City; and finally his panic-stricken, pell-mell flight down into the alleys and cobbled streets and crumbling frame buildings of the Old City.... Even more horrible, the friends who had turned on him, who turned out to be _like_ them.  Back in the bedroom, he lay down again, his body still tense. There were sounds in the building, footsteps moving around on the floor overhead, a door banging somewhere. With every sound, every breath of noise, his muscles tightened still further, freezing him in fear. His own breath was shallow and rapid in his ears as he lay, listening, waiting.  If only something would happen! He wanted to scream, to bang his head against the wall, to run about the room smashing his fist into doors, breaking every piece of furniture. It was the _waiting_, the eternal waiting, and running, waiting some more, feeling the net drawing tighter and tighter as he waited, feeling the measured, unhurried tread behind him, always following, coming closer and closer, as though he were a mouse on a string, twisting and jerking helplessly.  If only they would move, do something he could counter.  But he wasn't even sure any more that he could detect them. And they were so careful never to move into the open.  He jumped up feverishly, moved to the window, and peered between the slats of the dusty, old-fashioned blind at the street below.  An empty street at first, wet, gloomy. He saw no one. Then he caught the flicker of light in an entry several doors down and across the street, as a dark figure sparked a cigarette to life. Harry felt the chill run down his back again. Still there, then, still waiting, a hidden figure, always present, always waiting....  Harry's eyes scanned the rest of the street rapidly. Two three-wheelers rumbled by, their rubber hissing on the wet pavement. One of them carried the blue-and-white of the Old City police, but the car didn't slow up or hesitate as it passed the dark figure in the doorway. They would never help me anyway, Harry thought bitterly. He had tried that before, and met with ridicule and threats. There would be no help from the police in the Old City.  Another figure came around a corner. There was something vaguely familiar about the tall body and broad shoulders as the man walked across the wet street, something Harry faintly recognized from somewhere during the spinning madness of the past few weeks.  The man's eyes turned up toward the window for the briefest instant, then returned steadfastly to the street. Oh, they were sly! You could never spot them looking at you, never for _sure_, but they were always there, always nearby. And there was no one he could trust any longer, no one to whom he could turn.  Not even George Webber.  Swiftly his mind reconsidered that possibility as he watched the figure move down the street. True, Dr. Webber had started him out on this search in the first place. But even Webber would never believe what he had found. Webber was a scientist, a researcher.  What could he do--go to Webber and tell him that there were men alive in the world who were _not_ men, who were somehow men and something more?  Could he walk into Dr. Webber's office in the Hoffman Medical Center, walk through the gleaming bright corridors, past the shining metallic doors, and tell Dr. Webber that he had found people alive in the world who could actually see in four dimensions, live in four dimensions, _think_ in four dimensions?  Could he explain to Dr. Webber that he knew this simply because in some way he had sensed them, and traced them, and discovered them; that he had not one iota of proof, except that he was being followed by them, hunted by them, even now, in a room in the Old City, waiting for them to strike him down?  He shook his head, almost sobbing. That was what was so horrible. He couldn't tell Webber, because Webber would be certain that he had gone mad, just like the rest. He couldn't tell anyone, he couldn't do anything. He could just wait, and run, and wait--  It was almost dark now and the creaking of the old board house intensified the fear that tore at Harry Scott's mind. Tonight was the night; he was sure of it. Maybe he had been foolish in coming here to the slum area, where the buildings were relatively unguarded, where anybody could come and go as he pleased. But the New City had hardly been safer, even in the swankiest private chamber in the highest building. They had had agents there, too, hunting him, driving home the bitter lesson of fear they had to teach him. Now he was afraid enough; now they were ready to kill him.  Down below he heard a door bang, and he froze, his back against the wall. There were footsteps, quiet voices, barely audible. His whole body shook and his eyes slid around to the window. The figure in the doorway still waited--but the other figure was not visible. He heard the steps on the stair, ascending slowly, steadily, a tread that paced itself with the powerful throbbing of his own pulse.  Then the telephone screamed out--  Harry gasped. The footsteps were on the floor below, moving steadily upward. The telephone rang again and again; the shrill jangling filled the room insistently. He waited until he couldn't wait any longer. His hand fumbled in a pocket and leveled a tiny, dull-gray metal object at the door. With the other hand, he took the receiver from the hook.  \"Harry! Is that you?\"  His throat was like sandpaper and the words came out in a rasp. \"What is it?\"  \"Harry, this is George--George Webber.\"  His eyes were glued to the door. \"All right. What do you want?\"  \"You've got to come talk to us, Harry. We've been waiting for weeks now. You promised us. We've _got_ to talk to you.\"  Harry still watched the door, but his breath came easier. The footsteps moved with ridiculous slowness up the stairs, down the hall toward the room.  \"What do you want me to do? They've come to kill me.\"  There was a long pause. \"Harry, are you sure?\"  \"Dead sure.\"  \"Can you make a break for it?\"  Harry blinked. \"I could try. But it won't do any good.\"  \"Well, at least try, Harry. Get here to the Hoffman Center. We'll help you all we can.\"  \"I'll try.\" Harry's words were hardly audible as he set the receiver down with a trembling hand.  The room was silent. The footsteps had stopped. A wave of panic passed up Harry's spine; he crossed the room, threw open the door, stared up and down the hall, unbelieving.  The hall was empty. He started down toward the stairs at a dead run, and then, too late, saw the faint golden glow of a Parkinson Field across the dingy corridor. He gasped in fear, and screamed out once as he struck it.  And then, for seconds stretching into hours, he heard his scream echoing and re-echoing down long, bitter miles of hollow corridor.     2   George Webber leaned back in the soft chair,"]]]
