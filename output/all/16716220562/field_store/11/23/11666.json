As soon as they were gone I began to collect my thoughts, and to consider my best chance of finding the lost ring.  As I heard Mr Wells say that he would not have lost it for a hundred pounds, I believed that was its value, and though I had no just conception of how much a hundred pounds was, I knew that it must be a great deal of money.  I was therefore very anxious to restore it to the kind gentleman.  Here I benefited by my good mother's instruction; and I believed her spirit watched over me to keep me from evil; for it never occurred to me, as I am sorry to say it did to some of the other boys who overheard the gentleman's observation, that it would be easier if the ring was found to sell it and secure its value, than to trust to the chance of obtaining a small reward by returning it to its proper owner.  I fortunately overheard them plotting to secure the ring for themselves, and I determined to counteract their plan.  Though the water was deep where the ring had fallen there was no current, as it was in a little bay in the bank of the river, and what was more, I remembered that the ground was rather harder than that surrounding it, and that it rose slightly outside.  These circumstances gave me hopes of finding the ring; so I sat down at some little distance on the bank, pretending to be counting the money I had received, but in reality watching narrowly the spot where I thought it had fallen.  I do not mean to say that I was indifferent to my good fortune, but I honestly believe I thought much more of the pleasure it would give the poor people who had charitably taken care of me in my destitution, than of the benefit I should myself derive from it.  The tide had only run off a very little when the ring was thrown in, so that I had a considerable time to wait; but though I grew very hungry, and felt that I might enjoy a plentiful meal, I would not quit my post; indeed, I was accustomed to starve, so that did not incommode me much.  Slowly the tide receded, and one after one the other boys went away.  At last the bank appeared, and the intervening space was left with very little water over it.  I was in hopes that none of the other boys would return to interrupt me in my search; but, to my annoyance, just as the mud was left quite clear, two of them came back, and immediately tucking up their trousers, hurried into the mud.    CHAPTER TWO.  NEW FRIENDS.  Now it so happened that I had carefully noted where the penny had fallen, and if I had been alone, I could have gone straight to the place.  But, wishing to mislead my rivals in the search, I waded into the water at a considerable distance from the spot.  Glad of a clue, the other mud-larks came over to me in a hurry, and began hunting about. Leaving them there, I went to another place, and so on till I gradually approached the spot where I thought the ring had fallen.  They again followed me, and as I was stooping down I heard one of them cry out, and I thought he had found the treasure, but it was only the penny Mr Wells had thrown me.  \"Ho! ho!\"  I thought, \"the ring will not have reached as far as that, but I must make haste and find it, or it will be too dark to see anything.\"  The other boys thought the ring must be close to the penny, and kept turning up the mud in every direction round it, while I worked my way straight on to where the boat had been.  I had begun to think that I must have passed it, when I saw something glitter in a little pool of water just under a large stone.  I stooped down, and to my joy I found that it was the gold ring.  My first impulse was to sing out, but then it struck me that I might run some chance of being robbed of my treasure, and that it would be a just punishment to the naughty boys to keep them still hunting for it; so, instead of saying anything about the matter, I pretended to be groping on as before, and at last, on getting near the shore, I exclaimed that there was no chance of any one finding it that night, and that I should go home.  On getting on shore I ran as fast as my legs would carry me, eager to give my charitable friends an account of my good fortune, but with regard to the ring I said not a word.  The instinctive caution I possessed taught me that it would be wiser to say nothing, even to them, about it.  I told them, as was the case, that the money had been given to me by the gentlemen for repeating poetry to them.  We had a capital supper that night, the best I had ever enjoyed; and giving my wealth to my friends to keep for me, I set off the next morning, my heart beating high with satisfaction, to restore the ring to Mr Wells.  I found his house without much difficulty, although I had never been in that part of London before, but my wits were not at fault on this occasion more than on any other.  A domestic opened the door, whom I at first took to be a very great lord, for I had seldom before seen a livery servant; but when he told me that his master was not at home, and he could not say when he would return, and without deigning any further answer slammed the door in my face, I guessed who he was.  I accordingly sat down on the steps to wait patiently for the return of Mr Wells.  As I had been thinking all night long of my good fortune, I had not slept a wink, and it was therefore not surprising that I fell very fast asleep where I sat.  How long I thus remained dreaming of the events of the previous day I do not know, when I was awaked by the sound of a kind voice in my ear, and opening my eyes I saw Mr Wells standing before me.  \"Ah, my little poet!\" he exclaimed; \"you here already!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" I answered, jumping up; \"and I have found your ring, and brought it to you too.\"  \"Have you indeed?  That is more than I expected,\" he replied.  \"But come in, and you can then give me the ring, and tell me something about yourself.\"  So I went into his house, and he was evidently pleased when he saw the ring, which I had washed and wrapped up carefully in a bit of rag, and it looked clean and bright.  He then took me into the parlour, where two ladies were sitting at breakfast, where he made me join them, all untidy as I was, at their meal; after which he desired me to give a full account of myself, and to recite some more poetry, all of which I did, apparently much to the satisfaction of the party present.  \"'Twere a pity for the child to grow up neglected and uncared for, as will probably be his fate, till he becomes in no way superior to the uncultivated, ignorant men among whom he will be doomed to live,\" observed one of the ladies to Mr Wells, who was, I found, his wife. \"Can you do anything for him?\"  \"I was thinking on the subject, my love,\" answered Mr Wells.  \"The question in my mind is, `In what position shall he be placed?'\"  \"Oh, my dear, that is very easy,\" replied the lady, in an eager tone; \"send him to a good school, and then make him one of your clerks.\"  \"That might not prove a real kindness after all,\" said her husband; \"he has already, by his own exertions and good conduct, made one step up the ladder, and I think it will be wiser to leave him to work his own way upward.  He will then be less liable to slip down again.  I will keep an eye on him, and give him advice when he requires it.\"  This I believe he said for my benefit, that I might not fancy that I had nothing further to do than to wait for the coming of good luck, as is the case too often with certain people, who then grumble and find fault with the world because their luck never comes.  I do not mean to say that opportunities do not occur to some men more frequently than to others, but I believe that they visit most of us at some time or other of our lives, and that it is our own fault if we do not take advantage of them.  \"But I will learn what the boy himself has to say on the subject,\" said Mr Wells.--\"What would you like to do, my lad?\"  \"I want to be a sailor, sir,\" I answered, promptly; for such had been the earnest desire of my life; \"I wish to go to some of the places the ships I see passing up and down the river visit.\"  \"You are too young yet to go to sea, but when you are old enough you cannot perhaps do better.  The sea requires people of sense more than any other, and yet some persons send the dunce of the family on board ship, and then are surprised that he does not get on.  You shall now go back to the friends who have taken care of you, and who seem good people.  We must find somebody to whom you may go when you wish to get some more learning, and I dare say you will find some means of earning your bread till you are old enough to go to sea.  \"By-the-by, I must not forget the reward I promised you for finding my ring.  I will bring it down to you to-morrow or next day, if you will in the meantime trust me.\"  He said this smiling, and I felt sure he would not deceive me.  At the same time I told him that he had paid me before handsomely, and that I did not want any other reward.  He told me that must rest with him, and that I was fairly entitled to it.  He then bade me good-bye.  With a joyful heart I returned home to record to my friends all that had happened.  Mr Wells was as good as his word, and the following day I saw him on horseback, inquiring his way to the street where I lived.  I went up to him, and led him to the house.  He then dismounted, and giving his horse to another boy to hold, he called me in, and told my friends that he had spoken to the curate of the parish about me, and that I might go to him two hours every evening after I had done my work.  He then gave me five pounds, advising me to rig myself out neatly; and he told me besides that he had spoken to some of the boatmen in the neighbourhood, who he thought were very likely to employ me if I applied to them.  After a few more words of advice the good gentleman took his departure.  Now Mr Wells was a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],["title","Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#2)"],["body","of sound sense, and his conduct was, I have reason to know, most judicious.  He saw that I was accustomed to act for myself, young as I was, and that I should have less chance of slipping off the ladder, if I mounted each ratlin by myself; and he considered that as I was of somewhat a poetical temperament, if my mind received a hot bed forcing at too early an age, I should be unfitted to struggle on in this every-day working world.  Had he, as his wife recommended him, sent me to a boarding school, where I should have had everything done for me, I should probably very soon have lost that habit of dependence on my own exertions which has been the great cause of my success in life; and the routine style of education I should there have received would certainly not have compensated for the loss of the other advantage, nor would the amount of knowledge I should have gained have been in all probability in any way equal to that I obtained from my evenings' study with the good curate, Mr Hamlin.  Depend upon it, after children are shown what is right, the sooner they are taught self-reliance the better.  It is the principle I have followed out with my own, and they are now independent men, and are grateful to me for it.  I began with them as soon as they were weaned; before that time I did not consider I ought to interfere with my wife. I never let one of them have a meal before he had performed some task for it, nor a new frock or jacket.  Sometimes I would set a week's work, and let them get through it as they liked, provided they had earned their food.  I thus very early found out their characters, and the amount of perseverance and energy they possessed, and managed them accordingly.  They all got through their work in the set time, but in different ways.  One would set to work the moment he knew what he was to do, and toil away till it was completed; another would commence more leisurely, then go to some other occupation or amusement, and then return to his regular labours; a third would take the whole time to complete the undertaking, but it was invariably done well.  I taught my own boys the advantages of industry, and they soon learned to like labour for itself.  They have never been idle, and consequently have never been vicious.  For six or seven years I lived on with my old friends, spending all the day on the river assisting the boatmen to take care of their boats, and, as I grew bigger, in rowing, till I had saved enough money to get a share of a boat myself, while every evening that Mr Hamlin was able to receive me I paid him a visit.  At the time I was fourteen my wish to go to sea, grew stronger than ever, and Mr Wells at once acceded to it, and told me that he would gladly find me a berth in one of his own vessels, for he was, what I forgot before to say, an extensive shipowner.  He advised me to sell my share in the boat, and to invest the amount, with my subsequent savings, in the savings bank, telling me that he had such entire confidence in me that he would gladly advance the money for my outfit.  I was accordingly entered as an apprentice, and made my first voyage, in the good ship the _Mary Jane_, to the Brazils.  The next was round Cape Horn to the coast of Chili and Peru, and on my return I made a trip up the Baltic.  Indeed, for many years I was constantly at sea, during which time I visited various parts of the world.  When I was out of my apprenticeship I began to lay by half of my wages, and then to do a little trading on my own account, by which I made money.  I at last worked my way from before the mast to the quarter-deck, and became third officer of a fine ship trading to the Cape.  I probably should have become master of her in time, but on my return home I fell in love and married.  My wife was young, pretty, and well educated according to my taste--that is to say, she had been brought up at home by a good sensible mother, who never thought of letting her learn to play on the piano, nor to dance, nor any accomplishment useless to one in the rank she appeared destined to fill. Her father was the owner and master of a small trader running between London and Ramsgate.  After I married I made two more trips to the Cape, and on my return from the second I found my father-in-law on the point of death.  He made me promise to remain at home to take care of his widow and daughter, and on these conditions made me over his vessel and the goodwill of his trade.  For some years I followed this line with varied success, but I did not save much money, as my family increased rapidly, and my expenses were proportionably heavy.  I lost a considerable part of my savings through the failure of my poor friend Mr Wells, in whose hands my money was placed; but I did not repine at this on my own account, for I considered that the lessons he had taught me were of far more value than the amount of my wealth, but I grieved deeply that he should be the sufferer.  He was by this time an old man, and his creditors allowed him a comfortable income till his death.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA.  At length my vessel wore out, and I was compelled to build a new one. She was a fine schooner of nearly sixty tons, and was a capital sea boat.  I ran her for about three years, but I found that she was almost too good for the trade she was engaged in.  At this time I met with an old shipmate who had made several trips to New South Wales, or, as it was then called commonly, to Botany Bay, and he gave me glowing accounts of the success of some of the free settlers who had gone out there. This made me think about the subject and set to work to collect information from all the people I met who knew anything about the country.  One and all combined in asserting that it was a very fine country, and that large fortunes were to be made in one way or another, but they chiefly spoke in praise of the fine pastures for sheep which existed.  From what I could pick up, however, I surmised that the sheep in general were of a very inferior quality, and that if some of the best breeds could be introduced, not only would the colony be benefited, but the person who brought them over.  For some weeks I turned the subject in my mind.  I had plenty of time to think about it in my passages up and down the river when obliged to bring up for the tide, and at last I broached it to my wife, and told her that my opinion was that a far better livelihood might be made in the new country than such people as ourselves could hope for in England.  \"You see how it is, my dear Martha,\" I said, \"for many years your good father toiled on in this trade, and though he lived comfortably and brought you up well, he saved no money; and had he met with any reverse like the loss of his vessel the case might have been different, and he might easily have been ruined.  Now, although I have worked harder than he was able to do, and consequently have kept my head above water, with a large family and greater expenses, I also have saved little, and am sadly puzzled to know what to do with our boys, and I shall be unwilling to send our pretty girls out to service; yet if they do not marry I can never expect to leave enough to support them.  \"I have been thinking of a hundred different ways of improving our fortune in England, but not one has occurred to me in which the risk of loss has not been too great.  Thousands of families are exactly in our position, and the fathers must feel that not only have they no chance of rising in the world, but that when they die they must leave their daughters exposed to all the dangers of a life of dependence.  For the boys I fear less; they will if they survive make their own way in life as I have done, and are more fitted to bear its ups and downs.  Now, my dear wife, I know you would be ready to follow me to the end of the world, even if it were to penury or death, but I am not going to ask you to do that.  I am going to propose to go to a far distant land, where I trust we shall not only gain wealth, but happiness and contentment, and see our family happily settled.\"  My wife, as I knew she would be, was ready to enter into my views, though, as she had never been at sea further than Ramsgate, she could not help looking with some dread at the long voyage, and she had read some rather exaggerated accounts of bush-rangers and savages in Botany Bay which were enough to frighten her.  I soon, however, quieted all her fears about the voyage as well as about the savages and bush-rangers, and though I did not conceal from her that there were many difficulties to be overcome, and dangers to be encountered, I pictured the future to her in the bright colours it appeared to my own imagination.  My eldest boy was at sea, but we expected his return every day, and at all events I determined to wait his arrival.  The two next were accustomed to sail with me in the schooner, where I did my beat to give them all the learning I had gained from the good curate, Mr Hamlin, and had since then picked up by my own exertions.  Though they were still boys, they were very useful on board, and could take the helm and work the vessel as well as any grownup man.  I had eight of them, four boys and four girls, and the two youngest were still children.  The elder ones were delighted at my proposal,--the boy, at the thought of making a long sea voyage, of seeing strange lands, and hunting the kangaroo; the girl, at being able to accompany me and their brothers, and having to tend a farm, and live under a bright blue sky.  Whether it entered into the calculation of the eldest that she might be able to pick and choose a husband from the number of young men who were certain to be on the shore with speaking-trumpets to beg her to marry them, I do not pretend to say, but it was then the case as now,--no girl could remain in the colony without being asked to wed every day in the week till she made her choice.  Having made up our minds to go, the next thing "]]]
