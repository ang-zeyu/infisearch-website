But this cave served in reality as a blind.  Climbing by one or two projecting points, the negro, closely followed by Nigel, reached a narrow ledge and walked along it a short distance.  On coming to the end of the ledge he jumped down into a mass of undergrowth, where the track again became visible--winding among great masses of weatherworn lava. Here the ascent became very steep, and Moses put on what sporting men call a spurt, which took him far ahead of Nigel, despite the best efforts of the latter to keep up.  Still our hero scorned to run or call out to his guide to wait, and thereby admit himself beaten.  He pushed steadily on, and managed to keep the active Moses in view.  Presently the negro stepped upon a platform of rock high up on the cliffs, where his form could be distinctly seen against the bright sky. There Nigel observed that he was joined by a man whose tall commanding figure seemed in such a position to be of gigantic proportions.  The two stood engaged in earnest conversation while watching Nigel.  The latter immediately slackened his pace, in order at once to recover breath and approach with a leisurely aspect.  \"The wild man of the island, I suppose,\" he thought as he drew near; but on coming still nearer he saw that he must be mistaken, for the stranger who advanced to meet him with gracious ease and self-possession was obviously a gentleman, and dressed, not unlike himself, in a sort of mixed travelling and shooting costume.  \"I must apologise, Mr Roy, for the presumption of my man, in bringing you here under something like false pretences,\" said the stranger, holding out his hand, which Nigel shook heartily.  \"Moses, I find, has failed to execute my commission, and has partially deceived you; but as you are now here, the least I can do is to bid you welcome, and offer you the hospitality of my roof.\"  There was something so courteous and kindly in the tone and manner of the stranger, and something so winning in his soft gentle tones, which contrasted strangely with his grand towering figure and massive bearded countenance, that Nigel felt drawn to him instantly.  Indeed there was a peculiar and mysterious something about him which quite fascinated our hero as he looked up at him, for, bordering on six feet though Nigel was, the stranger stood several inches above him.  \"You are very kind,\" said the visitor, \"and I don't think that Moses can fairly be charged with deceiving me, although he has been somewhat unwise in his way of going about this business, for I had told him I wanted to see something of these regions, and perhaps it may be to my advantage to travel in your service--that is, if I can be of any use to you; but the time at my disposal may be too limited.\"  \"How much time have you to spare?\" asked the stranger.  \"Well, say perhaps three months.\"  \"That will do,\" returned his questioner, looking thoughtfully at the ground.  \"We will talk of this hereafter.\"  \"But--excuse me,\" said Nigel, \"your man spoke of you as a hermit--a sort of--of--forgive me--a wild-man-of-the-island, if I may--\"  \"No, I didn't, Massa Nadgel,\" said the negro, the edge of whose flat contradiction was taken off by the extreme humility of his look.  \"Well,\" returned Nigel, with a laugh; \"you at least gave me to understand that other people said something of that sort.\"  \"Da's right, Massa Nadgel--kite right.  You're k'rect _now_.\"  \"People have indeed got some strange ideas about me, I believe,\" interposed the hermit, with a grave almost sad expression and tone. \"But come, let me introduce you to my hermitage and you shall judge for yourself.\"  So saying, this singular being turned and led the way further up the rugged side of the peak of Rakata.  After about five minutes' walk in silence, the trio reached a spot where there was a clear view over the tree-tops, revealing the blue waters of the strait, with the Java shores and mountains in the distance.  Behind them there yawned, dark and mysterious, a mighty cavern, so black and high that it might well suggest a portal leading to the regions below, where Vulcan is supposed to stir those tremendous fires which have moulded much of the configuration of the world, and which are ever seething--an awful Inferno--under the thin crust of the globe on which we stand.  Curiously-formed and large-leaved trees of the tropics, with their pendent parasites, as well as rank grasses, sprouting from below and hanging from above, partially concealed this cavern from Nigel when he first turned towards it, but a few steps further on he could see it in all its rugged grandeur.  \"My home,\" said the hermit, with a very slight smile and the air of a prince, as he turned towards his visitor and waved his hand towards it.  \"A magnificent entrance at all events,\" said Nigel, returning the smile with something of dubiety, for he was not quite sure that his host was in earnest.  \"Follow me,\" said the hermit, leading the way down a narrow well-worn path which seemed to lose itself in profound darkness.  After being a few minutes within the cavern, however, Nigel's eyes became accustomed to the dim light, and he perceived that the roof rapidly lowered, while its walls narrowed until they reached a spot which was not much wider than an ordinary corridor.  Here, however, it was so dark that it was barely possible to see a small door in the right-hand wall before which they halted.  Lifting a latch the hermit threw the door wide open, and a glare of dazzling light almost blinded the visitor.  Passing through the entrance, Nigel followed his guide, and the negro let the heavy door shut behind him with a clang that was depressingly suggestive of a prison.  \"Again I bid you welcome to my home,\" said the hermit, turning round and extending his hand, which Nigel mechanically took and pressed, but without very well knowing what he did, for he was almost dumfounded by what he saw, and for some minutes gazed in silence around him.  And, truly, there was ground for surprise.  The visitor found himself in a small but immensely high and brilliantly lighted cavern or natural chamber, the walls of which were adorned with drawings of scenery and trees and specimens of plants, while on various shelves stood innumerable stuffed birds, and shells, and other specimens of natural history.  A table and two chairs stood at one end of the cave, and, strangest of all, a small but well-filled book-case ornamented the other end.  \"Arabian Nights!\" thought Nigel.  \"I _must_ be dreaming.\"  His wandering eyes travelled slowly round the cavern until they rested at last on the door by which they had entered, beside which stood the negro with a broad grin on his sable visage.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  WONDERS OF THE HERMIT'S CAVE AND ISLAND.  The thing that perhaps surprised Nigel most in this strange cavern was the blaze of light with which it was filled, for it came down direct through a funnel-shaped hole in the high roof and bore a marvellous resemblance to natural sunshine.  He was well aware that unless the sun were shining absolutely in the zenith, the laws of light forbade the entrance of a _direct_ ray into such a place, yet there were the positive rays, although the sun was not yet high in the heavens, blinding him while he looked at them, and casting the shadows of himself and his new friends on the floor.  There was the faintest semblance of a smile on the hermit's face as he quietly observed his visitor, and waited till he should recover self-possession.  As for Moses--words are wanting to describe the fields of teeth and gum which he displayed, but no sound was suffered to escape his magnificent lips, which closed like the slide of a dark lantern when the temptation to give way to feeling became too strong.  \"My cave interests you,\" said the hermit at last.  \"It amazes me,\" returned our hero, recovering himself and looking earnestly at his host, \"for you seem not only to have all the necessaries of life around you in your strange abode, but many of the luxuries; among them the cheering presence of sunshine--though how you manage to get it is beyond my powers of conception.\"  \"It is simple enough, as you shall see,\" returned the hermit.  \"You have heard of the saying, no doubt, that `all things are possible to well-directed labour?'\"  \"Yes, and that `nothing can be achieved without labour.'\"  \"Well, I have proved that to some extent,\" continued the hermit.  \"You see, by the various and miscellaneous implements on my shelves, that I am given to dabbling a little in science, and thus have made my lonely home as pleasant as such a home can be--but let us not talk of these matters just now.  You must be hungry.  Have you had breakfast?\"  \"No, we have not--unless, at least, you count a sea biscuit dipped in salt water a breakfast.  After all, that may well be the case, for hermits are noted for the frugality of their fare.\"  \"I am not a genuine hermit,\" remarked his host gravely.  \"Men do indeed call me the Hermit of Rakata, because I dwell alone here under the shadow of this particular cone of Krakatoa, but I do not ape the austere life of the conventional hermit, as you see, either in my domestic arrangements or food.  Come, your breakfast is ready.  From my outlook I saw your boat approaching some hours ago, and knew that it was mine, so I made ready for your arrival, though I did not guess that Moses was bringing me a guest instead of a servant!\"  So saying, he led the way through a short natural passage to an inner cave, the entrance to which, like the outer one, was boarded.  On opening a small door, Nigel was again greeted as before with brilliant rays of sunshine, and, in addition, with a gush of odours that were exceedingly grateful to a hungry man.  A low \"Ho!

Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________  Here once again Ballantyne is on familiar ground.  The theme is the trials and tribulations suffered by the early settlers, the pioneers, in the lands to the east of the Rockies, in particular in the Red River basin, where it flows northwards into Lake Winnipeg.  There are problems with bad men of their own settlement; bad men from the other main fur company (our heroes worked with the Hudson Bay Company), the Nor'westers; Sioux and Salteaux Indians; a plague of grass-hoppers; a plague of mice; storms that destroyed fishing-gear such as nets; Cree Indians as well as the other two tribes; bad decisions and actions by the advisors of Lord Selkirk, who was in charge of the whole operation of settlement; accidental wounds.  The heroes of the tale are two young boys, one of whom is \"disabled\" and weak, but both are shining examples of goodness and bravery.  The women of the tale are of course all beautiful and devoted members of their various households.  The men of the tale vary between the competent and the incompetent; the lazy and idle, and the industrious;  the cunning, and the stupid.  It might be quite a good idea to read the book more than once, so that you can get it clear in your mind who is on whose side!  ________________________________________________________________________  THE BUFFALO RUNNERS; A TALE OF THE RED RIVER PLAINS, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  A TALE OF THE RED RIVER PLAINS.  HELP!  A blizzard was blowing wildly over the American prairies one winter day in the earlier part of the present century.  Fresh, free and straight, it came from the realms of Jack Frost, and cold--bitterly cold--like the bergs on the Arctic seas, to which it had but recently said farewell.  Snow, fine as dust and sharp as needles, was caught up bodily by the wind in great masses--here in snaky coils, there in whirling eddies, elsewhere in rolling clouds; but these had barely time to assume indefinite forms when they were furiously scattered and swept away as by the besom of destruction, while earth and sky commingled in a smother of whitey-grey.  All the demons of the Far North seemed to have taken an outside passage on that blizzard, so tremendous was the roaring and shrieking, while the writhing of tormented snow-drifts suggested powerfully the madness of agony.  Two white and ghostly pillars moved slowly but steadily through all this hurly-burly in a straight line.  One of the pillars was short and broad; the other was tall and stately.  Both were very solid--agreeably so, when contrasted with surrounding chaos.  Suddenly the two pillars stopped--though the gale did not.  Said the short pillar to the tall one--  \"Taniel Tavidson, if we will not get to the Settlement this night; it iss my belief that every one o' them will perish.\"  \"Fergus,\" replied the tall pillar, sternly, \"they shall _not_ perish if I can help it.  At all events, if they do, I shall die in the attempt to save them.  Come on.\"  Daniel Davidson became less like a white pillar as he spoke, and more like a man, by reason of his shaking a good deal of the snow off his stalwart person.  Fergus McKay followed his comrade's example, and revealed the fact--for a few minutes--that beneath the snow-mask there stood a young man with a beaming countenance of fiery red, the flaming character of which, however, was relieved by an expression of ineffable good-humour.  The two men resumed their march over the dreary plain in silence. Indeed, conversation in the circumstances was out of the question.  The brief remarks that had been made when they paused to recover breath were howled at each other while they stood face to face.  The nature of the storm was such that the gale seemed to rush at the travellers from all quarters at once--including above and below.  Men of less vigour and resolution would have been choked by it; but men who don't believe in choking, and have thick necks, powerful frames, vast experience, and indomitable wills are not easily choked!  \"It blows hard--whatever,\" muttered Fergus to himself, with that prolonged emphasis on the last syllable of the last word which is eminently suggestive of the Scottish Highlander.  Davidson may have heard the remark, but he made no reply.  Day declined, but its exit was not marked by much difference in the very feeble light, and the two men held steadily on.  The moon came out.  As far as appearances went she might almost as well have stayed in, for nobody saw her that night.  Her mere existence somewhere in the sky, however, rendered the indescribable chaos visible.  Hours passed by, but still the two men held on their way persistently.  They wore five-feet-long snow-shoes.  Progress over the deep snow without these would have been impossible.  One traveller walked behind the other to get the benefit of his beaten track, but the benefit was scarcely appreciable, for the whirling snow filled each footstep up almost as soon as it was made.  Two days and a night had these men travelled with but an hour or two of rest in the shelter of a copse, without fire, and almost without food, yet they pushed on with the energy of fresh and well-fed men.  Nothing but some overpowering necessity could have stimulated them to such prolonged and severe exertion.  Even self-preservation might have failed to nerve them to it, for both had well-nigh reached the limit of their exceptional powers, but each was animated by a stronger motive than self.  Fergus had left his old father in an almost dying state on the snow-clad plains, and Davidson had left his affianced bride.  The buffalo-hunt had failed that year; winter had set in with unwonted severity and earlier than usual.  The hunters, with the women and children who followed them in carts to help and to reap the benefit of the hunt, were starving.  Their horses died or were frozen to death; carts were snowed up; and the starving hunters had been scattered in making the best of their way back to the Settlement of Red River from which they had started.  When old McKay broke down, and his only daughter Elspie had firmly asserted her determination to remain and die with him, Fergus McKay and Daniel Davidson felt themselves to be put upon their mettle--called on to face a difficulty of the most appalling nature.  To remain on the snow-clad prairie without food or shelter would be death to all, for there was no living creature there to be shot or trapped.  On the other hand, to travel a hundred miles or so on foot--and without food, seemed an impossibility.  Love, however, ignores the impossible!  The two young men resolved on the attempt.  They were pretty well aware of the extent of their physical powers.  They would put them fairly to the test for once--even though for the last time!  They prepared for the old man and his daughter a shelter in the heart of a clump of willows, near to which spot they had found a group of the hapless hunters already dead and frozen.  Here, as far from the frozen group as possible, they made an encampment by digging down through the snow till the ground was reached.  As much dried wood as could be found was collected, and a fire made.  The young men left their blankets behind, and, of the small quantity of provisions that remained, they took just sufficient to sustain life.  Then, with cheery words of encouragement, they said good-bye, and set out on their journey to the Settlement for help.  The object at which they aimed was almost gained at the point when we introduce them to the reader.  \"Taniel!\" said Fergus, coming to a sudden halt.  \"Well?\" exclaimed the other.  \"It iss sleepy that I am.  Maybe if I wass to lie down--\"  He ceased to speak.  Davidson looked anxiously into his face, and saw that he had already begun to give way to irresistible drowsiness. Without a moment's hesitation he seized the Highlander by the throat, and shook him as if he had been a mere baby.  \"Iss it for fightin' ye are?\" said Fergus, whose good-nature was not proof against such rough and unexpected treatment.  \"Yes, my boy, that's just what I am for, and I think you'll get the worst of it too.\"  \"What iss that you say?  Ay, ay!  You will hev to bend your back then, Taniel, for it iss not every wan that can give Fergus McKay the worst of it!\"  Davidson made no reply, but gave his comrade a shake so violent that it put to flight the last vestige of his good-humour and induced him to struggle so fiercely that in a few minutes the drowsiness was also, and effectually, driven away.  \"You'll do now,\" said Davidson, relaxing his grip and panting somewhat.  \"Ay, Taniel, I will be doin' now.  An' you're a frund in need whatever,\" returned the restored Highlander with a smile of appreciation.  About an hour later the travellers again stopped.  This time it was Davidson who called a halt.  \"Fergus,\" he said, \"we have been successful so far, thank God.  But we must part here.  Half-an-hour will take me to my father's house, and I want you to go down to the hut of Francois La Certe; it is nearer than our house, you know--and get him to help you.\"  \"Surely, Tan, that will be wasted time,\" objected the Highlander.  \"Of all the lazy useless scamps in Rud Ruver, Francois La Certe iss the laziest an' most useless.\"  \"Useful enough for our purpose, however,\" returned Davidson.  \"Send him up to Fort Garry with a message, while you lie down and rest.  If you don't rest, you will yourself be useless in a short time.  La Certe is not such a bad fellow as people think him, specially when his feelings are touched.\"  \"That may be as you say, Tan.  I will try--_whatever_.\"  So saying, the two men parted and hurried on their several ways.    CHAPTER TWO.  A LAZY COUPLE DESCRIBED--AND ROUSED.  Francois La Certe was seated on the floor of his hut smoking a long clay pipe beside an open wood fire when Fergus McKay approached.  His wife "]]]
