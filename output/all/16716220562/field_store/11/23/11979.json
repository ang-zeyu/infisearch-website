I think if you could both make it convenient to come with us about eight o'clock to Caulfield Gardens we might possibly get a little nearer to a solution.\"  One of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his power of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his thoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he could no longer work to advantage.  I remember that during the whole of that memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus.  For my own part I had none of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared to be interminable.  The great national importance of the issue, the suspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we were trying--all combined to work upon my nerve.  It was a relief to me when at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition. Lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of Gloucester Road Station.  The area door of Oberstein's house had been left open the night before, and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes absolutely and indignantly declined to climb the railings, to pass in and open the hall door.  By nine o'clock we were all seated in the study, waiting patiently for our man.  An hour passed and yet another.  When eleven struck, the measured beat of the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes. Lestrade and Mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a minute at their watches.  Holmes sat silent and composed, his eyelids half shut, but every sense on the alert. He raised his head with a sudden jerk.  \"He is coming,\" said he.  There had been a furtive step past the door.  Now it returned. We heard a shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker. Holmes rose, motioning us to remain seated.  The gas in the hall was a mere point of light.  He opened the outer door, and then as a dark figure slipped past him he closed and fastened it.  \"This way!\" we heard him say, and a moment later our man stood before us.  Holmes had followed him closely, and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and alarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room. Before our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and Holmes standing with his back against it.  The man glared round him, staggered, and fell senseless upon the floor.  With the shock, his broad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his lips, and there were the long light beard and the soft, handsome delicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.  Holmes gave a whistle of surprise.  \"You can write me down an ass this time, Watson,\" said he.  \"This was not the bird that I was looking for.\"  \"Who is he?\" asked Mycroft eagerly.  \"The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head of the Submarine Department.  Yes, yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is coming to.  I think that you had best leave his examination to me.\"  We had carried the prostrate body to the sofa.  Now our prisoner sat up, looked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand over his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses.  \"What is this?\" he asked.  \"I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.\"  \"Everything is known, Colonel Walter,\" said Holmes.  \"How an English gentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension. But your whole correspondence and relations with Oberstein are within our knowledge.  So also are the circumstances connected with the death of young Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain at least the small credit for repentance and confession, since there are still some details which we can only learn from your lips.\"  The man groaned and sank his face in his hands.  We waited, but he was silent.  \"I can assure you,\" said Holmes, \"that every essential is already known.  We know that you were pressed for money; that you took an impress of the keys which your brother held; and that you entered into a correspondence with Oberstein, who answered your letters through the advertisement columns of the Daily Telegraph.  We are aware that you went down to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were seen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous reason to suspect you.  He saw your theft, but could not give the alarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your brother in London. Leaving all his private concerns, like the good citizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog and kept at your heels until you reached this very house.  There he intervened, and then it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more terrible crime of murder.\"  \"I did not!  I did not!  Before God I swear that I did not!\" cried our wretched prisoner.  \"Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you laid him upon the roof of a railway carriage.\"  \"I will.  I swear to you that I will.  I did the rest.  I confess it. It was just as you say.  A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid.  I needed the money badly.  Oberstein offered me five thousand.  It was to save myself from ruin.  But as to murder, I am as innocent as you.\"  \"What happened, then?\"  \"He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you describe.  I never knew it until I was at the very door.  It was thick fog, and one could not see three yards.  I had given two taps and Oberstein had come to the door.  The young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were about to do with the papers. Oberstein had a short life-preserver.  He always carried it with him.  As West forced his way after us into the house Oberstein struck him on the head.  The blow was a fatal one.  He was dead within five minutes.  There he lay in the hall, and we were at our wit's end what to do.  Then Oberstein had this idea about the trains which halted under his back window.  But first he examined the papers which I had brought.  He said that three of them were essential, and that he must keep them.  'You cannot keep them,' said I.  'There will be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not returned.'  'I must keep them,' said he, 'for they are so technical that it is impossible in the time to make copies.' 'Then they must all go back together to-night,' said I.  He thought for a little, and then he cried out that he had it. 'Three I will keep,' said he.  'The others we will stuff into the pocket of this young man.  When he is found the whole business will assuredly be put to his account.'  I could see no other way out of it, so we did as he suggested.  We waited half an hour at the window before a train stopped.  It was so thick that nothing could be seen, and we had no difficulty in lowering West's body on to the train.  That was the end of the matter so far as I was concerned.\"  \"And your brother?\"  \"He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys, and I think that he suspected.  I read in his eyes that he suspected. As you know, he never held up his head again.\"  There was silence in the room.  It was broken by Mycroft Holmes.  \"Can you not make reparation?  It would ease your conscience, and possibly your punishment.\"  \"What reparation can I make?\"  \"Where is Oberstein with the papers?\"  \"I do not know.\"  \"Did he give you no address?\"  \"He said that letters to the Hotel du Louvre, Paris, would eventually reach him.\"  \"Then reparation is still within your power,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"I will do anything I can.  I owe this fellow no particular good-will. He has been my ruin and my downfall.\"  \"Here are paper and pen.  Sit at this desk and write to my dictation. Direct the envelope to the address given.  That is right.  Now the letter:  \"Dear Sir:  \"With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have observed by now that one essential detail is missing.  I have a tracing which will make it complete.  This has involved me in extra trouble, however, and I must ask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds.  I will not trust it to the post, nor will I take anything but gold or notes.  I would come to you abroad, but it would excite remark if I left the country at present. Therefore I shall expect to meet you in the smoking-room of the Charing Cross Hotel at noon on Saturday.  Remember that only English notes, or gold, will be taken.  \"That will do very well.  I shall be very much surprised if it does not fetch our man.\"  And it did!  It is a matter of history--that secret history of a nation which is often so much more intimate and interesting than its public chronicles--that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup of his lifetime, came to the lure and was safely engulfed for fifteen years in a British prison.  In his trunk were found the invaluable Bruce-Partington plans, which he had put up for auction in all the naval centres of Europe.  Colonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his sentence.  As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his monograph upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been printed for private circulation, and is said by experts to be the last word upon the subject.  Some weeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my friend spent a day at Windsor, whence he returned with a remarkably fine emerald tie-pin.  When I asked him if he had bought it, he answered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose interests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small commission.  He said no more; but I fancy that I could guess at that lady's august name, and I have little doubt that the emerald pin will forever recall to my friend's memory the adventure of the Bruce-Partington plans."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23462"],["title","More Russian Picture Tales (#0)"],["body","RUSSIAN PICTURE TALES  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     MORE RUSSIAN    PICTURE TALES    BY    VALERY CARRICK    [Illustration]    TRANSLATED   BY   NEVILL FORBES    NEW YORK   FREDERICK A.

A cock was scratching one day in the earth under the wall of a cottage when he found a bean.  [Illustration]  He tried to swallow it, and choked himself. He choked himself and stretched himself out, and there he lay, and couldn't even breathe.  [Illustration]  And his mistress saw him, ran up to him, and asked: \"Mr. Cock, what makes you lie there like that, so that you can't breathe?\"  [Illustration]  \"I've choked myself with a bean,\" he answered. \"Go and ask the cow for some butter.\"  And his mistress came to the cow and said: \"Mrs. Cow, give me some butter! My cock is lying there and can't even breathe, he has choked himself with a bean.\"  [Illustration]  And the cow answered: \"Go and ask the hay-makers for some hay.\"  [Illustration]  And she came to the hay-makers and said: \"Hay-makers, give me some hay! The hay's for the cow who will give me some butter, and the butter's for my cock who is lying there and can't breathe, he's choked himself with a bean.\" And the hay-makers answered: \"Go and ask the oven to give you some loaves.\"  And she came to the oven and said: \"Oven, oven, give me some loaves! The loaves are for the hay-makers, who will give me some hay, the hay's for the cow, who will give me some butter, and the butter's for my cock who is lying there and can't breathe, he's choked himself with a bean.\"  [Illustration]  And the oven answered: \"Go and ask the wood-cutters for some wood.\"  And she came to the wood cutters and said: \"Give me some wood! The wood's for the oven, who will give me some loaves, the loaves are for the hay-cutters, who will give me some hay, the hay's for the cow, who will give me some butter, the butter's for my cock who is lying there and can't breathe, he's choked himself with a bean.\"  [Illustration]  And they answered: \"Go and ask the smith for an axe, we've nothing to cut the wood with.\"  [Illustration]  So she came to the smith and said: \"Smith, smith, give me an axe! The axe is for the wood-cutters, who will give me some wood, the wood's for the oven, who will give me some loaves, the loaves are for the hay-makers, who will give me some hay, the hay's for the cow, who will give me some butter, and the butter's for my cock who is lying there and can't breathe, he's choked himself with a bean.\" And he answered: \"Go into the forest and burn me some charcoal.\"  [Illustration]  So she went into the forest, gathered a bundle of sticks, and burned some charcoal. Then she took the charcoal to the smith, and he gave her an axe. She went with the axe to the wood-cutters, and the wood-cutters gave her some wood. The wood she took to the oven, and the oven gave her some loaves.  [Illustration]  She took the loaves to the hay-makers, and the hay-makers gave her some hay. The hay she took to the cow, who gave her some butter. She brought the butter to the cock, and the cock gulped it down and swallowed the bean.  [Illustration]  Then he jumped up merrily and started singing \"Cock-a-doodle-doo! I was sitting under the wall, plaiting shoes, when I lost my awl, but I found a little coin, and I bought a little scarf, and gave it to a pretty girl.\"  [Illustration]  And that's all about it.     THE GOAT AND THE RAM.   Once upon a time there lived a man and his wife, and they had a goat and a ram.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And one day the man said to his wife: \"Look here, let's get rid of the ram and the goat; why, they only keep eating our corn, and don't help to feed us at all!\"  So he told them: \"Be off, goat and ram, and don't dare to show yourselves at my gate ever again.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  So the goat and the ram made themselves a bag, and went off. And they went on and on, when suddenly they saw a wolf's head lying in the middle of the field.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And they picked up the head, put it in their bag, and went on again. And they went on and on, when suddenly they saw a fire burning, and they said: \"Let's go and spend the night there, lest the wolves should eat us.\" But when they got there, lo and behold! it was the wolves themselves who were cooking their porridge, and so they said: \"Good evening, young fellows, and good appetite to you!\" And the wolves answered: \"Good evening, Mr. Goat and Mr. Ram! We're just boiling our porridge, come and have some, and then we'll eat you both up.\" At this the goat took fright, while as for the ram, his legs had been shaking with fear for some time. Then the goat began to think, and he thought and thought and at last he said: \"Come now, Mr. Ram, let's have a look at that wolf's head you've got in your sack!\" And the ram took out the wolf's head, when the goat said: \"No, not that one. Let's have the other bigger one!\" And again the ram gave him the same head, but he said: \"No, not that one either! let's have the largest of all!\"  And the wolves looked, and thought the ram had a whole sackful of wolves' heads, and each one of them said to himself: \"Well, these are nice guests to have! I'd better hop off!\" And first one said aloud to the others: \"I like your company all right, brothers, but somehow, the porridge doesn't seem to be boiling very well. I'll just run and fetch some sticks to throw on the fire.\" And as he went off, he thought to himself: \"You and your company be bothered!\"--and never came back.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Then the second wolf kept thinking how he could get away, and he said: \"It seems very funny, our brother went to fetch the wood, but he hasn't brought the wood, and hasn't come back himself. I'll just go and help him!\" So off he went too, and never came back. And the third wolf was left sitting there, and at last he said: \"I must really go and hurry them up. What are they dawdling all this time for!\" And as soon as he was gone, he set off running and never so much as looked back.  [Illustration]  And at that the ram and the goat were delighted. They ate up all the porridge and then ran away themselves.  [Illustration]  Meanwhile the wolves had all three met, and they said: \"Look here, why were we three frightened of the goat and the ram? They're no stronger than we, after all! Let's go and do them in!\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  But when they came back to the fire, there was not so much as a trace of them left. Then the wolves set off in pursuit, and at last they saw them, where they had climbed up a tree, the goat on an upper and the ram on a lower branch. So the eldest wolf lay down under the tree, and began to show his teeth, looking up at them, and waiting for them to climb down. And the ram, who was trembling all over from fright, suddenly fell down right on top of the wolf, and at the same minute the goat shouted out from up above: \"There, that's the one! get me the largest of all!\" And the wolf was terrified, because he thought the ram had jumped down after him, and you should just have seen him run! And the other two followed after.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  What a lucky boy is Pat, He's got a dog and a cat!     THE HUNGRY WOLF.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]   There was once a wolf, and he got very hungry, and so he went to have a look to see what he could find for dinner. After a bit he saw a ram feeding in a meadow, so he went up to him and said: \"Mr. Ram, Mr. Ram, I'm going to eat you!\" But the ram answered: \"Who are you, I should like to know, that you mean to eat me?\" \"I'm a wolf, and I'm looking for a good dinner,\" said the wolf. \"What sort of a wolf do you fancy you are?\" answered the ram, \"you're not, you're a dog!\" \"No, I'm not a dog,\" said he, \"I'm a wolf.\" \"Well then,\" answered the ram, \"if you're a wolf, stand at the bottom of the hill and open your jaws wide. Then I'll run down the hill and jump straight into your mouth.\" \"All right,\" said the wolf.  [Illustration]  So he stood at the bottom of the hill and opened his mouth wide, while the ram climbed to the top of the hill. Then he ran down the hill very fast, and hit the wolf with his horns as hard as he could.  [Illustration]  The wolf rolled over, knocked senseless with the blow, while the ram ran off home. And there lay the wolf, till at last he came to himself again, with all his bones aching.  [Illustration]  \"Well, what a fool I must have been!\" thought he. \"Who ever saw a ram jump into one's mouth of his own free will?\"  Then he went on further, just as hungry as ever, and after a bit he saw a horse walking in a meadow nibbling the grass.  [Illustration]  So he went up to him and said: \"Mr. Horse, Mr. Horse, I'm going to eat you!\" But the horse answered: \"Who are you, I should like to know, that you mean to eat me?\" \"I'm a wolf!\" \"You think again,\" answered the horse, \"You're only a dog!\" \"No, I'm not a dog,\" said he, \"I'm a wolf.\" \"Oh, if you are sure you're a"]]]
