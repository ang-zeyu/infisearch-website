The great breakers may thunder on the reef, and even send their spray over, for it is little above the level of the sea, and nowhere much more than a few yards in breadth, but inside all is peaceful and motionless. In this reef there are several openings, by which a ship of the largest size may enter and find a safe, commodious harbour.  It is found that these openings occur usually opposite to any part of the islands where a stream flows into the sea; and the openings have frequently a little herbage, sometimes a few cocoa-nut palms growing on either side, which form a good natural land-mark to the navigator.  Towards one of these openings the long-boat of the _Foam_ was rowed with all speed.  The night was dark, but there was light sufficient to enable them to see their way.  As they drew near they came within the influence of the enormous breakers, which rose like long gigantic snakes and rolled in the form of perpendicular walls to the reef, where they fell with a thunderous roar in a flood of milky foam.  Here it was necessary to exercise the utmost caution in steering, for if the boat had turned broadside on to one of these monstrous waves, it would have been rolled over and over like a cask.  \"Pull gently, lads,\" said the captain, as they began to get within the influence of the breakers.  \"I don't quite see my way yet.  When I give the word, pull with a will till I tell ye to hold on.  Your lives depend on it.\"  This caution was necessary, for when a boat is fairly within the grasp of what we may term a shore-going wave, the only chance of safety lies in going quite as fast as it, if not faster.  Presently the captain gave the word; the men bent to their oars and away they rushed on the crest of a billow, which launched them through the opening in the reef in the midst of a turmoil of seething foam.  Next moment they were rowing quietly over the calm lagoon, and approaching what appeared to be a low-lying island covered with cocoa-nut trees; but the light rendered it difficult to distinguish objects clearly.  A few minutes later the boat's keel grated on the sand, and the whole party leaped on shore.  The first impulse of some of the men was to cheer, but the feelings of others were too deep for expression in this way.  \"Thanks be to God!\" murmured Captain Dall as he landed.  \"Amen!\" said Will Osten earnestly.  Some of the men shook hands, and congratulated each other on their escape from what all had expected would prove to be a terrible death.  As for Larry O'Hale, he fell on his knees, and, with characteristic enthusiasm, kissed the ground.  \"My best blissin's on ye,\" said he with emotion.  \"Och, whither ye be a coral island or a granite wan no matter; good luck to the insict that made ye, is the prayer of Larry O'Hale!\"    CHAPTER SEVEN.  HOPES, FEARS, AND PROSPECTS ON THE CORAL ISLAND.  Few conditions of life are more difficult to bear than that which is described in the proverb, \"Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.\"  Day after day, week after week passed by, and every morning the unfortunate men who had been cast on the coral island rose with revived hope to spend the day in anxiety, and to lie down in disappointment.  The island proved to be a low one, not more than four miles in length by about half a mile in breadth, on which nothing grew except a few cocoa-nut palms.  These afforded the wrecked crew a scanty supply of food, which, with the provisions they had brought, enabled them to live, but the prospect of a residence on such a spot was so hopeless, that they would have left it immediately had not an accident happened which deprived them of their boat.  A few mornings after landing, several of the men rose early, and, without obtaining the captain's permission, went to fish in the lagoon, intending to surprise their comrades by bringing a supply of fresh fish. They were unsuccessful, but, supposing that their chance would be better in the open sea, they rowed through the opening in the reef. They had, however, miscalculated the size and power of the breakers that continually thundered there.  The boat was heavy and unmanageable except by a strong crew.  She turned broadside to the breakers, and, in a few seconds, was hurled upon the reef and dashed to pieces.  The men were saved almost by a miracle.  They succeeded in landing on the reef, and afterwards, with the aid of broken pieces of the wreck, swam across the lagoon to the island.  The loss was irreparable, so that they had now no hope left except in the passing of a ship or a native canoe.  This latter contingency they were led to hope for by the discovery, one very clear morning, of what appeared to be the mountain tops of a cluster of islands, barely visible on the horizon.  But as day after day passed without the appearance of a canoe, they came to the conclusion that these islands were not inhabited.  As weeks passed by and no sail appeared, their hearts began to fail them, for the small stock of provisions was rapidly diminishing.  One morning Captain Dall ascended to the highest point on the island, where he was wont to spend the greater part of each day on the lookout. He found Will Osten there before him.  \"Good-morning doctor,\" said the captain, with a dash of the old hearty spirit in his voice, for he was not easily depressed; \"anything in sight?\"  \"Nothing,\" replied Will, with a degree of energy in his tone that caused the captain to look at him in surprise.  \"Hallo, doctor, have you made a discovery, or have you made up your mind to swim off the island, that you speak and look so resolute this morning?\"  \"Yes, I have made a discovery.  I have discovered that the provisions will not last us another week; that our vigour is not what it used to be; that a sort of apathy is stealing over us all; that the sands of life, in short, are running out while we are sitting idle here making no effort to help ourselves.\"  \"What can we do, lad?\" said the captain sadly, supposing that the youth was merely giving vent to a spirit of desperation.  \"I'll tell you what we can do,\" said Will, rising; \"we can cut down most of the trees and make a huge pile of them, which, with the broken pieces of the long-boat to kindle them, will create a blaze that will attract the attention of the people who live on yonder island--if there be any. I know the character of South Sea islanders, but it is better to live in captivity or die by the hand of savages than to perish of hunger and thirst.  Come, Captain Dall, we _must_ stir the men up to make a last effort.  Rather than die here, I will make a raft and hoist a sail on it, and commit myself to the winds and waves.  What say you?  Shall we try?\"  \"There is something in what you say, doctor,\" replied the captain, pondering the subject; \"at all events, no harm can come of making the attempt.  I'll go speak to the men.\"  In pursuance of this intention he left the place of outlook accompanied by Will, and the result of their consultation with the men was, that in a few minutes Larry O'Hale and Mr Cupples set to work with all the energy in their natures to fell trees with the two axes they possessed. When they were exhausted, Will Osten and Goff relieved them, and then the captain and old Bob took the axes.  Thus the work went on all day, and in the evening a pile of logs was raised almost as large as a medium-sized cottage.  There was something hopeful in the mere act of working with a view to deliverance that raised the spirits of the men, and when the sun began to sink towards the western horizon, they sat down to their slight meal of biscuit and cocoa-nut milk with more appetite and relish than they had experienced for many days.  \"I've bin thinkin',\" said Larry, pausing in the midst of his supper.  \"Well, wot have 'ee bin thinkin', lad?\" said Muggins, wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his coat and wishing for more food--but wishing in vain, for he had finished his allowance--\"you're a good deal given to thinkin', but there's not much ever comes on it, 'xcept wind in the shape o' words.\"  \"And what's words,\" retorted the cook, in supreme contempt, \"but the expression o' sintiment, widout which there wouldn't have bin nuthin' wotsomediver in the univarse?  Sintiment is the mother of all things, as owld Father O'Dowd used to say to my grandmother whin he wanted to come the blarney over her.  It was a philosopher sintimentilisin' over a tay-kittle, I'm towld, as caused the diskivery o' the steam-ingine; it was a sintimintal love o' country as indooced Saint Patrick to banish the varmin from Ireland, an' it was religious sintiment as made Noah for to build the Ark, but for which nother you nor me would have bin born to git cast upon a coral island.  Sintiment is iverything, Muggins, and of that same there isn't more in your whole body than I cud shove into the small end of a baccy-pipe.  But to return to the pint: I've bin thinkin' as to whether it would be best to set a light to this here little pile in the daylight or in the dark, bekase, in the wan case it's the smoke that would call attintion, an' in the other case it's the flame.\"  \"That is true, Larry,\" said the captain; \"I'm inclined to think it would be better seen at night, fire being more powerful than smoke.\"  \"But they're more likely to be asleep at night, and to miss seein' it,\" observed Cupples, in a hollow tone.  It may be remarked in passing, that the mate's voice had become much more sepulchral and his aspect more cadaverous since his arrival on the island.  \"True for ye,\" chimed in Larry; \"an' who knows, if they did see it, but they might take it for the moon in a fog--or for a volkainy?\"  \"Wouldn't the best way to settle the matter be to kindle the fire just now, before it grows dark,\" suggested Will Osten, \"so that they will have a chance of seeing the smoke, and then, when it grows dark, the fire will be getting brighter?\"  \"Right, doctor, you're right.  Come, we'll put the light to it at once,\" cried the captain,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23271"],["title","Sunk at Sea (#7)"],["body","ing.  \"Hand me the match-box, Mr Cupples; it's in the head o' the bread cask.\"  The whole party rose and went to the pile of timber, which was on the highest part of the islet and towered to a height of nearly twelve feet. Captain Dall applied a match to the tarry pieces of the long-boat, which had been placed at the foundation, and the flames at once leaped up and began to lick greedily round the timber, winding through the interstices and withering up the leaves.  Soon a thick smoke began to ascend, for much of the timber in the pile was green, and before the sun had set a dense black cloud was rising straight up like a pillar and spreading out into the sky.  As the fire gathered strength, a great tongue of flame flashed up ever and anon into the midst of the rolling cloud and rent it for a single instant; by degrees those tongues waged fierce war with the smoke.  They shot through it more and more frequently, licked and twined round it--in and out--until they gained the mastery at last, and rose with a magnificent roar into the heavens. Then it was that Larry O'Hale gave vent to his excitement and admiration in an irrepressible shout, and his comrades burst into a mingled cheer and fit of laughter, as they moved actively round the blazing mass and stirred it into fiercer heat with boat-hooks and oars.  When night had closed in, the brilliancy of the bonfire was intense, and the hopes of the party rose with the flames, for they felt certain that any human beings who chanced to be within fifty miles of them could not fail to see the signal of distress.  So the greater part of the night was passed in wild excitement and energetic action.  At last, exhausted yet hopeful, they left the bonfire to burn itself out and sat down to watch.  During the first half-hour they gazed earnestly over the sea, and so powerfully had their hopes been raised, that they expected to see a ship or a boat approaching every minute.  But ere long their hopes sank as quickly as they had been raised.  They ceased to move about and talk of the prospect of speedy deliverance.  The hearts of men who have been long exposed to the depressing influence of \"hope deferred,\" and whose frames are somewhat weakened by suffering and insufficient food, are easily chilled.  One after another they silently crept under the sail, which had been spread out in the form of a tent to shelter them, and with a sigh lay down to rest.  Weariness and exposure soon closed their eyes in \"kind Nature's sweet restorer--balmy sleep,\" and the coral island vanished utterly from their minds as they dreamed of home, and friends, and other days.  So, starving men dream of sumptuous fare, and captives dream of freedom.  Will Osten was last to give way to the feeling of disappointment, and last to lie down under the folds of the rude tent.  He was young, and strong, and sanguine.  It was hard for one in whose veins the hot blood careered so vigorously to believe in the possibility of a few days reducing him to the weakness of infancy--harder still for him to realise the approach of death; yet, when he lay meditating there in the silence of the calm night, a chill crept over his frame, for his judgment told him that if a merciful God did not send deliverance, \"the end\" was assuredly drawing very nigh.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  IN WHICH OUR HERO SUGGESTS A PLAN WHICH GETS THE PARTY OUT OF ONE DIFFICULTY BUT PLUNGES THEM INTO ANOTHER.  How long Wandering Will would have lain in the midst of his slumbering comrades, indulging in gloomy reveries, it is impossible to say, for he was suddenly startled out of them by the appearance of a black object on the sea, at a considerable distance from the shore.  Will's couch was near the open entrance to the tent, and from the spot where his head lay pillowed on his coat, he could see the lagoon, the opening in the reef, and the ocean beyond.  He rose softly, but quickly, and went out to assure himself that his disturbed fancy had not misled him.  No--there could be no doubt about it.  Grey dawn was already breaking, and enabled him to see it distinctly--a dark moving speck on the sea far outside the reef.  It could not be a gull or sea-bird, he felt persuaded; neither was it a ship, for his eye during the voyage had become a practised one in observing distant vessels.  It might be a boat!  Full of this idea, and trembling with hope and anxiety, he returned to the tent, and gently awoke the captain.  \"Sh! don't speak,\" he whispered, laying his hand on the captain's mouth.  \"I'm convinced it is a boat,\" continued Will, as he stood beside the now smouldering fire, while the captain gazed long and earnestly through his telescope at the object on the sea.  \"You're only half-right,\" said the other, with unusual seriousness, as he handed the glass to his companion; \"it's a canoe--a large one, I think, and apparently full of men; but we shan't be left long in doubt as to that; our fire has evidently attracted them, and now we must prepare for their reception.\"  \"Do you then doubt their friendliness?\" asked Will, returning the glass to the captain, who again examined the approaching canoe carefully.  \"Whether they shall turn out to be friends or foes, doctor, depends entirely on whether they are Christians or heathens.  If the missionaries have got a footing amongst 'em, we are saved; if not--I wouldn't give much for our chance of seeing Old England again.\"  The captain's voice dropped as he said this, and his face was overspread with an expression of profound gravity.  \"Do you _really_ believe in all the stories we have heard of the blood-thirstiness of these savages, and their taste for human flesh?\" asked Will, with some anxiety.  \"Believe them!\" exclaimed the captain, with a bitter, almost ferocious laugh; \"of course I do.  I have _seen_ them at their bloody work, lad. It's all very well for shore-goin' folk in the old country to make their jokes about `Cold missionary on the sideboard,' and to sing of the `King of the Cannibal Islands;' but, as sure as there is a sky over your head, and a coral island under your feet, so certainly do the South Sea savages kill, roast, and eat their enemies, and so fond are they of human flesh that, when they can't get hold of enemies, they kill and eat their slaves.  Look, you can make out the canoe well enough now without the glass; she's makin' straight for the opening in the reef.  The sun will be up in half an hour, and they'll arrive about the same time. Come, let us rouse the men.\"  Hastening down to the tent, the captain raised the curtain, and shouted hoarsely--  \"Hallo, lads, turn out there--turn out.  Here's a canoe in sight--look alive!\"  Had a bomb-shell fallen into the midst of the sleepers, it could scarcely have produced more commotion among them.  Every one sprang up violently.  \"Hooroo!\" shouted Larry O'Hale, \"didn't I say so?  Sure it's mysilf was draimin' of ould Ireland, an' the cabin in the bog wi' that purty little crature--\" He stopped abruptly, and added, \"Och! captain dear, what's wrong?\"  \"Hold you tongue, Larry, for a little, and keep your cheerin' till you have done fightin', for it's my opinion we may have something to do in that way ere long.\"  \"Faix, it's mysilf as can enjoy a taste o' that too,\" said Larry, buttoning his jacket and turning up his cuffs.  By this time the canoe was approaching the passage in the reef, and the whole party hastened to the beach, where they held a hasty council of war, for it was now clear that the canoe was one of the largest size-- capable of holding nearly a hundred men--and that it was quite full of naked savages.  In a few words the captain explained to the men the character of the islanders, as ascertained by himself on previous voyages, and showed how hopeless would be their case if they turned out to be heathens.  \"Now,\" said he, \"we are fifteen in number, all told, with two muskets, one pistol, three or four cutlasses, and a small supply of ammunition. If these men prove to be enemies, shall we attack them, and try to take their canoe, or shall we at once lay down our arms and trust to their generosity?  Peace or war, that's the question?\"  Larry at once declared for war, and several of the more fiery spirits joined him, among whom was Will Osten; for the young doctor shrank with horror from the idea of being roasted and eaten!  \"I vote for peace,\" said the mate gloomily.  \"Sure, Mr Cupples,\" exclaimed Larry, \"I wonder at that, for it's little pace ye gave us aboord the _Foam_.\"  \"It's not possible,\" continued the mate--taking no notice of the cook's remark, nor of the short laugh which followed it--\"it's not possible for fifteen men, armed as we are, to beat a hundred savages, well supplied with clubs and spears--as I make no doubt they are--so I think we should trust to their friendliness.\"  \"Bah!\" whispered Larry to the man next him; \"he knows that he's too tough and dry for any savage in his siven sinses to ait _him_, cooked or raw, and so he hopes to escape.\"  \"Mr Cupples is right, lads,\" said the captain; \"we'd have no chance in a fair fight, an' though I make no doubt we should kill double our number in the scrimmage, what good would that do?\"  Some of the men here seconded the captain; the others began to waver, and it was finally decided that they should at least begin with pacific advances.  When the council broke up, the sailors went down to the water's edge and awaited her arrival.  As she came nearer, it became apparent that she was a war-canoe fill with warriors.  Steadily and swiftly she advanced to within a short distance of the shore.  Then the paddlers suddenly ceased, and she was allowed to drift slowly in, while a splendid looking savage stood up in the bow with a shield on his left arm and a javelin in his right hand.  The chief, for such he evidently was, wore no clothing, except a piece of native cloth round his loins; but his whole body was elaborately tatooed with various devices; and this species of decoration, coupled "]]]
