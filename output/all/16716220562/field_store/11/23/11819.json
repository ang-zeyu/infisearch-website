What caused those vibroblades to burn up that way?\"  \"Must have been faulty,\" Mike the Angel said innocently.  \"Both of them?\" Sergeant Cowder asked skeptically. \"At the same time?\"  \"Oh no. Thirty seconds apart, I'd guess.\"  \"Very interesting. Very.\" He started to say something else, but a uniformed officer stuck his head in through the doorway that led to the front of the shop.  \"We combed the whole area, Sergeant. Not a soul around. But from the looks of the alley, there must have been a small truck parked in there not too long ago.\"  Cowder nodded. \"Makes sense. Those JD's wouldn't have tried this unless they intended to take everything they could put their hands on, and they certainly couldn't have put all this in their pockets.\" He rubbed one big finger over the tip of his nose. \"Okay, Barton, that's all. Take those two kids to the hospital and book 'em in the detention ward. I want to talk to them when they wake up.\"  The cop nodded and left.  Sergeant Cowder looked back at Harry. \"Your alarm to the precinct station went off at six thirty-six. I figure that whoever was on the outside, in that truck, knew something had gone wrong as soon as the fight started in here. He--or they--shut off whatever they were using to suppress the alarm system and took off before we got here. They sure must have moved fast.\"  \"Must have,\" agreed Harry. \"Is there anything else, Sergeant?\"  Cowder shook his head. \"Not right now. I'll get in touch with you later, if I need you.\"  Harry and Mike the Angel followed him through the front of the shop to the front door. At the door, Cowder turned.  \"Well, good night. Thanks for your assistance, Mr. Gabriel. I wish some of our cops had had your luck.\"  \"How so?\" asked Mike the Angel.  \"If more vibroblades would blow up at opportune moments, we'd have fewer butchered policemen.\"  Mike the Angel shook his head. \"Not really. If their vibros started burning out every time they came near a cop, the JD's would just start using something else. You can't win in this game.\"  Cowder nodded glumly. \"It's a losing proposition any way you look at it.... Well, good night again.\" He stepped out, and Old Harry closed and locked the door behind him.  Mike the Angel said: \"Come on, Harry; I want to find something.\" He began walking back down the long, narrow shop toward the rear again. Harry followed, looking mystified.  Mike the Angel stopped, sniffing. \"Smell that?\"  Harry sniffed. \"Aye. Burnt insulation. So?\"  \"You know which one of these bins is nearest to your main control cable. Start looking. See if you find anything queer.\"  Old Harry walked over to a nearby bin, pulled it open, and looked inside. He closed it, pulled open another. He found the gadget on the third try. It was a plastic case, six by six by eight, and it still smelled of hot insulation, although the case itself was barely warm.  \"What is it?\" Harry asked in wonder.  \"It's the gizmo that turned your equipment off. When I passed by it, my own gadget must have blown it. I knew the police couldn't have made it here between the time of the fight and the time they showed up. They must have had at least an extra minute. Besides, I didn't think anyone could build an instrument that would blank out everything at long range. It had to be something near your main cable. I think you'll find a metallic oscillator in there. Analyze it. Might be useful.\"  Harry turned the box over in his hands. \"Probably has a timer in it to start it.... Well.... That helps.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"I've got a pretty good idea who put it here. Older kid. Nineteen--maybe twenty. Seemed like a nice lad, too. Didn't take him for a JD. Can't trust anyone these days. Thanks, Mike. If I find anything new in here, I'll let you know.\"  \"Do that,\" said Mike the Angel. \"And, as a personal favor, I'll show you how to build my own super-duper, extra-special, anti-vibroblade defense unit.\"  Old Harry grinned, crinkling up his wizened face in a mass of fine wrinkles. \"You'd better think up a shorter name than that for it, laddie; I could probably build one in less time than it takes you to say it.\"  \"Want to bet?\"  \"I'll bet you twenty I can do it in twenty-four hours.\"  \"Twenty it is, Harry. I'll sell you mine this time tomorrow for twenty bucks.\"  Harry shook his head. \"I'll trade you mine for yours, plus twenty.\" Then his eyes twinkled. \"And speaking of money, didn't you come down here to buy something?\"  Mike the Angel laughed. \"You're not going to like it. I came down to get a dozen plastic-core resistors.\"  \"What size?\"  Mike told him, and Old Harry went over to the proper bin, pulled them out, all properly boxed, and handed them to him.  \"That'll be four dollars,\" he said.  Mike the Angel paid up with a smile. \"You don't happen to have a hundred-thousand-unit microcryotron stack, do you?\"  \"Ain't s'posed to,\" said Harry MacDougal. \"If I did, I wouldn't sell it to you. But, as a matter of cold fact, I do happen to have one. Use it for a paperweight. I'll give it to you for nothing, because it don't work, anyhow.\"  \"Maybe I can fix it,\" said Mike the Angel, \"as long as you're giving it to me. How come it doesn't work?\"  \"Just a second, laddie,\" said Harry. He scuttled to the rear of the shop and came back with a ready-wrapped package measuring five by five by four. He handed it to Mike the Angel and said: \"It's a present. Thanks for helping me out of a tight spot.\"  Mike said something deprecative of his own efforts and took the package. If it were in working order it would have been worth close to three hundred dollars--more than that on the black market. If it was broken, though, it was no good to Mike. A microcryotron unit is almost impossible to fix if it breaks down. But Mike took it because he didn't want to hurt Old Harry's feelings by refusing a present.  \"Thanks, Harry,\" he said. \"Happen to know why it doesn't work?\"  Harry's face crinkled again in his all-over smile. \"Sure, Mike. It ain't plugged in.\"     4   Mike the Angel did not believe in commuting. Being a bachelor, he could afford to indulge in that belief. In his suite of offices on 112th Street, there was one door marked \"M. R. Gabriel.\" Behind that door was his private secretary's office, which acted as an effective barrier between himself and the various employees of the firm. Behind the secretary's office was his own office.  There was still another door in his inner office, a plain, unmarked door that looked as though it might conceal a closet.  It didn't. It was the door to a veddy, veddy expensive apartment with equally expensive appointments. One wall, thirty feet long and ten feet high, was a nearly invisible, dustproof slab of polished, optically flat glass that gave the observer the feeling that there was nothing between him and the city street, five hundred feet below.  The lights of the city, coming through the wall, gave the room plenty of illumination after sunset, but the simple flick of a switch could polarize it black, allowing perfect privacy.  The furniture was massive, heavily braced, and well upholstered. It had to be; Mike the Angel liked to flop into chairs, and his two hundred and sixty pounds gave chairs a lot of punishment.  On one of the opaque walls was Dali's original \"Eucharist,\" with its muffled, robed figures looking oddly luminous in the queer combination of city lights and interior illumination. Farther back, a Valois gleamed metallically above the shadowed bas-reliefs of its depths.  It was the kind of apartment Mike the Angel liked. He could sleep, if necessary, on a park bench or in a trench, but he didn't see any reason for doing so if he could sleep on a five-hundred-dollar floater.  As he had passed through each door, he had checked them carefully. His electrokey had a special circuit that lighted up a tiny glow lamp in the key handle if the lock had been tampered with. None of them had.  He opened the final door, went into his apartment, and locked the door behind him, as he had locked the others. Then he turned on the lights, peeled off his raincoat, and plopped himself into a chair to unwrap the microcryotron stack he had picked up at Harry's.  Theoretically, Harry wasn't supposed to sell the things. They were still difficult to make, and they were supposed to be used only by persons who were authorized to build robot brains, since that's what the stack was--a part of a robot brain. Mike could have put his hands on one legally, provided he'd wanted to wait for six or eight months to clear up the red tape. Actually, the big robotics companies didn't want amateurs fooling around with robots; they'd much rather build the robots themselves and rent them out. They couldn't make do-it-yourself projects impossible, but they could make them difficult.  In a way, there was some good done. So far, the JD's hadn't gone into big-scale robotics. Self-controlled bombs could be rather nasty.  Adult criminals, of course, already had them. But an adult criminal who had the money to invest in robotic components, or went to the trouble to steal them, had something more lucrative in mind than street fights or robbing barrooms. To crack a bank, for instance, took a cleverly constructed, well-designed robot and plenty of ingenuity on the part of the operator.  Mike the Angel didn't want to make bombs or automatic bankrobbers; he just wanted to fiddle with the stack, see what it would do. He turned it over in his hands a couple of times, then shrugged, got up, went over to his closet, and put the thing away. There wasn't anything he could do with it until he'd bought a cryostat--a liquid helium refrigerator. A cryotron functions only at temperatures near absolute zero.  The phone chimed.  Mike went over to it, punched the switch, and said: \"Gabriel speaking.\"  No image formed on the screen. A voice said: \"Sorry, wrong number.\" There was a slight click, and the phone went dead. Mike shrugged and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23335"],["title","Unwise Child (#3)"],["body","the cutoff. Sounded like a woman. He vaguely wished he could have seen her face.  Mike got up and walked back to his easy chair. He had no sooner sat down than the phone chimed again. Damn!  Up again. Back to the phone.  \"Gabriel speaking.\"  Again, no image formed.  \"Look, lady,\" Mike said, \"why don't you look up the number you want instead of bothering me?\"  Suddenly there was an image. It was the face of an elderly man with a mild, reddish face, white hair, and a cold look in his pale blue eyes. It was Basil Wallingford, the Minister for Spatial Affairs.  He said: \"Mike, I wasn't aware that your position was such that you could afford to be rude to a Portfolio of the Earth Government.\" His voice was flat, without either anger or humor.  \"I'm not sure it is, myself,\" admitted Mike the Angel, \"but I do the best I can with the tools I have to work with. I didn't know it was you, Wally. I just had some wrong-number trouble. Sorry.\"  \"Mf.... Well.... I called to tell you that the _Branchell_ is ready for your final inspection. Or will be, that is, in a week.\"  \"My final inspection?\" Mike the Angel arched his heavy golden-blond eyebrows. \"Hell, Wally, Serge Paulvitch is on the job down there, isn't he? You don't need _my_ okay. If Serge says it's ready to go, it's ready to go. Or is there some kind of trouble you haven't mentioned yet?\"  \"No; no trouble,\" said Wallingford. \"But the power plant on that ship was built according to your designs--not Mr. Paulvitch's. The Bureau of Space feels that you should give them the final check.\"  Mike knew when to argue and when not to, and he knew that this was one time when it wouldn't do him the slightest good. \"All right,\" he said resignedly. \"I don't like Antarctica and never will, but I guess I can stand it for a few days.\"  \"Fine. One more thing. Do you have a copy of the thrust specifications for Cargo Hold One? Our copy got garbled in transmission, and there seems to be a discrepancy in the figures.\"  Mike nodded. \"Sure. They're in my office. Want me to get them now?\"  \"Please. I'll hold on.\"  Mike the Angel barely made it in time. He went to the door that led to his office, opened it, stepped through, and closed it behind him just as the blast went off.  The door shuddered behind Mike, but it didn't give. Mike's apartment was reasonably soundproof, but it wasn't built to take the kind of explosion that would shake the door that Mike the Angel had just closed. It was a two-inch-thick slab of armor steel on heavy, precision-bearing hinges. So was every other door in the suite. It wasn't quite a bank-vault door, but it would do. Any explosion that could shake it was a real doozy.  Mike the Angel spun around and looked at the door. It was just a trifle warped, and faint tendrils of vapor were curling around the edge where the seal had been broken. Mike sniffed, then turned and ran. He opened a drawer in his desk and took out a big roll of electrostatic tape. Then he took a deep breath, went back to the door, and slapped on a strip of the one-inch tape, running it all around the edge of the door. Then he went into the outer office while the air conditioners cleaned out his private office.  He went over to one of the phones near the autofile and punched for the operator. \"I had a long-distance call coming in here from the Right Excellent Basil Wallingford, Minister for Spatial Affairs, Capitol City. We were cut off.\"  \"One moment please.\" A slight pause. \"His Excellency is here, Mr. Gabriel.\"  Wallingford's face came back on the screen. It had lost some of its ruddiness. \"What happened?\" he asked.  \"You tell me, Wally,\" Mike snapped. \"Did you see anything at all?\"  \"All I saw was that big pane of glass break. It fell into a thousand pieces, and then something exploded and the phone went dead.\"  \"The glass broke first?\"  \"That's right.\"  Mike sighed. \"Good. I was afraid that maybe someone had planted that bomb, rather than fired it in. I'd hate to think anyone could get into my place without my knowing it.\"  \"Who's gunning for you?\"  \"I wish I knew. Look, Wally, can you wait until tomorrow for those specs? I want to get hold of the police.\"  \"Certainly. Nothing urgent. It can wait. I'll call you again tomorrow evening.\" The screen blanked.  Mike glanced at the wall clock and then punched a number on the phone. A pretty girl in a blue uniform came on the screen.  \"Police Central,\" she said. \"May I help you?\"  \"I'd like to speak to Detective Sergeant William Cowder, please,\" Mike said. \"Just tell him that Mr. Gabriel has more problems.\"  She looked puzzled, but she nodded, and pretty soon her image blanked out. The screen stayed blank, but Sergeant Cowder's voice came over the speaker. \"What is it, Mr. Gabriel?\"  He was evidently speaking from a pocket phone.  \"Attempted murder,\" said Mike the Angel. \"A few minutes ago a bomb was set off in my apartment. I think it was a rocket, and I know it was heavily laced with hydrogen cyanide. That's Suite 5000, Timmins Building, up on 112th Street. I called you because I have a hunch it's connected with the incident at Harry's earlier this evening.\"  \"Timmins Building, eh? I'll be right up.\"  Cowder cut off with a sharp click, and Mike the Angel looked quizzically at the dead screen. Was he imagining things, or was there a peculiar note in Cowder's voice?  Two minutes later he got his answer.     5   Mike the Angel was sitting behind his desk in his private office when the announcer chimed. Mike narrowed his eyes and turned on his door screen, which connected with an eye in the outer door of the suite. Who could it be this time?  It was Sergeant Cowder.  \"You got here fast,\" said Mike, thumbing the unlocker. \"Come on back to my office.\"  The sergeant came through the outer office while Mike watched him on the screen. Not until the officer finally pushed open the door to Mike's own office did Mike the Angel look up from the screen.  \"I repeat,\" said Mike, \"you got here fast.\"  \"I wasn't far away,\" said Cowder. \"Where's the damage?\"  Mike jerked a thumb toward the door to his apartment, still sealed with tape. \"In there.\"  \"Have you been back in there yet?\"  \"Nope,\" said Mike. \"I didn't want to disturb anything. I figured maybe your lab boys could tell where the rocket came from.\"  \"What happened?\" the cop asked.  Mike told him, omitting nothing except the details of his conversation with Wallingford.  \"The way I see it,\" he finished, \"whoever it was phoned me to make sure I was in the room and then went out and fired a rocket at my window.\"  \"What makes you think it was a JD?\" Cowder asked.  \"Well, Sergeant, if I were going to do the job, I'd put my launcher in some place where I could see that my victim was inside, without having to call him. But if I couldn't do that, I'd aim the launcher and set it to fire by remote control. Then I'd go to the phone, call him, and fire the rocket while he was on the phone. I'd be sure of getting him that way. The way it was done smacks of a kid's trick.\"  Cowder looked at the door. \"Think we can go in there now? The HCN ought to have cleared out by now.\"  Mike stood up from behind his desk. \"I imagine it's pretty clear. I checked the air conditioners; they're still working, and the filters are efficient enough to take care of an awful lot of hydrogen cyanide. Besides, the window is open. But--shouldn't we wait for the lab men?\"  Cowder shook his head. \"Not necessary. They'll be up in a few minutes, but they'll probably just confirm what we already know. Peel that tape off, will you?\"  Mike took his ionizer from the top of the desk, walked over to the door, and began running it over the tape. It fell off and slithered to the floor. As he worked, he said:  \"You think you know where the rocket was fired from?\"  \"Almost positive,\" said Cowder. \"We got a call a few minutes back from the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.\"  The last of the tape fell off, and Mike opened the door. It didn't work easily, but it did open. The odor of bitter almonds was so faint that it might actually have been imagination.  Cowder pointed out the shattered window at the gray spire of the cathedral. \"There's your launching site. We don't know how they got up there, but they managed.\"  \"They?\"  \"Two of them. When they tried to leave, a couple of priests and two officers of the Cathedral Police spotted them. The kids dropped their launcher and two unfired rockets, and then tried to run for it. Result: one dead kid, one getaway. One of the cops got a bad gash on his arm from a vibroblade, and one of the priests got it in the abdomen. He'll live, but he's in bad shape.\"  Mike said something under his breath that might have been an oath, except that it avoided all mention of the Deity. Then he added that Name, in a different tone of voice.  \"I agree,\" said Cowder. \"You think you know why they did it?\"  Mike looked around at his apartment. At first glance it appeared to be a total loss, but closer inspection showed that most of the damage had been restricted to glass and ceramics. The furniture had been tumbled around but not badly damaged. The war head of the rocket had evidently been of the concussion-and-gas type, without much fragmentation.  \"I think I know why, yes,\" Mike said, turning back to the sergeant. \"I had a funny feeling all the way home from Harry's. Nothing I could lay my finger on, really. I tried to see if I was being followed, but I didn't spot anyone. There were plenty of kids on the subway.  \"It's my guess that the kids knew who I was. If they cased Harry's as thoroughly as it seems they did, they must have seen me go in and out several times. They knew that it was my fault that two of their members got picked up, so they decided to teach me a lesson. One of them must have come up here, even before I left Harry's. The other followed me, just to make sure I was really coming home. Since he knew where I was going, he didn't have to stick too close, so I didn't spot him in the crowd. He might even have gone"]]]
