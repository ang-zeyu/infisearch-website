They were all brave men; but it requires a very peculiar kind of bravery to enable a man to sit and listen with cool indifference to sounds which he does not understand, issuing from gloomy recesses at his back, where there are acknowledged, though unknown, dangers close at hand.  Bunco, therefore, grinning good-humouredly as usual, rose and selected a gigantic tree as their dormitory.  The trunk of this tree spread out, a few feet above its base, into several branches, any one of which would have been deemed a large tree in England, and these branches were again subdivided into smaller stems with a network of foliage, which rendered it quite possible for a man to move about upon them with facility, and to find a convenient couch. Here,--the fire at the foot of the tree having been replenished,--each man sought and found repose.  It was observed that Larry O'Hale made a large soft couch below the tree on the ground.  \"You're not going to sleep there, Larry?\" said Will Osten, on observing what he was about.  \"Why, the tigers will be picking your bones before morning if you do.\"  \"Och!  I'm not afraid of 'em,\" replied Larry; \"howsever, I _do_ main to slaip up the tree _if I can_.\"  That night, some time after all the party had been buried in profound repose, they were awakened by a crash and a tremendous howl just below them.  Each started up, and, pushing aside the leaves, gazed anxiously down.  A dark object was seen moving below, and Bunco was just going to point his gun at it, when a gruff voice was heard to say--  \"Arrah! didn't I know it?  It's famous I've bin, since I was a mere boy, for rowlin' about in me slaip, an', sure, the branch of a tree is only fit for a bird after all.  But, good luck to yer wisdom an' foresight, Larry O'Hale, for ye've come down soft, anyhow, an' if there's anything'll cure ye o' this bad habit--slaipin' on trees'll do it in the coorse o' time, I make no doubt wotiver!\"    CHAPTER SEVEN.  WHEREIN ARE RECOUNTED DANGERS, DIFFICULTIES, AND PERPLEXITIES FACED AND OVERCOME.  Next morning the travellers rose with the sun, and descended from the tree in which they had spent the night--much refreshed and \"ready for anything.\"  It was well that they were thus prepared for whatever might befall them, for there were several incidents in store for them that day which tried them somewhat, and would have perplexed them sadly had they been without a guide.  Perhaps we are scarcely entitled to bestow that title on Bunco, for he was as thoroughly lost in the forest as were any of his companions, in the sense, at least, of being ignorant as to where he was, or how far from the nearest human habitation: but he was acquainted with forest-life, knew the signs and symptoms of the wilderness, and could track his way through pathless wastes in a manner that was utterly incomprehensible to his companions, and could not be explained by himself.  Moreover, he was a shrewd fellow, as well as bold, and possessed a strong sense of humour, which he did not fail at times to gratify at the expense of his friends.  This tendency was exhibited by him in the first morning's march, during which he proved his superiority in woodcraft, and firmly established himself in the confidence of the party.  The incident occurred thus:--  After a hearty and hasty breakfast--for, being lost, they were all anxious to get found as soon as possible--they set forth in single file; Bunco leading, Old Peter, Muggins, and Larry following, and Will Osten bringing up the rear.  During the first hour they walked easily and pleasantly enough through level and rather open woodland, where they met few obstacles worth mentioning, so that Larry and Muggins, whose minds were filled with the idea of wild beasts, and who were much excited by the romance of their novel position, kept a sharp lookout on the bushes right and left, the one shouldering his gigantic cudgel, the other flourishing his shillelah in a humorous free-and-easy way, and both feeling convinced that with such weapons they were more than a match for any tiger alive!  When several hours had elapsed, however, without producing any sign or sound of game, they began to feel disappointment, and to regard their guide as an exaggerator if not worse; and when, in course of time, the underwood became more dense and their passage through the forest more difficult, they began to make slighting remarks about their dark-skinned friend, and to question his fitness for the duties of guide.  In particular, Muggins--who was becoming fatigued, owing partly to the weight of his club as well as to the weight of his body and the shortness of his legs--at last broke out on him and declared that he would follow no further.  \"Why,\" said he gruffly, \"it's as plain as the nose on yer nutmeg face, that ye're steerin' a wrong coorse.  You'll never make the coast on this tack.\"  \"Oh yis, wees will,\" replied Bunco, with a quiet smile.  \"No, wees won't, ye lump o' mahogany,\" retorted Muggins.  \"Don't the coast run nor' and by west here away?\"  \"Troo,\" assented Bunco with a nod.  \"Well, and ain't we goin' due north just now, so that the coast lies away on our left, an' for the last three hours you've bin bearin' away to the _right_, something like nor' and by east, if it's not nor' _east_ an' by east, the coast being all the while on yer port beam, you grampus--that's so, ain't it?\"  \"Yis, dat's so,\" replied Bunco with a grin.  \"Then, shiver my timbers, why don't ye shove yer helm hard a starboard an' lay yer right coorse?  Come, lads, _I'll_ go to the wheel now for a spell.\"  Will Osten was about to object to this, but Bunco gave him a peculiar glance which induced him to agree to the proposal; so Muggins went ahead and the rest followed.  At the place where this dispute occurred there chanced to be a stretch of comparatively open ground leading away to the left.  Into this glade the hardy seamen turned with an air of triumph.  His triumph, however, was short-lived, for at a turn in the glade he came to a place where the underwood was so dense and so interlaced with vines and creeping plants that further advance was absolutely impossible.  After \"yawing about\" for some minutes \"in search of a channel,\" as Larry expressed it, Muggins suddenly gave in and exclaimed,--\"I'm a Dutchman, boys, if we ha'n't got embayed!\"  \"It's let go the anchor an' take soundin's 'll be the nixt order, I s'pose, Captain Muggins?\" said Larry, touching his cap.  \"Or let the tother pilot take the helm,\" said Old Peter, \"`he's all my fancy painted him,' as Milton says in Paraphrases Lost.\"  \"Right, Peter,\" cried Will Osten, \"we must dethrone Muggins and reinstate Bunco.\"  \"Ha! you's willin' for to do second fiddil _now_?\" said the native, turning with a grin to Muggins, as he was about to resume his place at the head of the party.  \"No, never, ye leather-jawed kangaroo, but I've no objections to _do_ the drum on yer skull, with _this_ for a drumstick!\"  He flourished his club as he spoke, and Bunco, bounding away with a laugh, led the party back on their track for a few paces, then, turning sharp to the right, he conducted them into a narrow opening in the thicket, and proceeded in a zig-zag manner that utterly confused poor Muggins, inducing him from that hour to resign himself with blind faith to the guidance of his conqueror.  Well would it be for humanity in general, and for rulers in particular, if there were more of Muggins's spirit abroad inducing men to give in and resign cheerfully when beaten fairly!  If the sailors were disappointed at not meeting with any wild creatures during the first part of their walk, they were more than compensated by the experiences of the afternoon.  While they were walking quietly along, several snakes--some of considerable length--wriggled out of their path, and Larry trod on one which twirled round his foot, causing him to leap off the ground like a grasshopper and utter a yell, compared to which all his previous shoutings were like soft music.  Bunco calmed his fears, however, and comforted the party by saying that these snakes were harmless.  Nevertheless, they felt a strong sensation of aversion to the reptiles, which it was not easy to overcome, and Muggins began to think seriously that being lost in the forest was, after all, a pleasure mingled considerably with alloy!  Not long after the incident of the snake, strange sounds were heard from time to time in the bushes, and all the party, except Bunco, began to glance uneasily from side to side, and grasped their weapons firmly.  Suddenly a frightful-looking face was observed by Larry peeping through the bushes right over Muggins's unconscious head.  The horrified Irishman, who thought it was no other than a visitant from the world of fiends, was going to utter a shout of warning, when a long hairy arm was stretched out from the bushes and Muggins's hat was snatched from his head.  \"Och! ye spalpeen,\" cried Larry, hurling his cudgel at the ugly creature.  The weapon was truly aimed; it hit the monkey on the back, causing it to drop the hat and vanish from the spot--shrieking.  \"Well done, Larry!\" cried Will Osten; \"why didn't you warn us to expect visits from such brutes, Bunco?\"  \"Why, cause me tink you know all 'bout 'im.  Hab larn 'im from Jo Gruffy.\"  \"From who?\"  \"From Jo Gruffy.  Him as you was say, last night, do tell all 'bout de countries ob de world, and wot sort of treeses an' hanimals in 'im.  Der be plenty ob dem hanimals--(how you call 'im, mongkees?) in Peroo, big an leetil.\"  \"Well!\" exclaimed our hero with a laugh, \"possibly geography may refer to the fact; if so, I had forgotten it, but I'm sorry to hear that they are numerous, for they are much too bold to be pleasant companions.\"  \"Dey do us no harm,\" said Bunco, grinning, \"only chok full ob fun!\"  \"Git along wid ye,\" cried Larry.  \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23274"],["title","Lost in the Forest: Wandering Will's Adventures in South America (#7)"],["body","t's my belaif they're yer own relations, or ye wouldn't stick up for them.\"  Thus admonished, the native resumed the march, and led them through the jungle into deeper and darker shades.  Here the forest was quite free from underwood, and the leafy canopy overhead was so dense that the sky could seldom be seen.  Everything appeared to be steeped in a soft mellow shade of yellowish green, which was delightfully cool and refreshing in a land lying so very near to the equator.  The howling and hoarse barking of wild beasts was now heard to an extent that fully satisfied Larry O'Hale and his friend Muggins.  There were patches of dense jungle here and there, in which it was supposed the animals lay concealed, and each of these were carefully examined by our travellers. That there was need for caution became apparent from the fact that Bunco carried his gun at full cock in the hollow of his left arm, and had a stern, earnest expression of visage which was quite new to his nautical companions, and made a deep impression on them.  Curious and interesting change of sentiment:--the man whom, while at sea, they had treated with good-humoured contempt, was ere long clung to and regarded almost with reverence!  \"Be quiet, boys, here,\" he said, \"an' no make noise.  Keep de eyes open.\"  After this he did not speak, but gave his directions by signs.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  IN WHICH BUNCO DISPLAYS UNCOMMON VALOUR, AND TIGERS COME TO GRIEF.  Advancing cautiously, the travellers arrived at the brink of a dark ravine, in the bottom of which there was a good deal of brushwood, with here and there several pools of water.  They had remained a short time here on the top of the bank, listening to the various barks and cries of the wild animals around them, when their attention was arrested by several loud yelps, which sounded as if some creature were approaching them fast.  Bunco signed to them to stoop and follow him.  They did so, and had not advanced a hundred yards when the loud clatter of hoofs was heard.  Bunco crouched instantly and held his gun in readiness, while his black eyes glittered and his expressive features seemed to blaze with eagerness.  His followers also crouched among the bushes, and each grasped his club with a feeling that it was but a poor weapon of defence after all--though better than nothing!  They had not to wait long, for, in a few minutes, a beautiful black wild horse came racing like the wind along the clear part of the ravine in the direction of the place where they were concealed.  The magnificent creature was going at his utmost speed, being pursued by a large tiger, and the steam burst from his distended nostrils, while his voluminous mane and tail waved wildly in the air.  The tiger gained on him rapidly. Its bounds were tremendous; at each leap it rose several feet from the ground.  The poor horse was all but exhausted, for he slipped and came down on his knees, when abreast of, and not thirty yards distant from, the place where the travellers lay.  The tiger did not miss his opportunity.  He crouched and ran along with the twisting motion of a huge cat; then he sprang a clear distance of twenty feet and alighted on the horse's back, seizing him by the neck with a fearful growl.  Now came Bunco's opportunity.  While the noble horse reared and plunged violently in a vain attempt to get rid of his enemy, the cautious native took a steady aim, and was so long about it that some of the party nearly lost patience with him.  At last he fired, and the tiger fell off the horse, rolling and kicking about in all directions--evidently badly wounded.  The horse meanwhile galloped away and was soon lost to view.  Instead of loading and firing again, Bunco threw down his gun, and, drawing a long knife, rushed in upon his victim.  His comrades, who thought him mad, sprang after him, but he had closed with the tiger and plunged his knife into it before they came up.  The creature uttered a tremendous roar and writhed rapidly about, throwing up clouds of dust from the dry ground, while Bunco made another dash at him and a plunge with his long knife, but he missed the blow and fell.  His comrades closed in and brandished their clubs, but the rapid motions of man and beast rendered it impossible for them to strike an effective blow without running the risk of hitting the man instead of the tiger.  In the midst of a whirlwind of dust and leaves, and a tempest of roars and yells, the bold native managed to drive his knife three times into the animal's side, when it rolled over with a savage growl and expired.  \"Are ye hurt, Bunco?\" inquired Will Osten with much anxiety, when the man rose, covered with dust and blood, and stood before them.  \"No moche hurt, only scrash a bit.\"  \"Scratched a bit!\" exclaimed Larry, \"it's torn to tatters ye ought to be for bein' so venturesome.\"  \"That's so,\" said Muggins; \"ye shouldn't ha' done it, Bunco; what would have comed of us if ye'd bin killed, eh?\"  \"Oh, dat am noting,\" said Bunco, drawing himself up proudly; \"me hab kill lots of dem before; but dis one hims die hard.\"  Will Osten, who was anxious to ascertain whether the man had really escaped serious injury, put a stop to the conversation by hurrying him off to the nearest pool and washing his wounds.  They proved, as he had said, to be trifling--only a slight bite on the shoulder and a few tears, by the animal's claws, on the arms and thighs.  When these were dressed, Bunco went to work actively to skin the tiger,--an operation which he performed with great expedition, and then, having rolled it into a convenient bundle and slung it on his back, he re-loaded his gun and again resumed his duties as guide.  They had not gone far when a fierce growling behind them told that other wild animals, probably tigers, had scented out the carcass of the slain animal, and were already quarrelling over their meal.  Shortly after this they came suddenly and quite unexpectedly on a house or hut, which turned out to be the residence of a man who was half Spaniard half Indian.  The man received them kindly, and, finding that Bunco could speak Spanish, offered them hospitality with great politeness and evident satisfaction.  \"Good luck to 'e, boy,\" said Larry, when their host invited them to partake of a substantial meal, to which he had been about to sit down when they arrived, \"it's myself'll be proud to welcome ye to ould Ireland if iver ye come that way.\"  \"Ask him, Bunco,\" said Will Osten, \"where we are, how far we are from the coast, and what is the name and distance of the nearest town.\"  To these questions the Spaniard replied that they were in the northern part of the Republic of Ecuador, and not, as they had supposed, in Peru, which lay some hundreds of miles to the southward; that a couple of days' walking would bring them to the coast, and that in two days more they could reach the town of Tacames.  This, being one of the few ports on the western coast of South America where vessels touched, was a place from which they might probably be able to make their way to California. He added that there was a rumour of gold having been discovered of late in that region, but, for his part, he didn't believe it, for he had heard the same rumour several times before, and nothing had ever come of it, at least as far as he knew.  \"Ye're wrong there, intirely, mister what's-yer-name,\" said Larry O'Hale, pausing for a moment in the midst of his devotion to the good things spread before him.  \"Sure it's my own brother Ted as wos out there a year gone by, an' he swore he picked up goold like stones an' putt them in his pocket, but the capting o' the ship he sailed in towld him it wos brass, an' his mates laughed at him to that extint that he flung it all overboord in a passion.  Faix, I've made up my mind that there _is_ goold in Callyforny and that wan Larry O'Hale is distined for to make his fortin' there--so I'll throuble ye for another hunk o' that pottimus, or wotiver ye call it.  Prime prog it is, anyhow.\"  An earnest discussion here followed as to the probability of gold having been found in California, and whether it was worth their while to try their fortune in that direction.  During the course of the meal, the Spaniard incidentally mentioned that on the previous night a tiger had broken into his enclosure, and injured a bullock so badly that he had been obliged to kill it, and he had little doubt the same beast would pay him another visit that night.  This was good news to the travellers, all of whom were keen--though not all expert--sportsmen.  As evening had already set in, they begged to be allowed to rest for a little so as to be ready for the tiger when he came.  Their host at once conducted them into a small room, where several hammocks were suspended from the walls.  Into these they quickly jumped, and, in a few minutes, the concert played by their noses told a tale of sweet repose after a day of unusual toil.  For several hours they slept, and then the Spaniard awoke them with the information that the tiger was coming!  Up they sprang, as a matter of course, and with considerable noise too, but Bunco soon impressed them with the necessity of being quiet.  The Spaniard had only two guns, one of which he handed to Will Osten.  The seamen were of necessity left to be spectators.  It is necessary here to describe the Spaniard's hut, which was peculiar as to its architecture.  It was a mere shed made of bamboo canes closely placed together, and roofed with large cocoa and other leaves.  The floor was of rough boards covered with matting.  The whole structure stood on the top of a number of strong posts about twelve or fourteen feet from the ground, and the entrance was gained by a ladder which could be drawn up at night.  The object of this great elevation and the ladder, was protection from the nocturnal visit of wild beasts such as tigers or jaguars, as well as monkeys of a large size.  In the door of this hut there was a hole of about"]]]
