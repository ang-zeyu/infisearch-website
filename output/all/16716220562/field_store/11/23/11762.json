When you've lived in a shack all your life and you suddenly acquire a palace, you cease caring very much what the shack looks like.\"  \"Shack!\" Philip was indignant. \"Why, this house is lovely! Practically every house you've shown me is lovely. Old, yes--but oldness is an essential part of the loveliness of houses. If Pfleugersville is on the order of most housing developments I've seen, you and your neighbors are going to be good and sorry one of these fine days!\"  \"But Pfleugersville isn't on the order of most housing developments you've seen. In fact, it's not a housing development at all. But let's not go into that. Anyway, we're concerned with Valleyview, not Pfleugersville.\"  \"Very well,\" Philip said. \"This afternoon should wind things up so far as the appraising goes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  That evening, after a coffee-less supper--both the gas and the water had been turned off that afternoon--he totaled up his figures. They made quite a respectable sum. He looked across the coffee table, which he had commandeered as a desk, to where Judith, with the dubious help of Zarathustra, was sorting out a pile of manila envelopes which she had placed in the middle of the living-room floor. \"I'll do my best to sell everything,\" he said, \"but it's going to be difficult going till we get a few families living here. People are reluctant about moving into empty neighborhoods, and businessmen aren't keen about opening up business places before the customers are available. But I think it'll work out all right. There's a plaza not far from here that will provide a place to shop until the local markets are functioning, and Valleyview is part of a centralized school district.\" He slipped the paper he had been figuring on into his brief case, closed the case and stood up. \"I'll keep in touch with you.\"  Judith shook her head. \"You'll do nothing of the sort. As soon as you leave, I'm moving to Pfleugersville. My business here is finished.\"  \"I'll keep in touch with you there then. All you have to do is give me your address and phone number.\"  She shook her head again. \"I could give you both, but neither would do you any good. But that's beside the point. Valleyview is your responsibility now--not mine.\"  Philip sat back down again. \"You can start explaining any time,\" he said.  \"It's very simple. The property owners of Valleyview signed all of their houses and places of business over to me. I, in turn, have signed all of them over to you--with the qualification, of course, that after selling them you will be entitled to no more than your usual commission.\" She withdrew a paper from one of the manila envelopes. \"After selling them,\" she went on, \"you are to divide the proceeds equally among the four charities specified in this contract.\" She handed him the paper. \"Do you understand now why I tried so hard to find a trustworthy agent?\"  Philip was staring at the paper, unable, in his astonishment, to read the words it contained. \"Suppose,\" he said presently, \"that circumstances should make it impossible for me to carry out my end of the agreement?\"  \"In case of illness, you will already have taken the necessary steps to transfer the property to another agent who, in your opinion, is as completely honest as you are, and in case of death, you will already have taken the necessary steps to bequeath the property to the same agent; and he, in both cases, will already have agreed to the terms laid down in the contract you're holding in your hands. Why don't you read it?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Now that his astonishment had abated somewhat, Philip found that he could do so. \"But this still doesn't make sense,\" he said a short while later. \"Obviously you and the rest of the owners have purchased new houses. Would it be presumptuous of me to ask how you're going to pay for them when you're virtually giving your old houses away?\"  \"I'm afraid it would be, Mr. Myles.\" She withdrew another paper from the envelope and handed it to him. \"This is the other copy. If you'll kindly affix your signature to both, we can bring our business to a close. As you'll notice, I've already signed.\"  \"But if you're going to be incommunicado,\" Philip pointed out, anger building up in him despite all he could do to stop it, \"what good will your copy do you?\"  Judith's countenance took on a glacial quality. So did her voice. \"My copy will go into the hands of a trusted attorney, sealed in an envelope which I have already instructed him not to open till five years from this date. If, at the time it is opened, you have violated the terms of our agreement, he will institute legal proceedings at once. Fortunately, although the Valleyview post office is closed, a mail truck passes through every weekday evening at eight. It's not that I don't trust you, Mr. Myles--but you are a man, you know.\"  Philip was tempted to tear up the two copies then and there, and toss the pieces into the air. But he didn't, for the very good reason that he couldn't afford to. Instead, he bore down viciously on his pen and brought his name to life twice in large and angry letters. He handed Judith one copy, slipped the other into his breast pocket and got to his feet. \"That,\" he said, \"brings our official business to a close. Now I'd like to add an unofficial word of advice. It seems to me that you're exacting an exorbitant price from the world for your husband's having sold you out for a brunette and a redhead and a pint of Scotch. I've been sold out lots of times for less than that, but I found out long ago that the world doesn't pay its bills even when you ask a fair price for the damages done to you. I suggest that you write the matter off as a bad debt and forget about it; then maybe you'll become a human being again.\"  She had risen to her feet and was standing stiffly before him. She put him in mind of an exquisite and fragile statue, and for a moment he had the feeling that if he were to reach out and touch her, she would shatter into a million pieces. She did not move for some time, nor did he; then she bent down, picked up three of the manila envelopes, straightened, and handed them to him. \"Two of these contain the deeds, maps and other records you will need,\" she said in a dead voice. \"The third contains the keys to the houses and business places. Each key is tagged with the correct address. Good-by, Mr. Myles.\"  \"Good-by,\" Philip said.  He looked around the room intending to say good-by to Zarathustra, but Zarathustra was nowhere to be seen. Finally he went into the hall, opened the front door and stepped out into the night. A full moon was rising in the east. He walked down the moonlit walk, climbed into his car and threw his brief case and the manila envelopes into the back seat. Soon, Valleyview was far behind him.  But not as far as it should have been. He couldn't get the green rose out of his mind. He couldn't get Judith Darrow out of his mind either. Nor could he exorcise the summer breeze that kept wafting through the crevices in his common sense.  A green rose and a grass widow and a breeze with a green breath. A whole town taking off for greener pastures....  He reached into his coat pocket and touched the rose. It was no more than a stem and a handful of petals now, but its reality could not be denied. But roses do not bloom in autumn, and green roses do not bloom at all--  \"Ruf!\"  He had turned into the new highway some time ago, and was driving along it at a brisk sixty-five. Now, disbelievingly, he slowed, and pulled over onto the shoulder. Sure enough, he had a stowaway in the back seat--a tawny-haired stowaway with golden eyes, over-sized ears, and a restless, white-tipped tail. \"Zarathustra!\" he gasped. \"How in the dickens did you get in there?\"  \"Ruf,\" Zarathustra replied.  Philip groaned. Now he would have to go all the way back to Valleyview. Now he would have to see Judith Darrow again. Now he would have to--He paused in midthought, astonished at the abrupt acceleration of his heartbeat. \"Well I'll be damned!\" he said, and without further preamble transferred Zarathustra to the front seat, U-turned, and started back.         *       *       *       *       *  The gasoline lantern had been moved out of the living-room window, but a light still showed beyond the panes. He pulled over to the curb and turned off the ignition. He gave one of Zarathustra's over-sized ears a playful tug, absently noting a series of small nodules along its lower extremity. \"Come on, Zarathustra,\" he said. \"I may as well deliver you personally while I'm at it.\"  After locking the car, he started up the walk, Zarathustra at his heels. He knocked on the front door. Presently he knocked again. The door creaked, swung partially open. He frowned. Had she forgotten to latch it? he wondered. Or had she deliberately left it unlatched so that Zarathustra could get in? Zarathustra himself lent plausibility to the latter conjecture by rising up on his hind legs and pushing the door the rest of the way open with his forepaws, after which he trotted into the hall and disappeared.  Philip pounded on the panels. \"Miss Darrow!\" he called. \"Judith!\"  No answer. He called again. Still no answer.  A summer breeze came traipsing out of the house and engulfed him in the scent of roses. What kind of roses? he wondered. Green ones?  He stepped into the hall and closed the door behind him. He made his way into the living room. The two chairs were gone, and so was the coffee table. He walked through the living room and into the library; through the library and into the dining room. The gasoline lantern burned brightly on the dining-room table, its harsh white light bathing bare floors and naked walls.  The breeze was stronger here, the scent of roses almost cloying. He saw then that the double door that had thwarted him that morning was open, and he moved toward it across the room. As he had suspected, it gave access to the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23232"],["title","The Servant Problem (#3)"],["body","kitchen. Pausing on the threshold, he peered inside. It was an ordinary enough kitchen. Some of the appliances were gone, but the stove and the refrigerator were still there. The back doorway had an odd bluish cast that caused the framework to shimmer. The door itself was open, and he could see starlight lying softly on fields and trees.  Wonderingly he walked across the room and stepped outside. There was a faint sputtering sound, as though live wires had been crossed, and for a fleeting second the scene before him seemed to waver. Then, abruptly, it grew still.  He grew still, too--immobile in the strange, yet peaceful, summer night. He was standing on a grassy plain, and the plain spread out on either hand to promontories of little trees. Before him, the land sloped gently upward, and was covered with multicolored flowers that twinkled like microcosmic stars. In the distance, the lights of a village showed. To his right, a riotous green-rose bush bloomed, and beneath it Zarathustra sat, wagging his tail.  Philip took two steps forward, stopped and looked up at the sky. It was wrong somehow. For one thing, Cassiopeia had changed position, and for another, Orion was awry. For still another, there were no clouds for the moon to hide behind, and yet the moon had disappeared.  Zarathustra trotted over to where he was standing, gazed up at him with golden eyes, then headed in the direction of the lights. Philip took a deep breath, and followed him. He would have visited the village anyway, Zarathustra or no Zarathustra. Was it Pfleugersville? He knew suddenly that it was.         *       *       *       *       *  He had not gone far before he saw a highway. A pair of headlights appeared suddenly in the direction of the village and resolved rapidly into a moving van. To his consternation, the van turned off the thoroughfare and headed in his direction. He ducked into a coppice, Zarathustra at his heels, and watched the heavy vehicle bounce by. There were two men in the cab, and painted on the paneling of the truckbed were the words, PFLEUGERSVILLE MOVERS, INC.  The van continued on in the direction from which he had come, and presently he guessed its destination. Judith, clearly, was in the midst of moving out the furniture she had been too sentimental to sell. The only trouble was, her house had disappeared. So had the village of Valleyview.  He stared at where the houses should have been, saw nothing at first except a continuation of the starlit plain. Then he noticed an upright rectangle of pale light hovering just above the ground, and presently he identified it as Judith's back doorway. He could see through it into the kitchen, and by straining his eyes, he could even see the stove and the refrigerator.  Gradually he made out other upright rectangles hovering just above the ground, some of them on a line with Judith's. All of them, however, while outlined in the same shimmering blue that outlined hers, lacked lighted interiors.  As he stood there staring, the van came to a halt, turned around and backed up to the brightest rectangle, hiding it from view. The two men got out of the cab and walked around to the rear of the truckbed. \"We'll put the stove on first,\" Philip heard one of them say. And then, \"Wonder why she wants to hang onto junk like this?\"  The other man's voice was fainter, but his words were unmistakable enough: \"Grass widows who turn into old maids have funny notions sometimes.\"  Judith Darrow wasn't really moving out of Valleyview after all. She only thought she was.  Philip went on. The breeze was all around him. It blew through his hair, kissed his cheeks and caressed his forehead. The stars shone palely down. Some of the land was under cultivation, and he could see green things growing in the starlight, and the breeze carried their green breath to his nostrils. He reached the highway and began walking along it. He saw no further sign of vehicles till he came opposite a large brick building with bright light spilling through its windows. In front of it were parked a dozen automobiles of a make that he was unfamiliar with.  He heard the whir of machinery and the pounding of hammers, and he went over and peered through one of the windows. The building proved to be a furniture factory. Most of the work was being done by machines, but there were enough tasks left over to keep the owners of the parked cars busily occupied. The main manual task was upholstering. The machines cut and sewed and trimmed and planed and doweled and assembled, but apparently none of them was up to the fine art of spitting tacks.         *       *       *       *       *  Philip returned to the highway and went on. He came to other buildings and peered into each. One was a small automobile-assembly plant, another was a dairy, a third was a long greenhouse. In the first two the preponderance of the work was being performed by machines. In the third, however, machines were conspicuously absent. Clearly it was one thing to build a machine with a superhuman work potential, but quite another to build one with a green thumb.  [Illustration]  He passed a pasture, and saw animals that looked like cows sleeping in the starlight. He passed a field of newly-sprouted corn. He passed a power plant, and heard the whine of a generator. Finally he came to the outskirts of Pfleugersville.  There was a big illuminated sign by the side of the road. It stopped him in his tracks, and he stood there staring at its embossed letters:      PFLEUGERSVILLE, SIRIUS XXI     _Discovered April 1, 1962     Incorporated September 11, 1962_  Philip wiped his forehead.  Zarathustra had trotted on ahead. Now he stopped and looked back. _Come on_, he seemed to say. _Now that you've seen this much, you might as well see the rest._  So Philip entered Pfleugersville ... and fell in love--  Fell in love with the lovely houses, and the darling trees in summer bloom. With the parterres of twinkling star-flowers and the expanses of verdant lawns. With the trellised green roses that tapestried every porch. With the hydrangealike blooms that garnished every corner. With Pfleugersville itself.  Obviously the hour was late, for, other than himself, there was no one on the streets, although lights burned in the windows of some of the houses, and dogs of the same breed and size as Zarathustra occasionally trotted by. And yet according to his watch the time was 10:51. Maybe, though, Pfleugersville was on different time. Maybe, here in Pfleugersville, it was the middle of the night.  The farther he progressed into the village, the more enchanted he became. He simply couldn't get over the houses. The difference between them and the houses he was familiar with was subtle, but it was there. It was the difference that exists between good- and not-quite-good taste. Here were no standardized patios, but little marble aprons that were as much a part of the over-all architecture as a glen is a part of a woods. Here were no stereotyped picture windows, but walls that blended imperceptibly into pleasing patterns of transparency. Here were no four-square back yards, but rambling star-flowered playgrounds with swings and seesaws and shaded swimming holes; with exquisite doghouses good enough for little girls' dolls to live in.  He passed a school that seemed to grow out of the very ground it stood on. He passed a library that had been built around a huge tree, the branches of which had intertwined their foliage into a living roof. He passed a block-long supermarket built of tinted glass. Finally he came to the park.  He gasped then. Gasped at the delicate trees and the little blue-eyed lakes; at the fairy-fountains and the winding, pebbled paths. Star-flowers shed their multicolored radiance everywhere, and starlight poured prodigally down from the sky. He chose a path at random and walked along it in the twofold radiance till he came to the cynosure.  The cynosure was a statue--a statue of a buck-toothed, wall-eyed youth gazing steadfastly up into the heavens. In one hand the youth held a Phillips screw driver, in the other a six-inch crescent wrench. Standing several yards away and staring raptly up into the statue's face was the youth himself, and so immobile was he that if it hadn't been for the pedestal on which the statue rested, Philip would have been unable to distinguish one from the other.  There was an inscription on the pedestal. He walked over and read it in the light cast by a nearby parterre of star-flowers:      FRANCIS FARNSWORTH     PFLEUGER,     DISCOVERER OF     PFLEUGERSVILLE      _Born: May 5. 1941. Died: ----_      _Profession Inventor. On the first day of April of the year of our     Lord, 1962, Francis Farnsworth Pfleuger brought into being a Möbius     coincidence field and established multiple contact with the     twenty-first satellite of the star Sirius, thereby giving the     people of Valleyview access, via their back doorways, to a New     World. Here we have come to live. Here we have come to raise our     children. Here, in this idyllic village, which the noble race that     once inhabited this fair planet left behind them when they migrated     to the Greater Magellanic Cloud, we have settled down to create a     new and better Way of Life. Here, thanks to Francis Farnsworth     Pfleuger, we shall know happiness prosperity and freedom from fear._      FRANCIS FARNSWORTH PFLEUGER, WE, THE NEW INHABITANTS OF SIRIUS XXI,     SALUTE YOU!  Philip wiped his forehead again.  Presently he noticed that the flesh-and-blood Francis Pfleuger was looking in his direction. \"Me,\" the flesh-and-blood Francis Pfleuger said, pointing proudly at the statue. \"Me.\"  \"So I gather,\" Philip said dryly. And then. \"Zarathustra--come back here!\"  The little dog had started down one of the paths that converged on the statue. At Philip's command, he stopped but did not turn; instead he remained where he was, as though waiting for someone to come down the path. After a"]]]
