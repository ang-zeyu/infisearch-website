Mr. Saintsbury is a well-informed writer, who, if the truth must be told, diffuses himself too widely to do his best possible work. He has, however, made French literature a specialty, and he is in general a trustworthy authority on the subject.  Another writer on the subject is Mr. H. Van Laun. Him, although a predecessor of his own in the field, Mr. Saintsbury severely ignores, by claiming that he is himself the first to write in English a history of French literature based on original and independent reading of the authors. We are bound to say that Mr. Van Laun's work is of very poor quality. It offers, indeed, to the reader one advantage not afforded by either of Mr. Saintsbury's works, the advantage, namely, of illustrative extracts from the authors treated,--extracts, however, not unfrequently marred by wretched translation. The cyclopædias are, some of them, both in articles on particular authors and in their sketches of French literary history as a whole, good sources of general information on the subject. Readers who command the means of comparing several different cyclopædias, or several successive editions of some one cyclopædia, as, for example, the \"Encyclopædia Britannica,\" will find enlightening and stimulating the not always harmonious views presented on the same topics. Hallam's \"History of Literature in Europe\" is an additional authority by no means to be overlooked.     II.  FROISSART.  1337-1410.   French literature, for the purposes of the present volume, may be said to commence with Froissart. Froissart is a kind of mediæval Herodotus. His time is, indeed, almost this side the middle ages; but he belongs by character and by sympathy rather to the mediæval than to the modern world. He is delightfully like Herodotus in the style and the spirit of his narrative. Like Herodotus, he became a traveller in order to become an historian. Like Herodotus, he was cosmopolite enough not to be narrowly patriotic. Frenchman though he was, he took as much pleasure in recounting English victories as he did in recounting French. His countrymen have even accused him of unpatriotic partiality for the English. His Chronicles have been, perhaps, more popular in their English form than in their original French. Two prominent English translations have been made, of which the later, that by Thomas Johnes, is now most read. Sir Walter Scott thought the earlier excelled in charm of style.  Jehan or Jean Froissart was a native of Valenciennes. His father meant to make a priest of him, but the boy had other tastes of his own. Before he was well out of his teens, he began writing history. This was under the patronage of a great noble. Froissart was all his life a natural courtier. He throve on the patronage of the great. It was probably not a fawning spirit in him that made him this kind of man; it was rather an innate love of splendor and high exploit. He admired chivalry, then in its last days, and he painted it with the passion of an idealizer. His father had been an heraldic painter, so it was perhaps an hereditary strain in the son that naturally attached him to rank and royalty. The people--that is, the promiscuous mass of mankind--hardly exist to Froissart. His pages, spacious as they are, have scarcely room for more than kings and nobles, and knights and squires. He is a picturesque and romantic historian, in whose chronicles the glories of the world of chivalry--a world, as we have said, already dying, and so soon to disappear--are fixed forever on an ample canvas, in moving form and shifting color, to delight the backward-looking imagination of mankind.  Froissart, besides being chronicler, was something of a poet. It would still be possible to confront one who should call this in question, with thirty thousand surviving verses from the chronicler's pen. Quantity, indeed, rather than quality, is the strong point of Froissart as poet.  He had no sooner finished the first part of his Chronicles, a compilation from the work of an earlier hand, than he posted to England for the purpose of formally presenting his work to the Queen, a princess of Hainault. She rewarded him handsomely. Woman enough, too, she was, woman under the queen, duly to despatch him back again to his native land, where the young fellow's heart, she saw, was lost to a noble lady, whom, from his inferior station, he could woo only as a moth might woo the moon. He subsequently returned to Great Britain, and rode about on horseback gathering materials of history. He visited Italy under excellent auspices, and, together with Chaucer and with Petrarch, witnessed a magnificent marriage ceremonial in Milan. Froissart continued to travel far and wide, always a favorite with princes, but always intent on achieving his projected work. He finally died at Chimay, where he had spent his closing years in rounding out to their completeness his \"Chronicles of England, France, and the Adjoining Countries.\"  Froissart is the most leisurely of historians, or, rather, he is a writer who presupposes the largest allowance of leisure at the command of his readers. He does not seek proportion and perspective. He simply tells us all he had been able to find out respecting each transaction in its turn as it successively comes up in the progress of his narrative. If he goes wrong to-day, he will perhaps correct himself to-morrow, or day after to-morrow,--this not by changing the first record where it stands, to make it right, but by inserting a note of his mistake at the point, whatever it may be, which he shall chance to have reached in the work of composition when the new and better light breaks in on his eyes. The student is thus never quite certain but that what he is at one moment reading in his author, may be an error of which at some subsequent moment he will be faithfully advised. A little discomposing, this, but such is Froissart; and it is the philosophical way to take your author as he is, and make the best of him.  Of such an historian, an historian so diffuse, and so little selective, it would obviously be difficult to give any suitably brief specimen that should seem to present a considerable historic action in full. We go to Froissart's account of the celebrated battle of Poitiers (France). This was fought in 1356, between Edward the Black Prince on the English side, and King John on the side of the French.  King John of the French was, of course, a great prize to be secured by the victorious English. There was eager individual rivalry as to what particular warrior should be adjudged his true captor. Froissart thus describes the strife and the issue:--       There was much pressing at this time, through eagerness to take the      king; and those who were nearest to him, and knew him, cried out,      \"Surrender yourself, surrender yourself, or you are a dead man!\" In      that part of the field was a young knight from St. Omer, who was      engaged by a salary in the service of the King of England; his name      was Denys de Morbeque; who for five years had attached himself to      the English, on account of having been banished in his younger days      from France, for a murder committed in an affray at St. Omer. It      fortunately happened for this knight, that he was at the time near      to the King of France, when he was so much pulled about. He, by      dint of force, for he was very strong and robust, pushed through      the crowd, and said to the king, in good French, \"Sire, sire,      surrender yourself!\" The king, who found himself very disagreeably      situated, turning to him, asked, \"To whom shall I surrender myself?      to whom? Where is my cousin, the Prince of Wales? If I could see      him, I would speak to him.\"--\"Sire,\" replied Sir Denys, \"he is not      here; but surrender yourself to me, and I will lead you to      him.\"--\"Who are you?\" said the king. \"Sire, I am Denys de Morbeque,      a knight from Artois; but I serve the King of England because I      cannot belong to France, having forfeited all I possessed there.\"      The king then gave him his right-hand glove, and said, \"I surrender      myself to you.\" There was much crowding and pushing about; for      every one was eager to cry out, \"I have taken him!\" Neither the      king nor his youngest son Philip were able to get forward, and free      themselves from the throng....       The Prince [of Wales] asked them [his marshals] if they knew any      thing of the King of France: they replied, \"No, sir, not for a      certainty; but we believe he must be either killed or made      prisoner, since he has never quitted his battalion.\" The prince      then, addressing the Earl of Warwick and Lord Cobham, said, \"I beg      of you to mount your horses, and ride over the field, so that on      your return you may bring me some certain intelligence of him.\" The      two barons, immediately mounting their horses, left the prince, and      made for a small hillock, that they might look about them. From      their stand they perceived a crowd of men-at-arms on foot, who were      advancing very slowly. The King of France was in the midst of them,      and in great danger; for the English and Gascons had taken him from      Sir Denys de Morbeque, and were disputing who should have him, the      stoutest bawling out, \"It is I that have got him.\"--\"No, no,\"      replied the others: \"we have him.\" The king, to escape from this      peril, said, \"Gentlemen, gentlemen, I pray you conduct me and my      son in a courteous manner to my cousin the prince; and do not make      such a riot about my capture, for I am so great a lord that I can      make all sufficiently rich.\" These words, and others which fell      from the king, appeased them a little; but the disputes were always      beginning again, and they did not move a step without rioting. When      the two barons"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],["title","Classic French Course in English (#4)"],["body","this troop of people, they descended from the      hillock, and, sticking spurs into their horses, made up to them. On      their arrival, they asked what was the matter. They were answered,      that it was the King of France, who had been made prisoner, and      that upward of ten knights and squires challenged him at the same      time, as belonging to each of them. The two barons then pushed      through the crowd by main force, and ordered all to draw aside.      They commanded, in the name of the prince, and under pain of      instant death, that every one should keep his distance, and not      approach unless ordered or desired so to do. They all retreated      behind the king; and the two barons, dismounting, advanced to the      king with profound reverences, and conducted him in a peaceable      manner to the Prince of Wales.  We continue our citation from Froissart with the brief chapter in which the admiring chronicler tells the gallant story of the Black Prince's behavior as host toward his royal captive, King John of France (it was the evening after the battle):--       When evening was come, the Prince of Wales gave a supper in his      pavilion to the King of France, and to the greater part of the      princes and barons who were prisoners. The prince seated the King      of France, and his son the Lord Philip, at an elevated and      well-covered table: with them were Sir James de Bourbon, the Lord      John d'Artois, the earls of Tancarville, of Estampes, of Dammartin,      of Graville, and the Lord of Partenay. The other knights and      squires were placed at different tables. The prince himself served      the king's table, as well as the others, with every mark of      humility, and would not sit down at it, in spite of all his      entreaties for him so to do, saying that \"he was not worthy of such      an honor, nor did it appertain to him to seat himself at the table      of so great a king, or of so valiant a man as he had shown himself      by his actions that day.\" He added, also, with a noble air, \"Dear      sir, do not make a poor meal, because the Almighty God has not      gratified your wishes in the event of this day; for be assured that      my lord and father will show you every honor and friendship in his      power, and will arrange your ransom so reasonably, that you will      henceforward always remain friends. In my opinion, you have cause      to be glad that the success of this battle did not turn out as you      desired; for you have this day acquired such high renown for      prowess, that you have surpassed all the best knights on your side.      I do not, dear sir, say this to flatter you; for all those of our      side who have seen and observed the actions of each party, have      unanimously allowed this to be your due, and decree you the prize      and garland for it.\" At the end of this speech, there were murmurs      of praise heard from every one; and the French said the prince had      spoken nobly and truly, and that he would be one of the most      gallant princes in Christendom if God should grant him life to      pursue his career of glory.  A splendid and a gracious figure the Black Prince makes in the pages of Froissart. It was great good fortune for the posthumous fame of chivalry, that the institution should have come by an artist so gifted and so loyal as this Frenchman, to deliver its features in portrait to after-times, before the living original vanished forever from the view of history. How much the fiction of Sir Walter Scott owes to Froissart, and to Philip de Comines after Froissart, those only can understand who have read both the old chronicles and the modern romances.  It was one of the congenial labors of Sidney Lanier--pure flame of genius that late burned itself out so swiftly among us!--to edit a reduction or abridgment of Froissart's Chronicles dedicated especially to the use of the young. \"The Boy's Froissart,\" he called it. This book is enriched with a wise and genial appreciation of Froissart's quality by his American editor.  Whoever reads Froissart needs to remember that the old chronicler is too much enamoured of chivalry, and is too easily dazzled by splendor of rank, to be a rigidly just censor of faults committed by knights and nobles and kings. Froissart, in truth, seems to have been nearly destitute of the sentiment of humanity. War to him was chiefly a game and a spectacle.  Our presentation of Froissart must close with a single passage additional, a picturesque one, in which the chronicler describes the style of living witnessed by him at the court--we may not unfitly so apply a royal word--of the Count de Foix. The reader must understand, while he reads what we here show, that Froissart himself, in close connection, relates at full, in the language of an informant of his, how this magnificent Count de Foix had previously killed, with a knife at his throat, his own and his only son. \"I was truly sorry,\" so, at the conclusion of the story, Froissart, with characteristic direction of his sympathy, says, \"for the count his father, whom I found a magnificent, generous, and courteous lord, and also for the country that was discontented for want of an heir.\" Here is the promised passage; it occurs in the ninth chapter of the third volume:--       Count Gaston Phoebus de Foix, of whom I am now speaking, was at      that time fifty-nine years old; and I must say, that although I      have seen very many knights, kings, princes, and others, I have      never seen any so handsome, either in the form of his limbs and      shape, or in countenance, which was fair and ruddy, with gray and      amorous eyes, that gave delight whenever he chose to express      affection. He was so perfectly formed, one could not praise him too      much. He loved earnestly the things he ought to love, and hated      those which it was becoming him so to hate. He was a prudent      knight, full of enterprise and wisdom. He had never any men of      abandoned character with him, reigned prudently, and was constant      in his devotions. There were regular nocturnals from the Psalter,      prayers from the rituals to the Virgin, to the Holy Ghost, and      from the burial service. He had every day distributed as alms, at      his gate, five florins in small coin, to all comers. He was liberal      and courteous in his gifts, and well knew how to take when it was      proper, and to give back where he had confidence. He mightily loved      dogs above all other animals, and during the summer and winter      amused himself much with hunting....       When he quitted his chamber at midnight for supper, twelve servants      bore each a lighted torch before him, which were placed near his      table, and gave a brilliant light to the apartment. The hall was      full of knights and squires, and there were plenty of tables laid      out for any person who chose to sup. No one spoke to him at his      table, unless he first began a conversation. He commonly ate      heartily of poultry, but only the wings and thighs; for in the      daytime, he neither ate nor drank much. He had great pleasure in      hearing minstrels; as he himself was a proficient in the science,      and made his secretaries sing songs, ballads, and roundelays. He      remained at table about two hours, and was pleased when fanciful      dishes were served up to him, which having seen, he immediately      sent them to the tables of his knights and squires.       In short, every thing considered, though I had before been in      several courts of kings, dukes, princes, counts, and noble ladies,      I was never at one that pleased me more, nor was I ever more      delighted with feats of arms, than at this of the Count de Foix.      There were knights and squires to be seen in every chamber, hall,      and court, going backwards and forwards, and conversing on arms and      amours. Every thing honorable was there to be found. All      intelligence from distant countries was there to be learnt, for the      gallantry of the count had brought visitors from all parts of the      world. It was there I was informed of the greater part of those      events which had happened in Spain, Portugal, Arragon, Navarre,      England, Scotland, and on the borders of Languedoc; for I saw,      during my residence, knights and squires arrive from every nation.      I therefore made inquiries from them, or from the count himself,      who cheerfully conversed with me.  The foregoing is one of the most celebrated passages of description in Froissart. At the same time that it discloses the form and spirit of those vanished days, which will never come again to the world, it discloses likewise the character of the man, who must indeed have loved it all well, to have been able so well to describe it.  We take now a somewhat long forward step, in going, as we do, at once from Froissart to Rabelais. Comines, lying between, we must reluctantly pass, with thus barely mentioning his name.     III.  RABELAIS.  1495-1553.   Rabelais is one of the most famous of writers. But he is at the same time incomparably the coarsest.  The real quality of such a writer, it is evidently out of the question to exhibit at all adequately here. But equally out of the question it is to omit Rabelais altogether from an account of French literature.  Of the life of François Rabelais the man, these few facts will be sufficient to know. In early youth he joined the monastic order of the Franciscans. That order hated letters; but Rabelais loved them. He, in fact, conceived a voracious ambition of knowledge. He became immensely learned. This fact, with what it implies of long labor patiently achieved, is enough to show that Rabelais was not without seriousness of character. But he was much more a merry-andrew than a pattern monk. He made interest enough with influential friends to get himself transferred from the Franciscans to the"]]]
