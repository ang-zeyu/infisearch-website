After several gentlemen and one lady had thus been put into the boat, amid a great deal of calling and shouting, and many exclamations of surprise and terror, the officer at the gangway turned to Mr. George, saying,--  \"Come, sir!\"  There was no time to stop to talk; so Mr. George stepped forward, saying to Rollo as he went, \"Come right on directly after me;\" and in a moment more he was seized by the man, and whirled down into the boat, he scarcely knew how. Immediately after he was in, there came some unusually heavy seas, and the steamer and the boat thumped together so violently that all the efforts of the seamen seemed to be required to keep them apart.  \"Push off!\" said the officer.  \"Here, stop! I want to go first,\" exclaimed Rollo.  \"No more in this boat,\" said the officer. \"Push off!\"  \"Never mind,\" said Rollo, calling out to Mr. George, \"I'll come by and by.\"  \"All right,\" said Mr. George.  By this time the boat had got clear of the steamer, and she now began to move slowly onward, rising and falling on the waves, and struggling violently to make her way.  \"I am glad they did not let me go,\" said Rollo. \"I would rather stay and see the rest go first.\"  Another boat was now seen approaching, and Rollo stepped back a little to make way for the people that were to go in it, when he heard Mrs. Parkman's voice, in tones of great anxiety and terror, saying to her husband,--  \"I cannot go ashore in a boat in that way, William. I cannot possibly, and I will not!\"  \"Why, Louise,\" said her husband, \"what else can we do?\"  \"I'll wait till the steamer goes into port, if I have to wait till midnight,\" replied Mrs. Parkman positively. \"It is a shame! Such disgraceful management! Could not they find out how the tide would be here before they left Dover?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Parkman. \"Of course they knew perfectly well how the tide would be.\"  \"Then why did not they leave at such an hour as to make it right for landing here?\"  \"There _are_ boats every day,\" said Mr. Parkman, \"which leave at the right time for that, and most passengers take them. But the mails must come across at regular hours, whether the tide serves or not, and boats must come to bring the mails, and they, of course, allow passengers to come in these boats too, if they choose. We surely cannot complain of that.\"  \"Then they ought to have told us how it was,\" said Mrs. Parkman. \"I think it is a shameful deception, to bring us over in this way, and not let us know any thing about it.\"  \"But they did tell us,\" said Mr. Parkman. \"Do not you recollect that the porter at the station told us that this was a mail boat, and that it would not be pleasant for a lady.\"  \"But I did not know,\" persisted Mrs. Parkman, \"that he meant that we should have to land in this way. He did not tell us any thing about that.\"  \"He told us that it was a mail boat, and he meant by that to tell us that we could not land at the pier. It is true, we did not understand him fully, but that is because we come from a great distance, and do not understand the customs of the country. That is our misfortune. It was not the porter's fault.\"  \"I don't think so at all,\" said Mrs. Parkman. \"And you always take part against me in such things, and I think it is really unkind.\"  All this conversation went on in an under tone; but though there was a great deal of noise and confusion on every side, Rollo could hear it all. While he was listening to it,--or rather while he was _hearing_ it, for he took no pains to listen,--the gentleman who had been talking with Mr. Waldo, and whom the latter had called Mr. Albert, went round to the two ladies who were waiting to be called, and said,--  \"Now, ladies, the boat is ready. Follow me. Say nothing, but do just as you are told, and all will go well.\"  [Illustration: LANDING FROM THE MAIL BOAT.]  So the ladies came one after the other in among the crowd that gathered around the gangway, and there, before they could bring their faculties at all to comprehend any thing distinctly amid the bewildering confusion of the scene, they found their bags and shawls taken away from them, and they themselves turned round and gently forced to back down the steps of the ladder over the boiling surges, when, in a moment more, amid loud shouts of \"LET GO!\" they were seized by the sailors in the boat, and down they went, they knew not how, for a distance of many feet into the stern of the boat, where they suddenly found themselves seated, while the boat itself was rocking violently to and fro, and thumping against the side of the steamer in a frightful manner.  The officer, who had charge of the debarkation on the deck of the steamer above, immediately called to Mrs. Parkman.  \"Come, madam!\" said he.  \"No,\" said she, \"I can't possibly go ashore in that way.\"  \"Then you will have to stay on board all night.\"  \"Well, I'd rather stay on board all night,\" said she.  \"And you will have to go back to Dover, madam,\" continued the officer, speaking in a very stern and hurried manner, \"for the steamer is not going into the pier at all.\"  Then immediately turning to Rollo, he said, \"Come, young man!\"  So Rollo marched up to the gangway, and was in a moment whirled down into the boat, as the others had been. Immediately afterwards the boat pushed off, and the sailors began to row, leaving Mr. and Mrs. Parkman on board the steamer. How they were to get to the shore Rollo did not know.  Rollo began to look about over the water. It had become almost entirely dark, and though the moon, which was full, had, as it happened, broken out through the clouds a short time before, when they were getting into the boats, she had now become obscured again, and every thing seemed enveloped in deep gloom. Still Rollo could see at a short distance before him the other boats slowly making their way over the wild and stormy water. He could also see the ends of the piers dimly defined in the misty air, and the tall lighthouse beyond, with a bright light burning in the lantern at the top of it.  \"We shall only be a few minutes, now,\" said one of the gentlemen. \"It is not far to the piers.\"  The boat went on, pitching and tossing over the waves, with her head towards the piers. The pilot who steered the boat called out continually to the oarsmen, and the oarsmen shouted back to him; but nobody could understand such sailor language as they used. At length, on looking forward again, Rollo saw that the boats before him, instead of going on in a line towards the land, were slowly scattering in all directions, and that their own boat, instead of heading towards the pier as at first, gradually turned round, and seemed to be going along in a direction parallel to the coast, as the steamer had done.  \"What!\" exclaimed Mr. Albert, on observing this, \"we are not going towards the piers. Where can we be going?\"  The other gentleman shook his head, and said he did not know.  The ladies remained quietly in their places. There was evidently nothing for them to do, and so they concluded, very sensibly, to do nothing.  The boat slowly turned her head round, all the time pitching and tossing violently on the billows, until finally she was directed almost towards the steamer again.  \"What can be the matter?\" asked one of the gentlemen, addressing the other. \"We are not heading towards the shore.\" Then turning towards the pilot, he said to him,--  \"What is the matter? Why cannot we go in?\"  The pilot, who spoke English very imperfectly, answered, \"It is a bar. The water is not enough.\"  \"There is a bar,\" said the gentleman, \"outside the entrance to the harbor, and the water is not deep enough even for these boats to go over. We can see it.\"  Rollo and the others looked in the direction where the gentleman pointed, and he could see a long, white line formed by the breakers on the bar, extending each way as far as the eye could reach along the shore. Beyond were to be dimly seen the heads of the piers, and a low line of the coast on either hand, with the lighthouse beyond, towering high into the air, and a bright and steady light beaming from the summit of it.  \"I hope the tide is not going _down_,\" said the gentleman, \"for in that case we may have to wait here half the night.\"  \"Is the tide going down, or coming up?\" he said, turning again to the pilot.  \"It will come up. The tide will come up,\" answered the pilot.  \"What does he say?\" asked one of the ladies in a whisper.  \"He says that the tide will come up,\" replied the gentleman. \"Whether he means it is coming up now, or that it will come up some time or other, I do not know. We have nothing to do but to remain quiet, and await the result.\"  The clouds had been for some time growing darker and darker, and now it began to rain. So the gentlemen took out their umbrellas and spread them, and the party huddled together in the bottom of the boat, and sheltered themselves there as well as they could from the wind and rain. They invited Rollo to come under the umbrellas too, but he said that the rain would not hurt his cap, and he preferred to sit where he could look out and see what they would do.  \"Very well,\" said one of the gentlemen. \"Tell us, from time to time, how we get along.\"  So Rollo watched the manoeuvring of the boat, and reported, from time to time, the progress that she was making. It was not very easy for him to make himself heard, on account of the noise of the winds and waves, and the continual vociferations of the pilot and the seamen.  \"We are headed now,\" said he, \"right away from the shore. We are pointed towards the steamer. I can just see her, working up and down in the offing.  \"Now the men are backing water,\" he continued. \"We are going stern foremost towards the bar. I believe they are going to try to back her over.\"  The boat now rapidly approached the line of breakers, moving stern foremost. The roar of the surf sounded nearer and nearer. At length the ladies and gentlemen under the umbrellas looked out, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22972"],["title","Rollo in Holland (#6)"],["body","saw themselves in the midst of rolling billows of foam, on which the boat rose and fell like a bubble. Presently they could feel her thump upon the bottom. The next wave lifted her up and carried her towards the shore, and then subsiding, brought her down again with another thump upon the sand. The pilot shouted out new orders to the seamen. They immediately began to pull forward with their oars. He had found that the water was yet too shallow on the bar, and that it would be impossible to pass over. So the sailors were pulling the boat out to sea again.  The ladies were, of course, somewhat alarmed while the boat was thumping on the bar, and the boiling surges were roaring so frightfully around them; but they said nothing. They knew that they had nothing to do, and so they remained quiet.  \"We are clear of the bar, now,\" said Rollo, continuing his report. \"I can see the breakers in a long line before us, but we are clear of them. Now the sailors are getting out the anchor. I can see a number of the other boats that are at anchor already.\"  The anchor, or rather the grapnel which served as an anchor, was now thrown overboard, and the boat came to, head to the wind. There she lay, pitching and tossing very uneasily on the sea. The other boats were seen lying in similar situations at different distances. One was very near; so near, that instead of anchoring herself, the seamen threw a rope from her on board the boat where Rollo was, and so held on by her, instead of anchoring herself. In this situation the whole fleet of boats remained for nearly an hour. Rollo kept a good lookout all the time, watching for the first indications of any attempt to move.  At length he heard a fresh command given by the pilot, in language that he could not understand; but the sailors at the bows immediately began to take in the anchor.  \"They are raising the anchor,\" said he. \"Now we are going to try it again. There is one boat gone already. She is just coming to the bar. She is now just in the breakers. I can see the white foam all around her. She is going in. Now she is over. I can see the whole line of foam this side of her. Our boat will be there very soon.\"  In a very few minutes more the boat entered the surf, and soon began to thump as before at every rise and fall of the seas. But as each successive wave came up, she was lifted and carried farther over the bar, and at last came to deep water on the other side.  \"It is all over now,\" said one of the gentlemen, \"and, besides, it has stopped raining.\" So he rose from his place and shut the umbrella. The ladies looked around, and to their great joy saw that they were just entering between the ends of the piers. The passage way was not very wide, and the piers rose like high walls on each side of it; but the water was calm and smooth within, and the boats glided along one after another in a row, in a very calm and peaceful manner. At length they reached the landing stairs, which were built curiously within the pier, among the piles and timbers, and there they all safely disembarked.  On reaching the top of the stairs, Rollo found Mr. George waiting for him.  \"Uncle George,\" said Rollo, \"here I am.\"  \"Have you had a good time?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"excellent.\"  \"And what became of Mr. and Mrs. Parkman?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Rollo; \"I left them on board the steamer. She declared that she would not come in a small boat.\"  \"You and I,\" said Mr. George, \"will go off to-morrow morning by the first train, and go straight to Holland as fast as we can, so as to get out of their way.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo. \"Though I don't care much about it either way.\"  Mr. George, however, carried his plan into effect. The next day they went to Antwerp; and on the day following they crossed the Belgian frontier, and entered Holland.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER IV.  ENTERING HOLLAND.   Rollo and Mr. George went into Holland by the railway. It was a long time before Rollo learned that in travelling from one European country to another, he was not to expect any visible line of demarcation to show the frontier. Boys at school, in studying the shape and conformation of different countries on the map, and seeing them marked by distinct colored boundaries, are very apt to imagine that they will see something, when travelling from one country to another, to show them by visible signs when they pass the frontier.  But there is nothing of the kind. The green fields, the groves, the farmhouse, the succession of villages continues unchanged as you travel, so that, as you whirl along in the railway carriage, there is nothing to warn you of the change, except the custom house stations, where the passports of travellers are called for, and the baggage is examined.  \"Uncle George,\" said Rollo, after looking out of the window at a place where the train stopped, twenty or thirty miles from Antwerp, \"I think we are coming to the frontier.\"  \"Why so?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Because the Belgian custom house is at this station, and the next will be the Dutch custom house.\"  Rollo knew that this was the Belgian custom house by seeing the word DOUANE over one of the doors of the station, and under it the words VISITE DES BAGAGES, which means _examination of baggage_. There were besides a great many soldiers standing about, which was another indication.  \"How do you know that it is the Belgian custom house?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Because all these soldiers are in the Belgian uniform,\" said he. \"I know the Belgian uniform. I don't know the Dutch uniform, but I suppose I shall see it at the next station.\"  Rollo was perfectly right in his calculations. The last station on the line of the railway in Belgium was the frontier station for Belgium, and here travellers, coming from Holland, were called upon to show their passports, and to have their baggage examined. In the same manner the first station beyond, which was the first one in Holland, was the frontier station for that country, and there passengers going from Belgium into Holland were stopped and examined in the same way.  After going on a few miles from the Belgium station, the whistle blew and the train began to stop.  \"Here we are!\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George; \"and now comes the time of trial for the musical box.\"  Rollo had bought a musical box at Antwerp, and he had some fears lest he might be obliged to pay a duty upon it, in going into Holland. Mr. George had told him that he thought there was some danger, but Rollo concluded that he would take the risk.  \"They have no business to make me pay duty upon it,\" said he to Mr. George.  \"Why not?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Because it is not for merchandise,\" said Rollo. \"It is not for sale. I have bought it for my own use alone.\"  \"That has nothing to do with it,\" said Mr. George.  \"Yes it has, a great deal to do with it,\" replied Rollo.  There might have been quite a spirited discussion between Mr. George and Rollo, on this old and knotty question, over which tourists in Europe are continually stumbling, had not the train stopped. The moment that the motion ceased, the doors of all the carriages were opened, and a man passed along the line calling out in French,--  \"Gentlemen and ladies will all descend here, for the examination of passports and baggage.\"  Mr. George and Rollo had no baggage, except a valise which they carried with them in the carriage. Mr. George took this valise up and stepped down upon the platform.  \"Now, Rollo,\" said Mr. George, \"if they find your musical box and charge duty upon it, pay it like a man.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I will.\"  \"And don't get up a quarrel with the custom house officer on the subject,\" continued Mr. George, \"for he has the whole military force of the kingdom of Holland at his command, and what he says is to be done, in this territory, must be done.\"  So saying, Mr. George, valise in hand, followed the crowd of passengers through a door, over which was inscribed the Dutch word for baggage. In the centre of this room there was a sort of low counter, enclosing a sort of oblong square. Within the square were a number of custom house officers, ready to examine the baggage which the porters and the passengers were bringing in, and laying upon the counter, all around the four sides of the square.  Mr. George brought up his valise, and placed it on the counter. A custom house officer, who had just examined and marked some other parcels, turned to Mr. George's just as he had unlocked and opened it.  \"Have you any thing to declare?\" said the officer.  \"Nothing, sir,\" said Mr. George.  The officer immediately shut the valise, and marked it on the back with a piece of chalk, and Mr. George locked it and took it away.  \"Are you through?\" asked Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George.  Mr. George then took the valise and followed a crowd of passengers, who were going through a door at the end of the room opposite to where they came in. There was an officer in uniform on each side of this door. These officers examined every bag, valise, or parcel that the passengers had in their hands, to see if they had been marked by the examiners, and as fast as they found that they were marked, they let them pass.  Following this company, Mr. George and Rollo came soon to another small room, where a man was sitting behind a desk, examining the passports of the passengers and stamping them. Mr. George waited a moment until it came his turn, and then handed his passport too. The officer looked at it, and then stamped an impression from a sort of seal on one corner of it. He also wrote Mr. George's and Rollo's name in a big book, copying them for this purpose from the passport.  He then handed the passport back again, and Mr. George and Rollo went out, passing by a soldier who guarded the door. They found themselves now on the railway platform.  \"Now,\" said Rollo, \"I suppose that we may go and take our seats again.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"We are fairly entered within the dominions of his"]]]
