They were all deep-chested, strong-voiced men in the prime of life; and what a noise they did make, to be sure!  \"You're not too soon, boys,\" said the smith; \"old Moll has been quite anxious about a mysterious _something_ in the big pot there.\"  \"Let me help you to take it off the fire, mother,\" said the gallant tar, stepping forward.  \"Nay, that's my duty,\" cried Harry, leaping to the front, and seizing the pot, which he dragged from the flames with professional ability.  When the _something_ was displayed, it was found to be a gorgeous meat-pudding of the most tempting character--round and heavy like a cannon-ball.  Of course it did not flourish alone.  Old Moll had been mysteriously engaged the greater part of that day over the fire, and the result was a feast worthy, as her husband said, \"of the King of the Cannibal Islands.\"  \"Talking of Cannibal Islands,\" said Dick, the sailor, during a pause in the feast, \"you've no idea what a glorious place that Pacific Ocean is, with its coral islands, palm-groves, and sunshine.  It would be just the place to make you well again, Molly.  You'd grow fat in a month.\"  \"Ha; get fat, would she,\" growled Bob, the soldier, \"so as to be ready for the first nigger-chief that took a fancy to have her cooked for supper--eh?  Never fear, Molly, we won't let you go to the Cannibal Islands.  Give us another cut o' that cannon-ball, mother.  It's better eating than those I've been used to see skipping over the battlefield.\"  \"But they're not _all_ Cannibal Islands, man,\" returned Dick; \"why, wherever the missionaries go, there the niggers get to be as well-behaved as you are.  D'you know, Molly, I've really been thinking of cutting the service, and emigrating somewhere, if you and Fred would go with me.\"  \"It would be charming!\" replied Molly, with a sweet though languid smile.  \"We'd live in a wooden hut, roofed with palm-leaves, and while you and Fred were away hunting for dinner, I would milk the buffaloes, and boil the cocoa-nuts!\"  \"Ah, Molly,\" said Tom, the Coastguardsman, stroking his bushy beard, \"the same idea has been running in my head, as well as in Dick's, ever since we got that letter from Jim, telling us of the beauty of his new home, and urging us all to emigrate.  I've more than half a mind to join him out there, if you and the old folk will consent to go.\"  \"You're not serious, are you, Tom?\" asked Harry, the fireman, laying down his knife and fork.  \"Indeed I am.\"  \"Well, you might do worse.  I would join you myself, if there were only houses enough to insure a fire or two every month.\"  \"Why, man,\" said Fred Harper, \"in these lands the whole forest goes on fire sometimes--surely that would suffice to keep your spirits up and your heart warm.\"  \"Let's have a look at Jim's last epistle, mother,\" said Dick, when the feast was nearly over, and fragrant coffee smoked upon the board, (for you know the Thorogood Family were total abstainers), \"and let Fred read it aloud.  He's by far the best reader amongst us.\"  \"Well, that's not sayin' much for him,\" remarked the fireman, with a sly glance at his sister.  \"Your lamp is not as powerful as it might be, mother,\" said Fred, drawing his chair nearer to that of the fair invalid, as he unfolded the letter.  \"Turn your eyes this way, Molly,--there, keep 'em steady on the page; I can see _now_!\"  \"Eagle's Nest, Rocky Mountain Slopes, 5th October 18---,\" began Fred. \"Darling Mother,--You've no idea what a charming place God has given me here, with plenty of work to do of the most congenial kind.  I have only an opportunity for a short letter this time, because the postboy has arrived unexpectedly, and won't wait.  Postboy!  You would smile at that word if you saw him.  He's a six-foot man in leather, with a big beard, and a rifle and tomahawk.  He was attacked by Indians on the way over the mountains, but escaped, and he attacked a grizzly bear afterwards which didn't escape--but I must not waste time on _him_, Well, I must devote all my letter this post to urging you to come out.  This is a splendid country for big, strong, hearty, willing men like father and my brothers.  Of course it is no better than other countries--rather worse--for weak men, either in mind or body.  Idlers go to the wall here as elsewhere; but for men willing and able to work--ready to turn their hands to anything--it is a splendid opening.  For myself--I feel that my Heavenly Father has sent me here because there is work for me to do, and a climate which will give me health and strength to do it.  My health is better now than it has ever been mince the day of that fall which damaged my constitution so much as to render me one of the confirmed cripples of the earth.  But it was a blessed fall, nevertheless.  I was cast down in order that I might be lifted up.  You would smile, mother,--perhaps you'd laugh--if you saw me at my work.  I'm a Jack-of-all-trades.  Among other things I'm a farmer, a gardener, a carpenter, a schoolmaster, a shoemaker, and a missionary!  The last, you know, I consider my real calling.  The others are but secondary matters, assumed in the spirit of Paul the tent-maker.  You and dear Molly would rejoice with me if you saw my Bible Class on week-days, and my congregation on Sundays.  It is a strange congregation to whom I have been sent to tell the old old story of Jesus and His love.  There are farmers, miners, hunters, even painted savages among them.  My church is usually a barn--sometimes a tent--often the open air.  There are no denominations here, so that I belong to none.  Only two sects exist-- believers and unbelievers.  But the place is growing fast.  Doubtless there will be great changes ere long.  Meanwhile it is my happy duty and privilege to scatter seed in the wilderness.  \"Now, I urge you to come, because there is health for Molly to be found on these sunny slopes of this grand Backbone of America.  That is my strongest point.  If that does not move you, nothing else will!  One glance from the windows of my wooden house--this Eagle's Nest on the Rocky Mountain Slopes--would be sufficient to begin the work of convalescence.  Woods, dells, knolls, hills, plains, prairies, lakes, streams--with the blue mountains in the far, far distance.  Oh! if I were a poet, what a flight I would make into the realms of--of--well, you understand me!  I have no time for more.  The big-bearded postboy is growing impatient.  Only this much will I add,--do, _do_ come, if you love me.  My kindest love to you all.  May God guide you in this matter.--Your affectionate son, JIM.  \"P.S.--One of the members of my congregation is a celebrated hunter named Reuben Dale.  His wife is also one of my flock, and so is his friend Jacob Strang.  The manner in which Reuben got married is so curious that I have amused myself by writing an account of it for mother.  I enclose it.\"  \"Read the story aloud, Fred,\" said Molly.  \"What Jim thought interesting must be well worth reading.\"  Thus urged, Fred took the manuscript and read as follows:--  THE HUNTER'S WEDDING.  A STORY OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.  On the summit of a green knoll, in one of those beautiful valleys which open from the prairies--like inviting portals--into the dark recesses of the Rocky Mountains, there stands, or stood not long ago, a small blockhouse surrounded by a wooden palisade.  Although useless as a protection from artillery, this building was found to be a sufficient defence against the bullets and arrows of the red men of North America, and its owner, Kenneth MacFearsome, a fiery Scotch Highlander, had, up to the date on which our story opens, esteemed it a convenient and safe place for trade with the warlike savages who roamed, fought, and hunted in the regions around it.  Some people, referring to its peaceful purposes, called it MacFearsome's trading post.  Others, having regard to its military aspect, styled it Mac's Fort.  Reuben Dale stood at the front gate of the Fort conversing with a pretty, dark-haired, bright-faced girl of eighteen years or thereabouts: Reuben himself being twenty-eight, and as strapping a hunter of the Rocky Mountains as ever outwitted a redskin or circumvented a grizzly bear.  But Reuben was naturally shy.  He had not the courage of a rabbit when it came to making love.  \"Loo,\" said Reuben, resting his hand on the muzzle of his long rifle and his chin on his hands, as he gazed earnestly down into the quiet, soft little face at his elbow.  \"Well, Reuben,\" said Loo, keeping her eyes prudently fixed on the ground lest they should betray her.  The conversation stopped short at this interesting point, and was not resumed.  Indeed, it was effectually checked by the sudden appearance of The MacFearsome.  \"What, have ye not managed it yet, Reuben?\" said the Highlander, as his daughter tripped quickly away.  \"Not yet,\" said the hunter despondingly.  \"Man, you're not worth a gunflint,\" returned MacFearsome, with a twinkling glance from under his bushy grey eyebrows; \"if ye had not saved Loo's life twice, and mine three times, I'd scorn to let you wed her.  But you'll have to settle it right off, for the parson won't stop another day.

Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________ An exciting story set in the Pacific.  Is Gascoyne a pirate, or isn't he?  Quite a gripping tale, and well worth reading.  ________________________________________________________________________ GASCOYNE, THE SANDAL-WOOD TRADER, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE SCHOONER.  The Great Pacific is the scene of our story.  On a beautiful morning, many years ago, a little schooner might have been seen floating, light and graceful as a sea-mew, on the breast of the slumbering ocean.  She was one of those low black-hulled vessels, with raking, taper masts, trimly cut sails, and elegant form, which we are accustomed to associate with the idea of a yacht or a pirate.  She might have been the former, as far as appearance went, for the sails and decks were white as snow, and every portion of brass and copper above her water-line shone in the hot sun with dazzling brilliancy.  But pleasure-seekers were not wont, in those days, to take such distant flights, or to venture into such dangerous seas--dangerous alike from the savage character of the islanders, and the numerous coral-reefs that lie hidden a few feet below the surface of the waves.  Still less probable did it seem that the vessel in question could belong to the lawless class of craft to which we have referred; for, although she had what may be styled a wicked aspect, and was evidently adapted for swift sailing, neither large guns nor small arms of any kind were visible.  Whatever her nature or her object, she was reduced, at the time we introduce her to the reader, to a state of inaction by the dead calm which prevailed.  The sea resembled a sheet of clear glass.  Not a cloud broke the softness of the sky, in which the sun glowed hotter and hotter as it rose towards the zenith.  The sails of the schooner hung idly from the yards; her reflected image was distorted, but scarcely broken, by the long gentle swell; her crew, with the exception of the watch, were asleep either on deck or down below, and so deep was the universal silence, that, as the vessel rose and fell with a slow, quiet motion, the pattering of the reef points on her sails forcibly attracted the listener's attention, as does the ticking of a clock in the deep silence of night.  A few sea-birds rested on the water, as if in the enjoyment of the profound peace that reigned around; and, far away on the horizon might be seen the tops of the palm-trees that grew on one of those coral islands which lie scattered in thousands, like beautiful gems, on the surface of that bright blue sea.  Among the men who lay sleeping in various easy off-hand attitudes on the schooner's deck was one who merits special attention--not only because of the grotesque appearance of his person, but also because he is one of the principal actors in our tale.  He was a large powerful man, of that rugged build and hairy aspect that might have suggested the idea that he would be difficult to kill.  He was a fair man, with red hair and a deeply sun-burned face, on which jovial good-humour sat almost perpetually enthroned.  At the moment when we introduce him to the reader, however, that expression happened to be modified in consequence of his having laid him down to sleep in a sprawling manner on his back--the place as well as the position being, apparently, one of studied discomfort.  His legs lay over the heel of the bowsprit; his big body reposed on a confused heap of blocks and cordage, and his neck rested on the stock of an anchor, so that his head hung down over it, presenting the face to view, with the large mouth wide open, in an upside down position.  The man was evidently on the verge of choking, but, being a strong man, and a rugged man, and a healthy man, he did not care.  He seemed to prefer choking to the trouble of rousing himself and improving his position.  How long he would have lain in this state of felicity it is impossible to say, for his slumbers were rudely interrupted by a slight lurch of the schooner, which caused the blocks and cordage attached to the sheet of the jib to sweep slowly, but with rasping asperity, across his face. Any ordinary man would have been seriously damaged--at least in appearance--by such an accident; but this particular sea-dog was tough in the skin--he was only awakened by it--nothing more.  He yawned, raised himself lazily, and gazed round with that vacant stare of unreasonable surprise which is common to man on passing from a state of somnolence to that of wakefulness.  Gradually the expression of habitual good-humour settled on his visage, as he looked from one to another of his sleeping comrades, and at last, with a bland smile, he broke forth into the following soliloquy:--  \"Wot a goose, wot a grampus you've bin, John Bumpus: firstly, for goin' to sea; secondly, for remainin' at sea; thirdly, for not forsakin' the sea; fourthly, for bein' worried about it at all, now that you've made up your mind to retire from the sea, and, fifthly--\"  Here John Bumpus paused as if to meditate on the full depth and meaning of these polite remarks, or to invent some new and powerful expression wherewith to deliver his fifth head.  His mental efforts seemed to fail, however, for instead of concluding the sentence, he hummed the following lines, which, we may suppose, were expressive of his feelings as well as his intentions:--    \"So goodbye to the mighty ocean,   And adoo to the rollin' sea,   For it's nobody has no notion   Wot a grief it has bin' to me.\"  \"Ease off the sheets and square the topsail yards,\" was at that moment said, or rather murmured, by a bass voice so deep and rich, that, although scarcely raised above a whisper, it was distinctly heard over the whole deck.  John Bumpus raised his bulky form with a degree of lithe activity that proved him to be not less agile than athletic, and, with several others, sprang to obey the order.  A few seconds later, the sails were swelled out by a light breeze, and the schooner moved through the water at a rate which seemed scarcely possible under the influence of so gentle a puff of air.  Presently the breeze increased, the vessel cut through the blue water like a knife, leaving a long track of foam in her wake as she headed for the coral-island before referred to.  The outer reef, or barrier of coral which guarded the island, was soon reached.  The narrow opening in this natural bulwark was passed.  The schooner stood across the belt of perfectly still water that lay between the reef and the shore, and entered a small bay, where the calm water reflected the strip of white sand, green palms, and tropical plants that skirted its margin, as well as the purple hills of the interior.  Here she swept round in a sudden, but graceful curve, until all her canvas fluttered in the breeze, and then dropt anchor in about six fathoms water.    CHAPTER TWO.  BUMPUS IS FIERY AND PHILOSOPHICAL--MURDEROUS DESIGNS FRUSTRATED.  The captain of the schooner, whose deep voice had so suddenly terminated the meditations of John Bumpus, was one of those men who seem to have been formed for the special purpose of leading and commanding their fellows.  He was not only unusually tall and powerful--physical qualities which, in themselves, are by no means sufficient to command respect--but, as we have said, he possessed a deep full-toned bass voice in which there seemed to lie a species of fascination, for its softest tones riveted attention, and when it thundered forth commands in the fiercest storms it inspired confidence and a feeling of security in all who heard it. The countenance of the captain, however, was that which induced men to accord to him a position of superiority in whatever sphere of action he chanced to move.  It was not so much a handsome as a manly and singularly grave face, in every line of which was written inflexible determination.  His hair was short, black, and curly.  A small moustache darkened his upper lip, but the rest of his face was closely shaven, so that his large chin and iron jaw were fully displayed.  His eyes were of that indescribable blue colour which can exhibit the intensest passion, or the most melting tenderness.  He wore a sombre but somewhat picturesque costume--a dark-coloured flannel shirt and trousers, which latter were gathered in close round his lower limbs by a species of drab gaiter that appeared somewhat incongruous with the profession of the man.  The only bit of bright colour about him was a scarlet belt round his waist, from the side of which depended a long knife in a brown leather sheath.  A pair of light shoes and a small round cap, resembling what is styled in these days a pork-pie, completed his costume.  He was about forty years of age.  Such was the commander, or captain, or skipper, of this suspicious-looking schooner--a man pre-eminently fitted for the accomplishment of much good or the perpetration of great evil.  As soon as the anchor touched the ground, the captain ordered a small boat to be lowered, and, leaping into it with two men, one of whom was our friend John Bumpus, rowed towards the shore.  \"Have you brought your kit with you, John?\" inquired the captain, as the little boat shot over the smooth waters of the bay.  \"Wot's of it, sir,\" replied our rugged seaman, holding up a small bundle tied in a red cotton handkerchief.  \"I s'pose our cruise ashore won't be a long one.\"  \"It will be long for you, my man, at least as far as the schooner is concerned, for I do not mean to take you aboard again.\"  \"Not take me aboard agin!\" exclaimed the sailor, with a look of surprise which quickly degenerated into an angry frown, and thereafter gradually relaxed into a broad grin as he continued--\"why, capting, wot _do_ you mean to do with me then, for I'm a heavy piece of goods, d'ye see, and can't be easily moved about without a small touch o' my own consent, you know.\"  Jo Bumpus,"]]]
