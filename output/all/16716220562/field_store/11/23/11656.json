As soon as I was seated, I took the liberty to say,--though without any protest against this charming assault,--that I fancied there might possibly be some mistake; but I was quickly silenced. My _madrecita_ declared at once, and in the presence of my four shipmates, that, six years before, I left her on my first voyage in a Dutch vessel; that my _querido padre_, had gone to bliss two years after my departure; and, accordingly, that now, I, Antonio Gomez y Carrasco, was the only surviving male of the family, and, of course, would never more quit either her, my darling sisters, or the old _pobrecita_, our grandmother. This florid explanation was immediately closed like the pleasant air of an opera by a new chorus of kisses, nor can there be any doubt that I responded to the embraces of my sweet _hermanas_ with the most gratifying fraternity.  Our charming _quartette_ lasted in all its harmony for half an hour, during which volley after volley of family secrets was discharged into my eager ears. So rapid was the talk, and so quickly was its thread taken up and spun out by each of the three, that I had no opportunity to interpose. At length, however, in a momentary lull and in a jocular manner,--but in rather bad Spanish,--I ventured to ask my loving and talkative mamma, \"what amount of property my worthy father had deemed proper to leave on earth _for his son_ when he took his departure to rest _con Dios_?\" I thought it possible that this agreeable drama was a Spanish joke, got up _al' improvista_, and that I might end it by exploding the dangerous mine of money: besides this, it was growing late, and my return to the galliot was imperative.  But alas! my question brought tears in an instant into my mother's eyes, and I saw that the scene was _not_ a jest. Accordingly, I hastened, in all seriousness, to explain and insist on their error. I protested with all the force of my Franco-Italian nature and Spanish rhetoric, against the assumed relationship. But all was unavailing; they argued and persisted; they brought in the neighbors; lots of old women and old men, with rusty cloaks or shawls, with cigars or _cigarillos_ in mouth, formed a jury of inquest; so that, in the end, there was an unanimous verdict in favor of my Galician nativity!  Finding matters had indeed taken so serious a turn, and knowing the impossibility of eradicating an impression from the female mind when it becomes imbedded with go much apparent conviction, I resolved to yield; and, assuming the manner of a penitent prodigal, I kissed the girls, embraced my mother, passed my head over both shoulders of my grand-dame, and promised my progenitors a visit next day.  As I did not keep my word, and two suns descended without my return, the imaginary \"mother\" applied to the ministers of law to enforce her rights over the truant boy. The _Alcalde_, after hearing my story, dismissed the claim; but my dissatisfied relatives summoned me, on appeal, before the governor of the district, nor was it without infinite difficulty that I at last succeeded in shaking off their annoying consanguinity.  I have always been at a loss to account for this queer mistake. It is true that my father was in Spain with the French army during Napoleon's invasion, but that excellent gentleman was a faithful spouse as well as valiant soldier, and I do not remember that he ever sojourned in the pleasant port of Ferrol!         *       *       *       *       *  At length, we sailed for Havana, and nothing of importance occurred to break the monotony of our hot and sweltering voyage, save a sudden flurry of jealousy on the part of the captain, who imagined I made an attempt to conquer the pious and economical heart of his wife! In truth, nothing was further from my mind or taste than such an enterprise; but as the demon had complete possession of him, and his passion was stimulated by the lies of a cabin-boy, I was forced to undergo an inquisitorial examination, which I resisted manfully but fruitlessly. The Bloomer-dame, who knew her man, assumed such an air of outraged innocence and calumniated virtue, interlarded with sobs, tears, and hysterics, that her perplexed husband was quite at his wit's end, but terminated the scene by abruptly ordering me to my state-room.  This was at nightfall. I left the cabin willingly but with great mortification; yet the surly pair eyed each other with so much anger that I had some fear for the _denouement_. I know not what passed during the silent watches of that night; but doubtless woman's witchcraft had much to do in pouring oil on the seared heart of the skipper. At daylight he emerged from his cabin with orders to have the tell-tale cabin-boy soundly thrashed; and, when Madame mounted the deck, I saw at a glance that her influence was completely restored. Nor was I neglected in this round of reconciliation. In the course of the day, I was requested to resume my duty on board, but I stubbornly refused. Indeed, my denial caused the captain great uneasiness, for he was a miserable navigator, and, now that we approached the Bahamas, my services were chiefly requisite. The jealous scamp was urgent in desiring me to forget the past and resume duty; still I declined, especially as his wife informed me in private that there would perhaps be peril in my compliance.  The day after we passed the \"Hole in the Wall\" and steered for Salt Key, we obtained no meridian observation, and no one on board, except myself, was capable of taking a lunar, which in our position, among unknown keys and currents, was of the greatest value. I knew this troubled the skipper, yet, after his wife's significant warning, I did not think it wise to resume my functions. Nevertheless, I secretly made calculations and watched the vessel's course. Another day went by without a noontide observation; but, at midnight, I furtively obtained a lunar, by the result of which I found we were drifting close to the Cuba reefs, about five miles from the CRUZ DEL PADRE.  As soon as I was sure of my calculation and sensible of imminent danger, I did not hesitate to order the second officer,--whose watch it was,--to call all hands and tack ship. At the same time, I directed the helmsman to luff the galliot close into the wind's eye.  But the new mate, proud of his command, refused to obey until the captain was informed; nor would he call that officer, inasmuch as no danger was visible ahead on the allotted course. But time was precious. Delay would lose us. As I felt confident of my opinion, I turned abruptly from the disobedient mariners, and letting go the main brace, brought the vessel to with the topsail aback. Quickly, then, I ordered the watch as it rushed aft, to clew up the mainsail;--but alas! no one would obey; and, in the fracas, the captain, who rushed on deck ignorant of the facts or danger, ordered me back to my state-room with curses for my interference in his skilful navigation.  With a shrug of my shoulders, I obeyed. Remonstrance was useless. For twenty minutes the galliot cleft the waters on her old course, when the look-out screamed: \"Hard up!--rocks and breakers dead ahead!\"  \"Put down the helm!\" yelled the confused second mate;--but the galliot lost her headway, and, taken aback, shaved the edge of a foam-covered rock, dropping astern on a reef with seven feet water around her.  All was consternation;--sails flapping; breakers roaring; ropes snapping and beating; masts creaking; hull thumping; men shouting! The captain and his wife were on deck in the wink of an eye. Every one issued an order and no one obeyed. At last, _the lady_ shouted--\"let go the anchor!\"--the worst command that could be given,--and down went the best bower and the second anchor, while the vessel swung round, and dashed flat on both of them. No one seemed to think of clewing up the sails, and thereby lessening the impetuous surges of the unfortunate galliot.  Our sad mishap occurred about one o'clock in the morning. Fortunately there was not much wind and the sea was tolerably calm, so that we could recognize, and, in some degree, control our situation;--yet, every thing on board appeared given over to Batavian stupidity and panic.  My own feelings may be understood by those who have calmly passed through danger, while they beheld their companions unmanned by fear or lack of coolness. There was no use of my interference, for no one would heed me. At last the captain's wife, who was probably the most collected individual on board, called my name loudly, and in the presence of officers and crew, who, by this time were generally crowded on the quarter-deck, entreated me to save her ship!  Of course, I sprang to duty. Every sail was clewed up, while the anchors were weighed to prevent our thumping on them. I next ordered the boats to be lowered; and, taking a crew in one, directed the captain to embark in another to seek an escape from our perilous trap. At daylight, we ascertained that we had crossed the edge of the reef at high water, yet it would be useless to attempt to force her back, as she was already half a foot buried in the soft and mushy outcroppings of coral.  Soon after sunrise, we beheld, at no great distance, one of those low sandy keys which are so well-known to West Indian navigators; while, further in the distance, loomed up the blue and beautiful outline of the highlands of Cuba. The sea was not much ruffled by swell or waves; but as we gazed at the key, which we supposed deserted, we saw a boat suddenly shoot from behind one of its points and approach our wreck. The visitors were five in number; their trim, beautiful boat was completely furnished with fishing implements, and four of the hands spoke Spanish only, while the _patron_, or master, addressed us in French. The whole crew were dressed in flannel shirts, the skirts of which were belted by a leather strap over their trowsers, and when the wind"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23036"],["title","Dave Darrin After the Mine Layers; Or, Hitting the Enemy a Hard Naval Blow (#0)"],["body","http://www.eBookForge.net        [Illustration: \"Unbolt the door!\" _Frontispiece_]  Dave Darrin After The Mine Layers  OR  Hitting the Enemy a Hard Naval Blow  By  H.

CHAPTER XVIII--STRIKING A REAL SURPRISE                              183     \"Leave the steamship to me.\" The shot across the bow. A shooting     game for two. \"You're dealing with the United States Navy!\" Darrin     proves himself. Irons for three. The summons that worked. A tough     lot to handle. Juno of the Cabin. A deadly one, too.  CHAPTER XIX--THE GOOD WORK GOES ON                                   192     Dave takes a chance. So does Juno. The all-right cargo. Who can     the woman be?

Old acquaintances. Dave is angry. The German whine. Not     man enough to play the game. \"Why do you hate us Germans so?\" Ever     at Fate's orders.  CHAPTER XXI--ON A MISSION OF GREAT TRUST                             215     The sport of kings. \"Don't shoot!\" begs Danny Grin. The dull wait     and the sharp dash. Out to meet the hospital ship. \"One of the     passengers is Mrs. Darrin.\" \"A special interest.\"  CHAPTER XXII--THE RED CROSS TRAGEDY                                  222     The Navy and family matters. Under treble lookout. Sighted. Big     pay for a periscope. A wail of anguish. The race of rescue. S. O.     S. The sight of Belle. Crowded decks. Two compartments smashed in.     \"No use, sir.\"  CHAPTER XXIII--A NOBLE FIGHT WITHOUT WEAPONS                         230     Marine patchwork. Not enough rescue to go around. \"Those Red Cross     women ought to be saved.\" But they decline. Dave approves. An     answer to S. O. S. The fight to survive. The nurses admit defeat.     The lurking peril.  CHAPTER XXIV--CONCLUSION                                             244   DAVE DARRIN  AFTER THE MINE LAYERS     CHAPTER I  WEIGHING ANCHOR FOR THE GREAT CRUISE   \"IT sounds like the greatest cruise ever!\" declared Danny Grin, enthusiastically, as he rose and began to pace the narrow limits of the chart-room of the destroyer commanded by his chum, Lieutenant-Commander Dave Darrin.  \"It is undoubtedly the most dangerous work we've ever undertaken,\" Darrin observed thoughtfully.  \"All the better!\" answered Dan lightly.  \"In our drive against the submarines off the Irish coast,\" Dave continued, \"we met perils enough to satisfy the average salt water man. But this----\"  \"Is going to prove the very essence and joy of real fighting work at sea!\" Dan interposed.  \"Oh, you old fire-eater!\" laughed Darrin.  \"Not a bit of a fire-eater,\" declared Dalzell with dignity. \"I'm a business man, Davy. Our business, just now, is to win the war by killing Germans, and I've embarked upon that career with all the enthusiasm that goes with it. That's all.\"  \"And quite enough,\" Darrin added, soberly. \"I agree with you that it's our business to kill Germans, yet I could wish that the Germans themselves were in better business, for then we wouldn't have to do any killing.\"  \"You talk almost like a pacifist,\" snorted Dan Dalzell.  \"After this war has been won by our side, but not before, I hope to find it possible to be a pacifist for at least a few years,\" smiled Darrin, rising from his seat at the chart table.  Dan stood looking out through the starboard porthole. His glance roved over other craft of war tugging at their anchors in the goodly harbor of a port on the coast of England. As the destroyer swung lazily at her moorings the little port town came into view. On all sides were signs of war. Forts upreared their grim walls. Earthen redoubts screened guns that alert artillerymen could bring into play at a moment's notice. Overhead, dirigibles floated and airplanes buzzed dinfully to and fro.  Readers of the preceding volume in this series know how Dave Darrin came to be ordered to the command of the brand-new, big and up-to-the-minute destroyer, \"Asa Grigsby,\" while Dan Dalzell, reaching the grade of lieutenant-commander, had been ordered to the command of the twin destroyer, \"Joseph Reed.\"  At the door there sounded a knock so insistent that Darrin knew instantly that it was a summons. Springing from his chair, reaching for his uniform cap and setting it squarely on his head, he drew the curtains aside.  \"Special signal for the 'Grigsby,' sir, from the flagship,\""]]]
