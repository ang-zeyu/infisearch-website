The uniformed squads are rounding up the whole bunch for questioning. They call themselves--you'll get a laugh out of this!--they call themselves the Rocketeers.\"  \"I'm fracturing my funny bone,\" said Mike the Angel. \"The thing that gets me is this revenge business, though. Kids don't usually go that far out for fellow gang members.\"  \"Not usually,\" the sergeant said, \"but this is a little different. The girl you caught and the boy who got killed over at the cathedral are brother and sister.\"  \"That explains it,\" Mike said. \"Rough family, eh?\"  Sergeant Cowder shook his head. \"Not really. The parents are respectable and fairly well off. Larchmont's the name. The kids are Susan and Herbert--Sue and Bert to you. Bert's sixteen, Sue's seventeen. They were pretty thick, I gather: real brother and sister team.\"  \"Good family, bad kids,\" Mike muttered. He had wandered over to the wall to look at his Dali. It had fallen to the floor, but it wasn't hurt. The Valois was bent, but it could be fixed up easily enough.  \"I wonder,\" Mike said, picking up the head of a smashed figurine and looking at it. \"I wonder if the so-called sociologists have any explanation for it?\"  \"Sure,\" Cowder said. \"Same one they've been giving for more decades than I'd care to think of. The mother was married before. Divorced her husband, married Larchmont. But she had a boy by her first husband.\"  \"Broken home and sibling rivalry? _Pfui!_ And if it wasn't that, the sociologists would find another excuse,\" Mike said angrily.  \"Funny thing is that the older half brother was a perfectly respectable kid. Made good grades in school, joined the Space Service, has a perfectly clean record. And yet _he_ was the product of the broken home, not the two younger kids.\"  Mike laughed dryly. \"_That_ ought to be food for high sociological thought.\"  The door announcer chimed again, and Cowder said: \"That's probably the lab boys. I told them to come over here as soon as they could finish up at the cathedral.\"  Mike checked his screen and when Cowder identified the men at the door, Mike let them in.  The short, chubby man in the lead, who was introduced as Perkins, spoke to Sergeant Cowder first. \"We checked one of those rockets. Almost a professional job. TNT war head, surrounded by a jacket filled with liquid HCN and a phosphate inhibitor to prevent polymerization. Nasty things.\" He swung round to Mike. \"You're lucky you weren't in the room, or you'd just be part of the wreckage, Mr. Gabriel.\"  \"I know,\" said Mike the Angel. \"Well, the room's all yours. It probably won't tell you much.\"  \"Probably not,\" said Perkins, \"but we'll see. Come on, boys.\"  Mike the Angel tapped Cowder on the shoulder. \"I'd like to talk to you for a minute.\"  Cowder nodded, and Mike led the way back into his private office. He opened his desk drawer and took out the little pack that housed the workings of the vibroblade shield.  \"That accident you were talking about, Sergeant--the one that made those vibroblades blow, remember? I got to thinking that maybe this could have caused it. I think that with a little more power, it might even vaporize a high-speed bullet. But I'd advise you to wear asbestos clothing.\"  Cowder took the thing and looked at it. \"Thanks, Mr. Gabriel,\" he said honestly. \"Maybe the kids will go on to using something else if vibroblades don't work, but I think I'd prefer a rocket in the head to being carved by a vibro.\"  \"To be honest,\" Mike said, \"I think the vibro is just a fad among the JD's now, anyway. You know--if you're one of the real biggies, you carry a vibro. A year from now, it might be shock guns, but right now you're chicken if you carry anything but a vibroblade.\"  Cowder dropped the shield generator into his coat pocket. \"Thanks again, Mr. Gabriel. We'll do you a favor sometime.\"     6   The firm of M. R. GABRIEL, POWER DESIGN was not a giant corporation, but it did pretty well for a one-man show. The outer office was a gantlet that Mike the Angel had to run when he came in the next morning after having spent the night at a hotel. There was a mixed and ragged chorus of \"Good morning, Mr. Gabriel\" as he passed through. Mike gave the nod to each of them and was stopped four times for small details before he finally made his way to his own office.  His secretary was waiting for him. She was short, bony, and plain of face. She had a figure like an ironing board and the soul of a Ramsden calculator. Mike the Angel liked her that way; it avoided complications.  \"Good morning, Mr. Gabriel,\" she said. \"What the hell happened here?\" She waved at the warped door and the ribbons of electrostatic tape that still lay in curls on the floor.  Mike told her, and she listened to his recitation without any change of expression. \"I'm very glad you weren't hurt,\" she said when he had finished. \"What are you going to do about the apartment?\"  Mike opened the heavy door and looked at the wreckage inside. Through the gaping hole of the shattered window, he could see the towering spires of the two-hundred-year-old Cathedral of St. John the Divine. \"Get Larry Beasley on the phone, Helen. I've forgotten his number, but you'll find him listed under 'Interior Decorators.' He has the original plans and designs on file. Tell him to get them out; I want this place fixed up just like it was.\"  \"But what if someone else....\" She gestured toward the broken window and the cathedral spires beyond.  \"When you're through talking to Beasley,\" Mike went on, \"see if you can get Bishop Brennan on the phone and switch him to my desk.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" she said.  Within two hours workmen were busily cleaning up the wreckage in Mike the Angel's apartment, and the round, plump figure of Larry Beasley was walking around pompously while his artistic but businesslike brain made estimates. Mike had also reached an agreement with the bishop whereby special vaultlike doors would be fitted into the stairwells leading up to the towers at Mike's expense. They were to have facings of bronze so that they could be decorated to blend with the Gothic decor of the church, but the bronze would be backed by heavy steel. Nobody would blow _those_ down in a hurry.  Since the wrecked living room was a flurry of activity and his office had become a thoroughfare, Mike the Angel retired to his bedroom to think. He took with him the microcryotron stack he had picked up at Old Harry's the night before.  \"For something that doesn't look like much,\" he said aloud to the stack, \"you have caused me a hell of a lot of trouble.\"  Old Harry, he knew, wouldn't be caught dead selling the things. In the first place, it was strictly illegal to deal in the components of robotic brains. In the second place, they were so difficult to get, even on the black market, that the few that came into Old Harry's hands went into the defenses of his own shop. Mike the Angel had only wanted to borrow one to take a good look at it. He had read up on all the literature about microcryotrons, but he'd never actually seen one before.  He had reason to be curious about microcryotrons. There was something definitely screwy going on in Antarctica.  Nearly two years before, the UN Government, in the person of Minister Wallingford himself, had asked Mike's firm--which meant Mike the Angel himself--to design the power drive and the thrust converters for a spaceship. On the face of it, there was nothing at all unusual in that. Such jobs were routine for M. R. Gabriel.  But when the specifications arrived, Mike the Angel had begun to wonder what the devil was going on. The spaceship _William Branchell_ was to be built on the surface of Earth--and yet it was to be a much larger ship than any that had ever before been built on the ground. Usually, an interstellar vessel that large was built in orbit around the Earth, where the designers didn't have to worry about gravitational pull. Such a ship never landed, any more than an ocean liner was ever beached--not on purpose, anyway. The passengers and cargo were taken up by smaller vessels and brought down the same way when the liner arrived at her destination.  Aside from the tremendous energy required to lift such a vessel free of a planet's surface, there was also the magnetic field of the planet to consider. The drive tubes tended to wander and become erratic if they were forced to cut through the magnetic field of a planet.  Therefore, Question One: Why wasn't the _Branchell_ being built in space?  Part of the answer, Mike knew, lay in the specifications for the construction of Cargo Hold One. For one thing, it was huge. For another, it was heavily insulated. For a third, it was built like a tank for holding liquids. All very well and good; possibly someone wanted to carry a cargo of cold lemonade or iced tea. That would be pretty stupid, maybe, but it wouldn't be mysterious.  The mystery lay in the fact that Cargo Hold One had _already been built_. The _Branchell_ was to be built _around_ it! And that didn't exactly jibe with Mike the Angel's ideas of the proper way to build a spaceship. It was not quite the same as building a seagoing vessel around an oil tank in the middle of Texas, but it was close enough to bother Mike the Angel.  Therefore, Question Two: Why was the _Branchell_ being built around Cargo Hold One?  Which led to Question Three: What was _in_ Cargo Hold One?  For the answer to that question, he had one very good hint. The density of the contents of Cargo Hold One was listed in the specs as being one-point-seven-two-six grams per cubic centimeter. And that, Mike happened to know, was the density of a cryotronic brain, which is 90 per cent liquid helium and 10 per cent tantalum and niobium, by volume.  He looked at the microcryotron stack in his hand. It was a one-hundred-kilounit stack. The possible connections within it were factorial one hundred thousand. All it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23335"],["title","Unwise Child (#5)"],["body","was to be immersed in its bath of liquid helium to make the metals superconducting, and it would be ready to go to work.  A friend of his who worked for Computer Corporation of Earth had built a robot once, using just such a stack. The robot was designed to play poker. He had fed in all the rules of play and added all the data from Oesterveldt's _On Poker_. It took Mike the Angel exactly one hour to figure out how to beat it.  As long as Mike played rationally, the machine had a slight edge, since it had a perfect memory and could compute faster than Mike could. But it would not, could not learn how to bluff. As soon as Mike started bluffing, the robot went into a tizzy.  It wouldn't have been so bad if the robot had known nothing whatever about bluffing. That would have made it easy for Mike. All he'd have had to do was keep on feeding in chips until the robot folded.  But the robot _did_ know about bluffing. The trouble is that bluffing is essentially illogical, and the robot had no rules whatsoever to go by to judge whether Mike was bluffing or not. It finally decided to make its decisions by chance, judging by Mike's past performance at bluffing. When it did, Mike quit bluffing and cleaned it out fast.  That caused such utter confusion in the random circuits that Mike's friend had had to spend a week cleaning up the robot's little mind.  But what would be the purpose of building a brain as gigantic as the one in Cargo Hold One? And why build a spaceship around it?  Like a pig roasting on an automatic spit, the problem kept turning over and over in Mike's mind. And, like the roasting pig, the time eventually came when it was done.  Once it is set in operation, a properly operating robot brain can neither be shut off nor dismantled. Not, that is, unless you want to lose all of the data and processes you've fed into it.  Now, suppose the Computer Corporation of Earth had built a giant-sized brain. (Never mind _why_--just suppose.) And suppose they wanted to take it off Earth, but didn't want to lose all the data that had been pumped into it. (Again, never mind _why_--just suppose.)  Very well, then. _If_ such a brain had been built, and _if_ it was necessary to take it off Earth, and _if_ the data in it was so precious that the brain could not be shut off or dismantled, _then_ the thing to do would be to build a ship around it.  Oh _yeah_?  Mike the Angel stared at the microcryotron stack and asked:  \"Now, tell me, pal, just why would anyone want a brain that big? And what is so blasted important about it?\"  The stack said not a word.  The phone chimed. Mike the Angel thumbed the switch, and his secretary's face appeared on the screen. \"Minister Wallingford is on the line, Mr. Gabriel.\"  \"Put him on,\" said Mike the Angel.  Basil Wallingford's ruddy face came on. \"I see you're still alive,\" he said. \"What in the bloody blazes happened last night?\"  Mike sighed and told him. \"In other words,\" he ended up, \"just the usual sort of JD stuff we have to put up with these days. Nothing new, and nothing to worry about.\"  \"You almost got killed,\" Wallingford pointed out.  \"A miss is as good as a mile,\" Mike said with cheerful inanity. \"Thanks to your phone call, I was as safe as if I'd been in my own home,\" he added with utter illogic.  \"You can afford to laugh,\" Wallingford said grimly. \"I can't. I've already lost one man.\"  Mike's grin vanished. \"What do you mean? Who?\"  \"Oh, nobody's killed,\" Wallingford said quickly. \"I didn't mean that. But Jack Wong turned his car over yesterday at a hundred and seventy miles an hour, and he's laid up with a fractured leg and a badly dislocated arm.\"  \"Too bad,\" said Mike. \"One of these days that fool will kill himself racing.\" He knew Wong and liked him. They had served together in the Space Service when Mike was on active duty.  \"I hope not,\" Wallingford said. \"Anyway--the matter I called you on last night. Can you get those specs for me?\"  \"Sure, Wally. Hold on.\" He punched the hold button and rang for his secretary as Wallingford's face vanished. When the girl's face came on, he said: \"Helen, get me the cargo specs on the _William Branchell_--Section Twelve, pages 66 to 74.\"  The discussion, after Helen had brought the papers, lasted less than five minutes. It was merely a matter of straightening out some cost estimates--but since it had to do with the _Branchell_, and specifically with Hold Number One, Mike decided he'd ask a question.  \"Wally, tell me--what in the hell is going on down there at Chilblains Base?\"  \"They're building a spaceship,\" said Wallingford in a flat voice.  It was Wallingford's way of saying he wasn't going to answer any questions, but Mike the Angel ignored the hint. \"I'd sort of gathered that,\" he said dryly. \"But what I want to know is: Why is it being built around a cryotronic brain, the like of which I have never heard before?\"  Basil Wallingford's eyes widened, and he just stared for a full two seconds. \"And just how did you come across that information, Golden Wings?\" he finally asked.  \"It's right here in the specs,\" said Mike the Angel, tapping the sheaf of papers.  \"Ridiculous.\" Wallingford's voice seemed toneless.  Mike decided he was in too deep now to back out. \"It certainly is, Wally. It couldn't be hidden. To compute the thrust stresses, I had to know the density of the contents of Cargo Hold One. And here it is: 1.726 gm/cm³. Nothing else that I know of has that exact density.\"  Wallingford pursed his lips. \"Dear me,\" he said after a moment. \"I keep forgetting you're too bright for your own good.\" Then a slow smile spread over his face. \"Would you _really_ like to know?\"  \"I wouldn't have asked otherwise,\" Mike said.  \"Fine. Because you're just the man we need.\"  Mike the Angel could almost feel the knife blade sliding between his ribs, and he had the uncomfortable feeling that the person who had stabbed him in the back was himself. \"What's that supposed to mean, Wally?\"  \"You are, I believe, an officer in the Space Service Reserve,\" said Basil Wallingford in a smooth, too oily voice. \"Since the Engineering Officer of the _Branchell_, Jack Wong, is laid up in a hospital, I'm going to call you to active duty to replace him.\"  Mike the Angel felt that ghostly knife twist--hard.  \"That's silly,\" he said. \"I haven't been a ship's officer for five years.\"  \"You're the man who designed the power plant,\" Wallingford said sweetly. \"If you don't know how to run her, nobody does.\"  \"My time per hour is worth a great deal,\" Mike pointed out.  \"The rate of pay for a Space Service officer,\" Basil Wallingford said pleasantly, \"is fixed by law.\"  \"I can fight being called back to duty--and I'll win,\" said Mike. He didn't know how long he could play this game, but it was fun.  \"True,\" said Wallingford. \"You can. I admit it. But you've been wondering what the hell that ship is being built for. You'd give your left arm to find out. I know you, Golden Wings, and I know how that mind of yours works. And I tell you this: Unless you take this job, you'll _never_ find out why the _Branchell_ was built.\" He leaned forward, and his face loomed large in the screen. \"And I mean absolutely _never_.\"  For several seconds Mike the Angel said nothing. His classically handsome face was like that of some Grecian god contemplating the Universe, or an archangel contemplating Eternity. Then he gave Basil Wallingford the benefit of his full, radiant smile.  \"I capitulate,\" he said.  Wallingford refused to look impressed. \"Damn right you do,\" he said--and cut the circuit.     7   Two days later Mike the Angel was sitting at his desk making certain that M. R. GABRIEL, POWER DESIGN would function smoothly while he was gone. Serge Paulvitch, his chief designer, could handle almost everything.  Paulvitch had once said, \"Mike, the hell of working for a first-class genius is that a second-class genius doesn't have a chance.\"  \"You could start your own firm,\" Mike had said levelly. \"I'll back you, Serge; you know that.\"  Serge Paulvitch had looked astonished. \"Me? You think I'm crazy? Right now, I'm a second-class genius working for a first-class outfit. You think I want to be a second-class genius working for a second-class outfit? Not on your life!\"  Paulvitch could easily handle the firm for a few weeks.  Helen's face came on the phone. \"There's a Captain Sir Henry Quill on the phone, Mr. Gabriel. Do you wish to speak to him?\"  \"Black Bart?\" said Mike. \"I wonder what he wants.\"  \"Bart?\" She looked puzzled. \"He said his name was Henry.\"  Mike grinned. \"He always signs his name: _Captain Sir Henry Quill, Bart._ And since he's the toughest old martinet this side of the Pleiades, the 'Black' part just comes naturally. I served under him seven years ago. Put him on.\"  In half a second the grim face of Captain Quill was on the screen.  He was as bald as an egg. What little hair he did have left was meticulously shaved off every morning. He more than made up for his lack of cranial growth, however, by his great, shaggy, bristly brows, black as jet and firmly anchored to jutting supraorbital ridges. Any other man would have been proud to wear them as mustaches.  \"What can I do for you, Captain?\" Mike asked, using the proper tone of voice prescribed for the genial businessman.  \"You can go out and buy yourself a new uniform,\" Quill growled. \"Your old one isn't regulation any more.\"  Well, not exactly growled. If he'd had the voice for it, it would have been a growl, but the closest he could come to a growl was an Irish tenor rumble with undertones of gravel. He stood five-eight, and his red and gold Space Service uniform gleamed with spit-and-polish luster. With his cap off, his bald head looked as though it, too, had been polished.  Mike looked at him thoughtfully. \"I see. So you're commanding the mystery tub, eh?\" he said at last.  \"That's right,\" said the captain. \"And don't go asking me a bunch of blasted questions. I've got no more idea of what the bloody thing's about"]]]
