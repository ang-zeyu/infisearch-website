Two minutes more and they were snoring, a trio in happy forgetfulness of all their toils.  Now, it must be told that this pleasant state of things did not last long.  Fred Temple and Sam Sorrel were not the only occupants of these beds.  Truth, however disagreeable, must be revealed.  There were living creatures which not only slept in those beds, but which dwelt there when perfectly wide awake; and these creatures waged unceasing war with every human being that lay down beside them.  In a very short time the sleepers found this out.  Fred began to grow restless and to groan.  So did Sam.  In the course of an hour or so Fred uttered a fierce exclamation, and rose on his hands and knees.  So did Sam.  Then Fred and Sam began to fight--not with each other, but--with the common enemy.  The battle raged for more than an hour, during which the foe, although frequently routed, returned again and again to the charge.  Their courage and determination were tremendous.  It cannot be said that Fred and Sam were actually put to flight, but a regard for truth compels me to state that they continued _fleaing_ the greater part of that morning, and it was not until the sun was high in the heavens--pouring down a flood of light into that wild glen--that they gained the victory, and lay down to repose on their laurels and straw--not to mention the bodies of the dead and dying!  They hoped now to be rewarded for their exertions with a few hours' repose.  Vain hope!  Scarcely had they closed their eyes when the door opened, and an old woman, with nose and chin of the nutcracker type, entered the room.  This was the grandmother of the family; she had come to look at the strangers.  Grant's face, with the eyes shut and the mouth wide-open, was the first object that met her view.  She bent over him and looked into his mouth, as if anxious to examine his teeth.  Having looked him over, and felt the quality of his clothes with her shrivelled fingers, she turned to the beds and stared at the other strangers.  Fred had gone off into a sort of doze, so he bore the inspection well, but Sam was only pretending to sleep, and when he peeped up at the old face that looked down on his with kindly interest and curiosity, he found it difficult to check a smile.  Having looked at them well, and touched everything belonging to them, to see what it could be made of, the old woman moved quietly towards the door.  She shut it with a bang, however, and roused them up with a start--excepting Grant, who slept through everything, and in spite of everything.  They were just dropping off again when the old woman returned.  She had forgotten something, and was moving across the floor, when she accidentally knocked over a bench, which upset a heavy stool.  The crash was followed by a scream of alarm, and once more the sleepers were awakened--always excepting Grant.  Scarcely had this happened when a strange sound was heard outside.  It gradually became louder and more alarming.  \"What _can_ it be?\" cried Fred, leaping out of bed, and rushing to the door.  As he threw it open, there was a roar like the sudden discharge of artillery, and at the same moment a huge mass of rock, many tons in weight, bounded close past the door, went crashing through a wooden shed as if it had been a sheet of paper, and, carrying shrubs and small trees along with it, finally found a resting-place at the bottom of the glen. The huge mass had fallen from the cliffs above, and fortunately swept through the hamlet without doing further damage.  It was followed by a shower of smaller stones, some of which struck and shook the house, and produced a commotion that caused even Grant to wake up and run out in alarm.  The whole valley was covered with rocks of every shape and size, which had at various times fallen from the cliffs on either side; and one could not look at them without wondering that the little cluster of huts had not long ago been destroyed.  There are many such scenes in Norway, and accidents do sometimes occur, but not so frequently as one might expect.  It is needless to say that our travellers did not again court sleep in that wild spot.  Before another hour had passed they were over the mountains and far away on their journey to the far north.    CHAPTER SIX.  DECEPTIVE APPEARANCES--PERPETUAL DAY--PERPLEXITIES ABOUT BED-TIME-- CONFUSION OF MIND.  The scene is changed.  We are on board the _Snowflake_ and out once more among the thousands of islands off the coast far beyond the Arctic Circle now.  This is the region where the sun does not set night or day for several weeks in summer, and where he never rises night or day during several weeks in winter.  But Fred Temple has not gained his point yet.  He is behind time.  Had he arrived at this latitude a week sooner, he would have seen the sun sweep an entire circle in the sky.  But calms have delayed him, and now the sun just dips below the horizon at midnight.  A good stiff, southerly breeze of a few hours would take him far enough north; but he cannot command the winds to blow, although Bob Bowie, the steward, evidently thinks he can make it blow by whistling!  The sea is like a sheet of glass.  Meanwhile, Fred and his friends are enjoying all the delight of daylight which is perpetual.  Every thoughtful reader will at once perceive that where the sun only sets for a few minutes there can be no diminution of the light worth speaking of--nothing approaching even to twilight.  The night before the arrival of the yacht at this place the sun set a little after midnight, and in twenty minutes afterwards it rose again to pursue its brilliant course through the northern sky.  It is scarcely possible for a Christian to look on such a scene without recalling those striking passages in God's Word, which, in describing heaven, tell us that \"there shall be no night there,\" and speaks of a \"sea of glass like unto crystal,\" before the throne of God.  Well may the heart of man in such a scene exclaim with the Psalmist, \"O Lord, how manifold are Thy works!  In wisdom hast Thou made them all: the earth is full of Thy riches.\"  The islands in this particular place were positively uncountable.  They lay scattered over the calm sea in hundreds.  Some were no bigger than a boat--others were towering jagged mountains of more than four thousand feet high.  Most of them were barren, and over the smaller islets, as well as round the cliffs of the larger ones, myriads of gulls and other sea-birds flew with clamorous cries.  But for this, the scene would have been one of deep solitude as well as intense calmness.  The sea-birds, however, filled the air with life, ay, and with melody, for the plaintive cry of wild-fowl when mellowed by distance is inexpressibly sweet and agreeable.  One thing that puzzled our voyagers very much was the deceptive appearance of land, so that they found it extremely difficult to judge correctly of distance.  On one occasion, when sailing towards one of the large islands, Fred went up to Bob Bowie, who was leaning over the side watching the ripples caused by the _Snowflake_, and meditating, as he himself said, \"on things in gin'ral, and nothin' in particular.\"  It may be remarked in passing that this was not an uncommon state of mind with Bob Bowie.  \"Well, Bob,\" said Temple, \"we're going along nicely with this breeze.  I expect we shall pass that island before many hours go by.\"  \"How far d'ye think it's off, sir?\" inquired the steward.  \"About three miles,\" said Fred.  \"Three miles, sir, w'y, it's not more than one mile--if it's that.\"  \"What say you, Captain?\" asked Fred.  \"Ye better try,\" suggested McNab, with a quiet grin.  \"So I will, ho! stand by to heave the log there.  Now, Captain, steer straight as the crow flies for the island.\"  The yacht's course was altered, the log was hove, and, observing the moment of starting, they awaited the result.  Bob thought it was a smallish island with little bushes on it.  The time they took in drawing near to it first led him to doubt the correctness of his own opinion. But when the bushes began to turn into trees, and the cliffs to tower into the sky above his head, and throw a dark shadow over the vessel, he was obliged to give in.  The distance which he had imagined was not more than one mile turned out to be _five_.  On another occasion a similar case of the deceptive appearance of distance occurred.  They were sailing up a certain fiord, which most of the people on board supposed was only about a mile broad.  One of the sailors, Bill by name, insisted that it could not be more than three-quarters of a mile; and thereupon an animated discussion, amounting almost to a dispute, began.  But Bill was not to be put down. \"He was an old salt.  _He_ wasn't to be taken in by these molehills, not he!\"  He had sailed round the world, according to his own account had been shipwrecked half a dozen times, and drowned once or twice, besides being murdered occasionally; so he thought himself a weighty authority, and entitled to great respect!  Well, to settle this point the yacht was sailed straight across the fiord, and the breadth, measured by the log, was found, as in the former case, to be about five miles.  The calms, although frequent in this latitude, did not last long.  Light breezes sprang up now and then, and for several days carried our travellers to the north.  But not fast enough, for the sun still kept ahead of them.  During this period, they saw great variety of wonderful scenery, had several small adventures, and enjoyed themselves extremely.  Fred Temple usually began each calm day by jumping out of bed, rushing upon deck and going over the side, head-foremost into the water.  He was generally followed by Sam Sorrel; but Sam was inclined to be lazy, and did not always follow his friend's lead.  Grant never followed it.  He was inveterately lazy in the morning, although at all other times he was as active as a mountain goat.  Our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23262"],["title","Chasing the Sun (#8)"],["body","was particularly successful about this time with his gun. The number of birds that he shot and stuffed was enormous.  Whenever a calm prevailed, he took the light little Norse boat that had been purchased at Bergen, and went off to the nearest island with his gun. On these occasions he was usually accompanied by Sam, whose love for sketching was quite equal to that of his companion for bird-shooting and stuffing.  Fred, of course went to keep them company, and was wont to carry with him a rod, as well as a gun, for he was passionately fond of fishing.  On these occasions, too, they took Hans Ericsson with them, to assist in rowing, and to pilot them when they felt inclined to leave the yacht out of sight behind.  One day they were out on an excursion of this kind, and had rowed towards the mainland, and up a fiord.  Fred and Sam were reclining in the stern of the boat; the former smoking a meerschaum pipe, the latter making a drawing of a range of hills which were so rugged that the tops appeared like the teeth of a saw.  Grant and Hans were rowing.  \"Do you know what o'clock it was when we left the yacht?\" inquired Fred.  \"What o'clock?\" echoed Sam; \"no; well, let me see.  We went to bed last night at five o'clock this morning.\"  \"You mean that we turned in for our _night's rest_ at five this morning, I suppose,\" said Temple.  \"My dear Fred,\" retorted Sam, \"never mind what I mean; only attend to what I say.  Don't be too particular.  It's a bad habit being too particular.  I once had a friend who was too particular in his attentions to a young lady, and the result was that he was obliged to marry her.\"  \"Then, Sam,\" returned Temple, \"I should say that the habit of being too particular is a good one, if it leads to such a good thing as marriage. But to return to the point, what time of day or night do you think it is _now_?\"  \"Have not the least idea,\" said Sam; \"I think it's some time or other in the evening, but this perpetual daylight confuses me.  You know that when you and Grant were away last week after the gulls, I went to bed on Thursday forenoon at ten o'clock by mistake, thinking it was ten at night.  How I ever came to do it I can't tell, but I suppose that I had sat so long stuffing that great eagle for Grant that my brains had got obfuscated.  It was cloudy, too (not unlike what it is just now), so that I could not see the sun.  Whatever was the cause, there is no doubt of the fact that I lost a day somehow, and my ideas have got such a twist that I fear they will never recover it.\"  \"A most unfortunate state of things, truly,\" said Fred, laughing. \"Perhaps you'll recover when we return to low latitudes.  If not, there are plenty lunatic asylums.  But we must not spend more than a few hours longer on this excursion, for I've a notion that we are somewhere about Saturday just now, and you know it's against our rules to run the risk of shooting or fishing into Sunday.\"  \"Very true,\" replied Sam, as he continued his sketch.  \"I say, Grant, do you happen to have your watch with you?\"  \"Not I,\" cried Grant from the bow of the boat.  \"Since day and night took to being the same I let it run down.  I have no regard for time now.\"  \"D'ye know what day it is?\"  \"No.\"  \"Humph, it's lucky that we can depend upon the Captain for keeping us right in regard to Sunday.  Well, let's go ashore and try the mouth of yonder stream.  I'll warrant me there are sea-trout there, perhaps salmon, and the ground hereabouts seems a likely place for grouse and ptarmigan.  Pull hard, Hans, thou son of Eric, and shove the boat into yonder creek.\"  Hans Ericsson bent his strong back, and a bright smile crossed his sunburnt face as the head of the boat flew round.  \"Hallo, Hans! steady, my lad!\" cried Grant, giving his oar a pull that sent the head of the boat spinning round in the opposite direction. Then the sturdy Norseman and the stalwart Scot gave a pull together with all their might, and sent the boat like an arrow into the creek, where, in a few seconds, her keel grated on the shore.  For several hours after that the three friends were busy with their favourite pursuits.  Grant soon bagged several brace of grouse.  Fred caught a basket of splendid sea-trout, some of which were over three pounds' weight, and a small salmon of about ten pounds; while Sam Sorrel sat down on a rock and painted an elaborate picture of the scenery.  Of course their different occupations separated them from each other, but Hans kept close to Fred's elbow--for he had not only conceived a strong friendship for the young Englishman, but he was immensely delighted with fly-fishing, which he had never before witnessed.  The astonishment of Hans was great when he beheld heavy trout landed by means of a slender rod and an almost invisible line.  But when Fred hooked the salmon the excitement of the Norseman knew no bounds.  After nearly half an hour's playing of the fish, Fred drew it close to the bank, and told Hans to strike the gaff-hook into it, and lift it out of the water.  Hans in his excitement missed his aim, and the terrified fish darted away.  But Fred was prepared for this, and let out line.  Soon he brought his fish once more to the side, exhausted and rolling over.  Hans made a second attempt and was successful in landing the silvery salmon on the bank.  When they returned to the schooner after that excursion, Captain McNab was leaning over the side with a grim smile on his wooden countenance. Bob Bowie was beside him with a beaming smile on his jolly red face.  \"Good-day, Captain,\" cried Fred, as the boat drew near.  \"Well, Bowie, we're desperately hungry, I hope you've got supper ready for us.\"  \"I've got breakfast, sir,\" replied the steward.  \"Eh? ah! well, call it what you like, only let us have it soon.\"  (They clambered up the side.) \"Why, Captain, what day is it, and what time of day?\"  \"It's Friday mornin', sir, and eight o'clock.\"  Fred opened his eyes in astonishment.  \"Why, then, comrades, it seems that we have been shooting, sketching, and fishing all night by daylight, and the sun has set and risen again without our being aware of the fact!  So much for perpetual day and a cloudy sky.  Come, Bob Bowie, look alive with break--, ah! supper, I mean, for whatever it may be to you, it is supper to us.  Meanwhile, I'll have a bathe to refresh me.\"  So our hardy adventurers bathed that morning, over the side, then they supped, after which they turned in and slept all day, and rose again at six o'clock in the evening to breakfast!    CHAPTER SEVEN.  A SUNDAY ON SHORE.  Only once during their voyage along the rugged coast of Norway did our three friends go to church!  It must not be supposed, however, that therefore they were heathens.  Far from it.  Fred and his companions were truly Christian men.  That is to say, they not only called themselves Christians, but they made it their earnest aim to walk after the example of Christ, and to exhibit their Christianity by their deeds. But only once during their trip had they the opportunity of visiting a church on a Sunday forenoon when service was going on.  It happened to be on a bright calm Sunday.  There was just enough of wind to urge the _Snowflake_ through the water at the rate of two miles an hour.  Fred's usual custom was to get to a secure anchorage on Saturdays, so as to be able to spend the Sabbath as a day of rest.  But this was not always practicable, because the water was so deep close inshore that no bottom could be found in many places, and often they were obliged to continue their voyage on Sunday.  This, however, was a matter of small importance, because the working of the yacht required so little attention--especially in fine weather--that it did not interfere with the services or the rest of the day.  Fred made a point of assembling the crew and reading the Church of England service every Sunday forenoon, and a chapter or two from the Bible in the evening.  On the present occasion they were all assembled on the quarterdeck joining in the morning service.  The breeze was steady, and the steersman was the only man on duty, but he was not thereby prevented from attending to what was being read.  The vessel was gliding along close under a precipice which towered high above the mast, and, at a short distance ahead, extended out in a bold promontory or headland. Elsewhere mountainous islands hemmed them in.  When they reached the promontory Fred was reading that beautiful Psalm, the 95th,--which appeared somewhat appropriate to the occasion.  \"O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.  \"Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, and shew ourselves glad in Him with psalms.  \"For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.  \"In His hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills is His also.  \"The sea is His, and He made it: and His hands prepared the dry land.  \"O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.\"  Fred happened to look up at the last words, and an exclamation of wonder broke from him as he pointed towards the shore.  The schooner had just doubled the towering promontory, and a new scene had been suddenly opened up to view.  Just beyond the promontory the coast-line took an abrupt bend to the right, at the end of which was a sequestered little bay, with a beach of yellow sand, and a cluster of grassy mounds behind, of the brightest emerald green.  The bay and the green mounds and the strip of yellow sand were all exceedingly small, and were surrounded by a mass of rugged rocks of a cold, whitish-grey colour.  Beyond these were the great purple mountains of the mainland.  Ahead and in front towered the islands of the coast.  The whole of the surrounding scenery was wild, rugged, and barren.  This one little spot alone was soft and lovely; it shone out like a bright jewel from its dark setting.  All round the bay were clustering cottages, "]]]
