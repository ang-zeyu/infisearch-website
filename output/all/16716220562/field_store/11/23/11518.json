But Old Gripper had been aroused, and he was determined to make it hot for his recent captors, who, led by Porfias del Norte, had gone to desperate lengths to obtain valuable papers which were the basis of a business combination that threatened the interests of Del Norte and his associates.  \"Unless they move on the jump I'll have the bunch of them nipped before long,\" Old Gripper declared.  To his vexation he found it was impossible to properly swear out a warrant for the arrest of Del Norte's companions without making the journey to Saranac Lake.  \"I'll do that the first thing in the morning,\" he said.  In the morning, however, he found himself stiff and lame, and he was induced to delay until noon.  During the forenoon he decided to return without further delay to New York. Having settled on this, he sent a message to Saranac Lake, stating his charges against Porfias del Norte's band of desperadoes, and asking that the warrant be drawn up and brought to him at the station as he was passing through. He also gave instructions that officers should be on hand to immediately take up the work of running the gang down.  Before noon Belmont Bland, Old Gripper's private secretary, was apparently taken ill, and when the time came for Scott to depart Bland seemed unable to travel. He asserted that it was one of his usual nervous attacks, and declared he would be all right by the next day. Therefore it was arranged that he should remain at Lake Placid.  Frank Merriwell had given in to the urging of Warren Hatch, who almost begged him to stay over another day and fish again in the morning.  \"It's not often I strike a fisherman after my own heart,\" said Hatch. \"When I do I don't like to let him slip through my fingers. Stay over until to-morrow at least, Merriwell. There is no reason why you should tear away in such a hurry.\"  \"You can stay, Merriwell,\" declared Scott. \"We have settled the railroad deal right here. Bragg and I will get things to moving in the city. Leave that to us.\"  \"I'm very willing to leave it to you,\" laughed Frank. \"I'll stay one more day, Mr. Hatch.\"  \"If we can have another good morning to fish--ah, we won't do a thing!\" chuckled Hatch, ending with a cough.  \"You ought to stay up here for the next month,\" declared Old Gripper. \"That cough of yours----\"  \"Oh, it's nothing! I've had it for a year, and it's not serious in any way--only annoying.\"  At Saranac Lake Scott saw that the warrant for Del Norte was placed in the proper hands and the machinery of the law set in motion.  When Frank and Warren Hatch returned to the cottage of the latter they were surprised to find the place locked, the shutters closed, and an air of desertion hanging over everything.  But it was not deserted.  While Hatch was fumbling on the door they heard a stir within and a voice shouted:  \"Be afther getting away from there, ye divvils, ur Oi'll blow yez full av lead! It's arrmed Oi am to th' tathe!\"  It was the voice of Pat O'Toole, an Irishman who had been one of Del Norte's gang, but out of gratitude, had saved Frank's life and had been actively concerned in the rescue of Old Gripper.  \"O'Toole!\" cried Frank; \"why the dickens have you locked yourself up this way?\"  \"Is it you, Misther Merriwell?\" cried O'Toole, joyously. \"It's a great relafe to hear your foine, musical voice wance more! Wait a minute unthil Oi open th' dure.\"  The door was unlocked and thrown open. O'Toole stood with a rifle in his hands, looking pale and agitated. Around his waist was a belt holding a pair, of pistols and a knife.  \"What's the matter, man?\" asked Hatch. \"You look like a walking arsenal?\"  \"It's me loife Oi'm ready to defind to th' larrust gasp,\" declared the Irishman.  \"Your life? Why, what----\"  \"Oi'm in danger of bein' murthered.\"  \"In danger?\"  \"Ivery minute av me ixistence.\"  \"What makes you think that?\"  \"Oi don't think it; Oi know it. Afther ye wint away to th' shtation Oi sat on th' verandy shmokin' me poipe an' thinkin'. The longer Oi thought th' more froightened Oi became. It wur Porrfeeus dil Noort thot paid me well to assist him in a litthle schame to trap a certain young gintleman named Frank Merriwell. Oi took his money and promised to rinder me best assistance. Oi know this parrut av th' counthry well, an' so Oi was valuable to Dil Noort. Oi towld him about th' owld hut in th' valley an' th' natural well. Oi towld him a man dhropped inther thot well moight shtay there an' rot widout ivver bein' found. That wur pwhere he meant to dispose av you, Misther Merriwell. Afther that it was yersilf thot saved me loife at Sarrynack Lake. Thin Oi says, says Oi, 'O'Toole, ye miserable divvil, av ye don't git aven wid thot foine young gint, ye ought to be hanged fer a shnake.' Oi knew ye would be thrapped thot same noight, Misther Merriwell, an' Oi rode loike th' ould bhoy to cut yez off an' get me finger in the poie. You remimber pwhat happened.\"  \"I remember that you aided me to escape from the hands of Del Norte and his paid desperadoes,\" nodded Frank.  \"An' got mesilf disloiked fer it. Oi knew Dil Noort would be ready to cut me throat on soight. Oi thought th' safest thing wur to hilp capture Dil Noort, an' thot's pwhat took me here, pwhere Oi arrived just in toime to hilp in the search fer Misther Shcott.\"  \"And help us you certainly did,\" nodded Merry. \"Aided by you, we lost no time in finding the valley and the well in which Mr. Scott was imprisoned.\"  \"But it's th' divvil's own doin's there was before thot,\" said O'Toole. \"Oi wur in a bad shcrape whin Oi run inther th' hands av Bantry Hagan an' he marruched me to thot old hut, where Oi was bound hand an' foot. Nivver a bit did Oi drame th' drunk aslape on th' flure av th' hut an' shnorin' away wur yersilf, Misther Merriwell. Aven whin Oi lay chlose to yez an' ye began to untoie me bonds Oi couldn't suspict it was yersilf. Whin Dil Noort showed up Oi knew it meant throuble, an' sure it wur a relafe to feel in me hand th' pistol ye put there. Th' divvil bent over me wid a knoife in his hands, an' Oi saw murther in his oies. Thin Oi didn't wait, but Oi shot him through th' head.\"  \"But I don't understand what all this has to do with the fear you profess to feel,\" said Hatch. \"I didn't fancy you were a coward, O'Toole.\"  \"No more Oi am; but Porrfeeus dil Noort is a moighty dangerous mon, and he----\"  \"Is dead. You're not afraid of dead men?\"  \"It's dead Oi saw him before me,\" nodded the Irishman; \"but Oi wish Oi had seen him buried, so Oi do. Whin we returned afther pulling Misther Shcott out av th' well Dil Noort's body wur gone.\"  \"His companions carried it away,\" said Merry.  \"Mebbe thot's roight,\" said O'Toole; \"but afther ye left me here, wid Joe gone an' mesilf all alone, it's nervous Oi became. Oi took to thinkin' it all over, an' in th' air Oi hearrud a voice whisper, 'O'Toole, yure goose is cooked, fer, dead ur aloive. Porrfeeus dil Noort will get aven wid ye!' It made me have cowld chills down me back, an' out in th' grove yonder Oi saw shadows movin' an' crapin'. Oi began to ixpect a bullet through me body, an' afther a whoile Oi joomped up an' run inther th' cabin, jist shakin' loike Oi had a chill an' me tathe knockin' togither. Oi fashtened th' dures an' closed th' shutters av ivery windy. Thin Oi arrmed mesilf, an' nivver in all me loife did Oi hear swater music than whin ye shpoke outside, Misther Merriwell.\"  Merriwell laughed.  \"I declare, O'Toole, I'd never expect a man of your courage and wit to be frightened in such a manner. Del Norte is dead, and it's almost certain his companions have taken to their legs to get away as fast and as far as possible. Mr. Scott will have officers searching high and low for them. They are fugitives from justice. Even though they were not under the ban of the law, with Del Norte gone, there is not one chance in a hundred that any of them would ever lift a hand to annoy or molest you or me. The fall of their leader put an end to their work, and they will scatter and keep under cover until the storm blows over.\"  \"That's right, O'Toole,\" declared Warren Hatch. \"You rendered Mr. Merriwell and the rest of us a great service when you fired the shot that brought Del Norte down. They won't dare have you arrested for that shooting, as no one would venture to appear against you. If they escape from the officers, I expect we'll hear in a few days how Del Norte's body was carried out of the mountains and expressed to friends somewhere.\"  \"They may not dare do that,\" said Frank. \"They may bury him here in the mountains, rather than take any chances of being captured themselves. At any rate, it's foolish for you to worry, O'Toole. Of course it's not a pleasant thing to think you have shot a man, but you did it in self-defense, and were justified.\"  \"It's roight ye are on thot point, me bhoy; but it's a long toime before Oi'll rist aisy from thinkin' av it an' belavin' me own loife in danger. Oi'll be afeared av me own shadder in th' darruk. Porrfeeus dil Noort wur th' firrust man Oi ivver saw that made me fale as if bullets wouldn't kill him an' kape him dead. Wur he to roize before me this minute nivver a bit surphrised would Oi be.\"  Although Merry jollied the Irishman, it was no easy matter to relieve O'Toole's nervousness.  Later Belmont Bland appeared at the cottage, having sought the advice of a physician who was spending an outing at the little settlement on the southern shore.  \"I'm feeling better already,\" said Bland. \"The doctor gave me some medicine to quiet my nerves. I'll be all right to leave for the city to-morrow, I hope, although I feel that I need several days of rest.\"  Frank wondered why Bland had lingered at the lake.     CHAPTER III.  NEW ARRIVALS AT THE LAKE.   Late that afternoon Warren Hatch and Frank went out to fish and remained until after nightfall.  Lights were gleaming from the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22874"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Pursuit; Or, How to Win (#2)"],["body","windows as they rowed slowly back.  Away at the southern end of the lake were other lights, indicating the location of the little settlement of cottagers. Lake Placid was a popular resort at this season of the year.  Joe, the man of all work, came down to the shore and took care of the boat.  \"Take care of the fish, Joe,\" called Hatch, as he hastened after Merry, who was striding toward the cottage.  The shades were drawn and the place seemed silent enough until Frank opened the door and stepped inside. Then he was surprised and startled to find himself seized by four pairs of hands, which hustled him about amid bursts of laughter and shouts of welcome.  \"Hold on! hold on!\" he gasped, in the greatest astonishment, for he recognized his four assailants as his friends, Bart Hodge, Bruce Browning, Inza Burrage, and Elsie Bellwood. \"Where in the world did you all drop from?\"  \"We have run you down at last,\" said Hodge; \"but you gave us a merry old chase.\"  \"It's been the greatest game of hide and seek I ever played,\" grunted Browning, ceasing from his attack on Frank and dropping lazily on a chair, which creaked beneath his weight. \"Just when we would think we were going to put our hands on you sure you would disappear like a wizard.\"  \"Aren't you glad to see us?\" demanded Inza.  \"If you're not, we'll go right away,\" said Elsie.  \"Glad!\" cried Frank. \"I'm speechless with delight. But I don't understand it yet.\"  Then they explained how they had followed him to Boston and from that city to New York, and how in the latter place, after no end of trouble and detective work, they learned that he was off for Lake Placid, in the Adirondacks. Arriving at Newman late that afternoon, they had driven over to the cottage of Mr. Hatch, which they reached while Frank and his host were still out fishing.  \"Here is Mrs. Medford, Frank,\" said Inza, calling his attention to a smiling, middle-aged lady who sat near the open fireplace.  Mrs. Medford was a relative of Inza's who often accompanied her as companion and chaperon.  \"Mrs. Medford,\" said Merry, hastening to clasp the smiling woman's hand, \"I am delighted to see you again. I'm quite overcome with surprise and pleasure. It's evident I am, for I have forgotten Mr. Hatch.\"  No wonder Mr. Hatch had been overlooked, for he had stepped back and remained quiet during all the chatter and laughter of the meeting between Frank and his friends.  \"I am greatly pleased to meet your friends, Mr. Merriwell,\" he declared, as Frank introduced one after another. \"If the accommodations at my poor cottage----\"  \"Oh, we wouldn't think of putting you to the slightest inconvenience!\" declared Inza. \"We can find accommodations in Newman, Mr. Hatch, and we wouldn't think of----\"  \"Unless it is too uncomfortable here,\" Hatch hastened to say, \"I shall consider it a favor to entertain you as the friends of the cleverest fisherman and finest young man it has been my good fortune to meet in twenty years. Anything and everything here is yours as long as you choose to remain, and you can't remain too long for me.\"  That was quite enough, for they saw he was in earnest. He could thaw out and be genial and pleasant when he chose, and this was an occasion when he had no difficulty in thawing. He called Joe and gave orders about supper, and soon the delightful odor of cooking fish came faintly to their nostrils.  While supper was being prepared Frank related the story of the many adventures which had befallen him since he hastily left Maine in pursuit of the Mexican who had stolen one of his valuable papers.  As she listened Inza flushed and paled by turns. She was elated by his success, and she found it difficult to check a tremor as she realized how many times he had been in deadly danger.  \"Where is O'Toole?\" cried Hodge, as Frank finished. \"I want to congratulate him on his job in ending the career of that snake, Del Norte.\"  O'Toole was aiding Joe in the cook house, and he was finally induced, under protest, to appear in the cottage. He stood before Frank's friends, grinning bashfully and bowing awkwardly.  \"O'Toole,\" said Bart, shaking the Irishman's hand, \"you never did a better bit of work in all your life than when you shot Porfias del Norte.\"  \"It's not so sure Oi am av that,\" declared the man. \"It's nivver a bit will Oi shlape till Oi know fer sure th' baste is dead an' burried six fate under ground.\"  \"Why, Frank said you shot him through the head.\"  \"Oi did thot, but whin we returned to th' hut pwhere he was it's up an' gone he had.\"  \"Frank says the body was carried off by his friends.\"  \"Mebbe it wur, Oi dunno; but whoy th' ould scratch they wur afther takin' all thot throuble an' risk is pwhat bates me. Somehow Oi'm thinkin' th' mon up an' walked away all by hissilf, an' it's cowld chills Oi git from thinkin' he may be lookin' fer me to sittle our account.\"  \"You'll get over that feeling after a while,\" said Hodge. \"Frank knows when a man is dead, and you heard him pronounce Del Norte dead.\"  In Browning's ear Frank whispered:  \"I confess I'd feel better satisfied if I had seen him buried; but I don't intend to tell O'Toole that.\"  In due time supper was cooked and served in the plain but comfortable dining room. The death of Del Norte was forgotten, and it was a jolly crowd that gathered about the large table.  \"Hold me!\" cried Browning, as he drank in the odor of baked potatoes, cooked fish and steaming coffee. \"If you don't look out I'll wade in here and create a famine. I feel as if I might eat everything on this table without half trying.\"  \"There is plenty of everything,\" said Warren Hatch. \"Joe tells me there is more fish. Here he comes with some of his hot biscuits right out of the oven.\"  Joe appeared with a heaping plate of biscuits, and soon all were enjoying the meal.  Inza was unusually vivacious, her cheeks being flushed and her dark eyes sparkling. The pleasure of being with Frank again was enough to put her at her best, and indeed she was a most beautiful girl.  Elsie was quieter, but there was no mistaking the expression of deep satisfaction which hovered on her sweet face. The fact that Inza was happy was enough to give her pleasure.  In the midst of the meal there came a rapping at the door. Mr. Hatch answered the summons and was gone some time. When he returned he explained that there was to be a masquerade dance at a pavilion used for dances and picnics down at the cottage village, and, having learned of the presence of guests at his cottage, invitations had been extended to them all.  \"Perfectly jolly!\" cried Inza. \"But we have no costumes.\"  \"Never mind that,\" said Mr. Hatch. \"Without doubt there will be others in the same predicament. You can easily manufacture some masks, and, being strangers here, no one outside your own party will recognize you. I'm sorry I can't assist you in the matter of dress, but I can help the male members of the party. I have a full Indian rig and a cowboy outfit, which will do for two. The third can dress in old clothes, like a hunter or guide. The whole thing can be arranged somehow if you care to go. Where there's a will there's a way, you know.\"  \"Oh, say,\" grunted Browning, \"count me out. I'm no dancer. Besides that, I'm tired.\"  \"The same old complaint,\" laughed Frank. \"What do you think about it, Elsie?\"  \"If Inza wishes to go, I'm ready,\" answered Elsie. \"We might have a good time.\"  Hodge expressed a willingness to go along, and then Frank cried:  \"It's a go, my children! Let's enter into this thing in earnest and have a high old time. Bruce, you ought to be ashamed of your laziness.\"  \"Don't begin that old song!\" said the big fellow. \"There's not enough laziness in this world. Everybody howls about strenuousness and hustle, and people wear themselves out and die before they should. I'm setting a good example, and I'll continue to set.\"  \"Or sit,\" nodded Merry. \"All right, Lazybones, stay here by your lonesome and content yourself thinking what a fine time we're having.\"  \"Thanks,\" grunted Bruce.     CHAPTER IV.  TWO GHOSTS.   The colony on the south shore of Lake Placid was about to break up. Cold weather was setting in. Already many of those who had spent much of the summer there were gone. Others were going. Soon that region would be left entirely to the hunters and the fishermen.  Before returning to the city the cottagers had planned a last grand time in the form of a masquerade dance. They did not call it a \"ball.\" There was to be nothing formal about it.  Thus it happened that the party at Warren Hatch's cottage received an invitation.  Mrs. Medford was tired; she would not attend the dance; but she offered to assist the girls in getting up their costumes.  \"Costumes!\" cried Inza. \"Where will we find them? We'll have to go without special preparation in that line. Frank and Bart are the lucky ones.\"  \"Come with me,\" smiled Mrs. Medford, after consulting in a low tone with Mr. Hatch, who smiled and nodded. \"Perhaps we can find something.\"  The girls followed her to the upper part of the cottage, leaving Frank and Bart to make up below.  Merry gave Bart his choice of the two rigs, and Hodge took the Indian outfit, leaving the cowboy costume for Frank.  At intervals the sound of laughter came from above, indicating that the girls were making progress.  Mrs. Medford came down first and announced that the girls would follow in two or three minutes.  \"They are putting on the finishing touches,\" she said.  She professed to be alarmed by the fierce appearance of Merriwell, who swaggered toward her in \"chaps,\" woolen shirt, and wide-brimmed hat, a loose belt about his waist, with a pistol peeping from the holster, while his face was hidden by a mask in keeping with the rest of his outfit.  \"It's a whole lot tired we're getting of waiting for them yere gals, madam,\" said Frank. \"I opine they'd better hurry some, for we'll have to hike right lively if we shake a hoof at this dance to-night.\"  Then Hodge danced forward in his Indian rig,"]]]
