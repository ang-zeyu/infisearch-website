It consisted of a selection of translations from nearly one hundred French poets, chosen by the poetess herself on a principle of her own which gradually dawned upon the careful reader. She eschewed the Classicist writers as though they had never existed. For her André Chenier was the next name in chronological order after Du Bartas. Occasionally she showed a profundity of research that would have done no discredit to Mr. Saintsbury or \"le doux Assellineau.\" She was ready to pronounce an opinion on Napol le Pyrénéan or to detect a plagiarism in Baudelaire. But she thought that Alexander Smith was still alive, and she was curiously vague about the career of Saint Beuve. This inequality of equipment was a thing inevitable to her isolation, and hardly worth recording, except to show how laborious her mind was, and how quick to make the best of small resources.  We have already seen that the \"Sheaf gleaned in French Fields\" attracted the very minimum of attention in England. In France it was talked about a little more. M. Garcin de Tassy, the famous Orientalist, who scarcely survived Toru by twelve months, spoke of it to Mlle. Clarisse Bader, author of a somewhat remarkable book on the position of women in ancient Indian society. Almost simultaneously this volume fell into the hands of Toru, and she was moved to translate it into English, for the use of Hindus less instructed than herself. In January, 1877, she accordingly wrote to Mlle. Bader requesting her authorization, and received a prompt and kind reply. On the 18th of March Toru wrote again to this, her solitary correspondent in the world of European literature, and her letter, which has been preserved, shows that she had already descended into the valley of the shadow of death:--      Ma constitution n'est pas forte; j'ai contracté une toux opiniâtre,     il y a plus de deux ans, qui ne me quitte point. Cependant j'espère     mettre la main à l'[oe]uvre bientôt. Je ne peux dire, mademoiselle,     combien votre affection,--car vous les aimez, votre livre et votre     lettre en témoignent assez,--pour mes compatriotes et mon pays me     touche; et je suis fière de pouvoir le dire que les héroines de nos     grandes épopées sont dignes de tout honneur et de tout amour. Y     a-ti-il d'héroine plus touchante, plus aimable que Sîta? Je ne le     crois pas. _Quand j'entends ma mère chanter, le soir, les vieux     chants de notre pays, je pleure presque toujours._ La plainte de     Sîta, quand, bannie pour la séconde fois, elle erre dans la vaste     forêt, seule, le désespoir et l'effroi dans l'âme, est si pathétique     qu'il n'y a personne, je crois, qui puisse l'entendre sans verser     des larmes. Je vous envois sous ce pli deux petites traductions du     Sanscrit, cette belle langue antique. Malheureusement j'ai été     obligée de faire cesser mes traductions de Sanscrit, il y a six     mois. Ma santé ne me permet pas de les continuer.  These simple and pathetic words, in which the dying poetess pours out her heart to the one friend she had, and that one gained too late, seem as touching and as beautiful as any strain of Marceline Valmore's immortal verse. In English poetry I do not remember anything that exactly parallels their resigned melancholy. Before the month of March was over, Toru had taken to her bed. Unable to write, she continued to read, strewing her sick-room with the latest European books, and entering with interest into the questions raised by the Société Asiatique of Paris in its printed Transactions. On the 30th of July she wrote her last letter to Mlle. Clarisse Bader, and a month later, on the 30th of August, 1877, at the age of twenty-one years, six months, and twenty-six days, she breathed her last in her father's house in Maniktollah Street, Calcutta.  In the first distraction of grief it seemed as though her unequalled promise had been entirely blighted, and as though she would be remembered only by her single book. But as her father examined her papers, one completed work after another revealed itself. First a selection from the sonnets of the Comte de Grammont, translated into English, turned up, and was printed in a Calcutta magazine; then some fragments of an English story, which were printed in another Calcutta magazine. Much more important, however, than any of these was a complete romance, written in French, being the identical story for which her sister Aru had proposed to make the illustrations. In the meantime Toru was no sooner dead than she began to be famous. In May, 1878, there appeared a second edition of the \"Sheaf gleaned in French Fields,\" with a touching sketch of her death, by her father; and in 1879 was published, under the editorial care of Mlle. Clarisse Bader, the romance of \"Le Journal de Mlle. D'Arvers,\" forming a handsome volume of 259 pages. This book, begun, as it appears, before the family returned from Europe, and finished nobody knows when, is an attempt to describe scenes from modern French society, but it is less interesting as an experiment of the fancy, than as a revelation of the mind of a young Hindu woman of genius. The story is simple, clearly told, and interesting; the studies of character have nothing French about them, but they are full of vigour and originality. The description of the hero is most characteristically Indian.--      Il est beau en effet. Sa taille est haute, mais quelques-uns la     trouveraient mince, sa chevelure noire est bouclée et tombe jusqu'à     la nuque; ses yeux noirs sont profonds et bien fendus, le front est     noble; la lèvre supérieure, couverte par une moustache naissante et     noire, est parfaitement modelée; son menton a quelque chose de     sévère; son teint est d'un blanc presque féminin, ce qui dénote sa     haute naissance.  In this description we seem to recognize some Surya or Soma of Hindu mythology, and the final touch, meaningless as applied to an European, reminds us that in India whiteness of skin has always been a sign of aristocratic birth, from the days when it originally distinguished the conquering Aryas from the indigenous race of the Dasyous.  As a literary composition \"Mlle. D'Arvers\" deserves high commendation. It deals with the ungovernable passion of two brothers for one placid and beautiful girl, a passion which leads to fratricide and madness. That it is a very melancholy and tragical story is obvious from this brief sketch of its contents, but it is remarkable for coherence and self-restraint no less than for vigour of treatment. Toru Dutt never sinks to melodrama in the course of her extraordinary tale, and the wonder is that she is not more often fantastic and unreal.  But we believe that the original English poems, which we present to the public for the first time to-day, will be ultimately found to constitute Toru's chief legacy to posterity. These ballads form the last and most matured of her writings, and were left so far fragmentary at her death that the fourth and fifth in her projected series of nine were not to be discovered in any form among her papers. It is probable that she had not even commenced them. Her father, therefore, to give a certain continuity to the series, has filled up these blanks with two stories from the \"Vishnupurana,\" which originally appeared respectively in the \"Calcutta Review\" and in the \"Bengal Magazine.\" These are interesting, but a little rude in form, and they have not the same peculiar value as the rhymed octo-syllabic ballads. In these last we see Toru no longer attempting vainly, though heroically, to compete with European literature on its own ground, but turning to the legends of her own race and country for inspiration. No modern Oriental has given us so strange an insight into the conscience of the Asiatic as is presented in the stories of \"Prehlad\" and of \"Savitri,\" or so quaint a piece of religious fancy as the ballad of \"Jogadhya Uma.\" The poetess seems in these verses to be chanting to herself those songs of her mother's race to which she always turned with tears of pleasure. They breathe a Vedic solemnity and simplicity of temper, and are singularly devoid of that littleness and frivolity which seem, if we may judge by a slight experience, to be the bane of modern India.  As to the merely technical character of these poems, it may be suggested that in spite of much in them that is rough and inchoate, they show that Toru was advancing in her mastery of English verse. Such a stanza as this, selected out of many no less skilful, could hardly be recognized as the work of one by whom the language was a late acquirement:--      What glorious trees! The sombre saul,       On which the eye delights to rest,--     The betel-nut, a pillar tall,       With feathery branches for a crest,--     The light-leaved tamarind spreading wide,--       The pale faint-scented bitter neem,     The seemul, gorgeous as a bride,       With flowers that have the ruby's gleam.  In other passages, of course, the text reads like a translation from some stirring ballad, and we feel that it gives but a faint and discordant echo of the music welling in Toru's brain. For it must frankly be confessed that in the brief May-day of her existence she had not time to master our language as Blanco White did, or as Chamisso mastered German. To the end of her days, fluent and graceful as she was, she was not entirely conversant with English, especially with the colloquial turns of modern speech. Often a very fine thought is spoiled for hypercritical ears by the queer turn of expression which she has innocently given to it. These faults are found to a much smaller degree in her miscellaneous poems. Her sonnets, here printed for the first time, seem to me to be of great beauty, and her longer piece entitled \"Our Casuarina Tree,\" needs no apology for its rich and mellifluous numbers.  It is difficult to exaggerate when we try to estimate what we have "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],["title","Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#2)"],["body","in the premature death of Toru Dutt. Literature has no honours which need have been beyond the grasp of a girl who at the age of twenty-one, and in languages separated from her own by so deep a chasm, had produced so much of lasting worth. And her courage and fortitude were worthy of her intelligence. Among \"last words\" of celebrated people, that which her father has recorded, \"It is only the physical pain that makes me cry,\" is not the least remarkable, or the least significant of strong character. It was to a native of our island, and to one ten years senior to Toru, to whom it was said, in words more appropriate, surely, to her than to Oldham,      Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,     Still showed a quickness, and maturing time     But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of Rime.  That mellow sweetness was all that Toru lacked to perfect her as an English poet, and of no other Oriental who has ever lived can the same be said. When the history of the literature of our country comes to be written, there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile exotic blossom of song.                                                        EDMUND W. GOSSE.  1881.     ANCIENT BALLADS OF HINDUSTAN.     I.  SAVITRI.   PART I.      Savitri was the only child       Of Madra's wise and mighty king;     Stern warriors, when they saw her, smiled,       As mountains smile to see the spring.     Fair as a lotus when the moon       Kisses its opening petals red,     After sweet showers in sultry June!       With happier heart, and lighter tread,     Chance strangers, having met her, past,       And often would they turn the head     A lingering second look to cast,       And bless the vision ere it fled.      What was her own peculiar charm?       The soft black eyes, the raven hair,     The curving neck, the rounded arm,       All these are common everywhere.     Her charm was this--upon her face       Childlike and innocent and fair,     No man with thought impure or base       Could ever look;--the glory there,     The sweet simplicity and grace,       Abashed the boldest; but the good     God's purity there loved to trace,       Mirrored in dawning womanhood.      In those far-off primeval days       Fair India's daughters were not pent     In closed zenanas. On her ways       Savitri at her pleasure went     Whither she chose,--and hour by hour       With young companions of her age,     She roamed the woods for fruit or flower,       Or loitered in some hermitage,     For to the Munis gray and old       Her presence was as sunshine glad,     They taught her wonders manifold       And gave her of the best they had.      Her father let her have her way       In all things, whether high or low;     He feared no harm; he knew no ill       Could touch a nature pure as snow.     Long childless, as a priceless boon       He had obtained this child at last     By prayers, made morning, night, and noon       With many a vigil, many a fast;     Would Shiva his own gift recall,       Or mar its perfect beauty ever?--     No, he had faith,--he gave her all       She wished, and feared and doubted never.      And so she wandered where she pleased       In boyish freedom. Happy time!     No small vexations ever teased,       Nor crushing sorrows dimmed her prime.     One care alone, her father felt--       Where should he find a fitting mate     For one so pure?--His thoughts long dwelt       On this as with his queen he sate.     \"Ah, whom, dear wife, should we select?\"       \"Leave it to God,\" she answering cried,     \"Savitri, may herself elect       Some day, her future lord and guide.\"      Months passed, and lo, one summer morn       As to the hermitage she went     Through smiling fields of waving corn,       She saw some youths on sport intent,     Sons of the hermits, and their peers,       And one among them tall and lithe     Royal in port,--on whom the years       Consenting, shed a grace so blithe,     So frank and noble, that the eye       Was loth to quit that sun-browned face;     She looked and looked,--then gave a sigh,       And slackened suddenly her pace.      What was the meaning--was it love?       Love at first sight, as poets sing,     Is then no fiction? Heaven above       Is witness, that the heart its king     Finds often like a lightning flash;       We play,--we jest,--we have no care,--     When hark a step,--there comes no crash,--       But life, or silent slow despair.     Their eyes just met,--Savitri past       Into the friendly Muni's hut,     Her heart-rose opened had at last--       Opened no flower can ever shut.      In converse with the gray-haired sage       She learnt the story of the youth,     His name and place and parentage--       Of royal race he was in truth.     Satyavan was he hight,--his sire       Dyoumatsen had been Salva's king,     But old and blind, opponents dire       Had gathered round him in a ring     And snatched the sceptre from his hand;       Now,--with his queen and only son     He lived a hermit in the land,       And gentler hermit was there none.      With many tears was said and heard       The story,--and with praise sincere     Of Prince Satyavan; every word       Sent up a flush on cheek and ear,     Unnoticed. Hark! The bells remind       'Tis time to go,--she went away,     Leaving her virgin heart behind,       And richer for the loss. A ray,     Shot down from heaven, appeared to tinge       All objects with supernal light,     The thatches had a rainbow fringe,       The cornfields looked more green and bright.      Savitri's first care was to tell       Her mother all her feelings new;     The queen her own fears to dispel       To the king's private chamber flew.     \"Now what is it, my gentle queen,       That makes thee hurry in this wise?\"     She told him, smiles and tears between,       All she had heard; the king with sighs     Sadly replied:--\"I fear me much!       Whence is his race and what his creed?     Not knowing aught, can we in such       A matter delicate, proceed?\"      As if the king's doubts to allay,       Came Narad Muni to the place     A few days after. Old and gray,       All loved to see the gossip's face,     Great Brahma's son,--adored of men,       Long absent, doubly welcome he     Unto the monarch, hoping then       By his assistance, clear to see.     No god in heaven, nor king on earth,       But Narad knew his history,--     The sun's, the moon's, the planets' birth       Was not to him a mystery.      \"Now welcome, welcome, dear old friend,       All hail, and welcome once again!\"     The greeting had not reached its end,       When glided like a music-strain     Savitri's presence through the room.--       \"And who is this bright creature, say,     Whose radiance lights the chamber's gloom--       Is she an Apsara or fay?\"     \"No son thy servant hath, alas!       This is my one,--my only child;\"--     \"And married?\"--\"No.\"--\"The seasons pass,       Make haste, O king,\"--he said, and smiled.      \"That is the very theme, O sage,       In which thy wisdom ripe I need;     Seen hath she at the hermitage       A youth to whom in very deed     Her heart inclines.\"--\"And who is he?\"       \"My daughter, tell his name and race,     Speak as to men who best love thee.\"       She turned to them her modest face,     And answered quietly and clear.--       \"Ah, no! ah, no!--It cannot be--     Choose out another husband, dear,\"--       The Muni cried,--\"or woe is me!\"      \"And why should I? When I have given       My heart away, though but in thought,     Can I take back? Forbid it, Heaven!       It were a deadly sin, I wot.     And why should I? I know no crime       In him or his.\"--\"Believe me, child,     My reasons shall be clear in time,       I speak not like a madman wild;     Trust me in this.\"--\"I cannot break       A plighted faith,--I cannot bear     A wounded conscience.\"--\"Oh, forsake       This fancy, hence may spring despair.\"--      \"It may not be.\"--The father heard       By turns the speakers, and in doubt     Thus interposed a gentle word,--       \"Friend should to friend his mind speak out,     Is he not worthy? tell us.\"--\"Nay,       All worthiness is in Satyavan,     And no one can my praise gainsay:       Of solar race--more god than man!     Great Soorasen, his ancestor,       And Dyoumatsen his father blind     Are known to fame: I can aver       No kings have been so good and kind.\"      \"Then where, O Muni, is the bar?       If wealth be gone, and kingdom lost,     His merit still remains a star,       Nor melts his lineage like the frost.     For riches, worldly power, or rank       I care not,--I would have my son     Pure, wise, and brave,--the Fates I thank       I see no hindrance, no, not one.\"     \"Since thou insistest, King, to hear       The fatal truth,--I tell you,--I,     Upon this day as rounds the year       The young Prince Satyavan shall die.\"      This was enough. The monarch knew       The future was no sealèd book     To Brahma's son. A clammy dew       Spread on his brow,--he gently took     Savitri's palm in his, and said:       \"No child can give away her hand,     A pledge is nought unsanctionèd;       And here, if right I understand,     There was no pledge at all,--a thought,       A shadow,--barely crossed the mind--     Unblamed, it may be clean forgot,       Before the gods it cannot bind.      \"And think upon the dreadful curse       Of widowhood; the vigils, fasts,     And penances; no life is worse       Than hopeless life,--the while it lasts.     Day follows day in one long round,       Monotonous and blank and drear;     Less painful were it to be bound       On some bleak rock, for aye to hear--     Without one chance of getting free--       The ocean's melancholy voice!     Mine be the sin,--if sin there be,       But thou must make a different choice.\"      In the meek grace of virginhood       Unblanched her cheek, undimmed her eye,  "]]]
