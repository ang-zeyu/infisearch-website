CONCLUSION     CHESTER RAND.     CHAPTER I.  SILAS TRIPP.   Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in other local offices.  The store was in the center of the village, nearly opposite the principal church—there were two—and here it was that the townspeople gathered to hear and discuss the news.  Silas Tripp had one assistant, a stout, pleasant-looking boy of fifteen, who looked attractive, despite his well-worn suit. Chester Rand was the son of a widow, who lived in a tiny cottage about fifty rods west of the Presbyterian church, of which, by the way, Silas Tripp was senior deacon, for he was a leader in religious as well as secular affairs.  Chester’s father had died of pneumonia about four years before the story commences, leaving his widow the cottage and about two hundred and fifty dollars. This sum little by little had melted, and a month previous the last dollar had been spent for the winter’s supply of coal.  Mrs. Rand had earned a small income by plain sewing and binding shoes for a shoe shop in the village, but to her dismay the announcement had just been made that the shop would close through the winter on account of the increased price of leather and overproduction during the year.  “What shall we do, Chester?” she asked, in alarm, when the news came. “We can’t live on your salary, and I get very little sewing to do.”  “No, mother,” said Chester, his own face reflecting her anxiety; “we can’t live on three dollars a week.”  “I have been earning two dollars by binding shoes,” said Mrs. Rand. “It has been hard enough to live on five dollars a week, but I don’t know how we can manage on three.”  “I’ll tell you what I’ll do, mother. I’ll ask Mr. Tripp to raise my pay to four dollars a week.”  “But will he do it? He is a very close man, and always pleading poverty.”  “But I happen to know that he has ten thousand dollars invested in Pennsylvania Railroad stock. I overheard him saying so to Mr. Gardner.”  “Ten thousand dollars! It seems a fortune!” sighed Mrs. Rand. “Why do some people have so much and others so little?”  “It beats me, mother. But I don’t think either of us would exchange places with Silas Tripp with all his money. By the way, mother, Mr. Tripp is a widower. Why don’t you set your cap for him?”  Mrs. Rand smiled, as her imagination conjured up the weazened and wrinkled face of the village storekeeper, with his gray hair standing up straight on his head like a natural pompadour.  “If you want Mr. Tripp for a stepfather,” she said, “I will see what I can do to ingratiate myself with him.”  “No, a thousand times no!” replied Chester, with a shudder. “I’d rather live on one meal a day than have you marry him.”  “I agree with you, Chester. We will live for each other, and hope for something to turn up.”  “I hope the first thing to turn up will be an increase of salary. To-morrow is New Year’s Day, and it will be a good time to ask.”  Accordingly, that evening, just as the store was about to close, Chester gathered up courage and said: “Mr. Tripp.”  “Well, that’s my name,” said Silas, looking over his iron-bowed spectacles.  “To-morrow is New Year’s Day.”  “What if ’tis? I reckon I knew that without your tellin’ me.”  “I came here last New Year’s Day. I’ve been here a year.”  “What if you have?”  “And I thought perhaps you might be willing to raise my salary to four dollars a week,” continued Chester, hurriedly.  “Oho, that’s what you’re after, is it?” said Silas, grimly. “You think I’m made of money, I reckon. Now, don’t you?”  “No, I don’t; but, Mr. Tripp, mother and I find it very hard to get along, really we do. She won’t have any more shoes to bind for three months to come, on account of the shoe shop’s closing.”  “It’s going to hurt me, too,” said Silas, with a frown. “When one business suspends it affects all the rest. I’ll have mighty hard work to make both ends meet.”  This struck Chester as ludicrous, but he did not feel inclined to laugh. Here was Silas Tripp gathering in trade from the entire village and getting not a little in addition from outlying towns, complaining that he would find it hard to make both ends meet, though everyone said that he did not spend one-third of his income. On the whole, things did not look very encouraging.  “Perhaps,” he said, nervously, “you would raise me to three dollars and a half?”  “What is the boy thinkin’ of? You must think I’m made of money. Why, three dollars is han’some pay for what little you do.”  “Why, I work fourteen hours a day,” retorted Chester.  “I’m afraid you’re gettin’ lazy. Boys shouldn’t complain of their work. The fact is, Chester, I feel as if I was payin’ you too much.”  “Too much! Three dollars a week too much!”  “Too much, considerin’ the state of business, and yourself bein’ a boy. I’ve been meanin’ to tell you that I’ve got a chance to get a cheaper boy.”  “Who is it?” asked Chester, in dismay.  “It’s Abel Wood. Abel Wood is every mite as big and strong as you are, and he come round last evenin’ and said he’d work for two dollars and a quarter a week.”  “I couldn’t work for that,” said Chester.  “I don’t mind bein’ generous, considerin’ you’ve been working for me more than a year. I’ll give you two dollars and a half. That’s twenty-five cents more’n the Wood boy is willin’ to take.”  “Abel Wood doesn’t know anything about store work.”  “I’ll soon learn him. Sitooated as I am, I feel that I must look after every penny,” and Mr. Tripp’s face looked meaner and more weazened than ever as he fixed his small, bead-like eyes on his boy clerk.  “Then I guess I’ll have to leave you, Mr. Tripp,” said Chester, with a deep feeling of disgust and dismay.  “Do just as you like,” said his employer. “You’re onreasonable to expect to get high pay when business is dull.”  “High pay!” repeated Chester, bitterly. “Three dollars a week!”  “It’s what I call high pay. When I was a boy, I only earned two dollars a week.”  “Money would go further when you were a boy.”  “Yes, it did. Boys wasn’t so extravagant in them days.”  “I don’t believe you were ever extravagant, Mr. Tripp,” said Chester, with a tinge of sarcasm which his employer didn’t detect.  “No, I wasn’t. I don’t want to brag, but I never spent a cent foolishly. Do you know how much money I spent the first three months I was at work?”  “A dollar?” guessed Chester.  “A dollar!” repeated Mr. Tripp, in a tone of disapproval. “No, I only spent thirty-seven cents.”  “Then I don’t wonder you got rich,” said Chester, with a curl of the lip.  “I ain’t rich,” said Silas Tripp, cautiously. “Who told you I was?”  “Everybody says so.”  “Then everybody is wrong. I’m a leetle ’forehanded, that’s all.”  “I’ve heard people say you could afford to give up work and live on the interest of your money.”  Silas Tripp held up his hands as if astounded.  “’Tain’t so,” he said, sharply. “If I gave up business, I’d soon be in the poorhouse. Well, what do you say? Will you stay along and work for two dollars and a half a week?”  “I couldn’t do it,” said Chester, troubled.  “All right! It’s jest as you say. Your week ends to-morrow night. If you see Abel Wood, you can tell him I want to see him.”  “I will,” answered Chester, bitterly.  As he walked home he felt very despondent. Wouldn’t it have been better, he asked himself, to accept reduced wages than to give up his job? It would have been hard enough to attempt living on two dollars and a half a week, but that was better than no income at all. And yet, it looked so mean in Silas Tripp to present such an alternative, when he was abundantly able to give him the increase he asked for.  “I must tell mother and see what she thinks about it,” he said to himself.     CHAPTER II.  OUT OF WORK.   Chester had a talk with his mother that evening. She felt indignant at Silas Tripp’s meanness, but advised Chester to remain in the store for the present.  “I’d rather work anywhere else for two dollars,” said Chester, bitterly.  It would be humiliating enough to accept the reduction, but he felt that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23108"],["title","Chester Rand; or, The New Path to Fortune (#1)"],["body","to his mother required the sacrifice. He started on his way to the store in the morning, prepared to notify Mr. Tripp that he would remain, but he found that it was too late. Just before he reached the store, he met Abel Wood, a loose-jointed, towheaded boy, with a stout body and extraordinarily long legs, who greeted him with a grin.  “I’m goin’ to work in your place Monday mornin’,” he said.  “Has Mr. Tripp spoken to you?” asked Chester, his heart sinking.  “Yes, he said you was goin’ to leave. What’s up?”  “Mr. Tripp cut down my wages,” said Chester. “I couldn’t work for two dollars and a half.”  “He’s only goin’ to give me two and a quarter.”  “You can afford to work for that. Your father’s got steady work.”  “Yes, but all the same I’ll ask for more in a few weeks. Where are you goin’ to work?”  “I don’t know yet,” answered Chester, sadly.  “It’s awful hard to get a place in Wyncombe.”  “I suppose it is. I hope something will turn up.”  He tried to speak hopefully, but there was very little hope in his heart.  He went about his work in a mechanical way, but neglected nothing. When the time came for the store to close, Silas Tripp took three dollars from the drawer and handed it to him, saying: “There’s your wages, Chester. I expect it’s the last I’ll pay you.”  “Yes, sir, I suppose so.”  “I don’t know how I’ll like the Wood boy. He hain’t no experience.”  “He’ll get it, sir.”  “If you want to stay for two and a quarter—the same I’m going to give him—I’ll tell him I’ve changed my mind.”  “No, sir; it wouldn’t be right to put him off now. I guess I’ll get something else to do.”  He turned and left the store, walking with a slower step than usual. His heart was heavy, for he felt that, poorly as they lived hitherto, they must live more poorly still in the days to come. He reached home at last, and put the three dollars in his mother’s hands.  “I don’t know when I shall have any more money to give you, mother,” he said.  “It looks dark, Chester, but the Lord reigns. He will still be our friend.”  There was something in these simple words that cheered Chester, and a weight seemed lifted from his heart. He felt that they were not quite friendless, and that there was still One, kinder and more powerful than any earthly friend, to whom they could look for help.  When Monday morning came he rose at the usual hour and breakfasted.  “I’ll go out and take a walk, mother,” he said. “Perhaps I may find some work somewhere.”  Almost unconsciously, he took the familiar way to the store, and paused at a little distance from it. He saw Abel come out with some packages to carry to a customer. It pained him to see another boy in his place, and he turned away with a sigh.  During the night four or five inches of snow had fallen. This gave him an idea. As he came to the house of the Misses Cleveland, two maiden sisters who lived in a small cottage set back fifty feet from the road, he opened the gate and went up to the front door.  Miss Jane Cleveland opened it for him.  “Good-morning, Chester,” she said.  “Good-morning, Miss Cleveland. I thought you might want to get a path shoveled to the gate.”  “So I would; Hannah tried to do it last time it snowed, but she caught an awful cold. But ain’t you working up at the store?”  “Not now. Mr. Tripp cut down my wages, and I left.”  “Do tell. Have you got another place?”  “Not just yet. I thought I’d do any little jobs that came along till I got one.”  “That’s right. What’ll you charge to shovel a path?”  Chester hesitated.  “Fifteen cents,” he answered, at last.  “I’ll give you ten. Money’s skerce.”  Chester reflected that he could probably do the job in half an hour, and he accepted. It cheered him to think he was earning something, however small.  He worked with a will, and in twenty-five minutes the work was done.  “You’re spry,” said Jane Cleveland, when he brought the shovel to the door. “It took Hannah twice as long, and she didn’t do it as well.”  “It isn’t the kind of work for ladies,” replied Chester.  “Wait till I fetch the money.”  Miss Cleveland went into the house, and returned with a nickel and four pennies.  “I’m reely ashamed,” she said. “I’ll have to owe you a cent. But here’s a mince pie I’ve just baked. Take it home to your ma. Maybe it’ll come handy. I’ll try to think of the other cent next time you come along.”  “Don’t trouble yourself about it, Miss Cleveland. The pie is worth a good deal more than the cent. Mother’ll be very much obliged to you.”  “She’s very welcome, I’m sure,” said the kindly spinster. “I hope you’ll get work soon, Chester.”  “Thank you.”  Chester made his way homeward, as he did not care to carry the pie about with him. His mother looked at him in surprise as he entered the house.  “What have you there, Chester?” she asked.  “A pie from Miss Cleveland.”  “But how came she to give you a pie?”  “I shoveled a path for her, and she gave me a pie and ten cents—no, nine. So you see, mother, I’ve earned something this week.”  “I take it as a good omen. A willing hand will generally find work to do.”  “How are you off for wood, mother?”  “There is some left, Chester.”  “I’ll go out in the yard and work at the wood pile till dinner time. Then this afternoon I will go out again and see if I can find some more paths to shovel.”  But Chester was not destined to earn any more money that day. As a general thing, the village people shoveled their own paths, and would regard hiring such work done as sinful extravagance. Chester did, however, find some work to do. About half-past three he met Abel Wood tugging a large basket, filled with groceries, to the minister’s house. He had set it down, and was resting his tired arms when Chester came along.  “Give me a lift with this basket, Chester, that’s a good fellow,” said Abel.  Chester lifted it.  “Yes, it is heavy,” he said.  “The minister’s got some company,” went on Abel, “and he’s given an extra large order.”  “How do you like working in the store, Abel?”  “It’s hard work, harder than I thought.”  “But remember what a magnificent salary you will get,” said Chester, with a smile.  “It ain’t half enough. Say, Chester, old Tripp is rich, ain’t he?”  “I should call myself rich if I had his money.”  “He’s a miserly old hunks, then, to give me such small pay.”  “Don’t let him hear you say so.”  “I’ll take care of that. Come, you’ll help me, won’t you?”  “Yes,” answered Chester, good-naturedly; “I might as well, as I have nothing else to do.”  Between the two the basket was easily carried. In a short time they had reached the minister’s house. They took the basket around to the side door, just as Mr. Morris, the minister, came out, accompanied by a young man, who was evidently a stranger in the village, as Chester did not remember having seen him before.  “Chester,” said the minister, kindly, “how does it happen that you have an assistant to-day?”  “I am the assistant, Mr. Morris. Abel is Mr. Tripp’s new boy.”  “Indeed, I am surprised to hear that. When did you leave the store?”  “Last Saturday night.”  “Have you another place?”  “Not yet.”  “Are you at leisure this afternoon?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Then perhaps you will walk around with my friend, Mr. Conrad, and show him the village. I was going with him, but I have some writing to do, and you will do just as well.”  “I shall be very happy to go with Mr. Conrad,” said Chester, politely.  “And I shall be very glad to have you,” said the young man, with a pleasant smile.  “Come back to supper, Chester,” said the minister; “that is, if your mother can spare you.”  “Thank you, sir. I suppose you will be able to carry back the empty basket, Abel,” added Chester, as his successor emerged from the side door, relieved of his burden.  “I guess so,” answered Abel, with a grin.  “I was never in Wyncombe before,” began Mr. Conrad, “though I am a second cousin of your minister, Mr. Morris. I have to go away to-morrow morning, and wish to see a little of the town while I am here.”  “Where do you live, Mr. Conrad?”  “In the city of New York.”  “Are you a minister, too?”  “Oh, no!” laughed the young man. “I am in a very different business. I am an artist—in a small way. I make sketches for books and magazines.”  “And does that pay?”  “Fairly well. I earn a comfortable living.”  “I didn’t know one could get money for making pictures. I like to draw, myself.”  “I will see what you can do this evening; that is, if you accept my cousin’s invitation.”  Before the walk was over Chester had become much interested in his new friend. He listened eagerly to his stories of the great city, and felt that life must be much better worth living there than in Wyncombe.     CHAPTER III.  A NOTEWORTHY EVENING.   Chester enjoyed his supper. Mr. Morris, though a minister, had none of the starched dignity that many of his profession think it necessary to assume. He was kindly and genial, with a pleasant humor that made him agreeable company for the young as well as the old. Mr. Conrad spoke much of New York and his experiences there, and Chester listened to him eagerly.  “You have never been to New York, Chester?” said the young artist.  “No, sir, but I have read about it—and dreamed about it. Sometime I hope to go there.”  “I think that is the dream of every country boy. Well, it is the country boys that make the most successful men.”  “How do you account for that, Herbert?” asked the minister.  “Generally they have been brought up to work, and work more earnestly than the city boys.”  When the supper table was cleared, Mr. Conrad took from his valise two or three of the latest issues of _Puck_, _Judge_ and _Life_. He handed them to Chester, who looked over them eagerly.  “Do you ever contribute to these papers, Mr. Conrad?” he asked.  “Yes; here is a sketch in _Judge_, and another in _Life_, which I furnished.”  “And do you get good pay for them?”  “I received ten dollars for each.”  Chester’s eyes opened with surprise.  “Why,” he said, “they are small. It couldn’t have taken you long to draw them.” "]]]
