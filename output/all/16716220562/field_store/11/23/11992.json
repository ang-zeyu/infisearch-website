She stands out among the rough, coarse, self-seeking men and women somewhat as Sophy Western does among the personages of \"Tom Jones.\"  Her tender inclination towards Lord Hervey makes her seem all the more sweet and womanly; her influence over him is always apparent. He never speaks of her without seeming to become at once more manly and gentle, strong and sweet.  Of the other princesses, Emily had perhaps the most marked character, but there would appear to have been little in her to admire.  Hervey says of her that she had the least sense of all the family, except, indeed, her brother Frederick; and we shall soon come to appreciate the significance of this comparison.  {39}  Frederick, the eldest son, like George the Second himself, had not been allowed to come to England in his early days.  The young prince was in his twenty-second year when, on the accession of his father to the throne, he was brought over to this country and created Prince of Wales.  At that time he was well spoken of generally, although even then it was known to every one that he was already addicted to some of the vices of his father and his grandfather.  The Court of Hanover was not a good school for the training of young princes.  The sovereign of Hanover was a positive despot, both politically and socially. Everything had to be done to please him, to amuse him, to conciliate him.  The women around the Court were always vying with each other to see who should most successfully flatter the King, or, in the King's absence, the Royal Prince.  It was intellectually a very stupid Court. Its pleasures were vulgar, its revels coarse, its whole atmosphere heavy and sensuous.  Frederick was said, however, to have given some evidence of a more cultivated taste than might have been expected of a Hanoverian Crown Prince.  He was said to have some appreciation of letters and music.  When he settled in London he very soon began to follow the example of his father and his grandfather; he threw his handkerchief to this lady and to that, and the handkerchief was in certain cases very thankfully taken up.  Some people said that he entered on this way of life not so much because he really had a strong predilection for it as because he thought it would be unbecoming of the position of a Prince of Wales not to have an adequate number of women favorites about him; so he maintained what seemed to him the dignity of his place in society and in the State.  The prince's character at his first coming over, says Hervey in his pleasantest vein, though little more respectable, seemed much more amiable than, upon his opening himself further and being better known, it turned out to be; for, though there appeared nothing in him to be {40} admired, yet there seemed nothing in him to be hated--neither anything great nor anything vicious; his behavior was something that gained one's good wishes though it gave one no esteem for him.  If his best qualities prepossessed people in his favor, yet they always provoked contempt for him at the same time; for, though his manners were stamped with a good deal of natural or habitual civility, yet his habit of cajoling everybody, and almost in an equal degree, made what might have been thought favors, if more sparingly bestowed, lose all their weight.  \"He carried this affectation of general benevolence so far that he often condescended below the character of a prince; and, as people attributed this familiarity to popular and not particular motives, so it only lessened their respect without increasing their good-will, and, instead of giving them good impressions of his humanity, only gave them ill ones of his sincerity.  He was indeed as false as his capacity would allow him to be, and was more capable in that walk than in any other, never having the least hesitation, from principle or fear of future detection, of telling any lie that served his present purpose.  He had a much weaker understanding and, if possible, a more obstinate temper than his father; that is, more tenacious of opinions he had once formed, though less capable of ever forming right ones.  Had he had one grain of merit at the bottom of his heart, one should have had compassion for him in the situation to which his miserable poor head soon reduced him, for his case in short was this: he had a father that abhorred him, a mother that despised him, sisters that betrayed him, a brother set up against him, and a set of servants that neglected him, and were neither of use nor capable of being of use to him, nor desirous of being so.\"  [Sidenote: 1736--Resolved on a marriage]  The King's eldest daughter, Anne, was married soon after Frederick's coming to England.  Up to the age of twenty-four she had remained unmarried, a long time for a princess to continue a spinster.  Many years before, she had had a good chance of marrying Louis the Fifteenth {41} of France.  George was anxious for the marriage; the Duc de Bourbon, then minister to Louis, had originated the idea; Anne was only sixteen years old, and would no doubt have offered no objection.  But the scheme fell through because when it was well on its way somebody suddenly remembered, what every one might have thought of before, that if the English princess became Queen of France she would be expected to conform to the religion of the State.  Political rather than religious considerations made this settle the matter in the English Court. George and Caroline had certainly no prejudices themselves in favor of one form of religion over another, or of any form of religion over none; but, as they held the English Crown by virtue of their at least professing to be Protestants, and as the Pretender would most assuredly have got that Crown if he had even professed to be a Protestant, it did not seem possible that they could countenance a change of Church on the part of their daughter.  Years passed away and no husband was offering himself to Anne.  Now at last she was determined that she would wait no longer.  Suddenly the Prince of Orange was induced to ask her to be his wife.  She had never seen him; he was known to be ugly and deformed; King George was opposed to the proposition, and told his daughter that the prince was the ugliest man in Holland.  Anne was determined not to refuse the offer; she said she would marry him if he were a Dutch baboon.  \"Very well,\" retorted the King, angrily; \"you will find him baboon enough, I can tell you.\"  The princess persevered, however; she was as firmly resolved to get married as Miss Hoyden in Vanbrugh's \"Relapse.\"  The King sent a message to Parliament announcing the approaching marriage of his daughter to the Prince of Orange, and graciously intimating that he expected the House of Commons to help him to give the princess a marriage-portion.  The loyal Commons undertook to find eighty thousand pounds, although George was surely rich enough to have paid his daughter's dowry out {42} of his own pocket.  George, however, had not the remotest notion of doing anything of the kind.  The Bill was run through the House of Commons in a curious sort of way, the vote for the dowry being thrown in with a little bundle of miscellaneous votes, as if the House of Commons were rather anxious to keep it out of public sight, as indeed they probably were.  The bridegroom came to England in November, 1732, and began his career in this country by falling very ill.  It took him months to recover, and it was not until March 24, 1733, that the marriage was celebrated.  It must have been admitted by Anne that her father had not misrepresented the personal appearance of the Prince of Orange.  The Queen shed abundance of tears at the sight of the bridegroom, and yet could not help sometimes bursting into a fit of laughter at his oddity and ugliness.  Anne bore her awkward position with a sort of stolid composure which was almost dignity.  To add to the other unsatisfactory conditions of the marriage, the prophets of evil began to point to the ominous conjuncture of names--an English princess married to a Prince of Orange.  When this happened last, what followed?  The expulsion of the father-in-law by the son-in-law.  Go to, then!  [Sidenote: 1736--Massachusetts Bay retaliates]  On the same day on which the House of Commons voted the grant of the princess's dowry, a memorial from the council and representatives of the colony or province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England, was presented and read from the table.  The memorial set forth that the province was placed under conditions of difficulty and distress owing to a royal instruction given to the governor of the province restraining the emission of its bills of credit and restricting the disposal of its public money.  The memorial, which seems to have been couched in the most proper and becoming language, prayed that the House would allow the agent for the province to be heard at the bar, and that the House, if satisfied of the justice of the request, would use its influence with the King in order that he might be graciously pleased to withdraw {43} the instructions as contrary to the rights of the charter of Massachusetts Bay, and tending in their nature to distress if not to ruin the province.  The House of Commons treated this petition with the most sovereign contempt.  After a very short discussion, if it could even be called a discussion, the House passed a resolution declaring the complaint \"frivolous and groundless, a high insult upon his Majesty's Government, and tending to shake off the dependency of the said colony upon this kingdom, to which by law and right they are and ought to be subject.\"  The petition was therefore rejected.  To the short summary of this piece of business contained in the parliamentary debates the comment is quietly added, \"We shall leave to future ages to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23471"],["title","A History of the Four Georges and of William IV, Volume III (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's note:     Page numbers in this book are indicated by numbers enclosed in    curly braces, e.g. {99}.

CHAPTER XLII.  \"SUPREME IRONIC PROCESSION.\"  For six and forty years England had been ruled by German princes.  One Elector of Hanover named George had been succeeded by another Elector of Hanover named George, and George the First and George the Second, George the father and George the son, resembled each other in being by nature German rather than English, and by inclination Electors of Hanover rather than Kings of England.  Against each of them a Stuart prince had raised a standard and an army.  George the First had his James Francis Edward, who called himself James the Third, and whom his opponents called the Pretender, by a translation which gave an injurious signification to the French word \"pretendant.\"  George the Second had his Charles Edward, the Young Pretender who a generation later led an invading army well into England before he had to turn and fly for his life.  A very different condition of things awaited the successor of George the Second.  George the Second's grandson was an English prince and an Englishman.  He was born in England; his father was born in England; his native tongue was the English tongue; and if he was Elector of Hanover, that seemed an accident.  The title was as unimportant and trivial to the King of {2} England as his title of King of France was unreal and theatrical.  The remnant of the Jacobites could not with truth call the heir to the throne a foreigner, and they could not in reason hope to make such a demonstration in arms against him as they had made against his grandfather and his great-grandfather.  The young King came to a much safer throne under much more favorable auspices than either of the two monarchs, his kinsmen and his namesakes, who had gone before him.  [Sidenote: 1760--Accession of George the Third]  The young King heard the first formal news of his accession to the throne from the lips of no less stately a personage than the Great Commoner himself--the foremost Englishman then alive.  George the Third, as he then actually was, had received at Kew Palace some messages which told him that his grandfather was sinking fast, that he was dying, that he was dead.  George resolved to start for London.  On his way, and not far from Kew, he was met by a coach and six, which, from the blue and silver liveries, he knew to be that of Mr. Pitt. George received the congratulations of his great minister--the great Minister whom, as it was soon to appear, he understood so little and esteemed so poorly.  Then Pitt, turning his horses' heads, followed his sovereign into London.  Never perhaps in English history was a young king welcomed on his accession by so great a minister.  Among the many auspicious conditions which surrounded the early days of George the Third's reign not the least auspicious was the presence of such a bulwark to the throne and to the realm.  For the name of Pitt was now feared and honored in every civilized country in the world.  It had become synonymous with the triumphs and the greatness of England.  Pitt was the greatest War Minister England had yet known.  He was the first English statesman who illustrated in his own person the difference between a War Minister and a Minister of War.  Truly this journey of the King and the Prime Minister from Kew to London was what George Meredith calls a \"supreme ironic procession, with laughter of gods in the background.\"  The ignorant, unwise young King led the {3} way, the greatest living statesman in England followed after.  One can hardly imagine a procession more supremely ironic. Almost all the whole range of human intellect was stretched out and exhausted by the living contrast between the King who went first and the Minister who meekly went second.  Pitt had made for young George the Third a great empire, which it was the work of George the Third not long after to destroy, so far as its destruction could be compassed by the stupidity of a man.  Pitt had made the name of England a power all over the civilized world.  Rome at her greatest, Spain at her greatest, could hardly have surpassed the strength and the fame of England as Pitt had re-made it.  George, from the very first, felt a sort of coldness towards his superb Minister.  He had all the vague pervading jealousy which dulness naturally shows to genius.  It was a displeasure to him from the first that Pitt should have made England so great, because the work was the inspiration of the subject and not of the sovereign.  No one can know for certain what thoughts were filling the mind of George as he rode to London that day in front of William Pitt. But it may fairly be assumed that he was not particularly sorry for the death of his grandfather, and that he was pleasing his spirit with the idea that he would soon emancipate himself from Mr. Pitt.  \"Be a king, George,\" his mother used to say to him.  The unsifted youth was determined, if he could, to be a king.  At the time of his accession George was in his twenty-third year.  He was a decidedly personable young Prince.  He had the large regular features of his race, the warm complexion of good health, and a vigorous constitution, keen attractive eyes, and a firm, full mouth. He was tall and strongly made, and carried himself with a carriage that was dignified or stiff according to the interpretation of those who observed it.  Many of the courtly ladies thought him extremely handsome, were eagerly gracious to him, did their best to thrust themselves upon his attention, and received, it would seem, very little notice in return for their pains.  If George showed himself {4} indifferent and even ungallant to his enthusiastic admirers, his brother Edward was of a different disposition.  But though Edward, like his brother, was an agreeable-looking youth, and keen to win favor in women's eyes, he found himself like Benedict: nobody marked him because he was not the heir to the throne.  In some illustrated histories of the reign two portraits of George the Third are placed in immediate and pathetic contrast.  The one portrait represents George as he showed in the first year of his reign--alert, young, smiling, with short-cut powdered hair, a rich flowered coat, and the star and ribbon of the Garter on his breast.  So might a young king look called in the flower of his age to the control of a great country, pleased, confident, and courageous.  The other picture shows how the King looked in the sixtieth year of his reign.  The face is old and wrinkled and weary; the straggling white locks escape from beneath a fur-trimmed cap; the bowed body is wrapped in a fur-trimmed robe.  The time of two generations of men lay between the young king and the old; the longest reign then known to English history, the longest and the most eventful.  [Sidenote: 1760--George's qualifications for King]  George the Third started with many advantages over his predecessors of the same name.  He was an Englishman.  He spoke the English language. It was his sincere wish to be above all things English.  He honestly loved English ways.  "]]]
