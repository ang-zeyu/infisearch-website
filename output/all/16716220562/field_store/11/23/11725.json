Wasting them that way? The whoreson rogue's gone nuts!_  But really it was plain frightening, all that frantic doubling and tripling with its suggestion that the play (and the company too, Freya forfend) was becoming a ricketty patchwork illusion with everybody racing around faster and faster to hide the holes. And the scenery-wavery stuff and the warped Park-sounds were scary too. I was actually shivering by the time Sid got to: \"Light thickens; and the crow Makes wing to the rooky wood: Good things of day begin to droop and drowse; Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse.\" Those graveyard lines didn't help my nerves any, of course. Nor did thinking I heard Nefer-Elizabeth say from the audience, rather softly for her this time, \"Eyes, I have heard that speech, I know not where. Think you 'tiz stolen?\"  _Greta_, I told myself, _you need a miltown before the crow makes wing through your kooky head._  I turned to go and fetch me one from my closet. And stopped dead.  Just behind me, pacing back and forth like an ash-colored tiger in the gloomy wings, looking daggers at the audience every time she turned at that end of her invisible cage, but ignoring me completely, was Miss Nefer in the Elizabeth wig and rig.  Well, I suppose I should have said to myself, _Greta, you imagined that last loud whisper from the audience. Miss Nefer's simply unkinked herself, waved a hand to the real audience and come back stage. Maybe Sid just had her out there for the first half of the play. Or maybe she just couldn't stand watching Martin give such a bang-up performance in her part of Lady Mack._  Yes, maybe I should have told myself something like that, but somehow all I could think then--and I thought it with a steady mounting shiver--was, _We got two Elizabeths. This one is our witch Nefer. I know. I dressed her. And I know that devil-look from the virginals. But if this is our Elizabeth, the company Elizabeth, the stage Elizabeth ... who's the other?_  And because I didn't dare to let myself think of the answer to that question, I dodged around the invisible cage that the ash-colored skirt seemed to ripple against as the Tiger Queen turned and I ran into the dressing room, my only thought to get behind my New York City Screen.                    V      Even little things are turning out to be great     things and becoming intensely interesting.     Have you ever thought about the properties     of numbers?                       --The Maiden   Lying on my cot, my eyes crosswise to the printing, I looked from a pink Algonquin menu to a pale green New Amsterdam program, with a tiny doll of Father Knickerbocker dangling between them on a yellow thread. Really they weren't covering up much of anything. A ghostly hole an inch and a half across seemed to char itself in the program. As if my eye were right up against it, I saw in vivid memory what I'd seen the two times I'd dared a peek through the hole in the curtain: a bevy of ladies in masks and Nell Gwyn dresses and men in King Charles knee-breeches and long curled hair, and the second time a bunch of people and creatures just wild: all sorts and colors of clothes, humans with hoofs for feet and antennae springing from their foreheads, furry and feathery things that had more arms than two and in one case that many heads--as if they were dressed up in our _Tempest_, _Peer Gynt_ and _Insect People_ costumes and some more besides.  Naturally I'd had mind-wavery fits both times. Afterwards Sid had wagged a finger at me and explained that on those two nights we'd been giving performances for people who'd arranged a costume theater-party and been going to attend a masquerade ball, and 'zounds, when would I learn to guard my half-patched pate?  _I don't know, I guess never_, I answered now, quick looking at a Giants pennant, a Korvette ad, a map of Central Park, my Willie Mays baseball and a Radio City tour ticket. That was eight items I'd looked at this trip without feeling any inward improvement. They weren't reassuring me at all.  The blue fly came slowly buzzing down over my screen and I asked it, \"What are you looking for? A spider?\" when what should I hear coming back through the dressing room straight toward my sleeping closet but Miss Nefer's footsteps. No one else walks that way.  _She's going to do something to you, Greta_, I thought. _She's the maniac in the company. She's the one who terrorized you with the boning knife in the shrubbery, or sicked the giant tarantula on you at the dark end of the subway platform, or whatever it was, and the others are covering up for. She's going to smile the devil-smile and weave those white twig-fingers at you, all eight of them. And Birnam Wood'll come to Dunsinane and you'll be burnt at the stake by men in armor or drawn and quartered by eight-legged monkeys that talk or torn apart by wild centaurs or whirled through the roof to the moon without being dressed for it or sent burrowing into the past to stifle in Iowa 1948 or Egypt 4,008 B.C. The screen won't keep her out._         *       *       *       *       *  Then a head of hair pushed over the screen. But it was black-bound-with-silver, Brahma bless us, and a moment later Martin was giving me one of his rare smiles.  I said, \"Marty, do something for me. Don't ever use Miss Nefer's footsteps again. Her voice, okay, if you have to. But not the footsteps. Don't ask me why, just don't.\"  Martin came around and sat on the foot of my cot. My legs were already doubled up. He straightened out his blue-and-gold skirt and rested a hand on my black sneakers.  [Illustration]  \"Feeling a little wonky, Greta?\" he asked. \"Don't worry about me. Banquo's dead and so's his ghost. We've finished the Banquet Scene. I've got lots of time.\"  I just looked at him, queerly I guess. Then without lifting my head I asked him, \"Martin, tell me the truth. Does the dressing room move around?\"  I was talking so low that he hitched a little closer, not touching me anywhere else though.  \"The Earth's whipping around the sun at 20 miles a second,\" he replied, \"and the dressing room goes with it.\"  I shook my head, my cheek scrubbing the pillow, \"I mean ... shifting,\" I said. \"By itself.\"  \"How?\" he asked.  \"Well,\" I told him, \"I've had this idea--it's just a sort of fancy, remember--that if you wanted to time-travel and, well, do things, you could hardly pick a more practical machine than a dressing room and sort of stage and half-theater attached, with actors to man it. Actors can fit in anywhere. They're used to learning new parts and wearing strange costumes. Heck, they're even used to traveling a lot. And if an actor's a bit strange nobody thinks anything of it--he's almost expected to be foreign, it's an asset to him.\"  \"And a theater, well, a theater can spring up almost anywhere and nobody ask questions, except the zoning authorities and such and they can always be squared. Theaters come and go. It happens all the time. They're transitory. Yet theaters are crossroads, anonymous meeting places, anybody with a few bucks or sometimes nothing at all can go. And theaters attract important people, the sort of people you might want to do something to. Caesar was stabbed in a theater. Lincoln was shot in one. And....\"  My voice trailed off. \"A cute idea,\" he commented.  I reached down to his hand on my shoe and took hold of his middle finger as a baby might.  \"Yeah,\" I said, \"But Martin, is it true?\"  He asked me gravely, \"What do you think?\"  I didn't say anything.  \"How would you like to work in a company like that?\" he asked speculatively.  \"I don't really know,\" I said.         *       *       *       *       *  He sat up straighter and his voice got brisk. \"Well, all fantasy aside, how'd you like to work in this company?\" He asked, lightly slapping my ankle. \"On the stage, I mean. Sid thinks you're ready for some of the smaller parts. In fact, he asked me to put it to you. He thinks you never take him seriously.\"  \"Pardon me while I gasp and glow,\" I said. Then, \"Oh Marty, I can't really imagine myself doing the tiniest part.\"  \"Me neither, eight months ago,\" he said. \"Now, look. Lady Macbeth.\"  \"But Marty,\" I said, reaching for his finger again, \"you haven't answered my question. About whether it's true.\"  \"Oh that!\" he said with a laugh, switching his hand to the other side. \"Ask me something else.\"  \"Okay,\" I said, \"why am I bugged on the number eight? Because I'm permanently behind a private 8-ball?\"  \"Eight's a number with many properties,\" he said, suddenly as intently serious as he usually is. \"The corners of a cube.\"  \"You mean I'm a square?\" I said. \"Or just a brick? You know, 'She's a brick.'\"  \"But eight's most curious property,\" he continued with a frown, \"is that lying on its side it signifies infinity. So eight erect is really--\" and suddenly his made-up, naturally solemn face got a great glow of inspiration and devotion--\"Infinity Arisen!\"  Well, I don't know. You meet quite a few people in the theater who are bats on numerology, they use it to pick stage-names. But I'd never have guessed it of Martin. He always struck me as the skeptical, cynical type.  \"I had another idea about eight,\" I said hesitatingly. \"Spiders. That 8-legged asterisk on Miss Nefer's forehead--\" I suppressed a shudder.  \"You don't like her, do you?\" he stated.  \"I'm afraid of her,\" I said.  \"You shouldn't be. She's a very great woman and tonight she's playing an infinitely more difficult part than I am. No, Greta,\" he went on as I started to protest, \"believe me, you don't understand anything about it at this moment. Just as you don't understand about spiders, fearing them. They're the first to climb the rigging and to climb ashore too. They're the web-weavers, the line-throwers, the connectors, Siva and Kali united in love. They're the double mandala, the beginning and the end, infinity mustered and on the march--\"  \"They"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23162"],["title","No Great Magic (#7)"],["body","'re also on my New York screen!\" I squeaked, shrinking back across the cot a little and pointing at a tiny glinting silver-and-black thing mounting below my Willy-ball.  Martin gently caught its line on his finger and lifted it very close to his face. \"Eight eyes too,\" he told me. Then, \"Poor little god,\" he said and put it back.  \"Marty? Marty?\" Sid's desperate stage-whisper rasped the length of the dressing room.  Martin stood up. \"Yes, Sid?\"  Sid's voice stayed a whisper but went from desperate to ferocious. \"You villainous elf-skin! Know you not the Cauldron Scene's been playing a hundred heartbeats? 'Tis 'most my entrance and we still mustering only two witches out of three! Oh, you nott-pated starveling!\"  Before Sid had got much more than half of that out, Martin had slipped around the screen, raced the length of the dressing room, and I'd heard a lusty thwack as he went out the door. I couldn't help grinning, though with Martin racked by anxieties and reliefs over his first time as Lady Mack, it was easy to understand it slipping his mind that he was still doubling Second Witch.                    VI      I will vault credit       and affect high pleasures     Beyond death.                    --Ferdinand   I sat down where Martin had been, first pushing the screen far enough to the side for me to see the length of the dressing room and notice anyone coming through the door and any blurs moving behind the thin white curtain shutting off the boys' two-thirds.  I'd been going to think. But instead I just sat there, experiencing my body and the room around it, steadying myself or maybe readying myself. I couldn't tell which, but it was nothing to think about, only to feel. My heartbeat became a very faint, slow, solid throb. My spine straightened.  No one came in or went out. Distantly I heard Macbeth and the witches and the apparitions talk.  Once I looked at the New York Screen, but all the stuff there had grown stale. No protection, no nothing.  I reached down to my suitcase and from where I'd been going to get a miltown I took a dexedrine and popped it in my mouth. Then I started out, beginning to shake.  When I got to the end of the curtain I went around it to Sid's dressing table and asked Shakespeare, \"Am I doing the right thing, Pop?\" But he didn't answer me out of his portrait. He just looked sneaky-innocent, like he knew a lot but wouldn't tell, and I found myself think of a little silver-framed photo Sid had used to keep there too of a cocky German-looking young actor with \"Erich\" autographed across it in white ink. At least I supposed he was an actor. He looked a little like Erich von Stroheim, but nicer yet somehow nastier too. The photo had used to upset me, I don't know why. Sid must have noticed it, for one day it was gone.  I thought of the tiny black-and-silver spider crawling across the remembered silver frame, and for some reason it gave me the cold creeps.  Well, this wasn't doing me any good, just making me feel dismal again, so I quickly went out. In the door I had to slip around the actors coming back from the Cauldron Scene and the big bolt nicked my hip.  Outside Maud was peeling off her Third Witch stuff to reveal Lady Macduff beneath. She twitched me a grin.  \"How's it going?\" I asked.  \"Okay, I guess,\" she shrugged. \"What an audience! Noisy as highschool kids.\"  \"How come Sid didn't have a boy do your part?\" I asked.  \"He goofed, I guess. But I've battened down my bosoms and playing Mrs. Macduff as a boy.\"  \"How does a girl do that in a dress?\" I asked.  \"She sits stiff and thinks pants,\" she said, handing me her witch robe. \"'Scuse me now. I got to find my children and go get murdered.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I'd moved a few steps nearer the stage when I felt the gentlest tug at my hip. I looked down and saw that a taut black thread from the bottom of my sweater connected me with the dressing room. It must have snagged on the big bolt and unraveled. I moved my body an inch or so, tugging it delicately to see what it felt like and I got the answers: Theseus's clew, a spider's line, an umbilicus.  I reached down close to my side and snapped it with my fingernails. The black thread leaped away. But the dressing room door didn't vanish, or the wings change, or the world end, and I didn't fall down.  After that I just stood there for quite a while, feeling my new freedom and steadiness, letting my body get used to it. I didn't do any thinking. I hardly bothered to study anything around me, though I did notice that there were more bushes and trees than set pieces, and that the flickery lightning was simply torches and that Queen Elizabeth was in (or back in) the audience. Sometimes letting your body get used to something is all you should do, or maybe can do.  And I did smell horse dung.  When the Lady Macduff Scene was over and the Chicken Scene well begun, I went back to the dressing room. Actors call it the Chicken Scene because Macduff weeps in it about \"all my pretty chickens and their dam,\" meaning his kids and wife, being murdered \"at one fell swoop\" on orders of that chickenyard-raiding \"hell-kite\" Macbeth.  Inside the dressing room I steered down the boys' side. Doc was putting on an improbable-looking dark makeup for Macbeth's last faithful servant Seyton. He didn't seem as boozy-woozy as usual for Fourth Act, but just the same I stopped to help him get into a chain-mail shirt made of thick cord woven and silvered.  In the third chair beyond, Sid was sitting back with his corset loosened and critically surveying Martin, who'd now changed to a white wool nightgown that clung and draped beautifully, but not particularly enticingly, on him and his folded towel, which had slipped a bit.  From beside Sid's mirror, Shakespeare smiled out of his portrait at them like an intelligent big-headed bug.  Martin stood tall, spread his arms rather like a high priest, and intoned, \"_Amici! Romani! Populares!_\"  I nudged Doc. \"What goes on now?\" I whispered.  He turned a bleary eye on them. \"I think they are rehearsing _Julius Caesar_ in Latin.\" He shrugged. \"It begins the oration of Antony.\"  \"But why?\" I asked. Sid does like to put every moment to use when the performance-fire is in people, but this project seemed pretty far afield--hyper-pedantic. Yet at the same time I felt my scalp shivering as if my mind were jumping with speculations just below the surface.  Doc shook his head and shrugged again.  Sid shoved a palm at Martin and roared softly, \"'Sdeath, boy, thou'rt not playing a Roman statua but a Roman! Loosen your knees and try again.\"  Then he saw me. Signing Martin to stop, he called, \"Come hither, sweetling.\" I obeyed quickly. He gave me a fiendish grin and said, \"Thou'st heard our proposal from Martin. What sayest thou, wench?\"         *       *       *       *       *  This time the shiver was in my back. It felt good. I realized I was grinning back at him, and I knew what I'd been getting ready for the last twenty minutes.  \"I'm on,\" I said. \"Count me in the company.\"  Sid jumped up and grabbed me by the shoulders and hair and bussed me on both cheeks. It was a little like being bombed.  \"Prodigious!\" he cried. \"Thou'lt play the Gentlewoman in the Sleepwalking Scene tonight. Martin, her costume! Now sweet wench, mark me well.\" His voice grew grave and old. \"When was it she last walked?\"  The new courage went out of me like water down a chute. \"But Siddy, I can't start _tonight_,\" I protested, half pleading, half outraged.  \"Tonight or never! 'Tis an emergency--we're short-handed.\" Again his voice changed. \"When was it she last walked?\"  \"But Siddy, I don't _know_ the part.\"  \"You must. You've heard the play twenty times this year past. When was it she last walked?\"  Martin was back and yanking down a blonde wig on my head and shoving my arms into a light gray robe.  \"I've never studied _the lines_,\" I squeaked at Sidney.  \"Liar! I've watched your lips move a dozen nights when you watched the scene from the wings. Close your eyes, girl! Martin, unhand her. Close your eyes, girl, empty your mind, and listen, listen only. When was it she last walked?\"  In the blackness I heard myself replying to that cue, first in a whisper, then more loudly, then full-throated but grave, \"Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth--\"  \"Bravissimo!\" Siddy cried and bombed me again. Martin hugged his arm around my shoulders too, then quickly stooped to start hooking up my robe from the bottom.  \"But that's only the first lines, Siddy,\" I protested.  \"They're enough!\"  \"But Siddy, what if I blow up?\" I asked.  \"Keep your mind empty. You won't. Further, I'll be at your side, doubling the Doctor, to prompt you if you pause.\"  _That ought to take care of two of me_, I thought. Then something else struck me. \"But Siddy,\" I quavered, \"how do I play the Gentlewoman as a boy?\"  \"Boy?\" he demanded wonderingly. \"Play her without falling down flat on your face and I'll be past measure happy!\" And he smacked me hard on the fanny.  Martin's fingers were darting at the next to the last hook. I stopped him and shoved my hand down the neck of my sweater and got hold of the subway token and the chain it was on and yanked. It burned my neck but the gold links parted. I started to throw it across the room, but instead I smiled at Siddy and dropped it in his palm.  \"The Sleepwalking Scene!\" Maud hissed insistently to us from the door.                    VII      I know death hath ten thousand several doors     For men to take their exits, and 'tis found     They go on such strange geometrical hinges,     You may open them both ways.                     --The Duchess   There is this about an actor on stage: he can see the audience but he can't _look_ at them, unless he's a narrator or some sort of comic.
