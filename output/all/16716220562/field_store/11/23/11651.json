The representation is, on the whole, so conducted as to leave the reader's sympathies at least half enlisted in favor of the fellow, rough and roistering as he is.  Panurge is the hero of the romance of Pantagruel,--almost more than Pantagruel himself. It would be unpardonable to dismiss Rabelais without first making our readers know Panurge by, at least, a few traits of his character and conduct. Panurge was a shifty but unscrupulous adventurer, whom Pantagruel, pious prince as he was, coming upon him by chance, took and kept under his patronage. Panurge was an arch-imp of mischief,--mischief indulged in the form of obscene and malicious practical jokes. Rabelais describes his accomplishments in a long strain of discourse, from which we purge our selection to follow,--thereby transforming Panurge into a comparatively proper and virtuous person:--       He had threescore and three tricks to come by it [money] at his      need, of which the most honorable and most ordinary was in manner      of thieving, secret purloining, and filching, for he was a wicked,      lewd rogue, a cozener, drinker, roysterer, rover, and a very      dissolute and debauched fellow, if there were any in Paris;      otherwise, and in all matters else, the best and most virtuous man      in the world; and he was still contriving some plot, and devising      mischief against the serjeants and the watch.       At one time he assembled three or four especial good hacksters and      roaring boys; made them in the evening drink like Templars,      afterwards led them till they came under St. Genevieve, or about      the college of Navarre, and, at the hour that the watch was coming      up that way,--which he knew by putting his sword upon the pavement,      and his ear by it, and, when he heard his sword shake, it was an      infallible sign that the watch was near at that instant,--then he      and his companions took a tumbrel or garbage-cart, and gave it the      brangle, hurling it with all their force down the hill, and then      ran away upon the other side; for in less than two days he knew all      the streets, lanes, and turnings in Paris, as well as his _Deus      det._       At another time he laid, in some fair place where the said watch      was to pass, a train of gunpowder, and, at the very instant that      they went along, set fire to it, and then made himself sport to see      what good grace they had in running away, thinking that St.      Anthony's fire had caught them by the legs.... In one of his      pockets he had a great many little horns full of fleas and lice,      which he borrowed from the beggars of St. Innocent, and cast them,      with small canes or quills to write with, into the necks of the      daintiest gentlewomen that he could find, yea, even in the church;      for he never seated himself above in the choir, but always in the      body of the church amongst the women, both at mass, at vespers, and      at sermon.  Coleridge, in his metaphysical way, keen at the moment on the scent of illustrations for the philosophy of Kant, said, \"Pantagruel is the Reason; Panurge the Understanding.\" Rabelais himself, in the fourth book of his romance, written in the last years of his life, defines the spirit of the work. This fourth book, the English translator says, is \"justly thought his masterpiece.\" The same authority adds with enthusiasm, \"Being wrote with more spirit, salt, and flame than the first part.\" Here, then, is Rabelais's own expression, sincere or jocular, as you choose to take it, for what constitutes the essence of his writing. We quote from the \"Prologue\":--       By the means of a little Pantagruelism (which, you know, is _a      certain jollity of mind, pickled in the scorn of fortune_), you see      me now [\"at near seventy years of age,\" his translator says], hale      and cheery, as sound as a bell, and ready to drink, if you will.  It is impossible to exaggerate the mad, rollicking humor, sticking at nothing, either in thought or in expression, with which especially this last book of Rabelais's work is written. But we have no more space for quotation.  Coleridge's theory of interpretation for Rabelais's writings is hinted in his \"Table Talk,\" as follows: \"After any particularly deep thrust,... Rabelais, as if to break the blow, and to appear unconscious of what he has done, writes a chapter or two of pure buffoonery.\"  The truth seems to us to be, that Rabelais's supreme taste, like his supreme power, lay in the line of humorous satire. He hated monkery, and he satirized the system as openly as he dared,--this, however, not so much in the love of truth and freedom, as in pure fondness for exercising his wit. That he was more than willing to make his ribald drollery the fool's mask from behind which he might aim safely his shafts of ridicule at what he despised and hated, is indeed probable. But in this is supplied to him no sufficient excuse for his obscene and blasphemous pleasantry. Nor yet are the manners of the age an excuse sufficient. Erasmus belonged to the same age, and he disliked the monks not less. But what a contrast, in point of decency, between Rabelais and Erasmus!     IV.  MONTAIGNE.  1533-1592.   Montaigne is signally the author of one book. His \"Essays\" are the whole of him. He wrote letters, to be sure, and he wrote journals of travel in quest of health and pleasure. But these are chiefly void of interest. Montaigne the Essayist alone is emphatically the Montaigne that survives. \"Montaigne the Essayist,\"--that has become, as it were, a personal name in literary history.  The \"Essays\" are one hundred and seven in number, divided into three books. They are very unequal in length; and they are on the most various topics,--topics often the most whimsical in character. We give a few of his titles, taking them as found in Cotton's translation:--       That men by various ways arrive at the same end; Whether the      governor of a place ought himself to go out to parley; Of liars; Of      quick or slow speech; A proceeding of some ambassadors; Various      events from the same counsel; Of cannibals; That we laugh and cry      from the same thing; Of smells; That the mind hinders itself; Of      thumbs; Of virtue; Of coaches; Of managing the will; Of cripples;      Of experience.  Montaigne's titles cannot be trusted to indicate the nature of the essays to which they belong. The author's pen will not be bound. It runs on at its own pleasure. Things the most unexpected are incessantly turning up in Montaigne,--things, probably, that were as unexpected to the writer when he was writing, as they will be to the reader when he is reading. The writing, on whatever topic, in whatever vein, always revolves around the writer for its pivot. Montaigne, from no matter what apparent diversion, may constantly be depended upon to bring up in due time at himself. The tether is long and elastic, but it is tenacious, and it is securely tied to Montaigne. This, as we shall presently let the author himself make plain, is no accident, of which Montaigne was unconscious. It is the express idea on which the \"Essays\" were written. Montaigne, in his \"Essays,\" is a pure and perfect egotist, naked, and not ashamed. Egotism is Montaigne's note, his _differentia_, in the world of literature. Other literary men have been egotists--since. But Montaigne may be called the first, and he is the greatest.  Montaigne was a Gascon, and Gasconisms adulterate the purity of his French. But his style--a little archaic now, and never finished to the nail--had virtues of its own which have exercised a wholesome influence on classic French prose. It is simple, direct, manly, genuine. It is fresh and racy of the writer. It is flexible to every turn, it is sensitive to every rise or fall, of the thought. It is a steadfast rebuke to rant and fustian. It quietly laughs to scorn the folly of that style which writhes in an agony of expression, with neither thought nor feeling present to be expressed. Montaigne's \"Essays\" have been a great and a beneficent formative force in the development of prose style in French.  For substance, Montaigne is rich in practical wisdom, his own by original reflection, or by discreet purveyal. He had read much, he had observed much, he had experienced much. The result of all, digested in brooding thought, he put into his \"Essays.\" These grew as he grew. He got himself transferred whole into them. Out of them, in turn, the world has been busy ever since dissolving Montaigne.  Montaigne's \"Essays\" are, as we have said, himself. Such is his own way of putting the fact. To one admiring his essays to him, he frankly replied, \"You will like me, if you like my essays, for they are myself.\" The originality, the creative character and force, of the \"Essays,\" lies in this autobiographical quality in them. Their fascination, too, consists in the self-revelation they contain. This was, first, self-revelation on the part of the writer; but no less it becomes, in each case, self-revelation in the experience of the reader. For, as face answereth to face in the glass, so doth the heart of man to man,--from race to race, and from generation to generation. If Montaigne, in his \"Essays,\" held the mirror up to himself, he, in the same act, held up the mirror to you and to me. The image that we, reading, call Montaigne, is really ourselves. We never tire of gazing on it. We are all of us Narcissuses. This is why Montaigne is an immortal and a universal writer.  Here is Montaigne's Preface to his \"Essays;\" \"The Author to the Reader,\" it is entitled:--       Reader, thou hast here an honest book; it doth at the outset      forewarn thee that, in contriving the same, I have proposed to      myself no other than a domestic and private end: I have had no      consideration at all either to thy service or to my glory. My      powers are not capable of any such design."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],["title","Classic French Course in English (#8)"],["body"," I have dedicated it to      the particular commodity of my kinsfolk and friends, so that,      having lost me (which they must do shortly), they may therein      recover some traits of my conditions and humors, and by that means      preserve more whole, and more life-like, the knowledge they had of      me. Had my intention been to seek the world's favor, I should      surely have adorned myself with borrowed beauties. I desire therein      to be viewed as I appear in mine own genuine, simple, and ordinary      manner, without study and artifice; for it is myself I paint. My      defects are therein to be read to the life, and my imperfections      and my natural form, so far as public reverence hath permitted me.      If I had lived among those nations which (they say) yet dwell under      the sweet liberty of nature's primitive laws, I assure thee I would      most willingly have painted myself quite fully, and quite naked.      Thus, reader, myself am the matter of my book. There's no reason      thou shouldst employ thy leisure about so frivolous and vain a      subject. Therefore, farewell.       From Montaigne, the 12th of June, 1580.  Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, our author, as the foregoing date will have suggested, derived his most familiar name from the place at which he was born and at which he lived. Readers are not to take too literally Montaigne's notice of his dispensing with \"borrowed beauties.\" He was, in fact, a famous borrower. He himself warns his readers to be careful how they criticise him; they may be flouting unawares Seneca, Plutarch, or some other, equally redoubtable, of the reverend ancients. Montaigne is perhaps as signal an example as any in literature, of the man of genius exercising his prescriptive right to help himself to his own wherever he may happen to find it. But Montaigne has in turn been freely borrowed from. Bacon borrowed from him, Shakspeare borrowed from him, Dryden, Pope, Hume, Burke, Byron,--these, with many more, in England; and, in France, Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Voltaire, Rousseau,--directly or indirectly, almost every writer since his day. No modern writer, perhaps, has gone in solution into subsequent literature more widely than Montaigne. But no writer remains more solidly and insolubly entire.  We go at once to chapter twenty-five of the first book of the \"Essays,\" entitled, in the English translation, \"Of the education of children.\" The translation we use henceforth throughout is the classic one of Charles Cotton, in a text of it edited by Mr. William Carew Hazlitt. The \"preface,\" already given, Cotton omitted to translate. We have allowed Mr. Hazlitt to supply the deficiency. Montaigne addresses his educational views to a countess. Several others of his essays are similarly inscribed to women. Mr. Emerson's excuse of Montaigne for his coarseness,--that he wrote for a generation in which women were not expected to be readers,--is thus seen to be curiously impertinent to the actual case that existed. Of a far worse fault in Montaigne than his coarseness,--we mean his outright immorality,--Mr. Emerson makes no mention, and for it, therefore, provides no excuse. We shall ourselves, in due time, deal more openly with our readers on this point.  It was for a \"boy of quality\" that Montaigne aimed to adapt his suggestions on the subject of education. In this happy country of ours, all boys are boys of quality; and we shall go nowhere amiss in selecting from the present essay:--       For a boy of quality, then, I say, I would also have his friends      solicitous to find him out a tutor who has rather a well-made than      a well-filled head, seeking, indeed, both the one and the other,      but rather of the two to prefer manners and judgment to mere      learning, and that this man should exercise his charge after a new      method.       'Tis the custom of pedagogues to be eternally thundering in their      pupil's ears, as they were pouring into a funnel, whilst the      business of the pupil is only to repeat what the others have said:      now, I would have a tutor to correct this error, and that, at the      very first, he should, according to the capacity he has to deal      with, put it to the test, permitting his pupil himself to taste      things, and of himself to discern and choose them, sometimes      opening the way to him, and sometimes leaving him to open it for      himself; that is, I would not have him alone to invent and speak,      but that he should also hear his pupil speak in turn.... Let him      make him put what he has learned into a hundred several forms, and      accommodate it to so many several subjects, to see if he yet      rightly comprehends it, and has made it his own.... 'Tis a sign of      crudity and indigestion to disgorge what we eat in the same      condition it was swallowed: the stomach has not performed its      office, unless it have altered the form and condition of what was      committed to it to concoct....       Let him make him examine and thoroughly sift every thing he reads,      and lodge nothing in his fancy upon simple authority and upon      trust. Aristotle's principles will then be no more principles to      him than those of Epicurus and the Stoics: let this diversity of      opinions be propounded to, and laid before, him; he will himself      choose, if he be able; if not, he will remain in doubt.       \"Che, non men che saper, dubbiar m'aggrata.\" DANTE, _Inferno_, xl.      93.       [\"That doubting pleases me, not less than knowing.\" LONGFELLOW'S      _Translation_.]       For, if he embrace the opinions of Xenophon and Plato, by his own      reason, they will no more be theirs, but become his own. Who      follows another, follows nothing, finds nothing, nay, is      inquisitive after nothing. \"Non sumus sub rege; sibi quisque se      vindicet.\" [\"We are under no king; let each look to      himself.\"--SENECA, _Ep._ 33.] Let him, at least, know that he      knows. It will be necessary that he imbibe their knowledge, not      that he be corrupted with their precepts; and no matter if he      forget where he had his learning, provided he know how to apply it      to his own use. Truth and reason are common to every one, and are      no more his who spake them first, than his who speaks them after;      'tis no more according to Plato, than according to me, since both      he and I equally see and understand them. Bees cull their several      sweets from this flower and that blossom, here and there where they      find them; but themselves afterward make the honey, which is all      and purely their own, and no more thyme and marjoram: so the      several fragments he borrows from others he will transform and      shuffle together, to compile a work that shall be absolutely his      own; that is to say, his judgment: his instruction, labor, and      study tend to nothing else but to form that.... Conversation with      men is of very great use, and travel into foreign countries;... to      be able chiefly to give an account of the humors, manners, customs,      and laws of those nations where he has been, and that we may whet      and sharpen our wits by rubbing them against those of others....       In this conversing with men, I mean also, and principally, those      who live only in the records of history: he shall, by reading those      books, converse with the great and heroic souls of the best ages.  It is difficult to find a stopping-place in discourse so wise and so sweet. We come upon sentences like Plato for height and for beauty. An example: \"The most manifest sign of wisdom is a continual cheerfulness; her state is like that of things in the regions above the moon, always clear and serene.\" But the genius of Montaigne does not often soar, though even one little flight like that shows that it has wings. Montaigne's garnishes of quotation from foreign tongues are often a cold-blooded device of afterthought with him. His first edition was without them, in many places where subsequently they appear. Readers familiar with Emerson will be reminded of him in perusing Montaigne. Emerson himself said, \"It seemed to me [in reading the \"Essays\" of Montaigne] as if I had myself written the book in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my thoughts and experience.\" The rich old English of Cotton's translation had evidently a strong influence on Emerson, to mould his own style of expression. Emerson's trick of writing \"'tis,\" was apparently caught from Cotton. The following sentence, from the present essay of Montaigne, might very well have served Mr. Emerson for his own rule of writing: \"Let it go before, or come after, a good sentence, or a thing well said, is always in season; if it neither suit well with what went before, nor has much coherence with what follows after, it is good in itself.\" Montaigne, at any rate, wrote his \"Essays\" on that easy principle. The logic of them is the logic of mere chance association in thought. But, with Montaigne,--whatever is true of Emerson,--the association at least is not occult; and it is such as pleases the reader, not less than it pleased the writer. So this Gascon gentleman of the olden time never tires us, and never loses us out of his hand. We go with him cheerfully where he so blithely leads.  Montaigne tells us how he was himself trained under his father. The elder Montaigne, too, had his ideas on education,--the subject which his son, in this essay, so instructively treats. The essayist leads up to his autobiographical episode by an allusion to the value of the classical languages, and to the question of method in studying them. He says:--       In my infancy, and before I began to speak, he [my father]      committed me to the care of a German,... totally ignorant of our      language, but very fluent, and a great critic, in Latin. This man,      whom he had fetched out of his own country, and whom he entertained      with a very great salary,"]]]
