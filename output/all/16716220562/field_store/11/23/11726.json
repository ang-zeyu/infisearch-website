Sid was in a dark gray robe looking like some dismal kind of monk, his head so hooded for the Doctor that you couldn't see his face at all.  My skull was pulse-buzzing. My throat was squeezed dry. My heart was pounding. Below that my body was empty, squirmy, electricity-stung, yet with the feeling of wearing ice cold iron pants.  I heard as if from two million miles, \"When was it she last walked?\" and then an iron bell somewhere tolling the reply--I guess it had to be my voice coming up through my body from my iron pants: \"Since his majesty went into the field--\" and so on, until Martin had come on stage, stary-eyed, a white scarf tossed over the back of his long black wig and a flaring candle two inches thick gripped in his right hand and dripping wax on his wrist, and started to do Lady Mack's sleepwalking half-hinted confessions of the murders of Duncan and Banquo and Lady Macduff.  So here is what I saw then without looking, like a vivid scene that floats out in front of your mind in a reverie, hovering against a background of dark blur, and sort of flashes on and off as you think, or in my case act. All the time, remember, with Sid's hand hard on my wrist and me now and then tolling Shakespearan language out of some lightless storehouse of memory I'd never known was there to belong to me.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a medium-size glade in a forest. Through the half-naked black branches shone a dark cold sky, like ashes of silver, early evening.  The glade had two horns, as it were, narrowing back to either side and going off through the forest. A chilly breeze was blowing out of them, almost enough to put out the candle. Its flame rippled.  Rather far back in the horn to my left, but not very far, were clumped two dozen or so men in dark cloaks they huddled around themselves. They wore brimmed tallish hats and pale stuff showing at their necks. Somehow I assumed that these men must be the \"rude fellows from the City\" I remembered Beau mentioning a million or so years ago. Although I couldn't see them very well, and didn't spend much time on them, there was one of them who had his hat off or excitedly pushed way back, showing a big pale forehead. Although that was all the conscious impression I had of his face, he seemed frighteningly familiar.  In the horn to my right, which was wider, were lined up about a dozen horses, with grooms holding tight every two of them, but throwing their heads back now and then as they strained against the reins, and stamping their front hooves restlessly. Oh, they frightened me, I tell you, that line of two-foot-long glossy-haired faces, writhing back their upper lips from teeth wide as piano keys, every horse of them looking as wild-eyed and evil as Fuseli's steed sticking its head through the drapes in his picture \"The Nightmare.\"  To the center the trees came close to the stage. Just in front of them was Queen Elizabeth sitting on the chair on the spread carpet, just as I'd seen her out there before; only now I could see that the braziers were glowing and redly high-lighting her pale cheeks and dark red hair and the silver in her dress and cloak. She was looking at Martin--Lady Mack--most intently, her mouth grimaced tight, twisting her fingers together.  Standing rather close around her were a half dozen men with fancier hats and ruffs and wide-flaring riding gauntlets.  Then, through the trees and tall leafless bushes just behind Elizabeth, I saw an identical Elizabeth-face floating, only this one was smiling a demonic smile. The eyes were open very wide. Now and then the pupils darted rapid glances from side to side.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a sharp pain in my left wrist and Sid whisper-snarling at me, \"Accustomed action!\" out of the corner of his shadowed mouth.  I tolled on obediently, \"It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands: I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.\"  Martin had set down the candle, which still flared and guttered, on a little high table so firm its thin legs must have been stabbed into the ground. And he was rubbing his hands together slowly, continually, tormentedly, trying to get rid of Duncan's blood which Mrs. Mack knows in her sleep is still there. And all the while as he did it, the agitation of the seated Elizabeth grew, the eyes flicking from side to side, hands writhing.  He got to the lines, \"Here's the smell of blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!\"  As he wrung out those soft, tortured sighs, Elizabeth stood up from her chair and took a step forward. The courtiers moved toward her quickly, but not touching her, and she said loudly, \"Tis the blood of Mary Stuart whereof she speaks--the pails of blood that will gush from her chopped neck. Oh, I cannot endure it!\" And as she said that last, she suddenly turned about and strode back toward the trees, kicking out her ash-colored skirt. One of the courtiers turned with her and stooped toward her closely, whispering something. But although she paused a moment, all she said was, \"Nay, Eyes, stop not the play, but follow me not! Nay, I say leave me, Leicester!\" And she walked into the trees, he looking after her.  Then Sid was kicking my ankle and I was reciting something and Martin was taking up his candle again without looking at it saying with a drugged agitation, \"To bed; to bed; there's knocking at the gate.\"  Elizabeth came walking out of the trees again, her head bowed. She couldn't have been in them ten seconds. Leicester hurried toward her, hand anxiously outstretched.  Martin moved offstage, torturedly yet softly wailing, \"What's done cannot be undone.\"  Just then Elizabeth flicked aside Leicester's hand with playful contempt and looked up and she was smiling the devil-smile. A horse whinnied like a trumpeted snicker.  As Sid and I started our last few lines together I intoned mechanically, letting words free-fall from my mind to my tongue. All this time I had been answering Lady Mack in my thoughts, _That's what you think, sister._                    VIII      God cannot effect that anything which is       past should not have been.     It is more impossible than rising the dead.                      --Summa Theologica   The moment I was out of sight of the audience I broke away from Sid and ran to the dressing room. I flopped down on the first chair I saw, my head and arms trailed over its back, and I almost passed out. It wasn't a mind-wavery fit. Just normal faint.  I couldn't have been there long--well, not very long, though the battle-rattle and alarums of the last scene were echoing tinnily from the stage--when Bruce and Beau and Mark (who was playing Malcolm, Martin's usual main part) came in wearing their last-act stage-armor and carrying between them Queen Elizabeth flaccid as a sack. Martin came after them, stripping off his white wool nightgown so fast that buttons flew. I thought automatically, _I'll have to sew those._  They laid her down on three chairs set side by side and hurried out. Unpinning the folded towel, which had fallen around his waist, Martin walked over and looked down at her. He yanked off his wig by a braid and tossed it at me.  I let it hit me and fall on the floor. I was looking at that white queenly face, eyes open and staring sightless at the ceiling, mouth open a little too with a thread of foam trailing from the corner, and at that ice-cream-cone bodice that never stirred. The blue fly came buzzing over my head and circled down toward her face.  \"Martin,\" I said with difficulty, \"I don't think I'm going to like what we're doing.\"  He turned on me, his short hair elfed, his fists planted high on his hips at the edge of his black tights, which now were all his clothes.  \"You knew!\" he said impatiently. \"You knew you were signing up for more than acting when you said, 'Count me in the company.'\"  Like a legged sapphire the blue fly walked across her upper lip and stopped by the thread of foam.  \"But Martin ... changing the past ... dipping back and killing the real queen ... replacing her with a double--\"  His dark brows shot up. \"The real--You think this is the real Queen Elizabeth?\" He grabbed a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the nearest table, gushed some on a towel stained with grease-paint and, holding the dead head by its red hair (no, wig--the real one wore a wig too) scrubbed the forehead.  The white cosmetic came away, showing sallow skin and on it a faint tattoo in the form of an \"S\" styled like a yin-yang symbol left a little open.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Snake!\" he hissed. \"Destroyer! The arch-enemy, the eternal opponent! God knows how many times people like Queen Elizabeth have been dug out of the past, first by Snakes, then by Spiders, and kidnapped or killed and replaced in the course of our war. This is the first big operation I've been on, Greta. But I know that much.\"  My head began to ache. I asked, \"If she's an enemy double, why didn't she know a performance of Macbeth in her lifetime was an anachronism?\"  \"Foxholed in the past, only trying to hold a position, they get dulled. They turn half zombie. Even the Snakes. Even our people. Besides, she almost did catch on, twice when she spoke to Leicester.\"  \"Martin,\" I said dully, \"if there've been all these replacements, first by them, then by us, what's happened to the _real_ Elizabeth?\"  He shrugged. \"God knows.\"  I asked softly, \"But does He, Martin? Can He?\"  He hugged his shoulders in, as if to contain a shudder. \"Look, Greta,\" he said, \"it's the Snakes who are the warpers and destroyers. We're restoring the past. The Spiders are trying to keep things as first created. We only kill when we must.\"  _I_ shuddered then, for bursting out of my memory came the glittering, knife-fl"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23164"],["title","The Creature from Cleveland Depths (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy December     1962.

I enjoy visiting you and Daisy, but I can't stay aboveground all night.\"  \"If being outside the shelters makes you nervous, don't come around any more,\" Gusterson told him, continuing to stalk. \"Why doesn't your invention team think of something to invent? Why don't you? Hah!\" In the \"Hah!\" lay triumphant condemnation of a whole way of life.  \"We do,\" Fay responded imperturbably, \"but a fresh viewpoint sometimes helps.\"  \"I'll say it does! Fay, you burglar, I'll bet you've got twenty people like myself you milk for free ideas. First you irritate their bark and then you make the rounds every so often to draw off the latex or the maple gloop.\"  Fay smiled. \"It ought to please you that society still has a use for you outre inner-directed types. It takes something to make a junior executive stay aboveground after dark, when the missiles are on the prowl.\"  \"Society can't have much use for us or it'd pay us something,\" Gusterson sourly asserted, staring blankly at the tankless TV and kicking it lightly as he passed on.  \"No, you're wrong about that, Gussy. Money's not the key goad with you inner-directeds. I got that straight from our Motivations chief.\"  \"Did he tell you what we should use instead to pay the grocer? A deep inner sense of achievement, maybe? Fay, why should I do any free thinking for Micro Systems?\"  \"I'll tell you why, Gussy. Simply because you get a kick out of insulting us with sardonic ideas. If we take one of them seriously, you think we're degrading ourselves, and that pleases you even more. Like making someone laugh at a lousy pun.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gusterson held still in his roaming and grinned. \"That the reason, huh? I suppose my suggestions would have to be something in the line of ultra-subminiaturized computers, where one sinister fine-etched molecule does the work of three big bumbling brain cells?\"  \"Not necessarily. Micro Systems is branching out. Wheel as free as a rogue star. But I'll pass along to Promotion your one molecule-three brain cell sparkler. It's a slight exaggeration, but it's catchy.\"  \"I'll have my kids watch your ads to see if you use it and then I'll sue the whole underworld.\" Gusterson frowned as he resumed his stalking. He stared puzzledly at the antique TV. \"How about inventing a plutonium termite?\" he said suddenly. \"It would get rid of those stockpiles that are worrying you moles to death.\"  Fay grimaced noncommittally and cocked his head.  \"Well, then, how about a beauty mask? How about that, hey? I don't mean one to repair a woman's complexion, but one she'd wear all the time that'd make her look like a 17-year-old sexpot. That'd end _her_ worries.\"  \"Hey, that's for me,\" Daisy called from the kitchen. \"I'll make Gusterson suffer. I'll make him crawl around on his hands and knees begging my immature favors.\"  [Illustration]  \"No, you won't,\" Gusterson called back. \"You having a face like that would scare the kids. Better cancel that one, Fay. Half the adult race looking like Vina Vidarsson is too awful a thought.\"  \"Yah, you're just scared of making a million dollars,\" Daisy jeered.  \"I sure am,\" Gusterson said solemnly, scanning the fuzzy floor from one murky glass wall to the other, hesitating at the TV. \"How about something homey now, like a flock of little prickly cylinders that roll around the floor collecting lint and flub? They'd work by electricity, or at a pinch cats could bat 'em around. Every so often they'd be automatically herded together and the lint cleaned off the bristles.\"  \"No good,\" Fay said. \"There's no lint underground and cats are _verboten_. And the aboveground market doesn't amount to more moneywise than the state of Southern Illinois. Keep it grander, Gussy, and more impractical--you can't sell people merely useful ideas.\" From his hassock in the center of the room he looked uneasily around. \"Say, did that violet tone in the glass come from the high Cleveland hydrogen bomb or is it just age and ultraviolet, like desert glass?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"No, somebody's grandfather liked it that color,\" Gusterson informed him with happy bitterness. \"I like it too--the glass, I mean, not the tint. People who live in glass houses can see the stars--especially when there's a window-washing streak in their germ-plasm.\"  \"Gussy, why don't you move underground?\" Fay asked, his voice taking on a missionary note. \"It's a lot easier living in one room, believe me. You don't have to tramp from room to room hunting things.\"  \"I like the exercise,\" Gusterson said stoutly.  \"But I bet Daisy'd prefer it underground. And your kids wouldn't have to explain why their father lives like a Red Indian. Not to mention the safety factor and insurance savings and a crypt church within easy slidewalk distance. Incidentally, we see the stars all the time, better than you do--by repeater.\"  \"Stars by repeater,\" Gusterson murmured to the ceiling, pausing for God to comment. Then, \"No, Fay, even if I could afford it--and stand it--I'm such a bad-luck Harry that just when I got us all safely stowed at the N minus 1 sublevel, the Soviets would discover an earthquake bomb that struck from below, and I'd have to follow everybody back to the treetops. _Hey! How about bubble homes in orbit around earth?_ Micro Systems could subdivide the world's most spacious suburb and all you moles could go ellipsing. Space is as safe as there is: no air, no shock waves. Free fall's the ultimate in restfulness--great health benefits. Commute by rocket--or better yet stay home and do all your business by TV-telephone, or by waldo if it were that sort of thing. Even pet your girl by remote control--she in her bubble, you in yours, whizzing through vacuum. Oh, damn-damn-_damn_-_damn_-DAMN!\"  He was glaring at the blank screen of the TV, his big hands clenching and unclenching.  \"Don't let Fay give you apoplexy--he's not worth it,\" Daisy said, sticking her trim head in from the kitchen, while Fay inquired anxiously, \"Gussy, what's the matter?\"  \"Nothing, you worm!\" Gusterson roared, \"Except that an hour ago I forgot to tune in on the only TV program I've wanted to hear this year--_Finnegans Wake_ scored for English, Gaelic and brogue. Oh, damn-_damn_-DAMN!\"  \"Too bad,\" Fay said lightly. \"I didn't know they were releasing it on flat TV too.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well, they were! Some things are too damn big to keep completely underground. And I had to forget! I'm always doing it--I miss everything! Look here, you rat,\" he blatted suddenly at Fay, shaking his finger under the latter's chin, \"I'll tell you what you can have that ignorant team of yours invent. They can fix me up a mechanical secretary that I can feed orders into and that'll remind me when the exact moment comes to listen to TV or phone somebody or mail in a story or write a letter or pick up a magazine or look at an eclipse or a new orbiting station or fetch the kids from school or buy Daisy a bunch of flowers or whatever it is. It's got to be something that's always with me, not something I have to go and consult or that I can get sick of and put down somewhere. And it's got to remind me forcibly enough so that I take notice and don't just shrug it aside, like I sometimes do even when Daisy reminds me of things. That's what your stupid team can invent for me! If they do a good job, I'll pay 'em as much as fifty dollars!\"  \"That doesn't sound like anything so very original to me,\" Fay commented coolly, leaning back from the wagging finger. \"I think all senior executives have something of that sort. At least, their secretary keeps some kind of file....\"  \"I'm not looking for something with spiked falsies and nylons up to the neck,\" interjected Gusterson, whose ideas about secretaries were a trifle lurid. \"I just want a mech reminder--that's all!\"  \"Well, I'll keep the idea in mind,\" Fay assured him, \"along with the bubble homes and beauty masks. If we ever develop anything along those lines, I'll let you know. If it's a beauty mask, I'll bring Daisy a pilot model--to use to scare strange kids.\" He put his watch to his ear. \"Good lord, I'm going to have to cut to make it underground before the main doors close. Just ten minutes to Second Curfew! 'By, Gus. 'By, Daze.\"  Two minutes later, living room lights out, they watched Fay's foreshortened antlike figure scurrying across the balding ill-lit park toward the nearest escalator.  Gusterson said, \"Weird to think of that big bright space-poor glamor basement stretching around everywhere underneath. Did you remind Smitty to put a new bulb in the elevator?\"  \"The Smiths moved out this morning,\" Daisy said tonelessly. \"They went underneath.\"  \"Like cockroaches,\" Gusterson said. \"Cockroaches leavin' a sinkin' apartment building. Next the ghosts'll be retreatin' to the shelters.\"  \"Anyhow, from now on we're our own janitors,\" Daisy said.  He nodded. \"Just leaves three families besides us loyal to this glass death trap. Not countin' ghosts.\" He sighed. Then, \"You like to move below, Daisy?\" he asked softly, putting his arm lightly across her shoulders. \"Get a woozy eyeful of the bright lights and all for a change? Be a rat for a while? Maybe we're getting too old to be bats. I could scrounge me a company job and have a thinking closet all to myself and two secretaries with stainless steel breasts. Life'd be easier for you and a lot cleaner. And you'd sleep safer.\"  \"That's true,\" she answered and paused. She "]]]
