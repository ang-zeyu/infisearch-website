The day I got to the office only five minutes late, he called me in for some anxious questioning as to my health. I couldn't tell him anything, of course. How could I explain that I'd been late once too often, and had fallen in love with a girl two weeks after she was dead?  The thought drove me nearly crazy. Joanna! Joanna with her silvery eyes now lay somewhere at the bottom of the Atlantic. I went around half dazed, scarcely speaking. One night I actually lacked the energy to go home and sat smoking in my father's big overstuffed chair in his private office until I finally dozed off. The next morning, when old N. J. entered and found me there before him, he turned pale as paper, staggered, and gasped, \"My heart!\" It took a lot of explaining to convince him that I wasn't early at the office but just very late going home.  At last I felt that I couldn't stand it. I had to do something--anything at all. I thought finally of the subjunctivisor. I could see--yes, I could see what would have transpired if the ship hadn't been wrecked! I could trace out that weird, unreal romance hidden somewhere in the worlds of \"if\". I could, perhaps, wring a somber, vicarious joy from the things that might have been. I could see Joanna once more!  It was late afternoon when I rushed over to van Manderpootz's quarters. He wasn't there; I encountered him finally in the hall of the Physics Building.  \"Dick!\" he exclaimed. \"Are you sick?\"  \"Sick? No. Not physically. Professor. I've got to use your subjunctivisor again. I've _got_ to!\"  \"Eh? Oh--that toy. You're too late, Dick. I've dismantled it. I have a better use for the space.\"  I gave a miserable groan and was tempted to damn the autobiography of the great van Manderpootz. A gleam of sympathy showed in his eyes, and he took my arm, dragging me into the little office adjoining his laboratory.  \"Tell me,\" he commanded.  I did. I guess I made the tragedy plain enough, for his heavy brows knit in a frown of pity. \"Not even van Manderpootz can bring back the dead,\" he murmured. \"I'm sorry, Dick. Take your mind from the affair. Even were my subjunctivisor available, I wouldn't permit you to use it. That would be but to turn the knife in the wound.\" He paused. \"Find something else to occupy your mind. Do as van Manderpootz does. Find forgetfulness in work.\"  \"Yes,\" I responded dully. \"But who'd want to read my autobiography? That's all right for you.\"  \"Autobiography? Oh! I remember. No, I have abandoned that. History itself will record the life and works of van Manderpootz. Now I am engaged in a far grander project.\"  \"Indeed?\" I was utterly, gloomily disinterested.  \"Yes. Gogli has been here, Gogli the sculptor. He is to make a bust of me. What better legacy can I leave to the world than a bust of van Manderpootz, sculptured from life? Perhaps I shall present it to the city, perhaps to the university. I would have given it to the Royal Society if they had been a little more receptive, if they--if--_if_!\" The last in a shout.  \"Huh?\"  \"_If!_\" cried van Manderpootz. \"What you saw in the subjunctivisor was what would have happened _if_ you had caught the ship!\"  \"I know that.\"  \"But something quite different might really have happened! Don't you see? She--she-- Where are those old newspapers?\"  He was pawing through a pile of them. He flourished one finally. \"Here! Here are the survivors!\"  Like letters of flame, Joanna Caldwell's name leaped out at me. There was even a little paragraph about it, as I saw once my reeling brain permitted me to read:      \"At least a score of survivors owe their lives to the bravery of     twenty-eight-year-old Navigator Orris Hope, who patrolled both     aisles during the panic, lacing life-belts on the injured and     helpless, and carrying many to the port. He remained on the sinking     liner until the last, finally fighting his way to the surface     through the broken walls of the observation room. Among those who     owe their lives to the young officer are: Patrick Owensby, New York     City; Mrs. Campbell Warren, Boston; Miss Joanna Caldwell, New York     City--\"  I suppose my shout of joy was heard over in the Administration Building, blocks away. I didn't care; if van Manderpootz hadn't been armored in stubby whiskers, I'd have kissed him. Perhaps I did anyway; I can't be sure of my actions during those chaotic minutes in the professor's tiny office.  At last I calmed. \"I can look her up!\" I gloated. \"She must have landed with the other survivors, and they were all on that British tramp freighter the _Osgood_, that docked here last week. She must be in New York--and if she's gone over to Paris, I'll find out and follow her!\"  Well, it's a queer ending. She was in New York, but--you see, Dixon Wells had, so to speak, known Joanna Caldwell by means of the professor's subjunctivisor, but Joanna had never known Dixon Wells. What the ending might have been if--_if_-- But it wasn't; she had married Orris Hope, the young officer who had rescued her. I was late again."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22892"],["title","The Best Made Plans (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Illustrated by van Dongen]     THE BEST MADE PLANS    By  EVERETT B.

Don Michaels twisted about uneasily for a moment, then looked toward the doors of the darkened auditorium. He shook his head, then returned his attention to the stage. Of course, he'd joined in the applause--a guy felt sort of idiotic, just sitting there while everyone else in the place made loud noises--but that comedy act had been pretty smelly. They should have groaned instead of applauding.  Oh, sure, he thought, the drama students had to have experience on the stage. And they really needed an audience--if they were going to have any realism in their performances. Sure, that part of it was all right, but why did the professionals have to join the party? Why did they have to have 'casts like that last thing--especially at a school Aud Call? It seemed anything but educational, and he'd had to skip a good class for this one. He shrugged. Of course, everyone else had skipped one class or another, he knew. So why should he be an exception? Too, some of the students would welcome and applaud anything that gave them a break from their studies. And the schedule probably took account of this sort of thing anyway. But....  A fanfare interrupted his thoughts. From the backstage speakers came the smooth rhythm of a band playing a march trio. He sat back.  The screen glowed and became a large rectangle of blue, dotted with fleecy clouds. In the distance, the towers of Oreladar poked up from a carpet of green trees.  Swiftly, the camera approached the city, to center for a moment on a large sports stadium. Players dashed across the turf, then the camera swung away. Briefly, it paused to record various city scenes, then it crossed the walls of the Palace and came to ground level on the parade grounds of the Royal Guards.  A review was underway. For a few seconds, the camera held on the massed troops, then it centered on the reviewing stand. The band modulated smoothly into a brilliant quickstep and a column of guards marched to center screen, the colors of their dress uniforms contrasting with the green of the perfectly kept field.  Now, the field of view narrowed, centering the view first on the color guard, then on the colors alone. The camera moved down till the gold and blue of Oredan's royal colors stood out against the blue sky.  The band music faded, to be over-ridden then replaced by a smooth baritone voice.  \"This is your news reporter,\" it said, \"Merle Boyce, bringing you the latest happenings of the day.\"  The colors receded, their background blurring then coming into focus again. Now, they stood before a large window. Again, the camera receded and a man appeared in the foreground. For a moment he sat at his plain desk, gazing directly out of the screen and seeming to look searchingly into Don's face. Then he smiled engagingly and nodded.  \"As every citizen of Oredan knows,\" he said, \"this nation has been swept by a wave of terrorism during the few days past. Indeed, the now notorious Waern affair became so serious that our Prime Minister found it necessary to take personal command of the Enforcement Corps and direct the search for the terrorists himself. Now, he is present, to bring to you, the people, his report of the conclusion of this terrible affair.\" He paused, drawing a breath.  \"Citizen of Oredan,\" he declaimed slowly, \"the Prime Minister, Daniel Stern, Prince Regent.\"  He faced away from the camera and faded from view. Again, the gold and blue of Oredan filled the screen.  There was a brief blare of trumpets. Then drums rolled and the heavy banner swept aside to reveal a tall, slender man, who approached the camera deliberately. He glanced aside for a moment, then pinned his audience with an intense stare.  \"This has been a terrible experience for many of our people,\" he began. \"And it has been a harrowing time for your public officials. One of our own--a one-time police commissioner--a man sworn to uphold law and order, has suddenly revealed himself as a prime enemy of the realm and of our people. This in itself is a bad thing. But this was not enough for Harle Waern.\" He held out a hand, his face growing stern.  \"No, Waern was unwilling to abide by the results of a lawful trial, knowing the outcome of any full investigation into his activities, he chose to lash out further at authority and to burn his way out of detention. He killed some of his guards. He released other criminals. He formed them into a gang, enlisting their aid in cutting and burning his way across our land in an obvious effort to reach the hills and possibly stir some of the mountain clans to rebellion. And as he went, he left destruction and death.\" He nodded his head sadly.  \"Yes, it is painful to report, but it must be admitted that no less than twenty innocent people have lost their lives as a result of Waern's actions. And many more have been injured or have suffered property loss. It has been a savage affair--one we'll be long in forgetting. And it is with considerable relief that we can report its final conclusion.\" He stepped back, then faded from view.                      *      *      *      *      *  The screen brightened again to show a rambling white house which nestled in a grove of shade trees. Behind it, rose a small hill which acted as a mere step toward the peaks of high mountains beyond. Before it was a broad lawn, dotted with lounging furniture. Reflected in its windows was the glow of the rising sun, which flood-lit the entire scene. From the speakers came muted sounds. An insect chirped. Hurrying footsteps crunched on gravel. There were soft rattles and bangs, and somewhere a motor rumbled briefly, then coughed to silence.  \"We are now,\" said a voice, \"a few miles outside of the city of Riandar, where Harle Waern had this summer estate built for him.\"  As the announcer spoke, the camera moved about to pick out details of the estate. It showed a swimming pool back of the house. It swung briefly about landscaped gardens, scanning across cultivated fields and orchards. It flicked across a winding, tree-lined road, then came back to a rough area before the smooth lawn.  Partially concealed from the house by waving grass and field weeds, men were moving cautiously about the fields. Near a small hummock, a loudspeaker rose from its stand, to face the house. A man lay not too far from the base of the stand. Microphone in hand, he looked intently through the grass, to study the windows of the house. Then he glanced back to note the positions of the others.  The camera's viewpoint raised, to take in the entire scene beyond the field. The sky blurred, then seemed to open, to show Daniel Stern's long, thin face. He cast his eyes down for a moment, seeming to take in the details of the scene, then stared straight at the audience, his deep-set eyes glowing hypnotically.  \"Here then,\" he said slowly, \"is one of the properties which Harle Waern bought while acting as Police Commissioner of Riandar. Here is a mere sample of the gains he enjoyed for a time as the price of his defections from his oath of office. And here is the stage he chose for the final act, his last struggle against the nation he had betrayed.\"  His face faded from view, the deep-set eyes shining from the sky for a time after the rest of the face had faded from view.  Then the camera swung again, to show a low-slung weapons carrier which had pulled up a few dozen meters back of the man with the microphone. About it, the air shimmered a little, as though a filmy screen lay between vehicle and camera. It softened the harsh lines of the carrier and its weapon, lending them an almost mystical appearance.  The crew chief was clearly visible, however. He was making adjustments on one of the instruments on the projector mount. One of the crew members stood by on the charge rack, busying himself with adjustments on the charge activators. None of the crew looked toward the camera.  The loud-speaker clicked and rasped into life.  \"Harle Waern, this is the Enforcement Corps. We know you are in there. You were seen to go into that house with your friends. You have one minute to throw out your weapons and come out with your hands in the air. This is your last chance.\"  There was another click from the loud-speaker. Then the scene was quiet.  Someone cleared his throat. The man with the microphone shifted his position and lay stretched out. He had sought cover behind the hummock near the speaker stand and now he raised his head cautiously, to watch the silent windows of the house. Other men lay in similar positions, their attention on the windows, their weapons ready. The windows stared blankly back.  The camera shifted back to the weapons carrier. A low voice spoke.  \"Let's have a look at that scope, Walton.\"  A man's back moved aside and the light and dark pattern of the range detector showed on the screen. The low voice spoke again.  \"Four of them,\" it said. \"Looks as though they've got a small arsenal in there with 'em. See those bright pips?\"  \"Khroal?\" queried another voice.  \"A couple of those, yeah,\" the first voice said. \"But that isn't too bad. Those are just antipersonnel. They've got a pair of rippers, too. Good thing we've got screens up. And there's a firebug. They could give those guys on the ground a real hard time.\" A finger appeared in front of the detector.  \"See that haze with the lines in it?\"  \"Them the charges?\"  \"That's right. They show up like that on both scopes, see? You can always spot heat-"]]]
