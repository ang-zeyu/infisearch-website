And the ox answered: \"I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and smeared over with pitch.\" Then the fox said: \"Well then, give me some pitch to rub on my side.\" And the fox was just going to take some pitch, when he stuck fast and couldn't free himself. And the old woman woke up and saw the fox sticking to the ox. So she ran to fetch her husband, and he came and took the fox and put him in the cellar as well.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The next day the old woman again sat down under the tree to spin her flax while the ox fed, and she began spinning and saying to herself: \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass!\" And she went on spinning and spinning and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a grey hare came running and ran right up against the ox. \"What sort of beast are you?\" he asked. \"I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and smeared over with pitch.\" Then the hare said: \"Well then, give me some pitch to rub on my side.\" \"Take some!\" answered the ox. And the hare caught hold of him with his teeth, when lo and behold! his teeth stuck fast. He tore and tore, but couldn't tear them free. And the old woman woke up, and ran to fetch her husband, and said: \"Come as quick as you can, there's a hare stuck to the ox!\" And the old man came, took the hare and flung him into the cellar. Then the old man began to grind his knife, and the bear heard him and asked: \"What are you grinding your knife for?\" And he answered: \"I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off your back and make myself a fur coat out of it.\" But the bear said: \"Oh! don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay you handsomely.\" \"Well, mind you do!\" answered the old man, and so he let the bear go free, and he ran off into the forest.  [Illustration]  The next day the old man again began to grind his knife outside the cellar, and the wolf asked him: \"What are you grinding your knife for?\" And he answered: \"I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off your back and make myself a fur coat out of it.\" But the wolf said: \"Oh! don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay you handsomely.\" \"Well, mind you do!\" answered the old man, and so he let the wolf too go free. And again he began to grind his knife outside the cellar, and the fox asked him: \"What are you grinding your knife for?\" And he answered: \"I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off your back, and make myself out of it a collar for my fur coat.\" But the fox said: \"Oh! don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay you handsomely.\" \"Well, mind you do!\" answered he.  [Illustration]  Then the hare was left all alone.  And again the old man began to grind his knife, and the hare asked him: \"What are you grinding your knife for?\" And he answered: \"I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off your back, and make myself some fur gloves out of it.\" But the hare said: \"Oh! don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay you handsomely.\" \"Well, mind you do!\" he answered, and let the hare too go free.  [Illustration]  Early the next morning the old man heard someone knocking at the gate, so he asked: \"Who's there?\" And the answer came: \"It's I, the bear, come to pay you my debt.\" And the old man opened the gate, and there was the bear with a hive of honey he had brought. So the old man took the honey, when again he heard knock-knock at the gate! \"Who's there?\" he asked, and the answer came: \"It's I, the wolf, come to pay you my debt.\" And there was the wolf with a whole flock of sheep he had driven up. So the old man let the sheep into the yard, when again he heard knock-knock at the gate. \"Who's there?\" he asked, and the answer came: \"It's I, the fox, come to pay you my debt.\" And there was the fox with a whole farm-yardful of cocks and hens, and ducks and geese. Suddenly there came another knock-knock at the gate. \"Who's there?\" asked the old man, and the answer came: \"It's I, the hare, come to pay you my debt.\" And he had brought with him a whole heap of cabbages. And the old man and his wife began to live happily together, and always spoke well and kindly of those beasts.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     THE FOX AND THE BLACKBIRD.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]   A fox was walking through the forest when he fell into a deep hole. And there he sat and sat, till all at once he began to feel hungry. He started looking round, but could see nothing. Then he looked up, and there he saw a blackbird in the tree above weaving its nest, and he said: \"Mr. Blackbird, Mr. Blackbird, what are you doing?\" And the blackbird answered: \"I'm weaving my nest.\" \"What are you weaving your nest for?\" asked the fox. \"To bring up my children in,\" answered the blackbird. \"But I'm going to eat your children,\" said the fox. \"Don't eat my children,\" answered the blackbird. \"Well then, feed me, I'm hungry,\" said the fox. At that the blackbird began to fret and to worry: how should he feed the fox? Then he flew off into the village, and brought back a chicken for the fox.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And the fox ate the chicken, and after a little he said: \"Mr. Blackbird, Mr. Blackbird, you fed me, didn't you?\" And the blackbird answered: \"Yes.\" \"Well then,\" said the fox, \"give me a drink!\" At that the blackbird began to fret and to worry: how was he to get the fox a drink? Then he flew off into the village, and brought back a little pailful of water for the fox.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And the fox had a good drink, and after a little he said: \"Mr. Blackbird, Mr. Blackbird, you fed me, didn't you?\" And the blackbird answered: \"Yes.\" \"And you got me a drink?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well then,\" said the fox, \"come and pull me out of the hole!\" At that the blackbird began to fret and to worry: how could he pull the fox out of the hole? Then he began to gather sticks in the forest and started throwing them into the hole. And he kept throwing them in and throwing them in, till he filled the hole. And the fox climbed up on to the sticks and out of the hole. And when he had climbed out, he lay down right under the tree. And there he lay and lay, and he said to the blackbird: \"Look here, you fed me, didn't you, Mr. Blackbird?\" And the blackbird answered. \"Yes.\" \"And you got me a drink?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you pulled me out of the hole?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well then,\" said the fox, \"now make me laugh!\" At that the blackbird began to fret and to worry: how should he make the fox laugh? At last he said: \"Very well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll fly into the village, and you run after me.\" So they agreed to do that, and the blackbird flew off into the village and perched on the gate of a rich peasant's house, while the fox lay down under the gateway. Then the blackbird began to sing: \"Mistress, Mistress, bring a lump of fat! Mistress, Mistress, bring a lump of fat!\" And the fox said: \"That's fine, let's have it again!\" So the blackbird began once more: \"Mistress, Mistress, bring a lump of fat! Mistress, Mistress, bring a lump of fat!\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Suddenly from under the gate a dog said angrily: \"Wow-wow!\" and the fox took to his heels and hopped it into the forest as quick as he could!  [Illustration]  And that's all about it.

THAN THE QUEEN'S LIFE!\"  \"The Queen is pretty well,\" Swift wrote to Lord Peterborough on May 18, 1714, \"at present, but the least disorder she has puts all in alarm.\" Swift goes on to tell his correspondent that \"when it is over we act as if she were immortal; neither is it possible to persuade people to make any preparations against an evil day.\"  Yet on the condition of Queen Anne's health depended to all appearance the continuance of peace in England.  While Anne was sinking down to death, rival claimants were planning to seize the throne; rival statesmen and rival parties were plotting, intriguing, sending emissaries, moving troops, organizing armies, for a great struggle.  Queen Anne had reigned for little more than twelve years.  She succeeded William the Third on March 8, 1702, and at the time when Swift wrote the words we have quoted, her reign was drawing rapidly to a close.  Anne was not a woman of great capacity or of elevated moral tone.  She was moral indeed in the narrow and more limited sense which the word has lately come to have among us.  She always observed decorum and propriety herself; she always discouraged vice in others; but she had no idea of political morality or of high {2} political purpose, and she had allowed herself to be made the instrument of one faction or another, according as one old woman or the other prevailed over her passing mood.  While she was governed by the Duchess of Marlborough, the Duke of Marlborough and his party had the ascendant.  When Mrs. Masham succeeded in establishing herself as chief favorite, the Duke of Marlborough and his followers went down.  Burnet, in his \"History of My Own Times,\" says of Queen Anne, that she \"is easy of access, and hears everything very gently; but opens herself to so few, and is so cold and general in her answers, that people soon find that the chief application is to be made to her ministers and favorites, who, in their turns, have an entire credit and full power with her.  She has laid down the splendor of a court too much, and eats privately; so that, except on Sundays, and a few hours twice or thrice a week, at night, in the drawing-room, she appears so little that her court is, as it were, abandoned.\"  Although Anne lived during the Augustan Age of English literature, she had no literary capacity or taste.  Kneller's portrait of the Queen gives her a face rather agreeable and intelligent than otherwise--a round, full face, with ruddy complexion and dark-brown hair.  A courtly biographer, commenting on this portrait, takes occasion to observe that Anne \"was so universally beloved that her death was more sincerely lamented than that of perhaps any other monarch who ever sat on the throne of these realms.\"  A curious comment on that affection and devotion of the English people to Queen Anne is supplied by the fact which Lord Stanhope mentions, that \"the funds rose considerably on the first tidings of her danger, and fell again on a report of her recovery.\"  [Sidenote: 1714--Fighting for the Crown]  England watched with the greatest anxiety the latest days of Queen Anne's life; not out of any deep concern for the Queen herself, but simply because of the knowledge that with her death must come a crisis and might come a revolution.  Who was to snatch the crown as it fell from Queen Anne's dying head?  Over at Herrenhausen, in {3} Hanover, was one claimant to the throne; flitting between Lorraine and St. Germains was another.  Here, at home, in the Queen's very council-chamber, round the Queen's dying bed, were the English heads of the rival parties caballing against each other, some of them deceiving Hanover, some of them deceiving James Stuart, and more than one, it must be confessed, deceiving at the same moment Hanoverians and Stuarts alike.  Anne had no children living; she had borne to her husband, the feeble and colorless George of Denmark, a great many children--eighteen or nineteen it is said--but most of them died in their very infancy, and none lived to maturity.  No succession therefore could take place, but only an accession, and at such a crisis in the history of England any deviation from the direct line must bring peril with it.  At the time when Queen Anne lay dying, it might have meant a new revolution and another civil war.  While Anne lies on that which is soon to be her death-bed, let us take a glance at the rival claimants of her crown, and the leading English statesmen who were partisans on this side or on that, or who were still hesitating about the side it would be, on the whole, most prudent and profitable to choose.  The English Parliament had taken steps, immediately after the Revolution of 1688, to prevent a restoration of the Stuart dynasty. The Bill of Rights, passed in the first year of the reign of William and Mary, declared that the crown of England should pass in the first instance to the heirs of Mary, then to the Princess Anne, her sister, and to the heirs of the Princess Anne, and after that to the heirs, if any, of William, by any subsequent marriage.  Mary, however, died childless; William was sinking into years and in miserable health, apparently only waiting and anxious for death, and it was clear that he would not marry again.  The only one of Anne's many children who approached maturity, the Duke of Gloucester, died just after his eleventh birthday.  The little duke was a pupil of Bishop Burnet, and was a child of great promise.  {4} Readers of fiction will remember that Henry Esmond, in Thackeray's novel, is described as having obtained some distinction in his academical course, \"his Latin poem on the 'Death of the Duke of Gloucester,' Princess Anne of Denmark's son, having gained him a medal and introduced him to the society of the University wits.\"  After the death of this poor child it was thought necessary that some new steps should be taken to cut off the chances of the Stuarts.  The Act of Settlement, passed in 1701, excluded the sons or successors of James the Second, and all other Catholic claimants, from the throne of England, and entailed the crown on the Electress Sophia of Hanover as the nearest Protestant heir, in case neither the reigning king nor the Princess Anne should have issue.  The Electress Sophia was the mother of George, afterwards the First of England.  She seems to have had good-sense as well as talent; her close friend Leibnitz once said of her that she was not only given to asking why, but also wanted to know the why of the whys.  She was not very anxious to see her son George made sovereign of England, and appeared to be under the impression that his training and temper would not allow him to govern with a due regard for the notions of constitutional liberty which prevailed even then among Englishmen.  It even seems that Sophia made the suggestion that James Stuart, the Old Pretender, as he has since been called, would do well to become a Protestant, go in for constitutional Government, and thus have a chance of the English throne.  It is certain that she strongly objected to his being compared with Perkin Warbeck, or called a bastard.  She accepted, however,"]]]
