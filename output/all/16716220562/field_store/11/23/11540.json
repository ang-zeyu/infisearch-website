In the morning I took Leonard's place in his church. We had the English Liturgy again. The thatched dome, with much tinier windows than the windows at home, but much more sun to fill them, seemed a sort of parable to me that morning. After I had finished the rite, I stayed on in the church, and spread out two letters before the Lord, so to speak. One was my schoolmaster's, the other was that one from Cecilia.  It took me half an hour to feel fairly sure of my answer. But I felt very sure then just as sure as I had been the night before but the answer was different.  I thought of my own fold and flock as I read my own friend's letter. How little the locum tenens seemed to see what I saw in them! I read Cecilia's letter, and compared 'her view of the importance of a country cure with my own. After all, I thought, the latter tended to be an exceptional view in our megalomaniac days. On the other hand, the locum tenens' view might be rather a normal one, and so might Cecilia's be. Cecilia's scorn, it was, that materially helped the answer to come as clearly as it did. The thought of a Cecilia reigning in that east-country vicarage seemed no more right than pleasant. It sounds a callous thing to say, but I left my lonely and convalescent friend with something of a sigh of relief, and no real misgiving. I felt troubled about his future certainly, but I saw clearly that I was not meant to take his place. I hoped to find the man who was meant to take it, however.  And, by God's help, I believe that I really did find him before many months were over.  A cousin of mine Richard East had been persuaded by a certain bishop to accept an urban charge.  I fancy the said bishop had been reared in a rather strait school of enthusiasts, who regarded work in slums as ideally the best sphere for clerics of activity. So he had routed my cousin out of his west-country village, and brought him to a big town--my cousin, who was an outdoor man from his youth. Curiously enough, at Cape Town, there was a letter waiting for me from him. Wouldn't I tell him something about the 'great spaces washed with sun'? The midland town in general seemed not to have gained his affections, though he loved his people one by one. 'I want to clear out,' he wrote, 'for the parish's sake more than for my own, if only I can find the right place to clear to. I'm not a townsman, and I think by now the bishop understands my small-mindedness. I haven't the breadth of a good modern citizen. I want to go to some Little Peddlington an African village might suit me. No, directly the right man turns up, I don't doubt the bishop will want to put him here in my room. Do you know of anyone likely?' I did know of someone.  I did not write back; I got on my boat and started off for home. I went down to the east country and set free the locum tenens. The village had a bridal look for my eyes; the red-thorn tree was just coming out, the roses would not be long now. I was in time to be at our yearly May games after all. Next day I went to the Midland town and saw my cousin; also, I saw his charge. I tried to look at it with Leonard Reeve's eyes, recalling to my remembrance that delirious night of his. Yes, though it was not South London, it had a drab look on a dull June day. There was a Warwick Arms, if no Surrey Arms. There was a shop with the authentic fragrance only two or three doors off. I knew that bishop, and I found him in, and in a listening mood, on the following day. He wanted to hear about Africa. I described missions and missionaries to him. Then I told him at some length about Leonard Reeve.  'Yes, you have drawn the man convincingly,' he said. 'You didn't invent those touches. I think he's a man after my own heart. I don't understand you people that bury yourselves in little rose-covered, immoral, earthy country villages. But I think I do understand the man that you have described.' I went straight to the point, and spoke of my cousin's parish. He agreed that my cousin was a disappointment. 'He's got the same peddling way of looking at things as you,' he said. 'I thought he'd flourish after transplantation, but I admit he doesn't seem to. Yes, I should think a desert and a barbarous people might suit him. I don't deny that he has vision, but his sense of perspective seems to be rather ridiculous.' I tried to arrange matters there and then after that, but his lordship became politic, and seemed a little afraid that he had said too much to me.  However, the business was on the way to be settled before I parted from him. It has been settled quite a long while now. My cousin, Richard East, now tramps the Kaffir paths and ministers in the hill chapel and in that seven-domed church at the mission station. I do not think that there is any Cecilia in his case, nor that there is likely to be one. He personifies the abstract too passionately to need the love of women.  Africa is personified to him the Cinderella of the continents, the drudge with a destiny worthy of her charms and her good-temper. He is writing a monograph on the Song of Solomon, he tells me. He follows certain scholars in his conjecture that the Shulamite was given back to a humble shepherd by Solomon, when she had conquered the latter by the power of her impassioned chastity. But he has his own theory as well that the true lovers were both of African blood, that she came from the Ophir-land south of the Zambesi, and thither returned in peace at last from the foam of perilous seas. Perhaps his argument is slender; but it is good for him to believe in it himself, I think, for surely it helps his work among those that he deems her descendants.  He works on out there, personifying and idealizing. I think he is as much in love with his country parish as I am with mine in England. May we both, in our placid and unfashionable ways, dream our dreams and see our visions! Meanwhile Leonard Reeve reigns in that midland town, and is treasured by the bishop who was not deceived when he expected a kindred spirit. He and Cecilia have chosen a date in this next November for their deferred marriage.  Their choice of month seems to me characteristic. I do not think they will be disappointed if the day is a little urban in its murkiness.  It is good for a man to be in love with his charge, is it not? Next time some fanatic of West-End work, or East-End work, or foreign mission work gets hold of you and talks excellent sense about discipline, and offering yourself to your bishop, and packing up your kit at a week's notice remember this story of mine!  Is it not well to import something of the precise devotion of Holy Matrimony into the general self-oblation of Holy Orders?  It is good to think that three of us friends have the very same sort of feeling Leonard Reeve for the crowds and the fogs and the odors; my cousin for the rock-sown plains and the little circles of thatched huts; I for the cornlands and the elm-shaded ridges and the cottage people.  Yes, to Leonard anything grimy is just as romantic as green fields to me, or brown veld to my cousin.  Do you know, I was asked to preach Leonard's Institution sermon last Whit Monday, and I dared to preach it? Cecilia, who was stately but really pleasant-looking, sat beneath me in the front pew. Leonard, in his stall, looked oppressed with the weight of the ceremony.  But his eyes lighted up, I saw, as I gave out my text. It was from the end of St. John's Gospel. I preached very shortly. I drew for that poor and earnest-looking congregation the picture of a dripping missionary as I had seen him. I told of him going about his business at dawn, cheered by the Easter Feast in front at the chapel on the hill. I passed up to it by the cheery camp-fire. I did not forget the smell of breakfast cooking, with its reminder of home afterwards.  Then I spoke of the charm of the town work that Leonard had been called to take up once again. I tried to paint it as he dreamed of it the crowds, the classes, the fog, the scent of the streets. Then I went higher to the Easter scene, the shore in the morning, the vision of the altar that dawns on a true man's work however deep the night of his failure may have been, wheresoever in all the world he is working.  Leonard looked gratefully at me as I came down the pulpit steps.  While we hurried along from the Service on our way to the station (Reeve was coming to see me off), I quoted some words to him. We were just passing that fish-shop.  'Awake, O north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden.'  His eyes kindled. 'Yes, old man,' he said; 'I've come into my garden. How I used to dream of this sort of reek out in Africa!'  I felt a gross materialist as I hurried home to my roses and red-thorn, leaving him to that visionary garden and those mystical spices.    THE PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE  I.  'When you have set Thought free for one particular end you cannot bind her again as you will.' Such is the purport of a certain historian's dictum, and I have proved the truth of what he says. Edgar used to go to the Place of Pilgrimage long ago in his holidays, but I used not to go with him. I did not sympathize with his veneration overmuch in those times of long ago. But I respected the desire for hero-worship, and helped him thither each year that he wanted to visit his shrine. He used to come up for his long holidays every year from the colony. I had known his father rather well, and he had not any settled home. His mother was dead, as well as his father. No one now that knew him need know what she was like, for he took after his father almost unmitigatedly. His father was blonde and aggressively Saxon in appearance."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22890"],["title","The Worlds of If (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _A Martian Odyssey and Others_     published in 1949.

THE WORLDS OF IF     I stopped on the way to the Staten Island Airport to call up, and that was a mistake, doubtless, since I had a chance of making it otherwise. But the office was affable. \"We'll hold the ship five minutes for you,\" the clerk said. \"That's the best we can do.\"  So I rushed back to my taxi and we spun off to the third level and sped across the Staten bridge like a comet treading a steel rainbow. I had to be in Moscow by evening, by eight o'clock, in fact, for the opening of bids on the Ural Tunnel. The Government required the personal presence of an agent of each bidder, but the firm should have known better than to send me, Dixon Wells, even though the N. J. Wells Corporation is, so to speak, my father. I have a--well, an undeserved reputation for being late to everything; something always comes up to prevent me from getting anywhere on time. It's never my fault; this time it was a chance encounter with my old physics professor, old Haskel van Manderpootz. I couldn't very well just say hello and good-bye to him; I'd been a favorite of his back in the college days of 2014.  I missed the airliner, of course. I was still on the Staten Bridge when I heard the roar of the catapult and the Soviet rocket _Baikal_ hummed over us like a tracer bullet with a long tail of flame.  We got the contract anyway; the firm wired our man in Beirut and he flew up to Moscow, but it didn't help my reputation. However, I felt a great deal better when I saw the evening papers; the _Baikal_, flying at the north edge of the eastbound lane to avoid a storm, had locked wings with a British fruitship and all but a hundred of her five hundred passengers were lost. I had almost become \"the late Mr. Wells\" in a grimmer sense.  I'd made an engagement for the following week with old van Manderpootz. It seems he'd transferred to N.Y.U. as head of the department of Newer Physics--that is, of Relativity. He deserved it; the old chap was a genius if ever there was one, and even now, eight years out of college, I remember more from his course than from half a dozen calculus, steam and gas, mechanics, and other hazards on the path to an engineer's education. So on Tuesday night I dropped in an hour or so late, to tell the truth, since I'd forgotten about the engagement until mid-evening.  He was reading in a room as disorderly as ever. \"Humph!\" he grunted. \"Time changes everything but habit, I see. You were a good student, Dick, but I seem to recall that you always arrived in class toward the middle of the lecture.\"  \"I had a course in East Hall just before,\" I explained. \"I couldn't seem to make it in time.\"  \"Well, it's time you learned to be on time,\" he growled. Then his eyes twinkled. \"Time!\" he ejaculated. \"The most fascinating word in the language. Here we've used it five times (there goes the sixth time--and the seventh!) in the first minute of conversation; each of us understands the other, yet science is just beginning to learn its meaning. Science? I mean that _I_ am beginning to learn.\"  I sat down. \"You and science are synonymous,\" I grinned. \"Aren't you one of the world's outstanding physicists?\"  \"One of them!\" he snorted. \"One of them, eh! And who are the others?\"  \"Oh, Corveille and Hastings and Shrimski--\"  \"Bah! Would you mention them in the same breath with the name of van Manderpootz? A pack of jackals, eating the crumbs of ideas that drop from my feast of thoughts! Had you gone back into the last century, now--had you mentioned Einstein and de Sitter--there, perhaps, are names worthy to rank with (or just below) van Manderpootz!\"  I grinned again in amusement. \"Einstein was considered pretty good, wasn't he?\" I remarked. \"After all, he was the first to tie time and space to the laboratory. Before him they were just philosophical concepts.\"  \"He didn't!\" rasped the professor. \"Perhaps, in a dim, primitive fashion, he showed the way, but I--_I_, van Manderpootz--am the first to seize time, drag it into my laboratory, and perform an experiment on it.\"  \"Indeed? And what sort of experiment?\"  \"What experiment, other than simple measurement, is it possible to perform?\" he snapped.  \"Why--I don't know. To travel in it?\"  \"Exactly.\"  \"Like these time-machines that are so popular in the current magazines? To go into the future or the past?\"  \"Bah! Many bahs! The future or the past--pfui! It needs no van Manderpootz to see the fallacy in that. Einstein showed us that much.\"  \"How? It's conceivable, isn't it?\"  \"Conceivable? And you, Dixon Wells, studied under van Manderpootz!\" He grew red with emotion, then grimly calm. \"Listen to me. You know how time varies with the speed of a system--Einstein's relativity.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Very well. Now suppose then that the great engineer Dixon Wells invents a machine capable of traveling very fast, enormously fast, nine-tenths as fast as light. Do you follow? Good. You then fuel this miracle ship for a little jaunt of a half million miles, which, since mass (and with it inertia) increases according to the Einstein formula with increasing speed, takes all the fuel in the world. But you solve that. You use atomic energy. Then, since at nine-tenths light-speed, your ship weighs about as much as the sun, you disintegrate North America to give you sufficient motive power. You start off at that speed, a hundred and sixty-eight thousand miles per second, and you travel for two hundred and four thousand miles. The acceleration has now crushed you to death, but you have penetrated the future.\" He paused, grinning sardonically. \"Haven't you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And how far?\"  I hesitated.  \"Use your Einstein formula!\" he screeched. \"How far? I'll tell you. _One second!_\" He grinned triumphantly. \"That's how possible it is to travel into the future. And as for the past--in the first place, you'd have to exceed light-speed, which immediately entails the use of more than an infinite number of horsepowers. We'll assume that the great engineer Dixon Wells solves that little problem too, even though the energy out-put of the whole universe is not an infinite number of horsepowers. Then he applies this more than infinite power to travel at two hundred and four thousand miles per second for _ten_ seconds. He has then penetrated the past. How far?\"  Again I hesitated.  \"I'll tell you. _One second!_\" He glared at me. \"Now all you have to do is to design such a machine, and then van Manderpootz will admit the possibility of traveling into the future--for a limited number of seconds. As for the past, I have just explained that all the energy in the universe is insufficient for that.\"  \"But,\" I stammered, \"you just said that you--\"  \"I did _not_ say anything about traveling into either future or past, which I have just demonstrated to you to be impossible--a practical impossibility in the one case and an absolute one in the other.\"  \"Then how _do_ you travel in time?\"  \"Not even van Manderpootz can perform the impossible,\" said the professor, now faintly jovial. He tapped a thick pad of typewriter paper on the table beside him. \"See, Dick, this is the world, the universe.\" He swept a finger down it. \"It is long in time, and\"--sweeping his hand across it--\"it is broad in space, but\"--now jabbing his finger against its center--\"it is very thin in the fourth dimension. Van Manderpootz takes always the shortest, the most logical course. I do not travel along time, into past or future. No. Me, I travel across time, sideways!\"  I gulped. \"Sideways into time! What's there?\"  \"What would naturally be there?\" he snorted. \"Ahead is the future; behind is the past. Those are real, the worlds of past and future. What worlds are neither past nor future, but contemporary and yet--extemporal--existing, as it were, in time parallel to our time?\"  I shook my head.  \"Idiot!\" he snapped. \"The conditional worlds, of course! The worlds of 'if.' Ahead are the worlds to be; behind are the worlds that were; to either side are the worlds that might have been--the worlds of 'if!'\"  \"Eh?\" I was puzzled. \"Do you mean that you can see what will happen if I do such and such?\"  \"No!\" he snorted. \"My machine does not reveal the past nor predict the future. It will show, as I told you, the conditional worlds. You might express it, by 'if I had done such and such, so and so would have happened.' The worlds of the subjunctive mode.\"  \"Now how the devil does it do that?\"  \"Simple, for van Manderpootz! I use polarized light, polarized not in the horizontal or vertical planes, but in the direction of the fourth dimension--an easy matter. One uses Iceland spar under colossal pressures, that is all. And since the worlds are very thin in the direction of the fourth dimension, the thickness of a single light wave, though it be but millionths of an inch, is sufficient. A considerable improvement over time-traveling in past or future, with its impossible velocities and ridiculous distances!\"  \"But--are those--worlds of 'if'--real?\"  \"Real? What is real? They are real, perhaps, in the sense that two is a real number as opposed to √-2, which is imaginary. They are the worlds that would have been _if_-- Do you see?\"  I nodded. \"Dimly. You could see, for instance, what New York would have been like if England had won the Revolution instead of the Colonies.\"  \"That's the principle, true enough, but you couldn't see that on the machine. Part of it, you see, is a Horsten psychomat (stolen from one of my ideas, by the way) and you, the user, become part of the device. Your own mind is necessary to furnish the background. For instance, if George Washington could have used the mechanism after the signing of peace, he could have seen what you suggest. We can't. You can't even "]]]
