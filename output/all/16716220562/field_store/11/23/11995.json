The difficulties in the way of such an enterprise might very well have disheartened any being less headstrong, any spirit less stubborn. There were forces opposed to him that seemed to overmatch his puny purpose as much as the giants overmatched the pigmy hero of the nursery tale.  St. George in the chivalrous legend had but one dragon to destroy; the young royal St. George set himself {24} with a light heart to attack a whole brood of dragons--the dragons of the great Whig party.  When George the Third came to the throne the government of the country was entirely in the hands of the Whigs.  The famous stately Whig Houses, the Houses of Cavendish, of Russell, of Temple, of Bentinck, of Manners, of Fitzroy, of Lennox, of Conway, of Pelham, of Wentworth, were as little subservient to the sovereign as the great Frankish nobles who stood about the throne of the Do-nothing kings.  The Tory party was politically almost non-existent.  No Tory filled any office, great or little, that was at the disposal of the Whigs, and the Whigs had retained their ascendency for well-nigh half a century.  Jacobitism had been the ruin of the Tory cause.  All Tories were not Jacobites, but, roughly speaking, all Jacobites were Tories, and there were still, even at the date of George's accession, stout-hearted, thick-headed Tory gentlemen who believed in or vaguely hoped for a possible restoration of a Stuart prince.  It is curious to find that, though the Whig ranks stood fast in defence of the House of Hanover, had made that House, and owed their ascendency to their loyalty to that House, the latest Hanoverian sovereign not only disliked them, but dealt them blow after blow until he overthrew their rule.  The Tories, who sighed for a Stuart prince over the water, suddenly found to their astonishment that they had a friend in the Hanoverian Guelph, whose name they hated, whose right to the throne they challenged, and whose authority they derided, when they dared not despise.  [Sidenote: 1761--The corrupt methods of the Whig party]  It cannot be denied that the Whigs had often abused, and more than abused, the privileges which their long lease of power had given to them.  All political parties ruled by corruption during the last century.  The Whig was not more corrupt than the Tory, but it can hardly be maintained that he was less corrupt.  The great Whig Houses bought their way to power with resolute unscrupulousness.  A majority in either House was simply a case of so much money down.  The genius of Walpole had secured his own pre-eminence at the cost of the almost total degradation {25} of the whole administrative system of the country.  When George the Third came to the throne the Whigs were firmly established in a powerful league of bigotry and in tolerance, cemented by corruption, by bribery, by purchase of the most uncompromising, of the basest kind.  George the Third had fostered through youthful years of silence those strong ideas of his own about the importance of the kingly office which he was now to proclaim by his deeds.  In the way of those strong ideas, in the way of the steadfast determination to be King in fact as well as in name, stood the great Whig faction, flushed with its more than forty years' debauch of power, insolent in the sense of its own omnipotence.  George was resolute to show that the claim to omnipotence was a sham, and, to do him justice, he succeeded in his resolve.  At the head of the Whig party in the House of Lords was the Duke of Newcastle.  At its head in the House of Commons was William Pitt. These two ministers seemed fixed and irremovable in their supreme authority.  While Newcastle lavished the money of the state in that spacious system of bribery which welded the party into so formidable a mass, it was the proud privilege of Pitt to illuminate its policy by his splendid eloquence at home and by the splendor of his enterprises abroad.  Both the ministers were an enormous expense to the country. Newcastle never counted the cost so long as there was a county member to be bought or a placeman to be satisfied.  Pitt never counted the cost so long as he could add another trophy of victory to the walls of Westminster Abbey and inscribe another triumph on England's roll of battles.  The sordid skill of Newcastle and the dazzling genius of Pitt seemed between them to make the Whig party invulnerable and irresistible.  There was no opposition in Upper or Lower House; there had been for many years no hint of royal opposition.  Everything promised a long continuance of the undisputed Whig sway when suddenly the secret determination of a young King and the secret instigations of a Scotch peer dissipated the stately fabric that had endured so long.  {26}  The fixed purpose of Lord Bute was to get rid of Pitt.  The fixed purpose of Lord Bute created the fixed purpose of the King, and the hours of Pitt's administration were numbered.  After a season of rare glory, of resplendent triumph, Pitt found himself face to face with a formidable coalition of interests against him, a coalition of interests none the less formidable because it was headed by a man for whose attainments, opinions, and ability Pitt must have felt, and scarcely concealed, the greatest contempt.  Pitt had not made himself an object of personal affection to those with whom he was brought into immediate contact.  In the time of his supremacy he had carried himself with a haughty arrogance, with an austere disdain which had set the smaller men about him raging in secret antagonism.  The King, driven on by his own dreams of personal authority, disliked the great minister.  Bute, drunk with the wild ambitions of a weak man, seems to have believed that in succeeding to Pitt's place he could also succeed to Pitt's genius.  Pitt soon became aware of the strength of the cabal against him.  While some of his colleagues were disaffected, others were almost openly treacherous.  Bute's manner waxed more arrogant in Council.  The King's demeanor grew daily cooler.  The great question of war or peace was the question that divided the Cabinet.  On a question of war or peace Bute triumphed and Pitt fell.  Pitt was all for carrying on the war, which had thus far proved so successful for the British flag.  But Pitt was not powerfully supported in his belief.  If he had his brothers-in-law James Grenville and Lord Temple on his side, he had ranged against him a powerful opposition formed by Henry Fox and George Grenville, by Lord Hardwicke and the Duke of Bedford.  On the side of the peace party Bute ranged himself, bringing with him all the enormous weight that his influence with the King gave him.  The case of the peace party was a simple, straight-forward case.  Why, they asked, should we continue to fight? Our sweet enemy France is on her knees and ready to accept our terms. Let us enforce those terms and make {27} a triumphant peace instead of further bleeding our exhausted treasury in the prosecution of a war from which we have now nothing more to gain.  Chance gave the peace party their opportunity.  Pitt had become cognizant of the treaty between France and Spain known as the \"Family Compact,\" the secret treaty which we have already fully described, by which the two Bourbon princes agreed to make common cause against England.  Pitt straightway proposed that the hostile purposes of Spain should be anticipated by an immediate declaration of war against Spain and the immediate despatch of a fleet to Cadiz.  Bute promptly opposed the proposal in the Cabinet, and carried the majority of the Council with him in his opposition.  Pitt instantly resigned.  [Sidenote: 1761--Pitt's probity]  A curious thing had happened at the coronation ceremony.  One of the largest jewels in the royal crown got loose and fell from its place. This was looked upon at the time by superstitious people as a sinister omen.  These now saw the fulfilment of their forebodings in the loss to the state of the services of the great minister.  The King himself had no sense that his regal glory was dimmed in its lustre by the resignation of Pitt.  He was so delighted at having got rid thus easily of the great obstacle to his own authority that he could readily consent to lend to the act of parting a gracious air of regret.  Much was done to lighten Pitt's fall.  Very liberal offers were made by the King, offers which seemed to many to mask a hope, and more than a hope, of undermining the popularity of the great leader.  Pitt declined several offers that were personal to himself, but expressed his readiness to accept some signs of the royal favor on behalf of his wife and his family.  A barony was conferred upon Pitt's wife and a pension of three thousand a year upon Pitt for three lives.  There was nothing unworthy in Pitt's action.  He was notoriously poor; he was no less notoriously honest; it was perfectly certain that, in an age when a successful politician was for the most part a peculator, no shilling of public money had ever stuck to Pitt's fingers.  If he was instantly attacked by libels and pamphlets that were {28} probably paid for by Bute, or that at least were inspired by a desire to please Bute, the attacks did Pitt more good than harm.  They produced a prompt reaction, and only had the effect of making Pitt more dear to the people than before.  His pictures had an enormous sale, and his partisans on the press poured out caricatures and lampoons upon Bute and his Scotchmen in greater volume and with greater violence than ever.  Bute was not content with the overthrow of Pitt.  He wished to stand in isolated splendor, and to accomplish this Newcastle too must go.  The great briber of yesterday had to give way to the great briber of to-day, and Bute stood alone before the world, the head of the King's Ministry, the favorite of the King, the champion of a policy that promised peace abroad"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23471"],["title","A History of the Four Georges and of William IV, Volume III (#6)"],["body"," purity at home, and that resulted in a renewal of war under conditions of peculiar disadvantage and a renewed employment of the basest forms of political corruption.  Bute had gained the power he longed for, but Bute was soon to learn that power need not and did not mean popularity.  \"The new Administration begins tempestuously,\" Walpole wrote on June 20, 1762.  \"My father was not more abused after twenty years than Lord Bute is after twenty days. Weekly papers swarm, and, like other swarms of insects, sting.\"  Bute affected an indifference to this unpopularity which he did not really feel.  It is not flattering to a statesman's pride to be unable to go abroad without being hissed and pelted by the mob, and it is hard for a minister to convince himself of the admiration of a nation when a strong bodyguard is necessary to secure him from the constant danger of personal attacks.  Bute's character did not refine under the tests imposed upon it.  His objectionable qualities grew more and more unpopular.  The less he was liked the less he deserved to be liked. Adversity did not magnify that small soul.  In his mean anger he sought for mean revenge.  Every person who owed an appointment to the former ministry felt the weight of the favorite's wrath.  Dismissal from office was the order of the day, and Whig after Whig was forced to leave his place or office open for {29} some Tory who was ready to express an enthusiasm for the statesmanship of Bute.  [Sidenote: 1762--Bute's foreign policy]  Bute's idea of a foreign policy was to reverse the policy of Pitt.  He abandoned Frederick of Prussia to his enemies by cutting off the subsidy which Pitt had paid him, on the ground that the time agreed on for the subsidy was up, and that as England only granted it for her own purposes, and not to benefit Frederick, she was justified in discontinuing it whenever it suited her.  Only a chance saved the Great Frederick from what seemed like inevitable ruin.  The Czarina, Elizabeth of Russia, died, and was succeeded by Peter the Third.  With the change of sovereign came a change in the purposes of Russia.  The Russian army, which had fought with Austria against Frederick, now received orders to fight with Frederick against Austria.  The war with Spain that Pitt had predicted Bute was obliged to wage.  The conduct of Spain made it impossible for him not to declare war, and, aided by Pitt's preparations, he was able to carry on the war with considerable success.  But the credit for such success was generally given to Pitt, and when Bute made peace with Spain and France it was generally felt that the terms were not such as Pitt would have exacted after so long and splendid a succession of victories.  There was, indeed, a good deal to be said for the peace, but at the time those who tried to say it did not get a very patient hearing.  It was well that the long Continental war was ended.  Few of those engaged in it had gained much by it. Prussia, indeed, though it left her wellnigh bankrupt and almost ruined by the enormous burdens she had sustained, was better in position.  She came out of the struggle without the loss of a single acre of territory, and with what Frederick especially coveted, the rank of a first-rate Power in Europe.  If Prussia, which had been so long England's ally, had gained, England had not lost.  Undoubtedly Pitt's war was popular; no less undoubtedly Bute's peace was unpopular, and the unpopularity of the policy intensified the unpopularity of the minister.  In the eyes of the bulk of the English people Lord Bute, as a Scotchman, was {30} a foreigner, as much a foreigner as if he hailed from France or the Low Countries.  Lord Chesterfield was finely disdainful of the popular opposition to Bute on account of his nationality.  \"If the vulgar are ever right,\" he said, \"they are right for the wrong reason.  What they selected to attack in Lord Bute was his being a Scotchman, which was precisely what he could not help.\" But it was not Bute's nationality, so much as his flagrant partiality to his fellow-countrymen, that made him unpopular.  His affection for his own countrymen, however admirable and even touching in itself, was resented fiercely by the English people, who found themselves threatened by a new invasion of the Picts and Scots.  Across the Border came a steady stream of Bute's henchmen, men with names that seemed outlandish and even savage to the Londoner, and every Scotchman found, or hoped to find, through the influence of Bute his way to office and emolument.  The growing hatred for Bute extended itself as rapidly as unjustly to the nation from which Bute came.  The story of Bute's Ministry is a story of astonishing mistakes.  The Tories, who for five-and-forty years had inveighed against the political corruption which, fostered by Walpole, seemed to have culminated under Newcastle, now boldly went in for a system of flagrant bribery which surpassed anything yet essayed by the most cynical of Whig ministers.  The Paymaster's Office became a regular mart where parliamentary votes were bought and sold as unblushingly as humbler folk bought and sold groceries across a counter.  A Ministry weakened by an unpopular peace, and only held together by such cynical merchandise, was not likely to withstand a strong storm, and the storm was not long in rising.  To swell the exchequer, the Ministry proposed to raise revenue by a tax on cider and perry.  It was resolved to levy an imposition of four shillings per hogshead on the grower of the apple wine and the pear wine.  The cider counties raised a clamor of indignation that found a ready echo in London.  Pitt, Beckford, Lyttelton, Hardwicke, Temple, all spoke against the proposed measure and {31} denounced its injustice.  George Grenville defended the bill.  [Sidenote: 1763--George Grenville's characteristics]  Grenville was one of those honorable and upright statesmen who do not contrive to make either honor or rectitude seem lovable qualities.  He had first made himself conspicuous as one of the Boy Patriots who rallied with Pitt against Walpole.  His abilities ran with swiftness along few and narrow channels.  He was desperately well informed about many things, and desperately in earnest about anything which he undertook.  Blessed or cursed with a solemnity that never was enlivened by a gleam of humor, a ray of fancy, or a flash of eloquence, Grenville regarded the House of Commons with the cold ferocity of a tyrannical and pompous schoolmaster.  A style of speech that would have made a discourse upon Greek poetry seem arid and a dissertation upon Italian painting colorless--if it were possible to conceive Grenville as wasting time or thought on such trifles--added no grace to the exposition of a fiscal measure or charm to the formality of a phalanx of figures.  He was gloomy, dogged, domineering, and small-minded.  His nearest approach to a high passion was his worship of economy; his nearest approach to a splendid virtue was his stubborn independence. He abandoned Pitt for Bute because he detested Pitt's prodigal policy, but Bute was the more deceived if he fancied that he was to find in Grenville the convenient mask that he had lost in Newcastle; and the King himself had yet to learn how indifferent the dry, morose pedant and preacher could be not merely to royal favor, but even to the expression of royal opinion.  It was truly said of him by the greatest of his contemporaries that he seemed to have no delight out of the House except in such things as in some way related to the business that was to be done within it.  The \"undissipated and unwearied application\" which he devoted to everything that he undertook was now employed in exasperating the country.  The time was not yet ripe for it to be employed in dismembering the empire.  In his support of the cider tax Grenville managed to {32} make it and himself ridiculous at the same time.  In his defence he kept asking, over and over again, \"Where will you find another tax? tell me where.\" Pitt, who was listening disdainfully to his arguments, followed one of these persistent interrogations by softly singing to himself, very audibly, the words which belonged to a popular song, \"Gentle shepherd, tell me where.\"  The House took the hint with delight, and the title of Gentle Shepherd remained an ironical adornment of Grenville for the rest of his life.  Bute's disregard of public opinion was contrasted to his disadvantage with the conduct of Sir Robert Walpole, who bowed to the demonstration against his far wiser system of excise.  Bute forced his tax forward in defiance of the popular feeling, and then, apparently alarmed by the strength of the spirit he had himself raised, he answered the general indignation by a sudden and welcome resignation on April 8, 1763.  This was the end of Bute's attempt to be the recognized head of a government, though he still hoped and believed that he could rule from behind the throne instead of standing conspicuously at its side.  To his unpopularity as a foreigner, to his unpopularity as a favorite, public hostility added a fresh, if a far-fetched and fantastic reason for detesting Bute.  It was pointed out that he had Stuart blood in his veins, that an ancestor of his had been the brother of a Scottish King. Any stick is good enough to strike an unpopular statesman with, and there were not wanting people to assert, and perhaps even to believe, that Bute had entertained insidious schemes for raising himself to the throne.  Bute is said to have declared that he resigned in order to avoid involving the King in the dangers with which his minister was threatened.  If he did feel any fears for the King's safety he had certainly done his best to make those fears reasonable.  It has not often been given to any statesman to hold the highest office in the state for so short a time, and in that time to accomplish so large an amount of harm.  And the immediate harm of that year and a"]]]
