[Illustration: LONGFELLOW'S BIRTHPLACE, PORTLAND, MAINE.]   10  Suppose some friends travel on the railroad to visit us. At what railroad station would the train arrive? Are there any other stations? How are they built? Do you think they give a beautiful, clean, friendly welcome to strangers? All stations should be pleasant and comfortable to cheer the tired travelers that pass through them day and night. At Denver, just outside of the station, there is a great arch stretching across the street. It says, \"Welcome,\" in bright letters at night and in pretty letters in the day. The visitor is glad to see the friendly word after a long trip.  [Illustration: OLD SOUTH CHURCH, BOSTON.]   11  When friends come from another town we like to show them the sights. Plan a nice trip around the town. Write a list of places to which you would take them. You must know where each place is. What could you tell about each place?   12  One day we should visit some park. Is there any near our school? Are there any interesting buildings or statuary in the park? Is there any water near by?  When we visit our town park we should remember that it belongs to us, for a public park belongs to all of the people. Do you not like to have the things that belong to you as good, as useful and as beautiful as possible? Do you want your home to look sweet and clean and comfortable, or dirty, careless and unpleasant? Do you want your clothing to be strong, neat and pretty, or torn and dirty? We should all take pride in having the things we own just as good as possible. When you are in the street, the school, any public building, or in a park, say to yourself, \"This is mine.\" Then look around and see whether you like the way it looks. Think how you can help to keep it looking well or make it look even better.  [Illustration: WINTER SCENE IN FAIRMOUNT PARK.]  How can boys and girls help keep the grass, the paths, the flower-beds, the trees and the buildings beautiful? Where does the money come from to pay the caretakers of the park?  Some people visit the park only in spring, summer or autumn. We all love the park in those seasons. Many do not know how beautiful the bare trees look in winter with their gray or brown branches. There is no more exquisite sight in the world than to see these trees coated with glistening ice out to the tiniest twig, or to see them ridged with pearly white snow. It is a merry sight to see the jolly coasters and skaters.   13  Copy the list of buildings given below and mark each kind that you have seen. Tell where you saw it, of what it was built, or for what it was used.    Residence    School                 Museum   Store        Church                 Car-barn   Bank         Hospital               Library   Factory      Railroad station       Office   Stable       Government building    Garage   Dairy        Barn                   Ice House  What building is shown on the cover of this book?     CHAPTER IV  THE TOWN AS A WHOLE   1  Think of the times when you have walked or ridden about our town.  What rivers did you see?  [Illustration: CAPITOL AT HARRISBURG.]  Which buildings did you think were very beautiful?  What was each used for?  What buildings have we that are very helpful to the people?  What interesting places have you visited in your neighborhood?  What other places would you like to visit?   2  PREPARATION FOR A TRIP TO SOME HILLTOP, OBSERVATORY, TOWER OR ROOF-GARDEN FROM WHICH AN EXTENSIVE VIEW CAN BE HAD  What place shall we visit? Why? Draw a plan to include the school and the place to be visited.  How far must we go? Shall we ride or walk? In what direction shall we go?  When we are up high we can look over the whole neighborhood. First, try to find our school. In what direction shall we need to face? Then let us notice what lies between us and our school. See if you can find any park or large building which you know. Try to find the street or road upon which your home stands. Then look beyond our school for any other familiar building or park, and look for your home if you did not see it before. Notice how far the town stretches and try to see what cuts it off or bounds it.  Next we shall turn and look in the opposite direction. What direction will that be? Find any familiar places. How can you know which are homes, schools, churches or factories? See how far the town extends and what cuts off or bounds it on this side.  In what other directions shall we look? Again we shall notice the familiar and unfamiliar places and the town boundaries.   3  THE TRIP   4  Was the neighborhood view like you expected? What surprised you? What did we see most of? Make a list of all the places you remember seeing. Think of each view separately; north, south, east and west. Tell of anything you saw as you looked in each direction. Why could we see so much? How could we see even farther?   5  Do we live in a large city, a small town or in the country? What is the name of our town or the nearest town? Who first settled in the place which has grown to be a town? It is hard for us to believe that two hundred and fifty years ago there were no houses, churches, schools, streets or roads where we now live. All this land was wild country, mostly woods. The early settlers were strong and brave men. They had to cut down the forests and build their first homes of rough logs. Then they planted fields with corn, wheat and vegetables. They killed the wild animals for food, using the skins for clothing. As soon as possible the settlers tried to build a small plain church and a school-house.  [Illustration: CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. From a \"Thistle\" Print.   (Copyright, Detroit Publishing Co.)]  [Illustration: COLUMBUS'S SHIP.]  Now we have our fine towns which have grown from the early work of these first sturdy settlers. All of the people should love our dear home town and try to make it beautiful, healthful and comfortable. We should love our neighbors and treat them all like brothers and sisters. If we are true to our village or our dear town we will be kind and fair to all, rich and poor, Americans and foreigners, white and colored people. That is one way of showing our thankfulness for our comfortable homes.     CHAPTER V  THE PEOPLE   1  Think of the many buildings which you see as you look over the landscape. There are people living in nearly all of those houses. Just think of the many, many people who live here. How many are there? How many schools have we in the town? How many people go to your school?  Most of these people look much alike, but some are very different in appearance. Name some of the different kinds of people whom you have seen. How do you distinguish a negro and Chinaman or Mongolian from a white person or Caucasian? Tell about their hair, skin or any other peculiar features.  Each kind of people is called a race. The pictures show some of the races we often see--Caucasian, Mongolian and negro. The Chinese and Japanese are called Mongolians.   2  THE INDIANS  The Indians lived at this place which is now our home long before there were any white people here or any towns at all. Where these many buildings now stand there was wild country, fields and woods. Under the trees stood the Indian wigwams made of skins and branches. The early settlers came to this country from far across the ocean. After William Penn landed with his companions he began at once to make friends with the Indians. As the red men were living upon the land, Penn thought that it was only fair and honest to buy from them the land that the English people wanted for their homes. The Indians could not use money, so he gave them blankets and other presents which pleased them very much. The Indians promised William Penn to live in peace with the white men and they kept their promise for many years.  [Illustration: AN INDIAN FAMILY.]  Most of the white people who came in those early days to other parts of our land did not act in this noble way. When they wanted land on which to build their homes they drove the Indians away, killing many of them. Thus these unjustly treated Indians became the enemies of the white men, and often treated them very cruelly in return. Let us remember that the Indians were the first owners of this land of ours and that they should be treated as William Penn showed us, with kindness and justice.  [Illustration: INDIAN CHIEF.]  Those wild Indians of long ago had many noble traits. They were strong and brave and fearless.      Read in some of your school books about Indians and their homes.   3  THE NEGROES  There were no negroes in this country till many years after Columbus and the other white men began to settle here. Some white men went far across the sea to Africa. They stole the negroes away from their homes, carried them to their ships and sailed back to this country. Then these white men sold the negroes to other men for money. The poor colored men had to work terribly hard as slaves and received no pay for their work. At last they were freed by Abraham Lincoln and others who helped him.  [Illustration: NEGRO.]  The negroes have much that is fine in their character. Even when they were slaves they often grew to love their masters so dearly that they would do anything in the world, even give up their lives, for their masters. We should always remember that God made the negro as well as the white man. Fair-minded people will try to be honest, kind and just to everyone.   4  THE CHINESE  [Illustration: CHINESE MANDARIN AND SERVANT.]  Many Chinamen have come to our country from their distant homes in China. Their country is so crowded, and it is so hard to earn a living there, that most of the people are very poor.  The Chinese living in our country are peaceful and quiet. They work very hard in their laundries and other places of business; yet there are many white people so cruel and thoughtless as to ridicule a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22911"],["title","Where We Live (#3)"],["body","whenever they see one. These white people should remember that God made the Chinaman and that he is a stranger here in our country. Is it not even worse to ill-treat a stranger than one who is at home? The color of our skin and hair is not very important. It matters far more whether we are honest, loving, industrious and fair-minded.  Not all of the white people living around us were born in this country. Where did your parents and grandparents live when they were children? Do you know any people who came from distant lands? Where were their first homes? Find out how many of the parents of your schoolmates came a long journey over the water to reach our land.  Yes, we have people from many foreign countries. Some are English, Irish, Scotch or French. Then there are the Germans, Italians, Russians and others. From what country did each of these people come?  Here they are all living together, people from all over the great wide world. Our homes stand side by side. We work and play together. Truly we are brothers and sisters, for we are all children in the great human family. It matters not from what distant land our people may have come, we should all be bound together like one family by human love and kindness.     CHAPTER VI  INDUSTRIES AND OCCUPATIONS   1  Which members of your family work? Why do they work? For what is the money they earn spent? Think which of these things are absolutely necessary to keep us alive.  We all need _food_.  We all need _clothing_.  We all need _homes or shelter_.  Without these provisions we should die.  How do we get our food, our clothing and our homes? How did people get them when there were no stores and no money? Do you know of any people who were compelled to get things in this way?      In a school reader, read about how primitive people lived.   2  THE SOIL  We have two kinds of food, vegetable food, which grows from the ground, and animal food. Name some foods of each kind. All plants grow out of the earth or soil. The soil is necessary to produce our animal food also. The meat we eat comes from sheep, cows, chickens and other animals. These animals all live on vegetable food. Without good soil there would be no grass nor hay. No grass would mean no food for cows and sheep. So we see that all of our food really comes from the soil.  Our clothing, too, is dependent upon the soil. The cotton plant grows up out of the ground. The wool comes from the sheep, which eats grass which grows from the ground.  Even our homes could not be built without products from the earth or soil. Think how much wood is used in the construction of a house. The trees which grow in the soil give us all the wood. Much iron, steel, copper, brass and nickel are used in our homes. Stones and bricks form part of many houses. All of these things come out of the earth. What a wonderful thing is the soil! Out of it come our food, our clothing and our shelter!      In one of your books read the wonderful story of how we obtain a     loaf of bread.   3   Write a list of all the kinds of work you can think of which people do.  Copy this list of industries and place a cross beside the ones at which any persons you know work:    Mining                 Printing and bookmaking   Weaving                Iron and steel work   Shipbuilding           Glass-blowing   Lumbering              Pottery making   Brickmaking            Meat packing   Farming                Dairying   Manufacturing foods    Manufacturing clothing   Ice cutting            Manufacturing furniture  Which are town industries? Which are country industries?   4  Would you like to go to-morrow to visit a factory in which some food or clothing is manufactured? Look at the map of the town. Find your school. Find the factory. How far must we go and in what direction? What is the name of the place we will visit? Notice all of the things made there. Try to remember all of the materials needed at the factory, and find out where these materials come from. Try to remember just how the articles are made. Find out what will be done with the things that are manufactured. Notice the number and kinds of machines used. See how many workmen are employed.   5  AFTER THE TRIP  Write a letter to a friend in another class telling all about your visit. Mention these points:  1. Where you went.  2. What was made.  3. How it was made.  4. The materials used.  5. The machinery.  6. The workmen.  7. The usefulness of the factory.  8. The care and skill of the workmen.  9. Anything else interesting about the trip.   6  Every town and every village is a workshop. There are many workmen here that do good, careful work. Some of the goods of our town may be sent thousands of miles away to other people who need them. The country people, too, do much useful work. Name some of the things which our workmen do for other people living at a distance from us.      Read about the manufacture of the articles which you saw being made     at the factory.   7  There are many workers in the world who do not make things with their hands. Most of their work is done with their minds, though, of course, their hands help too. Name some of these. What kind of work does each of the following do?    Teacher    Lawyer    Minister   Doctor     Author    Banker     CHAPTER VII  ANIMALS AND PLANTS   1  There are many other living creatures in the world besides people. Write a list of all the kinds of animals that you have ever seen.  [Illustration: AMERICAN BUFFALO.]  Some of these animals live near the homes of men. They are tame. Men take care of them and see that they get food. Many of these animals are very useful to us. Write a list of these tame animals. At the top of the list write _Domestic Animals_. Of what use is each of the following animals when alive? Which are useful after they are killed? Of what use to man is each one?    Horse    Pig    Chicken   Cow      Dog    Duck   Sheep    Cat    Pigeon.      Read about how our meat is supplied to us.   2  Write a list of all the _wild animals_ you remember ever having seen. Where did you see them? How were they prevented from harming people? Where was the natural home of these animals? How did they get their food? How do they now get their food?  [Illustration: RACCOON.]  Some of these animals so closely resemble the domestic animals that they are said to belong to the same family. Read the names of the animals belonging to the same family and tell in what way they resemble each other. Tell which are domestic and which are wild.  THE CAT FAMILY    Cat    Lion    Tiger    Leopard  [Illustration: TIGER.]  THE DOG FAMILY    Dog    Fox    Wolf  THE HORSE FAMILY    Horse    Zebra  THE COW FAMILY    Cow    Buffalo  Describe some of these wild animals:    Elephant    Fox   Squirrel    Wolf   Bear        Deer  There are also many fish, birds and insects.  Paste in your notebook any pictures of animals.   3  Take a trip to the Zoological Gardens and see these animals.  [Illustration: LEOPARD.]   4  Which domestic or wild animals are useful to us in obtaining food, clothing and shelter?   5  PLANTS  We cannot live without food, clothing and shelter. Let us see how plants help us to obtain these three great necessities.  Write a list of all the plants that you can name.  Draw a line under each that is useful for _food_.  Draw two lines under each that is useful for _clothing_.  Draw three lines under each that is useful in making or furnishing our _homes or shelter_.  [Illustration: ELK.]  Of what use are the plants that are not underlined? Are they beautiful? How dull the world would be without flowers!  We have:  1. Food plants.  2. Clothing plants.  3. Shelter plants.  4. Ornamental plants.     CHAPTER VIII  TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION   1  Think of the foods that you had on your dinner table yesterday. Where did each come from? How did it get here? Was there anything which came from our own neighborhood, and which did not have to take a long journey either to the factory where it was manufactured or to the store where it was sold?  Examine the clothing you are wearing. Of what material is each article made? Where did the materials come from? Where were they manufactured? Which had to come a long journey before it reached your home?  Look around the school-room and name the materials which had to travel a long distance before we could have them for our use.  Imagine trying to get our food, our clothing and our shelter materials right near our school. How much could we be sure of having?   2  Perhaps you have seen products being brought into the city. You may have seen the milk trains unloading their many shining cans. Surely you have seen the freight cars with their signs painted on the outside telling that they are refrigerator cars, or coal cars, or other kinds of cars. What do they carry?  Most of the things we need are brought here on trains. Where is there in our neighborhood a freight railroad station? Is it near our school?  Some products are taken from the country to the town in wagons. You have seen the big hay wagons which go a long way from some farm to take food for the city horses.  [Illustration: CHINESE TRANSPORTATION.]  How else are products carried? Coffee, rubber, pepper, chocolate and much silk are brought here from distant lands in ships. If you go to the harbor of a large city you can see hundreds of busy men unloading the big steamers.   3  Ships and railroads carry not only foods but people too. There are many ways of carrying people and products. These are some of the ways:  1. On the backs of animals, as horses, camels, elephants.  2. In wheelbarrows.  3. In wagons.  4. In automobiles.  5. In trolley cars.  6. In railroad trains.  7. On boats, or ships.  8. In sleighs.  9. On bicycles.  10. In airships.  [Illustration: TRANSPORTATION IN ARABIA.]  In which of these ways have you traveled? Can you tell what power is used in each case?  In order to travel safely and quickly we need more than something in which to carry the "]]]
