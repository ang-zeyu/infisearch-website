Have you got clearance from this area?\"  \"It's me, Terry. Nancy. Nancy Comstock.\"  Terry Elston stepped front and center. \"That's not a very good joke. I knew Nancy. Hell of a way to die, killed by some maniac.\"  \"Terry, _I'm_ Nancy. Don't you recognize me?\"  Elston squinted. \"You look familiar. You look a little like Nancy. But you can't be her, because she's dead.\"  \"I'm here, and I tell you I'm _not_ dead.\"  \"Nancy's dead,\" Elston repeated mechanically. \"Say, what are you trying to pull?\"  \"Terry, behind you. A maniac!\"  \"Sure,\" Elston said. \"Sure. There's a maniac _behind_ me.\"  Collins stepped forward and hit Elston behind the ear. He fell silently.  Nancy stared down at him.  \"He refused to recognize me. He acted like I was crazy, pretending to be Nancy Comstock.\"  \"Come on along,\" Collins urged. \"They'll probably shoot us on sight as trespassers.\"  She looked around herself without comprehension.  \"Which way?\"  \"_This way._\"  Collins did not say those words.  They were said by the man with the gun in the uniform like the one worn by Elston. He motioned impatiently.  \"This way, this way.\"                     *       *       *       *       *  \"No priority,\" Colonel Smith-Boerke said as he paced back and forth, gun in hand.  From time to time he waved it threateningly at Collins and Nancy who sat on the couch in Smith-Boerke's office. They had been sitting for close to two hours. Collins now knew the Colonel did not intend to turn him over to the authorities. They were being held for reasons of Smith-Boerke's own.  \"They sneak the ship in here, plan for an unscheduled hop from an uncompleted base--the strictest security we've used in ten or fifteen years--and now they cancel it. This is bound to get leaked by somebody! They'll call it off. It'll never fly now.\"  Collins sat quietly. He had been listening to this all evening. Smith-Boerke had been drinking, although it wasn't very obvious.  Smith-Boerke turned to Collins.  \"I've been waiting for somebody like you. Just waiting for you to come along. And here you are, a wanted fugitive, completely in my power! Perfect, _perfect_.\"  Collins nodded to himself. Of course, Colonel Smith-Boerke had been waiting for him. And Doc Candle had driven him right to him. It was inescapable. He had been intended to escape and turn up right here all along.  \"What do you want with me?\"  Smith-Boerke's flushed face brightened. \"You want to become a hero? A hero so big that all these trumped-up charges against you will be dropped? It'll be romantic. Back to Lindbergh-to-Paris. Tell me, Collins, how would you like to be the first man to travel faster than light?\"  Collins knew there was no way out.  \"All right,\" he said.  Smith-Boerke wiped a hand across his dry mouth.  \"Project Silver _has_ to come off. My whole career depends on it. You don't have anything to do. Everything's cybernetic. Just ride along and prove a human being can survive. Nothing to it. No hyperdrives, none of that kind of stuff. We had an engine that could go half lightspeed and now we've made it twice as efficient and more. No superstitions about Einstein, I hope? No? Good.\"  \"I'll go,\" Collins said. \"But what if I had said 'no'.\"  Smith-Boerke put the gun away in a desk drawer.  \"Then you could have walked out of here, straight into the MP's.\"  \"Why didn't they come in here after me?\"  \"They don't have security clearance for this building.\"  \"_Don't_ leave me alone,\" Nancy said urgently. \"I don't understand what's happening. I feel so helpless. I need help.\"  \"You're asking the wrong man,\" Collins said briefly.                     *       *       *       *       *  Collins felt safe when the airlock kissed shut its metal lips.  It was not like the house, but yet he felt safe, surrounded by all the complicated, expensive electronic equipment. It was big, solid, sterilely gleaming.  Another thing--he had reason to believe that Doc Candle's power could not reach him through metal.  \"But I'm not outside,\" Doc Candle said, \"I'm in here, with you.\"  Collins yelled and cursed, he tried to pull off the acceleration webbing and claw through the airlock. Nobody paid any attention to him. Count downs had been automated. Smith-Boerke was handling this one himself, and he cut off the Audio-In switch from the spaceship. Doc Candle said nothing else for a moment, and the spaceship, almost an entity itself, went on with its work.  The faster-than-light spaceship took off.  At first it was like any other rocket takeoff.  The glow of its exhaust spread over the field of the spaceport, then over the hills and valleys, and then the town of Waraxe, spreading illumination even as far as Sam Collins' silent house.  After a time of being sick, Collins lay back and accepted this too.  \"That's right, that's it,\" Doc Candle said. \"Take it and die with it. That's the ticket.\"  Collins' eyes settled on a gauge. Three quarters lightspeed. Climbing.  Nothing strange, nothing untoward happened when you reached lightspeed. It was only an arbitrary number. All else was superstition. Forget it, forget it, forget it.  _Something_ was telling him that. At first he thought it was Doc Candle but then he knew it was the ship.  Collins sat back and took it, and what he was taking was death. It was creeping over him, seeping into his feet, filling him like liquid does a sponge.  Not will, but curiosity, caused him to turn his head.  He saw Doc Candle.  The old body was dying. He was in the emergency seat, broken, a ribbon of blood lacing his chin. But Doc Candle continued to laugh triumphantly in Collins' head.  \"Why? Why do you have to kill me?\" Collins asked.  \"Because I am evil.\"  \"How do you know you're evil?\"  \"_They told me so!_\" Candle shouted back in the thundering silence of Death's approach. \"They were always saying I was bad.\"  _They._                     *       *       *       *       *  Collins got a picture of something incredibly old and incredibly wise, but long unused to the young, clumsy gods. Something that could mar the molding of a godling and make it mortal.  \"But I'm not really so very bad,\" Doc Candle went on. \"I had to destroy, but I picked someone who really didn't care if he were destroyed or not. An almost absolutely passive human being, Sam. You.\"  Collins nodded.  \"And even then,\" said the superhuman alien from outer space, \"I could not just destroy. I have created a work of art.\"  \"Work of art?\"  \"Yes. I have taken your life and turned it into a horror story, Sam! A chilling, demonic, black-hearted horror!\"  Collins nodded again.  _LIGHTSPEED._  There was finally something human within Sam Collins that he could not deny. He wanted to live. It wasn't true. He did care what happened.  You do? said somebody.  He does? asked somebody else, surprised, and suddenly he again got the image of wiser, older creatures, a little ashamed because of what they had done to the creature named Doc Candle.  He does, chorused several voices, and Sam Collins cried aloud: \"I do! I want to live!\" They were just touching lightspeed; he felt it.  This time it was not just a biological response. He really wanted help. He wanted to stay alive.  From the older, wiser voices he got help, though he never knew how; he felt the ship move slipwise under him, and then a crash.  And Doc Candle got help too, the only help even the older, wiser ones could give him.                     *       *       *       *       *  They pulled him out of the combined wreckage of the spaceship and his house. Both were demolished.  It was strange how the spaceship Sam Collins was on crashed right into his house. Ed Michaels recalled a time in a tornado when Sy Baxter's car was picked up, lifted across town and dropped into his living room.  When the men from the spaceport lifted away tons of rubble, they found him and said, \"He's dead.\"  No, I'm not, Collins thought. I'm alive.  And then they saw that he really was alive, that he had come through it alive somehow, and nobody remembered anything like it since the airliner crash in '59.  A while later, after they found Doc Candle's body and court-martialed Smith-Boerke, who took drugs, Nancy was nuzzling him on his hospital bed. It was nice, but he wasn't paying much attention.  I'm free, Collins thought as the girl hugged him. _Free!_ He kissed her.  Well, he thought while she was kissing him back, as free as I want to be, anyway.

The second edition of \"Evolution, Old and New,\" which was published     in 1882 and re-issued with a new title-page in 1890, was merely a     re-issue of the first edition with a new preface, an appendix, and     an index. At a later date, though I cannot say precisely when,     Butler revised the text of the book in view of a future edition. The     corrections that he made are mainly verbal and do not, I think,     affect the argument to any considerable extent. Butler, however,     attached sufficient importance to them to incur the expense of     having the stereos of more than fifty pages cancelled and new     stereos substituted. I have also added a few entries to the index,     which are taken from a copy of the book, now in my possession, in     which Butler made a few manuscript notes.      R. A. STREATFEILD.      _October, 1911._     AUTHOR'S PREFACE  TO  THE SECOND EDITION   Since the proof-sheets of the Appendix to this book left my hands, finally corrected, and too late for me to be able to recast the first of the two chapters that compose it, I hear, with the most profound regret, of the death of Mr. Charles Darwin.  It being still possible for me to refer to this event in a preface, I hasten to say how much it grates upon me to appear to renew my attack upon Mr. Darwin under the present circumstances.  I have insisted in each of my three books on Evolution upon the immensity of the service which Mr. Darwin rendered to that transcendently important theory. In \"Life and Habit,\" I said: \"To the end of time, if the question be asked, 'Who taught people to believe in Evolution?' the answer must be that it was Mr. Darwin.\" This is true; and it is hard to see what palm of higher praise can be awarded to any philosopher.  I have always admitted myself to be under the deepest obligations to Mr. Darwin's works; and it was with the greatest reluctance, not to say repugnance, that I became one of his opponents. I have partaken of his hospitality, and have had too much experience of the charming simplicity of his manner not to be among the readiest to at once admire and envy it. It is unfortunately true that I believe Mr. Darwin to have behaved badly to me; this is too notorious to be denied; but at the same time I cannot be blind to the fact that no man can be judge in his own case, and that after all Mr. Darwin may have been right, and I wrong.  At the present moment, let me impress this latter alternative upon my mind as far as possible, and dwell only upon that side of Mr. Darwin's work and character, about which there is no difference of opinion among either his admirers or his opponents.  _April 21, 1882._     PREFACE.   Contrary to the advice of my friends, who caution me to avoid all appearance of singularity, I venture upon introducing a practice, the expediency of which I will submit to the judgment of the reader. It is one which has been adopted by musicians for more than a century--to the great convenience of all who are fond of music--and I observe that within the last few years two such distinguished painters as Mr. Alma-Tadema and Mr. Hubert Herkomer have taken to it. It is a matter for regret that the practice should not have been general at an earlier date, not only among painters and musicians, but also among the people who write books. It consists in signifying the number of a piece of music, picture, or book by the abbreviation \"Op.\" and the number whatever it may happen to be.  No work can be judged intelligently unless not only the author's relations to his surroundings, but also the relation in which the work stands to the life and other works of the author, is understood and borne in mind; nor do I know any way of conveying this information at a glance, comparable to that which I now borrow from musicians. When we see the number against a work of Beethoven, we need ask no further to be informed concerning the general character of the music. The same holds good more or less with all composers. Handel's works were not numbered--not at least his operas and oratorios. Had they been so, the significance of the numbers on Susanna and Theodora would have been at once apparent, connected as they would have been with the number on Jephthah, Handel's next and last work, in which he emphatically repudiates the influence which, perhaps in a time of self-distrust, he had allowed contemporary German music to exert over him. Many painters have dated their works, but still more have neglected doing so, and some of these have been not a little misconceived in consequence. As for authors, it is unnecessary to go farther back than Lord Beaconsfield, Thackeray, Dickens, and Scott, to feel how much obliged we should have been to any custom that should have compelled them to number their works in the order in which they were written. When we think of Shakespeare, any doubt which might remain as to the advantage of the proposed innovation is felt to disappear.  My friends, to whom I urged all the above, and more, met me by saying that the practice was doubtless a very good one in the abstract, but that no one was particularly likely to want to know in what order my books had been written. To which I answered that even a bad book which introduced so good a custom would not be without value, though the value might lie in the custom, and not in the book itself; whereon, seeing that I was obstinate, they left me, and interpreting their doing so into at any rate a modified approbation of my design, I have carried it into practice.  The edition of the 'Philosophie Zoologique' referred to in the following volume, is that edited by M. Chas. Martins, Paris, Librairie F. Savy, 24, Rue de Hautefeuille, 1873.  The edition of the 'Origin of Species' is that of 1876, unless another edition be especially named.  The italics throughout the book are generally mine, except in the quotations from Miss Seward, where they are all her own.  I am anxious also to take the present opportunity of acknowledging the obligations I am under to my friend Mr. H. F. Jones, and to other friends (who will not allow me to mention their names, lest more errors should be discovered than they or I yet know of), for the invaluable assistance they have given me while this work was going through the press. If I am able to let it go before the public with any comfort or peace of mind, I owe it entirely to the carefulness of their supervision.  I am also greatly indebted to Mr. Garnett, of the British Museum, for having called my attention to many works and passages of which otherwise I should have known nothing.  _March 31, 1879._     CONTENTS.
