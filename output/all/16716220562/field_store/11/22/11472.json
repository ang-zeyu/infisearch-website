It is introduced by a short instrumental prelude, Zion, represented by the tenor voice, and the Believers by the chorus, coming in after a few bars and alternating with extraordinary vocal effect. It calls for the highest dramatic power, and in its musical development is a web of wonderful harmonies such as we may look for only in the works of the mighty master of counterpoint. It fitly prepares the way for the two great movements which close the first part, an aria for soprano and alto, \"Alas! my Jesus now is taken,\" and a double chorus, \"Ye Lightnings, ye Thunders!\" The two solo voices join in a lament of a most touching nature, accompanied by the chorus exclaiming in short, hurried phrases, \"Let Him go! Hold! Bind Him not!\" until at last the double chorus bursts in like a tempest, accompanied with the full power of the instruments, expressing the world's indignation at the deed which is to be committed, in the words:--    \"Ye lightnings, ye thunders, in clouds are ye vanished!   Burst open, O fierce flaming caverns of hell!   Ingulf them, destroy them in wrathfullest mood!   Oh, blast the betrayer, the murderous brood!\"  and the first part concludes with a chorale, \"O Man, bewail thy great Sin!\"  The second part, originally sung after the sermon, opens with an aria for contralto, full of the deepest feeling, \"Alas! now is my Jesus gone,\" and one of the most beautiful numbers in the oratorio, wherein Zion, or the Church, mourns her great loss. The trial scene before Caiaphas and the threefold denial of Peter follow, leading up to the beautiful aria for alto, with violin obligato, \"Oh, pardon me, my God!\" Macfarren, in his admirable analysis, says of this aria,--    \"The deep, deep grief of a tormented conscience finds here an utterance   which fulfils the purport and far transcends the expression of the   words. One might suppose the power of the artist to have been   concentrated upon this one incident, so infinite is its beauty,--one   might suppose Bach to have regarded the situation it illustrates as   more significant than others of man's relation to Deity in his sense of   sin and need for mercy, and as requiring, therefore, peculiar   prominence in the total impression the oratorio should convey. If this   was his aim, it is all accomplished. The penitential feeling embodied   in the song is that which will longest linger in a remembrance of the   work. The soft tone of the contralto voice, and the keenness of that of   the violin, are accessories to the effect which the master well knew   how to handle; but these judicious means are little to be considered in   comparison with the musical idea of which they are the adjuncts.\"  The work now rapidly progresses to its beautiful finale. The soprano recitative in response to Pilate's question, \"He hath done only good to all,\" the aria for soprano, \"From love unbounded,\" the powerful contralto recitative, \"Look down, O God,\" the chorale, \"O Head all bruised and wounded!\" the contralto aria with chorus, \"Look where Jesus beckoning stands,\" and the peaceful, soothing recitative for bass, \"At Eventide, cool Hour of Rest,\" are the principal numbers that occur as we approach the last sad but beautiful double chorus of the Apostles, \"Around Thy Tomb here sit we weeping,\"--a close as peaceful as the setting of the sun; for the tomb is but the couch on which Jesus is reposing, and the music dies away in a slumber-song of most exalted beauty. This brief sketch could not better close than with the beautiful description which Mr. Dwight gives of this scene in the notes which he prepared when the work was performed at the Triennial Festival of the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston:--    \"How full of grief, of tender, spiritual love, of faith and peace, of   the heart's heaven smiling through tears, is this tone-elegy! So should   the passion-music close, and not with fugue of praise and triumph like   an oratorio. How sweetly, evenly, the harmony flows on,--a broad, rich,   deep, pellucid river, swollen as by countless rills from all the   loving, bleeding, and believing hearts in a redeemed humanity! How full   of a sweet, secret comfort, even triumph, is this heavenly farewell: It   is 'the peace which passeth understanding.' 'Rest Thee softly' is the   burden of the song. One chorus sings it, and the other echoes 'Softly   rest;' then both together swell the strain. Many times as this recurs,   not only in the voices, but in the introduction and frequent interludes   of the exceedingly full orchestra, which sounds as human as if it too   had breath and conscious feeling, you still crave more of it; for it is   as if your soul were bathed in new life inexhaustible. No chorus ever   sung is surer to enlist the singers' hearts.\"                               The Magnificat in D.   The Magnificat in D--known as the \"Great Magnificat,\" to distinguish it from the smaller--is considered one of the grandest illustrations of Bach's genius. It was composed for Christmas Day, 1723. Spitta says:--    \"The performance of the cantata 'Christen, ätzet diesen Tag,' with its   attendant 'Sanctus,' took place during the morning service, and was   sung by the first choir in the Nikolaikirche. In the evening the   cantata was repeated by the same choir in the Thomaskirche; and after   the sermon the Hymn of the Virgin was sung, set in its Latin form, and   in an elaborate style. For this purpose Bach wrote his great   'Magnificat.'\"  For the occasion of this festival he expanded the Biblical text into four vocal numbers; but in describing the work it is only necessary to give it as it is now generally sung.  The work is written for a five-part chorus, with organ and orchestral accompaniment. After a concerted introduction, foreshadowing the general character of the music, it opens with the chorus, \"Magnificat anima mea,\" in fugal form, worked up with that wonderful power of construction for which Bach is so renowned among all composers. It is followed by an aria for second soprano (\"Et exultavit spiritus meus: in Deo salutari meo\"), which is in the same key and has the same general feeling as the opening chorus, that of Christmas rejoicing. It in turn is followed by an aria for first soprano (\"Quia respexit humilitatem ancillæ suæ\"), of which Spitta says: \"Scarcely ever has the idea of virgin purity, simplicity, and humble happiness found more perfect expression than in this German picture of the Madonna, translated as it were into musical language.\" It leads directly to the chorus which takes up the unfinished words of the soprano (\"Omnes generationes\"), each part overlaying the other as it enters, and closing in canon form in grave and colossal harmony. Its next number is an aria for bass (\"Quia fecit mihi magna\"), of a simple and joyous character. It is followed by a melodious duet for alto and tenor (\"Et misericordia\"), with violin and flute accompaniment, setting forth the mercy of God, in contrast with which the powerful and energetic chorus (\"Fecit potentiam\") which succeeds it, is very striking in its effect. Two beautiful arias for tenor (\"Deposuit potentes de sede\") and alto (\"Esurientes implevit bonis\") follow, the latter being exquisitely tender in its expression, and lead to the terzetto (\"Suscepit Israel puerum suum: recordatus misericordiæ suæ\"), arranged in chorale form, and very plaintive and even melancholy in style. Its mourning is soon lost, however, in the stupendous five-part fugue (\"Sicut locutus est\") which follows it and which leads to the triumphant \"Gloria,\" closing the work,--a chorus of extraordinary majesty and power. Spitta, in his exhaustive analysis of Bach's music, says of this \"Magnificat\":--    \"It is emphatically distinct from the rest of Bach's grand church   compositions by the compactness and concentrated power of the separate   numbers,--particularly of the choruses,--by the lavish use of the means   at command, and by its vividly emotional and yet not too agitating   variety. It stands at the entrance of a new path and a fresh period of   his productivity, at once full of significance in itself and of promise   for the future development of the perennial genius which could always   re-create itself from its own elements.\"                                    BEETHOVEN.   A general sketch of the life and musical accomplishments of Beethoven has already appeared in the companion to this work, \"The Standard Operas.\" In this connection, however, it seems eminently fitting that some attention should be paid to the religious sentiments of the great composer and the sacred works which he produced. He was a formal member of the Roman Church, but at the same time an ardent admirer of some of the Protestant doctrines. His religious observances, however, were peculiarly his own. His creed had little in common with any of the ordinary forms of Christianity. A writer in \"Macmillan's Magazine\" some years ago very clearly defined his religious position in the statement that his faith rested on a pantheistic abstraction which he called \"Love.\" He interpreted everything by the light of this sentiment, which took the form of an endless longing, sometimes deeply sad, at others rising to the highest exaltation. An illustration of this in its widest sense may be found in the choral part of the Ninth Symphony. He at times attempted to give verbal expression to this ecstatic faith which filled him, and at such times he reminds us of the Mystics. The following passages, which he took from the inscription on the temple of the Egyptian goddess Neith at Sais, and called his creed, explain this: \"I am that which is. I am all that is, that was, and that shall be. No mortal man hath lifted my veil. He is alone by Himself, and to Him alone do all things owe their being.\" With all this mysticism his theology was practical, as is shown by his criticism of the words which Moscheles appended to his arrangement of \"Fidelio.\" The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22793"],["title","The Standard Oratorios: Their Stories, Their Music, And Their Composers (#7)"],["body","wrote at the close of his work: \"_Fine_, with God's help.\" Beethoven added: \"O man! help thyself.\" That he was deeply religious by nature, however, is constantly shown in his letters. Wandering alone at evening among the mountains, he sketched a hymn to the words, \"God alone is our Lord.\" In the extraordinary letter which he wrote to his brothers, Carl and Johann, he says: \"God looks into my heart. He searches it, and knows that love for man and feelings of benevolence have their abode there.\" In a letter to Bettina von Arnim, he writes: \"If I am spared for some years to come, I will thank the Omniscient, the Omnipotent, for the boon, as I do for all other weal and woe.\" In Spohr's album his inscription is a musical setting of the words, \"Short is the pain, eternal is the joy.\" In a letter to the Archduke Rudolph, written in 1817, he gives no uncertain expression to his divine trust. He says: \"My confidence is placed in Providence, who will vouchsafe to hear my prayer, and one day set me free from all my troubles; for I have served him faithfully from my childhood, and done good whenever it was in my power. So my trust is in him alone, and I feel that the Almighty will not allow me to be utterly crushed by all my manifold trials.\" Even in a business letter he says: \"I assure you on my honor--which, next to God, is what I prize most--that I authorized no one to accept commissions from me.\" His letters indeed abound in references to his constant reliance upon a higher Power. The oratorio, \"Christ on the Mount of Olives,\" six sacred songs set to poems of Gellert, the Mass in C written for Prince Esterhazy, and the Grand Mass in D written for the Archduke Rudolph, one of the grandest and most impressive works in the entire realm of sacred music, attest the depth and fervency of his religious nature.                               The Mount of Olives.   Beethoven wrote but one oratorio, \"Christus am Oelberg\" (\"Christ on the Mount of Olives\"). That he had others in contemplation, however, at different periods of his life is shown by his letters. In 1809 he wrote to Freiherr von Hammer-Purgstall, a famous Oriental scholar, appointing an interview for the discussion of the latter's poem on the subject of the deluge, with reference to its fitness for treatment as an oratorio. Again, in 1824, he writes to Vincenz Hauschka, of Vienna, that he has decided to write an oratorio on the text furnished by Bernard, the subject being \"The Victory of the Cross.\" This work, however, owing to his extreme physical sufferings at that period, was never begun, and the world thereby has suffered a great musical loss; for, judging from his great Mass in D, no one can doubt how majestic and impressive the \"Victory of the Cross\" would have been, as compared with the \"Mount of Olives,\" written in his earlier period, and before any of his masterpieces had appeared.  The \"Mount of Olives\" was begun in 1800, and finished during the following year. Beethoven never remained in Vienna during the summer. The discomforts of the city and his intense love for Nature urged him out into the pleasantly wooded suburbs of the city, where he could live and work in seclusion. Upon this occasion he selected the little village of Hetzendorf, adjoining the gardens of the imperial palace of Schönbrunn, where the Elector, his old patron, was living in retirement. Trees were his delight. In a letter to Madame von Drossdick, he says: \"Woods, trees, and rocks give the response which man requires. Every tree seems to say, 'Holy, Holy!'\" In the midst of these delightful surroundings he found his favorite tree, at whose base he composed the larger part of the oratorio, as well as his opera \"Fidelio.\" Schindler says: \"A circumstance connected with both these great works, and of which Beethoven many years afterwards still retained a lively recollection, was, that he composed them in the thickest part of the wood in the park of Schönbrunn, seated between the two stems of an oak, which shot out from the main trunk at the height of about two feet from the ground. This remarkable tree, in that part of the park to the left of the Gloriett, I found with Beethoven in 1823, and the sight of it called forth interesting reminiscences of the former period.\" The words of the oratorio were by Huber, the author of Winter's \"Unterbrochene Opferfest,\" and were written, with Beethoven's assistance, in fourteen days. That more time and attention were not given to the text was probably regretted by both poet and composer many times afterwards. The first performance of the work in its entirety took place at Vienna, April 5, 1803, at the Theater an der Wien, upon which occasion the programme also included the Symphony in D (second) and the Piano Concerto in C minor, the latter executed by himself. The oratorio was received with enthusiasm, and was repeated three times during that year.  The libretto of the work is unquestionably defective in the most salient qualities which should characterize the text of an oratorio, even to the degree of extravagance and sensationalism. It fails to reflect the sorrowful character of the scene it depicts, and the dramatic requirements which it imposes are often strained, and sometimes border on the grotesque. The theatrical style of the narrative was deplored by Beethoven himself at a subsequent period. Marx, one of the keenest of critics, says of the work:--    \"The poet had no other aim but that of making verses for a composer;   the latter, no other motive than the ordinary creative impulse   prompting him to try his powers in a different and important sphere.   The result on both sides could not therefore be other than phrases,   although the better of the two proceeded from the composer, and that   composer was Beethoven. To conceal or palliate this would be derogatory   to the reverence which we all owe to Beethoven; he stands too high to   be in need of extenuation.\"  This is Marx's judgment; and yet it must be said that the world for the most part has found more in the \"Mount of Olives\" than he has.  The oratorio is written for three solo voices (Jesus, Peter, and a Seraph), chorus, and orchestra. The narrative opens with the agony in the garden, followed by the chant of a Seraph reciting the divine goodness and foretelling the salvation of the righteous. In the next scene Jesus learns his fate from the Seraph, yields himself to approaching death, and welcomes it. The Soldiers enter in pursuit, and a tumult ensues as the Apostles find themselves surrounded. Peter draws his sword and gives vent to his indignation; but is rebuked both by Jesus and the Seraph, and together they conjure him to be silent and endure whatever may happen. The Soldiers, discovering Jesus, rush upon him and bind him. The Disciples express their apprehension that they too will suffer; but Jesus uncomplainingly surrenders himself, and a chorus of rejoicing completes the work. From this brief sketch the artificial and distorted manner of treating the solemn subject will be evident.  The score opens with an adagio introduction for instruments which is of a very dramatic character, and, unlike nearly all of the sacred music of that time, is noticeable for the absence of the fugue. Barbedette, the great French critic, pronounces it the _chef-d'oeuvre_ of introductions, and a masterpiece in the serious style. The first number is a recitative and aria for tenor, sung by Jesus (\"All my Soul within me shudders\"), which, notwithstanding the anomaly of such a scene in such surroundings, is simple and touching in expression. The Seraph follows with a scene and aria (\"Praise the Redeemer's Goodness\"), concluding with a brilliant and jubilant obligato with chorus (\"O triumph, all ye Ransomed\"). The next number is an elaborate duet between Jesus and the Seraph (\"On me then fall Thy heavy Judgment\"), which is still more anomalous than the scene and aria with which Jesus opens the work. In a short recitative passage, Jesus welcomes death; and then ensues one of the most powerful numbers in the work, the chorus of Soldiers in march time (\"We surely here shall find Him\"), interspersed with the cries of the People demanding his death, and the lamentations of the Apostles. At the conclusion of the tumult a dialogue ensues between Jesus and Peter (\"Not unchastised shall this audacious Band\"), which leads up to the crowning anomaly of the work, a trio between Jesus, Peter, and the Seraph, with chorus (\"O, Sons of Men, with Gladness\"). The closing number, a chorus of angels (\"Hallelujah, God's Almighty Son\"), is introduced with a short but massive symphony leading to a jubilant burst of Hallelujah, which finally resolves itself into a glorious fugue, accompanied with all that wealth of instrumentation of which Beethoven was the consummate master. In all sacred music it is difficult to find a choral number which can surpass it in majesty or power.  The English versions of the \"Mount of Olives\" differ materially from the German in the text. Numerous efforts have been made to avoid the incongruity of the original narrative, but with poor success. It was first produced in England in 1814 by Sir George Smart during the Lenten oratorios at Drury Lane, the English version of which was made by Arnold, at that time manager of the King's Theatre. Still later it was produced again, and the adapter compromised by using the third person, as \"'Jehovah, Thou, O Father,' saith the Lord our Saviour.\" Two other versions were made by Thomas Oliphant and Mr. Bartholomew, but these were not successful. At last the aversion to the personal part of Jesus led to an entirely new text, called \"Engedi,\" the words of which were written by Dr. Henry Hudson, of Dublin, and founded upon the persecution of David by Saul in the wilderness, as described in parts of chapters xxiii., xxiv., and xxvi. of the first book of Samuel. The characters introduced are David, Abishai, and the Prophetess, the latter corresponding to the"]]]
