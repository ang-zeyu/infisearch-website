The                    original castle of Baynard the Norman had fallen                    into ruins at the end of the fifteenth century.                    Henry VII. built a palace on the site of it, which                    retained the name.]  The country, he said, was on the brink of civil war, and if they continued to support the pretensions of Lady Jane Grey to the crown, civil war would inevitably break out. In a few more days or weeks the child would be in arms against the {p.019} father, the brother against the brother; the quarrels of religion would add fury to the struggle; the French would interfere on one side, the Spaniards on the other, and in such a conflict the triumph of either party would be almost equally injurious to the honour, unity, freedom, and happiness of England. The friends of the commonwealth, in the face of so tremendous a danger, would not obstinately persist in encouraging the pretensions of a faction. It was for them where they sate to decide if there should be peace or war, and he implored them, for the sake of the country, to restore the crown to her who was their lawful sovereign.  Pembroke rose next. The words of Lord Arundel, he said, were true and good, and not to be gainsaid. What others thought he knew not; for himself, he was so convinced, that he would fight in the quarrel with any man; and if words are not enough, he cried, flashing his sword out of the scabbard, \"this blade shall make Mary Queen, or I will lose my life.\"[46]                     [Footnote 46: E quando le persuasioni del conte                    d'Arundel non habiano luogo appresso di voi, o                    questa spada farà Reina Maria, o perderò io la                    vita.--Baoardo.]  Not a voice was raised for the Twelfth-day Queen, as Lady Jane was termed, in scornful pity, by Noailles. Some few persons thought that, before they took a decisive step, they should send notice to Northumberland, and give him time to secure his pardon. But it was held to be a needless stretch of consideration; Shrewsbury and Mason hastened off to communicate with Renard;[47] while a hundred and fifty men were marched directly to the Tower gates, and the keys were demanded in the queen's name.                     [Footnote 47: Renard had been prepared, by a                    singular notice, to expect their coming, and to                    suspect their good faith. Ce matin, he wrote,                    relating the counter-revolution to the Emperor; ce                    matin, à bonne heure, il y a venu une vieille femme                    de soixante ans en nostre logis pour nous advertir                    que l'on deust faire sçavoir à madicte dame Marie                    qu'elle se donna garde de ceulx de conseil car its                    la vouloient tromper soubz couleur de luy monstrer                    affection.--_Granvelle Papers_, vol. iv.]  It is said that Suffolk was unprepared: but the goodness of his heart and the weakness of his mind alike saved him from attempting a useless resistance: the gates were opened, and the unhappy father rushed to his daughter's room. He clutched at the canopy under which she was sitting, and tore it down; she was no longer queen, he said, and such distinctions were not for one of her station. He then told her briefly of the revolt of the council. She replied that his present words were more welcome to her than those in which he had advised her to accept {p.020} the crown;[48] her reign being at an end, she asked innocently if she might leave the Tower and go home.[49] But the Tower was a place not easy to leave, save by one route too often travelled.                     [Footnote 48: Baoardo to Charles V.: _Rolls House                    MSS._]                     [Footnote 49: Narrative of Edward Underhill:                    _Harleian MSS._ 425.]  Meanwhile the lords, with the mayor and the heralds, went to the Cross at Cheapside to proclaim Mary Queen. Pembroke himself stood out to read; and this time there was no reason to complain of a silent audience. He could utter but one sentence before his voice was lost in the shout of joy which thundered into the air. \"God save the queen,\" \"God save the queen,\" rung out from tens of thousands of throats. \"God save the queen,\" cried Pembroke himself, when he had done, and flung up his jewelled cap and tossed his purse among the crowd. The glad news spread like lightning through London, and the pent-up hearts of the citizens poured themselves out in a torrent of exultation. Above the human cries, the long-silent church-bells clashed again into life; first began St. Paul's, where happy chance had saved them from destruction; then, one by one, every peal which had been spared caught up the sound; and through the summer evening and the summer night, and all the next day, the metal tongues from tower and steeple gave voice to England's gladness. The lords, surrounded by the shouting multitude, walked in state to St. Paul's, where the choir again sang a Te Deum, and the unused organ rolled out once more its mighty volume of music. As they came out again, at the close of the service, the apprentices were heaping piles of wood for bonfires at the cross-ways. The citizens were spreading tables in the streets, which their wives were loading with fattest capons and choicest wines; there was free feasting for all comers; and social jealousies, religious hatreds, were forgotten for the moment in the ecstasy of the common delight. Even the retainers of the Dudleys, in fear or joy, tore their badges out of their caps, and trampled on them.[50]                     [Footnote 50: Renard to Charles V.: _Rolls House                    MSS._ All authorities agree in the general                    description of the state of London. Renard,                    Noailles, and Baoardo are the most explicit and                    interesting.]  At a night session of the council, a letter was written to Northumberland, which Cranmer, Suffolk, and Sir John Cheke consented to sign, ordering him in the name of Queen Mary to lay down his arms. If he complied, the lords undertook to intercede for his pardon. If he refused, they said that they {p.021} would hold him as a traitor, and spend their lives in the field against him.[51]                     [Footnote 51: This letter is among the _Tanner                    MSS._ in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. It was                    printed by Stowe.]  While a pursuivant bore the commands of the council to the duke, Arundel and Paget undertook to carry to Mary at Framlingham their petition for forgiveness, in which they declared that they had been innocent at heart of any share in the conspiracy,[52] and had only delayed coming forward in her favour from a desire to prevent bloodshed.                     [Footnote 52: \"Our bounden duties most humbly                    remembered to your excellent Majesty. It may like                    the same to understand, that we, your most humble,                    faithful, and obedient subjects, having always, God                    we take to witness, remained your Highness's true                    and humble subjects in our hearts, ever since the                    death of our late Sovereign Lord and master your                    Highness's brother, whom God pardon, and seeing                    hitherto no possibility to utter our determination                    without great destruction and bloodshed, both of                    ourselves and others, till this time, have this day                    proclaimed in your city of London your Majesty to                    be our true natural sovereign liege Lady and Queen;                    most humbly beseeching your Majesty to pardon and                    remit our former infirmities, and most graciously                    to accept our meanings, which have been ever to                    serve your Highness truly, and so shall remain with                    all our power and force, to the effusion of our                    blood, as these bearers, our very good Lords, the                    Earls of Arundel and Paget, can, and be ready more                    particularly to declare--to whom it may please your                    excellent Majesty to give firm credence; and thus                    we do and shall daily pray to Almighty God for the                    preservation of your most royal person long to                    reign over us.\"--_Lansdowne MSS._ 3. Endorsed, in                    Cecil's hand, \"Copy of the Letter of the Lords to                    the Queen Mary from Baynard's Castle.\" The                    signatures are, unfortunately, wanting.]  The two lords immediately mounted and galloped off into the darkness, followed by thirty horse, leaving the lights of illuminated London gleaming behind them.  The duke's position was already desperate: on the 18th, before the proclamation in London, Mary had felt herself strong enough to send orders to the Mayor of Cambridge for his arrest;[53] and, although he had as yet been personally unmolested, he was powerless in the midst of an army which was virtually in Mary's service. The news of the revolution in London first reached him by a private hand. He at once sent for Sandys, and, going with him to the market cross, he declared, after one violent clutch at his beard, that he had acted under orders from the council; the council, he understood, had changed their minds, and he would change his mind also; therefore he cried, \"God save Queen Mary,\" and with a strained effort at a show of satisfaction, he, too, like Pembroke, threw up his cap. The queen, he said to Sandys, was a merciful woman, and there would be a general"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22546"],["title","The Reign of Mary Tudor (#8)"],["body",". \"Though the queen grant you a {p.022} pardon,\" Sandys answered, \"the lords never will; you can hope nothing from those who now rule.\"[54]                     [Footnote 53: Renard to Charles V.: _Rolls House                    MSS._]                     [Footnote 54: Foxe, vol. viii.]  It was true that he could hope nothing--the hatred of the whole nation, which before his late treasons he had brought upon himself, would clamour to the very heavens for judgment against him. An hour after the proclamation of Mary (July 20), Rouge-cross herald arrived with the lords' letter from London. An order at the same time was read to the troops informing them that they were no longer under the duke's command, and an alderman of the town then ventured to execute the queen's warrant for his arrest. Northumberland was given in charge to a guard of his own soldiers; he protested, however, that the council had sent no instructions for his detention; and in some uncertainty, or perhaps in compassion for his fate, the soldiers obeyed him once more, and let him go. It was then night. He intended to fly; but he put it off till the morning, and in the morning his chance was gone. Before he could leave his room he found himself face to face with Arundel, who, after delivering the council's letter to the queen, had hastened to Cambridge to secure him.  Northumberland, who, while innocent of crime, had faced death on land and sea like a soldier and a gentleman, flung himself at the earl's feet. \"Be good to me, for the love of God,\" he cried; \"consider I have done nothing but by the consent of you and the council.\" He knew what kind of consent he had extorted from the council. \"My lord,\" said Arundel, \"I am sent thither by the Queen's Majesty; and in her name I do arrest you.\"--\"I obey, my lord,\" the duke replied; \"yet show me mercy, knowing the case as it is.\"--\"My lord,\" was the cold answer, \"you should have sought for mercy sooner; I must do according to my commandment.\"[55]                     [Footnote 55: Holinshed.]  At the same moment Sandys was paying the penalty for his sermon. The university, in haste to purge itself of its heretical elements, met soon after sunrise to depose their vice-chancellor. Dr. Sandys, who had gone for an early stroll among the meadows to meditate on his position, hearing the congregation-bell ringing, resolved, like a brave man, to front his fortune; he walked to the senate-house, entered, and took his seat. \"A rabble of Papists\" instantly surrounded him. He tried to speak, but the masters of arts shouted \"Traitor;\" rough hands shook or dragged him from his chair: and the impatient theologian, in sudden heat, drew his dagger, and \"would have done a mischief {p.023} with it,\" had not some of his friends disarmed him.[56] He, too, was handed over to a guard, lashed to the back of a lame horse, and carried to London.                     [Footnote 56: Foxe, vol. viii. pp. 591-2.]  Mary, meanwhile, notwithstanding the revolution in her favour, remained a few more days at Framlingham, either suspicious of treachery or uncertain whether there might not be another change. But she was assured rapidly that the danger was at an end by the haste with which the lords and gentlemen who were compromised sought their pardon at her feet. On the 21st and 22nd Clinton, Grey, Fitzgerald, Ormond, Fitzwarren, Sir Henry Sidney, and Sir James Crofts presented themselves and received forgiveness. Cecil wrote, explaining his secret services, and was taken into favour. Lord Robert and Lord Ambrose Dudley, Northampton and a hundred other gentlemen--Sir Thomas Wyatt among them--who had accompanied the duke to Bury, were not so fortunate. The queen would not see them, and they were left under arrest. Ridley set out for Norfolk, also, to confess his offences; but, before he arrived at the court, he was met by a warrant for his capture, and carried back a prisoner to the Tower.  The conspiracy was crushed, and crushed, happily, without bloodshed. The inquiry into its origin, and the punishment of the guilty, could be carried out at leisure. There was one matter, however, which admitted of no delay. Mary's first anxiety, on feeling her crown secure, was the burial of her dead brother, who, through all these scenes, was still lying in his bed in his room at Greenwich. In her first letter to the Imperial ambassadors, the day after the arrival of Arundel and Paget at the court, she spoke of this as her greatest care; to their infinite alarm, she announced her intention of inaugurating her reign with Requiem and Dirige, and a mass for the repose of his soul.  Their uneasiness requires explanation.  While on matters of religion there was in England almost every variety of opinion, there was a very general consent that the queen should not marry a foreigner. The dread that Mary might form a connection with some continental prince, had formed the strongest element in Northumberland's cause; all the Catholics, except the insignificant faction who desired the restoration of the Papal authority,[57] all the moderate Protestants, {p.024} wished well to her, but wished to see her married to some English nobleman; and, while her accession was still uncertain, the general opinion had already fixed upon a husband for her in the person of her cousin Edward Courtenay, the imprisoned son of the Marquis of Exeter. The interest of the public in the long confinement of this young nobleman had invested him with all imaginary graces of mind and body. He was the grandchild of a Plantagenet, and a representative of the White Rose. He had suffered from the tyranny, and was supposed to have narrowly escaped murder at the hands of the man whom all England most hated. Nature, birth, circumstances, all seemed to point to him as the king-consort of the realm.[58] The emperor had thought of Mary for his son; and it has been seen that the fear of such an alliance induced the French to support Northumberland. To prevent the injury which the report, if credited in England, would have done to her cause, Mary, on her first flight to Keninghal, empowered Renard to assure the council that she had no thought at all of marrying a stranger. The emperor and the bishop of Arras, in assuring Sir Philip Hoby that the French intended to strike for the Queen of Scots, declared that, for themselves they wished only to see the queen settled in her own realm, as her subjects desired; and especially they would prevent her either from attempting innovations in religion without their consent, or from marrying against their approbation.[59]                     [Footnote 57: I must again remind my readers of the                    distinction between Catholic and Papist.                    Three-quarters of the English people were                    Catholics; that is, they were attached to the                    hereditary and traditionary doctrines of the                    Church. They detested, as cordially as the                    Protestants, the interference of a foreign power,                    whether secular or spiritual, with English                    liberty.]                     [Footnote 58: \"Adversity is a good thing. I trust                    in the Lord to live to see the day her Grace to                    marry such an one as knoweth what adversity                    meaneth; so shall we have both a merciful queen and                    king to their subjects; and would to God I might                    live to have another virtuous Edward.\"--Epistle of                    Poor Pratt to Gilbert Potter, written July 13:                    _Queen Jane and Queen Mary_, Appendix, p. 116. The                    occasion of this curious epistle was the punishment                    of Gilbert on the pillory. The writer was a                    Protestant, and evidently thought the Reformation                    in greater danger from Northumberland than Mary.                    \"We have had many prophets and true preachers,\" he                    said, \"which did declare that our king shall be                    taken away from us, and a tyrant shall reign. The                    gospel shall be plucked away, and the right heir                    shall be dispossessed; and all for our                    unthankfulness. And, thinkest thou not, Gilbert,                    this world is now come? Yea! truly! and what shall                    follow, if we repent not in time? The same God will                    take from us the virtuous Lady Mary our lawful                    Queen, and send such a cruel Pharaoh as the Ragged                    Bear to rule us, which shall pull and poll us, and                    utterly destroy us, and bring us in great                    calamities and miseries.\"]                     [Footnote 59: _MS. Harleian_, 523.]  But the emperor's disinterestedness was only the result of his despondency. While the crisis lasted, neither Charles nor Henry of France saw their way to a distinct course of action. Charles, on the 20th of July, ignorant of the events in London, {p.025} had written to Renard, despairing of Mary's success. Jane Grey he would not recognise; the Queen of Scots, he thought, would shortly be on the English throne. Henry, considering, at any rate, that he might catch something in troubled waters, volunteered to Lord William Howard,[60] in professed compliance with the demands of Northumberland, to garrison Guisnes and Calais for him. Howard replied that the French might come to Calais if they desired, but their reception might not be to their taste.[61] The revolution of the 19th altered the aspect of the situation both at the courts of Paris and of Brussels. The accession of Mary would be no injury to France, provided she could be married in England; and Henry at once instructed Noailles to congratulate the council on her accession. Noailles himself indeed considered, that, should she take Courtenay for a husband, the"]]]
