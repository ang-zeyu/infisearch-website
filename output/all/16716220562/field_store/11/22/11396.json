But Geolog<ists> show change in configuration which, together with the accidents of air and water and the means of transportal which every being possesses, must occasionally bring, rather suddenly, organism to new conditions and <?> expose it for several generations. Hence <?> we should expect every now and then a wild form to vary{49}; possibly this may be cause of some species varying more than others.       {49} When the author wrote this sketch he seems not to have been so      fully convinced of the general occurrence of variation in nature as      he afterwards became. The above passage in the text possibly      suggests that at this time he laid more stress on _sports_ or      _mutations_ than was afterwards the case.  According to nature of new conditions, so we might expect all or majority of organisms born under them to vary in some definite way. Further we might expect that the mould in which they are cast would likewise vary in some small degree. But is there any means of selecting those offspring which vary in the same manner, crossing them and keeping their offspring separate and thus producing selected races: otherwise as the wild animals freely cross, so must such small heterogeneous varieties be constantly counter-balanced and lost, and a uniformity of character [kept up] preserved. The former variation as the direct and necessary effects of causes, which we can see can act on them, as size of body from amount of food, effect of certain kinds of food on certain parts of bodies &c. &c.; such new varieties may then become adapted to those external [natural] agencies which act on them. But can varieties be produced adapted to end, which cannot possibly influence their structure and which it is absurd to look <at> as effects of chance. Can varieties like some vars of domesticated animals, like almost all wild species be produced adapted by exquisite means to prey on one animal or to escape from another,--or rather, as it puts out of question effects of intelligence and habits, can a plant become adapted to animals, as a plant which cannot be impregnated without agency of insect; or hooked seeds depending on animal's existence: woolly animals cannot have any direct effect on seeds of plant. This point which all theories about climate adapting woodpecker{50} to crawl <?> up trees, <illegible> miseltoe, <sentence incomplete>. But if every part of a plant or animal was to vary <illegible>, and if a being infinitely more sagacious than man (not an omniscient creator) during thousands and thousands of years were to select all the variations which tended towards certain ends ([or were to produce causes <?> which tended to the same end]), for instance, if he foresaw a canine animal would be better off, owing to the country producing more hares, if he were longer legged and keener sight,--greyhound produced{51}. If he saw that aquatic <animal would need> skinned toes. If for some unknown cause he found it would advantage a plant, which <?> like most plants is occasionally visited by bees &c.: if that plant's seed were occasionally eaten by birds and were then carried on to rotten trees, he might select trees with fruit more agreeable to such birds as perched, to ensure their being carried to trees; if he perceived those birds more often dropped the seeds, he might well have selected a bird who would <illegible> rotten trees or [gradually select plants which <he> had proved to live on less and less rotten trees]. Who, seeing how plants vary in garden, what blind foolish man has done{52} in a few years, will deny an all-seeing being in thousands of years could effect (if the Creator chose to do so), either by his own direct foresight or by intermediate means,--which will represent <?> the creator of this universe. Seems usual means. Be it remembered I have nothing to say about life and mind and _all_ forms descending from one common type{53}. I speak of the variation of the existing great divisions of the organised kingdom, how far I would go, hereafter to be seen.       {50} The author may possibly have taken the case of the woodpecker      from Buffon, _Histoire Nat. des Oiseaux_, T. vii. p. 3, 1780, where      however it is treated from a different point of view. He uses it      more than once, see for instance _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 3, 60, 184,      vi. pp. 3, 76, 220. The passage in the text corresponds with a      discussion on the woodpecker and the mistletoe in _Origin_, Ed. i.      p. 3, vi. p. 3.       {51} This illustration occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 90, 91,      vi. pp. 110, 111.       {52} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 83, vi. p. 102, where the word      _Creator_ is replaced by _Nature_.       {53} Note in the original. \"Good place to introduce, saying reasons      hereafter to be given, how far I extend theory, say to all      mammalia--reasons growing weaker and weaker.\"  Before considering whether <there> be any natural means of selection, and secondly (which forms the 2nd Part of this sketch) the far more important point whether the characters and relations of animated <things> are such as favour the idea of wild species being races <?> descended from a common stock, as the varieties of potato or dahlia or cattle having so descended, let us consider probable character of [selected races] wild varieties.  _Natural Selection._ De Candolle's war of nature,--seeing contented face of nature,--may be well at first doubted; we see it on borders of perpetual cold{54}. But considering the enormous geometrical power of increase in every organism and as <?> every country, in ordinary cases <countries> must be stocked to full extent, reflection will show that this is the case. Malthus on man,--in animals no moral [check] restraint <?>--they breed in time of year when provision most abundant, or season most favourable, every country has its seasons,--calculate robins,--oscillating from years of destruction{55}. If proof were wanted let any singular change of climate <occur> here <?>, how astoundingly some tribes <?> increase, also introduced animals{56}, the pressure is always ready,--capacity of alpine plants to endure other climates,--think of endless seeds scattered abroad,--forests regaining their percentage{57},--a thousand wedges{58} are being forced into the oeconomy of nature. This requires much reflection; study Malthus and calculate rates of increase and remember the resistance,--only periodical.       {54} See _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 62, 63, vi. p. 77, where similar      reference is made to De Candolle; for Malthus see _Origin_, p. 5.       {55} This may possibly refer to the amount of destruction going on.      See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 68, vi. p. 84, where there is an estimate      of a later date as to death-rate of birds in winter. \"Calculate      robins\" probably refers to a calculation of the rate of increase of      birds under favourable conditions.       {56} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 64, 65, vi. p. 80, he instances      cattle and horses and certain plants in S. America and American      species of plants in India, and further on, as unexpected effects      of changed conditions, the enclosure of a heath, and the relation      between the fertilisation of clover and the presence of cats      (_Origin_, Ed. i. p. 74, vi. p. 91).       {57} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 74, vi. p. 91. \"It has been observed that      the trees now growing on ... ancient Indian mounds ... display the      same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the      surrounding virgin forests.\"       {58} The simile of the wedge occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 67;      it is deleted in Darwin's copy of the first edition: it does not      occur in Ed. vi.  The unavoidable effect of this <is> that many of every species are destroyed either in egg or [young or mature (the former state the more common)]. In the course of a thousand generations infinitesimally small differences must inevitably tell{59}; when unusually cold winter, or hot or dry summer comes, then out of the whole body of individuals of any species, if there be the smallest differences in their structure, habits, instincts [senses], health &c, <it> will on an average tell; as conditions change a rather larger proportion will be preserved: so if the chief check to increase falls on seeds or eggs, so will, in the course of 1000 generations or ten thousand, those seeds (like one with down to fly{60}) which fly furthest and get scattered most ultimately rear most plants, and such small differences tend to be hereditary like shades of expression in human countenance. So if one parent <?> fish deposits its egg in infinitesimally different circumstances, as in rather shallower or deeper water &c., it will then <?> tell.       {59} In a rough summary at the close of the Essay, occur the      words:--\"Every creature lives by a struggle, smallest grain in      balance must tell.\"       {60} Cf. _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 77, vi. p. 94.  Let hares{61} increase very slowly from change of climate affecting peculiar plants, and some other <illegible> rabbit decrease in same proportion [let this unsettle organisation of], a canine animal, who formerly derived its chief sustenance by springing on rabbits or running them by scent, must decrease too and might thus readily become exterminated. But if its form varied very slightly, the long legged fleet ones, during a thousand years being selected, and the less fleet rigidly destroyed must, if no law of nature be opposed to it, alter forms.       {61} This is a repetition of what is given at p. 6.  Remember how soon Bakewell on the same principle altered cattle and Western, sheep,--carefully avoiding a cross (pigeons) with any breed. We cannot suppose that one plant tends to vary in fruit and another in flower, and another in flower and foliage,--some have been selected for both fruit and flower: that one animal varies in its covering and another not,--another in its"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22728"],["title","The Foundations of the Origin of Species (#6)"],["body","k. Take any organism and ask what is it useful for and on that point it will be found to vary,--cabbages in their leaf,--corn in size <and> quality of grain, both in times of year,--kidney beans for young pod and cotton for envelope of seeds &c. &c.: dogs in intellect, courage, fleetness and smell <?>: pigeons in peculiarities approaching to monsters. This requires consideration,--should be introduced in first chapter if it holds, I believe it does. It is hypothetical at best{62}.       {62} Compare _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 41, vi. p. 47. \"I have seen it      gravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry      began to vary just when gardeners began to attend closely to this      plant. No doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was      cultivated, but the slight varieties had been neglected.\"  Nature's variation far less, but such selection far more rigid and scrutinising. Man's races not [even so well] only not better adapted to conditions than other races, but often not <?> one race adapted to its conditions, as man keeps and propagates some alpine plants in garden. Nature lets <an> animal live, till on actual proof it is found less able to do the required work to serve the desired end, man judges solely by his eye, and knows not whether nerves, muscles, arteries, are developed in proportion to the change of external form.  Besides selection by death, in bisexual animals <illegible> the selection in time of fullest vigour, namely struggle of males; even in animals which pair there seems a surplus <?> and a battle, possibly as in man more males produced than females, struggle of war or charms{63}. Hence that male which at that time is in fullest vigour, or best armed with arms or ornaments of its species, will gain in hundreds of generations some small advantage and transmit such characters to its offspring. So in female rearing its young, the most vigorous and skilful and industrious, <whose> instincts <are> best developed, will rear more young, probably possessing her good qualities, and a greater number will thus <be> prepared for the struggle of nature. Compared to man using a male alone of good breed. This latter section only of limited application, applies to variation of [specific] sexual characters. Introduce here contrast with Lamarck,--absurdity of habit, or chance?? or external conditions, making a woodpecker adapted to tree{64}.       {63} Here we have the two types of sexual selection discussed in      the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 88 et seq., vi. pp. 108 et seq.       {64} It is not obvious why the author objects to \"chance\" or      \"external conditions making a woodpecker.\" He allows that variation      is ultimately referable to conditions and that the nature of the      connexion is unknown, i.e. that the result is fortuitous. It is not      clear in the original to how much of the passage the two ? refer.  Before considering difficulties of theory of selection let us consider character of the races produced, as now explained, by nature. Conditions have varied slowly and the organisms best adapted in their whole course of life to the changed conditions have always been selected,--man selects small dog and afterwards gives it profusion of food,--selects a long-backed and short-legged breed and gives it no particular exercise to suit this function &c. &c. In ordinary cases nature has not allowed her race to be contaminated with a cross of another race, and agriculturists know how difficult they find always to prevent this,--effect would be trueness. This character and sterility when crossed, and generally a greater amount of difference, are two main features, which distinguish domestic races from species.  [Sterility not universal admitted by all{65}. _Gladiolus_, _Crinum_, _Calceolaria_{66} must be species if there be such a thing. Races of dogs and oxen: but certainly very general; indeed a gradation of sterility most perfect{67} very general. Some nearest species will not cross (crocus, some heath <?>), some genera cross readily (fowls{68} and grouse, peacock &c.). Hybrids no ways monstrous quite perfect except secretions{69} hence even the mule has bred,--character of sterility, especially a few years ago <?> thought very much more universal than it now is, has been thought the distinguishing character; indeed it is obvious if all forms freely crossed, nature would be a chaos. But the very gradation of the character, even if it always existed in some degree which it does not, renders it impossible as marks <?> those <?> suppose distinct as species{70}]. Will analogy throw any light on the fact of the supposed races of nature being sterile, though none of the domestic ones are? Mr Herbert <and> Koelreuter have shown external differences will not guide one in knowing whether hybrids will be fertile or not, but the chief circumstance is constitutional differences{71}, such as being adapted to different climate or soil, differences which [must] probably affect the whole body of the organism and not any one part. Now wild animals, taken out of their natural conditions, seldom breed. I do not refer to shows or to Zoological Societies where many animals unite, but <do not?> breed, and others will never unite, but to wild animals caught and kept _quite tame_ left loose and well fed about houses and living many years. Hybrids produced almost as readily as pure breds. St Hilaire great distinction of tame and domestic,--elephants,--ferrets{72}. Reproductive organs not subject to disease in Zoological Garden. Dissection and microscope show that hybrid is in exactly same condition as another animal in the intervals of breeding season, or those animals which taken wild and _not bred_ in domesticity, remain without breeding their whole lives. It should be observed that so far from domesticity being unfavourable in itself <it> makes more fertile: [when animal is domesticated and breeds, productive power increased from more food and selection of fertile races]. As far as animals go might be thought <an> effect on their mind and a special case.       {65} The meaning is \"That sterility is not universal is admitted by      all.\"       {66} See _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, i. p. 388, where the garden      forms of _Gladiolus_ and _Calceolaria_ are said to be derived from      crosses between distinct species. Herbert's hybrid _Crinums_ are      discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 250, vi. p. 370. It is well      known that the author believed in a multiple origin of domestic      dogs.       {67} The argument from gradation in sterility is given in the      _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 248, 255, vi. pp. 368, 375. In the _Origin_, I      have not come across the cases mentioned, viz. crocus, heath, or      grouse and fowl or peacock. For sterility between closely allied      species, see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 257, vi. p. 377. In the present      essay the author does not distinguish between fertility between      species and the fertility of the hybrid offspring, a point on which      he insists in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 245, vi. p. 365.       {68} Ackermann (_Ber. d. Vereins f. Naturkunde zu Kassel_, 1898, p.      23) quotes from Gloger that a cross has been effected between a      domestic hen and a _Tetrao tetrix_; the offspring died when three      days old.       {69} No doubt the sexual cells are meant. I do not know on what      evidence it is stated that the mule has bred.       {70} The sentence is all but illegible. I think that the author      refers to forms usually ranked as varieties having been marked as      species when it was found that they were sterile together. See the      case of the red and blue _Anagallis_ given from Gärtner in the      _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 247, vi. p. 368.       {71} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 258, where the author speaks of      constitutional differences in this connexion, he specifies that      they are confined to the reproductive system.       {72} The sensitiveness of the reproductive system to changed      conditions is insisted on in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 8, vi. p. 10.       The ferret is mentioned, as being prolific in captivity, in _Var.      under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p. 90.  But turning to plants we find same class of facts. I do not refer to seeds not ripening, perhaps the commonest cause, but to plants not setting, which either is owing to some imperfection of ovule or pollen. Lindley says sterility is the [curse] bane of all propagators,--Linnæus about alpine plants. American bog plants,--pollen in exactly same state as in hybrids,--same in geraniums. Persian and Chinese{73} lilac will not seed in Italy and England. Probably double plants and all fruits owe their developed parts primarily <?> to sterility and extra food thus <?> applied{74}. There is here gradation <in> sterility and then parts, like diseases, are transmitted hereditarily. We cannot assign any cause why the Pontic Azalea produces plenty of pollen and not American{75}, why common lilac seeds and not Persian, we see no difference in healthiness. We know not on what circumstances these facts depend, why ferret breeds, and cheetah{76}, elephant and pig in India will not.       {73} Lindley's remark is quoted in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 9.      Linnæus' remark is to the effect that Alpine plants tend to be      sterile under cultivation (see _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p.      147). In the same place the author speaks of peat-loving plants      being sterile in our gardens,--no doubt the American bog-plants      referred to above. On the following page (p. 148) the sterility of      the lilac (_Syringa persica_ and _chinensis_) is referred to.       {74} The author probably means that the increase in the petals is      due to a greater food supply being available for them owing to      sterility. See the discussion in _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p.      151. It must be noted that doubleness of the flower may exist      without noticeable sterility.       {75} I have not come across"]]]
