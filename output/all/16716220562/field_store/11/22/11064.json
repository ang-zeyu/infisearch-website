On the day that I was called up charged with fighting, the Splash--for that was the suggestive name I had chosen for my trim little craft--was lying at the boat pier on the lake in front of the Institute building. The forenoon session of the school had just closed, and I had gone to the boat to eat my dinner, which I always carried in the stern locker.  Before I had finished, Bill Poodles came down with an Arithmetic in his hand. It was the dinner hour of the boarding students, and I wondered that Bill was not in the refectory. Our class had a difficult lesson in arithmetic that day, which I had worked out in the solitude of my chamber at the cottage the preceding evening. The students had been prohibited, under the most severe penalty, from assisting each other; and it appeared that Bill had vainly applied to half a dozen of his classmates for help: none of them dared to afford it.  Bill Poodles was a disagreeable fellow, arrogant and \"airy\" as he was lazy and stupid. I doubt whether he ever learned a difficult task alone. The arithmetic lesson was a review of the principles which the class had gone over, and consisted of a dozen examples, printed on a slip of paper, to test the knowledge of the students; and it was intimated that those who failed would be sent down into a lower class. Bill dreaded anything like a degradation. He was proud, if he was lazy. He knew that I had performed the examples, and while his fellow-boarders were at dinner, he had stolen the opportunity to appeal to me for the assistance he so much needed.  Though Bill was a disagreeable fellow, and though, in common with a majority of the students, I disliked him, I would willingly have assisted him if the prohibition to do so had not been so emphatic. Mr. Parasyte was so particular in the present instance, that the following declaration had been printed on the examination paper, and each boy was required to sign it:--  _\"I declare upon my honor, that I have had no assistance whatever in solving these examples, and that I have given none to others.\"_  Bill begged me to assist him. I reasoned with him, and told him he had better fail in the review than forfeit his honor by subscribing to a falsehood. He made light of my scruples; and then I told him I had already signed my own paper, and would not falsify my statement.  \"Humph!\" exclaimed he, with a sneer. \"You hadn't given any one assistance when you signed, but you can do it now, and it will be no lie.\"  I was indignant at the proposition, it was so mean and base; and I expressed myself squarely in regard to it. I had finished my dinner, and, closing the locker, stepped out of the boat upon the pier. Bill followed me, begging and pleading till I was disgusted with him. I told him then that I would not do what he asked if he teased me for a month. He was angry, and used insulting language. I turned on my heel to leave him. He interpreted this movement on my part as an act of cowardice, and, coming up behind me, struck me a heavy blow on the back of the head with his fist. He was on the point of following it up with another, when, though he was eighteen years old, and half a foot taller than I was, I hit him fairly in the eye, and knocked him over backwards, off the pier, and into the lake.  A madder fellow than Bill Poodles never floundered in shallow water. The lake where he fell was not more than two or three feet deep, and doubtless its soft bosom saved him from severe injury. He picked himself up, and, dripping from his bath, rushed to the shore. He was insane with passion. Seizing a large stone, he hurled it at me. I moved towards him, with the intention of checking his demonstration, when his valor was swallowed up in discretion, and he rushed towards the school building.  For this offence I was brought to the bar of Mr. Parasyte's uneven justice. Poodles had told his own story after changing his drabbled garments. It was unfortunate that there were no witnesses of the affray, for the principal would sooner have doubted the evidence of his own senses than the word of Bill Poodles, simply because it was not politic for him to do so. My accuser declared that he had spoken civilly and properly to me, and that I had insulted him. He had walked up to me, and placed his hand upon my shoulder, simply to attract my attention, when I had struck him a severe blow in the face, which had knocked him over backwards into the lake.  In answer to this charge, I told the truth exactly as it was. Bill acknowledged that he had asked me some questions about the review lesson, which I had declined to answer. He was sorry he had offended so far, but was not angry at my refusal. He had determined to sacrifice his dinner, and his play during the intermission, to enable him to perform the examples. I persisted in the statement I had already made, and refused to modify it in any manner. It was the simple truth.  \"Ernest Thornton,\" said Mr. Parasyte, solemnly, \"hitherto I have regarded you with favor. I have looked upon you as a worthy and deserving boy, and I confess my surprise and grief at the event of to-day. Not content with the dastardly assault committed upon William Poodles,--whose devotion to his duty and his studies has been manifested by the sacrifice of his dinner,--you utter the most barefaced falsehood which it was ever my misfortune to hear a boy tell.\"  \"I have told the truth, sir!\" I exclaimed, my cheek burning with indignation.  \"Silence, sir! Such conduct and such a boy cannot be tolerated at the Parkville Liberal Institute. But in consideration of your former good conduct, I purpose to give you an opportunity to redeem your character.\"  \"My character don't need any redeeming,\" I declared, stoutly.  \"I see you are in a very unhappy frame of mind, and I fear you are incorrigible. But I must do my duty, and I proceed to pronounce your sentence, which is, that you be expelled from the Parkville Liberal Institute.\"  \"Bill Poodles is the biggest liar in the school!\" shouted a daring little fellow among my friends, who were astounded at the result of the examination, and at the sentence.  \"That's so!\" said another.  \"Yes!\" \"Yes!\" \"Yes!\" shouted a dozen more. \"Throw him over! Bill Poodles is the liar!\"  Mr. Parasyte was appalled at this demonstration--a demonstration which never could have occurred without the provocation of the grossest injustice. The boys were well disciplined, and the order of the Institute was generally unexceptionable. Such a flurry had never before been known, and it was evident that the students intended to take the law into their own hands. They acted upon the impulse of the moment, and I judged that at least one half of them were engaged in the demonstration.  Poodles was a boy of no principle; he was notorious as a liar; and the boys regarded it as an outrage upon themselves and upon me that he should be believed, while my story appeared to have no weight whatever.  Mr. Parasyte trembled, not alone with rage, but with fear. The startling event then transpiring threatened the peace, if not the very existence, of the Parkville Liberal Institute. I folded my arms,--for I felt my dignity,--and endeavored to be calm, though my bosom heaved and bounded with emotion.  \"Boys--young gentlemen, I--\" the principal began.  \"Throw him over! Put him out!\" yelled the students, excited beyond measure.  \"Young gentlemen!\" shouted Mr. Parasyte.  \"Three cheers for Ernest Thornton!\" hoarsely screamed Bob Hale, my intimate friend and longtime \"crony.\"  They were given with an enthusiasm which bordered on infatuation.  \"Will you hear me, students?\" cried Mr. Parasyte.  \"No!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"Throw him over!\" \"Put him out!\"  The scene was almost as unpleasant to me as to the principal, proud as I was of the devotion of my friends. I did not wish to be vindicated in such a way, and I was anxious to put a stop to such disorderly proceedings. I raised my hand in an appealing gesture.  \"Fellow-students,\" said I; and the school-room was quiet.     CHAPTER III.  IN WHICH ERNEST IS EXPELLED FROM THE PARKVILLE LIBERAL INSTITUTE.   \"Fellow-students,\" I continued, when the school-room was still enough for me to be heard, \"I am willing to submit to the rules of the Institute, and even to the injustice of the principal. For my sake, as well as for your own, behave like men.\"  I folded my arms, and was silent again. I felt that it was better to suffer than to resist, and such an exhibition of rowdyism was not to my taste. I glanced at Mr. Parasyte, to intimate to him that he could say what he pleased; and he took the hint.  \"Young gentlemen, this is a new experience to me. In twenty years as a teacher, I have never been thus insulted.\"  This was an imprudent remark.  \"Be fair, then!\" shouted Bob Hale; and the cry was repeated by others, until the scene of disorder promised to be renewed.  I raised my hand, and shook my head, deprecating the conduct of the boys. Once more they heeded, though it was evidently as a particular favor to me, rather than because it was in keeping with their ideas of right and justice.  \"I intend to be fair, young gentlemen,\" continued Mr. Parasyte; \"that is the whole study of my life. I am astonished and mortified at this unlooked-for demonstration. I was about to make a further statement in regard to Thornton, when you interrupted me. I told you that I purposed to give him an opportunity to redeem his character. I intend to do my duty on this painful occasion, though the walls of the Parkville Liberal Institute should crumble above my head, and crush me in the dust.\"  \"Let her crumble!\" said a reckless youth, as Mr. Parasyte waxed eloquent.  \"Will you be silent, or will you compel me to resort to that which I abhor--to physical force?\"  Some of the boys glanced at each other with a meaning smile when this remark was uttered; but I shook my head, to signify my disapprobation of anything like resistance or tumult.  \"Thornton,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22433"],["title","Breaking Away; or, The Fortunes of a Student (#3)"],["body"," Mr. Parasyte, turning to me, \"I have fairly and impartially heard your story, and carefully weighed all your statements. I have come to the conclusion, deliberately and without prejudice, that you were the aggressor.\"  \"I was not, sir,\" I replied, as gently as I could speak, and yet as firmly.  \"It appears that Poodles placed his hand upon your arm merely to attract your attention; whereupon you struck him a severe blow in the face, which caused him to reel and fall over backward into the lake,\" said Mr. Parasyte, so pompously that I could not tell whether he intended to \"back out\" of his position or not.  \"Poodles hit me in the head, and was on the point of repeating the blow, when I knocked him over in self-defence.\"  \"It does not appear to me that Poodles, who is a remarkably gentlemanly student, would have struck you for simply refusing to assist him about his examples. Such a course would not be consistent with the character of Poodles.\"  \"No, sir, I did not strike him at any time,\" protested Poodles.  \"I find it impossible to change my opinion of the merits of this case; and for the good of the Parkville Liberal Institute, I must adhere to the sentence I have already--with regret and sorrow--pronounced upon you. But--\"  There were again strong signs of another outbreak among the pupils, and I begged them to be silent.  \"The conduct of Thornton in this painful emergency merits and receives my approbation. His love of order and his efforts to preserve proper decorum in the school-room are worthy of the highest commendation,\" continued Mr. Parasyte; \"and I would gladly remit the penalty I have imposed upon him without any conditions whatever; but I feel that such a course, after the extraordinary events of this day, would be subversive of the discipline and good order which have ever characterized the Parkville Liberal Institute. I shall, however, impose a merely nominal condition upon Thornton, his compliance with which shall immediately restore him to the full enjoyment of his rights and privileges as a member of this academy. I wish to be as lenient as possible, and, as I observed, the penalty will be merely nominal.  \"As the quarrel occurred when the parties were alone, so also may the reparation be made in private; for after Thornton's magnanimous behavior to-day, under these trying circumstances, I do not wish to humiliate or mortify him. I wish that it were consistent with my ideas of stern duty to impose no penalty.\"  Mr. Parasyte had certainly retreated a long way from his original position. I did not wish to be expelled, and I hailed with satisfaction his manifestation of leniency; and rather than lose the advantages of the school, I was willing to submit to the nominal penalty at which he hinted, supposing it would be a deprivation of some privilege.  \"I have not resisted your authority, sir; and I do not mean to do so now,\" I replied, submissively; for, as the popular sentiment of the students sustained me, I could afford to yield.  \"Your conduct since the quarrel is entirely satisfactory; I may say that it merits my admiration.\" This was toadying to the boys, whom he feared. \"I have sentenced you to expulsion, the severest penalty known in the discipline of the Parkville Liberal Institute; but, Thornton, I propose to remit this penalty altogether on condition that, in private, and at your own convenience, but within one week, you apologize to Poodles for your conduct. I could not make the condition any milder, I think.\"  Mr. Parasyte smiled as though he had entirely forgiven me; as though he had, in some mysterious manner, wiped out the stains of falsehood upon my character. I bowed, but made no reply. I was sentenced to expulsion; but the penalty was to be remitted on condition that I would apologize to Poodles.  Apologize to Poodles! For what? For his attack upon me, or for the lies he had told about me? It was no more possible for me to apologize for knocking him over when he assailed me than it would have been for me to leap across Lake Adieno in the widest place. I did not wish to deprive myself of the advantages of attending the Parkville Liberal Institute; but if my remaining depended upon my humiliating myself before Poodles, upon my declaring that what I had done was wrong, when I believed it was right, I was no longer to be a student in the academy.  The exercises of the school proceeded as usual for a couple of hours, and there were no further signs of insubordination among the boys. At recess I purposely kept away from my more intimate friends, for I did not wish to tell them what course I intended to pursue, fearful that it would renew the disturbance.  An hour before the close of the session, the boys were required to bring in their examination papers in arithmetic. Every student, even to Poodles, handed in solutions to all the problems, and Mr. Parasyte and his assistants at once devoted themselves to the marking of them. In half an hour the principal was ready to report the result.  Half a dozen of the class had all the examples right, and I was one of the number. Very much to my astonishment, Poodles also was announced as one of the six; and when his name was mentioned, a score of the students glanced at me.  I did not understand it. I was quite satisfied that Poodles could not do the problems himself, and it was certain that he had obtained assistance from some one, though the declaration on the paper was duly signed. He had found a friend less scrupulous than I had been. Some one must have performed the examples for him; and as he had them all correct, it was evident that one of the six, who alone had presented perfect papers, must have afforded the assistance. After throwing out Poodles and myself, there were but four left; and two of these, to my certain knowledge, had joined in the demonstration in my favor: indeed, they were my friends beyond the possibility of a doubt. Between the other two I had no means of forming an opinion.  During the afternoon Mr. Parasyte had been very uneasy and nervous. It was plain to him that he ruled the boys by their free will, rather than by his own power; and this was not a pleasant thing for a man like him to know. Doubtless he felt that he had dropped the reins of his team, which, though going very well just then, might take it into its head to run away with him whenever it was convenient. Probably he felt the necessity of doing something to reëstablish his authority, and to obtain a stronger position than that he now occupied. If, with the experience I have since acquired, I could have spoken to him, I should have told him that justice and fairness alone would make him strong as a disciplinarian.  \"Poodles,\" said Mr. Parasyte, just before the close of the session, \"I see that all your examples were correctly performed, and that you signed the declaration on the paper.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Poodles.  \"When did you perform them?\"  \"I did all but two of them last night.\"  \"And when did you do those two?\" continued the principal, mildly, but with the air of a man who expects soon to make a triumphant point.  \"Between schools, at noon, while the students were at dinner and at play.\"  \"Very well. You had them all done but two when you met Thornton to-day noon?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Thornton,\" added Mr. Parasyte, turning to me, \"I have no disposition to hurry you in the unsettled case of to-day, though the result of Poodles's examination shows that he had no need of the assistance you say he asked of you; but perhaps it would be better that you should state distinctly whether or not you intend to apologize. It is quite possible that there was a misunderstanding between you and Poodles, which a mutual explanation might remove.\"  \"I do not think there was any misunderstanding,\" I replied.  \"If you wish to meet Poodles after school, I offer my services as a friend to assist in the adjustment of the dispute.\"  \"I don't want to meet him,\" said Poodles.  Mr. Parasyte actually rebuked him for this illiberal sentiment; and while he was doing so, I added that I had no desire to meet Poodles, as proposed. I now think I was wrong; but I had a feeling that the principal intended to browbeat me into an acknowledgment.  \"Very well, Thornton; if you refuse to make peace, you must take the consequences. Do you intend to apologize to Poodles, or not?\"  \"I do not, sir,\" I replied, decidedly.  \"Then you are expelled from the Parkville Liberal Institute.\"     CHAPTER IV.  IN WHICH ERNEST SAILS THE SPLASH, AND TAKES A BATH.   Difficult as the task was, I had thus far kept cool; but my sentence fell heavily upon me, and I could not help being angry, for I felt that I had been treated unfairly and unjustly. Poodles's statement had been accepted, and mine rejected; his word had been taken, while mine, which ought at least to have passed for as much as his, was utterly disregarded.  I turned upon my heel and went to my seat. My movement was sharp and abrupt, but I did not say anything.  \"Stop!\" said Mr. Parasyte, who evidently believed that the moment had come for him to vindicate his authority.  I did not stop.  \"Stop, I say!\" repeated the principal.  I proceeded to pick up my books and papers, to enable me to comply literally with my sentence.  \"Come here, Thornton.\"  I took no notice of the order, but continued to pack up my things.  \"Do you hear me?\" demanded Mr. Parasyte, in a loud and angry tone.  \"I do hear you, sir. I have been expelled, and I don't care about listening to any more speeches.\"  \"If you don't come here, I'll bring you here,\" added the principal, with emphasis.  Somewhat to my surprise, but greatly to my satisfaction, the boys made no demonstration in my favor. They seemed to think I was now in a mood to fight my own battle, though they were doubtless ready to aid me if I needed any help. Mr. Parasyte appeared to have begun in a way which indicated that he intended to maintain his authority, even at the risk of a personal encounter with me and the"]]]
