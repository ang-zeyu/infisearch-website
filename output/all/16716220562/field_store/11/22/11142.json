Soon after the death of her grandfather, Colonel Hathaway, had come the news of her husband's shipwreck. Hope of Danny Dexter's survival was finally abandoned by his sorrowing little wife and his many friends. Colonel Hathaway's comfortable fortune had mysteriously disappeared and Mary Louise faced a future of poverty. With native pluck she arose to the occasion. In spite of her sad heart she showed a cheerful spirit. Joining forces with Josie O'Gorman and Elizabeth Wright in the quaint Higgledy-Piggledy Shop, she opened a millinery department and was soon swamped with orders for smart hats by the elite of Dorfield and old-fashioned bonnets for the ancient ladies who refused to wear hats. When Danny came back, not having gone to a watery grave after all, and the lost fortune was found, Mary Louise again stood the test of being rich and beloved.  \"Nothing can spoil our Mary Louise,\" Josie O'Gorman declared, and Irene Macfarlane smiled from her wheel chair.  \"That is because she is pure gold, through and through,\" said the lame girl as she deftly plied her needle in the cobwebby lace collar she was mending.  \"We certainly shall miss her here at the Higgledy-Piggledy,\" put in Elizabeth Wright. \"It doesn't seem like the same place with Mary Louise gone. I wonder what the old ladies who still wear bonnets will do now. There is no other milliner in Dorfield who can fashion an old-time bonnet like our Mary Louise. She did them as though she loved them and the old ladies for whom they were intended.\"  \"Well, every old woman in town has had Mary Louise make her a bonnet 'exactly like Jane's and Susan's and Martha's and Matilda's',\" laughed Josie, \"and they don't change their bonnets oftener than every seven years, so we needn't worry about them just yet. Speaking of angels! Here she is!\"  Mary Louise literally danced into the shop. Ever since Danny returned her feet seemed to have wings.  \"I didn't know how miserable I had been until I had my present happiness with which to compare my former sorrow,\" she had told Josie O'Gorman shortly after Danny got back.  \"You were too busy to be altogether unhappy,\" spake the wise Josie. \"Being poor enough to have to make one's living is not so bad as it is cracked up to be. It was certainly a blessing in your case.\"  As we have said, Mary Louise danced into the shop. Then she breezed over and kissed the three friends in turn.  \"It's sad no longer to be a partner here,\" she said, \"but it is nice to be able to kiss all of you dear old girls. A business footing does not permit of the familiarity of embraces between partners. I've just got lots to tell all of you!\"  \"Fire away,\" commanded Josie, \"but you must excuse me if I go on ironing the fine linen of the wealthy.\"  Among the many industries the Higgledy-Piggledy Shop boasted was that of laundering fine linen and laces. It was not known in Dorfield except by a select few that Josie O'Gorman was a detective in high standing with the chief, but everybody who had laces or linen too fine to trust to the doubtful ministrations of an ordinary laundress knew that the girl was a magician with suds and a flatiron. Josie declared washing and ironing helped her to work out knotty problems and there was nothing like having your arms in suds up to the elbows to give you an insight into who did what and why.  The girls settled themselves to listen to Mary Louise's news, whatever it was. Elizabeth Wright closed her typewriter on which she had been copying some manuscript for a budding author; Irene Macfarlane stuck her needle in the pin-cushion hanging from her tidy work-basket and folded the lace collar. Only Josie went on with her work, testing her electric iron with a professional sizzle.  \"Well, you see it's this way,\" continued Mary Louise, settling herself on an antique Windsor chair that the Higgledy-Piggledies were trying to sell on commission. \"Danny and I are going to have plenty of money to live on, with what he earns. I know how Danny feels about my being an heiress; not that he ever says a word about it, but he has a good job and there is a chance of steady advancement and I have decided to do something for somebody who needs it more than I do with all that gold Grandpa Jim left me and the old house which is too huge for Danny and me to live in, and too sad somehow for me just yet.\"  \"I'm glad you feel that way about the house,\" put in Josie, shaking out another damask napkin. \"It's a bully old house but too big for a young couple who don't need much room to be happy in.\"  \"What is your plan, dear?\" asked Irene, her sweet eyes misting a little. The thought of Mary Louise quitting the old house which was next to Uncle Peter Conant's, where Irene made her home, caused her to be sad.  \"Danny and I are going into an apartment for the time being and later on will build a house more suitable to our needs. I am going to give the old home to the Children's Home Society and make an endowment with a part of my gold, so the society can begin operations at once in their new quarters. They have a miserable place now, with not near enough room.\"  \"What a corking plan!\" cried Josie. \"I know of no charity that appeals to one as this business of getting homes for poor little waifs. It helps the poor little kiddies and it helps the childless persons who want to adopt them. I'm with you, Mrs. Danny Dexter!\"  \"And I! And I!\" came in a chorus from Elizabeth and Irene.  \"The old house is more fitted for an institution than a private home. The rooms are so huge, at least most of them are, and still it is homelike. Only think how lovely it will be for the children to have the pretty yard and old garden to play in. Dr. Weston, the dear old gentleman who is in charge of the home now, says there is so little room and so little money that they can't care for the children properly and the people who come to see about adopting them are afraid to take them sometimes because they don't look healthy enough.\"  \"Poor little things!\" murmured Irene.  \"I'm wondering if your Uncle Peter and Aunt Hannah would mind having a children's home next door to them,\" Mary Louise asked.  \"I'm sure they wouldn't,\" said Irene. \"I heard Uncle Peter say only last night that he'd like to see the old place occupied again even if it were by noisy boarders, and you know Aunt Hannah loves company and she's so deaf that the noise the children make won't affect her in the least.\"  \"And you?\" asked Mary Louise. \"How will you like it?\"  \"I want what you want, dear. You must call on me to help in any way I can.\"  \"Indeed I will! We hope to make a very active society of this Children's Home. I have talked to Dr. Weston, but have not told him about making the endowment or giving the old house yet. I wanted to be sure it would not be a nuisance to Uncle Peter Conant. He and Aunt Hannah have been too good to me for me to go against their wishes.\"  \"Set your mind at rest on that score,\" said Irene. \"I can answer for them.\"  \"I'll do any typing you need when you begin on the thing,\" suggested Elizabeth, \"and I can look after the publicity end, too. The more persons who get interested in an enterprise like this the better for it.\"  \"Indeed you are right. We will need more money than I can give, too. Yearly subscriptions will have to be solicited and the more publicity we get the better.\"  \"I'll be chief detective for the society,\" laughed Josie, shaking out another napkin. \"You may think that is a joke, but I tell you there are more shady mix-ups in a concern like that than in courts of law. I'll bet I'll be called on to trace parentage and establish property rights and relationships before the year is up.\"  \"Nobody could do it better,\" smiled Mary Louise. \"Now I am going to stop in and have a little talk with Uncle Peter Conant at his office and then I'm going around and tell dear old Dr. Weston that as far as I am concerned he can move his Children's Home to the Hathaway house tomorrow. That is, if Uncle Peter doesn't object.\" Josie offered to meet her at the Children's Home and Mary Louise gladly accepted.  Uncle Peter didn't object. To the contrary he seemed vastly pleased with the prospect of some young neighbors.  \"'Twill do Hannah good "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22532"],["title","Mary Louise and Josie O'Gorman (#1)"],["body","no doubt she will turn our house into a kind of annex. Go ahead, my dear, and invest your money in something where moth and rust will not corrupt and where thieves will not break through and steal.\"  \"Oh, Uncle Peter, I am so glad to hear you say that. I haven't any blood kin to go to for advice and Danny always says for me to do exactly what I want to do, which is bad for my character. It might make me very conceited to have him always insist that I'm right just because I want to do something.\"  \"Well, well! The young rascal is right,\" laughed Mr. Conant.  \"But do you think Grandpa Jim would approve of what I am doing?\"  \"Surely he would. I haven't a doubt if you had not been in existence he would have done much the same sort of thing with his fortune. Jim Hathaway was a powerful charitable man.\"  Mary Louise then went to see Dr. Weston at his office in the dingy little building that housed the Children's Home Society. The old man slept on a bumpy couch in the corner of his office. He had been assigned a bedroom in the house, but the association had grown beyond its quarters and the devoted doctor had long ago given up his room as an overflow dormitory for the constantly increasing number of little children who were sent to the home to be kept there until some kind person saw fit to adopt them.  Dr. Weston's life had been dedicated to social work and now in his old age the thing which interested him most and to which he gave all his strength and time was the placing of unfortunate children in good homes. It was through his labor and influence the Children's Home Society had been established and struggled for existence. He was hampered in his work by an unwieldy board of women managers, but he realized the importance of having a large board, because the more persons interested the more money it was possible to raise for his pet charity. At the time of Mary Louise's call funds were very low, so low that it seemed as though the society might have to close its hospitable doors to the homeless waifs and the present inmates be parceled out to the various orphan asylums. The board was to meet that very day. Dr. Weston always dreaded a board meeting. There were some fine, noble women on his board, but also some interfering busy-bodies, who were always starting disagreeable discussions, such as how much sugar a little child should be allowed and how important it was that vanity should not be encouraged in the girls.  Business and finance were not Dr. Weston's strong points. His only idea was to gather in the little children and give them a home in the society until better homes could be found for them. He wanted to make the place as little like an institution as possible, but several members of the board were for unrelenting law and prison order.  The old man sat with his head in his hands worrying over the affairs of the home. He was aware of the fact that funds were low and needs were increasing. The home needed another nurse and a higher-priced cook, who would prepare the food with more care than the present slatternly incumbent. It needed several hospital wards, where children could be isolated when attacked by contagious diseases. The doctor had known his family, varying from thirty to fifty, all down at one time with bad colds, or coryza, as named by the medical profession, when isolating the first small cougher and sneezer might have saved all of the others.  \"If only that young Mrs. Dexter, Jim Hathaway's granddaughter, would make us a small donation,\" he groaned. \"No doubt she could well afford it, but young folks are mighty thoughtless. She seemed interested in the children but I fancy that will be all--just a sentimental interest and no more.\"  A tap on the door and Mary Louise entered as though in answer to his thoughts.  \"I have come to see if I might help, Dr. Weston,\" she said simply.    CHAPTER II THE BOARD ELECTS NEW MEMBERS  As Mary Louise seated herself in Dr. Weston's shabby office Josie entered and was introduced.  \"Miss O'Gorman is an especial friend of mine, Dr. Weston, and I have asked her to come here because she also is interested in your home.\"  \"Fine! There can't be too many interested in my home,\" exclaimed the old man, a light coming in his eyes. \"I say _my_ home just because I am so interested in it, but it is in reality under the control of the board. You say you want to help some?\" he asked with eagerness.  \"Yes, sir! I have been thinking over the matter and have decided that this undertaking of all others appeals to me most and I should like to give my old home. You know the old Hathaway house, do you not?\"  \"Yes, yes!\" There was excitement in Dr. Weston's tone.  \"It is too big for me to live in and I think my grandfather would be glad to know that many little children are finding a temporary home there,\" said Mary Louise. \"There is a great deal of furniture there, too, much of which would be suitable, and a lovely great yard and pretty garden where the kiddies can play.\"  \"Oh, my dear, you make an old man very happy!\"  \"I want to make an endowment, too,\" Mary Louise continued, \"enough with the subscriptions you already control to take care of the children as they should be taken care of.\"  The tears were rolling down Dr. Weston's cheeks, then he laughed. \"What a bomb I can throw in the camp when the board meets this morning! I dreaded their coming but now--now--\"  \"Who is on your board?\" asked Josie practically.  Dr. Weston began naming them over.  \"Humph!\" was all Josie said, but that \"humph\" was eloquent.  Many of the names were known to the girls. It was a varied list composed of good, bad and indifferent personalities, from the viewpoint of the social worker.  \"Mrs. Opie is a fine open-hearted woman,\" said Josie, \"and Mrs. McGraw is good nature itself and most generous. Mrs. Wright is a great worker and manager--\" Josie shrugged her shoulders without finishing her sentence.  \"Yes!\" breathed Dr. Weston with an eloquent sigh. \"A good woman, a good woman, but something of a--a--boss!\"  \"You mean Elizabeth's mother?\" asked Mary Louise. \"Grandpa Jim used to call her Kaiser Wright, but that was before we went into the war. He said she could be the head of an absolute monarchy and run all the affairs of state and see to it that the kitchen maids washed out the tea towels after every meal. She is on every charitable and club board in town and at the same time is a most strenuous housekeeper and has a hand in the making of the clothes of her entire family.\"  \"A wonderful woman! A wonderful woman!\" exclaimed Dr. Weston, but there was that in his tone that gave Mary Louise and Josie to understand that he was glad there were not many \"wonderful women\" on the board of the Children's Home Society.  \"The board meets in a few minutes,\" continued the old man. \"It is now beginning to assemble in the parlor. I hope you young ladies can remain until I can inform the ladies of the generous gift in store for our home. I am the sole and unworthy representative of my sex on the board.\"  \"Of course we can wait,\" declared Josie. \"Who is the president of your organization?\"  \"Mrs. Trescott is chairman but--\"  \"She doesn't stay in it?\" laughed Josie.  \"I won't say that,\" smiled the doctor. \"Never tell tales out of the board. Ill return in a few moments. I can't tell you the happiness I feel in being able to inform these ladies of our good fortune.\"  The board was trying to get in session. The girls, waiting in the office, could hear a steady hum of conversation with an occasional sharp rap of the gavel when the president evidently had something to say herself.  \"Sounds more like an afternoon tea than the deliberations of an august body,\" said Josie.  But at last the meeting was called to order, the minutes were read, the treasurer's report made and the various committees called on for a reckoning. All this was accomplished with much talk and many interruptions. The treasurer's report brought forth a groan. There was little money left in the treasury and much was needed in the way of equipment.  \"I see nothing for it but to give up,\" said one lugubrious member. \"Dorfield doesn't take enough interest to support the home and so there's an end of it.\"  \"That would come under new business,\" suggested the president. \"We must get through with what is on the carpet first,\" consulting a small book on parliamentary law.  \"Well, there is no use in staying here if we are going to have to give up,\" spake the lugubrious one. \"All of this talk is foolish if we are going to disband.\"  \"Disband, nothing!\" broke in Mrs. Wright, whose hands were busily employed knitting a sweater for one of her girls while her eyes were glancing from person to person. Her foot tapped constantly while her knitting needles flew. One felt that she was doing some kind of work with that tapping foot.  \"Disband, indeed!\" she whispered sibilantly. \"We'll have a tag day and a rummage sale and I'll get up a dicker party and some theatricals. Disband, indeed!\"  At last Dr. Weston was allowed to speak.  \"Ladies,\" he said, \"I mean Madame President, I have to report to the board--\"  \"Not another case of measles, I trust!\" interrupted one.  \"No, not a case of measles, but a case that I hope is going to prove quite as contagious--\"  \"Mumps, I'll be bound!\"  \"No, madame! We have had a gift for the home--\"  \"More old faded carpets and carved walnut furniture, I wager!\"  Finally Dr. Weston was able to divulge to the board of managers that Mary Louise Burrows, Jim Hathaway's granddaughter, now Mrs. Danny Dexter, intended to hand over to them her grandfather's old home.  Mary Louise and Josie in the next room with the door closed were able to tell exactly the moment when the news was broken. Such a hubbub ensued that the doctor's voice was quite drowned out.  \"And now, ladies,\" continued Dr. Weston, \"since we have several vacancies on our board, I think we could not do better than to ask Mrs. Dexter to fill one of those vacancies and her friend Miss Josie"]]]
