Looking round, I saw a great serpent approaching me. He was nearly 50 feet long, and had a beard 3 feet in length. His body shone in the sun like gold, and when he reared himself up from his coils before me I fell upon my face.  \"Then the serpent began to speak: 'What has brought thee, little one, what has brought thee? If thou dost not tell me quickly what has brought thee to this isle, I shall make thee vanish like a flame.' So saying, he took me up in his mouth, carried me gently to his lair, and laid me down unhurt; and again he said, 'What has brought thee, little one, what has brought thee to this isle of the sea?' So I told him the story of our shipwreck, and how I alone had escaped from the fury of the waves. Then said he to me: 'Fear not, little one, and let not thy face be sad. If thou hast come to me, it is God who has brought thee to this isle, which is filled with all good things. And now, see: thou shalt dwell for four months in this isle, and then a ship of thine own land shall come, and thou shalt go home to thy country, and die in thine own town. As for me, I am here with my brethren and my children. There are seventy-five of us in all, besides a young girl, who came here by chance, and was burned by fire from heaven. But if thou art strong and patient, thou shalt yet embrace thy children and thy wife, and return to thy home.'  \"Then I bowed low before him, and promised to tell of him to Pharaoh, and to bring him ships full of all the treasures of Egypt; but he smiled at my speech, and said, 'Thou hast nothing that I need, for I am Prince of the Land of Punt, and all its perfumes are mine. Moreover, when thou departest, thou shalt never again see this isle, for it shall be changed into waves.'  [Illustration: PLATE 9. AN EGYPTIAN COUNTRY HOUSE.]  \"Now, behold! when the time was come, as he had foretold, the ship drew near. And the good serpent said to me, 'Farewell, farewell! go to thy home, little one, see again thy children, and let thy name be good in thy town; these are my wishes for thee.' So I bowed low before him, and he loaded me with precious gifts of perfume, cassia, sweet woods, ivory, baboons, and all kinds of precious things, and I embarked in the ship. And now, after a voyage of two months, we are coming to the house of Pharaoh, and I shall go in before Pharaoh, and offer the gifts which I have brought from this isle into Egypt, and Pharaoh shall thank me before the great ones of the land.\"  Our last story belongs to a later age than that of the Shipwrecked Sailor. About 1,500 years before Christ there arose in Egypt a race of mighty soldier-Kings, who founded a great empire, which stretched from the Soudan right through Syria and Mesopotamia as far as the great River Euphrates. Mesopotamia, or Naharaina, as the Egyptians called it, had been an unknown land to them before this time; but now it became to them what America was to the men of Queen Elizabeth's time, or the heart of Africa to your grandfathers--the wonderful land of romance, where all kinds of strange things might happen. And this story of the Doomed Prince, which I have to tell you, belongs partly to Naharaina, and, as you will see, some of our own fairy-stories have been made out of very much the same materials as are used in it.  Once upon a time there was a King in Egypt who had no child. His heart was grieved because he had no child, and he prayed to the gods for a son; so in course of time a son was born to him, and the Fates (like fairy godmothers) came to his cradle to foretell what should happen to him. And when they saw him, they said, \"His doom is to die either by the crocodile, or by the serpent, or by the dog.\" When the King heard this, his heart was sore for his little son, and he resolved that he would put the boy where no harm could come to him; so he built for him a beautiful house away in the desert, and furnished it with all kinds of fine things, and sent the boy there, with faithful servants to guard him, and to see that he came to no hurt. So the boy grew up quietly and safely in his house in the desert.  But it fell on a day that the young Prince looked out from the roof of his house, and he saw a man walking across the desert, with a dog following him. So he said to the servant who was with him, \"What is this that walks behind the man who is coming along the road?\" \"It is a dog,\" said the page. Then the boy said, \"You must bring me one like him,\" and the page went and told His Majesty. Then the King said, \"Get a little puppy, and take it to him, lest his heart be sad.\" So they brought him a little dog, and it grew up along with him.  Now, it happened that, when the boy had grown to be a strong young man, he grew weary of being always shut up in his fine house. Therefore he sent a message to his father, saying, \"Why am I always to be shut up here? Since I am doomed to three evil Fates, let me have my desire, and let God do what is in His heart.\" So the King agreed, and they gave the young Prince arms, and sent him away to the eastern frontier, and his dog went with him, and they said to him, \"Go wherever you will.\" So he went northward through the desert, he and his dog, until he came to the land of Naharaina.  [Illustration: Plate 10 STATUES OF KING AMENHOTEP III.]  Now, the chief of the land of Naharaina had no children, save one beautiful daughter, and for her he had built a wonderful house. It had seventy windows, and it stood on a great rock more than 100 feet high. And the chief summoned the sons of all the chiefs of the country round about, and said to them, \"The Prince who can climb to my daughter's window shall have her for his wife.\" So all the young Princes of the land camped around the house, and tried every day to climb to the window of the beautiful Princess; but none of them succeeded, for the rock was very steep and high.  Then, one day when they were climbing as they were wont, the young Prince of Egypt rode by with his dog; and the Princes welcomed him, bathed him, and fed his horse, and said to him, \"Whence comest thou, thou goodly youth?\" He did not wish to tell them that he was the son of Pharaoh, so he answered, \"I am the son of an Egyptian officer. My father married a second wife, and, when she had children, she hated me, and drove me away from my home.\" So they took him into their company, and he stayed with them many days.  Now, it fell on a day that he asked them, \"Why do you stay here, trying always to climb this rock?\" And they told him of the beautiful Princess who lived in the house on the top of the rock, and how the man who could climb to her window should marry her. Therefore the young Prince of Egypt climbed along with them, and it came to pass that at last he climbed to the window of the Princess; and when she saw him, she fell in love with him, and kissed him.  Then was word sent to the Chief of Naharaina that one of the young men had climbed to his daughter's window, and he asked which of the Princes it was, and the messenger said, \"It is not a Prince, but the son of an Egyptian officer, who has been driven away from Egypt by his stepmother.\" Then the Chief of Naharaina was very angry, and said, \"Shall I give my daughter to an Egyptian fugitive? Let him go back to Egypt.\" But, when the messengers came to tell the young man to go away, the Princess seized his hand, and said, \"If you take him from me, I will not eat; I will not drink; I shall die in that same hour.\" Then the chief sent men to kill the youth where he was in the house. But the Princess said, \"If you kill him, I shall be dead before the sun goes down. I will not live an hour if I am parted from him.\" So the chief was obliged to agree to the marriage; and the young Prince was married to the Princess, and her father gave them a house, and slaves, and fields, and all sorts of good things.  But after a time the young Prince said to his wife, \"I am doomed to die, either by a crocodile, or by a serpent, or by a dog.\" And his wife answered, \"Why, then, do you keep this dog always with you? Let him be killed.\" \"Nay,\" said he, \"I am not going to kill my faithful dog, which I have brought up since the time that he was a puppy.\" So the Princess feared greatly for her husband, and would never let him go out of her sight.  Now, it happened in course of time that the Prince went back to the land of Egypt; and his wife went with him, and his dog, and he dwelt in Egypt. And one day, when the evening came, he grew drowsy, and fell asleep; and his wife filled a bowl with milk, and placed it by his side, and sat to watch him as he slept. Then a great serpent came out of his hole to bite the youth. But his wife was watching, and she made the servants give the milk to the serpent, and he drank till he could not move. Then the Princess killed the serpent with blows of her dagger. So she woke her husband, and he was astonished to see the serpent lying dead, and his faithful wife said to him, \"Behold, God has given one of thy dooms into thy hand; He will also give the others.\" And the Prince made sacrifice to God, and praised Him.  Now, it fell on a day that the Prince went out to walk in his estate, and his dog went with him. And as they walked, the dog ran after some game, and the Prince followed the dog. They came to the River Nile, and the dog went into the river, and the Prince followed him. Then a great crocodile rose in the river, and laid hold on the youth, and said, \"I am thy doom, following after thee.\" ...  But just here the old papyrus roll on which the story is written is torn away, and we do not know what happened to the Doomed Prince. I fancy that, in some way or other, his dog would save him from the crocodile, and that later, by some accident, the poor faithful dog would be the cause of his master's death. At least, it looks as if the end of the story must have been something like that; for the Egyptians believed that no one could escape from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22816"],["title","The Adventures of Buster Bear (#0)"],["body","TRADE QUADDIES MARK                 The Bedtime Story-Books                      THE ADVENTURES OF                       BUSTER BEAR                            BY                    THORNTON W.

Once more he yawned, and slowly got to his feet and shook himself. Then he walked over to a big pine-tree, stood up on his hind legs, reached as high up on the trunk of the tree as he could, and scratched the bark with his great claws. After that he yawned until it seemed as if his jaws would crack, and then sat down to think what he wanted for breakfast.  While he sat there, trying to make up his mind what would taste best, he was listening to the sounds that told of the waking of all the little people who live in the Green Forest. He heard Sammy Jay way off in the distance screaming, \"Thief! Thief!\" and grinned. \"I wonder,\" thought Buster, \"if some one has stolen Sammy's breakfast, or if he has stolen the breakfast of some one else. Probably he is the thief himself.\"  He heard Chatterer the Red Squirrel scolding as fast as he could make his tongue go and working himself into a terrible rage. \"Must be that Chatterer got out of bed the wrong way this morning,\" thought he.  He heard Blacky the Crow cawing at the top of his lungs, and he knew by the sound that Blacky was getting into mischief of some kind. He heard the sweet voices of happy little singers, and they were good to hear. But most of all he listened to a merry, low, silvery laugh that never stopped but went on and on, until he just felt as if he must laugh too. It was the voice of the Laughing Brook. And as Buster listened it suddenly came to him just what he wanted for breakfast.  \"I'm going fishing,\" said he in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice to no one in particular. \"Yes, Sir, I'm going fishing. I want some fat trout for my breakfast.\"  He shuffled along over to the Laughing Brook, and straight to a little pool of which he knew, and as he drew near he took the greatest care not to make the teeniest, weeniest bit of noise. Now it just happened that early as he was, some one was before Buster Bear. When he came in sight of the little pool, who should he see but another fisherman there, who had already caught a fine fat trout. Who was it? Why, Little Joe Otter to be sure. He was just climbing up the bank with the fat trout in his mouth. Buster Bear's own mouth watered as he saw it. Little Joe sat down on the bank and prepared to enjoy his breakfast. He hadn't seen Buster Bear, and he didn't know that he or any one else was anywhere near.  Buster Bear tiptoed up very softly until he was right behind Little Joe Otter. \"Woof, woof!\" said he in his deepest, most grumbly-rumbly voice. \"That's a very fine looking trout. I wouldn't mind if I had it myself.\"  Little Joe Otter gave a frightened squeal and without even turning to see who was speaking dropped his fish and dived headfirst into the Laughing Brook. Buster Bear sprang forward and with one of his big paws caught the fat trout just as it was slipping back into the water.  \"Here's your trout, Mr. Otter,\" said he, as Little Joe put his head out of water to see who had frightened him so. \"Come and get it.\"  [Illustration: \"Here's your trout, Mr. Otter,\" said he. _Page 5._]  But Little Joe wouldn't. The fact is, he was afraid to. He snarled at Buster Bear and called him a thief and everything bad he could think of. Buster didn't seem to mind. He chuckled as if he thought it all a great joke and repeated his invitation to Little Joe to come and get his fish. But Little Joe just turned his back and went off down the Laughing Brook in a great rage.  \"It's too bad to waste such a fine fish,\" said Buster thoughtfully. \"I wonder what I'd better do with it.\" And while he was wondering, he ate it all up. Then he started down the Laughing Brook to try to catch some for himself.     II  LITTLE JOE OTTER GETS EVEN WITH BUSTER BEAR   Little Joe Otter was in a terrible rage. It was a bad beginning for a beautiful day and Little Joe knew it. But who wouldn't be in a rage if his breakfast was taken from him just as he was about to eat it? Anyway, that is what Little Joe told Billy Mink. Perhaps he didn't tell it quite exactly as it was, but you know he was very badly frightened at the time.  \"I was sitting on the bank of the Laughing Brook beside one of the little pools,\" he told Billy Mink, \"and was just going to eat a fat trout I had caught, when who should come along but that great big bully, Buster Bear. He took that fat trout away from me and ate it just as if it belonged to him! I hate him! If I live long enough I'm going to get even with him!\"  Of course that wasn't nice talk and anything but a nice spirit, but Little Joe Otter's temper is sometimes pretty short, especially when he is hungry, and this time he had had no breakfast, you know.  Buster Bear hadn't actually taken the fish away from Little Joe. But looking at the matter as Little Joe did, it amounted to the same thing. You see, Buster knew perfectly well when he invited Little Joe to come back and get it that Little Joe wouldn't dare do anything of the kind.  \"Where is he now?\" asked Billy Mink.  \"He's somewhere up the Laughing Brook. I wish he'd fall in and get drowned!\" snapped Little Joe.  Billy Mink just had to laugh. The idea of great big Buster Bear getting drowned in the Laughing Brook was too funny. There wasn't water enough in it anywhere except down in the Smiling Pool, and that was on the Green Meadows, where Buster had never been known to go. \"Let's go see what he is doing,\" said Billy Mink.  At first Little Joe didn't want to, but at last his curiosity got the better of his fear, and he agreed. So the two little brown-coated scamps turned down the Laughing Brook, taking the greatest care to keep out of sight themselves. They had gone only a little way when Billy Mink whispered: \"Sh-h! There he is.\"  Sure enough, there was Buster Bear sitting close beside a little pool and looking into it very intently.  \"What's he doing?\" asked Little Joe Otter, as Buster Bear sat for the longest time without moving.  Just then one of Buster's big paws went into the water as quick as a flash and scooped out a trout that had ventured too near.  \"He's fishing!\" exclaimed Billy Mink.  And that is just what Buster Bear was doing, and it was very plain to see that he was having great fun. When he had eaten the trout he had caught, he moved along to the next little pool.  \"They are _our_ fish!\" said Little Joe fiercely. \"He has no business catching _our_ fish!\"  \"I don't see how we are going to stop him,\" said Billy Mink.  \"I do!\" cried Little Joe, into whose head an idea had just popped. \"I'm going to drive all the fish out of the little pools and muddy the water all up. Then we'll see how many fish he will get! Just you watch me get even with Buster Bear.\"  Little Joe slipped"]]]
