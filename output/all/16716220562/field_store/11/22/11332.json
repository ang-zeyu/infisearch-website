For at one time Donald had served in the French army. So now, instead of receiving Edward in his national costume, he had put on an old blue-and-red foreign uniform, in which he made so strange a figure that, though it was donned in his honour, his visitor had hard work to keep from laughing. Nor was the freebooter's conversation more in accord with his surroundings. He talked much of Edward's family and connections, and especially of his uncle's Jacobite politics--on which last account, he seemed inclined to welcome the young man with more cordiality than, as a soldier of King George, Edward felt to be his due. The scene which followed was, however, better fitted to the time and place.  At a half-savage feast Edward had the opportunity of tasting steaks fresh cut from some of the Baron's cattle, broiled on the coals before his eyes, and washed down with draughts of Highland whiskey.  Yet in spite of the warmth of his welcome, there was something very secret and unpleasant about the shifty cunning glance of this little robber-chief, who seemed to know so much about the royal garrisons, and even about the men of Edward's own troop whom he had brought with him from Waverley-Honour.  When at last they were left alone together, Evan Dhu having lain down in his plaid, the little captain of cattle-lifters asked Captain Waverley in a very significant manner, \"if he had nothing particular to say to him.\"  Edward, a little startled at the tone in which the question was put, answered that he had no other reason for coming to the cave but a desire to see so strange a dwelling-place.  For a moment Donald Bean Lean looked him full in the face, as if waiting for something more, and then, with a nod full of meaning, he muttered: \"You might as well have confided in me. I am as worthy of trust as either the Baron of Bradwardine or Vich Ian Vohr! But you are equally welcome to my house!\"  His heather bed, the flickering of the fire, the smoking torches, and the movement of the wild outlaws going and coming about the cave, soon, however, diverted Waverley's thoughts from the mysterious words of his host. His eyelids drew together, nor did he reopen them till the morning sun, reflected from the lake, was filling all the cave with a glimmering twilight.   THE SECOND INTERLUDE      As soon as this part of the tale was finished, the     audience showed much greater eagerness to enter     immediately upon the acting of Donald Bean Lean's     cattle-raid, and its consequences, than it had     previously displayed as to the doings of Edward     Waverley.      As Hugh John admitted, this was \"something like!\"     The Abbey precincts were instantly filled with the     mingled sounds characteristic of all well-conducted     forays, and it was well indeed that the place was     wholly deserted. For the lowings of the driven     cattle, the shouts of the triumphant Highlanders,     the deep rage of the Baron, stalking to and fro     wrapped in his cloak on the Castle terrace, might     well have astonished the crowd which in these     summer days comes from the four corners of the     world \"to view fair Melrose aright.\"      It was not till the edge had worn off their first     enthusiasm, that it became possible to collect them     again in order to read \"The Hold of a Highland     Robber,\" which makes Chapter Seventeenth of     _Waverley_ itself. And the reading so fired the     enthusiasm of Sweetheart that she asked for the     book to take to bed with her. The boys were more     practical, though equally enthusiastic.      \"Wait till we get home,\" cried Hugh John, cracking     his fingers and thumbs. \"I know a proper place for     Donald Bean Lean's cave.\"      \"And I,\" said Sir Toady Lion, \"will light a fire by     the pond and toss the embers into the water. It     will be jolly to hear 'em hiss, I tell you!\"      \"But what,\" asked Maid Margaret, \"shall we do for     the cattle and sheep that were hanging by the     heels, when Edward went into Donald Bean Lean's     cave?\"      \"Why, we will hang _you_ up by the heels and cut     slices off you!\" said Sir Toady, with frowning     truculence.      Whereat the little girl, a little solemnised, began     to edge away from the dangerous neighbourhood of     such a pair of young cannibals. Sweetheart     reproached her brothers for inventing calumnies     against their countrymen.      \"Even the Highlanders were never so wicked,\" she     objected; \"they did not eat one another.\"      \"Well, anyway,\" retorted Sir Toady Lion, unabashed,     \"Sawney Bean did. Perhaps he was a cousin of     Donald's, though in the history it says that he     came from East Lothian.\"      \"Yes,\" cried Hugh John, \"and in an old book written     in Latin it says (father read it to us) that one of     his little girls was too young to be executed with     the rest on the sands of Leith. So the King sent     her to be brought up by kind people, where she was     brought up without knowing anything of her father,     the cannibal, and her mother, the cannibaless--\"      \"Oh,\" cried Sweetheart, who knew what was coming,     putting up her hands over her ears, \"please don't     tell that dreadful story all over again.\"      \"Father read it out of a book--so there!\" cried Sir     Toady, implacably, \"go on, Hugh John!\"      \"And so when this girl was about as big as     Sweetheart, and, of course, could not remember her     grandfather's nice cave or the larder where the     arms and legs were hung up to dry in the smoke--\"      \"Oh, you horrid boy!\" cried Sweetheart, not,     however, removing herself out of ear-shot--because,     after all, it was nice to shiver just a little.      \"Oh, yes, and I have seen the cave,\" cried Sir     Toady, \"it is on the shore near Ballantrae--a     horrid place. Go on, Hugh John, tell about Sawney     Bean's grandchild!\"      \"Well, she grew up and up, playing with dolls just     like other girls, till she was old enough to be     sent out to service. And after she had been a while     about the house to which she went, it was noticed     that some of the babies in the neighbourhood began     to go a-missing, and they found--\"      \"I think she was a nursemaid!\" interrupted Sir     Toady, dispassionately. \"That must have been it.     The little wretches cried--_so she ate them!_\"      \"Oh,\" cried Sweetheart, stopping her ears with her     fingers, \"don't tell us what they found--I believe     you made it all up, anyway.\"      \"No, I didn't,\" cried Hugh John, shouting in her     ear as if to a very deaf person, \"it was father who     read it to us, out of a big book with fat black     letters. So it must be true!\"      Sir Toady was trying to drag away his sister's arms     that she might have the benefit of details, when I     appeared in the distance. Whereupon Hugh John, who     felt his time growing limited, concluded thus, \"And     when they were taking the girl away to hang her,     the minister asked her why she had killed the     babies, and she answered him, 'If people only knew     how good babies were--especially little     girls--_there would not be one left between Forth     and Solway!_'\"      Then quite unexpectedly Maid Margaret began to sob     bitterly.      \"They _shan't_ hang me up and eat me,\" she cried,     running as hard as she could and flinging herself     into my arms; \"Hugh John and Sir Toady say they     will, as soon as we get home.\"      Happily I had a light cane of a good vintage in my     hand, and it did not take long to convince the pair     of young scamps of the inconvenience of frightening     their little sister. Sweetheart looked on     approvingly as two forlorn young men were walked     off to a supper, healthfully composed of plain     bread and butter, and washed down by some nice cool     water from the pump.      \"I told you!\" she said, \"you wouldn't believe me.\"      All the same she was tender-hearted enough to     convey a platter of broken meats secretly up to     their \"condemned cell,\" as I knew from finding the     empty plate under their washstand in the morning.     And as Maid Margaret was being carried off to be     bathed and comforted, a Voice, passing their door,     threatened additional pains and penalties to little     boys who frightened their sisters.      \"It was all in a book,\" said Hugh John, defending     himself from under the bedclothes, \"father read it     to us!\"      \"We did it for her good,\" suggested Sir Toady.      \"If I hear another word out of you--\" broke in the     Voice; and then added, \"go to sleep this instant!\"      The incident of the cave had long been forgotten     and forgiven, before I could continue the story of     Waverley in the cave of Donald Bean Lean. We sat     once more \"in oor ain hoose at hame,\" or rather     outside it, near a certain pleasant chalet in a     wood, from which place you can see a brown and     turbulent river running downward to the sea.      THE THIRD TALE FROM \"WAVERLEY\"   I. THE CHIEF OF THE MAC-IVORS AND THE CHIEF'S SISTER  WHEN Edward awoke next morning, he could not for a moment remember where he was. The cave was deserted. Only the grey ashes of the fire, a few gnawed bones, and an empty keg remained to prove that he was still on the scene of last night's feast. He went out into the sunlight. In a little natural harbour the boat was lying snugly moored. Farther out, on a rocky spit, was the mark of last night's beacon-fire. Here Waverley had to turn back. Cliffs shut him in on every side, and Edward was at a loss what to do, till he discovered, climbing perilously out in the rock above the cave mouth, some slight steps or ledges. These he mounted with difficulty, and, passing over the shoulder of the cliff, found himself presently on the shores of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22656"],["title","Red Cap Tales, Stolen from the Treasure Chest of the Wizard of the North (#6)"],["body"," about four miles long, surrounded on every side by wild heathery mountains.  In the distance he could see a man fishing and a companion watching him. By the Lochaber axe which the latter carried Edward recognised the fisher as Evan Dhu. On a stretch of sand under a birch tree, a girl was laying out a breakfast of milk, eggs, barley bread, fresh butter, and honeycomb. She was singing blithely, yet she must have had to travel far that morning to collect such dainties in so desolate a region.  This proved to be Alice, the daughter of Donald Bean Lean, and it is nothing to her discredit that she had made herself as pretty as she could, that she might attend upon the handsome young Englishman. All communication, however, had to be by smiles and signs, for Alice spoke no English. Nevertheless she set out her dainties with right good-will, and then seated herself on a stone a little distance away to watch for an opportunity of serving the young soldier.  Presently Evan Dhu came up with his catch, a fine salmon-trout, and soon slices of the fish were broiling on the wood embers. After breakfast, Alice gathered what was left into a wicker basket, and, flinging her plaid about her, presented her cheek to Edward for \"the stranger's kiss.\" Evan Dhu made haste to secure a similar privilege, but Alice sprang lightly up the bank out of his reach, and with an arch wave of her hand to Edward she disappeared.  Then Evan Dhu led Edward back to the boat. The three men embarked, and after emerging from the mouth of the cavern, a clumsy sail was hoisted, and they bore away up the lake--Evan Dhu all the time loud in the praises of Alice Bean Lean.  Edward said that it was a pity that such a maiden should be the daughter of a common thief. But this Evan hotly denied. According to Evan, Donald Bean Lean, though indeed no reputable character, was far from being a thief. A thief was one who stole a cow from a poor cotter, but he who lifted a drove from a Sassenach laird was \"a gentleman drover.\"  \"But he would be hanged, all the same, if he were caught!\" objected Edward. \"I do not see the difference.\"  \"To be sure, he would _die for the law_, as many a pretty man has done before him,\" cried Evan. \"And a better death than to die, lying on damp straw in yonder cave like a mangy tyke!\"  \"And what,\" Edward suggested, \"would become of pretty Alice then?\"  \"Alice is both canny and fendy,\" said the bold Evan Dhu, with a cock of his bonnet, \"and I ken nocht to hinder me to marry her mysel'!\"  Edward laughed and applauded the Highlander's spirit, but asked also as to the fate of the Baron of Bradwardine's cattle.  \"By this time,\" said Evan, \"I warrant they are safe in the pass of Bally-Brough and on their road back to Tully-Veolan. And that is more than a regiment of King George's red soldiers could have brought about!\"  Evan Dhu had indeed some reason to be proud.  Reassured as to this, Edward accompanied his guide with more confidence toward the castle of Vich Ian Vohr. The \"five miles Scots\" seemed to stretch themselves out indefinitely, but at last the figure of a hunter, equipped with gun, dogs, and a single attendant, was seen far across the heath.  \"_Shogh_,\" said the man with the Lochaber axe, \"tat's the Chief!\"  Evan Dhu, who had boasted of his master's great retinue, denied it fiercely.  \"The Chief,\" he said, \"would not come out with never a soul with him but Callum Beg, to meet with an English gentleman.\"  But in spite of this prophecy, the Chief of Clan Ivor it was. Fergus Mac-Ivor, whom his people called Vich Ian Vohr, was a young man of much grace and dignity, educated in France, and of a strong, secret, and turbulent character, which by policy he hid for the most part under an appearance of courtesy and kindness. He had long been mustering his clan in secret, in order once more to take a leading part in another attempt to dethrone King George, and to set on the throne of Britain either the Chevalier St. George or his son Prince Charles.  When Waverley and the Chief approached the castle--a stern and rugged pile, surrounded by walls, they found a large body of armed Highlanders drawn up before the gate.  \"These,\" said Vich Ian Vohr, carelessly, \"are a part of the clan whom I ordered out, to see that they were in a fit state to defend the country in such troublous times. Would Captain Waverley care to see them go through part of their exercise?\"  Thereupon the men, after showing their dexterity at drill, and their fine target-shooting, divided into two parties, and went through the incidents of a battle--the charge, the combat, the flight, and the headlong pursuit--all to the sound of the great warpipes.  Edward asked why, with so large a force, the Chief did not at once put down such robber bands as that of Donald Bean Lean.  \"Because,\" said the Chief, bitterly, \"if I did, I should at once be summoned to Stirling Castle to deliver up the few broadswords the government has left us. I should gain little by that. But there is dinner,\" he added, as if anxious to change the subject, \"let me show you the inside of my rude mansion.\"  The long and crowded dinner-table to which Edward sat down, told of the Chief's immense hospitality. After the meal, healths were drunk, and the bard of the clan recited a wild and thrilling poem in Gaelic--of which, of course, Edward could not understand so much as one word, though it excited the clansmen so that they sprang up in ecstasy, many of them waving their arms about in sympathy with the warlike verses. The Chief, exactly in the ancient manner, presented a silver cup full of wine to the minstrel. He was to drink the one and keep the other for himself.  After a few more toasts, Vich Ian Vohr offered to take Waverley up to be presented to his sister. They found Flora Mac-Ivor in her parlour, a plain and bare chamber with a wide prospect from the windows. She had her brother's dark curling hair, dark eyes, and lofty expression, but her expression seemed sweeter, though not, perhaps, softer. She was, however, even more fiercely Jacobite than her brother, and her devotion to \"the King over the Water\" (as they called King James) was far more unselfish than that of Vich Ian Vohr. Flora Mac-Ivor had been educated in a French convent, yet now she gave herself heart and soul to the good of her wild Highland clan and to the service of him whom she looked on as the true King.  She was gracious to Edward, and at the request of Fergus, told him the meaning of the war-song he had been listening to in the hall. She was, her brother said, famed for her translations from Gaelic into English, but for the present she could not be persuaded to recite any of these to Edward.  He had better fortune, however, when, finding Flora Mac-Ivor in a wild spot by a waterfall, she sang him, to the accompaniment of a harp, a song of great chiefs and their deeds which fired the soul of the young man. He could not help admiring--he almost began to love her from that moment.  After this reception, Edward continued very willingly at Glennaquoich--both because of his growing admiration for Flora, and because his curiosity increased every day as to this wild race, and the life so different from all that he had hitherto known. Nothing occurred for three weeks to disturb his pleasant dreams, save the chance discovery, made when he was writing a letter to the Baron, that he had somehow lost his seal with the arms of Waverley, which he wore attached to his watch. Flora was inclined to blame Donald Bean Lean for the theft, but the Chief scouted the idea. It was impossible, he said, when Edward was his guest, and, besides (he added slyly), Donald would never have taken the seal and left the watch. Whereupon Edward borrowed Vich Ian Vohr's seal, and, having despatched his letter, thought no more of the matter.  Soon afterwards, whilst Waverley still remained at Glennaquoich, there was a great hunting of the stag, to which Fergus went with three hundred of his clan to meet some of the greatest Highland chiefs, his neighbours. He took Edward with him, and the numbers present amounted almost to those of a formidable army. While the clansmen drove in the deer, the chiefs sat on the heather in little groups and talked in low tones. During the _drive_, the main body of the deer, in their desperation, charged right upon the place where the chief sportsmen were waiting in ambush. The word was given for every one to fling himself down on his face. Edward, not understanding the language, remained erect, and his life was only saved by the quickness of Vich Ian Vohr, who seized him and flung him down, holding him there by main force till the whole herd had rushed over them. When Edward tried to rise, he found that he had severely sprained his ankle.  However, among those present at the _drive_, there was found an old man, half-surgeon, half-conjurer, who applied hot fomentations, muttering all the time of the operation such gibberish as _Gaspar-Melchior-Balthazar-max-prax-fax!_  Thus it happened that, to his great disappointment, Edward was unable to accompany the clansmen and their chiefs any farther. So Vich Ian Vohr had Edward placed in a litter, woven of birch and hazel, and walked beside this rude couch to the house of an old man, a smaller chieftain, who, with only a few old vassals, lived a retired life at a place called Tomanrait.  Here he left Edward to recruit, promising to come back in a few days, in the hope that by that time Edward would be able to ride a Highland pony in order to return to Glennaquoich.  On the sixth morning Fergus returned, and Edward gladly mounted to accompany him. As they approached the castle, he saw, with pleasure, Flora coming to meet them.   II. MISFORTUNES NEVER COME SINGLE  The Chief's beautiful sister appeared very glad to see Edward, and, as her brother spoke a few hasty words to her in Gaelic, she suddenly clasped her hands, and, looking up to heaven, appeared to ask a blessing upon some enterprise.
