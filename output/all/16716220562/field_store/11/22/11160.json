He was sitting up now and his face was dry of tears. In fact he was laughing, not crying.  \"So she caught you, too, Mr. Wise-cop, poor little Angelina with the soft eyes.\" He broke down again, shaking with laughter.  \"What do you mean,\" I growled.  \"Don't you catch yet? The story she told you was true--except she twisted it around a bit. The whole plan, building the battleship, then stealing it, was _hers_. She pulled me into it, played me like an accordion. I fell in love with her, hating myself and happy at the same time. Well--I'm glad now it's over. At least I gave her a chance to get away, I owe her that much. Though I thought I would explode when she went into that innocence act!\"  The cold feeling was now a ball of ice that threatened to paralyze me. \"You're lying,\" I said hoarsely, and even I didn't believe it.  \"Sorry. That's the way it is. Your brain-boys will pick my skull to pieces and find out the truth anyway. There's no point in lying now.\"  \"We'll search the ship, she can't hide for long.\"  \"She won't have to,\" Pepe said. \"There's a fast scout we picked up, stowed in one of the holds. That must be it leaving now.\" We could feel the vibration, distantly through the floor.  \"The Navy will get her,\" I told him, with far more conviction than I felt.  \"Maybe,\" he said, suddenly slumped and tired, no longer laughing. \"Maybe they will. But I gave her her chance. It is all over for me now, but she knows that I loved her to the end.\" He bared his teeth in sudden pain. \"Not that she will care in the slightest.\"  I kept the gun on him and neither of us moved while the Navy ships pulled up and their boots stamped outside. I had captured my battleship and the raids were over. And I couldn't be blamed if the girl had slipped away. If she evaded the Navy ships, that was their fault, not mine.  I had my victory all right.  Then why did it taste like ashes in my mouth?  It's a big galaxy, but it wasn't going to be big enough to hide Angelina now. I can be conned once--but only once. The next time we met things were going to be _very_ different.   THE END     Transcriber's Note  This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ April 1960.

TALMAGE  One of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints   PUBLISHED BY THE CHURCH  SIXTH EDITION  TWENTY-EIGHTH TO THIRTIETH THOUSAND INCLUSIVE  Salt Lake City, Utah  Deseret Book Company  1922  Copyright  September 1915, December 1915, April 1916 and November 1916  By  JOSEPH F. SMITH  Trustee-in-Trust for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  Copyright, October, 1922  By  HEBER J. GRANT  Trustee-in-Trust for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints   Printed in the United States of America     PREFACE.   The scope of the subject presented in this work is expressed on the title page. It will be readily seen that the author has departed from the course usually followed by writers on the Life of Jesus Christ, which course, as a rule, begins with the birth of Mary's Babe and ends with the ascension of the slain and risen Lord from Olivet. The treatment embodied in these pages, in addition to the narrative of the Lord's life in the flesh comprizes the antemortal existence and activities of the world's Redeemer, the revelations and personal manifestations of the glorified and exalted Son of God during the apostolic period of old and in modern times, the assured nearness of the Lord's second advent, and predicted events beyond--all so far as the Holy Scriptures make plain.  It is particularly congruous and appropriate that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--the only Church that affirms authority based on specific revelation and commission to use the Lord's Holy Name as a distinctive designation--should set forth her doctrines concerning the Messiah and His mission.  The author of this volume entered upon his welcome service under request and appointment from the presiding authorities of the Church; and the completed work has been read to and is approved by the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve. It presents, however, the writer's personal belief and profoundest conviction as to the truth of what he has written. The book is published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  A characteristic feature of the work is the guidance afforded by modern scriptures and the explication of the Holy Writ of olden times in the light of present day revelation, which, as a powerful and well directed beam, illumines many dark passages of ancient construction.  The spirit of the sacredness inherent in the subject has been a constant companion of the writer throughout his pleasing labor, and he reverently invokes the same as a minister to the readers of the volume.
