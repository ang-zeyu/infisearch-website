Quick!\"  He caught hold of the boy, and started to urge him toward the rear door; but Lona Dawson placed herself squarely in their path, flinging up one hand.  \"Stop!\" she cried, her eyes flashing. \"You cannot pass! You shall not escape!\"  A look of admiration came into Frank's eyes, for she was very beautiful at that moment.  \"As you will,\" he bowed, gallantly. \"I may get my neck stretched by remaining, but your wish is law.\"  \"Well, I like that!\" roared the professor, in a manner that plainly indicated he did not like it.  \"Av ye choose ter make a fool av yersilf, Frank, it's not yer friends thot will see ye do it in this case!\" cried Barney.  The Irish lad grasped Frank by one arm, while the professor clutched the other, and they were about to rush him toward the door, for all of any opposition, when the door flew open with a bang, and a man pitched headlong into the room. This person carried a bundle, which burst open as he struck the floor, scattering its contents in all directions.  \"Moses in der pulrushes!\" exclaimed the nasal voice of Solomon Rosenbum, and the Jew sat up in the midst of the wreck. \"Dat vas vat I call comin' in lifely, vid der accent on der lifely!\"  \"The dure!\" shouted Barney. \"They're coming round to get in thot way!\"  The frightened station agent thrust his head out of an inner office, and said:  \"The door can be braced. The brace is just behind it.\"  Not a moment was to be lost, for the mob was at the very door, and would be pouring into the station in a moment. Barney sprang for the heavy brace, but he would have been too late if it had not been for the singular Jew.  Solomon leaped to his feet, sprang for the door, and planted his foot with terrific force in the stomach of the first man who was trying to enter, hurling that individual back against those immediately behind.  \"Good-tay!\" cried the Jew. \"Uf I don'd see you some more, vat vos der tifference!\"  Slam! The door went to solidly. Bang! The bar went against it, being held in position by heavy cleats on both door and floor.  \"Holdt der vort!\" rasped Solomon, with great satisfaction. \"Dot was very well tone. I didn't vant dose beople comin' und drampin' all ofer mine goots. Id vould haf ruint me.\"  The mob beat against the door, howling with baffled rage.  \"Thot wur a narrow escape, Frankie, me b'y!\" said Barney.  \"That's what it was,\" admitted Frank, who realized that his chance for life would have been less than one in a thousand if the crowd had burst into the room.  \"Vell, I don'd sharge nodding vor dat, uf you puy a goot pill uf goots vrom me,\" said the Jew.  \"The window!\" came from Professor Scotch. \"They are about to come through the window!\"  Crash! Jingle! Jangle! The window was smashed, and the mob was seen swarming toward it.  Suddenly, Solomon Rosenbum sprang toward the opening, a revolver in his hand.  \"Holdt on, mine friendts!\" he cried, waving the weapon. \"Uf anypody dried to get in py dis vindow, he vill ged shot, vid der accent on der shot!\"  \"Begobs, thot is roight!\" shouted Barney Mulloy, as he suddenly produced a \"gun,\" and took his place at Solomon's side. \"Kape off, me jools, av ye want ter kape whole skins!\"  The mob hesitated. Thus it had been baffled at every turn, and the mad heat of the moment was beginning to subside. Still, it could be aroused again in a twinkling.  Hank Kildare alone could not have protected his prisoner from the crowd, but he had done all one man could possibly do. Now, of a sudden, he retreated into the station, closing and bolting the door.  \"That,\" he said, with a breath of satisfaction, \"so fur, everything is all right. An' now it is ter see ef----\"  He was interrupted by pistol shots outside, and bullets began whistling in at the broken window.  With an exclamation of anger, the fearless sheriff flung his massive body into the window, roaring:  \"Hold up thar, you critters! Don't you know anything a tall? Thar is ladies in hyar, an' yer might shoot 'em ef yer keep flingin' lead round so promiscuous like!\"  \"We want Black Harry!\" yelled a voice.  \"Wa-al, ye'll hev ter want!\" returned the sheriff. \"You galoots know me purty well, an' ye know I ain't in ther habit o' talkin' crooked. I tells yer right yar an' now thet ye can't hev Black Harry. I offered ther reward fer ther critter, an' I'm goin' ter hold him, you bet! He'll be lodged in jail, ur Canadian County will be minus a sheriff!\"  It was plain that his words impressed them, but they were reluctant to give over the hope of lynching the boy prisoner.  \"Look yere, Kildare,\" said a thin, wiry, iron-jawed man, who wore a huge sombrero and leather breeches, \"I'm Bill Buckhorn, o' 'Rapahoe, an' thet's a place whar we don't 'low no critter like this yere Black Harry ter go waltzin' round more then sixteen brief second by ther clock. We ketches such cusses, an' then we takes 'em out an' shows 'em how ter do a jog on empty air. Over in 'Rapahoe we allows thet thar is ther way ter dispose o' sech cases, and I'm ready ter show you people o' Elreno ther purtiest way ter tie a runnin' knot in a hemp necktie. Whatever is ther use o' foolin' around an' dallyin' with ther law when it's right easy ter git rid o' critters like this yere Black Harry without no trouble a tall, an' make things lively in ther town at ther same time? Pass him out, sheriff, an' I'll agree not ter do ye ary bit o' damage!\"  \"Wa-al, you are kind!\" returned Kildare, contemptuously. \"You're mighty kind, an' I allows thet I 'preciates it. I reckons you galoots over in thet forsaken, 'way-back, never-heard-of hole called 'Rapahoe sets yerselves up fer a law unto ther rest o' Oklahoma an' all other parts o' creation! You allows thar don't nobody else but you critters know what is right an' proper, an' so you has ther cheek ter come over hyar an' tell us what ter do! You even offers ter show me how ter tie a runnin' knot in a rope, an' I will admit thet I've tied more knots o' thet kind then you ever heard of! Take my advice, my gentle stranger frum 'Rapahoe, an' go get right off ther earth, afore something happens ter yer which yer won't like none whatever!\"  This bit of sarcasm was appreciated by the assembled citizens of Elreno, and they raised a howl at Bill Buckhorn, scores of voices hurling derisive epithets at the lank stranger.  Buckhorn grew intensely angry, and he howled:  \"You galoots make me sick! You're short on fer hawse sense, an' thet's plain enough!\"  \"Take a tumble!\"  \"Puckachee!\"  \"All right! All right!\" cried the man from 'Rapahoe, waving his hands, each of which clutched a huge revolver. \"You kin run yer blamed old town ter suit yerselves, an' I allows thet Black Harry fools yer all an' gits erway! I hopes he does, an' I draws out o' this yere game right now.\"  He thrust his revolvers into leather holsters made to receive them, and strode away, forcing a passage through the crowd, and pretending not to hear the derisive epithets hurled at him.  Hank Kildare smiled, with grim satisfaction.  \"Thet wuz ther best thing could hev happened,\" he muttered. \"It took their 'tention erway fer a minute, an' now it's likely I kin talk them inter reason.\"  He tried it, without delay. He urged them to disperse, promising that Black Harry should be lodged in Elreno jail, and properly tried for his life.  \"This yar lynchin' is bad business,\" concluded the sheriff. \"I will allow thet I hev taken a hand in more than one lynchin' party, but I'm derned 'shamed o' it. Law is law, an' no gang o' human critters has a right ter take ther law in their han's. I hev swore never ter let one o' my prisoners be lynched, ef I kin help it, an' I'll set 'em free, an' furnish 'em with guns ter fight fer their lives, afore I'll see 'em strung up by a mob. At ther same time, I'd ruther be shot then forced ter do such a thing.\"  Kildare was so well known that every one who heard him felt sure he was not \"talking wind,\" that being something he never did.  There was muttering in the crowd. The worst passions of the mob had been aroused, and now it hated to be robbed of its prey.  \"Hank Kildare means whatever he says,\" declared more than one. \"He'll fight ter hold Black Harry.\"  Some cursed Kildare, and that aroused the anger of the sheriff's friends, so it seemed at one time as if the mob would fall into a pitched battle among themselves.  \"Let 'em fight,\" muttered the giant, who still held the broken window. \"Ef they git at it, I'll find some way ter slip 'em and put my man inter ther jail.\"  But they did not fight. Kildare called on them to disperse, and a few went away; but a great crowd lingered in sullen silence outside the station, waiting and watching.  \"They want ter git another look at Black Harry,\" muttered the sheriff, knitting his brows. \"Ef they do thet, they're likely ter break loose again, like a lot o' wild tigers. How kin I make 'em disperse, so I kin kerry him ter ther jail?\"  \"I will appeal to them,\" said a musical voice at his elbow.  He turned, and saw Lona Dawson there.  \"You?\"  \"Yes. It is possible they will listen to me.\"  \"They mought. I'd clean forgot you wuz hyar. Go ahead an' try yer luck, little one.\"  He stepped aside, and she appeared in the window. The moment she was seen, all muttering ceased in the crowd, and every one gave her attention.  \"Gentlemen,\" she began, speaking clearly and loud enough for all to hear, \"you must confess that I have as much interest as any one here in seeing this youthful ruffian brought to justice. I do not wish to see him lynched, but I wish him to receive such punishment as the law may give him.\"  \"Ther law is slow!\" cried a voice.  \"An' it often fails!\" came from another direction.  \"In this case there is no reason why it should fail, for there is proof enough to convict Black Harry. It will not fail.\"  \"He may escape from jail.\"  \"That is not likely. Now, for my sake, I ask you all to disperse--to allow the officers to take Black Harry to jail. If you do not disperse, I shall remain here, and I will"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22571"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Bravery (#5)"],["body","the prisoner with my own body and my life, for I am determined that he shall be legally tried and properly punished.\"  There was a moment of silence, and then a voice shouted:  \"Thar's stuff fer yer, pards! Ther leetle gal has clean grit, an' I'm fer doin' as she asks. Who's with me?\"  \"I am!\" a hundred voices seemed to roar.  \"Then come on. Good-by, leetle gal; we're goin'.\"  Every head was bared, and the crowd began to disperse with swiftness, so that, in a very few minutes, all had departed.  Then came the deputy sheriffs, with horses, and arrangements for conveying the prisoner to the jail were swiftly completed.  Frank had advised the professor and Barney not to be too outspoken, for fear they might also be arrested. He advised them to keep quiet, but to work for him to the best of their ability, and lose no time.  A handshake, a hurried parting, and the boy was borne away to jail.     CHAPTER VI.  SOLOMON SHOWS HIS NERVE.   The jail at Elreno was a wooden building, hastily constructed in the feverish days of the early boom, with many weak points and few strong ones.  Not for long were prisoners confined there, as \"justice\" in the new Territory moved swiftly, and an arrest was quickly followed by a trial.  Hank Kildare and the guard moved swiftly with their prisoner, avoiding the most public streets, and taking the boy to the jail by a roundabout way.  It was well they did so, for, although the mob had dispersed, at the request of Miss Dawson, the street along which it was believed the sheriff would take Black Harry was thronged with citizens eager to get a square look at the boy outlaw, who had become famous within ten days.  It is possible that Frank might have been taken along that street without trouble, but it is much more likely that the sight of him would have aroused the mob once more, and brought about another attempt at lynching.  In fact, Bill Buckhorn, the man from 'Rapahoe, had gathered an interested knot of tough-looking citizens about him, and he was dilating on the \"double derned foolishness\" of wasting time over a person like Black Harry by taking him to jail and giving him a trial.  \"Over in 'Rapahoe we hang 'em first an' try 'em arterward,\" boastingly declared the man in leather breeches. \"We find that thar is ther simplest way o' doin' business. Ef we makes a mistake, an' gits ther wrong galoot, nobody ever kicks up much o' a row over it, fer we're naterally lively over thar, an' we must hev somethin' ter 'muse us 'bout so often.  \"Now, ef we hed ketched this yere Black Harry--wa'al, say! Great cats! Does any critter hyar suspect thar'd been any monkey business with thet thar young gent? Wa'al, thar wouldn't--none whatever. Ef we couldn't found a tree handy, we'd hanged him ter ther corner o' a buildin', ur any old thing high enough ter keep his feet up off ther dirt.  \"Hyar in Elreno, ye'll take ther varmint ter jail, an' it's ten ter one he'll break out afore twenty-four hours, arter which he'll thumb his nasal protuberance at yer, an' go cayvortin' 'round after ther same old style, seekin' whomsoever he kin sock a bullet inter. Then you'll hate yerself, an' wish ye'd tooken my advice ter hang ther whelp, sheriff or no sheriff. You hear me chirp!\"  There were others who thought the same, and it was hinted that Hank Kildare might not be able to take his prisoner to the jail, after all.  Burchel Jones, the private detective, was in the crowd, and he hustled about, loudly proclaiming that he was the man who captured Black Harry. Bill Buckhorn heard him, stopped him, looked him over searchingly.  \"Look hyar!\" cried the man from 'Rapahoe. \"Is it a straight trail ye're layin' fer us?\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" asked the man with the foxy face, in a puzzled way.  \"Dern a tenderfoot thet can't understand plain United States!\" snorted Buckhorn. \"Ther same is most disgustin', so says I! Ye've got ter talk like a Sunday-school sharp, ur else ther onery critters don't hitch ter yer meanin'. Wat I wants ter know, tenderfoot, is ef yer tells ther truth w'en yer says yer roped Black Harry.\"  Jones stiffened up, assuming an air of injured dignity.  \"The truth! Why, I can't tell anything but the truth! It's an insult to hint that I tell anything but the truth!\"  \"W'at relation be you ter George?\"  \"George who?\"  \"Washington.\"  \"Sir, this attempt at frivolity is unseemly! Why should it seem remarkable for me to capture Black Harry?\"  \"Ef a galoot with his reputation let an onery tenderfoot like you rope him, it brings him down in my estimation complete!\"  \"I took him by surprise. I clapped a loaded revolver to his head, and he could do nothing but put up his hands.\"  \"Wa'al, you might ram a loaded cannon up ag'in my head, an' then I'd shoot yer six times afore you could pull ther trigger,\" boasted Buckhorn. \"Black Harry ain't got no license ter live arter this, an' I thinks it's ther duty o' ther citizens o' this yere town ter git tergether an' put him out o' his misery.\"  \"That ith wight,\" drawled a voice that seemed to give the man from 'Rapahoe an electric shock. \"The w'etch ith verwy dangerwous, and I weally hope you will hang him wight away, don't yer know. It ith dweadful to think that the cwecher might get away and stop a twain that I wath on, and wob me of awl my money--it ith thimply dweadful!\"  \"Great cats!\" howled Buckhorn, staring in amazement at the speaker. \"Is thar ary galoot hyar kin name thet critter?\"  \"Uf anypody vill name id, I vill gif id do 'em!\" cried a nasal voice, and Solomon Rosenbum, with his pack, newly bound up, was seen on the edge of the crowd, having just arrived.  \"My name, thir, ith Cholly Gwayson De Smythe,\" haughtily declared the dude. \"I do not apweciate youah inthulting manner, thir. I demand an apology, thir!\"  \"Apology!\" howled Buckhorn, looking savage. \"Of me?\"  \"Ye-ye-yeth, thir,\" faltered Cholly, shivering.  \"Wa'al, I'll be derned!\"  \"Do you apologize, thir?\"  \"Ter a thing like you? No!\"  \"Then I'll--I'll----\"  \"What?\"  \"Thee you lataw, thir.\"  And the dude took to his heels, breaking from the crowd and running for dear life, literally tearing up the dust of the street in his frantic effort to get away in a hurry.  \"Haw!\" snorted Bill Buckhorn. \"See ther varmint go! I reckon I'll hurry him up jest a little!\"  Then the man from 'Rapahoe jerked out a big revolver, and sent three or four bullets whistling past Cholly's ears, nearly frightening the poor fellow out of his clothes.  Buckhorn supplied the revolver with fresh cartridges, at the same time observing:  \"Over in 'Rapahoe such a derned freak as thet thar would be a reg'ler snap fer ther boys. They'd hev more fun with him then a funeral. Somehow, this yere place seems dead slow, an' it makes me long ter go back whar thar is a little sport now an' then.\"  \"Vell,\" said the Jew, with apparent honesty, \"v'y don'd you go pack? Maype uf you sdop a vile, you don'd pe aple to do dat.\"  \"Haw? What do you mean, Moses?\"  \"My name vas nod Moses.\"  \"Wa'al, it oughter be, an' so I'll call yeh thet.\"  \"All righd, Mouth; led her go.\"  \"Wat's thet?\" shouted Buckhorn, surprised. \"Whatever did you call me jest then, I want ter know.\"  \"Mouth.\"  \"Mouth!\"  \"Dat vas righd.\"  \"Thet ain't my name.\"  \"Vell, id oughter peen; your mouth vas der piggest bart uf you.\"  Buckhorn literally staggered. He looked as if he doubted his ears had heard correctly, and then, noting that the crowd was beginning to laugh, he leaped into the air, cracking his heels together, and roaring:  \"Whoop! Thet settles you, Moses! You'll hev a chance ter attend your own funeral ter-morre!\"  The Jew quietly put down his pack, spat on his hands, and said:  \"Shust come und see me, mine friendt, und I vill profe dat your mouth vas der piggest bart uf you.\"  \"I ain't goin' ter touch yer with my hands,\" declared the man from 'Rapahoe, once more producing the long-barreled revolver; \"but I'll shoot yer so full o' holes thet ye'll serve fer a milk-skimmer! Git down on yer marrerbones an' pray!\"  \"Look here, mine friendt,\" calmly said the Jew, as the crowd began to scatter to get out of the way of stray bullets, \"uf you shood ad me, id vill profe dat you vas a plowhardt und a cowart. Uf you shood ad me, der beople uf dis blace vill haf a goot excuse to holdt a lynchings.\"  \"Wa'al, I'm good fer this hull derned county! This town is too slow ter skeer me any ter mention. Git down!\"  \"Uf I don'd do dat?\"  \"I'll shoot yer legs out from under yer clean up ter ther knees!\"  \"Vell, then, I subbose I vill haf to--do this!\" Solomon had seemed on the point of kneeling, but, instead of doing so, he ducked, leaped in swiftly beneath the leveled revolver, caught Buckhorn by the wrist, and wrenched the weapon from his hand, flinging it aside with the remark:  \"I don'd vant to peen shot alretty, und, if you try dat again, you vill ged hurt pad, vid der accent on der pad!\"  Buckhorn seemed to be stupefied, and then, uttering another roar, he lunged at the Jew, trying to grapple Solomon with his hands.  \"I'll squeeze ther life out of yer!\" snarled the ruffian.  \"Oxcuse me uf I don'd lofe you vell enough to led you done that,\" said the Jew, nimbly skipping aside. \"Your nose shows you vas a greadt trinker; shust dry my electric punch.\"  Crack! The knuckles of the Jew struck under the ear of the man from 'Rapahoe. It was a beautiful blow, and Buckhorn was knocked over in a twinkling, striking heavily on his shoulder in the dust of the street.  The fall seemed to stun the man in leather breeches, but he soon sat up, and then, seeing Solomon waiting for him to rise, he asked:  \"Whar is it?\"  \"Vere vas vat?\"  \"Ther club you struck me with.\"  \"Righd here,\" said the Jew, holding up his clinched hand.  \"Haw! Ye don't mean ter say you didn't hit me with a club, or something like a hunk o' quartz?\"  \"Dat vas der ding vat I hit you vid, mine friendt. Shust ged up, und I vill profe id py hitting you again.\"  \"Say!\"  \"Vell?\"  \"I don't allow thet I'm as well as I might be, an' I ain't"]]]
