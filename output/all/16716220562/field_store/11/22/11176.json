If the treasure hunters could have seen what was before them they would not have started off in such a confident frame of mind.  The train was a little late, but presently it rolled into the station and the trunks and other baggage were hoisted aboard. Then came the final embraces and the boys climbed up the steps, followed by their father and Aleck.  \"Hurrah, we are off at last!\" cried Tom, and waved his cap enthusiastically. The others did the same, and then the train started and Oak Run quickly faded from sight. As the boys settled down in their seats a lad came from another car and moved swiftly toward them.  \"Songbird, by all that's lucky!\" cried Dick, and caught the other by the hand.  \"I thought you'd be on this train,\" answered Songbird Powell. \"I got your wire last night that you would stop off at New York. I am going to stop, too--to see an uncle of mine on a little business.\"  \"Then you'll travel with us to Philadelphia?\" queried Sam.  \"Sure.\"  \"Good! Tom was just saying he'd like some of the others along.\"  \"When I got your invitation I danced a jig of delight,\" went on Songbird. \"I just couldn't help it. Then I sat down and wrote----\"  \"A piece of poetry about it thirty-five stanzas long,\" finished Tom.  \"No, Tom, there are only six verses. You see I couldn't help it--I was so chuck full of enthusiasm. The poem begins like this:      \"'Twas a peaceful, summer night,     When all the stars were shining bright,     There came a rap on our house door     Which made me leap from bed to floor.     To me had come a telegram     From my old chums, Dick, Tom and Sam     Asking if I had a notion     To sail with them upon the ocean.     To skim along on waters blue----\"  \"And then and there get seasick, too,\" finished Tom. \"Don't forget to put in about the seasickness, Songbird--it always goes with a voyage, you know.\"  \"Seasick!\" snorted the would-be poet. \"Who ever heard of seasickness in a poem? The next line is this:      \"And see so many sights quite new,     To rest in quiet day by day     And watch the fishes at their play.\"  \"That's the first verse. The second begins----\"  \"Save it, Songbird, until we're on the yacht,\" interrupted Sam. \"We'll have more time to listen then.\"  \"All right,\" answered the would-be poet cheerfully. \"I want to fix up some of the lines anyhow. I've got 'harm' to rhyme with 'storm' and it doesn't quite suit me.\"  \"Never mind--a storm often does great harm,\" said Dick. \"You can easily fix it up by throwing out both words, you know.\"  After that the talk drifted around to the matter of the treasure hunt and Songbird was given some of the details, in which he became much interested. He declared that he thought the trip on the steam yacht would be even more interesting than the one on the houseboat had been.  \"We're after something definite this trip,\" he said. \"We've got something to look forward to--especially if that Sid Merrick starts a rival hunt.\"  \"We want to get ahead of Merrick,\" answered Dick. \"We want to locate Treasure Isle and get the gold and jewels before he knows what we are up to.\"  \"What's the name of the steam yacht?\"  \"The _Rainbow_.\"  \"That's a good name, for a rainbow is a sign of good promise,\" was Songbird's comment.  The party had to make one change of cars and had their dinner on the train. They arrived at the Grand Central Depot at half past two o'clock and the Rovers went to a nearby hotel, taking Aleck with them, while Songbird hurried off to transact his business with his uncle.  Mr. Rover had to meet some men who were interested in his mining ventures in the far west, and so, after accommodations had been obtained, he hurried off, leaving the boys to their own devices.  \"Let us take a stroll down Broadway,\" suggested Sam, to whom the sights of this busy thoroughfare were always interesting.  The others were willing, and they passed through Forty-second street to Broadway and then turned southward. The street was filled with wagons, trucks and trolley cars, and the sidewalk appeared to \"overflow with folks,\" as Sam said. At one point a man was giving some sort of an exhibition in a store window and here the crowd was so great they had to walk out into the gutter to get past.  \"I can tell you one thing,\" remarked Dick. \"There is after all but one New York and no other city is like it.\"  The boys walked slowly as far as Union Square and then sat down on one of the park benches to rest. Nearly all the benches were filled with people and in idle curiosity Dick began to scan the various types of men present, from bright, brisk clerks to fat and unshaved bummers, too lazy to work.  \"Hullo!\"  Dick uttered the exclamation so abruptly that Sam and Tom were startled.  \"What do you see?\" queried both.  \"Look there!\"  They gazed in the direction Dick pointed out and on a distant bench saw a youth of about Tom's age, but heavier-set, talking to a man who wore a rusty suit of brown and a peculiarly-shaped slouch hat.  \"Why, that's Tad Sobber!\" cried Tom.  \"So it is,\" added Sam. \"Who is that fellow with him?\"  \"I don't know, although his figure looks somewhat familiar to me,\" answered Dick.  \"What can Tad be doing in New York?\" questioned Tom. \"Do you suppose he is down here with Sid Merrick?\"  \"Perhaps.\"  \"Let's go over and see what he has to say for himself,\" suggested Sam. \"Maybe he'll run away when he sees us.\"  All of the boys were curious to know what the former bully of Putnam Hall might have to say for himself and they strode over to the bench upon which Sobber and the man in brown were sitting. They came up behind the pair.  \"I can't give you any money, Cuffer,\" they heard Tad Sobber say. \"You'll have to wait till my Uncle Sid gets here.\"  \"When will he get to New York?\"  \"To-morrow.\"  \"That fellow is Cuffer, the man who ran away from us at the old mill!\" cried Dick.  \"Let us catch him and hand him over to the police,\" returned Tom.  In his excitement he talked rather loudly and this attracted the attention of Cuffer and Tad Sobber.  \"The Rovers!\" cried Sobber, leaping to his feet in consternation. \"How did they get down to New York?\"  \"Who did you say?\" questioned Cuffer, and then looking at the three youths his face blanched. \"We must get away from here, and be quick about it!\"  He started to run and Dick and Sam went after him. The chase led to the lower end of the little park, and then Cuffer crossed Fourteenth street, and amid the crowd bound homeward for the day, pushed his way in the direction of the Third Avenue elevated railroad station.  In the meantime Tad Sobber started to run in another direction. But before he had taken a dozen steps Tom was on him and had him by the arm.  \"Stop, Sobber,\" he said shortly.  \"I won't! You let me go, Tom Rover.\"  \"I'll not let you go,\" answered Tom, firmly. \"And if you don't stand still I'll call a policeman and have you arrested.\"     CHAPTER IX  A CHASE ON THE BOWERY   Tom's threat to have Tad Sobber arrested caused the former bully of the school to pause and turn pale.  \"You--er--you don't mean that,\" he faltered. \"You can't have me arrested.\"  \"We'll see about that, Sobber.\"  \"I haven't done anything wrong.\"  \"Then why did you run away from Putnam Hall?\"  \"I had a right to leave. Captain Putnam wasn't treating me fairly.\"  \"You ran away on account of that snake affair--you can't deny it.\"  \"Humph!\"  \"That snake nearly killed Nick Pell. He isn't over it yet, altogether.\"  \"Bah! It wasn't the snake made Nick sick. He wasn't feeling well some days before the snake bit him.\"  \"It was the snake and nothing else put him in bed,\" answered Tom, warmly. \"And that is not all. You are in league with your uncle, who robbed my uncle of those traction company bonds.\"  \"I--er--I don't know anything about that matter,\" answered Sobber, hastily.  \"Well, I know all about it. You were with your uncle when he got away from us, and when he dropped the pocketbook containing the bonds.\"  \"Did you get the bonds back?\" asked Sobber, with sudden interest. It may be added here that Sid Merrick had gone back long after the chase to look for the pocketbook, but, of course, had been unable to get any trace of it.  \"We did.\"  \"My uncle didn't steal them. Your uncle put them in his hands to sell,\" went on Tad Sobber, with sudden boldness. \"It is all a cooked-up story about his running away with them. And it's a cooked-up story about his having anything to do with those freight thieves. My uncle is an honest man.\"  \"I know all about the freight affair, for I overheard him talking to some of the other thieves,\" answered Tom. \"Where is your uncle now?\"  \"Do you think I'd be fool enough to tell you?\"  \"Perhaps you might--if I had you locked up.\"  \"My uncle is a good long way from New York.\"  \"I heard you tell that man your uncle would be in the city to-morrow.\"  \"I didn't say any such thing!\" burst out Sobber, but his manner showed that he was very much disturbed.  \"You did say it. Where are you stopping?\"  \"Nowhere--I only got in a few hours ago.\"  \"Did you come here to meet Cuffer?\"  \"What do you know about Cuffer?\"  \"I know your uncle hired him and a man named Shelley to visit our farm and get some things belonging to my father.\"  \"Why, you're crazy! My uncle hardly knows Cuffer--and I never heard of a man named Shelley.\"  \"I am not crazy, and you know I am speaking the truth,\" answered Tom, calmly. \"Now you tell me where your uncle is or I'll have you arrested.\"  \"You'll not arrest me!\" exclaimed Tad Sobber, and with a sudden movement he twisted himself free from Tom's grasp. \"You follow me and you'll get the worst of it!\" he added, and darted across the park at top speed.

Up in the control room, Irene had been told, the needles of the dials danced against the red danger lines day and night.  She lay in bed and listened to the muffled, ceaseless roar of the drives and felt the singing vibration of the hull. _We should be almost safe by now_, she thought. _Athena is only forty days away._  Thinking of the new life awaiting them all made her too restless to lie still any longer. She got up, to sit on the edge of the bed and switch on the light. Dale was gone--he had been summoned to adjust one of the machines in the ship's X-ray room--and Billy was asleep, nothing showing of him above the covers but a crop of brown hair and the furry nose of his ragged teddy bear.  She reached out to straighten the covers, gently, so as not to awaken him. It happened then, the thing they had all feared.  From the stern of the ship came a jarring, deafening explosion. The ship lurched violently, girders screamed, and the light flicked out.  In the darkness she heard a rapid-fire _thunk-thunk-thunk_ as the automatic guard system slid inter-compartment doors shut against sections of the ship suddenly airless. The doors were still thudding shut when another explosion came, from toward the bow. Then there was silence; a feeling of utter quiet and motionlessness.  The fingers of fear enclosed her and her mind said to her, like the cold, unpassionate voice of a stranger: _The Gerns have found us._  The light came on again, a feeble glow, and there was the soft, muffled sound of questioning voices in the other compartments. She dressed, her fingers shaking and clumsy, wishing that Dale would come to reassure her; to tell her that nothing really serious had happened, that it had not been the Gerns.  It was very still in the little compartment--strangely so. She had finished dressing when she realized the reason: the air circulation system had stopped working.  That meant the power failure was so great that the air regenerators, themselves, were dead. And there were eight thousand people on the _Constellation_ who would have to have air to live....  The _Attention_ buzzer sounded shrilly from the public address system speakers that were scattered down the ship's corridors. A voice she recognized as that of Lieutenant Commander Lake spoke:  \"War was declared upon Earth by the Gern Empire ten days ago. Two Gern cruisers have attacked us and their blasters have destroyed the stern and bow of the ship. We are without a drive and without power but for a few emergency batteries. I am the _Constellation_'s only surviving officer and the Gern commander is boarding us to give me the surrender terms.  \"None of you will leave your compartments until ordered to do so. Wherever you may be, remain there. This is necessary to avoid confusion and to have as many as possible in known locations for future instructions. I repeat: you will not leave your compartments.\"  The speaker cut off. She stood without moving and heard again the words: _I am the _Constellation_'s only surviving officer...._  The Gerns had killed her father.  He had been second-in-command of the Dunbar expedition that had discovered the world of Athena and his knowledge of Athena was valuable to the colonization plans. He had been quartered among the ship's officers--and the Gern blast had destroyed that section of the ship.  She sat down on the edge of the bed again and tried to reorient herself; to accept the fact that her life and the lives of all the others had abruptly, irrevocably, been changed.  The Athena Colonization Plan was ended. They had known such a thing might happen--that was why the _Constellation_ had been made ready for the voyage in secret and had waited for months for the chance to slip through the ring of Gern spy ships; that was why she had raced at full speed, with her communicators silenced so there would be no radiations for the Gerns to find her by. Only forty days more would have brought them to the green and virgin world of Athena, four hundred light-years beyond the outermost boundary of the Gern Empire. There they should have been safe from Gern detection for many years to come; for long enough to build planetary defenses against attack. And there they would have used Athena's rich resources to make ships and weapons to defend mineral-depleted Earth against the inexorably increasing inclosure of the mighty, coldly calculating colossus that was the Gern Empire.  Success or failure of the Athena Plan had meant ultimate life or death for Earth. They had taken every precaution possible but the Gern spy system had somehow learned of Athena and the _Constellation_. Now, the cold war was no longer cold and the Plan was dust....         *       *       *       *       *  Billy sighed and stirred in the little-boy sleep that had not been broken by the blasts that had altered the lives of eight thousand people and the fate of a world.  She shook his shoulder and said, \"Billy.\"  He raised up, so small and young to her eyes that the question in her mind was like an anguished prayer: _Dear God--what do Gerns do to five-year-old boys?_  He saw her face, and the dim light, and the sleepiness was suddenly gone from him. \"What's wrong, Mama? And why are you scared?\"  There was no reason to lie to him.  \"The Gerns found us and stopped us.\"  \"Oh,\" he said. In his manner was the grave thoughtfulness of a boy twice his age, as there always was. \"Will they--will they kill us?\"  \"Get dressed, honey,\" she said. \"Hurry, so we'll be ready when they let Daddy come back to tell us what to do.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They were both ready when the _Attention_ buzzer sounded again in the corridors. Lake spoke, his tone grim and bitter:  \"There is no power for the air regenerators and within twenty hours we will start smothering to death. Under these circumstances I could not do other than accept the survival terms the Gern commander offered us.  \"He will speak to you now and you will obey his orders without protest. Death is the only alternative.\"  Then the voice of the Gern commander came, quick and harsh and brittle:  \"This section of space, together with planet Athena, is an extension of the Gern Empire. This ship has deliberately invaded Gern territory in time of war with intent to seize and exploit a Gern world. We are willing, however, to offer a leniency not required by the circumstances. Terran technicians and skilled workers in certain fields can be used in the factories we shall build on Athena. The others will not be needed and there is not room on the cruisers to take them.  \"Your occupation records will be used to divide you into two groups: the Acceptables and the Rejects. The Rejects will be taken by the cruisers to an Earth-type planet near here and left, together with the personal possessions in their compartments and additional, and ample, supplies. The Acceptables will then be taken on to Athena and at a later date the cruisers will return the Rejects to Earth.  \"This division will split families but there will be no resistance to it. Gern guards will be sent immediately to make this division and you will wait in your compartments for them. You will obey their orders promptly and without annoying them with questions. At the first instance of resistance or rebellion this offer will be withdrawn and the cruisers will go their way again.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In the silence following the ultimatum she could hear the soft, wordless murmur from the other compartments, the undertone of anxiety like a dark thread through it. In every compartment parents and children, brothers and sisters, were seeing one another for the last time....  The corridor outside rang to the tramp of feet; the sound of a dozen Gerns walking with swift military precision. She held her breath, her heart racing, but they went past her door and on to the corridor's end.  There she could faintly hear them entering compartments, demanding names, and saying, _\"Out--out!\"_ Once she heard a Gern say, \"Acceptables will remain inside until further notice. Do not open your doors after the"]]]
