The mediæval and Renaissance writers generally recognized them as Indian, and many of them expressly stated that they were of Hindu origin.[2] {3} Others argued that they were probably invented by the Chaldeans or the Jews because they increased in value from right to left, an argument that would apply quite as well to the Roman and Greek systems, or to any other. It was, indeed, to the general idea of notation that many of these writers referred, as is evident from the words of England's earliest arithmetical textbook-maker, Robert Recorde (c. 1542): \"In that thinge all men do agree, that the Chaldays, whiche fyrste inuented thys arte, did set these figures as thei set all their letters. for they wryte backwarde as you tearme it, and so doo they reade. And that may appeare in all Hebrewe, Chaldaye and Arabike bookes ... where as the Greekes, Latines, and all nations of Europe, do wryte and reade from the lefte hand towarde the ryghte.\"[3] Others, and {4} among them such influential writers as Tartaglia[4] in Italy and Köbel[5] in Germany, asserted the Arabic origin of the numerals, while still others left the matter undecided[6] or simply dismissed them as \"barbaric.\"[7] Of course the Arabs themselves never laid claim to the invention, always recognizing their indebtedness to the Hindus both for the numeral forms and for the distinguishing feature of place value. Foremost among these writers was the great master of the golden age of Bagdad, one of the first of the Arab writers to collect the mathematical classics of both the East and the West, preserving them and finally passing them on to awakening Europe. This man was Mo[h.]ammed the Son of Moses, from Khow[=a]rezm, or, more after the manner of the Arab, Mo[h.]ammed ibn M[=u]s[=a] al-Khow[=a]razm[=i],[8] a man of great {5} learning and one to whom the world is much indebted for its present knowledge of algebra[9] and of arithmetic. Of him there will often be occasion to speak; and in the arithmetic which he wrote, and of which Adelhard of Bath[10] (c. 1130) may have made the translation or paraphrase,[11] he stated distinctly that the numerals were due to the Hindus.[12] This is as plainly asserted by later Arab {6} writers, even to the present day.[13] Indeed the phrase _`ilm hind[=i]_, \"Indian science,\" is used by them for arithmetic, as also the adjective _hind[=i]_ alone.[14]  Probably the most striking testimony from Arabic sources is that given by the Arabic traveler and scholar Mohammed ibn A[h.]med, Ab[=u] 'l-R[=i][h.][=a]n al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i] (973-1048), who spent many years in Hindustan. He wrote a large work on India,[15] one on ancient chronology,[16] the \"Book of the Ciphers,\" unfortunately lost, which treated doubtless of the Hindu art of calculating, and was the author of numerous other works. Al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i] was a man of unusual attainments, being versed in Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, Hebrew, and Syriac, as well as in astronomy, chronology, and mathematics. In his work on India he gives detailed information concerning the language and {7} customs of the people of that country, and states explicitly[17] that the Hindus of his time did not use the letters of their alphabet for numerical notation, as the Arabs did. He also states that the numeral signs called _a[.n]ka_[18] had different shapes in various parts of India, as was the case with the letters. In his _Chronology of Ancient Nations_ he gives the sum of a geometric progression and shows how, in order to avoid any possibility of error, the number may be expressed in three different systems: with Indian symbols, in sexagesimal notation, and by an alphabet system which will be touched upon later. He also speaks[19] of \"179, 876, 755, expressed in Indian ciphers,\" thus again attributing these forms to Hindu sources.  Preceding Al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i] there was another Arabic writer of the tenth century, Mo[t.]ahhar ibn [T.][=a]hir,[20] author of the _Book of the Creation and of History_, who gave as a curiosity, in Indian (N[=a]gar[=i]) symbols, a large number asserted by the people of India to represent the duration of the world. Huart feels positive that in Mo[t.]ahhar's time the present Arabic symbols had not yet come into use, and that the Indian symbols, although known to scholars, were not current. Unless this were the case, neither the author nor his readers would have found anything extraordinary in the appearance of the number which he cites.  Mention should also be made of a widely-traveled student, Al-Mas`[=u]d[=i] (885?-956), whose journeys carried him from Bagdad to Persia, India, Ceylon, and even {8} across the China sea, and at other times to Madagascar, Syria, and Palestine.[21] He seems to have neglected no accessible sources of information, examining also the history of the Persians, the Hindus, and the Romans. Touching the period of the Caliphs his work entitled _Meadows of Gold_ furnishes a most entertaining fund of information. He states[22] that the wise men of India, assembled by the king, composed the _Sindhind_. Further on[23] he states, upon the authority of the historian Mo[h.]ammed ibn `Al[=i] `Abd[=i], that by order of Al-Man[s.][=u]r many works of science and astrology were translated into Arabic, notably the _Sindhind_ (_Siddh[=a]nta_). Concerning the meaning and spelling of this name there is considerable diversity of opinion. Colebrooke[24] first pointed out the connection between _Siddh[=a]nta_ and _Sindhind_. He ascribes to the word the meaning \"the revolving ages.\"[25] Similar designations are collected by Sédillot,[26] who inclined to the Greek origin of the sciences commonly attributed to the Hindus.[27] Casiri,[28] citing the _T[=a]r[=i]kh al-[h.]okam[=a]_ or _Chronicles of the Learned_,[29] refers to the work {9} as the _Sindum-Indum_ with the meaning \"perpetuum æternumque.\" The reference[30] in this ancient Arabic work to Al-Khow[=a]razm[=i] is worthy of note.  This _Sindhind_ is the book, says Mas`[=u]d[=i],[31] which gives all that the Hindus know of the spheres, the stars, arithmetic,[32] and the other branches of science. He mentions also Al-Khow[=a]razm[=i] and [H.]abash[33] as translators of the tables of the _Sindhind_. Al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i][34] refers to two other translations from a work furnished by a Hindu who came to Bagdad as a member of the political mission which Sindh sent to the caliph Al-Man[s.][=u]r, in the year of the Hejira 154 (A.D. 771).  The oldest work, in any sense complete, on the history of Arabic literature and history is the _Kit[=a]b al-Fihrist_, written in the year 987 A.D., by Ibn Ab[=i] Ya`q[=u]b al-Nad[=i]m. It is of fundamental importance for the history of Arabic culture. Of the ten chief divisions of the work, the seventh demands attention in this discussion for the reason that its second subdivision treats of mathematicians and astronomers.[35]  {10}  The first of the Arabic writers mentioned is Al-Kind[=i] (800-870 A.D.), who wrote five books on arithmetic and four books on the use of the Indian method of reckoning. Sened ibn `Al[=i], the Jew, who was converted to Islam under the caliph Al-M[=a]m[=u]n, is also given as the author of a work on the Hindu method of reckoning. Nevertheless, there is a possibility[36] that some of the works ascribed to Sened ibn `Al[=i] are really works of Al-Khow[=a]razm[=i], whose name immediately precedes his. However, it is to be noted in this connection that Casiri[37] also mentions the same writer as the author of a most celebrated work on arithmetic.  To Al-[S.][=u]f[=i], who died in 986 A.D., is also credited a large work on the same subject, and similar treatises by other writers are mentioned. We are therefore forced to the conclusion that the Arabs from the early ninth century on fully recognized the Hindu origin of the new numerals.  Leonard of Pisa, of whom we shall speak at length in the chapter on the Introduction of the Numerals into Europe, wrote his _Liber Abbaci_[38] in 1202. In this work he refers frequently to the nine Indian figures,[39] thus showing again the general consensus of opinion in the Middle Ages that the numerals were of Hindu origin.  Some interest also attaches to the oldest documents on arithmetic in our own language. One of the earliest {11} treatises on algorism is a commentary[40] on a set of verses called the _Carmen de Algorismo_, written by Alexander de Villa Dei (Alexandra de Ville-Dieu), a Minorite monk of about 1240 A.D. The text of the first few lines is as follows:   \"Hec algorism' ars p'sens dicit' in qua   Talib; indor[um] fruim bis quinq; figuris.[41]  \"This boke is called the boke of algorim or augrym after lewder use. And this boke tretys of the Craft of Nombryng, the quych crafte is called also Algorym. Ther was a kyng of Inde the quich heyth Algor & he made this craft.... Algorisms, in the quych we use teen figurys of Inde.\"         *       *       *       *       *   {12}  CHAPTER II  EARLY HINDU FORMS WITH NO PLACE VALUE  While it is generally conceded that the scientific development of astronomy among the Hindus towards the beginning of the Christian era rested upon Greek[42] or Chinese[43] sources, yet their ancient literature testifies to a high state of civilization, and to a considerable advance in sciences, in philosophy, and along literary lines, long before the golden age of Greece. From the earliest times even up to the present day the Hindu has been wont to put his thought into rhythmic form. The first of this poetry--it well deserves this name, being also worthy from a metaphysical point of view[44]--consists of the Vedas, hymns of praise and poems of worship, collected during the Vedic period which dates"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22599"],["title","The Hindu-Arabic Numerals (#2)"],["body"," approximately 2000 B.C. to 1400 B.C.[45] Following this work, or possibly contemporary with it, is the Brahmanic literature, which is partly ritualistic (the Br[=a]hma[n.]as), and partly philosophical (the Upanishads). Our especial interest is {13} in the S[=u]tras, versified abridgments of the ritual and of ceremonial rules, which contain considerable geometric material used in connection with altar construction, and also numerous examples of rational numbers the sum of whose squares is also a square, i.e. \"Pythagorean numbers,\" although this was long before Pythagoras lived. Whitney[46] places the whole of the Veda literature, including the Vedas, the Br[=a]hma[n.]as, and the S[=u]tras, between 1500 B.C. and 800 B.C., thus agreeing with Bürk[47] who holds that the knowledge of the Pythagorean theorem revealed in the S[=u]tras goes back to the eighth century B.C.  The importance of the S[=u]tras as showing an independent origin of Hindu geometry, contrary to the opinion long held by Cantor[48] of a Greek origin, has been repeatedly emphasized in recent literature,[49] especially since the appearance of the important work of Von Schroeder.[50] Further fundamental mathematical notions such as the conception of irrationals and the use of gnomons, as well as the philosophical doctrine of the transmigration of souls,--all of these having long been attributed to the Greeks,--are shown in these works to be native to India. Although this discussion does not bear directly upon the {14} origin of our numerals, yet it is highly pertinent as showing the aptitude of the Hindu for mathematical and mental work, a fact further attested by the independent development of the drama and of epic and lyric poetry.  It should be stated definitely at the outset, however, that we are not at all sure that the most ancient forms of the numerals commonly known as Arabic had their origin in India. As will presently be seen, their forms may have been suggested by those used in Egypt, or in Eastern Persia, or in China, or on the plains of Mesopotamia. We are quite in the dark as to these early steps; but as to their development in India, the approximate period of the rise of their essential feature of place value, their introduction into the Arab civilization, and their spread to the West, we have more or less definite information. When, therefore, we consider the rise of the numerals in the land of the Sindhu,[51] it must be understood that it is only the large movement that is meant, and that there must further be considered the numerous possible sources outside of India itself and long anterior to the first prominent appearance of the number symbols.  No one attempts to examine any detail in the history of ancient India without being struck with the great dearth of reliable material.[52] So little sympathy have the people with any save those of their own caste that a general literature is wholly lacking, and it is only in the observations of strangers that any all-round view of scientific progress is to be found. There is evidence that primary schools {15} existed in earliest times, and of the seventy-two recognized sciences writing and arithmetic were the most prized.[53] In the Vedic period, say from 2000 to 1400 B.C., there was the same attention to astronomy that was found in the earlier civilizations of Babylon, China, and Egypt, a fact attested by the Vedas themselves.[54] Such advance in science presupposes a fair knowledge of calculation, but of the manner of calculating we are quite ignorant and probably always shall be. One of the Buddhist sacred books, the _Lalitavistara_, relates that when the B[=o]dhisattva[55] was of age to marry, the father of Gopa, his intended bride, demanded an examination of the five hundred suitors, the subjects including arithmetic, writing, the lute, and archery. Having vanquished his rivals in all else, he is matched against Arjuna the great arithmetician and is asked to express numbers greater than 100 kotis.[56] In reply he gave a scheme of number names as high as 10^{53}, adding that he could proceed as far as 10^{421},[57] all of which suggests the system of Archimedes and the unsettled question of the indebtedness of the West to the East in the realm of ancient mathematics.[58] Sir Edwin Arnold, {16} in _The Light of Asia_, does not mention this part of the contest, but he speaks of Buddha's training at the hands of the learned Vi[s.]vamitra:    \"And Viswamitra said, 'It is enough,   Let us to numbers. After me repeat   Your numeration till we reach the lakh,[59]   One, two, three, four, to ten, and then by tens   To hundreds, thousands.' After him the child   Named digits, decads, centuries, nor paused,   The round lakh reached, but softly murmured on,   Then comes the k[=o]ti, nahut, ninnahut,   Khamba, viskhamba, abab, attata,   To kumuds, gundhikas, and utpalas,   By pundar[=i]kas into padumas,   Which last is how you count the utmost grains   Of Hastagiri ground to finest dust;[60]   But beyond that a numeration is,   The K[=a]tha, used to count the stars of night,   The K[=o]ti-K[=a]tha, for the ocean drops;   Ingga, the calculus of circulars;   Sarvanikchepa, by the which you deal   With all the sands of Gunga, till we come   To Antah-Kalpas, where the unit is   The sands of the ten crore Gungas.  If one seeks   More comprehensive scale, th' arithmic mounts   By the Asankya, which is the tale   Of all the drops that in ten thousand years   Would fall on all the worlds by daily rain;   Thence unto Maha Kalpas, by the which   The gods compute their future and their past.'\"  {17}  Thereupon Vi[s.]vamitra [=A]c[=a]rya[61] expresses his approval of the task, and asks to hear the \"measure of the line\" as far as y[=o]jana, the longest measure bearing name. This given, Buddha adds:    ... \"'And master! if it please,   I shall recite how many sun-motes lie   From end to end within a y[=o]jana.'   Thereat, with instant skill, the little prince   Pronounced the total of the atoms true.   But Viswamitra heard it on his face   Prostrate before the boy; 'For thou,' he cried,   'Art Teacher of thy teachers--thou, not I,   Art G[=u]r[=u].'\"  It is needless to say that this is far from being history. And yet it puts in charming rhythm only what the ancient _Lalitavistara_ relates of the number-series of the Buddha's time. While it extends beyond all reason, nevertheless it reveals a condition that would have been impossible unless arithmetic had attained a considerable degree of advancement.  To this pre-Christian period belong also the _Ved[=a][.n]gas_, or \"limbs for supporting the Veda,\" part of that great branch of Hindu literature known as _Sm[r.]iti_ (recollection), that which was to be handed down by tradition. Of these the sixth is known as _Jyoti[s.]a_ (astronomy), a short treatise of only thirty-six verses, written not earlier than 300 B.C., and affording us some knowledge of the extent of number work in that period.[62] The Hindus {18} also speak of eighteen ancient Siddh[=a]ntas or astronomical works, which, though mostly lost, confirm this evidence.[63]  As to authentic histories, however, there exist in India none relating to the period before the Mohammedan era (622 A.D.). About all that we know of the earlier civilization is what we glean from the two great epics, the Mah[=a]bh[=a]rata[64] and the R[=a]m[=a]yana, from coins, and from a few inscriptions.[65]  It is with this unsatisfactory material, then, that we have to deal in searching for the early history of the Hindu-Arabic numerals, and the fact that many unsolved problems exist and will continue to exist is no longer strange when we consider the conditions. It is rather surprising that so much has been discovered within a century, than that we are so uncertain as to origins and dates and the early spread of the system. The probability being that writing was not introduced into India before the close of the fourth century B.C., and literature existing only in spoken form prior to that period,[66] the number work was doubtless that of all primitive peoples, palpable, merely a matter of placing sticks or cowries or pebbles on the ground, of marking a sand-covered board, or of cutting notches or tying cords as is still done in parts of Southern India to-day.[67]  {19}  The early Hindu numerals[68] may be classified into three great groups, (1) the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i], (2) the Br[=a]hm[=i], and (3) the word and letter forms; and these will be considered in order.  The Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] numerals are found in inscriptions formerly known as Bactrian, Indo-Bactrian, and Aryan, and appearing in ancient Gandh[=a]ra, now eastern Afghanistan and northern Punjab. The alphabet of the language is found in inscriptions dating from the fourth century B.C. to the third century A.D., and from the fact that the words are written from right to left it is assumed to be of Semitic origin. No numerals, however, have been found in the earliest of these inscriptions, number-names probably having been written out in words as was the custom with many ancient peoples. Not until the time of the powerful King A['s]oka, in the third century B.C., do numerals appear in any inscriptions thus far discovered; and then only in the primitive form of marks, quite as they would be found in Egypt, Greece, Rome, or in {20} various other parts of the world. These A['s]oka[69] inscriptions, some thirty in all, are found in widely separated parts of India, often on columns, and are in the various vernaculars that were familiar to the people. Two are in the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] characters, and the rest in some form of Br[=a]hm[=i]. In the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] inscriptions only four numerals have been found, and these are merely vertical marks for one, two, four, and five, thus:    |     ||     |||     ||||  In the so-called ['S]aka inscriptions, possibly of the first century B.C., more numerals are found, and in more highly developed form, the right-to-left system appearing,"]]]
