That he could take on the road an hour or two later, when he felt safe from interruption. He rose and shook himself. This was his scanty toilet. Next he must take the bag from its place of concealment, and then he could commence his journey.  While uncovering the bag, Crane did not discover that it had been tampered with, partly because it was still there. It was natural to suppose that, if discovered by a third party, it would be carried away. He did not even open the bag, not thinking it necessary.  \"John Miles hasn't waked up yet,\" he said to himself with a smile. \"When he does, there'll be some swearing, I'll be bound. You're a good boy, John Miles, but you ain't so smart as you think you are. I think I have got the start of you this time.\"  Bill Crane rode off smiling.  His course led him by the camp of the Chinamen. Early as it was they were astir. Ah Sin saw the rider, and at once recognized him as the man he had robbed. How could Crane know that those pleasant-faced barbarians had served him such a trick?  \"Hallo, Chinamen!\" he said aloud. \"Have they got out here already? I'll speak to them. Hallo, John!\" he said, halting his horse, for even then every Chinaman was John.  \"How do, John?\" replied Ah Sin, smiling blandly.  \"My name isn't John, but no matter. What are you two doing?\"  \"Looking for gold,\" was the reply.  \"Do you find any?\"  \"Velly little. Bad place.\"  \"Have you been in San Francisco?\"  \"Yes, John.\"  \"Why didn't you stay there?\"  \"Too many Chinamen--too little washee,--washee.\"  \"What have you got in the way of provisions? Mine are stale. I'd like to buy some of you.\"  \"We have got a little lice, John.\"  \"Got a little what? Oh, I know: you mean rice. Why don't you pronounce your English better?\"  \"Because Chinamen not 'Melican men.\"  \"Then I suppose I may as well be moving on, as I can't get anything out of you. Oh, have you got any tea, John?\"  \"Yes, John.\"  \"Got any made?\"  Ah Sin produced a cup, for he and his friend had just prepared their breakfast, and being warm, Bill Crane gulped it down with a relish.  \"After all, a man needs some warm drink in the morning,\" he said to himself. \"How much to pay, John?\"  \"Nothing, John. 'Melican man welcome.\"  \"John, you're a gentleman, or rather both of you are gentlemen, even if you are heathens. I'll remember you in my prayers.\"  The eminent Christian, Bill Crane, rode off from the Chinese camp, calmly confident of his moral superiority to the two benighted heathen whom he left behind him. Whether he remembered his promise to intercede for them in prayer is a little doubtful, or would have been, if he had had occasion to pray himself. It is to be feared that prayer and William Crane had long been strangers.  As Crane rode away, the two Chinamen exchanged glances. A gentle smile lighted up their yellow faces, and they were doubtless thinking of something pleasant. They exchanged a few guttural remarks which I should like to be able to translate, for they doubtless referred to Bill Crane, whom they had kindly supplied with a cup of tea gratis. Yet, perhaps, considering all things, it was the dearest cup of tea Crane had ever drank, since it was the only return he got for a bag of gold-dust worth over two hundred dollars. But there is an old saying, \"Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise.\" Crane was just as happy as if the bag really contained gold-dust. But this happy ignorance was not to last long.  After riding five or six miles our traveller thought he might venture to dismount for rest and refreshment. He selected as his breakfast-table the green sward beside a sparkling mountain streamlet. He dismounted, permitting his horse to graze while he took out the stale provisions which must constitute his morning meal. They were not very palatable, and Crane sighed for the breakfasts of old, the memory of which at this moment was very tantalizing. But he comforted himself with the thought that he had the means of making up for his enforced self-denial when he reached San Francisco.  This naturally led him to open the bag, and feast his eyes over his easily obtained wealth. He untied the string, and with a smile of pleased anticipation peered at the contents.  His face changed suddenly.  Was he dreaming? In place of the shining dust, his eyes rested on--sand.  He hastily thrust in his finger, and stirred the grains. But nothing else was to be discovered. The bag contained nothing but worthless sand.  Crane stared at the deceptive bag in the most lugubrious astonishment. Surely the bag contained gold-dust when he concealed it. There could be no doubt on that point, for he had opened it and seen the contents for himself. But in that case, how could such a change have been effected in one night? It had not been touched; so, at any rate, he believed. He had found it in the morning in the exact spot where he had placed it overnight, and yet--  Bill Crane took another look at the contents of the bag, hoping that he had been deceived by some ocular delusion, but the second examination brought him no comfort. He sank back, feeling in a state of mental and bodily collapse.  Never was poor thief so utterly bewildered as Bill Crane. He could almost believe that some magical transformation had been practiced at his expense. Was it possible, he thought, that John Miles, discovering his loss, had visited him, and played this trick upon him? He could not believe this. It was not in accordance with John's direct, straightforward nature. Instead of acting in this secret manner, he would have sternly charged Crane with the robbery, and punished him on the spot. Leaving him out of the account, then, the mystery deepened. It never occurred to Crane to suspect the Chinamen who had so hospitably furnished him with a cup of tea. Even if they had come into his mind, he would have been puzzled to account for their knowledge of his having the bag in his possession.  Bill Crane was decidedly unhappy. His glowing anticipations of prosperity, based upon the capital contained in the bag, were rudely broken in upon, and the airy fabric of his hopes dashed to the ground. He felt that fortune had been unkind--that he was a deeply injured man. Had his claim to the stolen property been the best possible, he could not have felt the injustice of fate more keenly.  \"It's always the way!\" he exclaimed in deep dejection. \"I always was unlucky. Just as I thought I was on my feet again, this cursed gold-dust turns to sand. Here am I out in the wilderness without an ounce to my name. I don't know what to do. I'd give a good deal, if I had it, to find out what became of the gold-dust.\"  As he spoke, Crane, in a fit of ill-temper, kicked the unlucky bag to a distance, and slowly and disconsolately mounting his horse, plodded on his way. All his cheerfulness was gone. It was some comfort, but still scant, to think that John Miles was as unlucky as himself. Both had become penniless tramps, and were alike the sport of Fortune. There was a difference in respect to their desert, however. John Miles may rightly claim the reader's sympathy, while Bill Crane must be considered to have met with a disaster which he richly deserved.     CHAPTER IX.  CLEANED OUT.   John Miles slept long, and awoke feeling refreshed and cheerful. He had a healthy organization, and never failed to eat and sleep well. Like Crane, he had no toilet to make, but sprang to his feet already dressed.  His first thought was naturally of his treasure. His heart gave a quick bound when he failed to discover it in the place where he remembered to have put it. In dismay he instituted a search, which, of course, proved unavailing.  \"Who could have taken it?\" thought Miles, large drops of perspiration gathering upon his forehead.  All about him was loneliness. He could see no signs of life. Yet the bag could not have gone away of itself. There was certainly human agency in the matter.  Miles confessed to himself with sadness that he had been imprudent to leave the bag where it would naturally excite the cupidity of any passing adventurer. That it must have been taken by such a one seemed evident. In that case, the chance of recovering it seemed slender enough. Nevertheless, John Miles decided to make an effort, hopeless as it was, to discover the whereabouts of his lost property.  \"If it had been mine, I wouldn't have cared so much,\" he said to himself, with a sigh; \"but poor Tom's money is gone too. I will make it up to him if I live, but I am afraid his father will be inconvenienced by the delay.\"  Miles made preparations for his departure, and strode away, looking searchingly to the right and left in search of something that might throw light upon his loss. Presently he espied the two Chinamen. Could they have taken it? He would at any rate speak to them.  \"Good-morning, John,\" he said, when he came within hearing distance.  Ah Sin bobbed his head, and repeated \"Good-morning, John.\"  \"Do you live here?\"  \"Yes, we washee-washee for gold.\"  \"Does anyone else live near by?\"  The two inclined their heads, and answered in the negative.  \"Have you seen anyone pass last night or this morning?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Ah Sin. \"'Melican man stay all nightee--over there. Chinaman give him a cup of tea this morning.\"  \"How long ago?\" asked Miles, eagerly.  \"Two hours,\" answered Ah Jim.  \"In what direction did he go?\"  The two Chinamen readily told him.  Miles decided to tell them of the loss of his bag of gold-dust. Possibly they could throw some light upon his loss.  \"Some one stole a small bag of dust from me last night,\" he said. \"I suspect it was the man you describe. Did he appear to have any such article with him?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Ah Sin,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22669"],["title","The Young Miner; Or, Tom Nelson in California (#7)"],["body"," who, with natural cunning, saw that this information would divert suspicion from them. \"It was so large,\" indicating the size with his hands.  Of course his description was accurate, for he had very good reason to know the size of the bag.  \"He must have been the thief,\" said Miles, eagerly. \"In what direction did you say he went?\"  Ah Sin pointed to the west.  \"I will follow him. It is on my way. If I catch the villain, it will be the worse for him.\"  \"He velly bad man,\" said Ah Sin, sympathizingly.  \"That's where you are right, my heathen friend. Well, good-morning, John. I am much obliged to you for your information.\"  \"Velly welcome, John.\"  As John Miles rode away, Ah Sin turned to his friend Ah Jim, and remarked,--  \"S'pose he catch him, he kill him.\"  \"All lightee!\" returned Ah Jim. \"He velly bad man, he thief.\"  The two Chinamen exchanged glances. If they had been white men, there would have been a smile or a wink, but these children of Confucius looked so serenely virtuous, so innocent of guile, that the most experienced detective would have seen nothing in their faces indicating any guilty knowledge of the lost treasure. But, guileless as they seemed, they had proved more than a match for Bill Crane and his victim.         *       *       *       *       *  John Miles rode away with a faint hope that he might overtake the man, whoever he might be, who had stolen his precious bag. In due time he reached the spot where Crane had examined the bag, and on discovering its worthless contents, had thrown it away. The thief had not taken the trouble to empty it.  When Miles saw it he hurried to it, hoping he might find some of the treasure inside. Of course he was disappointed, and at the same time bewildered.  \"This is certainly my bag,\" he said to himself. \"Here are my initials, J. M. Then there are other marks well known to me. I could swear to it anywhere. But how does it happen that it is full of sand, and why has the thief thrown it away? That beats me!\"  Miles decided that for some reason unknown the thief had transferred its contents to some other bag--perhaps his own--and then had discarded the original one, in wanton humor filling it instead with sand.  \"He may have been afraid it would be found on him,\" thought Miles. \"The marks on the bag would have been evidence enough to condemn him. By throwing away my bag he thinks himself safe.\"  His solution of the puzzle was ingenious, but as we know he erred in two respects. Bill Crane had not filled the bag with sand and thrown it away from prudential considerations, nor had he profited by the theft he had committed. He had been as badly outwitted as his victim, and the profit had gone to the bland and obliging Chinamen, who had thus far escaped suspicion.  John Miles slackened his rein, and thought seriously and sadly of the position to which he was reduced. What was he to do? He was, in the expressive language of the country, \"cleaned out,\" and brought to a pass where he must begin life over again, with the disadvantage of being seventy-five dollars in debt, for he was resolved that Tom's loss should be paid back to the uttermost penny.  Presently philosophy came to his aid.  \"It might have been worse,\" he reflected. \"Two hundred dollars is too large a sum to lose, but it wont take long to make up if I have any sort of luck. I wish I were in San Francisco. It may trouble me to get there without means.\"  When misfortune comes it is always best to look it manfully in the face, and not to shrink from or over estimate it. John Miles had a strong, healthy nature, with a good deal of confidence in his own resources, and in an hour or two he was again looking hopefully forward to the future. Not that he cherished a hope of recovering his lost money. There seemed to be no way of identifying it, even if he should track the thief. One ounce of gold-dust looks like another, and there is no way of distinguishing individual property in that form.  John Miles pushed on slowly. About noon he found himself threading a narrow ca隳n, shaded by gigantic redwood tress, with steep, almost perpendicular sides, with here and there a narrow streamlet descending in a cascade, and lighting up the darkened scene with its silvery reflections.  \"This is a pretty spot, but it would be lonely to live here,\" thought Miles. \"Yet,\" shading his eyes, \"there seems to be a cabin of some sort. Is it possible that anybody lives in this ca隳n?\"  Ten minutes' ride brought him to a rude cabin, with a gigantic tree spreading at a great height protecting branches over it. That it was inhabited was clear, for in front of it stood a strongly built, robust woman, who seemed to be nearing forty.  She bent a searching look upon the intruder, who bent his head courteously.  \"Good-morning, ma'am,\" said Miles.  \"Good-morning, stranger,\" was the reply. \"Where might you be going?\"  \"I am on my way to the city. Am I on the right track?\"  \"I reckon so.\"  \"Do you live here--alone?\" asked John Miles, in some curiosity.  \"It looks like it, doesn't it?\" returned the woman. \"I've been alone since my man pegged out.\"  \"Is that long?\"  \"A matter of three weeks.\"  \"I sympathize with you,\" said Miles. \"You must be very lonely.\"  \"Yes,\" said the widow. \"Jim was good company, and I feel kind of lonesome without him, you better believe.\"  \"There isn't much sentiment there,\" thought Miles. \"She doesn't appear to be heart-broken. Do you mean to stay here alone?\" he inquired. \"Are you not afraid?\"  \"What's there to be afraid of?\"  \"Some tramp or adventurer might attack and injure, or at least rob you.\"  \"Look here, stranger! do you see that?\" and the woman produced a revolver. \"Do you see that shooting-iron?\"  \"It looks as if it might be a good one,\" said Miles, who began to think the woman better able to take care of herself than he had at first supposed.  \"You bet it is! I know how to use it, too. If one of them tramps gets in front of it, and sasses me, he'd better say his prayers mighty quick, for he'll need 'em. He needn't reckon much on my being a woman. I can shoot jest as true as my man could when he was alive.\"     CHAPTER X.  A CALIFORNIA WIDOW.   John Miles eyed the woman curiously. There did not seem much that was feminine left in her. Life in the wilderness had made her as bold and self-reliant as a man. She was not compelled to plead for woman's rights. She resolutely took a man's rights, and was prepared to maintain them against all comers.  \"I rather think you can take care of yourself, ma'am,\" he said.  \"You can bet your bottom dollar on that, stranger,\" said the woman, cheerfully. \"Brown--that's my husband--knew what I was. We was ekal partners--Brown and me--and he knew too much to tread on me.\"  \"I'm glad I wasn't Brown,\" thought John Miles. \"When I marry, it'll be a woman, and not a man in petticoats.\"  \"If you're hungry, stranger,\" said the woman, \"just jump off that horse of yours, and come in. I can give you a square meal, and I reckon you haven't had one lately.\"  \"You are right, Mrs. Brown,\" said Miles, dismounting with alacrity. \"My provisions are dry and stale, and I shall enjoy a square meal amazingly. But I ought to tell you that last night I was robbed of a bag of gold-dust, and I have nothing to pay you.\"  \"Who asks for pay?\" returned the woman. \"I don't keep a hotel, but I'm tired of eating alone. I want to see how it seems to have a man setting opposite me agin. So come in, and I won't keep you waiting long.\"  \"Thank you, Mrs. Brown. If you don't mind, I'll light my pipe, and sit out here till I've had a smoke.\"  \"You can smoke inside if you want to. I always let Brown. It makes me feel better, now that he's pegged out, that I didn't deny him any of his little comforts.\"  \"Clearly Mrs. Brown was a considerate wife,\" thought Miles; \"but she doesn't look like a woman to fall in love with.\"  Tying his horse, he threw himself down on the grass, and enjoyed the luxury of a smoke while Mrs. Brown was heard bustling about inside, preparing the square meal which she had promised to her unexpected guest.  Presently she reappeared.  \"The victuals is ready, if you are, stranger,\" she said.  \"I am ready, Mrs. Brown,\" said Miles, rising at once, and entering the cabin.  The cabin was rough, and ill-adapted to a fastidious tenant, but it looked comfortable. What attracted Miles most, however, was a table set in the middle of the floor, covered with a substantial and appetizing meal. Mrs. Brown was a fair cook--perhaps her only feminine accomplishment. She placed Miles at the head of the table, and seated herself opposite him. She watched his attacks upon the fare she had provided with evident satisfaction.  \"I hope you like it,\" she said.  \"Mrs. Brown, I haven't tasted anything so good for a long time.\"  She nodded, with a pleased look.  \"Brown allus liked my cookin,\" she said. \"He had a good appetite most generally, and it was a pleasure to see him eat. It's kinder lonesome cookin' for yourself. Then, too, it takes away my appetite sittin' down alone to eat.\"  \"You must be very lonely, Mrs. Brown.\"  \"Yes, its lonesome like bein' a widder. I'm kinder used to seein' a man about the house.\"  \"So I suppose.\"  \"Be you a married man?\" asked the lady, pointedly.  \"No, ma'am.\"  \"How old be you?\"  \"Twenty-eight,\" answered Miles, rather amused.  \"Then you're old enough to get married?\"  \"Oh yes, I am old enough.\"  \"Be you in love with any girl?\"  \"The old woman's getting curious,\" thought Miles. \"However, I don't mind gratifying her curiosity.\"  \"No, I'm not in love,\" he replied.  Mrs. Brown eyed him thoughtfully. She seemed to be revolving some plan in her mind.  \"Take a good look at me, stranger,\" she said, bracing herself up, as if on exhibition.  \"Certainly,\" said John Miles, considerably astonished.  \"I want to ask you a few questions.\"  \"Go ahead, Mrs. Brown.\"  \"Am I hump-backed?\"  \"Certainly not. Who said you were?\"  \"Just attend to my questions, if you please, stranger. Am I squint-eyed?\"  \"Mrs. Brown"]]]
