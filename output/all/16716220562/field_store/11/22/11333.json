It was perhaps as well that Edward took these to his room to open, considering the amount of varied ill news that he found in them.  The first was from his father, who had just been dismissed from his position as King's minister, owing (as he put it) to the ingratitude of the great--but really, as was proved afterwards, on account of some political plots which he had formed against his chief, the prime minister of the day.  Then his generous uncle, Sir Everard, wrote that all differences were over between his brother and himself. He had espoused his quarrel, and he directed Edward at once to send in the resignation of his commission to the War Office without any preliminaries, forbidding him longer to serve a government which had treated his father so badly.  But the letter which touched Edward most deeply was one from his commanding officer at Dundee, which declared curtly that if he did not report himself at the headquarters of the regiment within three days after the date of writing, he would be obliged to take steps in the matter which would be exceedingly disagreeable to Captain Waverley.  Edward at once sat down and wrote to Colonel Gardiner that, as he had thus chosen to efface the remembrance of past civilities, there was nothing left to him but to resign his commission, which he did formally, and ended his letter by requesting his commanding officer to forward this resignation to the proper quarter.  No little perplexed as to the meaning of all this, Edward was on his way to consult Fergus Mac-Ivor on the subject, when the latter advanced with an open newspaper in his hand.  \"Do your letters,\" he asked, \"confirm this unpleasant news?\"  And he held out the _Caledonian Mercury_, in which not only did he find his father's disgrace chronicled, but on turning to the _Gazette_ he found the words, \"Edward Waverley, Captain in the --th regiment of dragoons, superseded for absence without leave.\" The name of his successor, one Captain Butler, followed immediately.  On looking at the date of Colonel Gardiner's missive as compared with that of the _Gazette_, it was evident that his commanding officer had carried out his threat to the letter. Yet it was not at all like him to have done so. It was still more out of keeping with the constant kindness that he had shown to Edward. It was the young man's first idea, in accordance with the customs of the time, to send Colonel Gardiner a challenge. But, upon Fergus Mac-Ivor's advice, Edward ultimately contented himself with adding a postscript to his first letter, marking the time at which he had received the first summons, and regretting that the hastiness of his commander's action had prevented his anticipating it by sending in his resignation.  \"That, if anything,\" said Fergus, \"will make this Calvinistic colonel blush for his injustice.\"  But it was not long before some part at least of the mystery was made plain. Fergus took advantage of Edward's natural anger at his unworthy treatment, to reveal to him that a great rising was about to take place in the Highlands in favour of King James, and to urge him to cast in his lot with the clans. Flora, on the contrary, urged him to be careful and cautious, lest he should involve others to whom he owed everything, in a common danger with himself.  Edward, whose fancy (if not whose heart) had gradually been turning more and more toward the beautiful and patriotic Flora, appeared less interested in rebellion than in obtaining her brother's good-will and bespeaking his influence with his sister.  \"Out upon you,\" cried Fergus, with pretended ill-humour, \"can you think of nothing but ladies at such a time? Besides, why come to me in such a matter? Flora is up the glen. Go and ask herself. And Cupid go with you! But do not forget that my lovely sister, like her loving brother, is apt to have a pretty strong will of her own!\"  Edward's heart beat as he went up the rocky hillside to find Flora. She received and listened to him with kindness, but steadily refused to grant him the least encouragement. All her thoughts, her hopes, her life itself, were set on the success of this one bold stroke for a crown. Till the rightful King was on his throne, she could not think of anything else. Love and marriage were not for such as Flora Mac-Ivor. Edward, in spite of the manifest good-will of the chief, had to be content with such cold comfort as he could extract from Flora's promise that she would remember him in her prayers!  Next morning Edward was awakened to the familiar sound of Daft Davie Gellatley's voice singing below his window. For a moment he thought himself back at Tully-Veolan. Davie was declaring loudly that          \"_My heart's in the Highland, my heart is not here._\"  Then, immediately changing to a less sentimental strain, he added with a contemptuous accent:          \"_There's nocht in the Highlands but syboes and leeks,_          _And lang-leggit callants gaun wanting the breeks;_          _Wanting the breeks, and without hose or shoon,_          _But we'll a' win the breeks when King Jamie comes hame._\"  Edward, eager to know what had brought the Bradwardine \"innocent\" so far from home, dressed hastily and went down. Davie, without stopping his dancing for a moment, came whirling past, and, as he went, thrust a letter into Waverley's hand. It proved to be from Rose Bradwardine, and among other things it contained the news that the Baron had gone away to the north with a body of horsemen, while the red soldiers had been at Tully-Veolan searching for her father and also asking after Edward himself. Indeed they had carried off his servant prisoner, together with everything he had left at Tully-Veolan. Rose also warned him against the danger of returning thither, and at the same time sent her compliments to Fergus and Flora. The last words in the letter were, \"_Is she not as handsome and accomplished as I described her to be?_\"  Edward was exceedingly perplexed. Knowing his innocence of all treason, he could not imagine why he should be accused of it. He consulted Fergus, who told him he would to a certainty be hanged or imprisoned if he went south. Nevertheless, Edward persisted in \"running his hazard.\" The Chief, though wishful to keep him, did not absolutely say him nay. Flora, instead of coming down to bid him good-bye, sent only excuses. So altogether it was in no happy frame of mind that Edward rode away to the south upon the Chief's horse, Brown Dermid, and with Callum Beg for an attendant in the guise of a Lowland groom.  Callum warned his master against saying anything when they got to the first little Lowland town, either on the subject of the Highlands, or about his master, Vich Ian Vohr.  \"The people there are bitter Whigs, teil burst them!\" he said fiercely. As they rode on they saw many people about the street, chiefly old women in tartan hoods and red cloaks, who seemed to cast up their hands in horror at the sight of Waverley's horse. Edward asked the reason.  \"Oh,\" said Callum Beg, \"it's either the muckle Sunday hersel', or the little government Sunday that they caa the Fast!\"  It proved to be the latter, and the innkeeper, a severe sly-looking man, received them with scanty welcome. Indeed, he only admitted them because he remembered that it was in his power to fine them for the crime of travelling on a Fast Day by an addition to the length of his reckoning next morning.  But as soon as Edward announced his wish for a horse and guide to Perth, the hypocritical landlord made ready to go with him in person. Callum Beg, excited by the golden guinea which Waverley gave him, offered to show his gratitude by waiting a little distance along the road, and \"kittlin' the landlord's quarters wi' her skene-occle\"--or, in other words, setting a dagger in his back. Apparently Vich Ian Vohr's page thought no more of such a deed than an ordinary English boy would have thought of stealing an apple out of an orchard.   THE THIRD INTERLUDE--BEING MAINLY A FEW WORDS UPON HEROES      Among the listeners there was somewhat less     inclination than before to act this part of the     story. For one thing, the boys were righteously     indignant at the idea of any true hero being in     love--unless, indeed, he could carry off his bride     from the deck of a pirate vessel, cutlass in hand,     and noble words of daring on his lips.      As for the girls, well--they knew that the bushes     were dripping wet, and that if they set their feet     upon their native heath, they would certainly be     made to change their stockings as soon as they went     home. This was a severe discourager of romance.     There was nothing to prevent any one of them from     asking questions, however. _That_ was a business in     which they excelled.      \"But why did the Highland people want to rebel,     anyway?\" demanded Hugh John. \"If I could have     hunted like that, and raided, and carried off     cattle, and had a castle with pipes playing and     hundreds of clansmen to drill, I shouldn't have     been such a soft as to rebel and get them all taken     away from me!\"      \"It was because they were loyal to their rightful     King,\" said Sweetheart, who is a Cavalier and a     Jacobite--in the intervals of admiring Cromwell,     and crying because they shot down the poor     Covenanters.      \"_I_ think,\" said Sir Toady, who had been sitting     very thoughtful, \"that they just liked to fight,     and King George would not let them. So they wanted     a king who would not mind. Same as us, you know. If     we are caught fighting in school, we get whipped,     but father lets us fight outside as much as we want     to. Besides, what did old Vich Ian Vohr want with     all these silly Highlanders, eating up everything     in his castle, if there were never any battles that     they could fight for him?\"      This was certainly a very strong and practical     view, and so much"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22656"],["title","Red Cap Tales, Stolen from the Treasure Chest of the Wizard of the North (#8)"],["body","the others that they     sat a long while quiet, turning it over in their     minds.      \"Well, at any rate,\" said Sweetheart, dropping her     head with a sigh to go on with her seam, \"I know     that Flora Mac-Ivor was truly patriotic. See how     she refused to listen to Waverley, all because she     wanted to give her life for the cause.\"      \"Humph,\" said Hugh John, disrespectfully turning up     his nose, \"that's all girls think about--loving,     an' marrying, an' playing on harps--\"      \"I don't play on harps,\" sighed Sweetheart, \"but I     do wish I had a banjo!\"      \"I wish I had a targe and a broadsword, and the     Chief's horse, Brown Dermid, to ride on,\" said Hugh     John, putting on his \"biggety\" look.      \"And a nice figure you would cut,\" sneered Sir     Toady Lion, provokingly; \"Highlanders don't fight     on horseback! You ought to know that!\"      Whereupon the first engagement of the campaign was     immediately fought out on the carpet. And it was     not till after the intervention of the Superior     Power had restored quiet that the next tale from     _Waverley_ could be proceeded with.    THE FOURTH TALE FROM \"WAVERLEY\"   HERE AND THERE AMONG THE HEATHER  NOT long after Callum Beg had been left behind, and indeed almost as soon as the innkeeper and Edward were fairly on their way, the former suddenly announced that his horse had fallen lame and that they must turn aside to a neighbouring smithy to have the matter attended to.  \"And as it is the Fast Day, and the smith a religious man, it may cost your Honour as muckle as sixpence a shoe!\" suggested the wily innkeeper, watching Edward's face as he spoke.  For this announcement Edward cared nothing. He would gladly have paid a shilling a nail to be allowed to push forward on his journey with all speed. Accordingly to the smithy of Cairnvreckan they went. The village was in an uproar. The smith, a fierce-looking man, was busy hammering \"dogs' heads\" for musket-locks, while among the surrounding crowd the names of great Highland chiefs--Clanronald, Glengarry, Lochiel, and that of Vich Ian Vohr himself, were being bandied from mouth to mouth.  Edward soon found himself surrounded by an excited mob, in the midst of which the smith's wife, a wild witchlike woman, was dancing, every now and then casting her child up in the air as high as her arms would reach, singing all the while, and trying to anger the crowd, and especially to infuriate her husband, by the Jacobite songs which she chanted.  At last the smith could stand this provocation no longer. He snatched a red-hot bar of iron from the forge, and rushed at his wife, crying out that he would \"thrust it down her throat.\" Then, finding himself held back by the crowd from executing vengeance on the woman, all his anger turned upon Edward, whom he took to be a Jacobite emissary. For the news which had caused all this stir was that Prince Charles had landed and that the whole Highlands was rallying to his banner.  So fierce and determined was the attack which the angry smith of Cairnvreckan made on Edward that the young man was compelled to draw his pistol in self-defence. And as the crowd threatened him and the smith continued furiously to attack with the red-hot iron, almost unconsciously his finger pressed the trigger. The shot went off, and immediately the smith fell to the ground. Then Edward, borne down by the mob, was for some time in great danger of his life. He was saved at last by the interference of the minister of the parish, a kind and gentle old man, who caused Edward's captors to treat him more tenderly. So that instead of executing vengeance upon the spot as they had proposed, they brought him before the nearest magistrate, who was, indeed, an old military officer, and, in addition, the Laird of the village of Cairnvreckan, one Major Melville by name.  [Illustration: \"SO fierce and determined was the attack which the angry smith of Cairnvreckan made on Edward that the young man was compelled to draw his pistol in self-defence.\"]  The latter proved to be a stern soldier, so severe in manner that he often became unintentionally unjust. Major Melville found that though the blacksmith's wound proved to be a mere scratch, and though he had to own that the provocation given was a sufficient excuse for Edward's hasty action, yet he must detain the young man prisoner upon the warrant issued against Edward Waverley, which had been sent out by the Supreme Court of Scotland.  Edward, who at once owned to his name, was astonished beyond words to find that not only was he charged with being in the company of actual rebels, such as the Baron of Bradwardine and Vich Ian Vohr, but also with trying to induce his troop of horse to revolt by means of private letters addressed to one of them, Sergeant Houghton, in their barracks at Dundee. Captain Waverley was asserted to have effected this through the medium of a pedlar named Will Ruthven, or Wily Will--whose very name Edward had never heard up to that moment.  As the magistrate's examination proceeded, Waverley was astonished to find that, instead of clearing himself, everything he said, every article he carried about his person, was set down by Major Melville as an additional proof of his complicity with treason. Among these figured Flora's verses, his own presence at the great hunting match among the mountains, his father's and Sir Everard's letters, even the huge manuscripts written by his tutor (of which he had never read six pages)--all were brought forward as so many evidences of his guilt.  Finally, the magistrate informed Edward that he would be compelled to detain him a prisoner in his house of Cairnvreckan. But that if he would furnish such information as it was doubtless in his power to give concerning the forces and plans of Vich Ian Vohr and the other Highland chiefs, he might, after a brief detention, be allowed to go free. Edward fiercely exclaimed that he would die rather than turn informer against those who had been his friends and hosts. Whereupon, having refused all hospitality, he was conducted to a small room, there to be guarded till there was a chance of sending him under escort to the Castle of Stirling.  Here he was visited by Mr. Morton, the minister who had saved him from the clutches of the mob, and so sympathetically and kindly did he speak, that Edward told him his whole story from the moment when he had first left Waverley-Honour. And though the minister's favourable report did not alter the opinion Major Melville had formed of Edward's treason, it softened his feelings toward the young man so much that he invited him to dinner, and afterwards did his best to procure him favourable treatment from the Westland Whig captain, Mr. Gifted Gilfillan, who commanded the party which was to convoy him to Stirling Castle.  The escort which was to take Edward southward was not so strong as it might have been. Part of Captain Gifted Gilfillan's command had stayed behind to hear a favourite preacher upon the occasion of the afternoon Fast Day service at Cairnvreckan. Others straggled for purposes of their own, while as they went along, their leader lectured Edward upon the fewness of those that should be saved. Heaven, he informed Edward, would be peopled exclusively by the members of his own denomination. Captain Gifted was still engaged in condemning all and sundry belonging to the Churches of England and Scotland, when a stray pedlar joined his party and asked of \"his Honour\" the favour of his protection as far as Stirling, urging as a reason the uncertainty of the times and the value of the property he carried in his pack.  The pedlar, by agreeing with all that was said, and desiring further information upon spiritual matters, soon took the attention of Captain Gifted Gilfillan from his prisoner. He declared that he had even visited, near Mauchline, the very farm of the Whig leader. He congratulated him upon the fine breed of cattle he possessed. Then he went on to speak of the many evil, popish, and unchristian things he had seen in his travels as a pedlar over the benighted countries of Europe. Whereupon Gifted Gilfillan became so pleased with his companion and so enraptured with his subject, that he allowed his party to string itself out along the route without an attempt at discipline, or even the power of supporting each other in case of attack.  The leaders were ascending a little hill covered with whin bushes and crowned with low brushwood, when, after looking about him quickly to note some landmarks, the pedlar put his fingers to his mouth and whistled. He explained that he was whistling on a favourite dog, named Bawty, which he had lost. The Covenanter reproved him severely for thinking of a useless dog in the midst of such precious and improving conversation as they were holding together.  But in spite of his protests the pedlar persisted in his whistling, and presently, out of a copse close to the path, six or eight stout Highlanders sprang upon them brandishing their claymores.  \"The Sword of the Lord and of Gideon!\" shouted Gifted Gilfillan, nothing daunted. And he was proceeding to lay about him stoutly, when the pedlar, snatching a musket, felled him to the ground with the butt. The scattered Whig party hurried up to support their leader. In the scuffle, Edward's horse was shot, and he himself somewhat bruised in falling. Whereupon some of the Highlanders took him by the arms, and half-supported, half-carried him away from the highroad, leaving the unconscious Gifted still stretched on the ground. The Westlanders, thus deprived of a leader, did not even attempt a pursuit, but contented themselves with sending a few dropping shots after the Highlanders, which, of course, did nobody any harm.  They carried Edward fully two miles, and it was not till they reached the deep covert of a distant glen that they stopped with their burden. Edward spoke to them repeatedly, but the only answer he got"]]]
