More judiciously Professor Bain alters, \"He that tells a lie is not sensible how great a task he undertakes; for he must be forced to invent twenty more to maintain one,\" into \"for, to maintain one, he must invent twenty more,\" putting the emphatic words in their emphatic place, at the end.   *18. Where several words are emphatic, make it clear which is the most emphatic.* Thus, in \"The state was made, under the pretence of serving it, in reality the prize of their contention to each of these opposite parties,\" it is unpleasantly doubtful whether the writer means (1) _state_ or (2) _parties_ to be emphatic.  If (1), \"As for the _state_, these two parties, under the pretence of serving it, converted it into a prize for their contention.\" If (2), write, \"Though served in profession, the state was in reality converted into a prize for their contention by these two _parties_.\" In (1) _parties_ is subordinated, in (2) _state_.  Sometimes the addition of some intensifying word serves to emphasize. Thus, instead of \"To effect this they used all devices,\" we can write \"To effect this they used _every conceivable device_.\" So, if we want to emphasize fidelity in \"The business will task your skill and fidelity,\" we can write \"Not only your skill _but also_ your fidelity.\" This, however, sometimes leads to exaggerations. See (2).  Sometimes antithesis gives emphasis, as in \"You _do_ not know this, but you _shall_ know it.\" Where antithesis cannot be used, the emphasis must be expressed by turning the sentence, as \"I _will make you_ know it,\" or by some addition, as \"You shall _hereafter_ know it.\"   *19. Words should be as near as possible to the words with which they are grammatically connected.* See Paragraphs 20 to 29. For exceptions see 30.   *20. Adverbs should be placed next to the words they are intended to affect.* When unemphatic, adverbs come between the subject and the verb, or, if the tense is compound, between the parts of the compound tense: \"He _quickly_ left the room;\" \"He has _quickly_ left the room;\" but, when emphatic, after the verb: \"He left, or has left, the room _quickly_.\"[10] When such a sentence as the latter is followed by a present participle, there arises ambiguity. \"I told him to go slowly, but he left the room _quickly_, dropping the purse on the floor.\" Does _quickly_ here modify _left_ or _dropping_? The remedy[11] is, to give the adverb its unemphatic place, \"He _quickly_ left the room, dropping &c.,\" or else to avoid the participle, thus: \"He _quickly_ dropped the purse and left the room,\" or \"He dropped the purse and _quickly_ left the room.\"   *21. \"Only\" requires careful use. The strict[12] rule is, that \"only\" should be placed before the word affected by it.*  The following is ambiguous:  \"The heavens are not open to the faithful _only_ at intervals.\"  The best rule is to avoid placing \"only\" between two emphatic words, and to avoid using \"only\" where \"alone\" can be used instead.  In strictness perhaps the three following sentences:  (1) He _only_ beat three,  (2) He beat _only_ three,  (3) He beat three _only_, ought to be explained, severally, thus:  (1) He did no more than beat, did not kill, three.  (2) He beat no more than three.  (3) He beat three, and that was all he did. (Here _only_ modifies the whole of the sentence and depreciates the action.)  But the best authors sometimes transpose the word. \"He _only_ lived\" ought to mean \"he did not die or make any great sacrifice;\" but \"He _only_ lived but till he was a man\" (_Macbeth_, v. 8. 40) means \"He lived _only_ till he was a man.\" Compare also, \"Who _only_ hath immortality.\"  _Only_ at the beginning of a statement = _but_. \"I don't like to importune you, _only_ I know you'll forgive me.\" Before an imperative it diminishes the favour asked: \"_Only_ listen to me.\" This use of _only_ is mostly confined to letters.  Very often, _only_ at the beginning of a sentence is used for _alone_: \"_Only_ ten came,\" \"_Only_ CÃ¦sar approved.\" _Alone_ is less ambiguous. The ambiguity of _only_ is illustrated by such a sentence as, \"Don't hesitate to bring a few friends of yours to shoot on my estate at any time. _Only_ five (fifteen) came yesterday,\" which might mean, \"I don't mind a _few_; _only_ don't bring so many as _fifteen_;\" or else \"Don't hesitate to bring a few _more_; no more than _five_ came yesterday.\" In conversation, ambiguity is prevented by emphasis; but in a letter, _only_ thus used might cause unfortunate mistakes. Write \"Yesterday _only_ five came,\" if you mean \"no more than five.\"   *22. When \"not only\" precedes \"but also,\" see that each is followed by the same part of speech.*  \"He _not only_ gave me advice _but also_ help\" is wrong. Write \"He gave me, _not only_ advice, _but also_ help.\" On the other hand, \"He _not only_ gave me a grammar, _but also_ lent me a dictionary,\" is right. Take an instance. \"He spoke _not only_ forcibly _but also_ tastefully (adverbs), and this too, _not only_ before a small audience, _but also_ in (prepositions) a large public meeting, and his speeches were _not only_ successful, _but also_ (adjective) worthy of success.\"   *23. \"At least,\" \"always,\" and other adverbial adjuncts, sometimes produce ambiguity.*  \"I think you will find my Latin exercise, _at all events_, as good as my cousin's.\" Does this mean (1) \"my Latin exercise, though not perhaps my other exercises;\" or (2), \"Though not very good, yet, at all events, as good as my cousin's\"? Write for (1), \"My Latin exercise, at all events, you will find &c.\" and for (2), \"I think you will find my Latin exercise as good as my cousin's, at all events.\"  The remedy is to avoid placing \"at all events\" between two emphatic words.  As an example of the misplacing of an adverbial adjunct, take \"From abroad he received most favourable reports, but in the City he heard that a panic had broken out on the Exchange, and that the funds were fast falling.\" This ought to mean that the \"hearing,\" and not (as is intended) that the \"breaking out of the panic,\" took place in the City.  In practice, an adverb is often used to qualify a remote word, where the latter is _more emphatic than any nearer word_. This is very common when the Adverbial Adjunct is placed in an emphatic position at the beginning of the sentence: \"_On this very spot_ our guide declared that Claverhouse had fallen.\"   *24. Nouns should be placed near the nouns that they define.* In the very common sentence \"The death is announced of Mr. John Smith, an author whose works &c.,\" the transposition is probably made from a feeling that, if we write \"The death of Mr. John Smith is announced,\" we shall be obliged to begin a new sentence, \"He was an author whose works &c.\" But the difficulty can be removed by writing \"We regret to announce, or, we are informed of, the death of Mr. John Smith, an author, &c.\"   *25. Pronouns should follow the nouns to which they refer without the intervention of another noun.* Avoid, \"John Smith, the son of Thomas Smith, _who_ gave me this book,\" unless _Thomas Smith_ is the antecedent of _who_. Avoid also \"John supplied Thomas with money: _he_ (John) was very well off.\"  When, however, one of two preceding nouns is decidedly superior to the other in emphasis, the more emphatic may be presumed to be the noun referred to by the pronoun, even though the noun of inferior emphasis intervenes. Thus: \"At this moment the colonel came up, and took the place of the wounded general. _He_ gave orders to halt.\" Here _he_ would naturally refer to _colonel_, though _general_ intervenes. A _conjunction_ will often show that a pronoun refers to the subject of the preceding sentence, and not to another intervening noun. \"The sentinel at once took aim at the approaching soldier, and fired. He _then_ retreated to give the alarm.\"  It is better to adhere, in most cases, to Rule 25, which may be called (Bain) the Rule of Proximity. The Rule of Emphasis, of which an instance was given in the last paragraph, is sometimes misleading. A distinction might be drawn by punctuating thus:  \"David the father of Solomon, who slew Goliath.\" \"David, the father of Solomon who built the Temple.\" But the propriety of omitting a comma in each case is questionable, and it is better to write so as not to be at the mercy of commas.   *26. Clauses that are grammatically connected should be kept as close together as possible.* (But see 55.) The introduction of parentheses violating this rule often produced serious ambiguity. Thus, in the following: \"The result of these observations appears to be in opposition to the view now generally received in this country, that in muscular effort the substance of the muscle itself undergoes disintegration.\" Here it is difficult to tell whether the theory of \"disintegration\" is (1) \"the result,\" or, as the absence of a comma after \"be\" would indicate, (2) \"in opposition to the result of these observations.\" If (1) is intended, add \"and to prove\" after \"country;\" if (2), insert \"which is\" after \"country.\"  There is an excessive complication in the following:--\"It cannot, at all events, if the consideration demanded by a subject of such importance from any one professing to be a philosopher, be given, be denied that &c.\"  Where a speaker feels that his hearers have forgotten the connection of the beginning of the sentence, he should repeat what he has said; _e.g._ after the long parenthesis in the last sentence he should recommence, \"it cannot, I say, be denied.\" In writing, however, this licence must be sparingly used.  A short parenthesis, or modifying clause, will not interfere with clearness, especially if antithesis he used, so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22600"],["title","How to Write Clearly: Rules and Exercises on English Composition (#5)"],["body","to show the connection between the different parts of the sentence, _e.g._ \"A modern newspaper statement, _though probably true_, would be laughed at if quoted in a book as testimony; but the letter of a court gossip is thought good historical evidence if written some centuries ago.\" Here, to place \"though probably true\" at the beginning of the sentence would not add clearness, and would impair the emphasis of the contrast between \"a modern newspaper statement\" and \"the letter of a court gossip.\"   *27. In conditional sentences, the antecedent clauses must be kept distinct from the consequent clauses.*--There is ambiguity in \"The lesson intended to be taught by these manoeuvres will be lost, if the plan of operations is laid down too definitely beforehand, and the affair degenerates into a mere review.\" Begin, in any case, with the antecedent, \"If the plan,\" &c. Next write, according to the meaning: (1) \"If the plan is laid down, and the affair degenerates &c., then the lesson will be lost;\" or (2) \" ... then the lesson ... will be lost, and the affair degenerates into a mere review.\"   *28. Dependent clauses preceded by \"that\" should be kept distinct from those that are independent.*  Take as an example:  (1) \"He replied that he wished to help them, and intended to make preparations accordingly.\"  This ought not to be used (though it sometimes is, for shortness) to mean:  (2) \"He replied ..., and he intended.\"  In (1), \"intended,\" having no subject, must be supposed to be connected with the nearest preceding verb, in the same mood and tense, that has a subject, _i.e._ \"wished.\" It follows that (1) is a condensation of:  (3) \"He replied that he wished ..., and that he intended.\"  (2), though theoretically free from ambiguity, is practically ambiguous, owing to a loose habit of repeating the subject unnecessarily. It would be better to insert a conjunctional word or a full stop between the two statements. Thus:  (4) \"He replied that he wished to help them, and _indeed_ he intended,\" &c., or \"He replied, &c. He intended, &c.\"  Where there is any danger of ambiguity, use (3) or (4) in preference to (1) or (2).   *29. When there are several infinitives, those that are dependent on the same word must be kept distinct from those that are not.*  \"He said that he wished _to_ take his friend with him _to_ visit the capital and _to_ study medicine.\" Here it is doubtful whether the meaning is--  \"He said that he wished to take his friend with him,  (1) _and also_ to visit the capital and study medicine,\" or  (2) \"that his friend might visit the capital _and might also_ study medicine,\" or  (3) \"on a visit to the capital, _and that he also_ wished to study medicine.\"  From the three different versions it will be perceived that this ambiguity must be met (_a_) by using \"that\" for \"to,\" which allows us to repeat an auxiliary verb [_e.g._ \"might\" in (2)], and (_b_) by inserting conjunctions. As to insertions of conjunctions, see (37).  \"In order to,\" and \"for the purpose of,\" can be used to distinguish (wherever there is any ambiguity) between an infinitive that _expresses a purpose_, and an infinitive that does not, _e.g._ \"He told his servant to call upon his friend, _to_ (in order to) give him information about the trains, and not to leave him till he started.\"   *30. The principle of suspense.* Write your sentence in such a way that, until he has come to the full stop, the reader may feel the sentence to be incomplete. In other words, keep your reader in _suspense_. _Suspense_ is caused (1) by placing the \"if-clause\" first, and not last, in a conditional sentence; (2) by placing participles before the words they qualify; (3) by using suspensive conjunctions, _e.g._ _not only_, _either_, _partly_, _on the one hand_, _in the first place_, &c.  The following is an example of an _unsuspended_ sentence. The sense _draggles_, and it is difficult to keep up one's attention.  \"Mr. Pym was looked upon as the man of greatest experience in parliaments, | where he had served very long, | and was always a man of business, | being an officer in the Exchequer, | and of a good reputation generally, | though known to be inclined to the Puritan party; yet not of those furious resolutions (_Mod. Eng._ so furiously resolved) against the Church as the other leading men were, | and wholly devoted to the Earl of Bedford,--who had nothing of that spirit.\"  The foregoing sentence might have ended at any one of the eight points marked above. When suspended it becomes:--  \"Mr. Pym, owing to his long service in Parliament in the Exchequer, was esteemed above all others for his Parliamentary experience and for his knowledge of business. He had also a good reputation generally; for, though openly favouring the Puritan party, he was closely devoted to the Earl of Bedford, and, like the Earl, had none of the fanatical spirit manifested against the Church by the other leading men.\"  *30 a. It is a violation of the principle of Suspense to introduce unexpectedly, at the end of a long sentence, some short and unemphatic clause beginning with (a) \" ... not\" or (b) \" ... which.\"*  (_a_) \"This reform has already been highly beneficial to all classes of our countrymen, and will, I am persuaded, encourage among us industry, self-dependence, and frugality, _and not, as some say, wastefulness_.\"  Write \"not, as some say, wastefulness, but industry, self-dependence, and frugality.\"  (_b_) \"After a long and tedious journey, the last part of which was a little dangerous owing to the state of the roads, we arrived safely at York, _which is a fine old town_.\"  *Exception.*--When the short final clause is intended to be unexpectedly unemphatic, it comes in appropriately, with something of the sting of an epigram. See (42). Thus:  \"The old miser said that he should have been delighted to give the poor fellow a shilling, but most unfortunately he had left his purse at home--_a habit of his_.\"  Suspense naturally throws increased emphasis on the words for which we are waiting, _i.e._ on the end of the sentence. It has been pointed out above that *a monotony of final emphasis is objectionable, especially in letter writing and conversation*.   *31. Suspense must not be excessive.* _Excess of suspense_ is a common fault in boys translating from Latin. \"Themistocles, having secured the safety of Greece, the Persian fleet being now destroyed, when he had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Greeks to break down the bridge across the Hellespont, hearing that Xerxes was in full flight, and thinking that it might be profitable to secure the friendship of the king, wrote as follows to him.\" The more English idiom is: \"When Themistocles had secured the safety of Greece by the destruction of the Persian fleet, he made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the Greeks to break down the bridge across the Hellespont. Soon afterwards, hearing &c.\"  A long suspense that would be intolerable in prose is tolerable in the introduction to a poem. See the long interval at the beginning of _Paradise Lost_ between \"Of man's first disobedience\" and \"Sing, heavenly Muse.\" Compare also the beginning of _Paradise Lost_, Book II.:      \"_High on a throne of royal state, which far     Outshone the wealth of Ormuz and of Ind,     Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand     Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold--     Satan exalted sat._\"  with the opening of Keats' _Hyperion_:      \"_Deep in the shady sadness of a vale,     Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,     Far from the fiery noon and eve's one star--     Sat grey-haired Saturn, quiet as a stone._\"   *32. In a long conditional sentence put the \"if-clause,\" antecedent, or protasis, first.*  Everyone will see the flatness of \"Revenge thy father's most unnatural murder, if thou didst ever love him,\" as compared with the suspense that forces an expression of agony from Hamlet in--    \"_Ghost._ If thou didst ever thy dear father love--   _Hamlet._ O, God!   _Ghost._ Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\"  The effect is sometimes almost ludicrous when the consequent is long and complicated, and when it precedes the antecedent or \"if-clause.\" \"I should be delighted to introduce you to my friends, and to show you the objects of interest in our city, and the beautiful scenery in the neighbourhood, if you were here.\" Where the \"if-clause\" comes last, it ought to be very emphatic: \"if you were _only_ here.\"  The introduction of a clause with \"if\" or \"though\" in the middle of a sentence may often cause ambiguity, especially when a great part of the sentence depends on \"that:\" \"His enemies answered that, for the sake of preserving the public peace, they would keep quiet for the present, though he declared that cowardice was the motive of the delay, and that for this reason they would put off the trial to a more convenient season.\" See (27).   *33. Suspense[13] is gained by placing a Participle or Adjective that qualifies the Subject, before the Subject.*  \"_Deserted_ by his friends, he was forced to have recourse to those that had been his enemies.\" Here, if we write, \"He, deserted by his friends, was forced &c.,\" _he_ is unduly emphasized; and if we write, \"He was forced to have recourse to his enemies, having been deserted by his friends,\" the effect is very flat.  Of course we might sometimes write \"He was deserted and forced &c.\" But this cannot be done where the \"desertion\" is to be not stated but implied.  Often, when a participle qualifying the subject is introduced late in the sentence, it causes positive ambiguity: \"With this small force the general determined to attack the foe, _flushed_ with recent victory and _rendered_ negligent by success.\"  An excessive use of the _suspensive participle_ is French and objectionable: _e.g._ \"_Careless_ by nature, and too much _engaged_ with business to think of the morrow, _spoiled_ by a long-established liberty and a fabulous prosperity, _having_ for many generations forgotten"]]]
