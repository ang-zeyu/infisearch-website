They hit your face when you stand, and sitting, their lowest edge stirs up your hair. These velvet rugs have white cotton covers on them now that they are being used, so the general effect at dinner-time is of a huge laundry in a gale, with beautiful laundresses in low dresses sitting at table under a world of wildly flapping linen; with the lamps lit, and our black coats for a foil, the colours are really extremely pretty, though the discomfort is great. Men and women are all getting a little brown with the sea air, and the ladies have a little of the blush of spring now, instead of the pallor of winter with which they came on board.  [Illustration]  Egypt in sight, and this morning we tubbed in the water of the river that floated Moses, and that has been bathed in and drunk since by such a number of people we know, or have read about. Sea and Nile are meeting in blue, and green, and brownish stripes, blending to a general absinthe colour as we get closer to the flat delta; little level rows of cloud throw purple shadows across the crisp small waves, and over the horizon there's a flight of white lateen sails.  What a bustle there is on board to-day; people running up and down stairs with letters hurriedly finished, addressed and stamped to the children at home. No use writing to the man who waits out there, for we carry the mail. It is touching, the wife looking forward and back at the same time--the bull must pass--and the young girl too, leaving the old life for the new married life in a new country; it must take courage.  My notes at Port Said seem to have disappeared, possibly I did not write any. I remember that there was so much to see in the morning; and the change of colour in the water, the absinthe colour of the Nile with pale blue reflections winding in currents in distinct streams into the sea, would, with the blue ocean, need very subtile painting. I remember the fearful jabber, which I suppose has gone on and always will, since Port Said was invented. I got a glimpse of Lesseps's statue at lunch through the port-hole; he points with right hand twice life size up the harbour with a heroic expression, and seems to say to the steamers that come in from the sea, \"Higher up there S.V.P.--try a little higher up.\" We watched the often described black men coaling in black dust, singing and working, the sun's rays making shafts of light stream through the clouds of black coal dust; and the same pandemonium at night in the flare of lights, when the scene is generally admitted to be like the nether regions.  I know we went ashore somehow or other, and that we could hardly see for the shouting and yelling! We felt fortunate in having a Mrs Deputy-Commissioner for a companion, for she was bubbling over with humour and anecdote. She and G. promptly began shopping, and certainly succeeded in getting two rather becoming topees, flatter and prettier than any I have yet seen--you might call them Romney topees; one may appear in sketches further on. I sketched of course--always keep \"screeb, screeb, screebling all day long,\" as an irate German lady once put it to me, \"screebled\" a café scene; on the left you see a native, who calls himself Jock Furgusson, trying to pass off a \"Genuine Egyptian Scarab\" to a tourist. Jock Furgusson is infinitely more wonderful and artistic to me than the pyramids, for he can imitate accents so as to make you gasp; he spots anyone's nationality instantaneously--before you have opened your lips he knows your county! I believe he can distinguish between the English of a Lowland Scot and a Highlander, which is more than '_Punch_' does after all these years of practice. \"Ah'm, Jock Furgusson frae Auchtermurrchty and Achterlony, longest maun in the forty twa,\" he begins--but somebody help me--I've forgotten how he goes on, a long rigmarole in broadest Doric; the words and intonation so perfect, you can so little believe your eyes that you are landed with a scarab or a string of beads before you have recovered, and he is off to another passenger, clippin' 'is g's and r's and puttin' in h's to some Englishmen.  The inhabitants of Port Said, we are told, represent the scourings of the Levant; too bad for Cairo, and black-balled for Hell. All the same G. and I went ashore by ourselves after dinner, rather proud of our courage, for several passengers said it wasn't safe. It used not to be safe, I know, but I asked the Chief-Engineer what he thought, and he took his right hand in his left, all but the very tip of the little finger which he measured off with his left thumb nail, and said, \"a black maun's heart's no as big as that.\" So we went ashore and had no adventures at all, but sat in a balcony and listened to pretty good music, and noted the few drowsy figures in the side streets, the glow of lamp or brazier on their heavy draperies, contrasting with the starlight and the deep velvety shadows--moth-like colouring, and intense repose, after the glittering, howling day.  [Illustration: A Café, Port Said]  Looking back over these notes, and the Orient and Pacific Guide Book, and the Acts of the Apostles, I observe that I have made no note about Corsica and Sardinia, Lipari Islands, and Stromboli, or of the Straits of Messina and Etna--have barely mentioned Crete! In the Lipari Islands we saw lights ashore, and down the Straits of Messina; and Stromboli we discovered easily enough by the glow of hot red up in the sky, and a sloping line of red that went glittering downwards. It was too dark to distinguish anything more.  We saw Crete, enough to swear by, the white top of Mount Ida, and realized where Fair Haven and Phenice and Clauda must lie, and that we were actually in the seas where the Apostle Paul was caught in the Euroclydon. By the way what is a Euroclydon; is it a Levanter?  Was there ever a voyage so vividly described, in more concentrated and pithy words? In eight verses you have a complete dramatic account of a tragedy at sea, from a passenger's point of view. It would be curious and interesting to learn what the owner thought, and said, when the prisoner suggested that he, and his sailing master, and the Centurion, were all wrong in a question of navigation; and how it came about that shortly after this difference of opinion the prisoner was master of the commissariat, and how, after heavy weather and fasting fourteen days on a rocky coast, 276 souls were saved on bits of wreckage without the loss of one life! The Board of Trade and Life Saving Societies might enquire into this, and report.     CHAPTER VI   [Illustration]  The Canal.--If I had not seen Mr Talbot Kelly's book on Egypt I could hardly have believed it possible that the delicate schemes of colour we see in the desert as we pass through the canal could be painted and reproduced in colour in a book. He has got the very bloom of the desert, and the beauty of Egypt without its ugliness; the heat and sparkle and brightness in his pictures are so vivid one can almost breathe the exhilarating desert air--and smell the Bazaars! But Egypt is ugly a pin's prick beneath its beauty. It is so old and covered with bones and decayed ideas. The Nile is associated with Moses, and it is long it is true, but it is also very narrow and shallow, and its banks are monotonous to a degree; a mile or so of green crop on either side, then stones, sand, bits of crockery, human bones and rags, then desert sand--a cross between a cemetery and a kitchen garden. The ruins are _awfully_ ugly! \"Think of their age!\" people say, and you look at the exquisite spirals of shells in the lime stones with which these heaps are made! But the saddest thing in Egypt is the fine art debased in the temples, in these ponderous monuments of their officialism; for here and there in them you see exquisite bits of low relief carving, that a Greek would have been proud of, hidden away in interminable hieroglyphic histories spread indiscriminately over grotesque pillars and vast walls, as regardlessly of decorative effect as advertisements in a newspaper's columns. The open desert is the best of Egypt, and this thread of blue canal strung with lakes through its sand is very pretty and interesting all the way. We come to a swing bridge. It is open and our modern hotel and modern people slowly steam right through the middle of a Biblical caravan of Arabs on camels; some have crossed into the Egyptian side, the remainder are waiting on the Arabian side, their camels are feeding on the grey-green bushes. The passengers just give them a glance and go on with their books. Have we not seen it all long ago in nursery books on Sundays. But, in the nursery in our Sunday books we did not see or feel the glitter and heat of the day, some of which, children to-day can get in Mr Kelly's book.  I dared not sketch the desert scenes; it was in too high a key for me, but I made so bold as to do this sketch of a scene on deck at night: an effect I have not heard described, though it must be familiar to those who go this road. I am sorry it is not reproduced here in colour.  [Illustration]  The searchlight on the bow plays on the sandbanks and desert beyond, and makes the land like a snow-field, and the slow movement of the white light intensifies the darkness and silence of the desert. In contrast to the cold blue light and snow-white sand, is the group of figures on deck in bright dresses, dancing. It made quite an _evident_ subject. The figure leaning on the rail is not ill. It is only a little Japanese maid thinking of home perhaps.  Suez was a few lights in the darkness over the glow of our pipes, then bed, and in the morning we were sailing down the top, west branch, of the Red Sea, otherwise the Gulf of Suez, with a fresh north wind behind us.

SMITH &  E. EVERETT EVANS    Illustrated by BERRY      The Masters had ruled all space  with an unconquerable iron fist. But  the Masters were gone. And this new,  young race who came now to take their  place--could they hope to defeat the  ancient Enemy of All?     I   \"But didn't you feel _anything_, Javo?\" Strain was apparent in every line of Tula's taut, bare body. \"Nothing at all?\"  \"Nothing whatever.\" The one called Javo relaxed from his rigid concentration. \"Nothing has changed. Nor will it.\"  \"That conclusion is indefensible!\" Tula snapped. \"With the promised return of the Masters there must and will be changes. Didn't _any_ of you feel anything?\"  Her hot, demanding eyes swept the group; a group whose like, except for physical perfection, could be found in any nudist colony.  No one except Tula had felt a thing.  \"That fact is not too surprising,\" Javo said finally. \"You have the most sensitive receptors of us all. But are you sure?\"  \"I am sure. It was the thought-form of a living Master.\"  \"Do you think that the Master perceived your web?\"  \"It is certain. Those who built us are stronger than we.\"  \"That is true. As they promised, then, so long and long ago, our Masters are returning home to us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jarvis Hilton of Terra, the youngest man yet to be assigned to direct any such tremendous deep-space undertaking as Project Theta Orionis, sat in conference with his two seconds-in-command. Assistant Director Sandra Cummings, analyst-synthesist and semantician, was tall, blonde and svelte. Planetographer William Karns--a black-haired, black-browed, black-eyed man of thirty--was third in rank of the scientific group.  \"I'm telling you, Jarve, you can't have it both ways,\" Karns declared. \"Captain Sawtelle is old-school Navy brass. He goes strictly by the book. So you've got to draw a razor-sharp line; exactly where the Advisory Board's directive puts it. And next time he sticks his ugly puss across that line, kick his face in. You've been Caspar Milquetoast Two ever since we left Base.\"  \"That's the way it looks to you?\" Hilton's right hand became a fist. \"The man has age, experience and ability. I've been trying to meet him on a ground of courtesy and decency.\"  \"Exactly. And he doesn't recognize the existence of either. And, since the Board rammed you down his throat instead of giving him old Jeffers, you needn't expect him to.\"  \"You may be right, Bill. What do you think, Dr. Cummings?\"  The girl said: \"Bill's right. Also, your constant appeasement isn't doing the morale of the whole scientific group a bit of good.\"  \"Well, I haven't enjoyed it, either. So next time I'll pin his ears back. Anything else?\"  \"Yes, Dr. Hilton, I have a squawk of my own. I know I was rammed down your throat, but just when are you going to let me do some work?\"  \"None of us has much of anything to do yet, and won't have until we light somewhere. You're off base a country mile.\"  \"I'm not off base. You _did_ want Eggleston, not me.\"  \"Sure I did. I've worked with him and know what he can do. But I'm not holding a grudge about it.\"  \"No? Why, then, are you on first-name terms with everyone in the scientific group except me? Supposedly your first assistant?\"  \"That's easy!\" Hilton snapped. \"Because you've been carrying chips on both shoulders ever since you came aboard ... or at least I thought you were.\" Hilton grinned suddenly and held out his hand. \"Sorry, Sandy--I'll start all over again.\"  \"I'm sorry too, Chief.\" They shook hands warmly. \"I _was_ pretty stiff, I guess, but I'll be good.\"  \"You'll go to work right now, too. As semantician. Dig out that directive and tear it down. Draw that line Bill talked about.\"  \"Can do, boss.\" She swung to her feet and walked out of the room, her every movement one of lithe and easy grace.  Karns followed her with his eyes. \"Funny. A trained-dancer Ph.D. And a Miss America type, like all the other women aboard this spacer. I wonder if she'll make out.\"  \"So do I. I still wish they'd given me Eggy. I've never seen an executive-type female Ph.D. yet that was worth the cyanide it would take to poison her.\"  \"That's what Sawtelle thinks of you, too, you know.\"  \"I know; and the Board _does_ know its stuff. So I'm really hoping, Bill, that she surprises me as much as I intend to surprise the Navy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Alarm bells clanged as the mighty _Perseus_ blinked out of overdrive. Every crewman sprang to his post.  \"Mister Snowden, why did we emerge without orders from me?\" Captain Sawtelle bellowed, storming into the control room three jumps behind Hilton.  \"The automatics took control, sir,\" he said, quietly.  \"Automatics! I _give_ the orders!\"  \"In this case, Captain Sawtelle, you don't,\" Hilton said. Eyes locked and held. To Sawtelle, this was a new and strange co-commander. \"I would suggest that we discuss this matter in private.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" Sawtelle said; and in the captain's cabin Hilton opened up.  \"For your information, Captain Sawtelle, I set my inter-space coupling detectors for any objective I choose. When any one of them reacts, it trips the kickers and we emerge. During any emergency outside the Solar System I am in command--with the provision that I must relinquish command to you in case of armed attack on us.\"  \"Where do you think you found any such stuff as that in the directive? It isn't there and I know my rights.\"  \"It is, and you don't. Here is a semantic chart of the whole directive. As you will note, it overrides many Navy regulations. Disobedience of my orders constitutes mutiny and I can--and will--have you put in irons and sent back to Terra for court-martial. Now let's go back.\"  In the control room, Hilton said, \"The target has a mass of approximately five hundred metric tons. There is also a significant amount of radiation characteristic of uranexite. You will please execute search, Captain Sawtelle.\"  And Captain Sawtelle ordered the search.  \"What did you do to the big jerk, boss?\" Sandra whispered.  \"What you and Bill suggested,\" Hilton whispered back. \"Thanks to your analysis of the directive--pure gobbledygook if there ever was any--I could. Mighty good job, Sandy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Ten or fifteen more minutes passed. Then:  \"Here's the source of radiation, sir,\" a searchman reported. \"It's a point source, though, not an object at this range.\"  \"And here's the artifact, sir,\" Pilot Snowden said. \"We're coming up on it fast. But ... but what's a _skyscraper_ skeleton doing out here in interstellar space?\"  As they closed up, everyone could see that the thing did indeed look like the metallic skeleton of a great building. It was a huge cube, measuring well over a hundred yards along each edge. And it was empty.  \"_That's_ one for the book,\" Sawtelle said.  \"And how!\" Hilton agreed. \"I'll take a boat ... no, suits would be better. Karns, Yarborough, get Techs Leeds and Miller and suit up.\"  \"You'll need a boat escort,\" Sawtelle said. \"Mr. Ashley, execute escort Landing Craft One, Two, and Three.\"  The three landing craft approached that enigmatic lattice-work of structural steel and stopped. Five grotesquely armored figures wafted themselves forward on pencils of force. Their leader, whose suit bore the number \"14\", reached a mammoth girder and worked his way along it up to a peculiar-looking bulge. The whole immense structure vanished, leaving men and boats in empty space.  Sawtelle gasped. \"Snowden! Are you holding 'em?\"  \"No, sir. Faster than light; hyperspace, sir.\"  \"Mr. Ashby, did you have your interspace rigs set?\"  \"No, sir. I didn't think of it, sir.\"  \"Doctor Cummings, why weren't yours out?\"  \"I didn't think of such a thing, either--any more than you did,\" Sandra said.  Ashby, the Communications Officer, had been working the radio. \"No reply from anyone, sir,\" he reported.  \"Oh, no!\" Sandra exclaimed. Then, \"But look! They're firing pistols--especially the one wearing number fourteen--but _pistols_?\"  \"Recoil pistols--sixty-threes--for emergency use in case of power failure,\" Ashby explained. \"That's it ... but I can't see why _all_ their power went out at once. But Fourteen--that's Hilton--is really doing a job with that sixty-three. He'll be here in a couple of minutes.\"  And he was. \"Every power unit out there--suits and boats both--drained,\" Hilton reported. \"_Completely_ drained. Get some help out there fast!\"         *       *       *       *       *  In an enormous structure deep below the surface of a far-distant world a group of technicians clustered together in front of one section of a two-miles long control board. They were staring at a light that had just appeared where no light should have been.  \"Someone's brain-pan will be burned out for this,\" one of the group radiated harshly. \"That unit was inactivated long ago and it has not been reactivated.\"  \"Someone committed an error, Your Loftiness?\"  \"Silence, fool! Stretts do not commit errors!\"         *       *       *       *       *  As soon as it was clear that no one had been injured, Sawtelle demanded, \"How about it, Hilton?\"  \"Structurally, it was high-alloy steel. There were many bulges, possibly containing mechanisms. There were drive-units of a non-Terran type. There were many projectors, which--at a rough guess--were a hundred times as powerful as any I have ever seen before. There were no indications that the thing had ever been enclosed, in whole or in part. It certainly never had living quarters for warm-blooded, oxygen-breathing eaters of organic food.\"  Sawtelle snorted. \"You mean it never had a crew?\"  \"Not necessarily....\"  \"Bah! What other kind of intelligent life is there?\"  \"I don't know. But before we speculate too much, let's look at the tri-di. The camera may have caught something I missed.\"  It hadn't.
