A narrow, wooded valley seemed to occupy the space between the ridge on which they stood and the next one parallel to it to the northward.  \"It ought to be a good place down there to hide and rest,\" said Albert.  \"I think you're right,\" said Dick, \"and we'll go down the slope part of the way before we camp for the night.\"  They found the descent easy.  It was still open forest, mostly pine with a sprinkling of ash and oak, and it was warmer on the northern side, the winds having but little sweep there.  The moon became brighter, but it remained cold and pitiless, recking nothing of the tragedy in the pass.  It gave Dick a chill to look at it.  But he spent most of the time watching among the trees for some sheltered spot that Nature had made.  It was over an hour before he found it, a hollow among rocks, with dwarf pines clustering thickly at the sides and in front.  It was so well hidden that he would have missed it had he not been looking for just such a happy alcove, and at first he was quite sure that some wild animal must be using it as a den.  He poked in the barrel of his rifle, but nothing flew out, and then, pulling back the pine boughs, he saw no signs of a previous occupation.  \"It's just waiting for us, Al, old fellow,\" he said gayly, \"but nothing of this kind is so good that it can't be made better. Look at all those dead leaves over there under the oaks.  Been drying ever since last year and full of warmth.\"  They raked the dead leaves into the nook, covering the floor of it thickly, and piling them up on the sides as high as they would stay, and then they lay down inside, letting the pine boughs in front fall back into place.  It was really warm and cozy in there for two boys who had been living out of doors for weeks, and Dick drew a deep, long breath of content.  \"Suppose a panther should come snooping along,\" said Albert, \"and think this the proper place for his bed and board?\"  \"He'd never come in, don't you fear.  He'd smell us long before he got here, and then strike out in the other direction.\"  Albert was silent quite a while, and as he made no noise, Dick thought he was asleep.  But Albert spoke at last, though he spoke low and his tone was very solemn.  \"Dick,\" he said, \"we've really got a lot to be thankful for.  You know that.\"  \"I certainly do,\" said Dick with emphasis.  \"Now you go to sleep, Al.\"  Albert was silent again, and presently his breathing became very steady and regular.  Dick touched him and saw that he was fast asleep.  Then the older boy took off his coat and carefully spread it on the younger, after which he raked a great lot of the dry leaves over himself, and soon he, too, was sound asleep.  Dick awoke far in the night and stirred in his bed of leaves. But the movement caused him a little pain, and he wondered dimly, because he had not yet fully come through the gates of sleep, and he did not remember where he was or what had happened.  A tiny shaft of pale light fell on his forehead, and he looked up through pine branches.  It was the moon that sent the beam down upon him, but he could see nothing else.  He stirred again and the little pain returned.  Then all of it came back to him.  Dick reached out his hand and touched Albert.  His brother was sleeping soundly, and he was still warm, the coat having protected him.  But Dick was cold, despite the pines, the rocks, and the leaves.  It was the cold that had caused the slight pain in his joints when he moved, but he rose softly lest he wake Albert, and slipped outside, standing in a clear space between the pines.  The late moon was of uncommon brilliancy.  It seemed a molten mass of burnished silver, and its light fell over forest and valley, range and peak.  The trees on the slopes stood out like lacework, but far down in the valley the light seemed to shimmer like waves on a sea of silver mist.  It was all inexpressibly cold, and of a loneliness that was uncanny.  Nothing stirred, not a twig, not a blade of grass.  It seemed to Dick that if even a leaf fell on the far side of the mountain he could hear it.  It was a great, primeval world, voiceless and unpeopled, brooding in a dread and mystic silence.  Dick shivered.  He had shivered often that night, but now the chill went to the marrow.  It was the chill the first man must have felt when he was driven from the garden and faced the globe-girdling forest.  He came back to the rock covert and leaned over until he could hear his brother breathing beneath the pine boughs.  Then he felt the surge of relief, of companionship--after all, he was not alone in the wilderness!--and returned to the clear space between the pines.  There he walked up and down briskly, swinging his arms, exercising all his limbs, until the circulation was fully restored and he was warm again.  Dick felt the immensity of the problem that lay before him--one that he alone must solve if it were to be solved at all.  He and Albert had escaped the massacre, but how were they to live in that wilderness of mountains?  It was not alone the question of food.  How were they to save themselves from death by exposure? Those twinges in his knees had been warning signs.  Oddly enough, his mind now fastened upon one thing.  He was longing for the lost buffalo robe, his first great prize.  It had been so large and so warm, and the fur was so soft.  It would cover both Albert and himself, and keep them warm on the coldest night.  If they only had it now!  He thought more of that robe just then than he did of the food that they would need in the morning.  Cast forth upon a primeval world, this first want occupied his mind to the exclusion of all others.  He returned to the rocky alcove presently, and lay down again. He was too young and too healthy to remain awake long, despite the full measure of their situation, and soon he slept soundly once more.  He was first to awake in the morning, and the beam that struck upon his forehead was golden instead of silver.  It was warm, too, and cheerful, and as Dick parted the branches and looked out, he saw that the sun was riding high.  It had been daylight a full three hours at least, but it did not matter.  Time was perhaps the only commodity of which he and Albert now had enough and to spare.  He took his coat off Albert and put it on himself, lest Albert might suspect, and then began to sing purposely, with loudness and levity, an old farm rhyme that had been familiar to the boys of his vicinity:  \"Wake up, Jake, the day is breaking. The old cow died, her tail shaking.\"  Albert sat up, rubbed his eyes, and stared at Dick and the wilderness.  \"Now look at him!\" cried Dick.  \"He thinks he's been called too early.  He thinks he'd like to sleep eight or ten hours longer! Get up, little boy!  Yes, it's Christmas morning!  Come and see what good old Santa has put in your stocking!\"  Albert yawned again and laughed.  Really, Dick was such a cheerful, funny fellow that he always kept one in good spirits. Good old Dick!  \"Old Santa filled our stockings, all right,\" continued Dick, \"but he was so busy cramming 'em full of great forests and magnificent scenery that he forgot to leave any breakfast for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to hustle for it.\"  They started down the mountain slope, and presently they came to a swift little brook, in which they bathed their faces, removing, at the same time, fragments of twigs and dried leaves from their hair.  \"That was fine and refreshing,\" said Dick, \"but it doesn't fill my stomach.  Al, I could bite a tenpenny nail in half and digest both pieces, too.\"  \"I don't care for nails,\" said Albert, \"but I think I could gnaw down a good-sized sapling.  Hold me, Dick, or I'll be devouring a pine tree.\"  Both laughed, and put as good a face on it as they could, but they were frightfully hungry, nevertheless.  But they had grown up on farms, and they knew that the woods must contain food of some kind or other.  They began a search, and after a while they found wild plums, now ripe, which they ate freely.  They then felt stronger and better, but, after all, it was a light diet and they must obtain food of more sustenance.  \"There are deer, of course, in this valley,\" said Dick, fingering his rifle, \"and sooner or later we'll get a shot at one of them, but it may be days, and--Al--I've got another plan.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"You know, Al, that I can travel pretty fast anywhere.  Now those Sioux, after cutting down the train and wiping out all the people, would naturally go away.  They'd load themselves up with spoil and scoot.  But a lot, scattered here and there, would be left behind.  Some of the teams would run away in all the shooting and shouting.  And, Al, you and I need those things!  We must have them if we are going to live, and we both want to live!\"  \"Do you mean, Dick, that you're going back down there in that awful pass?\"  \"That's just about what I had on my mind,\" replied Dick cheerfully;  \"and now I've got it off, I feel better.\"  \"But you can never get back alive, Dick!\" exclaimed Albert, his eyes widening in horror at the memory of what they had seen and heard the night before.  \"Get back alive?  Why, of course I will,\" responded Dick.  \"And I'll do more than that, too.  You'll see me come galloping up the mountain, bearing hogsheads and barrels of provisions.  But, seriously, Al, it must be done.  If I don't go, we'll starve to death.\"  \"Then I'm going, too.\"  \"No, Al, old boy, you're not strong enough just yet, though you will be soon.  There are certainly no Sioux in this little valley, and it would be well if you were to go back up the slope and stay in the pine shelter.  It's likely that I'll be gone nearly all day, but don't be worried.  You'll have one of the rifles with you, and you know how to use it.\"  Albert had a clear and penetrating mind, and he saw the truth of Dick's words.  They went back up the slope, where he crept within the pine shelter and lay "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22464"],["title","The Last of the Chiefs: A Story of the Great Sioux War (#8)"],["body","on the leaves, while Dick went alone on his mission.     Chapter IV Treasure-Trove  When Dick passed the crest of the ridge and began the descent toward the fatal pass, his heart beat heavily.  The terror and shock of the night before, those distant shots and shouts, returned to him, and it was many minutes before he could shake off a dread that was almost superstitious in its nature.  But youth, health, and the sunlight conquered.  The day was uncommonly brilliant.  The mountains rolled back, green on the slopes, blue at the crests, and below him, like a brown robe, lay the wavering plain across which they had come.  Dick could see no sign of human life down there.  No rejoicing Sioux warrior galloped over the swells, no echo of a triumphant war whoop came to his ear.  Over mountain and plain alike the silence of the desert brooded.  But high above the pass great black birds wheeled on lazy pinions.  Dick believed more strongly than ever that the Sioux had gone away.  Savage tribes do not linger over a battlefield that is finished; yet as he reached the bottom of the slope his heart began to beat heavily again, and he was loath to leave the protecting shadow of the pines.  He fingered his rifle, passing his hand gently over the barrel and the trigger.  It was a fine weapon, a beautiful weapon, and just at this moment it was a wonderful weapon.  He felt in its full force, for the first time in his life, what the rifle meant to the pioneer.  The boy, after much hesitation and a great searching of eye and ear, entered the pass.  At once the sunlight dimmed.  Walls as straight as the side of a house rose above him three of four hundred feet, while the distance between was not more than thirty feet.  Dwarf pines grew here and there in the crannies of the cliffs, but mostly the black rock showed.  Dwarf pines also grew at the bottom of the pass close to either cliff, and Dick kept among them, bending far down and advancing very slowly.  Fifty yards were passed, and still there was no sound save a slight moaning through the pass, which Dick knew was the sigh of the wind drawn into the narrow cleft.  It made him shudder, and had he not been of uncommon courage he would have turned back.  He looked up.  The great black birds, wheeling on lazy pinions, seemed to have sunk lower.  That made him shudder, too, but it was another confirmation of his belief that all the Sioux had gone.  He went eight or ten yards farther and then stopped short. Before him lay two dead horses and an overturned wagon.  Both horses had been shot, and were still in their gear attached to the wagon.  Dick examined the wagon carefully, and as he yet heard and saw no signs of a human being save himself, his courage grew.  It was a big wagon of the kind used for crossing the plains, with boxes around the inside like lockers.  Almost everything of value had been taken by the Sioux, but in one of the lockers Dick was lucky enough to find a large, heavy, gray blanket.  He rolled it up at once, and with a strap cut from the horse's gear tied it on his back, after the fashion of a soldier on the march.  \"The first great treasure!\" he murmured exultantly.  \"Now for the next!\"  He found in the same wagon, jammed under the driver's seat and hidden from hasty view, about the half of a side of bacon--ten pounds, perhaps.  Dick fairly laughed when he got his hands upon it, and he clasped it lovingly, as if it were a ten-pound nugget of pure gold.  But it was far better than gold just then.  He wrapped it in a piece of canvas which he cut from the cover of the wagon, and tied it on his back above the blanket.  Finding nothing more of value in the wagon, he resumed his progress up the pass.  It was well for Dick that he was stout-hearted, and well for him, too, that he was driven by great need, else he would surely have gone back.  He was now come into the thick of it.  Around him everywhere lay the fallen, and the deeds done in Indian warfare were not lacking.  Sam Conway lay upon his side, and brutal as the man had been, Dick felt grief when he saw him.  Here were others, too, that he knew, and he counted the bodies of the few women who had been with the train.  They had died probably in the battle like the rest.  They, like the men, had been hardened, rough, and coarse of speech and act, but Dick felt grief, too, when he saw them.  Nearly all the animals had been slain also in the fury of the attack, and they were scattered far up the pass.  Dick resolutely turned his face away from the dead and began to glean among the wagons for what the Sioux might have left.  All these wagons were built like the first that he had searched, and he was confident that he would find much of value.  Nor was he disappointed.  He found three more blankets, and in their own wagon the buffalo robe that he had lamented.  Doubtless, its presence there was accounted for by the fact that the Sioux did not consider a buffalo robe a trophy of their victory over white men.  Other treasures were several boxes of crackers, about twenty boxes of sardines, three flasks of brandy, suitable for illness, a heavy riding cloak, a Virginia ham, two boxes of matches, a small iron skillet, and an empty tin canteen.  He might have searched further, but he realized that time was passing, and that Albert must be on the verge of starvation.  He had forgotten his own hunger in the excitement of seek and find, but it came back now and gnawed at him fiercely.  Yet he would not touch any of the food.  No matter how great the temptation he would not take a single bite until Albert had the same chance.  He now made all his treasures into one great package, except the buffalo robe.  That was too heavy to add to the others, and he tied it among the boughs of a pine, where the wolves could not reach it.  Then, with the big pack on his back, he began the return.  It was more weight than he would have liked to carry at an ordinary time, but now in his elation he scarcely felt it.  He went rapidly up the slope and by the middle of the afternoon was going down the other side.  As he approached the pine alcove he whistled a familiar tune, popular at the time--\"Silver Threads Among the Gold.\"  He knew that Albert, if he were there--and he surely must be there--would recognize his whistle and come forth.  He stopped, and his heart hammered for a moment, but Albert's whistle took up the second line of the air and Albert himself came forth jauntily.  \"We win, Al, old boy!\" called Dick.  \"Just look at this pack!\"  \"I can't look at anything else,\" replied Albert in the same joyful tones.  \"It's so big that I don't see you under it.  Dick, have you robbed a treasure ship?\"  \"No, Al,\" replied Dick, very soberly.  \"I haven't robbed a treasure ship, but I've been prowling with success over a lost battlefield--a ghoul I believe they call such a person, but it had to be done.  I've enough food here to last a week at least, and we may find more.\"  He put down his pack and took out the bacon.  As Albert looked at it he began unconsciously to clinch and unclinch his teeth.  Dick saw his face, and, knowing that the same eager look was in his own, he laughed a little.  \"Al,\" he said, \"you and I know now how wolves often feel, but we're not going to behave like wolves.  We're going to light a fire and cook this bacon.  We'll take the risk of the flame or smoke being seen by Sioux.  In so vast a country the chances are all in our favor.\"  They gathered up pine cones and other fallen wood, and with the help of the matches soon had a fire.  Then they cut strips of bacon and fried them on the ends of sharpened sticks, the sputter making the finest music in their ears.  Never before had either tasted food so delicious, and they ate strip after strip.  Dick noticed with pleasure how the color came into Albert's cheeks, and how his eyes began to sparkle. Sleeping under the pines seemed to have benefited instead of injuring him, and certainly there was a wonderful healing balm in the air of that pine-clad mountain slope.  Dick could feel it himself.  How strong he was after eating!  He shook his big shoulders.  \"What are you bristling up about?\" asked Albert.  \"Merely getting ready to start again,\" replied Dick.  \"You know the old saying, Al, 'you've got to hit while the iron's hot.'  More treasure is down there in the pass, but if we wait it won't stay there.  Everything that we get now is worth more to us than diamonds.\"  \"It's so,\" said Albert, and then he sighed sadly as he added, \"How I wish I were strong enough to go with you and help!\"  \"Just you wait,\" said Dick.  \"You'll be as strong as a horse in a month, and then you'll have to do all the work and bring me my breakfast in the morning as I lie in bed.  Besides, you'd have to stay here and guard the treasure that we already have.  Better get into the pine den.  Bears and wolves may be drawn by the scent of the food, and they might think of attacking you.\"  They put out the fire, and while Albert withdrew into the pine shelter, Dick started again over the mountain.  The sun was setting blood red in the west, and in the east the shadows of twilight were advancing.  It required a new kind of courage to enter the pass in the night, and Dick's shudders returned.  At certain times there is something in the dark that frightens the bravest and those most used to it.  Dick hurried.  He knew the way down the mountain now, and after the food and rest he was completely refreshed.  But as fast as he went the shadows of twilight came faster, and when he reached the bottom of the mountain it was quite dark.  The plain before him was invisible, and the forest on the slope behind him was a solid robe of black.  Dick set foot in the pass and then stopped.  It was not dread but awe that thrilled him in every vein.  He saw nothing before him but the well of darkness that was the great slash in the mountains.  The wind, caught between the walls, moaned as in the day, and he knew perfectly well"]]]
