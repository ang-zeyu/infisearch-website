Especially between Athena and Aphrodite.\"  \"And?\"  \"It's obvious. Since I'm an acolyte of Athena, it may be that Aphrodite wished to keep my arrest secret.\"  \"I doubt it,\" the High Priestess said.  Forrester wished he could believe her. But his own theory looked uncomfortably plausible. \"It certainly looks as if I'm right.\"  \"Well--\" For a second the High Priestess paled visibly, the freckles that went with her red hair standing out clearly on her face and giving her the disturbing appearance of an eleven-year-old. No eleven-year-old, however, Forrester reminded himself, had ever been built like the High Priestess.  Then she regained her color and laughed, all in an instant. \"For a minute,\" she said in a light tone, \"you almost convinced me of your forebodings. But there's nothing in them. There couldn't be.\"  Forrester opened his mouth, and _Why not?_ was on his lips. But he never got a chance to say the words. The High Priestess blinked and peered more closely at his face, and before he had a chance to speak she asked him: \"What happened to you?\"  \"A small accident,\" Forrester said quickly. It was a lie, but he thought a pardonable one. The truth was just too complicated to spin out; he had no real intent to deceive.  But the High Priestess shook her head. \"No,\" she said. \"Not an accident. A fight. Your hands are skinned and bruised.\"  \"Very well,\" Forrester said. \"It was a fight. But I was attacked, and entitled to defend myself.\"  \"I'm sure,\" the High Priestess said. \"Yet I have a question for you. Who won?\"  \"Won? I did. Naturally.\"  It sounded boastful, he reflected, but it wasn't. He had won, and it had been natural to him to do so. His build and strength, as well as his speed, had made any other outcome unlikely.  And the High Priestess didn't seem to take offense. She said only: \"I thought so. Just a moment.\" Then she walked over to a telephone. It was a simple act but Forrester watched it fervently. First she stood up, and then she took a step, and then another step ... and her whole body moved. And moved.  It was marvelous. He watched her bend down to pick up the phone without any clear idea of the meaning of the motions. The motions themselves were enough. Every curve and jiggle and bounce was engraved forever on his mind.  The High Priestess dialed a number, waited and said: \"Aphrodite's compliments to Hermes the Healer.\"  An indistinguishable voice answered her from the receiver.  \"Aphrodite thanks you,\" the High Priestess said, \"and asks if Hermes might send one of his priests around for a few minor ministrations.\"  The receiver said something else.  \"No,\" the High Priestess said. \"Nothing like that. Don't you think we have other interests--such as they are?\"  Again the receiver.  \"Just a black eye and some skin lacerations,\" the High Priestess said. \"Nothing serious.\"  And the receiver replied once more.  \"Very well,\" the High Priestess said. \"Aphrodite wishes you well.\" She hung up.  She came back to the couch, Forrester's eyes following her every inch of the way. She sat down, looked up and said: \"What's the matter? Do I bore you?\"  \"_Bore_ me?\" Forrester all but cried.  \"It's just--well, nothing, I suppose,\" the High Priestess said. \"Your expression.\"  \"Training,\" Forrester explained. \"An acolyte does well not to express his emotions too clearly.\"  The High Priestess nodded casually and patted the couch at her side. \"Sit down here, next to me.\"  Forrester did so, gingerly.  A moment of silence ensued.  Then Forrester, gathering courage, said: \"Thank you for getting a Healer. But I'd like to ask you--\"  \"Yes?\"  \"How do you know I'm not under some sort of carefully concealed arrest? After all, you said before that you were sure--\"  \"And I am sure,\" the High Priestess said. \"Aphrodite herself has ordered a sacrifice in her favor. A sacrifice from you. And Aphrodite does not accept--much less _order_--a sacrifice from those standing in her disfavor.\"  \"You're--\"  \"I'm sure,\" the High Priestess said.  \"Oh,\" Forrester said. \"Good.\" The world was not quite as black as it could have been. And still, it was not exactly shining white. A sacrifice? And outside the door, Forrester could hear a disturbance.  What did that mean?  Her Concupiscence didn't seem to hear it at first. \"We will perform the rite together and--\" The noise grew louder. \"What's that?\" she said.  It was the sound of argument. Forrester realized what had happened. \"It's the priest from Hermes,\" he said. \"The Healer. You forgot to tell the Captain of Myrmidons to let him in.\"  \"My goodness!\" the High Priestess said. \"So I did! It slipped my mind entirely.\" She touched Forrester's cheek affectionately. \"Of course, I imagine it's only natural to be a bit forgetful when--\" She got up and went to the door.  The Captain and a small, fat priest in a golden-edged tunic were tangled confusedly outside. The High Priestess looked away from them in disdain and said regally: \"You may permit the Healer to enter, Captain.\" The tangle came untied and the little priest scooted in. To him, as the door closed again, the High Priestess whispered: \"Sorry. I didn't expect you quite so soon.\"  \"No more did I!\" The priest waved his caduceus furiously, so that it seemed as if the twin snakes twined round it were moving, the two wings above them beating, and the ball surmounting all, on top of the staff, traced uneasy designs in the air. \"Myrmidons!\" he said.  \"I certainly regret--\"  \"If you boiled down their brains for the fat content, one alone would supply the Temple with candles for a year! Just beef and nothing more! Beef! Beef!\"  Then, with a start, he seemed to see the High Priestess for the first time, and his tone changed. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Good evening, Your Concupiscence.\"  \"Good evening,\" the High Priestess said in an indulgent tone.  \"Well, well, well,\" the priest said. \"What seems to be the trouble? My goodness. It must be important, sure enough--certainly important.\" His little round red eager face seemed to shine as he went on. \"Hermes himself transported me here just as soon as you called!\"  \"Really?\"  \"Oh, my, yes,\" the priest said. \"Just as soon as ever. Yes. Hm. And you can believe me when I tell you--believe me, Your Concupiscence--take my word when I tell you--\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Hermes,\" the priest said. \"Hermes doesn't often take such an interest--I may say such a _personal_ interest--in a mortal, I'll tell you. And you can believe me when I do tell you that. I do.\"  \"I'm sure,\" the High Priestess said.  \"Yes,\" the priest said, waving his caduceus gently. He blinked. \"Where's the patient? The mortal?\"  \"He's over here,\" the High Priestess said, motioning to Forrester sitting awestruck on the couch. Priests of Hermes were common enough sights--but a priest like this was something new and strange in his experience.  \"Ah,\" the priest said, twinkling at him. \"So there you are, eh? Over there? You _are_ sitting over _there_, aren't you?\"  \"That's right,\" Forrester said blankly.  \"Now listen to me carefully,\" the High Priestess said. \"You're not to ask his name, or mention anything about this visit to anyone--understand?\"  The priest blinked. \"Oh, certainly. Absolutely. Without doubt. I've already been told that, you might say. Already. Certainly. Wouldn't think of such a thing.\" He moved over and stood near Forrester, peering down at him. \"My goodness,\" he said. \"Let me see that eye, young man.\"  Forrester turned his head wordlessly.  \"Oh, my, yes,\" the priest said. \"Black indeed. Very black. A fight. My, yes. An altercation, disagreement, discussion, battle--\"  \"Yes,\" Forrester cut in.  \"Certainly you have,\" the priest said. \"And what'd the other fellow look like, eh? Beaten, I'll bet. You look a strong type.\"  Forrester relaxed. It was the only thing to do while the priest babbled on, touching his wounds gently as he did so with various parts of his caduceus. The pain vanished with a touch of the left wingtip, and the lacerations healed instantly as they were caressed with first one and then another of the various coils of the snakes.  But Forrester now was free to worry. Arrest was out of the question. As the High Priestess had said, on the evidence it was clear that Aphrodite intended to honor him in some way. And there was nothing at all, he thought, wrong with an honor from the Goddess of Love.  But another sacrifice? After the sacrifice to Aphrodite he'd made earlier, and the fight he'd gotten into, he just didn't quite feel up to it. It wouldn't do to refuse, but ...  \"Well,\" the priest said, stepping back. \"Well, well. You ought to be all right now, young fellow--right as rain.\"  Forrester said: \"Thanks.\"  \"Might feel a little soreness--tenderness, you might say--for a day or so. Only a day or so, tenderness,\" the priest said. \"After that, right as rain. Right as you'll ever be. _All_ right, as a matter of fact: all right.\"  Forrester said: \"Thanks.\"  The priest went to the door, turned, and said to the High Priestess: \"Hermes' blessing on you both, as a matter of fact, as they say. Blessings from Hermes on you both.\"  The High Priestess nodded regally.  \"And,\" the priest said, \"merely by the way, as it might be, without meaning harm, if you would ask a blessing for me--Aphrodite's blessing? Easy for you. Of course, it would be nice curing--curing, as they say--stupidity, plain dumbness, as they call such things--curing stupidity as easily as I can cure small ills. Nice.\"  \"Indeed,\" the High Priestess said.  \"But there,\" the priest went on. \"Only the Gods can cure that. Only the Gods and no one else. Yes. Hm. And not often. They don't do anything like that in the--ah--regular course of things. As a matter of fact, you might say, I've never heard of--never heard of such a case. Never. Not one. Yet ...\" He opened the door, spat: \"Myrmidons!\" and disappeared into the hallway.  The door banged shut.  Forrester "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22767"],["title","Pagan Passions (#8)"],["body","heavily. The High Priestess turned to him.  \"Feel better?\" she asked.  \"Much,\" Forrester said, dreading the ordeal to come.  The High Priestess came over to the couch and sat down next to him. She put a hand on his shoulder. \"Shall we prepare for the--sacrifice?\"  Forrester sighed again. \"Sure,\" he said. \"Naturally.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When she was locked in his arms, it was as if time had started all over again. Forrester responded to the eagerness of the woman as he'd never dreamed he could respond; all his tiredness dropped away as if it had never been, and he was a new man. He touched her bare flesh and felt the heat of her through his fingers and hands; with his arms around her nakedness he rolled, locked to her, feeling the friction of skin against skin and the magnificence of her.  The sacrifice went on ... and on ... and on into endless time and endless space. Forrester thrust and gasped at the woman and her head went back, her mouth pulled open as she shivered and responded to him....  Forever....  Until finally they lay, panting, in the magnificent room. Forrester rose first, vaguely surprised at himself. He found a towel in a closet at the far end of the room and wiped his damp forehead slowly.  \"Well,\" he said. \"That was quite a sacrifice. What next?\"  The High Priestess raised herself on one elbow and stared across the room at him. \"There is no need for such familiarity, Forrester,\" she said. \"Not from a lay acolyte.\"  Forrester tossed the towel onto a couch. \"My apologies, Your Concupiscence. I'm a little--light-headed. But what happens next?\"  The High Priestess reached into the diaphanous pile of her clothing and came up with a small diamond-encrusted watch she wore, usually, on her wrist. \"Our timing was almost perfect,\" she said. \"It is now twenty-hundred hours. The Goddess expects you at twenty-oh-one exactly.\"  A hurried half-minute passed. Then, fully dressed, Forrester went with the High Priestess to a golden door half-hidden in the hangings at the side of the room. She made a series of mystical signs: the circle, the serpent and others Forrester couldn't quite follow.  She opened the door, genuflecting as she did so, and Forrester dropped to one knee behind her, looking at the doorway.  It was filled with a pale blue haze that looked like the clear summer sky on a hot day. Except that it wasn't sky, but a curtain that wavered and shimmered before his eyes. Beyond it, he could see nothing.  The High Priestess rose from her genuflection and Forrester followed suit. There was a sole second of silence.  Then the High Priestess said: \"You are to step through the Veil of Heaven, William Forrester.\"  Forrester said: \"_Me?_ Through the _Veil of Heaven_?\"  \"Don't be afraid,\" she said. \"And don't try to touch the Veil. Just walk through as if nothing at all were there.\"  Forrester filled his lungs as though he were going to take a very high dive. He thought: _Here goes nothing_. That was all; there wasn't time for anything else.  He stepped into the blue haze, and had a sudden sensation of falling.     CHAPTER FIVE   There was a tingle like a mild electric shock. Forrester opened his mouth and then closed it again as the tingle stopped, and the sense of falling simply died away. He had closed his eyes on the way into the curtain, and now he opened them again.  He closed them very quickly, counted to ten, and took a deep breath. Then he opened them to look at the room he was in.  It was unlike any room he had ever seen before. It didn't have the opulence of the High Priestess's rooms. I am a room, it seemed to say, and a room is what I was meant to be. I don't have to draw attention to myself like my poorer sisters. I am content merely to exist as the room of rooms, the very type and image of the Ideal Enclosure.  The floors and walk of the place seemed to blend into each other at odd angles. Forrester's eyes couldn't quite follow them or understand them, and judging the size of the room was out of the question. There was a golden wash of light filling the room, though it didn't seem to come from anywhere in particular. It was, in fact, as if the room itself were shining. Forrester blinked and rubbed his eyes. The light, or whatever it was, was changing color.  Gradually, he realized that it went on doing that. He wasn't sure that he liked it, but it was certainly different. The colors went from gold to pale rose to violet to blue, and so on, back to gold again, while little eddies and swirls of light sparkled into rainbows here and there.  Forrester began to feel dizzy again.  There were various objects standing around here and there in the room, but Forrester couldn't quite tell what they were. Even their sizes were difficult to judge, because of the shifting light and shape of the room itself. There was only one thing that seemed reasonably certain.  He was alone in the room.  Set in one wall was a square of light that didn't change color quite as much as everything else. Forrester judged it to be a window and headed for it. With his first step, he discovered something else about the place.  The carpeting was completely unique. Instead of fiber, the floor seemed to have been covered a foot deep with foam rubber. Forrester didn't exactly walk to the window; he bounced there. The sensation was almost enjoyable, he thought, when you got used to it. He wondered just how long it took to get used to it and settled on eighty years as a good first guess.  He stood in front of the window. He looked out.  He saw nothing but clouds and sky.  It took a long while for him to decide what to do next, and when he finally did come to a decision, it was the wrong one.  He looked down.  Below him there were tumbled rocks, ledges of ice and snow, clouds and--far, far below--the flat land of the Earth. He wanted to shut his eyes, but he couldn't. The whole vast stomach-churning panorama spread out beneath him endlessly. The people below, if there were any, weren't even big enough to be ants. They were completely invisible. Forrester took a deep breath and gripped the side ledges of the window.  And a voice behind him said: \"Welcome, Mortal.\"  Forrester almost went through the window. But he managed to regain his balance and turn around, saying angrily: \"Don't _do_ that!\" As the last of the words left his lips, he became aware of the smiling figure facing him.  She was standing in a spotlight, Forrester thought at first. Then he saw that the light was coming from the woman herself--or from her clothing. The dress she wore was a satinlike sheath that glowed with an aura even brighter than the room. Her blonde hair picked up the radiance and glowed, too, illuminating a face that was at once regal, inviting and passionate. It was, Forrester thought, a hell of a disturbing combination.  The cloth of the dress clung to her figure as if it wanted to. Forrester didn't blame it a bit; the dress showed off a figure that was not only beyond his wildest dreams, but a long way beyond what he had hitherto regarded as the bounds of possibility. From shoulder to toe, she was perfection.  This was also true of the woman from shoulder to crown.  Forrester gulped and, automatically, went on one knee.  \"Please,\" he murmured. \"Pardon me. I didn't mean--\"  \"Quite all right,\" the Goddess murmured. \"I understand perfectly.\"  \"But I--\"  \"Never mind all that now,\" Venus said, with just a hint of impatience. \"Rise, William Forrester--or you who were William Forrester.\"  Forrester rose. Sweat was pouring down his face. He made no effort to wipe it away. \"Were?\" he asked, dazed. \"But that's my name!\"  \"It _was_,\" Venus said, in the same calm tone. \"Henceforth, your name is Dionysus.\"  Forrester took a while to remember to swallow. \"Dionysus?\" he said at last.  There was another silence.  Forrester, feeling that perhaps his first question could use some amplification, said: \"Dionysus? Bacchus? You mean me?\"  \"Quite right,\" Venus said. \"That will be your name, and you'd better begin getting used to it.\"  \"Now wait a minute!\" he said. \"I don't mean to be disrespectful, but something occurs to me. I mean, it's the first thing I thought of, and I'm probably wrong, but just let me ask the questions, if you don't mind, and maybe some of this will make some sense. Because just a few hours ago I was doing very nicely on my own and I--\"  \"What are your questions?\" Venus said.  Forrester swayed. \"Dionysus/Bacchus himself,\" he said. \"Won't he mind my--\"  Venus laughed. \"Mind your using his name? My goodness, no.\"  \"But--\"  \"It's all because of the orgies,\" Venus said.  Everything, he told himself, was getting just a little too much for him. \"Orgies?\" he said.  Venus nodded. \"You see, there are all those orgies held in his honor. You know about those, of course.\"  \"Sure I do,\" Forrester said, watching everything narrowly. In just a few seconds, he told himself hopefully, the whole room would vanish and he would be in a nice, peaceful insane asylum.  \"Well, it isn't impossible for a God to be at all the orgies held in his honor,\" Venus said. \"Naturally not. But, at the same time, they are all rather boring--for a God, I mean. And that's why you're here,\" she finished.  Forrester said: \"Oh.\" And then he said: \"Oh?\" The room hadn't disappeared yet, but he was willing to give it time.  \"Dionysus,\" Venus said patiently, as if she were explaining the matter to a small and rather ugly child, \"gets tired of appearing at the orgies. He wants someone to take his place.\"  The silence after that sentence was a very long one. Forrester could think of nothing to say but: \"_Me?_\"  \"You will be raised to the status of Godling,\" Venus said. \"You remember Hercules and Achilles, don't you?\"  \"Never met them,\" Forrester said vacantly.  \"Naturally,\" Venus said. \"They were, however, ancient heroes, raised to the status of Godling, just as you yourself will be. However, you will not be honored or worshipped under your own name.\"  Forrester nodded. "]]]
