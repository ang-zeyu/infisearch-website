The numerals of this period are as follows:  [Illustration]  There are several noteworthy points to be observed in studying this system. In the first place, it is probably not as early as that shown in the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t forms hereafter given, although the inscriptions themselves at N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t are later than those of the A['s]oka period. The {21} four is to this system what the X was to the Roman, probably a canceling of three marks as a workman does to-day for five, or a laying of one stick across three others. The ten has never been satisfactorily explained. It is similar to the A of the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] alphabet, but we have no knowledge as to why it was chosen. The twenty is evidently a ligature of two tens, and this in turn suggested a kind of radix, so that ninety was probably written in a way reminding one of the quatre-vingt-dix of the French. The hundred is unexplained, although it resembles the letter _ta_ or _tra_ of the Br[=a]hm[=i] alphabet with 1 before (to the right of) it. The two hundred is only a variant of the symbol for hundred, with two vertical marks.[70]  This system has many points of similarity with the Nabatean numerals[71] in use in the first centuries of the Christian era. The cross is here used for four, and the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] form is employed for twenty. In addition to this there is a trace of an analogous use of a scale of twenty. While the symbol for 100 is quite different, the method of forming the other hundreds is the same. The correspondence seems to be too marked to be wholly accidental.  It is not in the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] numerals, therefore, that we can hope to find the origin of those used by us, and we turn to the second of the Indian types, the Br[=a]hm[=i] characters. The alphabet attributed to Brahm[=a] is the oldest of the several known in India, and was used from the earliest historic times. There are various theories of its origin, {22} none of which has as yet any wide acceptance,[72] although the problem offers hope of solution in due time. The numerals are not as old as the alphabet, or at least they have not as yet been found in inscriptions earlier than those in which the edicts of A['s]oka appear, some of these having been incised in Br[=a]hm[=i] as well as Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i]. As already stated, the older writers probably wrote the numbers in words, as seems to have been the case in the earliest Pali writings of Ceylon.[73]  The following numerals are, as far as known, the only ones to appear in the A['s]oka edicts:[74]  [Illustration]  These fragments from the third century B.C., crude and unsatisfactory as they are, are the undoubted early forms from which our present system developed. They next appear in the second century B.C. in some inscriptions in the cave on the top of the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t hill, about seventy-five miles from Poona in central India. These inscriptions may be memorials of the early Andhra dynasty of southern India, but their chief interest lies in the numerals which they contain.  The cave was made as a resting-place for travelers ascending the hill, which lies on the road from Kaly[=a]na to Junar. It seems to have been cut out by a descendant {23} of King ['S][=a]tav[=a]hana,[75] for inside the wall opposite the entrance are representations of the members of his family, much defaced, but with the names still legible. It would seem that the excavation was made by order of a king named Vedisiri, and \"the inscription contains a list of gifts made on the occasion of the performance of several _yagnas_ or religious sacrifices,\" and numerals are to be seen in no less than thirty places.[76]  There is considerable dispute as to what numerals are really found in these inscriptions, owing to the difficulty of deciphering them; but the following, which have been copied from a rubbing, are probably number forms:[77]  [Illustration]  The inscription itself, so important as containing the earliest considerable Hindu numeral system connected with our own, is of sufficient interest to warrant reproducing part of it in facsimile, as is done on page 24.  {24}  [Illustration]  The next very noteworthy evidence of the numerals, and this quite complete as will be seen, is found in certain other cave inscriptions dating back to the first or second century A.D. In these, the Nasik[78] cave inscriptions, the forms are as follows:  [Illustration]  From this time on, until the decimal system finally adopted the first nine characters and replaced the rest of the Br[=a]hm[=i] notation by adding the zero, the progress of these forms is well marked. It is therefore well to present synoptically the best-known specimens that have come down to us, and this is done in the table on page 25.[79]  {25}  TABLE SHOWING THE PROGRESS OF NUMBER FORMS IN INDIA    NUMERALS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 1000   A['s]oka[80]                [Illustration]   ['S]aka[81]                 [Illustration]   A['s]oka[82]                [Illustration]   N[=a]gar[=i][83]            [Illustration]   Nasik[84]                   [Illustration]   K[s.]atrapa[85]             [Illustration]   Ku[s.]ana [86]              [Illustration]   Gupta[87]                   [Illustration]   Valhab[=i][88]              [Illustration]   Nepal [89]                  [Illustration]   Kali[.n]ga[90]              [Illustration]   V[=a]k[=a][t.]aka[91]       [Illustration]  [Most of these numerals are given by Bühler, loc. cit., Tafel IX.]  {26} With respect to these numerals it should first be noted that no zero appears in the table, and as a matter of fact none existed in any of the cases cited. It was therefore impossible to have any place value, and the numbers like twenty, thirty, and other multiples of ten, one hundred, and so on, required separate symbols except where they were written out in words. The ancient Hindus had no less than twenty of these symbols,[92] a number that was afterward greatly increased. The following are examples of their method of indicating certain numbers between one hundred and one thousand:    [93] [Numerals] for 174   [94] [Numerals] for 191   [95] [Numerals] for 269   [96] [Numerals] for 252   [97] [Numerals] for 400   [98] [Numerals] for 356  {27}  To these may be added the following numerals below one hundred, similar to those in the table:    [Numerals][99]    for 90   [Numerals][100]   for 70  We have thus far spoken of the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] and Br[=a]hm[=i] numerals, and it remains to mention the third type, the word and letter forms. These are, however, so closely connected with the perfecting of the system by the invention of the zero that they are more appropriately considered in the next chapter, particularly as they have little relation to the problem of the origin of the forms known as the Arabic.  Having now examined types of the early forms it is appropriate to turn our attention to the question of their origin. As to the first three there is no question. The [1 vertical stroke] or [1 horizontal stroke] is simply one stroke, or one stick laid down by the computer. The [2 vertical strokes] or [2 horizontal strokes] represents two strokes or two sticks, and so for the [3 vertical strokes] and [3 horizontal strokes]. From some primitive [2 vertical strokes] came the two of Egypt, of Rome, of early Greece, and of various other civilizations. It appears in the three Egyptian numeral systems in the following forms:    Hieroglyphic [2 vertical strokes]   Hieratic     [Hieratic 2]   Demotic      [Demotic 2]  The last of these is merely a cursive form as in the Arabic [Arabic 2], which becomes our 2 if tipped through a right angle. From some primitive [2 horizontal strokes] came the Chinese {28} symbol, which is practically identical with the symbols found commonly in India from 150 B.C. to 700 A.D. In the cursive form it becomes [2 horizontal strokes joined], and this was frequently used for two in Germany until the 18th century. It finally went into the modern form 2, and the [3 horizontal strokes] in the same way became our 3.  There is, however, considerable ground for interesting speculation with respect to these first three numerals. The earliest Hindu forms were perpendicular. In the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t inscriptions they are vertical. But long before either the A['s]oka or the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t inscriptions the Chinese were using the horizontal forms for the first three numerals, but a vertical arrangement for four.[101] Now where did China get these forms? Surely not from India, for she had them, as her monuments and literature[102] show, long before the Hindus knew them. The tradition is that China brought her civilization around the north of Tibet, from Mongolia, the primitive habitat being Mesopotamia, or possibly the oases of Turkestan. Now what numerals did Mesopotamia use? The Babylonian system, simple in its general principles but very complicated in many of its details, is now well known.[103] In particular, one, two, and three were represented by vertical arrow-heads. Why, then, did the Chinese write {29} theirs horizontally? The problem now takes a new interest when we find that these Babylonian forms were not the primitive ones of this region, but that the early Sumerian forms were horizontal.[104]  What interpretation shall be given to these facts? Shall we say that it was mere accident that one people wrote \"one\" vertically and that another wrote it horizontally? This may be the case; but it may also be the case that the tribal migrations that ended in the Mongol invasion of China started from the Euphrates while yet the Sumerian civilization was prominent, or from some common source in Turkestan, and that they carried to the East the primitive numerals of their ancient home, the first three, these being all that the people as a whole knew or needed. It is equally possible that these three horizontal forms represent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22599"],["title","The Hindu-Arabic Numerals (#4)"],["body","stick-laying, the most natural position of a stick placed in front of a calculator being the horizontal one. When, however, the cuneiform writing developed more fully, the vertical form may have been proved the easier to make, so that by the time the migrations to the West began these were in use, and from them came the upright forms of Egypt, Greece, Rome, and other Mediterranean lands, and those of A['s]oka's time in India. After A['s]oka, and perhaps among the merchants of earlier centuries, the horizontal forms may have come down into India from China, thus giving those of the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t cave and of later inscriptions. This is in the realm of speculation, but it is not improbable that further epigraphical studies may confirm the hypothesis.  {30}  As to the numerals above three there have been very many conjectures. The figure one of the Demotic looks like the one of the Sanskrit, the two (reversed) like that of the Arabic, the four has some resemblance to that in the Nasik caves, the five (reversed) to that on the K[s.]atrapa coins, the nine to that of the Ku[s.]ana inscriptions, and other points of similarity have been imagined. Some have traced resemblance between the Hieratic five and seven and those of the Indian inscriptions. There have not, therefore, been wanting those who asserted an Egyptian origin for these numerals.[105] There has already been mentioned the fact that the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] numerals were formerly known as Bactrian, Indo-Bactrian, and Aryan. Cunningham[106] was the first to suggest that these numerals were derived from the alphabet of the Bactrian civilization of Eastern Persia, perhaps a thousand years before our era, and in this he was supported by the scholarly work of Sir E. Clive Bayley,[107] who in turn was followed by Canon Taylor.[108] The resemblance has not proved convincing, however, and Bayley's drawings {31} have been criticized as being affected by his theory. The following is part of the hypothesis:[109]    _Numeral_      _Hindu_       _Bactrian_       _Sanskrit_      4           [Symbol]      [Symbol] = ch    chatur, Lat. quattuor      5           [Symbol]      [Symbol] = p     pancha, Gk. [Greek:p/ente]      6           [Symbol]      [Symbol] = s     [s.]a[s.]      7           [Symbol]      [Symbol] = [s.]  sapta      ( the s and [s.] are interchanged as occasionally in N. W. India)  Bühler[110] rejects this hypothesis, stating that in four cases (four, six, seven, and ten) the facts are absolutely against it.  While the relation to ancient Bactrian forms has been generally doubted, it is agreed that most of the numerals resemble Br[=a]hm[=i] letters, and we would naturally expect them to be initials.[111] But, knowing the ancient pronunciation of most of the number names,[112] we find this not to be the case. We next fall back upon the hypothesis {32} that they represent the order of letters[113] in the ancient alphabet. From what we know of this order, however, there seems also no basis for this assumption. We have, therefore, to confess that we are not certain that the numerals were alphabetic at all, and if they were alphabetic we have no evidence at present as to the basis of selection. The later forms may possibly have been alphabetical expressions of certain syllables called _ak[s.]aras_, which possessed in Sanskrit fixed numerical values,[114] but this is equally uncertain with the rest. Bayley also thought[115] that some of the forms were Phoenician, as notably the use of a circle for twenty, but the resemblance is in general too remote to be convincing.  There is also some slight possibility that Chinese influence is to be seen in certain of the early forms of Hindu numerals.[116]  {33}  More absurd is the hypothesis of a Greek origin, supposedly supported by derivation of the current symbols from the first nine letters of the Greek alphabet.[117] This difficult feat is accomplished by twisting some of the letters, cutting off, adding on, and effecting other changes to make the letters fit the theory. This peculiar theory was first set up by Dasypodius[118] (Conrad Rauhfuss), and was later elaborated by Huet.[119]  {34}  A bizarre derivation based upon early Arabic (c. 1040 A.D.) sources is given by Kircher in his work[120] on number mysticism. He quotes from Abenragel,[121] giving the Arabic and a Latin translation[122] and stating that the ordinary Arabic forms are derived from sectors of a circle, [circle].  Out of all these conflicting theories, and from all the resemblances seen or imagined between the numerals of the West and those of the East, what conclusions are we prepared to draw as the evidence now stands? Probably none that is satisfactory. Indeed, upon the evidence at {35} hand we might properly feel that everything points to the numerals as being substantially indigenous to India. And why should this not be the case? If the king Srong-tsan-Gampo (639 A.D.), the founder of Lh[=a]sa,[123] could have set about to devise a new alphabet for Tibet, and if the Siamese, and the Singhalese, and the Burmese, and other peoples in the East, could have created alphabets of their own, why should not the numerals also have been fashioned by some temple school, or some king, or some merchant guild? By way of illustration, there are shown in the table on page 36 certain systems of the East, and while a few resemblances are evident, it is also evident that the creators of each system endeavored to find original forms that should not be found in other systems. This, then, would seem to be a fair interpretation of the evidence. A human mind cannot readily create simple forms that are absolutely new; what it fashions will naturally resemble what other minds have fashioned, or what it has known through hearsay or through sight. A circle is one of the world's common stock of figures, and that it should mean twenty in Phoenicia and in India is hardly more surprising than that it signified ten at one time in Babylon.[124] It is therefore quite probable that an extraneous origin cannot be found for the very sufficient reason that none exists.  Of absolute nonsense about the origin of the symbols which we use much has been written. Conjectures, {36} however, without any historical evidence for support, have no place in a serious discussion of the gradual evolution of the present numeral forms.[125]    TABLE OF CERTAIN EASTERN SYSTEMS   Siam            [Illustration: numerals]   Burma[126]      [Illustration: numerals]   Malabar[127]    [Illustration: numerals]   Tibet[128]      [Illustration: numerals]   Ceylon[129]     [Illustration: numerals]   Malayalam[129]  [Illustration: numerals]  {37}  We may summarize this chapter by saying that no one knows what suggested certain of the early numeral forms used in India. The origin of some is evident, but the origin of others will probably never be known. There is no reason why they should not have been invented by some priest or teacher or guild, by the order of some king, or as part of the mysticism of some temple. Whatever the origin, they were no better than scores of other ancient systems and no better than the present Chinese system when written without the zero, and there would never have been any chance of their triumphal progress westward had it not been for this relatively late symbol. There could hardly be demanded a stronger proof of the Hindu origin of the character for zero than this, and to it further reference will be made in Chapter IV.         *       *       *       *       *   {38}  CHAPTER III  LATER HINDU FORMS, WITH A PLACE VALUE  Before speaking of the perfected Hindu numerals with the zero and the place value, it is necessary to consider the third system mentioned on page 19,--the word and letter forms. The use of words with place value began at least as early as the 6th century of the Christian era. In many of the manuals of astronomy and mathematics, and often in other works in mentioning dates, numbers are represented by the names of certain objects or ideas. For example, zero is represented by \"the void\" (_['s][=u]nya_), or \"heaven-space\" (_ambara [=a]k[=a]['s]a_); one by \"stick\" (_rupa_), \"moon\" (_indu ['s]a['s]in_), \"earth\" (_bh[=u]_), \"beginning\" (_[=a]di_), \"Brahma,\" or, in general, by anything markedly unique; two by \"the twins\" (_yama_), \"hands\" (_kara_), \"eyes\" (_nayana_), etc.; four by \"oceans,\" five by \"senses\" (_vi[s.]aya_) or \"arrows\" (the five arrows of K[=a]mad[=e]va); six by \"seasons\" or \"flavors\"; seven by \"mountain\" (_aga_), and so on.[130] These names, accommodating themselves to the verse in which scientific works were written, had the additional advantage of not admitting, as did the figures, easy alteration, since any change would tend to disturb the meter.  {39}  As an example of this system, the date \"['S]aka Sa[m.]vat, 867\" (A.D. 945 or 946), is given by \"_giri-ra[s.]a-vasu_,\" meaning \"the mountains\" (seven), \"the flavors\" (six), and the gods \"_Vasu_\" of which there were eight. In reading the date these are read from right to left.[131] The period of invention of this system is uncertain. The first trace seems to be in the _['S]rautas[=u]tra_ of K[=a]ty[=a]yana and L[=a][t.]y[=a]yana.[132] It was certainly known to Var[=a]ha-Mihira (d. 587),[133] for he used it in the _B[r.]hat-Sa[m.]hit[=a]._[134] It has also been asserted[135] that [=A]ryabha[t.]a (c. 500 A.D.) was familiar with this system, but there is nothing to prove the statement.[136] The earliest epigraphical examples of the system are found in the Bayang (Cambodia) inscriptions of 604 and 624 A.D.[137]  Mention should also be made, in this connection, of a curious system of alphabetic numerals that sprang up in southern India. In this we have the numerals represented by the letters as given in the following table:    1        2       3       4       5        6       7      8     9      0   k        kh      g       gh      [.n]     c       ch     j     jh     ñ   [t.]     [t.]h   [d.]    [d.]h   [n.] "]]]
