If he had not confessed, we could have proved that he helped you,\" added Vallington. \"I have seen the six papers that were all right myself. Pearl performed the third example in a very peculiar and roundabout way; and Poodles had it in the same way, while the other did it by the most direct method.\"  \"I suppose it's of no use to stand out now,\" said Poodles, timidly.  \"Will you confess now?\"  \"I will, if it will do any good.\"  \"If you will tell the truth to Mr. Parasyte, that is all we want. The fellows haven't anything against you. Will you do so?\"  \"I will if you say I shall not be expelled,\" whined Poodles.  \"I can only say that we will not ask for your expulsion. I suppose there is no danger of Mr. Parasyte expelling _you_,\" added the judge, with a dry humor, appreciated by all the students.  \"Mr. Parasyte!\" exclaimed one of the sentinels at the door.  There was an attempt on the part of the principal to pull the door open, but it was well secured upon the inside.  \"Let him in,\" said the judge.  The door opened, and Mr. Parasyte entered the school-room.     CHAPTER VIII.  IN WHICH ERNEST VANQUISHES THE SCHOOLMASTER.   Mr. Parasyte had evidently obtained some information in regard to the great rebellion before he entered the school-room; for though he looked extremely troubled, he did not seem to be so much astonished as might have been expected. He was admitted by order of the judge, and took off his hat as he walked up the aisle to the platform, wiping away the perspiration which gathered on his heated brow under the severe mental struggles his position induced.  \"What does all this mean?\" he demanded, with a sternness which we could not help seeing was assumed.  The boys were all orderly and quiet; the school room was as still as during the regular sessions of the Institute. The sentinels, with their bats and clubs, stood immovable at their stations, and the scene produced its full impression upon the mind of the principal. As he did not seem to be prepared to receive an answer to his question, none was given; and Mr. Parasyte glanced uneasily around the room, apparently seeking to obtain a better understanding of the scene.  \"What does all this _mean_?\" demanded he, a second time.  \"It means, sir,\" replied Henry Vallington, \"that the boys are dissatisfied, and intend to have things set right.\"  \"Is this a proper way to express their dissatisfaction--to take advantage of my absence to get up a riotous assembly?\"  \"We have been perfectly orderly, sir,\" added the judge, in respectful tones.  \"How came you here, Thornton?\" continued the principal, as his gaze rested on me.  \"We brought him here, sir,\" promptly interposed Vallington, anxious to relieve me of any responsibility for my escape from my prison-chamber.  \"Vallington, I confess my astonishment at seeing you engaged in an affair of this kind,\" said Mr. Parasyte, reproachfully; and he fixed his gaze upon the judge, and again wiped the perspiration from his forehead. \"I have always regarded you as an orderly and well-behaved boy.\"  \"I do not expect to forfeit my reputation as such by what I have done. Mr. Parasyte, the boys are dissatisfied. We are not little children. We have all reached the years of discretion, and we know the difference between right and wrong, between justice and injustice.\"  \"Do you intend to read me a lecture?\" demanded the principal, angrily.  \"No, sir; I had no such intention--only to state the facts.\"  \"But you are arraigning me, the principal of the Parkville Liberal Institute,\" added Mr. Parasyte, measuring the judge from head to foot.  \"You may call it what you please, sir.\"  \"May I ask what you purpose to do?\" continued the principal, in a sneering tone, not unmingled with timidity.  \"Poodles,\" said the judge, turning to the lank toady, \"stand up.\"  He obeyed; and being now with the majority of the boys, I think he was mean enough to enjoy the discomfiture of Mr. Parasyte, for there can be no real respect or true sympathy in the relation of one flunky with another.  \"Are you ready to tell the whole truth?\" demanded Vallington.  \"I am,\" replied Poodles.  \"Perhaps you will be willing to inform Mr. Parasyte, in the beginning, whether you do so of your own free will and accord, or not.\"  \"I do so of my own free will and accord.\"  \"Did you perform the examples on the examination paper without any assistance?\"  \"I did not.\"  \"How many did you do yourself?\"  \"None of them.\"  \"Who struck the first blow in the affray on the pier with Thornton?\"  \"I did,\" answered Poodles, with a silly leer. \"Thornton told the facts just exactly as they were.\"  \"You may sit down.\"  Mr. Parasyte wiped his brow again.  \"Pearl,\" continued Vallington.  This culprit, unlike his companion in guilt, looked sheepish and crestfallen, as he slowly rose from his seat. He was not so base and low-minded as Poodles, and he felt a genuine shame for the mean conduct of which he had been guilty.  \"Have you anything to say, Pearl?\" asked the judge.  \"I lent my paper to Poodles, who copied the solutions from it,\" replied Pearl, with his glance fixed upon the floor.  \"That's all; you may sit down.\"  Pearl seated himself; and if a pin had fallen to the floor then, it might have been heard in the anxious silence that followed. Mr. Parasyte's chest heaved with emotion. He wanted to storm, and scold, and threaten, but seemed to be afraid to do so.  \"I have nothing more to say at present, Mr. Parasyte. In the name and in behalf of the students, I have brought the facts to your notice,\" said Vallington, breaking the impressive stillness, as the principal did not seem disposed to do so.  \"After the riotous proceedings of this afternoon, I might have expected this; but I did not,\" the principal began. \"You appear to have intimidated Poodles to such an extent that he has entirely modified and reversed the statements he made this afternoon. He is a weak-minded boy, and it was not difficult to do so.\"  This remark roused the ire of Poodles, and it required a sharp reprimand from the judge to repress his impertinence.  \"Pearl is a poor boy, upon whose fears you seem to have successfully wrought. A confession from either of them, under the circumstances, is not reliable. I do not countenance this meeting, or these proceedings. I am not to be intimidated by your action. In regard to what you have done, I have nothing to say; but I require you to separate, and go at once to your rooms.\"  \"Will you be kind enough to inform us what you intend to do, Mr. Parasyte?\" said Vallington.  \"I am not to be taken to task by my pupils.\"  \"We do not intend to resort to any disorderly proceedings,\" added the judge. \"Poodles and Pearl, without compulsion, have acknowledged their errors, and it has been fully proved that Thornton was not to blame for the affair on the pier. We ask, therefore, that Thornton be restored to his rank and privileges as a member of the Institute. If this is not done, at least fifty of us will sign a paper urging our parents and guardians to take us away from this school.\"  \"I will grant nothing under these circumstances--promise nothing,\" replied the principal, doggedly.  \"We are in no haste. We leave the matter for your consideration, Mr. Parasyte. We will all go to our rooms now.\"  Vallington left the chair, and walked out of the school-room, followed in good order by all the students who had taken part in these irregular proceedings. I was going out with the rest, when Mr. Parasyte intimated that he had something to say to me, and I remained. When the boys had all gone, he invited me to accompany him to his private office--a small apartment, opening from the main hall, near the front door, in which he received callers, and sat in state when not employed in the school-room.  There is an old saying that \"you must summer and winter\" a man before you know him. Mr. Parasyte was considered a tyrant; not a coarse and brutal tyrant, but a refined and gentlemanly one, who cows you by his polite impertinence. He seldom indulged in harsh speech, never in personal violence--at least no instance of it was known to the students. He indulged in sneers and polished browbeating. A boy was never stupid--he lacked common intelligence; never a blockhead--his perceptions were very dull. His polite epithets were more cutting than good round invectives would have been.  He had a will of his own; and he was obstinate, mulish, pig-headed. If he had been surprised into declaring that black was white, then black would continue to be white, in spite of positive demonstration to the contrary. He was dogmatic to the last degree; and this is a fault to which the schoolmaster is peculiarly liable. It required the event of the day whereof I speak to enable us fully to comprehend Mr. Parasyte. We had summered him before; now we were to winter him.  What he had said in the school-room indicated that he intended to regard the confessions of Poodles and Pearl as extorted from them by intimidation, and that he purposed to persist in persecuting me. I had no desire to be a martyr; but I did not see how I could help myself.  \"Thornton, I see you intend, if possible, to break up the Parkville Liberal Institute,\" said he.  \"No, sir, I do not. I hadn't anything to do with what took place in the school-room,\" I replied.  \"You did not seem to be a martyr there,\" sneered he. \"The boys have made a mistake; so have you. They don't know me; you don't. You got up a quarrel this afternoon.\"  \"No, sir, I did not.\"  \"Don't contradict me,\" said he, sharply. \"I say you got up a quarrel this afternoon.\"  \"And I say I did not.\"  \"I am"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22464"],["title","The Last of the Chiefs: A Story of the Great Sioux War (#0)"],["body","LAST OF THE CHIEFS A Story of the Great Sioux War  by Joseph A.

The days and days of walking over the rolling prairie, under a brassy sun, the hard food of the train, and the short hours of rest, had put too severe a trial upon his delicate frame. Now, as he lay against the sacks and boxes that had been drawn up to form a sort of couch for him, his breath came in short gasps, and his face was very pale. His brother, older, and stronger by far, who walked at the wheel, regarded him with a look in which affection and intense anxiety were mingled. It was not a time and place in which one could afford to be ill.  Richard and Albert Howard were bound together by the strongest of brotherly ties. Richard had inherited his father's bigness and powerful constitution, Albert his mother's slenderness and fragility. But it was the mother who lived the longer, although even she did not attain middle age, and her last words to her older son were: \"Richard, take care of Albert.\" He had promised, and now was thinking how he could keep the promise.  It was a terrible problem that confronted Richard Howard.  He felt no fear on his own account. A boy in years, he was a man in the ability to care for himself, wherever he might be. In a boyhood spent on an Illinois farm, where the prairies slope up to the forest, he had learned the ways of wood and field, and was full of courage, strength, and resource.  But Albert was different. He had not thrived in the moist air of the great valley. Tall enough he was, but the width of chest and thickness of bone were lacking.  Noticing this, the idea of going to California had come to the older brother. The great gold days had passed years since, but it was still a land of enchantment to the youth of the older states, and the long journey in the high, dry air of the plains would be good for Albert.  There was nothing to keep them back. They had no property save a little money--enough for their equipment, and a few dollars over to live on in California until they could get work.  To decide was to start, and here they were in the middle of the vast country that rolled away west of the Missouri, known but little, and full of dangers. The journey had been much harder than the older boy had expected. The days stretched out, the weeks trailed away, and still the plains rolled before them.  The summer had been of the hottest, and the heated earth gave back the glare until the air quivered in torrid waves. Richard had drawn back the cover of the wagon that his brother might breathe the air, but he replaced it now to protect him from the overpowering beams.  Once more he anxiously studied the country, but it gave him little hope.  The green of the grass was gone, and most of the grass with it.  The brown undulations swept away from horizon to horizon, treeless, waterless, and bare.  In all that vast desolation there was nothing save the tired and dusty train at the very center of it.  \"Anything in sight, Dick?\" asked Albert, who had followed his brother's questioning look.  Dick shook his head.  \"Nothing, Al,\" he replied.  \"I wish we'd come to a grove,\" said the sick boy.  He longed, as do all those who are born in the hills, for the sight of trees and clear, running water.  \"I was thinking, Dick,\" he resumed in short, gasping tones, \"that it would be well for us, just as the evening was coming on, to go over a swell and ride right into a forest of big oaks and maples, with the finest little creek that you ever saw running through the middle of it.  It would be pleasant and shady there.  Leaves would be lying about, the water would be cold, and maybe we'd see elk coming down to drink.\"  \"Perhaps we'll have such luck, Al,\" said Dick, although his tone showed no such hope.  But he added, assuming a cheerful manner: \"This can't go on forever; we'll be reaching the mountains soon, and then you'll get well.\"  \"How's that brother of yours?  No better, I see, and he's got to ride all the time now, making more load for the animals.\"  It was Sam Conway, the leader of the train, who spoke, a rough man of middle age, for whom both Dick and Albert had acquired a deep dislike.  Dick flushed through his tan at the hard words.  \"If he's sick he had the right to ride,\" he replied sharply. \"We've paid our share for this trip and maybe a little more. You know that.\"  Conway gave him an ugly look, but Dick stood up straight and strong, and met him eye for eye.  He was aware of their rights and he meant to defend them.  Conway, confronted by a dauntless spirit, turned away, muttering in a surly fashion:  \"We didn't bargain to take corpses across the plains.\"  Fortunately, the boy in the wagon did not hear him, and, though his eyes flashed ominously, Dick said nothing.  It was not a time for quarreling, but it was often hard to restrain one's temper. He had realized, soon after the start, when it was too late to withdraw, that the train was not a good one.  It was made up mostly of men.  There were no children, and the few women, like the men, were coarse and rough.  Turbulent scenes had occurred, but Dick and Albert kept aloof, steadily minding their own business.  \"What did Conway say?\" asked Albert, after the man had gone.  \"Nothing of any importance.  He was merely growling as usual.  He likes to make himself disagreeable.  I never saw another man who got as much enjoyment out of that sort of thing.\"  Albert said nothing more, but closed his eyes.  The canvas cover protected him from the glare of the sun, but seemed to hold the heat within it.  Drops of perspiration stood on his face, and Dick longed for the mountains, for his brother's sake.  All the train fell into a sullen silence, and no sound was heard but the unsteady rumble of the wheels, the creak of an ungreased axle, and the occasional crack of a whip.  Clouds of dust arose and were whipped by the stray winds into the faces of the travelers, the fine particles burning like hot ashes.  The train moved slowly and heavily, as if it dragged a wounded length over the hard ground.  Dick Howard kept his position by the side of the wagon in which his brother lay.  He did not intend that Albert should hear bitter words leveled at his weakness, and he knew that his own presence was a deterrent.  The strong figures and dauntless port of the older youth inspired respect.  Moreover, he carried over his shoulder a repeating rifle of the latest pattern, and his belt was full of cartridges.  He and Albert had been particular about their arms.  It was a necessity.  The plains and the mountains were subject to all the dangers of Indian warfare, and they had taken a natural youthful pride in buying the finest of weapons.  The hot dust burned Dick Howard's face and crept into his eyes and throat.  His tongue lay dry in his mouth.  He might have ridden in one of the wagons, too, had he chosen.  As he truly said, he and Albert had paid their full share, and in the labor of the trail, he was more efficient than anybody else in the train.  But his pride had been touched by Conway's words.  He would not ride, nor would he show any signs of weakness.  He strode on by the side of the wagon, head erect, his step firm and springy.  The sun crept slowly down the brassy arch of the heavens, and the glare grew less blinding.  The heat abated, but Albert Howard, who had fallen asleep, slept on.  His brother drew a blanket over him, knowing that he could not afford to catch cold, and breathed the cooler air himself, with thankfulness.  Conway came back again, and was scarcely less gruff than before, although he said nothing about Albert.  \"Bright Sun says than in another day or two we'll be seeing the mountains,\" he vouchsafed; \"and I'll be glad of it, because then we'll be coming to water and game.\"  \"I'd like to be seeing them now,\" responded Dick; \"but do you believe everything that Bright Sun says?\"  \"Of course I do.  Hasn't he brought us along all right?  What are you driving at?\"  His voice rose to a challenging tone, in full accordance with the nature of the man, whenever anyone disagreed with him, but Dick Howard took not the least fear.  \"I don't altogether like Bright Sun,\" he replied.  \"Just why, I can't say, but the fact remains that I don't like him.  It doesn't seem natural for an Indian to be so fond of white people, and to prefer another race to his own.\"  Conway laughed harshly.  \"That shows how much you know,\" he said.  \"Bright Sun is smart, smarter than a steel trap.  He knows that the day of the red is passing, and he's going to train with the white.  What's the use of being on the losing side?  It's what I say, and it's what Bright Sun thinks.\"  The man's manner was gross and materialistic, so repellent that Dick would have turned away, but at that moment Bright Sun himself approached.  Dick regarded him, as always, with the keenest interest and curiosity mixed with some suspicion.  Yet almost anyone would have been reassured by the appearance of Bright Sun.  He was a splendid specimen of the Indian, although in white garb, even to the soft felt hat shading his face.  But he could never have been taken for a white man.  His hair was thick, black, and coarse, his skin of the red man's typical coppery tint, and his cheek bones high and sharp.  His lean but sinewy and powerful figure rose two inches above six feet.  There was an air about him, too, that told of strength other than that of the body.  Guide he was, but leader he looked.  \"Say,"]]]
