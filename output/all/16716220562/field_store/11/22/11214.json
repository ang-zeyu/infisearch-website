A good job isn't open more than an hour in this city.\"  \"Then, I'd better hurry along.\"  Nat had written down about a dozen addresses on a slip of paper, and the newsboy showed him how he could get around from one place to the next with the least walking. Nat started off at a swift gait. Dick watched him out of sight with a thoughtful expression on his face.  \"That boy means well,\" he murmured. \"But he has got a whole lot to learn!\"  The distance to the first place on Nat's list was almost half a mile. It was a shirt factory, where an assistant packer was desired, at eight dollars per week. Arriving there, Nat found about twenty young men and boys assembled, waiting to get into the office.  \"Dick was right, a place here doesn't go begging long,\" thought the boy from the country.  It was some time before Nat could get into the office. He faced a tall, sharp-eyed man, who was in his shirt sleeves.  \"Want the job, eh?\" said the man. \"Had any experience as a packer?\"  \"No, sir, but----\"  \"Can't use you. Next!\"  Nat stared at the man in bewilderment.  \"Won't you please try----\"  \"No.\" The man shook his head vigorously. \"Next!\" And our hero was elbowed toward the door by some others who wanted the position. In a moment more he found himself on the street again.  \"Well, of all the mean men!\" he began, and stopped short. \"All right, he can keep his job. I'll try the next place.\"  The next was in a hat store, and the place was filled. Then came a clothing establishment, a hardware store, and a wholesale rubber factory. At none of these places was he wanted. By this time it was nearly noon, and he was getting just a little discouraged.  \"It's going to be up-hill work, that's certain!\" he told himself with a sigh.  The next place he visited was a seed store. Here a very elderly man came forward to greet him.  \"So you want a place?\" said he slowly. \"Have you had any experience as an errand boy?\"  \"No, sir, but I am willing to learn.\"  \"So they all say, but many boys don't seem to learn very fast. You look like a country lad.\" And the elderly man peered at Nat closely through his spectacles.  \"I am a country boy. But if you'll give me a chance, I'll do my best.\"  \"We can't pay you very much at the start.\"  \"How much?\"  \"Two dollars and a half a week.\"  \"I can't live on that. I've got to pay my board.\"  The elderly man shrugged his shoulders.  \"Guess you had better look elsewhere then.\"  \"Couldn't you pay me a little more? I am willing to work hard.\"  \"Well, we might give you three dollars a week after the first month, but that is our limit for an errand boy.\"  \"I can't take it,\" answered Nat. \"I've got to earn more,\" and after a little additional talking he left the seed store.  He had a lunch in a bit of newspaper, and as it was nearly one o'clock, he sat down on a box on the sidewalk and ate it, washing it down with a drink of water from a cooler in a railroad ticket office. Then he went on his way once more, but at sundown had to give it up. He was so tired, and his feet were so sore from the pavements, that he could scarcely walk to his boarding house.  \"I trust you found something,\" said Mrs. Talcott, as he entered.  \"No,\" he answered, soberly. \"I could have had one position, but it only paid two dollars and a half a week, so I didn't take it.\"  \"I am sorry.\"  \"I shall go out to-morrow again. I am bound to strike something sooner or later.\"  Being tremendously hungry Nat ate the supper provided with a relish. There were two other boarders--girls who worked in a large department store--and they were quite interested in him.  \"You might get work at our place,\" said one of the girls. \"They advertised to-day for wrappers.\"  \"Yes, but they want experienced wrappers,\" said the other girl.  \"I'll try them, anyway,\" said Nat. \"And I am much obliged to you for telling me about it,\" he added.  On the following morning he was up as before and got the list from the papers again. Fortune was now with him, and at noon he found a position in a wholesale paper house. One of the clerks was going to visit some relatives down south, and Nat was hired to fill his place, at seven dollars per week.  \"You've struck luck!\" cried Dick Talcott, on hearing the news. \"I hope the job lasts.\"  \"So do I,\" answered Nat. \"But even if it doesn't, it is better than nothing.\"  Nat went to work the next day. He found his duties rather simple and wondered how the firm could afford to pay him seven dollars for the little he was called on to do. Everybody treated him nicely, and he considered himself lucky to have made the connection with the firm.     CHAPTER X  OUT OF WORK ONCE MORE   During the time that he worked in the wholesale paper establishment Nat wrote a long letter to Sam Price, telling his friend of his adventures since leaving home, and asking for news from the farm. A few days later an answer came back, which ran as follows:       \"I got your letter and found it very interesting. I hope you make      your fortune in the city. It's certainly a fine place to go to, and      maybe I'll try it myself some day. Country life is awful slow, and      work is mighty hard. I have been hoeing corn to-day till my back      aches ready to fall apart.       \"Your uncle was awful mad to think you had run away, and madder      still when he found you had sold the cow. He thought you were      hiding in Cleveland, and he stayed in that city three days before      he gave up the search. He claims that the cow belonged to him--that      he took it for board and clothing for you, and he also sticks to it      that you tried to burn down his barn. He says he is going to make      it hot for you if he ever finds you. You can make sure I shan't      tell him where you are.\"  Nat read the letter with keen interest, not once but several times, and shook his head slowly over the communication.  \"I suppose Uncle Abner will always think I set fire to the barn,\" he thought. \"Wish I could catch the person who really did do it. Must have been some tramp who was sleeping there and using a pipe.\"  At the end of the third week's work Nat had seven dollars saved, of which amount he was reasonably proud. But now came a setback for which he was not prepared.  \"We have sold this concern to another party,\" said one of the proprietors to him. \"After Saturday your services will be no longer required.\"  \"Won't the new bosses need me?\"  \"No, for they have all the help of their own that they can use. Only our head bookkeeper will remain.\"  This was on Thursday, and during the balance of the week our hero looked around in his spare hours for another position, but without success. Monday morning found him doing nothing.  \"As you said, it is not so easy to get a hold,\" said he to Dick. \"Still, I don't feel quite so green as when I first reached New York. I at least know something about the streets and the stores.\"  Nat lost no time in looking for another place. But nothing turned up Monday or Tuesday, and Wednesday it rained so hard that he did not go out until after noon. Then he visited a fashionable wholesale jewelry establishment. Here he was asked to wait, while one of the proprietors interviewed a young man who had come in ahead of our hero.  The young man was dressed as a perfect dude, with a light checked suit, and very light gloves. He spoke with a drawl, and Nat heard every word that he said.  \"What is your business, sir?\" asked the jeweler.  \"I believe, sir,\" said the young gentleman, \"that you advertised for a--aw--a secretary.\"  \"A clerk, yes, sir.\"  \"Aw, all the same. Well, sir--aw--if we can agree upon terms, I should be--aw--flattered to proffer my services.\"  \"Ah, indeed!\" And the jeweler raised his eyebrows slightly.  \"Yes, sir. You will be pleased to learn that all my connections--aw--move in the first circles.\"  \"Undoubtedly that is very gratifying. But you mentioned terms. May I ask you what you expect?\"  \"Well, sir, perhaps a couple of thousand or so, a year. Then, I should wish to make certain stipulations--aw--as to the time I'm employed.\"  \"Go on.\"  \"For example, I never--aw--get up very early. I think it injures the health. But I think I could manage to get to the office by ten in the morning.\"  \"I see.\"  \"Then, I should want--aw--to have Saturday afternoons to myself, both in winter and summer. I always go to the theater matin√©es--so many--aw--pretty girls there,\" continued the dude.  \"And what else?\"  \"I should not want to work later than five in the afternoon. Excessive labor is injurious to the health.\"  \"Perhaps that is true.\"  \"Then I should--aw--wish it understood that I could have five or six weeks off in the summer, so that I can visit the springs or the seashore,\" continued the dude. \"Is that satisfactory?\"  \"I suppose it would be, to you,\" answered the jeweler.  \"I think so.\"  \"It wouldn't satisfy us at all.\"  \"Really! That is too bad!\"  \"We want a man here who can work, and who is not afraid of long hours, and who doesn't set quite such a high figure on his services. You'll never fill the bill in the wide world. Good-day!\"  \"Really!\" murmured the dude, and after staring at the jeweler, he turned on his heel and left in utter disgust. Several who had overheard the interview laughed out-right.  \"What a perfect fool!\" thought Nat. \"I wonder if anybody will ever give him anything to do?\"  \"What can I do for you, young man?\" asked the jeweler, turning to the boy.  \"I am looking for work, sir.\"  \"Are your expectations as high as those of the chap who just left?\"  \"No, sir. I am willing to work hard and I am not afraid of long hours.\"  \"Then you are not a dude?\"  \"No, sir. Do I look like one?\"  \"You look like a country lad.\"  \"I came from the country about a month ago. I've been working for Trumbull & Davison, the paper"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22565"],["title","From Farm to Fortune; or, Nat Nason's Strange Experience (#8)"],["body","ers. But they have sold out to another firm and don't need me any longer.\"  \"I see. Well, I am sorry for you, for you look bright and honest. But I need somebody with experience in the jewelry line.\"  \"Then you haven't any place that I can fill?\"  \"No, I--but hold on. I'll tell you what I might do. Do you know anything about horses?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And about a garden?\"  \"Yes, sir. I was brought up on a farm.\"  \"I need a man around my country home in New Jersey. I might try you there, at twelve dollars a month and your board.\"  Again Nat's face fell.  \"Thank you, but I want to get something to do in the city,\" said he. \"I am tired of farm life.\"  \"Then I can't give you anything,\" and the jeweler turned away.  During the remainder of the day Nat visited several other stores and offices. But everywhere he received the same answer--that he was too late and the position advertised was already filled.  \"Perhaps I did wrong not to take that position over in New Jersey,\" he thought, on his way to his boarding house. \"But I don't want to go back to farm work if I can help it.\"  Two additional days passed, and still Nat found nothing to do, although he tramped from Forty-second Street clear down to the Battery several times. Then he obtained a job which lasted three days and paid him but two dollars.  \"This isn't earning a living,\" he reasoned. \"Unless I do better I'll have to try selling papers or blacking boots.\"  One morning he did try selling papers, under the tutorship of Dick, but the effort was not a success. By noon he had earned exactly nineteen cents and had sixteen papers still on hand.  \"I guess you wasn't cut out for a newsboy,\" said Dick, frankly. \"What you want to do is, to get a steady job in a store or office.\"  \"Yes, but the jobs are mighty scarce,\" answered Nat.  A week passed, and the country boy could find nothing more to do that was steady. One day he helped a man distribute bills, and on another occasion he carried out packages for a florist, and the two jobs brought him in just a dollar. By this time the soles were worn from his shoes and he had to have them mended.  \"Making one's way in the city isn't so easy after all,\" he thought one night, as he sat in his little room, on the edge of the bed. He had been counting up his money and found that he had but a little over four dollars left.  \"I'll have to give Mrs. Talcott three and a half of that,\" he continued, \"and that will leave me sixty-five cents. I've got to hustle or I'll be high and dry by next week.\"  Nat hustled all of the next week, but without results. In one store the proprietor was unusually harsh to him, and he came back to Mrs. Talcott's house more downcast than ever.  \"I guess they don't want me in New York after all,\" he mused. \"If I can't get something to do I can't stay here, for Mrs. Talcott can't afford to keep me. I'll have to starve!\"  He was so disheartened that he did not feel like eating. Immediately after the meal he went to his little room. Then, of a sudden he thought of the letter Paul Hampton had given him.  \"I may as well open that,\" he reasoned. \"Goodness knows I am short enough of funds, and pretty well discouraged too.\"  The letter was in his pocket, still pinned fast, and he brought it forth and gazed at it speculatively.  \"It would be just like him to put a five-dollar bill in it,\" he thought.  With his penknife he slit the envelope open, and looked inside. It contained a slip of paper and another slip, of a green color.  \"A bill, as sure as I'm in this room!\" he ejaculated. \"I don't suppose it's less than a five, and maybe it's a ten. If he--well I declare!\"  Nat rushed to the window to look at the bill, and then with a gasp he sank back on the only chair which the little bedroom contained. He could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses.  The bank bill was one for a hundred dollars.     CHAPTER XI  WHAT A HUNDRED DOLLARS DID   Nat continued to gaze at the bill like one in a dream. He had never seen a greenback that was worth a hundred dollars before, but he had no doubt of its genuineness.  \"A hundred dollars!\" he repeated several times. \"Why, it's a small fortune!\"  Then he began to wonder if Paul Hampton had not made a mistake, and turned to the slip of paper, upon which he found written:       \"I give you this hundred dollars for what you did for me at Niagara      Falls. Don't be discouraged. If you ever need a friend, write or      come and see me. I sincerely hope the money will bring you good      fortune.\"  \"What a kind man,\" murmured Nat, and read the note again. \"It was a mighty lucky thing for me that I went to the Falls.\"  When he went to bed he felt rich, and he came to the breakfast table whistling merrily.  \"Hullo,\" cried Dick, \"have you struck luck at last?\"  \"I'm in luck in one way,\" answered our hero. \"Look at that,\" and he showed the bank bill.  \"Why, it's a hundred dollars, Nat!\" And the newsboy's eyes opened widely.  \"Exactly.\"  \"Where on earth did you get the money?\"  \"A gentleman gave it to me.\"  \"What for?\"  \"For saving his life. But I didn't know I had it until I went to bed last night.\"  \"You're talking in riddles.\"  \"I'll explain,\" and then our hero told as much of the Niagara Falls episode as he deemed necessary.  \"Here is the note,\" he concluded, showing the slip of paper, which was unsigned. \"I don't feel at liberty to mention the gentleman's name. I don't think it would be just right.\"  \"A rich man like that would be a fool to commit suicide,\" said Dick, bluntly. \"What are you going to do with all that money?\"  \"I don't know. But I shan't squander it, I can tell you that.\"  \"You can go into business for yourself on that amount.\"  \"Maybe, but I guess I had better keep on hunting for a job. I can go into business for myself when I know more about New York.\"  \"That's where you are sensible. You might lose your money in double-quick time in your own business.\"  Nat put the bill away very carefully, and then went out to look for a position as before. But the week passed and nothing turned up.  On Sunday the country boy attended a church in the vicinity of his boarding house, and in the afternoon he took a walk to Central Park. In the evening he stayed at home and read a paper which Dick brought in.  As was natural Nat read over the want advertisements very carefully. It was not long before he came to one which excited his curiosity. The advertisement was as follows:       \"WANTED--A clerk, to whom a liberal salary will be paid. One      preferred who comes from the country and is not too old. References      expected. Must deposit $100 as security, for which interest will be      paid. Inquire Room 24, Dallax Building, Broadway.\"  \"That ought to strike me,\" mused Nat, as he laid down the paper. \"Just the thing, and no mistake. I'll go and see about it.\"  Our hero had acquired sufficient knowledge of New York to find the place indicated in the advertisement without much trouble. It was a four-story stone building, and he walked up two flights of stairs until he reached Room 24. On the door was the sign:           HAMILTON DART     BROKERAGE AND COMMISSIONS  Entering the office he found it plainly but neatly furnished with two desks and several chairs. In front of one of the desks sat a middle-aged man, well dressed, and smoking a cigar.  \"Is this Mr. Dart?\" questioned Nat, taking off his hat.  \"That is my name,\" responded Hamilton Dart, with a keen glance at our hero.  \"Did you advertise for a clerk. I saw an advertisement----\"  \"Oh, yes!\" interrupted the man. \"Pray be seated,\" and he motioned to one of the chairs. \"You came to see about the place, did you?\"  \"Yes, sir. You advertised that you would like somebody from the country, and that hits me.\"  \"You came from the country to try your luck?\"  \"Yes, sir. I got tired of the farm.\"  Hamilton Dart smiled good-naturedly, and blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling of his office.  \"I don't blame you. I got tired of the farm myself when I was about your age, and came here with less than a hundred dollars in my pocket.\"  \"Well, I came with just a little more than that,\" answered Nat, innocently.  \"Indeed! Then you are better off than I was. But I shan't complain, for I have made money right along. But what do you think I am worth now?\"  \"I don't know, I am sure--five or ten thousand dollars maybe.\"  \"Nearly fifty thousand dollars,\" and Hamilton Dart looked at Nat, coolly and innocently.  \"Fifty thousand!\" cried the boy. \"You've certainly been lucky. I wish I could make that much.\"  \"You have the same opportunities that I had. Let me see, what did you say your name was?\"  \"I didn't say. It is Nat Nason.\"  \"I am glad to know you. You have a bright and honest face, and faces count a good deal with me.\"  This was gratifying to Nat, and he could not help but think that Mr. Dart was a pleasant gentleman with whom to deal.  \"I advertised for a country young man because I was that myself once, and I like to help country young men along,\" continued Hamilton Dart. \"You are out of work at present?\"  \"Yes, sir. I worked for a firm, but they sold out to another firm.\"  \"I see. Have you any recommendations? Not that they are strictly necessary from one who looks so honest.\"  \"I can refer you to the firm I worked for.\"  \"That will be satisfactory, although I don't mind telling you that I am very particular in the selection of my clerks. So far I have rejected seventeen who applied.\"  \"I should try my best to do what was right,\" answered Nat, modestly.  \"That is the way I like to hear a person talk.\"  \"Then you will take me?\"  \"We haven't agreed on terms yet. What do you expect in the way of salary?\"  \"I guess I'll leave that to you,\" answered Nat, after some hesitation.  \"What did you get at your last place?\"  \"Seven dollars a week.\"  \"Humph! Your employer was not very liberal. A clerk that is worth anything to me is worth ten dollars a week at least.\"  The mentioning of ten dollars made Nat's heart jump.  \"If you'll pay me ten dollars a week,"]]]
