It would be dreadful to eat these dear little things.\"  \"I should say so!\" grunted another of the piglets, looking uneasily at the kitten; \"cats are cruel things.\"  \"I'm not cruel,\" replied the kitten, yawning. \"I'm just hungry.\"  \"You cannot eat my piglets, even if you are starving,\" declared the little man, in a stern voice. \"They are the only things I have to prove I'm a wizard.\"  \"How did they happen to be so little?\" asked Dorothy. \"I never saw such small pigs before.\"  \"They are from the Island of Teenty-Weent,\" said the Wizard, \"where everything is small because it's a small island. A sailor brought them to Los Angeles and I gave him nine tickets to the circus for them.\"  \"But what am I going to eat?\" wailed the kitten, sitting in front of Dorothy and looking pleadingly into her face. \"There are no cows here to give milk; or any mice, or even grasshoppers. And if I can't eat the piglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup.\"  \"I have an idea,\" said the Wizard, \"that there are fishes in these brooks. Do you like fish?\"  \"Fish!\" cried the kitten. \"Do I like fish? Why, they're better than piglets--or even milk!\"  \"Then I'll try to catch you some,\" said he.  \"But won't they be veg'table, like everything else here?\" asked the kitten.  \"I think not. Fishes are not animals, and they are as cold and moist as the vegetables themselves. There is no reason, that I can see, why they may not exist in the waters of this strange country.\"  Then the Wizard bent a pin for a hook and took a long piece of string from his pocket for a fish-line. The only bait he could find was a bright red blossom from a flower; but he knew fishes are easy to fool if anything bright attracts their attention, so he decided to try the blossom. Having thrown the end of his line in the water of a nearby brook he soon felt a sharp tug that told him a fish had bitten and was caught on the bent pin; so the little man drew in the string and, sure enough, the fish came with it and was landed safely on the shore, where it began to flop around in great excitement.  [Illustration: IN THE GARDEN OF THE MANGABOOS.]  The fish was fat and round, and its scales glistened like beautifully cut jewels set close together; but there was no time to examine it closely, for Eureka made a jump and caught it between her claws, and in a few moments it had entirely disappeared.  \"Oh, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy, \"did you eat the bones?\"  \"If it had any bones, I ate them,\" replied the kitten, composedly, as it washed its face after the meal. \"But I don't think that fish had any bones, because I didn't feel them scratch my throat.\"  \"You were very greedy,\" said the girl.  \"I was very hungry,\" replied the kitten.  The little pigs had stood huddled in a group, watching this scene with frightened eyes.  \"Cats are dreadful creatures!\" said one of them.  \"I'm glad we are not fishes!\" said another.  \"Don't worry,\" Dorothy murmured, soothingly, \"I'll not let the kitten hurt you.\"  Then she happened to remember that in a corner of her suit-case were one or two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train, and she went to the buggy and brought them. Eureka stuck up her nose at such food, but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of the crackers and ate them up in a jiffy.  \"Now let us go back to the city,\" suggested the Wizard. \"That is, if Jim has had enough of the pink grass.\"  The cab-horse, who was browsing near, lifted his head with a sigh.  \"I've tried to eat a lot while I had the chance,\" said he, \"for it's likely to be a long while between meals in this strange country. But I'm ready to go, now, at any time you wish.\"  So, after the Wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket, where they cuddled up and went to sleep, the three climbed into the buggy and Jim started back to the town.  \"Where shall we stay?\" asked the girl.  \"I think I shall take possession of the House of the Sorcerer,\" replied the Wizard; \"for the Prince said in the presence of his people that he would keep me until they picked another Sorcerer, and the new Princess won't know but that we belong there.\"  They agreed to this plan, and when they reached the great square Jim drew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall.  \"It doesn't look very homelike,\" said Dorothy, gazing around at the bare room. \"But it's a place to stay, anyhow.\"  \"What are those holes up there?\" enquired the boy, pointing to some openings that appeared near the top of the dome.  \"They look like doorways,\" said Dorothy; \"only there are no stairs to get to them.\"  \"You forget that stairs are unnecessary,\" observed the Wizard. \"Let us walk up, and see where the doors lead to.\"  With this he began walking in the air toward the high openings, and Dorothy and Zeb followed him. It was the same sort of climb one experiences when walking up a hill, and they were nearly out of breath when they came to the row of openings, which they perceived to be doorways leading into halls in the upper part of the house. Following these halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them, and some were furnished with glass benches, tables and chairs. But there were no beds at all.  \"I wonder if these people never sleep,\" said the girl.  \"Why, there seems to be no night at all in this country,\" Zeb replied. \"Those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when we came, and if there is no sunset there can be no night.\"  \"Very true,\" agreed the Wizard. \"But it is a long time since I have had any sleep, and I'm tired. So I think I shall lie down upon one of these hard glass benches and take a nap.\"  \"I will, too,\" said Dorothy, and chose a little room at the end of the hall.  Zeb walked down again to unharness Jim, who, when he found himself free, rolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep, with Eureka nestling comfortably beside his big, boney body. Then the boy returned to one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the glass bench was soon deep in slumberland.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 6.  THE MANGABOOS PROVE DANGEROUS   When the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon the Land of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival. The little man, having had a good sleep, felt rested and refreshed, and looking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting up on his bench and yawning. So the Wizard went in to him.  \"Zeb,\" said he, \"my balloon is of no further use in this strange country, so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell. But in the basket-car are some things I would like to keep with me. I wish you would go and fetch my satchel, two lanterns, and a can of kerosene oil that is under the seat. There is nothing else that I care about.\"  So the boy went willingly upon the errand, and by the time he had returned Dorothy was awake. Then the three held a counsel to decide what they should do next, but could think of no way to better their condition.  \"I don't like these veg'table people,\" said the little girl. \"They're cold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness.\"  \"I agree with you. It is because there is no warm blood in them,\" remarked the Wizard.  \"And they have no hearts; so they can't love anyone--not even themselves,\" declared the boy.  \"The Princess is lovely to look at,\" continued Dorothy, thoughtfully; \"but I don't care much for her, after all. If there was any other place to go, I'd like to go there.\"  \"But _is_ there any other place?\" asked the Wizard.  \"I don't know,\" she answered.  Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them, and going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess and a throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer.  So they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said to them:  \"I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we have decided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and must not remain here.\"  \"How can we go away?\" asked Dorothy.  \"Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed,\" was the answer.  \"In what way?\" enquired the Wizard.  \"We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines,\" said the Princess, \"and they will soon crush you and devour your bodies to make themselves grow bigger. The animals you have with you we will drive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit. Then our country will be rid of all its unwelcome visitors.\"  \"But you are in need of a Sorcerer,\" said the Wizard, \"and not one of those growing is yet ripe enough to pick. I am greater than any thorn-covered sorcerer that ever grew in your garden. Why destroy me?\"  \"It is true we need a Sorcerer,\" acknowledged the Princess, \"but I am informed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days, to take the place of Gwig, whom you cut in two before it was time for him to be planted. Let us see your arts, and the sorceries you are able to perform. Then I will decide whether to destroy you with the others or not.\"  At this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick of producing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again. He did it very cleverly, indeed, and the Princess looked at the strange piglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person could be. But afterward she said:  \"I have heard of this wonderful magic. But it accomplishes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22566"],["title","Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#7)"],["body","of value. What else can you do?\"  The Wizard tried to think. Then he jointed together the blades of his sword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose. But even that did not satisfy the Princess.  Just then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oil which Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, and he got a clever idea from those commonplace things.  \"Your Highness,\" said he, \"I will now proceed to prove my magic by creating two suns that you have never seen before; also I will exhibit a Destroyer much more dreadful than your Clinging Vines.\"  So he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other and set a lantern upon each of their heads.  \"Don't laugh,\" he whispered to them, \"or you will spoil the effect of my magic.\"  [Illustration: \"NOW, PRINCESS,\" EXCLAIMED THE WIZARD.]  Then, with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkled face, the Wizard got out his match-box and lighted the two lanterns. The glare they made was very small when compared with the radiance of the six great colored suns; but still they gleamed steadily and clearly. The Mangaboos were much impressed because they had never before seen any light that did not come directly from their suns.  Next the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor, where it covered quite a broad surface. When he lighted the oil a hundred tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing.  \"Now, Princess,\" exclaimed the Wizard, \"those of your advisors who wished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step within this circle of light. If they advised you well, and were in the right, they will not be injured in any way. But if any advised you wrongly, the light will wither him.\"  The advisors of the Princess did not like this test; but she commanded them to step into the flame and one by one they did so, and were scorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that of baked potatoes. Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be dragged from the fire, and all were so withered that it would be necessary to plant them at once.  \"Sir,\" said the Princess to the Wizard, \"you are greater than any Sorcerer we have ever known. As it is evident that my people have advised me wrongly, I will not cast you three people into the dreadful Garden of the Clinging Vines; but your animals must be driven into the Black Pit in the mountain, for my subjects cannot bear to have them around.\"  The Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himself that he said nothing against this decree; but when the Princess had gone both Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the Black Pit, and Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to save them from such a fate.  For two or three days after this--if we call days the periods between sleep, there being no night to divide the hours into days--our friends were not disturbed in any way. They were even permitted to occupy the House of the Sorcerer in peace, as if it had been their own, and to wander in the gardens in search of food.  Once they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines, and walking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest. They saw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing and twisting around like a nest of great snakes. Everything the vines touched they crushed, and our adventurers were indeed thankful to have escaped being cast among them.  Whenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the nine tiny piglets from his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room to amuse themselves and get some exercise; and one time they found his glass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom part of the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka could. They knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to where she lay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her.  The cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches and watched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval.  \"Don't be rough!\" he would call out, if Eureka knocked over one of the round, fat piglets with her paw; but the pigs never minded, and enjoyed the sport very greatly.  Suddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent, solemn-eyed Mangaboos. Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch covered with sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the horse, the kitten and the piglets.  \"Here--stop this foolishness!\" Jim roared, angrily; but after being pricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the way of the thorns.  The Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks, but left an opening to the doorway of the hall; so the animals slowly retreated until they were driven from the room and out upon the street. Here were more of the vegetable people with thorns, and silently they urged the now frightened creatures down the street. Jim had to be careful not to step upon the tiny piglets, who scampered under his feet grunting and squealing, while Eureka, snarling and biting at the thorns pushed toward her, also tried to protect the pretty little things from injury. Slowly but steadily the heartless Mangaboos drove them on, until they had passed through the city and the gardens and come to the broad plains leading to the mountain.  \"What does all this mean, anyhow?\" asked the horse, jumping to escape a thorn.  \"Why, they are driving us toward the Black Pit, into which they threatened to cast us,\" replied the kitten. \"If I were as big as you are, Jim, I'd fight these miserable turnip-roots!\"  \"What would you do?\" enquired Jim.  \"I'd kick out with those long legs and iron-shod hoofs.\"  \"All right,\" said the horse; \"I'll do it.\"  An instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of Mangaboos and kicked out his hind legs as hard as he could. A dozen of them smashed together and tumbled to the ground, and seeing his success Jim kicked again and again, charging into the vegetable crowd, knocking them in all directions and sending the others scattering to escape his iron heels. Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy and scratching and biting furiously, and the kitten ruined so many vegetable complexions that the Mangaboos feared her as much as they did the horse.  But the foes were too many to be repulsed for long. They tired Jim and Eureka out, and although the field of battle was thickly covered with mashed and disabled Mangaboos, our animal friends had to give up at last and allow themselves to be driven to the mountain.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 7.  INTO THE BLACK PIT AND OUT AGAIN   When they came to the mountain it proved to be a rugged, towering chunk of deep green glass, and looked dismal and forbidding in the extreme. Half way up the steep was a yawning cave, black as night beyond the point where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it.  The Mangaboos drove the horse and the kitten and the piglets into this dark hole and then, having pushed the buggy in after them--for it seemed some of them had dragged it all the way from the domed hall--they began to pile big glass rocks within the entrance, so that the prisoners could not get out again.  \"This is dreadful!\" groaned Jim. \"It will be about the end of our adventures, I guess.\"  \"If the Wizard was here,\" said one of the piglets, sobbing bitterly, \"he would not see us suffer so.\"  \"We ought to have called him and Dorothy when we were first attacked,\" added Eureka. \"But never mind; be brave, my friends, and I will go and tell our masters where you are, and get them to come to your rescue.\"  The mouth of the hole was nearly filled up now, but the kitten gave a leap through the remaining opening and at once scampered up into the air. The Mangaboos saw her escape, and several of them caught up their thorns and gave chase, mounting through the air after her. Eureka, however, was lighter than the Mangaboos, and while they could mount only about a hundred feet above the earth the kitten found she could go nearly two hundred feet. So she ran along over their heads until she had left them far behind and below and had come to the city and the House of the Sorcerer. There she entered in at Dorothy's window in the dome and aroused her from her sleep.  As soon as the little girl knew what had happened she awakened the Wizard and Zeb, and at once preparations were made to go to the rescue of Jim and the piglets. The Wizard carried his satchel, which was quite heavy, and Zeb carried the two lanterns and the oil can. Dorothy's wicker suit-case was still under the seat of the buggy, and by good fortune the boy had also placed the harness in the buggy when he had taken it off from Jim to let the horse lie down and rest. So there was nothing for the girl to carry but the kitten, which she held close to her bosom and tried to comfort, for its little heart was still beating rapidly.  Some of the Mangaboos discovered them as soon as they left the House of the Sorcerer; but when they started toward the mountain the vegetable people allowed them to proceed without interference, yet followed in a crowd behind them so that they could not go back again.  Before long they neared the Black Pit, where a busy swarm of Mangaboos, headed by their Princess, was engaged in piling up glass rocks before the entrance.  \"Stop, I command you!\" cried the Wizard, in an angry tone, and at once began pulling down the rocks to liberate Jim and the piglets. Instead of opposing him in this they stood back in silence until he had made a good-sized hole in the barrier, when by order of the Princess they all sprang forward and thrust out their sharp thorns.  [Illustration: THROUGH THE BLACK PIT.]  Dorothy hopped inside the opening to escape being pricked, and Zeb and the Wizard, after enduring a few stabs from the thorns, were glad to follow her. At once the Mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glass again, and as the little man"]]]
