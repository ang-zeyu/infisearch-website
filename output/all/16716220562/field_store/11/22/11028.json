The error seems to have come from the _Analytical Index of the Remembrancia_, which (p. 355) incorrectly catalogues the letter of March 31, 1602, as referring to the \"Boar's Head in Eastcheap.\" The letter itself, however, when examined, gives no indication whatever of Eastcheap, and other evidence shows conclusively that the inn was situated in Whitechapel just outside of Aldgate.]  Although Flecknoe referred to the Order of the Common Council as a \"banishment,\" it did not actually drive the players from the city. They were able, through the intervention of the Privy Council, and on the old excuse of rehearsing plays for the Queen's entertainment, to occupy the inns for a large part of each year.[3] John Stockwood, in a sermon preached at Paul's Cross, August 24, 1578, bitterly complains of the \"eight ordinary places\" used regularly for plays, referring, it seems, to the five inns and the three playhouses--the Theatre, Curtain, and Blackfriars--recently opened to the public.  [Footnote 3: See especially _The Acts of the Privy Council_ and _The Remembrancia_ of the City of London.]  Richard Reulidge, in _A Monster Lately Found Out and Discovered_ (1628), writes that \"soon after 1580\" the authorities of London received permission from Queen Elizabeth and her Privy Council \"to thrust the players out of the city, and to pull down all playhouses and dicing-houses within their liberties: which accordingly was effected; and the playhouses in Gracious Street [i.e., the Bell and the Cross Keys], Bishopsgate Street [i.e., the Bull], that nigh Paul's [i.e., Paul's singing school?], that on Ludgate Hill [i.e., the Bell Savage], and the Whitefriars[4] were quite put down and suppressed by the care of these religious senators.\"  [Footnote 4: There is some error here. The city had no jurisdiction over Whitefriars, or Blackfriars either; but there was a playhouse in Blackfriars at the time, and it was suppressed in 1584, though not by the city authorities. Possibly Reulidge should have written \"Whitechapel.\"]  [Illustration: MAP OF LONDON SHOWING THE INN-PLAYHOUSES  1. The Bell Savage; 2. The Cross Keys; 3. The Bell; 4. The Bull; 5. The Boar's Head.]  Yet, in spite of what Reulidge says, these five inns continued to be used by the players for many years.[5] No doubt they were often used surreptitiously. In _Martin's Month's Mind_ (1589), we read that a person \"for a penie may have farre better [entertainment] by oddes at the Theatre and Curtaine, and _any blind playing house_ everie day.\"[6] But the more important troupes were commonly able, through the interference of the Privy Council, to get official permission to use the inns during a large part of each year.  [Footnote 5: _The Remembrancia_ shows that the inn-playhouses remained for many years as sharp thorns in the side of the puritanical city fathers.]  [Footnote 6: Grosart, _Nash_, I, 179.]  There is not enough material about these early inn-playhouses to enable one to write their separate histories. Below, however, I have recorded in chronological order the more important references to them which have come under my observation.  1557. On September 5 the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of London \"that some of his officers do forthwith repair to the Boar's Head without Aldgate, where, the Lords are informed, a lewd play called _A Sackful of News_ shall be played this day,\" to arrest the players, and send their playbook to the Council.[7]  [Footnote 7: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, VI, 168.]  1573. During this year there were various fencing contests held at the Bull in Bishopsgate.[8]  [Footnote 8: W. Rendle, _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 235.]  1577. In February the Office of the Revels made a payment of 10_d._ \"ffor the cariadge of the parts of ye well counterfeit from the Bell in gracious strete to St. Johns, to be performed for the play of _Cutwell_.\"[9]  [Footnote 9: A. Feuillerat, _Documents Relating to the Office of the Revels in the Time of Queen Elizabeth_, p. 277.]  1579. On June 23 James Burbage was arrested for the sum of Â£5 13_d._ \"as he came down Gracious Street towards the Cross Keys there to a play.\" The name of the proprietor of this inn-playhouse is preserved in one of the interrogatories connected with the case: \"Item. Whether did you, John Hynde, about xiii years past, in _anno_ 1579, the xxiii of June, about two of the clock in the afternoon, send the sheriff's officer unto the Cross Keys in Gratious Street, being then the dwelling house of Richard Ibotson, citizen and brewer of London,\" etc.[10] Nothing more, I believe, is known of this person.  [Footnote 10: Burbage _v._ Brayne, printed in C.W. Wallace, _The First London Theatre_, pp. 82, 90. Whether Burbage was going to the Cross Keys as a spectator or as an actor is not indicated; but the presumption is that he was then playing at the inn, although he was proprietor of the Theatre.]  1579. Stephen Gosson, in _The Schoole of Abuse_, writes favorably of \"the two prose books played at the Bell Savage, where you shall find never a word without wit, never a line without pith, never a letter placed in vain; the _Jew_ and _Ptolome_, shown at the Bull ... neither with amorous gesture wounding the eye, nor with slovenly talk hurting the ears of the chast hearers.\"[11]  [Footnote 11: Arber's _English Reprints_, p. 40.]  1582. On July 1 the Earl of Warwick wrote to the Lord Mayor requesting the city authorities to \"give license to my servant, John David, this bearer, to play his profest prizes in his science and profession of defence at the Bull in Bishopsgate, or some other convenient place to be assigned within the liberties of London.\" The Lord Mayor refused to allow David to give his fencing contest \"in an inn, which was somewhat too close for infection, and appointed him to play in an open place of the Leaden Hall,\" which, it may be added, was near the Bull.[12]  [Footnote 12: See The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 55-57.]  1583. William Rendle, in _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 235, states that in this year \"Tarleton, Wilson, and others note the stay of the plague, and ask leave to play at the Bull in Bishopsgate, or the Bell in Gracechurch Street,\" citing as his authority merely \"City MS.\" The Privy Council on November 26, 1583, addressed to the Lord Mayor a letter requesting \"that Her Majesty's Players [i.e., Tarleton, Wilson, etc.] may be suffered to play within the liberties as heretofore they have done.\"[13] And on November 28 the Lord Mayor issued to them a license to play \"at the sign of the Bull in Bishopsgate Street, and the sign of the Bell in Gracious Street, and nowhere else within this City.\"[14]  [Footnote 13: See _The Remembrancia_, in The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 66.]  [Footnote 14: C.W. Wallace, _The First London Theatre_, p. 11.]  1587. \"James Cranydge played his master's prize the 21 of November, 1587, at the Bellsavage without Ludgate, at iiij sundry kinds of weapons.... There played with him nine masters.\"[15]  [Footnote 15: _MS. Sloane_, 2530, f. 6-7, quoted by J.O. Halliwell in his edition of _Tarlton's Jests_, p. xi. The Bell Savage seems to have been especially patronized by fencers. George Silver, in his _Paradoxe of Defence_ (1599), tells how he and his brother once challenged two Italian fencers to a contest \"to be played at the Bell Savage upon the scaffold, when he that went in his fight faster back than he ought, should be in danger to break his neck off the scaffold.\"]  Before 1588. In _Tarlton's Jests_[16] we find a number of references to that famous actor's pleasantries in the London inns used by the Queen's Players. It is impossible to date these exactly, but Tarleton became a member of the Queen's Players in 1583, and he died in 1588.  [Footnote 16: First printed in 1611; reprinted by J.O. Halliwell for The Shakespeare Society in 1844.]       At the Bull in Bishops-gate-street, where the Queen's      Players oftentimes played, Tarleton coming on the stage, one      from the gallery threw a pippin at him.       There was one Banks, in the time of Tarleton, who served the      Earl of Essex, and had a horse of strange qualities; and      being at the Cross Keys in Gracious Street getting money      with him, as he was mightily resorted to. Tarleton then,      with his fellows playing at the Bell by, came into the Cross      Keys, amongst many people, to see fashions.       At the Bull at Bishops-gate was a play of Henry the Fifth.  The several \"jests\" which follow these introductory sentences indicate that the inn-yards differed in no essential way from the early public playhouses.  1588. \"John Mathews played his master's prize the 31 day of January, 1588, at the Bell Savage without Ludgate.\"[17]  [Footnote 17: _MS. Sloane_, 2530, f. 6-7, quoted by Halliwell in his edition of _Tarlton's Jests_, p. xi. There is some difficulty with the date. One of the \"masters\" before whom the prize was played was \"Rycharde Tarlton,\" whom Halliwell takes to be the famous actor of that name; but Tarleton the actor died on September 3, 1588. Probably Halliwell in transcribing the manuscript silently modernized the date from the Old Style.]  1589. In November Lord Burghley directed the Lord Mayor to \"give order for the stay of all plays within the city.\" In reply the Lord Mayor wrote:       According to which your Lordship's good pleasure, I      presently sent for such players as I could hear of; so as      there appeared yesterday before me the Lord Strange's      Players, to whom I specially gave in charge and required      them in Her Majesty's name to forbear playing until further      order might be given for their allowance in that respect.      Whereupon the Lord Admiral's Players very dutifully obeyed;      but the others, in very contemptuous manner"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],["title","Shakespearean Playhouses (#3)"],["body","from      me, went to the Cross Keys and played that afternoon.[18]  [Footnote 18: _Lansdowne MSS._ 60, quoted by Collier, _History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (1879), I, 265.]  1594. On October 8, Henry, Lord Hunsdon, the Lord Chamberlain and the patron of Shakespeare's company, wrote to the Lord Mayor:       After my hearty commendations. Where my now company of      players have been accustomed for the better exercise of      their quality, and for the service of Her Majesty if need so      require, to play this winter time within the city at the      Cross Keys in Gracious Street, these are to require and pray      your Lordship (the time being such as, thanks to God, there      is now no danger of the sickness) to permit and suffer them      so to do.[19]  [Footnote 19: _The Remembrancia_, The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 73.]  By such devices as this the players were usually able to secure permission to act \"within the city\" during the disagreeable months of the winter when the large playhouses in the suburbs were difficult of access.  1594. Anthony Bacon, the elder brother of Francis, came to lodge in Bishopsgate Street. This fact very much disturbed his good mother, who feared lest his servants might be corrupted by the plays to be seen at the Bull near by.[20]  [Footnote 20: See W. Rendle, _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 236.]  1596. William Lambarde, in his _Perambulation of Kent_,[21] observes that none of those who go \"to Paris Garden, the Bell Savage, or Theatre, to behold bear-baiting, interludes, or fence play, can account of any pleasant spectacle unless they first pay one penny at the gate, another at the entry of the scaffold, and the third for a quiet standing.\"  [Footnote 21: The passage does not appear in the earlier edition of 1576, though it was probably written shortly after the erection of the Theatre in the autumn of 1576.]  1602. On March 31 the Privy Council wrote to the Lord Mayor that the players of the Earl of Oxford and of the Earl of Worcester had been \"joined by agreement together in one company, to whom, upon notice of Her Majesty's pleasure, at the suit of the Earl of Oxford, toleration hath been thought meet to be granted.\" The letter concludes:       And as the other companies that are allowed, namely of me      the Lord Admiral, and the Lord Chamberlain, be appointed      their certain houses, and one and no more to each company,      so we do straightly require that this third company be      likewise [appointed] to one place. And because we are      informed the house called the Boar's Head is the place they      have especially used and do best like of, we do pray and      require you that the said house, namely the Boar's Head, may      be assigned unto them.[22]  [Footnote 22: _The Remembrancia_, The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 85.]  That the strong Oxford-Worcester combination should prefer the Boar's Head to the Curtain or the Rose Playhouse,[23] indicates that the inn-yard was not only large, but also well-equipped for acting.  [Footnote 23: They had to use the Rose nevertheless; see page 158.]  1604. In a draft of a license to be issued to Queen Anne's Company, those players are allowed to act \"as well within their now usual houses, called the Curtain and the Boar's Head, within our County of Middlesex, as in any other playhouse not used by others.\"[24]  [Footnote 24: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 265.]  In 1608 the Boar's Head seems to have been occupied by the newly organized Prince Charles's Company. In William Kelly's extracts from the payments of the city of Leicester we find the entry: \"Itm. Given to the Prince's Players, of Whitechapel, London, xx _s._\"  In 1664, as Flecknoe tells us, the Cross Keys and the Bull still gave evidence of their former use as playhouses; perhaps even then they were occasionally let for fencing and other contests. In 1666 the great fire completely destroyed the Bell, the Cross Keys, and the Bell Savage; the Bull, however, escaped, and enjoyed a prosperous career for many years after. Samuel Pepys was numbered among its patrons, and writers of the Restoration make frequent reference to it. What became of the Boar's Head without Aldgate I am unable to learn; its memory, however, is perpetuated to-day in Boar's Head Yard, between Middlesex Street and Goulston Street, Whitechapel.     CHAPTER II  THE HOSTILITY OF THE CITY   As the actors rapidly increased in number and importance, and as Londoners flocked in ever larger crowds to witness plays, the animosity of two forces was aroused, Puritanism and Civic Government,--forces which opposed the drama for different reasons, but with almost equal fervor. And when in the course of time the Governors of the city themselves became Puritans, the combined animosity thus produced was sufficient to drive the players out of London into the suburbs.  The Puritans attacked the drama as contrary to Holy Writ, as destructive of religion, and as a menace to public morality. Against plays, players, and playgoers they waged in pulpit and pamphlet a warfare characterized by the most intense fanaticism. The charges they made--of ungodliness, idolatrousness, lewdness, profanity, evil practices, enormities, and \"abuses\" of all kinds--are far too numerous to be noted here; they are interesting chiefly for their unreasonableness and for the violence with which they were urged.  And, after all, however much the Puritans might rage, they were helpless; authority to restrain acting was vested in the Lord Mayor, his brethren the Aldermen, and the Common Council. The attitude of these city officials towards the drama was unmistakable: they had no more love for the actors than had the Puritans. They found that \"plays and players\" gave them more trouble than anything else in the entire administration of municipal affairs. The dedication of certain \"great inns\" to the use of actors and to the entertainment of the pleasure-loving element of the city created new and serious problems for those charged with the preservation of civic law and order. The presence in these inns of private rooms adjoining the yard and balconies gave opportunity for immorality, gambling, fleecing, and various other \"evil practices\"--an opportunity which, if we may believe the Common Council, was not wasted. Moreover, the proprietors of these inns made a large share of their profits from the beer, ale, and other drinks dispensed to the crowds before, during, and after performances (the proprietor of the Cross Keys, it will be recalled, was described as \"citizen and brewer of London\"); and the resultant intemperance among \"such as frequented the said plays, being the ordinary place of meeting for all vagrant persons, and masterless men that hang about the city, theeves, horse-stealers, whoremongers, cozeners, cony-catching persons, practicers of treason, and such other like,\"[25] led to drunkenness, frays, bloodshed, and often to general disorder. Sometimes, as we know, turbulent apprentices and other factions met by appointment at plays for the sole purpose of starting riots or breaking open jails. \"Upon Whitsunday,\" writes the Recorder to Lord Burghley, \"by reason no plays were the same day, all the city was quiet.\"[26]  [Footnote 25: So the Lord Mayor characterized playgoers; see _The Remembrancia_, in The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 75.]  [Footnote 26: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 164.]  Trouble of an entirely different kind arose when in the hot months of the summer the plague was threatening. The meeting together at plays of \"great multitudes of the basest sort of people\" served to spread the infection throughout the city more quickly and effectively than could anything else. On such occasions it was exceedingly difficult for the municipal authorities to control the actors, who were at best a stubborn and unruly lot; and often the pestilence had secured a full start before acting could be suppressed.  These troubles, and others which cannot here be mentioned, made one of the Lord Mayors exclaim in despair: \"The Politique State and Government of this City by no one thing is so greatly annoyed and disquieted as by players and plays, and the disorders which follow thereupon.\"[27]  [Footnote 27: _The Remembrancia_, in The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 69.]  This annoyance, serious enough in itself, was aggravated by the fact that most of the troupes were under the patronage of great noblemen, and some were even high in favor with the Queen. As a result, the attempts on the part of the Lord Mayor and his Aldermen to regulate the players were often interfered with by other or higher authority. Sometimes it was a particular nobleman, whose request was not to be ignored, who intervened in behalf of his troupe; most often, however, it was the Privy Council, representing the Queen and the nobility in general, which championed the cause of the actors and countermanded the decrees of the Lord Mayor and his brethren. One of the most notable things in the City's _Remembrancia_ is this long conflict of authority between the Common Council and the Privy Council over actors and acting.  In 1573 the situation seems to have approached a crisis. The Lord Mayor had become strongly puritanical, and in his efforts to suppress \"stage-plays\" was placing more and more obstacles in the way of the actors. The temper of the Mayor is revealed in two entries in the records of the Privy Council. On July 13, 1573, the Lords of the Council sent a letter to him requesting him \"to permit liberty to certain Italian players\"; six days later they sent a second letter, repeating the request, and \"marveling that he did it not at their first request.\"[28] His continued efforts to suppress the drama finally led the troupes to appeal for relief to the Privy Council. On March 22, 1574, the Lords of the Council dispatched \"a letter to the Lord Mayor to advertise their Lordships what causes he hath to restrain plays.\" His answer has not "]]]
