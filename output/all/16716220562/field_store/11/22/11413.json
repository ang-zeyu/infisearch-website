You will now agree on this recording and before these witnesses, to obey my orders unquestioningly or I will now unload all Bureau of Science personnel and equipment onto this planet and send you and the _Perseus_ back to Terra with the doubly-sealed record of this episode posted to the Advisory Board. Take your choice.\"  Eyes locked, and under Hilton's uncompromising stare Sawtelle weakened. He fidgeted; tried three times--unsuccessfully--to blare defiance. Then, \"Very well sir,\" he said, and saluted.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Thank you, sir,\" Hilton said, then turned to his staff. \"Okay, Sandy, go ahead.\"  Outside the control room door, \"Thank God you don't play poker, Jarve!\" Karns gasped. \"We'd all owe you all the pay we'll ever get!\"  \"You think it was the bluff, yes?\" de Vaux asked. \"Me, I think no. Name of a name of a name! I was wondering with unease what life would be like on this so-alien planet!\"  \"You didn't need to wonder, Tiny,\" Hilton assured him. \"It was in the bag. He's incapable of abandonment.\"  Beverly Bell, the van der Moen twins and Temple Bells all stared at Hilton in awe; and Sandra felt much the same way.  \"But suppose he _had_ called you?\" Sandra demanded.  \"Speculating on the impossible is unprofitable,\" he said.  \"Oh, you're the most _exasperating_ thing!\" Sandra stamped a foot. \"Don't you--_ever_--answer a question intelligibly?\"  \"When the question is meaningless, chick, I can't.\"  At the lock Temple Bells, who had been hanging back, cocked an eyebrow at Hilton and he made his way to her side.  \"What was it you started to say back there, boss?\"  \"Oh, yes. That we should see each other oftener.\"  \"That's what I was hoping you were going to say.\" She put her hand under his elbow and pressed his arm lightly, fleetingly, against her side. \"That would be indubitably the fondest thing I could be of.\"  He laughed and gave her arm a friendly squeeze. Then he studied her again, the most baffling member of his staff. About five feet six. Lithe, hard, trained down fine--as a tennis champion, she would be. Stacked--_how_ she was stacked! Not as beautiful as Sandra or Teddy ... but with an ungodly lot of something that neither of them had ... nor any other woman he had ever known.  \"Yes, I am a little difficult to classify,\" she said quietly, almost reading his mind.  \"That's the understatement of the year! But I'm making some progress.\"  \"Such as?\" This was an open challenge.  \"Except possibly Teddy, the best brain aboard.\"  \"That isn't true, but go ahead.\"  \"You're a powerhouse. A tightly organized, thoroughly integrated, smoothly functioning, beautifully camouflaged Juggernaut. A reasonable facsimile of an irresistible force.\"  \"My God, Jarvis!\" That had gone deep.  \"Let me finish my analysis. You aren't head of your department because you don't want to be. You fooled the top psychs of the Board. You've been running ninety per cent submerged because you can work better that way and there's no glory-hound blood in you.\"  She stared at him, licking her lips. \"I knew your mind was a razor, but I didn't know it was a diamond drill, too. That seals your doom, boss, unless ... no, you can't _possibly_ know why I'm here.\"  \"Why, of course I do.\"  \"You just think you do. You see, I've been in love with you ever since, as a gangling, bony, knobby-kneed kid, I listened to your first doctorate disputation. Ever since then, my purpose in life has been to land you.\"     III   \"But listen!\" he exclaimed. \"I _can't_, even if I want....\"  \"Of course you can't.\" Pure deviltry danced in her eyes. \"You're the Director. It wouldn't be proper. But it's Standard Operating Procedure for simple, innocent, unsophisticated little country girls like me to go completely overboard for the boss.\"  \"But you can't--you _mustn't_!\" he protested in panic.  Temple Bells was getting plenty of revenge for the shocks he had given her. \"I can't? Watch me!\" She grinned up at him, her eyes still dancing. \"Every chance I get, I'm going to hug your arm like I did a minute ago. And you'll take hold of my forearm, like you did! That can be taken, you see, as either: One, a reluctant acceptance of a mildly distasteful but not quite actionable situation, or: Two, a blocking move to keep me from climbing up you like a squirrel!\"  \"Confound it, Temple, you _can't_ be serious!\"  \"Can't I?\" She laughed gleefully. \"Especially with half a dozen of those other cats watching? Just wait and see, boss!\"  Sandra and her two guests came aboard. The natives looked around; the man at the various human men, the woman at each of the human women. The woman remained beside Sandra; the man took his place at Hilton's left, looking up--he was a couple of inches shorter than Hilton's six feet one--with an air of ... of _expectancy_!  \"Why this arrangement, Sandy?\" Hilton asked.  \"Because we're tops. It's your move, Jarve. What's first?\"  \"Uranexite. Come along, Sport. I'll call you that until ...\"  \"Laro,\" the native said, in a deep resonant bass voice. He hit himself a blow on the head that would have floored any two ordinary men. \"Sora,\" he announced, striking the alien woman a similar blow.  \"Laro and Sora, I would like to have you look at our uranexite, with the idea of refueling our ship. Come with me, please?\"  Both nodded and followed him. In the engine room he pointed at the engines, then to the lead-blocked labyrinth leading to the fuel holds. \"Laro, do you understand 'hot'? Radioactive?\"  Laro nodded--and started to open the heavy lead door!  \"Hey!\" Hilton yelped. \"That's hot!\" He seized Laro's arm to pull him away--and got the shock of his life. Laro weighed at least five hundred pounds! And the guy _still_ looked human!  Laro nodded again and gave himself a terrific thump on the chest. Then he glanced at Sora, who stepped away from Sandra. He then went into the hold and came out with two fuel pellets in his hand, one of which he tossed to Sora. That is, the motion looked like a toss, but the pellet traveled like a bullet. Sora caught it unconcernedly and both natives flipped the pellets into their mouths. There was a half minute of rock-crusher crunching; then both natives opened their mouths.  The pellets had been pulverized and swallowed.  Hilton's voice rang out. \"Poynter! How _can_ these people be non-radioactive after eating a whole fuel pellet apiece?\"  Poynter tested both natives again. \"Cold,\" he reported. \"Stone cold. No background even. Play _that_ on your harmonica!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Laro nodded, perfectly matter-of-factly, and in Hilton's mind there formed a picture. It was not clear, but it showed plainly enough a long line of aliens approaching the _Perseus_. Each carried on his or her shoulder a lead container holding two hundred pounds of Navy Regulation fuel pellets. A standard loading-tube was sealed into place and every fuel-hold was filled.  This picture, Laro indicated plainly, could become reality any time.  Sawtelle was notified and came on the run. \"No fuel is coming aboard without being tested!\" he roared.  \"Of course not. But it'll pass, for all the tea in China. You haven't had a ten per cent load of fuel since you were launched. You can fill up or not--the fuel's here--just as you say.\"  \"If they can make Navy standard, of course we want it.\"  The fuel arrived. Every load tested well above standard. Every fuel hold was filled to capacity, with no leakage and no emanation. The natives who had handled the stuff did not go away, but gathered in the engine-room; and more and more humans trickled in to see what was going on.  Sawtelle stiffened. \"What's going on over there, Hilton?\"  \"I don't know; but let's let 'em go for a minute. I want to learn about these people and they've got me stopped cold.\"  \"You aren't the only one. But if they wreck that Mayfield it'll cost you over twenty thousand dollars.\"  \"Okay.\" The captain and director watched, wide eyed.  Two master mechanics had been getting ready to re-fit a tube--a job requiring both strength and skill. The tube was very heavy and made of superefract. The machine--the Mayfield--upon which the work was to be done, was extremely complex.  Two of the aliens had brushed the mechanics--very gently--aside and were doing their work for them. Ignoring the hoist, one native had picked the tube up and was holding it exactly in place on the Mayfield. The other, hands moving faster than the eye could follow, was locking it--micrometrically precise and immovably secure--into place.  \"How about this?\" one of the mechanics asked of his immediate superior. \"If we throw 'em out, how do we do it?\"  By a jerk of the head, the non-com passed the buck to a commissioned officer, who relayed it up the line to Sawtelle, who said, \"Hilton, _no_body can run a Mayfield without months of training. They'll wreck it and it'll cost you ... but I'm getting curious myself. Enough so to take half the damage. Let 'em go ahead.\"  \"How _about_ this, Mike?\" one of the machinists asked of his fellow. \"I'm going to _like_ this, what?\"  \"Ya-as, my deah Chumley,\" the other drawled, affectedly. \"My man relieves me of _so_ much uncouth effort.\"  The natives had kept on working. The Mayfield was running. It had always howled and screamed at its work, but now it gave out only a smooth and even hum. The aliens had adjusted it with unhuman precision; they were one with it as no human being could possibly be. And every mind present knew that those aliens were, at long, long last, fulfilling their destiny and were, in that fulfillment, supremely happy. After tens of thousands of cycles of time they were doing a job for their adored, their revered and beloved MASTERS.  That was a stunning shock; but it was eclipsed by another.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I am sorry, Master Hilton,\" Laro's tremendous bass voice boomed out, \"that it has"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22754"],["title","Masters of Space (#4)"],["body","us so long to learn your Masters' language as it now is. Since you left us you have changed it radically; while we, of course, have not changed it at all.\"  \"I'm sorry, but you're mistaken,\" Hilton said. \"We are merely visitors. We have never been here before; nor, as far as we know, were any of our ancestors ever here.\"  \"You need not test us, Master. We have kept your trust. Everything has been kept, changelessly the same, awaiting your return as you ordered so long ago.\"  \"Can you read my mind?\" Hilton demanded.  \"Of course; but Omans can not read in Masters' minds anything except what Masters want Omans to read.\"  \"Omans?\" Harkins asked. \"Where did you Omans and your masters come from? Originally?\"  \"As you know, Master, the Masters came originally from Arth. They populated Ardu, where we Omans were developed. When the Stretts drove us from Ardu, we all came to Ardry, which was your home world until you left it in our care. We keep also this, your half of the Fuel World, in trust for you.\"  \"Listen, Jarve!\" Harkins said, tensely. \"Oman-human. Arth-Earth. Ardu-Earth Two. Ardry-Earth Three. You can't laugh them off ... but there never _was_ an Atlantis!\"  \"This is getting no better fast. We need a full staff meeting. You, too, Sawtelle, and your best man. We need all the brains the _Perseus_ can muster.\"  \"You're right. But first, get those naked women out of here. It's bad enough, having women aboard at all, but this ... my men are _spacemen_, mister.\"  Laro spoke up. \"If it is the Masters' pleasure to keep on testing us, so be it. We have forgotten nothing. A dwelling awaits each Master, in which each will be served by Omans who will know the Master's desires without being told. Every desire. While we Omans have no biological urges, we are of course highly skilled in relieving tensions and derive as much pleasure from that service as from any other.\"  Sawtelle broke the silence that followed. \"Well, for the men--\" He hesitated. \"Especially on the ground ... well, talking in mixed company, you know, but I think ...\"  \"Think nothing of the mixed company, Captain Sawtelle,\" Sandra said. \"We women are scientists, not shrinking violets. We are accustomed to discussing the facts of life just as frankly as any other facts.\"  Sawtelle jerked a thumb at Hilton, who followed him out into the corridor. \"I _have_ been a Navy mule,\" he said. \"I admit now that I'm out-maneuvered, out-manned, and out-gunned.\"  \"I'm just as baffled--at present--as you are, sir. But my training has been aimed specifically at the unexpected, while yours has not.\"  \"That's letting me down easy, Jarve.\" Sawtelle smiled--the first time the startled Hilton had known that the hard, tough old spacehound _could_ smile. \"What I wanted to say is, lead on. I'll follow you through force-field and space-warps.\"  \"Thanks, skipper. And by the way, I erased that record yesterday.\" The two gripped hands; and there came into being a relationship that was to become a lifelong friendship.         *       *       *       *       *  \"We will start for Ardry immediately,\" Hilton said. \"How do we make that jump without charts, Laro?\"  \"Very easily, Master. Kedo, as Master Captain Sawtelle's Oman, will give the orders. Nito will serve Master Snowden and supply the knowledge he says he has forgotten.\"  \"Okay. We'll go up to the control room and get started.\"  And in the control room, Kedo's voice rasped into the captain's microphone. \"Attention, all personnel! Master Captain Sawtelle orders take-off in two minutes. The countdown will begin at five seconds.... Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Lift!\"  Nito, not Snowden, handled the controls. As perfectly as the human pilot had ever done it, at the top of his finest form, he picked the immense spaceship up and slipped it silkily into subspace.  \"Well, I'll be a ...\" Snowden gasped. \"That's a better job than I _ever_ did!\"  \"Not at all, Master, as you know,\" Nito said. \"It was you who did this. I merely performed the labor.\"  A few minutes later, in the main lounge, Navy and BuSci personnel were mingling as they had never done before. Whatever had caused this relaxation of tension--the friendship of captain and director? The position in which they all were? Or what?--they all began to get acquainted with each other.  \"Silence, please, and be seated,\" Hilton said. \"While this is not exactly a formal meeting, it will be recorded for future reference. First, I will ask Laro a question. Were books or records left on Ardry by the race you call the Masters?\"  \"You know there are, Master. They are exactly as you left them. Undisturbed for over two hundred seventy-one thousand years.\"  \"Therefore we will not question the Omans. We do not know what questions to ask. We have seen many things hitherto thought impossible. Hence, we must discard all preconceived opinions which conflict with facts. I will mention a few of the problems we face.\"  \"The Omans. The Masters. The upgrading of the armament of the _Perseus_ to Oman standards. The concentration of uranexite. What is that concentrate? How is it used? Total conversion--how is it accomplished? The skeletons--what are they and how are they controlled? Their ability to drain power. Who or what is back of them? Why a deadlock that has lasted over a quarter of a million years? How much danger are we and the _Perseus_ actually in? How much danger is Terra in, because of our presence here? There are many other questions.\"  \"Sandra and I will not take part. Nor will three others; de Vaux, Eisenstein, and Blake. You have more important work to do.\"  \"What can that be?\" asked Rebecca. \"Of what possible use can a mathematician, a theoretician and a theoretical astronomer be in such a situation as this?\"  \"You can think powerfully in abstract terms, unhampered by Terran facts and laws which we now know are neither facts nor laws. I cannot even categorize the problems we face. Perhaps you three will be able to. You will listen, then consult, then tell me how to pick the teams to do the work. A more important job for you is this: Any problem, to be solved, must be stated clearly; and we don't know even what our basic problem is. I want something by the use of which I can break this thing open. Get it for me.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Rebecca and de Vaux merely smiled and nodded, but Teddy Blake said happily, \"I was beginning to feel like a fifth wheel on this project, but _that's_ something I can really stick my teeth into.\"  \"Huh? How?\" Karns demanded. \"He didn't give you one single thing to go on; just compounded the confusion.\"  Hilton spoke before Teddy could. \"That's their dish, Bill. If I had any data I'd work it myself. You first, Captain Sawtelle.\"  That conference was a very long one indeed. There were almost as many conclusions and recommendations as there were speakers. And through it all Hilton and Sandra listened. They weighed and tested and analyzed and made copious notes; in shorthand and in the more esoteric characters of symbolic logic. And at its end:  \"I'm just about pooped, Sandy. How about you?\"  \"You and me both, boss. See you in the morning.\"  But she didn't. It was four o'clock in the afternoon when they met again.  \"We made up one of the teams, Sandy,\" he said, with surprising diffidence. \"I know we were going to do it together, but I got a hunch on the first team. A kind of a weirdie, but the brains checked me on it.\" He placed a card on her desk. \"Don't blow your top until after I you've studied it.\"  \"Why, I won't, of course....\" Her voice died away. \"Maybe you'd better cancel that 'of course'....\" She studied, and when she spoke again she was exerting self-control. \"A chemist, a planetographer, a theoretician, _two_ sociologists, a psychologist and a radiationist. And six of the seven are three pairs of sweeties. What kind of a line-up is _that_ to solve a problem in _physics_?\"  \"It isn't in any physics we know. I said _think_!\"  \"Oh,\" she said, then again \"Oh,\" and \"Oh,\" and \"Oh.\" Four entirely different tones. \"I see ... maybe. You're matching minds, not specialties; and supplementing?\"  \"I knew you were smart. Buy it?\"  \"It's weird, all right, but I'll buy it--for a trial run, anyway. But I'd hate like sin to have to sell any part of it to the Board.... But of course we're--I mean you're responsible only to yourself.\"  \"Keep it 'we', Sandy. You're as important to this project as I am. But before we tackle the second team, what's your thought on Bernadine and Hermione? Separate or together?\"  \"Separate, I'd say. They're identical physically, and so nearly so mentally that of them would be just as good on a team as both of them. More and better work on different teams.\"  \"My thought exactly.\" And so it went, hour after hour.  The teams were selected and meetings were held.         *       *       *       *       *  The _Perseus_ reached Ardry, which was very much like Terra. There were continents, oceans, ice-caps, lakes, rivers, mountains and plains, forests and prairies. The ship landed on the spacefield of Omlu, the City of the Masters, and Sawtelle called Hilton into his cabin. The Omans Laro and Kedo went along, of course.  \"Nobody knows how it leaked ...\" Sawtelle began.  \"No secrets around here,\" Hilton grinned. \"Omans, you know.\"  \"I suppose so. Anyway, every man aboard is all hyped up about living aground--especially with a harem. But before I grant liberty, suppose there's any VD around here that our prophylactics can't handle?\"  \"As you know, Masters,\" Laro replied for Hilton before the latter could open his mouth, \"no disease, venereal or other, is allowed to exist on Ardry. No prophylaxis is either necessary or desirable.\"  \"That ought to hold you for a while, Skipper.\" Hilton smiled at the flabbergasted captain and went back to the lounge.  \"Everybody going ashore?\" he asked.  \"Yes.\" Karns said. \"Unanimous vote for the first time.\"  \"Who wouldn't?\" Sandra asked. \"I'm fed up with living like a sardine. I will scream for joy the"]]]
