The forward end turns slightly upward, as you see by the pictures, so as to pass over the snow easily.  Joseff left me, and soon came back with a good many more skees; some were not more than six feet long; one pair was much longer than mine.  After I had looked at them, he said, \"The short ones are used in the forest, especially among the Lapps, where pine, fir, or birch trees are close together, for there long skees cannot be used; but a heavily built man must have longer ones.\" Then pointing to the long pair, which were about fourteen feet long, he said, \"These long skees are used chiefly in the province of Jemtland, which you passed on the shores of the Baltic on your way here. The snow is generally very deep there, and after a great snow fall, when it is very soft, long skees are needed so that they can bear up the weight of a man and not sink too deeply. Here we use skees of about the size of the pair I gave you, sometimes a little longer; but you are not a heavy man, so longer ones are not necessary for you. They will be able to support your weight without going deeply into the snow, even when it is soft.\"  Then showing another pair, he said, \"These have sealskin under them. They are used in the spring when the snow is soft and becomes watery; the skin prevents the snow from sticking to the skee.\"  The following morning we started with our skees for the lake, I carrying mine on my shoulders. When we reached the lake Joseff said, \"Put your feet under the loops, and you must manage to keep them there, just as you would do if you had an old pair of slippers much too large for you. You would have all the time to push your feet forward to keep them on. Do likewise with the skees. Your sharp-pointed Lapp shoes will help you to do this, as they somewhat prevent the slipping of the skee. It will be a little difficult at first, but it will not take long for you to learn to do this. Constant practice will be the best teacher, and you will soon be able to walk with them.\"  Then Joseff gave me two staves to propel myself with. At the end of each was an iron spike, and above it a guard of wicker-work, about ten inches in diameter, to prevent the stick from sinking deeper. \"These staves,\" he added, \"are very useful when the snow is soft and the skees do not glide easily. Then propelling oneself with them makes one go faster. Though the snow is packed they will help you, as you are a beginner. The most important point to learn is to keep the skees always parallel with each other; this is somewhat difficult at first. Never raise your feet or skees above the ground; make them glide on the snow; push one foot forward, then the other, just as when you walk.\"  Then he got on his skees, and said: \"Now, look at me and see how I go.\" I saw him gliding on the snow, pushing first one foot then the other, the two skees running parallel with each other; and when one had a tendency to go inside or outside, he corrected the deviation at once by a slight movement of his leg and foot. I noticed afterward that with many persons the ankle was very flexible, owing to their going so much on skees.  After going some distance he returned to me, and we started slowly together. I pushed first one foot then the other forward, and tried to do exactly what he had told me to do; but before I knew it the end of one skee overlapped the other and stopped my advance at once. Fortunately I was going slowly, otherwise I should have landed on the snow. \"The overlapping of one skee over the other is quite common with a beginner,\" said my teacher to me.  Putting my skees in position again, we started. This time one of my skees left me. Several times the two left me, and I found myself seated on the snow every time. I made slow progress that day. At the end of the lesson Joseff said, \"Do not be discouraged, Paulus, you will soon learn the knack. I will now show you how fast a man can go on skees. Look at me.\" Then he started; he seemed simply to fly over the snow, and before many minutes he was far away, almost out of sight. He was going at the rate of at least twenty miles an hour.  I said to myself: \"O Paul, when will you go as fast as Joseff!\" I was filled with ambition. I wanted to learn as fast as I could, and I thought I would take lessons every day.  When he returned the perspiration was dripping from his face, though the cold was 39 degrees below zero.  I spent several hours every day on the lake, learning and practising, and when Joseff had time he would come with me; and after three days I was able to manage the skees tolerably well. I kept them in line and they did not slip out from my feet any more. I could go several thousand yards without stopping and with no mishaps.  After I could do this, Joseff said to me: \"Paulus, you know now how to go well on skees upon level land; now you must learn how to go down hill with them. This is difficult, and I do not know whether in one winter you can learn how to do it--at least so as to go down the slopes of mountains; one has to have learned that in boyhood--but I will teach you anyhow to go down hill safely.\"  We left the farm and went on with our skees until we came to the foot of a pretty steep hill. Then Joseff said: \"We will stop here, and I will teach you to go down hill.\"  I noticed that he said this with a roguish eye, which was full of fun, and I began to suspect that things were not to go as smoothly as when I was taught on the lake. \"We cannot ascend this steep hill straight forward, for the skees would slip backward. We must ascend in zigzag,\" said Joseff; and then with his staff he showed me how we were to go. \"Follow my furrow, then it will be easier for you,\" said he. I found it hard enough, and slow work. When we reached the top of the hill we were very warm, though that day it was 32 degrees below zero. I was wet with perspiration.  After a rest, Joseff said: \"Paulus, look at me.\" Straightening his skees and armed with his staff he leaned his body forward, and down he went, faster than boys coasting down a very steep hill at home. It was fine, and I wished I could learn quickly and go down hill as fast as he did.  When he had ascended the hill again, Joseff said to me: \"Now, Paulus, get ready.\" He saw that my skees were in position, and saying, \"Bend your body far forward as you go down,\" he shouted \"Go!\" At this word I bent my body forward as he had told me, and down I went; but I got scared, as I was going very fast, and forgot to follow his advice; straightened myself and bent backward, and before I knew it my skees slipped from my feet. I was unskeed just like a man who is unhorsed, and was seated on the snow looking at my skees, which were going forward down the steep hill and only stopped at its base, to the great amusement of Joseff, who evidently expected something of the kind. \"The tendency of a beginner,\" he explained, \"is to bend backward, thinking that by doing so he will be able not to go so fast; this invariably brings about the same result, and he falls.\"  After a good laugh from both of us, Joseff said: \"Paulus, try again; but this time I will teach you to go down hill in another way.\" He gave me his big stick, and said, \"Ride this, and rest upon it as heavily as you can, so that a great part of your weight shall be on the end that sinks into the snow, and before you start let the stick be in the snow about three inches deep. Thus you will be prevented from going down too fast. Don't forget to start with your skees running straight along side of each other.\" I went down riding the stick, and reached the bottom of the hill in safety. I felt very proud of my success, but thought that if I could ever do this like Joseff how happy I should be.  Then Joseff gave me another warning. \"Paulus,\" said he, \"people must look out carefully not to run into boulders as they go down hill, and a hill full of boulders only those who can guide their skees well can venture to go down. Avoid such hills when you are further north, for otherwise you might even be killed.\"  [Illustration: \"Paulus, try again!\"]  Shortly after our return to the farm the wind began again to rise, and another terrific windstorm blew over the land. The hillocks of snow were swept from where they stood and new hillocks were made in other places. When I went out the wind almost took me off my feet.  I found that my friends in Haparanda were right. The Lapp costume is well adapted for cold weather. Nothing is warmer than reindeer skin, and it is convenient either when the wearer is driving in his Lapp sleigh, walking or travelling on skees, or when breasting violent windstorms.  I finally bade good-bye to Joseff, and thanked him for having taught me to go on skees. And I continued my journey northward, with a guide to show me the way.     CHAPTER VIII   A PRIMITIVE STEAM BATH HOUSE.--HOW THE BATH WAS PREPARED.--WHAT ARE THE      TWIGS FOR?--I ASCERTAIN.--ROLLING IN THE SNOW.--FINE EFFECT OF THE      BATH.   A few miles further on I came to a little hamlet composed of a few farms. The inhabitants were all Finlanders. Travelling was so bad, on account of the big drifts of snow, that I decided to stay a few days in the place. The following day was Saturday and the afternoon was the beginning of Sunday, and the boys and the young men of the place said to me: \"Paulus, to-day is bathing day. Every Saturday we have a bath.\"  \"All right, boys,\" I replied, \"I will have a bath with you.\" Of course they did not mean a water bath, but a steam bath.  Pointing to a little log building, they said, \"Paulus, this is the bath house. Come, and we will show you how we work out a steam bath in our country. You see the bath house stands away from other buildings, to prevent the fire from spreading in case it should start anywhere.\"  So I went with them to the bath house and got in.

Nor can there be any doubt that, when he started on board the _Beagle_, such opinions as he had were on the side of immutability. When therefore did the current of his thoughts begin to set in the direction of Evolution?       {1} See the extracts in _Life and Letters of Charles Darwin_, ii.      p. 5.  We have first to consider the factors that made for such a change. On his departure in 1831, Henslow gave him vol. I. of Lyell's _Principles_, then just published, with the warning that he was not to believe what he read{2}. But believe he did, and it is certain (as Huxley has forcibly pointed out{3}) that the doctrine of uniformitarianism when applied to Biology leads of necessity to Evolution. If the extermination of a species is no more catastrophic than the natural death of an individual, why should the birth of a species be any more miraculous than the birth of an individual? It is quite clear that this thought was vividly present to Darwin when he was writing out his early thoughts in the 1837 Note Book{4}:--  \"Propagation explains why modern animals same type as extinct, which is law almost proved. They die, without they change, like golden pippins; it is a _generation of species_ like generation _of individuals_.\"  \"If _species_ generate other _species_ their race is not utterly cut off.\"       {2} The second volume,--especially important in regard to      Evolution,--reached him in the autumn of 1832, as Prof. Judd has      pointed out in his most interesting paper in _Darwin and Modern      Science_. Cambridge, 1909.       {3} Obituary Notice of C. Darwin, _Proc. R. Soc._ vol. 44.      Reprinted in Huxley's _Collected Essays_. See also _Life and      Letters of C. Darwin_, ii. p. 179.       {4} See the extracts in the _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 5.  These quotations show that he was struggling to see in the origin of species a process just as scientifically comprehensible as the birth of individuals. They show, I think, that he recognised the two things not merely as similar but as identical.  It is impossible to know how soon the ferment of uniformitarianism began to work, but it is fair to suspect that in 1832 he had already begun to see that mutability was the logical conclusion of Lyell's doctrine, though this was not acknowledged by Lyell himself.  There were however other factors of change. In his Autobiography{5} he wrote:--\"During the voyage of the _Beagle_ I had been deeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil animals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos; secondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one another in proceeding southward over the Continent; and thirdly, by the South"]]]
