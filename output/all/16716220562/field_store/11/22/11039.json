Shut your eyes and go to sleep. See me! I am not afraid, if it is dark and gloomy. Oh, oh!\" cried the boaster, for the owl had seized him and was carrying him away from home and his little brothers.  When the mother quail came home, she asked, \"Where is your brother?\" The little quails did not know. All they could say was that something had seized him in the darkness and taken him away.  \"It crept up to the nest in the dark,\" said one.  \"And oh, mother, never, never go away from us again!\" cried another. \"Do not leave us at home all alone.\"  \"But, my dear little ones,\" the mother said, \"how could you have any food if I never went away from our home?\"  The mother quail was very sad, and she would have been still more sorrowful if she had known what was happening to her little son far away in the owl's nest. The cruel owl had pulled and pulled on the quail's bill and legs, till they were so long that his mother would not have known him.  One night the mole came to the quail and said, \"Your little son is in the owl's nest.\"  \"How do you know?\" asked the quail.  \"I cannot see very well,\" answered the mole, \"but I heard him call, and I know that he is there.\"  \"How shall I get him away from the owl?\" the quail asked the mole.  \"The owl crept up to your home in the dark,\" said the mole, \"but you must go to her nest at sunrise when the light shines in her eyes and she cannot see you.\"  At sunrise the quail crept up to the owl's nest and carried away her dear little son to his old home. As the light grew brighter, she saw what had happened to him. His bill and his legs were so long that he did not look like her son.  \"He is not like our brother,\" said the other little quails.  \"That is because the cruel owl that carried him away has pulled his bill and his legs,\" answered the mother sorrowfully. \"You must be very good to him.\"  But the other little quails were not good to him. They laughed at him, and the quail with the long bill and legs was never again merry and glad with them. Before long he ran away and hid among the great reeds that stand in the water and on the shores of the pond.  \"I will not be called quail,\" he said to himself, \"for quails never have long bills and legs. I will have a new name, and it shall be snipe. I like the sound of that name.\"  So it was that the bird whose name was once quail came to be called snipe. His children live among the reeds of the pond, and they, too, are called snipes.     WHY THE SERPENT SHEDS HIS SKIN.   The serpent is the grandfather of the owl, and once upon a time if the owl needed help, she would say, \"My grandfather will come and help me,\" but now he never comes to her. This story tells why.  When the owl carried away the little quail, she went to the serpent and said, \"Grandfather, you will not tell the quail that I have her son, will you?\"  \"No,\" answered the serpent, \"I will keep your secret. I will not whisper it to any one.\" So when the mother quail asked all the animals, \"Can you tell me who has carried away my little son?\" the serpent answered, \"I have been sound asleep. How could I know?\"  After the quail had become a snipe and had gone to live in the marsh among the reeds, the cruel owl looked everywhere for him, and at last she saw him standing beside a great stone in the water.  She went to the serpent and said, \"Grandfather, will you do something for me?\"  \"I will,\" hissed the serpent softly, \"What is it?\"  \"Only to take a drink of water,\" answered the owl. \"Come and drink all the water in the marsh, and then I can catch the quail that I made into a snipe.\"  The serpent drank and drank, but still there was water in the marsh.  \"Why do you not drink faster?\" cried the owl. \"I shall never get the snipe.\"  The serpent drank till he could drink no more, and still the water stood in the marsh. The owl could not see well by day, and the serpent could not see above the reeds and rushes, so they did not know that the water from the pond was coming into the marsh faster than the serpent could drink it.  Still the serpent drank, and at last his skin burst.  \"Oh,\" he cried, \"my skin has burst. Help me to fasten it together.\"  \"My skin never bursts,\" said the owl. \"If you will drink the water from the marsh, I will help you, but I will not fasten any skin together till I get that snipe.\"  The serpent had done all that he could to help the owl, and now he was angry. He was afraid, too, for he did not know what would happen to him, and he lay on the ground trembling and quivering. It was not long before his old skin fell off, and then he saw that under it was a beautiful new one, all bright and shining. He sheds his old skin every year now, but never again has he done anything to help the owl.  [Illustration]     WHY THE DOVE IS TIMID.   A spirit called the manito always watches over the Indians. He is glad when they are brave, but if they are cowardly, he is angry.  One day when the manito was walking under the pine-trees, he heard a cry of terror in the forest.  \"What is that?\" said he. \"Can it be that any of my Indian children are afraid?\"  As he stood listening, an Indian boy came running from the thicket, crying in fear.  \"What are you afraid of?\" asked the manito.  \"My mother told me to go into the forest with my bow and arrows and shoot some animal for food,\" said the boy.  \"That is what all Indian boys must do,\" said the manito. \"Why do you not do as she said?\"  \"Oh, the great bear is in the forest, and I am afraid of him!\"  \"Afraid of Hoots?\" asked the manito. \"An Indian boy must never be afraid.\"  \"But Hoots will eat me, I know he will,\" cried the boy. \"Boo-hoo, boo-hoo!\"  \"A boy must be brave,\" said the manito, \"and I will not have a coward among my Indians. You are too timid ever to be a warrior, and so you shall be a bird. Whenever Indian boys look at you, they will say, 'There is the boy who was afraid of Hoots.'\"  The boy's cloak of deerskin fell off, and feathers came out all over his body. His feet were no longer like a boy's feet, they were like the feet of a bird. His bow and arrows fell upon the grass, for he had no longer any hands with which to hold them. He tried to call to his mother, but the only sound he could make was \"Hoo, hoo!\"  \"Now you are a dove,\" said the manito, \"and a dove you shall be as long as you live. You shall always be known as the most timid of birds.\"  Again the dove that had once been a boy tried to call, but he only said, \"Hoo, hoo!\"  \"That is the only sound you will ever make,\" said the manito, \"and when the other boys hear it, they will say, 'Listen! He was afraid of Hoots, the bear, and that is why he says Hoo, hoo!'\"     WHY THE PARROT REPEATS THE WORDS OF MEN.   In the olden times when the earth was young, all the birds knew the language of men and could talk with them. Everybody liked the parrot, because he always told things as they were, and they called him the bird that tells the truth.  This bird that always told the truth lived with a man who was a thief, and one night the man killed another man's ox and hid its flesh.  When the other man came to look for it in the morning, he asked the thief, \"Have you seen my ox?\"  \"No, I have not seen it,\" said the man.  \"Is that the truth?\" the owner asked.  \"Yes, it is. I have not seen the ox,\" repeated the man.  \"Ask the parrot,\" said one of the villagers. \"He always tells the truth.\"  \"O bird of truth,\" said they to the parrot, \"did this man kill an ox and hide its flesh?\"  \"Yes, he did,\" answered the parrot.  The thief knew well that the villagers would punish him the next day, if he could not make them think that the parrot did not always tell the truth.  \"I have it,\" he said to himself at last. \"I know what I can do.\"  When night came he put a great jar over the parrot. Then he poured water upon the jar and struck it many times with a tough piece of oak. This he did half the night. Then he went to bed and was soon fast asleep.  In the morning the men came to punish him.  \"How do you know that I killed the ox?\" he asked.  \"Because the bird of truth says that you did,\" they answered.  \"The bird of truth!\" he cried. \"That parrot is no bird of truth. He will not tell the truth even about what happened last night. Ask him if the moon was shining.\"  \"Did the moon shine last night?\" the men asked.  \"No,\" answered the parrot. \"There was no moon, for the rain fell, and there was a great storm in the heavens. I heard the thunder half the night.\"  \"This bird has always told the truth before,\" said the villagers, \"but there was no storm last night and the moon was bright. What shall we do to punish the parrot?\" they asked the thief.  \"I think we will no longer let him live in our homes,\" answered the thief.  \"Yes,\" said the others, \"he must fly away to the forest, and even when there is a storm, he can no longer come to our homes, because we know now that he is a bird of a lying tongue.\"  [Illustration: \"THIS BIRD HAS ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH\"]  So the parrot flew away sorrowfully into the lonely forest. He met a mocking-bird and told him what had happened.  \"Why did you not repeat men's words as I do?\" asked the mocking-bird. \"Men always think their own words are good.\"  \"But the man's words were not true,\" said the parrot.  \"That is nothing,\" replied the mocking-bird, laughing. \"Say what they say, and they will think you are a wonderful bird.\"  \"Yes, I see,\" said the parrot thoughtfully, \"and I will never again be punished for telling the truth. I will only repeat the words of others.\"     THE STORY OF THE FIRST MOCKING-BIRD.   Far away in the forest there once lived the most cruel man on all the earth. He did not like the Indians, and he said to himself, \"Some day I will be ruler of them all.\" Then he thought, \"There are many brave warriors among the Indians, and I must first put them to death.\"  He was cunning as well"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],["title","The Book of Nature Myths (#5)"],["body","cruel, and he soon found a way to kill the warriors. He built some wigwams and made fires before them as if people lived in each one.  One day a hunter on his way home heard a baby crying in one of the wigwams. He went in, but he never came out again. Another day a hunter heard a child laughing. He went in, but he never came out again. So it was day after day. One hunter heard a woman talking, and went to see who it was; another heard a man calling to people in the other wigwams, and went to see who they were; and no one who once went into a wigwam ever came out.  One young brave had heard the voices, but he feared there was magic about them, and so he had never gone into the wigwams; but when he saw that his friends did not come back, he went to the wigwams and called, \"Where are all the people that I have heard talk and laugh?\"  \"Talk and laugh,\" said the cunning man mockingly.  \"Where are they? Do you know?\" cried the brave, and the cunning man called, \"Do you know?\" and laughed.  \"Whose voices have I heard?\"  \"Have I heard?\" mocked the cunning man.  \"I heard a baby cry.\"  \"Cry,\" said the cunning man.  \"Who is with you?\"  \"You.\"  Then the young brave was angry. He ran into the first wigwam, and there he found the man who had cried like a baby and talked in a voice like a woman's and made all the other sounds. The brave caught him by the leg and threw him down upon the earth.  \"It was you who cried and talked and laughed,\" he said. \"I heard your voice and now you are going to be punished for killing our braves. Where is my brother, and where are our friends?\"  \"How do I know?\" cried the man. \"Ask the sun or the moon or the fire if you will, but do not ask me;\" and all the time he was trying to pull the young brave into the flames.  \"I will ask the fire,\" said the brave. \"Fire, you are a good friend to us Indians. What has this cruel man done with our warriors?\"  The fire had no voice, so it could not answer, but it sprang as far away from the hunter as it could, and there where the flames had been he saw two stone arrowheads.  \"I know who owned the two arrowheads,\" said the brave. \"You have thrown my friends into your fire. Now I will do to you what you have done to them.\"  He threw the cunning man into the fire. His head burst into two pieces, and from between them a bird flew forth. Its voice was loud and clear, but it had no song of its own. It could only mock the songs of other birds, and that is why it is called the mocking-bird.     WHY THE TAIL OF THE FOX HAS A WHITE TIP.   \"I must have a boy to watch my sheep and my cows,\" thought an old woman, and so she went out to look for a boy. She looked first in the fields and then in the forest, but nowhere could she find a boy. As she was walking down the path to her home, she met a bear.  \"Where are you going?\" asked the bear.  \"I am looking for a boy to watch my cows and my sheep,\" she answered.  \"Will you have me?\"  \"Yes, if you know how to call my animals gently.\"  \"Ugh, ugh,\" called the bear. He tried to call softly, but he had always growled before, and now he could do nothing but growl.  \"No, no,\" said the old woman, \"your voice is too loud. Every cow in the field would run, and every sheep would hide, if you should growl like that. I will not have you.\"  Then the old woman went on till she met a wolf.  \"Where are you going, grandmother?\" he asked.  \"I am looking for a boy to watch my cows and my sheep,\" she answered.  \"Will you have me?\" asked the wolf.  \"Yes,\" she said, \"if you know how to call my animals gently.\"  \"Ho-y, ho-y,\" called the wolf.  \"Your voice is too high,\" said the old woman. \"My cows and my sheep would tremble whenever they heard it. I will not have you.\"  Then the old woman went on till she met a fox.  \"I am so glad to meet you,\" said the fox. \"Where are you going this bright morning?\"  \"I am going home now,\" she said, \"for I cannot find a boy to watch my cows and my sheep. The bear growls and the wolf calls in too high a voice. I do not know what I can do, for I am too old to watch cows and sheep.\"  \"Oh, no,\" said the cunning fox, \"you are not old, but any one as beautiful as you must not watch sheep in the fields. I shall be very glad to do the work for you if you will let me.\"  \"I know that my sheep will like you,\" said she.  \"And I know that I shall like them dearly,\" said the fox.  \"Can you call them gently, Mr. Fox?\" she asked.  \"Del-dal-halow, del-dal-halow,\" called the fox, in so gentle a voice that it was like a whisper.  \"That is good, Mr. Fox,\" said the old woman. \"Come home with me, and I will take you to the fields where my animals go.\"  Each day one of the cows or one of the sheep was gone when the fox came home at night. \"Mr. Fox, where is my cow?\" the old woman would ask, or, \"Mr. Fox, where is my sheep?\" and the fox would answer with a sorrowful look, \"The bear came out of the woods, and he has eaten it,\" or, \"The wolf came running through the fields, and he has eaten it.\"  The old woman was sorry to lose her sheep and her cows, but she thought, \"Mr. Fox must be even more sorry than I. I will go out to the field and carry him a drink of cream.\"  [Illustration]  She went to the field, and there stood the fox with the body of a sheep, for it was he who had killed and eaten every one that was gone. When he saw the old woman coming, he started to run away.  \"You cruel, cunning fox!\" she cried.  She had nothing to throw at him but the cream, so she threw that. It struck the tip of his tail, and from that day to this, the tip of the fox's tail has been as white as cream.     THE STORY OF THE FIRST FROG.   Once upon a time there was a man who had two children, a boy and a girl, whom he treated cruelly. The boy and the girl talked together one day, and the boy, Wah-wah-hoo, said to his sister, \"Dear little sister, are you happy with our father?\"  \"No,\" answered the girl, whose name was Hah-hah. \"He scolds me and beats me, and I can never please him.\"  \"He was angry with me this morning,\" said the boy, \"and he beat me till the blood came. See there!\"  \"Let us run away,\" said Hah-hah. \"The beasts and the birds will be good to us. They really love us, and we can be very happy together.\"  That night the two children ran away from their cruel father. They went far into the forest, and at last they found a wigwam in which no one lived.  When the father found that Wah-wah-hoo and his sister were gone, he was very unhappy. He went out into the forest to see if he could find them. \"If they would only come again,\" he said aloud, \"I would do everything I could to please them.\"  \"Do you think he tells the truth?\" asked the wolf.  \"I do not know,\" answered the mosquito. \"He never treated them well when they were with him.\"  \"Wolf,\" called the father, \"will you tell me where my children are?\"  Wah-wah-hoo had once told the wolf when a man was coming to shoot him, and so the wolf would not tell where they were.  \"Mosquito,\" said the father, \"where are my children?\"  Hah-hah had once helped the mosquito to go home when the wind was too strong for him, and so the mosquito would not tell.  For a long time Wah-wah-hoo and his sister were really happy in the forest, for there was no one to scold them and to beat them, but at last there was a cold, cold winter. All the earth was covered with snow. The animals had gone, and Wah-wah-hoo could find no food. Death came and bore away the gentle Hah-hah. Wah-wah-hoo sat alone in the gloomy wigwam wailing for his sister. Then in his sadness he threw himself down from a high mountain and was killed.  All this time the father had been looking for his children, and at last he saw his son lying at the foot of the mountain. Then he too wailed and cried aloud, for he was really sorry that he had treated them so cruelly. He was a magician, and he could make his son live, but he could not make him a boy again.  \"You shall be a frog,\" said he, \"and you shall make your home in the marsh with the reeds and the rushes. There you shall wail as loud as you will for your sister, and once every moon I will come and wail for her with you. I was cruel to you and to her, and so I must live alone in my gloomy wigwam.\"  Every summer night one can hear the frog in the marsh wailing for his dear sister Hah-hah. Sometimes a louder voice is heard, and that is the voice of the father wailing because he was so cruel.  [Illustration]     WHY THE RABBIT IS TIMID.   One night the moon looked down from the sky upon the people on the earth and said to herself, \"How sorrowful they look! I wish I knew what troubles them. The stars and I are never sad, and I do not see why men should be troubled.\" She listened closely, and she heard the people say, \"How happy we should be if death never came to us. Death is always before us.\"  The path of the moon lies across the sky, and she could not leave it to go to the earth, but she called the white rabbit and said, \"Rabbit, should you be afraid to go down to the earth?\"  \"No,\" answered the rabbit, \"I am not afraid.\"  \"The people on the earth are troubled because death is before them. Now will you go to them and whisper, 'The moon dies every night. You can see it go down into the darkness, but when another night comes, then the moon rises again,'--can you remember to tell them that?\"  \"Yes,\" said the rabbit, \"I will remember.\"  \"Say this,\" said the moon: \"'The moon dies, but the moon rises again, and so will you.'\"  The rabbit was so glad to go to the earth that he danced and leaped and sprang and frolicked, but when he tried to tell the people what the moon had said, he could not remember, and he said, \"The moon says that she dies and will not rise again, and so you will die and will not rise again.\"  The moon saw that the people were still troubled, and she called the rabbit and asked what he had said to them.  \"I said that as you die and do not rise, so they too will die and not rise,\" said the rabbit.  \"You did not try to remember, and you must be punished,\" said the moon, and she fired"]]]
