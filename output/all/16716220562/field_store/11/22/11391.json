The farmer put more wood on the fire, the sticks being placed upright, in which manner they throw out much more heat, and a sudden blaze filled the room with a bright glow.  I like these farmers' fireplaces. They are always built of masonry in one of the corners of the room. The platform is about one foot above the floor and generally four or five feet square, with a crane to hang kettles or cooking pots on; and when only the embers remain a trap in the chimney is closed, to prevent the heat from getting out.  The wife put the coffee kettle over the fire, and one of the daughters kept herself busy with the coffee mill.  In the mean time my driver came in and was welcomed, and they asked him about me. When they heard I was from America they shouted, \"From America!\" and when they had recovered from their astonishment, the husband said, \"I have a brother in America.\" The wife said, \"I have a sister and two nieces in America,\" and tears came into her eyes. They did also into mine; there was at once a bond of union between us. To them the United States was so far away, and I was so far from home. They often thought of their folks and friends who had emigrated to our land.  The family was composed of three daughters and two sons. The girls had fair hair and large blue eyes, and were strong enough to be victorious in a wrestling contest with big boys.  The sons helped their father on the farm. The names of the girls were: Engla Matilda, Serlotta Maria, and Kajsa Maria; the mother Lovisa Kristina; the father Carl; the sons were Nils and Erik.  The big room was strange-looking. In one corner was the large open fireplace. A large hand loom, with an unfinished piece of thick coarse woollen stuff or cloth which was being woven, was in another corner. Near by were three spinning-wheels; upon one was flax and on the two others wool. On the walls were shelves for plates, saucers, glasses, mugs, dishes, etc.  The ceiling was about eight or nine feet in height. There was an opening in it which was accessible by a ladder. I wanted very much to know what there was above. Along the walls were several wooden benches like sofas, upon which the people sat. A large wooden table with wooden benches and two or three wooden chairs completed the furniture. There was a trap-door in the middle of the floor, leading into the cellar; and as this never froze, the potatoes and other vegetables, the butter and cheese, and ale were kept there.  By the side of the living-room were two doors leading to two small rooms. One had shelves for pails containing milk and the churn to make butter with. In the other room were a number of painted chests, with the initials of the owners upon them, and lots of dresses hanging along the walls, and a bed.  The husband suddenly disappeared through the trap-door and soon came back with potatoes and a big piece of bacon. The sight roused my appetite. The potatoes were washed and boiled, and the pan was put over the fire and the bacon cut into slices and fried.  The meal was put on a very clean table without tablecloth, and then the driver and I were bidden to sit down and eat. Our coffee cups were filled to the brim, and every two or three minutes we were urged to eat more, to drink more coffee. How good were the potatoes! How good were the bacon and the cheese and the butter! I thought that that meal tasted better than any I had eaten in my life.  [Illustration: \"The husband suddenly disappeared through the trap-door and soon came back with potatoes and a big piece of bacon.\"]  When we stopped, for we had eaten to our hearts' content, with one voice husband and wife said: \"Eat more, eat more;\" and before I knew it, our two cups were filled for the third time, and more potatoes and bacon were put on our plates. They all seemed so happy to see us eat with such an appetite.  The dear farmers of Norway and Sweden were always so hospitable and kind to me. Do not wonder that I love them. No one in these countries has ever tried to do me harm or ever robbed me of a penny.  After our meal we stretched our legs before the open fireplace. I was more happy than if I had been in a splendid palace. I forgot the snow and storm. How nice it was to be in front of a fireplace when the storm was raging!  The farmer put more sticks on the fire. The room was in a perfect blaze of light. Gradually the fire died out, and when there were only embers left he stirred them with the poker until not a particle of flame appeared, and when there was no danger of fumes he shut the trap so that no heat would escape through the chimney. The time of going to bed had come.  I was wondering all the time where we were all going to sleep, for there were no beds in sight. \"Perhaps,\" said I to myself, \"we are all going up the ladder to sleep upstairs. Perhaps we are going to sleep on the floor.\" But I did not see any mattress, sheepskins, or home-made woollen blankets anywhere--and these when together would have made a big pile.  Suddenly I saw the daughters come to the bench-like sofas and pull out a drawer out of each sofa. These were to be the beds. They were filled with hay, with two sheepskins on the top to be used as sheets and blankets.  These sliding boxes could be made of different widths, according to the number of occupants that were to sleep in the same bed.  I said to myself, \"Strange-looking beds these,\" when one of the girls said, \"Sometimes we can squeeze five or six into one of these beds.\" I was glad I was not going to be the fifth or sixth, for we should have been packed like sardines or herring.  When everything was ready the boys ascended the ladder and went to sleep upstairs. A bed was given me, and the rest of the family slept in their own, two girls sleeping in one bed. Then we bade each other good-night. How warm and comfortable were my sheepskins!  In the middle of the night I heard the howling of the wind; a terrific gale was blowing. How thankful I felt to be under shelter! Early in the morning, while still in bed, I was startled by the shouts of one of the boys: \"Father, we are snowed in! We cannot get out of the house!\"  \"Are we snowed in?\" I exclaimed.  \"Yes,\" shouted the two boys at the same time. I jumped out of bed to find out if it was a joke. It was true!  The boys were delighted, and said with great glee: \"The wind has filled all the trenches with snow. We shall have to get out through the chimney. What fun that will be!\"  I thought also that it would be fun. I had never got out of a house through the chimney, and I was anxious now to do it, for I might never get another chance.  Everybody was now out of bed. \"It is good that the cellar is full of potatoes and that a sack of the Russian flour has not been touched, so we have plenty of food,\" said the father. \"Besides, there is bacon, cheese, and butter,\" said one of the girls. Another added, \"We have inside firewood for three days without being obliged to go to the woodshed.\"  The farmer said, \"There has never been so much snow during living man's memory. Old Pehr, my neighbor, whom I went to see yesterday, and who is eighty-four years old, said that he never remembered such a snowstorm.\"  I thought of the poor horse that had worked so hard to bring us here. \"Boys, we must make the way clear to the stable and feed your horse and mine,\" I said. \"Let us hurry and go out through the chimney.\"  \"They are all right,\" said the father; \"I left so much fodder before them that they will not starve even if we could not reach them to-day.\"  \"Dear horses, how useful to us,\" I said. \"I often wonder that there are some men so cruel and so hard-hearted as to beat the poor animals when they have not strength enough to carry the heavy load put upon them, or to make them work when they are ill. It is a good thing that there are societies in many countries for the prevention of cruelty to horses and other animals.\"  \"It is so,\" said they all with one voice; \"we do not know of any one among our neighbors who is unkind to his horse. We do not know what we should do if our poor horse were ill.\"  \"Yes,\" said one of the girls, \"when he was a colt our horse used to put his head through the door to get pieces of potatoes and apples. We love him!\"  The ladder was fetched and put into the chimney. There was no trouble about that, for the chimney was so wide. The shovels were brought in. There were three of them. Then Nils ascended the ladder, and afterwards crept to the top. This was a hard job. Erik followed, and succeeded also in reaching the roof. Then we heard voices coming down the chimney.  \"Father,\" called the boys, \"tie the shovels to the cord we drop.\" They had taken the precaution of carrying a cord with them. The shovels were hauled up.  [Illustration: \"The boys got hold of my hands and pulled me through.\"]  Then my turn came to go through. I got into the chimney first, and saw the faces of Nils and Erik peeping down. \"It is all right. Come on, Herr Paul.\" I ascended the ladder, then crept up the rest of the chimney. The boys got hold of my hands and pulled me through. What a sight! I was black with soot. Nils and Erik were likewise. We gave three great hurrahs. We shouted through the chimney to the folks with great glee, \"Be patient, you will get out by and by.\"  We worked with a will, and succeeded in clearing the trench leading to the door, and there was a great shout of joy when it opened. Then the girls came out and joined us in making the way clear to the barn, to the two horses, five cows, and twelve sheep. When we opened the door of the barn the horses neighed, the cows lowed, and the sheep baaed. It was a fine concert of voices. They were glad to see us. It was their way of bidding us welcome.  Returning to the house we cleared the windows, then the well, of snow. The well was surrounded by a mass of ice. We drew water and gave a good drink"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22727"],["title","The Land of the Long Night (#5)"],["body","the horses and the other animals. The girls milked the cows, and gave fresh fodder to all.  When our work was done we were all as hungry as the wolves are in winter, when they have had no food for days.  In the mean time the mother had prepared a big meal for us, and we entered the house. We were ready to do justice to the food. The potatoes and the bacon quickly disappeared. After the meal we cleared the other windows of snow, and made passages to them, so that light might come through. It was a hard day's work all round!  When supper time came we seated ourselves before a big wooden bowl of porridge called \"gröd,\" made from barley meal. On each side were two wooden bowls filled with sour milk. We ate with wooden spoons from the same dish. There were no plates for supper, and once in a while we took a spoonful of sour milk to help the gröd go down. I always enjoy eating with wooden or horn spoons.  I went to sleep in the loft this time. I wanted to be near Nils and Erik. They were fine boys, and we were friends. Did we not sleep well that night! We did not awake until their father came to shake us.  \"There is nothing like shovelling snow to make one sleep,\" we all said, after we awoke.  The next day the women were very busy a great part of the day. Engla spun flax on her spinning-wheel, Serlotta carded wool, and Maria wove a thick woollen cloth to be turned into garments for three new suits for her father and two brothers, while the mother knitted woollen stockings.  I remained three days on this farm. During that time the snow had packed and the snow-ploughs followed by the rollers had made their reappearance on the highroad. It was time for me to leave, for I was in a hurry, and I had to travel nearly nine hundred miles before I could reach Nordkyn.  When I left I put some money into the hands of the wife, and when she felt it in her hand she said, \"No, no; to be paid for giving food and shelter to a person who is overtaken by a storm, is a shame. What would God think of me for doing that? No, no;\" she said again, with more earnestness.  I succeeded at last, after much insistence, in overcoming her scruples and making her take it; and once more I was on the road leading northward.  Travelling was still very difficult. I came late to a post station where I intended to spend the night, for I was very tired. The place was filled with travellers and all the beds were taken. Men slept on benches, on the top of the table, and on the floor. These were travellers who had been detained on the road and were once more on their way southward.  I saw a space on the floor between two men--just enough for me to get in--and I quietly stepped over three fellows who were fast asleep and made for the empty place, and went to sleep in my fur coat.  The next morning I was once more on the long and tedious road leading north, towards \"The Land of the Long Night.\" That afternoon I reached the little town of Umeå.  The days had become shorter and shorter. The sun was very low at noon and was not above the horizon more than one hour. As I travelled further north I was surprised to notice that the snow diminished rapidly. I had left the great \"Snow Land,\" or snow belt, which seemed to be between 62 and 64 degrees north, behind me.  After changing horses at several post stations I came to the little towns of Skellefteå, Piteå, and Luleå, and at last I reached Haparanda, situated at the extreme northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia, at the mouth of the Torne river, the most northern town in Sweden.  At Haparanda I had driven about seven hundred and forty miles from Stockholm, and over twenty-five hundred miles since I had left the mountains of Norway. I was only forty-one miles south of the Arctic Circle, which is the most southerly part of \"The Land of the Long Night.\"     CHAPTER IV   GOOD ADVICE FROM THE PEOPLE OF HAPARANDA.--WARNED AGAINST STILL COLDER      WEATHER.--DIFFERENT COSTUME NEEDED.--DRESSED AS A LAPLANDER.--LAPP      GRASS FOR FEET PROTECTION.   I had hardly arrived in Haparanda, when the leading people of the place came to welcome me. I was not unknown to several of them, on account of some of my books which have been translated into Swedish; and they were my friends at once.  They heard with astonishment that I intended to go further north. They looked serious and remained silent for a while. \"We will give you letters of introduction to our friends,\" they said; \"but after a time you will be too far north, where we do not know anybody. You will find only Finlanders and Laplanders until you come to the Arctic shores of Norway.\"  After saying this they began to fill their big meerschaum pipes with tobacco and lighted them, and smoke came out as if from a small funnel. They gave puff after puff and were again silent; the wrinkles over their foreheads showed that they were thoughtful and anxious.  One friend said: \"The country which lies between the head of the Gulf of Bothnia and Nordkyn, the most northern part of the mainland in Europe, is very stormy in winter, the winds blow with terrific force, and midway between the shores of the Baltic and the extremity of the land snow is also very deep. It is a roadless land.\"  When I heard this, I said to myself: \"Is 'The Land of the Long Night' 'Snow Land' as well?\" Then I thought of the great \"Snow Land\" I had left behind me, and how hard travelling had been, and I wondered if it would be worse in this second \"Snow Land.\" If it was, then I had a hard task ahead of me.  Another friend said, \"This big overcoat of yours will never do in the country you are going to. These long boots you wear will not be serviceable.\"  \"Yes,\" they all said together. \"This costume of yours will be unmanageable on account of the wind. You cannot travel in 'The Land of the Long Night' dressed as you are. You must dress like a Laplander. Theirs is the only costume that can stand the weather you are to encounter, the only one in which you will be able to get into their small sleighs, and face the fierce wind and the intense cold.\"  \"Remember,\" said another of my new friends, \"that you are going to travel over a roadless country covered with snow, the reindeer will be your horse, and you will not be able to go about without going on skees, for at every step one sinks deep into the snow.\"  Then another added, to reassure me: \"Our country is a country of laws; we have order, and hate lawlessness. You will feel safe among the people. You will find where the country is uninhabited, or where the farms are very wide apart, houses or farms of refuge where you can get food and reindeer to take you further on. These are post stations where you can remain until the weather is good. There you are as safe as among us.\"  I thanked them for all the advice and information they gave me and said that I would follow their admonition in regard to my dress. They then bade me good-night. The next day I remembered what my friends had said to me the day before, and with one of them I went to get the garments worn by the Lapps.  I bought two \"kaptor.\"[1] These are also called \"pesh.\" They are long blouses reaching down to the knee or below, made of reindeer skins, with fur attached; with a narrow aperture for the head to pass through, and fitting closely round the neck.  [1] Plural form. Singular, \"kapta.\"  One of the kaptor was much larger than the other, for in case of intense cold one is worn beneath the other with the fur inside, and the outside one with the fur outside.  I got a pair of trousers made of skin from the legs of the reindeer, of which the fur though short is considered the warmest part of the animal, as it protects his legs, which are always in the snow. The provisions of nature are wonderful!  There are no openings to the Lapp trousers, so that no cold air can reach the body. They are fastened round the waist by a string and are tied above the ankle. There the fur is removed and the leather is made very soft so that it may go round the shoe.  I got two pairs of shoes made of the skin of the reindeer near the hoof, with the fur outside. This part is said to be the warmest part of the whole skin. All the Lapp shoes are sharp pointed, the point turning upward. They are bound at the seams with red flannel. The upper part fits above the ankle. They were large enough for me to wear two pairs of thick, home-knitted stockings and Lapp grass to surround the foot everywhere without pinching it. Long narrow bands of bright color are attached to them. These bands are wound around the legs above the ankles, thus preventing snow and wind from penetrating. These shoes can only be used in cold weather when the snow is crisp, and are especially adapted for skees, as they are pointed and have no heels.  I procured also four pairs of mittens, one made of the skin of the reindeer near the hoof, another of wool with a sort of down, the third of cow's hair, and the fourth of goat's hair; the two latter are the warmest, but they are very perishable.  I also got two pairs of very thick home-knitted stockings. These were of wool. I succeeded in getting two other pairs made of cow's hair, and another pair made of goat's hair, and I was especially cautioned to handle them gently when I put them on or took them off--likewise with the mittens of goat's and cow's hair.  I also got a vest made of soft reindeer skin to put on over my underwear, and two sets of thick underwear of homespun, for these are much warmer than those that are made by machinery.  I added to my outfit one pair of long and another shorter pair of boots for wet weather in the spring, when the snow is damp and watery. These boots were made of the skin of the lower part of the hind legs of reindeer, the fur being scraped off. The leather is black and it is prepared in such a way as to exclude water or moisture. They were rubbed with a composition of reindeer fat and tar.  Then I bought a square Lapp cap, the top filled with eider down. The rim could be turned down to"]]]
