Investigation of the products for yield of furfural, gave 9 p.ct. of this aldehyde showing the presence of celluloses, other than the normal type.  _Conclusions._--The subjoined table gives the mean numerical results for yield of end-product or 'cellulose' by the various methods. In the case of the 'celluloses' the results are those of the further action of the several processes on the end-product of a previous process.                         |                 Methods                        | F.

Those which may be carried out in a reasonably short time are deficient in two directions: (1) they yield a 'cellulose' containing more or less oxycellulose; (2) the celluloses themselves are attacked under the conditions of treatment, and the end product or cellulose merely represents a particular and at the same time variable equilibrium, as between the resistance of the cellulose and the attack of the reagents employed; this attack being by no means confined to the non-cellulose constituents. Schulze's method appears to give the nearest approximation to the 'actual cellulose' of the raw material.         *       *       *       *       *  (p. 8) ~SOLUTIONS OF CELLULOSE~--(1) ~ZINC CHLORIDE.~--To prepare a homogeneous solution of cellulose by means of the neutral chloride, a prolonged digestion at or about 100° with the concentrated reagent is required. The dissolution of the cellulose is not a simple phenomenon, but is attended with hydrolysis and a certain degree of condensation. The latter result is evidenced by the formation of furfural, the former by the presence of soluble carbohydrates in the solution obtained by diluting the original solution and filtering from the reprecipitated cellulose. The authors have observed that in carefully conducted experiments cotton cellulose may be dissolved in the reagent, and reprecipitated with a loss of only 1 p.ct. in weight. This, however, is a 'net' result, and leaves undetermined the degree of hydration of the recovered cellulose as of hydrolysis of the original to groups of lower molecular weights. Bronnert finds that a previous hydration of the cellulose--e.g. by the process of alkaline mercerisation and removal of the alkali by washing--enables the zinc chloride to effect its dissolution by digestion in the cold. (U.S. patent, 646,799/1900. See also p. 59.)  _Industrial applications._--(a) _Vulcanised fibre_ is prepared by treating paper with four times its weight of the concentrated aqueous solution (65-75° B.), and in the resulting gelatinised condition is worked up into masses, blocks, sheets, &c., of any required thickness. The washing of these masses to remove the zinc salt is a very lengthy operation.  To render the product waterproof the process of nitration is sometimes superadded [D.R.P. 3181/1878]. Further details of manufacture are given in Prakt. Handbuch d. Papierfabrikation, p. 1703 [C. Hofmann].  (b) _Calico-printing._--The use of the solution as a thickener or colour vehicle, more especially as a substitute for albumen in pigment styles, was patented by E. B. Manby, but the process has not been industrially developed [E.P. 10,466/1894].  (c) _Artificial silk._--This is a refinement of the earlier applications of the solution in spinning cellulose threads for conversion into carbon filaments for electrical glow-lamps. This section will be found dealt with on p. 59.  (p. 13) (2) ~Cuprammonium solution.~--The application of the solution of cellulose in cuprammonium to the production of a fine filament in continuous length, 'artificial silk,' has been very considerably studied and developed in the period 1897-1900, as evidenced by the series of patents of Fremery and Urban, Pauly, Bronnert, and others. The subject will also be found dealt with on p. 58.         *       *       *       *       *  (p. 15) ~Reactions of cellulose with iodine.~--In a recent paper, F. Mylius deals with the reaction of starch and cellulose with iodine, pointing out that the blue colouration depends upon the presence of water and iodides. In absence of the latter, and therefore in presence of compounds which destroy or absorb hydriodic acid--e.g. iodic acid--there results a _brown_ addition product. The products in question have the characteristics of _solid solutions_ of the halogen. (Berl. Ber. 1895, 390.)  (24) ~Mercerisation~--Notwithstanding the enormous recent developments in the industrial application of the mercerising reaction, there have been no noteworthy contributions to the theoretical aspects of the subject. The following abstract gives an outline of the scope of an important technical work on the subject.   DIE MERCERISATION DER BAUMWOLLE.  PAUL GARDNER (Berlin: 1898. J. Springer).  ~THE MERCERISATION OF COTTON.~  This monograph of some 150 pages is chiefly devoted to the patent literature of the subject. The chemical and physical modifications of the cotton substance under the action of strong alkaline lye, were set forth by Mercer in 1844-5, and there has resulted from subsequent investigations but little increase in our knowledge of the fundamental facts. The treatment was industrially developed by Mercer in certain directions, chiefly (1) for preparing webs of cloth required to stand considerable strain, and (2) for producing crêpon effects by local or topical action of the alkali. But the results achieved awakened but a transitory interest, and the matter passed into oblivion; so much so, indeed, that a German patent [No. 30,966] was granted in 1884 to the Messrs. Depouilly for crêpon effects due to the differential shrinkage of fabrics under mercerisation, by processes and treatments long previously described by Mercer. Such effects have had a considerable vogue in recent years, but it was not until the discovery of the lustreing effect resulting from the association of the mercerising actions with the condition of strain or tension of the yarn or fabric that the industry in 'mercerised' goods was started on the lines which have led to the present colossal development. The merit of this discovery is now generally recognised as belonging to Thomas and Prevost of Crefeld, notwithstanding that priority of patent right belongs to the English technologist, H. A. Lowe.  The author critically discusses the grounds of the now celebrated patent controversy, arising out of the conflict of the claims of German patent 85,564/1895 of the former, and English patent 4452/1890 of the latter. The author concludes that Lowe's specification undoubtedly describes the lustreing effect of mercerising in much more definite terms than that of Thomas and Prevost. These inventors, on the other hand, realised the effect industrially, which Lowe certainly failed to do, as evidenced by his allowing the patent to lapse. As an explanation of his failure, the author suggests that Lowe did not sufficiently extend his observations to goods made from Egyptian and other long-stapled cottons, in which class only are the full effects of the added lustre obtained.  Following these original patents are the specifications of a number of inventions which, however, are of insignificant moment so far as introducing any essential variation of the mercerising treatment.  The third section of the work describes in detail the various mechanical devices which have been patented for carrying out the treatment on yarn and cloth.  The fourth section deals with the fundamental facts underlying the process and effects summed up in the term 'mercerisation.' These are as follows:--  (a) Although all forms of fibrous celluloses are similarly affected by strong alkaline solutions, it is only the Egyptian and other long-stapled cottons--i.e. the goods made from them--which under the treatment acquire the special high lustre which ranks as 'silky.' Goods made from American cottons acquire a certain 'finish' and lustre, but the effects are not such as to have an industrial value--i.e. a value proportional to the cost of treatment.  (b) The lustre is determined by exposing the goods to strong tension, either when under the action of the alkali, or subsequently, but only when the cellulose is in the special condition of hydration which is the main chemical effect of the mercerising treatment.  (c) The degree of tension required is approximately that which opposes the shrinkage in dimensions, otherwise determined by the action of the alkali. The following table exhibits the variations of shrinkage of Egyptian when mercerised without tension, under varying conditions as regards the essential factors of the treatment--viz. (1) concentration of the alkaline lye, (2) temperature, and (3) duration of action (the latter being of subordinate moment):--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22620"],["title","Researches on Cellulose, 1895-1900 (#5)"],["body","|               |             |             |                    |      | | Concentration |             |             |                    |      | | of lye (NaOH) |    5°B.     |    10°B.    |        15°B        | 25°B | |               |   |    |    |   |    |    |      |      |      |      | | Duration of   |   |    |    |   |    |    |      |      |      |      | | action in     | 1 | 10 | 30 | 1 | 10 | 30 |   1  |  10  |  30  |      | | minutes       |   |    |    |   |    |    |      |      |      |      | |               |   |    |    |   |    |    |      |      |      |      | | Temperatures  |   Percentage shrinkages (Egyptian yarns) as under:--  | | as under:--   |   |    |    |   |    |    |      |      |      |      | |  2°           | 0 |  0 |  0 | 1 |  1 |  1 | 12.2 | 15.2 | 15.8 | 19.2 | | 18°           | 0 |  0 |  0 | 0 |  0 |  0 |  8.0 |  8.8 | 11.8 | 19.8 | | 30°           | 0 |  0 |  0 | 0 |  0 |  0 |  4.6 |  4.6 |  6.0 | 19.0 | | 80°           | 0 |  0 |  0 | 0 |  0 |  0 |  3.5 |  3.5 |  9.8 | 13.4 | |_______________|___|____|____|___|____|____|______|______|______|______|  _______________________________________________________________________ |               |             |                    |                    | | Concentration |             |                    |                    | | of lye (NaOH) |     25°B    |        30°B        |        35°B        | |               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | | Duration of   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | | action in     |  10  |  30  |   1  |  10  |  30  |   1  |  10  |  30  | | minutes       |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | |               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | | Temperatures  |   Percentage shrinkages (Egyptian yarns) as under:--  | | as under:--   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | |  2°           | 19.8 | 21.5 | 22.7 | 22.7 | 22.7 | 24.2 | 24.5 | 24.7 | | 18°           | 20.1 | 21.0 | 21.2 | 22.0 | 22.3 | 23.5 | 23.8 | 24.7 | | 30°           | 19.5 | 19.0 | 18.5 | 19.5 | 19.8 | 20.7 | 21.0 | 21.1 | | 80°           | 13.7 | 14.2 | 15.0 | 15.1 | 15.5 | 15.0 | 15.2 | 15.4 | |_______________|______|______|______|______|______|______|______|______|  The more important general indications of the above results are--(1) The mercerisation action commences with a lye of 10°B., and increases with increased strength of the lye up to a maximum at 35°B. There is, however, a relatively slight increase of action with the increase of caustic soda from 30-40°B. (2) For optimum action the temperature should not exceed 15-20°C. (3) The duration of action is of proportionately less influence as the concentration of the lye increases. As the maximum effect is attained the action becomes practically instantaneous, the only condition affecting it being that of penetration--i.e. actual contact of cellulose and alkali.  (d) The question as to whether the process of 'mercerisation' involves chemical as well as physical effects is briefly discussed. The author is of opinion that, as the degree of lustre obtained varies with the different varieties of cotton, the differentiation is occasioned by differences in chemical constitution of these various cottons. The influence of the chemical factors is also emphasised by the increased dyeing capacity of the mercerised goods, which effect, moreover, is independent of those conditions of strain or tension under mercerisation which determine lustre. It is found in effect that with a varied range of dye stuffs a given shade is produced with from 10 to 30 p.ct. less colouring matter than is required for the ordinary, i.e. unmercerised, goods.  In reference to the constants of strength and elasticity, Buntrock gives the following results of observations upon a 40^{5} twofold yarn, five threads of 50 cm. length being taken for each test(Prometheus, 1897, p. 690): (a) the original yarn broke under a load of 1440 grms.; (b) after mercerisation without tension the load required was 2420 grms.; (c) after mercerisation under strain, 1950 grms. Mercerisation, therefore, increases the strength of the yarn from 30 to 66 p.ct., the increase being lessened proportionately to the strain accompanying mercerisation. _Elasticity_, as measured by the extension under the breaking load, remains about the same in yarns mercerised under strain, but when allowed to shrink under mercerisation there is an increase of 30-40 p.ct. over the original.  The _change of form_ sustained by the individual fibres has been studied by H. Lange [Farberzeitung, 1898, 197-198], whose microphotographs of the cotton fibres, both in length and cross-section, are reproduced. In general terms, the change is from the flattened riband of the original fibre to a cylindrical tube with much diminished and rounded central canal. The effect of strain under mercerisation is chiefly seen in the contour of the surface, which is smooth, and the obliteration at intervals of the canal. Hence the increased transparency and more complete reflection of the light from the surface, and the consequent approximation to the optical properties of the silk fibre.  The work concludes with a section devoted to a description of the various practical systems of mercerisation of yarns in general practice in Germany, and an account of the methods adopted in dyeing the mercerised yarns.   RESEARCHES ON MERCERISED COTTON.  A. FRAENKEL and P. FRIEDLAENDER (Mitt. k.-k. Techn. Gew. Mus., Wien, 1898, 326).  The authors, after investigation, are inclined to attribute the lustre of mercerised cotton to the absence of the cuticle, which is destroyed and removed in the process, partly by the chemical action of the alkali, and partly by the stretching at one or other stage of the process. The authors have investigated the action of alcoholic solutions of soda also. The lustre effects are not obtained unless the action of water is associated.  In conclusion, the authors give the following particulars of breaking strains and elasticity:--  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Treatment                 | Experiments | Breaking strain |  Elasticity --------------------------------------------------------------------------                           |             |                 |  Elongation                           |             |     Grammes     |  in mm.                           |             |                 | Cotton unmercerised.      |       1     |       360       |   20                           |       2     |       356       |   20                           |       3     |       360       |   22                           |             |                 | Mercerised with           |             |                 |   Soda 35°B.              |       1     |       530       |   44                           |       2     |       570       |   40                           |       3     |       559       |   35                           |             |                 |   Alcoholic soda 10 p.ct. |       1     |       645       |   24     cold                  |       2     |       600       |   27                           |       3     |       610       |   33                           |             |                 |   Alcoholic soda 10 p.ct. |       5     |       740       |   33     hot                   |       2     |       730       |   38                           |       3     |       690       |   30 --------------------------------------------------------------------------  FOOTNOTES:  [2] This and other similar references are to the matter of the original volume (1895).     SECTION II. SYNTHETICAL DERIVATIVES--SULPHOCARBONATES AND ESTERS   (p. 25) ~Cellulose sulphocarbonate.~--Further investigations of the reaction of formation as well as the various reactions of decomposition of the compound, have not contributed any essential modification or development of the subject as originally described in the author's first communications. A large amount of experimental matter has been accumulated in view of the ultimate contribution of the results to the general theory of colloidal solutions. But viscose is a complex product and essentially variable, through its pronounced tendency to progressive decomposition with reversion of the cellulose to its insoluble and uncombined condition. The solution for this reason does not lend itself to exact measurement of its physical constants such as might elucidate in some measure the progressive molecular aggregation of the cellulose in assuming spontaneously the solid (hydrate) form. Reserving the discussion of these points, therefore, we confine ourselves to recording results which further elucidate special points.  _Normal and other celluloses._--We may certainly use the sulphocarbonate reaction as a means of defining a normal cellulose. As already pointed out, cotton cellulose passes quantitatively through the cycle of treatments involved in solution as sulphocarbonate and decomposition of the solution with regeneration as structureless or amorphous cellulose (hydrate).  Analysis of this cellulose shows a fall of carbon percentage from 44.4 to 43.3, corresponding with a change in composition from C_{6}H_{10}O_{5} to 4C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}.H_{2}O. The partial hydrolysis affects the whole molecule, and is limited to this effect, whereas, in the case of celluloses of other types, there is a fractionation of the mass, a portion undergoing a further hydrolysis to compounds of lower molecular weight and permanently soluble. Thus in the case of the wood celluloses the percentage recovered from solution as viscose is from 93 to 95 p.ct. It is evident that these celluloses are not homogeneous. A similar conclusion results from the presence of furfural-yielding compounds with the observation that the hydrolysis to soluble derivatives mainly affects these derivatives. In"]]]
