Dick made an easy diplomatic reply.  He knew that Conway merely wished to be unpleasant, but Dick was of a very good nature, and he was particularly averse just then to quarreling with anybody.  He was too full of the glory of living.  Instead, he offered some of the antelope steaks to Conway, who churlishly accepted them, and that night he broiled others for Albert and himself, dividing the rest among the men.  Albert found antelope steak tender and juicy, and he ate with an increasing appetite.  Dick noted the increase with pleasure.  \"I wish I could go out and kill antelope,\" said Albert.  Dick laughed cheerfully.  \"Kill antelope,\" he said.  \"Why, Al, in six months you'll be taking a grizzly bear by the neck and choking him to death with your two hands.\"  \"Wish I could believe it,\" said Albert.  But Dick went to sleep early that night, and slept peacefully without dreams or visions, and the next morning the train resumed its sanguine march.  They were still ascending, and the character of the country continued to improve.  Bunch grass steadily grew thicker and buffalo chips were numerous.  The heat in the middle of the day was still great, but the air was so dry and pure that it was not oppressive.  Albert dismounted from the wagon, and walked for several miles by the side of his brother.  \"Shouldn't be surprised if we saw buffalo,\" said Dick.  \"Heard 'em talking about it in the train.  Bright Sun says these are favorite grazing grounds, and there's still a lot of buffalo scattered about the plains.\"  Albert showed excitement.  \"A buffalo herd!\" he exclaimed.  \"Do you think it can really happen, Dick?  I never thought I'd see such a thing!  I hope it'll come true!\"  It came true much sooner than Albert hoped.  Scarcely a half hour after he spoke, Bright Sun, who was at the head of the column, stopped his pony and pointed to indistinct tiny shadows just under the horizon.  \"Buffalo!\" he said tersely, and after a moment's pause he added: \"A great herd comes!\"  Dick and Albert were on foot then, but they heard his words and followed his pointing finger with the deepest interest.  The tiny black shadows seemed to come out of the horizon as if they stepped from a wall.  They grew in size and number, and all the west was filled with their forms.  The train resumed its march, bending off under the guidance of Bright Sun a little toward the west, and it was obvious that the herd would pass near.  Dick and Albert rejoiced, because they wished to see the buffaloes at close quarters, and Dick was hoping also for a shot.  Others, too, in the train, although their minds were set on gold, began to turn their attention now to the herd.  The sport and the fresh meat alike would be welcome.  It was Dick's impulse to mount his horse and gallop away again, gun in hand, but he made a supreme conquest over self and remained.  He remembered Albert's longing words about the antelope, his wish that he, too, tireless, might be able to pursue the game.  Dick remained quietly by his brother's side.  The whole train stopped presently at Conway's order on the crest of a swell, and drew itself up in a circle.  Many of the men were now mounted and armed for an attack upon the herd, but at the suggestion of Bright Sun they waited a little, until the opportunity should become more convenient.  \"It is a big herd,\" said Bright Sun;  \"perhaps the biggest that one can ever see now.\"  It certainly seemed immense to Dick and Albert.  The great animals came on in an endless stream from the blue wall of the horizon.  The vast procession steadily broadened and lengthened and it moved with unceasing step toward the south.  The body of it was solid black, with figures which at the distance blended into one mass, but on the flanks hung stragglers, lawless old bulls or weaklings, and outside there was a fringe of hungry wolves, snapping and snarling, and waiting a chance to drag down some failing straggler.  Far over the plain spread the herd, thousands and tens of thousands, and the earth shook with their tread.  Confused, bellowings and snortings arose, and the dust hung thick.  Dick and Albert stared with intent eyes at the wonderful scene. The herd was drawing nearer and nearer. It would pass only a few hundred yards from the crest on which the train stood.  Already the hunters were shouting to one another and galloping away, but Dick did not stir from Albert's side.  Albert's eyes were expanded, and the new color in his face deepened.  His breath cam in the short, quick fashion of one who is excited.  He suddenly turned to his brother.  \"The men are off!  Why aren't you with them Dick?\" he exclaimed.  \"I thought I wouldn't go,\" replied Dick evasively.  \"There'll be enough without me.\"  Albert stared.  Not hunt buffalo when one could.  It was unbelievable.  Then he comprehended.  But he would not have it that way!  It was noble of Dick, but it should not be so for a moment.  He cried out, a note of anxiety in this voice:  \"No, Dick, you shall not say here with me!  My time will come later on!  Jump on your horse, Dick, and join 'em!  I won't forgive you if you don't!\"  Dick saw that Albert was in earnest, and he knew that it would be better for them both now if he should go.  \"All right, Al!\" he cried, \"I'll pick out a good fat one.\"  He jumped on his horse and in a moment was galloping at full speed over the plain toward the great herd which now rushed on, black and thundering.  Dick heard shots already from those who had preceded him, and the exultant shouts of the men mingled with the roar of mighty tramplings.  But it was not all triumph for the men, few of whom were experienced.  Two or three had been thrown by shying horses, and with difficulty escaped being trodden to death under the feet of the herd.  The herd itself was so immense that it did not notice these few wasps on a distant flank, and thundered steadily on southward.  Dick's own horse, frightened by such a tremendous sight, shied and jumped, but the boy had a sure seat and brought him around again.  Dick himself was somewhat daunted by the aspect of the herd.  If he and his hose got in the way, they would go down forever, as surely as if engulfed by an avalanche.  The horse shied again and made a mighty jump, as a huge bull, red-eyed and puffing, charged by.  Dick, who was holding his rifle in one hand, slipped far over, and with great difficulty regained his balance on the horse's back.  When he was secure again, he turned his mount and galloped along for some distance on the flank of the herd, seeking a suitable target for his bullet.  The effect was dizzying.  So many thousands were rushing beside him that the shifting panorama made him wink his eyes rapidly.  Vast clouds of dust floated about, now and then enveloping him, and that made him wink his eyes, too.  But he continued, nevertheless, to seek for his target a fat cow. Somehow he didn't seem to see anything just then but old bulls. They were thick on the flanks of the herd either as stragglers or protectors, and Dick was afraid to press in among them in his search for the cow.  His opportunity came at last.  A young cow, as fat as one could wish, was thrown on the outside by some movement of the herd, caught, as it were, like a piece of driftwood in an eddy, and Dick instantly fired at her.  She staggered and went down, but at the same instant a huge, shaggy bull careened against Dick and his horse.  It was not so much a charge as an accident, the chance of Dick's getting in the bull's way, and the boy's escape was exceedingly narrow.  His horse staggered and fell to his knees.  The violence of the shock wrested Dick's rifle from his hand, and he was barely quick enough to grasp it as it was sliding across the saddle.  But he did save it, and the horse, trembling and frightened, recovered his feet.  By that time the old bull and his comrades were gone.  Dick glanced around and was relieved to see that nobody had noticed his plight.  They were all too much absorbed in their own efforts to pay any heed to him.  The body took a deep, long breath.  He had killed a buffalo, despite his inexperience. There was the cow to show for it.  The herd thundered off to the southward, the clouds of dust and the fringe of wolves following it.  About a dozen of their number had fallen before the rifles, but Dick had secured the fattest and the tenderest.  Albert, as proud as Dick himself of his triumph, came down on the plain and helped as much as he could in skinning and cutting up the cow.  Dick wished to preserve the robe, and they spread it out on the wagon to dry.  The train made no further attempt to advance that day, but devoted the afternoon to a great feast.  Bright Sun showed them how to cook the tenderest part of the hump in the coals, and far into the night the fires blazed.  \"We will see no more buffaloes for a while,\" said Bright Sun. \"To-morrow we reach another little river coming down from the hills, and the ground becomes rough.\"  Bright Sun told the truth.  They reached the river about noon of the next day, and, as it flowed between steep banks, the crossing was difficult.  It took many hours to get on the other side, and two or three axles were broken by the heavy jolts.  Conway raged and swore, calling them a clumsy lot, and some of the men refused to take his abuse, replying to his hard words with others equally as hard.  Pistols were drawn and there was promise of trouble, but it was finally stopped, partly by the persuasion of others, and partly of its own accord.  The men were still feeling the desire for gold too strongly to fight while on the way to it. Dick and Albert kept aloof from these contentions, steadily minding their own business, and they found, as others do, that it paid.  They came presently into a better country, and the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22464"],["title","The Last of the Chiefs: A Story of the Great Sioux War (#4)"],["body","led for a day or two through a typical part of the Great Plains, not a flat region, but one of low, monotonous swells.  Now and then they crossed a shallow little creek, and occasionally they came to pools, some of which were tinged with alkali.  There were numerous small depressions, two or three feet deep, and Dick knew that they were \"buffalo wallows.\"  He and Albert examined them with interest.  \"This is buffalo country again,\" said Dick.  \"Everything proves it.  The grass here is the best that we have seen in a long time, and I imagine that it's just the sort of place they would love.\"  The grass was, indeed, good, as Dick had said, not merely clumps of it, but often wide, carpeted spaces.  It was somewhat dry, and turning brown, but so big and strong an animal as the buffalo would not mind it.  In fact, they saw several small groups of buffaloes grazing at a distance, usually on the crest of one of the low swells.  As they already had plenty of buffalo meat, the men of the train did not trouble them, and the great animals would continue to crop the grass undisturbed.  About a week after the buffalo hunt they camped in a great plain somewhat flatter than any that they had encountered hitherto, and drew up the wagons in a loose circle.  The day had been very hot, but, as usual on the plains, the night brought coolness.  The fire which Dick made of buffalo chips was not only useful, but it felt pleasant, too, as they sat beside it, ate their supper, and watched the great inclosing circle of darkness creep up closer and closer to the camp.  There was not much noise about them.  The men were tired, and as soon as they ate their food they fell asleep in the wagons or on the ground. The tethered horses and mules stirred a little for a while, but they, too, soon rested in peace.  \"You take the wagon, Al,\" said Dick, \"but I think I'll sleep on the ground.\"  Albert said good night and disappeared in the wagon.  Dick stood up and looked over the camp.  Only two or three fires were yet burning, and not a dozen men were awake.  He saw dark figures here and there on the ground, and knew that they were those of sleepers.  Three sentinels had been posted, but Dick was quite sure from the general character of the train that later on they would sleep like the others.  All his instincts of order and fitness rebelled against the management of this camp.  Dick rolled himself in his blanket and lay down by the little fire that he had built.  The dry, clean earth made a good bed, and with his left elbow under his head he gazed into the fire, which, like all fires of buffalo chips, was now rapidly dying, leaving little behind but light ashes that the first breeze would scatter through space.  He watched the last blaze sink and go out, he saw the last coal die, then, when a few sparks flew upward, there was blank darkness where the fire had been.  All the other fires were out, too, and only the dim figures of the wagons showed.  He felt, for a little while, as if he were alone in the wilderness, but he was not afraid.  All was darkness below, and the wind was moaning, but overhead was a blue sky filled with friendly stars.  Dick could not go to sleep for a long time.  From the point where he lay he could now see two of the sentinels walking back and forth, rifle on shoulder.  He did not believe that they would continue to do so many hours, and he had a vague sort of desire to prove that he was right.  Having nothing else to do he watched them.  The nearer sentinel grew lazier in his walk, and his beat became shorter.  At last he dropped his rifle to the ground, leaned his folded arms on its muzzle, and gazed toward the camp, where, so far as he could see, there was nothing but darkness and sleep. The other presently did the same.  Then they began short walks back and forth, but soon both sat down on the ground, with their rifles between their knees, and after that they did not stir. Watching as closely as he could Dick could not observe the slightest movement on the part of either, and he knew that they were asleep.  He laughed to himself, pleased, in a way, to know that he had been right, although it was only another evidence of the carelessness and indifference general throughout the train.  He fell asleep himself in another half hour, but he awoke about midnight, and he was conscious at once that he had been awakened not by a troubled mind, but by something external and unusual. He was lying with his right ear to the ground, and it seemed to him that a slight trembling motion ran through the solid earth. He did not so much hear it as feel it, and tried to persuade himself that it was mere fancy, but failed. He sat up, and he no longer observed the trembling, but when he put his ear to the ground again it was stronger.  It could not be fancy.  It was something real and extraordinary. He glanced at the sentinels, but they were sound asleep.  He felt a desire to rouse somebody, but if it proved to be nothing they would laugh at him, or more likely call him hard names.  He tried ear to earth once more.  The trembling was still growing in strength, and mixed with it was a low, groaning sound, like the swell of the sea on the shore.  The sound came with the wind from the north.  Dick sprang to his feet.  There, in the north was a faint light which grew with amazing rapidity.  In a minutes almost it seemed to redden the whole northern heavens, and the groaning sound became a roll, like that of approaching thunder.  A shadow flitted by Dick.  \"What is it, Bright Sun?? What is it?\" exclaimed the boy.  \"The dry grass burns, and a mighty buffalo herd flees before it.\"  Then Bright Sun was gone, and the full sense of their danger burst upon Dick in overwhelming tide.  The flames came on, as fast as a horse's gallop, and the buffaloes, in thousands and tens of thousands, were their vanguard.  The camp lay directly in the path of fire and buffalo.  The awakened sentinels were on their feet now, and half-clad men were springing from the wagons.  Dick stood perfectly still for perhaps a minute, while the fire grew brighter and the thunder of a myriad hoofs grew louder. Then he remembered what he had so often read and heard, and the crisis stirred him to swift action.  While the whole camp was a scene of confusion, of shouts, of oaths, and of running men, he sped to its south side, to a point twenty or thirty yards from the nearest wagon.  There he knelt in the dry grass and drew his box of matches from his pocket.  It happened that Conway saw.  \"What are you doing, you boy?\" he cried, threateningly.  But Dick did not care for Conway just then.  \"Back fire!  Back fire!\" he shouted, and struck a match.  It went out, but he quickly struck another, shielded it with one hand and touched the tiny flame to the grass.  A flame equally tiny answered, but in an instant it leaped into the size and strength of a giant.  The blaze rose higher than Dick's head, ran swiftly to right and left, and then roared away to the south, eating up everything in its path.  \"Well done,\" said a voice at Dick's elbow.  \"It is the only thing that could save the train.\"  It was Bright Sun who spoke, and he had come so silently that Dick did not see him until then.  Conway understood now, but without a word of approval he turned away and began to give orders, mixed with much swearing.  He had a rough sort of efficiency, and spurred by his tongue and their own dreadful necessity, the men worked fast.  The horses and mules, except three or four which had broken loose and were lost, were hitched to the wagons in half the usual time.  There were no sluggards now.  Dick helped, and Albert, too, but to both it seemed that the work would never be done.  The back fire was already a half mile away, gathering volume and speed as it went, but the other was coming on at an equal pace.  Deer and antelope were darting past them, and the horses and mules were rearing in terror.  \"Into the burned ground,\" shouted Conway, \"an' keep the wagons close together!\"  No need to urge the animals.  They galloped southward over earth which was still hot and smoking, but they knew that something was behind them, far more terrible than sparks and smoke.  Dick made Albert jump into their own wagon, while he ran beside it.  As he ran, he looked back, and saw a sight that might well fill the bravest soul with dread.  A great black line, crested with tossing horns, was bearing down on them.  The thunder of hoofs was like the roar of a hurricane, but behind the herd was a vast wall of light, which seemed to reach from the earth to the heavens and which gave forth sparks in myriads.  Dick knew that they had been just in time.  They did not stop until they had gone a full quarter of a mile, and then the wagons were hastily drawn up in a rude circle, with the animals facing the center, that is, the inside, and still rearing and neighing in terror.  Then the men, rifle in hand, and sitting in the rear of the wagons, faced the buffalo herd.  Dick was with the riflemen, and, like the others, he began to fire as soon as the vanguard of the buffaloes was near enough. The wagons were a solid obstacle which not even King Bison could easily run over, but Dick and Albert thought the herd would never split, although the bullets were poured into it at a central point like a driven wedge.  But the falling buffaloes were an obstacle to those behind them, and despite their mad panic, the living became conscious of the danger in front.  The herd split at last, the cleft widened to right and left, and then the tide, in two great streams, flowed past the wagon train.  Dick ceased firing and sat with Albert on the tail of the wagon. The wall of fire, coming to the burned ground, went out in the center, but the right and left ends of it, swinging around, still roared to the southward, passing at a distance of a quarter of a mile on either side.  Dick and Albert watched until all the herd was gone, and when only smoke and"]]]
