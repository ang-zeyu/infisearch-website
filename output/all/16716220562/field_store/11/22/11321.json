GRAMMAR   INTRODUCTION  §1.  MIDDLE HIGH GERMAN  Middle High German (MHG.) embraces the High German language from about the year 1100 to 1500. It is divided into three great dialect-groups: Upper German, Franconian, and East Middle German.  1. Upper German is divided into: (_a_) Alemanic, embracing High Alemanic (Switzerland), and Low Alemanic (South Baden, Swabia, and Alsace). (_b_) Bavarian, extending over Bavaria and those parts of Austria where German is spoken.  2. Franconian (West Middle German), which is subdivided into Upper Franconian and Middle Franconian. Upper Franconian consists of East Franconian (the old duchy of Francia Orientalis) and Rhenish Franconian (the old province of Francia Rhinensis), Middle Franconian extending over the district along the banks of the Moselle and of the Rhine from Coblence to Düsseldorf.  3. East Middle German, extending over: Thuringia, Upper Saxony, and Silesia.  Since it is impossible to deal with all these dialects in an elementary book like the present, we shall confine ourselves almost exclusively to Upper German, and shall only deal with that period of Middle High German which extends from about 1200 to 1300.     PHONOLOGY     CHAPTER I   THE VOWELS  §2.  MHG. had the following simple vowels and diphthongs:--    Short vowels  a, ä, ë, e, i, o, u, ö, ü.   Long    „     ā, æ,    ē, ī, ō, ū, œ, iu.   Diphthongs             ei, ie, ou, uo, öu (eu), üe.    NOTE.--{ë} represents primitive Germanic {e} (= Gr. ε, Lat. {e}, as   in Gr. δέκα, Lat. {decem}, MHG. {zëhen}, _ten_) and is generally   written {ë} in Old and Middle High German grammars, in order to   distinguish it from the OHG. umlaut-{e} (§10). The former was an   open sound like the {e} in English {bed}, whereas the latter was a   close sound like the {é} in French {été}. {ä} was a very open sound   nearly like the {a} in English {hat}, and arose in MHG. from the   {i}-umlaut of {a} (§10). Good MHG. poets do not rhyme Germanic {ë}   with the umlaut-{e}, and the distinction between the two sounds is   still preserved in many NHG. dialects. In like manner the modern   Bavarian and Austrian dialects still distinguish between {ä} and   {ë}. In the MHG. period {ä, ë}, and {e} were kept apart in   Bavarian, but in Alemanic and Middle German {ä} and {ë} seem to have   fallen together in {ë} or possibly {ä}, as the two sounds frequently   rhyme with each other in good poets. MHG. texts do not always   preserve in writing the distinction between the old umlaut-{e} and   the MHG. umlaut-{ä}, both being often written {e} in the same text.  [**non-UTF-8]   NOTE.--{ë} represents primitive Germanic {e} (= Gr. [epsilon], Lat.   {e}, as in Gr. [deka], Lat. {decem}, MHG. {zëhen}, _ten_) and is   generally written {ë} in Old and Middle High German grammars, in   order to distinguish it from the OHG. umlaut-{e} (§10). The former   was an open sound like the {e} in English {bed}, whereas the latter   was a close sound like the {é} in French {été}. {ä} was a very open   sound nearly like the {a} in English {hat}, and arose in MHG. from   the {i}-umlaut of {a} (§10). Good MHG. poets do not rhyme Germanic   {ë} with the umlaut-{e}, and the distinction between the two sounds   is still preserved in many NHG. dialects. In like manner the modern   Bavarian and Austrian dialects still distinguish between {ä} and   {ë}. In the MHG. period {ä, ë}, and {e} were kept apart in   Bavarian, but in Alemanic and Middle German {ä} and {ë} seem to have   fallen together in {ë} or possibly {ä}, as the two sounds frequently   rhyme with each other in good poets. MHG. texts do not always   preserve in writing the distinction between the old umlaut-{e} and   the MHG. umlaut-{ä}, both being often written {e} in the same text.   PRONUNCIATION OF THE VOWELS.  §3.  The approximate pronunciation of the above vowels and diphthongs was as follows:--    a  as in NHG. m_a_nn     man, _man_.   ā  „  „  Engl. f_a_ther  hāt, _has_.   ä  „  „   „    m_a_n     mähte, _powers_.   æ  „  „   „    _ai_r     lære, _empty_.   ë  „  „   „    m_e_n     hëlfen, _to help_.   e  „  „  Fr. _é_t_é_     geste, _guests_.   ē  „  „  NHG. r_e_h      sē, _sea_.   i  „  „  Engl. b_i_t     biten, _to beg_.   ī  „  „   „    w_ee_n    wīn, _wine_.   o  „  „   „    p_o_t     golt, _gold_.   ō  „  „  NHG. t_o_t      tōt, _dead_.   u  „  „  Engl. p_u_t     guldīn, _golden_.   ū  „  „   „    f_oo_l    hūs, _house_.   ö  „  „  NHG. l_ö_cher   löcher, _holes_.   œ  „  „   „   sch_ö_n    schœne, _beautiful_.   ü  „  „   „   f_ü_llen   vüllen, _to fill_.   iu „  „   „   m_ü_de     hiuser, _houses_.        ei = e + i          stein, _stone_.        ie = i + e          knie, _knee_.        ou = o + u          ouge, _eye_.   öu (eu) = ö _or_ e + ü   dröuwen, _to threaten_.        üe = ü + e          grüeȥen, _to greet_.        uo = u + o          bruoder, _brother_.  To the above list should be added the MHG. {e} in unaccented syllables, which mostly arose from the weakening of the OHG. full vowels, as OHG. {zunga}, _tongue_, {hirti}, _shepherd_, {namo}, _name_, {fridu}, _peace_ = MHG. {zunge}, {hirte}, {name}, {fride}; OHG. {habēn}, _to have_, {scōnī}, _beauty_, {salbōn}, _to anoint_, {zungūn}, _tongues_ = MHG. {haben}, {schœne}, {salben}, {zungen}. The {e} in this position was pronounced like the {-e} in NHG. {zunge}, {name}, {friede}, &c.   PHONETIC SURVEY OF THE MHG. VOWEL-SYSTEM.  §4.

The following are the OHG. equivalents of the MHG. short vowels, long vowels and diphthongs of accented syllables:--  1. The short vowels a, ë, e, i, o, u = the corresponding OHG. short vowels, as {tac}, _day_, {gast}, _guest_, {bant}, _he bound_, {gap}, _he gave_ = OHG. {tag}, {gast}, {bant}, {gab}.  {wëc}, _way_, {nëmen}, _to take_, {zëhen}, _ten_ = OHG. {wëg}, {nëman}, {zëhan}.  {geste}, _guests_, {lember}, _lambs_, {vert}, _he goes_ = OHG. {gesti}, {lembir}, {ferit}.  {wiȥȥen}, _to know_, {hilfe}, _I help_, {visch}, _fish_ = OHG. {wiȥȥan}, {hilfu}, {fisk}.  {got}, _God_, {wol}, _well_, {geholfen}, _helped_ = OHG. {got}, {wola}, {giholfan}.  {sun}, _son_, {wurm}, _worm_, {gebunden}, _bound_ = OHG. {sunu}, {wurm}, {gibuntan}.  {ä} is the umlaut of {a} before certain consonant combinations which prevented umlaut from taking place in OHG., as {mähte}, _powers_, {hältet}, _he holds_, {wärmen}, _to warm_ = OHG. {mahti}, {haltit}, {warmen} from {*warmjan} (§10). It also occurs in derivatives ending in {-līch} and {-līn}, as {mänlīch}, _manly_, {tägelīch}, _daily_, {väterlīn}, dim. of {vater}, _father_; and in words which originally had an {i} in the third syllable, the vowel of the second syllable having become {i} by assimilation, as {mägede}, _maids_, {zäher(e)}, _tears_ = OHG. {magadi}, {zahari}.  {ö} is the umlaut of OHG. {o}, as {löcher}, _holes_, {möhte}, _I might_ = OHG. {lohhir}, {mohti}; {götinne}, _goddess_, beside {got}, _God_.  {ü} is the umlaut of OHG. {u}, as {dünne}, _thin_, {süne}, _sons_, {züge}, _I might draw_ = OHG. {dunni}, {suni}, {zugi}.  2. The long vowels ā, ē, ī, ō, ū = the corresponding OHG. long vowels, as {sāt}, _seed_, {slāfen}, _to sleep_, {nāmen}, _we took_, {dāhte}, _he thought_ = OHG. {sāt}, {slāfan}, {nāmum}, {dāhta}.  {sēle}, _soul_, {mēre}, _more_, {lēren}, _to teach_ = OHG. {sēla}, {mēro}, {lēren}.  {wīp}, _wife_, {sīn}, _his_, {bīȥen}, _to bite_ = OHG. {wīb}, {sīn}, {bīȥan}.  {ōre}, _ear_, {tōt}, _death_, {kōs}, _I chose_ = OHG. {ōra}, {tōd}, {kōs}.  {hūs}, _house_, {tūsent}, _thousand_, {dūhte}, _it seemed_ = OHG. {hūs}, {dūsunt}, {dūhta}.  {æ} is the umlaut of OHG. {ā}, as {lære}, _empty_, {næme}, _thou tookest_ = OHG. {lāri}, {nāmi}.  {œ} is the umlaut of OHG. {ō}, as {schœne}, _beautiful_, {hœher}, _higher_, {hœren}, _to hear_ = OHG. {scōni}, {hōhiro}, {hōren} from {*hōrjan} older {*hausjan}.  iu = (1) OHG. {iu} (diphthong), as {liute}, _people_,          {kiuset}, _he chooses_ = OHG. {liuti}, {kiusit}.     = (2) the umlaut of OHG. {ū}, as {hiuser}, _houses_,          {briute}, _brides_ = OHG. {hūsir}, {brūti}.  3. The diphthongs ei, ou, uo = the corresponding OHG. diphthongs, as {bein}, _bone_, {leiten}, _to lead_, {schreip}, _I wrote_ = OHG. {bein}, {leiten}, {screib}.  {ouge}, _eye_, {houbet}, _head_, {bouc}, _I bent_ = OHG. {ouga}, {houbit}, {boug}.  {bruoder}, _brother_, {stuont}, _I stood_, {vuor}, _I went_ = OHG. {bruoder}, {stuont}, {fuor}.  ie = (1) OHG. {ie} (diphthong) older {ia}, {ea, ē} (Germanic {ē}),          as {hier}, _here_, {miete}, _pay, reward_, {gienc}, _I went_          = OHG. {hier}, {mieta}, {gieng}.     = (2) OHG. {io} (Germanic {eu}), as {bieten}, _to offer_, {liep},          _dear_ = OHG. {biotan}, {liob}.     = (3) the OHG. {io} which occurs in the preterite of the old          reduplicated verbs whose presents have {ou}, {ō, uo} (§87),          as inf. {loufen}, _to run_, {stōȥen}, _to push_, {ruofen},          _to call_, preterite {lief}, {stieȥ}, {rief} = OHG. {liof},          {stioȥ}, {riof}.     = (4) Upper German {iu} (OHG. {io}) before labials and gutturals,          as {liup}, _dear_, {tiuf}"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22636"],["title","A Middle High German Primer (#2)"],["body",", _deep_, {siuch}, _sick_,          {liugen}, _to tell a lie_ = {liep}, {tief}, {siech},          {liegen}.  {öu} ({eu}) is the umlaut of OHG. {ou}, as {löuber}, _leaves_, {löufel}, _runner_ = OHG. {loubir}, {loufil}.  {üe} is the umlaut of OHG. {uo}, as {grüene}, _green_, {güete}, _goodness_, {vüere}, _thou didst go_ = OHG. {gruoni}, {guotī}, {fuori}.   UNACCENTED VOWELS AND UMLAUT.  §6.  The two most characteristic differences between OHG. and MHG. are: (1) the spread of umlaut (§10); (2) the weakening and partial loss of vowels in unaccented syllables.   1. THE WEAKENING OF UNACCENTED VOWELS.  §7.  The short vowels a, i, o, u, and the long vowels ē, ī, ō, ū were weakened to {e}. This {e} was pronounced like the final {-e} in NHG. {leute}, see §3. Examples are:--  {gëba}, _gift_, {hërza}, _heart_, {zunga}, _tongue_, {taga}, _days_ = MHG. {gëbe}, {hërze}, {zunge}, {tage}; {heilag}, _holy_, neut. {blindaȥ}, _blind_, {nëman}, _to take_ = MHG. {heilec}, {blindeȥ}, {nëmen}.  {kunni}, _race, generation_, {gesti}, _guests_ = MHG. {künne}, {geste}; {kuning}, _king_, {beȥȥisto}, _best_, dat. pl. {gestim}, _to guests_, gen. pl. {lembiro}, _of lambs_, {nimit}, _he takes_ = MHG. {künec}, {beȥȥest} ({beste}), {gesten}, {lember(e)}, {nimet}.  {haso}, _hare_, nom. acc. pl. fem. {blinto}, _blind_, gen. pl. {tago}, _of days_ = MHG. {hase}, {blinde}, {tage}; acc. sing. {hason}, _hare_ = MHG. {hasen}.  {fridu}, _peace_, dat. sing. {gëbu}, _to a gift_, {nimu}, _I take_ = MHG. {fride}, {gëbe}, {nime}; dat. pl. {tagum}, _to days_, {nāmum}, _we took_ = MHG. {tagen}, {nāmen}.  Nom. sing. masc. {blintēr}, _blind_, {unsēr}, _our_, {habēn}, _to have_, {nëmēm}, _we may take_ = MHG. {blinder}, {unser}, {haben}, {nëmen}.  {scōnī}, _beauty_ = MHG. {schœne}; {sālīg}, _blessed_, {nāmīm}, _we might take_ = MHG. {sælec}, {næmen}.  {salbōn}, _to anoint_, {suohtōs(t)}, _thou soughtest_, dat. pl. {gëbōm}, {hërzōm} = MHG. {salben}, {suohtes(t)}, {gëben}, {hërzen}.  Gen. dat. acc. sing., nom. acc. pl. {zungūn} = MHG. {zungen}.   §8.  The vowel in suffixal and derivative syllables was generally weakened to {e} just as in the inflexional syllables, but in some suffixal and derivative syllables which had a secondary accent the vowel was not weakened to {e}. This was especially the case with derivatives in {-ære} (denoting nomina agentis), {-inne}, {-inc} ({-ing}), {linc} ({-ling}), diminutives in {-īn} and {-līn}, abstract nouns in {-nisse} ({-nusse}, {-nüsse}), {-unge}. In others the vowel fluctuated between the full vowel and {e}, as in {-isch} beside {-esch}; {-ic} (= OHG. {-ag}, and {-ī̆g}) beside {-ec}; superlative of adjectives {-ist} (= OHG. {-ist}) beside {-est} (= OHG. {-ōst}); {-sal} beside {-sel}. Beside the full forms {-līch}, {-rīch} occurred the shortened forms {-lich}, {-rich}.  The OHG. endings of the present participle {-anti}, {-enti}, {-ōnti}, {ēnti} regularly became {-ende}, but {-ant} occurs in a few old participles which had become nouns, as {heilant}, _Saviour_, {wīgant}, _warrior_, {vīant} beside {vīent} ({vīnt}), _fiend, enemy_. Examples are: {gartenære}, _gardener_, {schepfære}, _creator_, {schrībære}, _scribe_.  {küneginne}, _queen_, {vriundinne}, _female friend_, {wirtinne}, _mistress_.  {edelinc}, _son of a nobleman_, {hendelinc}, _glove_, {vingerlinc}, _ring_; {müedinc}, _unhappy man_.  {magedīn}, _little girl_, {vingerīn}, _ring_; {kindelīn}, _little child_, {vogelīn}, _little bird_.  {hindernisse}, _hindrance_, {verdërbnisse}, _destruction_, {vinsternisse}, _darkness_, {vancnüsse}, _captivity_.  {beȥȥerunge}, _improvement_, {handelunge}, _action_, {mëldunge}, _announcement_.  {himelisch}, _heavenly_, {irdisch}, _earthly_, {kindisch}, _childish_, beside {-esch}.  {heilic} (OHG. {heilag}), _holy_, {honic} (OHG. {honag}, {honig}), _honey_, {künic} (OHG. {cuning}, {cunig}), _king_, {manic} (OHG. {manag}), _many a_, {sælic} (OHG. {sālīg}), _blessed_, beside {-ec}.  {oberist} beside {oberest}, _highest_.  {kumbersal}, _distress_, {trüebsal}, _gloom_, {wëhsal} beside {wëhsel}, _change_.  {bitterlīch}, _bitterly_, {sicherlīch}, _surely_, {wīslīch}, _wisely_, beside {-lich}.  {Dietrīch}, {Heinrīch}, beside {-rich}.  The OHG. pronominal ending of the nom. sing. fem. and the nom. acc. pl. neuter remained unweakened, as OHG. {blintiu} = MHG. {blindiu} (§55).   2. THE LOSS OF UNACCENTED VOWELS.  §9.  The weakened {e} regularly disappeared:--  1. After {l} and {r} in dissyllables with short stems, as {ar}, older {are} (OHG. {aro}), _eagle_, acc. gen. dat. {arn}, beside {name}, _name_, {namen}; {wol}, older {wole} (OHG. {wola}), _well_; {gar} (OHG. {garo}), _ready_, {milch} (OHG. {milih}), _milk_, {zal} (OHG. {zala}), _number_; {kil}, _quill_, gen. {kil(e)s}, dat. {kil}, pl. nom. acc. {kil}, dat. {kil(e)n}, beside {tac}, _day_, gen. {tages}, dat. {tage}, pl. nom. acc. {tage}, dat. {tagen}; {bërn}, _to bear_, {stëln}, _to steal_, {nern}, _to rescue_, pres. sing. {stil}, {stils(t)}, {stilt}; {ner}, {ners(t)}, {nert}, beside {hœren}, _to hear_, pres. sing. {hœre}, {hœres(t)}, {hœret}.  2. After liquids and nasals in trisyllabic and polysyllabic forms with long stems, as {sælde} (OHG. {sālida}), _blessedness_, {hērsen}, {hërsen} (OHG. {hērisōn}), _to rule_, {zierde} (OHG. {ziarida}), _adornment_, {wandelte} (OHG. {wantalōta}), _I wandered_, {zwīfeln} (OHG. {zwīfalōn}), _to doubt_, {wundern} (OHG. {wuntarōn}), _to wonder_, {schœnste} (OHG. {scōnisto}), _most beautiful_, {diente}, {diende} (OHG. {dionōta}), _I served_; {dienest}, _service_, gen. {dienstes}; {engel}, _angel_, gen. {engel(e)s}, dat. {engel(e)}, pl. nom. acc. gen. {engel(e)}, dat. {engel(e)n}, and similarly with words like {acker}, _acre_, {lūter}, _clear_, {buosem}, _bosom_, {heiden}, _heathen_; {grœȥer} (OHG. {grōȥiro}), _greater_, fem. dat. sing. {grœȥer} (OHG. {grōȥiru}); dat. sing. {blindem(e)}, _blind_, {guotem(e)}, _good_ = OHG. {blintemu}, {guotemu}; gen. pl. {blinder(e)} = OHG. {blintero}. After the analogy of forms with long stems it was also dropped in forms with short stems, as pl. {nagel}, _nails_, {vogel}, _birds_, beside {nagele}, {vogele}; {wider} beside {widere} (OHG. {widaro}), _wether_, dat. sing. {disem(e)}, _this_, {vadem(e)}, _thread_, gen. {vadem(e)s}.  There was however a strong tendency in MHG. for the medial vowel to disappear in trisyllabic forms with long stems irrespectively as to whether they contained a liquid or a nasal, as {market}, _market_, gen. {marktes}; {rīchsen} (OHG. {rīchisōn}), _to rule_, {ahte} (OHG. {ahtōta}), _he observed_, {wartte}, {warte} (OHG. {wartēta}), _he waited_, {vrāgte} beside {vrāgete} (OHG. {frāgēta}), _he asked_, {dancte} beside {dankete} (OHG. {dankōta}), _he thanked_. See §92.  3. In the medial syllable of trisyllabic forms with long stems having liquids or nasals in successive syllables, as {dīme} beside {dīneme} (OHG. {dīnemu}), dat. of {dīn}, _thy_; {eime} beside {ein(e)me} (OHG. {einemu}), dat. of {ein}, _one_; {hērre}, {hërre} (OHG. {hēriro}), _master_; {minre} beside {minner(e)} (OHG. {minniro}), _less_; {tiurre} (OHG. {tiuriro}), _dearer_.  4. Finally after a nasal, and medially after a nasal before a following {t}, in forms with short stems, as {han(e)}, _cock_, {nam(e)}, _name_, {sun} (OHG. {sun}, {sunu}), _son_, {won(e)}, _I dwell_; {man(e)t}, _he admonishes_, {won(e)t}, _he dwells_, {scham(e)t}, _he shames_, {nim(e)t}, _he takes_, {nëm(e)t}, _ye take_; pret. {won(e)te}, {scham(e)te}. In these and similar forms the {e} was often restored through the influence of forms which regularly preserved the {e}.    NOTE.--The {e}, when not preceded by a nasal, was sometimes dropped   in verbal forms ending in {t}. This was especially the case in   {wirst}, {wirt} older {wirdes(t)}, {wirdet}; {siht}, _he sees_,   {sëht}, _ye see_, older {sihet}, {sëhet}; and often in forms like   {gilt}, {vint}, {spricht}, {sticht} beside {giltet}, {vindet},   {sprichet}, {stichet}.  5. The superlative of adjectives often has double forms, the one with the loss of the medial {e}, and the other with the loss of the final {e}, as {beste}, _best_, {ērste}, _first_, {grœste}, _greatest_, {leste}, _last_, {min(ne)ste}, _least_, {wir(se)ste}, _worst_, beside {beȥȥest(e)}, {ērest(e)}, {grœȥest(e)}, {leȥȥest(e)}, {minnest(e)}, {wirsest(e)}, OHG. {beȥȥisto}, {ēristo}, {grōȥisto}, {leȥȥisto}, {minnisto}, {wirsisto}.  6. In the unstressed forms of dissyllables, as adv. {ane}, {abe}, {mite}, {obe} beside the prepositions {an}, _on_, {ab}, _of_, {mit}, _with_, {ob}, _over_; dat. sing. {dëme}, {wëme}, {ime}, beside {dëm}, {wëm}, {im}; {unde}, _and_, {wande}, _for_, _because_, beside {und} ({unt}), {wan(d)}; {hërre}, {vrouwe}, beside {hër}, {vrou} before proper names and titles.  7. The {e} in the unaccented verbal prefixes {be-}, {ge-} often disappeared before {l, n, r}, as {blīben}, _to remain_, {glīch}, _like_, {glit}, _member_, {glouben}, _to believe_, {gnāde}, _favour_, {gnanne}, _namesake_, {gnuoge}, _many_, {grade}, _quick_, {grëch}, _straight_, beside {belīben}, {gelīch}, {gelit}, {gelouben}, {genāde}, {genanne}, {genuoge}, {gerade}, {gerëch}; it disappeared before vowels during the OHG. period, as {bange}, _anxious_: {ange}, _anxiously_, {gëȥȥan} p.p. of {ëȥȥan}, _to eat_, {gunnan}, MHG. {gunnen}, {günnen}, _to grant_.   3. UMLAUT.  §10.  By umlaut is meant the modification (palatalization) of an accented vowel through the influence of an {ī̆} or {j} which originally stood in the following syllable. The only vowel which underwent this change in OHG. was {a}, which became close {e} (§2, note).  The change is first met with in OHG. monuments about the middle of the eighth century. In the ninth century the process was practically complete except when the {a} was followed by certain consonant combinations which prevented umlaut from taking place. These consonant combinations were:--  1. {ht}, {hs}, or consonant + {w}, as {maht}, _power_, pl. {mahti; wahsit}, _he grows_, inf. {wahsan}; {bi-scatwen} from {*-scatwjan}, _to shade_.  2.
