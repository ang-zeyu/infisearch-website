I do not know to what      fact \"pig in India\" refers.  Now in crossing it is certain every peculiarity in form and constitution is transmitted: an alpine plant transmits its alpine tendency to its offspring, an American plant its American-bog constitution, and <with> animals, those peculiarities, on which{77} when placed out of their natural conditions they are incapable of breeding; and moreover they transmit every part of their constitution, their respiration, their pulse, their instinct, which are all suddenly modified, can it be wondered at that they are incapable of breeding? I think it may be truly said it would be more wonderful if they did. But it may be asked why have not the recognised varieties, supposed to have been produced through the means of man, [not refused to breed] have all bred{78}. Variation depends on change of condition and selection{79}, as far as man's systematic or unsystematic selection <has> gone; he takes external form, has little power from ignorance over internal invisible constitutional differences. Races which have long been domesticated, and have much varied, are precisely those which were capable of bearing great changes, whose constitutions were adapted to a diversity of climates. Nature changes slowly and by degrees. According to many authors probably breeds of dogs are another case of modified species freely crossing. There is no variety which <illegible> has been <illegible> adapted to peculiar soil or situation for a thousand years and another rigorously adapted to another, till such can be produced, the question is not tried{80}. Man in past ages, could transport into different climates, animals and plants which would freely propagate in such new climates. Nature could effect, with selection, such changes slowly, so that precisely those animals which are adapted to submit to great changes have given rise to diverse races,--and indeed great doubt on this head{81}.       {77} This sentence should run \"on which depends their incapacity to      breed in unnatural conditions.\"       {78} This sentence ends in confusion: it should clearly close with      the words \"refused to breed\" in place of the bracket and the      present concluding phrase.       {79} The author doubtless refers to the change produced by the      _summation_ of variation by means of selection.       {80} The meaning of this sentence is made clear by a passage in the      MS. of 1844:--\"Until man selects two varieties from the same stock,      adapted to two climates or to other different external conditions,      and confines each rigidly for one or several thousand years to such      conditions, always selecting the individuals best adapted to them,      he cannot be said to have even commenced the experiment.\" That is,      the attempt to produce mutually sterile domestic breeds.       {81} This passage is to some extent a repetition of a previous one      and may have been intended to replace an earlier sentence. I have      thought it best to give both. In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 141, vi.      p. 176, the author gives his opinion that the power of resisting      diverse conditions, seen in man and his domestic animals, is an      example \"of a very common flexibility of constitution.\"  Before leaving this subject well to observe that it was shown that a certain amount of variation is consequent on mere act of reproduction, both by buds and sexually,--is vastly increased when parents exposed for some generations to new conditions{82}, and we now find that many animals when exposed for first time to very new conditions, are <as> incapable of breeding as hybrids. It [probably] bears also on supposed fact of crossed animals when not infertile, as in mongrels, tending to vary much, as likewise seems to be the case, when true hybrids possess just sufficient fertility to propagate with the parent breeds and _inter se_ for some generations. This is Koelreuter's belief. These facts throw light on each other and support the truth of each other, we see throughout a connection between the reproductive faculties and exposure to changed conditions of life whether by crossing or exposure of the individuals{83}.       {82} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. Chs. I. and V., the author does not      admit reproduction, apart from environment, as being a cause of      variation. With regard to the cumulative effect of new conditions      there are many passages in the _Origin_, Ed. i. e.g. pp. 7, 12, vi.      pp. 8, 14.       {83} As already pointed out, this is the important principle      investigated in the author's _Cross and Self-Fertilisation_.      Professor Bateson has suggested to me that the experiments should      be repeated with gametically pure individuals.  _Difficulties on theory of selection_{84}. It may be objected such perfect organs as eye and ear, could never be formed, in latter less difficulty as gradations more perfect; at first appears monstrous and to <the> end appears difficulty. But think of gradation, even now manifest, (Tibia and Fibula). Everyone will allow if every fossil preserved, gradation infinitely more perfect; for possibility of selection a perfect <?> gradation is required. Different groups of structure, slight gradation in each group,--every analogy renders it probable that intermediate forms have existed. Be it remembered what strange metamorphoses; part of eye, not directly connected with vision, might come to be [thus used] gradually worked in for this end,--swimming bladder by gradation of structure is admitted to belong to the ear system,--rattlesnake. [Woodpecker best adapted to climb.] In some cases gradation not possible,--as vertebræ,--actually vary in domestic animals,--less difficult if growth followed. Looking to whole animals, a bat formed not for flight{85}. Suppose we had flying fish{86} and not one of our now called flying fish preserved, who would have guessed intermediate habits. Woodpeckers and tree-frogs both live in countries where no trees{87}.       {84} In the _Origin_ a chapter is given up to \"difficulties on      theory\": the discussion in the present essay seems slight even when      it is remembered how small a space is here available. For _Tibia_      &c. see p. 48.       {85} This may be interpreted \"The general structure of a bat is the      same as that of non-flying mammals.\"       {86} That is truly winged fish.       {87} The terrestrial woodpecker of S. America formed the subject of      a paper by Darwin, _Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1870. See _Life and      Letters_, vol. iii. p. 153.  The gradations by which each individual organ has arrived at its present state, and each individual animal with its aggregate of organs has arrived, probably never could be known, and all present great difficulties. I merely wish to show that the proposition is not so monstrous as it at first appears, and that if good reason can be advanced for believing the species have descended from common parents, the difficulty of imagining intermediate forms of structure not sufficient to make one at once reject the theory.   § III. <ON VARIATION IN INSTINCTS AND OTHER MENTAL ATTRIBUTES.>  The mental powers of different animals in wild and tame state [present still greater difficulties] require a separate section. Be it remembered I have nothing to do with origin of memory, attention, and the different faculties of the mind{88}, but merely with their differences in each of the great divisions of nature. Disposition, courage, pertinacity <?>, suspicion, restlessness, ill-temper, sagacity and <the> reverse unquestionably vary in animals and are inherited (Cuba wildness dogs, rabbits, fear against particular object as man Galapagos{89}). Habits purely corporeal, breeding season &c., time of going to rest &c., vary and are hereditary, like the analogous habits of plants which vary and are inherited. Habits of body, as manner of movement d^o. and d^o. Habits, as pointing and setting on certain occasions d^o. Taste for hunting certain objects and manner of doing so,--sheep-dog. These are shown clearly by crossing and their analogy with true instinct thus shown,--retriever. Do not know objects for which they do it. Lord Brougham's definition{90}. Origin partly habit, but the amount necessarily unknown, partly selection. Young pointers pointing stones and sheep--tumbling pigeons--sheep{91} going back to place where born. Instinct aided by reason, as in the taylor-bird{92}. Taught by parents, cows choosing food, birds singing. Instincts vary in wild state (birds get wilder) often lost{93}; more perfect,--nest without roof. These facts [only clear way] show how incomprehensibly brain has power of transmitting intellectual operations.       {88} The same proviso occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 207, vi. p.      319.       {89} The tameness of the birds in the Galapagos is described in the      _Journal of Researches_ (1860), p. 398. Dogs and rabbits are      probably mentioned as cases in which the hereditary fear of man has      been lost. In the 1844 MS. the author states that the Cuban feral      dog shows great natural wildness, even when caught quite young.       {90} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 207, vi. p. 319, he refuses to      define instinct. For Lord Brougham's definition see his      _Dissertations on Subjects of Science etc._, 1839, p. 27.       {91} See James Hogg (the Ettrick Shepherd), Works, 1865, _Tales and      Sketches_, p. 403.       {92} This refers to the tailor-bird making use of manufactured      thread supplied to it, instead of thread twisted by itself.       {93} _Often lost_ applies to _instinct_: _birds get wilder_ is      printed in a parenthesis because it was apparently added as an      after-thought. _Nest without roof_ refers to the water-ousel      omitting to vault its nest when building in a protected"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22728"],["title","The Foundations of the Origin of Species (#8)"],["body",".  Faculties{94} distinct from true instincts,--finding [way]. It must I think be admitted that habits whether congenital or acquired by practice [sometimes] often become inherited{95}; instincts, influence, equally with structure, the preservation of animals; therefore selection must, with changing conditions tend to modify the inherited habits of animals. If this be admitted it will be found _possible_ that many of the strangest instincts may be thus acquired. I may observe, without attempting definition, that an inherited habit or trick (trick because may be born) fulfils closely what we mean by instinct. A habit is often performed unconsciously, the strangest habits become associated, d^o. tricks, going in certain spots &c. &c., even against will, is excited by external agencies, and looks not to the end,--a person playing a pianoforte. If such a habit were transmitted it would make a marvellous instinct. Let us consider some of the most difficult cases of instincts, whether they could be _possibly_ acquired. I do not say _probably_, for that belongs to our 3rd Part{96}, I beg this may be remembered, nor do I mean to attempt to show exact method. I want only to show that whole theory ought not at once to be rejected on this score.       {94} In the MS. of 1844 is an interesting discussion on _faculty_      as distinct from _instinct_.       {95} At this date and for long afterwards the inheritance of      acquired characters was assumed to occur.       {96} Part II. is here intended: see the Introduction.  Every instinct must, by my theory, have been acquired gradually by slight changes <illegible> of former instinct, each change being useful to its then species. Shamming death struck me at first as remarkable objection. I found none really sham death{97}, and that there is gradation; now no one doubts that those insects which do it either more or less, do it for some good, if then any species was led to do it more, and then <?> escaped &c. &c.       {97} The meaning is that the attitude assumed in _shamming_ is not      accurately like that of death.  Take migratory instincts, faculty distinct from instinct, animals have notion of time,--like savages. Ordinary finding way by memory, but how does savage find way across country,--as incomprehensible to us, as animal to them,--geological changes,--fishes in river,--case of sheep in Spain{98}. Architectural instincts,--a manufacturer's employee in making single articles extraordinary skill,--often said seem to make it almost <illegible>, child born with such a notion of playing{99},--we can fancy tailoring acquired in same perfection,--mixture of reason,--water-ouzel,--taylor-bird,--gradation of simple nest to most complicated.       {98} This refers to the _transandantes_ sheep mentioned in the MS.      of 1844, as having acquired a migratory instinct.       {99} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 209, vi. p. 321, Mozart's      pseudo-instinctive skill in piano-playing is mentioned. See _Phil.      Trans._, 1770, p. 54.  Bees again, distinction of faculty,--how they make a hexagon,--Waterhouse's theory{100},--the impulse to use whatever faculty they possess,--the taylor-bird has the faculty of sewing with beak, instinct impels him to do it.       {100} In the discussion on bees' cells, _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 225,      vi. p. 343, the author acknowledges that his theory originated in      Waterhouse's observations.  Last case of parent feeding young with different food (take case of Galapagos birds, gradation from Hawfinch to Sylvia) selection and habit might lead old birds to vary taste <?> and form, leaving their instinct of feeding their young with same food{101},--or I see no difficulty in parents being forced or induced to vary the food brought, and selection adapting the young ones to it, and thus by degree any amount of diversity might be arrived at. Although we can never hope to see the course revealed by which different instincts have been acquired, for we have only present animals (not well known) to judge of the course of gradation, yet once grant the principle of habits, whether congenital or acquired by experience, being inherited and I can see no limit to the [amount of variation] extraordinariness <?> of the habits thus acquired.       {101} The hawfinch-and _Sylvia-_types are figured in the _Journal      of Researches_, p. 379. The discussion of change of form in      relation to change of instinct is not clear, and I find it      impossible to suggest a paraphrase.  _Summing up this Division._ If variation be admitted to occur occasionally in some wild animals, and how can we doubt it, when we see [all] thousands <of> organisms, for whatever use taken by man, do vary. If we admit such variations tend to be hereditary, and how can we doubt it when we <remember> resemblances of features and character,--disease and monstrosities inherited and endless races produced (1200 cabbages). If we admit selection is steadily at work, and who will doubt it, when he considers amount of food on an average fixed and reproductive powers act in geometrical ratio. If we admit that external conditions vary, as all geology proclaims, they have done and are now doing,--then, if no law of nature be opposed, there must occasionally be formed races, [slightly] differing from the parent races. So then any such law{102}, none is known, but in all works it is assumed, in <?> flat contradiction to all known facts, that the amount of possible variation is soon acquired. Are not all the most varied species, the oldest domesticated: who <would> think that horses or corn could be produced? Take dahlia and potato, who will pretend in 5000 years{103} <that great changes might not be effected>: perfectly adapted to conditions and then again brought into varying conditions. Think what has been done in few last years, look at pigeons, and cattle. With the amount of food man can produce he may have arrived at limit of fatness or size, or thickness of wool <?>, but these are the most trivial points, but even in these I conclude it is impossible to say we know the limit of variation. And therefore with the [adapting] selecting power of nature, infinitely wise compared to those of man, <I conclude> that it is impossible to say we know the limit of races, which would be true <to their> kind; if of different constitutions would probably be infertile one with another, and which might be adapted in the most singular and admirable manner, according to their wants, to external nature and to other surrounding organisms,--such races would be species. But is there any evidence <that> species <have> been thus produced, this is a question wholly independent of all previous points, and which on examination of the kingdom of nature <we> ought to answer one way or another.       {102} I should interpret this obscure sentence as follows, \"No such      opposing law is known, but in all works on the subject a law is (in      flat contradiction to all known facts) assumed to limit the      possible amount of variation.\" In the _Origin_, the author never      limits the power of variation, as far as I know.       {103} In _Var. under Dom._ Ed. 2, ii. p. 263, the _Dahlia_ is      described as showing sensitiveness to conditions in 1841. All the      varieties of the _Dahlia_ are said to have arisen since 1804      (_ibid._ i. p. 393).     PART II{104}.       {104} In the original MS. the heading is: Part III.; but Part II.      is clearly intended; for details see the Introduction. I have not      been able to discover where § IV. ends and § V. begins.   §§ IV. & V. <ON THE EVIDENCE FROM GEOLOGY.>  I may premise, that according to the view ordinarily received, the myriads of organisms peopling this world have been created by so many distinct acts of creation. As we know nothing of the <illegible> will of a Creator,--we can see no reason why there should exist any relation between the organisms thus created; or again, they might be created according to any scheme. But it would be marvellous if this scheme should be the same as would result from the descent of groups of organisms from [certain] the same parents, according to the circumstances, just attempted to be developed.  With equal probability did old cosmogonists say fossils were created, as we now see them, with a false resemblance to living beings{105}; what would the Astronomer say to the doctrine that the planets moved <not> according to the law of gravitation, but from the Creator having willed each separate planet to move in its particular orbit? I believe such a proposition (if we remove all prejudices) would be as legitimate as to admit that certain groups of living and extinct organisms, in their distribution, in their structure and in their relations one to another and to external conditions, agreed with the theory and showed signs of common descent, and yet were created distinct. As long as it was thought impossible that organisms should vary, or should anyhow become adapted to other organisms in a complicated manner, and yet be separated from them by an impassable barrier of sterility{106}, it was justifiable, even with some appearance in favour of a common descent, to admit distinct creation according to the will of an Omniscient Creator; or, for it is the same thing, to say with Whewell that the beginnings of all things surpass the comprehension of man. In the former sections I have endeavoured to show that such variation or specification is not impossible, nay, in many points of view is absolutely probable. What then is the evidence in favour of it and what the evidence against it. With our imperfect knowledge of past ages [surely there will be some] it would be strange if the imperfection did not create some unfavourable evidence.       {105} This passage corresponds roughly to the conclusion of the      _Origin_, see Ed. i. p. 482, vi. p. 661.       {106} A similar passage occurs in the conclusion of the _Origin_,      Ed. i. p. 481, vi. p."]]]
