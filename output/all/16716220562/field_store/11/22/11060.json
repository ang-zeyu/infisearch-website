Dick Prescott, Greg Holmes, Dave Darrin, Dan Dalzell, Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton first appeared in the pages of \"THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS SERIES,\" in which volumes were described the early lives of these young American schoolboys.  We found the six boys again in the pages of the \"HIGH SCHOOL BOYS SERIES,\" in the volumes of which the athletic triumphs of Dick & Co. were vividly set forth. In the \"HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' VACATION SERIES\" were recounted their further adventures.  At the conclusion of their high school careers the six chums separated to seek different fields of endeavor. Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes secured appointments as cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point, as narrated in the \"WEST POINT SERIES.\" Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell were nominated as midshipmen to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, and all that befell them there is set forth in the \"ANNAPOLIS SERIES.\" The great things that happened to Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton are told in the volumes of the \"YOUNG ENGINEERS SERIES.\" Dick Prescott's and Greg Holmes' adventures in the Army, after graduation from West Point, are set forth in the volumes of the \"BOYS OF THE ARMY SERIES.\"  The \"DAVE DARRIN SERIES\" is devoted to the lives of Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell as naval officers, after their graduation from the Naval Academy. We now find them serving as ensigns, this being the lowest rank among commissioned officers of the United States Navy.  The first volume of this series, published under the title, \"DAVE DARRIN AT VERA CRUZ,\" tells the story of Dave's and Dan's initial active service in the United States Navy. That our two young ensigns took an exciting part in the fighting there is known to all our readers.  For some time after the taking of Vera Cruz by the United States forces and the arrival of Regular Army regiments, Dave and Dan continued to serve with constant credit aboard the \"Long Island,\" stationed at Vera Cruz. Then followed their detachment from the \"Long Island,\" and their return to the United States. They were then ordered to duty with the Mediterranean Squadron, aboard the flagship \"Hudson.\" We already know what befell them on their arrival at their first port of call, the British fortress of Gibraltar, and in the quaint old Moorish city of the same name, which stands between the fortress and the harbor.         *       *       *       *       *  Dan soon took his leave of his chum, going to his own quarters for a short sleep before going on duty at eight bells in the morning. Dave, having opportunity to sleep until shortly before breakfast, sat for some minutes pondering over his strange meeting with Mr. Green Hat, whom he now knew as Emil Gortchky, a notorious international spy.  Still puzzling, Darrin turned out the light and dropped into his berth. Once there the habit of the service came strongly upon him. He was between the sheets to sleep, so, with a final sigh, he shut out thoughts of Mr. Green Hat, of the admiral's remarks, and of the whole train of events of the evening. Within a hundred and twenty seconds he was sound asleep. It was an orderly going the rounds in the early morning who spoke to Ensign Darrin and awakened him.  \"Is the ship under way?\" asked Dave, rolling over and opening his eyes.  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" responded the orderly, who then wheeled and departed.  Dave was quickly out of his berth, and dressed in time to join the gathering throng of the \"Hudson's\" officers in the ward-room, where every officer, except the captain, takes his meals.  \"Have you heard the port for which we're bound, Danny?\" Darrin asked his chum.  \"Not a word,\" replied Dalzell, shaking his head.  \"Perhaps we shall find out at breakfast,\" commented Dave.  A minute later the signal came for the officers to seat themselves. Then, after orders had been given to the attentive Filipino boys, who served as mess attendants, a buzz of conversation ran around the table.  Soon the heavy, booming voice of Lieutenant Commander Metson was heard as he asked Commander Dawson, the executive officer:  \"Sir, are we privileged to ask our port of destination?\"  This is a question often put to the executive officer of a war vessel, for ninety-nine times out of a hundred he knows the answer. He _may_ smile and reply:  \"I do not know.\"  Sometimes the executive officer, who is the captain's confidential man, has good reasons for not divulging the destination of the ship. In that case his denial of knowledge is understood to be only a courteous statement that he does not deem it discreet to name the port of destination.  But in this instance Commander Dawson smiled and replied:  \"I will not make any secret of our destination so far as I know it. We are bound for some port on the Riviera. It may be Nice, or perhaps Monte Carlo. I am informed that the admiral has not yet decided definitely. I shall be quite ready to tell you, Mr. Metson, as soon as I know.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" courteously acknowledged the lieutenant commander.  During this interval the buzz of conversation had died down. It soon began again.  \"The Riviera!\" exclaimed Ensign Dalzell jubilantly, though in a low tone intended mainly for his chum's ear. \"I have always wanted to see that busy little strip of beach.\"  The Riviera, as will be seen by reference to a map of Southern Europe, is a narrow strip of land, between the mountains and the sea, running around the Gulf of Genoa. One of the most important watering places on this long strip of beach is Nice, on French soil, where multitudes of health and pleasure seekers flock annually. The mild, nearly tropical climate of this place in winter makes Nice one of the most attractive resorts along the Riviera. Only a few miles distant from Nice is the principality of Monte Carlo, an independent state under a prince who is absolute ruler of his tiny country. Monaco is but two and a quarter miles long, while its width varies from a hundred and sixty-five yards to eleven hundred yards. Yet this \"toy country\" is large enough to contain three towns of fair size. The most noted town, Monte Carlo, stands mainly on a cliff, and is the location of the most notorious gambling resort in the world, the \"Casino.\"  \"I wonder,\" suggested one of the younger officers, in a rumbling voice, \"if our Government feels that we officers have more money than we need, and so is sending us to a place where we can get rid of it by gambling. What do you say, Darrin?\"  \"Monte Carlo is one of the noted spots of the world,\" Dave responded slowly, \"and I shall be glad to see a place of which I have heard and read so much. But I shall not gamble at Monte Carlo. I can make better use of my money and of my character.\"  \"Bravo!\" agreed Totten.  \"How long is that strip of beach, the Riviera?\" asked one officer of Lieutenant Commander Wales, the navigating officer.  \"From Nice to Genoa, which is what is commonly understood as the real Riviera,\" replied the navigating officer; \"the distance is one hundred and sixteen miles. But, beyond Genoa, on the other side, the beach continues for fifty-six miles to Spezia. On the strip from Genoa to Spezia the shore is so rocky that it has been found necessary to construct eighty-odd tunnels through the headlands for the railway that runs the whole length of the Riviera.\"  Most of the talk, during that breakfast hour, was about the Riviera, and much of that had to do with Monte Carlo.  \"For years I've wanted very particularly to see that town of Monte Carlo,\" Danny Grin confessed.  \"Not to gamble, I hope,\" replied Dave.  \"Millions for sight-seeing, but not a cent for gambling,\" Dalzell paraphrased lightly.  \"Gentlemen,\" warned Mr. Wales, \"don't be too certain that you'll see Monte Carlo on this cruise. Often the weather is too rough for a landing in that vicinity.\"  \"And in that case?\" queried Lieutenant Totten.  \"In that case,\" replied Wales, \"the usual rule is for the ship to go on to anchorage in the harbor at Genoa.\"  \"Any one know whether the barometer is talking about a storm?\" Dalzell asked.  \"That's a foolish question,\" remarked Lieutenant Barnes grouchily.  \"Hello!\" said Danny Grin, turning half around and eyeing the last speaker. \"You here?\"  \"As usual,\" nodded Barnes gruffly.  \"What was that you said about a foolish question?\" demanded Dan.  \"I was referring to your habit of asking foolish questions,\" retorted Barnes.  \"Do I ask any more of them than you do?\" Dalzell retorted, a bit gruffly.  \"You do,\" Barnes declared, \"and that's one of them.\"  \"If I thought I asked more foolish questions than you do, sir,\" Dan rejoined, laying down his coffee cup, \"I'd--\"  Here Dalzell paused.  \"What would you do?\" Barnes insisted.  \"On second thought,\" Dan went on gravely, \"I don't believe I'll tell you. It was something desperate that I was thinking of.\"  \"Then drop the idea, Dalzell,\" scoffed Lieutenant Barnes lightly. \"You're hardly the fellow we'd look to for desperate deeds.\"  \"Oh, am I not?\" demanded Dan, for once a bit miffed.  Several of the officers glanced up apprehensively. From necessity, life in the ward-room is an oppressively close one at best. A feud between two officers of the mess is enough to make all hands uncomfortable much of the time.  \"Cut it, Barnes,\" ordered the officer sitting on the right-hand side of Lieutenant Barnes. \"Don't start any argument.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" broke in the paymaster, anxious to change the topic of conversation, \"have you gone so far with your meal that a little bad news won't spoil your appetites?\"  Most of those present nodded, smilingly.  \"Then,\" continued the paymaster, \"I wish to bring up a matter that has been discussed here before. You all know that in some way, owing to the carelessness of some one, there is an unexplained shortage of thirty-three dollars in our mess-fund. You appointed Totten and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22431"],["title","Dave Darrin on Mediterranean Service; or, With Dan Dalzell on European Duty (#4)"],["body","a committee to look into the matter. We now beg to report that the thirty-three dollars cannot be accounted for. What is your pleasure in the matter?\"  \"I would call it very simple,\" replied Lieutenant Commander Wales. \"Why not levy an assessment upon the members of this mess sufficient to make up the thirty-three dollars? It will amount to very little apiece.\"  That way of remedying the shortage would have been agreed to promptly, had not Lieutenant Barnes cut in eagerly:  \"I've a better plan for making up the shortage. One man can pay it all, as a penalty, and there will be a lot of fun in deciding which member has to pay the penalty.\"  \"What's the idea, Mr. Barnes?\" asked the executive officer.  \"It's simple enough,\" Barnes went on, grinning. \"Let us set apart the dinner hour on Tuesday evening, say. Every time this mess gets together we hear a lot of foolish questions asked. Now, on Tuesday evening, if any member of this mess asks a question that he can't answer himself, let it be agreed that he pay into the mess a fine of thirty-three dollars to cover the shortage.\"  \"It won't work,\" objected Totten. \"Every officer at this table will be on his guard not to ask any questions at all.\"  \"In that case,\" proposed Barnes, \"let the rule hold over on each successive Tuesday evening until the victim is found and has paid his fine.\"  \"It sounds like sport,\" agreed Dave Darrin.  \"It will be sport to see the victim 'stung' and made to pay up,\" grinned Dan Dalzell.  \"And I think I know, already,\" contended Lieutenant Barnes, \"which officer will pay that shortage.\"  \"Are you looking at me with any particular significance?\" demanded Danny Grin.  \"I am,\" Barnes admitted.  \"Oh, well, then, we shall see what we shall see,\" quoth Dalzell, his color rising.  The scheme for fixing the thirty-three-dollar penalty was quickly agreed upon. In fact, the plan had in it many of the exciting elements of a challenge.  Darrin left the mess to go on duty. Dan found him presently.  \"Say,\" murmured Danny Grin, in an aside, \"do you think Barnes will be very angry when he pays over that thirty-three dollars?\"  \"I haven't yet heard that he is to pay it,\" Dave answered quietly.  \"But he _is_,\" Dalzell asserted.  \"How's that?\"  \"I'm going to make it my business,\" Dan went on, \"to see that Barnes is the victim of the very scheme that he proposed. He will ask a question that he can't answer, and he'll do it when Tuesday evening comes around.\"  \"Don't be too sure of that,\" Dave warned him. \"Barnes may not be exactly the most amiable officer aboard, but at least he's a very keen chap. If you are forming any plans for making Barnes pay, look out, Dan, that your scheme doesn't recoil upon yourself!\"  \"Wait and see,\" Dalzell insisted. \"I tell you, Barnes is going to pay that thirty-three dollars into the mess treasury!\"     CHAPTER III  THE STARTLER AT MONTE CARLO   The frowning crags of Monaco confronted the United States battleship \"Hudson.\"  Here and there the rocky eminences were broken by tiny strips of white beach. In comparison with the crags the great, floating fighting machine looked like a pigmy, indeed.  It was toward evening, and the day was Tuesday. Darrin and Dalzell, both off duty for the time being, strolled along the battleship's quarter-deck, gazing shoreward.  \"It's almost too bad that the times are so civilized,\" murmured Danny Grin. \"That little toy principality would make an ideal pirates' nest.\"  \"I fancy Monaco has done duty enough in that line in the past centuries,\" smiled Darrin. \"I have been reading up a bit on the history of Monaco. Piracy flourished here as late as the fourteenth century. Even rather late in the eighteenth century every ship passing close to this port had to pay toll. And to-day, through its vast gambling establishments, visited by thousands every week, Monaco reaches out and still takes its toll from all the world.\"  \"It won't take any from me,\" smiled Dalzell.  \"That is because you're a disciplined human being, and you've too much character and honesty to gamble,\" Darrin went on. \"But think, with a pitying sigh, of the thousands of poor wretches who journey to Monaco, enter the Casino at Monte Carlo, part with their money and their honor, and then pass into one of the gardens, there to blow their brains out.  \"We shall get a glimpse of the place to-night,\" Dave continued. \"I will admit that I have a good deal of curiosity to see it. So I am glad that we have shore leave effective after dinner. Still, we shan't see anything like the crowd or the picture that we might see if Europe were at peace.\"  \"This is Tuesday night,\" Dan warned his chum.  \"Yes; the night to avoid dangerous questions at mess,\" Dave smiled. \"Dan, are you still going to try to catch Barnes?\"  \"Watch me,\" winked Dalzell.  \"Look out, Dan! Such a trap may be set at both ends.\"  But Dalzell winked once more, then allowed his mouth to expand in that contortion which had won him the nick name of \"Danny Grin.\"  Dave soon forgot Dalzell's threat of trouble for the evening. It had passed out of his mind by the time that Ensign Darrin entered the ward-room. Yet soon after the officers had seated themselves the executive officer announced:  \"In the interest of fair play to all I deem it best to warn you, gentlemen, that to-night is the night when the first gentleman who asks a question that he cannot himself answer is liable to a penalty of thirty-three dollars to make up the deficit in the mess treasury.\"  There were nods and grins, and shakings of heads. Not an officer present had any idea that _he_ could be caught and made to pay the penalty.  As the meal progressed Lieutenant Commander Wales finally turned to one of the Filipino waiters and inquired:  \"Is there any of the rare roast beef left?\"  \"Don't you know yourself, Wales?\" demanded Totten quickly.  \"Why, er--no-o,\" admitted Mr. Wales, looking much puzzled. \"Why should I?\"  \"Then haven't you asked a question that you can't answer?\" demanded Totten mischievously.  \"That's hardly a fair catch, is it?\" demanded the navigating officer, looking annoyed.  \"It is not a fair catch,\" broke in the executive officer incisively. \"Any gentleman here has a perfect right to ask the waiter questions about the food supply without taking chances of being subjected to a penalty.\"  \"I bow to the decision, sir,\" replied Lieutenant Totten. \"I merely wished to have the question settled.\"  Some of those present breathed more easily; others yet dreaded to become victims of a penalty proposition that many now regretted having voted for.  As the dessert came on Dan Dalzell turned to Dave.  \"Darrin,\" he said, \"can you tell me why it is that a woodchuck never leaves any dirt heaped up around the edge of his hole?\"  Dave reflected, looking puzzled for a moment. Then he shook his head as he answered:  \"Dalzell, I'm afraid I don't know why.\"  \"Of course _you_ know why, Dalzell,\" broke in Lieutenant Barnes warningly.  \"Perhaps I do know,\" Dan replied, nodding his head slowly. \"However, perhaps some other gentleman would like the chance of answering the question.\"  Instantly a dozen at least of the officers became interested in answering the question. To each reply or guess, however, Dalzell shook his head.  \"If everyone who wants it has had a try at the answer,\" suggested the executive officer, \"then we will call upon Mr. Dalzell to inform us why a woodchuck, in digging his hole, leaves no dirt piled up around the entrance.\"  There was silence while Dan replied easily:  \"It's perfectly simple. Instead of beginning at the surface of the ground and digging downward, the woodchuck begins at the bottom of the hole and digs up toward the light and air.\"  As Dalzell offered this explanation he faced Lieutenant Barnes, who was eying him scoffingly.  When Dan had finished his explanation there was a puzzled silence for an instant. But Dan's half-leer irritated Lieutenant Barnes. Then came the explosion.  \"Shaw!\" snorted Barnes. \"That's an explanation that doesn't explain anything. It's a fool answer. How does the woodchuck, if he digs up from the bottom of the hole, ever manage to get to the bottom of the hole to make his start there?\"  \"Oh, well,\" answered Dan slowly, \"that's your question, Mr. Barnes.\"  \"My question?\" retorted the lieutenant. \"What do you mean?\"  \"If I understand aright,\" Dan went on, \"you asked how the woodchuck manages to get to the bottom of the hole before he begins to dig.\"  \"That's right,\" nodded the lieutenant, stiffly.  \"That's just the idea,\" Dan grinned. \"I am calling upon you to answer the question that you just asked. You must tell us how the woodchuck manages to get to the bottom of the hole in order to start digging upward.\"  It required perhaps two seconds for the joke to dawn on the other officers at the long mess table. Then an explosion of laughter sounded, and every eye was turned toward Lieutenant Barnes.  \"That isn't fair!\" roared the lieutenant, leaping to his feet. \"That was a trap! It wasn't a fair catch.\"  Barnes's face was very red. His voice quivered with indignation.  But Dan Dalzell was smiling coolly as he retorted:  \"I'll leave it to the mess if Barnes hasn't asked a question that he can't answer.\"  \"You're caught, Barnes!\" roared half a dozen voices, and more laughter followed.  \"You asked a question, Barnes, and you can't answer it,\" came from others.  \"That thirty-three dollars will come in handy,\" called another.  \"Pay up like a man, Barnes.\"  \"That's right. Pay up! You're caught.\"  The lieutenant's face grew redder, but he sat down and tried to control his wrath.  \"It doesn't seem like a fairly incurred penalty,\" declared Barnes, as soon as he could make himself heard, \"but of course I'll abide by the decision of the mess.\"  \"Then I move,\" suggested Wales, \"that we leave the question to a committee of three to decide whether Mr. Barnes has been properly caught in the fine that he himself was the one to propose. For committee I would suggest the executive officer,"]]]
