It w'u'dn't stop 'em, an' we'd hev killed somebody. Stay hyar--hold 'em back long as yer kin.\"  \"Pwhat are ye goin' ter do?\"  \"Git ther prisoner up onter ther roof. Mebbe we kin hold 'em back from gittin' up thar.\"  \"All roight. Oi'll do me bist here.\"  Kildare ran back along the corridor and disappeared.  Of a sudden rocks began to whistle about Barney's head, and then one struck him, knocking him down. The nozzle of the hose fell from his hands, and he lay prone and motionless on the floor.  Wild yells of savage delight broke from the mob.  Then, with a clatter of hoofs, a band of masked horsemen came tearing down the street, whirled into the open space before the jail, and began shooting into the mob. The horsemen were dressed in black, and every man was masked.  \"It's Black Harry's Braves!\" screamed a voice that was full of fear.  Twenty voices took up the cry, and the mob, utterly demoralized, broke and ran in all directions.  Some of the masked horsemen sprang from their animals and dashed into the jail, springing over the prostrate body of the unconscious Irish lad.  Kildare was removing Frank from his cell when those masked men came upon them. In a moment the boy had been torn from the sheriff, and the men whirled him away.  Out of the jail rushed Black Harry's Braves, the boy was placed astride a horse, and away they went, with him in their midst.  Frank had believed them lynchers, and he thought them lynchers as they bore him away.  \"It's all up with me,\" he mentally said.  But his hands were free, and he was watching for an opportunity to escape. He meant to make one more effort for life, if given an opportunity.  Through the town tore the wild horsemen, yelling like so many fiends, shooting to the right and left.  Out of Elreno they rode, and then the man on the right of Frank leaned toward the boy, saying:  \"We came just in time, chief. If we'd been ten minutes later, the lynchers would have had you sure.\"  \"The lynchers?\" gasped the bewildered boy. \"Why, you----\"  \"They had the door down when we reached the jail, but a dozen shots set them scattering.\"  \"But--but--I don't understand.\"  \"We didn't mean to strike before midnight, but Benson brought word that they were liable to lynch you, and so we lost no time in getting here. We rode twenty miles like we were racing with an express train. You must allow we did a good job this time, chief.\"  \"Chief? Why I----\"  Frank stopped short, choking the words back. At last he realized who these men were.  They were Black Harry's Braves, and they believed him to be Black Harry!  He reeled upon the horse he bestrode.  \"What's the matter?\" asked the man, quickly. \"Are you hurt any way?\"  \"No.\"  The boy's voice was hoarse and unnatural.  \"What can I do?\" he thought. \"How long will it be before they discover their mistake? I must keep up the deception, and I may find an opportunity to escape.\"  In a moment he had recovered his composure. As old readers know, Frank was a boy of nerve, and he began to feel very well satisfied with the situation.  \"I have escaped lynching,\" he thought, \"and these men believe me their leader. I am out of jail and now I shall be given a chance to fight for my life and honor. In order to prove my own innocence, I must capture Black Harry. This may lead me to the opportunity.\"  But for one thing his heart would have been filled with exultation. That one thing was the memory of Barney Mulloy, whom he had seen lying prone and motionless just within the broken door of the jail. Had they killed his faithful friend?  He feared the Irish lad had met death while trying to hold back the lynchers.  The outlaws did not seem to fear pursuit, and they slackened their pace somewhat as soon as they were out of town.  \"Where shall we go, chief?\" asked one.  Frank was at a loss to answer, for he knew that a slip might betray him, and he was determined to be on his guard all the time. His hesitation was observed, and the man said:  \"I reckon it will be safe to return to Cade's Canyon for a while.\"  \"I reckon so,\" said Frank. \"We'll go there.\"  \"I warned you that you would make a mistake if you ventured into Elreno,\" said the talkative outlaw, \"but you were determined to have another look at that girl, and so you took chances. Girls have caused more trouble in this world than everything else combined.\"  \"That's right,\" admitted Frank, who was wondering what girl the fellow meant.  \"Did you see her?\" asked the man, with a sly chuckle.  \"Oh, yes, of course.\"  \"Ha, ha! I like the way you say that, chief. No offense, but Benson said you saw her in the railway station as soon as you landed in Elreno.\"  Now Frank knew that Lona Dawson was meant.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"she was there, and she informed the public in general that she had seen me before.\"  \"I don't suppose you will bother with her any more, and so we'll move on as soon as possible, and get out of this part of the country? It's getting right hot here.\"  \"It is all of that,\" admitted Frank; \"but I am not for running away, as if we were scared out.\"  \"Well, you know our original plan.\"  \"Certainly.\"  Frank spoke as if he knew it well enough, but he was wondering what it could be. However, the man soon explained.  \"We are to carry the expedition through into Indian Territory, and disband when the Arkansas line is reached. Then we can scatter and defy pursuit, and we can come together at Ochiltree, in the Panhandle, at the time set.\"  Frank felt like thanking the fellow for the information.  \"That's right,\" nodded the boy, speaking carefully; \"but this little affair has made me rather mad, and I don't feel like running away so very fast.\"  \"Especially from the girl.\"  \"Hang the girl!\"  Frank felt that it would not do to allow the fellow to become so familiar.  \"You didn't talk that way after seeing her last night. Why, you were sorry we didn't carry her off when we left the train.\"  \"Oh, well, a fellow has a right to change his mind. I have seen her by daylight.\"  \"And she didn't look so well?\"  \"Hardly.\"  \"Still, she is something of a daisy.\"  \"She'll do; but I can't waste my time with her. There are others.\"  \"Now you're beginning to talk right, chief. The boys felt a little doubtful of you when you went racing off after that girl, and they will be mightily relieved to know you have come to your senses.\"  Frank grunted, but spoke no word. During the entire ride, he talked as little as possible, but he kept his ears open.     CHAPTER X.  IN CADE'S CANYON.   The moon had swung far down to the west when the outlaws entered Cade's Canyon amid the mountains and finally reached an old hut, where they halted.  \"You must be rather pegged, chief,\" said one of the men, addressing Frank.  \"Well, I am not feeling too frisky,\" said the boy. \"I didn't sleep much in Elreno jail, for I wanted to be wideawake when the lynchers came.\"  The men had removed their masks, but their faces were shaded by wide-brimmed hats, and Frank was not able to study their features. However, he had heard the voices of several, and he felt sure he would not forget them.  He was not going to be in a hurry about escaping. There was plenty of time, and he was beginning to believe that he must be the perfect double of Black Harry, else why should these men be thus deceived?  He wondered if none of them would detect the difference when daylight came.  \"If they do--well, I can't be worse off than I was in Elreno jail. I'll have weapons, and I can fight. I may be able to make it hot for them before they down me.\"  Frank was reckless, and he felt a strange delight in the adventure through which he was passing. Somehow, now that he had escaped being lynched, he believed he would be successful in bringing Black Harry to book and proving his own innocence.  Frank's first care was to obtain some revolvers, and he was soon in possession of a pair of fine weapons. With these loaded and ready to his hand, he breathed easier.  Of course he had no idea of sleeping, but he entered the hut and looked the place over.  Morning was not far away, and the time soon passed, while Frank pretended to sleep. At daybreak he was astir, and looking the place over.  The cabin was built in a strange spot, standing close to the verge of a chasm that opened down into the lower depths of the canyon, through which ran a stream of water.  Dan Cade, the man who had built the cabin there, was said to have been crazy. He had lived there years before the opening of Oklahoma to settlement, and had died there in that wild gorge. His only friends were the Indians, as he hated and mistrusted his own race.  It had often been remarked by those who passed through the canyon that no man in his right mind would have built a cabin in such a place. It looked as if the building was crouching on the verge of the chasm, preparing to spring headlong into the creek below.  Here the outlaws had camped.  Frank found a flight of stairs that led to the cabin loft. They were shaky, but he ascended to investigate.  There was a square door, shaped like a window, at the back end of the cabin, and this the boy opened. He thrust his head out, and found he was looking down the face of the bluff straight into the stream far below.  The light that shone into the loft revealed, to the boy's surprise and wonder, a coil of rope. He examined this, and found a stout clasp-hook at one end. The other end of the rope was made fast to a rafter.  For some time Frank wondered to what use old Cade had put the rope, but it came to him at last.  \"With this he drew his water from the stream down there.\"  This seemed evident, as there was no other apparent means of procuring water.  The outlaws slept heavily, apparently fatigued by their exertions of the night. They had left sentinels in both directions, up and down the canyon, so that they could not be taken by surprise should they be followed by enemies.  The sun had not risen when Frank went forth into the morning air.

BY  CHARLES SUMNER.  _Fifth Edition._  FREDERICK KEPPEL & CO.  NEW YORK, 20 EAST 16th STREET.  LONDON, PARIS,  3 DUKE STREET, ADELPHI. 27 QUAI DE L'HORLOGE.  Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by  FREDERICK KEPPEL,  In the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington.     THE BEST PORTRAITS IN ENGRAVING.     Engraving is one of the fine arts, and in this beautiful family has been the especial handmaiden of painting. Another sister is now coming forward to join this service, lending to it the charm of color. If, in our day, the \"chromo\" can do more than engraving, it cannot impair the value of the early masters. With them there is no rivalry or competition. Historically, as well as æsthetically, they will be masters always.  Everybody knows something of engraving, as of printing, with which it was associated in origin. School-books, illustrated papers, and shop windows are the ordinary opportunities open to all. But while creating a transient interest, or, perhaps, quickening the taste, they furnish little with regard to the art itself, especially in other days. And yet, looking at an engraving, like looking at a book, may be the beginning of a new pleasure and a new study.  Each person has his own story. Mine is simple. Suffering from continued prostration, disabling me from the ordinary activities of life, I turned to engravings for employment and pastime. With the invaluable assistance of that devoted connoisseur, the late Dr. Thies, I went through the Gray collection at Cambridge, enjoying it like a picture-gallery. Other collections in our country were examined also. Then, in Paris, while undergoing severe medical treatment, my daily medicine for weeks was the vast cabinet of engravings, then called Imperial, now National, counted by the million, where was everything to please or instruct. Thinking of those kindly portfolios, I make this record of gratitude, as to benefactors. Perhaps some other invalid, seeking occupation without burden, may find in them the solace that I did. Happily, it is not necessary to visit Paris for the purpose. Other collections, on a smaller scale, will furnish the same remedy.  In any considerable collection, portraits occupy an important place. Their multitude may be inferred when I mention that, in one series of portfolios, in the Paris cabinet, I counted no less than forty-seven portraits of Franklin and forty-three of Lafayette, with an equal number of Washington, while all the early Presidents were numerously represented. But, in this large company, there are very few possessing artistic value. The great portraits of modern times constitute a very short list, like the great poems or histories, and it is the same with engravings as with pictures. Sir Joshua Reynolds, explaining the difference between an historical painter and a portrait-painter, remarks that the former \"paints men in general, a portrait-painter a particular man, and consequently a defective model.\"[1] A portrait, therefore, may be an accurate presentment of its subject without æsthetic value.  But here, as in other things, genius exercises its accustomed sway without limitation. Even the difficulties of a \"defective model\" did not prevent Raffaelle, Titian, Rembrandt, Rubens, Velasquez, or Vandyck from producing portraits precious in the history of art. It would be easy to mention heads by Raffaelle, yielding in value to only two or three of his larger masterpieces, like the Dresden Madonna. Charles the Fifth stooped to pick up the pencil of Titian, saying \"it becomes Cæsar to serve Titian!\" True enough; but this unprecedented compliment from the imperial successor of Charlemagne attests the glory of the portrait-painter. The female figures of Titian, so much admired under the names of Flora, La Bella, his daughter, his mistress, and even his Venus, were portraits from life. Rembrandt turned from his great triumphs in his own peculiar school to portraits of unwonted power; so also did Rubens, showing that in this department his universality of conquest was not arrested. To these must be added Velasquez and Vandyck, each of infinite genius, who won fame especially as portrait-painters. And what other title has Sir Joshua himself?  [Sidenote: Suyderhoef.]  Historical pictures are often collections of portraits arranged so as to illustrate an important event. Such is the famous PEACE OF MÜNSTER, by Terburg, just presented by a liberal Englishman to the National Gallery at London. Here are the plenipotentiaries of Holland, Spain, and Austria, uniting in the great treaty which constitutes an epoch in the Law of Nations. The engraving by Suyderhoef is rare and interesting. Similar in character is the Death of Chatham, by Copley, where the illustrious statesman is surrounded by the peers he had been addressing--every one a portrait. To this list must be added the pictures by Trumbull in the Rotunda of the Capitol at Washington, especially the Declaration of Independence, in which Thackeray took a sincere interest. Standing before these, the author and artist said to me, \"These are the best pictures in the country,\" and he proceeded to remark on their honesty and fidelity; but doubtless their real value is in their portraits.  Unquestionably the finest assemblage of portraits anywhere is that of the artists occupying two halls in the gallery at Florence, being autographs contributed by the masters themselves. Here is Raffaelle, with chestnut-brown hair, and dark eyes full of sensibility, painted when he was twenty-three, and known by the engraving of Forster--Julio Romano, in black and red chalk on paper,--Massaccio, called the father of painting, much admired--Leonardo da Vinci, beautiful and grand,--Titian, rich and splendid,--Pietro Perugino, remarkable for execution and expression,--Albert Dürer, rigid but masterly,--Gerhard Dow, finished according to his own exacting style,--and Reynolds, with fresh English face; but these are only examples of this incomparable collection, which was begun as far back as the Cardinal Leopold de Medici, and has been happily continued to the present time. Here are the lions, painted by themselves, except, perhaps, the foremost of all, Michael Angelo, whose portrait seems the work of another. The impression from this collection is confirmed by that of any group of historic artists. Their portraits excel those of statesmen, soldiers, or divines, as is easily seen by engravings accessible to all. The engraved heads in Arnold Houbraken's biographies of the Dutch and Flemish painters, in three volumes, are a family of rare beauty.[2]  The relation of engraving to painting is often discussed; but nobody has treated it with more knowledge or sentiment than the consummate engraver Longhi in his interesting work, _La Calcografia_.[3] Dwelling on the general aid it renders to the lovers of art, he claims for it greater merit in \"publishing and immortalizing the portraits of eminent men for the example of the present and future generations;\" and, \"better than any other art, serving as the vehicle for the most extended and remote propagation of deserved celebrity.\" Even great monuments in porphyry and bronze are less durable than these light and fragile impressions subject to all the chances of wind, water, and fire, but prevailing by their numbers where the mass succumbs. In other words, it is with engravings as with books; nor is this the only resemblance between them. According to Longhi, an engraving is not a copy or imitation, as is sometimes insisted, but a translation. The engraver translates into another language, where light and shade supply the place of colors. The duplication of a book in the same language is a copy, and so is the duplication of a picture in the same material. Evidently an engraving is not a copy; it does not reproduce the original picture, except in drawing and expression; nor is it a mere imitation, but, as Bryant's Homer and Longfellow's Dante are presentations of the great originals in another language, so is the engraving a presentation of painting in another material which is like another language.  Thus does the engraver vindicate his art. But nobody can examine a choice print without feeling that it has a merit of its own different from any picture, and inferior only to a good picture. A work of Raffaelle, or any of the great masters, is better in an engraving of Longhi or Morghen than in any ordinary copy, and would probably cost more in the market. A good engraving is an undoubted work of art, but this cannot be said of many pictures, which, like Peter Pindar's razors, seem made to sell.  Much that belongs to the painter belongs also to the engraver, who must have the same knowledge of contours, the same power of expression, the same sense of beauty, and the same ability in drawing with sureness of sight as if, according to Michael Angelo, he had \"a pair of compasses in his eyes.\" These qualities in a high degree make the artist, whether painter or engraver, naturally excelling in portraits. But choice portraits are less numerous in engraving than in painting, for the reason, that painting does not always find a successful translator.  [Illustration: PHILIP MELANCTHON.  (Engraved by Albert Dürer from his own Design.)]  [Sidenote: Dürer.]  The earliest engraved portraits which attract attention are by Albert Dürer, who engraved his own work, translating himself. His eminence as painter was continued as engraver. Here he surpassed his predecessors, Martin Schoen in Germany, and Mantegna in Italy, so that Longhi does not hesitate to say that he was the first who carried the art from infancy in which he found it to a condition not far from flourishing adolescence. But, while recognizing his great place in the history of engraving, it is impossible not to see that he is often hard and constrained, if not unfinished. His portrait of ERASMUS is justly famous, and is conspicuous among the prints"]]]
