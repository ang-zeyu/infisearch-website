Only you must go to bed first. I can't take you till you're in bed. That's the law about the children. So I had better go and do something else first.”  “Very well, North Wind,” said Diamond. “What are you going to do first, if you please?”  “I think I may tell you. Jump up on the top of the wall, there.”  “I can't.”  “Ah! and I can't help you--you haven't been to bed yet, you see. Come out to the road with me, just in front of the coach-house, and I will show you.”  North Wind grew very small indeed, so small that she could not have blown the dust off a dusty miller, as the Scotch children call a yellow auricula. Diamond could not even see the blades of grass move as she flitted along by his foot. They left the lawn, went out by the wicket in the-coach-house gates, and then crossed the road to the low wall that separated it from the river.  “You can get up on this wall, Diamond,” said North Wind.  “Yes; but my mother has forbidden me.”  “Then don't,” said North Wind.  “But I can see over,” said Diamond.  “Ah! to be sure. I can't.”  So saying, North Wind gave a little bound, and stood on the top of the wall. She was just about the height a dragon-fly would be, if it stood on end.  “You darling!” said Diamond, seeing what a lovely little toy-woman she was.  “Don't be impertinent, Master Diamond,” said North Wind. “If there's one thing makes me more angry than another, it is the way you humans judge things by their size. I am quite as respectable now as I shall be six hours after this, when I take an East Indiaman by the royals, twist her round, and push her under. You have no right to address me in such a fashion.”  But as she spoke, the tiny face wore the smile of a great, grand woman. She was only having her own beautiful fun out of Diamond, and true woman's fun never hurts.  “But look there!” she resumed. “Do you see a boat with one man in it--a green and white boat?”  “Yes; quite well.”  “That's a poet.”  “I thought you said it was a bo-at.”  “Stupid pet! Don't you know what a poet is?”  “Why, a thing to sail on the water in.”  “Well, perhaps you're not so far wrong. Some poets do carry people over the sea. But I have no business to talk so much. The man is a poet.”  “The boat is a boat,” said Diamond.  “Can't you spell?” asked North Wind.  “Not very well.”  “So I see. A poet is not a bo-at, as you call it. A poet is a man who is glad of something, and tries to make other people glad of it too.”  “Ah! now I know. Like the man in the sweety-shop.”  “Not very. But I see it is no use. I wasn't sent to tell you, and so I can't tell you. I must be off. Only first just look at the man.”  “He's not much of a rower” said Diamond--“paddling first with one fin and then with the other.”  “Now look here!” said North Wind.  And she flashed like a dragon-fly across the water, whose surface rippled and puckered as she passed. The next moment the man in the boat glanced about him, and bent to his oars. The boat flew over the rippling water. Man and boat and river were awake. The same instant almost, North Wind perched again upon the river wall.  “How did you do that?” asked Diamond.  “I blew in his face,” answered North Wind. “I don't see how that could do it,” said Diamond. “I daresay not. And therefore you will say you don't believe it could.”  “No, no, dear North Wind. I know you too well not to believe you.”  “Well, I blew in his face, and that woke him up.”  “But what was the good of it?”  “Why! don't you see? Look at him--how he is pulling. I blew the mist out of him.”  “How was that?”  “That is just what I cannot tell you.”  “But you did it.”  “Yes. I have to do ten thousand things without being able to tell how.”  “I don't like that,” said Diamond.  He was staring after the boat. Hearing no answer, he looked down to the wall.  North Wind was gone. Away across the river went a long ripple--what sailors call a cat's paw. The man in the boat was putting up a sail. The moon was coming to herself on the edge of a great cloud, and the sail began to shine white. Diamond rubbed his eyes, and wondered what it was all about. Things seemed going on around him, and all to understand each other, but he could make nothing of it. So he put his hands in his pockets, and went in to have his tea. The night was very hot, for the wind had fallen again.  “You don't seem very well to-night, Diamond,” said his mother.  “I am quite well, mother,” returned Diamond, who was only puzzled.  “I think you had better go to bed,” she added.  “Very well, mother,” he answered.  He stopped for one moment to look out of the window. Above the moon the clouds were going different ways. Somehow or other this troubled him, but, notwithstanding, he was soon fast asleep.  He woke in the middle of the night and the darkness. A terrible noise was rumbling overhead, like the rolling beat of great drums echoing through a brazen vault. The roof of the loft in which he lay had no ceiling; only the tiles were between him and the sky. For a while he could not come quite awake, for the noise kept beating him down, so that his heart was troubled and fluttered painfully. A second peal of thunder burst over his head, and almost choked him with fear. Nor did he recover until the great blast that followed, having torn some tiles off the roof, sent a spout of wind down into his bed and over his face, which brought him wide awake, and gave him back his courage. The same moment he heard a mighty yet musical voice calling him.  “Come up, Diamond,” it said. “It's all ready. I'm waiting for you.”  He looked out of the bed, and saw a gigantic, powerful, but most lovely arm--with a hand whose fingers were nothing the less ladylike that they could have strangled a boa-constrictor, or choked a tigress off its prey--stretched down through a big hole in the roof. Without a moment's hesitation he reached out his tiny one, and laid it in the grand palm before him.     CHAPTER VI. OUT IN THE STORM   THE hand felt its way up his arm, and, grasping it gently and strongly above the elbow, lifted Diamond from the bed. The moment he was through the hole in the roof, all the winds of heaven seemed to lay hold upon him, and buffet him hither and thither. His hair blew one way, his night-gown another, his legs threatened to float from under him, and his head to grow dizzy with the swiftness of the invisible assailant. Cowering, he clung with the other hand to the huge hand which held his arm, and fear invaded his heart.  “Oh, North Wind!” he murmured, but the words vanished from his lips as he had seen the soap-bubbles that burst too soon vanish from the mouth of his pipe. The wind caught them, and they were nowhere. They couldn't get out at all, but were torn away and strangled. And yet North Wind heard them, and in her answer it seemed to Diamond that just because she was so big and could not help it, and just because her ear and her mouth must seem to him so dreadfully far away, she spoke to him more tenderly and graciously than ever before. Her voice was like the bass of a deep organ, without the groan in it; like the most delicate of violin tones without the wail in it; like the most glorious of trumpet-ejaculations without the defiance in it; like the sound of falling water without the clatter and clash in it: it was like all of them and neither of them--all of them without their faults, each of them without its peculiarity: after all, it was more like his mother's voice than anything else in the world.  “Diamond, dear,” she said, “be a man. What is fearful to you is not the least fearful to me.”  “But it can't hurt you,” murmured Diamond, “for you're it.”  “Then if I'm it, and have you in my arms, how can it hurt you?”  “Oh yes! I see,” whispered Diamond. “But it looks so dreadful, and it pushes me about so.”  “Yes, it does, my dear. That is what it was sent for.”  At the same moment, a peal of thunder which shook Diamond's heart against the sides of his bosom hurtled out of the heavens: I cannot say out of the sky, for there was no sky. Diamond had not seen the lightning, for he had been intent on finding the face of North Wind. Every moment the folds of her garment would sweep across his eyes and blind him, but between, he could just persuade himself that he saw great glories of woman's eyes looking down through rifts in the mountainous clouds over his head.  He trembled so at the thunder, that his knees failed him, and he sunk down at North Wind's feet, and clasped her round the column of her ankle. She instantly stooped, lifted him from the roof--up--up into her bosom, and held him there, saying, as if to an inconsolable child--  “Diamond, dear, this will never do.”  “Oh yes, it will,” answered Diamond. “I am all right now--quite comfortable, I assure you, dear North Wind. If you will only let me stay here, I shall be all right indeed.”  “But you will feel the wind here, Diamond.”  “I don't mind that a bit, so long as I feel your arms through it,”  answered Diamond, nestling closer to her grand bosom.  “Brave boy!” returned North Wind, pressing him closer.  “No,” said Diamond, “I don't see that. It's not courage at all, so long as I feel you there.”  “But hadn't you better get into my hair? Then you would not feel the wind; you will here.”  “Ah, but, dear North Wind, you don't know how nice it is to feel your arms about me. It is a thousand times better to have them and the wind together, than to have only your hair and the back of your neck and no wind at all.”  “But it is surely more comfortable there?”  “Well, perhaps; but I begin to think there are better things than being comfortable.”  “Yes, indeed there are. Well, I will keep you in front of me. You will feel the wind, but not too much. I shall only want one arm to take care of you; the other will be quite enough to sink the ship.”  “Oh, dear North Wind! how can you talk so?”  “My dear boy, I never talk; I always mean what I say.”  “Then"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/225"],["title","At the Back of the North Wind (#8)"],["body","do mean to sink the ship with the other hand?”  “Yes.”  “It's not like you.”  “How do you know that?”  “Quite easily. Here you are taking care of a poor little boy with one arm, and there you are sinking a ship with the other. It can't be like you.”  “Ah! but which is me? I can't be two mes, you know.”  “No. Nobody can be two mes.”  “Well, which me is me?”  “Now I must think. There looks to be two.”  “Yes. That's the very point.--You can't be knowing the thing you don't know, can you?”  “No.”  “Which me do you know?”  “The kindest, goodest, best me in the world,” answered Diamond, clinging to North Wind.  “Why am I good to you?”  “I don't know.”  “Have you ever done anything for me?”  “No.”  “Then I must be good to you because I choose to be good to you.”  “Yes.”  “Why should I choose?”  “Because--because--because you like.”  “Why should I like to be good to you?”  “I don't know, except it be because it's good to be good to me.”  “That's just it; I am good to you because I like to be good.”  “Then why shouldn't you be good to other people as well as to me?”  “That's just what I don't know. Why shouldn't I?”  “I don't know either. Then why shouldn't you?”  “Because I am.”  “There it is again,” said Diamond. “I don't see that you are. It looks quite the other thing.”  “Well, but listen to me, Diamond. You know the one me, you say, and that is good.”  “Yes.”  “Do you know the other me as well?”  “No. I can't. I shouldn't like to.”  “There it is. You don't know the other me. You are sure of one of them?”  “Yes.”  “And you are sure there can't be two mes?”  “Yes.”  “Then the me you don't know must be the same as the me you do know,--else there would be two mes?”  “Yes.”  “Then the other me you don't know must be as kind as the me you do know?”  “Yes.”  “Besides, I tell you that it is so, only it doesn't look like it. That I confess freely. Have you anything more to object?”  “No, no, dear North Wind; I am quite satisfied.”  “Then I will tell you something you might object. You might say that the me you know is like the other me, and that I am cruel all through.”  “I know that can't be, because you are so kind.”  “But that kindness might be only a pretence for the sake of being more cruel afterwards.”  Diamond clung to her tighter than ever, crying--  “No, no, dear North Wind; I can't believe that. I don't believe it. I won't believe it. That would kill me. I love you, and you must love me, else how did I come to love you? How could you know how to put on such a beautiful face if you did not love me and the rest? No. You may sink as many ships as you like, and I won't say another word. I can't say I shall like to see it, you know.”  “That's quite another thing,” said North Wind; and as she spoke she gave one spring from the roof of the hay-loft, and rushed up into the clouds, with Diamond on her left arm close to her heart. And as if the clouds knew she had come, they burst into a fresh jubilation of thunderous light. For a few moments, Diamond seemed to be borne up through the depths of an ocean of dazzling flame; the next, the winds were writhing around him like a storm of serpents. For they were in the midst of the clouds and mists, and they of course took the shapes of the wind, eddying and wreathing and whirling and shooting and dashing about like grey and black water, so that it was as if the wind itself had taken shape, and he saw the grey and black wind tossing and raving most madly all about him. Now it blinded him by smiting him upon the eyes; now it deafened him by bellowing in his ears; for even when the thunder came he knew now that it was the billows of the great ocean of the air dashing against each other in their haste to fill the hollow scooped out by the lightning; now it took his breath quite away by sucking it from his body with the speed of its rush. But he did not mind it. He only gasped first and then laughed, for the arm of North Wind was about him, and he was leaning against her bosom. It is quite impossible for me to describe what he saw. Did you ever watch a great wave shoot into a winding passage amongst rocks? If you ever did, you would see that the water rushed every way at once, some of it even turning back and opposing the rest; greater confusion you might see nowhere except in a crowd of frightened people. Well, the wind was like that, except that it went much faster, and therefore was much wilder, and twisted and shot and curled and dodged and clashed and raved ten times more madly than anything else in creation except human passions. Diamond saw the threads of the lady's hair streaking it all. In parts indeed he could not tell which was hair and which was black storm and vapour. It seemed sometimes that all the great billows of mist-muddy wind were woven out of the crossing lines of North Wind's infinite hair, sweeping in endless intertwistings. And Diamond felt as the wind seized on his hair, which his mother kept rather long, as if he too was a part of the storm, and some of its life went out from him. But so sheltered was he by North Wind's arm and bosom that only at times, in the fiercer onslaught of some curl-billowed eddy, did he recognise for a moment how wild was the storm in which he was carried, nestling in its very core and formative centre.  It seemed to Diamond likewise that they were motionless in this centre, and that all the confusion and fighting went on around them. Flash after flash illuminated the fierce chaos, revealing in varied yellow and blue and grey and dusky red the vapourous contention; peal after peal of thunder tore the infinite waste; but it seemed to Diamond that North Wind and he were motionless, all but the hair. It was not so. They were sweeping with the speed of the wind itself towards the sea.     CHAPTER VII. THE CATHEDRAL   I MUST not go on describing what cannot be described, for nothing is more wearisome.  Before they reached the sea, Diamond felt North Wind's hair just beginning to fall about him.  “Is the storm over, North Wind?” he called out.  “No, Diamond. I am only waiting a moment to set you down. You would not like to see the ship sunk, and I am going to give you a place to stop in till I come back for you.”  “Oh! thank you,” said Diamond. “I shall be sorry to leave you, North Wind, but I would rather not see the ship go down. And I'm afraid the poor people will cry, and I should hear them. Oh, dear!”  “There are a good many passengers on board; and to tell the truth, Diamond, I don't care about your hearing the cry you speak of. I am afraid you would not get it out of your little head again for a long time.”  “But how can you bear it then, North Wind? For I am sure you are kind. I shall never doubt that again.”  “I will tell you how I am able to bear it, Diamond: I am always hearing, through every noise, through all the noise I am making myself even, the sound of a far-off song. I do not exactly know where it is, or what it means; and I don't hear much of it, only the odour of its music, as it were, flitting across the great billows of the ocean outside this air in which I make such a storm; but what I do hear is quite enough to make me able to bear the cry from the drowning ship. So it would you if you could hear it.”  “No, it wouldn't,” returned Diamond, stoutly. “For they wouldn't hear the music of the far-away song; and if they did, it wouldn't do them any good. You see you and I are not going to be drowned, and so we might enjoy it.”  “But you have never heard the psalm, and you don't know what it is like. Somehow, I can't say how, it tells me that all is right; that it is coming to swallow up all cries.”  “But that won't do them any good--the people, I mean,” persisted Diamond.  “It must. It must,” said North Wind, hurriedly. “It wouldn't be the song it seems to be if it did not swallow up all their fear and pain too, and set them singing it themselves with the rest. I am sure it will. And do you know, ever since I knew I had hair, that is, ever since it began to go out and away, that song has been coming nearer and nearer. Only I must say it was some thousand years before I heard it.”  “But how can you say it was coming nearer when you did not hear it?”  asked doubting little Diamond.  “Since I began to hear it, I know it is growing louder, therefore I judge it was coming nearer and nearer until I did hear it first. I'm not so very old, you know--a few thousand years only--and I was quite a baby when I heard the noise first, but I knew it must come from the voices of people ever so much older and wiser than I was. I can't sing at all, except now and then, and I can never tell what my song is going to be; I only know what it is after I have sung it.--But this will never do. Will you stop here?”  “I can't see anywhere to stop,” said Diamond. “Your hair is all down like a darkness, and I can't see through it if I knock my eyes into it ever so much.”  “Look, then,” said North Wind; and, with one sweep of her great white arm, she swept yards deep of darkness like a great curtain from before the face of the boy.  And lo! it was a blue night, lit up with stars. Where it did not shine with stars it shimmered with the milk of the stars, except where, just opposite to Diamond's face, the grey towers of a cathedral blotted out each its own shape of sky and stars.  “Oh! what's that?” cried Diamond, struck with a kind of terror, for he had never seen a cathedral, and it rose before him with an awful reality in the midst of the wide spaces, conquering emptiness with grandeur.  “A very good place for you to wait in,” said North Wind. “But we shall go in, and you shall judge for yourself.”  There was an open door in the middle of one of the towers, leading out upon the roof, and through it they passed. Then North Wind set Diamond on his feet, and he found himself at the top of a stone stair, which went twisting away down into the darkness for only a little light came in at the door. It was enough, however, to allow Diamond to see that"]]]
