Wrap them up in as small a package as possible.\"  Josie noticed a fat roll of greenbacks as the woman paid for her purchases. Then, the large package under her arm, she walked off with a slow, lazy, long-limbed grace. In spite of the conversation she had held with Josie and the clerk she neglected any word of farewell.  \"What can I show you, miss?\" the clerk asked Josie.  \"Nothing today, thank you! I reckon I'm due at my job. I'll be in another day. Good-by!\" and Josie was off on her quest. She followed the woman from a safe distance up one street for several blocks and around a corner. She went in the front door of a cheap boarding house not far from the Higgledy-Piggledy Shop. From the fact that she did not ring the bell, but merely walked in, Josie gathered that there she was making her temporary home. The place was frankly third-class, with a large sign stating that boarders were wanted by the day or week. On the porch were young women coifed according to the latest and most extreme bushiness and young men with their feet on the railing, socks and toothpicks much in evidence.  Josie noted the address: 126 East Centre Street. She also noted the odors that exuded from the basement dining room.  \"A veritable Todgers',\" she said to herself. Dickens was Josie's favorite author and she could usually find a parallel from him to suit every case. \"All the greens that were ever cooked there were evergreens and flourished in immortal strength,\" she quoted. \"A funny hole for my lady of the high arches to choose to live in. And those kiddies--who and why are they? Anyhow, I'm going to keep my eye on the bunch of them.\"  Josie reported what she had discovered to Mary Louise, who was duly impressed by her friend's cleverness.  \"Not a bit of it,\" said Josie, repudiating anything more than just an ordinary amount of knowledge of human nature. \"I saw from the woman's shoes that she thought something of her feet and the way she walked and those very feet made me feel somehow she was accustomed walking on the stage. I told her about the sale at Temple & Sweet's, feeling almost sure the lure of bargain shoes would prove strong. There she was to be sure and she had a big wad of money, which makes me think she is doing those little kids dirt, not to have them better dressed. They were not even clean and so ragged it was pathetic. They are more folksy than she is, too. Something about their accent made me feel it. She had a well-modulated voice, but that is because she is evidently an actress as well as dancer; but there is something in her mode of speech that made me feel she was not exactly the same class as the children with her. She is some 'beaut,' though. You should see her in her glad rags.\"  Mary Louise spent a busy afternoon with her lawyer, Mr. Peter Conant, going over her affairs and having him look into the necessary deeds for the transfer of her old house to the Children's Home Society.  \"And what does your young husband say to all of this giving away of good money and land?\" asked Uncle Peter.  \"Danny thinks it is exactly as it should be. He takes a kind of pride in being able to support me himself and he didn't have any too soft and easy a childhood, so he is anxious to help some little ones to happiness.\"  \"Well, he is a good lad, a good lad,\" said Uncle Peter, \"and I wish Jim Hathaway could have done something like this in his lifetime, but he was too busy trying to lay up treasures for you, my dear.\"  \"I think sometimes he knew I'd do it and he was so unselfish he wanted me to have all the fun of it instead of having it himself. I am not depriving myself of anything to speak of. We have plenty left to buy us a nice little home and a large amount to spare besides, and Danny is making a very good salary.\" And Mary Louise hurried off to be home in time to see that the little new maid had everything in the way of food exactly right for her beloved young husband.    CHAPTER V BREAKFAST FOR TWO  The Higgledy-Piggledy Shop was fortunate in having so many partners or near-partners, for Josie O'Gorman was destined to be very busy for many days in looking into the mystery of Peter and Polly and the handsome young woman of the arches. Elizabeth Wright, with the assistance of Irene Macfarlane, was capable of managing the shop alone, with the exception of the fine laundering, and that perforce must wait for Josie's leisure.  On the day following the discovery of the whereabouts of the young woman and the children, Josie was called to the telephone by Dr. Weston. Mary Louise had informed the old man of Josie's real profession, the Higgledy-Piggledy Shop being a mere by-product of the business of being a trained detective, and of her willingness to serve the Children's Home in the latter capacity whenever they needed her.  \"Miss O'Gorman, if you are not too busy I am in great need of your services,\" Dr. Weston said. \"I have a feeling the matter is urgent.\"  \"I'll be right over,\" was Josie's brisk reply.  \"Thank goodness I haven't begun on those lace collars,\" she said to Elizabeth. \"Lace should be washed and ironed at one sitting. You can expect me when you see me, dear. Irene will come in and help keep shop and if you get up against it call on Mary Louise or one of the other girls. So long!\"  She found Dr. Weston somewhat perturbed.  \"It is those same children who were here yesterday, Miss O'Gorman. They came back this morning without the woman; just walked in announcing they had come to stay and seemed to think we were expecting them. They said the young woman, whom they call Cousin Dink, had sent them. I have tried to question them, but their answers are confused and contradictory. I felt that perhaps it was better to wait for you and see what you could find out.\"  \"You will keep them, will you not?\"  \"I don't know. We will if I can do as I want you know the board--\"  \"Yes, I know the board,\" said Josie with, a smile.  \"Sometimes they are great on rules and regulations, and one of our rules is that we must know where the children come from and who they are so we can hand over a record to the persons who are desirous of adopting them.\"  \"I guess that is a pretty good rule, but it should work both ways. I must say I think the ones who do the adopting should have better recommendations than the poor kiddies. If they don't like the children they can bring them back, but the poor babies have to stay put whether they like the adopters or not. Where would these children go if you can't keep them?\"  \"The poorhouse, I think! You see, the orphan asylums are run by churches and usually take only the children whose parents were of their religious convictions. These children are too old for a foundling's home. But I do hope we may be allowed to keep them here.\"  Josie found the children in the parlor, huddled together on the sofa, a forlorn pair. At their feet was the same bumpy bundle of clothes.  \"We comed back,\" the boy said. \"Where is the story-telling lady? The reason we comed back was because I thought she'd be here, too. Cousin Dink told us she'd be here.\"  \"Well, so she will,\" said Josie. \"Where is Cousin Dink?\" she asked Polly.  \"I don't know and I don't care one bit,\" said Polly, without meaning to be pert but simply declaring the truth.  \"But did she not bring you here?\"  \"No ma'm! She yanked us out of bed this morning and made us dress just as fast as we could and then she pulled us out in the street--\"  \"Did you have no breakfast?\"  \"I had a pickle and Peter had a cream puff she forgot to eat last night. I was awful 'fraid it might give him the tummy ache because cream puffs are mighty poor breakfast eatin's, 'specially when they are left-overs, but Peter has powerful tough insides. I believe he can eat almost anything.\"  \"And how about you? Doesn't a pickle for breakfast make you feel kind of queer?\"  \"Oh, my insides are even better than Peter's. The pickle was just the thing because it kept me from wanting anything else.\"  \"Well, I tell you what we are going to do: we are going around the corner to a nice little place and have some breakfast. You can just leave your bundle here,\" she said, as Polly stooped to pick up the untidy parcel.  \"It's right important, because it's all Peter an' me's got,\" said Polly.  \"Dr. Weston will take care of it for you. Now come along, because cream puffs and pickles need something to keep them company.\" As they passed through the office Josie told Dr. Weston where they were going.  \"Bless my soul! I never thought of asking them if they were hungry. Well, come back as soon as you finish and we will see what can be done.\"  \"If you don't mind my making a suggestion, I think the wisest thing to do in this case would be to telephone Mary Louise and let her tackle the board. They could hardly refuse her anything just now.\"  Such hungry children! First Josie ordered oatmeal and cream; then toast and scrambled eggs; and topped it all off with pancakes and maple syrup. She noticed that although the children were almost starving their table manners were good.  \"Gently reared!\" she said to herself.  \"My, but it's been a long time since--\" began Polly, and then stopped short.  \"Since what?\"  \"Nothing! I was just--just--\" The little girl faltered and was silent.  \"All right, honey, don't you tell me a thing you don't want to tell me,\" said Josie kindly, \"but you must remember that I am your friend and if you need me--\"  \"We do need you and I do want to tell you--but--but--\"  \"Now, Polly, you 'member what Cousin Dink said,\" broke in Peter, with his mouth full of pancakes.  \"Yes, and you remember what Mother said about talking with your mouth full,\" admonished Polly.  \"Yes, but she just said people would think we were po' whites if we had bad manners and would blame her. An' you 'member Dink said if we talked 'bout things bad men would git us.\"  \"Well, no bad men are going to get you while I am around, I can tell you that,\" declared Josie stoutly.  \"Not even p'l"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22532"],["title","Mary Louise and Josie O'Gorman (#5)"],["body","icemen?\"  \"Not even policemen! They are my friends and they are your friends, too. Their business is to look after little children.\"  Josie smiled her friendly smile.  \"Well, Cousin Dink was skeered to death of p'licemen an' she was a great deal bigger'n you.\"  \"Was she really? What did she think policemen would do to her?\" asked Josie.  \"Git her!\"  \"Your mother wasn't afraid of policemen, was she?\"  \"No'm, my mother was jes' 'fraid of mice an' snakes.\"  \"Your mother isn't with you, is she?\"  \"No'm, she--I reckon she's dead--me'n Polly ain't quite sure. Sometimes when we begs to go home Cousin Dink says she is dead an' th' ain't no home to go to an' sometimes when Polly an' me can't stop cryin' Cousin Dink says if we stop an' are real good some day she might take us back to our mother.\"  \"Cousin Dink is a born liar, so we don't know what to think,\" spoke Polly coolly.  \"Is she really?\" questioned Josie cautiously. \"I hope you and Peter don't tell lies.\"  \"We don't know how to very well because we were not born that way, but Cousin Dink has taught us right smart. You get out of lots of trouble if you can lie easy like Cousin Dink.\"  Josie felt satisfied now that she would be able by degrees to extract their story from the children. \"There is nothing like a pleasantly full stomach to make one talk,\" she said to herself. \"I had a feeling pancakes would turn the trick. Dr. Weston was trying to get something out of them when the poor little creatures were too hungry to expand.\"  \"Who is Cousin Dink? Is she your mother's cousin?\"  \"She ain't 'zactly our cousin--that is, she told me so one time when she got so mad with me 'cause I chopped off my hair. That was two or three days ago. I couldn't get the tangles out and she wouldn't try, but just pulled the comb through as though she liked to hurt me, so I just up and cut it off with one slash. She said, 'God knows I'm glad you are no blood relation to me, you abominable brat!' I was so glad to near for sure that she wasn't a really truly cousin that I didn't mind a bit being called an abominable brat. Cousin Dink is always talking about God--not praying or loving him, but saying 'God knows!' and 'God is my witness!' and sometimes even worse things, but Peter and I never say the things she says because we know our mother wouldn't like it.\"  \"Have you always known your Cousin Dink?\"  \"Oh, no indeed! We never saw her until the day she came and brought us away.\"  \"Away from your mother and father?\"  \"No, just away from home! You see, our father went to fight in the war. That was a long time ago, so long ago that Peter can't remember him, but he tries to. He can remember the porridge bowl with rabbits on it that Father gave him. He gave me one, too, with chickens on it. And he can 'most remember how Father used to tell us to eat up all the cream out of the bottom so the poor rabbits and chickens could breathe. I was not as old as Peter is now when he went away and Peter wasn't but two. And after he was gone Mother used to cry a lot but she never did let people see her, that is, no people but me, but she worked so hard knitting and making bandages and things that she got sick. And after she got sick she cried all the time and didn't mind who saw her.\"  \"Where was your home?\"  \"Don't tell her! Don't tell her, Polly!\" cried Peter. \"Don't you remember what she said 'bout our never telling that? She said a p'liceman as big as the giant Jack killed would git us--an' he would gouge out our eyes an' then he would go an' take Mother to jail an' maybe he'd even hang her by the neck until she was dead.\"  \"Has your mother done anything wicked that a policeman would do such a thing to her?\" asked Josie patiently and gently.  \"Our mother do anything wicked!\" exclaimed Polly. \"Why she was the goodest person in all the world.\"  \"Don't you know policemen never do anything to good people. They don't do anything to bad people either but arrest them and then the judge decides what is to be done to them. The policemen are really good, kind men, as a rule.\"  \"I believe Cousin Dink was lying, anyhow,\" declared Polly stoutly. \"How could a policeman get our mother if our mother was already dead? I wish I knew whether our mother was dead or not. I believe she must be or she would not let us be traveling around with Cousin Dink, eating cream puffs and pickles for breakfast. Mother was powerful particular about what we ate for breakfast.\"  \"I can find out whether or not your mother is dead if you will only tell me what your name is and where you lived before you were taken off by Cousin Dink,\" said Josie.  \"You are sure they won't get me if I tell,\" whispered Polly. \"Cousin Dink told me I must tell everybody that my mother and father were dead and that I loved her like a sister or aunt. She didn't want to be old enough to be a mother. She said I must forget where I lived before she carried us off. Sometimes I do almost forget it because it seems so long ago.\"  \"You got as far as the time your mother cried all the time,\" suggested Josie. \"What happened then?\"  \"Uncle Chester came back to Atlanta and said she must go to a hospital and he wouldn't let any of her friends see her. He wouldn't let us see her, either.\"  \"And who is Uncle Chester? Is he your mother's brother or your father's?\" asked Josie, making a mental note of the little girl's slip concerning Atlanta.  \"Oh, he isn't either, at least, not a really and truly brother. He always called our father Brother Stephen, but his name is Chester Hunt and father's name was Stephen Waller.\"  \"You say your father's name was Stephen Waller. Do you think he is dead?\"  \"I think so sometimes and sometimes I don't. I don't know what to think. If he is alive why didn't he come back to Mother and if he is dead why didn't Mother know it for sure? When the war got over we thought he was coming home and Mother stopped crying and soldiers kept on coming back and Daddy wasn't with them. And she wrote letters to the President and everybody and nobody seemed to be able to tell her much of anything about Daddy. One time after a big fight he was missing and still some of the men in his regiment say they saw him alive but they don't seem to know just where. And it was all so mixed up and Mother got awful sick and then Uncle Chester came.\"  \"Didn't your mother have any brothers or sisters or any relations of her own?\"  \"No, ma'm, she never did have any and her mother and father died when she was little and she was brought up in France in a convent 'cept'n she wasn't a Catholic.\"  \"Did you live in a house in Atlanta or an apartment?\"  \"We had a great big house and three automobiles and a whole lot of servants. Cousin Dink says I am lying when I say that because she wants people to think we are poor little orphans that she had to support. I know her tricks.\"  \"What was your address in Atlanta?\"  \"Oh, gee! I've let out Atlanta and I reckon I might as well tell the address.\"  Josie wrote it down. She could trust herself to remember any name, but she was more careful with numbers.  \"You don't know where they took your mother? To what sanitarium?\"  \"No, they never told me and when I asked Uncle Chester he pretended at first he didn't hear and then when I kept on asking him he told me to shut my mouth. Uncle Chester had always been nice to us but then he got as sour as pickles.\"    CHAPTER VI A SUCCESSFUL DISGUISE  When Josie and her little friends reached the Children's Home they found Mary Louise waiting for them.  \"It is all right,\" she whispered to Josie. \"Dr. Weston and I have had the whole board on the line one by one and we have talked them into letting the poor kiddies stay. It is against the rules of the board to take children who can give no credentials but all the same we have worked it. Poor lambs, where else can they go? If Danny and I had not moved into such a tiny flat we might have taken them, but as it is--\"  \"As it is you and Danny had better be by yourselves awhile,\" asserted Josie. \"You had better interest yourself in the institution and in children in general and not particularize too much. Poor Danny has had a hard enough time to deserve a little honeymooning period before he adopts a lot of orphans.\"  Although she was so independent, Josie had a strong feeling of sentiment and was essentially feminine in spite of her rather boyish attire. She was a firm believer in what she called \"old-fashioned love.\" Danny Dexter had no better friend than the girl detective, and nobody had understood better or sympathized more in the trials Danny had endured the first few months of his married life than did Josie O'Gorman.  Peter was delighted at again seeing the \"story-telling lady.\" \"I was wondering about the robins all night,\" he said. \"That was one reason I stopped crying when Cousin Dink told us we must come here. You see, Cousin Dink used to tell me if we didn't behave she would put us in a 'sylum and that folks in 'sylums didn't give you nothin' to eat but calf neck an' sheep's tails an' sour bread an' scorched oatmeal. Somehow, when we saw you yesterday an' you tol' me about the robins I thought Cousin Dink might have been tellin' one of her whoppers.\"  By degrees Josie got from the little waifs as much of their story as they could remember. Polly thought they had been with Cousin Dink for about a year. She had taken them from place to place, sometimes stopping in small villages, sometimes in great cities, but never for more than a few weeks anywhere.  Cousin Dink semed to be a relation of Chester Hunt, and Chester Hunt, as near as Josie could make out, was either a half-brother or stepbrother to Stephen Waller, the father of the children. Stephen Waller evidently was among those missing in one of the battles in the Great War. The mother was perhaps crazed by grief and uncertainty. Why the children should have been put in charge of such a person as Cousin Dink remained a mystery that Josie O'Gorman was determined to solve. Why she should have left them for the"]]]
