If you'll let me git up, I'll go right away and let you alone.\"  \"Vell, ged up.\"  \"You won't hit me when I do so?\"  \"Nod if you don'd tried some funny pusiness.\"  Buckhorn struggled to his feet, keeping a suspicious eye on Solomon all the while. He then picked up his revolver, but made no offer to use it, for the Jew was watching every movement, and he noted that Solomon had one hand in his pocket.  \"A critter thet knows tricks like he does, might be able ter shoot 'thout drawin',\" muttered the man from 'Rapahoe. \"I don't allow it'd be healthy ter try a snap shot at him.\"  A roar of laughter broke from the spectators, as they saw the ruffian put the revolver back into its holster, and turn away, like a whipped puppy.  \"Hayar, you mighty chief from 'Rapahoe,\" shouted a voice, \"do yer find this yar town so dead slow as yer did? Don't yer 'low yer'd best go back ter 'Rapahoe, an' stay thar? Next time, we'll set ther dude tenderfoot on yer, an' he'll everlastin'ly chaw yer up!\"  \"How low hev ther mighty fallen!\" murmured Buckhorn, as he continued to walk away.     CHAPTER VII.  IN JAIL.   Great was the disgust of the crowd when it was found that Hank Kildare had taken his prisoner to jail without passing along the main street of the town. It was declared a mean trick on Hank's part, and some excited fellows were for resenting it by breaking into the jail at once and bringing the boy out and \"hangin' him up whar everybody could see him.\"  The ones who made this kind of talk had been \"looking on the bug-juice when it was red,\" and they finally contented themselves by growling and taking another look.  In the meantime, Frank found himself confined in a cell, and he began to realize that he was in a very bad scrape.  Throughout all the excitement at the railroad station, he had remained cool and collected, but now, when he came to think the matter over, his anger rose swiftly, and he felt that the whole business was most outrageous.  Still, when he remembered everything, he did not wonder that the mob had longed to lynch him.  Black Harry was a youthful desperado of the worst sort. He had devastated, plundered, robbed, and murdered in a most infamous manner, his last act being the shooting of Robert Dawson, the Eastern banker.  And Lona Dawson, the banker's daughter, had looked straight into our hero's face and declared that he was Black Harry!  \"It is a horrible mistake!\" cried Frank, as he paced the cell into which he had been thrust. \"She believed she spoke the truth. This young outlaw must resemble me. I cannot blame her.\"  The manacles chafed his wrists.  \"Are they going to leave those things on me, now that they have me safe in jail?\" he cried.  His door opened into the corridor, and he called to the guard, asking that the irons might be removed.  \"I believe Hank has gone fer ther key,\" said the guard \"He didn't take it from ther detective what put them irons on yer.\"  \"Will they be removed when he returns with the key?\"  \"I reckon.\"  \"Then I hope he will hurry. I am tired of carrying the things.\"  He turned back, to pace the cell once more.  \"This is a flimsily-constructed building,\" he said. \"It would be an easy thing to break in here and drag a prisoner out. I escaped death at the hands of the mob because I had friends at hand to fight for me, and because Hank Kildare is utterly fearless, and was determined to bring me here. But the whole town may become aroused, and to-night---- What if Robert Dawson should die!\"  The thought fairly staggered him, for he knew the death of the wounded banker would again inflame the passions of the citizens, and a night raid might be made on the jail.  \"They would stand a good show of forcing their way in here, and then it would be all up with me.\"  It was a terrible thing to stand in peril of such a death. Frank felt that he could not die thus; he would live to clear his honor.  But what could he do? He was helpless, and he could not fight for himself. Must he remain impassive, and let events go on as they might?  \"I do not believe fortune has deserted me,\" he whispered. \"I shall be given a chance to fight for myself.\"  It seemed long hours before the sheriff appeared, accompanied by Burchel Jones, the foxy-faced private detective.  \"Has he been disarmed?\" cautiously asked Jones, as he peered at the boy through the grating in the door.  \"Yep,\" replied Kildare, shortly. \"Do you think I'm in ther habit o' monkeying with ther prisoners yar?\"  \"H'm! Ha! No, no--of course not! But, you see, this fellow is dangerous--very dangerous. He is not to be trusted.\"  \"Wa'al, he's been mild as milk sense he fell inter my hands.\"  \"Trickery, my dear sir--base trickery! By the time you have handled so many desperate criminals as I have, you will see through them like glass.\"  Kildare grunted.  \"Now,\" continued Jones, with the wisdom of an old owl, \"mark the curl of his lip, and the bold, defiant stare of the eye. Mark the covert smile on that face, as if he were really laughing at us now. All those things are significant--mighty significant. You do not dream of the treachery hidden beneath that boyish exterior; but I, sir, can see by his eye that he had rather cut a throat than eat a square meal. The peculiar shape of his lips denote blood-thirstiness, and his nose, which seems rather finely formed to the casual observer, is the nose of a person utterly without conscience. His forehead indicates a certain order of intelligence, but this simply makes him all the more dangerous. He has brain power and force, and that explains why he has succeeded in becoming a leader of desperadoes. That chin is a hard, cruel feature, while the shape of his ears indicates an utter disregard for anything sweet and harmonious of sound, like music. That is an ear which finds more music in the shrieks of murdered victims than in anything else.\"  Frank literally staggered.  \"Great Scott!\" he gasped. \"I never before dreamed that I was such a villainous-looking creature!\"  Kildare began fitting a key to the lock of the door.  \"Are you sure he is disarmed?\" asked the private detective.  \"Yep.\"  \"Well, you are at liberty to do as you like, but I should not remove those irons. It would be far better to keep them on him.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Well, you see--that is--hum!--ha!--such a creature cannot be held too fast. There is no telling what he is liable to do.\"  Kildare gave a grunt of disgust, entered the cell, and removed the manacles from Frank's wrists.  \"Thank you,\" said the boy, gratefully. \"They were beginning to get irksome. I am glad to get them off.\"  \"Ther man what calls hisself Professor Scotch has dispatched East fer yer,\" said the sheriff. \"He sw'ars thar has been a mistake made, an' he kin prove you are what ye claim, an' not Black Harry at all.\"  \"That can be easily proven,\" smiled Frank. \"All we want is a little time.\"  \"Trickery! Trickery!\" cried Jones from the corridor. \"They will do their best to get his neck out of the noose; but he is Black Harry, and I shall receive the reward for his capture.\"  \"You'll receive it when it is proved thet he is Black Harry, so don't yer worry,\" growled Kildare, who had taken a strong dislike to the foxy-faced detective.  \"He has been identified by Miss Dawson; that is proof enough.\"  To this Kildare said nothing; but he spoke again to the boy:  \"Make yerself as easy as yer kin, an' be shore ye'll hev a fair show from Hank Kildare. Thar's talk in town about lynchin', but they don't take yer out o' hyar so long as I kin handle a shootin' iron. I'm goin' ter stay hyar ter-night, an' I'll be reddy fer 'em ef they come.\"  \"Thank you again,\" said Frank, sincerely. \"All I ask is a square deal and a fair show. I know it looks black against me just now, but I'll clear my honor.\"  Burchel Jones laughed, sneeringly.  Kildare said nothing more, but left the cell, locking the door behind him.  At noon Frank was brought an assortment of food that made his eye bulge. He asked if that was the regular fare in the jail, and was told it had been sent in by his friends.  \"The professor and Barney, God bless them! I wonder why they have left me alone so long? But I know they are working for me.\"  It was late in the afternoon when Barney appeared, and was admitted to the cell. The Irish lad gave Frank's hand a warm squeeze, and cried:  \"It's Satan's own scrape, me lad; but we'll get ye out av it if th' spalpanes will let yez alone ter-noight. Av they joomp yez, we'll be here ter foight ter ther last gasp.\"  \"I know you will, Barney!\" said Frank, with deep feeling. \"You are my friend through thick and thin. But, say, do you think there is much danger of lynchers to-night?\"  \"Av Mishter Dawson dies, there will be danger enough, and, at last reports it wur said he could not live more than two ur thray hours.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  THE LYNCHERS.   When Barney returned to the hotel he found Professor Scotch in a very agitated and anxious mood.  \"This is terrible--terrible!\" fluttered the little man, wringing his hands. \"How can we save him?\"  \"Phwat has happened now, profissor?\" asked Barney, anxiously.  \"I have received no reply to my telegrams.\"  \"Kape aisy; the reploies may come lather on.\"  \"And they may not till it is too late. I leaned out of the window a short time ago, and I heard a crowd talking in the street below. That horrible ruffian, Bill Buckhorn, was with them, and he was telling them how to make an attack on the jail. Some of the crowd laughed, and said Hank Kildare had been very slick about getting his prisoner under cover, but he would not be able to keep him long after night came.\"  \"Av they make an attack on th' jail, it's oursilves as should be theer to foight fer Frankie,\" said the Irish lad, seriously.  \"Fight!\" roared Scotch, in his big, hoarse voice. \"Why, I can't fight, and you know it! I can't fight so much as an old woman! I am too nervous--too excitable.\"  \"Arrah! Oi think we have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22571"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Bravery (#7)"],["body"," how ye cowed Colonel La Salle Vallier, th' champion foire-ater av New Orleans.\"  \"No, I have not forgotten that; but I was mad, aroused, excited at the time--I had completely forgotten myself.\"  \"Forget yersilf now, profissor.\"  \"I can't! I can't! It's no use! I would be in the way if I went to the jail. I shall stay away.\"  The professor was an exceedingly timid man, as Barney very well knew, so he did not add to his agitation by telling him that, while returning from the jail, he had heard it hinted that the boy prisoner had two friends in the hotel who might be treated to a \"dose of hemp necktie.\"  The professor, however, suspected the truth, and he kept in his room. Danger could not keep Barney there, and, having reported the result of his conversation with Frank, he went out to learn what was going on.  Two persons very much in evidence since the arrival of the train were the Jew and the dude. The Jew had a way of insinuating himself into the midst of any little knot that was gathered aside from the general throng, and, if they were speaking guardedly, he seemed sure to hear what they were saying and enter into the conversation. As a rule, this was not what would be called a \"healthy\" thing to do in such a place and on such an occasion; but the report of Solomon's encounter with Bill Buckhorn, the Man from 'Rapahoe, had been circulated freely, and the Jew was tolerated for what he had done.  While he appeared very curious to hear anything that seemed like private conversation, the Jew did not neglect any opportunity to transact business, and he made so many trades during the day that the size of his pack materially decreased.  The dude seemed scarcely less curious than the Jew. He had a way of listening with his eyes and mouth wide open, but he lost no time in getting out of the way if ordered to do so. For all of his curiosity, he seemed very timid.  The day passed, and night came. Still Professor Scotch had received no answers to his telegrams.  Shortly after nine o'clock that evening, the report spread rapidly that Robert Dawson, the Eastern banker, was dead.  Immediately there was a swift and silent stirring of men--a significant movement.  \"Thot manes throuble!\" was Barney Mulloy's mental exclamation. \"Th' sheriff should know av it.\"  The Irish lad believed that he was watched, but he hurried to the professor's room, telling him to lock the door and keep within till the storm was over, and then he slipped out of the hotel.  Barney did not hurry toward the jail at once, but he took a roundabout course, dodging and doubling, to bother any one who might attempt to follow him.  Finally, having doubled on his own course, he struck out for the jail.  There was a moon, but it was obscured at times by drifting clouds, something rather unusual in that part of the country for a night that was not stormy, and did not threaten to become so.  Coming suddenly to the main street of the town, which led straight from the hotel to the jail, Barney paused and listened.  He heard a sound that caused his heart to beat faster, while he held his breath and strained his ears.  Tramp! tramp! tramp! It was the swift and steady rush of many feet.  There was no sound of voices, but the crouching boy knew a body of men was approaching.  Barney drew back, concealing himself as well as he could, and waited.  Nearer and nearer came the sound.  A cloud passed from the face of the moon, and then the watching boy saw a band of men rushing swiftly past his place of concealment.  The men were masked, and all were armed.  They were moving straight toward the jail.  \"Th' lynchers!\" panted Barney. \"They are afther Frankie! Oi must get to th' joail ahead av thim!\"  He ran back along the side street till he came to another that led in the same direction as the one along which the mob was rushing. Turning toward the jail, he ran as he had never ran before in all his life.  On the front door of the jail was a push-button that connected by a wire with a gong within the building. A push on that button set the gong to clamoring loudly.  \"Rattle-ty-clang-clang! rattle-ty-clang!  \"Wa'al, what's thet mean?\" growled Hank Kildare, as he leaped up from the couch on which he had been reclining lazily. \"What derned fool is punchin' away at thet thar button like he hed gone clean daft! Hyar ther critter ring!\"  Kildare looked at his revolvers, then picked up a short-barreled shotgun, and went out into the corridor that led to the door. Reaching the door, he shot open a small panel and shouted:  \"Whatever do yer think ye're doin' out thar? Will yer stop thet thar racket, ur shall I guv yer a dost out o' this yar gun!\"  \"Mr. Kildare, is thot yersilf?\" panted a voice, which the sheriff had heard before, and which he immediately recognized.  \"Wa'al, 'tain't nobody else.\"  \"Will yes be afther lettin' me in?\"  \"What's ther matter?\"  \"Th' lynchers are comin'!\"  Kildare peered out, and the moon, which did not happen to be hidden at that moment, showed him the boy who stood alone at the door.  Clank, clank, clank!--the sheriff shot back the bolts which held the door, open it swung a bit, out shot his arm, and his fingers closed on Barney Mulloy's shoulder.  Snap--the boy was jerked into the jail. Slam--the door closed, and the bolts shot back into place.  \"Howly shmoke!\" gasped Barney. \"Is it all togither Oi am, ur be Oi in paces?\"  \"Ye're hyar,\" came in a growl from the sheriff's throat. \"Now tell me w'at yer mean by wakin' me an' kickin' up all this yar row.\"  \"Th' lynchers are comin'.\"  \"How do yer know?\"  \"Oi saw thim. Less than thray minutes ago.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Back a short pace.\"  \"How many of them?\"  \"I didn't count, but it's a clane hundred, sure.\"  Kildare asked Barney several more questions, and he was satisfied that the boy spoke the truth.  The deputy sheriff had slept in the jail that night, and, together with the guard, he was now at hand.  \"Look out fer this yar boy,\" directed Kildare. \"One o' yer git ther hose ready. I'm goin' ter try my new arrangement fer repellin' an attack.\"  He rushed away.  The deputy sheriff, whose name was Gilson, opened a small square door in the wall of the corridor, and dragged forth a coil of hose.  \"Pwhat are ye goin' ter do with thot?\" asked Barney, in surprise.  \"Wait, an' ye'll see,\" was the reply.  Then the deputy spoke to the guard.  \"Tyler, be ready ter let ther prisoner loose if the mob breaks in an' gits past me. You kin tell by watchin'. You know it's Hank's order thet ther cell be opened an' ther poor feller give a chance ter fight fer his life.\"  \"Where is he?\" palpitated Barney. \"Oi'll shtand by him till he doies!\"  \"Ye kin do better by stayin' hyar,\" declared the deputy. \"Ye may be needed.\"  Bang! bang! bang!  The lynchers had arrived, and they were hammering on the door. The gong began to clang wildly.  \"Open this door!\"  \"Why don't Hank turn on ther water up above?\" came anxiously from the lips of the deputy. \"Kin it be thet his tank on ther roof has leaked dry? Ef so, his new scheme fer repellin' an attackin' party won't work very well.\"  \"Open this door!\" shouted a commanding voice outside.  The deputy sprang to the small panel and flung it open.  \"What d'yer want yere?\" he demanded.  \"We want to come in,\" was the answer.  \"Wa'al, yer can't.\"  \"We'll agree to stay out on one condition. If you will pass out something, we'll agree not to break in.\"  \"What's ther something?\"  \"Black Harry.\"  \"I reckoned so.\"  \"Will you give him up?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then we shall break down the door, and I warn you that it will be very unfortunate if any of us is injured. It might bring about the lynching of other parties besides Black Harry.\"  \"Wa'al, I warn yer ter keep away from yere. We're goin' ter defend ther prisoner regardless, an' somebody's bound ter git hurt.\"  \"For the last time, will you open?\"  \"No.\"  \"Down with the door!\"  Crash! crash!--the assault on the door began.     CHAPTER IX.  THE ASSAULT ON THE JAIL.   \"Why don't Hank put on ther water?\" groaned the deputy sheriff. \"Et'll be too late in a minute!\"  Crash! crash! The assailants were using a heavy battering ram, and the door was beginning to give.  \"Oi'm afraid it's all up with poor Frankie!\" gasped Barney.  A wild yell came from the mad mob at the door.  \"Death to Black Harry!\"  Bang--splinter--crash! The door was breaking, and the battering-ram was being driven against it with renewed force.  There was one last great shock, and down went the door before the assault.  \"No water yet!\" cried Gilson. \"Now it is too late!\"  He flung down the hose, taking to his heels before the gang of masked men that swarmed into the doorway.  Barney Mulloy heard a hissing noise, and then he leaped forward and caught up the nozzle of the hose. He turned the large stop-cock, and a bar of water shot out, striking the leader of the lynchers in the neck, and hurling him, gasping and stunned, back into the arms of those behind.  \"Hurro!\" trumpeted the Irish lad, in delight, his blood aroused. \"Come on, an' git washed off th' face av th' earth!\"  This method of defense proved unpleasantly surprising to the attacking party. The stream of water swept men off their feet and flung them, half-drowned, back from the doorway into the night. In less than half a minute Barney had cleared the doorway.  \"Hurro!\" he shouted, once more. \"This is th' kind av sport! We'll howld th' fort till th' last drop av warther is gone!\"  There was a lull, and Hank Kildare came panting to the side of the lad with the hose. When he saw the broken door an exclamation of dismay came from the lips of the sheriff.  \"Something wuz ther matter, so I couldn't turn ther water on,\" he said. \"An' now they've got ther door down!\"  \"But Oi bate 'em off!\" shouted the Irish lad, triumphantly.  \"They'll come in when ther water fails.\"  Barney had not thought of that, and his feeling of triumph turned to anxiety and dismay.  \"Pwhat kin we do?\"  \"Where is Gilson?\"  \"Th' spalpane run whin the dure wur broke.\"  \"We might fight, "]]]
