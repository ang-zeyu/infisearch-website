His heart grew cold with fear. \"Death has struck me,\" he cried.  \"Your cruel life is over,\" said the warrior. \"People shall no longer fear your fatal breath.\" Then he said to the woodpecker, \"Little bird, you have been a good friend to me, and I will do all that I can for you.\" He put some of the red blood of the magician upon the little creature's head. It made the crest of feathers there as red as flame. \"Whenever a man looks upon you,\" said the warrior, \"he will say, 'That bird is our friend. He helped to kill the cruel magician.'\"  The little woodpecker was very proud of his red crest because it showed that he was the friend of man, and all his children to this day are as proud as he was.  [Illustration]     WHY THE CAT ALWAYS FALLS UPON HER FEET.   Some magicians are cruel, but others are gentle and good to all the creatures of the earth. One of these good magicians was one day traveling in a great forest. The sun rose high in the heavens, and he lay down at the foot of a tree. Soft, green moss grew all about him. The sun shining through the leaves made flecks of light and shadow upon the earth. He heard the song of the bird and the lazy buzz of the wasp. The wind rustled the leafy boughs above him. All the music of the forest lulled him to slumber, and he closed his eyes.  As the magician lay asleep, a great serpent came softly from the thicket. It lifted high its shining crest and saw the man at the foot of the tree. \"I will kill him!\" it hissed. \"I could have eaten that cat last night if he had not called, 'Watch, little cat, watch!' I will kill him, I will kill him!\"  Closer and closer the deadly serpent moved. The magician stirred in his sleep. \"Watch, little cat, watch!\" he said softly. The serpent drew back, but the magician's eyes were shut, and it went closer. It hissed its war-cry. The sleeping magician did not move. The serpent was upon him--no, far up in the high branches of the tree above his head the little cat lay hidden. She had seen the serpent when it came from the thicket.  [Illustration: SHE LEAPED DOWN UPON THE SERPENT]  She watched it as it went closer and closer to the sleeping man, and she heard it hiss its war-cry. The little cat's body quivered with anger and with fear, for she was so little and the serpent was so big. \"The magician was very good to me,\" she thought, and she leaped down upon the serpent.  Oh, how angry the serpent was! It hissed, and the flames shot from its eyes. It struck wildly at the brave little cat, but now the cat had no fear. Again and again she leaped upon the serpent's head, and at last the creature lay dead beside the sleeping man whom it had wished to kill.  When the magician awoke, the little cat lay on the earth, and not far away was the dead serpent. He knew at once what the cat had done, and he said, \"Little cat, what can I do to show you honor for your brave fight? Your eyes are quick to see, and your ears are quick to hear. You can run very swiftly. I know what I can do for you. You shall be known over the earth as the friend of man, and you shall always have a home in the home of man. And one thing more, little cat: you leaped from the high tree to kill the deadly serpent, and now as long as you live, you shall leap where you will, and you shall always fall upon your feet.\"     WHY THE SWALLOW'S TAIL IS FORKED.   This is the story of how the swallow's tail came to be forked.  One day the Great Spirit asked all the animals that he had made to come to his lodge. Those that could fly came first: the robin, the bluebird, the owl, the butterfly, the wasp, and the firefly. Behind them came the chicken, fluttering its wings and trying hard to keep up. Then came the deer, the squirrel, the serpent, the cat, and the rabbit. Last of all came the bear, the beaver, and the hedgehog. Every one traveled as swiftly as he could, for each wished to hear the words of the Great Spirit.  \"I have called you together,\" said the Great Spirit, \"because I often hear you scold and fret. What do you wish me to do for you? How can I help you?\"  \"I do not like to hunt so long for my food,\" said the bear.  \"I do not like to build nests,\" said the bluebird.  \"I do not like to live in the water,\" said the beaver.  \"And I do not like to live in a tree,\" said the squirrel.  At last man stood erect before the Great Spirit and said, \"O Great Father, the serpent feasts upon my blood. Will you not give him some other food?\"  \"And why?\" asked the Great Spirit.  \"Because I am the first of all the creatures you have made,\" answered man proudly.  Then every animal in the lodge was angry to hear the words of man. The squirrel chattered, the wasp buzzed, the owl hooted, and the serpent hissed.  \"Hush, be still,\" said the Great Spirit. \"You are, O man, the first of my creatures, but I am the father of all. Each one has his rights, and the serpent must have his food. Mosquito, you are a great traveler. Now fly away and find what creature's blood is best for the serpent. Do you all come back in a year and a day.\"  The animals straightway went to their homes. Some went to the river, some to the forest, and some to the prairie, to wait for the day when they must meet at the lodge of the Great Spirit.  The mosquito traveled over the earth and stung every creature that he met to find whose blood was the best for the serpent. On his way back to the lodge of the Great Spirit he looked up into the sky, and there was the swallow.  \"Good-day, swallow,\" called the mosquito.  \"I am glad to see you, my friend,\" sang the swallow. \"Are you going to the lodge of the Great Spirit? And have you found out whose blood is best for the serpent?\"  \"The blood of man,\" answered the mosquito.  The mosquito did not like man, but the swallow had always been his friend. \"What can I do to help man?\" he thought. \"Oh, I know what I can do.\" Then he asked the mosquito, \"Whose blood did you say?\"  \"Man's blood,\" said the mosquito; \"that is best.\"  \"_This_ is best,\" said the swallow, and he tore out the mosquito's tongue.  The mosquito buzzed angrily and went quickly to the Great Spirit.  \"All the animals are here,\" said the Great Spirit. \"They are waiting to hear whose blood is best for the serpent.\"  The mosquito tried to answer, \"The blood of man,\" but he could not say a word. He could make no sound but \"Kss-ksss-ksssss!\"  \"What do you say?\"  \"Kss-ksss-ksssss!\" buzzed the mosquito angrily.  All the creatures wondered. Then said the swallow:--  \"Great Father, the mosquito is timid and cannot answer you. I met him before we came, and he told me whose blood it was.\"  \"Then let us know at once,\" said the Great Spirit.  [Illustration]  \"It is the blood of the frog,\" answered the swallow quickly. \"Is it not so, friend mosquito?\"  \"Kss-ksss-ksssss!\" hissed the angry mosquito.  \"The serpent shall have the frog's blood,\" said the Great Spirit. \"Man shall be his food no longer.\"  Now the serpent was angry with the swallow, for he did not like frog's blood. As the swallow flew near him, he seized him by the tail and tore away a little of it. This is why the swallow's tail is forked, and it is why man always looks upon the swallow as his friend.     WHY THE WHITE HARES HAVE BLACK EARS.   In the forest there is a beautiful spirit. All the beasts and all the birds are dear to him, and he likes to have them gentle and good. One morning he saw some of his little white hares fighting one another, and each trying to seize the best of the food.  \"Oh, my selfish little hares,\" he said sadly, \"why do you fight and try to seize the best of everything for yourselves? Why do you not live in love together?\"  \"Tell us a story and we will be good,\" cried the hares.  Then the spirit of the forest was glad. \"I will tell you a story of how you first came to live on the green earth with the other animals,\" he said, \"and why it is that you are white, and the other hares are not.\"  Then the little hares came close about the spirit of the forest, and sat very still to hear the story.  \"Away up above the stars,\" the gentle spirit began, \"the sky children were all together one snowy day. They threw snowflakes at one another, and some of the snowflakes fell from the sky. They came down swiftly between the stars and among the branches of the trees. At last they lay on the green earth. They were the first that had ever come to the earth, and no one knew what they were. The swallow asked, 'What are they?' and the butterfly answered, 'I do not know.' The spirit of the sky was listening, and he said, 'We call them snowflakes.'  \"'I never heard of snowflakes. Are they birds or beasts?' asked the butterfly.  \"'They are snowflakes,' answered the spirit of the sky, 'but they are magic snowflakes. Watch them closely.'  \"The swallow and the butterfly watched. Every snowflake showed two bright eyes, then two long ears, then some soft feet, and there were the whitest, softest little hares that were ever seen.\"  \"Were we the little white hares?\" asked the listeners.  \"You were the little white hares,\" answered the spirit, \"and if you are gentle and good, you will always be white.\"  The hares were not gentle and good; they were fretful, and before long they were scolding and fighting again. The gentle spirit was angry. \"I must get a firebrand and beat them with it,\" he said, \"for they must learn to be good.\"  So the hares were beaten with the firebrand till their ears were black as night. Their bodies were still white, but if the spirit hears them scolding and fighting again, it may be that we shall see their bodies as black as their ears.     WHY THE MAGPIE'S NEST IS NOT WELL BUILT.   A long time ago all the birds met together to talk about building nests.  \"Every Indian has a wigwam,\" said the robin, \"and every bird needs a home.\"  \"Indians have no feathers,\" said the owl, \"and so they are cold without wigwams. We have feathers.\"  \"I keep warm by flying swiftly,\" said the swallow.  \"And I keep warm by fluttering my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],["title","The Book of Nature Myths (#3)"],["body",",\" said the humming-bird.  \"By and by we shall have our little ones,\" said the robin. \"They will have no feathers on their wings, so they cannot fly or flutter; and they will be cold. How shall we keep them warm if we have no nests?\"  Then all the birds said, \"We will build nests so that our little ones will be warm.\"  The birds went to work. One brought twigs, one brought moss, and one brought leaves. They sang together merrily, for they thought of the little ones that would some time come to live in the warm nests.  Now the magpie was lazy, and she sat still and watched the others at their work.  \"Come and build your nest in the reeds and rushes,\" cried one bird, but the magpie said \"No.\"  \"My nest is on the branch of a tree,\" called another, \"and it rocks like a child's cradle. Come and build beside it,\" but the magpie said \"No.\"  Before long all the birds but the magpie had their nests built. The magpie cried, \"I do not know how to build a nest. Will you not help me?\"  The other birds were sorry for her and answered, \"We will teach you.\" The black-bird said, \"Put the twigs on this bough;\" the robin said, \"Put the leaves between the twigs;\" and the humming-bird said, \"Put this soft green moss over it all.\"  [Illustration]  \"I do not know how,\" cried the magpie.  \"We are teaching you,\" said the other birds. But the magpie was lazy, and she thought, \"If I do not learn, they will build a nest for me.\"  The other birds talked together. \"She does not wish to learn,\" they said, \"and we will not help her any longer.\" So they went away from her.  Then the magpie was sorry. \"Come back,\" she called, \"and I will learn.\" But by this time the other birds had eggs in their nests, and they were busy taking care of them, and had no time to teach the lazy magpie. This is why the magpie's nest is not well built.     WHY THE RAVEN'S FEATHERS ARE BLACK.   Long, long ago the raven's feathers were white as snow. He was a beautiful bird, but the other birds did not like him because he was a thief. When they saw him coming, they would hide away the things that they cared for most, but in some marvelous way he always found them and took them to his nest in the pine-tree.  One morning the raven heard a little bird singing merrily in a thicket. The leaves of the trees were dark green, and the little bird's yellow feathers looked like sunshine among them.  \"I will have that bird,\" said the raven, and he seized the trembling little thing.  The yellow bird fluttered and cried, \"Help, help! Will no one come and help me!\"  The other birds happened to be far away, and not one heard her cries. \"The raven will kill me,\" she called. \"Help, help!\"  Now hidden in the bark of a tree was a wood-worm.  \"I am only a wood-worm,\" he said to himself, \"and I cannot fly like a bird, but the yellow bird has been good to me, and I will do what I can to help her.\"  When the sun set, the raven went to sleep. Then the wood-worm made his way softly up the pine-tree to the raven's nest, and bound his feet together with grass and pieces of birch-bark.  \"Fly away,\" whispered the wood-worm softly to the little yellow bird, \"and come to see me by and by. I must teach the raven not to be cruel to the other birds.\"  The little yellow bird flew away, and the wood-worm brought twigs, and moss, and birch-bark, and grass, and put them around the tree. Then he set them all on fire. Up the great pine-tree went the flames, leaping from bough to bough.  \"Fire! fire!\" cried the raven. \"Come and help me! My nest is on fire!\"  The other birds were not sorry to see him flutter. \"He is a thief,\" said they. \"Let him be in the fire.\"  By and by the fire burned the grass and the pieces of birch-bark that fastened his feet together, and the raven flew away. He was not burned, but he could no longer be proud of his shining white feathers, for the smoke had made every one of them as black as night.     HOW FIRE WAS BROUGHT TO THE INDIANS.   PART I. SEIZING THE FIREBRAND.  Oh, it was so cold! The wind blew the leaves about on the ground. The frost spirit hid on the north side of every tree, and stung every animal of the forest that came near. Then the snow fell till the ground was white. Through the snowflakes one could see the sun, but the sun looked cold, for it was not a clear, bright yellow. It was almost as white as the moon.  The Indians drew their cloaks more and more closely around them, for they had no fire.  \"How shall we get fire?\" they asked, but no one answered.  All the fire on earth was in the wigwam of two old women who did not like the Indians.  \"They shall not have it,\" said the old women, and they watched night and day so that no one could get a firebrand.  At last a young Indian said to the others, \"No man can get fire. Let us ask the animals to help us.\"  \"What beast or what bird can get fire when the two old women are watching it?\" the others cried.  \"The bear might get it.\"  \"No, he cannot run swiftly.\"  \"The deer can run.\"  \"His antlers would not go through the door of the wigwam.\"  \"The raven can go through the door.\"  \"It was smoke that made the raven's feathers black, and now he always keeps away from the fire.\"  \"The serpent has not been in the smoke.\"  \"No, but he is not our friend, and he will not do anything for us.\"  \"Then I will ask the wolf,\" said the young man. \"He can run, he has no antlers, and he has not been in the smoke.\"  So the young man went to the wolf and called, \"Friend wolf, if you will get us a firebrand, I will give you some food every day.\"  \"I will get it,\" said the wolf. \"Go to the home of the old women and hide behind a tree; and when you hear me cough three times, give a loud war-cry.\"  Close by the village of the Indians was a pond. In the pond was a frog, and near the pond lived a squirrel, a bat, a bear, and a deer. The wolf cried, \"Frog, hide in the rushes across the pond. Squirrel, go to the bushes beside the path that runs from the pond to the wigwam of the two old women. Bat, go into the shadow and sleep if you like, but do not close both eyes. Bear, do not stir from behind this great rock till you are told. Deer, keep still as a mountain till something happens.\"  The wolf then went to the wigwam of the two old women. He coughed at the door, and at last they said, \"Wolf, you may come in to the fire.\"  [Illustration]  The wolf went into the wigwam. He coughed three times, and the Indian gave a war-cry. The two old women ran out quickly into the forest to see what had happened, and the wolf ran away with a firebrand from the fire.   PART II. THE FIREBRAND IN THE FOREST.  When the two women saw that the wolf had the firebrand, they were very angry, and straightway they ran after him.  \"Catch it and run!\" cried the wolf, and he threw it to the deer. The deer caught it and ran.  \"Catch it and run!\" cried the deer, and he threw it to the bear. The bear caught it and ran.  \"Catch it and fly!\" cried the bear, and he threw it to the bat. The bat caught it and flew.  \"Catch it and run!\" cried the bat, and he threw it to the squirrel. The squirrel caught it and ran.  \"Oh, serpent,\" called the two old women, \"you are no friend to the Indians. Help us. Get the firebrand away from the squirrel.\"  As the squirrel ran swiftly over the ground, the serpent sprang up and tried to seize the firebrand. He did not get it, but the smoke went into the squirrel's nostrils and made him cough. He would not let go of the firebrand, but ran and ran till he could throw it to the frog.  When the frog was running away with it, then the squirrel for the first time thought of himself, and he found that his beautiful bushy tail was no longer straight, for the fire had curled it up over his back.  \"Do not be sorry,\" called the young Indian across the pond. \"Whenever an Indian boy sees a squirrel with his tail curled up over his back, he will throw him a nut.\"   PART III. THE FIREBRAND IN THE POND.  All this time the firebrand was burning, and the frog was going to the pond as fast as he could. The old women were running after him, and when he came to the water, one of them caught him by the tail.  \"I have caught him!\" she called.  \"Do not let him go!\" cried the other.  \"No, I will not,\" said the first; but she did let him go, for the little frog tore himself away and dived into the water. His tail was still in the woman's hand, but the firebrand was safe, and he made his way swiftly across the pond.  \"Here it is,\" said the frog.  \"Where?\" asked the young Indian. Then the frog coughed, and out of his mouth came the firebrand. It was small, for it had been burning all this time, but it set fire to the leaves and twigs, and soon the Indians were warm again. They sang and they danced about the flames.  At first the frog was sad, because he was sorry to lose his tail; but before long he was as merry as the people who were dancing, for the young Indian said, \"Little frog, you have been a good friend to us, and as long as we live on the earth, we will never throw a stone at a frog that has no tail.\"     HOW THE QUAIL BECAME A SNIPE.   \"It is lonely living in this great tree far away from the other birds,\" said the owl to herself. \"I will get some one to come and live with me. The quail has many children, and I will ask her for one of them.\"  The owl went to the quail and said, \"Will you let me have one of your children to come and live with me?\"  \"Live with you? No,\" answered the quail. \"I would as soon let my child live with the serpent. You are hidden in the tree all day long, and when it is dark, you come down like a thief and catch little animals that are fast asleep in their nests. You shall never have one of my children.\"  \"I _will_ have one,\" thought the owl.  She waited till the night had come. It was dark and gloomy, for the moon was not to be seen, and not a star twinkled in the sky. Not a leaf stirred, and not a ripple was on the pond. The owl crept up to the quail's home as softly as she could. The young birds were chattering together, and she listened"]]]
