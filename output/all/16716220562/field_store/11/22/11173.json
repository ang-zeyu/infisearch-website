I know there are no pumpkins of that size.\"  \"Uncle Randolph, you'll have to forgive me,\" said Tom, putting his hand affectionately on his relative's shoulder. \"I really couldn't help it--I am just bubbling over to think that school days are over and I won't have to do any studying for several months to come.\"  \"I fancy we'll have to tie you down to keep you out of mischief.\"  \"You won't have to tie me down if I go on a sea trip with dad.\"  \"Haven't you had sea trips enough--with being cast away in the middle of the Pacific, and being wrecked in the Gulf of Mexico? It seems to me every time you and the others leave home something serious happens to you.\"  \"True--but we always come back right side up with care and all charges paid,\" answered the fun-loving Rover airily.  They soon made a turn in the road which brought them in sight of the big farmhouse, nestling comfortably in a group of stately trees. As they turned into the lane their Aunt Martha came to the front piazza and waved her hand. Down in the roadway stood Jack Ness, the hired man, grinning broadly, and behind Mrs. Rover stood Alexander Pop, the colored helper, his mouth open from ear to ear. At once Tom began to sing:      \"Home again! home again!     Safe from Putnam Hall.\"  And then he made a flying leap from the carriage, rushed up the steps and gave his aunt such a hug as made her gasp for breath.  \"Oh, Tom, you bear! Do let up!\" she cried. \"Now, there's a kiss for you, and there's another! How do you do, Sam, and how are you, Dick?\" And she kissed them also. \"I am glad you are back at last.\" She turned to her husband. \"What of Anderson, did you hear anything?\"  \"Yes, he will be back in a few days.\"  \"I'se jess too pleased fo' anything to see yo' boys back heah!\" came from Aleck Pop. \"It's dun been mighty lonely since yo' went away.\"  \"Don't worry, Aleck, we'll cheer you up,\" answered Tom.  \"Oh, I know dat, Massa Tom--yo'll turn dis place upside down in two days suah!\"  \"Why, Aleck, you know I'd never do anything so rash,\" answered Tom, meekly.  \"Going to uncover some more freight thieves?\" asked Jack Ness, as he took charge of the team and started for the barn.  \"I think dem boys had bettah cotch some of dem chicken thieves,\" put in Aleck Pop. \"Yo' don't seem to git holt ob dem nohow.\"  \"Oh, never you mind about the chicken thieves,\" grumbled Jack Ness.  \"Has somebody been stealing chickens again?\" asked Dick, remembering that they had suffered several times from such depredations.  \"Yes, da has--took two chickens las' Wednesday, foah on Saturday, an' two on Monday. Jack he laid fo' 'em wid a shotgun, but he didn't cotch nobody.\"  \"I'll catch them yet, see if I don't,\" said the hired man.  \"Perhaps a fox is doing it,\" suggested Sam. \"If so, we ought to go on a fox hunt. That would suit me first-rate.\"  \"No fox in this,\" answered Jack Ness. \"I see the footprints of two men,--tramps, I reckon. If I catch sight of 'em I'll fill 'em full of shot and then have 'em locked up.\"     CHAPTER III  FUN ON THE FARM   Two days passed and the boys felt once more at home on the farm. The strain of the recent examinations and the closing exercises at school had gone and as Sam declared, \"they were once more themselves,\" and ready for anything that might turn up.  In those two days came another telegram from Mr. Rover, sent from Philadelphia, in which he stated that he had caught his man, but had lost him again. He added that he would be home probably on the following Sunday. This message came in on Monday, so the boys knew they would have to wait nearly a week before seeing their parent.  \"I am just dying to know what it is all about,\" said Tom, and the others said practically the same.  Tom could not keep down his propensities for joking and nearly drove Sarah, the cook, to distraction by putting some barn mice in the bread box in the pantry and by pouring ink over some small stones and then adding them to the coal she was using in the kitchen range. He also took a piece of old rubber bicycle tire and trimmed it up to resemble a snake and put it in Jack Ness' bed in the barn, thereby nearly scaring the hired man into a fit. Ness ran out of the room in his night dress and raised such a yell that he aroused everybody in the house. He got his shotgun and blazed away at the supposed snake, thereby ruining a blanket, two sheets, and filling the mattress with shot. When he found out how he had been hoaxed he was the most foolish looking man to be imagined.  \"You just wait, Master Tom, I'll get square,\" he said.  \"Who said I put a snake in your bed?\" demanded Tom. \"I never did such a thing in my life.\"  \"No, but you put that old rubber in, and I know it,\" grumbled the hired man, and then went back to bed.  Tom also had his little joke on Aleck Pop. One evening he saw the colored man dressing up to go out and learned that he was going to call on a colored widow living at Dexter's Corners, a nearby village.  \"We can't allow this,\" said the fun-loving Rover to his younger brother. \"The next thing you know Aleck will be getting married and leaving us.\"  \"What do you think of doing?\" asked Sam.  \"Come on, and I'll show you.\"  Now, Aleck was rather a good looking and well-formed darkey and he was proud of his shape. He had a fine black coat, with trousers to match, and a gorgeous colored vest. This suit Tom was certain he would wear when calling on the widow.  When in Ithaca on his way home the fun-loving Rover had purchased an imitation rabbit, made of thin rubber. This rabbit had a small rubber hose attached, and by blowing into the hose the rabbit could be blown up to life-size or larger.  Leading the way to Aleck's room, Tom got out the colored man's coat and placed the rubber rabbit in the middle of the back, between the cloth and the lining. It was put in flat and the hose was allowed to dangle down under the lining to within an inch of the split of the coat-tails, and at this point Tom put a hole in the lining, so he could get at the end of the hose with ease.  It was not long before Aleck came in to dress. It was late and he was in a hurry, for he knew he had a rival, a man named Jim Johnson, and he did not want Johnson to get to the widow's home ahead of him. He washed up and donned his clothing with rapidity, and never noticed that anything was wrong with the coat.  \"Now, Sam, you fix his necktie for him,\" whispered Tom, who, with his younger brother, was lying in wait outside the house. \"Tell him it doesn't set just straight.\"  Sam understood, and as soon as Aleck appeared he sauntered up side by side with Tom.  \"Hullo, Aleck, going to see your best girl?\" he said pleasantly.  \"I'se gwine to make a little call, dat's all.\"  \"He's after the widow Taylor,\" put in Tom. \"He knows she's got ten thousand or so in the bank.\"  \"Massa Tom, you dun quit yo' foolin',\" expostulated Aleck.  \"If you are going to make a society call you want your necktie on straight,\" said Sam. \"It's a fine tie, but it's no good the way you have it tied. Here, let me fix it,\" and he pulled the tie loose.  \"I did hab a lot ob trubble wid dat tie,\" agreed the colored man.  \"It's too far around,\" went on Sam, and gave the tie a jerk, first one way and another. Then he began to tie it, shoving Aleck again as he did so.  In the meantime Tom had gotten behind the colored man and was blowing up the rubber rabbit. As the rubber expanded Aleck's coat went up with it, until it looked as if the man was humpbacked. Then Tom fastened the hose, so the wind could not get out of it. Next the youth brought out a bit of chalk and in big letters wrote on the black coat as follows:      _I have got to_             HUMP     _to catch the_         _widow._  \"Now your tie is something like,\" declared Sam, after a wink from Tom. \"It outshines everything I ever saw.\"  \"I'se got to be a-going,\" answered Aleck. \"Much obliged.\"  \"Now, Aleck, hump yourself and you'll get the widow sure--along with her fourteen children.\"  \"She ain't got but two children,\" returned the colored man, and hurried away. His appearance, with the hump on his back and the sign, caused both the Rovers to burst out laughing.  \"Come on, I've got to see the end of this,\" said Tom, and led the way by a side path to the Widow Taylor's cottage. This was a short cut, but Aleck would not take it, because of the briar bushes and the dust. As the boys were in their knockaround suits they did not mind this.  The widow's cottage was a tumbled-down affair on a side street of Dexter's Corners. A stovepipe stuck out of a back window, and the front door lacked the lower hinge. In the front yard the weeds were several feet high.  \"I don't see why Aleck wants to come and see such a person as this,\" observed Sam. \"She may be pretty, as colored widows go, but she is certainly lazy and shiftless.\"  \"Yes, and she has more than two children and I know it. Why, once I came past here and I saw her with at least seven or eight.\"  When the boys came up they saw several colored children hurrying away from the house. As they did this the widow came to the door and called after them:  \"Now, Arabella, go to the cemetery, jest as I tole yo', an' stay thar!\"  \"I ain't gwine to stay long,\" answered Arabella.  \"You stay an hour or two,\" answered the widow. \"To-morrow, I'll give yo' money fer lolly-pops.\"  \"What is she sending the children to the cemetery for?\" asked Tom, in a whisper.  \"Maybe to keep 'em quiet,\" answered Sam, with a grin.  \"Must be wanting to keep them out of Aleck's way.\"  At that moment the figure of a tall, lanky colored man came down a side street. The man entered the widow's cottage and received a warm welcome.  \"Glad to see you, Mistah Thomas. Hopes yo' is feelin' fine this ebenin',\" said the widow graciously.  \"I'se come fo' to make yo' an offah,\" said Mr. Thomas. \"Yo' said yo' would mahrry me soon as I had a job. Well, I'se got de job now.\"  \"Is it a steady"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22547"],["title","The Rover Boys on Treasure Isle; or, The Strange Cruise of the Steam Yacht (#3)"],["body","?\"  \"Yes, at de stone quarry--dribin' a stone wagon.\"  \"How much yo' gits a week, Peter?\"  \"Twelve dollahs,\" was the proud answer.  \"Den I closes wid you,\" said the widow, and allowed the suitor to embrace her.  Just then Aleck came in sight. As he saw the couple through the open door he straightened up.  \"Maybe yo' didn't look fo' me around, Mrs. Taylor,\" he said, stiffly.  \"Oh, yes, I did, Mistah Pop,\" she said, sweetly. \"But yo' see--I--dat is----\" She stopped short. \"Wot's dat?\" she cried.  \"Wot?\"  \"Dat hump on yo' back?\"  \"Ain't no hump on my back,\" answered Aleck.  \"Suah da is.\"  \"He's got a sign on, too,\" put in Peter Thomas. \"Look wot it reads, 'I hab got to hump to cotch de widow.' Hah! hah! hah! Dot's a good one.\"  \"Yo' needn't hump yo'self to cotch me,\" cried the widow, wrathfully. \"I'se engaged to Mistah Thomas.\" And she smiled on the individual in question.  Crestfallen and bewildered, Aleck felt of his back and took off his coat. He squeezed the rubber rabbit so hard that it exploded with a bang, scaring himself and the others.  \"Dat's a trick on me!\" roared the Rover's man, and tore the rabbit from his coat. \"Dem boys did dat!\"  \"I can't see yo' to-night, or any udder night, Mistah Pop,\" said the widow. \"I'se engaged to Mistah Thomas.\"  \"Den good-night,\" growled Aleck, and turning on his heel he started for home.  Tom and Sam saw that he was angry, yet they had to roar at the scene presented. They wondered what Aleck would say when he got back to the farm.  \"We have got to square ourselves,\" said Tom.  \"How are you going to do it?\"  \"Oh, we'll do it somehow.\"  They took the short-cut, but so did Aleck, and consequently all three soon met.  \"Yo' played dat joke--yo' can't go fo' to deny it!\" cried the colored man.  \"We are not going to deny it, Aleck,\" said Tom. \"But it was no joke. We did it for your good.\"  \"Huh!\"  \"We certainly did,\" put in Sam. \"Why, Aleck, we can't bear to think of your getting married and leaving us.\"  \"Huh!\"  \"We want you to stay with us,\" said Tom. \"Besides, that widow has a lot of children and is after your money.\"  \"She ain't got but two chillen. She had moah, but she dun told me all but two was in de seminary.\"  \"The seminary?\" queried Tom. Then a light broke in on him. \"You mean the cemetery.\"  \"Persackly--de place da puts de dead folks.\"  \"Well, they are in the cemetery right enough--but they are a long way from being dead.\"  \"Wot yo' mean, Tom?\"  \"We saw her send five of them away this evening--she told 'em to go to the cemetery and stay there awhile.\"  \"Wot! Yo' is fooling dis chile!\"  \"It is absolutely true,\" said Sam. \"I am quite sure she has seven children.\"  \"Huh! If dat's de case dat Thomas nigger can hab her,\" grumbled Aleck, and walked on. \"But I ain't takin' yo' word fo' dis,\" he added cautiously. \"I'se gwine to make a few investigations to-morrow.\"  \"Do so--and you'll thank us from the bottom of your heart,\" answered Tom; and there the subject was dropped. It may be added here that later on Aleck discovered that the widow had ten children and was head over heels in debt, and he was more than glad that the boys had played the trick on him, and that the other colored man had gained Mrs. Taylor's hand.     CHAPTER IV  A MIDNIGHT SEARCH   That night was destined to be an eventful one on the Rover farm. Arriving home, Sam and Tom told of the fun they had had and Dick laughed heartily. Then all three of the boys went to bed.  About midnight came a loud shouting from the barn, followed by the report of a shotgun. This was followed by a shriek from Sarah, the cook, who was afraid that burglars had come to murder her.  \"What's that?\" questioned Dick, as he hopped out of bed.  \"That's Jack Ness' gun,\" answered Tom. \"Something must be wrong at the barn.\"  \"Chicken thieves again--I'll bet a new hat,\" said Sam.  By this time Randolph Rover and his wife were up and were lighting a lamp. Without waiting for them, the boys slipped on some clothing and their shoes and ran downstairs. Dick took with him a pistol and each of the others a baseball bat.  \"Boys! boys! be careful!\" shouted their uncle after them.  \"All right,\" returned Dick, readily.  He was the first outside, but Sam and Tom were close upon his heels. He heard Jack Ness running to the edge of a cornfield, shouting lustily. Then came another report of the shotgun.  \"What is it, Jack?\" shouted Dick. \"Who are you shooting at?\"  \"I'm after two men,\" was the hired man's reply. \"They jest run into the cornfield.\"  \"Chicken thieves?\" queried Tom.  \"I guess so--anyway they was prowlin' around the hen house an' the barn. I called an' asked 'em what they wanted and they ran for dear life--so I knew they was up to no good.\"  \"They certainly must have been chicken thieves, or worse,\" was Sam's comment. \"Really, this is getting to be too much,\" he added. \"We ought to catch them and have them locked up.\"  \"I'm willing to go after them,\" answered Tom, readily.  \"Did you get a good look at the rascals?\" asked Dick.  \"Not very good,\" answered Jack Ness.  \"They weren't boys, were they?\"  \"No--they were men--both tall and heavy fellows.\"  \"Did you ever see them before?\" asked Tom.  \"Not that I can remember.\"  While they were talking the party of four had run down to the edge of the cornfield. This spot was really a peach orchard, but the trees were still so small that the ground was being utilized that season for corn, planted in rows between the trees. The corn was not yet full grown, but it was high enough to conceal a man lying flat or crouching down.  The sky was filled with stars and the old moon was beginning to show over the hills beyond the valley, so it was fairly light across the field. The boys kept their eyes on the corn and the peach trees, but failed to discover any persons moving among them.  \"My shotgun is empty--maybe I had better go back and load up,\" said the hired man.  \"Yes, do it, but hurry up,\" answered Dick. \"I'll stay here on guard with the pistol.\"  The hired man ran off toward the barn. Hardly had he disappeared when Sam gave a short cry and pointed into the field with his hand.  \"I saw somebody raise up just now and look around,\" he said. \"He is out of sight now.\"  \"Where?\" came from Dick and Tom quickly.  \"Over yonder--by the twisted peach tree.\"  \"I'll investigate,\" said Dick. \"You can come along if you want to. Keep your eyes open for both men. We don't want either to get away if we can help it.\"  The three lads spread out in something of a semi-circle and advanced slowly into the field, keeping their eyes and ears on the alert for anything out of the ordinary. Thus they covered fifty yards, when Tom found himself near one of the largest of the peach trees. As he passed this a form arose quickly from under a bough, caught him by the waist and threw him forcibly to the ground.  \"Hi!\" yelled Tom. \"Let up!\" And then he made a clutch for his assailant, catching him by the foot. But the man broke away and went crashing through the corn, calling on \"Shelley\" to follow him.  The yell from Tom attracted the attention of Dick and Sam, and they turned to learn what had happened to their brother. As they did this a second man leaped up from the corn in front of them and started to run in the direction of the river.  \"Stop!\" called out Dick. \"Stop, or I'll fire on you!\" And then he discharged his pistol into the air as a warning. The man promptly dodged behind a row of peach trees, but kept on running as hard as ever.  The Rover boys were now thoroughly aroused, and all three started in pursuit of the two men. They saw the fellows leave the field and hurry down a lane leading to Swift River.  \"I believe they are going to the river. Maybe they have a boat,\" said Tom.  \"I shouldn't wonder,\" answered Dick.  \"I wish they would take to a boat,\" said Sam. \"We could follow them easily--in Dan Bailey's boat.\"  \"Hi, where are you?\" came a shout from behind, and they saw Jack Ness returning. \"Your uncle and aunt want you to be careful--they are afraid those villains will shoot you.\"  \"We'll be careful,\" answered Tom. \"But we are going to capture them if it can be done,\" he added, sturdily.  The hired man had reloaded the shotgun and also brought some additional ammunition with him. He was nervous and the boys could readily see that he did not relish continuing the pursuit.  \"We can't do nothin' in the dark,\" he grumbled. \"Let us wait till morning.\"  \"No, I am going after them now,\" answered Dick, decidedly.  \"So am I,\" added Sam and Tom.  They were going forward as rapidly as the semi-darkness would permit. The ground was more or less uncertain, and once the youngest Rover went into a mud hole, splashing the mud up into Jack Ness' face.  \"Hi, stop that!\" spluttered the hired man. \"Want to put my eye out?\"  \"Excuse me, Jack, I didn't see the hole,\" answered Sam.  \"It ain't safe to walk here in the dark--somebody might break a leg.\"  \"If you want to go back you can do so,\" put in Dick. \"Give Tom the shotgun.\"  \"Oh--er--I'm goin' if you be,\" answered Jack Ness. He was ashamed to let them know how much of a coward he really was.  It was quite a distance to Swift River, which at this point ran among a number of stately willows. As the boys gained the water's edge they saw a boat putting out not a hundred feet away.  \"There they are!\" cried Dick.  \"Stop!\" yelled Tom. \"Stop, unless you want to be shot!\"  \"We'll do a little shooting ourselves if you are not careful!\" came back in a harsh voice.  \"Take care! Take care!\" cried Jack Ness, in terror, and ran to hide behind a handy tree.  The two men in the boat were putting down the stream with all speed. The current, always strong, soon carried them around a bend and out of sight.  It must be confessed that the boys were in a quandary. They did not wish to give up the chase, yet they realized that the escaping men might be desperate characters and ready to put up a hard fight if cornered.  \"Jack, I think you had better run over to the Ditwold house and tell them what is up,\" said "]]]
