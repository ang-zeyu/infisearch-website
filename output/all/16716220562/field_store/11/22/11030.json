[Footnote 39: The original lease may be found incorporated in Alleyn _v._ Street, Coram Rege, 1599-1600, printed in full by Wallace, _The First London Theatre_, pp. 163-80, and again in Alleyn _v._ Burbage, Queen's Bench, 1602, Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 267-75. The lease, I think, was in English not Latin, and hence is more correctly given in the first document; in the second document the scrivener has translated it into Latin. The lease is also given in part on page 187.]  [Footnote 40: This part of the property was claimed by the Earl of Rutland, and was being used by him. For a long time it was the subject of dispute. Ultimately, it seems, the Earl secured the title, as he had always had the use of the property. This probably explains why Burbage did not attempt to erect his playhouse there.]  [Footnote 41: The document by error reads \"brick wall\" but the mistake is obvious, and the second version of the lease does not repeat the error. This clause merely means that the ditch, not the brick wall, constituted the western boundary of the property.]  The lease was formally signed on April 13, 1576, and Burbage entered into the possession of his property. Since the terms of the lease are important for an understanding of the subsequent history of the playhouse, I shall set these forth briefly:  First, the lease was to run for twenty-one years from April 13, 1576, at an annual rental of £14.  Secondly, Burbage was to spend before the expiration of ten years the sum of £200 in rebuilding and improving the decayed tenements.  Thirdly, in view of this expenditure of £200, Burbage was to have at the end of the ten years the right to renew the lease at the same rental of £14 a year for twenty-one years, thus making the lease good in all for thirty-one years:       And the said Gyles Alleyn and Sara his wife did thereby      covenant with the said James Burbage that they should and      would at any time within the ten years next ensuing at or      upon the lawful request or demand of the said James Burbage      make or cause to be made to the said James Burbage a new      lease or grant like to the same presents for the term of one      and twenty years more, to begin from the date of making the      same lease, yielding therefor the rent reserved in the      former indenture.[42]  [Footnote 42: Quoted from Burbage _v._ Alleyn, Court of Requests, 1600, Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 182. I have stripped the passage of some of its legal verbiage.]  Fourthly, it was agreed that at any time before the expiration of the lease, Burbage might take down and carry away to his own use any building that in the mean time he might have erected on the vacant ground for the purpose of a playhouse:       And farther, the said Gyles Alleyn and Sara his wife did      covenant and grant to the said James Burbage that it should      and might be lawful to the said James Burbage (in      consideration of the imploying and bestowing the foresaid      two hundred pounds in forme aforesaid) at any time or times      before the end of the said term of one and twenty years, to      have, take down, and carry away to his own proper use for      ever all such buildings and other things as should be      builded, erected, or set up in or upon the gardens and void      grounds by the said James, either for a theatre or playing      place, or for any other lawful use, without any stop, claim,      let, trouble, or interruption of the said Gyles Alleyn and      Sara his wife.[43]  [Footnote 43: Quoted from Burbage _v._ Alleyn, Court of Requests, 1600, Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 182.]  Protected by these specific terms, Burbage proceeded to the erection of his playhouse. He must have had faith and abundant courage, for he was a poor man, quite unequal to the large expenditures called for by his plans. A person who had known him for many years, deposed in 1592 that \"James Burbage was not at the time of the first beginning of the building of the premises worth above one hundred marks[44] in all his substance, for he and this deponent were familiarly acquainted long before that time and ever since.\"[45] We are not surprised to learn, therefore, that he was \"constrained to borrow diverse sums of money,\" and that he actually pawned the lease itself to a money-lender.[46] Even so, without assistance, we are told, he \"should never be able to build it, for it would cost five times as much as he was worth.\"  [Footnote 44: That is, about £80.]  [Footnote 45: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 134; cf. p. 153.]  [Footnote 46: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 151. Cuthbert Burbage declared in 1635: \"The Theatre he built with many hundred pounds taken up at interest.\" (Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 317.)]  Fortunately he had a wealthy brother-in-law, John Brayne,[47] a London grocer, described as \"worth five hundred pounds at the least, and by common fame worth a thousand marks.\"[48] In some way Brayne became interested in the new venture. Like Burbage, he believed that large profits would flow from such a novel undertaking; and as a result he readily agreed to share the expense of erecting and maintaining the building. Years later members of the Brayne faction asserted that James Burbage \"induced\" his brother-in-law to venture upon the enterprise by unfairly representing the great profits to ensue;[49] but the evidence, I think, shows that Brayne eagerly sought the partnership. Burbage himself asserted in 1588 that Brayne \"practiced to obtain some interest therein,\" and presumed \"that he might easily compass the same by reason that he was natural brother\"; and that he voluntarily offered to \"bear and pay half the charges of the said building then bestowed and thereafter to be bestowed\" in order \"that he might have the moiety[50] of the above named Theatre.\"[51] As a further inducement, so the Burbages asserted, he promised that \"for that he had no children,\" the moiety at his death should go to the children of James Burbage, \"whose advancement he then seemed greatly to tender.\"  [Footnote 47: The name is often spelled \"Braynes.\"]  [Footnote 48: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 109.]  [Footnote 49: See Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 139 _seq._]  [Footnote 50: That is, half-interest.]  [Footnote 51: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 40.]  Whatever caused Brayne to interest himself in the venture, he quickly became fired with such hopes of great gain that he not only spent upon the building all the money he could gather or borrow, but sold his stock of groceries for £146, disposed of his house for £100, even pawned his clothes, and put his all into the new structure. The spirit in which he worked to make the venture a success, and the personal sacrifices that he and his wife made, fully deserve the quotation here of two legal depositions bearing on the subject:       This deponent, being servant, in Bucklersbury, aforesaid, to      one Robert Kenningham, grocer, in which street the said John      Brayne dwelled also, and of the same trade, he, the said      Brayne, at the time he joined with the said James Burbage in      the aforesaid lease, was reputed among his neighbors to be      worth one thousand pounds at the least, and that after he      had joined with the said Burbage in the matter of the      building of the said Theatre, he began to slack his own      trade, and gave himself to the building thereof, and the      chief care thereof he took upon him, and hired workmen of      all sorts for that purpose, bought timber and all other      things belonging thereunto, and paid all. So as, in this      deponent's conscience, he bestowed thereupon for his owne      part the sum of one thousand marks at the least, in so much      as his affection was given so greatly to the finishing      thereof, in hope of great wealth and profit during their      lease, that at the last he was driven to sell to this      deponent's father his lease of the house wherein he dwelled      for £100, and to this deponent all such wares as he had left      and all that belonged thereunto remaining in the same, for      the sum of £146 and odd money, whereof this deponent did pay      for him to one Kymbre, an ironmonger in London, for iron      work which the said Brayne bestowed upon the said Theatre,      the sum of £40. And afterwards the said Brayne took the      matter of the said building so upon him as he was driven to      borrow money to supply the same, saying to this deponent      that his brother Burbage was not able to help the same, and      that he found not towards it above the value of fifty      pounds, some part in mony and the rest in stuff.[52]  [Footnote 52: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 136.]  In reading the next deposition, one should bear in mind the fact that the deponent, Robert Myles, was closely identified with the Brayne faction, and was, therefore, a bitter enemy to the Burbages. Yet his testimony, though prejudiced, gives us a vivid picture of Brayne's activity in the building of the Theatre:       So the said John Brayne made a great sum of money of purpose      and intent to go to the building of the said playhouse, and      thereupon did provide timber and other stuff needful for the      building thereof, and hired carpenters and plasterers for      the same purpose, and paid the workmen continually. So as he      for his part laid out of his own purse and what upon credit      about the same to the sum of £600 or £700 at the least. And      in the same time, seeing the said James Burbage nothing able      either of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],["title","Shakespearean Playhouses (#7)"],["body","or by his credit to contribute any like      sum towards the building thereof, being then to be finished      or else to be lost that had been bestowed upon it already,      the said Brayne was driven to sell his house he dwelled in      in Bucklersbury, and all his stock that was left, and give      up his trade, yea in the end to pawn and sell both his own      garments and his wife's, and to run in debt to many for      money, to finish the said playhouse, and so to employ      himself only upon that matter, and all whatsoever he could      make, to his utter undoing, for he saieth that in the latter      end of the finishing thereof, the said Brayne and his wife,      the now complainants, were driven to labor in the said work      for saving of some of the charge in place of two laborers,      whereas the said James Burbage went about his own business,      and at sometimes when he did take upon him to do some thing      in the said work, he would be and was allowed a workman's      hire as other the workman there had.[53]  [Footnote 53: Brayne _v._ Burbage, 1592. Printed in full by Wallace, _op cit._ p. 141.]  The last fling at Burbage is quite gratuitous; yet it is probably true that the main costs of erecting the playhouse fell upon the shoulders of Brayne. The evidence is contradictory; some persons assert that Burbage paid half the cost of the building,[54] others that Brayne paid nearly all,[55] and still others content themselves with saying that Brayne paid considerably more than half. The last statement may be accepted as true. The assertion of Gyles Alleyn in 1601, that the Theatre was \"erected at the costs and charges of one Brayne and not of the said James Burbage, to the value of one thousand marks,\"[56] is doubtless incorrect; more correct is the assertion of Robert Myles, executor of the Widow Brayne's will, in 1597: \"The said John Brayne did join with the said James [Burbage] in the building aforesaid, and did expend thereupon greater sums than the said James, that is to say, at least five or six hundred pounds.\"[57] Since there is evidence that the playhouse ultimately cost about £700,[58] we might hazard the guess that of this sum Brayne furnished about £500,[59] and Burbage about £200. To equalize the expenditure it was later agreed that \"the said Brayne should take and receive all the rents and profits of the said Theatre to his own use until he should be answered such sums of money which he had laid out for and upon the same Theatre more than the said Burbage had done.\"[60]  [Footnote 54: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 213, 217, 263, 265, _et al._]  [Footnote 55: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 137, 141, 142, 148, 153.]  [Footnote 56: Alleyn _v._ Burbage, Star Chamber Proceedings, 1601-02; printed by Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 277.]  [Footnote 57: Myles _v._ Burbage and Alleyn, 1597; printed by Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 159; cf. pp. 263, 106, 152.]  [Footnote 58: See Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 277.]  [Footnote 59: This agrees with the claim of Brayne's widow.]  [Footnote 60: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 120.]  But if Burbage at the outset was \"nothing able to contribute any\" great sum of ready money towards the building of the first playhouse, he did contribute other things equally if not more important. In the first place, he conceived the idea, and he carried it as far towards realization as his means allowed. In the second place, he planned the building--its stage as well as its auditorium--to meet the special demands of the actors and the comfort of the audience. This called for bold originality and for ingenuity of a high order, for, it must be remembered, he had no model to study--he was designing the first structure of its kind in England.[61] For this task he was well prepared. In the first place, he was an actor of experience; in the second place, he was the manager of one of the most important troupes in England; and, in the third place, he was by training and early practice a carpenter and builder. In other words, he had exact knowledge of what was needed, and the practical skill to meet those needs.  [Footnote 61: Mr. E.K. Chambers (_The Mediæval Stage_, I, 383, note 2; II, 190, note 4) calls attention to a \"theatre\" belonging to the city of Essex as early as 1548. Possibly the Latin document he cites referred to an amphitheatre of some sort near the city which was used for dramatic performances; at any rate \"in theatro\" does not necessarily imply the existence of a playhouse (cf., for example, _op. cit._, I, 81-82). There is also a reference (quoted by Chambers, _op. cit._, II, 191, note 1, from _Norfolk Archæology_, XI, 336) to a \"game-house\" built by the corporation of Yarmouth in 1538 for dramatic performances. What kind of house this was we do not know, but the corporation leased it for other purposes, with the proviso that it should be available \"at all such times as any interludes or plays should be ministered or played.\" Howes, in his continuation of Stow's _Annals_ (1631), p. 1004, declares that before Burbage's time he \"neither knew, heard, nor read of any such theatres, set stages, or playhouses as have been purposely built, within man's memory\"; and Cuthbert Burbage confidently asserted that his father \"was the first builder of playhouses\"--an assertion which, I think, cannot well be denied.]  The building that he designed and erected he named--as by virtue of priority he had a right to do--\"The Theatre.\"  Of the Theatre, unfortunately, we have no pictorial representation, and no formal description, so that our knowledge of its size, shape, and general arrangement must be derived from scattered and miscellaneous sources. That the building was large we may feel sure; the cost of its erection indicates as much. The Fortune, one of the largest and handsomest of the later playhouses, cost only £520, and the Hope, also very large, cost £360. The Theatre, therefore, built at a cost of £700, could not have been small. It is commonly referred to, even so late as 1601, as \"the great house called the Theatre,\" and the author of _Skialetheia_ (1598) applied to it the significant adjective \"vast.\" Burbage, no doubt, had learned from his experience as manager of a troupe the pecuniary advantage of having an auditorium large enough to receive all who might come. Exactly how many people his building could accommodate we cannot say. The Reverend John Stockwood, in 1578, exclaims bitterly: \"Will not a filthy play, with the blast of a trumpet, sooner call thither a thousand than an hour's tolling of the bell bring to the sermon a hundred?\"[62] And Fleetwood, the City Recorder, in describing a quarrel which took place in 1584 \"at Theatre door,\" states that \"near a thousand people\" quickly assembled when the quarrel began.  [Footnote 62: The rest of his speech indicates that he had the Theatre in mind. The passage, of course, is rhetorical.]  In shape the building was probably polygonal, or circular. I see no good reason for supposing that it was square; Johannes de Witt referred to it as an \"amphitheatre,\" and the Curtain, erected the following year in imitation, was probably polygonal.[63] It was built of timber, and its exterior, no doubt, was--as in the case of subsequent playhouses--of lime and plaster. The interior consisted of three galleries surrounding an open space called the \"yard.\" The German traveler, Samuel Kiechel, who visited London in the autumn of 1585, described the playhouses--i.e., the Theatre and the Curtain--as \"singular [_sonderbare_] houses, which are so constructed that they have about three galleries, one above the other.\"[64] And Stephen Gosson, in _Plays Confuted_ (_c._ 1581) writes: \"In the playhouses at London, it is the fashion for youths to go first into the yard, and to carry their eye through every gallery; then, like unto ravens, where they spy the carrion, thither they fly, and press as near to the fairest as they can.\" The \"yard\" was unroofed, and all persons there had to stand during the entire performance. The galleries, however, were protected by a roof, were divided into \"rooms,\" and were provided for the most part with seats. Gyles Alleyn inserted in the lease he granted to Burbage the following condition:       And further, that it shall or may [be] lawful for the said      Gyles and for his wife and family, upon lawful request      therefor made to the said James Burbage, his executors or      assigns, to enter or come into the premises, and there in      some one of the upper rooms to have such convenient place to      sit or stand to see such plays as shall be there played,      freely without anything therefor paying.[65]  [Footnote 63: One cannot be absolutely sure, yet the whole history of early playhouses indicates that the Theatre was polygonal (or circular) in shape. The only reason for suspecting that it might have been square, doubtfully presented by T.S. Graves in \"The Shape of the First London Theatre\" (_The South Atlantic Quarterly_, July, 1914), seems to me to deserve no serious consideration.]  [Footnote 64: Quoted by W.B. Rye, _England as Seen by Foreigners_, p. 88.]  [Footnote 65: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 177.]  The stage was a platform, projecting into the yard, with a tiring-house at the rear, and a balcony overhead. The details of the stage, no doubt, were subject to alteration as experience suggested, for its materials were of wood, and histrionic and dramatic art were both undergoing rapid development.[66] The furnishings and decorations, as in the case of modern playhouses, seem to have been ornate. Thus T[homas] W[hite], in _A Sermon Preached at Pawles Crosse, on Sunday the Thirde of November, 1577_, exclaims: \"Behold the sumptuous Theatre houses, a continual monument of London's prodigality\"; John Stockwood, in _A Sermon Preached at Paules Cross, 1578_, refers to it as \"the gorgeous playing place erected in the Fields\"; and Gabriel Harvey could think of no more appropriate epithet for it than \"painted\"--\"painted theatres,\" \"painted"]]]
