The only {34} difference between the Venizelos and the Gounaris Cabinets--the difference which brought about the recent crisis and the change of Government--was one regarding the danger of immediate action, but did not affect the basis of Greek policy.[3]  That, by all the evidence available, was the truth.  M. Gounaris thought as M. Venizelos thought, as King Constantine thought, as, indeed, every Greek capable of forming an opinion on international affairs thought--namely that, if Greece were to fight at all, interest and sentiment alike impelled her to fight on the side of the Entente.[4]  The only question was whether she should enter the field then, and if so, on what conditions.  M. Venizelos persisted in declaring that the Dardanelles expedition presented \"a great, a unique opportunity,\" which he prayed, \"God grant that Greece may not miss.\" [5]  His successors had no wish to miss the opportunity--if such it was.  But neither had they any wish to leap in the dark.  M. Gounaris and his colleagues lacked the Cretan's infinite capacity for taking chances.  Even in war, where chance plays so great a part, little is gained except by calculation: the enterprise which is not carefully meditated upon in all its details is rarely crowned with success.  And so when, on 12 April, the representatives of the Entente signified to M. Gounaris their readiness to give Greece, in return for her co-operation against Turkey, the \"territorial acquisitions in the vilayet of Aidin,\" suggested {35} to his predecessor, M. Gounaris tried to ascertain exactly the form of the co-operation demanded and the extent of the \"territorial acquisitions in the vilayet of Aidin\" offered.  The British Minister replied as to the first point that, having no instructions, he was unable to give any details; and as for the second, that it referred to the \"very important concessions on the Asia Minor coast\" mentioned in Sir Edward Grey's communication of January.  On being further pressed, he said it meant \"Smyrna and a substantial portion of the hinterland\"--a definition with which his Russian and French colleagues were inclined to concur, though both said that they had no instructions on the subject.  Then M. Gounaris asked whether their Excellencies had transmitted to their respective Governments M.  Venizelos's interpretation of Sir Edward Grey's offer regarding its geographical limits.  The British Minister replied that he had no official knowledge of that interpretation; he had only heard of it semi-officially and had transmitted it to his Government, but had received no answer.  The Russian Minister replied that he had transmitted nothing on the subject to his Government, as he had been informed of it in but a vague way by the late Cabinet.  The French Minister stated that the subject had never been mentioned to him, and consequently he had not been in a position to make any communication to his Government.[6]  Thus the grandiose Asiatic dominion of which M. Venizelos spoke so eloquently dwindled to \"Smyrna and a substantial portion of the hinterland.\"  However, the King, the General Staff, and the Cabinet went on with their work, and were joined by Prince George, King Constantine's brother, who had come from Paris to Athens for the express purpose of discussing with the Government the question of entering the war against Turkey on the basis of guarantees to be determined by negotiations of which Paris might be the centre.  In that order of ideas, they had already indicated as the best guarantee the simultaneous entry of Bulgaria, who, according to news from the Entente capitals, was on the point of joining.  But this condition having proved {36} unrealisable--Bulgaria refusing to be bought except, if at all, at a price of Greek territory which Greece would on no account pay--they dropped it and set about considering by what other combinations they could come in without compromising their country's vital interests. The upshot of their deliberations was a proposal, dated 14 April, to the following effect:  If the Allies would give a formal undertaking to guarantee during the War, and for a certain period after its termination, the integrity of her territories, Greece would join them with all her military and naval forces in a war against Turkey, the definite objective of which would be the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire; for, unless the Ottoman Empire disappeared, the Greek hold on Smyrna would not be very firm. It was further stipulated that the Allies should define the territorial compensations as well as the facilities regarding money and war material which they would accord Greece in order to enable her to do her part of belligerent efficiently.  On these conditions Greece would assume the obligation to enter the field as soon as the Allies were ready to combine their forces with hers.  All military details were to be settled between the respective Staffs and embodied in a joint Military Convention, with this sole reservation that, if Bulgaria continued to stand out, the Greek Army's sphere of action could not be placed outside European Turkey.  In an explanatory Note added a few days later, at the instance of the General Staff, stress was laid upon the ambiguous attitude of Bulgaria, on account of which the opinion was expressed that the Allies should be prepared to contribute forces which, combined with the Greek, would equal the united Turkish and Bulgarian forces, and that the sphere of Greek action should be limited to the west of the Gallipoli Peninsula; but it was agreed that, if the Allies wished it, they should have the military assistance of Greece on the Gallipoli Peninsula too, provided that they landed their own troops first.[7]  Of these proposals, which were not put forward as final, but rather as a basis of discussion, the Entente Powers did not condescend to take any notice.  Only unofficially {37} the Greek Minister in Paris, on approaching M. Delcassé, was told that, since the Hellenic Government viewed the Dardanelles enterprise in a different light from them, an understanding seemed impossible and discussion useless; for the rest, that enterprise, for which England had desired the co-operation of the Greeks, was now carried on without them, and the situation was no longer the same as it was some days before.  Alarmed by this snub, and anxious to dissipate any misunderstandings and doubts as to its dispositions towards the Entente, the Hellenic Government assured M. Delcassé that it continued always animated by the same desire to co-operate and would like to make new proposals, but before doing so it wished to know what proposals would be acceptable.  M. Delcassé replied that he could not even semi-officially say what proposals would be acceptable.[8]  But M.  Guillemin, his former collaborator and later French Minister at Athens, then on a flying visit there, advised M. Zographos to abandon all conditions and take pot luck with the Allies.  This notion succeeded to the extent that Greece proposed to offer to enter the war against Turkey with her naval forces only, reserving her army for her own protection against Bulgaria.[9]  The Entente Powers intimated through M. Delcassé that they would accept such an offer, provided it was made without any conditions.[10]  Before deciding, Greece wanted to be assured that the integrity of her territory during the War and in the treaty of peace would be respected, that all the necessary money and material would be forthcoming, and that the compensations in Asia Minor allotted to her would represent approximately the area indicated by M. Venizelos.  If it was found that on these three points the Hellenic Government interpreted the intentions of the Entente Powers correctly, it would immediately submit a Note in which the three points would be mentioned as going of their own accord, so that the official reply of the Entente might cover, not only the offer, but also its interpretation thus formulated.[11] {38} M. Delcassé refused to listen to any points: Greece, he insisted irritably, should enter the alliance without conditions, coupling her offer simply with \"hopes to have the benefit of full solidarity with her allies, whence results a guarantee of her territorial integrity,\" and \"entrusting the full protection of her vital interests to the three Entente Powers.\"  The formula was not incompatible with the best construction which one chose to put upon it; and Prince George--who had returned to Paris directly after the first offer and acted as a personal representative of King Constantine, together with the official representative of the Hellenic Government--warmly advocated its adoption, pleading that, if Greece did come in without delay and without conditions, she might safely trust the Allies.[12]  Whether Prince George's plea sprang from blind faith or from far-sighted fear, is a question upon which the sequel may throw some light; for the present enough to state that it produced no effect.  In a matter concerning the integrity of national territory acquired so dearly, King Constantine felt that he could not afford to allow any ambiguity or uncertainty: he was willing to waive the other two points, but not that.  He therefore begged his brother to see M. Poincaré and solicit in his name the President's help to secure that indispensable assurance.  \"The essential thing,\" he said, \"is that the Entente Powers should give us a solemn promise that they will respect and make others respect, until the re-establishment of peace, our territorial integrity, and that they will not permit any damage to it by the future Peace Treaty.  Remark to him that Greece has the right to be astonished that friendly Powers ready to accept her as an ally decline to explain themselves clearly with her.\" [13]  What was in the King's mind may be seen from the President's answer: The Powers did not wish to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22689"],["title","The Confessions of a Caricaturist, Vol. 2 (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net           [Illustration: AN ARTISTIC JOKE.   _A London Slum.
