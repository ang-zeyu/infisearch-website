[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22636"],["title","A Middle High German Primer (#3)"],["body","before {l} + consonant, before {hh}, {ch} (= Germanic {k}), and often before {r} + consonant, and before {h} (= Germanic {h}), as Upper German {haltit} beside Upper Franconian {heltit}, _he holds_, inf. {haltan}; UG. {altiro} beside UF. {eltiro}, _older_; UG. {sachit} beside UF. {sehhit}, _he quarrels_, inf. {sachan}, Goth. {sakan}; UG. {warmen} beside {wermen}, Goth. {warmjan}, _to warm_; UG. {slahit} beside {slehit}, _he strikes_, inf. OHG. {slahan}, Goth. {slahan}.  3. In words ending in {-nissi}, {-nissa}, or {-līh}, as {firstantnissi}, _understanding_; {infancnissa}, _assumption_; {kraftlīh}, _strong_; {tagalīh}, _daily_.  Umlaut must have taken place earlier in the spoken language than it is expressed in late OHG. and early MHG. manuscripts, because the {ī̆} which caused the umlaut was weakened to {e} in MHG. (§7) and {j} had disappeared except between vowels. The vowels and diphthongs which underwent umlaut in MHG. are a, o, u, ā, ō, ū, ou, uo. The umlaut of all these sounds was completed by about the year 1200.  a > e: {gast}, _guest_, pl. {geste} (OHG. {gesti}); {lamp}, _lamb_, pl. {lember} (OHG. {lembir}); inf. {graben}, _to dig_, pres. second and third pers. sing. {grebes(t)}, {grebet} (OHG. {grebis}, {grebit}); {lanc}, _long_, beside {lenge} (OHG. {lengī}), _length_; {brennen}, Goth. {brannjan}, _to burn_; {bette} (OHG. {betti}), _bed_.  a > ä: From the twelfth century onwards the umlaut of {a} also occurs--often beside forms without umlaut--in words containing the consonant combinations which prevented umlaut from taking place in OHG., as pl. {mähte} (OHG. {mahti}), _powers_; {geslähte} (OHG. {gislahti}), _race_, _generation_; {wähset} (OHG. {wahsit}), _he grows_; {wärmen} (OHG. {warmen}, older {*warmjan}), _to warm_; Upper German {älter} (OHG. {altiro}), _older_; {kälte} (OHG. {kaltī}), _coldness_; {hältet} (OHG. {haltit}), _he holds_; {äher} (OHG. {ahir}), _ear of corn_; {slähet} (OHG. {slahit}), _he strikes_. It also occurs in derivatives ending in {-līch}, {-līn}, as {mänlīch}, _manly_, {schämelīch}, _shameful_, {tägelīch}, _daily_, {väterlīch}, _fatherly_, {väterlīn}, dim. of {vater}, _father_. It is likewise met with in MHG. words which originally had an {i} in the third syllable, the vowel of the second syllable having become {i} by assimilation, as {frävele} (OHG. {frafali}), _bold_, pl. {mägede} (OHG. {magadi}), _maids_, pl. {zäher(e)} (OHG. {zahari}), _tears_. See §2, Note.  o > ö: Although {ö}, the umlaut of {o}, is common in MHG. and still commoner in NHG., yet all words containing this umlaut are really new formations due to levelling or analogy, because primitive Germanic {u} (§15) did not become {o} in OHG. when followed by an {ī̆} or {j} in the next syllable. Examples are: {boc}, _he-goat_, beside dim. {böcklīn} (OHG. {pochilī}); {dorf}, _village_, beside pl. {dörfer}; {got}, _God_, beside {götinne}, _goddess_; {hof}, _court_, beside {hövesch}, _courtly_; {loch} (OHG. {loh}), _hole_, beside pl. {löcher} (OHG. {lohhir}); {tohter}, _daughter_, beside dim. {töhterlīn}; pret. subj. {möhte} (OHG. {mohti}), _I might_; {törste} (OHG. {torsti}), _I might dare_.  u > ü: {dünne} (OHG. {dunni}), _thin_; {künne} (OHG. {kunni}), _race_, _generation_; pl. {süne} (OHG. {suni}), _sons_; {tür} (OHG. {turi}), _door_; pret. subj. {züge} (OHG. {zugi}), inf. {ziehen}, _to draw_.    NOTE.--In Upper German certain consonant combinations often   prevented umlaut from taking place where it might be expected. Of   these the principal are:--    1. Before a liquid + consonant, as {hulde} (OHG. {huldī}), _favour_;   {schuldec} (OHG. {sculdīg}), _guilty_; {gedultec} (OHG. {gidultīg}),   _indulgent_; {burge} (OHG. {burgi}), dat. of {burc}, _city_;   {sturbe} (OHG. {sturbi}), pret. subj. of {stërben}, _to die_;   {wurfe} (OHG. {wurfi}), pret. subj. of {wërfen}, _to throw_, cp.   2 above.    2. {u} fluctuates with {ü} when followed by a nasal + consonant,   as {dunken}, _to seem_, {umbe}, _about_, {wunne}, _joy_, beside   {dünken}, {ümbe} (OHG. {umbi}), {wünne}. This fluctuation is   especially common in the pret. subjunctive, as {bunde}, {sunge},   beside {bünde}, {sünge}, inf. {binden}, _to bind_, {singen}, _to   sing_.    3. {u} fluctuates with {ü} when followed by {gg}, {ck}, {pf}, {tz},   {ȥȥ}, {st}, {ch}, and {g}, as {brugge}, {brügge}, {brucke},   {brücke}, _bridge_; {mugge}, {mügge}, {mucke}, {mücke}, _midge_;   {drucken}, {drücken}, _to press_; {hupfen}, {hüpfen}, _to hop_;   {schupfen}, {schüpfen}, _to push_; {nutzen}, {nützen}, _to use_;   pret. subj. {fluȥȥe}, {flüȥȥe}; {schuȥȥe}, {schüȥȥe}, inf.   {flieȥen}, _to flow_, {schieȥen}, _to shoot_; pl. {bruste},   {brüste}, _breasts_; {kuchen}, {küchen}, _kitchen_; pret. subj.   {fluge}, {flüge}, inf. {fliegen}, _to fly_.  ā > æ: {lære} (OHG. {lāri}), _empty_; {mære} (OHG. {māri}), _renowned_; {sæjen} (OHG. {sājan}), _to sow_; pret. subj. {næme} (OHG. {nāmi}), pl. {næmen} (OHG. {nāmīm}), inf. {nëmen}, _to take_.  ō > œ: {hœher} (OHG. {hōhiro}), _higher_; {hœhest} (OHG. {hōhisto}), _highest_; {hœren} (OHG. {hōren}, from older {*hōrjan}), _to hear_; {schœne} (OHG. {scōni}), _beautiful_.  ū > iu: pl. {briute} (OHG. {brūti}), _brides_; {hiuser} (OHG. {hūsir}), _houses_.  Traces of the umlaut of {ū}, written {iu} (= {ǖ}), occur in late OHG. monuments of the tenth century. It is common in the writings of Notker († 1022), as {hiute} older {hūti}, _skins_; {chriuter} older {chrūtir}, _herbs_. In other writings of the tenth to the twelfth century the umlaut of {ū} is seldom found. Umlaut did not take place in Upper German before a following {m}, as {rūmen} from {*rūmjan}, _to make room_; {sūmen} from {*sūmjan}, _to tarry_.  ou > öu, often written {eu}, rarely {oi}, {öi}: {löufel} (OHG. {loufil}), _runner_; {löuber} (OHG. {loubir}), _leaves_.  Umlaut of {ou} did not take place in the combination {ouw} = OHG. {ouw}, {auw}, West Germanic {aww}, primitive Germanic {awj}, as {frouwe} (OHG. {frouwa}, prim. Germanic {*frawjō-}), _woman_; {ouwe} (OHG. {ouwa}, {auwia}, prim. Germanic {*a(ʒ)wjō-}), _meadow_; {frouwen} (OHG. {frouwen}, prim. Germanic {*frawjan}), _to rejoice_, and similarly {douwen}, _to digest_, {drouwen}, _to threaten_, {strouwen}, _to strew_. Forms like {fröuwen}, {döuwen}, {dröuwen}, {ströuwen} were analogical formations due to the influence of the pres. second and third pers. singular and the preterite which regularly had umlaut; see the Author’s Historical German Grammar, §232.  Umlaut of {ou} did not take place in Upper German before labials and {g}, as {erlouben}, _to allow_, {gelouben}, _to believe_, {houbet}, _head_, {koufen}, _to buy_, {troumen}, _to dream_, {toufen}, _to baptize_, {bougen}, _to bend_, {ougen}, _to show_, beside Middle German {erlöuben}, {gelöuben}, {höubet}, {köufen}, {tröumen}, {töufen}, {böugen}, {öugen}.  uo > üe: {grüene} (OHG. {gruoni}), _green_; {güete} (OHG. {guotī}), _goodness_; {vüeȥe} (OHG. {fuoȥi}), _feet_; pret. pl. subj. {vüeren} (OHG. {fuorīm}), _we might go_, inf. {varn}, _to fare_, _go_; {buoch}, _book_, dim. {büechlīn}; {muoter}, _mother_, dim. {müeterlīn}.   THE MHG. EQUIVALENTS OF THE OHG. VOWELS.  §11.  OHG. had the following short vowels, long vowels, and diphthongs:--    Short Vowels  a, e, ë,      i,         o,    u.   Long    „     ā, ē,         ī,         ō,    ū.   Diphthongs       ei,   ie (ia, ea), ou (au), uo.                          io (eo),                          iu.

ABLAUT (VOWEL GRADATION).  §12.  By ablaut is meant the gradation of vowels both in stem and suffix, which was chiefly caused by the primitive Indo-Germanic system of accentuation. See the Author’s Historical German Grammar, §23.  The vowels vary within certain series of related vowels, called ablaut-series. In MHG. there are six such series, which appear most clearly in the stem-forms of strong verbs. Four stem-forms are to be distinguished in a MHG. strong verb which has vowel gradation as the characteristic mark of its different stems:--(1) the present stem, to which belong all the forms of the present, (2) the stem of the first or third person of the preterite singular, (3) the stem of the preterite plural, to which belong the second person of the preterite singular and the whole of the preterite subjunctive, (4) the stem of the past participle.  By arranging the vowels according to these four stems we arrive at the following system:--          i.       ii.      iii.      iv.      I.  ī        ei, ē     i         i    II.  ie       ou, ō     u         o   III.  i, ë     a         u         u, o    IV.  ë        a         ā         o     V.  ë        a         ā         ë    VI.  a        uo        uo        a    NOTE.--1. On the difference between {ei} and {ē}, see §17; {ou} and   {ō}, §18; and in Series III {i} and {ë}, §14; {u} and {o}, §15.    2. Strong verbs belonging to Series II have {iu} in the indicative   pres. singular; and strong verbs belonging to Series III-V with {ë}   in the infinitive have {i} in the indicative pres. singular   (§§14, 16).  EXAMPLES.      I. snīden, _to cut_     snīde     sneit    sniten    gesniten;        līhen, _to lend_     līhe      lēch     lihen     gelihen.    II. biegen, _to bend_    biuge     bouc     bugen     gebogen;        sieden, _to seethe_  siude     sōt      suten     gesoten.   III. binden, _to bind_    binde     bant     bunden    gebunden;        hëlfen, _to help_    hilfe     half     hulfen    geholfen.    IV. nëmen, _to take_     nime      nam      nāmen     genomen.     V. gëben, _to give_     gibe      gap      gāben     gegëben.    VI. graben, _to dig_     grabe     gruop    gruoben   gegraben.  For further examples see the various classes of strong verbs §§76-86. Class VII of strong verbs embracing the old reduplicated verbs (§87) has been omitted from the ablaut-series, because the exact relation in which the vowel of the present stands to that of the preterite has not yet been satisfactorily explained.   OTHER VOWEL CHANGES.  §13.  Most of the following vowel changes took place in prehistoric times; but as they play an important part in the verbs and word-formation, &c., we shall give them here.   §14.  ë (= Indo-Germanic e) became i in the prehistoric period of all the Germanic languages:--  1. Before a nasal + consonant, as OE. {wind}, OHG. MHG. {wint}, Lat. {ventus}, _wind_; OHG. {fimf}, {finf}, Gr. πέντε, _five_. This explains why verbs like MHG. {binden}, _to bind_, {rinnen}, _to run_, {singen}, _to sing_, belong to the same ablaut-series as {hëlfen}, _to help_, {wërden}, _to become_.  [**non-utf-8] 1. Before a nasal + consonant, as OE. {wind}, OHG. MHG. {wint}, Lat. {ventus}, _wind_; OHG. {fimf}, {finf}, Gr. [pente], _five_. This explains why verbs like MHG. {binden}, _to bind_, {rinnen}, _to run_, {singen}, _to sing_, belong to the same ablaut-series as {hëlfen}, _to help_, {wërden}, _to become_.  2. Before other consonants when followed by an {ī̆} or {j} in the next syllable, and further in OHG. when followed by an {u} in the next syllable, as OHG. MHG. {ist}, Gr. ἐστί, _is_; OHG. {fihu}, Lat. {pecu}, _cattle_; {ërde} (OHG. {ërda}), _earth_, but {irdīn}, _earthen_; {ligen} (OHG. {liggen} from {*ligjan}), _to lie down_, {sitzen} (OHG. {sitzen} from {*sitjan}), _to sit_, but p.p. {gelëgen} (OHG. {gilëgan}), {gesëȥȥen} (OHG. {gisëȥȥan}). This explains why strong verbs belonging to the fourth (§§12, 82) and fifth (§§12, 83) ablaut-series have {i} throughout the present singular, and similarly in verbs belonging to the third (§§12, 81) series with {ë} in the infinitive, as    OHG. nëman,  _to take_, three persons sing. nimu, nimis(t), nimit.   MHG. nëmen,       „       „      „     „    nime, nimes(t), nimet.   OHG. gëban,  _to give_,   „      „     „    gibu, gibis(t), gibit.   MHG. gëben,       „       „      „     „    gibe, gibes(t), gibet.   OHG. hëlfan, _to help_,   „      „     „    hilfu, hilfis(t), hilfit.   MHG. hëlfen,      „       „      „     „    hilfe, hilfes(t), hilfet.   §15.  {u}, followed originally by an {ā̆}, {ō̆}, or {ē} in the next syllable, became {o} when not protected by a nasal + consonant or an intervening {ī̆} or {j}; hence the interchange between {u} and {o} in the preterite plural and past participle of verbs belonging to the second ablaut-series (§§12, 78), as {bugen} (OHG. {bugum}), _we bent_, p.p. {gebogen} (OHG. {gibogan}); in the p.p. of verbs belonging to the third ablaut-series (§§12, 81), as {gebunden} (OHG. {gibuntan}), but {geholfen} (OHG. {giholfan}); in weak verbs as {fürhten} (OHG. {furhten} from {*furhtjan}), _to fear_, beside pret. {vorhte} (OHG. {forhta}); {hügen} (OHG. {huggen} from {*hugjan}) beside {hogen} (OHG. {hogēn}), _to think_; in preterite presents like {durfen} (OHG. {durfum}), _we dare_, beside pret. {dorfte} (OHG. {dorfta}); in many nouns and adjectives, as {wolle} (OHG. {wolla}), _wool_, beside {wüllīn}, {wullīn}, _woollen_; {wolf} (stem {*wulfo-}), _wolf_, beside {wülpinne}, _she-wolf_; {vol}, _full_, beside {vülle} (OHG. {fullī}), _fulness_; {golt}, _gold_, beside {guldīn}, _golden_.   §16.  From primitive Germanic {eu} were developed two different diphthongs in OHG., viz. {eu} became {eo} (cp. §15), later {io}, when originally followed by an {ā̆}, {ō̆}, or {ē} in the next syllable, and this {io} was regularly developed to {ie} in MHG.; whereas {eu} became {iu} in OHG. when originally followed by an {ī̆, j} or {u} in the next syllable, and this {iu} became {ǖ} (written {iu}) in MHG., even after the {ī̆, j} or {u} had been weakened to {e}. This law explains the difference between the diphthong {ie} in the infinitive and the simple vowel {iu} (= {ǖ}) in the three persons singular of the present indicative of verbs belonging to the second ablaut-series (§§12, 78), as    OHG. biogan, _to bend_, pres. sing. biugu, biugis(t), biugit;   MHG. biegen,      „       „     „   biuge, biuges(t), biuget.  Cp. further {tief} (OHG. {tiof}), _deep_, beside OHG. {tiufī}, _depth_; {lieht} (OHG. {lioht}), _a light_, beside {liuhten} (OHG. {liuhten} from {*liuhtjan}), _to light_.    NOTE.--The {iu} in the above and similar examples must not be   confounded with the {iu} in the OHG. and MHG. combination {iuw}   which arose from prim. Germanic {eww} (= {euw}), and {ewj}, as   {triuwe} (OHG. {triuwi}, Goth. {triggws}), _true_; {triuwen},   {trūwen}, _to trust_, pret. {triuete}, {triute}, {trūte}; {riuwe}   (OHG. {riuwa}), _regret_, {bliuwen} (OHG. {bliuwan}, Goth.   {bliggwan}), _to strike_, and similarly, {briuwen}, _to brew_,   {kiuwen}, _to chew_, {riuwen}, _to regret_; {niuwe} (OHG. {niuwi},   Goth. {niujis}, prim. Germanic stem-form {*newja-}), _new_. This   {iu} before {w} never interchanged with MHG. {ie} from prim.   Germanic {eu}, and explains why the strong verbs {bliuwen}, &c. have   {iu} in all forms of the present.   §17.  Accented primitive Germanic {ai} (= Goth. {ái}) became {ē} in OHG. before {r, w}, Germanic {h} (cp. §23, 1), and finally; in MHG. it appears also as {ē} before the same consonants and finally, as {mēre}, {mēr} (OHG. {mēro}, Goth. {máiza}), _more_, {lēren} (OHG. {lēren}, Goth. {láisjan}), _to teach_; {sēle} (OHG. {sēla}, older {sēula}, Goth. {sáiwala}), _soul_; {snē} (OHG. {snēo}, Goth. {snáiws}), _snow_, gen.
