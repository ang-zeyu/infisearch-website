Please let me up, and I'll tell you all about it. I want you to help me. It isn't fair. I'm not getting a fair show.\"  \"Oh, that's the way, is it? Well, you're at the right shop. Nobody ever calls on Jolly Bill in vain. You get up and lift this automobile off my quivering frame and we'll see what we can do for you.\"  Glen crawled out and managed to lift the vehicle off the young man's body.  \"Now you can get up, can't you,\" he asked.  \"With your kind assistance, noble sir.\" He raised himself to a sitting position as he spoke. \"This is as far as I get without your aid.\"  Glen hardly knew how to help, though the conveyance told him that the young man was a cripple.  \"How shall I help you?\" he asked. \"Are your legs paralyzed?\"  \"Worse than that, young fellow. My legs are dead and buried.\"  \"I'm awfully sorry,\" said Glen, his heart stirred with sympathy. \"I'm glad you have such strong arms. They certainly are alive.\"  \"That's the way to talk about it, boy. Don't worry about what's gone. Look at what you have left. That's what I try to do, and that's why they call me Jolly Bill. Now, a big heave and I can stand on my pegs while you bring my Billy-cart up this way.\"  He was quite skillful about getting into his cart once Glen had him in the right position.  \"Now I'll let you push me home, boy--two blocks ahead and one to your right--and meantime you may tell me the sad story of your eventful career.\"  \"Promise that you won't give me up,\" said Glen.  \"Whew! That sounds awfully interesting. You must be a desperate character, and that perhaps explains your peculiar mode of rapid transit. I'm so curious I promise.\"  \"It isn't so awfully bad,\" said Glen, feeling that his new friend was poking fun. \"I ran away from the reform school, that's all.\"  \"I don't know how bad that is,\" was the reply. \"The question is are you reformed, are you reforming, or are you worse than ever?\"  \"I want to reform,\" declared Glen, the first confession of the kind he had ever made.  \"I suppose the best way to do it would be to go back to the school,\" suggested Jolly Bill.  \"That's what Mr. Gates said,\" admitted Glen. \"But I don't want to be taken back.\"  \"That sounds pretty fair. You don't want to be taken; you want to go. I want to go, but I have to be taken. I was hoping you were the boy to do some taking for me.\"  \"You mean take you around,\" exclaimed Glen.  \"That's about what I mean. I'm an important personage and wherever I travel I have to have a body guard.\"  \"I'd like to do it better than anything in the world!\"  \"I believe you're just the boy if the reform school could wait for you a week or two. I have a plan that will make me a fortune; but I can't work it out without a strong, energetic boy to help me.\"  \"I'm the boy,\" shouted Glen. \"Try me. What is it?\"  \"You won't give my secret away?\"  \"Never. Upon my--\"  \"Upon your what?\"  \"Oh, I suppose you'd say I didn't have any.\"  \"You were going to say upon your honor. Certainly you have honor. You make it every day. To prove my confidence I will tell you my secret. I was born in this neighborhood and lived here most of my life. A few years ago a terrible accident deprived me of my father and at the same time left me as you see me. I support my mother by selling real estate. Twenty miles or so from here I know of a great fortune. But it is hidden away, buried, choked up and forgotten. I have tried to get my friends to hunt this out for me but they do not see things my way. So I need a strong healthy boy to help me, and together we will find this treasure.\"     CHAPTER IV  HOW MOTHER CARES   Running away would be very popular with boys if they could be sure of finding such good friends as Glen had met. The reverse is more commonly true. Glen knew well enough that the boy on the road, trusting to chance for friends, is much more apt to fall a prey to people of the J. Jervice variety. He remembered the pitiful plight of a boy who had been returned to the school after falling into the hands of tramps, and he thanked an unknown Providence that he had tumbled into the kind arms of Jolly Bill.  Mother Spencer was just as kind and cheerful as her son, though she neither made jokes nor appreciated those offered by Will.  \"This is Glen Mason, mother,\" said Jolly Bill, when she came out to meet them. \"After he had committed assault and battery on my delicate frame, I prevailed on him to bring home the mangled remains.\"  \"You are hurt, Willie!\" she cried in alarm. \"Your face is scratched and there is blood. Is it serious?\"  \"I shall recover,\" said Will. \"I have been in rather worse accidents. Take a look at this other dusty, weary specimen. What do you recommend?\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" she apologized to Glen. \"I was anxious about my boy. I am every time he goes out. I'll just show you up to the bathroom. There is plenty of hot water and soap and towels, and I'll bring you a clean suit that Willie used to wear.\"  Glen reddened with embarrassment at this goodness.  \"Maybe you'd better not,\" he protested. \"You don't know who I am.\"  \"But I know what size you are,\" she insisted. \"This old suit of Willie's has been lying around for years, but it's perfectly good. Now you take and put it on.\"  \"Take it along and wear it,\" urged Jolly Bill. \"It's been shut up in the closet so long it may turn two or three handsprings when it gets out in the sunshine, but otherwise it will fit you all right. Mother's kept the moth out of it long enough.\"  Soaking in a tub of clean water after his hot and dusty day, with a nice suit of clean clothing ready to put on, Glen felt that he was indeed fortunate. He actually concluded that he was getting better treatment than he deserved. He was still embarrassed by the thought, when he went downstairs and found Will and his mother at the table.  \"I've told mother all about you,\" announced Bill. \"You have her official seal of approval.\"  \"Don't mind what he says,\" interrupted Mrs. Spencer. \"A boy who wants to do right always has a place with me. But you get a reserved seat because you're going to help Willie.\"  \"I hope I'll be able to. I'll surely try.\"  \"Oh, you're just the strong young fellow he needs. He's had the plan quite a while but so many people--\"  \"Not so very many, mother,\" interrupted Will. \"Very few people know of it.\"  \"Well, the people that you've told--you know how they have all acted or spoken as if it were a wild goose chase--\"  \"They think so; that's their privilege.\"  \"No it isn't. They shouldn't think so. You've studied it out and you know it's as bright a thought as ever helped any man to a fortune and I'm glad this big boy is going to help you work it.\"  \"And then I'll be rich enough to buy you a home, and to go to that big hospital and get my old pegs fixed up so they can put artificial legs on me that I really can walk on.\"  \"I'm mighty glad to help,\" said Glen. \"I'd do most anything for folks as good as you.\"  \"There, mother; that's an unsolicited testimonial to your particular brand of goodness,\" said Will. \"He didn't talk a bit that way when he met me first. Acted quite abrupt and seemed to want to get away.\"  \"I didn't know you then,\" objected Glen. \"I was trying to get away from everybody.\"  \"Pretty good horse-power you were putting into it, too,\" observed Will. \"That reminds me, boy. It is now time for you to unroll the full history of your eventful career.\"  \"There isn't very much that matters, until a few days ago,\" began Glen.  \"What's that?\" asked Mrs. Spencer. \"Did you say not much that matters? How old are you?\"  \"I was fifteen last May.\"  \"Fifteen years ago last May! Don't you know, Glen, that something happened then that mattered a wonderful lot to one person, even if it didn't then matter much to you. And it's been mattering ever since, to her.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Glen, \"my mother, you mean.\"  \"Yes, I mean your mother. And your father, too, as long as he lived. Don't you suppose it mattered to them that their boy should be so--\" she hesitated, groping for a word.  \"Pigheaded!\" volunteered Glen.  Mrs. Spencer looked shocked, and remonstrated: \"Why, Glen! I didn't say anything of the kind--wayward was the word I wanted.\"  But Jolly Bill clapped his hands in cheerful applause.  \"Good boy, Glen!\" he exclaimed. \"Pigheaded is the word. Bound to have your own way. Bound to have what you want. No self restraint at all. If you want it, nothing will do but you must have it, good or bad. Believe me, boy, that's the very word.\"  \"I wish you wouldn't interrupt me, Willie,\" objected Mrs. Spencer. \"I wasn't trying to preach a sermon to Glen and I don't know why you should. What I want to tell him is that every little thing about a boy matters to mother. It's always important to her what he does, and if he does wrong to-day she is sure that he certainly will do better to-morrow. Mother's going to be awfully glad when she hears about you, Glen, and I want you to tell me where I can write to her this very day. Now, go on and tell us about running away.\"  Glen was interrupted occasionally.  \"Oh, did you say Gates?\" cried Mrs. Spencer. \"Was it Jonathan Gates?\"  \"I believe I did hear his wife call him Jonathan once or twice, though mostly they all called him 'Father.'\"  \"It must be they,\" said Mrs. Spencer. \"They're just the people to take care of a boy that way. We know the Gateses very well and they're the salt of the earth. I wonder you ever had the heart to leave them.\"  Glen told why he had left and then related his further adventures with J. Jervice, his final escape, and his day of dread lest he should be apprehended.  \"I think I can tell you why Mr. J. Jervice didn't send after you,\" said Will. \"It's been his busy day. I just read about it in the evening paper. Excepting that it was funny I wondered what excuse they had for giving it so much space. But I now see why it is important. Look at this!\"  He handed Glen the paper folded back to a column headed: \"Peddler in Wrong Pew.\"  \"Every good citizen knows of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22644"],["title","The Boy Scout Treasure Hunters; Or, The Lost Treasure of Buffalo Hollow (#5)"],["body","new license ordinance but not every peddler. One came briskly to the county clerk's office this morning. He was not too rushed to stop and sell a patent tie clip to a man at the door.  \"'I'm a traveling merchant,' said he to our genial county clerk.  \"'Very good,' said the clerk. 'I see you are doing a little business.'  \"'Pretty fair,' agreed Mr. Peddler. 'But that ain't what--'  \"'Hold on a bit,' interrupted the clerk. 'First thing is a license.'  \"'I've got something more important, just now,' urged the peddler. 'I want to tell you about--'  \"'First things first,' persisted our efficient clerk. 'You must pay a license to peddle in this county.'  \"'But I don't want to peddle now. I want to lodge--'  \"'One thing at a time. You may lodge longer than you want if you break our ordinances. Get your license. Five dollars!'  \"'But I don't want a license. I want to give information--'  \"'No, no! You want to get information (our clerk is just bound to have his way). 'You should have information about our new license fee. Every peddler must pay it.'  \"'I'll not pay it. Five dollars is more'n I could make in a whole day, and I don't aim to be in your county that long. I'll go on.'  \"'Too late. You've made one sale that we know of. Five dollars or--'  \"'I can't, Mister. I can't pay that. You, just forget about it an' I'll tell you how we can divide ten dollars, easy money.'  \"'Trying to bribe a county officer! That's worse and worse. Here, Mr. Sheriff, you'd better look after this man.'  \"The man's name was J. Jervice and he found five dollars in his clothing before the sheriff had fully clamped his grip. He went away in great wrath, taking with him not only the objectionable license but also the valuable secret which was worth ten dollars--easy money.  \"The honest merchant who has a regular route does not object to the license. The objections come from these itinerant peddlers, who claim that they are just passing through. Our county officers will insist upon payment. They do not fear to discourage their visits for these fly-by-nights are the very men who cheat our citizens, sometimes stealing under guise of a sale and sometimes stealing outright. We do not say that this peddler looked suspicious, but we observed our sheriff taking a good mental picture of him.\"  \"Good-by, Mr. J. Jervice,\" exulted Glen, as he laid down the paper. \"I don't care if I never meet you again.\"  \"But I'm not sure that you won't,\" said Jolly Bill, with a purpose to tease. \"Now that Mr. Jervice has had to pay a five dollar license fee, all because he loved you so and wanted to see you safe home, he'll be apt to look for you.\"  \"He'd better not come near this house,\" declared Mrs. Spencer, energetically. \"I'll give him a piece of my mind if I see him, I can tell you.\"  \"I surely hope he'll come,\" said Jolly Bill. \"He deserves all he can get.\"  But neither Jolly Bill, Mrs. Spencer nor Glen were to be gratified with a sight of Mr. Jervice immediately, although they were by no means through with him.  Later in the evening after Glen had given Mrs. Spencer very efficient aid in helping her crippled son to his bed on the ground floor, she showed the boy up to a cozy little bedroom where he was to spend the night.  \"Have a good night, son,\" she said. \"I'm so glad you are going to help my boy, because you look like a boy with grit and determination, and I'll feel safe about him with you looking after him. It means a lot to us just now. It isn't so much that I care about the money, although Willie insists that I must have this home all clear of debt. But the main thing with me is to see my boy able to take care of himself. There's a place in New York where they can operate on him and then fix him up so he can walk all by himself. All we need is the money. It will be such a joy to me. Good night!\"     CHAPTER V  TREACHEROUS INDIANS AT BUFFALO LAKE   It was a couple of days later before Mr. William Spencer (sometimes known to his fellow citizens as Jolly Bill) fully explained to Glen the method by which he hoped to increase their fortunes. He had taken Glen into his home, had fed and provided for him and had given him some clothing. An automobile had brought them the twenty miles of their journey, early that morning, and had left them with their belongings at the house of a farmer, with whom Spencer was evidently on the best of terms. Now they stood on a knoll overlooking what seemed to Glen to be nothing but an immense field of growing corn.  \"There is our fortune,\" said Spencer.  \"That field of corn?\" asked Glen.  \"That is Buffalo Hollow and I repeat that there lies our fortune.\"  \"And how are we to get it?\"  \"That is your job. That's why I brought you.\"  \"What do you expect me to do. Take a spade and dig?\"  \"Perhaps! We shall see. Sit down while I tell you about this place. Buffalo Mound, over there, is the highest ground in this country. From its summit you can see into six counties. This big field before us is Buffalo Hollow. When I was a little chap I was told a great story about this by an old Indian. He said that years ago the Hollow was a beautiful lake fed by springs from Buffalo Mound. Some freighters carrying bullion camped here and were slaughtered by Indians. To hide the bullion until they could dispose of it they threw it in the lake. When they returned they could not find it readily, so they dammed the springs and drained the lake. Makes quite a romantic story, doesn't it?\"  \"Yes, but did it ever happen?\"  \"I believe there is some record of such a thing, but my private opinion is that the draining was done by some stingy owner who had little use for a lake and thought he saw an opportunity to secure twenty acres of good bottom land. Probably he thought he was a great economist. But as a matter of fact he did a very foolish thing. This prairie country is poverty stricken so far as lakes and woods are concerned. In the town I live in there are many wealthy men who take their families long distances every summer in order to reach a lake. A twenty acre lake is only a pool in the lake country, but out here it is worth more than a gold mine.\"  \"And you think if you could make it a lake again you could sell it to these wealthy people?\"  \"I know I could. I know an athletic club in town that would pay a big price for it. There are many of our wealthy men who would pay five hundred dollars for a hundred foot frontage, so that they might put up bungalows for summer residences. My plan is to find those choked springs, bring them again into their old channels, and convert the Hollow into a lake. Mr. Ryder, our farmer friend who now owns this farm, doesn't think much of my plan, and won't have anything to do with it any more than to sell me options on the land and the privilege of cutting this excellent stand of corn, and that is as far as my arrangements with him extend.\"  \"And what is the first thing for me to do?\" asked Glen.  \"Excellent talk, that, my boy. What would you advise as to the first thing.\"  \"I suppose you can't do much exploring while the corn stands. It should be cut.\"  \"It should, and it must be cut in the old fashioned way. Did you ever cut corn in the old fashioned way?\"  \"You mean with a corn-knife. I helped cut a hundred acres at the school last fall.\"  \"Well, there's only about five acres of this land in corn so the contract is smaller. The first thing is to borrow a corn-knife of our friend Ryder.\"  Glen's attack upon the field of corn began that very day. A year ago, at the reform school, he had hated this work; now, he enjoyed it. The corn was higher than his head, and the heavy stalks, piled on his left arm as he cut with his right, wore through his shirt and made an attempt upon his skin, but he did not complain. He was doing a work into which his heart entered, and so he was enjoying it.  Spencer could give no help at all. There are people, with like misfortune to his, who are able to make some sort of a shift with crutches, but Will could not use them at all. As Mrs. Spencer had explained to Glen, there had been some trouble in the amputation. All that was needed was money to go to a famous hospital and have things properly arranged and a pair of artificial legs fitted that would enable him to walk, run, race, dance or play the pipe organ. Will hoped to be successful enough to command the money for this and meantime he intended to be happy in the prospect. So he sat and watched Glen work, made suggestions, cracked jokes and drew diagrams of the surrounding country.  The day that Glen finished his work was very hot. He had been working hard in the hope of completing the job by nightfall and was wet and grimy with perspiration and dirt. As he carried an armful of stalks to the shock he noticed a boy standing there dressed in a khaki uniform of olive drab.  \"Wouldn't you like a little help?\" asked the boy.  \"I could use some,\" said Glen. \"But I have only one knife.\"  \"You rest, then, and let me use it awhile. I know how to cut corn.\"  \"You'll spoil your pretty suit.\"  \"This kind doesn't spoil. It's a scout uniform.\"  \"Perhaps it won't spoil for as long as you'll work,\" said Glen. \"What are you doing here?\"  \"We have a camp around the other side of the Mound. We only came yesterday or you would have seen some of us before now.\"  He was cutting cornstalks with a practised hand and Glen decided that he could trust him.  \"You can go ahead for awhile. I'll go over and see what my partner says,\" he agreed.  \"There's a boy scout over there,\" he told Spencer. \"He wanted to help cut a piece, so I let him. Do you mind?\"  \"Not a bit. I'd like to get a whole troop of boy scouts to help. They ought to be some good at our game.\"  \"There is a troop of them camped the other side of the mound, this boy says. Maybe we could get them to help.\"  Spencer straightened himself in his seat.  \"Bright idea, Glen. To-night you shall push Jolly Bill and the old billy-cart over there, and we'll give them a chance to do a good turn.\"  Glen went back to "]]]
