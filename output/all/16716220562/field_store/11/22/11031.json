Brayne apparently thought that he should at once be indemnified for all the money he had expended on the playhouse in excess of Burbage; and he accused Burbage of \"indirect dealing\"--there were even whispers of \"a secret key\" to the \"common box\" in which the money was kept.[71] Finally they agreed to \"submit themselves to the order and arbitrament of certain persons for the pacification thereof,\" and together they went to the shop of a notary public to sign a bond agreeing to abide by the decision of the arbitrators. There they \"fell a reasoning together,\" in the course of which Brayne asserted that he had disbursed in the Theatre \"three times at the least as much more as the sum then disbursed by the said James Burbage.\" In the end Brayne unwisely hinted at \"ill dealing\" on the part of Burbage, whereupon \"Burbage did there strike him with his fist, and so they went together by the ears, in so much,\" says the notary, \"that this deponent could hardly part them.\" After they were parted, they signed a bond of £200 to abide by the decision of the arbitrators. The arbitrators, John Hill and Richard Turnor, \"men of great honesty and credit,\" held their sessions \"in the Temple church,\" whither they summoned witnesses. Finally, on July 12, 1578, after \"having thoroughly heard\" both sides, they awarded that the profits from the Theatre should be used first to pay the debts upon the building, then to pay Brayne the money he had expended in excess of Burbage, and thereafter to be shared \"in divident equally between them.\"[72] These conditions, however, were not observed, and the failure to observe them led to much subsequent discord.  [Footnote 71: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 142, 148.]  [Footnote 72: For the history of this quarrel, and for other details of the award see Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 102, 119, 138, 142, 143, 148, 152.]  The arbitrators also decided that \"if occasion should move them [Burbage and Brayne] to borrow any sum of money for the payment of their debts owing for any necessary use and thing concerning the said Theatre, that then the said James Burbage and the said John Brayne should _join_ in pawning or mortgageing of their estate and interest of and in the same.\"[73] An occasion for borrowing money soon arose. So on September 26, 1579, the two partners mortgaged the Theatre to John Hide for the sum of £125 8_s._ 11_d._ At the end of a year, by non-payment, they forfeited the mortgage, and the legal title to the property passed to Hide. It seems, however, that because of some special clause in the mortgage Hide was unable to expel Burbage and Brayne, or to dispose of the property to others. Hence he took no steps to seize the Theatre; but he constantly annoyed the occupants by arrest and otherwise. This unfortunate transference of the title to Hide was the cause of serious quarreling between the Burbages and the Braynes, and finally led to much litigation.  [Footnote 73: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 103.]  In 1582 a more immediate disaster threatened the owners of the Theatre. One Edmund Peckham laid claim to the land on which the playhouse had been built, and brought suit against Alleyn for recovery. More than that, Peckham tried to take actual possession of the playhouse, so that Burbage \"was fain to find men at his own charge to keep the possession thereof from the said Peckham and his servants,\" and was even \"once in danger of his own life by keeping possession thereof.\" As a result of this state of affairs, Burbage \"was much disturbed and troubled in his possession of the Theatre, and could not quietly and peaceably enjoy the same. And therefore the players forsook the said Theatre, to his great loss.\"[74] In order to reimburse himself in some measure for this loss Burbage retained £30 of the rental due to Alleyn. The act led to a bitter quarrel with Alleyn, and figured conspicuously in the subsequent litigation that came near overwhelming the Theatre.  [Footnote 74: See Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 201, 239, 240, 242.]  In 1585 Burbage, having spent the stipulated £200 in repairing and rebuilding the tenements on the premises, sought to renew the lease, according to the original agreement, for the extended period of twenty-one years. On November 20, 1585, he engaged three skilled workmen to view the buildings and estimate the sum he had disbursed in improvements. They signed a formal statement to the effect that in their opinion at least £220 had been thus expended on the premises. Burbage then \"tendered unto the said Alleyn a new lease devised by his counsel, ready written and engrossed, with labels and wax thereunto affixed, agreeable to the covenant.\" But Alleyn refused to sign the document. He maintained that the new lease was not a verbatim copy of the old lease, that £200 had not been expended on the buildings, and that Burbage was a bad tenant and owed him rent. In reality, Alleyn wanted to extort a larger rental than £14 for the property, which had greatly increased in value.  On July 18, 1586, Burbage engaged six men, all expert laborers, to view the buildings again and estimate the cost of the improvements. They expressed the opinion in writing that Burbage had expended at least £240 in developing the property.[75] Still Alleyn refused to sign an extension of the lease. His conduct must have been very exasperating to the owner of the Theatre. Cuthbert Burbage tells us that his father \"did often in gentle manner solicit and require the said Gyles Alleyn for making a new lease of the said premises according to the purporte and effect of the said covenant.\" But invariably Alleyn found some excuse for delay.  [Footnote 75: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 229, 234, 228, 233.]  The death of Brayne, in August, 1586, led John Hide, who by reason of the defaulted mortgage was legally the owner of the Theatre, to redouble his efforts to collect his debt. He \"gave it out in speech that he had set over and assigned the said lease and bonds to one George Clough, his ... father-in-law (but in truth he did not so),\" and \"the said Clough, his father-in-law, did go about to put the said defendant [Burbage] out of the Theatre, or at least did threaten to put him out.\" As we have seen, there was a clause in the mortgage which prevented Hide from ejecting Burbage;[76] yet Clough was able to make so much trouble, \"divers and sundry times\" visiting the Theatre, that at last Burbage undertook to settle the debt out of the profits of the playhouse. As Robert Myles deposed in 1592, Burbage allowed the widow of Brayne for \"a certain time to take and receive the one-half of the profits of the galleries of the said Theatre ... then on a sudden he would not suffer her to receive any more of the profits there, saying that he must take and receive all till he had paid the debts. And then she was constrained, as his servant, to gather the money and to deliver it unto him.\"[77]  [Footnote 76: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 55.]  [Footnote 77: _Ibid._, p. 105.]  For some reason, however, the debt was not settled, and Hide continued his futile demands. Several times Burbage offered to pay the sum in full if the title of the Theatre were made over to his son Cuthbert Burbage; and Brayne's widow made similar offers in an endeavor to gain the entire property for herself. But Hide, who seems to have been an honest man, always declared that since Burbage and Brayne \"did jointly mortgage it unto him\" he was honor-bound to assign the property back to Burbage and the widow of Brayne jointly. So matters stood for a while.  At last, however, in 1589, Hide declared that \"since he had forborne his money so long, he could do it no more, so as they that came first should have it of him.\" Thereupon Cuthbert Burbage came bringing not only the money in hand, but also a letter from his master and patron, Walter Cape, gentleman usher to the Lord High Treasurer, requesting Hide to make over the Theatre to Cuthbert, and promising in return to assist Hide with the Lord Treasurer when occasion arose. Under this pressure, Hide accepted full payment of his mortgage, and made over the title of the property to Cuthbert Burbage. Thus Brayne's widow was legally excluded from any share in the ownership of the Theatre. Myles deposed, in 1592, that henceforth Burbage \"would not suffer her to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22406"],["title","The Little People of the Snow (#0)"],["body","from scans of public domain material produced by Microsoft for their Live Search Books site.)

[Illustration]  [Illustration]            _Uncle John._--       Listen to me, then.         'Twas in the olden time, long, long ago,         And long before the great oak at our door         Was yet an acorn, on a mountain's side         Lived, with his wife, a cottager. They dwelt         Beside a glen and near a dashing brook,         A pleasant spot in spring, where first the wren         Was heard to chatter, and, among the grass,         Flowers opened earliest; but, when winter came,         That little brook was fringed with other flowers,--         White flowers, with crystal leaf and stem, that grew         In clear November nights. And, later still,         That mountain glen was filled with drifted snows         From side to side, that one might walk across,         While, many a fathom deep, below, the brook         Sang to itself, and leaped and trotted on         Unfrozen, o'er its pebbles, toward the vale.            _Alice._--A mountain's side, you said; the Alps, perhaps,         Or our own Alleghanies.            _Uncle John._--       Not so fast,         My young geographer, for then the Alps,         With their broad pastures, haply were untrod         Of herdsman's foot, and never human voice         Had sounded in the woods that overhang         Our Alleghany's streams. I think it was         Upon the slopes of the great Caucasus,         Or where the rivulets of Ararat         Seek the Armenian vales. That mountain rose         So high, that, on its top, the winter snow         Was never melted, and the cottagers         Among the summer blossoms, far below,         Saw its white peaks in August from their door.  [Illustration]            One little maiden, in that cottage home,         Dwelt with her parents, light of heart and limb,         Bright, restless, thoughtless, flitting here and there,         Like sunshine on the uneasy ocean waves,         And sometimes she forgot what she was bid,         As Alice does.  [Illustration]            _Alice._--   Or Willy, quite as oft.            _Uncle John._--But you are older, Alice, two good years,         And should be wiser. Eva was the name         Of this young maiden, now twelve summers old.         Now you must know that, in those early times,         When autumn days grew pale, there came a troop         Of childlike forms from that cold mountain top;         With trailing garments through the air they came,         Or walked the ground with girded loins, and threw         Spangles of silvery frost upon the grass,         And edged the brook with glistening parapets,         And built it crystal bridges, touched the pool,         And turned its face to glass, or, rising thence,         They shook, from their full laps, the soft, light snow,         And buried the great earth, as autumn winds         Bury the forest floor in heaps of leaves.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]            A beautiful race were they, with baby brows,         And fair, bright locks, and voices like the sound         Of steps on the crisp snow, in which they talked         With man, as friend with friend. A merry sight         It was, when, crowding round the traveller,         They smote him with their heaviest snow-flakes, flung         Needles of frost in handfuls at his cheeks,         And, of the light wreaths of his smoking breath,         Wove a white fringe for his brown beard, and laughed         Their slender laugh to see him wink and grin         And make grim faces as he floundered on.         But, when the spring came on, what terror reigned         Among these Little People of the Snow!         To them the sun's warm beams were shafts of fire,         And the soft south wind was the wind of death.         Away they flew, all with a pretty scowl         Upon their childish faces, to the north,         Or scampered upward to the mountain's top,         And there defied their enemy, the Spring;         Skipping and dancing on the frozen peaks,         And moulding little snow-balls in their palms,         And rolling them, to crush her flowers below,         Down the steep snow-fields.  [Illustration]            _Alice._--                That, too, must have been         A merry sight to look at.            _Uncle John._--         You are right,         But I must speak of graver matters now.  [Illustration]            Mid-winter was the time, and Eva stood,         Within the cottage, all prepared to dare         The outer cold, with ample furry robe         Close belted round her waist, and boots of fur,         And a broad kerchief, which her mother's hand         Had closely drawn about her ruddy cheek.         \"Now, stay not long abroad,\" said the good dame,         \"For sharp is the outer air, and, mark me well,         Go not upon the snow beyond the spot         Where the great linden bounds the neighboring field.\"  [Illustration]            The little maiden promised, and went forth,         And climbed the rounded snow-swells firm with frost         Beneath her feet, and slid, with balancing arms,         Into the hollows. Once, as up a drift         She slowly rose, before her, in the way,         She saw a little creature lily-cheeked,         With flowing flaxen locks, and faint blue eyes,         That gleamed like ice, and robe that only seemed         Of a more shadowy whiteness than her cheek.         On a smooth bank she sat.  [Illustration]            _Alice._--              She must have been         One of your Little People of the Snow.            _Uncle John._--She was so, and, as Eva now drew near         The tiny creature bounded from her seat;         \"And come,\" she said, \"my pretty friend; to-day         We will be playmates. I have watched thee long,         And seen how well thou lov'st to walk these drifts,         And scoop their fair sides into little cells,         And carve them with quaint figures, huge-limbed men,         Lions, and griffins. We will have, to-day,         A merry ramble over these bright fields,         And thou shalt see what thou hast never seen.\"  [Illustration]            On went the pair, until they reached the bound         Where the great linden stood, set deep in snow,         Up to the lower branches. \"Here we stop,\"         Said Eva, \"for my mother has my word         That I will go no further than this tree.\"         Then the snow-maiden laughed: \"And what is this?         This fear of the pure snow, the innocent snow,         That never harmed aught living? Thou mayst roam         For leagues beyond this garden, and return         In safety; here the grim wolf never prowls,         And here the eagle of our mountain-crags         Preys not in winter. I will show the way         And bring thee safely home. Thy mother, sure,         Counselled thee thus because thou hadst no guide.\"  [Illustration]            By such smooth words was Eva won to break         Her promise, and went on with her new friend,         Over the glistening snow and down a bank         Where a white shelf, wrought by the eddying wind,         Like to a billow's crest in the great sea,         Curtained an opening. \"Look, we enter here.\"         And straight, beneath the fair o'erhanging fold,         Entered the little pair that hill of snow,         Walking along a passage with white walls,         And a white vault above where snow-stars shed         A wintry twilight. Eva moved in awe,         And held her peace, but the snow-maiden smiled,         And talked and tripped along, as, down the way,         Deeper they went into that mountainous drift.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]            And now the white walls widened, and the vault         Swelled upward, like some vast cathedral dome,         Such as the Florentine, who bore the name         Of heaven's most potent angel, reared, long since,         Or the unknown builder of that wondrous fane,         The glory of Burgos. Here a garden lay,         In which the Little People of the Snow         Were wont to take their pastime when their tasks         Upon the mountain's side and in the clouds         Were ended. Here they taught the silent frost         To mock, in stem and spray, and leaf and flower,         The growths of summer. Here the palm upreared         Its white columnar trunk and spotless sheaf         Of plume-like leaves; here cedars, huge as those         Of Lebanon, stretched far their level boughs,         Yet pale and shadowless; the sturdy oak       "]]]
