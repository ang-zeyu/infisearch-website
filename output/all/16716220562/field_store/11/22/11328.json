We're coming over to see you to-night.\"  \"I hope you will,\" the scout replied. \"My father is the scout master and I know he'll be glad to have you come. His name is Newton.\"  \"I suppose you get along with the same name?\" suggested Glen.  \"I surely do. And my other name is Corliss, but the fellows call me Apple.\"  \"Why's that. Is it your round face and red cheeks?\"  \"No. I couldn't help looking that way and the boys wouldn't throw it up to me. No, sir; they started to call me Core, then Apple-core, and so down to Apple.\"  \"It's a good name for you,\" said Glen. \"Did I tell you I'd be bringing my partner over this evening, too?\"  \"He's welcome. It's in our articles, you know. 'A scout is friendly.'\"  \"Well, don't forget to ask him to tell some stories. Then you'll be glad we came.\"  \"We'll be glad, anyway,\" said Apple, politely, as he turned away. When Glen learned to know him better he found this sunny cheer and gentle courtesy to be characteristic of him at all times and places.  It was no easy job to propel the old \"billy-cart\" over the fields, but Glen managed it. The scouts were just getting together for their evening camp-fire. They were all attracted by the queer vehicle and its jolly occupant and cheerfully and noisily responded to the introductions given by Apple Newton. Mr. Newton, the scout master, was just such a gentleman as one might expect Apple to have for a father and cordially welcomed both Spencer and Glen to their fellowship.  A hint from Apple Newton that Mr. Spencer was a teller of stories drew forth a wild clamor from the boys for his services. His first story, a funny one, brought forth delirious applause--a \"side-splitter\" they voted it. Then he told them a story of adventure which held them spell-bound. They clamored yet for more.  \"Only one,\" stipulated the scout master. \"It will soon be time to turn in.\"  \"Then I will tell you a short story about this country, but I cannot vouch for its truth. First I must tell you that I grew up a mile or two from here. There are still some Pottawatomie Indians here occasionally, I saw one yesterday. When I was a small boy there was quite a colony--a number who never had gone onto the reservation. I knew some of the old men pretty well and one of them used to tell me stories. The most remarkable story he ever told was the story of Buffalo Lake. Years ago the place now known as Buffalo Hollow was a twenty acre lake. Lakes of any size are so rare in this country that even one of twenty acres is sure to be preserved in tradition, so there is plenty of record to verify this part of his story. The remainder may be true. He insisted that it was.  \"It was late in the evening of a hot day. The freighters had been pushing along their tired horses for the last three hours, with their eyes steadfastly set on a clump of trees ahead--probably this clump in which we sit. When they reached the trees they no longer needed them for shade, for the sun had already set, but they were none the less glad of their leafy branches, glad of the green grass, glad of the cooling waters of the lake. They could scarcely restrain their tired but eager animals from plunging in as they were, and dragging their loads along, and once the harness was released the beasts made a wild dash for the water and reveled in its coolness. The men themselves lost no time in stripping off their clothing and taking the first swim of their trip. They swam and larked and sported until they were not only refreshed and rested but actually tired again. Then they ate a plentiful supper, spread their blankets around the treasure wagons and soon slept the sleep of exhaustion. Even the watch slept, for he, too, had borne the burden of the day and worn himself with the frolic of the evening. He felt no need of special caution for they were now in territory considered safe.  \"But the Indians had been following them for many days, eager for such an opportunity. They dreaded as well as hated these plainsmen. They had not dared to attack them on the open prairie. But now, one dark form after another slipped noiselessly from tree to tree, and very soon every tree sheltered a savage form and made cover for the marksmanship of an Indian brave in feathers and war-paint.  \"I don't dare to tell you the rest of this story as the old Pottawatomie told it to me, for it is near bedtime and these are the very trees between which the ghostly, ghastly figures flitted in the darkness. It is all past and gone now and you need have no fear. You boys on the outer edge who are crowding up to the light of the camp-fire are just as safe as the fellows in the middle. The thing to interest you is what the Indians did with the bullion, after they had massacred its guardians.  \"There is a government record that such a massacre actually occurred and that the bullion has never been recovered. The old Indian said that being unable to take the treasure away they rowed it out in the lake and buried it in its waters. They were chased out of the country and it was years before they dared to venture back. Then they tried to regain the treasure but without success. As a final measure they dammed up the springs and drained the lake. But the treasure was not there and so far as known it has never been found. What has become of it!\"  A moment of deep silence followed.  \"Supposing they didn't put it in the lake at all? Supposing they hid it in a cave?\"  It was Apple Newton who spoke and his speaking was the signal for a perfect babel of suggestions and guesses.  Spencer held up his hand for silence.  \"I did not come here to search for this bullion; but I feel sure that it did exist and that it may exist yet. Your scout master has invited me to stay with you for a week. I will tell you all that I know about the country, and you will help me as much as possible in getting about. We will hunt for this treasure. I try to be generous, so I will say that the scout finding it may keep it.\"  \"I have a word to add,\" said Mr. Newton. \"In this treasure hunt we must have system. Every scout desiring to enter will choose the section which he thinks most favorable, draw a map of it and present it for our approval. Afterwards he will give a full report of all his actions, how he has gone to work and what he has noted.\"  And then came a third speaker who had been expected by no one. He stepped from behind a tree, and to the eyes of the boys he was tall and erect and to some of their eyes he wore feathers and war-paint.  \"Boys hunt gold! Boys hunt heap stone!\" he said and disappeared.     CHAPTER VI  GETTING ACQUAINTED   Most of the boys around the camp fire sat as if petrified for a few moments. Some of them clutched at their scalp locks, as if to make sure of their continued existence.  The first scout to show real signs of recovery was a thin, lanky, freckled-faced hero of unheroic appearance, who spoke in a jerky fashion peculiarly his own.  \"Help!\" he cried. \"Help! Mother! Why'd my pa let me come to this wild place? Injuns! Robbers! Help!\"  \"Oh, shut up, Chick-chick,\" cried a small boy. \"You'll have 'em coming back.\"  A contemptuous laugh came from a big, handsome boy who sat in the middle of the circle--big and handsome, yet with a supercilious look.  \"Never mind, kid,\" he assured the little fellow. \"You are safe enough here. Chick-chick can't help having hysterics, but you're safe while I'm here.\"  \"Sure, you're safe,\" echoed Chick-chick. \"Ev'body's safe. Matty will protect you. Matty protects whole camp. Go after heap big Injun, Matty. Jes' disappeared northwest by south.\"  \"That's enough from you, Chick-chick,\" retorted the handsome scout, Matt Burton, who did not bear chaffing cheerfully. \"I could go after that Indian if I cared to. And get him, too.\"  \"Why should anyone want to go after him,\" interrupted Apple Newton. \"He's done nothing but suddenly appear and give some information that may be valuable.\"  \"He just came up from nowhere,\" said a scout. \"I don't believe he's a real Indian at all--just a spirit.\"  \"He was right close to me,\" declared Chick-chick. \"I smelled the spirits.\"  \"Maybe he is a phantom Indian. I've heard of such things,\" said Apple Newton, ignoring Chick-chick's absurd remark. \"I think it would be fine to have a phantom come purposely to get us started on the right track for the treasure hunt. 'Hunt heap stone' was what he said. We shall have to look for peculiar formations of stone.\"  \"Maybe we'll find one that has a letter under it telling where to dig,\" eagerly suggested one of the younger ones.  \"Likely thing,\" said another. \"How long would a letter stand the weather? There'll be marks cut in the stone if there's anything.\"  \"Much you fellows know about Indian ways,\" boasted Matt Burton. \"What did those Indians know about our language. Indians talk by signs and numbers. It will take a smart fellow to tell what it means when you find your heap stone.\"  \"Don't worry, fellows. When you find it hike back an' ask Matty. He'll tell you.\"  Matty was saved from delivering his angry response, for just then \"taps\" sounded. The scout master demanded prompt attention to all camp signals. It was understood that after taps there was to be no noise, no unnecessary conversation. All was to be quiet and orderly.  Mr. Newton would not hear of Glen pushing Jolly Bill back to the farm house.  \"We have an empty tent with two cots and bedding too--left here by members who were called home. You turn right in with us. We are glad to have you--both of you. I think we'll make Glen a scout.\"  This invitation suited both of them splendidly. Spencer was pleased, and, as for Glen, he had never experienced anything so gratifying in his life. He was so excited that he could not sleep for some time, but lay on his comfortable cot thinking of the many happenings of the last few eventful days, and especially of the exciting story of the camp fire, and the dramatic appearance"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22644"],["title","The Boy Scout Treasure Hunters; Or, The Lost Treasure of Buffalo Hollow (#7)"],["body"," the Indian. He was glad that he was here to help his good friend, Jolly Bill, but he felt that it would be much more glorious to help him by finding bars of bright, glistening bullion, than by looking for a lost lake.  Glen was still dreaming of Indians when the bugle call aroused him, and he awakened to the glorious activities of a summer morning in a scout camp. Two scouts were in the tent almost before he had hopped out of his blankets and into his clothes.  \"We came to help our friend, Mr. Spencer,\" explained Apple Newton.  \"Want to wind up his machine an' put on some funny story records,\" added Chick-chick.  \"I can't tell funny stories before breakfast,\" objected Jolly Bill. \"I'm hungry enough to eat Indian.\"  \"We have eggs for breakfast--fresh laid. We got 'em from the farmer yesterday.\"  \"You're sure they're fresh?\" asked Spencer. \"I'm very particular about my eggs since I camped out a few years ago. One of our fellows wasn't much good about cooking, but he said he'd get the eggs. He came back pretty soon with a whole dozen. 'You're sure these are fresh?' I asked him. 'Dead positive' said he. So I started to break one into my pan, and about all there was that was still egg was the shell. 'What made you so positive these eggs were fresh?' I asked that chap after I let him come to a little. 'I could have sworn to it,' he said. 'I lifted the hen right off the nest myself and the eggs were warm yet.'\"  \"Our eggs aren't laid by the dozen,\" said Apple, \"and we know they're fresh because the farmer said so. Come on now, if you're ready. The scout master says we're to push your automobile right up to the end of the table, next to him.\"  It was a jolly crowd at the table, and no less jolly was the squad acting that morning as waiters. The scout master believed it good discipline to teach every scout how to do the humblest duty as well as how to do the greatest, so each scout took his turn at waiting on table. Patrol leader Matt Burton was in charge of the waiter squad this morning. He was the one exception who showed that it did not agree well with every scout to do these menial tasks. He considered them beneath his dignity and never would have condescended to them had there been a way of escape. Since there was not, he had made the best of a bad job, and as he was very bright and a natural leader he had managed to reach the rank of Patrol Leader in spite of his disinclination to certain matters of work.  \"Bob said he had a special order for Mr. Spencer, Matt,\" said Apple, stepping to his side after he had wheeled the cart up to the table. \"Tell him Mr. Spencer wants his eggs sure fresh and likes 'em soft.\"  \"You can just carry Mr. Spencer's order to Black Bob yourself,\" said Matt disgustedly. \"I'm no waiter.\"  \"You won't be if the scout master hears you,\" said Apple, his good nature exhausted. \"You'll be a traveler.\"  \"He surely will,\" observed Chick-chick. \"I'll take care of Mr. Spencer, Apple. Leave him to me.\"  \"It's more in your line,\" insinuated Matt. \"I guess it's about the same thing as waiting on your father's customers at his garage.\"  \"An' it's proud I am to do it,\" retorted Chick-chick. \"I do it whenever they want anything I can handle, from gasoline to a new machine. Lem'me sell you a new car, Matty. Lem'me sell you one that'll make your blue blood bubble all over itself. Tell ye 'bout it jest as soon as I get those eggs.\"  \"We've just bought a new car,\" said Matt. \"And I'd walk before I'd let my folks buy one of you, anyway.\"  \"I don't believe that fellow likes you,\" observed Glen, as he went up to the cook shack with Chick-chick.  \"He surely don't disgrace himself by too much show of affection,\" agreed Chick-chick. \"You musn't think it's because it's me, though. There's on'y one person Matty really loves. He's real smart, Matty is. You noticed he spoke so the men couldn't hear him.\"  Black Bob had Mr. Spencer's eggs all ready.  \"These is for the ge'mman as told the stories last night,\" he announced. \"He sure is quality, if they ain't much to him.\"  \"Give 'em to me, Bob,\" said Chick-chick. \"I'm going to wait on Mr. Spencer.\"  \"You go away, you Henry Chicken,\" objected Black Bob. \"I know all 'bout yore tricks. Bear Patrol is waitin' table dis yere mohnin' an' you ain't no Bear Patrol.\"  \"Well, here's Goosey,\" exclaimed Chick-chick, grabbing the shoulder of a small scout who had just appeared. \"Goosey is in Bear Patrol, and he's a friend of mine, ain't you, Goosey?\"  \"I surely am,\" declared the small scout. \"Anything I can do for Chick-chick I do.\"  \"Hustle these eggs down to Mr. Spencer, Goosey, an' make it your business to wait on him. Bob won't give me a thing.\"  \"Not when you ain't on duty. Oh, I know you, Mr. Henry-chick,\" Bob affirmed.  \"Bob doesn't seem to trust you,\" said Glen. \"Aren't you friendly?\"  \"Just best friends ever. Bob hasn't better friend 'n me in camp. I like Bob 'n I love his cakes an' pies. 'Tain't my fault if he doesn't always seem to reciprocate, is it, Bob?\"  \"What dat 'bout recipe fo cake? Nev' you min', Mister Henry-chick. I knows you, I do.\"  Bob shook a fist as he spoke, but the chuckle in his voice and the laugh in his eye were more apparent than the threat in his fist.  \"Well, let's go back an' get ours while they're hot,\" said Chick-chick. \"Goosey'll wait on Mr. Spencer. Good boy, Goosey. Goin' do something good for Goosey some day.\"  He led Glen back to the long table of smooth boards laid on trestles which stood on the grassy level. The scouts were helping themselves from great bowls filled with eggs cooked in the shell, or from large platters on which eggs fried or poached were served, according to their preference. Bob was a good cook and gave them their choice. Glen, with an appetite that cared little for the fine points of preference, chose impartially from every dish that reached him. An occasional glance showed that the small scout known as Goosey was giving good attention to Jolly Bill, and not only he but Apple Newton and other scouts were endeavoring eagerly to anticipate his wants.  Glen was mentally putting the fellows in their proper places on the shelves of his esteem. Apple Newton and the boy called Chick-chick he warmed to most particularly, and they were given prominent places. He liked young Goosey, as well as several other of the younger boys whose names he had not learned. There was a big fellow called Tom Scoresby that he believed that he would get along with pretty well. Just one scout he found no room for anywhere. That was Matt Burton. He hated him, he was quite sure. His unruly young heart only had one desire for Matt. He wanted just one good chance to measure strength with him and plant his hard, clenched fist right where that smile of insolence curled the handsome lips.  Quite engrossed in his thoughts Glen did not notice that the boys around him had risen from the long bench on which they sat. Suddenly he heard Matt Burton's voice behind him.  \"Get up,\" he said. \"Can't you see that we want these places for the waiters.\"  Glen slowly and deliberately turned around in his seat and looked at his questioner.  \"Who are you?\" he asked, and his voice was so aggressive that every scout in hearing distance turned to see what was up.  \"You'll find out who I am,\" replied Matt angrily. \"Get up when I tell you.\"  \"I don't have to get up when you tell me, nor lie down when you tell me, nor do anything when you tell me. Did you get that? What now?\"  Matt was getting very angry but he did not entirely forget his position.  \"If I call my patrol you'll get up mighty quick,\" he said. \"I'd like to know who let you come here, anyway.\"  \"Never mind about your patrol and don't fuss about who let me come here. You come and make me get up, all by yourself.\"  Matt looked at the brown skin and the strong tough features of the obstinate boy a long minute, as if making up his mind.  \"Oh, well,\" he said, \"I suppose if you're a guest you must do as you please.\"  \"Since you're so nice about it,\" said Glen, \"the seat's yours. Do what you want with it.\"  Glen knew in his heart that there would be a clash with Matt Burton if he stayed long in that camp. He felt also that he had not come out of this first brush with entire distinction. Matt had been in the wrong and had shown that he was angry, yet he had a certain discipline which had enabled him to control his temper, and the issue had ended in defeat for the undisciplined waif who might well have been victorious had they come to blows.     CHAPTER VII  GLEN IS INITIATED   Strange to say, with the passing of the morning, Glen found himself unhappy, though he should have been abundantly content. Strange, for with all these boys to help, his tasks would be greatly lightened, and to join in the fun of this crowd should be joy beyond compare. But Glen did not want fun just now. There was something much more precious to him, which he felt in danger of losing, and although he himself could not have explained its substance, it was none the less real. It was the trust and dependence of Will Spencer. For the first time in his life Glen had been really trusted and really needed by some one. He had taken up the burden like a man and rejoiced in it. Now he felt that his opportunities would be dissipated among the crowd.  \"What's the matter, Glen?\" asked Spencer. \"Why are you moping around with a face like the reverse side of a frying-pan? You ought to be right out with the bunch, egging 'em on.\"  \"Oh, I guess no one has any use for me,\" said Glen disconsolately. \"I guess I might as well go back to the school.\"  \"To the school! And leave me in the lurch?\"  \"You don't need me any more. You don't tell me anything.\"  \"What haven't I told you, boy?\"  \"Well, you were telling Apple all about that Indian who came last night, but you didn't tell me.\"  \"Oh, nonsense, boy. You are peeved too easily. That Indian was just old Joe Marrowfat, who had followed me up from the farm. Apple is romantic and he wanted a string of stuff about the noble"]]]
