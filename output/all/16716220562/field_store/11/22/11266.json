Conjunctions may be omitted.* The omission gives a certain forcible abruptness, _e.g._ \"You say this: I (on the other hand) deny it.\"  When sentences are short, as in Macaulay's writings, conjunctions may be advantageously omitted.  Where a contrast is intended, the conjunction _but_ usually prepares the way for the second of the two contrasted terms: \"He is good _but_ dull.\" Where _and_ is used instead of _but_, the incongruity savours of epigram: \"He always talks truthfully _and_ prosily.\" \"He is always amusing _and_ false.\"  *51 a. The Imperative Mood may be used for \"if.\"*  \"_Strip_ (for, _if you strip_) Virtue of the awful authority she derives from the general reverence of mankind, and you rob her of half her majesty.\"   *52. Apposition may be used so as to convert two sentences into one.*  \"We called at the house of a person to whom we had letters of introduction, _a musician_, and, what is more, a _good friend_ to all young students of music.\" This is as clear as, and briefer than, \"He was a musician, &c.\"   *53. Condensation may be effected by not repeating (1) the common subject of several verbs, (2) the common object of several verbs or prepositions.*  (1) \"He resided here for many years, and, after he had won the esteem of all the citizens, (_he_) died,\" &c. So, (2) \"He came to, and was induced to reside in, this city,\" is shorter than \"He came to this city, and was induced to reside in it.\"  Such condensation often causes obscurity, and, even where there is no obscurity, there is a certain harshness in pausing on light, unemphatic words, such as _to_, _in_, &c., as in the first example.   *54. Tautology.*--The fault of repeating the same word several times unnecessarily is called _tautology_, e.g.:  \"This is a painful _circumstance_; it is a _circumstance_ that I much _regret_, and he also will much _regret_ the _circumstance_.\" But the fault is not to be avoided by using different words to mean the same thing, as, \"This is a painful _event_; it is a _circumstance_ that I _much regret_, and he also will _greatly lament_ the _occurrence_.\" The true remedy is to arrange the words in such a manner that there may be no unnecessary repetition, thus: \"This is a painful circumstance, a circumstance that causes me, and will cause him, deep regret.\"  The repetition of the same meaning in slightly different words is a worse fault than the repetition of the same word. See, for examples, the extract from Sir Archibald Alison, at the end of the book. Thus \"_A burning thirst_ for conquests is a characteristic of this nation. It is an _ardent passion_ that &c.\" Other instances are--\"The _universal_ opinion of _all_ men;\" \"His judgment is so _infallible_ that it is _never deceived_,\" &c.   *55. Parenthesis may be used with advantage to brevity.*  \"We are all (and who would not be?) offended at the treatment we have received,\" is shorter and more forcible than the sentence would have been if the parenthesis had been appended in a separate sentence: \"Who, indeed, would not be offended?\"  Extreme care must, however, be taken that a parenthesis may not obscure the meaning of a long sentence.  *56. Caution: let clearness be the first consideration.* It is best, at all events for beginners, not to aim so much at being brief, or forcible, as at being perfectly clear. Horace says, \"While I take pains to be brief, I fall into obscurity,\" and it may easily be seen that several of the rules for brevity interfere with the rules for clearness.  Forcible style springs from (1) vividness and (2) exactness of thought, and from a corresponding (1) vividness and (2) exactness in the use of words.  (1) When you are describing anything, endeavour to _see_ it and describe it as you see it. If you are writing about a man who was killed, _see_ the man before you, and ask, was he _executed_, _cut down_, _run through the body_, _butchered_, _shot_, or _hanged_? If you are writing about the capture of a city, was the city _stormed_, _surprised_, _surrendered_, _starved out_, or _demolished before surrender_? Was an army _repelled_, _defeated_, _routed_, _crushed_, or _annihilated_?  (2) Exactness in the use of words requires an exact knowledge of their meanings and differences. This is a study by itself, and cannot be discussed here.[17]   FOOTNOTES:  [17] See _English Lessons for English People_, pp. 1-53.

A Paper Read at the Cincinnati Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in August, 1881, under the Title of \"A Lawgiver of the Stone Age.\"        Salem, Mass.: Printed at the Salem Press. 1881.     A LAWGIVER OF THE STONE AGE.  By HORATIO HALE, of Clinton, Ontario, Canada.   What was the intellectual capacity of man when he made his first appearance upon the earth?  Or, to speak with more scientific precision (as the question relates to material evidences), what were the mental powers of the people who fashioned the earliest stone implements, which are admitted to be the oldest remaining traces of our kind?  As these people were low in the arts of life, were they also low in natural capacity?  This is certainly one of the most important questions which the science of anthropology has yet to answer.  Of late years the prevalent disposition has apparently been to answer it in the affirmative.  Primitive man, we are to believe, had a feeble and narrow intellect, which in the progress of civilization has been gradually strengthened and enlarged.  This conclusion is supposed to be in accordance with the development theory; and the distinguished author of that theory has seemed to favor this view.  Yet, in fact, the development theory has nothing to do with the question.  If we suppose that the existing and--so far as we know--the only species of man appeared upon the earth with the physical conformation and mental capacity which he retains at this day, we make merely the same supposition with regard to him that we make with regard to every other existing species of animal. How it was that this species came to exist is another question altogether.  Philologists regard it as an established fact that the first people who spoke an Aryan language were a tribe of barbarous nomads, who wandered in the highlands of central Asia.  Those who have studied the earliest products of Aryan genius in the Vedas, the Zend-Avesta, and the Homeric songs, will be willing to admit that these wandering barbarians may have had minds capable of the highest efforts to which the human intellect is known to have attained.  Yet if an irruption of Semitic or Turanian conquerors had swept that infant tribe from the earth, no trace of its existence beyond a few flint implements, and perhaps some fragments of pottery, would have remained to show that such a people had ever existed. Have we any reason to doubt that in the course of all the ages, in various parts of our globe, many tribes of men may have arisen and perished who were in natural capacity as far superior to the primitive Aryans as these were to the races who surrounded them?  Under the law of the survival of the fittest, it is not the strongest that survive, but the strongest of those that are placed in the most favorable circumstances.  On any calculation of probabilities, it will seem likely enough that among the numberless small societies of men that have appeared and vanished in primeval Asia and Europe, in Africa, Australia, America, and Polynesia, there may have been some at least equal, if not superior, in mental endowments, to that fortunate tribe of central Asia, whose posterity has come to be the dominant race of our time.  Among their leaders may have been men qualified to rank with the most renowned heroes, exemplars, and teachers of the human race--with Moses and Buddha, with Confucius and Solon, with Numa, Charlemagne, and Alfred, or (to come down to recent times) with the greatest and wisest among the founders of the American Republic.  If the possibility of the existence of such men under such conditions cannot be denied, the facts which have lately been brought to light in regard to one such personage and the community in which he lived may have a peculiar interest and significance in their bearing on the general question of the mental capacity of uncivilized races.  It is well known that the Iroquois tribes, whom our ancestors termed the Five Nations, were, when first visited by Europeans, in the precise condition which, according to all the evidence we possess, was held by the inhabitants of the Old World during what has been designated the Stone Age.  Any one who examines the abandoned site of an ancient Iroquois town will find there relics of precisely the same cast as those which are disinterred from the burial mounds and caves of prehistoric Europe,--implements of flint and bone, ornaments of shells, and fragments of rude pottery.  Trusting to these evidences alone, he might suppose that the people who wrought them were of the humblest grade of intellect. But the testimony of historians, of travellers, of missionaries, and perhaps his own personal observation, would make him aware that this opinion would be erroneous, and that these Indians were, in their own way, acute reasoners, eloquent speakers, and most skilful and far-seeing politicians.  He would know that for more than a century, though never mustering more than five thousand fighting men, they were able to hold the balance of power on this continent between France and England; and that in a long series of negotiations they proved themselves qualified to cope in council with the best diplomatists whom either of those powers could depute to deal with them.  It is only recently that we have learned, through the researches of a careful and philosophic investigator, the Hon. L. H. Morgan, that their internal polity was marked by equal wisdom, and had been developed and consolidated into a system of government, embodying many of what are deemed the best principles and methods of political science,--representation, federation, self-government through local and general legislatures,--all resulting in personal liberty, combined with strict subordination to public law.  But it has not been distinctly known that for many of these advantages the Five Nations were indebted to one individual, who bore to them the same relation which the great reformers and lawgivers of antiquity bore to the communities whose gratitude has made their names illustrious.  A singular fortune has attended the name and memory of Hiawatha.  Though actually an historical personage, and not of very ancient date, of whose life and deeds many memorials remain, he has been confused with two Indian divinities, the one Iroquois, the other Algonquin, and his history has been distorted and obscured almost beyond recognition.  Through the cloud of mythology which has enveloped his memory, the genius of Longfellow has discerned something of his real character, and has made his name, at least, a household word wherever the English language is spoken.  It remains to give a correct account of the man himself and of the work which he accomplished, as it has been received from the official annalists of his people.  The narrative is confirmed by the evidence of contemporary wampum records, and by written memorials in the native tongue, one of which is at least a hundred years old.  According to the best evidence that can be obtained, the formation of the Iroquois confederacy dates from about the middle of the fifteenth century.  There is reason to believe that prior to that time the five tribes, who are dignified with the title of nations, had held the region south of Lake Ontario, extending from the Hudson to the Genesee river, for many generations, and probably for many centuries.  Tradition makes their earlier seat to have been north of the St. Lawrence river, which is probable enough.  It also represents the Mohawks as the original tribe, of which the others are offshoots; and this tradition is confirmed by the evidence of language.  That the Iroquois tribes were originally one people, and that their separation into five communities, speaking distinct dialects, dates many centuries back, are both conclusions as certain as any facts in physical science.  Three hundred and fifty years ago they were isolated tribes, at war occasionally with one another, and almost constantly with the fierce Algonquins who surrounded them.  Not unfrequently, also, they had to withstand and to avenge the incursions of warriors belonging to more distant tribes of various stocks, Hurons, Cherokees and Dakotas.  Yet they were not peculiarly a warlike people. They were a race of housebuilders, farmers, and fishermen.  They had large and strongly palisaded towns, well-cultivated fields, and substantial houses, sometimes a hundred feet long, in which many kindred families dwelt together.  At this time two great dangers, the one from without, the other from within, pressed upon these tribes.  The Mohegans, or Mohicans, a powerful Algonquin people, whose settlements stretched along the Hudson river, south of the Mohawks, and extended thence eastward into New England, waged a desperate war against them.  In this war the most easterly of the Iroquois, the Mohawks and Oneidas, bore the brunt and were the greatest sufferers.  On the other hand, the two westerly nations, the Senecas and Cayugas, had a peril of their own to encounter.  The central nation, the Onondagas, were then under the control of a dreaded chief, whose name is variously given, Atotarho, Watatotahlo, Tododaho, according to the dialect of the speaker and the orthography of the writer.  He was a man of great force of character and of formidable qualities,--haughty, ambitious, crafty and bold,--a determined and successful warrior, and at home, so far as the constitution of an Indian tribe would allow, a stern and remorseless tyrant.  He tolerated no equal.  The chiefs who ventured to oppose him were taken off one after another by secret means, or"]]]
