I DEDICATE THIS STORY OF CANADA  BY PERMISSION  TO  HER EXCELLENCY THE COUNTESS OF ABERDEEN     WHO HAS WON THE ESTEEM AND AFFECTION OF ALL CLASSES   OF THE CANADIAN PEOPLE BY THE EARNESTNESS WITH   WHICH SHE HAS IDENTIFIED HERSELF WITH   EVERY MOVEMENT AFFECTING THE SOCIAL   AND INTELLECTUAL PROGRESS OF   THE NEW DOMINION     {v}  PREFATORY NOTE  In writing this story of Canada I have not been able to do more, within the limited space at my command, than briefly review those events which have exercised the most influence on the national development of the Dominion of Canada from the memorable days bold French adventurers made their first attempts at settlement on the banks of the beautiful basin of the Annapolis, and on the picturesque heights of Quebec, down to the establishment of a Confederation which extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.  Whilst the narrative of the French régime, with its many dramatic episodes, necessarily occupies a large part of this story, I have not allowed myself to forget the importance that must be attached to the development of institutions of government and their effect on the social, intellectual, and material conditions of the people since the beginning of the English régime.  Though this story, strictly speaking, ends with the successful accomplishment of the federal union of all the provinces in 1873, when Prince Edward Island became one of its members, I have deemed it necessary to refer briefly to those events which have {vi} happened since that time--the second half-breed rebellion of 1885, for instance--and have had much effect on the national spirit of the people.  I endeavour to interest my reader in the public acts of those eminent men whose names stand out most prominently on the pages of history, and have made the deepest impress on the fortunes and institutions of the Dominion.  In the performance of this task I have always consulted original authorities, but have not attempted to go into any historical details except those which are absolutely necessary to the intelligent understanding of the great events and men of Canadian annals.  I have not entered into the intrigues and conflicts which have been so bitter and frequent during the operation of parliamentary government in a country where politicians are so numerous, and statesmanship is so often hampered and government injuriously affected by the selfish interests of party, but have simply given the conspicuous and dominant results of political action since the concession of representative institutions to the provinces of British North America.  A chapter is devoted, at the close of the historical narrative, to a very brief review of the intellectual and material development of the country, and of the nature of its institutions of government.  A survey is also given of the customs and conditions of the French Canadian people, so that the reader outside of the Dominion may have some conception of their institutions and of their influence on the political, social, and intellectual life of a Dominion, of whose population they form so important and influential an element.  {vii} The illustrations are numerous, and have been carefully selected from various sources, not accessible to the majority of students, with the object, not simply of pleasing the general reader, but rather of elucidating the historical narrative.  A bibliographical note has also been added of those authorities which the author has consulted in writing this story, and to which the reader, who wishes to pursue the subject further, may most advantageously refer.  HOUSE OF COMMONS, OTTAWA,   _Dominion Day, 1896_.     PUBLISHER'S NOTE.  Owing to the passing of Sir John Bourinot, the revisions necessary to bring this work up to date had to be entrusted to another hand. Accordingly, Mr. William H. Ingram has kindly undertaken the task, and has contributed the very judiciously selected information now embodied in Chapter XXX. on the recent development of Canada.  Chapter XXVIII. by Mr. Edward Porritt, author of _Sixty Years of Protection in Canada_, has also been included, as being indicative of the history of the time he describes.  Mr. Ingram has also made other revisions of considerable value.  1, ADELPHI TERRACE.   _March, 1922_.     {ix}  CONTENTS                                                             PAGE  BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  xix   I.

It was demolished in 1694 by Governor Frontenac, who rebuilt it on the original foundations, and it was this castle which, in a remodelled and enlarged form, under the English régime, lasted until 1834.   {xiv}  PORTRAIT OF JACQUES CARTIER  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   31     _From B.
