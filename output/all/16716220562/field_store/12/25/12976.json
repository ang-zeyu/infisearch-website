No ship or porpoises to be seen of all day.   MONDAY, MAY 12TH.  Passed a good night. About five we seemed quite becalmed, but were glad to find this not the case, the breeze had continued moderately through the night. Sensibly warmer and consequently most of the steerage passengers appeared on deck. Much pleased with a number of porpoises swimming alongside of us for a mile or two. A good deal of talk with Captain Kenney about the English nobility, etc., and also with Captain Sketchley, who said he had been more than 40 years at sea, chiefly between Liverpool and New York. His family resides in Liverpool on account of Mrs. S. who could not bear the extremes of the American climate. Find fresh faces on board, most of them have part of their family already gone to America.   TUESDAY, MAY 13TH.  Passed a pretty good night though the ship rolled a good deal at times; and I found the sea a good deal agitated. The wind continued to blow hard all day, the vessel rising and falling 10 or 12 yards. Sometimes one side nearly down at the water's edge, and rising up out of boiling foam. Early in the evening the dead-lights[5], those at the stern, were made up lest a sea should rush through; the same with the skylights. The Captain said the gale was very unusual at this season of the year; talked of the vessel being more uneasy than she used to be. Captain Kenney now appeared on deck. During dinner two ducks and sauce were suddenly swept across the table and most of it thrown upon Mr. Cayley. Towards evening the sky became darker and the storm likely to increase during the night; this we found the case and about ten we rolled tremendously; we all seemed depressed; no cards, not much reading; a few conundrums, etc.   WEDNESDAY, MAY 14TH.  Had a restless night not sleeping till four, when more sail was hoisted that steadied the vessel and I rested comfortably till half past seven. Nobody but I and Mr. Grindrod seemed to have been inconvenienced. A delightful change, the wind more favourable and the sea lower, the sun shining. A game called Shuffleboard was introduced with trenchers about 1-1/2 inch thick and 10 in. diameter, counting thus, and the trenchers could be slided within the lines;--claret--2 bottles of champagne being the wagers or results of the game. About twelve I went to lie down, having had so little sleep. Whilst down a ship passed to the west of us. Played two games at Chess with the Captain who beat me though I had quite the game and could have taken his Queen. As heretofore, if successful I became careless, and if the contrary too much depressed. Stopt up with the card party till after eleven. No gulls to be seen.   +-+-+-+  |1|8|6|  +-+-+-+  |5|3|7|  +-+-+-+  |9|4|2|  +-+-+-+   THURSDAY, MAY 15TH.  Had a pleasant night, found little wind and that not favourable; in fact they tell me we are not nearing N.Y. Finished Watson's \"Memoirs\" 667 octavo pages; a good reply to those who have attempted a defence of slavery from O. and N. Testament. Spent the day very delightfully, being so warm that we preferred the shade. The wind but light and not fair. Tried fishing but not successful.  An old seaman who has been with the _Britannia_ over three years says he never knew a passage from England to America made in less than 30 days.  Played another game at chess with Mr. Seaton, had the worst of it, but called away to dinner. Another play was putting the feet in a swing rope and trying how far they could go, being then chalked on the deck.  After tea went on deck, a beautiful starlight night, a good deal of singing. Jackson had ascended the rigging, was followed by one of the seamen who tied his legs. The usual penalty followed--a bottle of rum; he gave them two and the evening passed merrily.   FRIDAY, MAY 16TH.  Passed a very good night, the sea placid, but little wind and that adverse. The wind rising but in no better direction. Played another game with Mr. Seaton, he giving me a Knight, still unsuccessful. Had a slight headache, the atmosphere feeling very damp. Saw one of Mother Carey's chickens or petrel of the ocean; it resembles a swallow and followed us some distance picking up some crumbs of bread thrown to it by the Captain.  The Mate says 28 days the shortest passage he ever made to America. At dinner a warm discussion on the Duke of Newcastle doing \"what he liked with his own\"; also the advantage of colonies, also the large military and naval expenses. After dinner we fell in with a ship from Vera Cruz to Bordeaux. The wind fair for the first time since we sailed. This evening played another game with the Captain and lost. Went on deck and heard two songs.   SATURDAY, MAY 17TH.  Had a good night. Dreamed that I had returned from Liverpool and could not get back in time for sailing; also that I had had three suits of clothes sent in. Was sorry to learn that the wind had died away and that we had only made about 1-1/2 knots per hour. Two vessels seen at a great distance; about two they came within a mile of us; others were also observed. Went down and wrote a few lines; the vessel did not come near enough for us to speak to them. Another ship passed in the afternoon but more distant. At dinner Mr. Seaton said he had known Madeira wine sell for more than eleven dollars a bushel. Very good pancakes indeed. In the evening Mr. Seaton, talking of horses said he himself had two horses which he drove eleven miles an hour for four successive hours; also spoke of the great mercantile house of Parish & Co., Hamburgh and New York. One of the steerage passengers informs me that there are 102 in the fore steerage and 39 in the middle steerage.   SUNDAY, MAY 18TH.  Had a pleasant night and rose before seven, and took out my better clothes to remind me more effectually of Sunday. Found the wind had continued moderately favourable. A long discussion at breakfast respecting smoking. Mr. Bassnett said he had smoked thirty cigars for thirty days together, and did not consider it hurtful when taken properly into the lungs. I considered it hurtful, and particularly as generally it was accompanied by drinking. A ship passed us this morning. At half past ten the bell tolled for a religious service and seats were brought on deck. Mr. Hamilton read the Church of England service, and Mr. Grindrod preached a good practical sermon. In the evening the Captain proposed to have an evening service, which was readily acceded to by Mr. Grindrod. Mr. H. read the evening service and Mr. G. preached the sermon. In the morning service the prayer for the royal family had given offence to some of the crew, and therefore on the recommendation of the Captain, the prayer was altered into all chief magistrates and governors.   MONDAY, MAY 19TH.  Dreamed a good deal and particularly about my late dear father, who is now still more in my remembrance, and I have frequently to check the expectation of seeing him on my return. A truly delightful morning with an improved breeze. Passed what is called a black fish[6]. Played a game with Mr. Bassnett and beat him. A most delightful and favourable breeze continued. Immediately after dinner I observed a current of yellow water about the breadth of the ship's length, and about 1/2 or 3/4 mile on each side, and after passing over it I went to tell the Captain who was just then looking over the side; he made haste to the stern along with others and he expressed very great surprise, almost seemed desirous to turn the vessel about to look more closely. He had never seen the like before, and should have been alarmed had he seen it at the head; could only explain it by supposing that an iceberg with a quantity of mud had melted in that neighbourhood[7]. Had fiddle and dancing particularly well done by the steward, cook, and some of the sailors. Played another game at chess with Mr. B. and beat him. Although we have had a good fair breeze all day we have not seen a single ship.   TUESDAY, MAY 20TH.  Had a good wind all night which continued till near ten, when a heavy shower of rain came on and the wind became unfavourable. A ship seen at a distance; passed two others early this morning. The wind continued unfavourable all day, also colder so that we all appeared depressed. Played two games with Mr. Bassnett and lost, then went on deck about ten and found the wind abated, but quite ahead. The Captain said he was quite sick of it. The curious phenomenon yesterday of the coloured water, is explained by some of the seamen supposing it to be the spawn of a whale.  Much breakage of glasses at dinner; my decanter tossed off the table and broken; also a tumbler and champagne glass. One gull seen yesterday and two stormy petrels follow us a long way. A very dull day with all of us, partly occasioned by the unfavourable wind and coldness. Had some affecting conversation with Mr. G. respecting my late dear father. A fine evening, the wind changed and almost became a calm. The ship gradually turned round to get on another tack.   WEDNESDAY, MAY 21ST.  Rested pretty well, but found we had made little way. A good deal of conversation at breakfast respecting various kinds of fruit. America it seems is well supplied with tropical fruit. Finished Lander's \"Travels in Africa\"; also read before Fergusson's \"Canadian Tour.\" The breeze refreshing though not altogether favourable, much better than a calm. Mr. Bassnett proposed as a wager, that he would throw doublets ones to sixes in succession in ten minutes, which he accomplished in seven; he also surprised us by taking up the dice by means only of the boxes. The wind continued favourable all day. Played another game with Mr. B. and lost it. Did not see a ship or fish throughout the day. Have great difficulty in preventing myself from thinking of meeting my late dear father on my return.   THURSDAY, MAY 22ND."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24626"],["title","A Journey to America in 1834 (#3)"],["body","not sleep so well though tolerably comfortable. Found the wind slight but for the first time quite fair in a due east, all the sails squared and also the stunsail out. Saw a fish. The wind about one, changed more south. A long sit and chat upon the helm house with Mr. Grindrod. A very good breeze all day. Remarkable that we saw not a vessel all day excepting before breakfast and at a great distance. Frequently do I find some trouble in checking the expectation of meeting again my dear father.   FRIDAY, MAY 23RD.  Got up before six having not been able to sleep since 2 o'clock, such noises, pitching and rockings as surely never were heard before. Found the sea greatly agitated and much foam. I asked one of the seamen if he did not call this a stiff gale; he said it was a fresh breeze. The Captain admitted that it blew hard; he was up all night. Cold all day and the wind quite contrary. Six or seven stormy petrels seen at once, and now and then a gull. Towards evening we discerned a brig which we found was sailing before us; she had little sail, and appeared to wish to speak to us, but did not come sufficiently near. It has been one of the disagreeable days, very cold with adverse wind and all our spirits depressed; several of our passengers are out of health. Mr. Webster complained of a boil on his ear; also Mr. Jackson of earache; Captain Kenney has a bad cold, and Mr. Bassnett a bad digestion. In the morning the Captain persuaded me to go to rest again and I lay down after dinner.   SATURDAY, MAY 24TH.  I passed a much better night and got up at half past six; was gratified to learn from the Mate who is not usually encouraging, that we had been making way in the night; pointed out a vessel passing us on the east. The Captain is making his 132nd passage across the Atlantic, say 62 voyages; been at sea 45 years, 35 in the American trade. A very, very cold, though sunny day. A score of petrels flying about. A day of business amongst the steerage passengers exchanging provisions. Much warmer on deck after dinner. Had some conversation in French with one of the sailors who is a Frenchman from Bordeaux. Been upon deck and greatly pleased with the numerous petrels chirping on all sides of the ship. Find the seamen are only engaged at New York to Liverpool and back, their wages paid during that time; this is the same even with the cook. The Captain every Saturday night sends a glass of whiskey to all the cabin passengers.   SUNDAY, MAY 25TH.  Passed the night very comfortably till six, when a sudden squall arose that tossed and rolled us about exceedingly. On going upon deck the sea was much agitated, it rained so heavily that I was obliged to descend. These sudden changes are not unusual in what is called the Gulf Stream; but I feel truly thankful that the storm did not come on earlier; it continued to blow hard all day. Seated at the stern watching the petrels and feeding them with bits of fat mutton. A ship seen this morning and another in the evening. A fine rolling sea and warm enough to sit out and enjoy it. The Church of England Service read in the cabin and a prayer made by Mr. Grindrod.   MONDAY, MAY 26TH.  Passed a comfortable night till five, when the vessel began to roll about. Got up before seven, found a dead calm which was the cause of the motion, which continued all forenoon.  Amused myself with reading Mr. Bassnett's voyage to Syria; and also at looking at some amusing caricatures of Cruickshank's. The wind fair but very little of it, yesterday a gale but in a wrong direction; in fact we have only had once a really fair wind and that for a short time. A great many gulls to be seen, most of them with pointed tails, and few petrels. Had we gone over the banks we might have had some diversion in fishing, but the Captain was afraid of encountering the ice.  In the Gulf there is not only a stream against us but generally very foggy weather and changeable, either calms or storms. This has been a very unpleasant day, a calm with dull hazy weather, no fish or ships, or even Mother Carey's chickens, but only a few gulls. A good deal of champagne taken to-day by Jackson, very foolish.   TUESDAY, MAY 27TH.  Passed a pretty good night though occasionally the ship rolled and pitched more than I expected. When I went upon deck I was agreeably surprised; a very good wind from the north bearing us on very well.  The scene diversified by a grampus[8] 8 to 10 feet long, and a flying fish which is rather larger than a swallow. About ten spoke to a vessel from Jamaica to London. Finished reading Bassnett's manuscript tour, Syria, Egypt, etc. Much depressed by the recollection of my dear father's departure; told Mr. Grindrod the cause, which led to some serious and at the same time consolatory remarks. At dinner Mr. Jackson enquired what was the matter, upon which Mr. G. very kindly explained the cause. Commenced reading B. H.'s[9] Notes on Chili, Peru, etc., he is a very pleasing and agreeable writer. The measles broke out about this time.   WEDNESDAY, MAY 28TH.  Passed a quiet night, found it raining which we fear may lead to a change of the wind which still continues rather favourable. Continued heavy rain till nearly eleven then cleared up and the wind increased, but not favourable taking us too much to the south instead of crossing the Gulf Stream. It is usual to go over the banks of Newfoundland but the Captain feared the icebergs. The Captain said if there was anything done by the Almighty which he could wish altered it would be the Gulf Stream; there is not only a current against us, but great uncertainty as to calms and storms. Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy and her sister dined with us to-day. Jackson more than usually foolish. Some of the passengers trying to put their legs over an American flour cask, and so raise themselves over it upon their feet. Went upon deck and was much pleased with the appearance of the sea; the ship was sailing through liquid fire; the sides of the vessel being quite illuminated with the foam, and the ocean was covered apparently by fire occasioned by the breakers. Passed the day without seeing either sail or fish.   THURSDAY, MAY 29TH.  Passed another comfortable night, found we had been getting on pretty well; nearly out of the Stream with the intention of shooting across the first fair wind.  The wind continues pretty favourable. A child died aged nine months. A stone with two lumps of iron are tied up to sink the child. At six the bell tolled, the little thing was placed upon a door and when the Minister, Mr. H. came to that part of committing the body to the deep it was slid off into the ocean and immediately disappeared, to be eaten by fish instead of worms. The mother did not come upon deck, her name Johnson, has 7 or 8 other children with her; the husband I believe in America.  Jackson told the Captain last night that he lost his father last 29th May, surely this circumstance will help him to a little more steadiness but this was hardly the case, excepting as occasioned by yesterday's debauch. Mr. Seaton says bastardy is not so common in America but always charged to the father. Mr. Cayley takes no exercise, says he never walks on ship, eats a good deal of animal food; a very bad system, either exercise or abstinence is essentially necessary.   FRIDAY, MAY 30TH.  Passed another good night though dreaming more of home and the warehouse; was delighted to find a fair wind and that it had been the same during the night; continued so all day but the rolling of the ship on going to breakfast made me rather sickly most of the forenoon; in fact we pitched and tossed more than ever with heavy rain a good part of the day, so that but for the wind being favourable we should consider it the most unpleasant day we have had; no ships, no fish or anything to divert the tedium.  This morning two of the sails were torn to ribbands. Frequent jelly-like substances floating on the ocean of various colours formed like a cockscomb commonly called Portuguese men-of-war.   SATURDAY, MAY 31ST.  Another good night, found the wind favourable but not much of this most of the night. A warm political discussion; I stated that America and not Dan O'Connell was the great political agitator. Speaking of the immense salaries paid in England I said the Government was more in fault in granting them, it being only human nature to receive. Captain Kenney said he should like to subscribe to send the radicals out of the country. I thought it would be better to employ the subscriptions in getting all the democrats away. A dense mist continued on the surface of the ocean till eleven, when it suddenly disappeared. A ship discovered by Mr. Grindrod.  I cannot forget that this is the anniversary of the interment of my dear father. Finished the second volume of Hall's \"Journal of a Voyage to Chili, etc.\" Learned from Captain Kenney that the journey from London to Moscow by Hamburgh, Lübeck, St. Petersburgh may be done in a week for about £34; that there is no difficulty with regard to passports, but that you must advertise every district visited in the \"St. Petersburgh Gazette,\" and that you are leaving there in three weeks; you can then stop that time but no longer in one place. At dinner we had some interesting discussion on phrenology, and also respecting future punishment and the different degrees; the latter I was glad to find was the creed of Mr. G. between whom and Mr. B. the conversation was carried on. On going on deck I was surprised to find that the Captain did not approve of such discussions.   SUNDAY, JUNE 1ST.  Passed a very comfortable night; found we had at length crossed the Gulf Stream; sensibly colder. The wind had not been favourable since last night. A very considerable mist occasioned by the warm water in the Stream coming in contact with the cold atmosphere--very cold.  The morning service according to the Church of England read by Mr. H. but not so many present on account of the cold--again in the"]]]
