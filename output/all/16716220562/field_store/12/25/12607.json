For it may be objected, that we are accustomed to educate the young by means of praise and blame; that we encourage them by kind words _from us_, that is, from man; and punish them for disobedience. If, then, it may be argued, it is right to regard the opinions of others concerning us in our youth, it cannot be in itself wrong to pay attention to it at any other period of life.  This is true; but I do not say that the mere love of praise and fear of shame are evil: regard to the corrupt world's praise or blame, this is what is sinful and dangerous.  St. John, in the text, implies that the praise of men was, at the time spoken of, in opposition to the praise of God.  It must be wrong to prefer any thing to the will of God.  To seek praise is in itself as little wrong, as it is wrong to hope, and to fear, and to love, and to trust; all depends upon the object hoped, or feared, or loved, or trusted; to seek the praise of good men is not wrong, any more than to love or to reverence good men; only wrong when it is in excess, when it interferes with the exercise of love and reverence towards God.  Not wrong while we look on good men singly as instruments and servants of God; or, in the words of Scripture, while \"we glorify God in them[1].\"  But to seek the praise of bad men, is in itself as wrong as to love the company of bad men, or to admire them.  It is not, I say, merely the love of praise that is a sin, but love of the corrupt world's praise.  This is the case with all our natural feelings and affections; they are all in themselves good, and implanted by God; they are sinful, because we have in us by nature a something more than them, viz. an evil principle which perverts them to a bad end.  Adam, before his fall, felt, we may suppose, love, fear, hope, joy, dislike, as we do now; but then he felt them only when he ought, and as he ought; all was harmoniously attempered and rightly adjusted in his soul, which was at unity with itself.  But, at the fall, this beautiful order and peace was broken up; the same passions remained, but their use and action were changed; they rushed into extremes, sometimes excessive, sometimes the reverse.  Indignation was corrupted into wrath, self-love became selfishness, self-respect became pride, and emulation envy and jealousy.  They were at variance with each other; pride struggled with self-interest, fear with desire.  Thus his soul became a chaos, and needed a new creation.  Moreover, as I have said, his affections were set upon unsuitable objects.  The natural man looks to this world, the world is his god; faith, love, hope, joy, are not excited in his mind by things spiritual and divine, but by things seen and temporal.  Considering, then, that love of praise is not a bad principle in itself, it is plain that a parent may very properly teach his child to love his praise, and fear his blame, when that praise and blame are given in accordance with God's praise and blame, and made subservient to them.  And, in like manner, if the world at large took a correct and religious view of things, then its praise and blame would in its place be valuable too.  Did the world admire what God admires; did it account humility, for instance, a great virtue, and pride a great sin; did it condemn that spirit of self-importance and sensitiveness of disgrace, which calls itself a love of honour; did it think little of temporal prosperity, wealth, rank, grandeur, and power, did it condemn arrogant and irreverent disputing, the noisy, turbulent spirit of ambition, the love of war and conquest, and the perverse temper which leads to jealousy and hatred; did it prefer goodness and truth to gifts of the intellect; did it think little of quickness, wit, shrewdness, power of speech and general acquirements, and much of patience, meekness, gentleness, firmness, faith, conscientiousness, purity, forgiveness of injuries,--then there would be no sin in our seeking the world's praise; and though we still ought to love God's praise above all, yet we might love the praise of the world in its degree, for it would be nothing more nor less than the praise of good men.  But since, alas! the contrary is the case, since the world (as Scripture tells us) \"lieth in wickedness,\" and the principles and practices which prevail on all sides of us are not those which the All-holy God sanctions, we cannot lawfully seek the world's praise.  We cannot serve two masters who are enemies the one to the other.  We are forbidden to love the world or any thing that is of the world, for it is not of the Father, but passeth away.  This is the reason why it is wrong to pursue the world's praise; viz. because we cannot have it and God's praise too.  And yet, as the pursuit of it is wrong, so is it common,--for this reason: because God is unseen, and the world is seen; because God's praise and blame are future, the world's are present; because God's praise and blame are inward, and come quietly and without keenness, whereas the world's are very plain and intelligible, and make themselves felt.  Take, for instance, the case of the young, on (what is called) entering into life.  Very many, indeed, there are, whether in a higher or lower station, who enter into the mixed society of others early; so early, that it might be thought they had hardly had time to acquire any previous knowledge of right and wrong, any standard of right and wrong, other than the world gives, any principles by which to fight against the world.  And yet it cannot quite be so.  Whatever is the first time persons hear evil, it is quite certain that good has been beforehand with them, and they have a something within them which tells them it is evil.  And much more, if they have been blessed, as most men are, with the protection of parents, or the kind offices of teachers or of God's ministers, they generally have principles of duty more or less strongly imprinted on their minds; and on their first intercourse with strangers they are shocked or frighted at seeing the improprieties and sins, which are openly countenanced.  Alas! there are persons, doubtless (though God forbid it should be the case with any here present!), whose consciences have been so early trained into forgetfulness of religious duties, that they can hardly, or cannot at all, recollect the time I speak of; the time when they acted with the secret feeling that God saw them, saw all they did and thought.  I will not fancy this to be the case with any who hear me.  Rather, there are many of you, in different ranks and circumstances, who have, and ever have had, general impressions on your minds of the claims which religion has on you, but, at the same time, have been afraid of acting upon them, afraid of the opinion of the world, of what others would say if you set about obeying your conscience.  Ridicule is a most powerful instrument in the hands of Satan, and it is most vividly felt by the young.  If any one wishes to do his duty, it is most easy for the cold, the heartless, and the thoughtless, to find out harsh, or provoking, or ridiculous names to fix upon him.  My brethren, so many of you as are sensitive of the laughter or contempt of the world, this is your cross; you must wear it, you must endure it patiently; it is the mark of your conformity to Christ; He despised the shame: you must learn to endure it, from the example and by the aid of your Saviour.  You must love the praise of God more than the praise of men.  It is the very trial suited to you, appointed for you, to establish you in the faith.  You are not tempted with gain or ambition, but with ridicule.  And be sure, that unless you withstand it, you cannot endure hardships as good soldiers of Jesus Christ, you will not endure other temptations which are to follow.  How can you advance a step in your after and more extended course till the first difficulty is overcome?  You need faith, and \"a double-minded man,\" says St. James, \"is unstable in all his ways.\"  Moreover, be not too sure that all who show an inclination to ridicule you, feel exactly as they say.  They speak with the loudest speaker; speak you boldly, and they will speak with you.  They have very little of definite opinion themselves, or probably they even feel with you, though they speak against you.  Very likely they have uneasy, unsatisfied consciences, though they seem to sin so boldly; and are as afraid of the world as you can be, nay, more so; they join in ridiculing you, lest others should ridicule them; or they do so in a sort of self-defence against the reproaches of their own consciences.  Numbers in this bad world talk loudly against religion in order to encourage each other in sin, because they need encouragement.  They are cowards, and rely on each other for support against their fears.  They know they ought to be other than they are, but are glad to avail themselves of any thing that looks like argument, to overcome their consciences withal.  And ridicule is a kind of argument--such as it is; and numbers ridiculing together are a still stronger one--of the same kind.  Any how, there are few indeed who will not feel afterwards, in times of depression or alarm, that you are right, and they themselves are wrong. Those who serve God faithfully have a friend of their own, in each man's bosom, witnessing for them; even in those who treat them ill. And I suppose no young person has been able, through God's mercy, to withstand the world's displeasure, but has felt at this time or that, that this is so, and in a little time will, with all humility, have the comfort of feeling it while he is withstanding the world.  But now supposing he has not had strength of mind to withstand the world; but has gone the way of the world.  Suppose he has joined the multitude in saying and doing what he should not.

Supposing a person has been one of these, and then through God's grace repents.  It often pleases God, in the course of His Providence, to rouse men to reflection by the occurrences of life.  In such circumstances they certainly will have a severe trial to stand against the world.  Nothing is more painful in the case of such persons, than the necessity often imposed upon them of acting contrary to the opinion and wishes of those with whom they have till now been intimate,--whom they have admired and followed.  Intimacies have already been formed, and ties drawn tight, which it is difficult to sever.  What is the person in question to do? rudely to break them at once? no.  But is he to share in sins in which he formerly took part? no; whatever censure, contempt, or ridicule attaches to him in consequence.  But what, then, is he to do?  His task, I say, is painful and difficult, but he must not complain, for it is his own making; it is the natural consequence of his past neglect of God.  So much is plain,--he must abstain from all sinful actions; not converse lightly or irreverently where formerly he was not unwilling so to do; not spend his time, as heretofore, in idleness or riot; avoid places whither he is not called by actual duty, which offer temptation to sin; observe diligently attendance on church; not idle away the Lord's Day in vanity, or worse; not add to the number of his acquaintance any thoughtless persons.  All this is quite plain, and in doing this I know he will incur the ridicule of his companions.  He will have much to bear.  He must bear to be called names, to be thought a hypocrite, to be thought to be affecting something out of the way, to be thought desirous of recommending himself to this or that person.  He must be prepared for malicious and untrue reports about himself; many other trials must he look for.  They are his portion.  He must pray God to enable him to bear them meekly.  He must pray for himself, he must pray for those who ridicule him.  He has deserved ridicule.  He has nothing to boast of, if he bears it well.  He has nothing to boast of that he incurs it.  He has nothing to boast of, as if he were so much better than those who ridicule him; he was once as they are now.  He is now just a little better than they are.  He has just begun a new life.  He has got a very little way in it, or rather no way, nothing beyond professing it; and he has the reproach of the world in consequence of his profession.  Well, let him see to it that this reproach is not in vain, that he has a right to the reproach.  Let him see to it that he acts as well as professes.  It will be miserable indeed if he incurs the reproach, and yet does not gain the reward.  Let him pray God to perfect in him what He has begun in him, and to begin and perfect it also in all those that reproach him.  Let him pray for Christ's grace to bear hardships in Christ's spirit; to be able to look calmly in the world's face, and bear its frown; to trust in the Lord, and be doing good; to obey God, and so to be reproached, not for professing only, but for performing, not for doing nothing, but for doing something, and in God's cause.  If we are under reproach, let us have something to show for it.  At present, such a one is but a child in the Gospel; but in time, St. Peter's words will belong to him, and he may appropriate them.  \"This is thankworthy, if a man for conscience towards God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.  For what glory is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.\"  What happens to the young in one way, and to penitent sinners in another, happens in one way or other to all of us.  In the case of all of us occasions arise, when practices countenanced by others do not approve themselves to our consciences.  If after serious thought we find we cannot acquiesce in them, we must follow our consciences, and stand prepared for the censure of others.  We must submit (should it be unavoidable) to appear to those who have no means of understanding us, self-willed, or self-conceited, or obstinate, or eccentric, or headstrong, praying the while that God's mercy may vouchsafe to us, that we be not really what we seem to the world.  Some are exposed to a temptation of a different kind, that of making themselves seem more religious than they really are.  It may happen, that to advocate right opinions may be profitable to our worldly interests, and be attended by the praise of men.  You may ask, since in such cases God and man approve the same thing, why should the applause of the world be accounted dangerous then?  I answer, it is dangerous because God requires of us a modest silence in our religion; but we cannot be religious in the eyes of men without displaying religion.  I am now speaking of display.  God sees our thoughts without our help, and praises _them_; but we cannot be praised by men without being seen by men: whereas often the very excellence of a religious action, according to our Saviour's precept, consists in the not being seen by others.  This is a frequent cause of hypocrisy in religion.  Men begin by feeling as they should feel, then they think it a very hard thing that men should not know how well they feel, and in course of time they learn to speak without feeling.  Thus they have learned to \"love the praise of men more than the praise of God.\"--We have to guard against another danger, against the mistake of supposing that the world's despising us is a proof that we are particularly religious; for this, too, is often supposed.  Frequently it happens that we encumber our religion with extravagances, perversions, or mistakes, with which religion itself has no necessary connexion, and these, and not religion, excite the contempt of the world.  So much is this the case, that the censure of numbers, or of the sober-minded, or of various and distinct classes of men, or censure consistently urged, or continued consistently, ought always to lead a man to be very watchful as to what he considers right to say or do in the line of duty, to lead him to examine his principles; to lead him, however thoroughly he adheres to these after all, to be unaffectedly humble about himself, and to convince him in matter of fact (what he might be quite sure of beforehand, from the nature of the case), that, however good his principles are in themselves, he is mixing up with them the alloy of his own frail and corrupt nature.  In conclusion, I would say to those who fear the world's censure, this:--  1. Recollect you cannot please all parties, you must disagree with some or other: you have only to choose (if you are determined to look to man) with which you will disagree.  And, further, you may be sure that those who attempt to please all parties, please fewest; and that the best way to gain the world's good opinion (even if you were set upon this, which you must not be) is to show that you prefer the praise of God.  Make up your mind to be occasionally misunderstood, and undeservedly condemned.  You must, in the Apostle's words, go through evil report, and good report, whether on a contracted or a wider field of action.  And you must not be anxious even for the praise of good men.  To have, indeed, the approbation of those whose hearts are guided by God's Holy Spirit, is indeed much to be coveted.  Still this is a world of discipline, not of enjoyment; and just as we are sometimes bound in duty to abstain from indulgences of sense in themselves innocent, so are we sometimes bound to deny ourselves the satisfaction derived from the praise even of the religious and conscientious.  Only let us beware in all this, lest we act from pride and self-conceit.  2. In the next place, think of the multitude of beings, who, unseen themselves, may yet be surveying our conduct.  St. Paul charges Timothy by the elect Angels[2]; and elsewhere he declares that the Apostles were made \"a spectacle unto the world, and to Angels, and to men[3].\" Are we then afraid to follow what is right, lest the world should scoff? rather let us be afraid not to follow it, because God sees us, and Christ, and the holy Angels.  They rejoice over one sinner that repenteth; how must they mourn over those who fall away!  What interest, surely, is excited among them, by the sight of the Christian's trial, when faith and the desire of the world's esteem are struggling in his heart for victory! what rejoicing if, through the grace of God, he overcomes! what sorrow and pity if he is overcome by the world!  Accustom yourselves, then, to feel that you are on a public stage, whatever your station of life may be, that there are other witnesses to your conduct besides the world around you; and, if you feel shame of men, you should much more feel shame in the presence of God, and those servants of His that do His pleasure.  3. Still further: you fear the judgment of men upon you.  What will you think of it on your death-bed?  The hour must come, sooner or later, when your soul is to return to Him who gave it.  Perhaps you will be sensible of your awful state.  What will you then think of the esteem of the world? will not all below seem to pass away, and be rolled up as a scroll, and the extended regions of the future solemnly set themselves before you?  Then how vain will appear the applause or blame of creatures, such as we are, all sinners and blind judges, and feeble aids, and themselves destined to be judged for their deeds.  When, then, you are tempted to dread the ridicule of man, throw your mind forward to the hour of death.  You know what you will then think of it, if you are then able to think at all.  4. The subject is not exhausted.  You fear shame;"]]]
