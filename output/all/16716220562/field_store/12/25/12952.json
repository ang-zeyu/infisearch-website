And it wouldn't have been anything remarkable for him if he had. He had already squirmed out of his skin six times that summer--though not from fear, of course. Casting his skin was almost a habit with Kiddie. All his family were like that.  Though he was not nearly so old as Mr. Nighthawk, Kiddie Katydid had learned a thing or two during his brief lifetime. And though he would have liked very much to jump--and jump out of Mr. Nighthawk's sight, too--he had no wish to hide himself _inside_ that feathered scoundrel. So he clung all the tighter to his perch and replied that he didn't believe he cared to do any jumping that night.  Now, Mr. Nighthawk had a certain odd trick of talking through his nose. Whether that was because the late hours he kept, even on dark nights, gave him a cold in his head, nobody seemed to know. Anyhow, he began teasing Kiddie Katydid to jump for him--and he talked through his nose more than ever. Yes! although Mr. Nighthawk tried his best to speak pleasantly, he only succeeded in making Kiddie Katydid want to laugh at him, for all Kiddie was so uneasy.     IV  A WHINING CALLER   \"I certainly hope you aren't going to disappoint me?\" Mr. Nighthawk whined, as he looked hungrily at Kiddie Katydid. \"Please, please jump for me--just once!\" he begged. \"Here I've come all the way across the meadow on purpose to see what a fine jumper you are! And I shall feel very unhappy if you don't perform for me.\"  But Kiddie Katydid refused to budge.  \"I hadn't intended to do any leaping to-night,\" he told Mr. Nighthawk. \"And if I jumped for you, it would only upset my plans.\"  \"I know--I know,\" said Mr. Nighthawk, nodding his head. \"But I thought that just to oblige a friend you wouldn't object to jumping from this tree into that one.\" And he pointed to the nearest maple, the branches of which all but touched the tree-top in which they were sitting. But Kiddie Katydid's mind was made up.  \"No jumping for me to-night!\" he piped in a shrill voice.  All this time Mr. Nighthawk was growing hungrier than ever. And one might well wonder why he didn't make one quick spring at Kiddie Katydid and swallow him. But that was not Mr. Nighthawk's way of dining.  \"Well,\" he said at last, \"though you refuse to jump for me, won't you kindly call some other member of your family and ask him to oblige me?\"  \"I don't know where my relations are just now,\" replied Kiddie Katydid. \"Some of them were here a while ago; but they went away.\" And that was quite true! At that _peent_--that first warning cry--of Mr. Nighthawk's, they had all vanished as if by magic, among the leaves.  \"What about that Katy you're always talking about?\" Mr. Nighthawk then inquired. \"Don't you suppose you could find _her_ and persuade _her_ to do a little jumping for me--just to show me how it's done?\"  \"I'm sorry--\" Kiddie said somewhat stiffly, \"I'm sorry; but I must absolutely refuse to do such a thing. Now that you've mentioned her, I'll simply say _Katy did_. And beyond that I cannot discuss her with you.\"  \"She did what?\" Mr. Nighthawk wanted to know--through his nose.  But Kiddie Katydid declined to answer that question. He merely hugged his wings closer to his green body, and shot a sly glance at Mr. Nighthawk, as if to say, \"Ah! That's for _you_ to find out! But I shan't tell you!\"  Mr. Nighthawk looked rather foolish. He had always supposed that any one who spent a good part of every night saying the same thing over and over and over again must be quite dull-witted. But now he began to think that perhaps Kiddie Katydid was brighter than the field people generally believed him to be. And when Kiddie suddenly asked _him_ a question, he was sure of his mistake.  \"Did you know,\" said Kiddie, \"that Solomon Owl often visits these farm buildings?\"  \"Why, no! I wasn't aware of that,\" Mr. Nighthawk replied with a quick, nervous look behind him. \"What brings him here?\"  \"Chickens!\" Kiddie Katydid explained. \"Solomon Owl is very fond of chickens. But they do say that he's not above eating a nighthawk when he happens to stumble upon one.\"     V  SOLOMON OWL'S CRY   For a few moments Mr. Nighthawk fidgeted about on his branch of the maple tree. What Kiddie Katydid said to him about Solomon Owl frightened him. And he almost wished he hadn't come to Farmer Green's dooryard that night.  But the more he thought about the matter, the less he was inclined to believe that there was really any danger. And soon he peered at Kiddie Katydid through the darkness and said:  \"You almost fooled me. But I know now what you were trying to do. You were trying to scare me away from here!\"  \"_Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did!_\"  \"You needn't say that!\" Mr. Nighthawk exclaimed. \"Katy has nothing to do with my case. She hasn't even mentioned Solomon Owl's name.\"  \"You don't understand,\" Kiddie told him. \"I'm speaking of an entirely different matter.\"  And then Mr. Nighthawk had another idea. He chased the frown away from his face and smiled very pleasantly.  \"I'm sorry that you don't feel like jumping for me,\" he observed. \"But I'd be just as glad to see you fly! I remember being told that you fly almost as well as you jump.\"  \"Oh, I can't begin to fly as well as you can,\" Kiddie Katydid told Mr. Nighthawk. \"I only wish I knew how to coast down out of the sky the way you do, without being dashed upon the ground.... How do you manage to stop so suddenly?\"  \"Pooh! That's nothing!\" Mr. Nighthawk said. \"It's easy, once you know how.\"  In spite of his way of belittling his flying feats, Mr. Nighthawk was secretly very proud of his skill at sky-coasting. And when Kiddie Katydid asked him if he wouldn't kindly give an exhibition of the art of fancy flying, Mr. Nighthawk couldn't help feeling pleased.  He wanted to display his skill. But there was just one thing that troubled him. He was afraid that if he climbed up into the sky, before he dropped down again Kiddie Katydid would have vanished. And that didn't suit Mr. Nighthawk's plans.  \"Will you promise to stay right where you are until I come back?\" he asked.  Now, Kiddie Katydid had intended to hide himself as soon as Mr. Nighthawk should leave him. But there was nothing he could do now except to agree to Mr. Nighthawk's proposal.  \"I'll promise,\" said Kiddie, \"if you'll promise me that you'll surely return. Otherwise I might have to stay here for a month, perhaps, waiting for you.\"  \"Oh! I'll come back in a minute or two,\" Mr. Nighthawk laughed, as he looked hungrily at Kiddie. \"Don't you worry about my not coming back to talk with you!\"  Then he began climbing upwards into the sky. And he had gone about as high as he wished to, when all at once a rolling _Whoo-whoo-whoo_, _whoo-whoo_, _to-whoo-ah_ startled him. It was Solomon Owl's weird call. And it drove every thought except one out of Mr. Nighthawk's head. That one idea--to escape--filled his mind completely. And he turned and hurried away from Farmer Green's place as fast as he could go; for Mr. Nighthawk feared that Solomon Owl would arrive there at any moment.  As for Kiddie Katydid, when he heard Solomon's cry he knew at once that he was rid of Mr. Nighthawk. And Kiddie's _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did_ rang out again and again in the night. All his friends and cousins crept out of their hiding-places and joined in the chorus. And everybody enjoyed a good laugh over Mr. Nighthawk's visit--and his sudden departure.  Perhaps Kiddie may be forgiven for boasting the least bit, as his companions crowded around him.  \"I knew better than to jump for Mr. Nighthawk!\" he cried. \"I happened to know that he always wants to catch his food _on the wing_. And if I had jumped, or tried to fly away, he would have snatched me right out of the air as quick as lightning.\"     VI  FREDDIE FIREFLY'S DISCOVERY   That secret about Katy, and what she did, was not the only one that Kiddie hid from the field people. He had another--something about himself--that nobody ever suspected, until Freddie Firefly stumbled upon it one night.  Probably Freddie would never have learned this second secret had he not been trying to find out about the first one. Over in the meadow he had heard Kiddie Katydid shrilling his well-worn ditty, _Katy did; she did, she did!_ And he had danced his way into Farmer Green's dooryard because he wanted to have a talk with Kiddie and ask him some questions about that unknown lady.  Like all others who tried to pry into the mystery, Freddie Firefly had no luck at all. For Kiddie Katydid made no reply to his inquiries. Kiddie merely smiled in a most annoying fashion and kept on repeating the refrain.  \"Doesn't your voice ever get tired, singing those silly words over and over again all night long?\" Freddie Firefly finally asked.  \"Oh! no, indeed!\" said Kiddie Katydid. \"On the contrary it rests my voice to do this.\" And he solemnly shrilled the chorus more rapidly than ever.  \"There's something queer about that cry of yours!\" Freddie Firefly suddenly exclaimed. \"I'm watching you closely; but I can't see that your mouth moves the least bit.\"  Again Kiddie Katydid smiled. He saw that Freddie Firefly was puzzled.  \"Why do you keep moving your wings when you say _Katy did_?\" Freddie Firefly asked him at last.  But Kiddie refused to answer that question--a fact which at once made Freddie suspicious. He moved nearer Kiddie Katydid and flashed his light upon him every time Kiddie repeated his odd statement about Katy. And soon Freddie Firefly grew much excited. He actually danced up and down, he was so astonished.  \"I've found you out!\" he cried in a loud voice. \"It's no wonder your voice doesn't get tired from that song! For you don't really _sing_ it at all! You "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24608"],["title","The Tale of Kiddie Katydid (#2)"],["body","that queer _sound by rubbing your wing covers together_!\"  Kiddie Katydid abruptly ceased his shrilling. He looked most uncomfortable. And it was not surprising. He had not supposed that Freddie Firefly--or anybody else--would be shrewd enough to discover that secret. It was a family secret--one that had been closely guarded by the Katydids since the beginning of time, almost. And here he had gone and let Freddie Firefly find it out!  \"I'm right about that and you can't deny it!\" cried Freddie Firefly boldly. \"You may as well admit that what I say is true,\" he added.  \"I certainly won't dispute you,\" Kiddie Katydid replied. \"I have too good manners to do anything so rude as that.\"  \"I don't care about your manners,\" Freddie answered. \"I dare say they're good enough, although some people think it's rather rude of you to make so much noise when a good many others are trying to sleep.\"  \"I should like to know who objects to my music?\" Kiddie Katydid exclaimed hotly. \"If Farmer Green has been talking to you, I should like to state that he had better be careful. Anyone who drives a clattering mowing-machine around, when a lot of us are trying to get our rest in the daytime, ought not to complain about a little _music_ on a pleasant night like this.\"  [Illustration: Kiddie's Secret is Discovered by Freddie Firefly  (_Page 28_)]     VII  FREDDIE WANTS TO TELL   As soon as Kiddie Katydid mentioned the word _music_, Freddie Firefly began to dance and shout.  \"There!\" he cried. \"You've just the same as told me that I was right. If you _sang_ your _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did_, you would call it _singing_. But since you make that ditty by rubbing your wing covers together, it is _music_. And you just referred to it as such!\"  Well, Kiddie Katydid couldn't say a single word. Freddie Firefly was right. They both knew it. And the secret was hopelessly \"out.\" In fact, it was a secret no longer--unless Kiddie Katydid could persuade Freddie Firefly to keep the news to himself.  \"You won't say anything about this little matter, I hope,\" Kiddie began.  \"Won't I?\" said Freddie Firefly. \"Why, I just couldn't help telling people what I've learned! It's the biggest bit of news that I've known since I've lived in Pleasant Valley. And I must get word of it to old Mr. Crow somehow.\"  \"Why Mr. Crow?\" Kiddie Katydid inquired anxiously. He knew that the old gentleman was a great gossip. \"You might as well put this in a newspaper as tell Mr. Crow about it.\"  \"Ah! That's just the point!\" cried Freddie. \"Mr. Crow _is_ a newspaper. Perhaps you didn't know it; but every Saturday he flies over Blue Mountain to the pond where Brownie Beaver lives and tells Brownie all the news of the past week.\"  \"Then for pity's sake, don't let _him_ hear of this!\" Kiddie begged.  But nothing could have stopped Freddie Firefly.  \"You're too modest,\" he said. \"It's a shame to be able to make music the way you do and not let the neighbors know it. Why, the first thing you know you'll be one of the most famous people in this whole valley.\"  \"But I don't want to be!\" Kiddie Katydid cried. \"I'm not like you. You go dancing about every night, flashing your light so everyone can see you. But I stay among the trees and shrubs. And I even wear a green suit--which matches the color of the leaves--so people won't notice me. Of course,\" Kiddie added, \"I don't mind if the public hears my music. But I don't care to be seen, as a rule. And I don't like callers a bit!\"  \"You don't, eh?\" remarked Freddie Firefly. \"Then it's time for me to be moving along. For I never stay where I'm not welcome.\" And he flitted away, feeling somewhat peevish--and all the more determined to get the news of the discovered secret to Mr. Crow at the earliest possible moment.  How he was going to do that he didn't quite know.  There was little chance of his seeing Mr. Crow, for the old gentleman only waked up at the time Freddie Firefly was ready to go to bed--about dawn.  He was pondering over his difficulty, which bothered him not a little, when a terrific croaking from the direction of the swamp reached his ears. It was the final chorus of the Frog family's nightly singing party. And it promptly put an idea into Freddie Firefly's head.  \"I'll hurry right over there and speak to Mr. Frog, the well-known tailor,\" he said to himself. \"He knows old Mr. Crow. He sees him almost every day. And he'll be glad to give the old gentleman a message.\"     VIII  SPREADING THE NEWS   When Freddie Firefly reached the swamp he found that the singing party had already broken up. But luckily, Mr. Frog the tailor was the last one to leave. He was still poised on the bank of the sluggish stream, ready to plunge into the water and swim away, when Freddie Firefly dropped down upon a cat-tail and called him by name, flashing his light frantically so that Mr. Frog would be sure to notice him.  \"Wait a moment!\" cried Freddie. \"I've something to say to you!\"  \"Out with it, then!\" said Mr. Frog. \"My time is valuable, you know. I ought to be back in my shop this moment; for I promised Paddy Muskrat I'd make him a policeman's uniform by to-morrow morning. And I haven't begun it yet.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Freddie, forgetting--for the moment--his own errand.  \"He wants brass buttons,\" explained the tailor. \"And I couldn't get any until to-night.\"  \"But couldn't you go ahead without them?\" Freddie Firefly inquired.  \"Certainly not!\" replied Mr. Frog. \"I see you don't know much about making a policeman's suit. You start by laying the buttons in a row on the ground; and then you sew the cloth onto them.... That's my own invention--that method,\" he added with an air of pride. \"And now, what was it you wanted to say to me?\"  \"I don't believe there's any use of my telling you, after all,\" Freddie Firefly replied. \"You're going to be so busy that you won't have time to do an errand for me. I wanted you to give Mr. Crow a message.\"  \"Yes--I'll be altogether too rushed to bother with it,\" said Mr. Frog. \"I expect to be on the jump all night--and most of to-morrow, too.\"  \"This message,\" Freddie Firefly went on, \"was something about Kiddie Katydid. I found out his secret to-night. And I thought Mr. Crow ought to know about it.\"  Now, Mr. Frog was all ready to leap into the water. But when Freddie said that, the tailor promptly changed his mind.  \"Kiddie Katydid's secret!\" he repeated in a tone of amazement. \"You don't mean to say you've discovered what it was that Katy did?\"  \"Never mind!\" said Freddie. \"I don't want to trouble you, Mr. Frog. I know you're too busy to bother your head with such things.\"  \"Tut, tut, young man!\" Mr. Frog cried. \"I see you have something important to tell me. And since that is the case, I'll manage somehow to deliver your message to Mr. Crow, even if I have to disappoint a customer. _Always oblige a friend!_ That's my motto!\" said Mr. Frog.  \"Very well, then!\" Freddie Firefly replied. \"I'll say what I was going to; but it doesn't concern that Katy person you just mentioned.\"  \"Oh, it doesn't,\" the tailor echoed. \"Then I don't know that I care to listen to you, after all. I thought you were going to explain about that mysterious lady that Kiddie's always singing about.\" He was sadly disappointed. And once more he turned toward the creek.     IX  MR. FROG IS PLEASED   \"Kiddie Katydid doesn't sing!\" Freddie Firefly told Mr. Frog hurriedly.  And Mr. Frog was so surprised that he almost sat right down in the mud.  \"What do you mean?\" he cried. \"You must be crazy! For there isn't a single person in all Pleasant Valley that hasn't heard Kiddie Katydid singing his tiresome song on a fine midsummer night.\"  \"That--\" replied Freddie Firefly--\"that is just where you're mistaken, Mr. Frog. And that's where everybody else is mistaken, too. To-night I was lucky enough to learn that Kiddie Katydid has been fooling us all this time.\"  \"You don't say so!\" said Mr. Frog. \"Then who is it that sings that everlasting chorus?\"  \"Nobody!\"  \"Nonsense!\" Mr. Frog scoffed. \"I can be fooled once, maybe. But I'm not to be fooled twice. And you needn't think for a moment that you can make me believe any such thing.\"  \"I don't care whether you believe it or not,\" Freddie Firefly declared. \"All I ask you to do is to tell the story to Mr. Crow.\"  \"He won't believe it, either,\" the tailor retorted.  \"Perhaps he will when he hears the rest of the message,\" Freddie answered. \"I was just going to explain that Kiddie Katydid has a trick of rubbing his wing covers together to make that _Katy did_ sound.\"  \"For the land's sake!\" cried Mr. Frog, as he leaped into the water, convinced at last of the truth of Freddie Firefly's claim. \"I must hurry home at once, for dawn's already breaking. And Mr. Crow may come sailing over my place at any moment.\" He landed with a splash in the creek and started to swim rapidly away. But after a few strokes he paused and turned around. \"You might almost say that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler, mightn't you?\" he called.  \"Something like that!\" Freddie Firefly agreed a bit doubtfully.  \"I'll tell Mr. Crow that, anyhow,\" said the tailor. \"It will make the story more interesting, at least. And so far as I can see, it can't do any harm.\"  And then he hastened away, leaving Freddie Firefly to get home as best he could in the gray of the early morning.  \"You may as well put out your light!\" Mr. Frog shouted back, as he disappeared among the reeds. But he didn't wait to see whether Freddie took his advice. He was too much excited over the strange news. And as he swam easily along with practiced strokes he kept talking to himself.  \"I'm a pretty clever chap, I am!\" he chuckled. \"I've discovered a great secret this night. And old Mr. Crow will be glad to hear all about it. Perhaps he'll want me to help him with his newspaper after this.  \"And for all I know I'll have so much to do that I won't be able to make any more clothes for my customers.\"  He hadn't swum far before he had entirely forgotten that it was really"]]]
