It was streaming in through the windows with careless abandon, filling the room with a lot of bright sunshine and the muggy heat of the city. From the street below, the cheerful noises of traffic and pedestrians floated up and filled Malone's ears.  He turned over in bed, and tried to go back to sleep.  But sleep wouldn't come. After a long time he gave up, and swung himself over the edge of the bed. Standing up was a delicate job, but he managed it, feeling rather proud of himself in a dim, semiconscious sort of way.  He went into the bathroom, brushed his teeth, and then opened the connecting door to Boyd's room softly.  Boyd was home. He lay in a great tangle of bedclothes, snoring hideously and making little motions with his hands and arms like a beached whale. Malone padded over to him and dug him fiercely in the ribs.  \"Come on,\" he said. \"Wake up, Tommy-boy.\"  Boyd's eyes did not open. In a voice as hollow as a zombie's, he said: \"My head. Hurts.\"  \"Can't feel any worse than mine,\" Malone said cheerily. This, he reflected, was not quite true. Considering everything it had been through recently, his head felt remarkably like its old, carefree self. \"You'll feel better once you're awake.\"  \"No, I won't,\" Boyd said simply. He jammed his head under a pillow and began to snore again. It was an awesome sound, like a man strangling to death in chicken-fat. Malone sighed and poked at random among the bedclothes.  Boyd swore distantly, and Malone poked him again.  \"The sun is up,\" Malone said, \"and all the little pedestrians are chirping. It is time to rise.\"  Boyd said: \"Gah,\" and withdrew his head from the pillow. Gently, as if he were afraid he were going to fall apart, he rose to a sitting position. When he had arrived at it, he opened his eyes.  \"Now,\" Malone said, \"isn't that better?\"  Boyd closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said.  \"Come on,\" Malone said. \"We've got to be up and moving.\"  \"I'm up,\" Boyd said. His eyes flickered open. \"But I can't move,\" he added. \"We had quite a time last night.\"  \"We?\" Malone said.  \"Me, and a couple of girls, and another guy. Just people I met.\" Boyd started to stand up and thought better of it. \"Just having a good time, that's all.\"  Malone thought of reading his partner a lecture on the Evils of Drink, and decided against it. Boyd might remember it, and use it against him some time. Then he realized what had to be done. He went back into his own room, dialed for room service, and ordered a couple of pots of strong black coffee.  By the time a good deal of that was awash in Boyd's intestinal system, he was almost capable of rational, connected conversation. He filled himself to the eyebrows with aspirins and other remedies, and actually succeeded in getting dressed. He seemed quite proud of this feat.  \"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"Now we have to go downstairs.\"  \"You mean outside?\" Boyd said. \"Into all that noise?\" He winced.  \"Bite the bullet,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"Keep a stiff upper lip.\"  \"Nonsense,\" Boyd said, hunting for his coat with a doleful air. \"Have you ever seen anybody with a loose upper lip?\"  Malone, busy with his own coat, didn't bother with a reply. He managed somehow to get Boyd downstairs and bundled into a cab. They headed for Sixty-ninth Street.         *       *       *       *       *  There, he made several phone calls. The first, of course, was to Burris in Washington. After that he got the New York Police Commissioner on the wire and, finding that he needed still more authority, he called the Mayor and then, by long-distance to Albany, the Governor.  But by noon he had everything straightened out. He had a plan fully worked out in his mind, and he had the authority to go ahead with it. Now, he could make his final call.  \"They're completely trustworthy,\" Burris had told him. \"Not only that, but they have a clearance for this kind of special work--we've needed them before.\"  \"Good,\" Malone said.  \"Not only that,\" Burris told him. \"They're good men. Maybe among the best in their field.\"  So Malone made his last call, to the firm of Leibowitz & Hardin, Electronic Engineers.  Then he beckoned to Boyd.  \"I don't see what I've been sitting around here for, all this time,\" his partner complained. \"I could have been home sleeping until you needed me. And--\"  \"I need you now,\" Malone said. \"I want you to take over part of this plan.\"  Boyd nodded sourly. \"Oh, all right,\" he said.  \"Here's what I want,\" Malone said. \"Every red 1972 Cadillac in the area is to be picked up for inspection. I don't care why--make up a reason. A general traffic check. Anything you please. You can work that end of it out with the Commissioner; he knows about it and he's willing to go along.\"  \"Great,\" Boyd said. \"Do you have any idea how many cars there are in a city this size?\"  \"Well, we don't want all of them,\" Malone said. \"Only red 1972 Cadillacs.\"  \"It's still a lot,\" Boyd said.  \"If there were only three,\" Malone said, \"we wouldn't have any problems.\"  \"And wouldn't that be nice?\" Boyd said.  \"Sure,\" Malone said, \"but it isn't true. Anyhow: I want every one of those cars checked for any oddity, no matter how small. If there's an inch-long scratch on one fender, I want to know about it. If you've got to take the cars apart, then do that.\"  \"Me?\" Boyd said. \"All by myself?\"  \"No,\" Malone said. \"Use your head. There'll be a team working with you. Let me explain it. Every nut, every bolt, every inch of those cars has to be examined thoroughly--got it?\"  \"I've got it,\" Boyd said, \"but I don't like it. After all, Malone--\"  Malone ignored him. \"The Governor of New York promised his co-operation,\" he said, \"and he said he'd get in touch with the Governors of New Jersey and Connecticut and get co-operation from that angle. So we'll have state and local police working with us.\"  \"That's a help,\" Boyd said. \"We'll make such a happy team of workmen. Singing as we pull the cars apart through the long day and night and ... listen, Malone, when do you want reports on this?\"  \"Yesterday,\" Malone said.  Boyd's eyebrows raised, then lowered. \"Great,\" he said dully.  \"I don't care how you get the cars,\" Malone said. \"If you've got to, condemn 'em. But get every last one of them. And bring them over to Leibowitz & Hardin for a complete checkup. I'll give you the address.\"  \"Thanks,\" Boyd said.  \"Not at all,\" Malone said. \"Glad to be of help. And don't worry; I'll have other work to do.\" He paused, and then went on: \"I talked to Dr. Isaac Leibowitz, he's the head of the firm out there--and he says....\"  \"Wait a minute,\" Boyd said.  \"What?\"  \"You mean I don't have to take the cars apart myself? You mean this Leibowitz & Hardin, or whatever it is, will do it for me?\"  \"Of course,\" Malone said wearily. \"You re not an auto technician or an electronics man. You're an agent of the FBI.\"  \"I was beginning to wonder,\" Boyd said. \"After all.\"  [Illustration]  \"Anyhow,\" Malone said doggedly, \"I talked to Leibowitz, and he says he can give a car a complete check in about six hours, normally.\"  \"Six hours?\" Boyd stared. \"That's going to take forever,\" he said.  \"Well, he can set up a kind of assembly-line process and turn out a car every fifteen minutes. Any better?\"  Boyd nodded.  \"Good,\" Malone said. \"There can't be so many 1972 red Cadillacs in the area that we can't get through them all at that speed.\" He thought a minute and then added: \"By the way, you might check with the Cadillac dealers around town, and find out just how many there are, sold to people living in the area.\"  \"And while I'm doing all that,\" Boyd said, \"what are you going to be doing?\"  Malone looked at him and sighed. \"I'll worry about that,\" he said. \"Just get started.\"  \"Suppose Leibowitz can't find anything?\" Boyd said.  \"If Leibowitz can't find it, it's not there,\" Malone said. \"He can find electronic devices anywhere in any car made, he says--even if they're printed circuits hidden under the paint job.\"  \"Pretty good,\" Boyd said. \"But suppose he doesn't?\"  \"Then they aren't there,\" Malone said, \"and we'll have to think of something else.\" He considered that. It sounded fine. Only he wished he knew what else there was to think of.  Well, that was just pessimism. Leibowitz would find something, and the case would be over, and he could go back to Washington and rest. In August he was going to have his vacation, anyway, and August wasn't very far away.  Malone put a smile carefully on his face and told Boyd: \"Get going.\" He slammed his hat on his head.  Wincing, he took it off and replaced it gently. The bottle of pills was still in his pocket, but he wasn't due for another one just yet.  He had time to go over to the precinct station in the West Eighties first.  He headed outside to get another taxi.     V.   The door didn't say anything at all except \"Lt. P. Lynch.\" Malone looked at it for a couple of seconds. He'd asked the Desk Sergeant for Lynch, shown his credentials and been directed up a set of stairs and around a hall. But he still didn't know what Lynch did, who he was, or what his name was doing in the little black notebook.  Well, he told himself, there was only one way to find out.  He opened the door.  The room was small and dark. It had a single desk in it, and three chairs, and a hatrack. There wasn't any coat or hat on the hatrack, and there was nobody in the chairs. In a fourth chair, behind the desk, a huskily-built man sat. He had steel-gray hair, a hard jaw and, Malone noticed with surprise, a faint twinkle in his eye.  \"Lieutenant Lynch?\" Malone said.  \"Right,\" Lynch said. \"What's the trouble?\"  \"I'm Kenneth J. Malone,\" Malone said. \"FBI.\" He reached for his wallet and found it. He flipped it open for Lynch, who stared at it for what seemed a long, long time and then burst into laughter.  \"What's so funny?\" Malone asked.  Lynch laughed some more.  \"Oh, come on,\" Malone said bitterly. \"After "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24444"],["title","Out Like a Light (#7)"],["body","all, there's no reason to treat an FBI agent like some kind of a--\"  \"FBI agent?\" Lynch said. \"Listen, buster, this is the funniest gag I've seen since I came on the Force. Who told you to pull it? Jablonski downstairs? Or one of the boys on the beat? I know those beat patrolmen, always on the lookout for a new joke. But this tops 'em all. This is the--\"  \"You're a disgrace to the Irish,\" Malone said tartly.  \"A what?\" Lynch said. \"I'm not Irish.\"  \"You talk like an Irishman,\" Malone said.  \"I know it,\" Lynch said, and shrugged. \"Around some precincts, you sort of pick it up. When all the other cops are ... hey, listen. How'd we get to talking about me?\"  \"I said you were a disgrace to the Irish,\" Malone said.  \"I was a--what?\"  \"Disgrace.\" Malone looked carefully at Lynch. In a fight, he considered, he might get in a lucky punch that would kill Malone. Otherwise, Malone didn't have a thing to worry about except a few months of hospitalization.  Lynch looked as if he were about to get mad, and then he looked down at Malone's wallet again and started to laugh.  \"What's so funny?\" Malone demanded.  He grabbed the wallet and turned it toward him. At once, of course, he realized what had happened. He had not flipped it open to his badge at all. He'd flipped it open, instead, to a card in the card-case:       KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE      PRESENTS THAT Sir Kenneth      Malone, Knight, is hereby formally      installed with the title of      KNIGHT OF THE BATH      and this card shall signify his right      to that title and his high and respected      position as officer in and of      THE QUEENS OWN F.B.I.  In a very small voice, Malone said: \"There's been a terrible mistake.\"  \"Mistake?\" Lynch said.  Malone flipped the wallet open to his FBI shield. Lynch gave it a good long examination, peering at it from every angle and holding it up to the light two or three times. He even wet his thumb and rubbed at the badge with it. At last he looked up.  \"I guess you are the FBI,\" he said. \"But what was with the gag?\"  \"It wasn't a gag,\" Malone said. \"It's just--\" He thought of the little old lady in Yucca Flats, the little old lady who had been the prime mover in the last case he and Boyd had worked on together. Without the little old lady, the case might never have been solved--she was an authentic telepath, about the best that had ever been found.  But with her, Boyd and Malone had had enough troubles. Besides being a telepath, she was quite thoroughly insane. She had one fixed delusion: she believed she was Queen Elizabeth I.  She was still at Yucca Flats, along with the other telepaths Malone's investigation had turned up. And she still believed, quite calmly, that she was Good Queen Bess. Malone had been knighted by her during the course of the investigation. This new honor had come to him through the mail; apparently she had decided to ennoble some of her friends still further.  Malone made a note mentally to ask Boyd if he'd received one. After all, there couldn't be too many Knights of the Bath. There was no sense in letting _everybody_ in.  Then he realized that he was beginning to believe everything again. There had been times, when he'd been working with the little old lady, when he had been firmly convinced that he was, in fact, the swaggering, ruthless swordsman, Sir Kenneth Malone. And even now....         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well?\" Lynch said.  \"It's too long a story,\" Malone said. \"And besides, it's not what I came here about.\"  Lynch shrugged again. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"Tell it your way.\"  \"First,\" Malone said, \"what's your job?\"  \"Me? Precinct Lieutenant.\"  \"Of this precinct?\"  Lynch stared. \"What else?\" he said.  \"Who knows?\" Malone said. He found the black notebook and passed it across to Lynch. \"I'm on this red Cadillac business, you know,\" he said by way of introduction.  \"I've been hearing about it,\" Lynch said. He picked up the notebook without opening it and held it like a ticking bomb. \"And I mean hearing about it,\" he said. \"We haven't had any trouble at all in this precinct.\"  \"I know,\" Malone said. \"I've read the reports.\"  \"Listen, not a single red Cadillac has been stolen from here, or been reported found here. We run a tight precinct here, and let me tell you--\"  \"I'm sure you do a fine job,\" Malone said hastily. \"But I want you to look at the notebook.\" He opened it to the page with Lynch's name on it.  Lynch opened his mouth, closed it and then took the notebook. He stared at the page for a few seconds. \"What's this?\" he said at last. \"Another gag?\"  \"No gag, lieutenant,\" Malone said.  \"It's your name and mine,\" Lynch said. \"What is that supposed to mean?\"  Malone shrugged. \"Search me,\" he said. \"The notebook was found only a couple of feet away from another car theft, last night.\" That was the simplest way he could think of to put it. \"So I asked the Commissioner who Peter Lynch was, and he told me it was you.\"  \"And it is,\" Lynch said, staring at the notebook. He seemed to be expecting it to rise and strike him.  Malone said: \"Have you got any idea who'd be writing about you and me?\"  Lynch shook his head. \"If I had any ideas I'd feel a lot better,\" he said. He wet his finger and turned the notebook pages carefully. When he saw the list of names on the second page he stopped again, and stared. This time he whistled under his breath.  Very cautiously, Malone said: \"Something?\"  \"I'll be damned,\" Lynch said feelingly.  \"What's wrong?\" Malone said.  The police lieutenant looked up. \"I don't know if it's wrong or what,\" he said. \"It gives me sort of the willies. I know every one of these kids.\"  Malone took out a pill and swallowed it in a hurry. He felt exactly as if he had been given another concussion, absolutely free and without any obligation. His mouth opened but nothing came out for a long time. At last he managed to say: \"_Kids?_\"  \"That's right,\" Lynch said. \"What did you think?\"  Malone shrugged helplessly.  \"Every single one of them,\" Lynch said. \"Right from around here.\"  There was a little silence.  \"Who are they?\" Malone said carefully.  \"They're some kind of kid gang, social club, something like that,\" Lynch said. \"They call themselves the Silent Spooks.\"  \"The what?\" It seemed to Malone that the name was just a little fancy, even for a kid gang.  \"The Silent Spooks,\" Lynch said. \"I can't help it. But here they are: Ramon Otravez, Mario Grito, Silvo Envoz, Felipe Altapor, Alvarez la Barba, Juan de los Santos and Ray del Este. Right down the line.\" He looked up from the notebook with a blank expression on his face. \"There's only one name missing, as a matter of fact. Funny it isn't there.\"  Malone tried to look as if he knew what was going on. \"Oh?\" he said.  \"Yeah,\" Lynch said. \"The Fueyo kid--Miguel Fueyo. Everybody calls him Mike.\"  While interesting, this did not provide much food for thought. \"Why should his name be on it especially?\" Malone said.  \"Because he's the leader of the gang,\" Lynch said. \"The boss. The big shot.\" He pointed to the list of names. \"Except for him, that's all of them--the Silent Spooks.\"  Malone considered the missing Mike Fueyo.  He knew perfectly well, now, why Fueyo's name was not in the book.  Who puts his own name on a list?  The notebook was Fueyo's. It had to be.         *       *       *       *       *  Lynch was looking at him expectantly. Malone thought of a question and asked it. \"They know you?\" he said.  \"Sure they do,\" Lynch said. \"They all know me. But do they know you?\"  Malone thought. \"They could have heard of me,\" he said at last, trying to be as modest as possible.  \"I guess,\" Lynch said grudgingly.  \"How old are they?\" Malone said.  \"Fourteen to seventeen,\" Lynch said. \"Somewhere in there. You know how these kid things run.\"  \"The Silent Spooks,\" Malone said meditatively. It was a nice name, in a way; you just had to get used to it for a while. When he had been a kid, he'd belonged to a group that called itself the East Division Street Kids. There just wasn't much romance in a name like that. Now, the Silent Spooks--  With a wrench, he brought his mind back to the subject at hand. \"Do they get into much trouble?\" he said.  \"Well, no,\" Lynch said reluctantly. \"As a matter of fact, they don't. For a bunch like that, around here, they're pretty well-behaved, as far as that goes.\"  \"What do you mean?\" Malone said.  Lynch's face took on a delicately unconcerned appearance. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"They just don't get into neighborhood trouble. Maybe a scrap now and then--nothing big, though. Or maybe one of them cuts a class at school or argues with his teacher. But there's nothing unusual, and little of anything.\" He frowned.  Malone said: \"Something's got to be wrong. What is it?\"  \"Well,\" Lynch said, \"they do seem to have a lot of money to spend.\"  Malone sat down in a chair across the desk, and leaned eagerly toward Lynch. \"Money?\" he said.  \"Money,\" Lynch said. \"New clothes. Cigarettes. Malone, three of them are even supporting their parents. Old Jose Otravez--Ramon's old man--quit his job a couple of months ago, and hasn't worked since. Spends all his time in bars, and never runs out of dough--and don't tell me you can do that on Unemployment Insurance. Or Social Security payments.\"  \"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"I won't tell you.\"  \"And there's others. All the others, in fact. Mike Fueyo's sister--dresses fit to kill, like a high-fashion model. And the Grito kid--\"  \"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"From what you tell me, this isn't just a little extra money. These kids must be rolling in the stuff. Up to their ears in dough.\"  \"Listen,\" Lynch said sadly. \"Those kids spend more than I do. They do better than that--they spend more than I _earn_.\" He looked remotely sorry for himself, but not for long. \"Every one of those kids spends like a drunken sailor, tossing his money away on all sorts of things.\"  \"Like an expense account,\" Malone said idly. Lynch looked up. \"Sorry,\" Malone said. \"I was thinking about something else.\""]]]
