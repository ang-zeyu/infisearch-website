If the compulsion was a big one, and went back far into childhood, Gloria couldn't do anything directly about it. Sometimes it was possible to work around, and, of course, you did that when you could. The important thing was society, but you salvaged the individual wherever possible.  Where it wasn't possible--  Well, here's a man who has a compulsion to get drunk. And, when drunk, he's got to pick fights. Maybe he hasn't killed anybody in a fight yet--but some day he will. He's got the strength and, under the influence of sufficient alcohol, he's got no inhibitions about using it.  None.  You can let the man live, and by doing that kill an unknown number of other people. At the least, keeping your hands and your mind off the compulsive drinker-fighter will serve to injure others--how many others, and how badly, you can't tell.  There are times when you've got to take an individual life in your hands.  And yet, because you can't always be sure--  Gloria's \"talents\" could kill out of hand, she was sure. But she didn't use them that way. Instead, she simply projected a new compulsion into the mind of her subject.  The next time he got drunk and wanted to start a fight, he wanted to do something else, too.  For instance: walk along the edges of roofs.  The original compulsion had been added to, and turned into a compulsion toward suicide; that was what it amounted to.  Gloria didn't like doing it, and she was always glad when it wasn't necessary. But there was a dark side to everything--even, she thought, helping people.  She told herself grimly that it had to be done.  And then she returned to her work.         *       *       *       *       *  Mrs. Wladek pounded on the door of the gypsy's store a few minutes before four. Her face was white and her lips set in a thin line; she breathed with difficulty and with every move she made she could feel her old bones creak.  It was a shame what was being done to an old woman.  But did they care? Did any of them care?  Mrs. Wladek gave a little snort that was half laughter and half self-pity. She pounded on the door again and dropped her arm, feeling old and tired and nearly helpless.  But she had to fight on.  There was a limit to what an old woman could be expected to stand. They would learn, all of them, what--  The door opened.  Marya Proderenska said: \"Yes? You are early.\"  \"I am in a hurry. Terrible things have occurred.\"  The gypsy woman sighed and stepped aside. \"Come in, then,\" she said, and Mrs. Wladek entered slowly, peering round the front room.  \"Come in the back,\" the gypsy woman said. \"I have been preparing to help you. But more is required.\"  It was Mrs. Wladek's turn to sigh. She reached into her purse and found a fifty-cent piece, which she handed over very slowly.  \"More is required,\" the gypsy woman said, looking at the coin in her hand as if, Mrs. Wladek thought, it was less than a penny. Did not the woman realize that fifty cents was a great deal of money for a poor old woman?  No one had any pity any more.  She handed over another fifty cents and the gypsy woman nodded sadly, pocketed the money and led the way to the back room.  \"You will help me now?\" Mrs. Wladek said.  \"I will try.\"  The room was silent as the gypsy woman brought all her knowledge and experience into play. Finally she looked at Mrs. Wladek and said: \"A very powerful curse has been put upon you. I can't help you.\"  \"The Church will help me!\" Mrs. Wladek screamed. \"They have the power to exorcise--\"  \"Do not speak to me of churches,\" the gypsy woman shouted.  Mrs. Wladek shook her head. \"You, who steal my money, who steal the bread from my old mouth without pity--\"  \"A woman must live,\" Marya Proderenska said, with great dignity.         *       *       *       *       *  The housekeeper had said Father Seador was at supper. This did not make a difference. Mrs. Wladek's problem was certainly serious enough to interfere with any man's supper. Father Seador was overweight in any case; should he miss the entire meal it would not do him any harm. Marie Wladek had a problem, and a serious one; let him miss his supper. It was his job to help people.  But Father Seador would certainly not be in the best of moods.  He was not.  He arrived with his face set in firm lines of disapproval. Mrs. Wladek got up from her chair and curtsied toward him, being very careful of her old bones. He nodded.  \"Rudi in trouble again?\" he said at once, taking a chair.  Mrs. Wladek sat herself down slowly. When she was settled, she looked over at the middle-aged man. \"Rudi has a job.\"  \"A job? A job?\" Father Seador blinked. \"That's fine. That's certainly good news.\"  \"So you think,\" Mrs. Wladek said crisply.  \"Well, of course it's good news,\" Father Seador said. \"Responsibility ... steady income ... Mrs. Wladek, I'm sure this has made you very happy, but if you'll pardon me.\" Father Seador stood up. \"I'm in the middle of--\"  \"Wait,\" Mrs. Wladek said. \"This is not what I have come to talk to you about. It is _why_ he has taken a job. It is _why_ I will be taking a job.\"  \"You?\" Father Seador seemed incapable of speech. \"Well, I--\"  \"I am bewitched,\" Mrs. Wladek said. \"A curse is upon me.\"  \"A curse? Well--\" Father Seador stopped and cleared his throat. He sat down again. He blinked. At last he said: \"What's wrong, Mrs. Wladek?\"  \"I have told you,\" she said. \"A curse. A curse. I want you to exorcise this witch that has put on me a hex.\"  \"Exorcise? Curse?\" Father Seador coughed. \"I'm sure you must be mistaken, or--\"  \"Mistaken? I am not mistaken. I tell you there is a curse upon me.\"  The parlor was very quiet for a long time. At last Father Seador said: \"If you really believe you've been hexed, you'd better give me all the details. When did you feel this ... this curse put upon you?\"  \"This morning,\" Mrs. Wladek said.  \"And what kind of curse is this? I mean, what effect has it had?\"  Mrs. Wladek's voice was as hard as iron. \"It has made my son take a job. It has made me want to look for a job. In time, I will not be able to fight the curse, and I will take a job. And then--\"  \"I don't see anything wrong about that,\" Father Seador said mildly.  \"You see nothing wrong in a poor old woman being forced to work? In a boy forced to grind out his youth among package-wrappers? You see nothing wrong in this?\"  \"Well, I ... we all have to work.\"  \"Here?\" Mrs. Wladek said with astonishment. \"Here in America, you believe that? It is not so. My own uncle Bedrich has told me years ago it is not so. Do you dispute the word of my own uncle Bedrich?\"  \"My good woman,\" said Father Seador, \"look around you ... your friends, your neighbors--\"  \"Let us say no more about it,\" Mrs. Wladek interrupted. \"There is a curse upon me and I have called on you to remove this curse.\"  \"How do you know this is a curse? Our minds do change, you know, and they do strange things--\"  \"I have been told,\" Mrs. Wladek said.  \"You've been told? By whom?\"  Mrs. Wladek drew herself up in the chair. \"By Marya Proderenska, the gypsy fortune teller. She knows that--\"  \"A gypsy? You consulted a fortune teller?\"  \"I did.\"  \"Mrs. Wladek, do you know what you are saying ... what you have done? Don't you realize you have committed a sin against--\"  But he was speaking to empty air. Marie Wladek was gone.         *       *       *       *       *  Gloria looked up at the little clock and sighed briefly. Five o'clock. Another day gone already.  It was a shame, in a way, that time passed so quickly. Gloria didn't feel the least bit tired. After all, she had spent the day in helping people, and that was what made life worthwhile.  But it was quitting time. Staying late would give her the reputation of an eager beaver, and that would make her unpopular. Not that she cared for popularity for its own sake--certainly not!--but you couldn't do your best work unless the others in your office were willing to help you.  Leaving on time was a simple sacrifice to make for them.  She pulled open the desk drawer and got her beret. Then, as she was putting it on, she remembered.  In the other drawer were the clay models.  She opened the drawer and pulled them out. She had barely reduced them to a single amorphous lump when Mr. Fredericksohn passed her desk.  \"What's that?\" he said. \"Clay?\"  \"A nephew of mine,\" Gloria said coolly. \"He likes to play with clay. I bought some and I'm taking it home.\"  \"Ah,\" Mr. Fredericksohn said. \"Of course. Good night.\"  And he was gone. Gloria put the clay back into the drawer and reached for her beret.  Harold Meedy called from across the room: \"Going home?\"  \"That's right,\" she said.  \"Can I charter a bus and drop you somewhere?\"  \"I'm afraid not,\" she said. \"I've really got to get right home.\"  \"Listen,\" Harold said. He came over to her desk. \"I've been trying to get somewhere with you ever since you walked into this office. Now, what's wrong with me? I haven't been able to get to first base. Don't you like me?\"  \"Mr. Meedy,\" Gloria began, \"it's just that ... well, I don't believe in inter-personal relations on that level, not in the office. I'm sorry.\"  He blinked. \"You really believe that, don't you?\"  \"Of course I do,\" she said.  \"But--\" He shrugged. \"O.K. O.K. I just wanted to know.\"  The door closed behind him. Gloria felt a little relieved. If matters had gone on the way they'd threatened, why, she might have had to change Harold Meedy's mind for him. Not that it would have done him any harm, but ... well, she just didn't like doing that sort of thing for purely personal reasons.  She was glad she hadn't had to tamper with him at all.  And now it was over, and she could forget about it. Humming under her breath, she put her beret on at last, and gave the stack of folders a pat to keep them absolutely neat, before she left the office.  She still felt a little sad about leaving on time, when there was so much work to be done. But tomorrow, she told herself, she would be able to get back to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24397"],["title","Hex (#5)"],["body"," people. Tomorrow--         *       *       *       *       *  Tomorrow.  Ten minutes to nine, and Gloria put her beret away, reached for the first folder--and froze.  A second later the door opened. Gloria looked up and smiled helpfully. \"Mrs. Wladek,\" she said. \"Is there anything I can do for you? This isn't your day for--\"  \"It is not my day,\" Mrs. Wladek said. She closed the door behind her. \"This, I know. But I am here. Does this mean anything to you?\"  Gloria forced her face to remain expressionless. \"Can I help you in any way?\" she said. \"Is there anything I can do?\"  \"You?\" Mrs. Wladek barked. \"You have done enough. I am not here to see you. But your supervisor, your boss--him, I will see.\"  \"My supervisor?\" Gloria looked round. \"He isn't here yet.\"  \"He will be here later?\"  \"Of course he will,\" Gloria said.  Mrs. Wladek sat down in a chair next to Gloria's desk. \"I will wait,\" she announced. \"And you should know that there is nothing you can do to me now.\" She reached into her bag and brought out a small wooden cross she had brought with her from the old country. She waved it at Gloria wildly.  \"Do anything to you? What do you mean, Mrs. Wladek?\"  \"Hah,\" Mrs. Wladek said. \"You need not pretend with me. This frightens you. No?\"  Gloria blinked. \"I'm afraid not,\" she said.  \"But ... you are trying to fool me,\" Mrs. Wladek said. \"And I will not be fooled. I wait here for your boss, your supervisor.\"  There was nothing else to do. \"All right,\" Gloria said.         *       *       *       *       *  Everybody stared, of course, but none of the other workers came over to find out why Mrs. Wladek had come in on a day that wasn't her appointment day. With Mrs. Wladek right there, asking questions just wasn't possible. Gloria tried to get some work done, but that wasn't possible either, and she resigned herself at last to sitting quietly and waiting for Mr. Fredericksohn's arrival.  She promised herself she'd make up for the loss of time by taking a shorter lunch hour, and that relieved her mind a little. But she did hope Mr. Fredericksohn would be early.  Thankfully, he was. At nine twenty-five exactly, the door opened and Mr. Fredericksohn entered. He glanced once round the office, saw Mrs. Wladek and went on. A second later he stopped.  He didn't have a chance to say anything. Mrs. Wladek was at his side. \"I must see you at once,\" she said. \"I must see you alone, at once.\"  He stared at her. \"Miss Scott here, I'm sure, can--\"  \"It is about Miss Scott that I want to talk to you,\" Mrs. Wladek hissed.  Mr. Fredericksohn glanced at Gloria. She busied herself with papers. At last he said: \"Come with me,\" and led Mrs. Wladek down the aisle into his private office. The door closed.  Ten minutes passed and the door opened. Mr. Fredericksohn's head projected. \"Miss Scott,\" he said. \"May I see you for a minute?\"  The curiosity in the office was almost a solid pressure, but Gloria paid it no attention. She said: \"Certainly,\" put away the folder she had been consulting, and went in.  There, at the side of Mr. Fredericksohn's desk, Mrs. Wladek was sitting, looking determined, grim and baffled all at once. Gloria stood in front of the desk and Mr. Fredericksohn seated himself behind it, the large open window at his back.  \"Yes, Mr. Fredericksohn?\" Gloria said.  \"I have told him all,\" Mrs. Wladek said. \"All. Everything. Total.\"  \"Er ... yes,\" Mr. Fredericksohn said. He faced Gloria resolutely. \"Mrs. Wladek has said something about a ... about a spell. Do you know what she might be talking about? Something you said, some impression you gave her--\"  \"A spell?\" Gloria shook her head. \"I can't think how she got that idea,\" she said calmly.  \"You do not fool him,\" Mrs. Wladek said. \"He knows. I have told him all.\"  \"Certainly,\" Mr. Fredericksohn murmured. \"But perhaps some little thing--\"  \"My report will be ready in an hour,\" Gloria said. \"But I'm sure there was nothing.\"  Mr. Fredericksohn coughed convulsively. \"I suppose not,\" he said. \"I realize this is rather unpleasant for you--\"  \"I quite understand,\" Gloria said.  Mrs. Wladek came out of her chair in a single movement and clutched Gloria by the left arm. \"What is happening?\" she demanded.  Mr. Fredericksohn avoided her eye. \"Please sit down,\" he said. And then, to Gloria: \"Miss Scott, if you'll make the call ... you know what I mean?\"  \"Of course,\" she said.  \"The--\" He whispered it: \"The hospital?\"  \"What did you say?\" Mrs. Wladek demanded. \"What did you tell her?\"  Gloria disengaged herself and went to the door. As she shut it behind her she could hear Mrs. Wladek's voice, rising to a crescendo of threats and abuse, and Mr. Fredericksohn's calm, scholarly attempts to stem the tide. She almost smiled.  Then she went to her own desk and picked up the telephone.  Actually, she told herself, matters had worked out for the best. Rudi had a job, and would grow into a fully functioning member of society. Mrs. Wladek would not be on the relief rolls any longer.  And what Mrs. Wladek wanted--a place to live, and someone to take care of her--would certainly be provided for her.  Yes, everything had worked out for the best. And, next time, she'd be able to handle a situation like Mrs. Wladek's with less trouble. Gloria looked into the future--into a long series of days and weeks, helping people, getting them to do what was best for them. Oh, sometimes they wouldn't like it right away, but you had to expect that. What was best for them--  Gloria smiled to herself quietly, and dialed a number.  On the second ring, a voice said: \"Bellevue Admitting.\"  \"We'd appreciate your sending an ambulance and attendants right away,\" Gloria said. \"For the psychiatric wards.\""]]]
