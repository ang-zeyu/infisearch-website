One of the glasses on the tray beside a pitcher rose, floated into the bath and, after we had both heard the water run, came back through the air and tilted to trickle a few drops of water onto her head.  Her words gave her away--she was no mystic. She swung her eyes back to me: \"TK!\" she gasped. She recoiled from me. She'd had a viper to her bosom.  \"Heal me!\" I snapped at her. \"You've had your sign, and I'm your darlin' Billy.\"  \"I got to find it,\" she said desperately. \"The weak place.\"  I flopped on the bed, stretched my arm out against the counterpane. She ran her fingers over it--the old \"laying on of hands.\" If she were the real thing, I knew what it was--perception at a level a TK can't match. The real healers feel the nerves themselves. I'd been worked on before. The more hysterical healers, some really creepy witches, had given me some signs of relief, but none could ever find the real \"weak place,\" as she called it.  She was mumbling to herself. I guess you could call it an incantation. I got a picture of a nubile waif, too freakish to fit where she'd been raised. What had her Hegira been like? In what frightful places had she found herself welcome? From her talk, it could have been an Ozark backwater. I didn't want to know what backwoods crone had taught her some mnemonic rendition of the Devil's Litany.  Her hands passed up beyond my shoulder, to my neck. \"It's in yore haid,\" she said. \"In yore darlin' haid!\" Fingers worked over my scalp. \"Oh, there!\" she gasped. \"Hit's ahurtin' me! Hurtin', hurtin', and I'm a draggin' it off'n yuh!\" Her backwoods twang sharpened as she aped some contemporary witch.  Hurt? She didn't know what it meant. She fired a charge of thermite in my head, and it seared its way down my arm to my fingers. My right arm came off the bed and thrashed like a wounded snake. She wrestled it, climbed onto the bed, and held it down with her boney knees. Her fingers kneaded it, working some imaginary devil out through the fingertips, till the hurt was gone.         *       *       *       *       *  We sat close together on the edge of the bed at last, as I worked and moved my arm, one of us more in awe of what had happened than the other. It was weak--with those flabby, unused muscles, it had to be. But I could move it, to any normal position.  \"I never done like that before,\" she breathed. \"Jest small ailin'.\"  \"You're a healer, all right,\" I said. \"And a prophetess, too, from what I saw at the dice table. You know what a Psi personality is?\" I asked her. \"Say, what is your name, anyway?\"  \"Pheola,\" she said. \"Yes, I've heard of them,\" she said.  \"You're one,\" I told her. \"You can heal many people.\"  She shook her head. \"Only could do it because I love you, Billy Joe,\" she said.  \"We'll teach you,\" I promised her. \"Would you like to learn? You've heard of the Lodge, haven't you?\"  \"Lordy!\" she gasped.  \"You're as good as in it,\" I told her. \"Now tell me, what am I going to do tomorrow morning?\"  She got up and started to pace the room, sniffling. \"Why would you do that?\" she said at length. \"You are going to the bank, first thing. You've got all that money. It's thousand dollar bills! And you're writing on them.\" She frowned at me, sniffling again. \"Do I _really_ see it?\" she asked. \"Is that right?\"  \"I'll make it right,\" I said. \"Come on,\" I told her. \"If we're going to stay up all night, we need fuel. How long since you've tackled a twenty-ounce sirloin?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Lodge has unmentioned influence. No, Psi powers aren't a secret government. But what high official can afford to be at odds with us? They know where the Lodge stands. A little while on the visor as the east pinked up got me what I wanted. Because of the three-hour time difference, the Washington brass got me _carte blanche_ before banking hours at the Tahoe bank that supplied the Sky Hi Club with its cash.  Working with the cashier, who hadn't even taken time to shave after getting his orders from the Federal Reserve Bank, I went over their stock of thousand dollar bills, as Pheola had PC'd I would, and marked down the edges of the stacks with grease pencil. Mostly I did it to make my grip firmer. When the time came, I could make that money jump.  Pheola let me get her a cocktail dress in one of the women's shops. The right dress helped, but more steaks would have helped even more. I'll bet I put five pounds on her that day. She was one hungry 'cropper. Hungry and sniffly.  We idled away the afternoon and waited until nearly midnight to go back to the Sky Hi Club. Action is about at its peak then, and if the cross-roader had been tipping dice again, as they suspected, they would have had time to notice which table wasn't making its vigorish.  Plain enough where they were having trouble. Fowler Smythe was scowling through his glasses behind a table with Barney, the dealer I'd hit with the Blackout. Their faces were sweating in the dry desert air. The table was being taken.  \"Now watch it, Pheola,\" I said, as we squeezed into the crowd, opposite the dealers. \"Almost anything can happen. I want to know the instant you get a feeling. You understand?\" She nodded and wiped at her drippy nose with a clean handkerchief. I'd gotten her a dozen.  There was the same old racket. The burnt out voice of a chanteuse, coming over the PA system from the dining room, tried to remember the sultry insouciance with which it had sung \"Eadie was a Lady\" in its youth. Waiters in dude-ranch getups swivel-hipped from table to table like wraithes through the mob of gamblers, trays of free drinks in their hands. This time Pheola didn't have the same greedy grab for the _hors d'oeuvres_. She'd wrapped herself around a couple pounds of high-quality protein before we had come to the casino.  The gamblers were urging the dice with the same old calls, and the stick-men were chanting: \"Coming out!\" \"Five's the point!\" \"And _seven_! The dice pass!\" and all the rest. The ivories had a way to go before they reached us. I gave Pheola a stack of ten-buck chips and let her bet, without making any effort to tip the dice. She still had it. She moved the chips back and forth from \"Pass\" to \"Don't Pass\" and won at every roll. I could see Fowler Smythe begin to scowl as she let her winnings ride, building up a real stack.         *       *       *       *       *  Without warning she dragged down her winnings and leaned close to me, sniffling. \"You'll get all wet!\"  I looked around, seeing a waiter near me. He had just served drinks to the rear, half of the table, to the gamblers nearest the dealers. His tray was still half-full. This was the moment. It was a generalized sort of lift, the kind of thing that qualifies a TK for the Thirty-third degree. I heaved at the thousand-dollar bills I had had marked in the morning, without the faintest idea of where they were. The tray lurched in the waiter's hand, throwing glasses to the floor. Most of them shattered when they struck the real wood planks, splashing whisky and mix on our legs.  I looked across the table and grinned at Fowler Smythe. His scowl had an awful lot of forehead to work on. \"What the devil!\" I could read his lips say over the racket. But Barney, the stick-man who'd felt my Blackout, caught on a lot quicker.  I was about to freeze him with a clamp on his thyroid. It's just as effective as wrapping your fingers around the throat. But Pheola upset the apple cart.  She grabbed my right arm, so newly powerful. \"No, Billy Joe!\" she cried. \"I _don't_ want to die!\"  \"Who's dying?\" I snapped.  \"He's shooting me!\" she gasped.  Shoot? With what? I had one terrified moment--what to lift? What was aimed at her? At the last possible moment I saw it. His crap-stick was a hollow tube, and he was raising it toward _me_, not toward Pheola. I'd heard of things like that--a gas-powered dart gun. Silent, and shooting a tiny needle with a nerve poison in grooves cut in its tip.  I lifted, but half in panic. Fowler Smythe squeezed his trigger and the tiny dart leaped unseen across the crap layout. My lift had been way off--it should have thrown the stick toward the ceiling, where no one would have been hurt. Instead it merely twitched the crap-stick, and the dart struck Pheola in the left hand. She screeched a little and grabbed at the needle-prick with her fingernails.  You never know how much power there is in Psi until you use it without restraint. I threw the crowd back away from us with a lift that nearly blacked me out, and had Pheola on the wet boards of the floor before she could blink. She had only seconds to live unless I blocked all circulation to and from her arm. I found the spots in her armpit and lifted the veins and arteries into a complete block.  A whiff of garlic told me that Simonetti had reached the table. He'd been watching on the TV monitor, of course. He knelt down beside us.  \"A doctor, quick,\" I said. \"She's been pinked with nerve poison.\"  \"She's gone, then,\" he said huskily. \"Who done it?\"  \"Fowler Smythe,\" I said bitterly. \"A snake within the Lodge. You might try to stop him. But your partner, Rose, is the real crook. Get the doc, then tie up Rose.\"  \"She's gone,\" he insisted. \"Nerve poison kills right now.\"  \"He's right, Billy Joe,\" Pheola said softly. \"I'm going numb all over.\"  \"What did I tell you?\" Simonetti husked at me. I had enough left to hit him sharply over the temples with a lift. \"A doctor. With antidote,\" I snapped. He trotted away.  \"Darlin' Billy!\" she said, and her heart stopped. She was dead. I picked her up in my arms and carried her to the same sawdust-strewn private dining room where I'd given Barney the Blackout.  I had to split the lift. The tourniquet was an absolute necessity, or more of the nerve poison would enter her system. But her heart _couldn't_ stop. The brain can only stand a few seconds of that. I hadn't let it miss three beats. Even as I carried her from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24382"],["title","Vigorish (#6)"],["body","casino, I lifted the main coronary muscle and started a ragged pumping, maybe forty beats a minute. Once in the smaller room I began artificial respiration with my mouth.  The sawbones was there in three minutes. I guided the tip of his hypodermic into a vein in her right arm, the one that still had blood coursing through it. He depressed the piston, pumping the antidote into her bloodstream. Little by little I let up on the clamp on her wounded left arm, dribbling the poisoned blood into her system, so that the antidote could react with it gradually. She stayed unconscious.  Then I felt it. Her heart muscle tugged back at my lift. It was struggling to beat on its own. I matched my lifts to its ragged impulses, feeling it steady to a normal seventy-two as the antidote took effect.  Her eyes opened at last, and we stopped respiration. \"Billy Joe!\" she smiled. She was back from the dead.         *       *       *       *       *  In an hour we had returned to the motel. She was as good as new, but badly shaken.  \"I still don't know what happened,\" she said.  I shrugged. \"Smoke screen, Pheola. Every time there's a run of luck on a crap table, somebody yells 'TK!' And I suppose there's a number of TK's who aren't in the Lodge, and who figure to make a killing here and a killing there by tipping the dice. But any decent TK, even a Fowler Smythe, can spot them.  \"There was TK in this, but not tipping dice. Smythe is a skunk. He's no Twenty-fifth, or he wouldn't have any need to go crooked. He saw a chance to make a killing. He suggested it to Rose, who fell for it and went along. Rose decided to steal Simonetti's half of the business from his partner with Smythe's help. It was no more complicated than smuggling thousand dollar bills off the table in false bottoms of trays that drinks were being served on. Smythe was using TK to lift the bills into those false bottoms, well screened by the trays from the TV monitors. Barney was in on it, of course. And after the joint had lost enough dough that way, Rose and Simonetti would have had to sell out. Only the buyer would have been a dummy for Rose and Smythe, using money Smythe had lifted off the tables.  \"The whole TK business was just a smoke screen to keep matters confused,\" I concluded.  \"How come they dared send for a TK like you? Why weren't they scared you'd catch them, just like you did?\"  \"It took a little more than TK,\" I reminded her. \"TK is just a power, one more ability in life. It doesn't make you God. Once in a while it gives you a little more vigorish than the other guy has, that's all. And sometimes it's not enough.\"  \"But you had enough vigorish to catch them,\" she pointed out.  \"In a way,\" I said. \"I told them TK wasn't enough--that it would take precognition. And I don't have PC. I had to bring a PC with me. You, Pheola. That's why I'm alive. Smythe would have killed me with that dart gun of his. _You_ were my vigorish!\"  We rode the 'copter together to the airport. Old Grand Master Maragon would sneer out of the other side of his face when I brought Pheola to him. He couldn't keep _her_ from PC training. She _had_ it.  \"Tell me,\" I asked her. \"Can you always tell what I'm going to do next?\"  \"I reckon,\" she said. \"If I think hard about it.\"  \"But you can't _control_ what I'm going to do next, can you?\" I grinned.  \"I wonder,\" she said. \"Never tried, yet.\"  \"Oh, no!\" I groaned.  She showed me her buck teeth in a smile. \"I figger first you'll have them straighten my teeth,\" she said. \"You'd like a pretty wife.\"  \"If it's got to be,\" I said weakly. \"That would help. I just wish there was some way to handle that hysterical sniffle of yours, that's all. But I guess that's the price you have to pay for that awful load of Psi power you have.\"  \"Oh, that,\" she said. \"I ought to be over that by tomorrow. I hardly ever get a cold, darlin' Billy, and when I do, I throw it off in a few days.\"  Well, I guess it's a cinch I'm no PC."]]]
