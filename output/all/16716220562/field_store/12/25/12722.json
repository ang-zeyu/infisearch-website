Isn't that a joke?”  “Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't,” retorted Chatterer, who isn't the best of friends with his cousin, Happy Jack.  “If I don't know as much about the Squirrel family as you do, may I never find another nut as long as I live.  But at that, I'm not sure I know all there is to know.  I think it would be fun to go to school for a while. What do you say, Peter, if I go along with you?”  Peter said that he thought it would be a very fine thing and that Chatterer never would regret it.  Chatterer winked at his cousin, Happy Jack, and followed Peter, only of course, Chatterer kept in the trees while Peter was on the ground.  Happy Jack hesitated a minute and then, curiosity becoming too much for him, he hastened after the others.  “Hello!” exclaimed Old Mother Nature, as Happy Jack and Chatterer appeared with Peter Rabbit.  “What are you frisky folks doing over here?”  Happy Jack and Chatterer appeared to have lost their tongues, something very unusual for them, especially for Chatterer.  The fact is, in the presence of Old Mother Nature they felt bashful. Peter replied for them.  “They've decided to come to school, too,” said he.  “Happy Jack says he knows all about his own family, but he has come along to find out if he really does.”  “It won't take us long to find out,” said Old Mother Nature softly and her eyes twinkled with amusement.  “How many cousins have you, Happy Jack?”  Happy Jack thought for a moment.  “Three,” he replied, but he didn't say it in a very positive way.  Peter chuckled to himself, for he knew that already doubt was beginning to grow in Happy Jack's mind.  “Name them,” commanded Old Mother Nature promptly.  “Chatterer the Red Squirrel, Timmy the Flying Squirrel, and Striped Chipmunk,” replied Happy Jack.  “He's forgotten Rusty the Fox Squirrel,” shouted Chatterer, dancing about gleefully.  Happy Jack looked crestfallen and gave Chatterer an angry look.  “That's right, Chatterer,” said Old Mother Nature.  “Rusty is a very important member of the Squirrel family.  Now suppose you name the others.”  “Wha--wha--what others?” stammered Chatterer.  “I don't know of any others.”  Peter Rabbit hugged himself with glee as he watched the faces of Happy Jack and Chatterer.  “They don't know any more about their family than we did about ours,” he whispered in one of the long ears of Jumper the Hare.  As for Old Mother Nature, she smiled indulgently.  “Put on your thinking-caps, you two,” said she.  “You haven't named half of them.  You are not wholly to blame for that, for some of them you never have seen, but there is one member of the Squirrel family whom both of you know very well, yet whom neither of you named. Put on your thinking-caps.”  Chatterer looked at Happy Jack, and Happy Jack looked at Chatterer, and each scratched his head.  Each wanted to be the first to think of that other cousin, for each was jealous of the other.  But though they scratched and scratched their heads, they couldn't think who that other cousin could be.  Old Mother Nature waited a few minutes before she told them.  Then, seeing that either they couldn't remember or didn't know, she said, “You didn't mention Johnny Chuck.”  “Johnny Chuck!” exclaimed Chatterer and Happy Jack together, and the look of surprise on their faces was funny to see.  For that matter, the looks on the faces of Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare were equally funny.  Old Mother Nature nodded.  “Johnny Chuck,” she repeated.  “He is a member of the Squirrel family.  He belongs to the Marmot branch, but he is a Squirrel just the same.  He is one of your cousins.”  “He's a mighty funny looking Squirrel,” said Chatterer, jerking his tail as only he can.  “That just shows your ignorance, Chatterer,” replied Old Mother Nature rather sharply.  “I'm surprised at the ignorance of you two.”  She looked first at Chatterer, than at Happy Jack.  “It is high time you came to school to me for a while.  You've got a lot to learn.  For that matter, so have Peter and Jumper.  Now which of you can tell me what order you all belong to?”  Happy Jack looked at Chatterer, Chatterer looked at Peter Rabbit, and Peter looked at Jumper the Hare.  On the face of each was such a funny, puzzled expression that Old Mother Nature almost laughed right out.  Finally Peter Rabbit found his tongue.  “If you please,”  said he, “I guess we don't know what you mean by an order.”  “I thought as much,” said Old Mother Nature.  “I thought as much. In the first place, the animals of the Great World are divided into big groups or divisions, and then these groups are divided into smaller groups, and these in turn into still smaller groups. Happy Jack and Chatterer belong to a group called the Squirrel family, and Peter and Jumper to a group called the Hare family. Both of these families and several other families belong to a bigger group called an order, and this order is the order of Gnawers, or Rodents.”  Peter Rabbit fairly jumped up in the air, he was so excited.  “Then Jumper and I must be related to Happy Jack and Chatterer,” he cried.  “In a way you are,” replied Old Mother Nature.  “It isn't a very close relationship, still you are related.  All of you are Rodents. So are all the members of the Rat and Mouse family, the Beaver family, the Porcupine family, the Pocket Gopher family, the Pika family, and the Sewellel family.”  By this time Peter's eyes looked as if they would pop right out of his head.  “This is the first time I've ever heard of some of those families,” said he.  “My, what a lot we have to learn!  Is it because all the members of all those families have teeth for gnawing that they are all sort of related?”  Old Mother Nature looked pleased.  “Peter,” said she, “I think you ought to go to the head of the class.  That is just why.  All the members of all the families I have named belong to the same order, the order of Rodents.  All the members have big, cutting, front teeth.  Animals without such teeth cannot gnaw.  Now, as you and Jumper have learned about your family, it is the turn of Happy Jack and Chatterer to learn about their family.  Theirs is rather a large family, and it is divided into three groups, the first of which consists of the true Squirrels, to which group both Happy Jack and Chatterer belong.  The second group consists of the Marmots, and Johnny Chuck belongs to this.  The third group Timmy the Flying Squirrel has all to himself.”  “Where does Striped Chipmunk come in?” asked Chatterer.  “I'm coming to that,” replied Old Mother Nature.  “The true Squirrels are divided into the Tree Squirrels, Rock Squirrels, and Ground Squirrels.  Of course Chatterer and Happy Jack are Tree Squirrels.”  “And Striped Chipmunk is a Ground Squirrel,” interrupted Peter, looking as if he felt very much pleased with his own smartness.  Old Mother Nature shook her head.  “You are wrong this time, Peter,” said she, and Peter looked as foolish as he felt.  “Striped Chipmunk is a Rock Squirrel.  Seek Seek the Spermophile who lives on the plains of the West and is often called Gopher Squirrel, is the true Ground Squirrel.  Now I can't spend any more time with you little folks this morning, because I've too much to do.  To-morrow morning I shall expect Chatterer to tell me all about Happy Jack, and Happy Jack to tell me all about Chatterer.  Now scamper along, all of you, and think over what you have learned this morning.”  So Peter and Jumper and Chatterer and Happy Jack thanked Old Mother Nature for what she had told them and scampered away.  Peter headed straight for the far corner of the Old Orchard where he was sure he would find Johnny Chuck.  He couldn't get there fast enough, for he wanted to be the first to tell Johnny Chuck that he was a Squirrel. You see he didn't believe that Johnny knew it.    CHAPTER V  The Squirrels of the Trees  Peter Rabbit found Johnny Chuck sitting on his doorstep, sunning himself.  Peter was quite out of breath because he had hurried so. “Do you know that you are a Squirrel, Johnny Chuck?” he panted.  Johnny slowly turned his head and looked at Peter as if he thought Peter had suddenly gone crazy.  “What are you talking about, Peter Rabbit?  I'm not a Squirrel; I'm a Woodchuck,” he replied.  “Just the same, you are a Squirrel,” retorted Peter.  “The Woodchucks belong to the Squirrel family.  Old Mother Nature says so, and if she says so, it is so.  You'd better join our school, Johnny Chuck, and learn a little about your own relatives.”  Johnny Chuck blinked his eyes and for a minute or two couldn't find a word to say.  He knew that if Peter were telling the truth as to what Old Mother Nature had said, it must be true that he was member of the Squirrel family.  But it was hard to believe.  “What is this school?” he finally asked.  Peter hastened to tell him.  He told Johnny all about what he and Jumper the Hare had learned about their family, and all the surprising things Old Mother Nature had told them about the Squirrel family, and he ended by again urging Johnny Chuck to join the school and promised to call for Johnny the next morning.  But Johnny Chuck is lazy and does not like to go far from his own doorstep, so when Peter called the next morning Johnny refused to go, despite all Peter could say.  Peter didn't waste much time arguing for he was afraid he would be late and miss something. When he reached the Green Forest he found his cousin, Jumper the Hare, and Chatterer the Red Squirrel, and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, already there.  As soon as Peter arrived Old Mother Nature began the morning lesson.  “Happy Jack,” said she, “you may tell us all you know about your cousin, Chatterer."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2441"],["title","The Burgess Animal Book for Children (#5)"],["body","”  “To begin with, he is the smallest of the Tree Squirrels,” said Happy Jack.  “He isn't so very much bigger than Striped Chipmunk, and that means that he is less than half as big as myself.  His coat is red and his waistcoat white; his tail is about two-thirds as long as his body and flat but not very broad.  Personally, I don't think it is much of a tail.”  At once Chatterer's quick temper flared up and he began to scold. But Old Mother Nature silenced him and told Happy Jack to go on. “He spends more of his time in the trees than I do,” continued Happy Jack, “and is especially fond of pine trees and other cone-bearing trees.  He likes the deeper parts of the Green Forest better than I do, though he seems to feel just as much at home on the edge of the Green Forest, especially if it is near a farm where he can steal corn.”  Chatterer started to scold again but was silenced once more by Old Mother Nature.  “I have to admit that Chatterer is thrifty,”  continued Happy Jack, quite as if he hadn't been interrupted. “He is very fond of the seeds of cone-bearing trees.  He cuts the cones from the trees just before they are ripe.  Then they ripen and open on the ground, where he can get at the seeds easily.  He often has a number of store-houses and stores up cone seeds, acorns, nuts, and corn when he can get it.  He builds a nest of leaves and strips of bark, sometimes in a hollow tree and sometimes high up in the branches of an evergreen tree.  He is a good jumper and jumps from tree to tree.  He is a busybody and always poking his nose in where he has no business.  He steals my stores whenever he can find them.”  “You do the same thing to me when you have the chance, which isn't often,” sputtered Chatterer.  Happy Jack turned his back to Chatterer and continued, “He doesn't seem to mind cold weather at all, as long as the sun shines.  His noisy tongue is to be heard on the coldest days of winter.  He is the sauciest, most impudent fellow of the Green Forest, and never so happy as when he is making trouble for others.  He sauces and scolds everybody he meets, and every time he opens his mouth he jerks his tail.  He's quarrelsome.  Worse than that, in the spring when the birds are nesting, he turns robber.  He goes hunting for nests and steals the eggs, and what is even more dreadful, he kills and eats the baby birds.  All the birds hate him, and I don't blame them.”  Chatterer could contain himself no longer.  His tongue fairly flew and he jerked his tail so hard and so fast that Peter Rabbit almost expected to see him break it right off.  He called Happy Jack names, all the bad names he could think of, and worked himself up into such a rage that it was some time before Old Mother Nature could quiet him.  When at last he stopped from sheer lack of breath, Old Mother Nature spoke, and her voice was very severe.  “I'm ashamed of you, Chatterer,” said she.  “Unfortunately, what Happy Jack has said about you is true.  In  many ways you are a disgrace to the Green Forest.  Still I don't know how the Green Forest could get along without you.  Happy Jack forgot to mention that you eat some insects at times.  He also forgot to mention that sometimes you have a storehouse down in the ground.  Now tell us what you know about your cousin, Happy Jack.”  For a few minutes Chatterer sulked, but he did not dare disobey Old Mother Nature.  “I don't know much good about him,” he mumbled.  “And you don't know much bad about me either,” retorted Happy Jack sharply.  Old Mother Nature held up a warning hand.  “That will do,” said she.  “Now, Chatterer, go on.”  “Happy Jack is more than twice as big as I, but at that, I'm not afraid of him,” said Chatterer and glared at Happy Jack.  “He is gray all over, except underneath, where he is white.  He has a tremendously big tail and is so proud of it he shows it off whenever he has a chance.  When he sits up he has a way of folding his hands on his breast.  I don't know what he does it for unless it is to keep them warm in cold weather.  He builds a nest very much like mine.  Sometimes it is in a hollow tree, but quite as often it is in the branches of a tree.  He is a good traveler in the tree-tops, but he spends a good deal of his time on the ground.  He likes open woodland best, especially where there are many nut trees.  He has a storehouse where he stores up nuts for winter, but he buries in the ground and under the leaves more than he puts in his storehouse.  In winter, when he is hungry, he hunts for those buried nuts, and somehow he manages to find them even when they are covered with snow.  When he comes to stealing he is not better than I am.  I have seen him steal birds' eggs, and I wouldn't trust him unwatched around one of my storehouses.”  It was Happy Jacks' turn to become indignant.  “I may have taken a few eggs when I accidentally ran across them,” said he, “but I never go looking for them, and I don't take them unless I am very hungry and can't find anything else.  I don't make a business of robbing birds the way you do, and you know it.  If I find one of your storehouses and help myself, I am only getting back what you have stolen from me.  Everybody loves me and that is more than you can say.”  “That's enough,” declared Old Mother Nature, and her voice was very sharp.  “You two cousins never have agreed and I am afraid never will. As long as you are neighbors, I suspect you will quarrel.  Have you told us all you know about Happy Jack, Chatterer?”  Chatterer nodded.  He was still mumbling to himself angrily and wasn't polite enough to make a reply.  Old Mother Nature took no notice of this.  “What you have told us is good as far as it goes,”  said she.  “You said that Happy Jack is all gray excepting underneath.  Usually the Gray Squirrel is just as Chatterer has described him, but sometimes a Gray Squirrel isn't gray at all, but all black.”  Peter Rabbit's ears stood straight up with astonishment.  “How can a Gray Squirrel be black?” he demanded.  Old Mother Nature smiled.  “That is a fair question, Peter,” said she.  “Gray Squirrel is simply the name of Happy Jack's family. Sometimes some of the babies are born with black coats instead of gray coats.  Of course they are just the same kind of Squirrel, only they look different.  In some parts of the country there are numbers of these black-coated Squirrels and many think they are a different kind of Squirrel.  They are not.  They are simply black-coated members of Happy Jack's family.  Just remember this. It is the same way in the family of Rusty the Fox Squirrel.  Some members are rusty red, some are a mixture of red and gray, and some are as gray as Happy Jack himself.  Way down in the Sunny South Fox Squirrels always have white noses and ears.  In the North they never have white noses and ears.  Rusty the Fox Squirrel is just a little bigger than Happy Jack and has just such a handsome tail.  He is the strongest and heaviest of the Tree Squirrels and not nearly as quick and graceful as Happy Jack.  Sometimes Rusty has two nests in the same tree, one in a hollow in a tree for bad weather and the other made of sticks and leaves outside in the branches for use in good weather.  Rusty's habits are very much the same as those of Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, and therefore he likes the same kind of surroundings.  Like his cousin, Happy Jack, Rusty is a great help to me.”  Seeing how surprised everybody looked, Mother Nature explained. “Both Happy Jack and Rusty bury a great many more nuts than they ever need,” said she, “and those they do not dig up sprout in the spring and grow. In that way they plant ever so many trees without knowing it.  Just remember that, Chatterer, the next time you are tempted to quarrel with your cousin, Happy Jack.  Very likely Happy Jack's great-great-ever-so-great grandfather planted the very tree you get your fattest and best hickory nuts from.  “Way out in the mountains of the Far West you have a cousin called the Douglas Squirrel, who is really a true Red Squirrel and whose habits are very much like your own.  Some folks call him the Pine Squirrel.  By the way, Chatterer, Happy Jack forgot to say that you are a good swimmer.  Perhaps he didn't know it.”  By the expression of Happy Jack's face it was quite clear that he didn't know it.  “Certainly I can swim,” said Chatterer.  “I don't mind the water at all.  I can swim a long distance if I have to.”  This was quite as much news to Peter Rabbit as had been the fact that a cousin of his own was a good swimmer, and he began to feel something very like respect for Chatterer.  “Are there any other Tree Squirrels?” asked Jumper the Hare.  “Yes,” replied Old Mother Nature, “there are two--the handsomest of all the family.  They live out in the Southwest, in one of the most wonderful places in all this great land, a place called the Grand Canyon.  One is called the Abert Squirrel and the other the Kaibab Squirrel.  They are about the size of Happy Jack and Rusty but have broader, handsomer tails and their ears have long tufts of hair.  The Abert Squirrel has black ears, a brown back, gray sides and white underneath.  Kaibab has brown ears with black tips, and his tail is mostly white.  Both are very lovely, but their families are small and so they are little known.”  With this, Old Mother Nature dismissed school for the day.    CHAPTER VI  Striped Chipmunk and his Cousins  Of course there couldn't be a school in the Green Forest without news of it spreading very fast.  News travels quickly through the Green Forest and over the Green Meadows, for the little people who live there are great gossips.  So it was not surprising that Striped Chipmunk heard all about Old Mother Nature's school.  The next morning, just as the daily lesson was beginning, Striped Chipmunk came hurrying up, quite our of breath.  “Well, well!  See who's here!” exclaimed Old Mother Nature.  “What have you come for, Striped Chipmunk?”  “I've come to try to learn.  Will you let "]]]
