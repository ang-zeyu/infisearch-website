You see there are no bridges below this, though there are a great many above.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo; \"and how do they get across the river below here? Are there ferry boats?\"  \"I think it likely there are ferry boats down below,\" said Mr. George. \"At any rate, there are plenty of small boats which any body can hire. They are rowed by men called watermen.      \"'Bound 'prentice to a waterman,     I learned a bit to row.'\"  \"What poetry is that?\" said Rollo.  \"It is part of some old song,\" said Mr. George. \"Look down the river and you can see these boats cruising about among the shipping.\"  \"Is that the way they get across the river below here?\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George; \"and then there is the Tunnel besides. They can go _under_ the river through the Tunnel if they please, about a mile and a half below here.\"  \"Is that the reason why they made the Tunnel,\" said Rollo, \"because they could not have any bridge?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"It would have been a great deal cheaper and better to have made a bridge; but a bridge would have interfered with the shipping, and so they made a tunnel underneath.\"  \"I never knew before,\" said Rollo, \"why they made the Tunnel.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"that is the reason. It was a very difficult and expensive work; but I believe it proved a failure. Very few people use it for crossing the river, though a great many go to see it. It is a curious place to see. But now let us go across the bridge and see what is on the other side.\"  Mr. George and Rollo had to stand several minutes on the curbstone of the sidewalk before they could find openings, in the trains of vehicles which were moving to and fro over the bridge, wide enough to allow them, to pass through to the other side. At length, however, they succeeded in getting across; and, after walking along on the upper side of the bridge for some distance farther, until they had nearly reached the London end of it, they stopped and looked over the parapet down to the water.  Of course their faces were now turned _up_ the river, and the view which presented itself was entirely different from that which had been seen below. Immediately beneath where they were standing, and close in to the shore of the river, they witnessed a most extraordinary spectacle, which was formed by a group of small and smoky-looking steamers, that were hovering in apparent confusion about a platform landing there. The decks of the steamers were all crowded with passengers. Some of the boats were just coming to the land, some just leaving it, and others were moored to the platform, and streams of passengers were embarking or disembarking from them. The landing consisted of a floating platform, that was built over great flat-bottomed boats, that were moored at a little distance from the bank, so as to rise and fall with the tide. There was a strong railing along the outer edge of the platform, with openings here and there through it for passage ways to the boats. Behind, the platforms were connected with the shore by long bridges, having a little toll house at the outer end of each of them, with the words, \"PAY HERE,\" inscribed on a sign over the window. The passengers, as they came down from the shore, stopped at these toll houses to pay the fare for the places to which they wished to go. The decks of the steamers, the platforms, and all the bridges were thronged with people, going and coming in all directions, and crowding their way to and from the boats; and every two or three minutes a steamer, having received its load, would push off from the platform, and paddle its way swiftly up the river among a multitude of others that were shooting swiftly along, in all directions, over the water.  The volumes of dense, black smoke which rolled up from the funnels of the steamers made the atmosphere very thick and murky; and the whole scene, as Mr. George and Rollo looked down upon it from the parapet above, for a time seemed almost to bewilder them.  \"Let us go down and take a sail in one of those steamers,\" said Mr. George.  \"Where do they go to?\" said Rollo.  \"I don't know,\" said Mr. George.  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"let us go.\"  So saying, Mr. George and Rollo walked on towards the end of the bridge. Here they found a broad stone staircase, which turned off from the great thoroughfare, at a place near the corner of a large stone building. The staircase was very broad and massive, and was covered with people going up and coming down.  \"This must be a way down to the landing,\" said Mr. George.  So our two travellers began to descend; and, after turning several square corners in the staircase, they came out into the street which led along the margin of the river, at a level of twenty or thirty feet below the bridge. This street passed through under one of the _dry arches_ of the bridge, as they are called; that is, one built on the sloping margin of the shore, where no water flows. They passed across this street, and then entered a broad passage way which led down towards the floating platforms. There were a great many people coming and going. They stopped at the toll house on one of the little bridges to pay the fare.  \"How much is to pay?\" said Mr. George to the tollman, taking out his purse.  \"Where do you wish to go?\" said the tollman.  \"I don't know,\" said Mr. George, looking at Rollo; \"about a mile or two up the river.\"  \"To Hungerford landing?\" asked the tollman.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George.  \"Or Westminster?\" said the tollman.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"we will go to Westminster.\"  \"Twopence each,\" said the tollman.  So Mr. George and Rollo each laid down two pennies on the little counter in the window sill, and the man giving them each a little paper ticket, they passed on.  \"Now the question is,\" said Mr. George, \"how to find out what boat we are to get into. Here is an orange woman on the platform; I will buy a couple of oranges of her, one for you and one for me, and then she will be glad to tell us which is the boat.\"  \"She will tell us without,\" said Rollo.  \"As a matter of favor?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Yes,\" said Rollo.  \"I suppose she would,\" said Mr. George; \"but I would rather that the obligation should be the other way.\"  So Mr. George bought two oranges of the woman, and paid her a halfpenny over and above the price of them. She seemed very grateful for this kindness, and took great interest in showing him which of the boats he and Rollo must take to go to Westminster.  \"There's one thing that I particularly wish to go and see,\" said Rollo, \"while we are in London.\"  \"What is that?\" asked Mr. George.  \"One of the ragged schools,\" said Rollo.  \"What are they?\" asked Mr. George.  [Illustration: THE FIRST RAGGED SCHOOL.]  \"Why, they are schools for poor boys,\" replied Rollo. \"I believe the boys that go to the schools are pretty much all ragged. These schools were begun by a cobbler. I read about it in a book. The cobbler used to call the ragged boys in that lived about his shop, and teach them. Afterwards other people established such schools; and now there are a great many of them, and some of them are very large.\"  \"We'll go and see some of them,\" said Mr. George. \"I should like to go and see them very much.\"  So saying Mr. George led the way to the boat that the orange woman had pointed out as the one for Westminster; and they stepped on board, together with a little crowd of other passengers who were going up the river like themselves.     CHAPTER III.  THE RIVER.   Mr. George and Rollo fell into the line of people that were pressing forward over the plank which led to the boat that the orange woman had directed them to embark in; and they soon found themselves on board. The boat was small and quite narrow. There was no saloon or enclosed apartment of any kind for the passengers, nor even an awning to shelter them from the sun or rain. There were, however, substantial settees placed around the deck, some forward and others aft. Some of these settees were on the sides of the steamer, by the railing, and there were others placed back to back in the middle. There were not seats enough for all the passengers; and thus many were obliged to stand.  As the boat glided along swiftly over the water, Rollo gazed with wonder and interest at the various objects and scenes which presented themselves to view around him. The rows of dingy-looking warehouses dimly seen through the smoke along the shores of the river; the ranges of barges, lighters, and wherries lying at the margin of the water below; the bridges, stretching through the murky atmosphere across the stream, with throngs of people upon them passing incessantly to and fro; the little steamers, long and slender, and blackened by smoke, shooting swiftly in every direction over the surface of the water; and the spires and domes of the city seen on every hand beyond the nearer buildings,--attracted by turns the attention of our travellers, and excited their wonder.  In a very few minutes, however, after the boat had left its first station, she seemed to be approaching another landing-place, and Rollo was very much amused to observe how the steamer was manoeuvred in coming up to the landing and making fast there. The pilot who had the command of her stood upon the wheel house on one side, and gave his orders by means of little gestures which he made with his fingers and hand. The helmsman, who stood at the wheel in the stern, watched these gestures, and regulated his steering by such of them as were meant for him. There were other gestures, however, which were meant for the engineer, who had charge of the engine. This engineer, however, could not see the gestures of the pilot, for he was down among the machinery, beneath the deck; and so there was a boy stationed on the deck, near an opening which led down to where the engineer was standing; and this boy interpreted the gestures as the pilot made them, calling "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24182"],["title","Rollo in London (#4)"],["body","to the engineer the import of them with a very curious drawling intonation, which amused Rollo very much. Thus, when the steamer approached the land, the boy, watching the fingers of the pilot, called out, with intervals of a few seconds between each order, in a loud voice to the engineer below, as follows:----  \"EASE--ER-R-R!\"  Then, after two or three seconds,----  \"STOP--ER-R-R!\"  Then again,----  \"BACK--ER-R-R!\"  The engineer obeyed all these orders in succession as they were thus announced to him; and the steamer was brought up very safely to the landing, although the person who controlled her motions could not see at all where he was going.  When the steamer was thus, at length, moored to the landing, a number of the passengers stepped off, and a great many others got on; and, immediately afterwards, the cables were cast off, and the boy called out,----  \"START--ER-R-R!\"  The steamer then began to glide away from the landing again, and was soon swiftly shooting over the water towards one of the arches of the next bridge up the stream.  \"Now,\" said Rollo, \"how are they going to get this tall smokepipe through that bridge?\"  \"You will see,\" said Mr. George.  Rollo looked up to the top of the smokepipe, which seemed to be considerably higher than the crown of the arch that the steamer was approaching. How it could possibly pass was a mystery. The mystery was, however, soon solved; for, at the instant that the bows of the steamer entered under the arch, two men, taking hold of levers below, turned the whole smokepipe back, by means of a hinge joint that had been made in it, not far from the deck. The hinge was in the back side of the smokepipe, and of course in bending the pipe back there was an opening made in front; and through this opening the smoke, while the steamer was passing through the bridge, came out in dense volumes. As soon, however, as the arch was cleared, the pipe was brought back into its place again by the force of great weights placed at the ends of the levers as a counterpoise. Thus the opening below was closed, and the smoke came out of the top of the pipe as before.  [Illustration: SHOOTING THE BRIDGE.]  As soon as the boat had passed the bridge, Rollo, looking forward, saw another landing at a short distance in advance of them.  \"Here comes another landing,\" said Rollo. \"Is this the Westminster landing, do you think?\"  \"No,\" said Mr. George.  \"How do you know?\" asked Rollo.  \"We have not come far enough yet for the Westminster landing,\" said Mr. George.  \"How shall you know when we get there?\" asked Rollo.  \"I shall inquire,\" said Mr. George. \"Besides, the Westminster landing must be at Westminster Bridge, and Westminster Bridge is above Hungerford Bridge; and I shall know Hungerford Bridge when I see it, for it is an iron suspension bridge, without arches. It is straight and slender, being supported from above by monstrous chains; and it is very narrow, being only intended for foot passengers.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"I will look out for it.\"  \"I meant to have asked you,\" said Mr. George, \"while we were on London Bridge, whether it would be best for us to take lodgings in the city or at the West End. Which do you think?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Rollo. \"Which do you think would be best?\"  \"It is more _genteel_ to be at the West End,\" said Mr. George.  \"I don't care any thing about that,\" said Rollo.  \"Nor do I much,\" said Mr. George.  \"I want to go,\" said Rollo, \"where we can have the best time.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George.  \"And see the most to amuse us,\" said Rollo.  \"I think,\" said Mr. George, \"on the whole, that the West End will be the best for us. There are a few great things in the city to be seen; but the every-day walks, and little excursions, and street sights are altogether more interesting at the West End. So we had better take our lodgings there, and go to the city when we wish to by the omnibuses that go down the Strand.\"  \"Or by these boats on the river,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"or by these boats.\"  Not long after this, the steamboat came to Hungerford Bridge. Rollo knew the bridge at once, as soon as it came into view, it was of so light and slender a construction. Instead of being supported, like the other bridges, upon arches built up from below, it was suspended from immense chains that were stretched across the river above. The ends of these chains passed over the tops of lofty piers, which were built for the purpose of supporting them, one on each side, near the shore. The steamer glided swiftly under this bridge, and immediately afterwards the Westminster Bridge came into view.  \"Now,\" said Rollo, \"we are coming to our landing.\"  When the steamer at length made the landing, Rollo and Mr. George got out and went up to the shore. They came out in a street called Bridge Street, which led them up to another street called Whitehall.  \"Whitehall,\" said Mr. George, reading the name on the corner. \"This must be the street where King Charles I. was beheaded. Let me stop and see.\"  So Mr. George stopped on the sidewalk, and, taking a little London guide book out of his pocket, he looked at the index to find Whitehall. Then he turned to the part of the book referred to, and there he found a long statement in respect to King Charles's execution, which ended by saying, \"There cannot be a doubt, therefore, that he was executed in front of the building which stands opposite the Horse Guards.\"  \"I'll inquire where the Horse Guards is,\" said Mr. George.  \"Where the horse guards _are_,\" said Rollo, correcting what he supposed must be an error in his uncle's grammar.  \"No,\" rejoined Mr. George, \"The Horse Guards is the name of a building.\"  \"Then this must be it,\" said Rollo, pointing to a building not far before them; \"for here are two horse guards standing sentry at the doors of it.\"  Mr. George looked and saw a very splendid edifice, having a fine architectural front that extended for a considerable distance along the street, though a little way back from it. There was a great gateway in the centre; and near the two ends of the building there were two porches on the street, with a splendidly-dressed horseman, completely armed, and mounted on an elegant black charger, in each of them. The horse of each of these sentries was caparisoned with the most magnificent military trappings; and, as the horseman sat silent and motionless in the saddle, with his sword by his side, his pistols at the holster, and his bright steel helmet, surmounted with a white plume, on his head, Rollo thought that he was the finest-looking soldier he had ever seen.  \"I should like to see a whole troop of such soldiers as that,\" said he.  \"That building must be the Horse Guards,\" said Mr. George; \"but I will be sure. I will ask this policeman.\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE POLICEMAN.   The policeman was a very well-dressed and gentlemanly-looking personage. He was standing, at the time when Mr. George saw him, on the edge of the sidewalk, looking at some beggar boys, who had brooms in their hands, as if they were going to sweep the crossings. The boys, however, when they saw that the policeman was looking at them, seemed alarmed, and one calling to the other, said, \"Joey!\" and then they both ran away round a corner.  Mr. George advanced to the policeman, and asked him if that building was the Horse Guards. The policeman listened to and answered his question in a very polite and gentlemanly manner. Mr. George made several additional inquiries in respect to the building, and received in reply to them a great deal of useful information. Rollo stood by all the while, listening to the conversation, and observing with the greatest interest the details of the uniform which the policeman wore. He was dressed, Rollo saw, in a suit of dark blue, which fitted his form very nicely. The coat had a standing collar, and was buttoned snugly up to the chin with bright buttons. On the collar was worked the letter and number, A 335, in white braid, which denoted the division that this officer belonged to, and his number in the division. The hat was peculiar, too, being glazed at the top and at the brim, and having an appearance as if covered with cloth at the sides. The figure of the policeman was very erect, and his air and bearing very gentlemanly, and he answered all Mr. George's inquiries in the most affable manner.  Every part of London is provided with policemen of this character, whose business it is to preserve order in the streets, to arrest criminals, to take care of lost children, to guide strangers, and to answer any inquiries that any person may wish to make in respect to the streets, squares, public buildings, and other objects of interest in the metropolis. The whole number of these policemen is very great, there being near six thousand of them in all. They are all young and active men; and in order that they may perform their duties in an efficient manner, they are clothed with a great deal of authority; but they exercise their power with so much gentleness and discretion that they are universal favorites with all the people who traverse the streets, except, perhaps, the beggar boys and vagabonds. _They_ stand in perpetual awe of them.  Each policeman has his own district, which is called his _beat_; and he walks to and fro in this beat all the time while he is on duty. There is a station near this beat, to which he takes any delinquents or criminals that he may have occasion to arrest, in order that they may be examined, and, if found guilty, sent to prison.  One day Rollo saw a policeman taking a prisoner to the station. It was a boy about thirteen years old. The policeman walked very fast, and the boy ran along by his side. The policeman took hold of the collar of the boy's jacket behind with his hand, and so conducted him along. There was a crowd of young men and boys following, some walking fast and some running, to see what would become of the prisoner.  Rollo was at first inclined to join this party, "]]]
