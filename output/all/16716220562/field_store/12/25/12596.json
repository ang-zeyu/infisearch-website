But Achang is a pilot for these rivers. Isn't that so, Captain Bakir?\"  \"I have been up and down all the rivers in this part of the island, though I was not shipped as a pilot then,\" replied Achang, who had been the captain of a dhow, and on board the ship he had been called by his first name or the other with the title.  \"All right; we shall use you for pilot or interpreter as occasion may require; and I suppose you can tell us all we want to know about the country and the people,\" added the captain.  Clinch, one of the ablest seamen on board, was steering the launch, and Scott kept the run of the courses; but as long as the craft had three feet of water under her, she was all right. The conversation took place in the cabin, as the explorers called the after part of the steamer, though no such apartment had been built there.  A frame constructed of brass rods, properly braced, extended the entire length of the launch. A stanchion at the bow and another at the stern, with five on each side set in the rail, supported a rod the whole distance around the craft. Another extended from the bow to the stern stanchion, directly over the keel, about six inches higher than those at the sides. Ten rods led from the central down to the side rods, like the rafters of a house.  Over the whole, of this structure above was extended a single piece of painted canvas, serving as a roof, and keeping out both sun and rain. It was laced very taut to the rods, and had slope enough to make the water run off. On the sides were curtains, which could be hauled down tight. The launch had been used by the rajah on the Ganges, and when closed in the interior was like \"a bug in a rug.\"  Thus closed in, the standing-room was called the cabin. It was surrounded by wide cushioned seats, which made very good beds at night. Between these divans was a table where the meals of the explorers were to be served. Under the seats were many lockers for all sorts of articles, the bedding, and the arms and ammunition.  Just forward of the cabin were the engine and boiler, with bunkers on each side for the coal. In the middle of the craft was abundant space. The forward part of the boat was provided with cushioned divans, where passengers could sit by day or sleep at night; and this space was appropriated to the sailors. In the centre of it was the wheel. Next to it was the galley, with a stove large enough to cook for a dozen persons, and all needed utensils.  The ship's company had looked the craft over with great interest, and all of them were well pleased with the arrangements. The launch had been put into the water and fitted up for use the day before. The party from both ships had visited her, and almost wished they were to go to the interior of the country in her.  The Blanchita continued on her course up the river. Pitts was at work in the galley; and as soon as the launch was made fast off the \"go-down,\" or business building of the town, dinner was served to the seamen, and later to the denizens of the cabin. The afternoon was spent in examining the place, and in obtaining such supplies as were needed; for the boat was to sail on her voyage up the river early the next morning.  With the assistance of Achang, a small sampan, a kind of skiff, was purchased; for the Bornean declared that it would be needed in the hunting excursions of the party, for much of the country was flooded with water, a foot or two in depth.      CHAPTER II  A VOYAGE UP THE SARAWAK RIVER   The young hunters slept on board of the Blanchita, and they were delighted with their accommodations. Sarawak, or Kuching, the native name of the town, is only about one hundred and fifty miles north of the equator, and must therefore be a very warm region, though away from the low land near the sea-coast it is fairly healthy. The party slept with the curtains raised, which left them practically in the open air.  Achang had given them a hint on board of the ship that mosquitoes were abundant in some localities in Borneo. The Guardian-Mother was provided with the material, and the ladies had made a dozen mosquito bars for the explorers. They were canopies, terminating in a point at the top, where they were suspended to the cross rods on which the canvas roof was supported. The netting was tucked in under the cushions of the divan, and the sleepers were perfectly protected.  Captain Scott had carried out his plan in regard to the watches. The cook was exempted from all duty in working the little steamer; but each of the other seamen was required to keep a half-watch of two hours during the first night on board. Clinch was on watch at four in the morning. He called the engineer at this hour, and Felipe proceeded at once to get up steam. It was still dark, for the sun rises and sets at six o'clock on the equator.  As soon as there was a movement on board, all hands turned out forward. There were no decks to wash down; and, if there had been, the water was hardly fit, in the judgment of the mate, for this purpose, for it was murky, and looked as though it was muddy; but it was not so bad as it appeared, for the dark color was caused by vegetable matter from the jungles and forest, and not from the mud, which remained at the bottom of the stream.  \"The top uv the marnin' to ye's!\" shouted Felix, as he leaped from his bed about five o'clock,--for all hands had turned in about eight o'clock in the evening, as the mosquitoes, attracted by the lanterns, began to be very troublesome,--and the Milesian could sleep no longer.  \"What's the matter with you, Flix?\" demanded the captain.  \"Sure, if ye's mane to git under way afore night, it's toime to turn out,\" replied Felix. \"Don't ye's hear the schtaym sizzlin' in the froy'n pan?\"  \"But it isn't light yet,\" protested Scott.  \"Bekase the lanthern in the cab'n bloinds your two oyes, and makes the darkness shoine broighter nor the loight,\" said Felix, as he looked at his watch. \"Sure, it's tin minutes afther foive in the marnin'. These beds are altogidther too foine, Captain.\"  \"How's that, Flix?\" asked Scott, as he opened the netting and leaped out of bed.  \"They're too comfor-_ta_-ble, bad 'cess to 'em, and a b'y cud slape till sundown in 'em till the broke o' noight.\"  \"Dry up, Flix, or else speak English,\" called Louis, as he left his bed. \"There is no end of 'paddies' along this river, and I'm sure they cannot understand your lingo.\"  \"Is it paddies in this haythen oisland?\" demanded Felix, suspending the operation of dressing himself, and staring at his fellow deck-hand. \"I don't belayve a wurrud of ut!\"  \"Are there no paddies up this river, Achang?\" said Louis, appealing to the Bornean.  \"Plenty of paddies on all the streams about here,\" replied the native.  \"And they can't oondershtand Kilkenny Greek! They're moighty quare paddies, thin.\"  \"They are; and I am very sure they won't answer you when you speak to them with that brogue,\" added Louis.  \"We will let that discussion rest till we come to the paddies,\" interposed the captain, as he completed his toilet, and left the cabin.  By this time all the party had left their beds and dressed themselves; for their toilet was not at all elaborate, consisting mainly of a woollen shirt, a pair of trousers, and a pair of heavy shoes, without socks. Felipe had steam enough on to move the boat; and the seamen had wiped the moisture from all the wood and brass work, and had put everything in good order.  \"Are you a pilot for this river, Achang?\" asked Scott, as the party came together in the waist, the space forward of the engine.  \"I am; but there is not much piloting to be done, for all you have to do is to keep in the middle of the stream,\" replied the Bornean. \"I went up and down all the rivers of Sarawak in a sampan with an English gentleman who was crocodiles, monkeys, mias, snakes, and birds picking up.\"  \"Wrong!\" exclaimed Morris. \"You know better than that, Achang.\"  The native repeated the reply, putting the verb where it ought to be.  \"He was a naturalist,\" added Louis.  \"Yes; that was what they called him in the town.\"  \"I think we all know the animals of which you speak, Achang, except one,\" said Louis. \"I never heard of a mias.\"  \"That is what Borneo people call the orang-outang,\" replied the native.  \"Orang means a man, and outang a jungle, and the whole of it is a jungle man,\" Louis explained, for the benefit of his companions; for he was better read in natural history than any of them, as he had read all the books on that subject in the library of the ship. \"In Professor Hornaday's book, 'Two Years in the Jungle,' which was exceedingly interesting to me, he calls this animal the 'orang-utan,' which is only another way of spelling the second word.\"  \"Excuse me, Louis, but I think we will get under way, and hear your explanations at another time,\" interposed Captain Scott.  \"I have finished all I had to say.\"  \"Take the wheel, Achang,\" continued the captain.  The sampan was sent ashore to cast off the fasts. The river at the town is over four hundred feet wide, and deep enough in almost any part for the Blanchita. As soon as the lines were hauled in, the captain rang one bell, and Felipe started the engine. The helmsman headed the boat for the middle of the stream, and the captain rang the speed-bell. When hurried, the Blanchita was good for ten knots an hour, but her ordinary speed was eight.  On the side of the river opposite Kuching, or Sarawak, was the kampon of the Malays and other natives; and the term means a division or district of a town. Many of the natives of this village had visited the Blanchita,--some for trade, some for employment, and some from mere curiosity. None of them were allowed to go on board of the launch; for, while the Dyaks are remarkably honest people, the Malays and Chinese will steal without any very heavy temptation."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24252"],["title","Four Young Explorers; Or, Sight-Seeing in the Tropics (#3)"],["body","headed the boat up the river. For five miles the banks were low, with no signs of cultivation, and bordered with mangroves. At this point the captain called Lane to the wheel, with orders to keep in the middle of the river. The \"Big Four\" had taken possession of the bow divans, the better to see the shores. They were more elevated, which simply means higher above the water.  \"When shall we come across the paddies, Achang?\" asked Felix; \"for I am very anxious to meet them, and maybe we shall have a Kilkenny fight with them.\"  \"No, you won't, for you speak English,\" replied Louis.  \"The paddies are here on both sides of the river,\" added Achang.  \"I don't see a man of any sort, not even a Hottentot, and I am sure there is not a Paddy in sight.\"  \"Your education has been neglected, Flix, and you did not read all the books in the ship's library,\" said Louis. \"I only told you the paddies would not answer you if you spoke to them with a brogue. You can try them now if you wish.\"  \"But I don't see a single Paddy to try it on.\"  \"Here is one on your left.\"  \"I don't see anything but a field of rice.\"  \"That's a paddy in this island.\"  \"A field of rice!\"  \"Achang will tell you that is what they call them in Borneo.\"  \"Bad luck to such Paddies as they are! But it looks as though there might be some Paddies here, for the houses are very neat and nice, just as you see in old Ireland.\"  \"Certainly they are; but I never saw any such in Ireland,\" added Louis. \"You remember the old woman on the road from Killarney to the lakes who told us she lived in the Irish castle, to which she pointed; and it looked like a pig-sty.\"  \"Of course it didn't have the bananas and the cocoanut-palms around it.\"  \"I admit that we saw many fine places in Ireland, and very likely your mother lived in one of them. But, Achang, is there any game in the woods we see beyond the paddies?\"  \"Sometimes there is plenty of it; at others there is scarcely any. You can get squirrels here and some birds.\"  \"Any orang-outangs?\"  \"We found none when we came up the river, for this is not the best place for them. If we run up the Sadong and Samujan Rivers, you will find some,\" replied the Bornean. \"I don't think it will pay to go very far up the Sarawak, if it is game you want; but you can see the country. There is quite a village on the right.\"  The party were very much interested in examining the houses they saw on the borders of the stream. Like those they had seen in Java and in Sumatra, they were all set up on stilts. A Malay or Dyak will not build his home on dry land, as they noticed in coming up the lower part of the river, though there was plenty of elevated ground near. The dwellings were all built on the soft mud.  The village ten miles up-stream was constructed on the same plan. The houses were placed just out of the reach of the water when it was higher than usual. The material was something like bamboo, as in India, with roofs of kadjang leaves, which abound in the low lands. In front of every one of them was a flat boat--sampan; and one was seen which was large enough to have a roof of the same material as the house. The boats were made fast to a pole set in the mud.  \"There is a bear on the shore!\" shouted Morris, with no little excitement in his manner, as he pointed to the woods on the shore opposite the houses, to which the attention of all the rest of the party had been directed.  At the same time he seized his repeating rifle, and all the others followed his example. The animal was fully three feet high, and at a second glance it did not look much like a bear. Whatever it was, it took to its heels when the sound of the steamer's screw reached its ear. But Morris fired before the boat started, and the others did the same.  \"That is not a bear, Mr. Morris,\" interposed Achang, laughing as he spoke.  \"What is it, then?\" demanded Morris.  \"A pig.\"  \"A pig three feet high!\" exclaimed the hunters with one voice.  \"A wild pig,\" added the Bornean.  \"Is he good for anything?\" inquired Scott.  \"He is good to eat if you like pork.\"  \"He dropped in the bushes when we fired. Can't we get him?\" asked Morris.  Under the direction of the captain the steamer was run up to the shore; and the bank in this place was high enough to enable the party to land without using the sampan. All hands, including the seamen, rushed in the direction of the spot where the pig had been seen. The game was readily found. The animal was something like a Kentucky hog, often called a \"racer,\" because he is so tall and lank. He was a long-legged specimen; and Achang said that was because they hunted through swamps and shallow water in search of food, and much use had made their legs long. He added that they were a nuisance because they rooted up the rice, and farmers had to fence their fields.  He was carried on board by the sailors, and Pitts cut out some of the nicer parts of the pig. They had roast pork for dinner, but it was not so good as civilized hogs produce.      CHAPTER III  SOMETHING ABOUT BORNEO AND ITS PEOPLE   \"I don't think we know much of anything about Borneo,\" said Scott, as the Blanchita continued on her course up the Sarawak, after the dinner of roast pork.  \"We all heard the lecture of Professor Giroud on board the ship,\" replied Louis.  \"I should like to hear it over again, now that we are on the ground,\" added the captain.  \"Sure, we're not on the ground, but on the wather,\" suggested Felix.  As the reader did not hear the lecture, or see it in print, it becomes necessary to repeat it for the benefit of \"whom it may concern.\" The professor, after being duly presented to his audience in Conference Hall, proceeded as follows:--  \"Australia is undoubtedly the largest island in the world, and some geographers class it with the continents; but Chambers makes Borneo the third in size, while most authorities rate it as the second, making Papua, or New Guinea, the second in extent. Lippincott says Papua disputes with Borneo the claim to the second place among the great islands of the world; and I do not propose to settle the question. Chambers gives the area of Borneo at 284,000 square miles, the population in the neighborhood of 200,000, and the dimensions as 800 by 700 miles.  \"It has a coast-line of about 3,000 miles, nearly the whole of which is low and marshy land. A large portion of the island is mountainous, as you may see by looking at the map before you;\" and the professor indicated the several ranges with the pointer. \"One chain extends nearly the whole length of the island, dividing in the middle of it into two branches, both of which almost reach the sea on the south. Near the centre of the island are two cross ranges, one extending to the east, and the other to the south-west. It would be useless to mention the Malay names of these ranges, for you could not remember them over night. The general idea I have given you is quite enough to retain.  \"The interior of Borneo is but little known; and when Mr. Gaskette makes another map of the island twenty or thirty years hence, it will probably differ considerably from the one before you. In the extreme north is the peak of Kini Balu, the height of which is set down at 13,698 feet, with an interrogation point after it. Other mountains are estimated to be from 4,000 to 8,000 feet high. There are no active volcanoes.  \"In the low lands on the coast, it is hot, damp, and unhealthy for those who are not acclimated; but in the high lands among the mountains, the temperature is moderate, from 81° to 91° at noon, and it is sometimes worse than that in New York. From November to May, which is the rainy season, violent storms of wind with thunder-showers prevail on the west coast. In hot weather the sea-breezes extend a considerable distance inland. Vegetation is remarkably luxuriant, as our young hunters will find in their explorations. The forests produce all the woods of the Indian Archipelago, of which you know the names by this time. Bruneï, on the north-west coast, produces the best camphor in Asia, which is about the same as saying in the world.\"  \"What is camphor, Professor?\" asked Mrs. Belgrave. \"I have used it all my life, but I have not the least idea what it is.\"  \"Camphor is an oil found in certain plants, mostly from the camphor laurel. This oil is separated from the plant, and then undergoes the process of refining. It is mixed with water, and then boiled in a sort of retort. It makes steam, which is allowed to escape through a small aperture, which is then closed, and the camphor becomes solid in the upper part of the vessel. This is the article which is sent to market.  \"All the spices and fruits of the Torrid Zone are produced in Borneo, with cotton and sugar-cane in certain parts. The animals of the island are about the same as in other parts of the Archipelago. The monkey tribe is the most abundant, including the simia, the gibbon, the orang-outang, found in no other island, except very rarely in Sumatra, where our hunters did not find even one; tapirs\"--  \"What are they?\" asked Uncle Moses.  \"They are a sort of cross between an elephant and a hog. They are found all over South American tropical regions and in this part of Asia. The animal is more like a hog than like an elephant, though it has the same kind of a skin as the latter. It is about the size of the average donkey. It has a snout which is prehensile, like the trunk of an elephant, but on a very small scale.  \"What does that mean?\" asked Mrs. Blossom.  \"Capable of taking hold of anything, as the elephant does with his proboscis. The tapir is one of the gentler animals, and may be easily tamed; though it will fight and bite hard when attacked, or harried by dogs. They take to the water readily, though the American swims, while the Asiatic only walk on the bottom. One book I consulted calls the tapir a kind of tiger, to which he bears hardly any resemblance.  \"The other animals are small Malay bears, wild swine, horned cattle, and puny"]]]
