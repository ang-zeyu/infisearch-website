And hence he decided 'twas better to wait, Since his appetite grew when he supped rather late. Pretty soon he was hungry, and stalked to the bank. Where some pondfish were leaping--a fish of low rank. \"Bah, Bah!\" said the Bird. \"Sup on these? No--not I. I'm known as a Heron: as such I live high.\" Then some gudgeon swam past that were tempting to see, But the Heron said hautily: \"No--not for me. For those I'd not bother to open my beak, If I had to hang 'round come next Friday a week.\" Thus bragged the big Bird. But he's bound to confess That he opened his elegant beak for much less. Not another fish came. When he found all else fail, He was happy to happen upon a fat snail.    The Raven Who Would Rival The Eagle.  An Eagle swooped from out the sky, And carried off a sheep. A Raven seeing him, said: \"I Could do that too if I should try. His meal comes mighty cheap.\"  Of all that well-fed flock was one As fat as fat could be. The Raven rose, and lit upon Her back. She seemed to weigh a ton-- So very fat was she.  And, oh! Her wool was wondrous thick: It would have made a mat. The Raven's claws are caught, and stick! He's played himself a pretty trick-- To fly with one so fat.  \"Ba, ba!\" \"Caw, caw!\" cry bird and beast. The shepherd comes at last: Sir Raven who would find a feast Is from the woolly one released, And in a cage kept fast.    The Miller, His Son And The Ass.  A Miller and Son once set out for the fair, To sell a fine ass they had brought up with care; And the way that they started made everyone stare.  To keep the Ass fresh, so the beast would sell dear On a pole they slung him. It surely seemed queer: He looked, with heels up, like some huge chandelier.  One person who passed them cried out in great glee. \"Was there anything ever so silly?\" said he. \"Can you guess who the greatest Ass is of those three?\"  The Miller at once put the brute on the ground; And the Ass, who had liked to ride t'other way round, Complained in language of curious sound.  No matter. The Miller now made his Son ride, While he followed after or walked alongside. Then up came three merchants. The eldest one cried;  \"Get down there, young fellow! I never did see Such manners:--a gray-beard walks where you should be. He should ride, you should follow. Just take that from me!\"  \"Dear Sirs,\" quoth the Miller, \"I'd see you content.\" He climbed to the saddle; on foot the boy went... Three girls passed. Said one: \"Do you see that old Gent? There he sits, like a bishop. I say it's a shame, While that boy trudging after seems more than half lame.\" \"Little girl,\" said the Miller, \"go back whence you came.\"  Yet this young creature so worked on his mind That he wanted no woman to call him unkind: And he said to his Son: \"Seat yourself here--behind.\"  With the Ass bearing double they jogged on again, And once more met a critic, who said: \"It is plain Only dunces would give their poor donkey such pain. He will die with their weight: it's a shame and a sin. For their faithful servant they care not a pin. They'll have nothing to sell at the fair but his skin.\"  \"Dear me!\" said the Miller, \"what am I to do? Must I suit the whole world and the world's father, too? Yet it must end some time--so I'll see the thing through.\"  Both Father and Son now decided to walk, While the Ass marched in front with a strut and a stalk; Yet the people who passed them continued to talk.  Said one to another: \"Look there, if you please, How they wear out their shoes, while their Ass takes his ease. Were there ever, d'ye think, three such asses as these?\" Said the Miller: \"You're right. I'm an Ass! It is true. Too long have I listened to people like you. But now I am done with the whole kit and crew.  \"Let them blame me or praise me, keep silent or yell, My goings and comings they cannot compel. I will do as I please!\"...So he did--and did well."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24119"],["title","Make Mine Homogenized (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note: This e-text was produced from Astounding Science Fiction, April, 1960.

MAKE MINE HOMOGENIZED   By RICK RAPHAEL  Illustrated by Freas   Anyone looking for guaranteed sound science will have to look elsewhere. But if it's fun you want ... try the world's most potent eggnog!   \"Shoo,\" Hetty Thompson cried, waving her battered old felt hat at the clucking cluster of hens eddying around her legs as she plowed through the flock towards the chicken house. \"Scat. You, Solomon,\" she called out, directing her words at the bobbing comb of the big rooster strutting at the edge of the mob. \"Don't just stand there like a satisfied cowhand after a night in Reno. Get these noisy females outta my way.\" She batted at the hens and they scattered with angry squawks of protest.  Hetty paused in the doorway of the chicken house to allow her eyes to become accustomed to the cool gloom after the bright glare of the ranch yard. She could feel the first trickles of sweat forming under the man's shirt she was wearing as the hot, early morning Nevada sun beat down on her back in the doorway.  Moving carefully but quickly through the nests, she reached and groped for the eggs she knew would be found in the scattered straw. As she placed each find carefully in the bucket she carried, her lips moved in a soundless count. When she had finished, she straightened up and left the chicken house, her face reflecting minor irritation.  Again the hens swirled about her, hoping for the handfuls of cracked corn she usually tossed to them. On the other side of the yard Solomon stepped majestically along the edge of the vegetable garden, never crossing the hoed line separating garden from yard.  \"You'd better stay over there, you no-account Lothario,\" Hetty growled. \"Five eggs short this morning and all you do is act like you were just the business agent for this bunch of fugitives from a dumpling pot.\" Solomon cocked his head and stared Hetty down. She paused at the foot of the backporch steps and threw the rooster a final remark. \"You don't do any better than this you're liable to wind up in that pot yourself.\" Solomon gave a scornful cluck. \"Better still, I'll get me a young rooster in here and take over your job.\" Solomon let out a squawk and took out at a dead run, herding three hens before him towards the chicken house.  With a satisfied smile of triumph, Hetty climbed the steps and crossed to the kitchen door. She turned and looked back across the yard towards the barn and corrals.  \"Barneeeeey,\" Hetty yelled. \"Ain't you finished with that milking yet?\"  \"Comin' now, Miz Thompson,\" came the reply from the barn. Hetty let the screen door slam behind her as she walked into the kitchen and placed the bucket of eggs on the big work table. She had her arm up to wipe her moist forehead on the sleeve of her shirt when she spotted the golden egg lying in the middle of the others in the galvanized bucket.  She froze in the arm-lifted position for several seconds, staring at the dully glowing egg. Then she slowly reached out and picked it up. It was slightly heavier than a regular egg, but for the dull, gold-bronze metallic appearance of the shell, looked just like any of the other twenty-odd eggs in the bucket. She was still holding it in the palm of her hand when the kitchen door again slammed and the handy man limped into the room. He carried two pails of milk across the kitchen and set them down near the sink.  \"Whatcha lookin' at, Miz Thompson?\" Barney Hatfield asked.  Hetty frowned at the egg in her hand without answering. Barney limped around the side of the table for a closer look. Sunlight streaming through the kitchen windows glinted on the shell of the odd egg. Barney's eyes grew round. \"Now ain't that something,\" he whispered in awe.  Hetty started as though someone had snapped their fingers in front of her staring eyes. Her normal look of practical dubiousness returned.  \"Huh,\" she snorted. \"Even had me fooled for a second. Something wrong with this egg but it sure is shootin' ain't gold. One of them fool hens must of been pecking in the fertilizer storeroom and got herself an overdose of some of them minerals in that stuff.  \"What are you staring at, you old fool,\" she glared at Barney. \"It ain't gold.\" Hetty laid the egg at one side of the table. She walked to the sink and took a clean, two-gallon milk can from the drainboard and set it in the sink to fill it from the pails of rich, frothy milk Barney had brought in the pails.  \"Sally come fresh this morning, Miz Thompson,\" he said. \"Got herself a real fine little bull calf.\"  Hetty looked at the two pails of milk. \"Well, where's the rest of the milk, then?\"  \"That's Queenie's milk,\" Barney said. \"Sally's is still out on the porch.\"  \"Well bring it in before the sun clabbers it.\"  \"Can't,\" Barney said.  Hetty swung around and glared at him. \"What do you mean, you can't? You suddenly come down with the glanders?\"  \"No'm, it's just that Sally's milk ain't no good,\" he replied.                       *      *      *      *      *  A frown spread over Hetty's face as she hoisted one of the milk pails and began pouring into the can in the sink. \"What's wrong with it, Barney? Sally seem sick or something?\" she asked.  Barney scratched his head. \"I don't rightly know, Miz Thompson. That milk looks all right, or at least, almost all right. It's kinda thin and don't have no foam like you'd expect milk to have. But mostly, it sure don't smell right and it danged well don't taste right.  \"_Phooey._\" He made a face at the memory of the taste. \"I stuck my finger in it when it looked kinda queer, and took a taste. It shore tasted lousy.\"  \"You probably been currying that mangey old horse of yours before you went to milking,\" Hetty snorted, \"and tasted his cancerous old hide on your fingers. I've told you for the last time to wash your hands before you go to milking them cows. I didn't pay no eighteen hundred dollars for that prize, registered Guernsey just to have you give her bag fever with your dirty hands.\"  \"That ain't so, Miz Thompson,\" Barney cried indignantly. \"I did too, wash my hands. Good, too. I wuzn't near my horse this morning. That milk just weren't no good.\"  Hetty finished pouring the milk into the cans and after putting the cans in the refrigerator, wiped her hands on her jeans and went out onto the porch, Barney trailing behind her. She bent over and sniffed at the two milk pails setting beside the door. \"_Whew_,\" she exclaimed, \"it sure does smell funny. Hand me that dipper, Barney.\"  Barney reached for a dipper hanging on a nail beside the kitchen door. Hetty dipped out a small quantity of the milk, sipped, straightened up with a jerk and spewed the milk out into the yard. \"Yaawwwk,\" she spluttered, \"that tastes worse 'n Diesel oil.\"  She stared distastefully at the swirling, flat-looking liquid in the pails and then turned back to the kitchen. \"I never saw the like of it,\" she exclaimed. \"Chickens come out with some kind of sorry-looking egg and now, in the same morning, an eighteen hundred dollar registered, fresh Guernsey gives out hogwash instead of milk.\" She stared thoughtfully across the yard at the distant mountains, now shimmering in the hot, midmorning sun. \"Guess we could swill the hogs with that milk, rather'n throw it out, Barney. I never seen anything them Durocs wouldn't eat. When you get ready to put the other swill in the cooker, toss that milk in with it and cook it up for the hogs.\"  Hetty went back into her kitchen and Barney turned and limped across the yard to the tractor shed. He pulled the brim of his sweat-stained Stetson over his eyes and squinted south over the heat-dancing sage and sparse grasslands of Circle T range. Dust devils were pirouetting in the hazy distance towards the mountains forming a corridor leading to the ranch. A dirt road led out of the yard and crossed an oiled county road about five miles south of the ranch. The county road was now the only link the Circle T had to the cattle shipping pens at Carson City. The dirt road arrowed south across the range but fifteen miles from the ranch, a six-strand, new, barbed-wire fence cut the road. A white metal sign with raised letters proclaimed \"Road Closed. U.S. Government Military Reservation. Restricted Area. Danger--Peligre. Keep Out.\"  The taut bands of wire stretched east and west of the road for more than twenty miles in each direction, with duplicates of the metal sign hung on the fence every five hundred yards. Then the wires turned south for nearly a hundred miles, etching in skin-blistering, sun-heated strands, the outlines of the Nevada atomic testing grounds at Frenchman's Flat.  When the wire first went up, Hetty and her ranching neighbors had screamed to high heaven and high congressmen about the loss of the road and range. The fence stayed up. Now they had gotten used to the idea and had even grown blasé about the frequent nuclear blasts that rattled the desert floor sixty miles from ground zero.                       *      *      *      *      *  Barney built a fire under the big, smoke-blackened cauldron Hetty used for cooking the hog swill. Dale Hamilton, the county agent, had given Hetty a long talk on the dangers of feeding the pigs, raw, uncooked and possibly contaminated, garbage. When Hamilton got graphic about what happened to people who ate pork from such hogs, Hetty turned politely green and had Barney set up the cooking cauldron.  After dumping the kitchen slops into the pot, Barney hiked back across the yard to get the two pails of bad milk.  Hetty was sitting at the kitchen table, putting the eggs into plastic refrigerator dishes when the hog slop exploded in a whooshing roar, followed a split second later by an even louder blast that rocked the ranch buildings. The eggs flew across the room as the lid of the slop cauldron came whistling"]]]
