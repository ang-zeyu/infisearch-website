And brawling with recruits.\" He held a long silence. \"Very well, come with me.\" He turned and marched off.  Joe inwardly shrugged. This was a fine start for his pitch--a fine start. He had half a mind to give it all up, here and now, and head on up to Catskill to enlist with Continental Hovercraft. His big scheme would wait for another day. Nevertheless, he fell in behind the aristocrat and followed him to the offices which had been his original destination.         *       *       *       *       *  Two Rank Privates with 45-70 Springfields and wearing the Haer kilts in such wise as to indicate permanent status in Vacuum Tube Transport came to the salute as they approached. The Upper preceding Joe Mauser flicked his swagger stick in an easy nonchalance. Joe felt envious amusement. How long did it take to learn how to answer a salute with that degree of arrogant ease?  There were desks in here, and typers humming, as Vacuum Tube Transport office workers, mobilized for this special service, processed volunteers for the company forces. Harried noncoms and junior-grade officers buzzed everywhere, failing miserably to bring order to the chaos. To the right was a door with a medical cross newly painted on it. When it occasionally popped open to admit or emit a recruit, white-robed doctors, male nurses and half nude men could be glimpsed beyond.  Joe followed the other through the press and to an inner office at which door he didn't bother to knock. He pushed his way through, waved in greeting with his swagger stick to the single occupant who looked up from the paper- and tape-strewn desk at which he sat.  Joe Mauser had seen the face before on Telly though never so tired as this and never with the element of defeat to be read in the expression. Bullet-headed, barrel-figured Baron Malcolm Haer of Vacuum Tube Transport. Category Transportation, Mid-Upper, and strong candidate for Upper-Upper upon retirement. However, there would be few who expected retirement in the immediate future. Hardly. Malcolm Haer found too obvious a lusty enjoyment in the competition between Vacuum Tube Transport and its stronger rivals.         *       *       *  Joe came to attention, bore the sharp scrutiny of his chosen commander-to-be. The older man's eyes went to the kilted Upper officer who had brought Joe along. \"What is it, Balt?\"  The other gestured with his stick at Joe. \"Claims to be Rank Captain. Looking for a commission with us, Dad. I wouldn't know why.\" The last sentence was added lazily.  The older Haer shot an irritated glance at his son. \"Possibly for the same reason mercenaries usually enlist for a fracas, Balt.\" His eyes came back to Joe.  Joe Mauser, still at attention even though in mufti, opened his mouth to give his name, category and rank, but the older man waved a hand negatively. \"Captain Mauser, isn't it? I caught the fracas between Carbonaceous Fuel and United Miners, down on the Panhandle Reservation. Seems to me I've spotted you once or twice before, too.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Joe said. This was some improvement in the way things were going.  The older Haer was scowling at him. \"Confound it, what are you doing with no more rank than captain? On the face of it, you're an old hand, a highly experienced veteran.\"  _An old pro, we call ourselves_, Joe said to himself. _Old pros, we call ourselves, among ourselves._  Aloud, he said, \"I was born a Mid-Lower, sir.\"  There was understanding in the old man's face, but Balt Haer said loftily, \"What's that got to do with it? Promotion is quick and based on merit in Category Military.\"  At a certain point, if you are good combat officer material, you speak your mind no matter the rank of the man you are addressing. On this occasion, Joe Mauser needed few words. He let his eyes go up and down Balt Haer's immaculate uniform, taking in the swagger stick of the Rank Colonel or above. Joe said evenly, \"Yes, sir.\"  Balt Haer flushed quick temper. \"What do you mean by--\"  But his father was chuckling. \"You have spirit, captain. I need spirit now. You are quite correct. My son, though a capable officer, I assure you, has probably not participated in a fraction of the fracases you have to your credit. However, there is something to be said for the training available to we Uppers in the academies. For instance, captain, have you ever commanded a body of lads larger than, well, a _company_?\"  Joe said flatly, \"In the Douglas-Boeing versus Lockheed-Cessna fracas we took a high loss of officers when the Douglas-Boeing outfit rang in some fast-firing French _mitrailleuse_ we didn't know they had. As my superiors took casualties I was field promoted to acting battalion commander, to acting regimental commander, to acting brigadier. For three days I held the rank of acting commander of brigade. We won.\"  Balt Haer snapped his fingers. \"I remember that. Read quite a paper on it.\" He eyed Joe Mauser, almost respectfully. \"Stonewall Cogswell got the credit for the victory and received his marshal's baton as a result.\"  \"He was one of the few other officers that survived,\" Joe said dryly.  \"But, Zen! You mean you got no promotion at all?\"  Joe said, \"I was upped to Low-Middle from High-Lower, sir. At my age, at the time, quite a promotion.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Baron Haer was remembering, too. \"That was the fracas that brought on the howl from the Sovs. They claimed those _mitrailleuse_ were post-1900 and violated the Universal Disarmament Pact. Yes, I recall that. Douglas-Boeing was able to prove that the weapon was used by the French as far back as the Franco-Prussian War.\" He eyed Joe with new interest now. \"Sit down, captain. You too, Balt. Do you realize that Captain Mauser is the only recruit of officer rank we've had today?\"  \"Yes,\" the younger Haer said dryly. \"However, it's too late to call the fracas off now. Hovercraft wouldn't stand for it, and the Category Military Department would back them. Our only alternative is unconditional surrender, and you know what that means.\"  \"It means our family would probably be forced from control of the firm,\" the older man growled. \"But nobody has suggested surrender on any terms. Nobody, thus far.\" He glared at his officer son who took it with an easy shrug and swung a leg over the edge of his father's desk in the way of a seat.  Joe Mauser found a chair and lowered himself into it. Evidently, the foppish Balt Haer had no illusions about the spot his father had got the family corporation into. And the younger man was right, of course.  But the Baron wasn't blind to reality any more than he was a coward. He dismissed Balt Haer's defeatism from his mind and came back to Joe Mauser. \"As I say, you're the only officer recruit today. Why?\"  Joe said evenly, \"I wouldn't know, sir. Perhaps freelance Category Military men are occupied elsewhere. There's always a shortage of trained officers.\"  Baron Haer was waggling a finger negatively. \"That's not what I mean, captain. You are an old hand. This is your category and you must know it well. Then why are _you_ signing up with Vacuum Tube Transport rather than Hovercraft?\"  Joe Mauser looked at him for a moment without speaking.  \"Come, come, captain. I am an old hand too, in my category, and not a fool. I realize there is scarcely a soul in the West-world that expects anything but disaster for my colors. Pay rates have been widely posted. I can offer only five common shares of Vacuum Tube for a Rank Captain, win or lose. Hovercraft is doubling that, and can pick and choose among the best officers in the hemisphere.\"  Joe said softly, \"I have all the shares I need.\"  Balt Haer had been looking back and forth between his father and the newcomer and becoming obviously more puzzled. He put in, \"Well, what in Zen motivates you if it isn't the stock we offer?\"  Joe glanced at the younger Haer to acknowledge the question but he spoke to the Baron. \"Sir, like you said, you're no fool. However, you've been sucked in, this time. When you took on Hovercraft, you were thinking in terms of a regional dispute. You wanted to run one of your vacuum tube deals up to Fairbanks from Edmonton. You were expecting a minor fracas, involving possibly five thousand men. You never expected Hovercraft to parlay it up, through their connections in the Category Military Department, to a divisional magnitude fracas which you simply aren't large enough to afford. But Hovercraft was getting sick of your corporation. You've been nicking away at them too long. So they decided to do you in. They've hired Marshal Cogswell and the best combat officers in North America, and they're hiring the most competent veterans they can find. Every fracas buff who watches Telly, figures you've had it. They've been watching you come up the aggressive way, the hard way, for a long time, but now they're all going to be sitting on the edges of their sofas waiting for you to get it.\"  Baron Haer's heavy face had hardened as Joe Mauser went on relentlessly. He growled, \"Is this what everyone thinks?\"  \"Yes. Everyone intelligent enough to have an opinion.\" Joe made a motion of his head to the outer offices where the recruiting was proceeding. \"Those men out there are rejects from Catskill, where old Baron Zwerdling is recruiting. Either that or they're inexperienced Low-Lowers, too stupid to realize they're sticking their necks out. Not one man in ten is a veteran. And when things begin to pickle, you want veterans.\"  Baron Malcolm Haer sat back in his chair and stared coldly at Captain Joe Mauser. He said, \"At first I was moderately surprised that an old time mercenary like yourself should choose my uniform, rather than Zwerdling's. Now I am increasingly mystified about motivation. So all over again I ask you, captain: Why are you requesting a commission in my forces which you seem convinced will meet disaster?\"  Joe wet his lips carefully. \"I think I know a way you can win.\"     II   His permanent military rank "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24370"],["title","Mercenary (#2)"],["body","Haers had no way to alter, but they were short enough of competent officers that they gave him an acting rating and pay scale of major and command of a squadron of cavalry. Joe Mauser wasn't interested in a cavalry command this fracas, but he said nothing. Immediately, he had to size up the situation; it wasn't time as yet to reveal the big scheme. And, meanwhile, they could use him to whip the Rank Privates into shape.  He had left the offices of Baron Haer to go through the red tape involved in being signed up on a temporary basis in the Vacuum Tube Transport forces, and reentered the confusion of the outer offices where the Lowers were being processed and given medicals. He reentered in time to run into a Telly team which was doing a live broadcast.  Joe Mauser remembered the news reporter who headed the team. He'd run into him two or three times in fracases. As a matter of fact, although Joe held the standard Military Category prejudices against Telly, he had a basic respect for this particular newsman. On the occasions he'd seen him before, the fellow was hot in the midst of the action even when things were in the dill. He took as many chances as did the average combatant, and you can't ask for more than that.  The other knew him, too, of course. It was part of his job to be able to spot the celebrities and near celebrities. He zeroed in on Joe now, making flicks of his hand to direct the cameras. Joe, of course, was fully aware of the value of Telly and was glad to co-operate.  \"Captain! Captain Mauser, isn't it? Joe Mauser who held out for four days in the swamps of Louisiana with a single company while his ranking officers reformed behind him.\"  That was one way of putting it, but both Joe and the newscaster who had covered the debacle knew the reality of the situation. When the front had collapsed, his commanders--of Upper caste, of course--had hauled out, leaving him to fight a delaying action while they mended their fences with the enemy, coming to the best terms possible. Yes, that had been the United Oil versus Allied Petroleum fracas, and Joe had emerged with little either in glory or pelf.  The average fracas fan wasn't on an intellectual level to appreciate anything other than victory. The good guys win, the bad guys lose--that's obvious, isn't it? Not one out of ten Telly followers of the fracases was interested in a well-conducted retreat or holding action. They wanted blood, lots of it, and they identified with the winning side.  Joe Mauser wasn't particularly bitter about this aspect. It was part of his way of life. In fact, his pet peeve was the _real_ buff. The type, man or woman, who could remember every fracas you'd ever been in, every time you'd copped one, and how long you'd been in the hospital. Fans who could remember, even better than you could, every time the situation had pickled on you and you'd had to fight your way out as best you could. They'd tell you about it, their eyes gleaming, sometimes a slightest trickle of spittle at the sides of their mouths. They usually wanted an autograph, or a souvenir such as a uniform button.  Now Joe said to the Telly reporter, \"That's right, Captain Mauser. Acting major, in this fracas, ah--\"  \"Freddy. Freddy Soligen. You remember me, captain--\"  \"Of course I do, Freddy. We've been in the dill, side by side, more than once, and even when I was too scared to use my side arm, you'd be scanning away with your camera.\"  \"Ha ha, listen to the captain, folks. I hope my boss is tuned in. But seriously, Captain Mauser, what do you think the chances of Vacuum Tube Transport are in this fracas?\"  Joe looked into the camera lens, earnestly. \"The best, of course, or I wouldn't have signed up with Baron Haer, Freddy. Justice triumphs, and anybody who is familiar with the issues in this fracas, knows that Baron Haer is on the side of true right.\"  Freddy said, holding any sarcasm he must have felt, \"What would you say the issues were, captain?\"  \"The basic North American free enterprise right to compete. Hovercraft has held a near monopoly in transport to Fairbanks. Vacuum Tube Transport wishes to lower costs and bring the consumers of Fairbanks better service through running a vacuum tube to that area. What could be more in the traditions of the West-world? Continental Hovercraft stands in the way and it is they who have demanded of the Category Military Department a trial by arms. On the face of it, justice is on the side of Baron Haer.\"  Freddy Soligen said into the camera, \"Well, all you good people of the Telly world, that's an able summation the captain has made, but it certainly doesn't jibe with the words of Baron Zwerdling we heard this morning, does it? However, justice triumphs and we'll see what the field of combat will have to offer. Thank you, thank you very much, Captain Mauser. All of us, all of us tuned in today, hope that you personally will run into no dill in this fracas.\"  \"Thanks, Freddy. Thanks all,\" Joe said into the camera, before turning away. He wasn't particularly keen about this part of the job, but you couldn't underrate the importance of pleasing the buffs. In the long run it was your career, your chances for promotion both in military rank and ultimately in caste. It was the way the fans took you up, boosted you, idolized you, worshipped you if you really made it. He, Joe Mauser, was only a minor celebrity, he appreciated every chance he had to be interviewed by such a popular reporter as Freddy Soligen.         *       *       *       *       *  Even as he turned, he spotted the four men with whom he'd had his spat earlier. The little fellow was still to the fore. Evidently, the others had decided the one place extra that he represented wasn't worth the trouble he'd put in their way defending it.  On an impulse he stepped up to the small man who began a grin of recognition, a grin that transformed his feisty face. A revelation of an inner warmth beyond average in a world which had lost much of its human warmth.  [Illustration]  Joe said, \"Like a job, soldier?\"  \"Name's Max. Max Mainz. Sure I want a job. That's why I'm in this everlasting line.\"  Joe said, \"First fracas for you, isn't it?\"  \"Yeah, but I had basic training in school.\"  \"What do you weigh, Max?\"  Max's face soured. \"About one twenty.\"  \"Did you check out on semaphore in school?\"  \"Well, sure. I'm Category Food, Sub-division Cooking, Branch Chef, but, like I say, I took basic military training, like most everybody else.\"  \"I'm Captain Joe Mauser. How'd you like to be my batman?\"  Max screwed up his already not overly handsome face. \"Gee, I don't know. I kinda joined up to see some action. Get into the dill. You know what I mean.\"  Joe said dryly, \"See here, Mainz, you'll probably find more pickled situations next to me than you'll want--and you'll come out alive.\"  The recruiting sergeant looked up from the desk. It was Max Mainz's turn to be processed. The sergeant said, \"Lad, take a good opportunity when it drops in your lap. The captain is one of the best in the field. You'll learn more, get better chances for promotion, if you stick with him.\"  Joe couldn't remember ever having run into the sergeant before, but he said, \"Thanks, sergeant.\"  The other said, evidently realizing Joe didn't recognize him, \"We were together on the Chihuahua Reservation, on the jurisdictional fracas between the United Miners and the Teamsters, sir.\"  It had been almost fifteen years ago. About all that Joe Mauser remembered of that fracas was the abnormal number of casualties they'd taken. His side had lost, but from this distance in time Joe couldn't even remember what force he'd been with. But now he said, \"That's right. I thought I recognized you, sergeant.\"  \"It was my first fracas, sir.\" The sergeant went businesslike. \"If you want I should hustle this lad though, captain--\"  \"Please do, sergeant.\" Joe added to Max, \"I'm not sure where my billet will be. When you're through all this, locate the officer's mess and wait there for me.\"  \"Well, O.K.,\" Max said doubtfully, still scowling but evidently a servant of an officer, if he wanted to be or not.  \"Sir,\" the sergeant added ominously. \"If you've had basic, you know enough how to address an officer.\"  \"Well, yessir,\" Max said hurriedly.  Joe began to turn away, but then spotted the man immediately behind Max Mainz. He was one of the three with whom Joe had tangled earlier, the one who'd obviously had previous combat experience. He pointed the man out to the sergeant. \"You'd better give this lad at least temporary rank of corporal. He's a veteran and we're short of veterans.\"  The sergeant said, \"Yes, sir. We sure are.\" Joe's former foe looked properly thankful.         *       *       *       *       *  Joe Mauser finished off his own red tape and headed for the street to locate a military tailor who could do him up a set of the Haer kilts and fill his other dress requirements. As he went, he wondered vaguely just how many different uniforms he had worn in his time.  In a career as long as his own from time to time you took semi-permanent positions in bodyguards, company police, or possibly the permanent combat troops of this corporation or that. But largely, if you were ambitious, you signed up for the fracases and that meant into a uniform and out of it again in as short a period as a couple of weeks.  At the door he tried to move aside but was too slow for the quick moving young woman who caromed off him. He caught her arm to prevent her from stumbling. She looked at him with less than thanks.  Joe took the blame for the collision. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I'm afraid I didn't see you, Miss.\"  \"Obviously,\" she said coldly. Her eyes went up and down him, and for a moment he wondered where he had seen her before. Somewhere, he was sure.  She was dressed as they dress who have never considered cost and she had an elusive beauty which would have been even the more hadn't her face projected quite such a serious outlook. Her"]]]
