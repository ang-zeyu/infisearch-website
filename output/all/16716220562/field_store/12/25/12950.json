Next, but on the left bank of the bayou, stood the 9th Connecticut.  Next, and on the left of the Greenwell Springs road, the 14th Maine.  On the right of that road was posted the 21st Indiana, under Lieutenant-Colonel Keith, with three guns attached to the regiment, under Lieutenant J. H. Brown.  Across the Perkins and Clay Cut roads the 6th Michigan was formed, under command of Captain Charles E. Clarke, while in the rear of the interval between the 6th Michigan and the 21st Indiana stood the 7th Vermont.  The extreme right and rear were covered by the 30th Massachusetts in column, supporting Nims's battery, under Lieutenant Trull.  On the centre and left were planted the guns of Everett's battery, under Carruth, and of Manning's 4th Massachusetts battery.  The left flank was supported by the _Essex_, Commander William D. Porter; the _Cayuga_, Lieutenant Harrison; and the _Sumter_, Lieutenant Erben; the right flank by the _Kineo_, Lieutenant-Commander Ransom, and _Katahdin_, Lieutenant Roe.  These dispositions were planned expressly to meet the expected attack by the ram _Arkansas_, and in that view the arrangement was probably the best that the formation of the ground permitted.  But the fighting line was very far advanced; the camps still farther; the reserve on the right was posted quite a mile and a half behind the capitol, and, as at Shiloh, no portion of the line was fortified or protected in any way, though the field was an open plain and the converging roads gave to the attacking party a wide choice of position.  About daylight Breckinridge moved to the attack in a summer fog so dense that those engaged could at first distinguish neither friend nor enemy.  The blow fell first, and heavily, upon the centre and right, held by the 14th Maine, 21st Indiana, and 6th Michigan.  As our troops were pressed back by the vigor of the first onset, the exposed camps of the 14th Maine, 7th Vermont, and 21st Indiana fell into the hands of the Confederates.  The 9th Connecticut, with Manning's battery, moved to the support of the 14th Maine and 21st Indiana, on the right of the former, and the 4th Wisconsin formed on the left of the 14th.  Further to the right, the 30th Massachusetts advanced to the support of the 21st Indiana and 6th Michigan, covering the interval between the two battalions to replace the 7th Vermont.  In the first fighting in the darkness and the fog this regiment had been roughly handled; its colonel fell, a momentary confusion followed, and the regiment drifted back into a convenient position, where it was soon reformed, under Captain Porter.  Nims brought his guns into battery on the right of the 6th Michigan.  The battle was short, but the fighting was severe; both sides suffered heavily, and each fell into some disorder.  At different moments both wings of the Confederate force were broken, and fell back in something not very unlike panic.  The colors of the 4th Louisiana were captured by the 6th Michigan.  As the fog lifted, under the influence of the increasing heat, it became clear to both sides that the attack had failed.  The force of the fierce Confederate outset was quite spent.  The Union lines, however thinned and shattered, remained in possession of the prize.  \"It was now ten o'clock,\" says Breckinridge.  \"We had listened in vain for the guns of the _Arkansas_: I saw around me not more than 1,000 exhausted men.\"  The battle was over.  Indeed it had been over for some hours; these words probably indicate the period when the Confederate commander gave up his last hope.  The _Arkansas_, disabled within sight of the goal by an accident to her machinery, was run ashore and destroyed by her commander to save her from capture.  The Confederate losses were about 84 killed, 313 wounded, and 56 missing; total, 453.  Clark was severely wounded and made prisoner.  Allen was killed, and two other brigade commanders wounded.  Helm, Hunt, and Thompson had been previously disabled by an accident during the night panic.  The Union losses were 84 killed, 266 wounded, and 33 missing; total, 383.  The heaviest loss fell upon the 21st Indiana, which suffered 126 casualties, and upon the 14th Maine, which reported 118.  Of the killed, 36, or nearly one half, belonged to the 14th Maine, while more than two thirds of the killed and nearly two thirds of the total belonged to that regiment and the 21st Indiana.  The 4th Wisconsin, being posted quite to the left of the point of attack, was not engaged.  Colonel G. T. Roberts, of the 7th Vermont, fell early in the action, and near its close Williams was instantly killed while urging his men to the attack.  In him his little brigade lost the only commander present of experience in war; the country, a brave and accomplished soldier.  If he was, as must be confessed, arbitrary, at times unreasonable, and often harsh, in his treatment of his untrained volunteers, yet many who then thought his discipline too severe to be endured, lived to know, and by their conduct vindicate, the value of his training.  The Confederates appear to have suffered to some extent during the last attack, until the lines drew too near together, from the fire of the _Essex_ and her consorts.  Ransom also speaks of having shelled the enemy with great effect during the afternoon from the _Kineo_ and _Katahdin_, accurately directed by signals from the capitol; but no other account even mentions any firing at that period of the day; the effect cannot, therefore, have been severe, and it seems probable that the troops against whom it was directed may have been some outlying party.  Cahill's seniority entitled him to the command after Williams fell, yet during the remainder of the battle Dudley seems to have commanded the troops actually engaged.  Shortly after the close of the action Cahill assumed the command and sent word to Butler of the state of affairs.  The Confederates were still to be seen upon the field of battle. Their force was naturally enough over-estimated.  Another attack was expected during the afternoon, and reinforcements were urgently called for.  Butler had none to give without putting New Orleans itself in peril.  However, during the evening he determined to release from arrest a number of officers who had been deprived of their swords by Williams at various times, and for various causes, mainly growing out of the confused and as yet rather unsettled policy of the government in reference to the treatment of the negroes, and to send all these officers to Baton Rouge.  Among them were Colonel Paine of the 4th Wisconsin and Colonel Clark of the 6th Michigan.  Since the 11th of June Paine had been in arrest; an arrest of a character peculiar and perhaps unprecedented in the history of armies.  Whenever danger was to be faced, or unusual duty to be performed, he might wear his sword and command his men, but the moment the duty or the danger was at an end he must go back into arrest.  Paine, who was an extremely conscientious officer, as well as a man of high character and firmness of purpose, had from the first taken strong ground against the use of any portion of his force in aid of the claims of the master to the service of the slave.  Williams, strict in his idea of obedience due his superiors, not less than in his notions of obedience due to him by his own inferiors in rank, stood upon his construction of the law and the orders of the War Department, as they then existed; hence in the natural course of events inevitably arose more than one irreconcilable difference of opinion.  Paine was now ordered to go at once to Baton Rouge and take command.  He was told by Butler to burn the town and the capitol.  The library, the paintings, the statuary, and the relics were to be spared, as well as the charitable institutions of the town.  The books, the paintings, and the statue of Washington, he was to send to New Orleans; he was then to evacuate Baton Rouge and retire with his whole force to New Orleans.  At midnight on the 6th of August Paine arrived at Baton Rouge. There he found every thing quiet, with the troops in camp on an interior and shorter line, but expecting another attack.  There was in fact an alarm before morning came, but nothing happened. On the 7th Paine took command and set about putting the town in complete condition for an effective defence.  With his accustomed care and energy he soon rectified the lines and entrenched them with twenty-four guns in position, and, in co-operation with the navy, concerted every measure for an effective defence, even against large numbers.  Breckinridge, however, after continuing to menace Baton Rouge for some days, had, by Van Dorn's orders, retired to Port Hudson, and was now engaged in fortifying that position.  Ruggles was sent there on the 12th of August.  The next day Breckinridge received orders from Van Dorn, then at Jackson, to follow with his whole force.  \"Port Hudson,\" Van Dorn said, \"must be held if possible.\" \"Port Hudson,\" remarks Breckinridge, in his report of the battle of Baton Rouge, \"is one of the strongest points on the Mississippi, which Baton Rouge is not, and batteries there will command the river more completely than at Vicksburg.\"  Meanwhile Butler had changed his mind with regard to the evacuation of Baton Rouge, and had directed Paine to hold the place for the present.  With an accuracy unusual at this period, Butler estimated Breckinridge's entire force at 5,000 men and fourteen guns.  On the 13th the defences were complete, the entrenchments forming two sides of a triangle of which the river was the base and the cemetery mound the apex.  The troops stood to arms at three o'clock every morning; one fourth of the force was constantly under arms, day and night, at its station.  At two points on each face of the entrenchment flags were planted by day and lights by night, to indicate to the gunboats their line of fire.  On the 16th of August Butler renewed "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24606"],["title","History of the Nineteenth Army Corps (#7)"],["body","orders to burn and evacuate Baton Rouge.  Its retention up to this time he had avowedly regarded as having political rather than military importance.  Now he wrote to Paine:  \"I am constrained to come to the conclusion that it is necessary to evacuate Baton Rouge. . . . Begin the movement quietly and rapidly; get every thing off except your men, and then see to it that the town is destroyed.  After mature deliberation I deem this a military necessity of the highest order.\"  Against these orders Paine made an earnest appeal, based upon considerations partly humane, partly military.  He was so far successful that Butler was induced to countermand the order to burn.  The movement was not to be delayed on account of the statue of Washington.  However, the statue had been already packed.  It is now in the Patent Office at the national capital.  All the books and paintings were brought off, \"except,\" to quote from Paine's diary, \"the portrait of James Buchanan, which we left hanging in the State House for his friends.\"  Finally, on the 20th, Paine evacuated Baton Rouge, and on the following day reached the lines of Carrollton, known as Camp Parapet, and turned over his command to Phelps.   CHAPTER IV. LA FOURCHE.  On the 22d of August Paine was assigned to the command of what was called the \"reserve brigade\" of a division under Phelps.  The brigade was composed of the 4th Wisconsin, 21st Indiana, and 14th Maine, with Brown's battery attached to the Indiana regiment. But this was not to last, for the tension that had long existed between Phelps and the department commander, on the subject of the treatment of the negroes, as well as on the question of arming and employing them, finally resulted in Phelps's resignation on the 21st of August.  On the 13th of September he was succeeded by Brigadier-General Thomas W. Sherman, himself recently relieved from command of the Department of the South, partly, perhaps, in consequence of differences of opinion of a like character.  On the 29th of September the division, then known as Sherman's, was reorganized, and Paine took command of the 1st brigade, composed of the 4th Wisconsin, 21st Indiana, and 8th New Hampshire regiments with the 1st and 2d Vermont batteries and Brown's guns of the 21st Indiana.  Paine's command also included Camp Parapet.  These lines had been originally laid out by the Confederates for the defence of New Orleans against an attack by land from the north; as, for example, by a force approaching through Lake Pontchartrain and Pass Manchac.  They were now put in thorough order, and the Indianians, who had received some artillery instruction during their term of service at Fort McHenry, completed the foundation for the future service as heavy artillerists by going back to the big guns.  In October and November the 8th New Hampshire and 21st Indiana were transferred to Weitzel's brigade and were replaced in Paine's by the 2d Louisiana and temporarily by the 12th Maine.  The official reports covering this period afford several strong hints of a Confederate plan for the recapture of New Orleans.  With this object, apparently, Richard Taylor, a prominent and wealthy Louisianian, closely allied to Jefferson Davis by his first marriage with the daughter of Zachary Taylor, was made a major-general in the Confederate army, and on the 1st of August was assigned to command the Confederate forces in Western Louisiana.  It seems likely that the troops of Van Dorn's department, as well as those at Mobile, were expected to take part.  On the 8th of August orders were issued by the War Department transferring the district of West Florida to the Department of the Gulf.  West Florida meant Pensacola.  Fort Pickens, on the sands of Santa Rosa, commanding the entrance to the splendid harbor, owed to the loyalty of a few staunch officers of the army and the navy the proud distinction of being the one spot between the Chesapeake and the Rio Grande over which, in spite of all hostile attempts, the ensign of the nation had never ceased to float; for the works at Key West and the Dry Tortugas, though likewise held, were never menaced.  Though Bragg early gathered a large force for the capture of the fort, the only serious attempt, made in the dawn of the 9th of October, 1861, was repulsed with a loss to the Confederates of 87, to the Union troops of 61.  Of these, the 6th New York had 9 killed, 7 wounded, 11 missing--in all, 27.  In December the 75th New York came down from the North to reinforce the defenders. Finally, after learning the fate of New Orleans, Bragg evacuated Pensacola, and burned his surplus stores, and on the 10th of May, 1862, Porter, seeing from the passes the glare of the flames, ran over and anchored in the bay.  The advantage thus gained was held to the end.  This transfer gave Butler two strong infantry regiments, as well as several fine batteries and companies of the regular artillery, but at the same time correspondingly increased the territory he had to guard, already far too extensive and too widely scattered for the small force at his disposal.  Toward the end of September Lieutenant Godfrey Weitzel, of the engineers, having been made a brigadier-general on Butler's recommendation, a promotion more than usually justified by service and talent, a brigade was formed for him called the Reserve Brigade, and consisting of the 12th and 13th Connecticut, 75th New York, and 8th New Hampshire, Carruth's 6th Massachusetts battery, Thompson's 1st Maine battery, Perkins's Troop C of the Massachusetts cavalry, and three troops of Louisiana cavalry under Williamson.  From that time, through all the changes, which were many and frequent, Weitzel's brigade changed less than any thing else, and its history may almost be said to be the military history of the Department.  Taylor, with his accustomed energy and enthusiasm, had collected and organized a force, primarily for the defence of the La Fourche country and the Teche, ultimately for the offensive operations already planned.  Butler at once committed to Weitzel the preparations for dislodging Taylor and occupying La Fourche.  This object was important, not only to secure the defence of New Orleans, but because the territory to be occupied comprised or controlled the fertile region between the Mississippi and the Atchafalaya.  The country lies low and flat, and is intersected by numerous navigable bayous, with but narrow roadways along their banks and elsewhere none.  Without naval assistance, the operation would have been difficult, if not impossible; and the navy had in Louisiana no gunboats of a draught light enough for the service.  With the funds of the army Butler caused four light gunboats, the _Estrella, Calhoun, Kinsman,_ and _Diana,_ to be quietly built and equipped, the navy furnishing the officers and the crews.  Under Commander McKean Buchanan they were then sent by the gulf to Berwick Bay.  When he was ready, Weitzel took transports, under convoy of the _Kineo, Sciota, Katahdin,_ and _Itasca_, landed below Donaldsonville, entered the town, and on the 27th of October moved on Thibodeaux, the heart of the district.  At Georgia Landing, about two miles above Labadieville, he encountered the Confederates under Mouton, consisting of the 18th and 33d Louisiana, the Crescent and Terre Bonne regiments, with Ralston's and Semmes's batteries and the 2d Louisiana cavalry, in all reported by Mouton as 1,392 strong.  They had taken up a defensive position on both sides of the bayou. Along these bayous the standing room is for the most part narrow; and as the land, although low, is in general heavily wooded and crossed by many ditches of considerable depth, the country affords defensive positions at once stronger and more numerous than are to be found in most flat regions.  Small bodies of troops, familiar with the topography, have also this further advantage, that there are few points from which their position and numbers can be easily made out.  After a short but spirited engagement Mouton's force was compelled to retreat.  Weitzel pursued for about four miles.  Mouton then called in his outlying detachments, including the La Fourche regiment, 500 strong, 300 men of the 33d Louisiana, and the regiments of Saint Charles and St. John Baptist, burned the railway station of Terre Bonne and the bridges at Thibodeaux, La Fourche Crossing, Terre Bonne, Des Allemands, and Bayou Boeuf, and evacuated the district.  By the 30th, every thing was safely across Berwick Bay.  For this escape, he was indebted to an opportune gale that compelled Buchanan's gunboats to lie to in Caillou Bay on their way to Berwick Bay, to cut off the retreat.  Mouton's report accounts for 5 killed, 8 wounded, and 186 missing; in all 199. Among the killed was Colonel G. P. McPheeters of the Crescent regiment.  Weitzel followed to Thibodeaux, and went into camp beyond the town. He claims to have taken 208 prisoners and one gun, and states his own losses as 18 killed, and 74 wounded, agreeing with the nominal lists, which also contain the names of 5 missing, thus bringing the total casualties to 97.  Arriving off Brashear a day too late, Buchanan was partly consoled by capturing the Confederate gunboat _Seger_.  On the 4th and 5th of November he made a reconnoissance fourteen miles up the Teche with his own boat, the _Calhoun_, and the _Estrella, Kinsman, Saint Mary's_, and _Diana_, and meeting a portion of Mouton's forces and the Confederate gunboat _J. A. Cotton_, received and inflicted some damage and slight losses, yet with no material result.  Simultaneously with Weitzel's movement on La Fourche, Butler pushed the 8th Vermont and the newly organized 1st Louisiana Native Guards forward from Algiers along the Opelousas Railway, to act in conjunction with Weitzel and to open the railway as they advanced. Weitzel had already turned the enemy out of his position, but the task committed to Thomas was slow and hard, for all the bridges and many"]]]
