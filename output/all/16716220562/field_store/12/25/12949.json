Ellet promptly sent a party of four volunteers, led by his young nephew, Medical Cadet Charles R. Ellet, to communicate with Farragut across the narrow neck of land opposite Vicksburg.  This was the first direct communication between the northern and southern columns.  By it Farragut learned of the abandonment of Fort Pillow by the Confederates on the 4th of June, and the capture of Memphis on the 6th, after a hard naval fight, in which nearly the whole Confederate fleet was taken or destroyed.  There Charles Ellet was mortally wounded. When the _Monarch_ party went back to their vessel, they bore with them a letter from Farragut, the contents of which being promptly made known by Ellet to Davis, brought that officer, with his fleet, at once to Vicksburg.  On the following day, June 25th, a detachment of the 4th Wisconsin, sent up the river overland by Colonel Paine, succeeded in establishing a second communication with the _Monarch_, believing it to be the first.  Farragut's fleet, now anchored below Vicksburg, comprised the flagship _Hartford_, the sloops-of-war _Brooklyn_ and _Richmond_, the corvettes _Iroquois_ and _Oneida_, and six gunboats.  Porter had joined with the _Octorara, Miami_, six other steamers, and seventeen of the mortar schooners.  The orders of the government were peremptory that the Mississippi should be cleared.  The Confederates held the river by a single thread.  The fall of Memphis and the ruin of the famous river-defence fleet left between St. Louis and the Gulf but a solitary obstruction.  This was Vicksburg.  Vicksburg stand at an abrupt turn, where within ten miles the winding river doubles upon itself, forming on the low ground opposite a long finger of land, barely three quarters of a mile wide. Opposite the extreme end of this peninsula, known as De Soto, the bluff reaches the highest point attained along the whole course of the river, the crest standing about 250 feet above the mean stage of water.  Sloping slowly toward the river, the bluff follows it with a diminished altitude for two miles.  Here stands the town of Vicksburg, then a place of about ten thousand inhabitants.  Below the town the bluffs draw away from the river until, about four miles beyond the bend, their height diminishes to about 150 feet. For the defence of this line, as has been already seen, a formidable series of batteries had been constructed, extending from the bluff at the mouth of Chickasaw Bayou on the north to Warrenton on the south.  These batteries now mounted twenty-six heavy guns, served by gunners comparatively well trained and instructed, and supported against an attack by land by about 6,000 infantry under Lovell. Almost simultaneously with the arrival of Farragut and Williams, came Breckinridge with his division, augmenting the effective force of the defenders to not less than 10,000.  On the 30th of May Beauregard evacuated Corinth and drew back to Tupelo; Halleck did not follow; and so 35,000 Confederates were now set free to strengthen Vicksburg.  Thus defended and supported Vicksburg was obviously impregnable to any attack by the combined forces of Farragut and Williams.  On the 28th of June, Van Dorn arrived and took command of the Confederate forces.  After some preliminary bombarding and reconnoitring Farragut, who was well informed as to the condition of the defences, determined upon repeating before Vicksburg his exploit below New Orleans. Accordingly, on the 28th of July, in the darkness of the early morning, under cover of the fire of Porter's mortar flotilla, Farragut got under way with his fleet to pass the batteries of Vicksburg.  The fleet was formed in two columns, with wide intervals, the starboard column led by the _Hartford_, the port column by the _Iroquois_.  The battle was opened by the mortars at four o'clock, the enemy replying instantly.  By six o'clock the _Hartford_ and six of her consorts had successfully run the gauntlet, and lay safely anchored above the bend, while the rest of the fleet, through some confusion of events or misapprehension of orders, had resumed its former position below the bend.  The losses of the navy in this engagement were fifteen killed and thirty wounded, including many scalded by the effect of a single shot that pierced the boiler of the _Clifton_.  The eight rifled guns of Nims's and Everett's batteries having been landed, were placed in position behind the levee at Barney's Point, and replied effectively to the fire of the heavy guns on the high bluff, at a range of about fourteen hundred yards.  This slight service was the only form of active co-operation by the army that the circumstances admitted; yet all the troops stood to arms, ready to do any thing that might be required.  On the 1st of July Davis joined Farragut with four gunboats and six mortar-boats of the Mississippi fleet.  On the 9th Farragut received orders from the Navy Department, dated on the 5th, and forwarded by way of Cairo, to send Porter with the _Octorara_ and twelve mortar-boats at once to Hampton Roads.  Porter steamed down the river on the 10th.  This was obviously one of the first-fruits of the campaign of the Peninsula just ended by the withdrawal of the Army of the Potomac to the James.  Indeed, at this crisis, all occasions seemed to be informing against the Union plan of campaign, and the same events that drew the Confederate armies together served to draw the Union armies apart.  Just as we have seen Pope called away from Fort Pillow on the eve of an attack that must have resulted in its capture, and taken in haste to swell the slow march of Halleck's army before Corinth, so now, when for a full month Corinth had been abandoned by the Confederates, Halleck's forces were being broken up and dispersed to all four of the winds, save that which might have blown them to the south.  Halleck declared himself unable to respond to Farragut's urgent appeal for help.  \"I cannot,\" he said, when urged by Stanton; \"I am sending reinforcements to General Curtis, in Arkansas, and to General Buell, in Tennessee and Kentucky.\" Not only this, but he was being called upon by Lincoln himself for 25,000 troops to reinforce the Army of the Potomac before Richmond. \"Probably I shall be able to do so,\" Halleck told Farragut, \"as soon as I can get my troops more concentrated.  This may delay the clearing of the river, but its accomplishment will be certain in a few weeks.\"  Meanwhile Williams was hard at work on the canal.  In addition to such details as could be furnished by the troops without wholly neglecting the absolutely necessary portions of their military duties, Williams had employed a force of about 1,200 negroes, rather poorly provided with tools.  The work was not confined to excavation, but involved the cutting down of the large cottonwoods and the clearing away of the dense masses of willows that covered the low ground and matted the heavy soil with their tangled roots.  By the 4th of July the excavation had reached a depth in the hard clay of nearly seven feet.  The length of the canal was about one and a half miles.  By the 11th of July the cut, originally intended to be four feet deep and five feet wide, with a profile of twenty square feet, had been excavated through this stiff clay to a depth of thirteen feet and a width of eighteen feet, presenting a profile of 234 feet.  The river, which, up to this time, had been falling more rapidly than the utmost exertions had been able to sink the bottom of the canal, had now begun to fall more slowly, so that at last the grade was about eighteen inches below the river level. In a few hours the water was to have been let in.  Suddenly the banks began to cave, and before any thing could be done to remedy this, the river, still falling, was once more below the bottom of the cut.  Although with this scanty and overworked force he had already performed nearly twelve times the amount of labor originally contemplated, Williams does not seem to have been discouraged at this; his orders were to make the cut, and his purpose clearly was to make it, even if it should take, as he thought it would, the whole of the next three months.  He set to work with vigor to collect laborers, wheelbarrows, shovels, axes, carts, and scrapers, and \"to make a real canal,\" to use his own words, \"to the depth of the greatest fall of the river at this point, say some thirty-five to forty feet.\"  But this was not to be.  Until toward the end of June, the _Polk_ and _Livingston_, the last vestiges of the Confederate navy on the Mississippi spared from the general wreck at Memphis, lay far up the Yazoo River, with a barrier above them, designed to cover the building of the ram _Arkansas_.  This formidable craft was approaching completion at Yazoo City.  The Ellets, uncle and nephew, with the _Monarch_ and _Lancaster_, steamed up the Yazoo River to reconnoitre.  The rams carried no armament whatever, but this the Confederate naval commander in the Yazoo did not know; so, unable to pass the barrier, he set fire to his three gunboats immediately on perceiving Ellet's approach.  On the 14th of July, Flag-Officers Farragut and Davis sent the gunboats _Carondelet_ and _Tyler_, and the ram _Queen of the West_, on a second expedition up the Yazoo to gain information of the _Arkansas_.  This object was greatly facilitated by the fact that the _Arkansas_ had at this very moment just got under way for the first time, and was coming down the Yazoo to gather information of the Federal fleet.  The _Arkansas_, which had been constructed and was now commanded by Captain Isaac N. Brown, formerly of the United States Navy, was, for defensive purposes, probably the most effective of all the gunboats ever set afloat by the Confederacy upon the western waters.  Her deck was covered"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24606"],["title","History of the Nineteenth Army Corps (#5)"],["body"," a single casemate protected by three inches of railroad iron, set aslant like a gable roof, and heavily backed up with timber and cotton bales.  Her whole bow formed a powerful ram; the shield, flat on the top, was pierced for ten guns of heavy calibre, three in each broadside, two forward, and two aft.  Had her means of propulsion proved equal to her power of attack and defence, it is doubtful if the whole Union navy on the Mississippi could have stood against her single-handed.  The situation thus strangely recalls that presented by the _Merrimac_, or _Virginia_, in Hampton Roads before the opportune arrival of the _Monitor_.  On board the _Tyler_ was a detachment of twenty sharpshooters of the 4th Wisconsin regiment, under Captain J. W. Lynn, and on the _Carondelet_ were twenty men of the 30th Massachusetts regiment, under Lieutenant E. A. Fiske.  About six miles above the Yazoo the Union gunboats encountered the _Arkansas_. The unarmed ram _Queen of the West_ promptly fled.  After a hard fight the _Carondelet_ was disabled and run ashore, and the _Tyler_ was forced to retire, with the _Arkansas_ in pursuit.  The sharpshooters of the 4th Wisconsin suffered more severely than if they had been engaged in an ordinary pitched battle, Captain Lynn and six of his men being killed and six others wounded.  The _Queen of the West_, flying out of the mouth of the Yazoo under a full head of steam, gave to the fleet at anchor the first intimation, though perhaps a feeble one, of what was to follow. Not one vessel of either squadron had steam.  The ram _Bragg_, which might have been expected to do something, did nothing.  The _Arkansas_, so seriously injured by the guns of the _Carondelet_ and _Tyler_ that the steam pressure had gone from 120 pounds to the square inch down to 20 pounds, kept on her course, and proceeded to run the gauntlet of the Union fleet, giving and taking blows as she went.  Battered, but safe, she soon lay under the guns of Vicksburg.  This decided the fate of the campaign, and extinguished in the breast of Farragut the last vestige of the ardent hope he had expressed to the government a few days earlier that he might soon have the pleasure of recording the combined attack of the army and navy, for which all so ardently longed.  The river was falling; the canal was a failure.  Of the officers and men of the army, two fifths, and of the effective force of the army nearly three fourths, were on the sick-list.  There was no longer any thing to hope for or to wait on.  The night that followed the exploit of the _Arkansas_ saw Farragut's fleet descending the river and once more running the gauntlet of the batteries of Vicksburg.  A flying attempt was made by each vessel in succession, but by all unsuccessfully, to destroy the offending _Arkansas_.  On the 24th of July, Williams, with his small force, under convoy of Farragut's fleet, sailed down the river.  So ended the second attempt on Vicksburg, usually called the first, when remembered. Its sudden collapse gave the Confederates the river for another year.   CHAPTER III. BATON ROUGE.  On the 26th of July, the troops landed at Baton Rouge.  In the five weeks that had elapsed since their departure their effective strength had been diminished, by privations, by severe labor, and by the effects of a deadly climate, from 3,200 to about 800.  For more than three months, ever since their re-embarkation at Ship Island on the 10th of April, they had undergone hardships such as have seldom fallen to the lot of soldiers, in a campaign whose existence is scarcely known and whose name has been wellnigh forgotten; but their time for rest and recreation had not yet come.  No sooner did Van Dorn see the allied fleets of Davis and Farragut turning their backs on one another and steaming one to the north and the other to the south, than he determined to take the initiative. His preparations had been already made in anticipation of this event.  He now ordered Breckinridge to hasten with his division to the attack of Baton Rouge, and even as the fleet got under way, the train bearing Breckinridge's troops was also in motion.  Breckinridge received his orders on the 26th, and arrived at Camp Moore by the railway on the 28th.  At Jackson he had been told that he would receive rations sufficient for ten days, but he could get no more than half the quantity.  Van Dorn had estimated the Union force to be met at Baton Rouge as about 5,000, and had calculated that Breckinridge would find himself strong enough to dislodge the Union army and drive it away.  In fact, Van Dorn estimated Breckinridge's division, including 1,000 men under Brigadier-General Ruggles that were to meet him at Camp Moore, at 6,000 men.  The _Arkansas_ was to join in the attack, and she was justly considered a full offset to any naval force the Union commander would be likely to have stationed at Baton Rouge.  Breckinridge left Vicksburg with less than 4,000.  On the 30th of July he reports his total effective force, including Ruggles, at 3,600.  The same day he marched on Baton Rouge, and on the 4th of August encamped at the crossing of the Comite, distant about ten miles from his objective.  His morning report of that day shows but 3,000 effectives, according to the methods by which effective strength was commonly counted by the Confederates.  The distance from Camp Moore to Baton Rouge is about sixty miles, and the march had been thus retarded to await the co-operation of the _Arkansas_.  This Breckinridge was finally assured he might expect at daylight on the morning of the 5th of August.  The _Arkansas_ had in fact left Vicksburg on the 3d.  Van Dorn's object obviously was by crushing Williams to regain control of the Mississippi from Vicksburg to Baton Rouge, to break the blockade of Red River and to open the way for the recapture of New Orleans.  Williams was expecting the attack and awaited the result with calmness.  At Baton Rouge the Mississippi washes for the last time the base of the high and steep bluffs that for so many hundreds of miles have followed the coasts of the great river and formed the contour of its left bank, overlooking its swift yellow waters and the vast lowlands of the western shore.  The bluff is lower at Baton Rouge than it is above and slopes more gently to the water's edge; and here the highland draws back from the river and gradually fades away in a southeasterly direction toward the Gulf, while the surface of the country becomes more open and less broken.  The stiff post-tertiary clays that compose the soil of these bluffs were in many places covered with a rich growth of timber, great magnolias and beautiful live oaks replacing the rank cottonwood and tangled willows of the lowlands, as well as the giant cypresses of the impenetrable swamps, with their mournful hangings of Spanish moss, and the wild grape binding them fast in a deadly embrace.  Six roads led out of the town in various directions.  Of these the most northerly was the road from Bayou Sara.  Passing behind the town its course continued toward the south along the river.  Between these outstretched arms ran the road to Clinton, the Greenwell Springs road, by which the Confederates had come, the Perkins road, and the Clay Cut road.  In numbers the opposing forces were nearly equal.  The Confederates went into action with about 2,600, without counting the partisan rangers and militia, numbering 400 or 500 more.  Williams had about 2,500 fighting men.  He had eighteen guns, the Confederates eleven. On both sides the men were enfeebled by malaria and exposure; yet the Confederates had left their sick behind, while the Union force included convalescents that came out of the hospital to take part in the battle.  \"There were not 1,200,\" said Weitzel after the battle, \"who could have marched five miles.  None of our men had been in battle; very few had been under fire.\"  Among the Confederates were many of the veterans of Shiloh and more of the triumphant defenders of Vicksburg.  The advantages of position was slight on either side.  On the one hand Williams was forced to post his left with regard to the expected attack of the _Arkansas_, so that in the centre his line fell behind the camps.  To offset this his right rested securely on the gunboats.  As it turned out the _Arkansas_ was not encountered, and the gunboats told off to meet her were therefore able to render material assistance on the left by their oblique fire across Williams' front.  Breckinridge commanded four picked brigades, three selected from his own division and one of Martin L. Smith's Vicksburg brigades, the whole organized in two divisions, under Brigadier-Generals Charles Clark and Daniel Ruggles.  Clark had the brigades of Brigadier-General Bernard H. Helm and Colonel Thomas B. Smith, of the 20th Tennessee, with the Hudson battery and Cobb's battery. Ruggles had the brigades of Colonel A. P. Thompson, of the 3d Kentucky, and Colonel Henry W. Allen, of the 4th Louisiana, with Semmes's battery.  From right to left the order of attack ran, Helm, Smith, Thompson, Allen.  Clark moved on the right of the Greenwell Springs road, and Ruggles on the left.  Scott's cavalry was posted on the extreme left, four guns of Semmes's battery occupied the centre of Ruggles's division, while in Clark's centre were the four guns of the Hudson battery and one of Cobb's; the other two having been disabled in a panic during the night march before the battle.  On the extreme right the Clinton road was picketed and held by a detachment of infantry and rangers and the remaining section of Semmes's battery.  To meet the expected attack, Williams had posted his troops in rear of the arsenal and of the town, occupying an irregular line, generally parallel to the Bayou Sara road, and extending from the Bayou Grosse, on the left, to and beyond the intersection of the Perkins and Clay Cut roads, on the right.  On the extreme left, behind the Bayou Grosse, was the 4th"]]]
