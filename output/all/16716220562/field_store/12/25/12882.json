A kind you might      not think to look for....   Illustrated by Schelling  [Illustration]        _Walking home in the dark from an evening spent in mischief, a      young man spied coming toward him down the road a person with      a lamp. When the wayfarers drew abreast, the play-boy saw that      the other traveler was the Blind Man from his village. \"Blind      Man,\" the youngster shouted across the road, \"what a fool you      be! Why, old No-Eyes, do you bear a lantern, you whose midnight      is no darker than his noonday?\" The Blind Man lifted his lamp.      \"It is not as a light for myself that I carry this, Boy,\" he      said, \"it is to warn off you fools with eyes.\"_       --_Hausa proverb_    The Captain shook hands with the black-hatted Amishman while the woman stood aside, not concerning herself with men's business. \"It's been a pleasure to have you and _Fraa_ Stoltzfoos aboard, Aaron,\" the Captain said. \"Ship's stores are yours, my friend; if there's anything you need, take it and welcome. You're a long way from the corner grocery.\"  \"My Martha and I have all that's needful,\" Aaron Stoltzfoos said. \"We have our plow, our seed, our land. Captain, please tell your men, who treated us strangers as honored guests, we thank them from our hearts. We'll not soon forget their kindness.\"  \"I'll tell them,\" the Captain promised. Stoltzfoos hoisted himself to the wagon seat and reached a hand down to boost his wife up beside him. Martha Stoltzfoos sat, blushing a bit for having displayed an accidental inch of black stocking before the ship's officers. She smoothed down her black skirts and apron, patted the candle-snuffer _Kapp_ into place over her prayer-covering, and tucked the wool cape around her arms and shoulders. The world outside, her husband said, was a cold one.  Now in the Stoltzfoos wagon was the final lot of homestead goods with which these two Amishers would battle the world of Murna. There was the plow and bags of seed, two crates of nervous chickens; a huge, round tabletop; an alcohol-burning laboratory incubator, bottles of agar-powder, and a pressure cooker that could can vegetables as readily as it could autoclave culture-media. There was a microscope designed to work by lamplight, as the worldly vanity of electric light would ill suit an Old Order bacteriologist like Martha Stoltzfoos. Walled in by all this gear was another passenger due to debark on Murna, snuffling and grunting with impatience. \"_Sei schtill_, Wutzchen,\" Stoltzfoos crooned. \"You'll be in your home pen soon enough.\"  The Captain raised his hand. The Engineer punched a button to tongue the landing ramp out to Murnan earth. Cold air rammed in from the outside winter. The four horses stomped their hoofs on the floor-plates, their breath spikes of steam. Wutzchen squealed dismay as the chill hit his nose.  \"We're _reddi far geh_, Captain,\" Stoltzfoos said. \"My woman and I invite you and your men to feast at our table when you're back in these parts, five years hence. We'll stuff you fat as sausages with onion soup and Pannhaas, Knepp and Ebbelkuche, shoo-fly pie and _scharifer_ cider, if the folk here grow apples fit for squeezing.\"  \"You'll have to set up planks outdoors to feed the lot I'll be bringing, Aaron,\" the Captain said. \"Come five-years' springtime, when I bring your Amish neighbors out, I'll not forget to have in my pockets a toot of candy for the little Stoltzes I'll expect to see underfoot.\" Martha, whose English was rusty, blushed none the less. Aaron grinned as he slapped the reins over the rumps of his team. \"Giddap!\" The cart rumbled across the deck and down the ramp, onto the soil of Murna. Yonnie, the Ayrshire bull, tossed his head and sat as the rope tightened on his noseband. He skidded stubbornly down the ramp till he felt cold earth against his rear. Accepting fate, Yonnie scrambled up and plodded after the wagon. As the Stoltzfooses and the last of their off-worldly goods topped a hillock, they both turned to wave at the ship's officers. Then, veiled by the dusty fall of snow, they disappeared.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I don't envy them,\" the Engineer said, staring out into the wintery world.  \"Hymie, were you born in a barn?\" the Exec bellowed.  \"Sorry, sir.\" The Engineer raised the landing ramp. Heaters hummed to thaw the hold's air. \"I was thinking about how alone those two folks are now.\"  \"Hardly alone,\" the Captain said. \"There are four million Murnans, friendly people who consider a white skin no more than a personal idiosyncrasy. Aaron's what his folks call a _Chentelmaan_, too. He'll get along.\"  \"Chentelmaan-schmentelmaan,\" the Engineer said. \"Why'd he come half across Creation to scratch out a living with a horse-drawn plow?\"  \"He came out here for dirt,\" the Captain said. \"Soil is more than seed-bed to the Amish. It feeds the Old Order they're born to. Aaron and Martha Stoltzfoos would rather have built their barns beside the Susquehanna, but all the land there's taken. Aaron could have taken a job in Lancaster, too; he could have shaved off his beard, bought a Chevie and moved to the suburbs, and settled down to read an English-language Bible in a steepled church. Instead, he signed a homestead-contract for a hundred acres eighty light-years from home; and set out to plow the land like his grandpop did. He'll sweat hard for his piece of Murna, but the Amish always pay well for their land.\"  \"And what do we, the government, I mean, get from the deal?\" the Exec wanted to know. \"This wagon of ours doesn't run on hay, like Aaron's does.\"  \"Cultures skid backwards when they're transplanted,\" the Captain said. \"Murnan culture was lifted from Kano, a modern city by the standards of the time; but, without tools and with a population too small to support technology, the West African apostates from Islam who landed here four hundred years ago slid back to the ways of their grandparents. We want them to get up to date again. We want Murna to become a market. That's Aaron's job. Our Amishman has got to start this planet back toward the machine age.\"  \"Seems an odd job to give a fellow who won't drive a car or read by electric light,\" the Engineer observed.  \"Not so odd,\" the Captain said. \"The Amish pretty much invented American agriculture, you know. They've developed the finest low-energy farming there is. Clover-growing, crop-rotation, using animal manures, those are their inventions. Aaron, by his example, will teach the natives here Pennsylvania farming. Before you can say Tom Malthus, there'll be steel cities in this wilderness, filled with citizens eager to open charge accounts for low-gravs and stereo sets.\"  \"You expect our bearded friend to reap quite a harvest, Captain,\" the Engineer said. \"I just hope the natives here let him plant the seed.\"  \"Did you get along with him, Hymie?\"  \"Sure,\" the Engineer said. \"Aaron even made our smiths, those human sharks bound for Qureysh, act friendly. For all his strange ways, he's a nice guy.\"  \"Nice guy, hell,\" the Captain said. \"He's a genius. That seventeenth-century un-scientist has more feeling for folkways in his calloused left hand than you'd find in all the Colonial Survey. How do you suppose the Old Order maintains itself in Pennsylvania, a tiny Deitsch-speaking enclave surrounded by calico suburbs and ten-lane highways? They mind their business and leave the neighbors to theirs. The Amish have never been missionaries--they learned in 1600 that missionaries are resented, and either slaughtered or absorbed.\"  \"Sometimes digestively,\" the Engineer remarked.  \"Since the Thirty Years' War, back when 'Hamlet' was opening in London, these people have been breeding a man who can fit one special niche in society. The failures were killed in the early days, or later went gay and took the trappings of the majority. The successes stayed on the farm, respected and left alone. Aaron has flirted with our century; he and his wife learned some very un-Amish skills at the Homestead School. The skill that makes Aaron worth his fare out here, though, is an Amish skill, and the rarest one of all. He knows the Right Way to Live, and lives it; but he knows, too, that your Truth-of-the Universe is something different. And right, for you. He's quite a man, our Aaron Stoltzfoos. That's why we dropped him here.\"  \"Better him than me,\" the Engineer said.  \"Precisely,\" the Captain said. He turned to the Exec. \"As soon as we've lifted, ask Colonel Harris to call on me in my cabin, Gene. Our Marines had better fresh-up their swordsmanship and cavalry tactics if they're to help our Inad Tuaregs establish that foundry on Qureysh.\"  \"It sometimes seems you're more Ship's Anthropologist than Captain,\" the Engineer remarked.  \"I'm an anthro-apologist, Hymie, like Mr. Kipling,\" the Captain said. \"_There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays. And--every--single--one--of--them--is--right!_\" Bells rang, and the ship surged. \"Aaron and Martha, God keep you,\" the Captain said.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Whoa!\" Aaron shouted. He peered back toward the ship, floating up into grayness, the cavitation of her wake stirring the snow into patterns like fine-veined marble. \"_Gott saygen eich_,\" he said, a prayer for his departing friends.  His wife shivered. \"It's cold enough to freeze the horns off a mooley-cow,\" she said. She glanced about at the snow-drifted little trees and clutched her black cloak tighter. \"I'm feared, Stoltz. There's naught about us now but snow and black heathen.\"  \"It's fear that is the heathen,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24567"],["title","Blind Man's Lantern (#1)"],["body","said. \"_By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and the host of them by the breath of His mouth._\" He kissed her. \"I welcome you to our new homeland, wife,\" he said.  Behind them Wutzchen--\"piglet\"--grunted. Martha smiled back at the giant porker, perched amongst the cases and bags and household goods like the victim of some bawdy chiavari. \"I've never heard a pig mutter so,\" she said.  \"If he knew that his business here was to flatter the local lady-pigs with farrow, Wutzchen would hop out and run,\" Aaron said.  \"_Dummel dich_, Stoltz,\" Martha said. \"I've got to make your supper yet, and we don't have so much as a stove lit in our tent.\"  Stoltzfoos slapped the team back into motion. \"What we need for our journey home are a few of the _altie lieder_,\" he said, reaching back in the wagon for his scarred guitar. He strummed and hummed, then began singing in his clear baritone: \"_In da guut alt Suumer-zeit_ ...  \"... _In da guut alt Suumer-zeit_,\" Martha's voice joined him. As they jolted along the path through the pine trees, heading toward Datura-village, near which their homestead stood, they sang the other homey songs to the music of the old guitar. \"_Drawk Mich Zrick zu Alt Virginye_,\" nostalgic for the black-garbed Plain-Folk left at home. Then Aaron's fingers danced a livelier tune on the strings: \"_Ich fang 'n neie Fashun aw_,\" he crowed, and Martha joined in:  \"A new fashion I'll begin,\" they sang,  \"The hay I'll cut in the winter;  \"When the sun-heat beats, I'll loaf in the shade.  \"And feast on cherry-pie.  \"I'll get us a white, smearkase cow,  \"And a yard full of guinea-hen geese;  \"A red-beet tree as high as the moon,  \"And a patent-leather fence.  \"The chickens I'll keep in the kitchen,\" they sang; whereupon Martha broke down laughing.  \"It's a new world, and for now a cold world; but it's God's world, with home just up ahead,\" Aaron shouted. He pulled the wagon up next to the arctic tent that was to be their temporary farmhouse, beside the wagon loads of provision he'd brought before. He jumped down and swung Martha to earth. \"Light the stove, woman; make your little kitchen bright, while I make our beasts feel welcome.\"  The Amishwoman pushed aside the entrance flap of the tent. Enclosed was a circle some twelve feet wide. The floor was bare earth. Once warmed by the pump-up \"naptha\" lantern and the gasoline hotplate, it would become a bog. Martha went out to the wagon to get a hatchet and set out for the nearby spinny of pines to trim off some twigs. Old Order manner forbid decorative floor-coverings as improper worldly show; but a springy carpet of pine-twigs could be considered as no more than a wooden floor, keeping two Plain Folk from sinking to their knees in mud.  The pots were soon boiling atop the two-burner stove, steaming the tent's air with onion-tangy _tzvivvele Supp_ and the savory pork-smell of _Schnitz un Knepp_, a cannibal odor that disturbed not a bit Wutzchen, snoring behind the cookstove. Chickens, penned beneath the bed, chuckled in their bedtime caucus. The cow stood cheek-by-jowl with Yonnie, warming him with platonic graciousness as they shared the hay Aaron had spread before them. Martha stirred her soup. \"When the bishop married me to you,\" she told Aaron, \"he said naught of my having to sleep with a pig.\"  \"Ah, but I thought you knew that to be the purpose of Christian marriage, woman,\" Aaron said, standing close.  \"It's Wutz I mean,\" she said. \"Truly, I mind not a bit living as in one of those automobile-wagons, since it's with you, and only for a little while.\"  \"I'll hire a crew of our neighbors to help with the barn tomorrow,\" Aaron said. \"That done, you'll have but one pig to sleep with.\"  After grace, they sat on cases of tobacco to eat their meal from a table of feed sacks covered with oilcloth. \"The man in the ship's little kitchen let me make and freeze pies, Stoltz,\" Martha said. \"He said we'd have a deepfreeze big as all outdoors, without electric, so use it. Eat till it's all, _Maan_; there's more back.\"  Yonnie bumped against Aaron's eating-elbow. \"No man and his wife have eaten in such a zoo since Noah and his wife left the ark,\" Aaron said. He cut a slice of Schnitz-pie and palmed it against the bull's big snout to be snuffled up. \"He likes your cooking,\" he said.  \"So wash his face,\" Martha told him.         *       *       *       *       *  Outside the tent there was a clatter of horse-iron on frozen ground. \"What the die-hinker is that?\" Aaron demanded. He stood and picked up the naphtha lantern.  Outside, Aaron saw a tall black stranger, astride a horse as pale as the little Murnan moons that lighted him. \"_Rankeshi dade!_\" the visitor bellowed.  \"May your life be a long one!\" Aaron Stoltzfoos repeated in Hausa. Observing that his caller was brandishing a clenched fist, the Amishman observed the same ambiguous courtesy. \"If you will enter, O Welcome Stranger, my house will be honored.\"  [Illustration]  \"Mother bless thee, Bearded One,\" the Murnan said. He dismounted, tossing his reins to one of the four retainers who remained on horseback. He entered the tent after Aaron; and stared about him at the animals, letting his dark eyes flick across Martha's unveiled face. At the Amishman's invitation, the visitor sat himself on a tobacco case, revealing as he crossed his legs elaborately embroidered trousers and boot tops worked with designs that would dazzle a Texan. Martha bustled about hiding the remains of their meal.  The Murnan's outer dress was a woolen _riga_, the neckless gown of his West-African forefathers, with a blanket draped about his shoulders, exactly as those ancestors had worn one in the season of the cold wind called harmattan. Aaron introduced himself as Haruna, the Hausa version of his name; and the guest made himself known as Sarki--Chief--of the village of Datura. His given name was Kazunzumi. Wutzchen snuffled in his sleep. The Sarki glanced at the huge pig and smiled. Aaron relaxed a bit. The Islamic interdict on swine had been shed by the Murnans when they'd become apostates, just as Colonial Survey had guessed.  Stoltzfoos' Hausa, learned at the Homestead School at Georgetown University, proved adequate to its first challenge in the field, though he discovered, with every experimenter in a new language, that his most useful phrase was _magana sanoo-sanoo_: \"please speak slowly.\" Aaron let the Chief commence the desultory conversation that would precede talk of consequence. Martha, ignored by the men, sat on the edge of the bed, reading the big German-language Bible. Aaron and Kazunzumi sang on in the heathen tongue about weather, beasts, and field-crops.  The Sarki leaned forward to examine Aaron's beard and shaven upper lip, once; and smiled. The Murnan does not wear such. He looked at Martha more casually now, seeing that the husband was not disgraced by his wife's naked face; and remarked on the whiteness of her skin in the same tones he'd mentioned Wutzchen's remarkable girth.  Aaron asked when the snows would cease, when the earth would thaw. The Sarki told him, and said that the land here was as rich as manure. Gradually the talk worked round to problems involving carpenters, nails, lumber, hinges--and money. Aaron was pleased to discover that the natives thought nothing of digging a cellar and raising a barn in midwinter, and that workers could be easily hired.  Suddenly Sarki Kazunzumi stood and slapped his palms together. The tent flap was shoved open. Bowed servants, who'd shivered outside for over an hour, placed their master's presents on the sack table, on the twig floor, even beside Martha on the bed. There were iron knives, a roast kid, a basket of peanuts, a sack of roasted coffee beans, a string of dried fruit, and a tiny earthware flask of perfume. There was even a woolen riga for Aaron, black, suggesting that the Survey had said a bit to the natives about Amish custom; and there were bolts of bright-patterned cloth too worldly for aught but quilts and infant-dresses, brightening Martha's eyes.  Aaron stood to accept the guest gifts with elaborate thanks. Sarki Kazunzumi as elaborately bemeaned his offerings. \"Musa the carpenter will appear on tomorrow's tomorrow,\" he said. \"You will, the Mother willing, visit me in Datura tomorrow. We will together purchase lumber worthy of my friend-neighbor's barn-making. May the Mother give you strength to farm, Haruna! May the Mother grant you the light of understanding!\"  \"_Sannu, sannu!_\" Stoltzfoos responded. He stood at the door of his tent, holding his lantern high to watch the Sarki and his servants ride off into the darkness.         *       *       *       *       *  \"_Er iss en groesie Fisch, nee?_\" Martha asked.  \"The biggest fish in these parts,\" Aaron agreed. \"Did you understand our talk?\"  \"The heathen speech is hard for me to learn, Stoltz,\" Martha admitted, speaking in the dialect they'd both been reared to. \"While you had only the alien speech to study, I spent my time learning to grow the buglets and tell the various sorts apart. Besides, _unser guutie Deitschie Schproech, asz unser Erlayser schwetzt, iss guut genunk fa mier_.\" (Our honest German tongue, that our Saviour spoke, is good enough for me).  Aaron laughed. \"So _altfashuned_ a _Maedel_ I married,\" he said. \"Woman, you must learn the Hausa, too. We must be friends to these _Schwotzers_, as we were friends with the English-speakers back in the United Schtayts.\" He pushed aside the bolt of Murnan cloth to sit beside his wife, and leafed through the pages of their _Familien-Bibel_, pages lovingly worn by his father's fingers, and his grandfather's. \"Listen,\" he commanded:  \"_For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not "]]]
