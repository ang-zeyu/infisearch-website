Now, Peter Rabbit, what are the differences between Striped Chipmunk and his cousins, the Tree Squirrels?”  Peter looked very hard at Striped Chipmunk as if he had never really seen him before.  “He is smaller than they are,” began Peter.  “In fact, he is the smallest Squirrel I know.”  Peter paused.  Old Mother Nature nodded encouragingly.  “Go on,” said she.  “He wears a striped coat,” continued Peter.  “The stripes are black and yellowish-white and run along his sides, a black stripe running down the middle of his back.  The rest of his coat is reddish-brown above and light underneath.  His tail is rather thin and flat.  I never see him in the trees, so I guess he can't climb.”  “Oh, yes, I can,” interrupted Striped Chipmunk.  “I can climb if I want to, and I do sometimes, but prefer the ground.”  “Go on, Peter,” said Old Mother Nature.  “He seems to like old stone walls and rock piles,” continued Peter, “and he is one of the brightest, liveliest, merriest and the most lovable of all my friends.”  “Thank you, Peter,” said Striped Chipmunk softly.  “I never have been able to find his home,” continued Peter.  “That is one of his secrets.  But I know it is in the ground.  I guess this is all I know about him.  I should say the chief difference between Striped Chipmunk and the Tree Squirrels is that he spends all his time on the ground while the others live largely in the trees.”  “Very good, Peter,” said Old Mother Nature.  “But there are two very important differences which you have not mentioned.  Striped Chipmunk has a big pocket on the inside of each cheek, while his cousins of the trees have no pockets at all.”  “Of course,” cried Peter.  “I don't see how I came to forget that. I've laughed many times at Striped Chipmunk with those pockets stuffed with nuts or seeds until his head looked three times bigger than it does now.  Those pockets must be very handy.”  “They are,” replied Striped Chipmunk.  “I couldn't get along without them.  They save me a lot of running back and forth, I can tell you.”  “And the other great difference,” said Old Mother Nature, “is that Striped Chipmunk sleeps nearly all winter, just waking up occasionally to pop his head out on a bright day to see how the weather is.  A great many folks call Striped Chipmunk a Ground Squirrel, but more properly he is a Rock Squirrel because he likes stony places best.  Supposing, Striped Chipmunk, you tell us where and how you make your home.”  “I make my home down in the ground,” replied Striped Chipmunk.  “I dig a tunnel just big enough to run along comfortably.  Down deep enough to be out of reach of Jack Frost I make a nice little bedroom with a bed of grass and leaves, and I make another little room for a storeroom in which to keep my supply of seeds and nuts. Sometimes I have more than one storeroom.  Also I have some little side tunnels.”  “But why is it I never have been able to find the entrance to your tunnel?” asked Peter, as full of curiosity as ever.  “Because I have it hidden underneath the stone wall on the edge of the Old Orchard,” replied Striped Chipmunk.  “But even then, I should think that all the sand you must have taken out would give your secret away,” cried Peter.  Striped Chipmunk chuckled happily.  It was a throaty little chuckle, pleasant to hear.  “I looked out for that,” said he.  “There isn't a grain of that sand around my doorway.  I took it all out through another hole some distance away, a sort of back door, and then closed it up solidly.  If you please, Mother Nature, if I am not a Ground Squirrel, who is?”  “Your cousin, Seek Seek the Spermophile, sometimes called Gopher Squirrel, who lives on the open plains of the West where there are no rocks or stones.  He likes best the flat, open country.  He is called Spermophile because that means seed-eater, and he lives largely on seeds, especially on grain.  Because of this he does a great deal of damage and is much disliked by farmers.  “Seek Seek's family are the true Ground Squirrels.  Please remember that they never should be called Gophers, for they are not Gophers. One of the smallest members of the family is just about your size, Striped Chipmunk, and he also wears stripes, only he has more of them than you have, and they are broken up into little dots.  He is called the Thirteen-lined Spermophile.  He has pockets in his cheeks just as you have, and he makes a home down in the ground very similar to yours.  All the family do this, and all of them sleep through the winter.  While they are great seed-eaters they also eat a great many insects and worms, and some of them even are guilty of killing and eating the babies of birds that nest on the ground, and also young mice.  “Some members of the family are almost as big as Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and have gray coats.  They are called Gray Ground Squirrels and sometimes Gray Gophers.  One of the largest of these is the California Ground Squirrel.  He has a big, bushy tail, very like Happy Jack's.  He gets into so much mischief in the grain fields and in the orchards that he is quite as much disliked as is Jack Rabbit.  This particular member of the family is quite as much at home among rocks and tree roots as in open ground.  He climbs low trees for fruit and nuts, but prefers to stay on the ground.  Now just remember that the Chipmunks are Rock Squirrels and their cousins the Spermophiles are Ground Squirrels.  Now who of you has seen Timmy the Flying Squirrel lately?”  “I haven't,” said Peter Rabbit.  “I haven't,” said Striped Chipmunk.  “I haven't,” said Happy Jack.  “I haven't,” said Chatterer.  “I have,” spoke up Jumper the Hare.  “I saw him last evening just after jolly, round, red Mr. Sun went to bed behind the Purple Hills and the Black Shadows came creeping through the Green Forest.  My, I wish I could fly the way he can!”  Old Mother Nature shook her head disapprovingly.  “Jumper,” said she, “what is wrong with your eyes?  When did you ever see Timmy fly?”  “Last night,” insisted Jumper stubbornly.  “Oh, no, you didn't,” retorted Old Mother Nature.  “You didn't see him fly, for the very good reason that he cannot fly any more than you can.  You saw him simply jump.  Just remember that the only animals in this great land who can fly are the Bats.  Timmy the Flying Squirrel simply jumps from the top of a tree and slides down on the air to the foot of another tree.  If you had used your eyes you would have noticed that when he is in the air he never moves his legs or arms, and he is always coming down, never going up, excepting for a little at the end of his jump, as would be the case if he could really fly.  He hasn't any wings.”  “When he's flying, I mean jumping, he looks as if he had wings,”  insisted Jumper stubbornly.  “That is simply because I have given him a fold of skin between the front and hind leg on each side,” explained Old Mother Nature. “When he jumps he stretches his legs out flat, and that stretches out those two folds of skin until they look almost like wings. This is the reason he can sail so far when he jumps from a high place.  You've seen a bird, after flapping its wings to get going, sail along with them outstretched and motionless.  Timmy does the same thing, only he gets going by jumping.  You may have noticed that he usually goes to the top of a tree before jumping; then he can sail down a wonderfully long distance.  His tail helps him to keep his balance.  If there is anything in the way, he can steer himself around it.  When he reaches the tree he is jumping for he shoots up a little way and lands on the trunk not far above the ground.  Then he scampers up that tree to do it all over again.”  “But why don't we ever see him?” inquired Striped Chipmunk.  “Because, when the rest of you squirrels are out and about, he is curled up in a little ball in his nest, fast asleep.  Timmy likes the night, especially the early evening, and doesn't like the light of day.”  “How big is he?” asked Happy Jack, and looked a little sheepish as if he were a wee bit ashamed of not being acquainted with one of his own cousins.  “He is, if anything, a little smaller than Striped Chipmunk,”  replied Old Mother Nature.  “Way out in the Far West he grows a little bigger.  His coat is a soft yellowish-brown above; beneath he is all white.  His fur is wonderfully soft.  He has very large, dark, soft eyes, especially suited for seeing at night.  Then, he is very lively and dearly loves to play.  By nature he is gentle and lovable.”  “Does he eat nuts like his cousins?” asked Peter Rabbit.  “He certainly does,” replied Old Mother Nature.  “Also he eats grubs and insects.  He dearly loves a fat beetle.  He likes meat when he can get it.”  “Where does he make his home?” Peter inquired.  “Usually in a hole in a tree,” said Old Mother Nature.  “He is very fond of an old home of a Woodpecker.  He makes a comfortable nest of bark lining, grass, and moss, or any other soft material he can find.  Occasionally he builds an outside nest high up in a fork in the branches of a tree.  He likes to get into old buildings.”  “Does he have many enemies?” asked Happy Jack.  “The same enemies the rest of you have,” replied Old Mother Nature. “But the one he has most reason to fear is Hooty the Owl, and that is the one you have least reason to fear, because Hooty seldom hunts by day.”  “Does he sleep all winter?” piped up Striped Chipmunk.  “Not as you do,” said Old Mother Nature.  “In very cold weather he sleeps, but if he happens to be living where the weather does not get very cold, he is active all the year around.  Now I guess this is enough about the Squirrel family.”  “You've forgotten Johnny Chuck,” cried Peter.  Old Mother Nature laughed.  “So I have,” said she.  “That will"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2441"],["title","The Burgess Animal Book for Children (#7)"],["body","do, never in the world.  Johnny and his relatives, the Marmots, certainly cannot be overlooked.  We will take them for our lesson to-morrow.  Peter, you tell Johnny Chuck to come over here to-morrow morning.”    CHAPTER VII  Johnny Chuck Joins the Class  Peter Rabbit delivered Mother Nature's message to Johnny Chuck. Johnny didn't seem at all pleased.  He grumbled and growled to himself.  He didn't want to go to school.  He didn't want to learn anything about his relatives.  He was perfectly satisfied with things as they were.  The truth is, Johnny Chuck was already beginning to get fat with good living and he is naturally lazy. As a rule he can find plenty to eat very near his home, so he seldom goes far from his own doorstep.  Peter left him grumbling and growling, and chuckled to himself all the way back to the dear Old Briar-patch.  He knew that Johnny Chuck would not dare disobey Old Mother Nature.  Sure enough, the next morning Johnny Chuck came waddling through the Green Forest just as Old Mother Nature was about to open school. He didn't look at all happy, and he didn't reply at all to the greetings of the others.  But when Old Mother Nature spoke to him he was very polite.  “Good morning, Johnny Chuck,” said she.  Johnny bobbed his head and said, “Good morning.”  “I understand,” continued Old Mother Nature, “That you are not at all interested in learning about your relatives.  I am sorry for any one who doesn't want to learn.  The more one knows the better fitted he is to take care of himself and do his part in the work of the Great World.  However, it wasn't for your benefit that I sent word for you to be here this morning.  It was for the benefit of your friends and neighbors.  Now sit up so that all can get a good look at you.”  Johnny Chuck obediently sat up, and of course all the others stared at him.  It made him feel quite uncomfortable.  “You remember,”  said Old Mother Nature, “how surprised you little folks were when I told you that Johnny Chuck is a member of the Squirrel family. Happy Jack, you go sit beside Johnny Chuck, and the rest of you look hard at Happy Jack and Johnny and see if you do not see a family resemblance.”  Seeing Happy Jack and Johnny Chuck sitting up side by side, Peter Rabbit caught the resemblance at once.  There was sort of family look about them.  “Why!  Why-ee!  Johnny Chuck does look like a Squirrel,” he exclaimed.  “Of course he looks like a Squirrel, because he is one,” said Old Mother Nature.  “Johnny Chuck is very much bigger and so stout in the body that he has none of the gracefulness of the true Squirrels. But you will notice that the shape of his head is much the same as that of Happy Jack.  He has a Squirrel face when you come to look at him closely.  The Woodchucks, sometimes called Ground Hogs, though why any one should call them this is more than I can understand, belong to the Marmot branch of the Squirrel family, and wherever found they look much alike.  “As you will notice, Johnny Chuck's coat is brownish-yellow, his feet are very dark brown, almost black.  His head is dark brown with light gray on his cheeks.  Beneath he is reddish-orange, including his throat.  His tail is short for a member of the Squirrel family, and although it is bushy, it is not very big.  He has a number of whiskers and they are black.  Some Woodchucks are quite gray, and occasionally there is one who is almost, or wholly black, just as there are black Gray Squirrels.  “Johnny, here, is not fond of the Green Forest, but loves the Old orchard and the Green Meadows.  In some parts of the country there are members of his family who prefer to live just on the edge of the Green Forest.  You will notice that Johnny has stout claws.  Those are to help him dig, for all the Marmot family are great diggers. What other use do you have for those claws, Johnny?”  “They help me to climb,” replied Johnny promptly.  “Climb!” exclaimed Peter Rabbit.  “Who ever heard of a Woodchuck climbing?”  “I can climb if I have to,” retorted Johnny Chuck indignantly.  “I've climbed up bushes and low trees lots of times, and if I can get a good run first, I can climb up the straight trunk of a tree with rough bark to the first branches--if they are not too far above ground.  You ask Reddy Fox if I can't; he knows.”  “That's quite true, Johnny,” said Old Mother Nature.  “You can climb a little, but as a real climber you are not much of a success.  You are better as a digger.”  “He certainly is all right as a digger,” exclaimed Peter Rabbit. “My, how he can make the sand fly!  Johnny Chuck certainly is right at home when it comes to digging.”  “You ought to be thankful that he is,” said Old Mother Nature, “for the holes he has dug have saved your life more than once.  By the way, Peter, since you are so well acquainted with those holes, suppose you tell us what kind of a home Johnny Chuck has.”  Peter was delighted to air his knowledge.  “The last one I was in,”  said he, “was a long tunnel slanting down for quite a distance and then straightening out.  The entrance was quite large with a big heap of sand out in front of it.  Down a little way the tunnel grew smaller and then remained the same size all the rest of the way. Way down at the farther end was a nice little bedroom with some grass in it.  There were one or two other little rooms, and there were two branch tunnels leading up to the surface of the ground, making side or back doorways.  There was no sand around either of these, and they were quite hidden by the long grass hanging over them.  I don't understand how Johnny made those doorways without leaving any sand on the doorsteps.”  “Huh!” interrupted Johnny Chuck.  “That was easy enough.  I pushed all the sand out of the main doorway so that there would be nothing to attract the attention of any one passing near those back doorways. Those back doorways are very handy in time of danger.”  “Do you always have three doorways?” asked Happy Jack.  “No,” replied Johnny Chuck.  “Sometimes I have only two and once in a while only one.  But that isn't really safe, and I mean always to have at least two.”  “Do you use the same house year after year?” piped up Striped Chipmunk.  Johnny shook his head.  “No,” said he.  “I dig a new hole each spring. Mrs. Chuck and I like a change of scene.  Usually my new home isn't very far from my old one, because I am not fond of traveling. Sometimes, however, if we cannot find a place that just suits us, we go quite a distance.”  “Are your babies born down in that little bedroom in the ground?”  asked Jumper the Hare.  “Of course,” replied Johnny Chuck.  “Where else would they be born?”  “I didn't know but Mrs. Chuck might make a nest on the ground the way Mrs. Peter and Mrs. Jumper do,” replied Jumper meekly.  “No, siree!” replied Johnny.  “Our babies are born in that little underground bedroom, and they stay down in the ground until they are big enough to hunt for food for themselves.”  “How many do you usually have?” inquired Chatterer the Red Squirrel.  “Six or eight,” replied Johnny Chuck.  “Mrs. Chuck and I believe in large families.”  “Do you eat nuts like the rest of our family?” inquired Striped Chipmunk.  “No,” replied Johnny Chuck.  “Give me green food every time.  There is nothing so good as tender sweet clover and young grass, unless it be some of those fine vegetables Farmer Brown grows in his garden.”  Peter Rabbit nodded his head very emphatically as if he quite agreed.  “I suppose you are what is called a vegetarian, then,” said Happy Jack, to which Johnny Chuck replied that he supposed he was.  “And I suppose that is why you sleep all winter,” added Happy Jack.  “If I didn't I would starve,” responded Johnny Chuck promptly. “When it gets near time for Jack Frost to arrive, I stuff and stuff and stuff on the last of the good green things until I'm so fat I can hardly waddle.  Then I go down to my bedroom, curl up and go to sleep.  Cold weather, snow and ice don't worry me a bit.”  “I know,” spoke up Striped Chipmunk.  “I sleep most of the winter myself.  Of course I have a lot of food stored away down in my house, and once in a while I wake up and eat a little.  Do you ever wake up in the winter, Johnny Chuck?”  “No,” replied Johnny.  “I sleep right through, thank goodness. Sometimes I wake up very early in the spring before the snow is all gone, earlier than I wish I did.  That is where my fat comes in handy.  It keeps me warm and keeps me alive until I can find the first green plants.  Perhaps you have noticed that early in the spring I am as thin as I was fat in the fall.  This is because I have used up the fat, waiting for the first green things to appear.”  “Do you have many enemies?” asked Peter Rabbit, who has so many himself that he is constantly thinking of them.  “Not many, but enough,” growled Johnny Chuck.  “Reddy Fox, Old Man Coyote, men and Dogs are the worst.  Of course, when I was small I always had to be watching out for Hawks, and of course, like all the rest of us little folks, I am afraid of Shadow the Weasel. Reddy Fox has tried to dig me out more than once, but I can dig faster than he can.  If he ever gets me cornered, he'll find that I can fight.  A small Dog surprised me once before I could get to my hole and I guess that Dog never will tackle another Woodchuck.”  “Time is up,” interrupted Old Mother Nature.  “Johnny Chuck has a big cousin out in the mountains of the Great West named Whistler, and on the prairies of the Great West he has a smaller cousin named Yap Yap.  They are quite important members of the Marmot family, and to-morrow I'll tell you about them if you want me to.   You need not come tomorrow, Johnny Chuck, unless you want to,” she added.  Johnny Chuck hung his head, for he was a little ashamed that he had been so unwilling to come that morning.  “If you please, Mother Nature,” said he, “I think I'll come.  I didn't know I had any close relatives, and I want to know about them.”  So it was agreed that all"]]]
