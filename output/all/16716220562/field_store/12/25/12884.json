Aaron's farming methods, so much different to Murnan routines, puzzled and intrigued the boy. Aaron was equally bemused by the local taboos. Why, for example, did all the politer Murnans eat with the right hand only? Why did the women veil themselves in his presence? And what was this Mother-goddess worship that seemed to require no more of its adherents than the inclusion of their deity's name in every curse, formal and profane? \"Think what you please, but not too loud,\" Aaron cautioned himself, and carefully commenced to copy those Murnan speech-forms, gestures, and attitudes that did not conflict with his own deep convictions.  But the soil was his employment, not socializing. Aaron wormed his swine, inspected his horse-powered plow and harrow, gazed at the sun, palpated the soil, and prayed for an early spring to a God who understood German. Each day, to keep mold from strangling the moist morsels, he shook the jars of tobacco seed, whose hair-fine sprouts were just splitting the hulls.  The rations packaged in Pennsylvania were shrinking. The Stoltzfoos stake of silver and gold cowries was wasting away. Each night, bruised with fatigue, Aaron brought his little household into the parlor while he read from the Book that had bound his folk to the soil. Waziri bowed, honoring his master's God in his master's manner, but understood nothing of the hard High German: \"_For the Lord God will help me: therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know I shall not be ashamed. Awmen._\"  \"Awmen,\" said Martha.  \"Awmen,\" said Waziri, fisting his hand in respect to his friend's bearded God.         *       *       *       *       *  The Murnan neighbors, to whom late winter was the slackest season in the farm-year, visited often to observe and comment on the off-worlder's work. Aaron Stoltzfoos privately regarded the endless conversations as too much of a good thing; but he realized that his answering the Murnan's questions helped work off the obligation he owed the government for the eighty light-years' transportation it had given him, the opportunity he'd been given to earn this hundred acres with five years' work, and the interest-free loans that had put up his barn and farmhouse.  With Waziri hovering near, Aaron's proud lieutenant, the neighbors would stuff their pipes with native tobacco, a leaf that would have gagged one of Sir Walter Raleigh's Indian friends, while the Amishman lit a stogie in self-defense. Why, the neighbor farmers demanded, did Aaron propose to dust his bean-seeds with a powder that looked like soot? Martha's microscope, a wonder, introduced the Murnans to bacteria; and Aaron tediously translated his knowledge of the nitrogen-fixing symbiotes into Hausa. But there were other questions. What was the purpose of the brush stacked on top of the smooth-raked beds where Aaron proposed to plant his tobacco-seedlings? He explained that fire, second best to steaming, would kill the weed-seeds in the soil, and give the tobacco uncrowded beds to prosper in.  Those needles with which he punctured the flanks of his swine and cattle: what devils did they exorcise? Back to the microscope for an explanation of the disease-process, a sophistication the Murnans had lost in the years since they'd left Kano. What were the bits of blue and pink paper Aaron pressed into mudballs picked up in the various precincts of his property? Why did those slips oftentime change color, from blue to pink, or pink-to-blue? What was in those sacks of stuff--no dung of animals, but a sort of flour--that he intended to work into his soil? Aaron answered each question as best he could, Waziri supplying--and often inventing--Hausa words for concepts like phosphorous, ascarid worms, and litmus.  Aaron had as much to learn from his brown-skinned neighbors as he had to teach them. He was persuaded to lay in a supply of seed-yams, guaranteeing a crop that would bring bronze cowries next fall in Datura, the price of next year's oil and cloth and tools. The peanut, a legume Aaron had no experience of beyond purchasing an occasional tooth-ful at the grocery-store, won half a dozen acres from Korean lespedeza, the crop he'd at first selected as his soil-improver there. He got acquainted with a plant no Amishman before him had ever sown, a crabgrass called fonio, a staple cereal and source of beer-malt on Murna, imported with the first Nigerian colonists.  Aaron refused to plant any lalle, the henna-shrub from which the Murnans made the dye to stain their women's hands, feeling that it would be improper for him to contribute to such a vanity. Bulrush millet, another native crop, was ill suited to Aaron's well-drained fields. He planned to grow corn, though, the stuff his people called _Welschkarn_--alien corn. Though American enough, maize had been a foreigner to the first Amish farmers, and still carried history in its name. This crop was chiefly for Wutzchen, whose bloodlines, Aaron was confident, would lead to a crop of pork of a quality these heretics from Islam had never tasted before.         *       *       *       *       *  Work wasn't everything. One Sunday, after he and Martha had sung together from the _Ausbund_, and Aaron had read from the _Schrift_ and the _Martyr's Mirror_, there was time to play.  Sarki Kazunzumi and several other gentlemen who enjoyed City Hall or Chamber of Commerce standing in Datura had come to visit the Stoltzfooses after lunch; as had Musa the carpenter and his older son, Dauda, Waziri's brother. Also on the premises were about a dozen of the local farmers and craftsmen, inspecting the curious architecture the off-worlder had introduced to their planet. Aaron, observing that the two classes of his guests were maintaining a polite fiction, each that the other was not present, had an idea. He'd seen Murnans in town at the midwinter festival, their status-consciousness forgotten in mutual quaffs of fonio-beer or barley-brandy, betting together at horse-races and wheels-of-fortune. \"My friends,\" the Amishman addressed the Murnans gathered in his barn, inspecting Wutzchen, \"let's play a game of ball.\"  Kazunzumi looked interested. As the local Chief of State, the Sarki's approval guaranteed the enthusiasm of all the lesser ranks.  Aaron explained the game he had in mind. It wasn't baseball, an \"English\" sport foreign to Amishmen, who can get through their teens without having heard of either Comiskey Park or the World Series. Their game, _Mosch Balle_, fits a barnyard better.  In lieu of the regulation softball used in the game of Corner Ball, Martha had stitched together a sort of large beanbag. The playing-field Aaron set up with the help of his visitors was a square some twelve yards on a side, fence-rails being propped up to mark its boundaries and fresh straw forked onto it six inches deep as footing.  Aaron's eight-man team was chosen from the working-stiffs. The opposing eight were the Brass. To start the game, four of the proletarians stood at the corners of the square; and two men of Kazunzumi's team waited warily within.  Aaron commenced to explain the game. To say that the object of _Mosch Balle_ is for a member of the outer, offensive, team to strike an inner, defensive man with the ball is inadequate; such an explanation is as lacking as to explain baseball as the pitcher's effort to throw a ball so well that it's hittable, and so very well that it yet goes unhit. Both games have their finer points.  \"Now,\" Aaron told his guests on the field, \"we four on the corners will toss the ball back and forth amongst ourselves, shouting _Hah_,_Oh_,_Tay_, with each pitch. Whoever has the ball on _Tay_ has to fling it at one of the two men inside the square. If he misses, he's Out; and one of the other men on our team takes his place. If he hits his target-man, the target's Out, and will be replaced by another man from the Sarki's team. The team with the last man left on the straw wins the first half. _Des iss der Weeg wie mir's diehne_, O.K.?\"  \"_Afuwo!_\" the Sarki yelled, a woman's call, grinning, crouched to spring aside. \"Hah!\" Aaron shouted, and tossed the ball to Waziri's older brother, Dauda. \"Oh!\" Dauda yelled, and threw the ball to the shoemaker. \"Tay!\" the cobbler exulted, and slammed the ball at the lower-ranking of the two men within the square, the village banker. The shoemaker missed, and was retired.  The Daturans were soon stripped down to trousers and boots, their black torsos steaming in the cold air. Aaron removed his shirt--but not his hat--and so far forgot his Hausa in the excitement that he not only rooted for his teammates in _Pennsylfawnisch Deitsch_, but even punctuated several clumsy plays with raw _Fadomm_'s.  Aaron's skill won the first half for his team. Blooded, the Chamber of Commerce Eight fought through to win the second half. A tie. The play-off saw the Working-Man's League pummeled to a standstill by the C-of-C, who took the laurels with a final slam that knocked Waziri into the straw, protesting that it was an accident.  Sweating, laughing, social status for the moment forgotten, the teams and their mobs of fans surged into the farmhouse to demand of Martha wedges of raisin pie and big cups of strong coffee. As the guests put their rigas and their white caps back on, and assumed therewith their game-discarded rank of class, they assured Aaron that the afternoon at the ball game had been a large success.         *       *       *       *       *  The next day was crisp and cold. With nothing more to be done till the soil thawed, Aaron took Waziri down to the creek to investigate his project of irrigating the hilltop acres. The flow of water was so feeble that the little stream was ice to its channel. \"Do you have hereabouts a digger-of-waterholes?\" Aaron asked the boy. Waziri nodded, and supplied the Hausa phrase for this skill. \"Good. _Wonn's Gottes wille iss_, I will find a spot for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24567"],["title","Blind Man's Lantern (#5)"],["body","to dig, smelling out the water as can my cousin Blue Ball Benjamin Blank,\" Aaron said. \"Go get from the barn the pliers, the hand-tool that pinches.\"  Waziri trotted off and brought back the pliers. \"What are you up to, Haruna-boss?\" he asked. Aaron was holding the bulldog pliers out before him, one handle in each hand, parallel to the ground.  \"I am smelling for the well-place,\" the Amishman said, pacing deliberately across the field. The boy scampered along beside him. \"We will need at least one well to be safe from August draught. Cousin Benjamin found the wet depths in this fashion; perhaps it will work for me.\" Aaron walked, arms outstretched, for half an hour before his face grew taut. He slowed his walking and began to work toward the center of a spiral. Waziri could see the sweat springing up on the young farmer's brow and fingers, despite the cold breeze that blew. The bulldog pliers trembled as though responding to the throbbing of an engine. Suddenly, as though about to be jerked from Aaron's hands, the pliers tugged downward so forceably that he had to lift his elbows and flex his wrists to hold onto them. \"Put a little pile of stones here, Waziri,\" he said. \"We'll have the diggers visit as soon as the ground thaws.\"  [Illustration]  Waziri shook his head. \"Haruna, they will not touch soft earth until the first grass sprouts,\" he said.  \"Time enough,\" Aaron said. He looked up to satisfy himself that his prospective well-site was high enough to avoid drainage from his pig-yard, then left the Murnan boy to pile up a cairn for the diggers. It would be good to have a windmill within ear-shot of the house, he mused; its squeaking would ease Martha with a homey sound.  [Illustration]  Alone for a few minutes, Aaron retired to the workshop in the cellar of the barn. He planed and sanded boards of a native lumber very like to tulipwood. Into the headboard of the cradle he was making, he keyhole-sawed the same sort of broad Dutch heart that had marked his own cradle, and the cradles of all his family back to the days in the Rhineland, before they'd been driven to America.  Martha Stoltzfoos was speaking Hausa better than she'd spoken English since grade-school days, and she kept busy in the little bacteriological laboratory on her sunporch, keeping fresh the skills she'd learned at Georgetown and might some day need in earnest; but she still grew homesick as her child-coming day drew nearer. It was wrong, she told Aaron, for an Amishwoman to have heathen midwives at her lying-in. For all their kindness, the Murnan women could never be as reassuring as the prayer-covered, black-aproned matrons who'd have attended Martha back home. \"Ach, Stoltz,\" she told her husband, \"if only a few other of _unser sart Leit_ could have come here with us.\"  \"Don't worry, Love,\" Aaron said. \"I've eased calves and colts enough into the world; man-children can't come so different.\"  \"You talk like a man,\" Martha accused him. \"I wish my Mem was just down the road a piece, ready to come a-running when my time came,\" she said. She put one hand on her apron. \"_Chuudes Paste!_ The little rascal is wild as a colt, indeed. Feel him, Stoltz!\"  Aaron dutifully placed his hand to sense the child's quickening. \"He'll be of help on the farm, so strong as he is,\" he remarked. Then, tugging his hat down tight, Aaron went outdoors, bashful before this mystery.  The little creek had thawed, and the light of the sun on a man's face almost gave back the heat the air extorted. Waziri had gone to town today for some sort of Murnan spring-festival, eager to celebrate his hard-earned wealth on his first day off in months. The place seemed deserted, Aaron felt, without the boy; without the visitors he'd played ball and talked crops with, striding up in their scarlet-trimmed rigas to gossip with their friend Haruna.  Between the roadway and the house, Aaron knelt to rake up with his fingers a handful of the new-thawed soil. He squeezed it. The clod in his hand broke apart of its own weight: it was not too wet to work. Festival-day though it was to his _Schwotzer_ neighbors, he was eager to spear this virgin soil with his plow blade.  Aaron strode back to the barn. He hitched Rosina--the dappled mare, named \"Raisin\" for her spots--to the plow and slapped her into motion. Sleek with her winter's idleness, Rosina was at first unenthusiastic about the plow; but the spring sun and honest exercise warmed her quickly. Within half an hour she was earning her keep. Though Aaron was plowing shallow, the compact soil broke hard. Rosina leaned into the traces, leaving hoofprints three inches deep. No gasoline tractor, Aaron mused, could ever pull itself through soil so rich and damp. _Geilsgrefte_, horsepower, was best exerted by a horse, he thought.  The brown earth-smells were good. Aaron kicked apart the larger clods, fat with a planet-life of weather and rich decay. This land would take a good deal of disking to get it into shape. His neighbors, who'd done their heavy plowing just after last fall's first frost, were already well ahead of him. He stabled Rosina at sundown, and went in to sneak a well-earned glass of hard cider past Martha's teetotaling eye.         *       *       *       *       *  Musa the carpenter brought his son home well after dark. Waziri had had adventures, the old man said; dancing, gambling on the Fool's Wheel, sampling fonio-beer, celebrating his own young life's springtime with the earth's. Both the old man and the boy were barefoot, Aaron noticed; but said nothing: perhaps shoelessness was part of their spring-festival.  Waziri a bit _geschwepst_ with the beer, tottered off to bed. \"Thanks to you, friend Haruna, that boy became a man today,\" the carpenter said. He accepted a glass of Aaron's cider. \"Today Waziri's wallet jingled with bronze and copper earned by his own sweat, a manful sound to a lad of fifteen summers. I ask pardon for having returned your laborer in so damaged a condition, brother Haruna; but you may be consoled with the thought that the Mother's festival comes but once in the twelve-month.\"  \"No harm was done, brother Musa,\" Aaron said, offering his visitor tobacco. \"In my own youth, I sometimes danced with beer-light feet to the music of worldly guitars; and yet I reached a man's estate.\"  Offered a refill for his pipe, Musa raised a hand in polite refusal. \"Tomorrow's sun will not wait on our conversation, and much must be done, in the manner of racers waiting the signal, before the first blade breaks the soil,\" he said. \"Good night, brother Haruna; and may Mother grant you light!\"  \"Mother keep you, brother Musa,\" Aaron murmured the heathen phrase without embarrassment. \"I'll guide your feet to your wagon, if I may.\"  Aaron, carrying the naphtha lantern, led the way across the strip of new-plowed soil. Set by frost into plastic mounds and ridges, the earth bent beneath his shoes and the carpenter's bare feet. Aaron swung Musa's picket-iron, the little anchor to which his horse was tethered, into the wagon, noticing that it had been curiously padded with layers of quilted cloth. \"May you journey home in good health, brother Musa,\" he said.  \"_Uwaka!_\" Musa shouted, staring at the plow-cuts.  Aaron Stoltzfoos dropped the lantern to his side, amazed that the dignified old man could be guilty of such an obscenity. Perhaps he'd misheard. \"Haruna, you have damned yourself!\" Musa bellowed. \"Cursed be this farm! Cursed be thy farming! May thy seedlings rot, may thy corn sprout worms for tassles, may your cattle stink and make early bones!\"  \"Brother Musa!\" Aaron said.  \"I am no sib to you, O Bearded One,\" Musa said. \"Nor will I help you carry the curse you have brought upon yourself by today's ill-doing.\" He darted back to the farmhouse, where he ordered half-wakened Waziri to pad barefoot after him to the wagon, rubbing his eyes. \"Come, son,\" Musa said. \"We must flee these ill-omened fields.\" Without another word to his host, the carpenter hoisted his boy into the wagon, mounted, and set off into the night. The hoofs of his horse padded softly against the dirt road, unshod.  Martha met the bewildered Aaron at the door, wakened by Musa's shouting. \"_Wass gibt_, Stoltz?\" she asked. \"What for was all the carry-on?\"  Aaron tugged at his beard. \"I don't know, woman,\" he admitted. \"Musa the carpenter took one look at the plowing I did today, then cursed me as though he'd caught me spitting in his well. He got Waziri up from bed and took him home.\" He took his wife's hand. \"I'm sorry he woke you up, Liebchen.\"  \"It was not so much the angry carpenter who waked me as the little jack rabbit you're father to,\" Martha said. \"As you say, a _Bun_ who can kick so hard, and barefoot, too, will be a strong one once he's born.\"  Aaron was staring out the window onto the dark road. \"_Farwas hot Musa sell gehuh?_\" he asked himself. \"What for did Musa do such a thing? He knows that our ways are different to his. If I did aught wrong, Musa must know it was done not for want to harm. I will go to the village tomorrow; Musa must forgive me and explain.\"  \"He will, Stoltz.\" Martha said. \"_Kuum, schloef._ You'll be getting up early.\"  \"How can I sleep, not knowing how I have hurt my friend?\" Aaron asked.  \"You must,\" Martha urged him. \"Let your cares rest for the night, Aaron.\"  In the morning, Stoltzfoos prepared for his trip into Datura by donning his Sunday-best. He clipped a black patent-leather bow tie, a wedding gift, onto his white shirt: and fastened up his best broadfall trousers with his dress suspenders. Over this, Aaron put his _Mutzi_, the tailed frock coat that fastened with hooks-and-eyes. When he'd exchanged his broad-brimmed black felt working-hat for another just the same, but unsweated, Aaron was dressed as he'd be on his way to a House-Amish Sunday meeting back home. \"I expect no trouble here, Martha,\" he said, tucking a box of stogies under his arm as a little guest-gift for the old carpenter.  \"Hurry home, Stoltz; "]]]
