As the raiders left, one of them shouted:  “Now, old lady, call on your protectors. Why don’t you call on Cole Younger now?”  Among the women who lost their lives was Miss Josephine Anderson, whose cruel death simply blighted her brother’s life and so filled him with determination to revenge that he afterward became the most desperate of desperate men.  “Quantrell sometimes spares, but Anderson never,” became a tradition of the Kansas line.  Before he died in a skirmish with Northern troops in 1864, he had tied fifty-three knots in a silken cord which he carried in his buckskin pouch.  Every knot represented a human life.  Anderson was then ripe for the raid on Lawrence.  All this was cruelty, indeed, and enough to harden and embitter the softest of hearts, but it was mild compared with the continuous suffering and torture imposed upon my mother during the years from 1862 to 1870.  After the murder of my father she was so annoyed at her home in Harrisonville that she sought peace at her country residence eight and a half miles north of town.  But she failed to find the comfort she sought, for annoyances continued in a more aggravated form.  She had with her only the youngest children and was obliged to rely wholly for protection upon “Suse,” the only remaining servant left to the family, who proved her worth many times over and in every emergency was loyalty and devotion itself.  Nothing could have proved her faithfulness more effectually than an incident connected with one of my stolen visits home.  I went home one night to get medicine for the boys wounded in the battle of Lone Jack whom I was nursing in the woods some miles away.  As I sat talking with my mother two of my brothers watched at the windows.  There was soon the dreaded cry, “the militia are surrounding the house,” and in the excitement which followed, “Suse” dashed open the door to find a score of bayonets in her face.  She threw up her hands and pushed aside the guns. Her frantic screams, when they demanded that she deliver me up to them, caused a momentary confusion which enabled me to gain her side and together we made for the gate, where I took for the woods amid a shower of lead, none of the bullets even so much as skinning me, although from the house to the gate I was in the full glare of the light.  Two months after this incident the same persecutors again entered our home in the dead of the night, and, at the point of a pistol, tried to force my mother to set fire to her own home.  She begged to be allowed to wait until morning, so that she and her children and “Suse” would not be turned out in the snow, then some two or three feet deep, in the darkness, with the nearest neighbor many miles away.  This they agreed to do on condition that she put the torch to her house at daybreak.  They were there bright and early to see that she carried out her agreement, so, leaving her burning walls behind her, she and the four youngest children and “Suse” began their eight mile trudge through the snow to Harrisonville.  I have always felt that the exposure to which she was subjected on this cruel journey, too hard even for a man to take, was the direct cause of her death.  From Harrisonville she went to Waverly, where she was hounded continually.  One of the conditions upon which her life was spared was that she would report at Lexington weekly.  It was during one of her absences there that our enemies went to the house where she had left her family and demanded that they turn over the $2,200 which had been overlooked when my father was murdered.  She had taken the precaution to conceal it upon the person of “Suse,” and although they actually hung this faithful servant to a tree in the yard in their determination to force her to divulge the hiding place of the money, she never even hinted that the money at that very moment was secreted in her garments.  She was left for dead, and except for the timely arrival of a friend, who cut her down and restored her to her senses, she would in a few moments have been as dead as her would-be-murderers hoped.  One of the numerous books purporting to be a history of my life states with the utmost soberness that, as a boy, I was cruel to dumb animals and to my schoolmates, and, as for my teachers, to them I was a continual trouble and annoyance.  A hundred of my friends and schoolmates will bear me out in the statement that, far from being cruel to either dumb animals or human beings, I was always regarded as kind and considerate to both.  One of my old school-teachers, whom I have never seen since the spring or summer of 1862, is Stephen B. Elkins, senator from West Virginia.  July 4, 1898, Senator Elkins wrote: “I knew Cole Younger when we were boys and also his parents.  They were good people and among the pioneers on the western border of Missouri.  The Younger brothers maintained a good reputation in the community where they lived and were well esteemed, as were their parents, for their good conduct and character.  In the spring or summer of 1862 I was taken prisoner by Quantrell’s men and brought into his camp by the pickets who had me in charge.  On reaching the camp the first person I saw whom I knew was Cole Younger.  When I was taken prisoner, I expected to be shot without ceremony.  As soon as I saw Cole Younger I felt a sense of relief because I had known him and his parents long and favorably, and as soon as I got a chance I told him frankly what I feared and that I hoped he would manage to take care of me and save me from being killed. He assured me he would do all he could to protect me. Cole Younger told Quantrell that my father and brother were in the rebel army and were good fighters, and that I had stayed at home to take care of my mother; that I was a good fellow and a non-combatant.  This occurred just before I entered the Union army, and it was generally known, and I am sure Cole knew, that I was strongly for the Union and about to enter the army.  Cole Younger told me what to do to make good my escape and I feel that I owe my life to his kindness.”  Another old school-teacher is Capt. Steve Ragan, who still lives in Kansas City, Mo., and will bear testimony to the fact that I was neither cruel nor unmanageable.      2. THE DARK AND BLOODY GROUND   Many causes united in embittering the people on both sides of the border between Missouri and Kansas.  Those Missourians who were for slavery wanted Kansas admitted as a slave state, and sought to accomplish it by the most strenuous efforts. Abolitionists on the other hand determined that Kansas should be free and one of the plans for inviting immigration from the Eastern Northern states where slavery was in disrepute, was the organization of an Immigrant Aid Society, in which many of the leading men were interested.  Neither the earnestness of their purpose nor the enthusiasm of their fight for liberty is for me to question now.  But many of those who came to Kansas under the auspices of this society were undesirable neighbors, looked at from any standpoint. Their ideas on property rights were very hazy, in many cases.  Some of them were let out of Eastern prisons to live down a “past” in a new country.  They looked upon a slave owner as legitimate prey, and later when lines became more closely drawn a secessionist was fit game, whether he had owned slaves or not.  These new neighbors ran off with the horses and negroes of Missouri people without compunctions of conscience and some Missourians grew to have similarly lax notions about the property rights of Kansans.  These raiders on both sides, if interfered with, would kill, and ultimately they developed into what was known during the war as “Freebooters,” who, when they found a stable of horses or anything easily transportable, would take it whether the owner be abolitionist or secessionist in sympathy.  It was a robbery and murder by one of these bands of Kansas Jayhawkers, that gave to the Civil war Quantrell, the Chief of the Guerrillas.  A boy of 20, William Clarke Quantrell, had joined his brother in Kansas in 1855 and they were on their way to California overland when a band of Jayhawkers in command of Capt. Pickens, as was afterwards learned, raided their camp near the Cottonwood river; killed the older boy, left the younger one for dead, and carried off their valuables.  But under the care of friendly Indians, Charles Quantrell lived.  Changing his name to Charley Hart, he sought the Jayhawkers, joined Pickens’ company, and confided in no one.  Quantrell and three others were sent out to meet an “underground railroad” train of negroes from Missouri. One of the party did not come back.  Between October, 1857, and March, 1858, Pickens’ company lost 13 men. Promotion was rapid.  Charley “Hart” was made a lieutenant.  No one had recognized in him the boy who had been left for dead two summers before, else Capt. Pickens had been more careful in his confidences.          One night he told the young lieutenant the story of a raid on an emigrant camp on the Cottonwood river; how the dead man had been left no shroud; the wounded one no blanket; how the mules were sold and the proceeds gambled for.  But Lieut. “Hart’s” mask revealed nothing.  Three days later Pickens and two of his friends were found dead on Bull Creek.  Col. Jim Lane’s orderly boasted of the Cottonwood affair in his cups at a banquet one night.  The orderly was found dead soon after.  Quantrell told a friend that of the 32 who were concerned in the killing of his brother, only two remained alive, and they had moved to California.  The fight at Carthage in July 1861, found Quantrell in Capt. Stewart’s company of cavalry.  I was there as a private in the state guard, fighting under Price. Then came Gen. Lyon’s fatal charge at Wilson’s creek, and Gen. Price’s march on Lexington to dislodge Col. Mulligan and his command.  Here Quantrell came into the public eye"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24585"],["title","The Story of Cole Younger, (#2)"],["body","the first time.  His red shirt stood out in the first rank in every advance; he was one of the last when the men fell back.  After Lexington, Quantrell went with the command as far as the Osage river, and then, with the consent of his officers, came up the Kansas line again to settle some old scores with the Jayhawkers.      3. DRIVEN FROM HOME   I was only seventeen when Col. Mockbee gave a dancing party for his daughter at his home in Harrisonville which was to terminate seriously for some of us who were there.  The colonel was a Southerner, and his daughter had the Southern spirit, too.  Probably this was the reason that inspired the young Missouri militiamen who were stationed at Harrisonville to intrude on the colonel’s party. Among them was Captain Irvin Walley, who, even though a married man, was particularly obnoxious in forcing his attentions on the young women.  My sister refused to dance with him, and he picked a quarrel with me.  “Where is Quantrell?” he asked me, with a sneer.  “I don’t know,” I answered.  “You are a liar,” he continued, and as he went down in a heap on the floor, he drew his pistol, but friends came between us, and at their solicitation I went home and informed my father of what had taken place. He told me to go down to the farm in Jackson county, and to keep away from the conflict that Walley was evidently determined to force.  Next morning I started.  That night Walley and a band of his scouts came to my father’s house and demanded that he surrender me, on the ground that I was a spy, and in communication with Quantrell. Father denounced it as a lie.  Though a slave-owner, father had never been in sympathy with secession, believing, as it turned out, that it meant the death of slavery.  He was for the Union, in spite of his natural inclinations to sympathy with the South.  A demand that I surrender was conveyed to my father by Col. Neugent, who was in charge of the militia at Harrisonville, again charging that I was a spy.  I never doubted that his action was due to the enmity of Walley.  My parents wanted me to go away to school.  I would have liked to have stayed and fought it out, and although I consented to go away, it was too late, and I was left no choice as to fighting it out.  Watch was being kept for me at every railroad station, and the only school I could reach was the school of war close at home.  Armed with a shot-gun and revolver, I went out into the night and was a wanderer.  Instant death to all persons bearing arms in Missouri was the edict that went forth Aug. 30 of that year from Gen. John C. Fremont’s headquarters at St. Louis, and he declared that all slaves belonging to persons in arms against the United States were free.  President Lincoln promptly overruled this, but it had added to the bitterness in Missouri where many men who owned slaves were as yet opposed to secession.  It was “hide and run for it” with me after that.  That winter my brother-in-law, John Jarrette, and myself, joined Capt. Quantrell’s company. Jarrette was orderly sergeant. He never knew fear, and the forty that then made up the company were as brave men as ever drew breath.                        [Illustration: John Jarrette]                                John Jarrette   We were not long quiet.  Burris had a detachment raiding in the neighborhood of Independence.  We struck their camp at sunset.  We were thirty-two; they eighty-four; but we were sure shots and one volley broke their ranks in utter confusion.  Five fell at the first fire, and seven more died in the chase, the others regaining Independence, where the presence of the rest of the regiment saved them.  That day my persistent pistol practice showed its worth when one of the militiamen fell, 71 yards away, actual measure. That was Nov. 10, 1861.  All that winter Independence was the scene of a bloody warfare.  One day early in February Capt. Quantrell and David Pool, Bill Gregg and George Shepherd, George Todd and myself, charged in pairs down three of the streets to the court house, other members of the company coming through other streets.  We had eleven hurt, but we got away with ammunition and other supplies that were badly needed.  Seven militiamen died that day.  Another charge, at daybreak of Feb. 21, resulted badly.  Instead of the one company we expected to find, there were four.  Although we killed seventeen, we lost one, young George, who fell so close to the guns of the foe that we had considerable difficulty in getting him away for burial. Then we disbanded for a time.  Capt. Quantrell believed that it was harder to trail one man than a company, and every little while the company would break up, to rally again at a moment’s notice.      4. THE TRAP THAT FAILED   In March Quantrell planned to attack Independence. We met at David George’s and went from there toward Independence as far as Little Blue church, where Allen Parmer, who afterward married Susie James, the sister of Frank and Jesse, told the captain that instead of there being 300 Jayhawkers in Independence, there were 600.  The odds were too strong, and we swung around to the southwest.  Thirteen soldiers who guarded the bridge at the Big Blue found their number unlucky.  The bridge was burned and we dined that day at the home of Alex. Majors, of Russell, Majors & Waddell, the freighters, and rested for the night at Maj. Tale’s house, near New Santa Fe, where there was fighting for sure before morning.  A militia command, 300 strong, came out to capture us, but they did not risk an attack until nearly midnight.  Capt. Quantrell, John Jarrette, and I were sleeping together when the alarm was given, the sentry’s challenge, “Who are you?” followed by a pistol shot.  We were up on the instant.  So stealthy had been their approach that they had cut the sentry off from us before alarming him, and he fled into the timber in a shower of lead.  There was a heavy knock on the outer door, and a deep voice shouted: “Make a light.”  Quantrell, listening within, fired through the panel. The visitor fell.  While we barricaded the windows with bedding, the captain polled his men. “Boys,” he said, “we’re in a tight place.  We can’t stay here and I do not mean to surrender.  All who want to follow me out can say so; all who prefer to give up without a rush can also say so. I will do the best I can for them.”  Four voted to surrender, and went out to the besieging party, leaving seventeen.  Quantrell, James Little, Hoy, Stephen Shores and myself held the upper story, Jarrette, George Shepherd, Toler and others the lower.  Anxious to see who their prisoners were, the militiamen exposed themselves imprudently, and it cost them six.  Would they permit Major Tate’s family to escape?  Yes.  They were only too glad, for with the family out, the ell, which was not commanded by our fire, offered a tempting mark for the incendiary.  Hardly had the Tales left than the flames began to climb the ell.  There was another parley.  Could we have twenty minutes?  Ten?  Five?  Back came the answer:  “You have one minute.  If at its expiration you have not surrendered, not a single man among you shall escape alive.”  “Thank you,” said I; “catching comes before hanging.”  “Count six then and be d—d to you!” shouted back George Shepherd, who was doing the dickering, and Quantrell said quietly, “Shotguns to the front.”  There were six of these, and behind them came those with revolvers only. Then Quantrell opened the door and leaped out.  Close behind him were Jarrette, Shepherd, Toler, Little, Hoy and myself, and behind us the revolvers.  In less time than it takes to tell it, the rush was over.  We had lost five, Hoy being knocked down with a musket and taken prisoner, while they had eighteen killed and twenty-nine wounded.  We did not stop till we got to the timber, but there was really no pursuit.  The audacity of the thing had given the troops a taste of something new.  They kept Hoy at Leavenworth for several months and then hanged him. This was the inevitable end of a “guerrilla” when taken prisoner.      5. VENGEANCE INDEED   Among the Jackson county folks who insisted on their right to shelter their friends was an old man named Blythe.  Col. Peabody at Independence had sent out a scouting party to find me or any one else of the company they could “beat up.”  Blythe was not at home when they came but his son, aged twelve, was.  They took him to the barn and tried to find out where we were, but the little fellow baffled them until he thought he saw a chance to break through the guard, and started for the house.  He reached it safely, seized a pistol, and made for the woods followed by a hail of bullets.  They dropped him in his tracks, but, game to the last, he rolled over as he fell, shot one of his pursuers dead, mortally wounded a second, and badly hurt a third.  They put seventeen bullets in him before he could shoot a fourth time.  A negro servant who had witnessed the seizure of his young master, had fled for the timber, and came upon a party of a dozen of us, including Quantrell and myself.  As he quickly told us the story, we made our plans, and ambushed at the “Blue Cut,” a deep pass on the road the soldiers must take back to Independence.  The banks are about thirty feet high, and the cut about fifty yards wide.  Not a shot was to be fired until the entire command was in the cut.  Thirty-eight had started to “round up” Cole Younger that morning; seventeen of them lay dead in the cut that night and the rest of them had a lively chase into Independence.  To this day old residents know the Blue Cut as “the slaughter-pen.”  Early in May, 1862, Quantrell’s men were disbanded for a month.  Horses were needed, and ammunition.  There were plenty of horses in Missouri, but the ammunition presented more of a problem.  Capt. Quantrell, George Todd and myself, attired as Union officers, went to Hamilton, a small town on the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad, undetected by the company "]]]
