And it put _all_ Earthmen in exactly the same class, too.\"  \"So what's honor among thieves? I got off, didn't I?\"  Meyerhoff turned on him fiercely. \"Oh, you got off just fine. You scared the living daylights out of them. And in an eon of lying they never have run up against a short-circuit like that. You've also completely botched any hope of ever setting up a trading alliance with Altair I, and that includes uranium, too. Smart people don't gamble with loaded dice. You scared them so badly they don't want anything to do with us.\"  Zeckler's grin broadened, and he leaned back luxuriously. \"Ah, well. After all, the Trading Alliance was _your_ outlook, wasn't it? What a pity!\" He clucked his tongue sadly. \"Me, I've got a fortune in credits sitting back at the consulate waiting for me--enough to keep me on silk for quite a while, I might say. I think I'll just take a nice, long vacation.\"  Meyerhoff turned to him, and a twinkle of malignant glee appeared in his eyes. \"Yes, I think you will. I'm quite sure of it, in fact. Won't cost you a cent, either.\"  \"Eh?\"  Meyerhoff grinned unpleasantly. He brushed an imaginary lint fleck from his lapel, and looked up at Zeckler slyly. \"That--uh--jury trial. The Altairians weren't any too happy to oblige. They wanted to execute you outright. Thought a trial was awfully silly--until they got their money back, of course. Not too much--just three million credits.\"  Zeckler went white. \"But that money was in banking custody!\"  \"Is that right? My goodness. You don't suppose they could have lost those papers, do you?\" Meyerhoff grinned at the little con-man. \"And incidentally, you're under arrest, you know.\"  A choking sound came from Zeckler's throat. \"_Arrest!_\"  \"Oh, yes. Didn't I tell you? Conspiring to undermine the authority of the Terran Trading Commission. Serious charge, you know. Yes, I think we'll take a nice long vacation together, straight back to Terra. And there I think you'll face a jury trial.\"  Zeckler spluttered. \"There's no evidence--you've got nothing on me! What kind of a frame are you trying to pull?\"  \"A _lovely_ frame. Airtight. A frame from the bottom up, and you're right square in the middle. And this time--\" Meyerhoff tapped a cigarette on his thumb with happy finality--\"this time I _don't_ think you'll get off.\"     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from \"Tiger by the Tail and Other Science     Fiction Stories by Alan E.

There were seven at the table, which makes for good poker. Outside of Nick, who banked the game, nobody looked familiar. They all had the beat look of compulsive gamblers, fogged over by their individual attempts at a poker face. They were a cagey-looking lot. Only one of them was within ten years of my age.  \"Just in case, gamblers,\" the young one said. I looked up from stacking the chips I had just bought from Nick. The speaker was a skinny little guy with a sharp chin and more freckles than I'd like to have.  \"If any one of you guys has any psi powers,\" the sharp-chinned gambler said sourly, \"you better beat it. All gamblers here will recoup double their losses from any snake we catch using psi powers to beat the odds.\"  He shot a hard eyed look around a room not yet dimmed by cigar smoke. I got the most baleful glare, I thought. He didn't need to worry. I'd been certified Normal by an expert that very evening.  The expert was Dr. Shari King, whom I had taken to dinner before joining the game at Nick's. It had gotten to be a sort of weekly date--although this night had given signs of being the last one. For a while that spring, desoxyribonucleic acid had begun to take second place in my heart. This is a pitiful admission for a biochemist to make--DNA should be the cornerstone of his life. But Shari was something rare--a gorgeous woman, if somewhat distant, who was thoroughly intelligent. She had already earned her doctorate, while I was still struggling with the tag ends of my thesis.  \"Poker, Tex?\" Shari had asked, when the waitress was bringing dessert. \"Is this becoming a problem? You've played every night this week.\"  \"No problem, Shari,\" I said. \"I'm winning, and I see no point in not pocketing all that found money.\"  \"Compulsive gambling is a sickness,\" she said, looking at me thoughtfully. She was wearing a shirtwaist and skirt that had the bright colors and fullness you associate with peasant dress.  \"The only sick thing about me is my bank account,\" I grinned, relishing her dark, romantic quality. \"I need the dough, Shari. I've got a thesis to finish if I ever want to get a job teaching.\"  Her thick eyebrows fluttered upward, a danger signal I had learned to look for. \"That's a childish rationalization, Tex,\" she said with a lot more sharpness than I had expected. \"There are certainly other ways to get money!\"  \"So I'm not as smart as you,\" I told her.  \"Smart?\" She didn't think I was tracking.  \"I wasn't as shrewd as you were in picking my parents,\" I said. \"Mine never had much, and left me less than that when they died.\"  She threw her spoon to the table. \"I'll remind you of how silly these remarks sound, after you've hit a losing streak,\" she told me.  I laughed at that one. \"I don't lose, Shari,\" I said. \"And I don't intend to.\"  Her lashes veiled her violet eyes as she smiled and said more quietly, \"Then you are in even worse trouble than I thought. I hear a lot about what happens to these strange people who never lose at cards or at dice or at roulette. Aren't you afraid of winding up in the gutter with your throat slit? Isn't that what happens to people with psi powers who gamble?\" she insisted. \"What's your trick, Tex? Do you stack the deck with telekinesis, or does precognition tell you what's about to be dealt?\"  \"That crack isn't considered very funny in Texas,\" I growled.  \"Is it any more silly for me to think you might be a psi personality than for you to think you never lose at cards?\" she nailed me.  I could feel my face getting red. \"Damn it!\" I started. \"Nobody talks to a friend like that!\"  \"Pretty convincing proof!\" Shari said tartly.  \"Of what?\"  \"Of the fact that you aren't making any sense about this gambling kick you're on, Tex. You should have laughed my teasing off. Who would seriously suggest that _you_ were a psi personality?\" she demanded. \"And most of all, with my background in psi, do you think I could be misled about it?\"  I shrugged, trying to cool down. Shari's doctorate had been earned with a startling thesis on psi phenomena and psi personalities, and she had stayed on at Columbia as a research fellow in the field. In egghead circles, she rated as a psi expert, all right.  \"Guess not,\" I said, trying to kill the subject.  She wasn't going to let it die. \"I don't think you're a psi, Tex. You're a Normal!\" The way she said it, it didn't sound like a compliment. \"Worse than that,\" she insisted. \"You're beginning to act like a compulsive gambler.\" She took a deep breath, and let me have the clincher: \"I could never marry a gambler, Tex!\"  \"You've never been asked,\" I reminded her.  She had the last word. \"Let's go!\" she snapped.         *       *       *       *       *  Angry as I was about her acting as though I were a snake, I wished I could have thrown her certification that I was a Normal in the freckled face of the sharp-chinned gambler at Nick's later that night. After Shari's needling, I didn't take very kindly to his popping off with the Law of the Pack. It's understood wherever people gamble that psis aren't welcome.  Nick didn't like it any better than I did. \"All right, Lefty,\" he said to the sharp-chinned gambler. \"Calm down, huh, kid? What kinda game you think I run, huh?\"  I didn't let the sour start spoil my game. I was lucky right from the start and hit big in several hands.  Lefty, the gambler who had yelped about psi powers at the game, dealt the tenth hand. He gave me the eight of spades in the hole. By the fourth card I had three other spades showing, which gave me four-fifths of a rare flush in stud poker. But by the fourth card Lefty had given himself a pair of jacks. That drove all the other gamblers to cover.  Lefty raised, of course, and it cost me five hundred bucks to see my fifth card. It was a classic kind of stand-off in stud, and the waiter stopped with his tray of drinks to press in among the other kibitzers and watch the pay-off.  Lefty shucked out the last two cards carelessly, as if they didn't really matter. His own fifth card made no difference--his jacks already had a busted flush beaten. His smile was just a little too sharp as he tossed me my last card face up and reached for the pot with the same left-handed gesture.  I took the poker panetella out of my teeth. \"All blue,\" I said, turning up my hole card with the other hand.  Lefty threw the unused part of the deck to the center of the table. \"That does it, you snake!\" he swore at me.  It took a second for his accusation to sink in. I started across the table after him. If they hadn't stopped me, I would have torn his lying throat out. Funny, but there were kibitzers on my shoulders before I could rise an inch out of my chair.  \"Down in Texas you could get shot for a crack like that, Lefty!\" I said. I guess I really yelled it.  \"And in New York you can, and probably will, get your rotten throat slit for a trick like the one _you_ just pulled,\" he replied. He turned to the other gamblers, most of whom had their hands on the edge of the table, ready to jump to their feet if it got any rougher.  \"I stacked the deck this last deal,\" he said coolly. He held a palm up at their surprised mutter. \"Tex's fifth card was stacked to be a heart, gamblers. You saw him get a spade and take the pot. I won't sit at the same table with a guy that can do that. Telekinesis has no place in poker.\"  \"Pretty near as bad as stacked decks,\" one of the gamblers rasped. But the others weren't with him. I only had to take one look at Nick's face.  I stood up slowly, and the hands on my shoulders didn't hold me down any longer. \"Lefty says he stacked the deck,\" I told them. \"I say he lies. You know there's nothing to choose between our statements. Lefty is a cheap grandstander, and I'll settle with him myself. Nick, I won't embarrass you tonight. This isn't your fault. But I'll be here tomorrow night, and you had better be glad to see me!\"  \"Sure, Tex,\" he said uncomfortably, rising with me. \"Take my seat, Shorty,\" he directed one of the kibitzers. He walked around to grab me by the elbow and steer me as far away from Lefty's truculent face as he could. At least the sharp-chinned little rat had quit the game, too. Both of us had left our chips on the table.  Nick wanted me to leave. \"Pay me off,\" I insisted. He said yes a lot quicker than I thought he would. The other gamblers could have squawked that my chips should go into the next pot, but apparently none of them did.  Lefty sidled out as Nick was paying me off. \"Wait outside for me,\" I said to him.  \"Why not?\" he said, sticking his chin out at me and walking out.  Nick grabbed me again. \"Don't get hot, Tex,\" he warned me. \"I don't want a killing on my own sidewalk. Take it some place else, huh, kid?\"  \"Sure,\" I said.  There wasn't any danger Lefty would hang around. I was big enough to break him in two, which is exactly what I planned if I caught up with him.         *       *       *       *       *  It had been dark for some hours by the time I hit the street and waved for a skim-copter. Nick's games start late.  \"You asked me to wait,\" somebody said. I spun around and saw Lefty standing in the alleyway beside the building. I went for him, charging hard. He scuttled back into the alley, out of what little light there was that far"]]]
