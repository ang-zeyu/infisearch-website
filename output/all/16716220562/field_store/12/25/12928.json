The nearest of these were Long Bill Wren and his wife, who at that time chanced to have a family of five growing children.  Mr. Frog took a great interest in the youngsters, who were already big enough to leave their ball-shaped home, which hung among the reeds, and hop about on the bank of the creek--and even fly a bit now and then.  Quite often Mr. Frog stopped to look at Long Bill's children and tell their parents how handsome they were.  \"I suppose--\" he said to their father one day----\"I suppose you are going to teach them to swim?\"  Long Bill Wren hadn't thought of that. And he said quickly that he was afraid it wouldn't be safe.  But Mr. Frog replied that it certainly wouldn't be safe not to, living as they did so close to the water.  \"They're liable to tumble in almost any day,\" he said. \"I suppose you can swim, yourself?\"  \"No!\" Long Bill answered, looking somewhat worried. \"I've never learned how.\"  Mr. Frog appeared greatly surprised by his neighbor's reply.  \"Then I'd be glad to teach your children,\" he offered.  \"Swimming is a very simple matter. And when you're young is the time to learn. I began when I was a tadpole. And knowing how to swim has saved my life a good many times.\"  Naturally the children were eager to have a lesson at once. And Long Bill Wren was about to yield to their teasing, when his wife happened to come flying home.  \"What's going on here?\" she asked sharply, for she saw that something unusual was afoot.  And when her husband explained Mr. Frog had kindly offered to teach the children to swim she cried, \"The idea! I won't have it!\"  Long Bill Wren looked uncomfortable. He was afraid his wife had hurt Mr. Frog's feelings.  But Mr. Frog smiled and bowed politely to Mrs. Wren.  \"Surely you're not afraid your children will drown in my care?\" he cried.  \"No!\" she told him. \"The trouble is I'd be nervous, because one of my young brothers was eaten by a member of your family.\"  Ferdinand Frog's face fell. But not for long.  \"I don't see how that could have come about,\" he declared. \"It must have been an accident.\"  \"Perhaps!\" Long Bill's wife replied. \"Anyhow, I want no such accidents to happen to my children.\" And she looked sternly at her new neighbor.  Mr. Frog glanced away uneasily.  \"I'm afraid,\" he observed, \"you do not trust me. But I assure you I had no idea of eating any of your little ones. They'd be perfectly safe with me. Why, every one of them is so plump I'd never be able to decide which one to choose first!\"  He often wondered, afterward, why Mrs. Wren promptly called all her children into the house.     XX  DISTURBING THE NEIGHBORS   It was no wonder that Long Bill Wren's wife did not care for Ferdinand Frog, after his blundering remark about her children.  Though her husband often told her that Mr. Frog must have been merely joking, she insisted that he was not a safe person to have in the neighborhood.  \"That Mr. Frog certainly is a queer one,\" she said to her husband one day. \"I was watching him this morning. And what do you suppose I saw him do?\" Mrs. Wren did not wait for Long Bill to answer her question. \"Mr. Frog actually pulled off his own skin!\" she cackled nervously.  \"Cat-tails and pussy-willows!\" Long Bill Wren exclaimed--which was his way of showing he was surprised. \"Mr. Frog must be ill. Maybe I ought to go and tell Aunt Polly Woodchuck, the herb-doctor, and ask her to come over here at once.\"  His wife, however, shook her head.  \"He can't be ill,\" she said.  \"Why not?\"  \"His appetite is still good,\" she explained. \"I saw Mr. Frog swallow his skin after he had pulled it off. And it didn't seem to disagree with him. He went in swimming right afterwards.\"  \"Ah!\" Long Bill exclaimed. \"That's a very dangerous thing to do. At least, I've often heard Johnnie Green say that a boy ought not to go in the water sooner than a full hour after he has had a meal.\"  \"There he is now!\" Mrs. Wren cried abruptly. \"There's Mr. Frog!\"  Peeping out of the doorway on one side of his ball-shaped house, Long Bill could see Ferdinand Frog paddling about in Black Creek.  While they were watching him, he sank before their eyes. And after a time they couldn't help feeling uneasy, because their odd neighbor did not show himself again.  \"I'm afraid----\" Long Bill whispered at last----\"I'm afraid he was taken with a cramp, for that's what you get by swimming too soon after a meal--so Johnnie Green says. . . . I'm glad now that we didn't let Mr. Frog teach our children to swim, because it's easy to see that he's a careless fellow.\"  So worried were Long Bill and his wife over Mr. Frog's disappearance that they hurried out and told all their neighbors about it. And soon a crowd had gathered upon the bank of the creek, to watch the spot where Mr. Frog had vanished.  They stayed there for a long time. But to their great alarm, their missing friend did not reappear.  \"I hope he's safe,\" old Mr. Turtle piped in his thin, quavering voice. \"He's making a new suit for me; and I'd hate to have anything happen to him.\"  \"What's this--a party?\" a voice called suddenly from under the bank. And then Mr. Frog himself, looking fine and fit, hopped up and stood before the company, with a broad grin on his face.  \"Where have you been?\" they shouted. \"We were worried about you.\"  \"Oh, I've been having a mud bath at the bottom of the creek,\" Mr. Frog told them. \"Mud baths, you know, are very healthful. And I advise you all to try one.\"     XXI  MUD BATHS   Though Mr. Frog agreed cheerfully to show his neighbors how to take a mud bath, there wasn't even one of them that accepted his offer.  To be sure, old Mr. Turtle remarked that there was a good deal to be said about mud baths. And then he waddled to the water's edge and swam away.  \"You heard what he said,\" Mr. Frog continued, turning to those who were left. \"It's simple enough. All one has to do is to dive down to the bottom of the creek and bury himself snugly in the soft mud.\"  \"How do you breathe?\" somebody inquired.  \"Oh, that's simple enough,\" Mr. Frog replied. \"You breathe through your skin.\"  Smiles appeared on the faces of his listeners. And here and there a cough sounded. It was plain that the company had little faith in Mr. Frog's easy explanation.  \"Doesn't it hurt your skin to breathe through it?\" some one else asked.  \"What if it does?\" Ferdinand Frog retorted. \"When your skin becomes worn, pull it off!\"  Everybody laughed heartily at his answer; or at least, everybody except Long Bill Wren and his wife. They exchanged a thoughtful look. For they knew Mr. Frog's ways better than his other neighbors did.  Now, Ferdinand Frog did not mind the laughter at all.  \"Of course,\" he went on, \"you can't breathe through your skin quite so well as you can in the _regular_ way. After you have stayed in the mud a while, you'll begin to want a _regular_ breath of fresh air. So then you come up to the top of the water.\"  \"Cat-tails and pussy-willows!\" Long Bill Wren cried out. \"I'm sure I shall never take a mud bath. They seem to me to be very dangerous.\"  \"Not at all!\" Mr. Frog assured him. \"They're as safe as standing on your head.\" And thereupon he stood on his own head, to prove that what he said was true.  Still the company was not moved to take Mr. Frog's advice and try a mud bath. Most of them declared that nothing could induce them to undertake such a risky act. But a few daring ones said that if all the rest would take mud baths, and if they found that they liked them, they themselves would be willing to test them too.  However, nobody took a single step towards the creek. So at last the company scattered, leaving Long Bill Wren and Mr. Frog alone upon the bank.  Meanwhile Long Bill had been thinking deeply. He had begun to wonder whether there might not be some good in a mud bath, in spite of his neighbors' doubts. And now he turned to Ferdinand Frog and began speaking in a hushed voice.  \"Don't tell my wife I asked you this question,\" he said; \"but I should like to know if mud baths are good for rheumatism.\"  \"Good for it!\" Mr. Frog exclaimed. \"Why, they're a sure cure--and the only one!\"     XXII  LEARNING TO HOLD HIS BREATH   There on the bank of Black Creek Mr. Frog and Long Bill Wren talked in whispers about mud baths. And in a short time Long Bill announced that he had made up his mind to try one.  \"Good!\" Mr. Frog cried, as he patted his neighbor on the back. \"And now let me give you a bit of advice. Before you dive into the creek you should learn _to hold your breath_. . . .  \"You'd better go home and begin practising at once.\"  So Long Bill Wren flew into his house and stayed there the rest of that day. But he soon found that all was not as simple as he had hoped. Whenever he was trying to hold his breath his wife was sure to ask him a question. And of course that led to trouble. If he didn't answer her she thought him rude--and said so, quite frankly, too. While if he did answer her, speaking spoiled his practice.  It was annoying, to say the least. And by the next morning the poor fellow was almost frantic.  He sought out Mr. Frog and explained how hard it was for him to learn to hold his breath.  \"If you could only think of some way of making my wife hold hers too!\" Long Bill moaned.  But Mr. Frog said at once that nobody could do that, and there was no use in trying.  \"Why don't you,\" he asked, \"go off by yourself in Cedar Swamp, and practice there?\"  But Long Bill said that he ought not to stay away from home long enough to do that.  \"Then there's only one way left for you,\" Mr. Frog decided. \"You must practice at night, when your wife's asleep.\"  \"A good idea!\" Long Bill whispered. \"I'll try it this very night!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Bright and early the next morning Long Bill Wren found Mr. Frog a little way up the creek and told him that his night's practice had been a great success.  \"I began holding my breath right after sunset,\" he said, \"and it was so easy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24590"],["title","The Tale of Ferdinand Frog (#7)"],["body","I fell asleep. And I never breathed once all night long, until I awoke at day-break.\"  The news delighted Mr. Frog.  \"Good!\" he cried. \"And now there's one more thing you must do before you take a mud bath. You must learn to breathe through your skin. . . . Just try right now,\" he urged his companion.  So Long Bill tried to breathe through his skin, while holding his breath at the same time.  And soon he began to sputter and choke.  \"I'm afraid I can't do it,\" he faltered at last.  Mr. Frog looked somewhat glum--for a moment.  He pondered in silence. And at length he declared that without doubt there must be something wrong with Long Bill's skin!  \"How long have you worn it?\" he inquired.  \"All my life!\" Long Bill told him.  \"That's it!\" Mr. Frog exclaimed. \"It's worn out. You'll have to pull it off and use a fresh one.\"     XXIII  MR. FROG RUNS AWAY   It may have been Mr. Frog's words that dismayed Long Bill Wren, or it may have been his manner--or perhaps both. Anyhow, Long Bill looked frightened.  \"Where can I get a fresh skin if I pull off the one I'm wearing?\" he wanted to know.  \"Why, there's another skin just beneath your old one,\" Mr. Frog informed him glibly. \"Just pull hard and you'll see that I know what I'm talking about.\"  But Long Bill was puzzled.  \"I--I don't know where to begin,\" he stammered.  \"Maybe you need help,\" Mr. Frog suggested.  And Long Bill agreed that he did need help--and a good deal of it, too.  \"Well,\" Mr. Frog said with a giggle, \"I'll get old Mr. Turtle to assist me. And between us we'll have your old skin off before you know it.\"  He began to bellow Mr. Turtle's name at the top of his lungs. And soon the old gentleman's black head popped out of the water. And presently Mr. Turtle waddled up the bank of Black Creek and listened to Ferdinand Frog's directions.  \"You take hold of Long Bill's tail,\" Mr. Frog ordered him, while to the frightened owner of the tail he said cheerfully, \"Anything Mr. Turtle takes hold of just _has_ to come. He never lets go until it does.\"  Now, Long Bill Wren had suddenly made up his mind that he wouldn't take a mud bath, after all. He didn't like the prospect of having his skin pulled off. Suppose Mr. Frog should be mistaken about that second skin, which the tailor claimed lay underneath the old one?  Long Bill believed that with no skin at all he would find his rheumatism much worse than before. And he would certainly be a queer-looking object.  So as old Mr. Turtle crawled slowly towards him, he drew away.  \"I'm going to wait----\" Long Bill announced.  \"Why?\" Mr. Frog demanded.  \"Going to wait till the weather is warmer,\" Long Bill faltered.  Of course Mr. Frog was disappointed by having his plans so upset.  And Mr. Turtle was disappointed too.  \"My mouth is open,\" he told Mr. Frog. \"I must grab something. And it might as well be you.\"  But Mr. Frog jumped nimbly out of Mr. Turtle's reach. And a moment later he thrust the free end of a tree-root between Mr. Turtle's jaws.  They closed with a snap. And Mr. Turtle began to pull.  \"Come on!\" Mr. Frog urged Long Bill Wren. \"The tree may fall at any moment. It's safer elsewhere.\" And without waiting to see what happened, he leaped into Black Creek and swam away.  As for Long Bill Wren, he hurried home. He knew his wife would be wondering where he was, for he had been away from the house in the reeds much longer than his usual ten minutes.  Arriving there, he was not surprised that she asked him a few questions. And he explained to her that he had been on the bank of the creek, watching old Mr. Turtle pulling at the root of a willow.  \"And I can tell you that I'm well pleased that it wasn't my tail Mr. Turtle had in his jaws,\" he said solemnly.  Mrs. Wren shuddered at the mere mention of such an unlucky accident. And then she said: \"I hope that dangerous Mr. Frog was not with you.\"  \"I believe he was there for a time,\" her husband replied. \"But he left before I did.\"  \"I wish you would keep away from him,\" she remarked.  \"I'm going to,\" Long Bill Wren promised. \"Although Mr. Frog is our newest neighbor, I shall have nothing more to do with him.\"   THE END      Little Jack Rabbit Books  (Trademark Registered)  By DAVID CORY  Author of \"Little Journeys to Happyland\"  =Colored Wrappers With Text Illustrations.=   A new and unique series about the furred and feathered little people of the wood and meadow.
