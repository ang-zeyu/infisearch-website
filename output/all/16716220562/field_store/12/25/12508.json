The officers, from the captain to the lowest rank, appeared to have performed their duty faithfully; and all the trouble was in the execution of their orders. In conclusion, he announced that the drill would be resumed in half an hour, and directed the commander to pipe down.  \"That didn't hurt anybody,\" said Howe, as he walked forward with Spencer. \"Let us keep it up.\"  \"We may get caught at it.\"  \"No need of that. Accidents will happen.\"  \"Yes; but they don't happen all over the ship at the same time.\"  \"Well, they may, you know,\" laughed Howe. \"In fact, I don't see how accidents are to be avoided while we have such a fellow as Shuffles for captain. If there is any one in the ship that I despise, it is Shuffles.\"  \"So say we all of us!\"  \"The snivelling, canting, whining puppy! Have you any idea that his merit-marks made him captain of the ship?\" continued Howe.  \"I suppose they did.\"  \"Tell that to the marines! Wasn't he acknowledged to be the worst fellow in the ship when we crossed the Atlantic? Wasn't he the ringleader in all mischief and scrapes?\"  \"But he has reformed.\"  \"Reformed!\" sneered Howe. \"He has turned hypocrite, if that is what you mean by reformed. I don't believe in that sort of bosh.\"  \"He's the pet of the principal and the instructors.\"  \"Yes; and they have given him marks enough to make him captain, just to show good fellows, like you and me, what a saint can do. It is all humbug! Why, he got more marks than Kendall, Gordon, Haven, and the rest of those cabin nobs, who are fit to enter the senior class in a college. I am satisfied that his merit-roll was doctored so as to make it come out as it did.\"  \"I don't believe Lowington would do any such thing as that,\" suggested Spencer, shaking his head.  \"Don't you? Well, I do. What's the use of talking! Didn't Shuffles jump from the steerage into the captain's state-room?\"  \"Any other fellow may do the same thing. Look at Tom Perth, who lost a heap of marks for running off in the Josephine, as the rest of us did. He is second master. If it hadn't been for our scrape, very likely he would have been captain.\"  \"Don't you believe it.\"  \"If Lowington had not been fair, and let every fellow go just where his marks carried him, Perth would not have had a place in the cabin.\"  \"O, the principal only wanted to break us up by taking our best fellow away from us. He couldn't drive Tom Perth, and now he's going to lead him--bait him with sugar and offices.\"  \"Some of the fellows say Shuffles can't handle the ship without the help of the principal,\" said Spencer.  \"Of course he can't!\" exclaimed Howe. \"Hasn't he proved that already? If Paul Kendall had been captain, he would have spotted every fellow that made any trouble. Let us keep it up, Spencer, and we shall soon prove that Shuffles can't handle the ship. That will be enough to satisfy me.\"  The approach of an officer interrupted the conversation; but Howe passed from one to another of the malcontents, and instructed them what to do in the next drill. They were to create all the confusion they could in the discharge of their duty. They were to misunderstand the orders, and to blunder in the execution of them, in such a manner as to conceal their own agency in the mischief, and divide the responsibility of it among their companions. The runaway crew of the Josephine, mortified at their failure, were still fretting because they had not visited Paris and Switzerland. They were ready to listen to evil counsels, and regarding Howe as their leader since the promotion of Perth, they promised to follow his instructions to the letter.  \"What are we going to make by it?\" demanded Sheffield, who doubted the policy of the proceeding.  \"We are going to prove, in the first place, that Shuffles can't handle the ship,\" replied Howe.  \"Perhaps you may prove it, even if you don't believe what you prove.\"  \"But I do believe he can't handle the ship.\"  \"I don't. I hate Shuffles as bad as any fellow, but I believe he is as good a sailor as any person on board, man or boy.\"  \"That's all in your eye!\" retorted Howe, contemptuously. \"He may be able to get along while we are lying in port, but I should like to see him work the ship in a gale of wind.\"  \"He can do it,\" answered Sheffield, confidently. \"But he is a flunky, and spoiled all our fun in the Josephine. I am willing to throw him over for being a hypocrite, and selling us out as he did. What else are we to gain?\"  \"We shall help along our chances of going down the Rhine, and,\" whispered Howe, \"of seeing Paris and Switzerland.\"  \"I don't see it.\"  \"Well, I do. If we cave in and pretend to be lambs when we are lions, we shall have to do duty while the rest of the fellows are having a good time on shore. If we show that we are still wide awake, Lowington will take us with him, because he will not dare to leave us on board.\"  \"He will leave Fluxion with us.\"  \"Not much! I heard some of the fellows say that Fluxion was going to Italy to see his mother, or his sister, or somebody that is sick there.\"  \"I heard that.\"  \"If it is true, Lowington will not leave us behind, especially if he finds we are not as gentle as lambs.\"  \"Perhaps not; but as the matter stands, we are already condemned to stay on board during the rest of the season.\"  \"I know that; but Lowington will let us off.\"  \"He will be more likely to do so if we behave well.\"  \"Not he! Don't you believe it.\"  \"They say Shuffles is teasing him to remit the rest of the penalty.\"  \"Shuffles!\"  \"That's so; and Lowington promised to consider the matter. Tom Perth told me this; and he heard Shuffles talking to the principal about it.\"  \"Humph! I don't want to go on those terms,\" replied Howe, in disgust. \"That's some more of Shuffles's cant! One of his sensations! He thinks he whipped us out on board of the Josephine, and now he wants to be magnanimous with his victims. If we go with the crowd, it will be because Lowington is afraid to leave us behind. We are not a set of babies, Sheffield, to be whipped and sent to bed when we are naughty. Neither are we sailors before the mast, to be kicked here and there, at the pleasure of our masters. What do you suppose the fellows came to Europe for, if it was not to see the country? Are we to be left on board just because we went on a little lark? Not much!\"  \"That's all very good, but it won't go down,\" laughed Sheffield.  \"I'm not going to eat humble pie for any one. Do you mean to tell me I am not as good a fellow as Bob Shuffles?\"  \"I didn't say you were not.\"  \"Am I not his equal?\" demanded Howe.  \"I suppose you are, if you behave as well.\"  \"Behave as well!\" sneered the orator. \"I behave well enough, and I'm not going to be put down, nor beg my rights of Bob Shuffles. If I am left on board, for one, when the fellows go down the Rhine, I intend to break things.\"  \"Don't break your own head.\"  \"Let me alone for that. If our fellows have any spirit at all, they will not be left behind. In the next drill, things will be mixed, and no one can tell who makes the mischief. Our fellows are not the only ones that don't like Shuffles, and you will find that about half the crew will help snarl things up. Now, keep your weather eye open, Sheffield. Take my advice, and don't whimper. Our fellows have a little business in Paris and Switzerland, and we shall attend to it in a week or two. There goes the pipe. Mind your eye, Sheffield.\"  The boatswain's call sounded through the ship, and officers and crew hastened to their stations.     CHAPTER II.  CLOSE QUARTERS.   The malcontents in the ship were, apparently, the most zealous seamen on board. Certainly no one would have suspected them of organizing any mischief, they looked so innocent and so determined to do their duty promptly. Howe, Wilton, Little, and others had done their work thoroughly and secretly. They had arranged at least a dozen different tricks for making confusion among the crew. To each one of the discontented a part had been assigned, which he was to perform in such a way as to conceal his own agency.  Captain Shuffles was planking the quarter-deck with the commodore. Everybody could see that he was not entirely at his ease. His position was a novel one to him, and he was oppressed by its responsibilities, especially since the crew had behaved so badly at the first drill. He could not help knowing that a portion of the crew were opposed to him, and would do anything they could to annoy him. The situation was a difficult one; for, at the commencement of his term of office, he did not wish to have any of the seamen punished for neglect or disobedience, even if he could discover the guilty ones.  Mr. Lowington was not on deck. He had purposely gone below, for he wished the new captain to act on his own responsibility, and overcome the difficulty alone. This was in accordance with his previous course, when, even in a gale of wind, he permitted the young officers to handle the ship without any dictation. Though the action adopted by the boys was not always in accordance with his own judgment, he never interfered unless an obvious and dangerous blunder was made. His policy had worked well thus far, and he was disposed to continue it. In the present instance, he was no better informed than the captain in regard to the real cause of the difficulty. He believed it was merely the effect of a fun-loving spirit on the part of the crew; a mere disposition to haze the new officers a little, and perhaps prove what they were made of. He hoped the new officers would satisfy them, and, if necessary, send a dozen or twenty of the mischief-makers to the mainmast for punishment.  \"All hands, up anchor, ahoy!\" piped the boatswain, after he had received the order from the captain, through the proper officers.  Those whose stations were at the cable and capstan sprang to their places with unwonted alacrity.  \"Bring to, forward!\" added the first lieutenant, giving the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24124"],["title","Down the Rhine; Or, Young America in Germany (#3)"],["body","to attach the messenger. \"Ship and swifter the capstan bars!\"  As it was not intended to get the ship actually under way, only a portion of the work indicated by the orders was really executed. The form of hooking on the messenger was gone through with, as also were the various preparations for catting and fishing the anchor. The capstan bars were inserted in the pigeon-holes.  \"Heave round!\" shouted the first lieutenant; and the order was repeated by the second lieutenant, whose station is on the forecastle.  Everything appeared to be progressing with proper order and regularity, and Captain Shuffles hoped the warning words of the principal had produced an impression upon the minds of the mischief-makers. But appearances are very deceptive. While the hands were walking around the capstan, four of the bars suddenly came out of the pigeon-holes at the same instant, and a dozen of the seamen were thrown, apparently with great violence, upon the deck. The bars, confined at one end by the swifter, swung round and cracked the shins of others, and a scene of confusion ensued, which set at nought all ideas of discipline.  No one was badly hurt, but every one was excited. Those who were not concerned in the plot caught the spirit of mischief from the others, and, with but few exceptions, the crew joined in the sport. The seaman who originated the trouble had simply neglected to insert the pins which confine the capstan bars within the pigeon-holes, or had left the bars with the heads against the pins. As nearly all joined in the frolic, there were none to inform against others, and it was simply impossible for Leavitt, the second lieutenant, or Ellis, the first master,--under whose eye this breach of discipline had occurred,--to determine who the ringleaders were.  Shuffles and the commodore were intensely annoyed at this scene, and immediately went forward. By this time, those who had been thrown upon the deck, which included nearly all at the capstan, had picked themselves up. The Knights looked even more innocent than those whom they had dragged into the scrape, and the high officers from the quarter-deck were no wiser than the lieutenant and master. In the midst of the confusion, Howe and Wilton had removed the pins from the bars, which still remained in the drumhead of the capstan.  \"Mr. Leavitt, how did this happen?\" demanded Captain Shuffles.  \"Half the bars dropped out of the capstan all at once, and the hands were thrown down,\" replied the lieutenant, who was hardly less annoyed than the captain.  \"Were the bars pinned in?\"  \"I supposed they were, sir.\"  Captain Shuffles walked up to the capstan. Not a single pin was inserted.  \"Let your midshipman see that the bars are properly pinned and swiftered next time,\" said the commander, as he walked aft to resume his place on the quarter-deck.  \"Unship the bars!\" said Leavitt; and they were restored to the rack, leaving everything as it was before the drill began.  The crew were piped to muster, and the order to weigh anchor repeated. The capstan bars were shipped, and this time, the midshipman whose station was on the forecastle satisfied himself that they were securely pinned, and so reported to the second lieutenant. As the rogues had made no provision for this state of things, they were thrown upon their own resources for the means of defeating the operation a second time. Commodore Kendall had placed himself in position to watch the movement, and the officers in charge had pinned their eyes wide open, fully resolved that the authors of the trouble should not escape a second time.  Directly abaft the capstan was the fore-hatch, over which lay the path of those who walked around at the bars. Ordinarily the hatch was closed when the capstan was used; but, on the present occasion, a plank had been placed across the aperture, to avoid the necessity of putting on the hatch, and thus excluding the air from the kitchen, where the cooks were baking their daily batch of bread.  \"Heave round!\" said the first lieutenant.  \"Heave round!\" repeated the second lieutenant; and the hands at the capstan began their circular march.  By some means not observed by the vigilant officers, the plank over the fore-hatch slowly travelled along until one end of it barely caught on the combing of the hatch. Half a dozen seamen had given it a kick with their heels as they passed over it, and it was soon in condition to drop into the steerage below. Little stepped upon it, and down it went. Releasing his hold of the bar, he dropped upon the steps below, and disappeared. Sheffield followed him, and then Ibbotson. The hands at the other side of the capstan took care that the party should keep moving. A few well-disposed boys, when they came to the hatch,--which was not more than four feet wide,--leaped across it, as any of them might have done, if they had not been infected with the spirit of mischief.  \"Avast heaving!\" shouted the second lieutenant.  At this instant one of the lambs was on the combing of the hatch, and he must either go over or hang by the bar; so he pushed along, and his movement brought another into a similar position. Seeing how the case was, the rogues kept the capstan going, in spite of the commands of the officers, until two thirds of the gang had dropped into the steerage. It was finally suspended by the efforts of the excited officers, who took hold of the bars with their own hands, and counteracted the efforts of the rogues.  The young rascals in the steerage pretended to be hurt more seriously than they were, though some of them had struck the steps or the floor below with force enough to make them feel a little sore. They began to limp, and to rub their shins and shoulders, their heads and arms, very vigorously, as though they believed that friction was a sovereign remedy for aching bones.  \"Why didn't you stop, Hunter, when I ordered you to do so?\" demanded Leavitt, indignantly.  \"I couldn't, sir,\" replied the lamb, speaking only the simple truth.  \"Yes, you could! I will report you for disobedience.\"  \"I was right over the hatch, and I had either to go down or jump over: I couldn't stop there.\"  \"And you did the same thing, Hyde,\" added the officer.  \"I couldn't help it, sir,\" replied he. \"When Hunter got over, he dragged me so far that I couldn't stop.\"  \"Why didn't you let go, then?\" demanded Leavitt, angrily.  \"I was afraid the next bar would hit me in the head.\"  Both of these boys were ordinarily models of propriety, and they had not, for an instant, intended to do anything out of order. The real culprits were all at the foot of the stairs, rubbing their limbs and making the most terrible contortions, as though their legs, arms, and heads were actually broken. The officers had all seen Hunter and Hyde pushing along the bars after the order had been given to stop. They seemed to be guilty, and they were required to report at the mainmast to the first lieutenant, for discipline. The second lieutenant then went down the fore-hatch, where the appalling spectacle of a crowd of sufferers was presented to his view.  \"Are you hurt, Little?\" he asked, turning to the most prominent victim of the catastrophe.  \"Yes, sir,\" groaned Little, twisting his back-bone almost into a hard knot, and trying to reach the seat of his injury with both hands at the same time.  \"How happened you to fall through?\" inquired Leavitt, more gently than he had spoken on deck, for the sight of all this misery evidently affected him.  \"I don't know, sir,\" answered Little, with one of his most violent contortions. \"I was looking up at the fore-yard arm, and--ugh!--the first thing I knew, I was--O, dear!--I was down here, with that--ugh!--with that plank on top of me.\"  \"Are you much hurt?\"  \"I don't know. It aches first rate,\" cried Little, with a deep, explosive sigh.  \"Well, go aft, and report to the surgeon.\"  \"I don't want to go to the surgeon. He mauls me about to death. I shall be better soon.\"  \"On deck, all who are able to do so!\" added Leavitt. \"Bennington, you will ask Dr. Winstock to attend to those who are hurt, and report to the first lieutenant.\"  But it did not appear that any one was so much injured as to require the services of the surgeon, for the whole party went on deck at the order. Little still writhed and twisted. Howe rubbed his knee, and Spencer nursed his elbow. Commodore Kendall, who had witnessed the whole affair, did not see how it was possible for them to tumble down the hatchway without injuring themselves, and he was willing to believe that the appearance was not deceitful. He had kept his eyes fixed upon the crew as they walked round the capstan, but he was unable to determine whether the mishap was the result of accident or intention.  Again the captain came forward; but after consulting with Paul, he returned to the quarter-deck without making any comments. The two lambs had reported to the first lieutenant, and the matter had gone to Captain Shuffles, who directed the culprits to be sent to the principal. They went into the steerage, and knocking at the door of the main cabin, Mr. Lowington came out, and heard their statement. They were ordered to their mess-rooms to await an investigation.  The hatchway was closed, and the order to man the capstan was given a third time. The injured seamen had in a measure recovered the use of their limbs, and though they still limped and squirmed, they took their places in the line. Either their will or their ingenuity to do mischief failed them, the third time, for the form of heaving up the anchor to a short stay was regularly accomplished. The commodore and all the officers in the forward part of the ship watched the operation with the keenest scrutiny, and when it was successfully finished, they hoped the end of all the mishaps had come.  \"Pawl the capstan! Unship the bars! Stations for loosing sail!\" continued the first lieutenant. \"Lay aloft, sail-loosers!\"  The nimble young tars, whose places were aloft, sprang"]]]
