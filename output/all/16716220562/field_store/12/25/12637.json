TREASON   By  RANDALL GARRETT   Illustrated by Gardner     _The Prisoner_   The two rooms were not luxurious, but MacMaine hadn't expected that they would be. The walls were a flat metallic gray, unadorned and windowless. The ceilings and floors were simply continuations of the walls, except for the glow-plates overhead. One room held a small cabinet for his personal possessions, a wide, reasonably soft bed, a small but adequate desk, and, in one corner, a cubicle that contained the necessary sanitary plumbing facilities.  The other room held a couch, two big easy-chairs, a low table, some bookshelves, a squat refrigerator containing food and drink for his occasional snacks--his regular meals were brought in hot from the main kitchen--and a closet that contained his clothing--the insignialess uniforms of a Kerothi officer.  No, thought Sebastian MacMaine, it was not luxurious, but neither did it look like the prison cell it was.  There was comfort here, and even the illusion of privacy, although there were TV pickups in the walls, placed so that no movement in either room would go unnoticed. The switch which cut off the soft white light from the glow plates did not cut off the infrared radiation which enabled his hosts to watch him while he slept. Every sound was heard and recorded.  But none of that bothered MacMaine. On the contrary, he was glad of it. He wanted the Kerothi to know that he had no intention of escaping or hatching any plot against them.  He had long since decided that, if things continued as they had, Earth would lose the war with Keroth, and Sebastian MacMaine had no desire whatever to be on the losing side of the greatest war ever fought. The problem now was to convince the Kerothi that he fully intended to fight with them, to give them the full benefit of his ability as a military strategist, to do his best to win every battle for Keroth.  And that was going to be the most difficult task of all.  A telltale glow of red blinked rapidly over the door, and a soft chime pinged in time with it.  MacMaine smiled inwardly, although not a trace of it showed on his broad-jawed, blocky face. To give him the illusion that he was a guest rather than a prisoner, the Kerothi had installed an announcer at the door and invariably used it. Not once had any one of them ever simply walked in on him.  \"Come in,\" MacMaine said.  He was seated in one of the easy-chairs in his \"living room,\" smoking a cigarette and reading a book on the history of Keroth, but he put the book down on the low table as a tall Kerothi came in through the doorway.  MacMaine allowed himself a smile of honest pleasure. To most Earthmen, \"all the Carrot-skins look alike,\" and, MacMaine admitted honestly to himself, he hadn't yet trained himself completely to look beyond the strangenesses that made the Kerothi different from Earthmen and see the details that made them different from each other. But this was one Kerothi that MacMaine would never mistake for any other.  \"Tallis!\" He stood up and extended both hands in the Kerothi fashion. The other did the same, and they clasped hands for a moment. \"How are your guts?\" he added in Kerothic.  \"They function smoothly, my sibling-by-choice,\" answered Space General Polan Tallis. \"And your own?\"  \"Smoothly, indeed. It's been far too long a time since we have touched.\"  The Kerothi stepped back a pace and looked the Earthman up and down. \"You look healthy enough--for a prisoner. You're treated well, then?\"  \"Well enough. Sit down, my sibling-by-choice.\" MacMaine waved toward the couch nearby. The general sat down and looked around the apartment.  \"Well, well. You're getting preferential treatment, all right. This is as good as you could expect as a battleship commander. Maybe you're being trained for the job.\"  MacMaine laughed, allowing the touch of sardonicism that he felt to be heard in the laughter. \"I might have hoped so once, Tallis. But I'm afraid I have simply come out even. I have traded nothing for nothing.\"  General Tallis reached into the pocket of his uniform jacket and took out the thin aluminum case that held the Kerothi equivalent of cigarettes. He took one out, put it between his lips, and lit it with the hotpoint that was built into the case.  MacMaine took an Earth cigarette out of the package on the table and allowed Tallis to light it for him. The pause and the silence, MacMaine knew, were for a purpose. He waited. Tallis had something to say, but he was allowing the Earthman to \"adjust to surprise.\" It was one of the fine points of Kerothi etiquette.                       *      *      *      *      *  A sudden silence on the part of one participant in a conversation, under these particular circumstances, meant that something unusual was coming up, and the other person was supposed to take the opportunity to brace himself for shock.  It could mean anything. In the Kerothi Space Forces, a superior informed a junior officer of the junior's forthcoming promotion by just such tactics. But the same tactics were used when informing a person of the death of a loved one.  In fact, MacMaine was well aware that such a period of silence was _de rigueur_ in a Kerothi court, just before sentence was pronounced, as well as a preliminary to a proposal of marriage by a Kerothi male to the _light of his love.  MacMaine could do nothing but wait. It would be indelicate to speak until Tallis felt that he was ready for the surprise.  It was not, however, indelicate to watch Tallis' face closely; it was expected. Theoretically, one was supposed to be able to discern, at least, whether the news was good or bad.  With Tallis, it was impossible to tell, and MacMaine knew it would be useless to read the man's expression. But he watched, nonetheless.  In one way, Tallis' face was typically Kerothi. The orange-pigmented skin and the bright, grass-green eyes were common to all Kerothi. The planet Keroth, like Earth, had evolved several different \"races\" of humanoid, but, unlike Earth, the distinction was not one of color.  MacMaine took a drag off his cigarette and forced himself to keep his mind off whatever it was that Tallis might be about to say. He was already prepared for a death sentence--even a death sentence by torture. Now, he felt, he could not be shocked. And, rather than build up the tension within himself to an unbearable degree, he thought about Tallis rather than about himself.  Tallis, like the rest of the Kerothi, was unbelievably humanoid. There were internal differences in the placement of organs, and differences in the functions of those organs. For instance, it took two separate organs to perform the same function that the liver performed in Earthmen, and the kidneys were completely absent, that function being performed by special tissues in the lower colon, which meant that the Kerothi were more efficient with water-saving than Earthmen, since the waste products were excreted as relatively dry solids through an all-purpose cloaca.  But, externally, a Kerothi would need only a touch of plastic surgery and some makeup to pass as an Earthman in a stage play. Close up, of course, the job would be much more difficult--as difficult as a Negro trying to disguise himself as a Swede or _vice versa__.  But Tallis was--                       *      *      *      *      *  \"I would have a word,\" Tallis said, shattering MacMaine's carefully neutral train of thought. It was a standard opening for breaking the pause of adjustment, but it presaged good news rather than bad.  \"I await your word,\" MacMaine said. Even after all this time, he still felt vaguely proud of his ability to handle the subtle idioms of Kerothic.  \"I think,\" Tallis said carefully, \"that you may be offered a commission in the Kerothi Space Forces.\"  Sebastian MacMaine let out his breath slowly, and only then realized that he had been holding it. \"I am grateful, my sibling-by-choice,\" he said.  General Tallis tapped his cigarette ash into a large blue ceramic ashtray. MacMaine could smell the acrid smoke from the alien plant matter that burned in the Kerothi cigarette--a chopped-up inner bark from a Kerothi tree. MacMaine could no more smoke a Kerothi cigarette than Tallis could smoke tobacco, but the two were remarkably similar in their effects.  The \"surprise\" had been delivered. Now, as was proper, Tallis would move adroitly all around the subject until he was ready to return to it again.  \"You have been with us ... how long, Sepastian?\" he asked.  \"Two and a third _Kronet_.\"  Tallis nodded. \"Nearly a year of your time.\"  MacMaine smiled. Tallis was as proud of his knowledge of Earth terminology as MacMaine was proud of his mastery of Kerothic.  \"Lacking three weeks,\" MacMaine said.  \"What? Three ... oh, yes. Well. A long time,\" said Tallis. _ \"The Board of Strategy asked me to tell you,\" Tallis continued. \"After all, my recommendation was partially responsible for the decision.\" He paused for a moment, but it was merely a conversational hesitation, not a formal hiatus.  \"It was a hard decision, Sepastian--you must realize that. We have been at war with your race for ten years now. We have taken thousands of Earthmen as prisoners, and many of them have agreed to co-operate with us. But, with one single exception, these prisoners have been the moral dregs of your civilization. They have been men who had no pride of race, no pride of society, no pride of self. They have been weak, self-centered, small-minded, cowards who had no thought for Earth and Earthmen, but only for themselves.  \"Not,\" he said hurriedly, \"that all of them are that way--or even the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24302"],["title","The Highest Treason (#1)"],["body","majority. Most of them have the minds of warriors, although, I must say, not _strong__ warriors.\"  That last, MacMaine knew, was a polite concession. The Kerothi had no respect for Earthmen. And MacMaine could hardly blame them. For three long centuries, the people of Earth had had nothing to do but indulge themselves in the pleasures of material wealth. It was a wonder that any of them had any moral fiber left.  \"But none of those who had any strength agreed to work with us,\" Tallis went on. \"With one exception. You.\"  \"Am I weak, then?\" MacMaine asked.  General Tallis shook his head in a peculiarly humanlike gesture. \"No. No, you are not. And that is what has made us pause for three years.\" His grass-green eyes looked candidly into MacMaine's own. \"You aren't the type of person who betrays his own kind. It looks like a trap. After a whole year, the Board of Strategy still isn't sure that there is no trap.\"  Tallis stopped, leaned forward, and ground out the stub of his cigarette in the blue ashtray. Then his eyes again sought MacMaine's.  \"If it were not for what I, personally, know about you, the Board of Strategy would not even consider your proposition.\"  \"I take it, then, that they have considered it?\" MacMaine asked with a grin.  \"As I said, Sepastian,\" Tallis said, \"you have won your case. After almost a year of your time, your decision has been justified.\"  MacMaine lost his grin. \"I am grateful, Tallis,\" he said gravely. \"I think you must realize that it was a difficult decision to make.\"  His thoughts went back, across long months of time and longer light-years of space, to the day when that decision had been made.     _The Decision__   Colonel Sebastian MacMaine didn't feel, that morning, as though this day were different from any other. The sun, faintly veiled by a few wisps of cloud, shone as it always had; the guards at the doors of the Space Force Administration Building saluted him as usual; his brother officers nodded politely, as they always did; his aide greeted him with the usual \"Good morning, sir.\"  The duty list lay on his desk, as it had every morning for years. Sebastian MacMaine felt tense and a little irritated with himself, but he felt nothing that could be called a premonition.  When he read the first item on the duty list, his irritation became a little stronger.  \"_Interrogate Kerothi general.__\"  The interrogation duty had swung round to him again. He didn't want to talk to General Tallis. There was something about the alien that bothered him, and he couldn't place exactly what it was.  Earth had been lucky to capture the alien officer. In a space war, there's usually very little left to capture after a battle--especially if your side lost the battle.  On the other hand, the Kerothi general wasn't so lucky. The food that had been captured with him would run out in less than six months, and it was doubtful that he would survive on Earth food. It was equally doubtful that any more Kerothi food would be captured.  For two years, Earth had been fighting the Kerothi, and for two years Earth had been winning a few minor skirmishes and losing the major battles. The Kerothi hadn't hit any of the major colonies yet, but they had swallowed up outpost after outpost, and Earth's space fleet was losing ships faster than her factories could turn them out. The hell of it was that nobody on Earth seemed to be very much concerned about it at all.  MacMaine wondered why he let it concern him. If no one else was worried, why did he let it bother him? He pushed the thought from his mind and picked up the questionnaire form that had been made out for that morning's session with the Kerothi general. Might as well get it over with.  He glanced down the list of further duties for the day. It looked as though the routine interrogation of the Kerothi general was likely to provide most of the interest in the day's work at that.  He took the dropchute down to the basement of the building, to the small prison section where the alien officer was being held. The guards saluted nonchalantly as he went in. The routine questioning sessions were nothing new to them.  MacMaine turned the lock on the prisoner's cell door and went in. Then he came to attention and saluted the Kerothi general. He was probably the only officer in the place who did that, he knew; the others treated the alien general as though he were a criminal. Worse, they treated him as though he were a petty thief or a common pickpocket--criminal, yes, but of a definitely inferior type. _ General Tallis, as always, stood and returned the salute. \"Cut mawnik, Cunnel MacMaine,\" he said. The Kerothi language lacked many of the voiced consonants of English and Russian, and, as a result, Tallis' use of _B__, _D__, _G__, _J__, _V__, and _Z__ made them come out as _P__, _T__, _K__, _CH__, _F__, and _S__. The English _R__, as it is pronounced in _run__ or _rat__, eluded him entirely, and he pronounced it only when he could give it the guttural pronunciation of the German _R__. The terminal _NG__ always came out as _NK__. The nasal _M__ and _N_ were a little more drawn out than in English, but they were easily understandable.                       *      *      *      *      *  \"Good morning, General Tallis,\" MacMaine said. \"Sit down. How do you feel this morning?\"  The general sat again on the hard bunk that, aside from the single chair, was the only furniture in the small cell. \"Ass well ass coot pe expectet. I ket ferry little exercisse. I ... how iss it set? ... I pecome soft? Soft? Iss correct?\"  \"Correct. You've learned our language very well for so short a time.\"  The general shrugged off the compliment. \"Wen it iss a matteh of learrn in orrter to surfife, one learrnss.\"  \"You think, then, that your survival has depended on your learning our language?\"  The general's orange face contrived a wry smile. \"Opfiously. Your people fill not learn Kerothic. If I cannot answerr questionss, I am uff no use. Ass lonk ass I am uff use, I will liff. Not?\"  MacMaine decided he might as well spring his bomb on the Kerothi officer now as later. \"I am not so certain but that you might have stretched out your time longer if you had forced us to learn Kerothic, general,\" he said in Kerothic. He knew his Kerothic was bad, since it had been learned from the Kerothi spaceman who had been captured with the general, and the man had been badly wounded and had survived only two weeks. But that little bit of basic instruction, plus the work he had done on the books and tapes from the ruined Kerothi ship, had helped him. _ \"Ah?\" The general blinked in surprise. Then he smiled. \"Your accent,\" he said in Kerothic, \"is atrocious, but certainly no worse than mine when I speak your _Inklitch_. I suppose you intend to question me in Kerothic now, eh? In the hope that I may reveal more in my own tongue?\"  \"Possibly you may,\" MacMaine said with a grin, \"but I learned it for my own information.\"  \"For your own what? Oh. I see. Interesting. I know no others of your race who would do such a thing. Anything which is difficult is beneath them.\"  \"Not so, general. I'm not unique. There are many of us who don't think that way.\"  The general shrugged. \"I do not deny it. I merely say that I have met none. Certainly they do not tend to go into military service. Possibly that is because you are not a race of fighters. It takes a fighter to tackle the difficult just because it is difficult.\"  MacMaine gave him a short, hard laugh. \"Don't you think getting information out of _you__ is difficult? And yet, we tackle that.\"  \"Not the same thing at all. Routine. You have used no pressure. No threats, no promises, no torture, no stress.\"  MacMaine wasn't quite sure of his translation of the last two negative phrases. \"You mean the application of physical pain? That's barbaric.\"  \"I won't pursue the subject,\" the general said with sudden irony.  \"I can understand that. But you can rest assured that we would never do such a thing. It isn't civilized. Our civil police do use certain drugs to obtain information, but we have so little knowledge of Kerothi body chemistry that we hesitate to use drugs on you.\"  \"The application of stress, you say, is not civilized. Not, perhaps, according to your definition of\"--he used the English word--\"_cifiliced__. No. Not _cifiliced_--but it works.\" Again he smiled. \"I said that I have become soft since I have been here, but I fear that your civilization is even softer.\"  \"A man can lie, even if his arms are pulled off or his feet crushed,\" MacMaine said stiffly.  The Kerothi looked startled. When he spoke again, it was in English. \"I will say no morr. If you haff questionss to ask, ko ahet. I will not take up time with furtherr talkink.\"  A little angry with himself and with the general, MacMaine spent the rest of the hour asking routine questions and getting nowhere, filling up the tape in his minicorder with the same old answers that others had gotten.  He left, giving the general a brisk salute and turning before the general had time to return it.  Back in his office, he filed the tape dutifully and started on Item Two of the duty list: _Strategy Analysis of Battle Reports_.  Strategy analysis always irritated and upset him. He knew that if he'd just go about it in the approved way, there would be no irritation--only boredom. But he was constitutionally incapable of working that way. In spite of himself, he always played a little game with himself and with the General Strategy Computer.  The only battle of significance in the past week had been the defense of an Earth outpost called Bennington IV. Theoretically, MacMaine was supposed to check over the entire report, find out where the losing side had erred, and feed correctional information into the Computer. But he couldn't resist stopping after he had read the first section: _Information Known to Earth Commander at Moment of Initial Contact_.  Then he would stop and consider how he, personally, would have handled"]]]
