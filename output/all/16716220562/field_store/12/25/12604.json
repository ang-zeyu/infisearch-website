The Lapse of Time.  \"_Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest._\"--Eccles. ix. 10.   Solomon's advice that we should do whatever our hand findeth to do with our might, naturally directs our thoughts to that great work in which all others are included, which will outlive all other works, and for which alone we really are placed here below--the salvation of our souls.  And the consideration of this great work, which must be done with all our might, and completed before the grave, whither we go, presents itself to our minds with especial force at the commencement of a new year.  We are now entering on a fresh stage of our life's journey; we know well how it will end, and we see where we shall stop in the evening, though we do not see the road.  And we know in what our business lies while we travel, and that it is important for us to do it with our \"might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave.\"  This is so plain, that nothing need be said in order to convince us that it is true.  We know it well; the very complaint which numbers commonly make when told of it, is that they know it already, that it is nothing new, that they have no need to be told, and that it is tiresome to hear the same thing said over and over again, and impertinent in the person who repeats it.  Yes; thus it is that sinners silence their conscience, by quarrelling with those who appeal to it; they defend themselves, if it may be called a defence, by pleading that they already know what they should do and do not, that they know perfectly well that they are living at a distance from God, and are in peril of eternal ruin; that they know they are making themselves children of Satan, and denying the Lord that bought them, and want no one to tell them so.  Thus they witness against themselves.  However, though we already know well enough that we have much to do before we die, yet (if we will but attend) it may be of use to hear the fact dwelt upon; because by thinking over it steadily and seriously, we may possibly, through God's grace, gain some deep conviction of it; whereas while we keep to general terms, and confess that this life is important and is short, in the mere summary way in which men commonly confess it, we have, properly speaking, no knowledge of that great truth at all.  Consider, then, what it is to die; \"there is no work, device, knowledge, or wisdom, in the grave.\"  Death puts an end absolutely and irrevocably to all our plans and works, and it is inevitable.  The Psalmist speaks to \"high and low, rich and poor, one with another.\" \"No man can deliver his brother, nor make agreement unto God for him.\" Even \"wise men die, as well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for other[1].\"  Difficult as we may find it to bring it home to ourselves, to realize it, yet as surely as we are here assembled together, so surely will every one of us, sooner or later, one by one, be stretched on the bed of death.  We naturally shrink from the thought of death, and of its attendant circumstances; but all that is hateful and fearful about it will be fulfilled in our case, one by one.  But all this is nothing compared with the consequences implied in it.  Death stops us; it stops our race.  Men are engaged about their work, or about their pleasure; they are in the city, or the field; any how they are stopped; their deeds are suddenly gathered in--a reckoning is made--all is sealed up till the great day.  What a change is this! In the words used familiarly in speaking of the dead, they are no more. They were full of schemes and projects; whether in a greater or humbler rank, they had their hopes and fears, their prospects, their pursuits, their rivalries; all these are now come to an end.  One builds a house, and its roof is not finished; another buys merchandise, and it is not yet sold.  And all their virtues and pleasing qualities which endeared them to their friends are, as far as this world is concerned, vanished. Where are they who were so active, so sanguine, so generous? the amiable, the modest, and the kind?  We were told that they were dead; they suddenly disappeared; that is all we know about it.  They were silently taken from us; they are not met in the seat of the elders, nor in the assemblies of the people, in the mixed concourse of men, nor in the domestic retirement which they prized.  As Scripture describes it, \"the wind has passed over them, and they are gone, and their place shall know them no more.\"  And they have burst the many ties which held them; they were parents, brothers, sisters, children, and friends; but the bond of kindred is broken, and the silver cord of love is loosed. They have been followed by the vehement grief of tears, and the long sorrow of aching hearts; but they make no return, they answer not; they do not even satisfy our wish to know that they sorrow for us as we for them.  We talk about them thenceforth as if they were persons we do not know; we talk about them as third persons; whereas they used to be always with us, and every other thought which was within us was shared by them.  Or perhaps, if our grief is too deep, we do not mention their names at all.  And their possessions, too, all fall to others.  The world goes on without them; it forgets them.  Yes, so it is; the world contrives to forget that men have souls, it looks upon them all as mere parts of some great visible system.  This continues to move on; to this the world ascribes a sort of life and personality.  When one or other of its members die, it considers them only as falling out of the system, and as come to nought.  For a minute, perhaps, it thinks of them in sorrow, then leaves them--leaves them for ever.  It keeps its eye on things seen and temporal.  Truly whenever a man dies, rich or poor, an immortal soul passes to judgment; but somehow we read of the deaths of persons we have seen or heard of, and this reflection never comes across us.  Thus does the world really cast off men's souls, and recognizing only their bodies, it makes it appear as if \"that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts, even one thing befalleth them, as the one dieth so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath, so that a man hath no pre-eminence over a beast, for all is vanity[2].\"  But let us follow the course of a soul thus casting off the world, and cast off by it.  It goes forth as a stranger on a journey.  Man seems to die and to be no more, when he is but quitting us, and is really beginning to live.  Then he sees sights which before it did not even"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24256"],["title","Parochial and Plain Sermons, Vol. VII (of 8) (#1)"],["body","into his mind to conceive, and the world is even less to him than he to the world.  Just now he was lying on the bed of sickness, but in that moment of death what an awful change has come over him!  What a crisis for him!  There is stillness in the room that lately held him; nothing is doing there, for he is gone, he now belongs to others; he now belongs entirely to the Lord who bought him; to Him he returns; but whether to be lodged safely in His place of hope, or to be imprisoned against the great Day, that is another matter, that depends on the deeds done in the body, whether good or evil.  And now what are his thoughts?  How infinitely important now appears the value of time, now when it is nothing to him!  Nothing; for though he spend centuries waiting for Christ, he cannot now alter his state from bad to good, or from good to bad.  What he dieth that he must be for ever; as the tree falleth so must it lie.  This is the comfort of the true servant of God, and the misery of the transgressor.  His lot is cast once and for all, and he can but wait in hope or in dread.  Men on their death-beds have declared, that no one could form a right idea of the value of time till he came to die; but if this has truth in it, how much more truly can it be said after death!  What an estimate shall we form of time while we are waiting for judgment!  Yes, it is we--all this, I repeat, belongs to us most intimately.  It is not to be looked at as a picture, as a man might read a light book in a leisure hour.  _We_ must die, the youngest, the healthiest, the most thoughtless; _we_ must be thus unnaturally torn in two, soul from body; and only united again to be made more thoroughly happy or to be miserable for ever.  Such is death considered in its inevitable necessity, and its unspeakable importance--nor can we ensure to ourselves any certain interval before its coming.  The time may be long; but it may also be short.  It is plain, a man may die any day; all we can say is, that it is unlikely that he will die.  But of this, at least, we are certain, that, come it sooner or later, death is continually on the move towards us.  We are ever nearer and nearer to it.  Every morning we rise we are nearer that grave in which there is no work, nor device, than we were. We are now nearer the grave, than when we entered this Church.  Thus life is ever crumbling away under us.  What should we say to a man, who was placed on some precipitous ground, which was ever crumbling under his feet, and affording less and less secure footing, yet was careless about it?  Or what should we say to one who suffered some precious liquor to run from its receptacle into the thoroughfare of men, without a thought to stop it? who carelessly looked on and saw the waste of it, becoming greater and greater every minute?  But what treasure can equal time?  It is the seed of eternity: yet we suffer ourselves to go on, year after year, hardly using it at all in God's service, or thinking it enough to give Him at most a tithe or a seventh of it, while we strenuously and heartily sow to the flesh, that from the flesh we may reap corruption.  We try how little we can safely give to religion, instead of having the grace to give abundantly.  \"Rivers of water run down mine eyes, because men keep not Thy law,\" so says the holy Psalmist.  Doubtless an inspired prophet saw far more clearly than we can see, the madness of men in squandering that treasure upon sin, which is meant to buy their chief good;--but if so, what must this madness appear in God's sight!  What an inveterate malignant evil is it in the hearts of the sons of men, that thus leads them to sit down to eat, and drink, and rise up to play, when time is hurrying on and judgment coming?  We have been told what He thinks of man's unbelief, though we cannot enter into the depths of His thoughts.  He showed it to us in act and deed, as far as we could receive it, when He even sent His Only-begotten Son into the world as at this time, to redeem us from the world,--which, most surely, was not lightly done; and we also learn His thoughts about it from the words of that most merciful Son,--which most surely were not lightly spoken, \"The wicked,\" He says, \"shall go into everlasting punishment.\"  Oh that there were such a heart in us that we would fear God and keep His commandments always!  But it is of no use to speak; men know their duty--they will not do it.  They say they do not need or wish to be told it, that it is an intrusion, and a rudeness, to tell them of death and judgment.  So must it be,--and we, who have to speak to them, must submit to this.  Speak we must, as an act of duty to God, whether they will hear, or not, and then must leave our words as a witness.  Other means for rousing them we have none.  We speak from Christ our gracious Lord, their Redeemer, who has already pardoned them freely, yet they will not follow Him with a true heart; and what can be done more?  Another year is now opening upon us; it speaks to the thoughtful, and is heard by those, who have expectant ears, and watch for Christ's coming.  The former year is gone, it is dead, there it lies in the grave of past time, not to decay however, and be forgotten, but kept in the view of God's omniscience, with all its sins and errors irrevocably written, till, at length, it will be raised again to testify about us at the last day; and who among us can bear the thought of his own doings, in the course of it?--all that he has said and done, all that has been conceived within his mind, or been acted on, and all that he has not said and done, which it was a duty to say or do.  What a dreary prospect seems to be before us, when we reflect that we have the solemn word of truth pledged to us, in the last and most awful revelation, which God has made to us about the future, that in that day, the books will be opened, \"and another book opened, which is the book of life, and the dead judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works[3]!\"  What would a man give, any one of us, who has any real insight into his polluted and miserable state, what would he give to tear away some of the leaves there preserved!  For how heinous are the sins therein written!  Think of the multitude of sins done by us since we first knew the difference between right and wrong. We have forgotten them, but there we might read them clearly recorded. Well may holy David exclaim, \"Remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions, according to Thy mercy remember Thou me.\"  Conceive, too, the multitude of sins which have so grown into us as to become part of us, and in which we now live, not knowing, or but partially knowing, that they are sins, habits of pride, self-reliance, self-conceit, sullenness, impurity, sloth, selfishness, worldliness. The history of all these, their beginnings, and their growth, is recorded in those dreadful books; and when we look forward to the future, how many sins shall we have committed by this time next year,--though we try ever so much to know our duty, and overcome ourselves!  Nay, or rather shall we have the opportunity of obeying or disobeying God for a year longer?  Who knows whether by that time our account may not be closed for ever?  \"Remember me, O Lord, when Thou comest into Thy kingdom[4].\"  Such was the prayer of the penitent thief on the cross, such must be our prayer. Who can do us any good, but He, who shall also be our Judge?  When shocking thoughts about ourselves come across us and afflict us, \"Remember me,\" this is all we have to say.  We have \"no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom\" of our own, to better ourselves withal.  We can say nothing to God in defence of ourselves,--we can but acknowledge that we are grievous sinners, and addressing Him as suppliants, merely beg Him to bear us in mind in mercy, for His Son's sake to do us some favour, not according to our deserts, but for the love of Christ.  The more we try to serve Him here, the better; but after all, so far do we fall short of what we should be, that if we had but what we are in ourselves to rely upon, wretched are we,--and we are forced out of ourselves by the very necessity of our condition.  To whom should we go?  Who can do us any good, but He who was born into this world for our regeneration, was bruised for our iniquities, and rose again for our justification?  Even though we have served Him from our youth up, though after His pattern we have grown, as far as mere man can grow, in wisdom as we grew in stature, though we ever have had tender hearts, and a mortified will, and a conscientious temper, and an obedient spirit; yet, at the very best, how much have we left undone, how much done, which ought to be otherwise!  What He can do for our nature, in the way of sanctifying it, we know indeed in a measure; we know, in the case of His saints; and we certainly do not know the limit of His carrying forward in those objects of His special favour the work of purification, and renewal through His Spirit.  But for ourselves, we know full well that much as we may have attempted, we have done very little, that our very best service is nothing worth,--and the more we attempt, the more clearly we shall see how little we have hitherto attempted.  Those whom Christ saves are they who at once attempt to save themselves, yet despair of saving themselves; who aim to do all, and confess they do nought; who are all love, and all fear, who are the most holy, and yet confess themselves the most sinful; who ever seek to please Him, yet feel they never can; who are full of good works, yet of works of penance.  All this seems a contradiction to the natural man, but it is not so to those whom Christ enlightens.  They understand in proportion to their illumination, that it is possible to work out their salvation, yet to have it wrought out for them, to fear and tremble at the thought of judgment, yet to rejoice always in the Lord, and "]]]
