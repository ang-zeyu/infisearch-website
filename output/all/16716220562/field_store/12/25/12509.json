Up went the inner ends of the studding-sail booms.  \"Lay out!\" added Goodwin.  \"Lay out!\" repeated the midshipmen in the tops; and the seamen ran out on the foot-ropes to their several stations for loosing sail.  At the same time, the forecastle hands were loosing the fore-topmast staysail, jib, and flying jib, and the after-guard, or quarter-deck hands, were clearing away the spanker.  \"Loose!\" said the executive officer; and the hands removed the gaskets, stoppers, and other ropes, used to confine the sails when furled.  \"Stand by--let fall!\" was the next order.  At this command all the square sails should have dropped from the yards at the same instant, but as a matter of fact, not half of them did drop. Sheets, buntlines, bowlines, lifts, reef-pendants, and halyards were fearfully snarled up. Some of the seamen on the yards were pulling one way, and some another; some declared the snarl was in one place, others in another place. The rogues had realized an undoubted success in the work they had undertaken. Vainly the midshipmen in the tops tried to bring order out of confusion. Those who were actually laboring to untangle the ropes only increased the snarl.  The condition of affairs was duly reported to the captain, who had become very impatient at the long delay. The masters were then sent aloft to help the midshipmen unravel the snarl, but they succeeded no better. It was evident enough to all the officers that this confusion could not have been created without an intention to do it. An accident might have happened on the main or the mizzen-mast, but not on every yard on all three of the masts.  \"What are you about?\" asked Perth, who had been sent into the main-top, as he met Howe.  \"We have come to the conclusion that Bob Shuffles can't handle this ship,\" whispered the ringleader of the mischief, with a significant wink.  \"You are getting us into a scrape.\"  \"Well, we all are in the same boat.\"  \"Don't carry it too far,\" suggested Master Perth.  \"Carry what too far?\" demanded Robinson, the midshipman in the top, who had heard a word or two of the confidential talk--enough to give him an idea of what was in the wind.  \"Dry up, old fellow,\" said Perth, with some confusion, as Howe, who had come down from the yard to cast off a line, sprang back to his place.  \"What did you mean by that remark of yours?\" inquired the midshipman.  \"I told Howe not to carry the end of the buntline too far. It was wound three times around the topsail sheet.\"  \"Was that what you meant?\" asked Robinson, suspiciously.  \"Don't you see that buntline?\" replied Perth. \"It is fouled in the sheet, and he was pulling it through farther, so as to snarl it up still worse.\"  \"All right,\" replied the inferior, who, however, was far from being satisfied with the explanation.  \"All right!\" retorted Perth, smartly. \"Is that the way you address your superior officer. One would think I was responsible to you for my words and actions.\"  \"I didn't mean that,\" added Robinson.  \"What did you mean?\"  \"I only said all right to your explanation.\"  \"You did--did you?\" said Perth, severely. \"Then you called me to an account, and now you acquit me!\"  \"I beg your pardon. Whatever I said, I did not mean anything disrespectful,\" pleaded Robinson.  \"Is this the kind of discipline among the officers? If it is, I don't wonder that the crew get snarled up. I don't like to blow on a fellow, but I'm tempted to send you to the mainmast.\"  \"I didn't mean anything.\"  Master Perth turned from his abashed inferior, ascended the main rigging, and with a few sharp orders, compelled the topmen to unsnarl the ropes. He was afraid the midshipman would report what he had said to the captain, and he had attempted to intimidate him into silence by threatening him with a similar fate.  \"On deck!\" hailed Perth from the top. \"All ready in the main-top, sir,\" he added, when the third lieutenant answered his hail from the waist.  After a delay of half an hour, a like report came down from the fore and mizzen-tops. The masters returned to their stations on deck, and everything was in readiness to continue the manoeuvre. Captain Shuffles was in earnest conversation with Commodore Kendall. A more unsatisfactory state of things could not exist than that which prevailed on board of the Young America. The conduct of the crew amounted almost to mutiny. Those who had maliciously made the mischief, and those who had been engaged in it from a love of fun, had succeeded in confounding those who meant to do their duty. It was impossible to tell who were guilty and who were innocent; for three quarters, at least, of the crew seemed to be concerned in the confusion.  \"It is clear enough that they are hazing me,\" said Captain Shuffles, sadly. \"I don't know that I have done anything to set the fellows against me.\"  \"Certainly not,\" replied Paul, warmly. \"You have only done your duty. I have no doubt those fellows who ran away in the Josephine are at the bottom of it. If I am not very much mistaken, I saw Howe, on the main-topsail yard, tangling up the buntlines and sheets.\"  \"I have heard that these fellows intended to get even with me,\" added Shuffles, with a smile, as though he had not much fear of them.  \"I should keep the crew at work until they did their duty. I would keep them at it night and day, till they can get the ship under way without any confusion,\" added Paul, earnestly.  \"I intend to do that, but I do not like to be hard upon them.\"  \"There is no danger of your being too hard.\"  \"Whether I am hard or not, I'm going to have the work done in ship-shape style, if we drill till morning. All hands, furl sails,\" said he to the first lieutenant.  The boatswain's call sounded through the ship. The necessary orders were given in detail, and after considerable confusion, the sails were all furled, and the ship restored to its original condition.  \"Pipe to muster,\" continued the captain.  Under this order all the officers assembled on the quarter-deck. Captain Shuffles addressed them in the mild tones in which he usually spoke, as though he was not seriously disturbed by the ill conduct of the crew. Assigning a lieutenant, a master, and a midshipman to each mast, he directed them to set each sail separately, without regard to others. They were to set the topsails first, then the other sails up to the royals. Other officers were directed to drill the seamen stationed at the head sails and the spanker.  During this conference Howe and his associates were congratulating themselves upon the success of their vicious schemes, and encouraging each other to persevere if another drill was ordered. They were curious to know what the captain was doing with the officers on the quarter-deck; but they concluded that it was only a meeting to \"howl\" over the miserable discipline of the ship. But their wonderings were soon set at rest by the boatswain's call of \"All hands, make sail, ahoy!\"  They sprang to their stations as zealously as though they had no thought but for the honor of the ship. They soon discovered that a new order of proceeding had been introduced. The masters and midshipmen perched themselves in the rigging, where they could see the movements of every seaman. The adult forward officers--Peaks, the boatswain, Bitts, the carpenter, and Leech, the sailmaker--also went aloft, and stationed themselves on the topmast-stays, so that, besides the lieutenants on deck, the commodore, and the past officers, there were three pairs of sharp eyes aloft to inspect the operations on each sail.  Howe and his associates were not a little disconcerted at this array of inspectors, and still more so when the order was given to loose only the topsails. Peaks, on the main topmast-stay, caught Howe in the very act of passing the gasket through the bight of the buntline. The veteran tar came down upon him with such a torrent of sea slang, that he did not attempt to repeat the act. The topsails were then set as smartly and as regularly as ever before. After the inspectors had seen all the sails set and furled in detail, the topsails, top-gallant sails, and courses, with the jib and spanker, were set as usual, when the vessel got under way.  By the time the routine in detail had been practised two or three times, the officers began to know where to look for the mischief-makers. Peaks had exposed the ringleader, and the conspirators were finally beaten at their own game. But Captain Shuffles was not satisfied; and when the crew were dismissed from muster, he hastened to the main cabin to consult with the principal.  The conspirators, at close quarters, had lost the day, and discipline was triumphant.     CHAPTER III.  A GATHERING STORM.   \"Mr. Lowington, I should like to go to sea for a day or two,\" said Captain Shuffles, when he had obtained the ear of the principal.  \"Go to sea!\" exclaimed Mr. Lowington. \"Why, I thought you were all in a hurry to go down the Rhine.\"  \"I am not at all satisfied with the discipline of the ship,\" answered the new captain. \"It requires about as many officers as seamen to execute any manoeuvre, and I think we need more practice in ship's duty before we make any more tours on shore.\"  \"How did you succeed in your second drill?\"  \"We went through with it after a while; but it was only with two officers in each top, and the adult forward officers on the stays, that we could set a single sail.\"  \"Have you ascertained who is at the root of the mischief?\"  \"Howe, for one.\"  \"The runaways, probably,\" added Mr. Lowington, thoughtfully.  \"I have no doubt all of them were concerned in it; but at least half the crew took part in the mischief. We finally went through all the forms with tolerable precision. Two or three days' service at sea will"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24124"],["title","Down the Rhine; Or, Young America in Germany (#5)"],["body","us to put everything in good working order. The officers also ought to have a little practice in their new stations.\"  \"When do you wish to go to sea?\"  \"Immediately, sir,\" replied Shuffles.  \"To-night?\"  \"Yes, sir. I think any delay would be injurious to discipline. The crew have been hazing the officers now for two hours, and have had the best of it most of the time. If we went to sea without any delay, I think it would be understood.\"  \"You are right, Captain Shuffles. Where is Commodore Kendall?\"  \"In the after cabin, sir.\"  \"Send for him, if you please.\"  The commander sent one of the waiters to call Paul, who presently appeared.  \"Captain Shuffles wishes to go to sea to-night,\" said Mr. Lowington, with a smile, as the young commodore entered the cabin; \"and I think he takes a correct view of the situation.\"  \"To-night!\" exclaimed Paul, whose thought immediately flashed from the ship to the Hôtel de l'Europe, in Havre, where Mr. and Mrs. Arbuckle and Grace were domiciled, having come down from Paris by the morning train, to be in readiness to start with the ship's company for the Rhine.  \"I know what you are thinking about, Paul,\" laughed the principal. \"You may go on shore, and invite the Arbuckles to join us; or, as we can work the ship very well without a commodore, you may stay on shore with them until our return.\"  \"Invite them to go with us,\" suggested Shuffles. \"I think the presence of our friends will have a good effect upon the crew.\"  \"I should be very glad to have them go with us,\" replied Paul.  \"It is a little doubtful whether we return to Havre again, for Brest would be a better place for the vessels to lie during our absence in Germany,\" said Mr. Lowington.  \"We cannot sail at once--can we?\" asked Paul.  \"We can get off this evening,\" replied Mr. Lowington. \"Let the stewards of the ship and the consort go on shore, and get a supply of fresh provisions. The commodore, in the mean time, can wait on the Arbuckles. I see no difficulty in getting off by sunset.\"  \"It will be rather short notice for the Arbuckles,\" suggested Paul.  \"They are ready to go to Germany at an hour's notice, and it will require no more preparation for this voyage. You can go on shore at once, Commodore Kendall. Captain Shuffles, you will hoist the signal for sailing; send a boat to the Josephine, and I will give you a letter for Mr. Fluxion.\"  The arrangement agreed upon, Captain Shuffles went on deck, and directed the first lieutenant to pipe away the commodore's barge. The third lieutenant was detailed to serve in this boat. As its crew went over the side, Captain Shuffles saw that Howe, Spencer, and four others of the runaways were of its number, under the new station bill. This fact induced him to send Peaks with the lieutenant in charge, so as to guard against any mischief. The third cutter was sent to the Josephine, with the principal's letter. In this boat, Little was the only runaway. The first cutter soon after left the ship with the steward, to bring off a load of fresh provisions.  As the third cutter was obliged to wait for Mr. Fluxion to write an answer to Mr. Lowington's letter, the crew were allowed to go on board of the Josephine. The sight of the signal for sailing, which had been hoisted on board of the Young America, caused no little excitement in the consort, as, in fact, it did on board of the ship. It looked like a very sudden movement, for all were anticipating their departure for Germany by the next or the following day. The principal had told them they would leave in a few days, and not a word had been said about going to sea in the interim.  \"What's up?\" asked Greenway, one of the runaways, who had been transferred to the Josephine, as Little came on deck.  \"I don't know--only that we are going to sea,\" replied Little. \"We have had high times on board of the ship.\"  \"What have you been doing?\"  \"Hazing Shuffles,\" said Little, in a whisper.  \"And I'll bet that is the reason why we are going to sea, instead of going to Germany,\" answered Greenway, with something like disgust in his looks and in the tones of his voice.  \"No matter; we have proved that Shuffles can't handle the ship. He had to call on old Peaks to help him before he could get the main-topsail set.\"  \"But if you play these games we shall be left on board while the rest of the fellows go down the Rhine.\"  \"Not much! Fluxion is going to Marseilles to see his grandmother, or somebody else, and if we only make mischief enough, Lowington won't dare to leave us on board.\"  Little explained the views of Howe, which he had adopted as his own, to the effect that the more mischief they made, the better would be their chances of joining the excursion to Germany. Greenway was foolish enough to take the same view of the question. If the vice-principal was obliged to go away, Mr. Lowington would not dare to leave the runaways with any other person.  \"But we don't want to go to Germany,\" added Little.  \"Why not?\"  \"Simply because we have not been to Paris and Switzerland,\" replied the little villain, as he led his companion to the forecastle, where no one could overhear them. \"We are going to have the time we bargained for when we sailed in the Josephine. If we go with the rest of the fellows, we intend to take French leave of them as soon as we find an opportunity to do so. On the whole, I had just as lief stay if Fluxion is not to have the care of us, for we can slip through the hands of any other man in the squadron.\"  \"There is some money in Paris waiting for me,\" said Greenway.  \"There is some waiting for a lot of our fellows,\" replied Little. \"I intend to claim mine as soon as the party begin to go down the Rhine.\"  \"What's the plan? How are the fellows to get off?\" asked Greenway.  \"Every one must manage that to suit himself. We had better go in little parties of three or four.\"  \"O, no; it's better to keep together,\" protested Greenway.  \"I don't think so. If we attempt to do anything together again, we shall be watched. We must look out for our chances.\"  \"But our fellows are separated now, and we can't do anything alone.\"  \"Yes, you can. When you see a good opportunity to start for Paris, start. That's all you have to do.\"  \"I don't like this way.\"  \"It's the best way. Don't you see that when we are missed we can all be caught in a bunch again. If we go in a dozen different squads, they will to chase us in as many different directions. If we start with the fellows for Germany, we shall step out as we have the chance to do so. I don't believe in more than two or three going together.\"  \"But some of us may not have any money,\" suggested Greenway.  \"Then they must borrow some of those who have it.\"  \"Lowington got hold of two or three drafts, or bills, sent to the fellows.\"  \"Only two or three,\" replied Little, lightly. \"Those fellows can either borrow, or go with the lambs.\"  The Knights of the Red Cross, afterwards of the Golden Fleece, had written to their fathers, asking them for remittances to be sent to Paris, where, after sailing around to Marseilles in the Josephine, and going the rest of the way by railroad, they were to get their letters. Most of their parents had complied with the request, but two or three of them had taken the precaution to inform the principal of the fact, and the bills had been cashed, the proceeds being placed to the credit of the students in whose favor they had been drawn. As long as the boys wrote home, the fathers and mothers seldom communicated with the principal. Most of the rogues had been informed in their letters from home that the money wanted had been remitted, and awaited their order in Paris. The runaways, therefore, would be in funds sufficient for their stolen excursion as soon as they could reach their destination. The only thing that disturbed them was the difficulty of obtaining enough in the beginning to pay their railroad fare to Paris.  While Little was instructing Greenway in the programme for the future, the crew of the third cutter were called away, and the conference was abruptly closed. The purport of the letter which the officer in charge of the boat bore to the principal, was, that Mr. Fluxion did not desire to leave the consort for his visit to Marseilles until the close of the week. Howe was perhaps nearer the truth than he really believed when he declared that Mr. Lowington would not dare to leave the runaways on board of either vessel in charge of any other person than the vice-principal. He had been strongly inclined to grant the petition of Shuffles in their favor; but when it was almost proved that the party were the cause of all the confusion which had occurred on board of the ship during the afternoon, that they were in a mutinous frame of mind, he was not willing to encourage their insubordination. He was much disturbed by the difficult problem thus thrust upon him. Dr. Carboy, the professor of natural philosophy and chemistry, who had spent several years in Germany, had volunteered to take charge of the runaways, and he seemed to be the only person who was available for this duty. He was no sailor, and only a fair disciplinarian, and Mr. Lowington had not entire confidence in his ability to manage thirty of the wildest boys in the squadron--discontented under the punishment to which they were subjected.  Though everything was orderly on board of the ship, there was a great deal of suppressed excitement, not to say indignation, for the crew did not like the idea of keeping watch and reefing topsails, instead of voyaging down the beautiful Rhine. The movement looked like a punishment, and many of the crew felt themselves to be entirely innocent of the blunders and failures made in handling the ship. They had done their best, and thought it was not fair to punish the innocent with the guilty. Doubtless it was not fair; but it was a question which related to the discipline of the crew, as a whole, and not a dozen of those who had made the mischief could be identified,"]]]
