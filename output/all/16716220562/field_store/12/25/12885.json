There was a noise out on the road. \"Listen!\" she said. \"Go look the window out, now; someone is coming the yard in!\"  Aaron hastened to lift the green roller-blind over the parlor window. \"Ach; it is the _groesie Fisch_, Sarki Kazunzumi, with half the folk from town,\" he said. \"Stay here, woman. I will out and talk with them.\"  The Sarki sat astride his white pony, staring as Aaron approached him. Behind their chief, on lesser beasts, sat Kazunzumi's retainers, each with a bundle in his arms. \"Welcome, O Sarki!\" Aaron said, raising his fist.  Kazunzumi did not return the Amishman's salute. \"I return your gifts, Lightless One,\" he announced. \"They are tainted with your blasphemy.\" He nodded, and his servants dismounted to stack at the side of the road Aaron's guest-gifts of months before. The bale of tobacco was set down, the bolt of scarlet silk, the chains of candy, the silver-filigreed saddle. \"Now that I owe you naught, Bearded One, we have no further business with one another.\" He reined his horse around. \"I go in sadness, Haruna,\" he said.  \"What did I do, Kazunzumi?\" Aaron asked. \"What am I to make of your displeasure?\"  \"You have failed us, who was my friend,\" the Sarki said. \"You will leave this place, taking your woman and your beasts and your sharp-shod horses.\"  \"Sir, where am I to go?\"  \"Whence came you, Haruna?\" the Sarki asked. \"Return to your own black-garbed folk, and injure the Mother no longer with your lack of understanding.\"  \"Sarki Kazunzumi, I know not how I erred,\" Stoltzfoos said. \"As for returning to my own country, that I cannot. The off-world vessel that brought us here is star-far away; and it will not return until we are all five summers older. My Martha is besides with child, and cannot safely travel. My land is ripe for seeding. How can I go now?\"  \"There is wilderness to the south, where no son of the Mother lives,\" the Sarki said. \"Go there. I care not for heathen who are out of my sight.\"  \"Sir, show us mercy,\" Aaron said.  Kazunzumi danced his shoeless horse around to face Aaron. \"Haruna, who was my friend, whom I thought to stand with me in Mother's light, I would be merciful; but I cannot be weak. It is not me whom you must beseech, but the Mother who feeds us all. Make amends to Her, then Sarki Kazunzumi will give his ear to your pleas. Without amends, Haruna, you must go from here within the week.\" Kazunzumi waved his arm and galloped off toward Datura. His servants followed quickly. On the roadside lay the gifts, dusted from the dirt raised by the horses.         *       *       *       *       *  The Amishman turned toward the house. Martha's face was at the parlor window, quizzical under her prayer-covering, impatient to hear what had happened. Aaron plodded back to the house with the evil news, stumbling over a clod of earth in the new-turned furrows near the road. Martha met him at the door. \"_Waas will er?_\" she demanded.  \"He says we must leave our farm.\"  \"Why for?\" she asked.  \"Somehow, I have offended their _fadommt_ Mum-god,\" Aaron said. \"The Sarki has granted us a week to make ready to go into the wilderness.\" He sat on a coffee-colored kitchen chair, his head bowed and his big hands limp between his knees.  \"Stoltz, where can we go?\" Martha asked. \"We have no _Freindschaft_, no kin, in all this place.\"  Aaron tightened his hands into fists. \"We will not go!\" he vowed. \"I will find a way for us to stay.\" He broke open the box of cigars that had been meant as a gift for Musa and clamped one of the black stogies between his teeth. \"What is their _heidisch_ secret?\" he demanded. \"What does the Mother want of me?\"  \"Aaron Stoltz,\" Martha said vigorously, \"I'll have no man of mine offering dignity to a heathen god. The _Schrift_ orders us to cut down the groves of the alien gods, to smash their false images; not to bow before them. Will you make a golden calf here, as did your namesake Aaron of Egypt, for whose sin the Children of Israel were plagued?\"  \"Woman, I'll not have you preach to me like a servant of the Book,\" Aaron said. \"It is not for you to cite Scripture.\" He stared through the window. \"What does the Mother want of me?\"  \"As you shout, do not forget that I am a mother, too,\" Martha said. She dabbed a finger at her eye.  \"_Fagep mir_, Liebling,\" Aaron said. He walked behind the chair where his wife sat. Tenderly, he kneaded the muscles at the back of her neck. \"I am trying to get inside Musa's head, and Kazunzumi's; I am trying to see their world through their eyes. It is not an easy thing to do, Martha. Though I lived for a spell among the 'English,' my head is still House-Amish; a fat, Dutch cheese.\"  \"It is a good head,\" Martha said, relaxing under his massage, \"and if there be cheese-heads hereabouts, it's these blackfolk that wear them, and not my man.\"  \"If I knew what the die-hinker our neighbors mean by their Mother-talk, it might be I could see myself through Murnan eyes, as I can hear a bit with Hausa ears,\" Aaron said. \"_Iss sell nix so_, Martha?\"  \"We should have stood at home, and thought with our own good heads,\" she said.  \"Let me think,\" Aaron said. \"If I were to strike you, wife,\" he mused, \"it could do you great hurt, and harm our unborn child, _Nee?_\"  \"Aaron!\" Martha scooted out from under her husbands kneading hands.  \"_Druuvel dich net!_\" he said. \"I am only thinking. These blackfolk now, these neighbors who were before last night our friends, speak of Light as our bishop at home speaks of Grace. To have it is to have all, to be one with the congregation. If I can find this Light, we and the Sarki and his people can again be friends.\" Aaron sat down. \"I must learn what I have done wrong,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Other than drink a glass of cider now and then, and make worldly music with a guitar, you've done no wrong,\" Martha said stubbornly. \"You're a good man.\"  \"In the Old Order, I am a good man, so long as no _Diener_ makes trouble over a bit of singing or cider,\" Aaron said. \"As a guest on Murna, I have done some deed that has hurt this Mother-god, whom our neighbors hold dear.\"  \"Heathenish superstition!\"  \"Martha, love, I am older than you, and a man,\" Aaron said. \"Give me room to think! If the goddess-Mother is heathen as Baal, it matters not; these folk who worship her hold our future in their hands. Besides, we owe them the courtesy not to dance in their churches nor to laugh at their prayers; even the 'English' have more grace than that.\" Aaron pondered. \"Something in the springtime is the Murnan Mother's gift, her greatest gift. What?\"  \"Blaspheme not,\" Martha said. \"Remember Him who _causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth_.\"  \"Wife, is the True God less, if these people call Him Mother?\" Aaron demanded.  \"We are too far from home,\" the woman sighed. \"Such heavy talk is wearisome; it is for bishops to discourse so, not ordinary folk like us.\"  \"If I can't find the light,\" Aaron said, \"this farm we live on, and hoped to leave to our children, isn't worth the water in a dish of soup.\" He slapped his hands together and stood to pace. \"Martha, hear me out,\" he said. \"If a woman be with child, and a man takes her with lust and against her will, is not that man accursed?\"  \"Aaron!\" she said. \"_Haagott_, such wicked talk you make!\"  \"Seen with Murnan eyes, have I not done just such a cursed thing?\" Aaron demanded. \"The Mother-god of this world is _mit Kinndt_, fat with the bounty of springtime. So tender is the swollen belly of the earth that the people here, simple folk with no more subtle God, strip the iron from the hoofs of their horses not to bruise her. They bare their feet in her honor, treat her with the tenderness I treat my beloved Martha. And to this Goddess, swollen earth, I took the plow! Martha, we are fortunate indeed that our neighbors are gentle people, or I would be hanged now, or stoned to death like the wicked in the old days. _Ich hot iere Gotterin awgepockt_: I raped their Goddess!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Martha burst into tears. When Aaron stepped forward to comfort her, she struck his chest with her balled fists. \"Stoltz, I wed you despite your beer-drinking from cans at the Singing, though you play a worldly guitar and sing the English songs, though people told me you drove your gay Uncle Amos' black-bumpered Ford before you membered to the district; still, house-Amish pure Old Order though my people are, I married you, from love and youngness and girlish ignorance. But I do not care, even in this wilderness you've brought us to in that big English ship, to hear such vileness spoke out boldly. Leave me alone.\"  \"I'll not.\"  \"You'd best,\" she said. \"I'm sore offended in the lad I'm wifed to.\"  \"Love, _Ich bin sorry_,\" Aaron said. \"The Book, though, says just what our neighbors told me: Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. I have found the truth, the truth of our dark-skinned friends. I did not want to wound the ears of _da Oppel fuun mein Awk_, apple-of-mine-eye sweet Martha; but I must speak out the truth.\"  \"It is not good enough,\" Martha sobbed, \"that you accept this brown-skinned, jewel-bedizzened woman-god; but you must make love to her; and I, wed to you by the Book, nine months gone with _Kinndt_, am to make no fuss.\"  \"I loved the Mother-god with the plow, and accidentally,\" Aaron bellowed. \"_Haagott!_ woman; have you no funny?\"  \"I will birth our child in my lap from laughing,\" Martha said, weeping. \"Aaron, do what you will. I can hardly walk home to my Mem to bear a son in my girlhood bedroom. We are like _Awduum uuu Ayf_, like you said; but the serpent in this Eden pleases me not.\"  \"When I spoke of colts, and the borning of them,\" Aaron said, \"I forgot me that mares are more sensible than human women. Martha, _liebe_ Martha, you wed a man when you married me. All your vapors are naught "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24567"],["title","Blind Man's Lantern (#7)"],["body","my having seen the light. If to stay here, on this land already watered with my hard sweat, I had to slaughter cattle in sacrifice to the Mother, I'd pick up the knife gladly, and feel it no blasphemy against our God.\"  \"Aaron Stoltz,\" Martha said, \"I forbid you to lend honor to this god!\"  Aaron sat. He unlaced his shoes and tugged them off. \"Woman,\" he asked softly, \"you forbid me? Martha, for all the love I bear you, there is one rule of our folk that's as holy as worship; and that's that the man is master in his house.\" He pulled off his black stockings and stood, barefoot, with callouses won on the black earth of his father's farm; dressed otherwise meetly as a deacon. \"I will walk to Datura on my naked feet to show our friends I know my wrong-doing, that I have hurt the belly of the pregnant earth. I will tell Sarki Kazunzumi that I have seen his light; that my horses will be unshod as I am, that the Mother will not feel my plow again until the grasses spring, when her time will be accomplished.\"  Martha crossed her hands about her middle. \"Ach, Stoltz,\" she said. \"Our _Buu iss reddi far geh_, I think. Today will be his birthday. Don't let your tenderness to the earth keep you from walking swiftly to Datura; and when you return, come in a wagon with the Sarki's ladies, who understand midwifery. I think they will find work here.\"  \"I will hurry, Mother,\" Aaron promised.   The End."]]]
