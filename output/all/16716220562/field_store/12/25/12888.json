The Man in the Moon seemed to have a different idea of hospitality, for he immediately said:  \"My wife, Ulul, will soon be here and we will have a dance. Mind you don't laugh, or she will slice you in two with her knife and feed you to my ermine which is in yon little house outside.\"  Before long a woman entered carrying an oblong chopping-bowl in which lay her chopping-knife. She set it down and stooped forward, turning the bowl as if it were a whirligig. Then she commenced dancing; and when she turned her back toward the stranger he saw that she was hollow. She had no back, backbone, or insides, but only lungs and heart.  Her husband presently joined in the dance, and their attitudes and grimaces were so ludicrous that the stranger could scarcely keep from laughing. He did not wish to be impolite, so he kept turning his face aside and pretending to cough. Fortunately for him, just as he thought he would surely explode with laughter, he recalled the warning the man had given him and rushed out of the house. The Man guessed what was the matter with him, and called out:  \"Better call your white bear mascot!\"  He did so, and escaped unhurt.  However, he went into the house another day and succeeded in keeping his face straight, so when their performance was ended the Man in the Moon was very friendly to him and showed him all around the house and let him look into a small building near the entrance.  In this building there were large herds of deer which seemed to be roaming over vast plains. The Man in the Moon said, \"You may choose one of these for your own,\" and as soon as he did so the animal fell through a hole and alighted on the earth right by the conjurer's hut.  In another building there were many seals swimming in an ocean, and he was allowed to choose one of these, which also fell down to his hut.  \"Now you have seen all I can show you, and you may go home,\" said the Moon Man. So the conjurer called his mascot and rode down through the air to his hut.  There his body had lain motionless while his spirit was away, but now it revived. The cords with which his hands and knees had been bound dropped off, though they had been tied in hard knots. The conjurer felt quite exhausted from his trip, but when the lamps were lighted he told his eager neighbors all that he had seen during his flight to the Moon.     X  WHAT THE MAN IN THE MOON DID   Long ago there was a poor little orphan boy who had no home and no one to protect him. All the inhabitants of the village neglected and abused him. He was not allowed to sleep in any of the huts, but one family permitted him to lie outside in the cold passage among the dogs who were his pillows and his quilt. They gave him no good meat, but flung him bits of tough walrus hide such as they gave to the dogs, and he was obliged to gnaw it as the dogs did, for he had no knife.  The only one who took pity on him was a young girl, and she gave him a small piece of iron for a knife. \"You must keep it hidden, or the men will take it from you,\" she said.  He did not grow at all because he had so little food. He remained poor little Quadjaq, and led a miserable life. He did not dare even to join in the play of the boys, for they called him a \"poor little shriveled bag of bones,\" and were always imposing upon him on account of his weakness.  When the people gathered in the singing house he used to lie in the passage and peep over the threshold. Now and then a man would take him by the nose and lift him into the house and make him carry out a jar of water. It was so large and heavy that he had to take hold of it with both hands and his teeth. Because he was so often lifted by his nose, it grew very large, but he remained small and weak.  At last the Man in the Moon, who protects all the Eskimo orphans, noticed how the men ill-treated Quadjaq, and came down to help him. He harnessed his dappled dog to his sledge and drove down. When he was near the hut he stopped the dog and called, \"Quadjaq, come out.\"  The boy thought it was one of the men who wanted to plague him, and he said, \"I will not come out. Go away.\"  \"Come out, Quadjaq,\" said the Man from the Moon, and his voice sounded softer than the voices of the men. But still the boy hesitated, and said, \"You will cuff me.\"  \"No, I will not hurt you. Come out,\" said the Moon Man.  [Illustration: HE LIFTED THE BOWLDER AS IF IT HAD BEEN A PEBBLE]  Then Quadjaq came slowly out, but when he saw who it was he was even more frightened than if it had been one of the men standing there. The Moon Man took him to a place where there were many large boulders and made him lie across one as if he were to be paddled. Quadjaq was scared but he did not dare disobey.  The Man from the Moon took a long, thin ray of moonlight and whipped the boy softly with it.  \"Do you feel stronger?\" he asked.  \"Yes, I feel a little stronger,\" said the lad.  \"Then lift yon boulder,\" said the Man.  But Quadjaq was not able to lift it, so he was whipped again.  \"Do you feel stronger now?\" asked the Man.  \"Yes, I feel stronger,\" said Quadjaq.  \"Then lift the boulder.\"  But again he was not able to lift the stone more than a foot from the ground, and he had to be whipped again. After the third time he was so strong that he lifted the boulder as if it had been a pebble.  \"That will do now,\" said the Man from the Moon. \"Rays of light even from the Moon give you strength. To-morrow morning I shall send three bears. Then you may show what power you have.\"  The Man then got into his sledge and went back to his place in the Moon.  Every time a moonbeam had hit Quadjaq he had felt himself growing. His feet began first and became enormously large, and when the Man left him, he found himself a good-sized man.  In the morning he waited for the bears, and three bears did really come, growling and looking so fierce that the men of the village ran into their huts and shut the doors. But Quadjaq put on his boots and ran down to the ice where the bears were. The men peering out through the window holes said, \"Can that be Quadjaq? The bears will soon eat the foolish fellow.\"  But he seized the first one by its hind legs and smashed its head on an iceberg near which it was standing. The next one fared no better. But the third one he took in his arms and carried it up to the village and let it eat some of his persecutors.  \"That is for abusing me!\" he cried. \"That is for ill-treating me!\"  Those that he did not kill ran away never to return. Only a few who had been kind to him when he was a poor skinny boy were spared. Among them, of course, was the girl who had given him the knife, and she became his wife.     XI  THE GUEST   An old hag lived in a house with her grandson. She was a very bad woman who thought of nothing but playing mischief. She was a witch and tried to harm everybody with witchcraft.  One time a stranger came to visit some friends who lived in a house near the old woman. The visitor was a fine hunter and went out with his host every morning and they brought home a great deal of game. It made the old woman envious to see her neighbor have so much to eat, while she had little, and she determined to kill the visitor.  She made a soup of wolf's and man's brains, which was the most poisonous food she could think of. Then she sent her grandson to invite the stranger to eat supper at her house.  \"Tell him that I desire to be polite to the guest of my neighbor, but be sure you do not tell him what I have cooked.\"  The boy went to the neighboring hut and said, \"Stranger, my grandmother invites you to come to her hut and have a good feast on a supper that she has cooked. She told me not to say that it is a wolf's and a man's brains, and I do not say it.\"  The man thought a moment, and then replied, \"Tell your grandam that I will come.\"  He went to the hut where the old woman pretended to be very glad to see him. They sat down at the table and while she was placing a large dish of soup before him, he put a bowl on the floor between his feet. He excused himself for putting his hand before his mouth because his front teeth were gone, and every time he poured the spoonful into the bowl.  When he had finished he said, \"It is the custom in my tribe to bring your hostess a bit of some delicious food to show that you appreciate her hospitality. Here is a bowl of rare food which I give to you, but it will not be good unless you eat it at once.\"  He gave the soup to the old witch, and the moment she tasted the broth she herself had prepared she fell down dead.     XII  THE ORIGIN OF THE NARWHAL   A long, long time ago a widow lived with her young son and daughter in a small hut. They had a hard time to get enough to eat. But the boy was anxious to do all he could, and while he was still quite small he made a bow and arrows of walrus tusks which he found under the snow. With these weapons he shot birds for their food.  He had no snow goggles and one day when the sun shone bright and he was hunting, he became utterly blind. He had a hard time finding his way back to the hut and when he got there without any game, his mother was so disappointed that instead of pitying him for his blindness she became angry with him.  From that time she ill-treated him, never giving him enough to eat. He was a growing boy and needed a great deal of food, and she thought he wanted more than his share, so she gave him less, and would not allow her daughter to give him anything. So the boy lived on, half starving, and was very unhappy.  One day a polar bear came to the hut and thrust his head right through the window. They were all much frightened, and the mother gave the boy his bow and arrows and told him to kill the animal.  \"But I cannot see the window and I shall miss the bear. Then it will be furious and will eat us,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24569"],["title","A Treasury of Eskimo Tales (#5)"],["body"," said.  \"Quick, brother! I will level the bow,\" said his sister.  So he shot and killed the bear, and the mother and sister went out and skinned it and buried the meat in the snow.  \"Don't you dare to tell your brother that he killed the bear,\" said the mother. \"We must make this meat last all winter.\"  When they went back into the hut she said to her son, \"You missed the bear. He ran away as soon as he saw you take your bow and arrow. We have been following him a long way into the woods.\"  The sister did not dare to tell her brother. She and her mother lived on the meat for a long time while the boy was nearly starving. But sometimes when the mother was away, the girl gave him meat, for she loved her brother dearly and used to weep because she knew he was hungry.  One day a loon flew over the hut, and, seeing the poor blind boy at the door, resolved to restore his eyesight. The bird perched on the roof and kept calling, \"_Quee moo! Quee moo!_\" which sounded to the lad like \"Come here! Come here!\"  He went out and followed the bird to the water. There the loon took the boy on its back and dived with him to the bottom. The loon is a great diver and can stay for a long time under water, but it knew the boy could not. So it came to the surface soon and asked, \"Can you see anything?\"  \"No, I cannot see anything as yet,\" answered the boy.  They dove again and remained a longer time. Again when they came up the loon asked, \"Can you see now?\"  \"I can see a dim shimmer,\" replied the boy.  \"Take a long, long breath and hold it while we go down,\" said the loon. \"When you can hold it no more, let it come out very gradually. As soon as the bubbles of air begin to rise I will know that you must come to the surface and will bring you.\"  The third time they remained a long while under water, and when they rose to the surface the boy could see as well as ever. He thanked the loon very heartily, and it said to him:  \"Go to your home now; but promise me never again to shoot a bird.\"  He gladly promised, and then ran away to his hut. There he found the skin of the bear he had shot hanging up to dry. He was so angry that he tore it down and, entering the hut, demanded of his mother, \"Where did you get the bearskin that is hanging outside the house?\"  His mother perceived that he had recovered his sight and that he suspected the truth about the bear. She was frightened at his anger and sought to pacify him.  \"Come here,\" she said, \"and I will give you the best I have. But I have no one to support me and am very poor. Come here and eat this. It is very good.\"  The boy did not go near. Again he asked, \"Where did you get the bearskin that I saw hanging outside the door?\"  She was afraid to tell him the truth, so she said, \"A boat came here with many men in it and they gave me the skin.\"  The boy did not believe her story. He was sure that it was the skin of the bear he had shot. But he said nothing more. His mother was anxious to make peace with him, and offered him food and clothing, which he refused to take.  He went to the other Inuit who lived in the same village and made a spear and a harpoon of the same pattern as they used. Then he watched them throw the harpoons, and in a short time he became an expert hunter and could catch many white whales.  But he could not forget his anger at his mother. He said to his sister, \"I will not come home while our mother lives in the house. She abused me while I was blind and helpless, and she mistreated you for pitying me. We will not kill her, but we will get rid of her and then live together. Will you do what I have planned?\"  She agreed. Then he went to hunt white whales. As he had no kayak he stood on shore, winding the end of the harpoon string around his body, and taking a firm footing so he could hold the whale until it quieted down and died. Sometimes his sister went along to help him hold the line.  One day his mother went to the beach, and he tied the string around her body and told her to take a firm footing. She was a trifle nervous for she had never done the thing before, and she said, \"Harpoon a small dolphin, else I may not be able to hold it, if it is large enough to make a strong pull.\"  After a short time a young animal came up to breathe, and she cried, \"Kill that one. I can hold it.\"  \"No, that one is too large,\" he said.  Again a small dolphin came near, and the mother shouted, \"Spear that.\" But he said, \"No, it is too large and strong.\"  At last a huge animal arose quite near, and immediately he threw his harpoon, taking care to wound but not to kill it, and at the same time pushing his mother into the water.  \"That is because you abused me,\" he cried, as the white whale dragged her into the sea.  Whenever she came to the surface to breathe she cried \"_Louk! Louk!_\" and gradually she became transformed into a narwhal.     XIII  WHAT THE ESKIMO BELIEVES  HOW MEN WERE CREATED   The first human beings who appeared on the Diomede Islands were a man and a woman who came down from the sky. These two lived on the island for a long time, but had no children.  At last the man took some ivory from a walrus and carved out five images from it. Then he took some wood and carved five more images, and set all of them aside. The next morning the ten images had turned into people. Those from the ivory dolls were men, hardy and brave; those from the wood were women, soft and timid.  From these ten people came the inhabitants of the islands.   THE FLOOD  In the first days that people can remember there was a flood which covered all the earth except one very high peak in the middle. The water rose up from the sea and covered all the land except the top of this mountain, and the only animals that were not drowned were a few that went up this mountain. A few people escaped by going into their boats and living on the fish they caught until the water subsided.  After the waters lowered, these people went to live upon the mountains, and when the land was dry they came down to the coast. The animals also came down and eventually the earth was refilled with animals and people.  It was during the flood that the waves and currents of water cut the land into hollows and ridges. Then the water ran back into the sea leaving the mountains and valleys as they are today. All the Eskimo along the northern part of North America have heard their old people tell of the flood.         *       *       *       *       *  There are reindeer which came from the sky and which have teeth like dogs. They were once common and anyone could see them, but now only the priests can see them. They live on the plains, and have a large hole through the body back of the shoulders. If the people, who can see them, mistake them for common reindeer and shoot at them, the arrow falls harmless, for no ordinary weapon can kill them.  The Aurora Borealis is a group of boys playing football. Sometimes they use the skull of a walrus for the ball. The swaying movement of the lights shows that the players are struggling with each other and tugging back and forth. If the Aurora fades away and you utter a low whistle, the boys will come back as if answering to applause.  The Milky Way is the snow that fell from the Raven's snowshoes when he walked across the sky, during one of his journeys while he was creating the inhabitants of earth.         *       *       *       *       *  From Puget Sound at the northern border of the United States all along the coast to Bering Strait, both Indians and Eskimo believe that the eagle, the raven, the goose, and perhaps any bird, can push up its beak making it the visor of a cap and thus become a man, and that by pulling it down he can become a bird again.     XIV  THE FIRST MAN   In the time before there were any people on earth, a large pea-vine was growing on the beach, and in the pod of this pea the first man lay coiled up for four days. On the fifth day he stretched out his feet and that bursted the pod. He fell to the ground, where he stood up, a full-grown man.  He had never seen anything that looked like him, and he did not know what to make of himself. He looked around, and then at himself; then he moved his arms and hands and was surprised that he could do it. He moved his neck and his legs, and examined himself curiously.  Looking back, he saw the pod from which he had fallen still hanging to the vine, with a hole at the lower end out of which he had dropped. He went up and looked in through the hole to see if there were any more like him in the pod. Then he looked about him again, and saw that he was getting farther away from the place where he started, and that the ground seemed very soft and moved up and down under his feet.  After a while he had an unpleasant feeling in his stomach, and stooped down to take water in his mouth from a small pool at his feet. The water ran down into his stomach and he felt better. When he looked up again, he saw a big dark object coming through the air with a waving motion. It came on until it was just in front of him when it stopped and, standing on the ground, looked at him.  This was a Raven, and as soon as it stopped it raised one of its wings, pushed up its beak like a mask, to the top of its head, and changed at once into a man. Before he raised his mask, the Raven had stared at the Man and now he stared more than ever, moving about from side to side to obtain a better view. At last he said:  \"What are you? Where did you come from? I have never seen anything like you.\"  He looked again and said, \"You are so much like me in shape that you surprise me.\"  Presently he said, \"Walk away a few steps so that I may see you more clearly. I am astonished at you! I have never before seen anything like you. Where did you come from?\"  \"I came from the pea-pod,\" said Man pointing to the plant from which he came.  \"Ah!\" exclaimed Raven, \"I made that vine, but did not know that anything like you would ever come out of it. Come with me to the high ground over there."]]]
