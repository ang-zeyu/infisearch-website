The mischief-makers themselves did all they could to foment this spirit of discontent among those who were ordinarily well disposed. They assumed the responsibility of declaring that the trip into Germany had been indefinitely postponed. Probably, with the self-conceit incident to human nature, they really believed they were no worse than the best of the crew, and they desired to involve all their shipmates in the odium of the insubordination which had taken place.  \"No Rhine, except pork rind,\" said Little, as he met Raymond in the waist, after the latter had expressed his dissatisfaction at the new order of things.  \"Do you think so?\" asked Raymond, who had read enough of the splendid scenery of the Rhine to make him very anxious to see it.  \"A fellow that isn't blind can see--can't he?--if he opens his eyes,\" demanded Little. \"What did the new captain do this afternoon, the very minute the crew were dismissed from their stations?\"  \"I don't know. What did he do?\" inquired Raymond, curiously.  \"Didn't he rush down into the main cabin? Didn't he have a long talk with Lowington? Then, wasn't the signal for sailing hoisted at once? I tell you this is all Shuffles's doings.\"  \"Why should Shuffles want to go to sea any more than the rest of us?\" asked Raymond.  \"Why should he? Isn't he the captain of the ship now? Doesn't he want to try on his new authority, and see how it fits? Don't he want to punish the crew because they didn't drill well this afternoon? I believe you are a little deaf in one eye, Raymond, or else you can't hear in the other. It's all as plain as the figure-head on a French frigate,\" continued Little, with enthusiasm enough to convince any dissatisfied seaman.  \"Perhaps it is as you say.\"  \"I know it is.\"  \"The drill was very bad. Every fellow knows that.\"  \"What if it was? Whose fault was it?\"  \"I don't know whose fault it was; but everything went wrong, and I suppose the new captain is not satisfied with the state of discipline on board. I should not be, if I were he.\"  \"Two of your little lambs are cooped up in their state-rooms now for disobedience of orders.\"  \"Who are they?\"  \"Hunter and Hyde.\"  \"Two of the best fellows in the ship--never got a black mark in their lives,\" said Raymond.  \"O, well! The new captain will put you pious fellows through a course of sprouts that will open your eyes. Shuffles is a liar and a hypocrite. He has his reward, while an honest fellow, like me, will stick to his bunk in the steerage till the end of the cruise.\"  \"I don't believe Shuffles is a liar, or a hypocrite. You don't like him because he broke up your cruise in the Josephine.\"  \"That's not the reason. I am willing to obey the orders of all the officers, but I don't like to see the crowd punished for nothing,\" replied Little, leading the auditor back to the original topic.  Raymond was not yet a good subject for the mischief-maker to work upon, though, like a majority of the crew, he was dissatisfied with the change in the programme. Going to sea meant strict discipline; and after making up their minds to have a good time on shore, it was not pleasant to think of hard work and hard study for the next week or two.  [Illustration: THE ARRIVAL OF THE ARBUCKLES.--Page 52.]  \"There comes the commodore's barge,\" continued Little, as he pointed to the boat, which was rapidly approaching the ship. \"The Arbuckles are on board, with all their trunks. What do you think of that, Raymond?\"  The mischief-maker looked triumphant. The pile of baggage in the boat seemed to furnish sufficient testimony to clinch the argument he had used.  \"That looks like a long cruise, certainly. I suppose they are going with us,\" replied Raymond, with a sorrowful and disappointed look.  \"To be sure they are. In my opinion we are going to sail for Belfast, to convey the Arbuckles home. You won't see any Rhine, except a pork rind, on this cruise. If the fellows have any spunk at all, they won't stand this thing.\"  \"Stand it! What can they do?\" asked Raymond, who really believed the crew to be unfairly treated.  \"Don't you know what they can do? Who works the ship?\"  \"We do, of course.\"  \"Who would work her if we did not?\"  \"Well, I suppose she would not be worked at all,\" replied Raymond, smiling.  \"Then, if all the fellows respectfully refuse to man the capstan, or to unloose a sail, till they have their rights, who will get the ship under way?\"  \"We are not going to do anything of that sort,\" answered Raymond, rather indignantly. \"It would be mutiny.\"  \"You needn't call it by that name, if you don't wish to. Lowington promised the fellows a trip down the Rhine. Now, because the new captain could not handle the ship, we are to be sent off to sea. If the fellows had any grit at all in their bones, they would show Lowington that they are not slaves to him, or any other man.\"  \"I think we won't talk any more about that,\" said Raymond, as he moved off, for the bold speech of the mischief-maker alarmed him, and caused him to realize that he was listening to one of the ringleaders of the runaways.  The commodore's barge came up to the gangway. The ladies were assisted up the steps, and the trunks hoisted on board and stowed away in the after cabin. The two state-rooms, which had been built for the use of the commodore and the past officers, were appropriated to their use.  If Raymond, and such as he, were not willing to listen to the mutinous counsels of the runaways, he was not the less dissatisfied and discontented. The arrival of the Arbuckles, with their baggage, indicated that the trip to the Rhine had been abandoned. Perhaps the well-disposed students could have submitted to this disappointment, if it had not been inflicted upon them as a punishment. It seemed to them that they were to suffer for a whim of Shuffles. The runaways had taken pains to disseminate this idea among the crew, as they had also succeeded in involving the whole of them in the mischief which induced the principal to go to sea that night.  All over the deck and throughout the steerage, the boys were grumbling and growling like regular old salts, whose prerogative it is to find fault. When Howe and Spencer returned in the barge, they readily perceived the state of feeling on board. Little told them what he had said and done, and convinced them that the whole crew were ripe for a strike. The entire ship's company were discussing their grievances, and even a large portion of the officers were dissatisfied. Very likely the sudden elevation of Shuffles had created a feeling of jealousy in the minds of a portion of them.  The mischief-makers were prompt in taking advantage of this state of feeling in the crew. They fanned the flame of discontent, and it was not difficult to convince their shipmates that they were very hardly used; that the new captain was imposing a heavy burden upon them. Some of the best disposed of them were in favor of waiting upon the principal, and representing their view of the case to him; but the more impetuous ones laughed at this plan. Shuffles was the principal's pet, and he would support his _protégé_ against everybody else on board. The students talked as boys talk, and acted as boys act. At that moment Shuffles was the most unpopular fellow on board, for it was understood that he had proposed and advocated the obnoxious measure. The ship's company were willing to believe that Mr. Lowington had yielded his assent to please the new captain, rather than because he deemed it necessary to go to sea himself.  By the time the first cutter returned, a large majority of the students had decided that something should be done. They could not agree upon the precise step to be taken. Some advocated a protest, others a respectful refusal to do duty; and a few went in for a square mutiny. The provisions were transferred from the cutter to the ship, and the boat was hoisted up before the perplexing question could be settled.  \"After supper, let every fellow go to his mess-room. Don't answer the boatswain's call to weigh anchor,\" said Raymond, who had made considerable progress in rebellion since his conversation with Little.  \"Ay, ay! That's the talk!\" responded half a dozen of the group, who had been anxiously discussing the question.  \"No, no!\" added half a dozen others.  \"Why not?\" demanded Raymond of the opponents of the plan.  \"Because the Arbuckles are on board, for one reason, and because it will be mutiny, for the second,\" said Tremere, who volunteered to be spokesman for the opposition. \"Mr. Arbuckle has taken us through Switzerland, and paid all the bills, and has invited us to another excursion on the same terms. Now, when he comes on board with his family, to take a little sail with us, we refuse to do duty. It looks like contempt and ingratitude to him.\"  \"It has nothing to do with him,\" replied Raymond, warmly. \"Here is the whole matter in a nutshell. Mr. Arbuckle invited us to take a trip into Germany, and Mr. Lowington promised that we should go. Then, because we don't drill quite as well as the new captain wishes, he insists upon going to sea. The cruise down the Rhine is given up, and we are to carry the Arbuckles to Belfast.\"  \"Who says we are going to Belfast?\" demanded Tremere.  \"All the fellows say so.\"  \"That doesn't prove that we are going there. I go for obeying orders, wherever we go.\"  \"No, no!\" replied a dozen of the group.  \"We don't intend to do anything wicked,\" said Raymond. \"When the boatswain calls, we don't answer--that's all. Then the officers will want to know what the matter is, and we shall have a chance to explain our position. When we get fair play, we shall be all right, and return to duty.\"  The group separated, and while the ship's company were waiting for the supper call, those in favor of the strike used all their influence to carry their measure, while those who were opposed to it remained passive.     CHAPTER IV."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24124"],["title","Down the Rhine; Or, Young America in Germany (#7)"],["body","YOUNG AMERICA MUTINY.   It was impossible for the advocates of the mutiny to determine what success had attended their efforts, when the crew were piped to supper. Howe and Little were delighted to find the work in which they were interested progressing so finely. Nearly the whole crew were arrayed against the new captain, and in half an hour the grand explosion would take place. Not more than twenty of the students were expected to respond to the boatswain's call to get under way, and it would be impossible to go to sea. The seamen went below at the supper call, but most of them were too much excited to eat their usual allowance.  The officers, who were to take their supper at a later hour, were all on deck. Paul Kendall was seated by the side of Grace Arbuckle, enjoying a pleasant chat, while her father and mother were in conversation with the principal. Captain Shuffles was planking the deck, apparently engaged in deep thought. Possibly the events of the afternoon disturbed him, for he had already received a hint that the ship's company were much dissatisfied at the idea of going to sea. He could not see why they should be. If the crew did their duty, and everything worked well, the squadron would proceed immediately to Brest, and the cruise need not last more than two days. He knew the programme himself, but he forgot that it was the policy of the principal to keep the destination of the ship a secret, as a general rule, until she was out of sight of land. The Arbuckles had brought their baggage with them, because the party was to proceed to Brest, and would not return to Havre.  Popularity is certainly a very insecure possession; for, three weeks before, Shuffles had been the favorite of the whole ship's company. Now, he was the most unpopular person on board; partly, it is true, because he was misunderstood. Both officers and seamen regarded him as the cause of the present movement. Most of them believed, or at least feared, that the trip to the Rhine had been abandoned, and that the new captain was responsible for this change in the programme. They concluded that he preferred to exercise his new authority, to roaming on shore, where he was, practically, no more than any other student. It was true that Shuffles had suggested to the principal the idea of going to sea, as a measure for perfecting the discipline of the crew. Mr. Lowington had permitted the captain to fight his own battle with the crew, and he fully believed that a little sea service was necessary, after the disorder and insubordination which had prevailed in the ship during the drill. Some of those who complained the loudest had permitted their love of fun to get the better of their discretion, and had joined in the disorder which prevailed during the drill. Many well-disposed boys had assisted the conspirators against the peace of the ship by joining in what appeared to them to be but a mere frolic, while it was, in fact, an organized attempt to make mischief. They had encouraged the spirit of insubordination, without supposing they were engaged in anything more than a mere lark, involuntary on their part, and suggested only by the circumstances of the moment.  From the captain's stand-point, the confusion had a very grave aspect; while from that of the seamen, it was a matter of trivial consequence. The commander was mortified to find the discipline so weak; and he could have no confidence in himself or his crew until his orders were promptly obeyed. He was thinking only of the welfare of the ship and her crew. He had no intention of punishing the students, when he suggested the plan of going to sea,--only of perfecting the discipline. It seemed to him just as though three weeks on shore had demoralized the ship's company. Though he was now aware that the runaways had done what they could to make trouble, the confusion seemed to be too extensive to be accounted for by their agency. Two of the best boys on board had been sent to the mainmast for disobedience; and it was clear that the runaways had not produced all the trouble.  The commodore fully sustained him, and believed that it was best for the ship to go to sea. If the students had forgotten the ropes, or were so much embarrassed in their new stations, that they could not set a sail or get up the anchor without making a mess of it, the ship ought to go to sea. On the return of the excursionists from Germany, it might be necessary to put to sea without an hour's delay, as the principal had suggested. Shipwreck and disaster might follow if the crew were not in working order. It was a plain case to the captain.  Paul Kendall had explained the situation to the Arbuckles as mildly as he could. He had told them that the seamen were a little disorderly, and that it was necessary to have them in perfect discipline before they went to Germany. Without intending to do so, he had produced the impression on their minds, that the trip would be given up unless the boys performed their duty to the entire satisfaction of the principal. In talking with the officers, they had expressed their fear that the proposed excursion would not take place. Perhaps the guests were not far from right; for certainly the students would not be allowed to step on shore if the discipline of the ship was not satisfactory. Miss Grace was sadly disturbed at the thought of depriving the students of the pleasure of seeing the Rhine, its wonders and its beauties.  \"Why, I thought your crew were in perfect discipline, Captain--no, I mean Commodore--Kendall,\" said she, as they sat upon the quarter-deck, discussing the great question of the hour.  \"They are, generally,\" replied Paul. \"But you know we are a little world by ourselves, and we have our troubles just like other people. It will be all right, I hope, in a day or two. The students get a little wild sometimes.\"  \"Captain Shuffles is such a noble fellow, I should think they would all wish to do their best. I'm sure I should, if I were a sailor in your ship.\"  \"Shuffles is a capital fellow,\" added Paul, who was certainly more pleased to praise the commander himself, than to have his fair companion do so.  \"I shall never forget his noble conduct on that terrible night when the steamer was burned,\" said Grace, warmly.  \"Probably none of us will ever forget it. But I am sorry to say that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the new captain, just now, even among the officers,\" added Paul.  \"I'm very sorry.\"  \"But it is not his fault; really it is not,\" continued Paul, fearing that he had said too much.  \"I'm sure it is not,\" protested Grace. \"I wonder if I have any influence with the officers.\"  \"I think you have: indeed, I know you have with one of them,\" replied Paul; but he began to choke before he had uttered the last clause of the sentence.  \"With one of them?\"  \"Yes, with all of them; but perhaps more with one than with others,\" stammered Paul, studying the seams in the quarter-decks.  \"Who is he, pray?\" asked Grace, rather timidly.  \"With the commodore,\" answered he, desperately.  \"Thank you, Commodore Kendall. Then we will both use our influence to have the captain set right with the officers and the crew.\"  \"Well, it is not exactly the right thing for so dignified a personage as the commodore to persuade his inferiors that his views are correct. He issues orders, and others obey them,\" laughed Paul. \"But really I cannot, in courtesy, meddle with the discipline of the ship.\"  \"I'm going to meddle with it, if I can do anything to set Captain Shuffles right,\" said Grace, who was very confident that it was quite impossible for her noble preserver to do, or even think, anything wrong.  \"The officers will do their duty, whatever they think,\" added Paul. \"In due time they will be satisfied that the captain is right. I fully agree with him, and think that the ship ought to go to sea.\"  \"Of course, I expect to find you on the right side, Commodore Kendall,\" said Grace.  \"Certainly I'm always on your side,\" he replied, becoming astonishingly bold for him.  \"Then we are both on Captain Shuffles's side. Who is the officer standing near us?\"  It happened to be Master Perth; and Miss Arbuckle called him, intent upon finding some one who was not on the captain's side. Paul, however, did not think it was in accordance with the dignity of the commodore of the squadron to listen to any criticism of the captain's action, and he reluctantly left the pleasant seat he occupied by the side of the young lady. If there was any one on board who hated Shuffles, Perth was he.  \"I wanted to get acquainted with you, Mr. Perth; for it seems to me I have not met you before,\" she began.  \"Probably not, Miss Arbuckle, for I was not one of the party who went to Paris and Switzerland with you,\" replied the second master.  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed she, understanding, without further explanation, why he was not one of the party, and that he was one of the runaways, though she could not exactly comprehend how he happened to be an officer if he had been a rebel.  \"I had the honor to command the Josephine during a portion of the time the ship's company were absent,\" laughed he, with anything but penitence for his past offences.  \"I am very sorry you were not with the others.\"  \"So am I, for one reason--it deprived me of the pleasure of seeing your pretty face for three or four weeks,\" said Perth, lightly.  \"Perhaps I shall change my mind if I find your absence saved me from such annoyance as I feel at the present moment,\" replied Grace, blushing, and looking much displeased.  \"I beg your pardon! I meant no offence,\" stammered Perth.  Grace smiled again; for she did not believe he would again venture to indulge in an impudent compliment.  \"I am very sorry to learn from what you say that you were one of the runaways,\" she continued.  \"I was one of them--I may say that I was the chief of them,\" replied Perth, without a blush.  \"Of course you are very sorry for it, and very glad that Captain Shuffles"]]]
