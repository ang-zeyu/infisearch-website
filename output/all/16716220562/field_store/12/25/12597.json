The elephant and rhinoceros are found, few in number, in the north. The birds are the eagle, vulture, argus-pheasant,--a singular and beautiful bird,--peacocks, flamingoes, and swifts.\"  \"What in the world are swifts?\" inquired Mrs. Woolridge.  \"They are a kind of swallow, of which you may have seen some as we came down from Rangoon. They make the edible birds'-nests which are so great a delicacy among the Chinese when made into soup. The rivers, lakes, and swamps swarm with crocodiles, the real man-eaters. Leeches are a nuisance when you bathe in the rivers and ponds, and various kinds of snakes abound. There are plenty of fish in the sea, lakes, and rivers. Diamonds, gold, coal, copper, are mined in the island.  \"All of New England and the Middle States, with Maryland, could be set down in Borneo, still leaving a considerable border of swamp and jungle all around them. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland could be slapped down upon it like a flapjack, and there would still be more than space for another United Kingdom, without covering up all the mud of Borneo. We do not see how big it is when we look on the map.  \"The larger portion of the island is included in the Dutch possessions. Banjermassin, of which something was said as we passed the mouth of the Barito River, on which it is located, contains 30,000 inhabitants, and is the most important in the island. Borneo proper is in the north-west, and is under the government of the Sultan of Bruneï. He lost nearly one-half of his territory, taken by the North Borneo Company, and that in the west, which is now Sarawak, of which I shall have something more to say later. The island of Labuan lies six miles west of the northern portion of Bruneï. It was ceded to the English by the sultan, and is principally valuable as a coaling-station, though it has a considerable trade.  \"Sabah is the country of the North Borneo Company. An American obtained the right to this territory in 1865, and transferred it to the present company. It has an area somewhat larger than the State of Maine. No doubt they will develop and improve the country.  \"Sarawak has a territory nearly as large as that of the State of Pennsylvania, and larger than the State of Ohio. Its history is involved in the life of Sir James Brooke, who was originally created the rajah, or governor of the country, by the Sultan of Bruneï, and retained the title till his death in 1868. He was born in Benares in 1803, and educated at Norwich, England. In 1819 he entered the East Indian army, and was severely wounded in the Burmese war. He returned to England; and his furlough lapsed before he could rejoin his regiment, and with it his appointment. He left the service. He next conceived a plan for putting down piracy in the Indian Archipelago, and of civilizing the savage inhabitants of these islands, a grand and noble scheme to be carried out by a single individual on his own responsibility.  \"He bought a small vessel, and made a voyage to China, probably with the intention of improving his finances for the work he had in view. In 1835 he inherited $150,000 at the death of his father. After a cruise in the Mediterranean, he sailed in a schooner-yacht from London for Sarawak, where he arrived in 1839. The uncle of the sultan was engaged in a war with some tribes of rebels, and Brooke rendered him important assistance. He returned to Kuching with the title of rajah, his predecessor, a native, having been compelled to resign.  \"The new governor immediately went to work very vigorously to establish a better government, introducing free trade, and framing a new code of laws. At this time the atrocious custom of head-hunting prevailed in the island. Enemies killed in battle were decapitated simply for the sake of the head, and the Dyak who obtained the greatest number of them was esteemed the most valiant warrior.  \"A Dyak girl would not accept the addresses of a young man who had not obtained a head, in the earlier time; and murders were often committed for the sole purpose of obtaining the head of the victim, either to conciliate some dusky maiden, or as a trophy for the head-house, of which there is one in every village. The heads were 'cooked,' as they called it, though the operation was merely drying and cleaning the skull. Rajah Brooke made the penalty of this kind of murder death, without regard to the customs and antecedents of the natives; and he soon abolished head-hunting in his dominion.  \"The sultan, either directly or by 'winking at it,' encouraged piracy; and the crime was as common as in the vicinity of the Malay states fifty years ago. Sir James Brooke resolutely attacked the pirates, and with the means at his command soon vanquished and drove them from the sea and the land. The Dyaks, in spite of their head-hunting propensities, were rather a simple people; while the Malays of the island were cunning, dishonest, treacherous, and cruel. The simple Dyaks were no match for them, and were cheated and abused in every possible way. There was no such thing as justice in the land. The new rajah corrected all these abuses.  \"Having established his government on the basis of right and justice to all, Brooke went to England in 1847. He was invited to Windsor by the Queen, and created a K. C. B. (Knight Commander of the Bath), a distinguished honor in Great Britain. The next year he was made governor of Labuan. He was charged in the House of Commons with receiving head-money for pirates killed; but the charge was disproved.  \"Brooke continued to hold his position as Rajah of Sarawak while at Labuan; but in 1857 he was superseded at the latter, and returned to his government. The Chinese, of whom there are a great many in Borneo, became incensed against him because he prevented the smuggling of opium into his territory. A large body of them attacked his house in the night, and destroyed a great amount of his property.  \"But the rajah was not a man to submit quietly to such an outrage. He immediately collected a force of Dyaks and Malays, and attacked the Celestials. He razed a fort they had constructed, and thoroughly defeated them in several successive battles. He was very prompt and decided in action, and to see an abuse was to remedy it without unnecessary delay. He established and maintained a model government, and the country prospered greatly under his mild but decisive rule.  \"He found a town with 1,000 inhabitants, and left it with 25,000. He died in 1868, and was succeeded by his nephew, Sir C. T. Brooke, who extended his territory, and ten years ago placed it under the protection of the United Kingdom. This is the history of a noble man and a model colony.\"  \"But what are Dyaks, Professor?\" inquired Mrs. Belgrave.  \"They are natives of Borneo, though all the people are not known by this name. They are divided into Hill Dyaks and Sea Dyaks. At the present time they are a high-toned class of savages; for they do not steal or rob, and they have many social virtues which might be copied by the people of enlightened nations. Head-hunting and piracy are known among them no more. They are the farmers and producers of the island. There is much that is very interesting about them. They build peculiar houses, some of them occupied by a dozen or more families, though they always live in peace, and do not quarrel with their neighbors. The young women select their own husbands, and a head is no longer necessary to open the way to an engagement.  \"If any of the party wish to learn more of the Dyaks, their manners and customs, present and past, you will find a work in two volumes, by the Rev. J. G. Wood, entitled, 'The Uncivilized Races of Men;' and you will find that the author often quotes from Rajah Brooke.\"     CHAPTER IV  A SPECULATION IN CROCODILES   The Blanchita continued on her course up the river with Clingman at the wheel. There was no table in the fore cabin; and the dinner of the six men, including the engineer, was served astern after the \"Big Four\" had taken the meal. Louis attended to the engine while Felipe was at his meals and occasionally at other times. A table is not a necessity for the crew of a ship, and one is not used on board a merchant vessel; but Louis insisted that all hands should fare equally well on board of the little steamer.  The dinner was disposed of, and Wales was at the wheel. The men had nothing to do, and a couple of them had assisted Pitts in washing the dishes and putting the after cabin in order. It was an idle time, and the \"Big Four\" were anxious to have something more exciting than merely sailing along the river, the novelty of which had worn off; and they had not long to wait for it.  \"A crocodile ahead, Captain, on the port bow, sir!\" exclaimed Wales, the wheelman, whose duty required him to keep a sharp lookout for any obstructions in the stream.  All of the party had their weapons within reach, including the three seamen who were disengaged; but the latter were not expected to use the rifles till they were ordered to do so by the captain or any one of the hunters. The occupants of the fore cabin, the principal personages on board, had the exclusive use of the forward part of the boat, though the hands were at liberty to use the seats when they were not required by any of the \"Big Four.\" No order to this effect had been given; but the men, under the influence of the discipline on board of the ship, had involuntarily adopted the system.  \"Slow her down, Wales,\" said Scott, after he had observed the situation of the saurian.  The wheelman rang the jingle-bell, and the boat soon came down to half-speed. The five hunters, including Achang, had their rifles ready for use, though they still retained their seats. The reptile was not asleep; and he appeared to have some notions of his own, for he was not disposed to wait for the coming of the boat. He settled down in the dark water so that he could not be seen, but the surface was disturbed by his movements.  \"Port"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24252"],["title","Four Young Explorers; Or, Sight-Seeing in the Tropics (#5)"],["body"," the helm, Wales,\" said the captain quietly. \"He is going across the river.\"  Presently he came to the surface again, and was swimming towards the opposite shore. He kept his head and a small portion of his back next to it above the surface of the water, as the young hunters had seen in Sumatra before.  \"Full speed; give her a spurt, Wales,\" said the captain.  The wheelman rang the speed-bell, and then spoke through the tube to the engineer. The boat suddenly darted ahead under this instruction, and was soon abreast of the reptile, who was not at first disposed to change his tactics. He evidently realized that he was pursued, and it seemed to make him angry.  \"The rascal has put his helm to port,\" said Wales.  \"Look out there, in the waist!\" shouted Scott to the seamen, a couple of whom were seated on the rail, with their legs dangling over the side of the boat. \"Never sit in that way, men, unless you want to be carried to the hospital with a leg bitten off.\"  \"Will they bite, Captain?\" asked Clinch.  \"Bite? They are regular man-eaters on these rivers.\"  \"I used to go in swimming with the alligators on the Alabama River; but they all kept their distance,\" added the seaman.  The two men drew in their legs and moved inboard. Alligators, which are generally considered harmless in the rivers of the Southern States, will bite at anything hanging in the water. As Wales had suggested, the crocodile had changed his course, and was now headed directly for the Blanchita. He seemed to have concluded that there was no safety for him in flight, and he had decided to fight.  \"Your first shot, Louis,\" said Scott, who had not even taken up his rifle, as if he thought there would be no chance for him after the millionaire had fired.  Louis waited a minute or more till he could distinctly see the eye of the crocodile, and then he fired. As has so often been said before, he had been thoroughly trained in a shooting-gallery, and was a dead shot, as he had often proved during the voyage. The bullet had evidently gone to his brain, for the reptile floundered about for an instant, and then moved no more. As Felix put it, he was \"very dead,\" though the word hardly admits of an intensifier.  \"What are you going to do with him now?\" asked the Milesian.  \"I don't think we want anything more of him; but, like a poison snake, he is a nuisance that ought to be abated,\" replied the captain. \"I dare say the rajah will be much obliged to us for making the number of them even one less.\"  \"How long is he?\" Achang inquired, as he returned his rifle to its resting-place.  \"About ten feet,\" replied Louis.  \"More than that,\" the captain thought. \"I should say twelve feet.\"  \"Then he is worth eighteen shillings to you,\" added the native.  \"What is he good for, Achang?\" asked Morris.  \"He is good for nothing,\" replied the Bornean. \"The crocodile here eats men and women. Some are killed every year, and the government pays one and sixpence apiece for the heads.\"  \"That looks like a war of extermination upon them,\" said Morris.  \"I don't know what that is; but they want to kill them all off,\" replied Achang, who had improved his language so that his tutor seldom had to correct it.  \"That is the same thing. They pay by the foot for crocodiles here.\"  \"The bigger they are, the more dangerous,\" suggested Louis. \"Let us haul him alongside, and see how long he is.\"  The boat had stopped her screw before Louis fired; and the captain directed Wales to lay her alongside the saurian, which was done in a few minutes. Ropes were passed under his head and tail; and with a couple of purchases made fast to the horizontal rods over the rail, close to the stanchions, the carcass was hoisted partly out of the water. The measure was taken with a line first, to which Lane, who was a carpenter's assistant, applied his rule, which gave twelve feet and two inches as the length of the crocodile.  \"That makes him worth eighteen shillings,\" said Achang.  \"About four dollars and a half,\" added Morris. \"We could make something hunting crocodiles. If we could kill ten of them like that fellow it would give us forty-five dollars.\"  Louis and Scott laughed heartily at this calculation, and thought the idea was derogatory to the character of true sport, though they did not object to turning their victims of this kind into money.  \"Must we carry the carcass of this beast down to Kuching in order to get the reward, Achang?\" asked Morris.  \"The head will be enough; and they can tell how long he is by the size of it.\"  \"How shall we saw the head off? Can you do it, Lane?\"  \"I can do that,\" interposed the Bornean, as he went to a bundle of implements he had procured in the town and from the natives.  He drew from it a very heavy sword, from which he took off the covering of dry leaves, and applied his thumb to the edge of the weapon. Then he picked out a straw from some packing, and dropped it off in pieces, as one tries his razor on a hair. It appeared to be as sharp as the shaving-tool, and he was satisfied. All hands watched his movements with deep interest. He secured a position with one foot on the side of the boat, and the other on the back of the crocodile. With two or three blows of his sword, he severed the head from the body, and a seaman secured it with a boathook.  All hands applauded when the deed was done, as the Bornean washed his keen blade. The operation excited the admiration of all the lookers-on, it was so quickly and skilfully done. Louis wished to examine the weapon, and it was handed to him. It was heavy enough to require a strong arm to handle it; and it was sharp enough for a giant's razor, if giants ever shave, for most of them are pictured with full beards.  \"I suppose this is a native's sword,\" said Louis, as he passed it to the captain.  \"Dyak _parong latok;_ _parong_ same thing, not so long,\" Achang explained.  \"I suppose that is what the Dyaks used when they went head-hunting,\" said Felix.  \"No head-hunting now; used to use it, the Hill Dyaks. Used in battle too; split head open with it, or cut head off.\"  \"What other weapons did the fighting men use?\" asked Louis.  \"They carried a shield, and used a spear with the parong latok; no other weapons. Two kinds of Dyaks, the Sea and the Hill.\"  While the native was talking, the seamen, by order of the captain, had hoisted the head of the saurian into the sampan towing astern, placing it on a piece of tarpaulin. The carcass was cast loose, and probably was soon devoured by others of its own kind.  \"We might find some eggs in the crocodile,\" said Achang, as the body floated past the boat.  \"We don't want the eggs,\" replied the captain, turning up his nose.  \"Good to eat, Captain. My naturalist used to eat them. Very nice, like turtles' eggs, which Englishmen always put in the soup.\"  \"None in my soup!\" exclaimed Scott, with a wry face, to express his disgust.  \"I suppose they would be all right if we only got used to them,\" suggested Louis.  \"As the man's horse did when he fed him on shavings,\" sneered Scott.  \"I did not take very kindly to turtles' eggs when we were in the West Indies; but I got used to them, and then liked them,\" added Louis. \"In Africa the natives eat boa-constrictors, and think they are a choice morsel. Some of our Indians eat clay, and I suppose they like it.\"  \"Something up in the trees yonder, Captain,\" said Wales, as the boat approached some higher ground, which was not overflown with water, as most of the shore below had been.  \"Monkeys,\" added Achang, not at all excited.  \"I don't think I care to shoot monkeys unless it is for the purpose of examining them,\" said Louis. \"They are too small game, and they are harmless creatures.\"  \"Strange monkeys in here,\" continued Achang. \"Not these,\" he added when he had obtained a sight of one of them. \"These no good.\"  All eyes were directed to the tree; and at least a dozen common monkeys were there, such as they had seen in the museums at home. The steamer continued on her course, and a couple of miles farther on the forest was inundated. Some of the trees appeared to be inhabited.  \"Plenty of elephant monkeys in here,\" said Achang.  \"Elephant monkeys!\" exclaimed Louis. \"I never heard of any such animals. Are they called so because they are so large?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Achang; \"because they have such long noses.\"  \"There are a dozen monkeys in that tree, and they look very queer,\" said Louis, as he elevated his double-barrelled fowling-piece, loaded with large shot, and fired.  One of them dropped, and another when he discharged the second barrel. The boat was run in the direction of the tree till it grounded in the mud. The captain proposed to go for them in the sampan, when Clingman volunteered to wade to the tree for the game, and soon returned with the two victims of the millionaire's unerring aim. They were placed in the waist, and all were curious to see them. The rest of the tribe scampered away over the tops of the trees, crying, \"honk, honk, kehonk!\"  \"They are proboscis monkeys, and old males at that; for they have very long noses, which is the reason for the name, and why Achang calls them elephant monkeys,\" said Louis, as he turned the creatures over. \"The noses of these two reach down below the chin. They stand about three feet high, but are rather lank, like the tall pigs.\"  While the party were examining them, the captain gave the order to back the boat, and then to go ahead. She was moored for the night soon after. The next morning, by the advice of Achang, the Blanchita was headed down the river, for the native declared that they would find no different game on the banks of the Sarawak.     CHAPTER V  A HUNDRED AND EIGHT FEET OF CROCODILE   The party were stirring as soon as it was daylight; for in the tropics the early hours are the pleasantest, and they had fallen into the habit of early rising in India. The trees were alive with monkeys of several kinds, though the proboscis tribe seemed to be in the majority. Felix came out of "]]]
