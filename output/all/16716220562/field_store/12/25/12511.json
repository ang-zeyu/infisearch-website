I don't believe any fellow makes anything by being a hypocrite, and selling out his friends.\"  \"I don't think so, either. But you certainly cannot mean to say that Captain Shuffles is a hypocrite, or that he ever betrayed his friends?\"  \"I suppose I ought not to say anything to you about it, knowing that he is a strong friend of yours.\"  \"Whatever you say, Mr. Perth, shall not be repeated. I have been told that some of the officers are opposed to the new captain; and I do not see how it can be true, when he is so noble and good.\"  \"Noble and good!\" ejaculated Perth.  \"Certainly. You know what he did for me on the night the steamer was burned.\"  \"There isn't a fellow on board that would not have given all he had for a chance to do the same thing for you,\" protested Perth.  \"But all the students like him.\"  \"I don't believe he has twenty friends in the ship.\"  \"Then they do not know him as I do,\" replied Grace, indignantly.  \"They know him better than you do. He's smart, and a good officer; but when you have said that, you have said all that can be said,\" continued Perth, bluntly.  \"I am sorry to hear you say so,\" added Grace, really grieved, even while she was incredulous. \"I am afraid you are prejudiced against him because he broke up your plan to run away with the Josephine.\"  \"He didn't break it up. Our fellows disagreed among themselves; that's the reason why we had to come back,\" explained Perth, whose pride did not permit him to acknowledge that he had been beaten by the superior skill and energy of Shuffles. \"Now, all the fellows are on the very verge of mutiny, because he insists upon taking the ship to sea, instead of going down the Rhine.\"  \"I'm sure he is doing no more than his duty,\" persisted Grace, stoutly. \"It appears that Mr. Lowington thinks he is right, or he would not send the ship to sea. I am really sorry to hear you speak so unkindly of your captain, for I must say that I cannot believe a word you say about him.\"  \"Thank you,\" replied Perth, dryly.  \"I think you are sincere in your belief,\" added she. \"Paul Kendall says that the captain is right.\"  \"Well, he is commodore, you know, and must believe everything the principal says,\" laughed Perth. \"It is not quite proper for any of us to have opinions of our own, but you see some of us have them.\"  Perth was certainly good-natured, whatever else he was, and as Grace said no more, he touched his cap, and passed on. The devoted admirer of Shuffles's nobleness and goodness was greatly disconcerted by the blunt statements of the second master, who had declared that the ship's company were almost in a state of mutiny against the captain. She continued her inquiries among other officers; but, though some of them thought it was quite unnecessary to go to sea, they all spoke very handsomely of Shuffles. It was plain enough that Perth had injured himself more than the object of his calumny, by what he had said.  \"Are you ready to go to sea, Miss Arbuckle?\" asked the captain, as he came on deck, and touched his cap to her.  \"I am quite ready; indeed, I am afraid I am more ready than many others on board of this ship,\" she replied. \"I am sorry to hear that some of the officers and seamen are very much displeased at the idea of going to sea.\"  \"So far as the seamen are concerned, it is their own fault, for they have not done their duty,\" added the captain.  \"Not the fault of all of them, I hope.\"  \"Not all, certainly; but if they don't know their stations, they must learn them. If you are all ready to go, I think we will be off,\" said Shuffles, as he glanced at his watch. \"You will get the ship under way, if you please, Mr. Goodwin,\" he added, addressing the first lieutenant, who was standing near him.  \"I really hope there will be no trouble, Captain Shuffles,\" continued Grace.  \"There can be no trouble. All sailors grumble, you know, Miss Arbuckle, and our boys imitate their elders in this respect. They will growl for a while, but just as soon as they work the ship with skill and promptness, we shall put into Brest, and make our trip down the Rhine. I think we shall not be at sea beyond a couple of days.\"  \"I hope not, for the sake of the crew.\"  \"All hands, weigh anchor, ahoy!\" shouted the boatswain, as his sharp pipe rang through the ship.  Less than thirty of the seamen answered to the call, and it was apparent that a very large majority of them had chosen to follow the evil counsels of the runaways, or the foolish counsels of other discontented spirits. It was the first time since the ship went into commission that any considerable number of the crew had failed to respond to the call. Shuffles was confounded, and the first lieutenant actually turned pale. It looked like such a mutiny as the Chain League had planned.  \"Pipe again,\" said Shuffles, as quietly as he could.  Again the boatswain sounded the call, and repeated the order, but with no better success than before. Not another seaman appeared upon deck.  \"What does this mean?\" said the commodore to the captain.  \"As near as I can interpret it, the greater part of the crew do not intend to obey orders,\" replied Shuffles.  \"It certainly looks so.\"  \"Mr. Goodwin, will you inquire of those who obeyed the order, whether their shipmates heard the call?\" continued the captain, laboring very hard to appear cool and collected, as a commander ought to be in every emergency.  Paul Kendall's curiosity prompted him to follow the executive officer to the waist, where the seamen who had obeyed the call were waiting for orders. He was unwilling to believe the evidence of his senses, though he knew that there was considerable disaffection on board.  \"Did the rest of the crew hear the boatswain's pipe?\" asked Goodwin of the faithful few.  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Tremere.  \"Where are they now?\"  \"In the mess-rooms.\"  \"Why don't they obey?\"  \"They say they don't want to go to sea: they say they haven't done anything to deserve punishment, and they object to being punished,\" replied the spokesman.  \"What do they mean by being punished?\" asked the commodore.  \"Sent to sea. Mr. Lowington promised us a trip down the Rhine; and now that excursion is given up. The fellows say the ship is bound to Belfast, to convey the Arbuckles home. They say they are willing to do their duty, if they can have fair play.\"  \"What do the seamen intend to do?\" asked Paul.  \"Nothing, sir. They say they will give their reasons when called upon.\"  \"Probably they will, when called upon,\" said Paul, who had very high ideas of discipline.  The executive officer returned, and explained the situation to the captain. It was impossible to get the ship under way with less than thirty seamen, and he felt that his powers were exhausted. Fortunately, Mr. Lowington, who had heard the boatswain's pipe, came on deck at this critical moment.  \"Didn't I hear the boatswain's pipe?\" asked the principal, surprised to find only a few hands in the waist.  \"Yes, sir; we have called all hands twice, and only about thirty answer the call.\"  \"It was a mistake to call more than once,\" replied Mr. Lowington, who did not seem to be taken aback by the astounding intelligence. \"What's the matter?\"  The captain explained, reporting the statements made by the faithful ones in the waist.  \"A mutiny, then--is it?\" added the principal, with a smile. \"Well, I am glad it is no worse.\"  \"The mutineers are willing to explain, when called upon for an explanation,\" added Paul, who was indignant at the conduct of the malcontents.  \"We don't usually call for explanations in such cases on board ship,\" said the principal. \"It is plain enough that this is only a second edition of the confusion of this afternoon. The young gentlemen have been listening to evil advice.\"  \"What shall be done, sir?\" inquired the captain, rather nervously, in spite of his laborious efforts to keep cool.  \"Mutiny is mutiny,\" replied the principal; \"but in this case, I think we need not treat it with the severity which prevails in the navy. The students below say, and probably believe, that the excursion to the Rhine has been abandoned, and that the ship is bound to Belfast. Though they are mistaken, we can only tell them so when they return to their duty. We will go to sea, as we intended.\"  \"How can we go to sea with a crew of less than thirty?\" asked Shuffles.  \"Keep perfectly calm, Captain Shuffles. I am willing to grant that, in a man-of-war, with men in a state of mutiny, the case would be a very serious one. I do not so regard it in the present instance, but we will profit by the lesson it may teach. For an officer to permit a sailor to see that he is disconcerted is yielding too much. Therefore, young gentlemen, I wish you all to be perfectly composed, whatever happens. This affair is rather ludicrous than otherwise, since the mutineers declare that they are ready to explain when called upon to do so, which is very kind and condescending on their part,\" the principal proceeded, addressing the officers who had gathered around him for the solution of what seemed to them a very difficult and trying problem.  But they were not permitted to hear the solution, for the principal invited the commodore and the captain into the main cabin, to discuss the matter, desiring, even in the present embarrassing situation, to have everything done in accordance with his ideas of discipline. He meant that the captain should be the apparent, if he could not be the real, manager of the difficult affair.  \"How many hands responded to the boatswain's call?\" asked the principal, when the party were seated.  \"Less than thirty,\" answered Shuffles.  \"Twenty-eight. I had the curiosity to count them,\" interposed Paul.  \"Twenty-eight,\" repeated the principal. \"Very well; we can--\"  \"I hope you will excuse me, sir,\" said Shuffles, interrupting him. \"If this state of thing is caused by any dislike to me, sir, I am willing to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24135"],["title","The Measure of a Man (#0)"],["body","(https://www.pgdp.net)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustration.

THE MEASURE OF A MAN  by  RANDALL GARRETT  Illustrated by Martinez             _What is desirable is not always necessary, while that which is      necessary may be most undesirable. Perhaps the measure of a man is      the ability to tell one from the other ... and act on it._     Alfred Pendray pushed himself along the corridor of the battleship _Shane_, holding the flashlight in one hand and using the other hand and his good leg to guide and propel himself by. The beam of the torch reflected queerly from the pastel green walls of the corridor, giving him the uneasy sensation that he was swimming underwater instead of moving through the blasted hulk of a battleship, a thousand light-years from home.  He came to the turn in the corridor, and tried to move to the right, but his momentum was greater than he had thought, and he had to grab the corner of the wall to keep from going on by. That swung him around, and his sprained ankle slammed agonizingly against the other side of the passageway.  Pendray clenched his teeth and kept going. But as he moved down the side passage, he went more slowly, so that the friction of his palm against the wall could be used as a brake.  He wasn't used to maneuvering without gravity; he'd been taught it in Cadets, of course, but that was years ago and parsecs away. When the pseudograv generators had gone out, he'd retched all over the place, but now his stomach was empty, and the nausea had gone.  He had automatically oriented himself in the corridors so that the doors of the various compartments were to his left and right, with the ceiling \"above\" and the deck \"below.\" Otherwise, he might have lost his sense of direction completely in the complex maze of the interstellar battleship.  _Or_, he corrected himself, _what's left of a battleship_.  And what _was_ left? Just Al Pendray and less than half of the once-mighty _Shane_.  The door to the lifeboat hold loomed ahead in the beam of the flashlight, and Pendray braked himself to a stop. He just looked at the dogged port for a few seconds.  _Let there be a boat in there_, he thought. _Just a boat, that's all I ask. And air_, he added as an afterthought. Then his hand went out to the dog handle and turned.  The door cracked easily. There was air on the other side. Pendray breathed a sigh of relief, braced his good foot against the wall, and pulled the door open.  The little lifeboat was there, nestled tightly in her cradle. For the first time since the _Shane_ had been hit, Pendray's face broke into a broad smile. The fear that had been within him faded a little, and the darkness of the crippled ship seemed to be lessened.  Then the beam of his torch caught the little red tag on the air lock of the lifeboat. _Repair Work Under Way--Do Not Remove This Tag Without Proper Authority._  That explained why the lifeboat hadn't been used by the other crewmen.  Pendray's mind was numb as he opened the air lock of the small craft. He didn't even attempt to think. All he wanted was to see exactly how the vessel had been disabled by the repair crew. He went inside.  The lights were working in the lifeboat. That showed that its power was still functioning. He glanced over the instrument-and-control panels. No red tags on them, at least. Just to make sure, he opened them up, one by one, and looked inside. Nothing wrong, apparently.  Maybe it had just been some minor repair--a broken lighting switch or something. But he didn't dare hope yet.  He went through the door in the tiny cabin that led to the engine compartment, and he saw what the trouble was.  The shielding had been removed from the atomic motors.  He just hung there in the air, not moving. His lean, dark face remained expressionless, but tears welled up in his eyes and spilled over, spreading their dampness over his lids.  The motors would run, all right. The ship could take him to Earth. But the radiation leakage from those motors would kill him long before he made it home. It would take ten days to make it back to base, and twenty-four hours of exposure to the deadly radiation from those engines would be enough to insure his death from radiation sickness.  His eyes were blurring from the film of tears that covered them; without gravity to move the liquid, it just pooled there, distorting his vision. He blinked the tears away, then wiped his face with his free hand.  Now what?  He was the only man left alive on the _Shane_, and none of the lifeboats had escaped. The Rat cruisers had seen to that.         *       *       *       *       *  They weren't really rats, those people. Not literally. They looked humanoid enough to enable plastic surgeons to disguise a human being as one of them, although it meant sacrificing the little fingers and little toes to imitate the four-digited Rats. The Rats were at a disadvantage there; they couldn't add any fingers. But the Rats had other advantages--they bred and fought like, well, like rats.  Not that human beings couldn't equal them or even surpass them in ferocity, if necessary. But the Rats had nearly a thousand years of progress over Earth. Their Industrial Revolution had occurred while the Angles and the Saxons and the Jutes were pushing the Britons into Wales. They had put their first artificial satellites into orbit while King Alfred the Great was fighting off the Danes.  They hadn't developed as rapidly as Man had. It took them roughly twice as long to go from one step to the next, so that their actual superiority was only a matter of five hundred years, and Man was catching up rapidly. Unfortunately, Man hadn't caught up yet.  The first meeting of the two races had taken place in interstellar space, and had seemed friendly enough. Two ships had come within detector distance of each other, and had circled warily. It was almost a perfect example of the Leinster Hypothesis; neither knew where the other's home world was located, and neither could go back home for fear that the other would be able to follow. But the Leinster Hypothesis couldn't be followed to the end. Leinster's solution had been to have the parties trade ships and go home, but that only works when the two civilizations are fairly close in technological development. The Rats certainly weren't going to trade their ship for the inferior craft of the Earthmen.  The Rats, conscious of their superiority, had a simpler solution. They were certain, after a while, that Earth posed no threat to them, so they invited the Earth ship to follow them home.  The Earthmen had been taken on a carefully conducted tour of the Rats' home planet, and the captain of the Earth ship--who had gone down in history as \"Sucker\" Johnston--was convinced that the Rats meant no harm, and agreed to lead a Rat ship back to Earth. If the Rats had struck then, there would never have been a Rat-Human War. It would have been over before it started.  But the Rats were too proud of their superiority. Earth was too far away to bother them for the moment; it wasn't in their line of conquest just yet. In another fifty years, the planet would be ready for picking off.  Earth had no idea that the Rats were so widespread. They had taken and colonized over thirty planets, completely destroying the indigenous intelligent races that had existed on five of them.  It wasn't just pride that had made the Rats decide to wait before hitting Earth; there was a certain amount of prudence, too. None of the other races they had met had developed space travel; the Earthmen might be a little tougher to beat. Not that there was any doubt of the outcome, as far as they were concerned--but why take chances?  But, while the Rats had fooled \"Sucker\" Johnston and some of his officers, the majority of the crew knew better. Rat crewmen were little short of slaves, and the Rats made the mistake of assuming that the Earth crewmen were the same. They hadn't tried to impress the crewmen as they had the officers. When the interrogation officers on Earth questioned the crew of the Earth ship, they, too, became suspicious. Johnston's optimistic attitude just didn't jibe with the facts.  So, while the Rat officers were having the red carpet rolled out for them, Earth Intelligence went to work. Several presumably awe-stricken men were allowed to take a conducted tour of the Rat ship. After all, why not? The Twentieth Century Russians probably wouldn't have minded showing their rocket plants to an American of Captain John Smith's time, either.  But there's a difference. Earth's government knew Earth was being threatened, and they knew they had to get as many facts as they could. They were also aware of the fact that if you know a thing _can_ be done, then you will eventually find a way to do it.  During the next fifty years, Earth learned more than it had during the previous hundred. The race expanded, secretly, moving out to other planets in that sector of the galaxy. And they worked to catch up with the Rats.  They didn't make it, of course. When, after fifty years of presumably peaceful--but highly limited--contact, the Rats hit Earth, they found out one thing. That the mass and energy of a planet armed with the proper weapons can not be out-classed by any conceivable concentration of spaceships.  Throwing rocks at an army armed with machine guns may seem futile, but if you hit them with an avalanche, they'll go under. The Rats lost three-quarters of their fleet to planet-based guns and had to go home to bandage"]]]
