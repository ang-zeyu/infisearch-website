And that--since Earth government's made it illegal to possess Geest artifacts--_might_ create attention.\"  Jackson fingered his chin thoughtfully, said, \"Of course, there's always a way to make sure Beulah didn't kick up a fuss.\"  Phil hesitated. \"Dr. Fitzsimmons gives Beulah another three months at the most,\" he said. \"If she can stay out of the hospital for even the next eight weeks, he'll consider it some kind of miracle. That should be early enough to take care of the gun.\"  \"It should be,\" Jackson said. \"However, if there does happen to be an investigation before that time--\"  Phil looked at him, said evenly, \"We'd do whatever was necessary. It wouldn't be very agreeable, but my neck's out just as far as yours.\"  Celia laughed. \"That's the reason we can all feel pretty safe,\" she observed. \"Every last one of us is completely selfish--and there's no more dependable kind of person than that.\"  Jackson flushed a little, glanced at Phil, smiled. Phil shrugged. Major Wayne Jackson, native son, Fort Roye's second in command, was scheduled for the number one spot and a string of promotions via the transfer of the current commander, Colonel Thayer. Their Earthside associates would arrange for that as soon as the decision to turn Fort Roye into a Class A military base was reached. Phil himself could get by with the guaranteed retention of the CLU presidency, and a membership moving up year by year to the half million mark and beyond--he could get by very, very comfortably, in fact. While Celia Adams would develop a discreetly firm hold on every upcoming minor racket, facilitated by iron-clad protection and an enforced lack of all competitors.  \"We're all thinking of Roye's future, Celia,\" Phil said amiably, \"each in his own way. And the future looks pretty bright. In fact, the only possible stumbling block I can still see is right here on Roye, and it's Honest Silas Thayer. If our colonel covers up the Geest gun find tomorrow--\"  Jackson grinned, shook his head. \"Leave that to me, my boy--and to our very distinguished visitors from Earth. Commissioner Sanford has arranged to be in Thayer's company on Territorial Office business all day tomorrow. Science Officer Vaughn is dizzy with delight because Ronald Black and most of the newsgathering troop will inspect his diggings in the ruins in the morning, with the promise of giving his theories about the vanished natives of Roye a nice spread on Earth. Black will happen to ask me to accompany the party. Between Black and Sanford--and myself--Colonel Silas Thayer won't have a chance to suppress the discovery of a Geest gun on Roye until the military has had a chance to look into it fully. And the only one he can possibly blame for that will be Science Officer Norm Vaughn--for whom, I'll admit, I feel just a little bit sorry!\"         *       *       *       *       *  First Lieutenant Norman Vaughn was an intense and frustrated young man whose unusually thick contact lenses and wide mouth gave him some resemblance to a melancholy frog. He suspected, correctly, that a good Science Officer would not have been transferred from Earth to Roye which was a planet deficient in scientific problems of any magnitude, and where requisitions for research purposes were infrequently and grudgingly granted.  The great spiraled ruin on the peninsula of Fort Roye had been Vaughn's one solace. Several similar deserted structures were known to be on the planet, but this was by far in the best condition and no doubt the most recently built. To him, if to no one else, it became clear that the construction had been carried out with conscious plan and purpose, and he gradually amassed great piles of notes to back up his theory that the vanished builders were of near-human intelligence. Unfortunately, their bodies appeared to have lacked hard and durable parts, since nothing that could be construed as their remains was found; and what Lieutenant Vaughn regarded as undeniable artifacts, on the level of very early Man's work, looked to others like chance shards and lumps of the tough, shell-like material of which the ruins were composed.  Therefore, while Vaughn was--as Jackson had pointed out--really dizzy with delight when Ronald Black, that giant of Earth's news media, first indicated an interest in the ruins and his theories about them, this feeling soon became mixed with acute anxiety. For such a chance surely would not come again if the visitors remained unconvinced by what he showed them, and what--actually--did he have to show? In the morning, when the party set out, Vaughn was in a noticeably nervous frame of mind.  Two hours later, he burst into the anteroom of the base commander's office in Fort Roye, where the warrant on duty almost failed to recognize him. Lieutenant Vaughn's eyes glittered through their thick lenses; his face was red and he was grinning from ear to ear. He pounded past the startled warrant, pulled open the door to the inner office where Colonel Thayer sat with the visiting Territorial Commissioner, and plunged inside.  \"Sir,\" the warrant heard him quaver breathlessly, \"I have the proof--the undeniable proof! They _were_ intelligent beings. They did _not_ die of disease. They were exterminated in war! They were ... but see for yourself!\" There was a thud as he dropped something on the polished table top between the commissioner and Colonel Thayer. \"_That_ was dug up just now--among their own artifacts!\"  Silas Thayer was on his feet, sucking in his breath for the blast that would hurl his blundering Science Officer back out of the office. What halted him was an odd, choked exclamation from Commissioner Sanford. The colonel's gaze flicked over to the visitor, then followed Sanford's stare to the object on the table.  For an instant, Colonel Thayer froze.  Vaughn was bubbling on. \"And, sir, I ...\"  \"Shut up!\" Thayer snapped. He continued immediately, \"You say this was found in the diggings in the ruins?\"  [Illustration]  \"Yes, sir--just now! It's ...\"  Lieutenant Vaughn checked himself under the colonel's stare, some dawning comprehension of the enormous irregularities he'd committed showing in his flushed face. He licked his lips uncertainly.  \"You will excuse me for a moment, sir,\" Thayer said to Commissioner Sanford. He picked the Geest gun up gingerly by its unmistakably curved shaft, took it over to the office safe, laid it inside and relocked the safe. He then left the office.         *       *       *  In an adjoining room, Thayer rapped out Major Wayne Jackson's code number on a communicator. He heard a faint click as Jackson's wrist speaker switched on, and said quickly, \"Wayne, are you in a position to speak?\"  \"I am at the moment,\" Jackson's voice replied cautiously.  Colonel Thayer said, \"Norm Vaughn just crashed in here with something he claims was found in the diggings. Sanford saw it, and obviously recognized it. We might be able to keep him quiet. But now some questions. Was that item actually dug up just now?\"  \"Apparently it was,\" Jackson said. \"I didn't see it happen--I was talking to Black at the moment. But there are over a dozen witnesses who claim they did see it happen, including five or six of the news agency men.\"  \"And they knew what it was?\"  \"Enough of them did.\"  Thayer cursed softly. \"No chance that one of them pitched the thing into the diggings for an Earthside sensation?\"  \"I'm afraid not,\" Jackson said. \"It was lying in the sifter after most of the sand and dust had been blown away.\"  \"Why didn't you call me at once?\"  \"I've been holding down something like a mutiny here, Silas. Vaughn got away before I could stop him, but I grounded the other aircars till you could decide what to do. Our visitors don't like that. Neither do they like the fact that I've put a guard over the section where the find was made, and haven't let them talk to Norm's work crew.  \"Ronald Black and his staff have been fairly reasonable, but there's been considerable mention of military highhandedness made by the others. This is the first moment I've been free.\"  \"You did the right thing,\" Thayer said, \"but I doubt it will help much now. Can you get hold of Ronald Black?\"  \"Yes, he's over there ...\"  \"Colonel Thayer?\" another voice inquired pleasantly a few seconds later.  \"Mr. Black,\" the colonel said carefully, \"what occurred in the diggings a short while ago may turn out to be a matter of great importance.\"  \"That's quite obvious, sir.\"  \"And that being the case,\" the colonel went on, \"do you believe it would be possible to obtain a gentleman's agreement from all witnesses to make no mention of this apparent discovery until the information is released through the proper channels? I'm asking for your opinion.\"  \"Colonel Thayer,\" Ronald Black's voice said, still pleasantly, \"my opinion is that the only way you could keep the matter quiet is to arrest every civilian present, including myself, and hold us incommunicado. You have your duty, and we have ours. Ours does not include withholding information from the public which may signal the greatest shift in the conduct of the Geest War in the past two decades.\"  \"I understand,\" Thayer said. He was silent for some seconds, and perhaps he, too, was gazing during that time at a Fort Roye of the future--a Class A military base under his command, with Earth's great war vessels lined up along the length of the peninsula.  \"Mr. Black,\" he said, \"please be so good as to give your colleagues this word from me. I shall make the most thorough possible investigation of what has occurred and forward a prompt report, along with any material evidence obtained, to my superiors on Earth. None of you will receive any other statement from me or from anyone under my command. An attempt to obtain such a statement will, in fact, result in the arrest of the person or persons involved. Is that clear?\"  \"Quite clear, Colonel Thayer,\" Ronald"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24558"],["title","Watch the Sky (#3)"],["body"," said softly. \"And entirely satisfactory.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"We have known for the past eight weeks,\" the man named Cranehart said, \"that this was not what it appears to be ... that is, a section of a Geest weapon.\"  He shoved the object in question across the desk towards Commissioner Sanford and Ronald Black. Neither of the two attempted to pick it up; they glanced at it, then returned their eyes attentively to Cranehart's face.  \"It is, of course, an excellent copy,\" Cranehart went on, \"produced with a professional forger's equipment. As I imagine you're aware, that should have made it impossible to distinguish from the original weapon. However ... there's no real harm in telling you this now ... Geest technology has taken somewhat different turns than our own. In their weapons they employ traces of certain elements which we are only beginning to learn to maintain in stable form. That is a matter your government has kept from public knowledge because we don't wish the Geests to learn from human prisoners how much information we are gaining from them.  \"The instrument which made this copy naturally did not have such elements at its disposal. So it employed their lower homologues and in that manner successfully produced an almost identical model. In fact, the only significant difference is that such a gun, if it had been a complete model, could not possibly have been fired.\" He smiled briefly. \"But that, I think you will agree, _is_ a significant difference! We knew as soon as the so-called Geest gun was examined that it could only have been made by human beings.\"  \"Then,\" Commissioner Sanford said soberly, \"its apparent discovery on Roye during our visit was a deliberate hoax--\"  Cranehart nodded. \"Of course.\"  Ronald Black said, \"I fail to see why you've kept this quiet. You needn't have given away any secrets. Meanwhile the wave of public criticism at the government's seeming hesitancy to take action on the discovery--that is, to rush protection to the threatened Territorial Segments--has reached almost alarming proportions. You could have stopped it before it began two months ago with a single announcement.\"  \"Well, yes,\" Cranehart said. \"There were other considerations. Incidentally, Mr. Black, we are not unappreciative of the fact that the news media under your own control exercised a generous restraint in the matter.\"  \"For which,\" Black said dryly, \"I am now very thankful.\"  \"As for the others,\" Cranehart went on, \"the government has survived periods of criticism before. That is not important. The important thing is that the Geest War has been with us for more than a human life span now ... and it becomes difficult for many to bear in mind that until its conclusion no acts that might reduce our ability to prosecute it can be tolerated.\"  Ronald Black said slowly, \"So you've been delaying the announcement until you could find out who was responsible for the hoax.\"  \"We were interested,\" Cranehart said, \"only in the important men--the dangerous men. We don't care much who else is guilty of what. This, you see, is a matter of expediency, not of justice.\" He looked for a moment at the politely questioning, somewhat puzzled faces across the desk, went on, \"When you leave this room, each of you will be conducted to an office where you will be given certain papers to sign. That is the first step.\"         *       *       *  There was silence for some seconds. Ronald Black took a cigarette from a platinum case, tapped it gently on the desk, put it to his mouth and lit it. Cranehart went on, \"It would have been impossible to unravel this particular conspiracy if the forgery had been immediately exposed. At that time, no one had taken any obvious action. Then, within a few days--with the discovery apparently confirmed by our silence--normal maneuverings in industry and finance were observed to be under way. If a major shift in war policy was pending, if one or more key bases were to be established in Territorial Segments previously considered beyond the range of Geest reconnaissance and therefore secure from attack, this would be to somebody's benefit on Earth.\"  \"Isn't it always?\" Black murmured.  \"Of course. It's a normal procedure, ordinarily of no concern to government. It can be predicted with considerable accuracy to what group or groups the ultimate advantage in such a situation will go. But in these past weeks, it became apparent that somebody else was winning out ... somebody who could have won out only on the basis of careful and extensive preparation for this very situation.  \"That was abnormal, and it was the appearance of an abnormal pattern for which we had been waiting. We find there are seven men involved. These men will be deprived of the advantage they have gained.\"  Ronald Black shook his head, said, \"You're making a mistake, Cranehart. I'm signing no papers.\"  \"Nor I,\" Sanford said thickly.  Cranehart rubbed the side of his nose with a fingertip, said meditatively, \"You won't be forced to. Not directly.\" He nodded at the window. \"On the landing flange out there is an aircar. It is possible that this aircar will be found wrecked in the mountains some four hundred miles north of here early tomorrow morning. Naturally, we have a satisfactory story prepared to cover such an eventuality.\"  Sanford whitened slowly. He said, \"So you'd resort to murder!\"  Cranehart was silent for a few seconds. \"Mr. Sanford,\" he said then, \"you, as a member of the Territorial Office, know very well that the Geest War has consumed over four hundred million human lives to date. That is the circumstance which obliges your government to insist on your co-operation. I advise you to give it.\"  \"But you have no proof! You have nothing but surmises--\"  \"Consider this,\" Cranehart said. \"A conspiracy of the type I have described constitutes a capital offense under present conditions. Are you certain that you would prefer us to continue to look for proof?\"  Ronald Black said in a harsh voice, \"And what would the outcome be if we did choose to co-operate?\"  \"Well, we can't afford to leave men of your type in a position of influence, Mr. Black,\" Cranehart said amiably. \"And you understand, I'm sure, that it would be entirely too difficult to keep you under proper surveillance on Earth--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Celia Adams said from outside the cabin door, \"I think it is them, Phil. Both cars have started to circle.\"  Phil Boles came to the door behind her and looked up. It was early evening--Roye's sun just down, and a few stars out. The sky above the sea was still light. After a moment, he made out the two aircars moving in a wide, slow arc far overhead. He glanced at his watch.  \"Twenty minutes late,\" he remarked. \"But it couldn't be anyone else. And if they hadn't all come along, they wouldn't have needed two cars.\" He hesitated. \"We can't tell how they're going to take this, Celia, but they may have decided already that they could make out better without us.\" He nodded towards the edge of the cliff. \"Short way over there, and a long drop to the water! So don't let them surprise you.\"  She said coldly, \"I won't. And I've used guns before this.\"  \"Wouldn't doubt it.\" Phil reached back behind the door, picked up a flarelight standing beside a heavy machine rifle, and came outside. He pointed the light at the cars and touched the flash button briefly three times. After a moment, there were two answering flashes from the leading car.  \"So Wayne Jackson's in the front car,\" Phil said. \"Now let's see what they do.\" He returned the light to its place behind the door and came out again, standing about twelve feet to one side of Celia. The aircars vanished inland, came back at treetop level a few minutes later. One settled down quietly between the cabin and the edge of the cliff, the other following but dropping to the ground a hundred yards away, where it stopped. Phil glanced over at Celia, said softly, \"Watch that one!\" She nodded almost imperceptibly, right hand buried in her jacket pocket.  The near door of the car before them opened. Major Wayne Jackson, hatless and in hunting clothes, climbed out, staring at them. He said, \"Anyone else here?\"  \"Just Celia and myself,\" Phil said.  Jackson turned, spoke into the car and two men, similarly dressed, came out behind him. Phil recognized Ronald Black and Sanford. The three started over to the cabin, stopped a dozen feet away.  Jackson said sardonically, \"Our five other previous Earthside partners are in the second car. In spite of your insistence to meet the whole group, they don't want you and Celia to see their faces. They don't wish to be identifiable.\" He touched his coat lapel. \"They'll hear what we're saying over this communicator and they could talk to you, but won't unless they feel it's necessary. You'll have to take my word for it that we're all present.\"  \"That's good enough,\" Phil said.  \"All right,\" Jackson went on, \"now what did you mean by forcing us to take this chance? Let me make it plain. Colonel Thayer hasn't been accused of collaborating in the Roye gun hoax, but he got a black eye out of the affair just the same. And don't forget that a planet with colonial status is technically under martial law, which includes the civilians. If Silas Thayer can get his hands on the guilty persons, the situation will become a lot more unpleasant than it already is.\"         *       *       *  Phil addressed Ronald Black, \"Then how about you two? When you showed up here again on a transfer list, Thayer must have guessed why.\"  Black shook his head. \"Both of us exercised the privilege of changing our names just prior to the outtransfer. He doesn't know we're on Roye. We don't intend to let him find out.\"  Phil asked, \"Did you make any arrangements to get out of Roye again?\"  \"Before leaving Earth?\" Black showed his teeth in a humorless smile. \"Boles, you have no idea of how abruptly and completely the government men cut us off from"]]]
