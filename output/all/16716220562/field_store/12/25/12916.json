Twelve months ago, I began to collect the necessary material for the completion of \"The Story of My Life,\" which my venerated and beloved friend, Dr. Ryerson, had only left in partial outline. These materials, in the shape of letters, papers, and documents, were fortunately most abundant. The difficulty that I experienced was to select from such a miscellaneous collection a sufficient quantity of suitable matter, which I could afterwards arrange and group into appropriate chapters. This was not easily done, so as to form a connected record of the life and labours of a singularly gifted man, whose name was intimately connected with every public question which was discussed, and every prominent event which took place in Upper Canada from 1825 to 1875-78.  Public men of the present day looked upon Dr. Ryerson practically as one of their own contemporaries--noted for his zeal and energy in the successful management of a great Public Department, and as the founder of a system of Popular Education which, in his hands, became the pride and glory of Canadians, and was to those beyond the Dominion, an ideal system--the leading features of which they would gladly see incorporated"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24586"],["title","The Story of My Life (#1)"],["body"," their own. In this estimate of Dr. Ryerson's labours they were quite correct. And in their appreciation of the statesmanlike qualities of mind, which devised and developed such a system in the midst of difficulties which would have appalled less resolute hearts, they were equally correct.  But, after all, how immeasurably does this partial view of his character and labours fall short of a true estimate of that character and of those labours!  As a matter of fact, Dr. Ryerson's great struggle for the civil and religious freedom which we now enjoy, was almost over when he assumed the position of Chief Director of our Educational System. No one can read the record of his labours from 1825 to 1845, as detailed in the following pages, without being impressed with the fact that, had he done no more for his native country than that which is therein recorded, he would have accomplished a great work, and have earned the gratitude of his fellow-countrymen.  It was my good fortune to enjoy Dr. Ryerson's warm, personal friendship since 1841. It has also been my distinguished privilege to be associated with him in the accomplishment of his great educational work since 1844. I have been able, therefore, to turn my own personal knowledge of most of the events outlined in this volume to account in its preparation. In regard to what transpired before 1841, I have frequently heard many narratives in varied forms from Dr. Ryerson's lips.  My own intimate relations with Dr. Ryerson, and the character of our close personal friendship are sufficiently indicated in his private letters to me, published in various parts of the book, but especially in Chapter liii. And yet they fail to convey the depth and sincerity of his personal attachment, and the feeling of entire trust and confidence which existed between us.  I am glad to say that I was not alone in this respect. Dr. Ryerson had the faculty, so rare in official life, of attaching his assistants and subordinates of every grade to himself personally. He always had a pleasant word for them, and made them feel that their interests were safe in his hands. They therefore respected and trusted him fully, and he never failed to acknowledge their fidelity and devotion in the public service.  I had, for some time before he ceased to be the Head of the Education Department, looked forward with pain and anxiety to that inevitable event. Pain, that he and I were at length to be separated in the carrying forward of the great work of our lives, in which it had been my pride and pleasure to be his principal assistant. Anxiety at what, from my knowledge of him, I feared would be the effect of release from the work on fully accomplishing which he had so earnestly set his heart. Nor were my fears groundless. To a man of his application and ardent temperament, the feeling that his work was done sensibly affected him. He lost a good deal of his elasticity, and during the last few years of his life, very perceptibly failed.  The day on which he took official leave of the Department was indeed a memorable one. As he bade farewell to each of his assistants in the office, he and they were deeply moved. He could not, however, bring himself to utter a word to me at our official parting, but as soon as he reached home he wrote to me the following tender and loving note:--       171 Victoria Street, Toronto,       Monday Evening, February 21st, 1876.       My Dear Hodgins,--I felt too deeply to-day when parting with you in      the Office to be able to say a word. I was quite overcome with the      thought of severing our official connection, which has existed      between us for thirty-two years, during the whole of which time,      without interruption, we have laboured as one mind and heart in two      bodies, and I believe with a single eye to promote the best      interests of our country, irrespective of religious sect or      political party--to devise, develop, and mature a system of      instruction which embraces and provides for every child in the land      a good education; good teachers to teach; good inspectors to      oversee the Schools; good maps, globes, and text-books; good books      to read; and every provision whereby Municipal Councils and      Trustees can provide suitable accommodation, teachers, and      facilities for imparting education and knowledge to the rising      generation of the land.       While I devoted the year 1845 to visiting educating countries and      investigating their system of instruction, in order to devise one      for our country, you devoted the same time in Dublin in mastering,      under the special auspices of the Board of Education there, the      several different branches of their Education Office, in      administering the system of National Education in Ireland, so that      in the details of our Education Office here, as well as in our      general school system, we have been enabled to build up the most      extensive establishment in the country, leaving nothing, as far as      I know, to be devised in the completeness of its arrangements, and      in the good character and efficiency of its officers. Whatever      credit or satisfaction may attach to the accomplishment of this      work, I feel that you are entitled to share equally with myself.      Could I have believed that I might have been of any service to you,      or to others with whom I have laboured so cordially, or that I      could have advanced the school system, I would not have voluntarily      retired from office. But all circumstances considered, and entering      within a few days upon my 74th year, I have felt that this was the      time for me to commit to other hands the reins of the government of      the public school system, and labour during the last hours of my      day and life, in a more retired sphere.       But my heart is, and ever will be, with you in its sympathies and      prayers, and neither you nor yours will more truly rejoice in your      success and happiness, than       Your old life-long Friend       And Fellow-labourer,       E. Ryerson.  Dr. Ryerson was confessedly a man of great intellectual resources. Those who read what he has written on the question--perilous to any writer in the early days of the history of this Province--of equal civil and religious rights for the people of Upper Canada, will be impressed with the fact that he had thoroughly mastered the great principles of civil and religious liberty, and expounded them not only with courage, but with clearness and force. His papers on the clergy reserve question, and the rights of the Canadian Parliament in the matter, were statesmanlike and exhaustive.  His exposition of a proposed system of education for his native country was both philosophical and eminently practical. As a Christian Minister, he was possessed of rare gifts, both in the pulpit and on the platform; while his warm sympathies and his deep religious experience, made him not only a \"son of consolation,\" but a beloved and welcome visitor in the homes of the sorrowing and the afflicted. Among his brethren he exercised great personal influence; and in the counsels of the Conference he occupied a trusted and foremost place.  Thus we see that Dr. Ryerson's character was a many-sided one; while his talents were remarkably versatile. He was an able writer on public affairs; a noted Wesleyan Minister, and a successful and skilful leader among his brethren. But his fame in the future will mainly rest upon the fact that he was a distinguished Canadian Educationist, and the Founder of a great system of Public Education for Upper Canada. What makes this widely conceded excellence in his case the more marked, was the fact that the soil on which he had to labour was unprepared, and the social condition of the country was unpropitious. English ideas of schools for the poor, supported by subscriptions and voluntary offerings, prevailed in Upper Canada; free schools were unknown; the very principle on which they rest--that is, that the rateable property of the country is responsible for the education of the youth of the land--was denounced as communistic, and an invasion of the rights of property; while \"compulsory education\"--the proper and necessary complement of free schools--was equally denounced as the essence of \"Prussian despotism,\" and an impertinent and unjustifiable interference with \"the rights of British subjects.\"  It was a reasonable boast at the time that only systems of popular education, based upon the principle of free schools, were possible in the republican American States, where the wide diffusion of education was regarded as a prime necessity for the stability and success of republican institutions, and, therefore, was fostered with unceasing care. It was the theme on which the popular orator loved to dilate to a people on whose sympathies with the subject he could always confidently reckon. The practical mind of Dr. Ryerson, however, at once saw that the American idea of free schools was the true one. He moreover perceived that by giving his countrymen facilities for freely discussing the question among the ratepayers once a year, they would educate themselves into the idea, without any interference from the State. These facilities were provided in 1850; and for twenty-one years the question of free-schools _versus_ rate-bill schools (lees, &c.) was discussed every January in from 3,000 to 5,000 school sections, until free schools became voluntarily the rule, and rate-bill schools the exception. In 1871, by common consent, the free school principle was incorporated into our school system by the Legislature, and has ever since been the universal practice. In the adoption of this principle, and in the successful administration of the Education Department, Dr. Ryerson at length demonstrated that a popular (or, as it had been held in the United States, the democratic) system of public schools was admirably adapted to our"]]]
