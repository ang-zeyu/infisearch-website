Beyond the platform, on the other side, there is usually, when a train comes in, a long row of cabs and carriages drawn up, ready to take the passengers from the several cars; so that the traveller has generally nothing to do but to step across the platform from the car that he came in to the cab that is waiting there to receive him. Nor is there, as is usual in America, any difficulty or delay in regard to the baggage; for each man's trunks are placed on the car that he rides in, directly over his head; so that, while he walks across the platform to the cab, the railway porter takes his trunk across and places it on the top of the cab; and thus he is off from the station in his cab within two minutes sometimes after he arrived at it in the car.  The railway porters, who attend to the business of transferring the passengers thus from the railway carriages to those of the street, are very numerous all along the platform; and they are very civil and attentive to the passengers, especially to those who come in the first-class cars--and more especially still, according to my observation and experience, if the traveller has an agreeable looking lady under his charge. The porters are dressed in a sort of uniform, by which they are readily distinguished from the crowd. They are strictly forbidden to receive any fee or gratuity from the passengers. This prohibition, however, does not prevent their taking very thankfully the shillings or sixpences[A] that are often offered them, particularly by Americans, who, being strangers in the country, and not understanding the customs very well, think that they require a little more attention than others, and so are willing to pay a little extra fee. It is, however, contrary to the rules of the station for the porters to receive any thing; and, if they take it at all, they try to do it as secretly as possible. I once knew a traveller who offered a porter a shilling openly on the platform; but the porter, observing a policeman near, turned round with his side to the gentleman, and, holding his hand open behind him, with the back of it against his hip and his fingers moving up and down briskly in a beckoning manner, said,--  \"We are not allowed to take it, sir--we are not allowed to take it.\"  [A] Whenever shillings or sixpences are mentioned in this book, English coin is meant. As a general rule, each English denomination is of double the value of the corresponding American one. Thus the English penny is a coin as large as a silver dollar, and it is worth two of the American pennies. The shilling is of the value of a quarter of a dollar; and a sixpence is equal to a New York shilling.         *       *       *       *       *  As Mr. George stepped out upon the platform at the London Bridge station his first thought was to find Rollo, who had chosen to come in a second-class car, partly for the purpose of saving the difference in the fare, and partly, as he said, \"for the fun of it.\" Rollo had a regular allowance from his father for his travelling expenses, sufficient to pay his way in the first-class conveyances; and the understanding was, that whatever he should save from this sum by travelling in the cheaper modes was to be his own for pocket money or to add to his reserved funds.  Mr. George and Rollo soon found each other on the platform.  \"Well, Rollo,\" said Mr. George, \"and how do you like travelling cheap?\"  \"Pretty well,\" said Rollo; \"only I could not see out much; but then I have saved six shillings in coming from Dover. That is the same as twelve New York shillings--a dollar and a half. I can buy several pretty things with that to carry home.\"  \"That's very true,\" said Mr. George.  \"Some time I mean to go in the fourth-class car,\" said Rollo. \"'Tis true we have to stand up all the time like sheep in a pen; but I shall not care for that.\"  \"Well, you can try it,\" said Mr. George; \"but now for our luggage.\"  The English people always call the effects which a traveller takes with him on the journey his luggage.  Very soon a porter took Mr. George's trunk from the top of the car.  \"Will you have a cab, sir?\" said the porter, touching his cap to Mr. George.  \"I want to leave my trunk here for a short time under your charge,\" said Mr. George. \"That is a little out of the line of your duty, I know; but I will remember that when I come for it.\"  \"All right, sir,\" said the porter, promptly, touching his cap again.  He took up the trunk and threw it on his shoulder; and then, followed by Mr. George and Rollo, he walked away to the luggage room. After it had been properly deposited in its place, Mr. George and Rollo went out of the station into the street.  \"Are not you going to ride?\" said Rollo to Mr. George.  \"No,\" said Mr. George; \"I am going to walk.\"  \"What's that for?\" said Rollo.  \"There are two reasons,\" said Mr. George; \"one is, I want to show you London Bridge.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo; \"and what is the other reason?\"  \"The other is,\" said Mr. George, \"that I do not wish to have the trouble of the luggage while I am looking out lodgings. If I go to a hotel and leave my luggage there and take a room, and then go and look up lodgings, we have the hotel bill to pay, without getting much benefit from it; and, if we take the luggage on a cab, we might go to a dozen different places before we find a room to suit us, and so have a monstrous great cab fare to pay.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo; \"I understand. Besides, I should like to walk through the streets and see the city.\"  As our two travellers walked along towards London Bridge, Mr. George explained to Rollo what is stated in the first chapter in respect to the double character of London.  \"What we are coming to now, first,\" said he, \"is the _city_--the commercial capital of the country. In fact, it may almost be said to be the commercial capital of the world. Here are the great docks and warehouses, where are accumulated immense stores of merchandise from every quarter of the globe. Here is the bank, with its enormous vaults full of treasures of gold and silver coin, and the immense legers in which are kept accounts with governments, and wealthy merchants, and great capitalists all over the world. Here is the post office, too, the centre of a system of communications, by land and sea, extending to every quarter of the globe.  \"The chief magistrate of the city,\" continued Mr. George, \"is called the lord mayor. He lives in a splendid palace called the Mansion House. Then there is the great Cathedral Church of St. Paul's, and a vast number of other churches, and chapels, and hospitals, and schools, all belonging to, and supported by, the commercial and business interests which concentrate in the city. You will find a very different set of buildings and institutions at the West End.\"  \"What shall we find there?\" asked Rollo.  \"We shall find there,\" said Mr. George, \"the palace of the queen; and the houses of Parliament, where the lords and commons assemble to make laws for the empire; and the Horse Guards, which is a great edifice that serves as head quarters for the British army; and the Admiralty, which is the head quarters of the navy; and the private palaces of the nobles; and the parks and pleasure grounds that connect and surround them.\"  About this time Mr. George and Rollo began to come in sight of London Bridge; and very soon afterwards they found themselves entering upon it. Rollo was, for a time, quite bewildered with astonishment at the extraordinary aspect of the scene. They came out upon the bridge, from the midst of a very dense and compact mass of streets and houses, on what is called the Surrey side of the river; and they could see, dimly defined through the murky atmosphere, the outlines of the city on the other side. There were long ranges of warehouses; and innumerable chimneys, pouring forth black smoke; and the Monument; and spires of churches; and, conspicuous among the rest,--though half obscured by murky clouds of smoke and vapor,--the immense dome of St. Paul's, with the great gilded ball and cross on the top of it.  The bridge was built of stone, on arches, and was of the most massive and ponderous character. There was a roadway in the centre of it, on which two continued streams of vehicles were passing--one on the left, going into the city; and the other on the right, coming out. On each side were broad stone sidewalks, formed of massive blocks of granite, feeling solid and heavy under the tread as if they had been laid upon the firm ground. These sidewalks were crowded with passengers, who were going, some into, and some out of, the city, so as to form on each sidewalk two continuous streams. On each side of the bridge, towards the water, was a solid parapet, or wall. This parapet was about as high as Rollo's shoulders. Here and there, at different places along the bridge, were groups of people that had stopped to look over the parapet to the river. Each group formed a little row, arranged along the parapet, with their faces towards the water.  \"Let us stop and look over,\" said Rollo.  \"No,\" said Mr. George, \"not now; we will wait till we get to the middle of the bridge.\"  So they walked on. When they had proceeded a little way, they came to a place where there was a sort of niche, or recess, in the parapet, perhaps ten or fifteen feet long, and four or five deep, from the sidewalk. There were stone seats extending all around the sides of this recess; and these seats were full of boys and men, some with burdens and some without, who had stopped and sat down there to rest. Rollo wished to propose to Mr. George that they should stop and sit down there too; not because he was tired, but only to see how it would seem to be seated in such a place. He did not propose this plan, however, for he saw at a glance that the seats were all occupied, and that there was no room.  A little distance beyond they came to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24182"],["title","Rollo in London (#2)"],["body"," niche, and afterwards to another, and another.  \"These niches are over the piers of the bridge,\" said Mr. George, \"I suppose. Let us look over and see.\"  So they stopped a moment and looked over the parapet. They beheld a turbid and whirling stream pouring through the bridge, under the arches, with a very rapid current, and at the instant that they looked down, they saw the bows of a small steamboat come shooting through. The deck of the steamer was crowded with people--men, women, and children. Some were standing, and others were sitting on benches that were arranged round the side and along the middle of the deck; all, however, in the open air.  \"I wonder where that steamer is going,\" said Rollo.  \"Down the river somewhere,\" said Mr. George; \"perhaps to Greenwich or Woolwich.\"  \"_Up_ the river, you mean,\" said Rollo. \"Don't you see she is going against the current? See how swift the water runs under the arches of the bridge!\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George; \"but that current is the tide, coming in from the sea. This way is down towards the mouth of the river. See all this shipping here! It has come up from the sea.\" Here Mr. George pointed with his hand down the river, waving it from one side to the other, so as to direct Rollo's attention to both shores, where there lay immense forests of shipping, three or four tiers deep on each side, and extending down the river as far as the eye could penetrate into the thick and murky atmosphere. Besides the tiers of shipping which lay thus along the shores of the river, there were two other ranges, each three or four tiers wide, out in the stream, leaving a broad, open passage between them, in the middle, and two narrower passages, one on each side, between them and the shore.  \"It is a city of ships,\" said Rollo, \"with streets of open water.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"it is indeed.\"  The streets, as Rollo called them, of open water, were full of boats, going and coming, and of lighters and wherries, with a steamer now and then shooting along among them, or a large vessel slowly coming up or going down by means of its sails.  \"This is the way _down_ the river,\" repeated Mr. George. \"The ships have come up as far as here; but they cannot go any farther, on account of the bridge. Look above the bridge, and you will see that there are no ships.\" So Rollo and Mr. George turned round to look up the river. They could only catch an occasional glimpse of the river through casual openings in the stream of carts, carriages, vans, cabs, wagons, and omnibuses that were incessantly rolling on in opposite streams along the roadway of the bridge. Although the view was thus obstructed, they could easily see there were no ships above the bridge that they were standing on. There were, however, several other bridges farther up, with a great many boats passing to and fro among them; and, here and there, there appeared a long and sharp-built little steamer, gliding swiftly through the water. These steamers were painted black, and they poured forth volumes of smoke so dark and dense from their funnels as quite to fill the air, and make the whole prospect in that direction exceedingly murky and obscure.  \"Let us go over to the other side of the bridge,\" said Rollo.  \"Not yet,\" said Mr. George; \"but you see that there is no shipping above the bridge. Vessels _could not_ go up above the bridge, in fact. They could not go up, for the masts are too long to pass under the arches.\"  \"They might have a draw in the middle of the bridge,\" said Rollo.  \"No,\" said Mr. George. \"A draw will not answer, except in cases where there is only a moderate degree of passing over a bridge, so as to allow of an interruption for a little time without any great inconvenience. But this bridge, you see, is perfectly thronged all the time with continued streams of foot passengers and carriages. If a draw were to be opened in this bridge for only ten minutes, to allow a vessel to go through, there would be such a jam on both sides that it would take all day to disentangle it.\"  \"I don't see how the little steamers get through under the bridges,\" said Rollo. \"The smoke-pipes are higher than the arches.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"they are. But I will show you how they manage that by and by. There is something very curious about that. Now let us look down the river again.\"  So Rollo turned round with Mr. George, and they both looked down the river. They saw on the left hand of the river--that is, on the London side, the side towards which they were going--a great steamboat landing, with several steamboats lying near it.  \"That is where the steamboats lie,\" said Mr. George, \"that go down to the mouth of the river, and across the sea to France, Holland, and Germany.\"  \"I should like to go in one of them,\" said Rollo.  \"Do you see that large building just below the steamboat landing, fronting the river?\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo; \"what is it?\"  \"It is the Custom House,\" said Mr. George. \"Every ship that comes into the Thames from foreign countries has to send her manifest there and pay the duties.\"  \"What is a manifest?\" said Rollo.  \"It is a list, or schedule,\" said Mr. George, \"of every thing there is contained in the cargo. The officers of the Custom House make a calculation, by this manifest, of the amount of duties that are to be paid to the government for the cargo, and the owners of the ship have to pay it before they can land their goods.\"  \"Can we go into the Custom House and see it?\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"I am sure it must be open to the public, because all sorts of persons must have occasion to go there continually, to transact business; but I do not suppose there would be much to see inside. There would be a great many tables and desks, and a great many clerks and monstrous big account books, and multitudes of people coming and going continually; but that would be all.\"  \"I should like to go and see them,\" said Rollo.  \"Well,\" said Mr. George, \"perhaps we will look in some time when we are going by on our way to the Tower or to the Tunnel. But now look down just below the Custom House and see the Tower.\"  Rollo looked in the direction which Mr. George indicated; and there he saw upon the bank of the river, a little below the Custom House, rising above the other buildings in that quarter of the town, a large, square edifice, with turrets at the corners. This building was surrounded with other edifices of a castellated form, which gave the whole the appearance of an extended fortress.  \"That,\" said Mr. George, \"is the famous Tower of London.\"  \"What is it famous for?\" said Rollo.  \"I can't stop to tell you about it now,\" said Mr. George. \"It was built originally as a sort of fort to defend the city. You see, the place where the Tower stands was formerly the lower corner of the city; and there was a wall, beginning at the Tower, and running back all around the city, and so down to the water again at the upper end of it. Do you see St. Paul's?\" added Mr. George, turning half round and pointing.  \"Yes,\" said Rollo; \"but it is pretty smoky.\"  \"You can see,\" said Mr. George, \"from the position of St. Paul's, where the old wall went. It passed some distance back from St. Paul's, and came down to the water some distance above it. All within this wall was the old city of London; and the Tower was built at the lower corner of it to defend it.  \"Do you see any reason,\" continued Mr. George, \"why they should place the Tower at the lower end, rather than at the upper end, of the city?\"  \"No,\" said Rollo, \"I do not see any reason in particular.\"  \"The reason was,\" said Mr. George, \"that what they had reason to guard the city against was the danger of an attack from enemies coming _up_ the river in ships from the sea; and so they placed the Tower _below_ the city, in order to intercept them. But now the city has spread and extended down the river far below the Tower, and back far beyond the old wall; so that the Tower is, at the present time, in the midst of an immense region of streets and warehouses, and it is no longer of any use as a fortification. It is too high up.\"  \"What do they use it for, then?\" said Rollo.  \"It is used by the government,\" said Mr. George, \"as a sort of strong box, to keep curiosities, treasures, and valuables of all sorts in, and any thing else, in fact, which they wish to have in safe and secure custody. They keep what are called state prisoners there.\"  \"Can we go in the Tower,\" said Rollo, \"and see all these things?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"we can see the treasures and curiosities; but I believe there are no prisoners there now.\"  Just then Rollo heard a rapping sound upon the stone of the sidewalk near him. He looked round to see what it was. There was a blind man coming along. He had a stick in his hand, which seemed to be armed at the lower end with a little ferule of iron. With this iron the blind man kept up a continual rapping on the flagstones as he slowly advanced. The iron produced a sharp and ringing sound, which easily made itself heard above the thundering din of the carriages and vans that were rolling incessantly over the bridge, and served as a warning to the foot passengers on the sidewalk that a blind man was coming. Every one hearing this rapping looked up to see what it meant; and, perceiving that it was a blind man, they moved to one side and the other to make way for him. Thus, though the sidewalk was so crowded that a person with eyes could scarcely get along, the blind man, though he moved very slowly, had always vacant space before him, and advanced without any difficulty or danger.[B]  [B] See frontispiece.  \"Think of a blind man in such a crowd as this!\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George.  \"And he gets along better than any of the rest of us,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"so it seems.\"  \"The next time I wish to go through a crowd,\" said Rollo, \"I mean to get a cane, and then shut my eyes and rap with it, and every body will make room for me.\"  \"Look"]]]
