Voltaire was born in the year 1694.  He lived until within ten or eleven years of the outbreak of the Great French Revolution, and was a chief leader in the movement of thought that preceded the Revolution.  Though he lived to his eighty-fourth year, Voltaire was born with a weak body. His brother Armand, eight years his senior, became a Jansenist.  Voltaire when ten years old was placed with the Jesuits in the College Louis-le- Grand.  There he was taught during seven years, and his genius was encouraged in its bent for literature; skill in speaking and in writing being especially fostered in the system of education which the Jesuits had planned to produce capable men who by voice and pen could give a reason for the faith they held.  Verses written for an invalid soldier at the age of eleven won for young Voltaire the friendship of Ninon l'Enclos, who encouraged him to go on writing verses.  She died soon afterwards, and remembered him with a legacy of two thousand livres for purchase of books.  He wrote in his lively school-days a tragedy that afterwards he burnt.  At the age of seventeen he left the College Louis- le-Grand, where he said afterwards that he had been taught nothing but Latin and the Stupidities.  He was then sent to the law schools, and saw life in Paris as a gay young poet who, with all his brilliant liveliness, had an aptitude for looking on the tragic side of things, and one of whose first poems was an \"Ode on the Misfortunes of Life.\"  His mother died when he was twenty.  Voltaire's father thought him a fool for his versifying, and attached him as secretary to the Marquis of Chateauneuf; when he went as ambassador to the Hague.  In December, 1713, he was dismissed for his irregularities.  In Paris his unsteadiness and his addiction to literature caused his father to rejoice in getting him housed in a country chateau with M. de Caumartin.  M. de Caumartin's father talked with such enthusiasm of Henri IV. and Sully that Voltaire planned the writing of what became his _Henriade_, and his \"History of the Age of Louis XIV.,\" who died on the 1st of September, 1715.  Under the regency that followed, Voltaire got into trouble again and again through the sharpness of his pen, and at last, accused of verse that satirised the Regent, he was locked up--on the 17th of May, 1717--in the Bastille.  There he wrote the first two books of his _Henriade_, and finished a play on OEdipus, which he had begun at the age of eighteen.  He did not obtain full liberty until the 12th of April, 1718, and it was at this time--with a clearly formed design to associate the name he took with work of high attempt in literature--that Francois Marie Arouet, aged twenty-four, first called himself Voltaire.  Voltaire's _OEdipe_ was played with success in November, 1718.  A few months later he was again banished from Paris, and finished the _Henriade_ in his retirement, as well as another play, _Artemise_, that was acted in February, 1720.  Other plays followed.  In December, 1721, Voltaire visited Lord Bolingbroke, who was then an exile from England, at the Chateau of La Source.  There was now constant literary activity.  From July to October, 1722, Voltaire visited Holland with Madame de Rupelmonde.  After a serious attack of small-pox in November, 1723, Voltaire was active as a poet about the Court.  He was then in receipt of a pension of two thousand livres from the king, and had inherited more than twice as much by the death of his father in January, 1722.  But in December, 1725, a quarrel, fastened upon him by the Chevalier de Rohan, who had him waylaid and beaten, caused him to send a challenge.  For this he was arrested and lodged once more, in April, 1726, in the Bastille. There he was detained a month; and his first act when he was released was to ask for a passport to England.  Voltaire left France, reached London in August, 1726, went as guest to the house of a rich merchant at Wandsworth, and remained three years in this country, from the age of thirty-two to the age of thirty-five.  He was here when George I. died, and George II. became king.  He published here his _Henriade_.  He wrote here his \"History of Charles XII.\"  He read \"Gulliver's Travels\" as a new book, and might have been present at the first night of _The Beggar's Opera_.  He was here whet Sir Isaac Newton died.  In 1731 he published at Rouen the _Lettres sur les Anglais_, which appeared in England in 1733 in the volume from which they are here reprinted.  H.M.     LETTERS ON ENGLAND   LETTER I.--ON THE QUAKERS   I was of opinion that the doctrine and history of so extraordinary a people were worthy the attention of the curious.  To acquaint myself with them I made a visit to one of the most eminent Quakers in England, who, after having traded thirty years, had the wisdom to prescribe limits to his fortune and to his desires, and was settled in a little solitude not far from London.  Being come into it, I perceived a small but regularly built house, vastly neat, but without the least pomp of furniture.  The Quaker who owned it was a hale, ruddy-complexioned old man, who had never been afflicted with sickness because he had always been insensible to passions, and a perfect stranger to intemperance.  I never in my life saw a more noble or a more engaging aspect than his.  He was dressed like those of his persuasion, in a plain coat without pleats in the sides, or buttons on the pockets and sleeves; and had on a beaver, the brims of which were horizontal like those of our clergy.  He did not uncover himself when I appeared, and advanced towards me without once stooping his body; but there appeared more politeness in the open, humane air of his countenance, than in the custom of drawing one leg behind the other, and taking that from the head which is made to cover it.  \"Friend,\" says he to me, \"I perceive thou art a stranger, but if I can do anything for thee, only tell me.\"  \"Sir,\" said I to him, bending forwards and advancing, as is usual with us, one leg towards him, \"I flatter myself that my just curiosity will not give you the least offence, and that you'll do me the honour to inform me of the particulars of your religion.\"  \"The people of thy country,\" replied the Quaker, \"are too full of their bows and compliments, but I never yet met with one of them who had so much curiosity as thyself.  Come in, and let us first dine together.\"  I still continued to make some very unseasonable ceremonies, it not being easy to disengage one's self at once from habits we have been long used to; and after taking part in a frugal meal, which began and ended with a prayer to God, I began to question my courteous host.  I opened with that which good Catholics have more than once made to Huguenots.  \"My dear sir,\" said I, \"were you ever baptised?\"  \"I never was,\" replied the Quaker, \"nor any of my brethren.\"  \"Zounds!\" say I to him, \"you are not Christians, then.\"  \"Friend,\" replies the old man in a soft tone of voice, \"swear not; we are Christians, and endeavour to be good Christians, but we are not of opinion that the sprinkling water on a child's head makes him a Christian.\"  \"Heavens!\" say I, shocked at his impiety, \"you have then forgot that Christ was baptised by St. John.\" \"Friend,\" replies the mild Quaker once again, \"swear not; Christ indeed was baptised by John, but He himself never baptised anyone.  We are the disciples of Christ, not of John.\"  I pitied very much the sincerity of my worthy Quaker, and was absolutely for forcing him to get himself christened.  \"Were that all,\" replied he very gravely, \"we would submit cheerfully to baptism, purely in compliance with thy weakness, for we don't condemn any person who uses it; but then we think that those who profess a religion of so holy, so spiritual a nature as that of Christ, ought to abstain to the utmost of their power from the Jewish ceremonies.\"  \"O unaccountable!\" say I: \"what! baptism a Jewish ceremony?\"  \"Yes, my friend,\" says he, \"so truly Jewish, that a great many Jews use the baptism of John to this day.  Look into ancient authors, and thou wilt find that John only revived this practice; and that it had been used by the Hebrews, long before his time, in like manner as the Mahometans imitated the Ishmaelites in their pilgrimages to Mecca.  Jesus indeed submitted to the baptism of John, as He had suffered Himself to be circumcised; but circumcision and the washing with water ought to be abolished by the baptism of Christ, that baptism of the Spirit, that ablution of the soul, which is the salvation of mankind. Thus the forerunner said, 'I indeed baptise you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.'  Likewise Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, writes as follows to the Corinthians, 'Christ sent me not to baptise, but to preach the Gospel;' and indeed Paul never baptised but two persons with water, and that very much against his inclinations.  He circumcised his disciple Timothy, and the other disciples likewise circumcised all who were willing to submit to that carnal ordinance.  But art thou circumcised?\" added he.  \"I have not the honour to be so,\" say I.  \"Well, friend,\" continues the Quaker, \"thou art a Christian without being circumcised, and I am one without being baptised.\"  Thus did this pious man make a wrong but very specious application of four or five texts of Scripture which seemed to favour the tenets of his sect; but at the same"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2445"],["title","Letters on England (#1)"],["body"," forgot very sincerely an hundred texts which made directly against them. I had more sense than to contest with him, since there is no possibility of convincing an enthusiast.  A man should never pretend to inform a lover of his mistress's faults, no more than one who is at law, of the badness of his cause; nor attempt to win over a fanatic by strength of reasoning.  Accordingly I waived the subject.  \"Well,\" said I to him, \"what sort of a communion have you?\"  \"We have none like that thou hintest at among us,\" replied he.  \"How! no communion?\" said I.  \"Only that spiritual one,\" replied he, \"of hearts.\" He then began again to throw out his texts of Scripture; and preached a most eloquent sermon against that ordinance.  He harangued in a tone as though he had been inspired, to prove that the sacraments were merely of human invention, and that the word \"sacrament\" was not once mentioned in the Gospel.  \"Excuse,\" said he, \"my ignorance, for I have not employed a hundredth part of the arguments which might be brought to prove the truth of our religion, but these thou thyself mayest peruse in the Exposition of our Faith written by Robert Barclay.  It is one of the best pieces that ever was penned by man; and as our adversaries confess it to be of dangerous tendency, the arguments in it must necessarily be very convincing.\"  I promised to peruse this piece, and my Quaker imagined he had already made a convert of me.  He afterwards gave me an account in few words of some singularities which make this sect the contempt of others.  \"Confess,\" said he, \"that it was very difficult for thee to refrain from laughter, when I answered all thy civilities without uncovering my head, and at the same time said 'thee' and 'thou' to thee. However, thou appearest to me too well read not to know that in Christ's time no nation was so ridiculous as to put the plural number for the singular.  Augustus Caesar himself was spoken to in such phrases as these: 'I love thee,' 'I beseech thee,' 'I thank thee;' but he did not allow any person to call him 'Domine,' sir.  It was not till many ages after that men would have the word 'you,' as though they were double, instead of 'thou' employed in speaking to them; and usurped the flattering titles of lordship, of eminence, and of holiness, which mere worms bestow on other worms by assuring them that they are with a most profound respect, and an infamous falsehood, their most obedient humble servants.  It is to secure ourselves more strongly from such a shameless traffic of lies and flattery, that we 'thee' and 'thou' a king with the same freedom as we do a beggar, and salute no person; we owing nothing to mankind but charity, and to the laws respect and obedience.  \"Our apparel is also somewhat different from that of others, and this purely, that it may be a perpetual warning to us not to imitate them. Others wear the badges and marks of their several dignities, and we those of Christian humility.  We fly from all assemblies of pleasure, from diversions of every kind, and from places where gaming is practised; and indeed our case would be very deplorable, should we fill with such levities as those I have mentioned the heart which ought to be the habitation of God.  We never swear, not even in a court of justice, being of opinion that the most holy name of God ought not to be prostituted in the miserable contests betwixt man and man.  When we are obliged to appear before a magistrate upon other people's account (for law-suits are unknown among the Friends), we give evidence to the truth by sealing it with our yea or nay; and the judges believe us on our bare affirmation, whilst so many other Christians forswear themselves on the holy Gospels. We never war or fight in any case; but it is not that we are afraid, for so far from shuddering at the thoughts of death, we on the contrary bless the moment which unites us with the Being of Beings; but the reason of our not using the outward sword is, that we are neither wolves, tigers, nor mastiffs, but men and Christians.  Our God, who has commanded us to love our enemies, and to suffer without repining, would certainly not permit us to cross the seas, merely because murderers clothed in scarlet, and wearing caps two foot high, enlist citizens by a noise made with two little sticks on an ass's skin extended.  And when, after a victory is gained, the whole city of London is illuminated; when the sky is in a blaze with fireworks, and a noise is heard in the air, of thanksgivings, of bells, of organs, and of the cannon, we groan in silence, and are deeply affected with sadness of spirit and brokenness of heart, for the sad havoc which is the occasion of those public rejoicings.\"    LETTER II.--ON THE QUAKERS   Such was the substance of the conversation I had with this very singular person; but I was greatly surprised to see him come the Sunday following and take me with him to the Quakers' meeting.  There are several of these in London, but that which he carried me to stands near the famous pillar called The Monument.  The brethren were already assembled at my entering it with my guide.  There might be about four hundred men and three hundred women in the meeting.  The women hid their faces behind their fans, and the men were covered with their broad-brimmed hats.  All were seated, and the silence was universal.  I passed through them, but did not perceive so much as one lift up his eyes to look at me.  This silence lasted a quarter of an hour, when at last one of them rose up, took off his hat, and, after making a variety of wry faces and groaning in a most lamentable manner, he, partly from his nose and partly from his mouth, threw out a strange, confused jumble of words (borrowed, as he imagined, from the Gospel) which neither himself nor any of his hearers understood. When this distorter had ended his beautiful soliloquy, and that the stupid, but greatly edified, congregation were separated, I asked my friend how it was possible for the judicious part of their assembly to suffer such a babbling?  \"We are obliged,\" says he, \"to suffer it, because no one knows when a man rises up to hold forth whether he will be moved by the Spirit or by folly.  In this doubt and uncertainty we listen patiently to everyone; we even allow our women to hold forth.  Two or three of these are often inspired at one and the same time, and it is then that a most charming noise is heard in the Lord's house.\"  \"You have, then, no priests?\" say I to him.  \"No, no, friend,\" replies the Quaker, \"to our great happiness.\"  Then opening one of the Friends' books, as he called it, he read the following words in an emphatic tone:--\"'God forbid we should presume to ordain anyone to receive the Holy Spirit on the Lord's Day to the prejudice of the rest of the brethren.'  Thanks to the Almighty, we are the only people upon earth that have no priests.  Wouldst thou deprive us of so happy a distinction? Why should we abandon our babe to mercenary nurses, when we ourselves have milk enough for it?  These mercenary creatures would soon domineer in our houses and destroy both the mother and the babe.  God has said, 'Freely you have received, freely give.'  Shall we, after these words, cheapen, as it were, the Gospel, sell the Holy Ghost, and make of an assembly of Christians a mere shop of traders?  We don't pay a set of men clothed in black to assist our poor, to bury our dead, or to preach to the brethren.  These offices are all of too tender a nature for us ever to entrust them to others.\"  \"But how is it possible for you,\" said I, with some warmth, \"to know whether your discourse is really inspired by the Almighty?\"  \"Whosoever,\" says he, \"shall implore Christ to enlighten him, and shall publish the Gospel truths he may feel inwardly, such an one may be assured that he is inspired by the Lord.\"  He then poured forth a numberless multitude of Scripture texts which proved, as he imagined, that there is no such thing as Christianity without an immediate revelation, and added these remarkable words: \"When thou movest one of thy limbs, is it moved by thy own power?  Certainly not; for this limb is often sensible to involuntary motions.  Consequently he who created thy body gives motion to this earthly tabernacle.  And are the several ideas of which thy soul receives the impression formed by thyself?  Much less are they, since these pour in upon thy mind whether thou wilt or no; consequently thou receivest thy ideas from Him who created thy soul.  But as He leaves thy affections at full liberty, He gives thy mind such ideas as thy affections may deserve; if thou livest in God, thou actest, thou thinkest in God.  After this thou needest only but open thine eyes to that light which enlightens all mankind, and it is then thou wilt perceive the truth, and make others perceive it.\"  \"Why, this,\" said I, \"is Malebranche's doctrine to a tittle.\"  \"I am acquainted with thy Malebranche,\" said he; \"he had something of the Friend in him, but was not enough so.\"  These are the most considerable particulars I learnt concerning the doctrine of the Quakers.  In my next letter I shall acquaint you with their history, which you will find more singular than their opinions.    LETTER III.--ON THE QUAKERS   You have already heard that the Quakers date from Christ, who, according to them, was the first Quaker.  Religion, say these, was corrupted a little after His death, and remained in that state of corruption about sixteen hundred years.  But there were always a few Quakers concealed in the world, who carefully preserved the sacred fire, which was extinguished in all but themselves, until at last this light spread itself in England in 1642.  It was at the time when Great Britain was torn to pieces by the intestine wars which three or four sects had raised in the name of God, that one George Fox, born in Leicestershire, and son to a silk-weaver, took it into his head to preach, and, as he pretended, with all the"]]]
