You know what I mean.\" He stared down at Malone's hand. \"You know you've still got your lighter on?\" he added.  Malone looked down at it and shut it off. \"You asked me to hold it,\" he said.  \"I didn't mean indefinitely,\" Boyd said. \"Anyhow, how about grabbing a cab and heading on down to the hotel to get your stuff away, before we check in at Sixty-ninth Street?\"  \"Good idea,\" Malone said. \"And besides, I could do with a clean shirt. Not to mention a bath.\"  \"Trains get worse and worse,\" Boyd said, absently.         *       *       *       *       *  Malone punched the redcap's buttons again, and he and Boyd followed it through the crowded station to the taxi stand. The robot piled the suitcases into the cab, and somehow Malone and Boyd found room for themselves.  \"Statler-Hilton Hotel,\" Boyd said grandly.  The driver swung around to stare at them, blinked, and finally said: \"O.K., Mac. You said it.\" He started with a terrific grinding of gears, drove out of the Penn Station arch and went two blocks.  \"Here you are, Mac,\" he said, stopping the cab.  Malone stared at Boyd with a reproachful expression.  \"So how was I to know?\" Boyd said. \"I didn't know. If I'd known it was so close, we could've walked.\"  \"And saved half a buck,\" Malone said. \"But don't let it bother you--this is expense account money.\"  \"That's right,\" Boyd said. He beamed and tipped the driver heavily. The cab drove off and Malone hailed the doorman, who equipped them with a robot bellhop and sent them upstairs to their rooms.  Three-quarters of an hour later, Boyd and Malone were in the offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on East Sixty-ninth Street. There, they picked up a lot of nice, new, shiny facts. It was unfortunate, if not particularly surprising, that the facts did not seem to make any sense.  In the first place, only red 1972 Cadillacs seemed to be involved. Anybody who owned such a car was likely to find it missing at any time; there had been a lot of thefts reported, including some that hadn't had time to get into Burris' reports. New Jersey now claimed two victims, and New York had three of its own.  And all the cars weren't turning up in New York, by any means. Some of the New York cars had turned up in New Jersey. Some had turned up in Connecticut--including one of the New Jersey cars. So far, there had been neither thefts nor discoveries from Pennsylvania, but Malone couldn't see why.  There was absolutely no pattern that he, Boyd, or anyone else could find. The list of thefts and recoveries had been fed into an electronic calculator, which had neatly regurgitated them without being in the least helpful. It had remarked that the square of seven was forty-nine, but this was traced to a defect in the mechanism.  Whoever was borrowing the red Caddies exhibited a peculiar combination of burglarious genius and what looked to Malone like outright idiocy. This was plainly impossible.  Unfortunately, it had happened.  Locking the car doors didn't do a bit of good. The thief or thieves got in without so much as scratching the lock. This, obviously, proved that the criminal was either an extremely good lock-pick or knew where to get duplicate keys.  However, the ignition was invariably shorted across.  This proved neatly that the criminal was not a very good lock-pick, and did not know where to get duplicate keys.  Query: why work so hard on the doors, and not work at all on the ignition?  That was the first place. The second place was just what had been bothering Malone all along. There didn't seem to be any purpose to the car thefts. They hadn't been sold, or used as getaway cars. True, teenage delinquents sometimes stole cars just to use them joyriding, or as some sort of prank.  But a car or two every night? How many joyrides can one gang take? Malone thought. And how long does it take to get tired of the same prank?  And why, Malone asked himself wearily for what was beginning to feel like the ten thousandth time, why only red Cadillacs?  Burris, he told himself, must have been right all along. The red Cadillacs were only a smoke screen for something else. Perhaps it was the robot car, perhaps not--but whatever it was, Burris' general answer was the only one that made any sense at all.  That should have been a comforting thought, Malone reflected. Somehow, though it wasn't.  After they'd finished with the files and personnel at Sixty-ninth Street, Malone and Boyd started downtown on what turned out to be a sort of unguided tour of the New York Police Department. They spoke to some of the eyewitnesses, and ended up in Centre Street asking a lot of reasonably useless questions in the Motor Vehicle Bureau. In general, they spent nearly six hours on the Affair of the Self-Propelled Cadillac, picking up a whole bundle of facts. Some of the facts they had already known. Some were new, but unhelpful.  Somehow, nobody felt much like going out for a night on the town. Instead, both agents climbed wearily into bed thinking morose and disillusioned thoughts.  And, after that, a week passed. It was filled with ennui.  Only one thing became clear. In spite of the almost identical _modus operandi_, used in all the car thefts, they were obviously the work of a gang rather than a single person. This required the assumption that there was not one insane man at work, but a crew of them, all identically unbalanced.  \"But the jobs are just too scattered to be the work of one man,\" Malone said. \"To steal a car in Connecticut and drive it to the Bronx, and then steal another car in Westfield, New Jersey fifteen minutes later takes more than talent. It takes an outright for-sure magician.\"  This conclusion, while interesting, was not really helpful. The fact was that Malone needed more clues--or, anyhow, more facts--before he could do anything at all. And there just weren't any new facts around. He spent the week wandering morosely from one place to another, sometimes accompanied by Thomas Boyd and sometimes all alone. Time, he knew, was ticking by at its usual rate. But there wasn't a thing he could do about it.  He did try to relax and have some fun, as Burris had suggested. But he didn't seem to be able to get his mind off the case.  Boyd, after the first little while, had no such trouble. He entered the social life of the city with a whoop of joy and disappeared from sight. That was fine for Boyd, Malone reflected, but it did leave Malone himself just a little bit at loose ends.  Not that he begrudged Boyd his fun. It was nice that one of them was enjoying himself, anyway.  It was just that Malone was beginning to get fidgety. He needed to be doing something--even if it were only taking a walk.  So he took a walk, and ended up, to his own surprise, downtown near Greenwich Village.  And then he'd been bopped on the head.     IV.   The patrol car pulled up in front of St. Vincent's Hospital and one of the cops helped Malone into the Emergency Receiving Room. He didn't feel as bad as he had a few minutes before. The motion of the car hadn't helped any, but his head seemed to be knitting a little, and his legs were a little steadier. True, he didn't feel one hundred per cent healthy, but he was beginning to think he might live, after all. And while the doctor was bandaging his head a spirit of new life began to fill the FBI agent.  He was no longer morose and undirected. He had a purpose in life, and that purpose filled him with cold determination. He was going to find the robot-operated car--or whatever it turned out to be.  The doctor, Malone noticed, was whistling \"Greensleaves\" under his breath as he worked. That, he supposed, was the influence of the bohemian folk singers of Greenwich Village. But he put the noise resolutely out of his mind and concentrated on the red Cadillac.  It was one thing to think about a robot car, miles away, doing something or other to somebody you'd never heard of before. That was just theoretical, a case for solution, nothing but an ordinary job.  But when the car stepped up and bopped Malone himself on the head, it became a personal matter. Now Malone had more than a job to contend with. Now he was thinking about revenge.  He told himself: _No car in the world--not even a Cadillac--can get away with beaning Kenneth J. Malone!_  Malone was not quite certain that he agreed with Burris' idea of a self-operating car, but at least it was something to work on. A car that could reach out, crown an investigator and then drive off humming something innocent under its breath was certainly a unique and dangerous machine within the meaning of the act. Of course, there were problems attendant on this view of things; for one thing, Malone couldn't quite see how the car could have beaned him when he was ten feet away from it. But that was, he told himself uncomfortably, a minor point. He could deal with it when he felt a little better.  The important thing was the car itself. Malone jerked a little under the doctors calm hands, and swore subvocally.  \"Hold still,\" the doctor said. \"Don't go wiggling your head around that way. Just wait quietly until the demijel sets.\"  Obediently, Malone froze. There was a crick in his neck, but he decided he could stand it. \"My head still hurts,\" he said accusingly.  \"Sure it still hurts,\" the doctor agreed.  \"But you--\"  \"What did you expect?\" the doctor said. \"Even an FBI agent isn't immune to blackjacks, you know.\" He resumed his work on Malone's skull.  \"Blackjacks?\" Malone said. \"What blackjacks?\"  \"The ones that hit you,\" the doctor said. \"Or the one, anyhow.\"  Malone blinked. Somehow, though he could manage a fuzzy picture of a car reaching out to hit him, the introduction of a blackjack into this imaginative effort confused things a little. But he resolutely ignored it.  [Illustration]  \"The bruise is just the right size and shape,\" the doctor said. \"And that cut on your head comes from the seams on the leather casing.\"  \"You're sure?\" Malone said doubtfully."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24444"],["title","Out Like a Light (#5)"],["body"," did seem as if a car had a lot more dangerous weapons around, without resorting to blackjacks. If it had really wanted to damage him, why hadn't it hit him with the engine block?  \"I'm sure,\" the doctor said. \"I've worked in Emergency in this hospital long enough to recognize a blackjack wound.\"  That was a disturbing idea, in a way. It gave a new color to Malone's reflection on Greenwich Villagers. Maybe things had changed since he'd heard about them. Maybe the blackjack had supplanted the guitar. But that wasn't the important thing.  The fact that it had been a blackjack that had hit him was important. It was vital, as a matter of fact. Malone knew that perfectly well. It was a key fact in the case he was investigating.  The only trouble was that he didn't see what, if anything, it meant.  The doctor stepped back and regarded Malone's head with something like pride. \"There,\" he said. \"You'll be all right now.\"  \"When?\" Malone said.  \"You're not badly hurt,\" the doctor said reprovingly. \"You've got a slight concussion, that's all.\"  \"A concussion?\"  \"Sure,\" the doctor said. \"But it isn't serious. Just take these pills--one every two hours until they're gone--and you'll be rid of any effects within twenty-four hours.\" He went to a cabinet, fiddled around for a minute and came back with a small bottle containing six orange pills. They looked very large and threatening.  \"Fine,\" Malone said doubtfully.  \"You'll be all right,\" the doctor said, giving Malone a cheerful, confident grin. \"Nothing at all to worry about.\" He loaded a hypojet and blasted something through the skin of Malone's upper arm. Malone swallowed hard. He knew perfectly well that he hadn't felt a thing, but he couldn't quite make himself believe it.  \"That'll take care of you for tonight,\" the doctor said. \"Get some sleep and start in on the pills when you wake up, O.K.?\"  \"O.K.,\" Malone said. It was going to make waking up something less than a pleasure, but he wanted to get well, didn't he?  Of course he did. If that Cadillac thought it was going to beat him....  \"You can stand up now,\" the doctor said.  \"O.K.,\" Malone said, trying it. \"Thanks, doctor. I--\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a knock at the door. The doctor jerked his head around.  \"Who's that?\" he said.  \"Me,\" a bass voice said, unhelpfully.  The Emergency Room door opened a crack and a face peered in. It took Malone a second to recognize Bill, the waffle-faced cop who had picked him up next to the lamp post three years or so before. \"Long time no see,\" Malone said at random.  \"What?\" Bill said, and opened the door wider. He came in and closed it behind him. \"It's O.K., Doc,\" he said to the attendant. \"I'm a cop.\"  \"Been hurt?\" the doctor said.  Bill shook his head. \"Not recently,\" he said. \"I came to see this guy.\" He looked at Malone. \"They told me you were still here,\" he said.  \"Who's they?\" Malone said.  \"Outside,\" Bill said. \"The attendants out there. They said you were still getting stitched up.\"  \"And quite right, too,\" Malone said solemnly.  \"Oh,\" Bill said. \"Sure.\" He fished in his pockets. \"You dropped your notebook, though, and I came to give it back to you.\" He located the object he was hunting for and brought it out with the triumphant gesture of a man displaying the head of a dragon he has slain. \"Here,\" he said, waving the book.  \"Notebook?\" Malone said. He stared at it. It was a small looseleaf book bound in cheap black plastic.  \"We found it in the gutter,\" Bill said.  Malone took a tentative step forward and managed not to fall. He stepped back again and looked at Bill scornfully. \"I wasn't even in the gutter,\" he said. \"There are limits.\"  \"Sure,\" Bill said. \"But the notebook was, so I brought it along to you. I thought you might need it or something.\" He handed it over to Malone with a flourish.  It wasn't Malone's notebook. In the first place, he had never owned a notebook that looked anything like that, and in the second place he hadn't had any notebooks on him when he went for his walk. _Mine not to question why_, Malone told himself with a shrug, and flipped the book open.  At once he knew why the cop had mistaken it for his.  There, right on the first page, was a carefully detailed drawing of a 1972 Cadillac. It had been painstakingly colored in with a red pencil.  Malone stared at it for a second, and then went on to page two. This page carried a list of names running down the left margin.       _Ramon O.       Mario G.       Silvo E.       Felipe A.       Alvarez la B.       Juan de los S.       Ray del E._  That made sense, of a kind. It was a list of names. Whose names they were, Malone didn't know; but at least he could see the list and understand it. What puzzled him were the decorations.  Following each name was a queer-looking squiggle. Each was slightly different, and each bore some resemblance to a stick-figure, a geometrical figure or just a childish scrawl. The whole parade reminded Malone of pictures he had seen of Egyptian hieroglyphics.  But the names didn't look Egyptian, and, anyhow, nobody used hieroglyphics any more--did they?  Malone found himself thinking: _Now what does that mean?_ He looked across at the facing page.  It contained a set of figures, all marked off in dollars and cents and all added up neatly. One of the additions ended with the eye-popping sum of $52,710.09, and Malone found that the sum made him slightly nervous. This was high-powered figuring.         *       *       *       *       *  On to page three, he told himself. Drawings again, both on that page and on the one facing it. Malone recognized an outboard motor, a store-front, a suit of clothing hanging neatly on a hanger, a motor scooter, a shotgun and an IBM Electrotyper. Whoever had done the work was a reasonably accurate artist, if untrained; the various items were easily recognizable and Malone could see a great deal of detail.  That, of course, was fine. Only it made no more sense than the rest of the notebook.  Malone riffled through a few more pages, trying to make sense of the contents. One page seemed to be a shopping list, with nothing more revealing on it than _bread, bacon, eggs (1/2 doz.), peaches (frz.), cigs., & ltr., fluid_.  There was another list, farther on. This one said: _Hist. 2, Eng. 4, Math. 3, Span. 2. What for Elec.?_  That cast the first glow of light. Whoever owned the notebook was a student. Or a teacher, Malone thought; then, looking back at the handwriting, he decided that the owner of the notebook had to be in high school, certainly no farther along.  He went on flipping pages. One of them said, in large black capitals: =_HE'S BLUFFING!_=  A note passed in class? There was not any way of making sure.  Malone thought about the hypothetical student for a minute. Then something in the riffling pages caught his eye.  There were two names on the page he'd stopped at.  The first was: _Lt. Peter Lynch, NYPD._ It was followed by two little squiggles.  The second was: _Mr. Kenneth J. Malone, FBI._  There were no squiggles after his own name, and Malone felt oddly thankful for that, without knowing exactly why. But what did the names mean? And who had--  \"Uh ... Mr. Malone--\" Bill said tentatively. \"That _is_ your notebook, isn't it?\"  \"Oh,\" Malone said. He looked up at the cop and put on his most ingratiating smile. \"Sure,\" he said. \"It's mine. Sure it is. Just checking to see if I'd lost any pages. Not good. Losing pages out of a notebook. Never. Have to check, you know. Procedure. Very secret.\"  \"Sure,\" Bill said uncertainly.  Malone took a deep breath. \"Thought I'd lost the notebook,\" he said. \"I appreciate your returning it.\"  \"Oh,\" Bill said, \"that's O.K., Mr. Malone. Glad to do it.\"  \"You don't know what this means to me,\" Malone said truthfully.  \"No trouble at all,\" Bill said. \"Any time.\" He gave Malone a big smile and turned back to the door. \"But I got to get back to my beat,\" he said. \"Listen, I'll see you. And if I can be any help--\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"I'll let you know. And thanks again.\"  \"Welcome,\" Bill said, and opened the door. He strode out with the air of a man who has just been decorated with the Silver Star, the Purple Heart and the Congressional Medal of Honor.  Malone tried a few more steps and discovered that he could walk without falling down. He thanked the doctor again.  \"Perfectly all right,\" the doctor said. \"Nothing to it. Why, you ought to see some of the cases we get here. There was a guy here the other night with both his legs all mashed up by a--\"  \"I'll bet,\" Malone said hurriedly. \"Well, I've got to be on my way. Just send the bill to FBI Headquarters on Sixty-ninth Street.\" He closed the door on the doctor's enthusiastic: \"Yes, _sir_!\" and went on down the hallway and out into the street. At Seventh Avenue and Greenwich Avenue he flagged a cab.  What a place to be, Malone thought as the cab drove away. Where but in Greenwich Village did avenues intersect each other without so much as a by-your-leave?  \"Statler-Hilton Hotel,\" he said, giving the whole thing up as a bad job. He put his hat on his head and adjusted it painfully to the proper angle.  And that, he thought, made another little problem. The car had not only hit him on the head; it had removed his hat before doing so, and then replaced it. It had only fallen off when he'd started to get up against the lamp post.  _A nice quiet vacation_, Malone thought bitterly.  He fumed in silence all the way to the hotel, through the lobby, up in the elevator and to the door of his room. Then he remembered the notebook.  That was important evidence. He decided to tell Boyd about it right away.  He went into the bathroom and tapped gently on the door to Boyd's connecting room. The door swung open.  Boyd, apparently, was still out painting the town--Malone considered the word _red_ and dropped the whole phrase with a sigh. At any rate, his partner was nowhere in the room. He went back into his own room, closed the door and got"]]]
