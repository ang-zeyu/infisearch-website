I was working in the factory to earn enough money to take me back to Navarre, to my poor old mother, who has no support in the world but me, besides her little _barratcea_* with twenty cider-apple trees in it. Ah! if I were only back in my own country, looking up at the white mountains! I have been insulted here, because I don’t belong to this land of rogues and sellers of rotten oranges; and those hussies are all banded together against me, because I told them that not all their Seville _jacques_,** and all their knives, would frighten an honest lad from our country, with his blue cap and his _maquila_! Good comrade, won’t you do anything to help your own countrywoman?’       * Field, garden.       ** Bravos, boasters.  “She was lying then, sir, as she has always lied. I don’t know that that girl ever spoke a word of truth in her life, but when she did speak, I believed her--I couldn’t help myself. She mangled her Basque words, and I believed she came from Navarre. But her eyes and her mouth and her skin were enough to prove she was a gipsy. I was mad, I paid no more attention to anything, I thought to myself that if the Spaniards had dared to speak evil of my country, I would have slashed their faces just as she had slashed her comrade’s. In short, I was like a drunken man, I was beginning to say foolish things, and I was very near doing them.  “‘If I were to give you a push and you tumbled down, good fellow-countryman,’ she began again in Basque, ‘those two Castilian recruits wouldn’t be able to keep me back.’  “Faith, I forgot my orders, I forgot everything, and I said to her, ‘Well, then, my friend, girl of my country, try it, and may our Lady of the Mountain help you through.’  “Just at that moment we were passing one of the many narrow lanes one sees in Seville. All at once Carmen turned and struck me in the chest with her fist. I tumbled backward, purposely. With a bound she sprang over me, and ran off, showing us a pair of legs! People talk about a pair of Basque legs! but hers were far better--as fleet as they were well-turned. As for me, I picked myself up at once, but I stuck out my lance* crossways and barred the street, so that my comrades were checked at the very first moment of pursuit. Then I started to run myself, and they after me--but how were we to catch her? There was no fear of that, what with our spurs, our swords, and our lances.       * All Spanish cavalry soldiers carry lances.  “In less time than I have taken to tell you the story the prisoner had disappeared. And besides, every gossip in the quarter covered her flight, poked scorn at us, and pointed us in the wrong direction. After a good deal of marching and countermarching, we had to go back to the guard-room without a receipt from the governor of the jail.  “To avoid punishment, my men made known that Carmen had spoken to me in Basque; and to tell the truth, it did not seem very natural that a blow from such a little creature should have so easily overthrown a strong fellow like me. The whole thing looked suspicious, or, at all events, not over-clear. When I came off guard I lost my corporal’s stripes, and was condemned to a month’s imprisonment. It was the first time I had been punished since I had been in the service. Farewell, now, to the sergeant’s stripes, on which I had reckoned so surely!  “The first days in prison were very dreary. When I enlisted I had fancied I was sure to become an officer, at all events. Two of my compatriots, Longa and Mina, are captains-general, after all. Chapalangarra was a colonel, and I have played tennis a score of times with his brother, who was just a needy fellow like myself. ‘Now,’ I kept crying to myself, ‘all the time you served without being punished has been lost. Now you have a bad mark against your name, and to get yourself back into the officers’ good graces you’ll have to work ten times as hard as when you joined as a recruit.’ And why have I got myself punished? For the sake of a gipsy hussy, who made game of me, and who at this moment is busy thieving in some corner of the town. Yet I couldn’t help thinking about her. Will you believe it, sir, those silk stockings of hers with the holes in them, of which she had given me such a full view as she took to her heels, were always before my eyes? I used to look through the barred windows of the jail into the street, and among all the women who passed I never could see one to compare with that minx of a girl--and then, in spite of myself, I used to smell the acacia blossom she had thrown at me, and which, dry as it was, still kept its sweet scent. If there are such things as witches, that girl certainly was one.  “One day the jailer came in, and gave me an Alcala roll.*       * _Alcala de los Panaderos_, a village two leagues from      Seville, where the most delicious rolls are made. They are      said to owe their quality to the water of the place, and      great quantities of them are brought to Seville every day.  “‘Look here,’ said he, ‘this is what your cousin has sent you.’  “I took the loaf, very much astonished, for I had no cousin in Seville. It may be a mistake, thought I, as I looked at the roll, but it was so appetizing and smelt so good, that I made up my mind to eat it, without troubling my head as to whence it came, or for whom it was really intended.  “When I tried to cut it, my knife struck on something hard. I looked, and found a little English file, which had been slipped into the dough before the roll had been baked. The roll also contained a gold piece of two piastres. Then I had no further doubt--it was a present from Carmen. To people of her blood, liberty is everything, and they would set a town on fire to save themselves one day in prison. The girl was artful, indeed, and armed with that roll, I might have snapped my fingers at the jailers. In one hour, with that little file, I could have sawn through the thickest bar, and with the gold coin I could have exchanged my soldier’s cloak for civilian garb at the nearest shop. You may fancy that a man who has often taken the eaglets out of their nests in our cliff would have found no difficulty in getting down to the street out of a window less than thirty feet above it. But I didn’t choose to escape. I still had a soldier’s code of honour, and desertion appeared to me in the light of a heinous crime. Yet this proof of remembrance touched me. When a man is in prison he likes to think he has a friend outside who takes an interest in him. The gold coin did rather offend me; I should have very much liked to return it; but where was I to find my creditor? That did not seem a very easy task.  “After the ceremony of my degradation I had fancied my sufferings were over, but I had another humiliation before me. That came when I left prison, and was told off for duty, and put on sentry, as a private soldier. You can not conceive what a proud man endures at such a moment. I believe I would have just as soon been shot dead--then I should have marched alone at the head of my platoon, at all events; I should have felt I was somebody, with the eyes of others fixed upon me.  “I was posted as sentry on the door of the colonel’s house. The colonel was a young man, rich, good-natured, fond of amusing himself. All the young officers were there, and many civilians as well, besides ladies--actresses, as it was said. For my part, it seemed to me as if the whole town had agreed to meet at that door, in order to stare at me. Then up drove the colonel’s carriage, with his valet on the box. And who should I see get out of it, but the gipsy girl! She was dressed up, this time, to the eyes, togged out in golden ribbons--a spangled gown, blue shoes, all spangled too, flowers and gold lace all over her. In her hand she carried a tambourine. With her there were two other gipsy women, one young and one old. They always have one old woman who goes with them, and then an old man with a guitar, a gipsy too, to play alone, and also for their dances. You must know these gipsy girls are often sent for to private houses, to dance their special dance, the _Romalis_, and often, too, for quite other purposes.  “Carmen recognised me, and we exchanged glances. I don’t know why, but at that moment I should have liked to have been a hundred feet beneath the ground.  “‘_Agur laguna_,’ * said she. ‘Oficial mio! You keep guard like a recruit,’ and before I could find a word in answer, she was inside the house.       * Good-day, comrade!  “The whole party was assembled in the _patio_, and in spite of the crowd I could see nearly everything that went on through the lattice.* I could hear the castanets and the tambourine, the laughter and applause. Sometimes I caught a glimpse of her head as she bounded upward with her tambourine. Then I could hear the officers saying many things to her which brought the blood to my face. As to her answers, I knew nothing of them. It was on that day, I think, that I began to love her in earnest--for three or four times I was tempted to rush into the _patio_, and drive my sword into the bodies of all the coxcombs who were making love to her. My torture lasted a full hour; then the gipsies came out, and the carriage took them away. As she passed me by, Carmen looked at me with those eyes you know, and said to me very low, ‘Comrade, people who are fond of good _fritata_ come to eat it at Lillas Pastia’s at Triana!’       * In most of the houses in Seville there is an inner court      surrounded by an arched portico. This is used as a sitting-      room in summer. Over the court is stretched a piece of tent      cloth, which is watered during the day and removed at night.      The street door is almost "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2465"],["title","Carmen (#6)"],["body","left open, and the passage      leading to the court (_zaguan_) is closed by an iron lattice      of very elegant workmanship.  “Then, light as a kid, she stepped into the carriage, the coachman whipped up his mules, and the whole merry party departed, whither I know not.  “You may fancy that the moment I was off guard I went to Triana; but first of all I got myself shaved and brushed myself up as if I had been going on parade. She was living with Lillas Pastia, an old fried-fish seller, a gipsy, as black as a Moor, to whose house a great many civilians resorted to eat _fritata_, especially, I think, because Carmen had taken up her quarters there.  “‘Lillas,’ she said, as soon as she saw me. ‘I’m not going to work any more to-day. To-morrow will be a day, too.* Come, fellow-countryman, let us go for a walk!’       * _Manana sera otro dia._--A Spanish proverb.  “She pulled her mantilla across her nose, and there we were in the street, without my knowing in the least whither I was bound.  “‘Senorita,’ said I, ‘I think I have to thank you for a present I had while I was in prison. I’ve eaten the bread; the file will do for sharpening my lance, and I keep it in remembrance of you. But as for the money, here it is.’  “‘Why, he’s kept the money!’ she exclaimed, bursting out laughing. ‘But, after all, that’s all the better--for I’m decidedly hard up! What matter! The dog that runs never starves!* Come, let’s spend it all! You shall treat.’       * _Chuquel sos pirela, cocal terela_. “The dog that runs      finds a bone.”--Gipsy proverb.  “We had turned back toward Seville. At the entrance of the _Calle de la Serpiente_ she bought a dozen oranges, which she made me put into my handkerchief. A little farther on she bought a roll, a sausage, and a bottle of manzanilla. Then, last of all, she turned into a confectioner’s shop. There she threw the gold coin I had returned to her on the counter, with another she had in her pocket, and some small silver, and then she asked me for all the money I had. All I possessed was one peseta and a few cuartos, which I handed over to her, very much ashamed of not having more. I thought she would have carried away the whole shop. She took everything that was best and dearest, _yemas_,* _turon_,** preserved fruits--as long as the money lasted. And all these, too, I had to carry in paper bags. Perhaps you know the _Calle del Candilejo_, where there is a head of Don Pedro the Avenger.*** That head ought to have given me pause. We stopped at an old house in that street. She passed into the entry, and knocked at a door on the ground floor. It was opened by a gipsy, a thorough-paced servant of the devil. Carmen said a few words to her in Romany. At first the old hag grumbled. To smooth her down Carmen gave her a couple of oranges and a handful of sugar-plums, and let her have a taste of wine. Then she hung her cloak on her back, and led her to the door, which she fastened with a wooden bar. As soon as we were alone she began to laugh and caper like a lunatic, singing out, ‘You are my _rom_, I’m your _romi_.’****       * Sugared yolks of eggs.       ** A sort of nougat.       *** This king, Don Pedro, whom we call “the Cruel,” and whom      Queen Isabella, the Catholic, never called anything but “the      Avenger,” was fond of walking about the streets of Seville      at night in search of adventures, like the Caliph Haroun al      Raschid. One night, in a lonely street, he quarrelled with a      man who was singing a serenade. There was a fight, and the      king killed the amorous _caballero_. At the clashing of      their swords, an old woman put her head out of the window      and lighted up the scene with a tiny lamp (candilejo) which      she held in her hand. My readers must be informed that King      Don Pedro, though nimble and muscular, suffered from one      strange fault in his physical conformation. Whenever he      walked his knees cracked loudly. By this cracking the old      woman easily recognised him. The next day the _veintiquatro_      in charge came to make his report to the king. “Sir, a duel      was fought last night in such a street--one of the      combatants is dead.” “Have you found the murderer?” “Yes,      sir.” “Why has he not been punished already?” “Sir, I await      your orders!” “Carry out the law.” Now the king had just      published a decree that every duellist was to have his head      cut off, and that head was to be set up on the scene of the      fight. The _veintiquatro_ got out of the difficulty like a      clever man. He had the head sawed off a statue of the king,      and set that up in a niche in the middle of the street in      which the murder had taken place. The king and all the      Sevillians thought this a very good joke. The street took      its name from the lamp held by the old woman, the only      witness of the incident. The above is the popular tradition.      Zuniga tells the story somewhat differently. However that      may be, a street called _Calle del Candilejo_ still exists      in Seville, and in that street there is a bust which is said      to be a portrait of Don Pedro. This bust, unfortunately, is      a modern production. During the seventeenth century the old      one had become very much defaced, and the municipality had      it replaced by that now to be seen.       **** _Rom_, husband. _Romi_, wife.  “There I stood in the middle of the room, laden with all her purchases, and not knowing where I was to put them down. She tumbled them all onto the floor, and threw her arms round my neck, saying:  “‘I pay my debts, I pay my debts! That’s the law of the _Cales_.’*       * _Calo_, feminine _calli_, plural _cales_. Literally      “black,” the name the gipsies apply to themselves in their      own language.  “Ah, sir, that day! that day! When I think of it I forget what to-morrow must bring me!”  For a moment the bandit held his peace, then, when he had relighted his cigar, he began afresh.  “We spent the whole day together, eating, drinking, and so forth. When she had stuffed herself with sugar-plums, like any child of six years old, she thrust them by handfuls into the old woman’s water-jar. ‘That’ll make sherbet for her,’ she said. She smashed the _yemas_ by throwing them against the walls. ‘They’ll keep the flies from bothering us.’ There was no prank or wild frolic she didn’t indulge in. I told her I should have liked to see her dance, only there were no castanets to be had. Instantly she seized the old woman’s only earthenware plate, smashed it up, and there she was dancing the _Romalis_, and making the bits of broken crockery rattle as well as if they had been ebony and ivory castanets. That girl was good company, I can tell you! Evening fell, and I heard the drums beating tattoo.  “‘I must get back to quarters for roll-call,’ I said.  “‘To quarters!’ she answered, with a look of scorn. ‘Are you a negro slave, to let yourself be driven with a ramrod like that! You are as silly as a canary bird. Your dress suits your nature.* Pshaw! you’ve no more heart than a chicken.’  * Spanish dragoons wear a yellow uniform.  “I stayed on, making up my mind to the inevitable guard-room. The next morning the first suggestion of parting came from her.  “‘Hark ye, Joseito,’ she said. ‘Have I paid you? By our law, I owed you nothing, because you’re a _payllo_. But you’re a good-looking fellow, and I took a fancy to you. Now we’re quits. Good-day!’  “I asked her when I should see her again.  “‘When you’re less of a simpleton,’ she retorted, with a laugh. Then, in a more serious tone, ‘Do you know, my son, I really believe I love you a little; but that can’t last! The dog and the wolf can’t agree for long. Perhaps if you turned gipsy, I might care to be your _romi_. But that’s all nonsense, such things aren’t possible. Pshaw! my boy. Believe me, you’re well out of it. You’ve come across the devil--he isn’t always black--and you’ve not had your neck wrung. I wear a woollen suit, but I’m no sheep.* Go and burn a candle to your _majari_,** she deserves it well. Come, good-by once more. Don’t think any more about _La Carmencita_, or she’ll end by making you marry a widow with wooden legs.’***       * _Me dicas vriarda de jorpoy, bus ne sino braco_.--A gipsy      proverb.       ** The Saint, the Holy Virgin.       *** The gallows, which is the widow of the last man hanged      upon it.  “As she spoke, she drew back the bar that closed the door, and once we were out in the street she wrapped her mantilla about her, and turned on her heel.  “She spoke the truth. I should have done far better never to think of her again. But after that day in the _Calle del Candilejo_ I couldn’t think of anything else. All day long I used to walk about, hoping I might meet her. I sought news of her from the old hag, and from the fried-fish seller. They both told me she had gone away to _Laloro_, which is their name for Portugal. They probably said it by Carmen’s orders, but I soon found out they were lying. Some weeks after my day in the _Calle del Candilejo_ I was on duty at one of the town gates. A little way from the gate there was a breach in the wall. The masons were working at it in the daytime, and at night a sentinel was posted on it, to prevent smugglers from getting in. All through one day I saw Lillas Pastia going backward and forward near the guard-room, and talking to some of my comrades. They all knew him well, and his fried-fish and fritters even better. He came up to me, and asked if I had any news of Carmen.  “‘No,’ said I.  “‘Well,’ said he, ‘you’ll soon hear of her, old fellow.’  “He was not mistaken. That night I was posted to guard the breach in the wall. As soon as the sergeant had disappeared I saw a woman coming toward me. My heart told me it was Carmen. Still I shouted:  “‘Keep off! Nobody can pass here!’  “‘Now, don’t be spiteful,’ she said, making herself known to me.  “‘What! you here, Carmen?’  “‘Yes, _mi payllo_. Let us say "]]]
