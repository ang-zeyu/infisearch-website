Suddenly, with no warning whatever, the Nipe chopped at Valichek's throat with an open-hand judo cut, killing him. He killed two more men before he leaped out of the window and vanished.  \"No trace of him was found until late last night. He killed another man in Leningrad--we have since discovered that it was for the purpose of stealing his personal flyer. The Nipe could be anywhere on Earth by now.\"  \"How was the man killed, Mr. President? With bare hands, as the others were?\"  \"We have no way of knowing. Identification of the body was made difficult by the fact that every shred of flesh had been stripped away. It had been gnawed--literally _eaten_--to the bone!\"     _FIRST INTERLUDE_   The big man with the tiny child on his shoulder pushed through the air curtain that kept the warm humid air out of the shop.  \"There,\" he said to the little boy softly, turning his head to look up into the round, chubby, smiling face. \"There. Isn't that nicer, huh? Isn't that better than that hot old air outside?\"  \"Gleefle-ah,\" said the child with a grin.  \"Oh, come on, boy. I've heard you manage bigger words than that. Or is it your brother?\" He chuckled and headed toward the drug counter.  \"Hey, Jim!\"  The big man brought himself up short and turned--carefully, so as not to jiggle the baby on his shoulder. When he saw the shorter, thinner man, he grinned hugely. \"Jinks! By God! Jinks! Watch it! Don't shake the hand too hard or I'll drop this infant. God damn, man, I thought you were in Siberia!\"  \"I was, Jim, but a man can't stay in Siberia forever. Is that minuscule lump of humanity your own?\"  \"Yup, yup. So I've been led to believe. Say hello to your Uncle Jinks, young 'un. C'mon, say hello.\"  The child jammed the three fingers of his left hand into his mouth and refused to say a word. His eyes widened with an unfathomable baby-emotion.  \"Well, he's got your eyes,\" said the thinner man. \"Fortunately, he's going to look like his mother instead of being ugly. He _is_ a he, isn't he?\"  \"That's right. Mother's looks, father's plumbing. I got another just like him, but his mother's taking the other one to the doctor to get rid of the sniffles. Don't want this one to catch it.\"  \"Twins?\"  \"Naw,\" said the big man sarcastically, \"Octuplets. The Government took seventy-five percent for taxes.\"  \"Ask a silly question, get a silly answer,\" the smaller man said philosophically.  \"Yup. So how's the Great Northern Wasteland, Jinks?\"  \"Cold,\" said Jinks, \"but it's not going to be a wasteland much longer, Jim. Those Martian trees are going to be a big business in fifteen years. There'll be forests all over the tundra. They'll make a hell of a fine income crop for those people. We've put in over five thousand square miles in seedlings during the past five years. The first ones will be ready to harvest in ten years, and from then on, it will be as regular as clockwork.\"  \"That's great. Great. How long'll you be in town, Jinks?\"  \"About a week. Then I've got to head back to Siberia.\"  \"Well, look, could you drop around some evening? We could kill off a few bottles of beer after we eat one of Ellen's dinners. How about it?\"  \"I'd love to. Sure Ellen won't mind?\"  \"She'll be tickled pink to see you. How about Wednesday?\"  \"Sure. I'm free Wednesday evening. But you ask Ellen first. I'll give you a call tomorrow evening to make sure I won't get a chair thrown at me when I come in the door.\"  \"Great! I'll let her do the inviting, then.\"  \"Look,\" Jinks said, \"I've got half an hour or so right now. Let me buy you a beer. Or don't you want to take the baby in?\"  \"No, it's not that, but I've got to run. I just dropped in to get a couple of things, then I have to get on out to the plant. Some piddling little thing came up, and they want to talk to me about it.\" He patted the baby's leg. \"Nothing personal, pal,\" he said in a soft aside.  \"You taking the baby into an atomic synthesis plant?\" Jinks asked.  \"Why not? It's safe as houses. You've still got the Holocaust Jitters, my friend. He'll be safer there than at home. Besides, I can't just leave him in a locker, can I?\"  \"I guess not. Just don't let him get his genes irradiated,\" Jinks said, grinning. \"So long. I'll call tomorrow at twenty hundred.\"  \"Fine. See you then. So long.\"  The big man adjusted the load on his shoulder and went on toward the counter.     _[5]_   Two-fifths of a second. That was all the time Bart Stanton had from the first moment his supersensitive ears heard the first faint whisper of metal against leather.  He made good use of the time.  The noise had come from behind and slightly to the left of him, so he drew his left-hand weapon and spun to the left as he dropped to a crouch. He had turned almost completely around, drawn his gun, and fired three shots before the other man had even leveled his own weapon.  The bullets from Stanton's gun made three round spots on the man's jacket, almost touching each other, and directly over the heart. The man blinked stupidly for a moment, looking down at the spots.  \"My God,\" he said softly.  Then he returned his own weapon slowly to its holster.  The big room was noisy. The three shots had merely added to the noise of the gunfire that rattled intermittently around the two men. And even that gunfire was only a part of the cacophony. The tortured molecules of the air in the room were so besieged by the beat of drums, the blare of trumpets, the crackle of lightning, the rumble of heavy machinery, the squawks and shrieks of horns and whistles, the rustle of autumn leaves, the machine-gun snap of popping popcorn, the clink and jingle of falling coins, and the yelps, bellows, howls, roars, snarls, grunts, bleats, moos, purrs, cackles, quacks, chirps, buzzes, and hisses of a myriad of animals, that each molecule would have thought that it was being shoved in a hundred thousand different directions at once if it had had a mind to think with.  The noise wasn't deafening, but it was certainly all-pervasive.  Bart Stanton had reholstered his own weapon and half opened his lips to speak when he heard another sound behind him.  Again he whirled, his guns in his hands--both of them this time--and his forefingers only fractions of a millimeter from the point that would fire the hair triggers.  But he did not fire.  The second man had merely shifted the weapons in his holsters and then dropped his hands away.  The noise, which had been flooding the room over the speaker system, died instantly.  Stanton shoved his guns back into place and rose from his crouch. \"Real cute,\" he said, grinning. \"I wasn't expecting that one.\"  The man he was facing smiled back. \"Well, Bart, perhaps we have proved our point. What do you think, Colonel?\" The last was addressed to the third man, who was still standing quietly, looking worried and surprised about the three spots on his jacket that had come from the special harmless projectiles in Stanton's gun.  Colonel Mannheim was four inches shorter than Stanton's five-ten, and was fifteen years older. But in spite of the differences, he would have laughed if anyone had told him five minutes before that he couldn't outdraw a man who was standing with his back turned.  His bright blue eyes, set deep beneath craggy brows in a tanned face, looked speculatively at the younger man.  \"Incredible,\" he said gently. \"Absolutely incredible.\" Then he looked at the other man, a lean civilian with mild blue eyes a shade lighter than his own. \"All right, Farnsworth; I'm convinced. You and your staff have quite literally created a superman. Anyone who can stand in a noise-filled room and hear a man draw a gun twenty feet behind him is incredible enough. The fact that he could and did outdraw and outshoot me after I had started--well, that's almost beyond comprehension.\"  He looked back at Bart Stanton. \"What's your opinion? Do you think you can handle the Nipe, Stanton?\"  Stanton paused imperceptibly before answering, while his ultrafast mind considered the problem before arriving at a decision. Just how much confidence should he show the colonel? Mannheim was a man with tremendous confidence in his own abilities, but who was nevertheless capable of recognizing that there were men who were his superiors in one field or another.  \"If I can't dispose of the Nipe,\" Stanton said, \"no one can.\"  Colonel Mannheim nodded slowly. \"I believe you're right,\" he said at last. His voice was firm with inner conviction. He shot a glance at Farnsworth. \"How about the second man?\"  Farnsworth shook his head. \"He'll never make it. In another two years we can put him into reasonable shape again, but his nervous system just couldn't stand the gaff.\"  \"Can we get another man ready in time?\"  \"Hardly. We can't just pick a man up off the street and turn him into a superman. Even if we could find another subject with Bart's genetic possibilities, it would take more time than we have to spare.\"  \"No way at all of cutting the time down?\"  \"This isn't magic, Colonel,\" Farnsworth said. \"You don't change a nobody into a physical and mental giant by saying _abracadabra_ or by teaching him how to pronounce _shazam_ properly.\"  \"I'm aware of that,\" said the colonel without rancor. \"It's just that I keep feeling that five years of work on Mr. Stanton should have taught you enough to be able to repeat the process in less time.\"  Farnsworth repeated the head-shaking. \"Human beings aren't machines, Colonel. They require time to heal, time to learn, time to integrate themselves. Remember that, in spite of our increased knowledge of anesthesia, antibiotics, viricides, and obstetrics, it still takes nine months to produce a baby. We're in the same position, if not more so. After all, we can't even allow for a premature delivery.\"  \"I know,\" said Mannheim.  \"Besides,\" Dr. Farnsworth continued, \"Stanton's body and nervous system are now close to the theoretical limit for human tissue. I'm afraid you don't realize"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24436"],["title","Anything You Can Do ... (#5)"],["body"," kind of mental stability and organization are required to handle the equipment he has now.\"  \"I'm sure I don't,\" Colonel Mannheim agreed. \"I doubt if anyone besides Stanton himself _really_ knows.\" He looked at Bart Stanton. \"That's it then, son. You're it. You're the only answer we've found so far. And the only answer visible in the foreseeable future to the problem posed by the Nipe.\"  The colonel's face seemed to darken. \"Ten years,\" he said in a low voice. \"Ten years that inhuman monster has been loose on Earth. He's become a legend. He's replaced Satan, the Bogeyman, Frankenstein's monster, and Mumbo Jumbo, Lord of the Congo, in the public mind. Read the newsfacs, watch the newscasts. Take a look at popular fiction. He's everywhere at once. He can do anything. He's taken on the attributes of the djinn, the vampire, the ghoul, the werewolf, and every other horror and hobgoblin that the mind of man has conjured up in the past half million years.\"  \"That's hardly surprising, Colonel,\" Bart Stanton said with a wry smile. \"If a human being had gone on a ten-year rampage of robbery and murder, showing himself as callously indifferent to human life and property as you and I would be to the life and property of a cockroach, and if, in addition, he proved impossible to catch, such a person would be looked upon as a demon too. And if you add to that the fact that the Nipe is _not_ human, that he is as frightening in appearance as he is in actions, what can you expect?\"  \"I agree,\" said Dr. Farnsworth. \"Look at Jack the Ripper and consider how he terrorized London a couple of centuries ago.\"  \"I know,\" said Colonel Mannheim. \"There have been human criminals whose actions could be described as 'inhuman', but the Nipe has some touches that few human criminals have thought of and almost none would have the capacity to execute. If he has time to spare, his victims become an annoying problem in identification when they're found. He leaves nothing but well-gnawed bones. And by 'time to spare', I mean twenty or thirty minutes. The damned monster has a very efficient digestive tract, if nothing else. He eats like a shrew.\"  \"And if he doesn't have time, he beats them to death,\" Bart Stanton said thoughtfully.  Colonel Mannheim frowned. \"Not exactly. According to the evidence--\"  Dr. Farnsworth interrupted him. \"Colonel, let's go into the lounge, shall we? Aside from the fact that standing around in an empty chamber like this isn't the most comfortable way to discuss the fate of mankind, this room is scheduled for other work.\"  Colonel Mannheim grinned, caught up by the touch of lightness that the biophysicist had injected into the conversation. \"Very well. I could do with some coffee, if you have some.\"  \"All you want,\" said Dr. Farnsworth, leading the way toward the door of the chamber and opening it. \"Or, if you'd prefer something with a little more power to it....\"  \"Thanks, no,\" said Mannheim. \"Coffee will do fine. How about you, Stanton?\"  Bart Stanton shook his head. \"I'd love to have some coffee, but I'll leave the alcohol alone. I'd just have the luck to be finishing a drink when our friend, the Nipe, popped in on us. And when I do meet him, I'm going to need every microsecond of reflex speed I can scrape up.\"  They walked down a soft-floored, warmly lit corridor to an elevator which whisked them up to the main level of the Neurophysical Institute Building.  Another corridor led them to a room that might have been the common room of one of the more exclusive men's clubs. There were soft chairs and shelves of books and reading tables and smoking stands, all quietly luxurious. There was no one in the room when the three men entered.  \"We can have some privacy here,\" Dr. Farnsworth said. \"None of the rest of the staff will come in until we're through.\"  He walked over to a table, where an urn of coffee radiated soft warmth. \"Cream and sugar over there on the tray,\" he said as he began to fill cups.  The cups were filled and the three men sat down in a triangle of chairs before any of them spoke again. Then Bart Stanton said:  \"I made the remark that if the Nipe doesn't have time to eat his victims he just beats them to death, and you started to say something, Colonel.\"  Colonel Mannheim took a sip from his cup before he spoke. \"Yes. I was going to say that, according to the evidence we have, he _always_ beats his victims to death, whether he manages to eat them or not.\"  \"Oh?\" Stanton looked thoughtful.  \"Oh, he's not cruel about it,\" the colonel said. \"He kills quickly and neatly. The thing is that he never, under any circumstances, uses any weapons except the weapons that nature gave him--hands or feet or claws or teeth. He never uses a gun or a knife or even a club. Dr. Yoritomo has some theories about that which I won't go into now. He'll tell you about them pretty soon.\"  Stanton thought about the Japanese scientist and smiled. \"I know. Dr. Yoritomo has threatened to tell me all kinds of theories.\"  \"And believe me he will,\" said Mannheim with a soft chuckle. He took another sip of his coffee and then looked up at Stanton. \"You've been through five years of hell, Mr. Stanton. In addition, you've been pretty much isolated here. Dr. Farnsworth, here, has tried to keep you informed, but, as I understand it, it has only been during the last few months that you've actually been able to absorb and retain information reliably. At least, that's the report I get. How do you feel about it?\"  Bart Stanton thought for a moment. It was true that he'd been out of touch with what had been going on outside the walls of the Neurophysical Institute for the past five years. In spite of the reading he'd done and the newscasts he'd watched and the TV tapes he'd seen, he still had no real feeling for the situation.  There had been long hazy periods during that five years. He had undergone extensive glandular and neural operations of great delicacy, many of which had resulted in what could have been agonizing pain without the use of suppressors. As a result of those operations, he possessed a biological engine that, for sheer driving power and nicety of control, surpassed any other known to exist or to have ever existed on Earth--with the possible exception of the Nipe. But those five years of rebuilding and retraining had left a gap in his life.  Several of the steps required to make the conversion from man to superman had resulted in temporary insanity; the wild, swinging imbalances of glandular secretions seeking a new balance, the erratic misfirings of neurons as they attempted to adjust to higher nerve-impulse velocities, and the sheer fatigue engendered by cells that were acting too rapidly for a lagging excretory system, all had contributed to periods of greater or lesser abnormality.  That he was sane now, there was no question. But there were holes in his memory that still had to be filled.  He admitted as much to Colonel Mannheim.  \"I see.\" The colonel rubbed one hand along the angle of his jaw, considering his next words. \"Can you give me, in your own words, a general summary of the type of thing the Nipe has been doing?\"  \"I think so,\" Stanton said.  His verbal summary was succinct and accurate. The loot that the Nipe had been stealing had, at first, seemed to be a hodgepodge of everything. It was unpredictable. Money, as such, he apparently had no use for. He had taken gold, silver, and platinum, but one raid for each of these elements had evidently been enough, with the exception of silver, which had required three raids over a period of four years. Since then, he hadn't touched silver again.  He hadn't yet tried for any of the radioactives except radium. He'd taken a full ounce of that in five raids, but hadn't attempted to get his hands on uranium, thorium, plutonium, or any of the other elements normally associated with atomic energy. Nor had he tried to steal any of the fusion materials--the heavy isotopes of hydrogen or any of the lithium isotopes. Beryllium had been taken, but whether there was any significance in the thefts or not, no one knew.  There was a pattern in the thefts and robberies, nonetheless. They had begun small and had increased. Scientific and technical instruments--oscilloscopes, X-ray generators, radar equipment, maser sets, dynostatic crystals, thermolight resonators, and so on--were stolen complete or gutted for various parts. After a while, he had gone on to bigger things--whole aircraft, with their crews, had vanished.  That he had not committed anywhere near all the crimes that had been attributed to him was certain; that he _had_ committed a great many of them was equally certain.  There was no doubt at all that his loot was being used to make instruments and devices of unknown kinds. He had used several of them on his raids. The one that could apparently phase out any electromagnetic frequency up to about a hundred thousand megacycles--including sixty-cycle power frequencies--was considered a particularly cute item. So was the gadget that reduced the tensile strength of concrete to about that of a good grade of marshmallow.  After he had been operating for a few years, there was no installation on Earth that could be considered Nipe-proof for more than a few minutes. He struck when and where he wanted and took whatever he needed.  It was manifestly impossible to guard against the Nipe, since no one knew what sort of loot might strike his fancy next, and there was therefore no way of knowing where or how he would hit next.  Nor could he ever be found after one of his raids. They were plotted and followed through with diabolical accuracy and thoroughness. He struck, looted, and vanished. And he wasn't seen again until his next strike.  Colonel Mannheim, who had carefully puffed a cigar alight and smoked it thoughtfully during Stanton's recitation, dropped the remains of the cigar into an ash receptacle. \"Accurate but incomplete,\" he said quietly. \"You must have made some guesses. I'd like"]]]
