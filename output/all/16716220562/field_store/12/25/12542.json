Envy is an incurable disease; jealousy makes blind, and the common saying is surely true, that none are so blind as those who will not see. But neither have I the least desire to hide or gloss over our real failings and shortcomings. Those who cannot rest on their own real merits and accept the blame for their undeniable demerits must not dare to challenge the judgment of the world. The Jew does dare it, and all he asks of his critics is fairness, impartiality, justice. What I have said to his praise and for his defense was intended solely to assist the fairminded reader in forming a just opinion of an agitation which in Europe embitters, cripples, and darkens thousands of lives, which, under better treatment, would be spent in contentment and general usefulness.  It is for this purpose only that I will briefly add two more traits of the Jews, equally valuable and undeniable. One is their charity; they care for their poor, their sick, their aged, if destitute, as the numerous institutions prove, found in every place where they dwell in sufficient number to maintain them. Ungrudgingly they assume the heavy burdens which this \"exclusiveness\" imposes upon them. Blame them for it who may; the right-minded will not, especially when assured that this feeling of pity is not the privilege of the well-to-do among them only. The working classes have always something to spare from their scanty earnings for \"Z'dakah,\" the religious term in common use for charity, which, significantly enough, in biblical Hebrew means \"justice.\" The idea that charity is an essential part of worship has been bred into them by long tradition, and continues to be regarded as such, wherever rabbinical Judaism survives in full force. From childhood every Jew knows the saying of Simon the Just, one of the last men of the Great Synagogue:--      \"The whole world rests on these three pillars;            Law, Worship, and Charity.\"  The other trait is their zeal in the education of their children.  One of the standard objections to the Hebrews is their \"forwardness\"; socially, it is a disagreeable and annoying fault, but otherwise a gift of no little value. Forwardness is the soul of all progress and advancement. Call it that, call it self-help, call it energy, call it self-reliance, call it by the popular name of wide-awakeness, and you transfigure the fault into a merit. How the Jew was able to preserve it in any one of its forms is one of the many miracles of his history, seeing that the world has left nothing untried to cast the Jews backward to the last depth of self-despair. An exhibition of his forwardness might be seen at the doors of the public schools in the lower districts of the city, notably at the time of admission of new pupils. The poorest of the Jewish fathers and mothers would be seen wrangling for the registration of their little ones, as if it were for their daily bread. And may this not also serve for a proof that the parents are willing to surrender their offspring to the influence of these schools, and see them thoroughly Americanized?         *       *       *       *       *  By these signs ye shall know the Jews, wherever ye find them; they may, therefore, be called racial. In every other respect they are neither better nor worse than other people of the corresponding stages of life. Every variety of character is found among them; virtue and vice are distributed among them. Let Americans not stigmatize them as \"undesirable immigrants,\" and close their hospitable gate upon them. They bring with them qualities which are an ample compensation for their defects, and their well-to-do brethren are not behindhand in seeing to it that they become no public burden. The American people have repeatedly shown the door to those who came hither for the purpose of preaching anti-Semitism, thereby publicly testifying that they would have none of that disgrace to our age. What exists of it in social life is not worth arguing against. It will and must disappear in a country, the civil order of which is based upon the principle of equal rights to all law-abiding citizens, to whatever race or religion they may belong. \"A fair field and no favor.\" This good old saying comprises all our demands.            *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24187"],["title","A Transmutation of Muddles (#0)"],["body","TRANSMUTATION  OF MUDDLES   _An experienced horse-trader, bargain-haggler,  and general swapper has a very special talent for  turning two headaches into one aspirin pill...._   By H. B. FYFE   Illustrated by Van Dongen   The rugged little stellar scout ship flared down to the surface of Kappa Orionis VII about a mile from the aboriginal village. The pilot, Lieutenant Eric Haruhiku, scorched an open field, but pointed out to Louis Mayne that he had been careful to disturb neither woodland nor shoreline.  \"The Kappans are touchy about those, Judge,\" he explained, \"They fish a lot, as you'd guess from all these shallow seas, and they pick fruit in the forests; but they don't farm much.\"  \"No use provoking trouble,\" Mayne approved. \"It's a long way from Rigel.\"  \"It's a longer way from Sol,\" said the pilot.  \"Don't I know, boy! If it weren't, I'd be just another retired space captain, quietly struggling with my ranch on Rigel IX. As it is, to get the grant, I had to remain on call as an arbitrator.\"  \"Somebody has to settle these things,\" said Haruhiku. \"There's not much law way out here, except what the Space Force can apply. Well, if you'll excuse me, sir, I'll have them get out the helicopter and take us over to the village.\"  \"Let me see that last message again, before you go,\" Mayne requested.  The pilot extracted a sheet from his clipboard and handed it to Mayne as he left. Mayne studied the text with little pleasure.  Terran Space Force headquarters on Rigel IX wished to inform him that the long awaited envoy from Terra to Kappa Orionis VII not only had arrived but had departed two days behind Mayne.  It was hoped, the communication continued, that nothing would interfere with the desired objective of coming to some friendly agreement with the Kappans that would permit Terran use of the planet as a base for spaceships. The envoy, of course, was prepared to offer trade inducements and various other forms of help to the semi-civilized natives. Mayne was requested to lay whatever groundwork he could.  _In my spare time, no doubt_, he reflected. _I'm to settle this silly business any way at all--as long as the natives get their way. But has anybody told the government about insurance companies? If it costs money or a lawsuit, will they back me up?_  He felt himself to be in a ridiculous dilemma. The Kappans were reported to have seized a Terran spaceship as it landed to trade. Naturally, the captain had squawked for help. He claimed he had crashed; his insurance company thought otherwise; the Kappans seemed to have some entirely different idea in mind. Mayne had been summoned into action to render a decision, after the rough and ready system of these settlements on the surface of Terra's sphere of explored space.  Regretfully, he made his way now to the cubbyhole allowed him on the cramped scout, where he changed to a more formal tunic of a bright blue he hoped would look impressive to native eyes. By the time he was ready, the helicopter was waiting. He and Haruhiku entered, and the crewman at the controls took off for the scene of the dispute.  Arriving over the village, they hovered a few minutes while Haruhiku studied the lay of the land. The lieutenant had been to this world before, long enough to pick up some of the language and customs, so Mayne was content to follow his advice about landing a little way off from a spaceship that towered outside the village.  They came down about a hundred yards away, between a rutted sort of road and a long hut covered by a curved, thatched roof.  \"They're expecting us,\" said Haruhiku, gesturing at the group before the hut.  It consisted of half a dozen humans and several of the Kappan natives. The latter, naturally, caught Mayne's eye first. The most imposing individual among them stood about five feet tall. The planet being of about the same mass as Terra, the Kappan probably weighed over two hundred and fifty pounds. He was a rugged biped with something saurian in his ancestry; for his skin was scaled, and bony plates grew into a low crown upon his long skull. His arms and legs were heavy and bowed, with joints obscured by thick muscles and loose skin. Mayne was struck by the fancy that the Kappan's color, a blend of brown and olive, was that of a small dragon who had achieved a good suntan. A yellow kilt was his main article of attire, although he wore a few decorations of polished bone.         *       *       *       *       *  One of the Terrans stepped forward. He wore a semimilitary uniform.  \"I suppose you're Louis Mayne?\" he asked.  \"Right,\" answered Mayne. \"You would be Captain Voorhis, of the _Gemsbok_?\"  [Illustration]  \"Check. This here is Eemakh. He's more or less chief of the village, or tribe, or whatever you wanna call it.\"  Mayne found his gaze sinking into catlike slits of jet in a pair of huge orange eyes shaded by massive brow ridges. The native made some statement in a clicking language that had a harsh, choppy rhythm.  \"He welcomes you to Kappa,\" Haruhiku interpreted. \"He hopes the gods will not be displeased.\"  \"What a warm welcome!\" commented Mayne. \"Have you been getting along that well, Captain Voorhis?\"  \"Just about,\" said the spacer. \"One of my boys knows a few words. Rest of the time, we make signs. I gotta admit they ain't been too unfriendly.\"  \"But they _have_ seized your ship?\"  \"You're damn' right! That insurance guy they sent out don't see it that way though.\"  \"Where is this representative of the Belt Insurance Company?\" asked Mayne.  \"Melin? His ship landed over on the other side of the village, about half a mile. He oughta be along soon. Must've seen you land.\"  Mayne wondered whether it were necessary to await the arrival of the insurance adjustor before asking any questions. To cover his hesitation, he turned to take his first good look at the hull of the _Gemsbok_.  \"What do they think they're doing?\" he demanded, staring.  The _Gemsbok_ was--or had been--an ungraceful, thick starship on the verge of aging into scrap. Towering here between the village and the huge, bluish-green leaves of the Kappan forest, she was in the process of being transformed into a planet-bound object of a certain weird grace.  A framework was being constructed about the hull by a swarm of natives. They had reached halfway up the ship, which served as a central column. Much of the exterior appeared to be a network of strangely curved sections of wood that had been given a high polish. Mayne suspected the greenish highlights were reflections of the forest color.  \"Bone,\" said Voorhis succinctly. \"They collect it from things they catch in the sea. Main supports of timber, of course, built to fit the hull.\"  \"The fish here grow very large,\" put in Haruhiku. \"If you could call them fish, that is. I once saw them butchering what looked more like a dinosaur.\"  Mayne realized that the bone framework formed a sort of curtain wall. At the lower levels, some of the natives seemed to be experimenting with a coating of wet leaves which they were molding to the wall.  \"They've soaked them in something they boil out of fish parts,\" his pilot explained. \"Like the village roofs. When it dries, it's pretty hard, even waterproof. The stink never dries out.\"  \"But what do they have in their bony little brains?\" asked Mayne. \"Just what is that mess supposed to be?\"  \"A temple, believe it or not,\" answered Voorhis. \"They tell me I set her down on land sacred to the great god Meeg!\"  Mayne looked at Haruhiku.  \"Oh, come on, now! I came all the way from--\" He stopped as he noticed the pilot's grave expression. \"Oh! That sort of thing _could_ be serious, I guess.\"  He imagined he had seen the chief, Eemakh, come alert at the mention of the local god. Mayne sighed. It was going to be a long day.  He was saved for the time being by a hail from the direction of the village. A procession was approaching along the set of ruts between Mayne and the ship.         *       *       *       *       *  The place of honor appeared to be occupied by a two-wheeled cart of crude but massive design. Upon it rode a Kappan driver, two Kappans with spears and the look of official guards, and a Terran with a death-grip upon the side railing. A brace of truculent beasts of frighteningly saurian mien shuffled ponderously along in the loose harness. From time to time, one or the other would stumble over a turn in his rut and emit a menacing rumble as if he suspected his team mate of causing the misstep.  Before and behind this conveyance marched a guard of honor of Kappan warriors. The rear contingent kept close to the cart, but the advance party had opened a noticeable gap between themselves and the hulking team.  The procession halted, the soldier in charge raised his spear in salute to Eemakh, and the shaken Terran was assisted to dismount. He introduced himself to Mayne as Robert Melin.  \"Let's go over to the hut they made for us an' sit down,\" suggested Voorhis.  Melin, a tall, gloomy blond whose civilian suit seemed a trifle formal for the surroundings, acceded gratefully. He mopped the dust from his long face and watched the cart being turned around.  The procession moved off in the direction of the village, the advance guard stepping out especially smartly, and Mayne began to get his conference arranged.  He learned that the evicted crew of the _Gemsbok_ had been living in the hut nearby. Before it stood a long table with benches, all evidently knocked together from recently felled timber. Melin was given credit for this by Voorhis, since before the arrival of the insurance adjuster and his crew, no power tools had been available to the men from the _Gemsbok_.  Mayne took a place at the end of the table. Some of the _Gemsbok's_ crew came out of the hut to watch. Most of the Kappan warriors attending the chief took up stations between the table and the ship, in a manner suggesting long habit. Mayne guessed that attempts had been made to re-enter the ship.  He put Haruhiku at his right"]]]
