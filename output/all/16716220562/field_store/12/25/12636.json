[Illustration: \"THE RUGGLESES NEVER FORGOT IT\"]  \"My dear child,\" whispered Uncle Jack, as he took Carol an orange, \"there is no doubt about the necessity of this feast, but I do advise you after this to have them twice a year, or quarterly perhaps, for the way these children eat is positively dangerous; I assure you I tremble for that terrible Peoria. I'm going to run races with her after dinner.\"  \"Never mind,\" laughed Carol; \"let them have enough for once; it does my heart good to see them, and they shall come oftener next year.\"  The feast being over, the Ruggleses lay back in their chairs languidly, like little gorged boa-constrictors, and the table was cleared in a trice. Then a door was opened into the next room, and there, in a corner facing Carol's bed, which had been wheeled as close as possible, stood the brilliantly lighted Christmas tree, glittering with gilded walnuts and tiny silver balloons, and wreathed with snowy chains of pop-corn. The presents had been bought mostly with Carol's story-money, and were selected after long consultations with Mrs. Bird. Each girl had a blue knitted hood, and each boy a red crocheted comforter, all made by Mamma, Carol, and Elfrida. (\"Because if you buy everything, it doesn't show so much love,\" said Carol.) Then every girl had a pretty plaid dress of a different color, and every boy a warm coat of the right size. Here the useful presents stopped, and they were quite enough; but Carol had pleaded to give them something \"for fun.\" \"I know they need the clothes,\" she had said, when they were talking over the matter just after Thanksgiving, \"but they don't care much for them, after all. Now, Papa, won't you _please_ let me go without part of my presents this year, and give me the money they would cost, to buy something to amuse the Ruggleses?\"  \"You can have both,\" said Mr. Bird, promptly; \"is there any need of my little girl's going without her own Christmas, I should like to know? Spend all the money you like.\"  \"But that isn't the thing,\" objected Carol, nestling close to her father; \"it wouldn't be mine. What is the use? Haven't I almost everything already, and am I not the happiest girl in the world this year, with Uncle Jack and Donald at home? You know very well it is more blessed to give than to receive; so why won't you let me do it? You never look half as happy when you are getting your presents as when you are giving us ours. Now, Papa, submit, or I shall have to be very firm and disagreeable with you!\"  \"Very well, your Highness, I surrender.\"  \"That's a dear Papa! Now what were you going to give me? Confess!\"  \"A bronze figure of Santa Claus; and in the 'little round belly that shakes when he laughs like a bowlful of jelly,' is a wonderful clock--oh, you would never give it up if you could see it!\"  \"Nonsense,\" laughed Carol; \"as I never have to get up to breakfast, nor go to bed, nor catch trains, I think my old clock will do very well! Now, Mamma, what were you going to give me?\"  \"Oh, I hadn't decided. A few more books, and a gold thimble, and a smelling-bottle, and a music-box, perhaps.\"  \"Poor Carol,\" laughed the child, merrily, \"she can afford to give up these lovely things, for there will still be left Uncle Jack, and Donald, and Paul, and Hugh, and Uncle Rob, and Aunt Elsie, and a dozen other people to fill her Christmas stocking!\"  So Carol had her way, as she generally did; but it was usually a good way, which was fortunate, under the circumstances; and Sarah Maud had a set of Miss Alcott's books, and Peter a modest silver watch, Cornelius a tool-chest, Clement a dog-house for his lame puppy, Larry a magnificent Noah's ark, and each of the younger girls a beautiful doll.  You can well believe that everybody was very merry and very thankful. All the family, from Mr. Bird down to the cook, said that they had never seen so much happiness in the space of three hours; but it had to end, as all things do. The candles flickered and went out, the tree was left alone with its gilded ornaments, and Mrs. Bird sent the children downstairs at half past eight, thinking that Carol looked tired.  \"Now, my darling, you have done quite enough for one day,\" said Mrs. Bird, getting Carol into her little nightgown. \"I'm afraid you will feel worse tomorrow, and that would be a sad ending to such a charming evening.\"  \"Oh, wasn't it a lovely, lovely time,\" sighed Carol. \"From first to last, everything was just right. I shall never forget Larry's face when he looked at the turkey; nor Peter's when he saw his watch; nor that sweet, sweet Kitty's smile when she kissed her dolly; nor the tears in poor, dull Sarah Maud's eyes when she thanked me for her books; nor\"--  \"But we mustn't talk any longer about it tonight,\" said Mrs. Bird, anxiously; \"you are too tired, dear.\"  \"I am not so very tired, Mamma. I have felt well all day; not a bit of pain anywhere. Perhaps this has done me good.\"  \"Perhaps; I hope so. There was no noise or confusion; it was just a merry time. Now, may I close the door and leave you alone, dear? Papa and I will steal in softly by and by to see if you are all right; but I think you need to be very quiet.\"  \"Oh, I'm willing to stay by myself; but I am not sleepy yet, and I am going to hear the music, you know.\"  \"Yes, I have opened the window a little, and put the screen in front of it, so that you won't feel the air.\"  \"Can I have the shutters open? and won't you turn my bed, please? This morning I woke ever so early, and one bright, beautiful star shone in that eastern window. I never noticed it before, and I thought of the Star in the East, that guided the wise men to the place where the baby Jesus was. Good-night, Mamma. Such a happy, happy day!\"  \"Good-night, my precious Christmas Carol--mother's blessed Christmas child.\"  \"Bend your head a minute, mother dear,\" whispered Carol, calling her mother back. \"Mamma, dear, I do think that we have kept Christ's birthday this time just as He would like it. Don't you?\"  \"I am sure of it,\" said Mrs. Bird, softly.  [Illustration]     VII  The Birdling Flies Away   The Ruggleses had finished a last romp in the library with Paul and Hugh, and Uncle Jack had taken them home and stayed a while to chat with Mrs. Ruggles, who opened the door for them, her face all aglow with excitement and delight. When Kitty and Clem showed her the oranges and nuts that they had kept for her, she astonished them by saying that at six o'clock Mrs. Bird had sent her in the finest dinner she had ever seen in her life; and not only that, but a piece of dress-goods that must have cost a dollar a yard if it cost a cent.  As Uncle Jack went down the rickety steps he looked back into the window for a last glimpse of the family, as the children gathered about their mother, showing their beautiful presents again and again,--and then upward to a window in the great house yonder. \"A little child shall lead them,\" he thought. \"Well, if--if anything ever happens to Carol, I will take the Ruggleses under my wing.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Softly, Uncle Jack,\" whispered the boys, as he walked into the library a while later. \"We are listening to the music in the church. The choir has sung 'Carol, brothers, carol,' and now we think the organist is beginning to play 'My ain countree' for Carol.\"  \"I hope she hears it,\" said Mrs. Bird; \"but they are very late to-night, and I dare not speak to her lest she should be asleep. It is almost ten o'clock.\"  The boy soprano, clad in white surplice, stood in the organ loft. The light shone full upon his crown of fair hair, and his pale face, with its serious blue eyes, looked paler than usual. Perhaps it was something in the tender thrill of the voice, or in the sweet words, but there were tears in many eyes both in the church and in the great house next door.      \"I am far frae my hame,       I am weary aften whiles     For the langed-for hame-bringin',       An' my Faether's welcome smiles     An' I'll ne'er be fu' content,       Until my e'en do see     The gowden gates o' heaven       In my ain countree.  [Illustration: \"MY AIN COUNTREE\"]      The earth is decked wi' flow'rs,       Mony tinted, fresh an' gay,     An' the birdies warble blythely,       For my Faether made them sae;     But these sights an' these soun's       Will as naething be to me,     When I hear the angels singin'       In my ain countree.      Like a bairn to its mither,       A wee birdie to its nest,     I fain would be gangin' noo       Unto my Faether's breast;     For He gathers in His arms       Helpless, worthless lambs like me,     An' carries them Himsel'       To his ain countree.\"  There were tears in many eyes, but not in Carol's. The loving heart had quietly ceased to beat, and the \"wee birdie\" in the great house had flown to its \"home nest.\" Carol had fallen asleep! But as to the song, I think perhaps, I cannot say, she heard it after all!         *       *       *       *       *  So sad an ending to a happy day! Perhaps--to those who were left; and yet Carol's mother, even in the freshness of her grief, was glad that her darling had slipped away on the loveliest day of her life, out of its glad content, into everlasting peace.  She was glad that she had gone as she had come, on the wings of song, when all the world was brimming over with joy; glad of every grateful smile, of every joyous burst of laughter, of every loving thought and word and deed the dear last day had brought.  Sadness reigned, it is true, in the little house behind the garden; and one day poor Sarah Maud, with a courage born of despair, threw on her hood and shawl, walked straight to a certain house a mile away, up the marble steps into good Dr. Bartol's office, falling at his feet as she cried, \"Oh, sir, it was me an' our children that went to Miss Carol's last dinner-party, an' if we made her worse we can't never be happy again!\" Then the kind old gentleman"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24286"],["title","The Birds' Christmas Carol (#7)"],["body","her rough hand in his and told her to dry her tears, for neither she nor any of her flock had hastened Carol's flight; indeed, he said that had it not been for the strong hopes and wishes that filled her tired heart, she could not have stayed long enough to keep that last merry Christmas with her dear ones.  And so the old years, fraught with memories, die, one after another, and the new years, bright with hopes, are born to take their places; but Carol lives again in every chime of Christmas bells that peal glad tidings, and in every Christmas anthem sung by childish voices.  [Illustration]     THE BIRDS' CHRISTMAS CAROL  [Dramatized Edition]  _By Kate Douglas Wiggin_   This beautiful story, which has been a home and school favorite for forty years, takes to itself new vividness and interest in Mrs. Wiggin's own dramatization.  In preparing this version, the author had in mind the limitations of the amateur and the time available for school theatricals. The book is so arranged that any single scene or the entire story may be staged with equal effect either with or without stage settings or costumes.  For the school, the home, or the amateur dramatic club this is an ideal play--simple, practical, thoroughly interesting, and always successful.  Books by Kate Douglas Wiggin  THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS.
