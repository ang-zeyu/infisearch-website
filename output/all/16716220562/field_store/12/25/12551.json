It is nothing, in the present relations of the States, but sentimental hypocrisy. It has no stamina--no back-bone. The argument for non-extension is an argument for the dissolution of the Union. With a glow of moral indignation, I protest against the promise and the pledge, by whomsoever made, that if the Slave Power will seek no more to lengthen its cords and strengthen its stakes, it may go unmolested end unchallenged, and survive as long as it can within its present limits. I would as soon turn pirate on the high seas as to give my consent to any such arrangement. I do not understand the moral code of those who, screaming in agony at the thought of Nebraska becoming a Slave Territory, virtually say to the South: \"Only desist from your present designs, and we will leave you to flog, and lacerate, and plunder, and destroy the millions of hapless wretches already within your grasp. If you will no longer agitate the subject, we will not.\" There is no sense, no principle, no force in such an issue. Not a solitary slaveholder will I allow to enjoy repose on any other condition than instantly ceasing to be one. Not a single slave will I leave in his chains, on any conditions, or under any circumstances. I will not try to make as good a bargain for the Lord as the Devil will let me, and plead the necessity of a compromise, and regret that I cannot do any better, and be thankful that I can do so much. The Scriptural injunction is to be obeyed: \"Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\" My motto is, \"No union with slaveholders, religiously or politically.\" Their motto is \"Slavery forever! No alliance with Abolitionists, either in Church or State!\" The issue is clear, explicit, determinate. The parties understand each other, and are drawn in battle array. They can never be reconciled--never walk together--never consent to a truce--never deal in honeyed phrases--never worship at the same altar--never acknowledge the same God. Between them there is an impassable gulf. In manners, in morals, in philosophy, in religion, in ideas of justice, in notions of law, in theories of government, in valuations or men, they are totally dissimilar.  I would to God that we might be, what we have never been--a united people; but God renders this possible only by \"proclaiming liberty throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof.\" By what miracle can Freedom and Slavery be made amicably to strike hands? How can they administer the same Government, or legislate for the same interests? How can they receive the same baptism, be admitted to the same communion-table, believe in the same Gospel, and obtain the same heavenly inheritance? \"I speak as unto wise men; judge ye.\" Certain propositions have long since been ceded to be plain, beyond contradiction. The apostolic inquiry has been regarded as equally admonitory and pertinent: \"What concord hath Christ with Belial? or what fellowship hath light with darkness?\" Fire and gunpowder, oil and water, cannot coalesce; but, assuredly, these are not more antagonistical than are the elements of Freedom and Slavery. The present American Union, therefore, is only one in form, not in reality. It is, and it always has been, the absolute supremacy of the Slave Power over the whole country--nothing more. What sectional heart-burnings or conflictive interests exist between the several Free States? None. They are homogeneous, animated by the same spirit, harmonious in their action as the movement of the spheres. It is only when we come to the dividing line between the Free States and the Slave States that shoals, breakers and whirlpools beset the ship of State, and threaten to engulf or strand it. Then the storm rages loud and long, and the ocean of popular feeling is lashed into fury.  While the present Union exists, I pronounce it hopeless to expect any repose, or that any barrier can be effectually raised against the extension of Slavery. With two thousand million dollars' worth of property in human flesh in its hands, to be watched and wielded as one vast interest for all the South--with forces never divided, and purposes never conflictive--with a spurious, negro-hating religion universally diffused, and everywhere ready to shield it from harm--with a selfish, sordid, divided North, long since bereft of its manhood, to cajole, bribe and intimidate--with its foot planted on two-thirds of our vast national domains, and there unquestioned, absolute and bloody in its sway--with the terrible strength and boundless resources of the whole country at its command--it cannot be otherwise than that the Slave Power will consummate its diabolical purposes to the uttermost. The Northwest Territory, Nebraska, Mexico, Cuba, Hayti, the Sandwich Islands, and colonial possessions in the tropics--to seize and subjugate these to its accursed reign, and ultimately to re-establish the foreign Slave Trade as a lawful commerce, are among its settled designs. It is not a question of probabilities, but of time. And whom will a just God hold responsible for all these results? All who despise and persecute men on account of their complexion; all who endorse a slaveholding religion as genuine; all who give the right hand of Christian fellowship to men whose hands are stained with the blood of the slave; all who regard material prosperity as paramount to moral integrity, and the law of the land as above the law of God; all who are either hostile or indifferent to the Anti-Slavery movement; and all who advocate the necessity of making compromises with the Slave Power, in order that the Union may receive no detriment.  In itself, Slavery has no resources and no strength. Isolated and alone, it could not stand an hour; and, therefore, further aggression and conquest would be impossible.  Says the Editor of the Marysville (Tenn.) _Intelligencer_, in an article on the character and condition of the slave population:      \"We of the South are emphatically surrounded by dangerous     class of beings--degraded, stupid savages--who, if they could     but once entertain the idea that immediate and unconditional     death would not be their portion, would re-enact the St.     Domingo tragedy. But the consciousness, with all their     stupidity, that a ten-fold force, superior in discipline, if     not in barbarity, would gather from the four corners of the     United States and slaughter them, keeps them in subjection.     _But, to the non-slaveholding States, particularly, we are     indebted for a permanent safeguard against insurrection._     Without their assistance, the while population of the South     would be too weak to quiet that insane desire for liberty     which is ever ready to act itself out with every rational     creature.\"  In the debate in Congress on the resolution to censure John Quincy Adams, for presenting a petition for the dissolution of the Union, Mr. Underwood, of Kentucky, said:      \"They (the South) were the weaker portion, were in the     minority. _The North could do what they pleased with them_;     they could adopt their own measures. All he asked was, that     they would let the South know what those measures were. One     thing he knew well; that State, which he in part represented,     had perhaps a deeper interest in this subject than any other,     except Maryland and a small portion of Virginia. And why?     Because he knew that to dissolve the Union, and separate the     different States composing the confederacy, making the Ohio     River and the Mason and Dixon's line the boundary line, _he     knew as soon as that was done, Slavery was done_ in Kentucky,     Maryland and a large portion of Virginia, and it would extend     to all the States South of this line. _The dissolution of the     Union was the dissolution of Slavery._ It has been the common     practice for Southern men to get up on this floor, and say,     'Touch this subject, and we will dissolve this Union as a     remedy.' _Their remedy was the destruction of the thing which     they wished to save_, and any sensible man could see it. If     the Union was dissolved into two parts, the slave would cross     the line, and then turn round and curse the master from the     other shore.\"  The declaration of Mr. Underwood as to the entire dependence of the slave masters on the citizens of the nominally Free States to guard their plantations, and secure them against desertion, is substantially confirmed by Thomas D. Arnold, of Tennessee, who, in a speech on the name subject, assures us that they are equally dependent on the North for _personal protection_ against their slaves. In assigning his reasons for adhering to the Union, Mr. Arnold makes use of the following language:      \"The Free States had a majority of 44 in that House. Under the     new census, they would have 53. The cause of the slaveholding     States was getting weaker and weaker, and what were they to     do? He would ask his Southern friends what the South had to     rely on, if the Union were dissolved? Suppose the dissolution     could be peaceably effected (if that did not involve a     contradiction in terms), what had the South to depend upon?     _All the crowned heads were against her. A million of slaves     were ready to rise and strike for freedom at the first tap of     the drum._ If they were cut loose from their friends at the     North (friends that ought to be, and without them, the South     had no friends), _whither were they to look for protection_?     How were they to sustain an assault from England or France,     with the cancer at their vitals? The more the South reflected,     the more clearly she must see that she has a deep and vital     interest in maintaining the Union.\"  These witnesses can neither be impeached nor ruled out of Court, and their testimony is true. While, therefore, the Union is preserved, I see no end to the extension or perpetuity"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24194"],["title","No Compromise with Slavery (#5)"],["body"," Chattel Slavery--no hope for peaceful deliverance of the millions who are clanking their chains on our blood-red soil. Yet I know that God reigns, and that the slave system contains within itself the elements of destruction. But how long it is to curse the earth, and desecrate his image, he alone foresees. It is frightful to think of the capacity of a nation like this to commit sin, before the measure of its iniquities be filled, and the exterminating judgments of God overtake it. For what is left us but \"a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation\"? Or is God but a phantom, and the Eternal Law but a figment of the imagination? Has an everlasting divorce been effected between cause and effect, and is it an absurd doctrine that, as a nation sows, so shall it also reap? \"Wherefore, hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men that rule this people: Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves: Therefore, thus saith the Lord God, Judgment will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place: And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.\"  These are solemn times. It is not a struggle for national salvation; for the nation, as such, seems doomed beyond recovery. The reason why the South rules, and North falls prostrate in servile terror, is simply this: With the South, the preservation of Slavery is paramount to all other considerations--above party success, denominational unity, pecuniary interest, legal integrity, and constitutional obligation. With the North, the preservation of the Union is placed above all other things--above honour, justice, freedom, integrity of soul, the Decalogue and the Golden Rule--the Infinite God himself. All these she is ready to discard for the Union. Her devotion to it is the latest and the most terrible form of idolatry. She has given to the Slave Power a _carte blanche_, to be filled as it may dictate--and if, at any time, she grows restive under the yoke, and shrinks back aghast at the new atrocity contemplated, it is only necessary for that Power to crack the whip of Disunion over her head, as it has done again and again, and she will cower and obey like a plantation slave--for has she not sworn that she will sacrifice everything in heaven and on earth, rather than the Union?  What then is to be done? Friends of the slave, the question is not whether by our efforts we can abolish Slavery, speedily or remotely--for duty is ours, the result is with God; but whether we will go with the multitude to do evil, sell our birthright for a mess of pottage, cease to cry aloud and spare not, and remain in Babylon when the command of God is, \"Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\" Let us stand in our lot, \"and having done all, to stand.\" At least, a remnant shall be saved. Living or dying, defeated or victorious, be it ours to exclaim, \"No compromise with Slavery! Liberty for each, for all, forever! Man above all institutions! The supremacy of God over the whole earth!\"         *       *       *       *       *      +-----------------------------------------------------------+     | Typographical errors corrected in text:                   |     |                                                           |     | Page  7: Eurpean replaced with European                   |     | Page  9: justication replaced with justification          |     | Page 26: appaling replaced with appalling                 |     |                                                           |     | On page 16 there is a partially blocked word in the       |     | scanned image.
