For instance, we read of the Apostles, that \"Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers.  And He saith unto them, Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.  _And they straightway_ left their nets and followed Him[4].\"  Again; when He saw James and John with their father Zebedee, \"He _called_ them; and they _immediately left the ship, and their father_, and _followed_ Him.\"  And so of St. Matthew at the receipt of custom, \"He said unto him, Follow Me, and he left all, rose up, and followed Him.\"  Again, we are told in St. John's Gospel, \"Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto Him, _Follow_ Me.\"  Again, \"Philip findeth Nathanael,\" and in like manner says to him, \"Come and see.\"  \"Jesus saw Nathanael coming unto Him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.\"  On the other hand, the young ruler shrunk from the call, and found it a hard saying, \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, and follow Me.  But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions[5].\"  Others who seemed to waver, or rather who asked for some little delay from human feeling, were rebuked for want of promptitude in their obedience;--for time stays for no one; the word of call is spoken and is gone; if we do not seize the moment, it is lost.  Christ was on His road heavenward.  He walked by the sea of Galilee[6]; He \"passed forth[7];\" He \"passed by[8];\" He did not stop; all men must join Him, or He would be calling on others beyond them[9].  \"He said to another, Follow Me.  But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.  And another also said, Lord, I will follow Thee: but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.  And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God[10].\"  Not unlike these last instances are the circumstances of the call of the great prophet Elisha, though he does not seem to have incurred blame from Elijah for his lingering on the thoughts of what he was leaving.  \"He found Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing . . . Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle over him.\"  He did not stay; he passed on, and Elisha was obliged to run after him.  \"And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.\"  This the prophet allowed him to do, and after that \"he arose and followed Elijah, and ministered unto him.\"  Or once more consider the circumstances of the call of Abraham, the father of all who believe.  He was called from his father's house, but was not told whither.  St. Paul was bid go to Damascus, and there he was to receive further directions.  In like manner Abraham left his home for a land \"that I _will_ show thee[11],\" says Almighty God. Accordingly he went out, \"not knowing whither he went.\"  \"Abram [Transcriber's note: Abraham?] departed as the Lord had spoken unto him.\"  Such are the instances of Divine calls in Scripture, and their characteristic is this; to require instant obedience, and next to call us we know not to what; to call us on in the darkness.  Faith alone can obey them.  But it may be urged, How does this concern us now?  We were all called to serve God in infancy, before we could obey or disobey; we found ourselves called when reason began to dawn; we have been called to a state of salvation, we have been living as God's servants and children, all through our time of trial, having been brought into it in infancy through Holy Baptism, by the act of our parents.  Calling is not a thing future with us, but a thing past.  This is true in a very sufficient sense; and yet it is true also that the passages of Scripture which I have been quoting do apply to us still,--do concern us, and may warn and guide us in many important ways; as a few words will show.  For in truth we are not called once only, but many times; all through our life Christ is calling us.  He called us first in Baptism; but afterwards also; whether we obey His voice or not, He graciously calls us still.  If we fall from our Baptism, He calls us to repent; if we are striving to fulfil our calling, He calls us on from grace to grace, and from holiness to holiness, while life is given us.  Abraham was called from his home, Peter from his nets, Matthew from his office, Elisha from his farm, Nathanael from his retreat; we are all in course of calling, on and on, from one thing to another, having no resting-place, but mounting towards our eternal rest, and obeying one command only to have another put upon us.  He calls us again and again, in order to justify us again and again,--and again and again, and more and more, to sanctify and glorify us.  It were well if we understood this; but we are slow to master the great truth, that Christ is, as it were, walking among us, and by His hand, or eye, or voice, bidding us follow Him.  We do not understand that His call is a thing which takes place now.  We think it took place in the Apostles' days; but we do not believe in it, we do not look out for it in our own case.  We have not eyes to see the Lord; far different from the beloved Apostle, who knew Christ even when the rest of the disciples knew Him not.  When He stood on the shore after His resurrection, and bade them cast the net into the sea, \"that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord[12].\"  Now what I mean is this: that they who are living religiously, have from time to time truths they did not know before, or had no need to consider, brought before them forcibly; truths which involve duties, which are in fact precepts, and claim obedience.  In this and such-like ways Christ calls us now.  There is nothing miraculous or extraordinary in His dealings with us.  He works through our natural faculties and circumstances of life.  Still what happens to us in providence is in all essential respects what His voice was to those whom He addressed when on earth: whether He commands by a visible presence, or by a voice, or by our consciences, it matters not, so that we feel it to be a command.  If it is a command, it may be obeyed or disobeyed; it may be accepted as Samuel or St. Paul accepted it, or put aside after the manner of the young man who had great possessions.  And these Divine calls are commonly, from the nature of the case, sudden now, and as indefinite and obscure in their consequences as in former times.  The accidents and events of life are, as is obvious, one special way in which the calls I speak of come to us; and they, as we all know, are in their very nature, and as the word accident implies, sudden and unexpected.  A man is going on as usual; he comes home one day, and finds a letter, or a message, or a person, whereby a sudden trial comes on him, which, if met religiously, will be the means of advancing him to a higher state of religious excellence, which at present he as little comprehends as the unspeakable words heard by St. Paul in paradise.  By a trial we commonly mean, a something which if encountered well, will confirm a man in his present way; but I am speaking of something more than this; of what will not only confirm him, but raise him into a high state of knowledge and holiness.  Many persons will find it very striking on looking back on their past lives, to observe what different notions they entertained at different periods, of what Divine truth was, what was the way of pleasing God, and what things were allowable or not, what excellence was, and what happiness.  I do not scruple to say, that these differences may be as great as that which may be supposed to have existed between St. Peter's state of mind when quietly fishing on the lake, or Elisha's when driving his oxen, and that new state of mind of each of them when called to be Apostle or Prophet.  Elisha and St. Peter indeed were also called to a new mode of life; that I am not speaking of.  I am not speaking of cases when persons change their condition, their place in society, their pursuit, and the like; I am supposing them to remain pretty much the same as before in outward circumstances; but I say that many a man is conscious to himself of having undergone inwardly great changes of view as to what truth is and what happiness.  Nor, again, am I speaking of changes so great, that a man reverses his former opinions and conduct.  He may be able to see that there is a connexion between the two; that his former has led to his latter; and yet he may feel that after all they differ in kind; that he has got into a new world of thought, and measures things and persons by a different rule.  Nothing, indeed, is more wonderful and strange than the different views which different persons take of the same subject.  Take any single fact, event, or existing thing which meets us in the world; what various remarks will be made on it by different persons!  For instance, consider the different lights in which any single action, of a striking nature, is viewed by different persons; or consider the view of wealth or a wealthy man, taken by this or that class in the community; what different feelings does it excite--envy, or respect, or ridicule, or angry opposition, or indifference, or fear and compassion; here are states of mind in which different parties may regard it.  These are broad differences; others are quite as real, though"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24284"],["title","Parochial and Plain Sermons, Vol. VIII (of 8) (#4)"],["body","subtle. Religion, for instance, may be reverenced by the soldier, the man of literature, the trader, the statesman, and the theologian; yet how very distinct their modes of reverencing it, and how separate the standard which each sets up in his mind!  Well, all these various modes of viewing things cannot one and all be the best mode, even were they all good modes; but this even is not the case.  Some are contrary to others; some are bad.  But even of those that are on the whole good, some are but in part good, some are imperfect, some have much bad mixed with them; and only one is best.  Only one is the truth and the perfect truth; and which that is, none know but those who are in possession of it, if even they.  But God knows which it is; and towards that one and only Truth He is leading us forward.  He is leading forward His redeemed, He is training His elect, one and all, to the one perfect knowledge and obedience of Christ; not, however, without their co-operation, but by means of calls which they are to obey, and which if they do not obey, they lose place, and fall behind in their heavenly course.  He leads them forward from strength to strength, and from glory to glory, up the steps of the ladder whose top reacheth to heaven.  We pass from one state of knowledge to another; we are introduced into a higher region from a lower, by listening to Christ's call and obeying it.  Perhaps it may be the loss of some dear friend or relative through which the call comes to us; which shows us the vanity of things below, and prompts us to make God our sole stay.  We through grace do so in a way we never did before; and in the course of years, when we look back on our life, we find that that sad event has brought us into a new state of faith and judgment, and that we are as though other men from what we were.  We thought, before it took place, that we were serving God, and so we were in a measure; but we find that, whatever our present infirmities may be, and however far we be still from the highest state of illumination, then at least we were serving the world under the show and the belief of serving God.  Or again, perhaps something occurs to force us to take a part for God or against Him.  The world requires of us some sacrifice which we see we ought not to grant to it.  Some tempting offer is made us; or some reproach or discredit threatened us; or we have to determine and avow what is truth and what is error.  We are enabled to act as God would have us act; and we do so in much fear and perplexity.  We do not see our way clearly; we do not see what is to follow from what we have done, and how it bears upon our general conduct and opinions: yet perhaps it has the most important bearings.  That little deed, suddenly exacted of us, almost suddenly resolved on and executed, may be as though a gate into the second or third heaven--an entrance into a higher state of holiness, and into a truer view of things than we have hitherto taken.  Or again, we get acquainted with some one whom God employs to bring before us a number of truths which were closed on us before; and we but half understand them, and but half approve of them; and yet God seems to speak in them, and Scripture to confirm them.  This is a case which not unfrequently occurs, and it involves a call \"to follow on to know the Lord[13].\"  Or again, we may be in the practice of reading Scripture carefully, and trying to serve God, and its sense may, as if suddenly, break upon us, in a way it never did before.  Some thought may suggest itself to us, which is a key to a great deal in Scripture, or which suggests a great many other thoughts.  A new light may be thrown on the precepts of our Lord and His Apostles.  We may be able to enter into the manner of life of the early Christians, as recorded in Scripture, which before was hidden from us, and into the simple maxims on which Scripture bases it. We may be led to understand that it is very different from the life which men live now.  Now knowledge is a call to action: an insight into the way of perfection is a call to perfection.  Once more, it may so happen that we find ourselves, how or why we cannot tell, much more able to obey God in certain respects than heretofore.  Our minds are so strangely constituted, it is impossible to say whether it is from the growth of habit suddenly showing itself, or from an unusual gift of Divine grace poured into our hearts, but so it is; let our temptation be to sloth, or irresolution, or worldly anxiety, or pride, or to other more base and miserable sins, we may suddenly find ourselves possessed of a power of self-command which we had not before.  Or again, we may have a resolution grow on us to serve God more strictly in His house and in private than heretofore.  This is a call to higher things; let us beware lest we receive the grace of God in vain.  Let us beware of lapsing back; let us avoid temptation.  Let us strive by quietness and caution to cherish the feeble flame, and shelter it from the storms of this world.  God may be bringing us into a higher world of religious truth, let us work with Him.  To conclude.  Nothing is more certain in matter of fact, than that some men do feel themselves called to high duties and works, to which others are not called.  Why this is we do not know, whether it be that those who are not called, forfeit the call from having failed in former trials, or have been called and have not followed, or that though God gives baptismal grace to all, yet He really does call some men by His free grace to higher things than others; but so it is; this man sees sights which that man does not see, has a larger faith, a more ardent love, and a more spiritual understanding.  No one has any leave to take another's lower standard of holiness for his own.  It is nothing to us what others are.  If God calls us to greater renunciation of the world, and exacts a sacrifice of our hopes and fears, this is our gain, this is a mark of His love for us, this is a thing to be rejoiced in.  Such thoughts, when properly entertained, have no tendency to puff us up; for if the prospect is noble, yet the risk is more fearful.  While we pursue high excellence, we walk among precipices, and a fall is easy. Hence the Apostle says, \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you[14].\"  Again, the more men aim at high things, the more sensitive perception they have of their own shortcomings; and this again is adapted to humble them especially. We need not fear spiritual pride then, in following Christ's call, if we follow it as men in earnest.  Earnestness has no time to compare itself with the state of other men; earnestness has too vivid a feeling of its own infirmities to be elated at itself.  Earnestness is simply set on doing God's will.  It simply says, \"Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth,\" \"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\"  Oh that we had more of this spirit!  Oh that we could take that simple view of things, as to feel that the one thing which lies before us is to please God!  What gain is it to please the world, to please the great, nay, even to please those whom we love, compared with this?  What gain is it to be applauded, admired, courted, followed, compared with this one aim, of not being disobedient to a heavenly vision?  What can this world offer comparable with that insight into spiritual things, that keen faith, that heavenly peace, that high sanctity, that everlasting righteousness, that hope of glory, which they have who in sincerity love and follow our Lord Jesus Christ?  Let us beg and pray Him day by day to reveal Himself to our souls more fully, to quicken our senses; to give us sight and hearing, taste and touch of the world to come, so to work within us that we may sincerely say, \"Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, and after that receive me to glory.  Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of Thee: my flesh and my heart faileth; but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.\"    [1] Acts ix. 6.  [2] Rom. viii. 29.  [3] Acts xxii. 10.  [4] Matt. iv. 18-20.  [5] Matt. xix. 21, 22.  [6] Matt. iv. 18.  [7] Matt. ix. 9.  [8] Mark 11. 14.  [9] Matt. xx. 6, 7.  [10] Luke ix. 59-62.

And he offered the burnt offering._\"--1 Samuel xiii. 9.   We are all on our trial.  Every one who lives is on his trial, whether he will serve God or not.  And we read in Scripture of many instances of the trials upon which Almighty God puts us His creatures.  In the beginning, Adam, when he was first created, was put upon his trial.  He was placed in a beautiful garden, he had every thing given him for his pleasure and comfort; he was created innocent and upright, and he had the great gift of the Holy Spirit given him to enable him to please God, and to attain to heaven.  One thing alone he was forbidden--to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; this was his trial.  If he did not eat of the fruit, he was to live, if he did, he was to die. Alas, he did eat of the fruit, and he did die.  He was tried and found wanting; he fell; such was the end of _his_ trial.  Many other trials, besides Adam's, are recorded in Scripture, and that for our warning and instruction, that we may be reminded that we too are on trial, that we may be encouraged by the examples of those who have stood their trial well and not fallen, and may be sobered and put on our guard by the instances of others who have fallen under their trial.  Of these latter cases, Saul is one.  Saul, of whom we have been reading in the course of this service[1], is an instance of a man whom God blessed and proved, as Adam before him, whom He put on his trial, and who, like Adam, was found wanting.
