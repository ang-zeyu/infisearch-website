She asked many astonishing questions about divine mysteries.\" It is a truly comic anticlimax in her father's stilted letters to her to have him end his pious instructions with this advice: \"And as you love me do not eat green apples.\"  Of the demeanor of children to their parents naught can be said but praise. Respectful in word and deed, every letter, every record shows that the young Puritans truly honored their fathers and mothers. It were well for them to thus obey the law of God, for by the law of the land high-handed disobedience of parents was punishable by death. I do not find this penalty ever was paid, as it was under the sway of grim Calvin, a fact which redounds to the credit both of justice and youth in colonial days.  It was not strange that Judge Sewall, always finding in natural events and appearances symbols of spiritual and religious signification, should find in his children painful types of original sin.       \"Nov. 6, 1692.--Joseph threw a knop of Brass and hit his Sister      Betty on the forehead so as to make it bleed; and upon which, and      for his playing at Prayer-time and eating when Return Thanks, I      whip'd him pretty smartly. When I first went in (call'd by his      Grandmother) he sought to shadow and hide himself from me behind      the head of the Cradle; which gave me the sorrowful remembrance of      Adam's carriage.\"  It was natural, too, that Judge Sewall's children should be timid; they ran in terror to their father's chamber at the approach of a thunderstorm; and, living in mysterious witchcraft days, they fled screaming through the hall, and their mother with them, at the sudden entrance of a neighbor with a rug over her head.  All youthful Puritans were not as godly as the young Sewalls. Nathaniel Mather wrote thus in his diary:       \"When very young I went astray from God and my mind was altogether      taken with vanities and follies: such as the remembrance of them      doth greatly abase my soul within me. Of the manifold sins which      then I was guilty of, none so sticks upon me as that, being very      young, I was _whitling_ on the Sabbath-day; and for fear of being      seen, I did it behind the _door_. A great _reproach_ of God! a      specimen of that _atheism_ I brought into the world with me!\"  It is satisfactory to add that this young prig of a Mather died when nineteen years of age. Except in Jonathan Edwards's \"Narratives of Surprising Conversions,\" no more painful examples of the Puritanical religious teaching of the young can be found than the account given in the _Magnalia_ of various young souls in whom the love of God was remarkably budding, especially this same unwholesome Nathaniel Mather. His diary redounded in dismal groans and self-abasement: he wrote out in detail his covenants with God. He laid out his minute rules and directions in his various religious duties. He lived in prayer thrice a day, and \"did not slubber over his prayers with hasty amputations, but wrestled in them for a good part of an hour.\" He prayed in his sleep. He fasted. He made long lists of sins, long catalogues of things forbidden, \"and then fell a-stoning them.\" He \"chewed much on excellent sermons.\" He not only read the Bible, but \"obliged himself to fetch a note and prayer out of each verse,\" as he read. In spite of all these preparations for a joyous hope and faith, he lived in the deepest despair; was full of blasphemous imaginations, horrible conceptions of God, was dejected, self-loathing, and wretched. Indeed, as Lowell said, soul-saving was to such a Christian the dreariest, not the cheerfullest of businesses.  That the welfare, if not the pleasure, of their children lay very close to the hearts of the Pilgrims, we cannot doubt. Governor Bradford left an account of the motives for the emigration from Holland to the new world, and in a few sentences therein he gives one of the deepest reasons of all--the intense yearning for the true well-being of the children; we can read between the lines the stern and silent love of those noble men, love seldom expressed but ever present, and the rigid sense of duty, duty to be fulfilled as well as exacted. Bradford wrote thus of the Pilgrims:       \"As necessitie was a taskmaster over them, so they were forced to      be such, not only to their servants, but in a sorte, to their      dearest children; the which, as it did not a little wound ye tender      harts of many a loving father and mother, so it produced likewise      sundrie sad and sorrowful effects. For many of their children, that      were of best dispositions and gracious inclinations, haveing lernde      to bear ye yoake in their youth, and willing to bear parte of their      parents burden, were, often times so oppressed with their hevie      labours, that though their minds were free and willing, yet their      bodies bowed under ye weight of ye same, and become decreped in      their early youth; the vigor of nature being consumed in ye very      budd as it were. But that which was more lamentable and of all      sorrowes most heavie to be borne, was, that many of their children,      by these occasions, and ye great licentiousness of youth in ye      countrie, and ye manifold temptations of the place, were drawn away      by evill examples into extravagante and dangerous courses, getting      ye raines off their neks and departing from their parents. Some      became souldiers, others took upon them for viages by sea, and      other some worse courses, tending to disolutenes and the danger of      their soules, to ye great greef of their parents and dishonor of      God. So that they saw their posteritie would be in danger to      degenerate and be corrupted.\"  Though Judge Sewall could control and restrain his children, his power waxed weak over his backsliding and pleasure-seeking grandchildren, and they annoyed him sorely. Sam Hirst, the son of poor timid Betty, lived with his grandfather for a time, and on April 1st, 1719, the Judge wrote:       \"In the morning I dehorted Sam Hirst and Grindall Rawson from      playing Idle tricks because 'twas first of April: They were the      greatest fools that did so. N. E. Men came hither to avoid      anniversary days, the keeping of them such as the 25th of Decr. How      displeasing must it be to God the giver of our Time to keep      anniversary days to play the fool with ourselves and others.\"  Ten years earlier the Judge had written to the Boston schoolmaster, begging him to \"insinuate into the Scholars the Defiling and Provoking nature of such a Foolish Practice\" as playing tricks on April first.  Sam was but a sad losel, and vexed him in other and more serious matters. On March 15th, 1725, the Judge wrote:       \"Sam Hirst got up betime in the morning, and took Ben Swett with      him and went into the Comon to play Wicket. Went before anybody was      up, left the door open: Sam came not to prayer at which I was much      displeased.\"  Two days later he writes thus peremptorily of his grandson:       \"Did the like again, but took not Ben with him. I told him he could      not lodge here practicing thus. So he log'd elsewhere.\"  Though Boston boys played \"wicket\" on Boston Common, I fancy the young Puritans had, as a rule, few games, and were allowed few amusements. They apparently brought over some English pastimes with them, for in 1657 it was found necessary to pass this law in Boston:       \"Forasmuch as sundry complaints are made that several persons have      received hurt by boys and young men playing at football in the      streets, these therefore are to enjoin that none be found at that      game in any of the streets, lanes or enclosures of this town under      the penalty of twenty shillings for every such offence.\"  One needless piece of cruelty which was exercised toward boys by Puritan lawgivers is shown by one of the enjoined duties of the tithingman. He was ordered to keep all boys from swimming in the water. I do not doubt that the boys swam, since each tithingman had ten families under his charge; but of course they could not swim as often nor as long as they wished. From the brother sport of winter, skating, they were not debarred; and they went on thin ice, and fell through and were drowned, just as country boys are nowadays. Judge Sewall wrote on November 30th, 1696:       \"Many scholars go in the afternoon to Scate on Fresh Pond. Wm.      Maxwell and John Eyre fall in, are drowned.\"  In the _New England Weekly Journal_ of January 15th, 1728, we read:       \"On Monday last Two Young Persons who were Brothers, viz Mr. George      and Nathan Howell diverting themselves by Skating at the bottom of      the Common, the Ice breaking under them they were both drowned;\"  and in the same journal of two weeks later date we find record of another death by drowning.       \"A young man, viz, Mr. Comfort Foster, skating on the ice from      Squantum Point to Dorchester, fell into the Water & was drown'd. He      was about 16 or 18 years of age.\"  Advertisements of \"Mens and Boys Scates\" appear in the _Boston Gazette_, of 1749, and the _Boston Evening Post_, of 1758. The February _News Letter_, of 1769, has a notice of the sale of \"Best Holland Scates of Different Sizes.\"  In the list of goods on board a prize taken by a privateersman in 1712 were \"Boxes of Toys.\" Higginson, writing to his brother in 1695, told him that \"toys would sell if in small quantity.\" In exceeding small quantity one would fancy. In 1743 the _Boston News Letter_ advertised \"English and Dutch Toys for Children.\" Not until October, 1771, on the lists of the Boston shop-keepers, who seemed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],["title","Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#3)"],["body","advertise and to sell every known article of dry goods, hardware, house furnishing, ornament, dress and food, came that single but pleasure-filled item \"Boys Marbles.\" \"Battledores and Shuttles\" appeared in 1761. I know that no little maids could ever have lived without dolls, not even the serious-minded daughters of the Pilgrims; but the only dolls that were advertised in colonial newspapers were the \"London drest babys\" of milliners and mantua-makers, that were sent over to serve as fashion plates for modish New England dames. A few century-old dolls still survive Revolutionary times, wooden-faced monstrosities, shapeless and mean, but doubtless well-beloved and cherished in the days of their youth.  As years rolled by and eighteenth century frivolity and worldliness took the place of Puritan sobriety and religion, New England children shared with their elders in that growing love of amusement, which found but few and inadequate methods of expression in the lives of either old or young. In the year 1771 there was sent from Nova Scotia a young miss of New England parentage--Anna Green Winslow--to live with her aunt and receive a \"finishing\" in Boston schools. For the edification of her parents and her own practice in penmanship, this bright little maid kept a diary, of which portions have been preserved, and which I do not hesitate to say is the most sprightly record of the daily life of a girl of her age that I have ever read. There is not a dull word in it, and every page has some statement of historical value. She was twelve years old shortly after the diary was begun, and she then had a \"coming-out party\"--she became a \"miss in her teens.\" To this rout only young ladies of her own age and in the most elegant Boston society were invited--no rough Boston boys. Miss Anna has written for us more than one prim and quaint little picture of similar parties--here is one of her clear and stiff little descriptions; and a graphic account also of the evening dress of a young girl at that time.       \"I have now the pleasure to give you the result Viz; a very genteel      well regulated assembly which we had at Mr. Soleys last evening,      Miss Soley being mistress of the ceremony. Miss Soley desired me to      assist Miss Hannah in making out a list of guests which I did.      Sometime since I wrote all the invitation cards. There was a large      company assembled in a large handsome upper room in the new end of      the house. We had two fiddles and I had the honor to open the      diversion of the evening in a minuet with Miss Soley. Here follows      a list of the company as we form'd for country-dancing. Miss Soley      and Miss Anna Green Winslow; Miss Calif and Miss Scott; Miss      Williams and Miss McLarth; Miss Codman and Miss Winslow; Miss Ives      and Miss Coffin; Miss Scollay and Miss Bella Coffin; Miss Waldo and      Miss Quinsey; Miss Glover and Miss Draper; Miss Hubbard and Miss      Cregur (usually pronounced Kicker) and two Miss Sheafs were invited      but were sick or sorry and beg'd to be excused.       \"There was a little Miss Russel and little ones of the family      present who could not dance. As spectators there were Mr. & Mrs.      Deming, Mr. & Mrs. Sweetser, Mr. and Mrs. Soley, Mr. & Mrs. Claney,      Mrs. Draper, Miss Orice, Miss Hannah--our treat was nuts, raisins,      cakes, Wine, punch hot and cold all in great plenty. We had a very      agreeable evening from 5 to 10 o'clock. For variety we woo'd a      widow, hunted the whistle, threaded the needle, & while the company      was collecting we diverted ourselves with playing of pawns--_no      rudeness_ Mamma I assure you. Aunt Deming desires you would      particularly observe that the elderly part of the Company were      _Spectators only_, that they mixed not in either of the      above-described scenes.       \"I was dressed in my yelloe coat, black bib and apron, black      feathers on my head, my paste comb and all my paste garnet      marquasett & jet pins, together with my silver plume--my locket,      rings, black collar round my neck, black mitts and yards of blue      ribbon (black and blue is high tast) striped tucker & ruffles (not      my best) and my silk shoes completed my dress.\"  How clear the picture: can you not see it--the low raftered chamber softly alight with candles on mantel-tree and in sconces; the two fiddles soberly squeaking: the rows of demure little Boston maids, all of New England Brahmin blood, in high rolls, with nodding plumes and sparkling combs, with ruffles and mitts, little miniatures of their elegant mammas, soberly walking and curtseying through the stately minuet \"with no rudeness I can assure you;\" and discreetly partaking of hot and cold punch afterward.  There came at this time to another lady in this Boston court circle a grandchild eight years of age, from the Barbadoes, to also attend Boston schools. Missy left her grandmother's house in high dudgeon because she could not have wine at all her meals. And her parents upheld her, saying she had been brought up a lady and must have wine when she wished it. Evidently Cobbett's statement of the free drinking of wine, cider, and beer by American children was true--as Anna Green Winslow's \"treat\" would also show.  Though Puritan children had few recreations and amusements, they must have enjoyed a very cheerful, happy home life. Large families abounded. Cotton Mather says:       \"One woman had not less than twenty-two children, and another had      no less than twenty-three children by one husband whereof nineteen      lived to mans estate, and a third who was mother to seven and      twenty children.\"  Sir William Phips was one of twenty-six children, all with the same mother. Printer Green had thirty children. The Rev. John Sherman, of Watertown, had twenty-six children by two wives--twenty by his last wife. The Rev. Samuel Willard, first minister to Groton, had twenty children, and his father had seventeen children. Benjamin Franklin was one of a family of seventeen. Charles Francis Adams has told us of the fruitful vines of old Braintree.  The little Puritans rejoiced in some very singular names, the offspring of Roger Clap being good examples: Experience, Waitstill, Preserved, Hopestill, Wait, Thanks, Desire, Unite, and Supply.  Of the food given Puritan children we know but little. In an old almanac of the eighteenth century I find a few sentences of advice as to the \"Easy Rearing of Children.\" The writer urges that boys as soon as they can run alone go without hats to harden them, and if possible sleep without night-caps, as soon as they have any hair. He advises always to wet children's feet in cold water and thus make them (the feet) tough, and also to have children wear thin-soled shoes \"that the wet may come freely in.\" He says young children should never be allowed to drink cold drinks, but should always have their beer a little heated; that it is \"best to feed them on Milk, Pottage, Flummery, Bread, and Cheese, and not let them drink their beer till they have first eaten a piece of Brown Bread.\" Fancy a young child nowadays making a meal of brown bread and cheese with warm beer! He suggests that they drink but little wine or liquor, and sleep on quilts instead of feathers. In such ways were reared our Revolutionary heroes.  Of the dazzling and beautiful array in our modern confectioners' shops little Priscilla and Hate-Evil could never have dreamed, even in visions. A few comfit-makers made \"Lemon Pil Candy, Angelica Candy, Candy'd Eryngo Root & Carroway Comfits;\" and a few sweetmeats came to port in foreign vessels, \"Sugar'd Corrinder Seeds,\" \"Glaz'd Almonds,\" and strings of rock-candy. Whole jars of the latter adamantine, crystalline, saccharine delight graced the shelves of many a colonial cupboard. And I suppose favored Salem children, the happy sons and daughters of opulent epicurean Salem shipowners, had even in colonial days Black Jacks and Salem Gibraltars. The first-named dainties, though dearly loved by Salem lads and lasses, always bore--indeed, do still bear--too strong a flavor of liquorice, too haunting a medicinal suggestion to be loved by other children of the Puritans. As an instance, on a large scale, of the retributive fate that always pursues the candy-eating wight, I state that the good ship Ann and Hope brought into Providence one hundred years ago, as part of her cargo, eight boxes of sweetmeats and twenty tubs of sugar candy, and on the succeeding voyage sternly fetched no sweets, but brought instead forty-eight boxes of rhubarb.  The children doubtless had prunes, figs, \"courance,\" and I know they had \"Raisins of the Sun\" and \"Bloom Raisins\" galore. Advertisements of all these fruits appear in the earliest newspapers. Though \"China Oranges\" were frequently given to and by Judge Sewall, I have not found them advertised for sale till Revolutionary times, and I fancy few children had then tasted them. The native and domestic fruits were plentiful, but many of them were poor. The apples and pears and Kentish cherries were better than the peaches and grapes. The children gathered the summer berries in season, and the autumn's plentiful and spicy store of boxberries, checkerberries, teaberries or gingerbread berries with October's brown nuts. There were gingerbread and \"cacks\" even in the earliest days; but they were not sold in unlimited numbers. The omnipotent hand of Puritan law laid its firm hold on their manufacture. Judge Sewall often speaks, however, of Banbury cakes and Meers cakes; Meer was a celebrated Boston baker and confectioner. The colonists had also egg cakes and marchepanes and maccaroons.  There were children's books in those early days; not numerous, however, nor varied was the assortment from which Puritan youth in New England could choose. Here is the advertisement of one:       \"Small book in easey verse Very Suitable for children, entitled The      Prodigal Daughter or the Disobedient "]]]
