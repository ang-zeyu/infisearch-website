So you can see for yourself that a meeting might be awkward for all parties concerned; and I really must get out, James!\"  Jauncy forced him back. \"It's all nonsense, Tweddle,\" he said, \"you can't back out of it now! Don't make a fuss about nothing. Ada don't look as if she'd been breaking her heart for you!\"  \"You never can tell with women,\" said the hairdresser, sententiously; \"and meeting me sudden, and learning it could never be--no one can say how she mightn't take it!\"  \"I call it too bad!\" exclaimed Jauncy. \"Here have I been counting on you to make the ladies enjoy themselves--for I haven't your gift of entertaining conversation, and don't pretend to it--and you go and leave me in the lurch, and spoil their evening for them!\"  \"If I thought I was doing that----\" said Leander, hesitating.  \"You are, you know you are!\" persisted Jauncy, who was naturally anxious to avoid the reduction of his party to so inconvenient a number as three.  \"And see here, Tweddle, you needn't say anything of your engagement unless you like. I give you my word I won't, not even to Bella, if you'll only come! As to Ada, she can take care of herself, unless I'm very much mistaken in her. So come along, like a good chap!\"  \"I give in, James; I give in,\" said Leander. \"A promise is a promise, and yet I feel somehow I'm doing wrong to go, and as if no good would come of it. I do indeed!\"  And so he did not stop the cab a second time, and allowed himself to be taken without further protest to Fenchurch Street Station, on the platform of which they found the Misses Parkinson waiting for them.  Miss Bella Parkinson, the elder of the two, who was employed in a large toy and fancy goods establishment in the neighbourhood of Westbourne Grove, was tall and slim, with pale eyes and auburn hair. She had some claims to good looks, in spite of a slightly pasty complexion, and a large and decidedly unamiable mouth.  Her sister Ada was the more pleasing in appearance and manner, a brunette with large brown eyes, an impertinent little nose, and a brilliant healthy colour. She was an assistant to a milliner and bonnet-maker in the Edgware Road.  Both these young ladies, when in the fulfilment of their daily duties, were models of deportment; in their hours of ease, the elder's cold dignity was rather apt to turn to peevishness, while the younger sister, relieved from the restraints of the showroom, betrayed a lively and even frivolous disposition.  It was this liveliness and frivolity that had fascinated the hairdresser in days that had gone by; but if he had felt any self-distrust now in venturing within their influence, such apprehensions vanished with the first sight of the charms which had been counteracted before they had time to prevail.  She was well enough, this Miss Ada Parkinson, he thought now; a nice-looking girl in her way, and stylishly dressed. But his Matilda looked twice the lady she ever could, and a vision of his betrothed (at that time taking a week's rest in the country) rose before him, as if to justify and confirm his preference.  The luckless James had to undergo some amount of scolding from Miss Bella for his want of punctuality, a scolding which merely supplied an object to his grin; and during her remarks, Ada had ample time to rally Leander Tweddle upon his long neglect, and used it to the best advantage.  Perhaps he would have been better pleased by a little less insensibility, a touch of surprise and pleasure on her part at meeting him again, as he allowed himself to show in a remark that his absence did not seem to have affected her to any great extent.  \"I don't know what you expected, Mr. Tweddle,\" she replied. \"Ought I to have cried both my eyes out? You haven't cried out either of yours, you know!\"  \"'Men must work, and women must weep,' as Shakspeare says,\" he observed, with a vague idea that he was making rather an apt quotation. But his companion pointed out that this only applied to cases where the women had something to weep about.  The party had a compartment to themselves, and Leander, who sat at one end opposite to Ada, found his spirits rising under the influence of her lively sallies.  \"That's the only thing Matilda wants,\" he thought, \"a little more liveliness and go about her. I like a little chaff myself, now and then, I must say.\"  At the other end of the carriage, Bella had been suggesting that the gardens might be closed so late in the year, and regretting that they had not chosen the new melodrama at the Adelphi instead; which caused Jauncy to draw glowing pictures of the attractions of Rosherwich Gardens.  \"I was there a year ago last summer,\" he said, \"and it was first-rate: open-air dancing, summer theatre, rope-walking, fireworks, and supper out under the trees. You'll enjoy yourself, Bella, right enough when you get there!\"  \"If that isn't enough for you, Bella,\" cried her sister, \"you must be difficult to please! I'm sure I'm quite looking forward to it; aren't you, Mr. Tweddle?\"  The poor man was cursed by the fatal desire of pleasing, and unconsciously threw an altogether unnecessary degree of _empressement_ into his voice as he replied, \"In the company I am at present, I should look forward to it, if it was a wilderness with a funeral in it.\"  \"Oh dear me, Mr. Tweddle, that _is_ a pretty speech!\" said Ada, and she blushed in a manner which appalled the conscience-stricken hairdresser.  \"There I go again,\" he thought remorsefully, \"putting things in the poor girl's head--it ain't right. I'm making myself too pleasant!\"  And then it struck him that it would be only prudent to make his position clearly understood, and, carefully lowering his voice, he began a speech with that excellent intention. \"Miss Parkinson,\" he said huskily, \"there's something I have to tell you about myself, very particular. Since I last enjoyed the pleasure of meeting with you my prospects have greatly altered, I am no longer----\"  But she cut him short with a little gesture of entreaty. \"Oh, not here, please, Mr. Tweddle,\" she said; \"tell me about it in the gardens!\"  \"Very well,\" he said, relieved; \"remind me when we get there--in case I forget, you know.\"  \"Remind you!\" cried Ada; \"the _idea_, Mr. Tweddle! I certainly shan't do any such thing.\"  \"She thinks I am going to propose to her!\" he thought ruefully; \"it will be a delicate business undeceiving her. I wish it was over and done with!\"  It was quite dark by the time they had crossed the river by the ferry, and made their way up to the entrance to the pleasure gardens, imposing enough, with its white colonnade, its sphinxes, and lines of coloured lamps.  But no one else had crossed with them; and, as they stood at the turnstiles, all they could see of the grounds beyond seemed so dark and silent that they began to have involuntary misgivings. \"I suppose,\" said Jauncy to the man at the ticket-hole, \"the gardens are open--eh?\"  \"Oh yes,\" he said gruffly, \"_they're_ open--they're _open_; though there ain't much going on out-of-doors, being the last night of the season.\"  Bella again wished that they had selected the Adelphi for their evening's pleasure, and remarked that Jauncy \"might have known.\"  \"Well,\" said the latter to the party generally, \"what do you say--shall we go in, or get back by the first train home?\"  \"Don't be so ridiculous, James!\" said Bella, peevishly. \"What's the good of going back, to be too late for everything. The mischief's done now.\"  \"Oh, let's go in!\" advised Ada; \"the amusements and things will be just as nice indoors--nicer on a chilly evening like this;\" and Leander seconded her heartily.  So they went in; Jauncy leading the way with the still complaining Bella, and Leander Tweddle bringing up the rear with Ada. They picked their way as well as they could in the darkness, caused by the closely planted trees and shrubs, down a winding path, where the sopped leaves gave a slippery foothold, and the branches flicked moisture insultingly in their faces as they pushed them aside.  A dead silence reigned everywhere, broken only by the wind as it rustled amongst the bare twigs, or the whistling of a flaring gas-torch protruding from some convenient tree.  Jauncy occasionally shouted back some desperate essay at jocularity, at which Ada laughed with some perseverance, until even she could no longer resist the influence of the surroundings.  On a hot summer's evening those grounds, brilliantly illuminated and crowded by holiday-makers, have been the delight of thousands of honest Londoners, and will be so again; but it was undeniable that on this particular occasion they were pervaded by a decent melancholy.  Ada had slipped a hand, clad in crimson silk, through Leander's arm as they groped through the gloom together, and shrank to his side now and then in an alarm which was only half pretended. But if her light pressure upon his arm made his heart beat at all the faster, it was only at the fancy that the trusting hand was his Matilda's, or so at least did he account for it to himself afterwards.  They followed on, down a broad promenade, where the ground glistened with autumn damps, and the unlighted lamps looked wan and spectral. There was a bear-pit hard by, over the railings of which Ada leaned and shouted a defiant \"Boo;\" but the bears had turned in for the night, and the stone re-echoed her voice with a hollow ring. Indistinct bird forms were roosting in cages; but her umbrella had no effect upon them.  Jauncy was waiting for them to come up, perhaps as a protection against his _fianc√©e's_ reproaches. \"In another hour,\" he said, with an implied apology, \"you'll see how different this place looks. We--we're come a little too early. Suppose we fill up the time by a nice little dinner at the Restorong--eh, Ada? What do you think, Tweddle?\"  The suggestion was received favourably, and Jauncy, thankful to retrieve his reputation as leader, took them"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24197"],["title","The Tinted Venus: A Farcical Romance (#2)"],["body","the spot where food was to be had.  Presently they saw lights twinkling through the trees, and came to a place which was clearly the focus of festivity. There was the open-air theatre, its drop-scene lowered, its proscenium lost in the gloom; there was the circle for _al-fresco_ dancing, but it was bare, and the clustered lights were dead; there was the restaurant, dark and silent like all else.  Jauncy stood there and rubbed his chin. \"This is where I dined when we were here last,\" he said, at length; \"and a capital little dinner they gave us too!\"  \"What _I_ should like to know,\" said the elder Miss Parkinson, \"is, where are we to dine to-night?\"  \"Yes,\" said Jauncy, encouragingly; \"don't you fret yourself, Bella. Here's an old party sweeping up leaves, we'll ask him.\"  They did so, and were referred to a large building, in the Gothic style, with a Tudor doorway, known as the \"Baronial All,\" where lights shone behind the painted windows.  Inside, a few of the lamps around the pillars were lighted, and the body of the floor was roped in as if for dancing; but the hall was empty, save for a barmaid, assisted by a sharp little girl, behind the long bar on one of its sides.  Jauncy led his dejected little party up to this, and again put his inquiry with less hopefulness. When he found that the only available form of refreshment that evening was bitter ale and captain's biscuits, mitigated by occasional caraway seeds, he became a truly pitiable object.  \"They--they don't keep this place up on the same scale in the autumn, you see,\" he explained weakly. \"It's very different in summer; what they call 'an endless round of amusements.'\"  \"There's an endless round of amusement now,\" observed Ada; \"but it's a naught!\"  \"Oh, there'll be something going on by-and-by, never fear,\" said Jauncy, determined to be sanguine; \"or else they wouldn't be open.\"  \"There'll be dancing here this evening,\" the barmaid informed him. \"That is all we open for at this time of year; and this is the last night of the season.\"  \"Oh!\" said Jauncy, cheerfully; \"you see we only came just in time, Bella; and I suppose you'll have a good many down here to-night--eh, miss?\"  \"How much did we take last Saturday, Jenny?\" said the barmaid to the sharp little girl.  \"Seven and fourpence 'ap'ny--most of it beer,\" said the child. \"Margaret, I may count the money again to-night, mayn't I?\"  The barmaid made some mental calculation, after which she replied to Jauncy's question. \"We may have some fifteen couples or so down to-night,\" she said; \"but that won't be for half an hour yet.\"  \"The question is,\" said Jauncy, trying to bear up under this last blow; \"the question is, How are we to amuse ourselves till the dancing begins?\"  \"I don't know what others are going to do,\" Bella announced; \"but I shall stay here, James, and keep warm--if I can!\" and once more she uttered her regret that they had not gone to the Adelphi.  Her sister declined to follow her example. \"I mean to see all there is to be seen,\" she declared, \"since we are here; and perhaps Mr. Tweddle will come and take care of me. Will you, Mr. Tweddle?\"  He was not sorry to comply, and they wandered out together through the grounds, which offered considerable variety. There were alleys lined with pale plaster statues, and a grove dedicated to the master minds of the world, represented by huge busts, with more or less appropriate quotations. There were alcoves, too, and neatly ruined castles.  Ada talked almost the whole time in a sprightly manner, which gave Leander no opportunity of introducing the subject of his engagement, and this continued until they had reached a small battlemented platform on some rising ground; below were the black masses of trees, with a faint fringe of light here and there; beyond lay the Thames, in which red and white reflections quivered, and from whose distant bends and reaches came the dull roar of fog-horns and the pantings of tugs.  Ada stood here in silence for some time; at last she said, \"After all, I'm not sorry we came--are _you_?\"  \"If I don't take care what I say, I _may_ be!\" he thought, and answered guardedly, \"On the contrary, I'm glad, for it gives me the opportunity of telling you something I--I think you ought to know.\"  \"What was he going to say next?\" she thought. Was a declaration coming, and if so, should she accept him? She was not sure; he had behaved very badly in keeping so long away from her, and a proposal would be a very suitable form of apology; but there was the gentleman who travelled for a certain firm in the Edgware Road, he had been very \"particular\" in his attentions of late. Well, she would see how she felt when Leander had spoken; he was beginning to speak now.  \"I don't want to put it too abrupt,\" he said; \"I'll come to it gradually. There's a young lady that I'm now looking forward to spending the whole of my future life with.\"  \"And what is she called?\" asked Ada. (\"He's rather a nice little man, after all!\" she was thinking.)  \"Matilda,\" he said; and the answer came like a blow in the face. For the moment she hated him as bitterly as if he had been all the world to her; but she carried off her mortification by a rather hysterical laugh.  \"Fancy you being engaged!\" she said, by way of explanation of her merriment; \"and to any one with the name of Matilda--it's such a stupid sounding sort of name!\"  \"It ain't at all; it all depends how you say it. If you pronounce it like I do, _Matilda_, it has rather a pretty sound. You try now.\"  \"Well, we won't quarrel about it, Mr. Tweddle; I'm glad it isn't my name, that's all. And now tell me all about your young lady. What's her other name, and is she very good-looking?\"  \"She's a Miss Matilda Collum,\" said he; \"she is considered handsome by competent judges, and she keeps the books at a florist's in the vicinity of Bayswater.\"  \"And, if it isn't a rude question, why didn't you bring her with you this evening?\"  \"Because she's away for a short holiday, and isn't coming back till the last thing to-morrow night.\"  \"And I suppose you've been wishing I was Matilda all the time?\" she said audaciously; for Miss Ada Parkinson was not an over-scrupulous young person, and did not recognize in the fact of her friend's engagement any reason why she should not attempt to reclaim his vagrant admiration.  Leander _had_ been guilty of this wish once or twice; but though he was not absolutely overflowing with tact, he did refrain from admitting the impeachment.  \"Well, you see,\" he said, in not very happy evasion, \"Matilda doesn't care about this kind of thing; she's rather particular, Matilda is.\"  \"And I'm not!\" said Ada. \"I see; thank you, Mr. Tweddle!\"  \"You do take one up so!\" he complained. \"I never intended nothing of the sort--far from it.\"  \"Well, then, I forgive you; we can't all be Matildas, I suppose. And now, suppose we go back; they will be beginning to dance by now!\"  \"With pleasure,\" he said; \"only you must excuse me dancing, because, as an engaged man, I have had to renounce (except with one person) the charms of Terpsy-chore. I mean,\" he explained condescendingly, \"that I can't dance in public save with my intended.\"  \"Ah, well,\" said Ada, \"perhaps Terpsy-chore will get over it; still I should like to see the Terpsy-choring, if you have no objection.\"  And they returned to the Baronial Hall, which by this time presented a more cheerful appearance. The lamps round the mirror-lined pillars were all lit, and the musicians were just striking up the opening bars of the Lancers; upon which several gentlemen amongst the assembly, which now numbered about forty, ran out into the open and took up positions, like colour-sergeants at drill, to be presently joined, in some bashfulness, by such ladies as desired partners.  The Lancers were performed with extreme conscientiousness; and when it was over, every gentleman with any _savoir faire_ to speak of presented his partner with a glass of beer.  Then came a waltz, to which Ada beat time impatiently with her foot, and bit her lip, as she had to look on by Leander's side.  \"There's Bella and James going round,\" she said; \"I've never had to sit out a waltz before!\"  He felt the implied reproach, and thought whether there could be any harm, after all, in taking a turn or two; it would be only polite. But, before he could recant in words, a soldier came up, a medium-sized warrior with a large nose and round little eyes, who had been very funny during the Lancers in directing all the figures by words of military command.  \"Will you allow me the honour, miss, of just one round?\" he said to Ada, respectfully enough.  The etiquette of this ballroom was not of the strictest; but she would not have consented but for the desire of showing Leander that she was not dependent upon him for her amusement. As it was, she accepted the corporal's arm a little defiantly.  Leander watched them round the hall with an odd sensation, almost of jealousy--it was quite ridiculous, because he could have danced with Ada himself had he cared to do so; and besides, it was not she, but Matilda, whom he adored.  But, as he began to notice, Ada was looking remarkably pretty that evening, and really was a partner who would bring any one credit; and her corporal danced villainously, revolving with stiff and wooden jerks, like a toy soldier. Now Leander flattered himself he could waltz--having had considerable practice in bygone days in a select assembly, where the tickets were two shillings each, and the gentlemen, as the notices said ambiguously enough, \"were restricted to wearing gloves.\"  So he felt indignantly that Ada was not having justice done to her. \"I've a good mind to give her a turn,\" he thought, \"and show them all what waltzing is!\"  Just then the pair happened to come to a halt close to him. \"Shockin' time they're playing this waltz in,\" he heard the soldier exclaim with humorous vivacity (he was apparently the funny man of the regiment, and had brought a silent "]]]
