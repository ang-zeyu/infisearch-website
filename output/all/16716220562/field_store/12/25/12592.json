The rhythmic friction of stone against steel prolonged suspense unbearably. All kinds of speculation crowded my mind while the leisurely performance went on. The grass was growing rapidly; faster than vegetation had ever grown before. Could it grow so quickly the farmer's scythe couldnt keep up with it? Suppose it had been wheat or corn? Planted today, it would be ready to harvest next week, fully ripe. The original dream of Miss Francis would pale compared with the reality. There was still--somewhere, somehow--a fortune in the Metamorphizer....  Ready at last, Mr Barelli walked delicately across the stubble as if it were a substance too precious to be trampled brutally. Again he measured the rippling, ascending mass with his eye. It was the look of a bridegroom.  \"What you waitin for?\"  Unheeding, he scraped bootwelt semicircularly on the sward as though to mark a stance. Once more he appraised the grass, crooked his knee, rested his hands lightly on the two short, upraised handholds. Satisfied at length with his preparations, he finally drew the scythe back with a sweeping motion of both arms and curved it forward close to the ground. It embraced a sudden island lovingly and a sheaf of grass swooned into a heap. I was reminded of old woodcuts in a history of the French Revolution.  The bystanders sighed in harmony. \"Nothing to it ... should a had him in the first place ... can't beat the old elbowgrease. No, sir, musclepower'll do it every time ... guess it's licked now all right, all right....\" Mr Barelli duplicated his sweep and another sheaf fell. Another. And another....  \"One of the oldest human rituals,\" remarked Miss Francis, swaying her body in time with the farmer's. \"An act of devotion to Ceres. But all this husbandman reaps is _Cynodon dactylon_. A commentary.\"  \"Progress,\" I pointed out. \"Now they have machines to harvest grain. All uptodate farmers use them; only the backward ones stick to primitive tools and have to make a living by taking on odd jobs.\"  \"Progress,\" she repeated, looking from the scythewielder to me and back again. \"Progress, Weener. A remarkable conception of the nineteenth century....\"  The less intense spectators began to move off; not, to be sure, without backward glances, but the metronomic swing of Mr Barelli's blade indicated it was all over with the rank grass now. I too should have been on my way, writing off the Metamorphizer as a total loss and considering methods for making a new and more profitable connection. Not that I was one to leave a sinking ship, nor had I lost faith in the potentialities of Miss Francis' discovery; but she either wasnt smart enough to modify her formula, or else ... but there really wasnt any \"or else\". She just wasnt smart enough to make the Metamorphizer marketable and she was cheating me of the handsome return which should be rightfully mine.  She'd made the stuff and deceived me by an unscrupulously worded advertisement, now, no longer interested, she asked airily if further effort were essential. Who wouldnt be indignant? And to cap it all she suddenly ejaculated, \"Can't dawdle around here all day\" and after snatching up a handful of the scythings, she left, rolling her large body from side to side, galloping her untidy hair up and down over her neck as she took rapid strides. Evidently the attractions of her messy kitchen were more to her taste than the wholesome air of outdoors. Pottering around, producing another mare's nest and eventually, I suppose, getting another victim....   _7._ But I couldnt leave so cavalierly. Every leaf, stem, and blade of the cancerous grass held me in somewhat the same way Miss Francis' intense eyes did. It wasnt an aesthetic or morbid attraction--its basis was strictly practical. If it could have been controlled--if only the growth could be induced on a modified and proper scale--what a product! A fury of frustration rocked my customary calm....  The stretch and retraction of the mower's arms, the swift, bright curving as the scythe cut deeper, fascinated me. An unscrupulous man--just as a whimsical thought--might go about in the night inoculating lawns surreptitiously and appear with a crew next day to offer his services in cutting them. Just goes to show how easy it is to make dishonest speculations ... but of course such things don't pay in the long run....  The lush area was being reduced, but perhaps not with the same rapidity as at first when Mr Barelli was at the top of enthusiastic--if the adjective was applicable--vigor. Oftener and oftener and oftener he paused to sharpen his implement and I thought the cropped shocks were becoming smaller and smaller. As the movement of the scythe swept the guillotined grass backward, the trailing stolons entangled themselves with the uncut stand, pulling the sheaves out of place and making the stacks ragged and inadequate looking.  Behind me a cocky voice asked, \"What's cooking around here, chum?\"  I turned round to a young man, thin as a bamboo pole, elegantly tailored, who yawned to advertise gold inlays. I explained while he looked skeptical, bored and knowing simultaneously. \"Who would tha flummox, bah goom?\" he inquired.  \"Ay?\"  He took a pack of playingcards from his pocket and riffled them expertly. \"Who you kidding, bud?\" he translated.  \"No one. Ask anybody here if this wasnt a dead lawn yesterday and if it hasnt grown this high since morning.\"  He yawned again and proffered me the deck. \"Pick any card,\" he suggested. To avoid rudeness I selected one. He put the pack back and said, \"You have the nine of diamonds. Clever, eh?\"  I didnt know whether it was or not. He accepted the pasteboard from me and said, peering out from under furry black eyebrows, \"If I brought in a story like that, the chief would fire me before you could say James Gordon Bennett.\"  \"Youre a reporter?\"  \"Acute chap. Newspaperman. Name of Gootes. Jacson Gootes, _Daily Intelligencer_, not _Thrilling Wonder Stories_.\"  I thought I saw an answer to my most pressing problem. One has to stoop occasionally to methods which, if they didnt lead to important ends, might almost be termed petty; but afterall there was no reason Mr Jacson Gootes shouldnt buy me a dinner in return for information valuable to him. \"Let's get away from here,\" I suggested.  He fished out a coin, showed it to me, waved his arm in the air and opened an empty palm for my inspection. \"Ah sho would like to, cunnel, but Ahve got to covah thisyeah sto'y--even if it's out of this mizzble wo'ld.\"  \"I'm sure I can give you details to bring it down to earth,\" I told him. \"Make it a story your editor will be glad to have.\"  \"'Glad'!\" He pressed tobacco into a slender pipe as emaciated as himself. \"You don't know W R. If he got a beat on the story of Creation he'd be sore as hell because God wanted a byline.\"  He evidently enjoyed his own quip for he repeated several times in different accents \"... God wanted a byline.\" He puffed a matchflame and surveyed the field of Mr Barelli's effort. \"Hardworkin feller, what? Guess I better have a chat with the bounder--probably closest to the dashed thing.\"  \"Mr Gootes,\" I said impressively, \"I am the man who applied the inoculator to this grass. Now shall we get out of here so you can listen to my story?\"  \"Sonabeesh--thees gona be good. Lead away, amigo--I prepare both ears to leesten.\"  I drew him toward Hollywood Boulevard and into a restaurant I calculated might not be too expensive for his generosity. Besides, he probably had an expenseaccount. We put a porcelaintopped table between us and he commanded, \"Give down.\" Obediently I went over all the happenings of yesterday, omitting only Miss Francis' name and the revealing wording of the ad.  Gootes surveyed me interestedly. \"You certainly started something here, Acne and/or Psoriasis.\"  Humor like his was beneath offense. \"My name's Albert Weener.\"  \"Mine's Mustard.\" He produced a plastic cup and rapidly extracted from it a series of others in diminishing sizes. \"I wouldnt have thought it to look at you. The dirty deed, I mean--not the exzemical hotdog. O K, Mister Weener--who's this scientific magnate? Whyre you holding him out on me?\"  \"Scientists don't like to be disturbed in their researches,\" I temporized.  \"No more does a man in a whorehouse,\" he retorted vulgarly. \"Story's no good without him.\"  That was what I thought and I'm afraid my satisfaction appeared on my face.  \"Now leely man--no try a hold up da press. Whatsa matter, you aready had da beer and da roasta bif sanawich?\"  \"Maybe you better repeat the order. You know in these cheap places they don't like to have you sit around and talk without spending money.\"  \"Money! Eh, laddie--I'm nae a millionaire.\" He balanced a full glass of water thoughtfully upon a knifeblade, looking around for applause. When it was not forthcoming he meekly followed my suggestion.  \"Listen, Gootes,\" I swallowed a mouthful of sandwich and sipped a little beer. \"I want to help you get your story.\"  He waved his hand and pulled a handkerchief out of his ear.  \"The point is,\" I commenced, sopping a piece of bread in the thick gravy, \"if I were to betray the confidence involved I couldnt hope to continue my connection and I'd lose my chances to benefit from this remarkable discovery.\"  \"Balls,\" exclaimed Gootes. \"Forget the spiel. I'm not a prospect for your lawn tonic.\"  I disregarded the interruption. \"I'm not a mercenary man and I believe in enlightening the public to the fullest extent compatible with decency. I'm willing to make a sacrifice for the general good, yet I--\"  \"--'must live.' I know, I know. How much?\"  \"It seems to me fifty dollars would be little enough--\"  \"Fifty potatoes!\" He went through an elaborate pantomime of shock, horror, indignation, grotesque dismay and a dozen other assorted emotions. \"Little man, youre fruitcake sure.

Five I might get you--but no more.\"  I replied firmly I was not in need of charity--ignoring his pointed look at the remains on my plate--and this was strictly a business proposition, payment for value received. After some bargaining he finally agreed to phone his managingeditor and propose I'd \"come clean\" for twenty dollars. While he was on this errand I added pie and coffee to the check. It is well to be provident and I'd paid for my meal in more than money.  Jacson Gootes came limply from the phonebooth, his bumptiousness gone. \"No soap.\" He shook his head dejectedly. \"Old Man said only pity for the lower mammals prevented him from letting me go to work for Hearst right away. Sorry.\"  His nerves appeared quite shattered; capable of restoration only by Old Grandad. After tossing down a couple of bourbons he seemed a little recovered, but hardly quite well enough to use an accent or perform a trick.  \"I'm sorry also,\" I said. \"Since we can be of no further use to each other--\"  \"Don't take a powder, chum,\" he urged plaintively. \"What about a last gander at the weed together?\"  As we walked back I reflected that at any rate I was saved from submitting Miss Francis to vulgar publicity. Everything is for the best--Ive seen a hundred instances to prove it. Perhaps--who knew--something might yet happen to make it possible for me to profit by the freak growth.  \"Needs a transfusion,\" remarked Gootes as we stood on the sidewalk before it.  Indeed it was anemically green; uneven, hacked and ragged; shorn of its emerald beauty. A high fog filtered the late afternoon light to show Mr Barelli's task accomplished and the curious watchers gone. It was no smoothly clipped carpet, yet it was no longer a freakish, exotic thing. Rather forlorn it looked, and crippled.  \"Paleface pay out much wampum to get um cut every day.\"  \"Oh, it probably won't take long till the strength is exhausted.\"  \"Says you. Well, Ive got half a story. Cheerio.\"  I sighed. If only Miss Francis could control it. A fortune ...  I walked home, trying to figure out what I was going to do tomorrow.   _8._ I thought I was prepared for anything after the shocks of the day before; I know I was prepared for nothing at all--to find the grass as I'd left it or even reverted to its original decay. Indeed, I was not too sure that my memory was completely accurate; that the thing had happened so fantastically.  But the devilgrass had outdone itself and made my anticipations foolish. It waved a green crest higher than the crowd--a crowd three times the size of yesterday's and increasing rapidly. All the scars inflicted on it, the indignities of scythe and mower, were covered by a new and even more prodigious stand which made all its former growth appear puny. Bold and insolent, it had repaired the hackedout areas and risen to such a height that, except for a narrow strip at the top, all the windows of the Dinkman house were smothered. Of the garage, only the roof, islanded and bewildered, was visible, apparently resting on a solid foundation of devilgrass. It sprawled kittenishly, its deceptive softness faintly suggesting fur; at once playful and destructive. My optimism of the night before was dashed; this voracious growth wasnt going to dwindle away of itself. It would have to be killed, rooted out.  Now the Dinkman lawn wasnt continuous with its neighbors, but, until now, had been set off by chesthigh hedges. The day before these had contained and defined the growth, but, overwhelming them in the night, the grass had swept across and invaded the neat, civilized plots behind, blurring sharply cut edges, curiously investigating flowerbeds, barbarously strangling shapely bushes.  But these werent the ravages which upset me; it was reasonable if not entirely comfortable to see shrubbery, plants and blossoms swallowed up. Work of men's hands they may be, but they bear the imprimatur of nature. The cement sidewalk, however, was pure artifice, stamped with the trademark of man. Indignity and defeat were symbolized by its overrunning; it was an arrogant defiance, an outrageous challenge offered to every man happening by. But the grass was not satisfied with this irreverence: it was already making demands on curbing and gutter.  \"Junior, youve got a story now. W R fired three copyboys and a proofreader he was so mad at himself. Here.\" Jacson Gootes made a pass in the air, simulated astonishment at the twentydollar bill which appeared miraculously between his fingers and put it in my hand.  \"Thank you,\" I replied coolly. \"Just what is this for?\"  \"Faith, me boy, such innocence Ive never seen since I left the old sod. Tis but a little token of esteem from himself, to repay you for the trouble of leading me to your scientist, your Frankenstein, your Burbank. Lead on, my boy. And make it snappy, brother,\" he added, \"because Ive got to be back here for the rescue.\"  \"Rescue?\"  \"Yeah. People in the house.\" He consulted a scrap of paper. \"Pinkman--\"  \"Dinkman.\"  \"Dinkman. Yeah--thanks--no idea how sensitive people are when you get their names wrong. Dinkmans phoned the firedepartment. Can't get out. Rescue any minute--got to cover that--imperative--TRAPPED IN HOME BY FREAK LAWN--and nail down your scientist at the same time.\"  I was very anxious myself to see what would happen here so I suggested, since I could take him to the discoverer of the Metamorphizer any time, that we'd better stay and get the Dinkman story first. With overenthusiastic praise of my acuteness, he agreed and began practicing his sleightofhand tricks to the great pleasure of some children, the same ones, I suspect, who had plagued me when I was spraying the lawn.  His performance was terminated by the rapidly approaching firesiren. The crowd seemed of several minds about the purpose of the red truck squealing around the corner to a stop. Some, like Gootes, had heard the Dinkmans were indeed trapped in the house; others declared the firemen had come to cut away the grass onceandforall; still others held the loud opinion that the swift growth had generated a spontaneous combustion.  But having made their abrupt face-in-the-ground halt, the truck (or rather the firemen on it) anticlimactically did nothing at all. Helmeted and accoutered, ready for instant action, they relaxed contentedly against the engine, oblivious of grass, bystanders, or presumable emergency. Gootes strolled over to inquire the cause of their indolence. \"Waiting for the chief,\" he was informed. Thereupon he borrowed a helmet (possibly on the strength of his presscard) and proceeded to pull from it such a variety of objects that he received the final accolade from several of his audience when they told him admiringly he ought to be on the stage.  The bystanders were not seduced by this entertainment into approval of the firemen's idleness and inquired sarcastically why they had left their cots behind or if they thought they were still on WPA? The men remained impervious until the chief jumped out of his red roadster and surveyed the scene napoleonically. \"Thought somebody was pulling a rib,\" he explained to no one in particular. \"All right, boys, there's folks in that house--let's get them out.\"  Carrying a ladder the men plunged toward the house. Their boots trod the sprawling runners heavily, spurning and crushing them carelessly. The grass responded by flowing back like water, sloshing over ankles and lapping at calves, thoroughly entangling and impeding progress. Panting and struggling the firemen penetrated only a short way into the mass before they were slowed almost to a standstill. From the sidelines it seemed as though they were wrestling with an invisible octopus. Feet were lifted high, but never free of the twining vegetation; the ladder was pulled angrily forward, but the clutch of the grass upon it became firmer with every tug.  At length they were halted, although their efforts still gave an appearance of advance. Thrashing and wrenching they urged themselves and the now burdensome ladder against the invincible wall. The only result was to give the illusion they were burying themselves in the clutching tentacles. Exertions dwindled; the struggle grew less intense; then they retreated, fighting their way out of the enveloping mass in a panic of desperation, abandoning the ladder.  The chief surveyed them with less than approbation. \"Cut your way in,\" he ordered. \"You guys think those axes are only to bust up furniture with?\"  Obediently, wedges of bright steel flashed against the green wall.  \"Impatiently I await the rescue of fair Dinkmans from this enchanted keep,\" murmured Gootes, vainly trying to balance his pipe on the back of his hand.  It looked as though he would have to contain his impatience for some time. The firemen slashed unenthusiastically at the grass, which gave way only grudgingly and by inches. Halfanhour later they triumphantly dragged out the abandoned ladder. \"Stuff's like rubber--bounds back instead of cutting.\"  \"Yeah. And in the meantime those people been telephoning again. Want to know what the delay is. Want to know what they pay taxes for. Threaten to sue the city.\"  \"Let'm sue. Long as theyre in there they can't collect.\"  \"Funny as a flat tire. Get going, goldbrick.\"   _9._ Another firetruck rolled up and there was much kidding back and forth between the two crews. This was clearly no situation in which lives or property were at stake; it was rather in line with assisting distraught cats down from tops of telephonepoles or persuading selfimmolated children to unlock the bathroom door and let mommy in; an amusing interval in a tense day. Perhaps those manning the second truck were more naturally ingenious, possibly the original workers sought more diverting labor; at any rate the futile chopping was abandoned. Instead, several long ladders were hooked together and the synthesis lowered from the curb to "]]]
