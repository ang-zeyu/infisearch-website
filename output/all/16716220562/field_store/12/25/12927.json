He passed his tape around his customers and jotted down figures on flat, black stones as fast as he could make his fingers fly. And if it hadn't been for just one thing Ferdinand Frog would have been quite happy. But beginning with his first customer, he was somewhat troubled; for in the whole company he found not one who had brought his pocket-book with him.  \"What's the matter?\" he asked Grandaddy Beaver, when the old gentleman's turn came. \"Didn't you tell 'em what I said about pocket-books?\"  \"I certainly did!\" Grandaddy replied. \"I told them to be sure to leave their pocket-books at home.\"  Mr. Frog gulped once or twice, as if he were swallowing something unpleasant. And he looked most surprised.  \"Why, that's exactly wrong!\" he cried.  \"Is that so?\" Grandaddy Beaver quavered. \"Then I must have made a mistake. You know I'm a _leetle_ hard of hearing.\"  \"Never mind!\" Ferdinand Frog answered, for he always took his troubles lightly. \"Bring 'em when you come to have your clothes fitted and it'll be all right.\"  So he worked on. But by and by he began to grow uneasy again. And now and then he paused and went to the window, where he peered somewhat anxiously at the Beavers who waited before his door in a long line.  \"It's queer!\" Mr. Frog exclaimed aloud at last. \"Here I've been measuring 'em for an hour and a half; and there's just as many of 'em left. . . . I'll have to stop soon,\" he continued, \"for I'm going to a singing-party to-night. And I don't want to be late.\"  His customers, however, wouldn't hear of his leaving. The moment Mr. Frog's remarks passed down the line, the Beaver family began to jostle and push one another. They crowded inside the tailor's shop.  And to get rid of them, Mr. Frog worked faster than ever. So great was his haste that he measured everybody wrong; whereas before he had measured them correctly, while merely scratching wrong figures upon the stones.  And finally he stopped suddenly. As Grandaddy Beaver stepped forward to be measured for the fourth time it dawned upon Mr. Frog that he had measured him several times already.  But Ferdinand Frog said nothing at all.  Holding one end of his tape in his mouth, he passed the other end around Grandaddy's plump body.  All at once a cry of dismay came from the customers who were looking on while they waited.  \"He's swallowing the tape!\" they cried, pointing to Mr. Frog.  It was true. Beneath their horrified gaze the tape-measure disappeared little by little inside Mr. Frog's mouth. And before any of them could come to his senses and seize the end of the yellow strip, it had vanished from view completely.  Of course they saw that the tailor could work no longer that evening. So they filed sadly out of the shop.  \"How did it happen?\" they asked Mr. Frog, who was already locking his door.  \"The tape stuck to my tongue,\" he explained. \"Everything does, you know. But it doesn't matter, because I was hungry. And now I feel better.\"  So Mr. Frog reached the singing-party in time, after all.     XIV  AN UNPLEASANT MIX-UP   For a long time after he took the measurements of the Beaver family Mr. Frog kept carefully out of sight. Though several of the Beavers visited his shop every day, they always found the door locked and the shades drawn. But from various odd sounds--such as giggles and titters and snickers--which they heard by listening at the keyhole, they knew that the tailor was inside.  To all their knocks and calls, however, Mr. Frog made no other response. He was working busily, and he did not want to be interrupted.  At last, to the delight of everybody, a notice appeared one evening upon Mr. Frog's door, which said:          TO-MORROW WILL BE            FITTING-DAY  Well, never was such excitement known in the Beaver family--unless it was when the great freshet came, and almost washed away the dam. And it was lucky there was no freshet upon Mr. Frog's fitting-day, for there would have been no one except the women and children to do any work. Some of the young dandies even spent the night right in front of Mr. Frog's tailor's shop, in order to be among the first to try on their new clothes, which were to be five years ahead of the times.  When Mr. Frog opened his door bright and early the following morning he had to beg his eager customers to keep order.  \"There's a suit here for everybody,\" he announced. \"But if you crowd into my shop I may get the garments mixed. And that would be terrible.\"  So the Beaver gentlemen were as quiet and orderly as they could be. But as for Mr. Frog himself, he jumped around as if he were standing in a hot frying-pan. He hustled his customers into their suits in no time, assuring each one that his garments fitted him perfectly, and asking him please to step out through the back door and wait.  By the time the last Beaver had on his new clothes, and Mr. Frog followed him into the back-yard, the tailor found that there was a frightful uproar outside. There wasn't one of the Beavers who didn't claim that there was something wrong about his new clothes. But whether sleeves, trousers or coat-tails were too short or too long, or whether they were too loose or too tight, Mr. Frog declared that they were exactly as they should be, because they were bound to be in style in five years' time, and nobody--so he said--could prove otherwise.  Of course, the Beaver family was far from satisfied. Though they had what they had been wishing for, they couldn't help thinking that they looked very queer--as, indeed, they did.  But Ferdinand Frog told the crowd that it was only because they weren't used to being dressed in that fashion. He said he certainly was pleased with their appearance and that he had never seen any company that looked the least bit like them.  There was one Beaver, however, who shouted angrily that he knew his suit wasn't fashionable and that he wouldn't accept it.     XV  EVERYONE IS HAPPY   Mr. Frog led the angry Beaver around to the front of his shop, while the others followed, and pointed to his sign.  \"There!\" he said. \"Don't you see that I _claim_ to be an unfashionable tailor? You'll have to keep that suit, and pay me for it, too. And so will everybody else.\"  But the whole Beaver family cried out that they objected. \"No one ever pays his tailor,\" they told Mr. Frog. \"It's not the fashionable thing to do.\"  Even then Ferdinand Frog continued to smile at them. He was such an agreeable chap!  \"I know it's not fashionable now,\" he admitted, \"but it will be five years from now. And since it's my way to collect on delivery, I'll thank you to step up one at a time and pay me. . . . And please don't crowd!\" he added.  There was really no need of that last warning, because nobody made a move.  Mr. Frog, however, was not dismayed. He leaped suddenly into the air and alighted directly in front of a Beaver known among his friends as Stingy Steve--the very one to whom Mr. Frog had just shown his sign.  \"Pay up, please!\" Ferdinand Frog said.  \"How much do I owe you?\" the uneasy Beaver asked him.  \"Sixty!\" Mr. Frog told him, with a grin.  Stingy Steve thrust his hand inside the pocket of his new trousers, from which he slowly drew one of Mr. Frog's tape-measures--of which the tailor had at least a dozen. Mr. Frog was always tucking them away in odd places.  \"Here!\" Stingy Steve cried. \"Here's your pay--sixty inches, neither more nor less!\"  But Ferdinand Frog only laughed and told him that he didn't mean _inches_. That, he explained, was no pay at all.  \"I know,\" Stingy Steve replied. \"I know it's not the fashionable way to pay a bill at present. But it will be five years from now. And what's more, you can't prove that what I say isn't true.\"  For a few moments Mr. Frog stood there gasping. And pretty soon he noticed that his customers were all busily picking up chips and sticks and pebbles. At first he thought they were going to throw them at him; and he was all ready to jump.  But he soon found that he was mistaken.  \"Here! Here's your pay, Mr. Frog!\" they began to cry. And to their astonishment Mr. Frog began to laugh.  \"I don't want any pay,\" he declared. \"Will you all promise to wear your new clothes if I make them free?\"  \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" sounded on all sides.  \"Then it's a bargain!\" Ferdinand Frog shouted. And he leaped into the air and kicked his heels together three times.  After that he turned a back somersault, and then he rolled over and over until he landed with a great splash in the pond.  Deep down on the muddy bottom Mr. Frog laughed as if he could never stop. The Beavers on the bank could neither see nor hear him. And he knew there was no danger of their thinking him impolite, especially when he said:  \"They don't even know that I've played a trick on them! And what a terrible sight they are! I've never seen any company that looked the least bit like them.\"     XVI  STOP THAT!   On a cool summer's morning Ferdinand Frog was sitting among the reeds near the bank of the pond when a harsh voice suddenly said:  \"Stop that!\"  Looking up, Mr. Frog saw a huge bird standing on one leg in the water, watching him. The stranger was actually so big that Mr. Frog hadn't noticed him.  To be sure, he had seen what he thought was a stick stuck upright in the muddy bottom of the pond. That was really the stranger's leg; but Mr. Frog hadn't taken the trouble to glance upwards and see what was at the top of it.  Of course, Mr. Frog was frightened as soon as he discovered his mistake, for the bird had a great, long bill. Without being told, Ferdinand Frog knew that that bill could open like a trap--and seize him, too. But he showed not the least sign that he was even disturbed.  \"Stop that, I say!\" the stranger repeated, before Mr. Frog had so much as said a word.  \"Stop what?\" Mr. Frog asked.  \"Stop sticking your tongue out at me!\" the other commanded.  In spite of his alarm, when he heard that Ferdinand Frog began to laugh.  \"I beg"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24590"],["title","The Tale of Ferdinand Frog (#5)"],["body","pardon,\" he said, \"but I think you are mistaken. I wasn't sticking my tongue out at you. I was only catching flies.\" Mr. Frog paid no attention to the sneering laugh that the stranger gave. \"You see,\" he went on, \"I'm having my breakfast. And this is how I manage it: I wait here without moving until a fly comes my way. Then I dart my tongue at him as quick as lightning.  \"My tongue,\" Mr. Frog explained, \"is fastened at the front of my mouth instead of at the back. So I can often reach a fly when he thinks he's perfectly safe. And furthermore, my tongue is so sticky that if it touches a fly, he can't get away. Then I swallow that one and wait for another.\"  \"A likely story!\" the big bird scoffed. \"I've been watching you for a long time (Mr. Frog shivered when he heard that!) and I know what I'm talking about. . . . There you go again!\" he shrieked angrily, as Ferdinand Frog's tongue flew out and captured another fly so quickly that the stranger couldn't see just what had happened.  \"Listen to me a moment!\" Mr. Frog said. \"Like most people, I have to eat. And when I eat I can't help sticking out my tongue. So I'd suggest that if you don't care to watch me at my breakfast you'd better go away. It certainly isn't my fault that you're standing right in front of me.\"  But the stranger declined to move.  \"If you really meant to be polite,\" he grumbled, \"you'd at least turn your back when you stick out your tongue.\"  But Mr. Frog never stirred. He was afraid that the moment he turned his back the big bird would pounce upon him.  \"It's not necessary for me to turn around now,\" he explained. \"I've finished my breakfast. And I hope you've had yours, too.\"  [Illustration: Grand-daddy Beaver Appeals to Mr. Frog]  \"I'm sorry to say that I have,\" the stranger answered with a sigh, as he looked longingly at plump Mr. Frog. \"I couldn't eat another mouthful if it sat right in front of me.\"  And then Ferdinand Frog felt as if a great weight had been lifted from his mind. He smiled all over his face, to show the stranger that he was glad to see him.  \"Ah!\" Mr. Frog cried. \"Then we can have a friendly chat together. I always like to talk with travellers. . . . What a long, sharp bill you have!\"  Now, some people would think that a rude remark. But it seemed to please the stranger immensely.     XVII  A LONG, SHARP BILL   Certainly it was an odd remark that Ferdinand Frog made about the stranger's wicked-looking bill. But knowing that its owner had eaten until he had no appetite left for the time being, Mr. Frog forgot his fear. And he couldn't help being curious about the big bird, because he had never seen another like him.  Of course, what Mr. Frog said would have annoyed some people a good deal, for he had just the same as told the stranger that he had _a long, sharp nose_. But luckily it happened that the newcomer was very vain both of the length and the sharpness of his bill. So he liked Mr. Frog's comment. And he promptly forgot his displeasure over Mr. Frog's tongue.  \"Yes!\" he said, in response to Ferdinand Frog's speech, \"there isn't another bill like mine for twenty miles around--except my wife's.\"  \"You don't live in this neighborhood, do you?\" Mr. Frog inquired.  \"My home is beyond the Second Mountain,\" the stranger informed him.  And Ferdinand Frog was glad to hear that the huge fellow dwelt no nearer.  \"What's your name, friend?\" Mr. Frog then asked.  \"My name----\" the giant bird replied--\"my name is G. B. Heron.\"  \"'G. B.'!\" Mr. Frog exclaimed, turning a pale green color. \"What do those letters stand for? Not Grizzly Bear, I hope!\" He had heard of--but had never seen--a Grizzly Bear; and for a moment he thought that perhaps he had met one at last.  But the stranger soon set his fresh fears at rest.  \"My full name,\" he told Mr. Frog, \"is Great Blue Heron. But plain Mr. Heron will do, when you address me.\"  \"I hope I'll see you sooner the next time we meet,\" Mr. Frog said. And he resolved that he would keep a sharp eye out for Mr. Heron, so that he might have plenty of time to hide the moment he caught sight of him.  \"There's no doubt that we'll meet again,\" Mr. Heron replied. \"I expect to come here to live. And I flew over here to-day to look about a bit. . . . Are there many in your family?\"  \"No!\" Mr. Frog hastened to answer. \"There's only myself living in this pond.\"  \"But you must have plenty of relations somewhere,\" Mr. G. B. Heron insisted. \"If I came here to live, and anything happened to you, I'd want to tell your family.\"  \"Well, I have a few relations, to be sure,\" Mr. Frog admitted. \"But they don't amount to much. They're a stringy lot, I can tell you.\"  Mr. Heron looked at him as if he couldn't quite believe that statement.  \"That's odd,\" he observed. \"Now, you're nice and plump.\"  \"Oh, I'm _too_ fat,\" Ferdinand Frog said. \"Aunt Polly Woodchuck tells me that if I get much fatter I'll lose my good looks.\"  \"I don't agree with her,\" said Mr. Heron. \"You look good to me.\"  And now it was Mr. Frog's turn to be pleased; for he was very vain.  \"I'm glad to hear it!\" he cried. \"And I'll tell you a secret: I've always been quite satisfied with myself until my eyes fell on you. Oh! if I only had such a bill as yours!\"  \"You like my bill, then?\" Mr. Heron asked him.  \"Yes!\" Ferdinand Frog answered. \"And it must be very handy, too.\"  \"What for?\" Mr. Heron inquired.  \"Why, for making button-holes!\" Ferdinand Frog exclaimed.     XVIII  MAKING BUTTON-HOLES   Mr. Heron couldn't help being interested.  \"Button-holes in what?\" he asked Ferdinand Frog.  \"Why, in suits of clothes, of course!\" the tailor answered. \"If you had a tailor's shop, as I have, you'd find that bill of yours a handy thing to have. When you wanted to make a button-hole in a piece of cloth all you'd need do would be to stick your bill through it.\"  \"I'd like to try that,\" Mr. Heron remarked.  \"Then come right over to my shop,\" Mr. Frog urged him. \"I'll let you make all the button-holes you want.\"  \"Very well!\" Mr. Heron agreed. \"I'll make button-holes until I get hungry.\"  \"That's a good idea!\" Mr. Frog cried. And his new friend smiled, for he thought the tailor must be very stupid. He intended to stay with Mr. Frog until he was hungry enough to eat him. And no one who wasn't dull-witted could have failed to grasp his plan.  Well, they started off together; and they arrived shortly afterward at the tailor's shop.  Observing that Mr. Heron was altogether too big to squeeze inside the tiny building, Mr. Frog entered it, to reappear soon with an armful of cloth.  On this Mr. Frog proceeded to mark a row of dots. And then he hung the cloth upon some reeds.  \"There!\" he announced. \"Can you hit the mark?\"  \"Certainly I can,\" Mr. Heron replied. And quick as lightning his sharp bill darted out and made a neat hole exactly where every dot had been.  \"Splendid! Perfect!\" Mr. Frog exclaimed. And thereupon he brought forth more cloth.  In a surprisingly short time Mr. Heron had made eighty-seven button-holes. But Mr. Frog noticed that beginning with the seventy-seventh button-hole the stranger's aim began to fail. He did not hit the dots quite squarely. And he seemed not to have his mind on his work.  \"What's the matter?\" Mr. Frog inquired. \"Are you getting tired?\"  \"No--not tired,\" Mr. Heron told him.  \"Are your eyes troubling you?\" the tailor asked him.  \"No--I can see well enough,\" Mr. Heron replied. \"But I'm beginning to feel a bit faint. And I think I've made enough button-holes for one day.\"  But Mr. Frog said that he had a special suit which he was making for somebody. And he begged Mr. Heron to make the button-holes in that too.  Mr. Heron frowned. But presently he yielded, telling Mr. Frog to hurry, for he had another matter to attend to.  So the tailor leaped into his shop once more. And for a few moments he was very busy, arranging another strip of cloth so that the stranger might make button-holes in it.  When all was ready Mr. Heron stepped up to do his work. He was just about to strike, when he suddenly paused.  \"Who's going to have this suit?\" he asked the tailor.  \"Mr. Fish Hawk,\" said the tailor. \"Do you know him?\"  \"I should say I did!\" Mr. Heron cried. \"And he's no friend of mine, I assure you. I only wish he was behind this cloth! I'd run my bill clean through him!\"  A cold, cruel glitter came into Mr. Heron's eyes. And when he struck, he struck with all his power, as if he were driving his wicked bill through Mr. Fish Hawk that very moment.  He made only that one thrust. And he did not withdraw his bill, either. Instead he set up a terrible squawking and began to flounder about on the bank of the pond.  \"Help! Help!\" he cried in a muffled voice.  But Ferdinand Frog only smiled--and made no move to assist his new acquaintance. The truth of the matter was that he had hidden a block of wood behind the cloth, and Mr. Heron had driven his bill into it so far that he couldn't pull it out.  With a loud chuckle Mr. Frog jumped into the water and swam away. And that very day he moved to Black Creek, without troubling himself to learn how Mr. Heron got himself out of his difficulty.  But the tailor couldn't help thinking what a handy thing it would be to have a bill like Mr. Heron's.  \"He can even make button-holes in wood!\" Mr. Frog exclaimed.     XIX  THE SWIMMING TEACHER   It surprised the wild folk in Pleasant Valley when they learned that Mr. Frog had forsaken the Beaver pond for a new home on the bank of Black Creek.  When his friends asked him why he had moved Mr. Frog told them he had made up his mind that the pond was too damp for the good of his health. Besides, Black Creek was nearer Cedar Swamp, where the Frog family held their singing-parties.  Of course, the real reason for Ferdinand Frog's change of scene was that he was afraid Mr. Heron might return to the Beaver pond some day, to look for him.  And when that happened, Mr. Frog did not care to be there.  In his new home, however, he felt quite at his ease. And he set out at once to "]]]
