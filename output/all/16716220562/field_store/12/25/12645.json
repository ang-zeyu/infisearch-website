Myra warded it off with a leg as she neared it; with both hands I helped it into the deep snow from which it had shown a tendency to emerge; Miss Cardew put a foot out at it for safety; and Thomas patted it gently on the head as the end of the \"tail\" went past....  As soon as we had recovered our powers of speech--all except Miss Cardew, who was in hysterics--we called upon Gaspard to stop. He indicated with the back of his neck that it would be dangerous to stop just then; and it was not until we were at the bottom of the hill, nearly a mile from the place where Simpson left us, that the procession halted, and gave itself up again to laughter.  \"I hope he is not hurt,\" said Dahlia, wiping the tears from her eyes.  \"He wouldn't spoil a good joke like that by getting hurt,\" said Myra confidently. \"He's much too much of a sportsman.\"  \"Why did he do it?\" said Thomas.  \"He suddenly remembered he hadn't packed his safety-razor. He's half-way back to the hotel by now.\"  Miss Cardew remained in hysterics.  Ten minutes later a brilliant sunset was observed approaching from the north. A little later it was seen to be a large dish of apricots and cream.  \"He draws near,\" said Archie. \"Now then, let's be stern with him.\"  At twenty yards' range Simpson began to talk. His trot had heated him slightly.  \"I say,\" he said excitedly. \"You----\"  Myra shook her head at him.  \"Not done, Samuel,\" she said reproachfully.  \"Not what, Myra? What not----\"  \"You oughtn't to leave us like that without telling us.\"  \"After all,\" said Archie, \"we are all one party, and we are supposed to keep together. If you prefer to go about by yourself, that's all right; but if we go to the trouble of arranging something for the whole party----\"  \"You might have caused a very nasty accident,\" I pointed out. \"If you were in a hurry, you had only to say a word to Gaspard and he would have stopped for you to alight. Now I begin to understand why you kept cutting the rope at the start.\"  \"You have sent Miss Cardew into hysterics by your conduct,\" said Dahlia.  Miss Cardew gave another peal. Simpson looked at her in dismay.  \"I say, Miss Cardew, I'm most awfully sorry. I really didn't---- I say, Dahlia,\" he went on confidentially, \"oughtn't we to do something about this? Rub her feet with snow or--I mean, I know there's _something_ you do when people have hysterics. It's rather serious if they go on. Don't you burn feathers under their nose?\" He began to feel in his pockets. \"I wonder if Gaspard's got a feather?\"  With a great effort Miss Cardew pulled herself together. \"It's all right, thank you,\" she said in a stifled voice.  \"Then let's get on,\" said Archie.  We resumed our seats once more. Archie took Dahlia's feet on his lap. Myra took mine. Miss Cardew took Thomas's. Simpson clung tight to his luge with both hands.  \"Right!\" cried Archie.  Gaspard swore at his horses. They pulled bravely. The rope snapped--and they trotted gaily up the hill with Gaspard.  We hurried after them with the luges....   VI.--A HAPPY ENDING  \"For our last night they might at least have had a dance,\" said Myra, \"even if there was no public presentation.\"  \"As we had hoped,\" I admitted.  \"What is a gymkhana, anyway?\" asked Thomas.  \"A few little competitions,\" said Archie. \"One must cater for the chaperons sometimes. You are all entered for the Hat-making and the Feather-blowing--Dahlia thought it would amuse you.\"  \"At Cambridge,\" I said reminiscently, \"I once blew the feather 119 feet 7 inches. Unfortunately I stepped outside the circle. My official record is 2 feet.\"  \"Did you ever trim a hat at Cambridge?\" asked Myra. \"Because you've got to do one for me to-night.\"  I had not expected this. My view of the competition had been that _I_ should have to provide the face and that _she_ would have to invent some suitable frame for it.  \"I'm full of ideas,\" I lied.  Nine o'clock found a small row of us prepared to blow the feather. The presidential instructions were that we had to race our feather across a chalk-line at the end of the room, anybody touching his feather to be disqualified.  \"In the air or on the floor?\" asked Simpson earnestly.  \"Just as you like,\" said the President kindly, and came round with the bag.  I selected Percy with care--a dear little feather about half an inch long and of a delicate whity-brown colour. I should have known him again anywhere.  \"Go!\" said the President. I was rather excited, with the result that my first blow was much too powerful for Percy. He shot up to the ceiling and, in spite of all I could do, seemed inclined to stay there. Anxiously I waited below with my mouth open; he came slowly down at last; and in my eagerness I played my second just a shade too soon. It missed him. My third (when I was ready for it) went harmlessly over his head. A frantic fourth and fifth helped him downwards ... and in another moment my beautiful Percy was on the floor. I dropped on my knees and played my sixth vigorously. He swirled to the left; I was after him like a shot ... and crashed into Thomas. We rolled over in a heap.  \"Sorry!\" we apologized as we got back on to our hands and knees.  Thomas went on blowing.  \"Where's my feather?\" I said.  Thomas was now two yards ahead, blowing like anything. A terrible suspicion darted through my mind.  \"Thomas,\" I said, \"you've got my feather.\"  He made no answer. I scrambled after him.  \"That's Percy,\" I said. \"I should know him anywhere. You're blowing Percy. It's very bad form to blow another man's feather. If it got about, you would be cut by the county. Give me back my feather, Thomas.\"  \"How do you know it's your feather?\" he said truculently. \"Feathers are just alike.\"  \"How do I know?\" I asked in amazement. \"A feather that I've brought up from the egg? Of course I know Percy.\" I leant down to him. \"_P--percy_,\" I whispered. He darted forward a good six inches. \"You see,\" I said, \"he knows his name.\"  \"As a matter of fact,\" said Thomas, \"his name's _P--paul_. Look, I'll show you.\"  \"You needn't bother, Thomas,\" I said hastily. \"This is mere trifling. I _know_ that's my feather. I remember his profile distinctly.\"  \"Then where's mine?\"  \"How do I know? You may have swallowed it. Go away and leave Percy and me to ourselves. You're only spoiling the knees of your trousers by staying here.\"  \"Paul and I----\" began Thomas.  He was interrupted by a burst of applause. Dahlia had cajoled her feather over the line first. Thomas rose and brushed himself. \"You can 'ave him,\" he said.  \"There!\" I said, as I picked Percy up and placed him reverently in my waistcoat pocket. \"That shows that he was mine. If he had been your own little Paul you would have loved him even in defeat. Oh, musical chairs now? Right-o.\" And at the President's touch I retired from the arena.  We had not entered for musical chairs. Personally I should have liked to, but it was felt that, if none of us did, then it would be more easy to stop Simpson doing so. For at musical chairs Simpson is--I am afraid there is only one word for it; it is a word that I hesitate to use, but the truth must prevail--Simpson is _rough_. He _lets himself go_. He plays _all he knows_. Whenever I take Simpson out anywhere I always whisper to my hostess, \"_Not_ musical chairs.\"  The last event of the evening was the hat-making competition. Each man of us was provided with five large sheets of coloured crinkly paper, a packet of pins, a pair of scissors, and a lady opposite to him.  \"Have you any plans at all?\" asked Myra.  \"Heaps. Tell me, what sort of hat would you like? Something for the Park?\" I doubled up a piece of blue paper and looked at it. \"You know, if this is a success, Myra, I shall often make your hats for you.\"  Five minutes later I had what I believe is called a \"foundation.\" Anyhow, it was something for Myra to put her head into.  \"Our very latest Bond Street model,\" said Myra. \"Only fifteen guineas--or three-and-ninepence if you buy it at our other establishment in Battersea.\"  \"Now then, I can get going,\" I said, and I began to cut out a white feather. \"Yes, your ladyship, this is from the genuine bird on our own ostrich farm in the Fulham Road. Plucked while the ingenuous biped had its head in the sand. I shall put that round the brim,\" and I pinned it round.  \"What about a few roses?\" said Myra, fingering the red paper.  \"The roses are going there on the right.\" I pinned them on. \"And a humming-bird and some violets next to them.... I say, I've got a lot of paper over. What about a nice piece of cabbage ... there ... and a bunch of asparagus ... and some tomatoes and a seagull's wing on the left. The back still looks rather bare--let's have some poppies.\"  \"There's only three minutes more,\" said Myra, \"and you haven't used all the paper yet.\"  \"I've got about one William Allan Richardson and a couple of canaries over,\" I said, after examining my stock. \"Let's put it inside as lining. There, Myra, my dear, I'm proud of you. I always say that in a nice quiet hat nobody looks prettier than you.\"  \"Time!\" said the President.  Anxious matrons prowled round us.  \"We don't know any of the judges,\" I whispered. \"This isn't fair.\"  The matrons conferred with the President. He cleared his throat. \"The first prize,\" he said, \"goes to----\"  But I had swooned.         .       .       .       .       .  \"Well,\" said Archie, \"the Rabbits return to England with two cups won on the snowfields of Switzerland.\"  \"Nobody need know,\" said Myra, \"_which_ winter-sport they were won at.\"  \"Unless I have 'Ski-ing, First Prize' engraved on mine,\" I said, \"as I had rather intended.\"  \"Then I shall have 'Figure-Skating' on mine,\" said Dahlia.  \"Two cups,\" reflected Archie, \"and Thomas engaged to three charming girls. I think it has been worth it, you know.\"     A BAKER'S DOZEN     A TRAGEDY IN LITTLE   The great question of the day is, What will become of Sidney? Whenever I think of him now, the unbidden"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24313"],["title","Once a Week (#8)"],["body","wells into my eye ... and wells down my cheek ... and wells on to my collar. My friends think I have a cold, and offer me lozenges; but it is Sidney who makes me weep. I fear that I am about to lose him.  He came into my life in the following way.  Some months ago I wanted to buy some silk stockings; not for myself, for I seldom wear them, but for a sister. The idea came suddenly to me that any woman with a brother and a birthday would simply love the one to give her silk stockings for the other. But, of course, they would have to be the right silk stockings--the fashionable shape for the year, the correct assortment of clocks, and so forth. Then as to material--could I be sure I was getting silk, and not silkette or something inferior? How maddening if, seeing that I was an unprotected man, they palmed off Jaeger on me! Clearly this was a case for outside assistance. So I called in Celia.  \"This,\" I said to her, \"is practically the only subject on which I am not an expert. At the same time I have a distinct feeling for silk stockings. If you can hurry me past all the embarrassing counters safely, and arrange for the lady behind the right one to show me the right line in silken hose, I will undertake to pick out half a dozen pairs that would melt any sister's heart.\"  Well, the affair went off perfectly. Celia took the matter into her own hands and behaved just as if I were buying them for _her_. The shop-assistant also behaved as if I were. Fortunately I kept my head when it came to giving the name and address. \"No,\" I said firmly to Celia. \"Not yours; my sister's.\" And I dragged her away to tea.  Now whether it was because Celia had particularly enjoyed her afternoon; or because she felt that a man who was as ignorant as I about silk stockings must lead a very lonely life; or because I had mentioned casually and erroneously that it was my own birthday that week, I cannot say; but on the following morning I received a little box, with a note on the outside which said in her handwriting, \"Something for you. Be kind to him.\" And I opened it and found Sidney.  He was a Japanese dwarf-tree--the merest boy. At eighty or ninety, according to the photographs, he would be a stalwart fellow with thick bark on his trunk, and fir-cones or acorns (or whatever was his speciality) hanging all over him. Just at present he was barely ten. I had only eighty years to wait before he reached his prime.  Naturally I decided to lavish all my care upon his upbringing. I would water him after breakfast every morning, and (when I remembered it) at night. If there was any top-dressing he particularly fancied, he should have it. If he had any dead leaves to snip off, I would snip them.  It was at this moment that I discovered something else in the box--a card of instructions. I have not got it now, and I have forgotten the actual wording, but the spirit of it was this:      HINTS ON THE PROPER REARING AND BRINGING-UP OF A JAPANESE DWARF-TREE      The life of this tree is a precarious one, and if it is to be     successfully brought to manhood the following rules must be     carefully observed--      I. This tree requires, above all else, fresh air and exercise.      II. Whenever the sun is shining, the tree should be placed outside,     in a position where it can absorb the rays.      III. Whenever the rain is raining, it should be placed outside, in a     position where it can absorb the wet.      IV. It should be taken out for a trot at least once every day.      V. It simply loathes artificial light and artificial heat. If you     keep it in your drawing-room, see that it is situated as far as     possible from the chandelier and the gas-stove.      VI. It also detests noise. Do not place it on the top of the     pianola.      VII. It loves moonlight. Leave it outside when you go to bed, in     case the moon should come out.      VIII. On the other hand, it hates lightning. Cover it up with the     canary's cloth when the lightning begins.      IX. If it shows signs of drooping, a course of massage will     generally bring it round.      X. But in no case offer it buns.  Well, I read these instructions carefully, and saw at once that I should have to hand over the business of rearing Sidney to another. I have my living to earn the same as anybody else, and I should never get any work done at all if I had constantly to be rushing home from the office on the plea that it was time for Master Sidney's sun-bath.  So I called up my housekeeper, and placed the matter before her.  I said: \"Let me introduce you to Sidney. He is very dear to me; dearer to me than a--a brother. No, on second thoughts my brother is perhaps--well, anyhow, Sidney is very dear to me. I will show my trust in you by asking you to tend him for me. Here are a few notes about his health. Frankly he is delicate. But the doctors have hope. With care, they think, he may live to be a hundred-and-fifty. His future is in your hands.\"  My housekeeper thanked me for this mark of esteem and took the card of instructions away with her. I asked her for it a week afterwards and it appeared that, having committed the rules to memory, she had lost it. But that she follows the instructions I have no doubt; and certainly she and Sidney understand each other's ways exactly. Automatically she gives him his bath, his massage, his run in the park. When it rains or snows or shines, she knows exactly what to do with Sidney.  But as a consequence I see little of him. I suppose it must always be so; we parents must make these sacrifices for our children. Think of a mother only seeing her eldest-born for fifteen weeks a year through the long period of his schooling; and think of me, doomed to catch only the most casual glimpses of Sidney until he is ninety.  For, you know, I might almost say that I never see him at all now. As I go to my work I may, if I am lucky, get a fleeting glance of him on the tiles, where he sits drinking in the rain or sun. In the evening, when I return, he is either out in the moonlight or, if indoors, shunning the artificial light with the cloth over his head. Indeed, the only times when I really see him to talk to are when Celia comes to tea with me. Then my housekeeper hurries him in from his walk or his sun-bath, and puts him, brushed and manicured, on my desk; and Celia and I whisper fond nothings to him. I believe Celia thinks he lives there!         .       .       .       .       .  As I began by saying, I weep for Sidney's approaching end. For my housekeeper leaves this week. A new one takes her place. How will she treat my poor Sidney? The old card of instructions is lost; what can I give her in its place? The legend that Sidney's is a precious life--that he must have his morning bath, his run, his glass of hot water after meals! She would laugh at it. Besides, she may not be at all the sort of foster-mother for a Japanese dwarf-tree....  It will break my heart if Sidney dies now, for I had so looked forward to celebrating his ninetieth birthday with him. It will hurt Celia too. But _her_ grief, of course, will be an inferior affair. In fact, a couple of pairs of silk stockings will help her to forget him altogether.     THE FINANCIER. I   This is how I became a West African mining magnate with a stake in the Empire.  During February I grew suddenly tired of waiting for the summer to begin. London in the summer is a pleasant place, and chiefly so because you can keep on buying evening papers to see what Kent is doing. In February life has no such excitements to offer. So I wrote to my solicitor about it.  \"I want you\" (I wrote) \"to buy me fifty rubber shares, so that I can watch them go up and down.\" And I added \"Brokerage 1/8\" to show that I knew what I was talking about.  He replied tersely as follows:--  \"Don't be a fool. If you have any money to invest I can get you a safe mortgage at five per cent. Let me know.\"  It's a funny thing how the minds of solicitors run upon mortgages. If they would only stop to think for a moment they would see that you couldn't possibly watch a safe mortgage go up and down. I left my solicitor alone and consulted Henry on the subject. In the intervals between golf and golf Henry dabbles in finance.  \"You don't want anything gilt-edged, I gather?\" he said. It's wonderful how they talk.  \"I want it to go up and down,\" I explained patiently, and I indicated the required movement with my umbrella.  \"What about a little flutter in oil?\" he went on, just like a financier in a novel.  \"I'll have a little flutter in raspberry jam if you like. Anything as long as I can rush every night for the last edition of the evening papers and say now and then, 'Good heavens, I'm ruined.'\"  \"Then you'd better try a gold-mine,\" said Henry bitterly, in the voice of one who had tried. \"Take your choice,\" and he threw the paper over to me.  \"I don't want a whole mine--only a vein or two. Yes, this is very interesting,\" I went on, as I got among the West Africans. \"The scoring seems to be pretty low; I suppose it must have been a wet wicket. 'H.E. Reef, 1-3/4, 2'--he did a little better in the second innings. '1/2, Boffin River, 5/16, 7/16'--they followed on, you see, but they saved the innings defeat. By the way, which figure do I really keep my eye on when I want to watch them go up and down?\"  \"Both. One eye on each. And don't talk about Boffin River to me.\"  \"Is it like that, Henry? I am sorry. I suppose it's too late now to offer you a safe mortgage at five per cent? I know a man who has some. Well, perhaps you're right.\"  On the next day I became a magnate. The Jaguar Mine was the one I fixed upon--for two reasons. First, the figure immediately after it was 1, which struck me as a good point from which to watch it go up and down. Secondly, I met a man at lunch who knew somebody who had actually seen the Jaguar Mine.  \"He says that there's no doubt about there being lots there.\"  \"Lots of what? Jaguars or gold?\"  \"Ah, he didn't say."]]]
