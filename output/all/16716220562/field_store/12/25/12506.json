He set his alarm clock for 4:00 a.m. and dropped immediately into a deep and exhausted sleep.  When he and the sleepy-eyed Peterson went into the chicken house at 4:30, there were eleven of the golden eggs resting on the straw nests.  They turned the remainder of the normal eggs over to Hetty who whipped up a fast and enormous breakfast. While Peterson and Johnny were eating, a writing team of AEC public information men who had arrived during the night, were polishing a formal press release to be given to the waiting reporters at eight. The phones had been manned throughout the night. Peterson's bleary-eyed aide came into the kitchen and slumped into a chair at the table.  \"Get yourself a cup of coffee, boy,\" Hetty ordered, \"while I fix you something to eat. How you like your eggs?\"  \"Over easy, Mrs. Thompson and thanks,\" he said wearily. \"I think I've got everything lined up, doctor. The eggs are all packed, ready to go in your car and the car will be ready in about ten minutes. They're still setting up down range but they should be all in order by the time you get there.  \"The bio men and the others should be assembled in the main briefing room at range headquarters. I've ordered a double guard around the barn, to be maintained until the animal boys have finished their on-the-ground tests. And they're padding a device van to take Sally to the labs when they're ready.  \"And ... oh yeah, I almost forgot ... the commissioner called about ten minutes ago and said to tell you that the Russians are going to make a formal protest to the U.N. this morning. They say we're trying to wipe out the People's Republic by contaminating their milk.\"  The sound of scuffling in the yard and loud yells of protest came through the back porch window. The door swung open and a spluttering and irate Barney was thrust into the room, still in the clutches of a pair of armed security policemen.  \"Get your hands offn me,\" Barney roared as he struggled and squirmed impotently in their grip. \"Doc, tell these pistol-packing bellhops to turn me loose.\"  \"We caught him trying to get into the barn, sir,\" one of the officers told Peterson.  \"Of course I was going into the barn,\" the indignant ranch hand screamed. \"Where'd you think I would go to milk a cow?\"  Peterson smiled. \"It's all right, Fred. It's my fault. I should have told you Mr. Hatfield has free access.\"  The security men released Barney. He shook himself and glared at them.  \"I'm terribly, sorry, Barney,\" Dr. Peterson said. \"I forgot that you would be going down to milk the cows and I'm glad you reminded me. Do me a favor and milk Sally first, will you? I want to take that milk, or whatever it is, with us when we leave in a few minutes.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  The sun was crawling up the side of the mountains when Johnny and Dr. Peterson swung out of the ranch yard between two armored scout cars for the sixty-mile trip down the range road. Dew glistened in the early rays of light and the clear, cool morning air held little hint of the heat sure to come by midmorning. There was a rush of photographers towards the gate as the little convoy left the ranch. A battery of cameras grabbed shots of the vehicles heading south.  It was the beginning of a day that changed the entire foreign policy of the United States. It was also the day that started a host of the nation's finest nuclear physicists tottering towards psychiatrists' couches.  In rapid order in the next few days, Peterson's crew reinforced by hundreds of fellow scientists, technicians and military men, learned what Johnny Culpepper already knew.  They learned that (1) Sally's milk, diluted by as much as four hundred parts of pure water, made a better fuel than gasoline when ignited.  They also learned that (2) in reduced degrees of concentration, it became a substitute for any explosive of known chemical composition; (3) brought in contact with the compound inside one of the golden eggs, it produced an explosive starting at the kiloton level of one egg to two cups of milk and went up the scale but leveled off at a peak as the recipe was increased; (4) could be controlled by mixing jets to produce any desired stream of explosive power; and (5) they didn't have the wildest idea what was causing the reaction.  In that same order it brought (1) Standard Oil stock down to the value of wallpaper; (2) ditto for DuPont; (3) a new purge in the top level of the Supreme Soviet; (4) delight to rocketeers at Holloman Air Force Research Center, Cape Canaveral and Vandenburg Air Force Base; and (5) agonizing fits of hair-tearing to every chemist, biologist and physicist who had a part in the futile attempts to analyze the two ingredients of what the press had labeled \"Thompson's Eggnog.\"  While white-coated veterinarians, agricultural experts and chemists prodded and poked Sally's Cloverdale Marathon III, others were giving a similar going-over to Hetty's chicken flock. Solomon's outraged screams of anger echoed across the desert as they subjected him to fowl indignities never before endured by a rooster.  Weeks passed and with each one new experiments disclosed new uses for the amazing Eggnog. While Sally placidly chewed her cuds and continued to give a steady five gallons of concentrated fury at each milking, Solomon's harem dutifully deposited from five to a dozen golden spheres of packaged power every day. At the same time, rocket research engineers completed their tests on the use of the Eggnog.                       *      *      *      *      *  In the early hours of June 4th, a single-stage, two-egg, thirty-five gallon Atlas rocket poised on the launching pads at Cape Canaveral. From the loud-speaker atop the massive block-house came the countdown.  \"X minus twenty seconds. X minus ten seconds. Nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ... three ... two ... FIRE!\"  The control officer stabbed the firing button and deep within the Atlas a relay clicked, activating a solenoid that pushed open a valve. A thin stream of Sally's milk shot in from one side of the firing chamber to blend with a fine spray of egg, batter coming from a jet in the opposite wall.  Spewing a solid tail of purple fire, the Atlas leaped like a wasp-stung heifer from the launching pads and thundered into space. The fuel orifices continued to expand to maximum pre-set opening. In ten seconds the nose cone turned from cherry-red to white heat and began sloughing its outer ceramic coating. At slightly more than forty-three thousand miles an hour, the great missile cleaved out of atmosphere into the void of space, leaving a shock wave that cracked houses and shattered glass for fifty miles from launching point.  A week later, America's newest rocket vessel, weighing more than thirty tons and christened _The Egg Nog_, was launched from the opposite coast at Vandenburg. Hastily modified to take the new fuel, the weight and space originally designed for the common garden variety of rocket fuel was filled with automatic camera and television equipment. In its stern stood a six-egg, one-hundred-gallon engine, while in the nose was a small, one-egg, fourteen-quart braking engine to slow it down for the return trip through the atmosphere.  Its destination--Mars!  A week later, _The Eggnog_ braked down through the troposphere, skidded to a piddling two-thousand miles, an hour through the stratosphere, automatically sprouted gliding wing stubs in the atmosphere and planed down to a spraying halt in the Pacific Ocean, fifty miles west of Ensenada in Baja, California. Aboard were man's first views of the red planet.  The world went mad with jubilation. From the capitals of the free nations congratulations poured into Washington. From Moscow came word of a one-hundred-ton spaceship to be launched in a few days, powered by a mixture of vodka and orange juice discovered by a bartender in Novorosk who was studying chemistry in night school. This announcement was followed twenty-four hours later by a story in _Pravda_ proving conclusively that Sally's Cloverdale Marathon III was a direct descendant of Nikita's Mujik Droshky V, a prize Guernsey bull produced in the barns of the Sopolov People's Collective twenty-six years ago.  Late in August, Air Force Major Clifton Wadsworth Quartermain climbed out of the port of the two-hundred-ton, two dozen-egg, two-hundred-thirty gallon space rocket _Icarus_, the first man into space and back. He had circled Venus and returned. No longer limited by fuel weight factors, scientists had been able to load enough shielding into the huge _Icarus_ to protect a man from the deadly bombardment of the Van Allen radiation belts.  On September 15th, Sally's Cloverdale Marathon III, having been milked harder and faster than any Guernsey in history, went dry.  Less than half of the approximately twelve-hundred gallons of fuel she had produced during her hay days, remained on hand in the AEC storage vaults.  Three days later, Solomon, sprinting after one of his harem who was playing hard to get, bee-lined into the path of a security police jeep. There was an agonized squawk, a shower of feathers and mourning. A short time later, the number of golden eggs dropped daily until one morning, there were none. They never reappeared. The United States had stockpiled twenty-six dozen in an underground cave deep in the Rockies.  Man, who had burst like a butterfly into space, crawled back into his cocoon and pondered upon the stars from a worm's eye point of view.                       *      *      *      *      *  Banging around in the back end of a common cattle truck, Sally's Cloverdale Marathon III came home to the Circle T in disgrace. In a corner of the truck, the late Solomon's harem cackled and voiced loud cries of misery as they huddled in the rude, slatted shipping coop. The truck turned off the county road and onto the dirt road leading to the main buildings. It "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24119"],["title","Make Mine Homogenized (#8)"],["body","across the cattle guard and through the new-unprotected and open gate in the barbed wire fence. Life had returned almost to normal at the Circle T.  But not for long.  Five days after Sally's ignominious dismissal from the armed forces, a staff car came racing up to the ranch. It skidded to a halt at the back-porch steps. Dr. Peterson jumped out and dashed up to the kitchen door.  \"Well, for heaven's sake,\" Hetty cried. \"Come on in, sonny. I ain't seen you for the longest spell.\"  Peterson entered and looked around.  \"Where's Johnny, Mrs. Thompson?\" he asked excitedly. \"I've got some wonderful news.\"  \"Now ain't that nice,\" Hetty exclaimed. \"Your wife have a new baby or something? Johnny's down at the barn. I'll call him for you.\" She moved towards the door.  \"Never mind,\" Peterson said, darting out the door, \"I'll go down to the barn.\" He jumped from the porch and ran across the yard.  He found Johnny in the barn, rigging a new block and tackle for the hayloft. Barney was helping thread the new, manila line from a coil on the straw-littered floor.  \"Johnny, we've found it,\" Peterson shouted jubilantly as he burst into the barn.  \"Why, Doc, good to see you again,\" Johnny said. \"Found what?\"  \"The secret of Sally's milk,\" Peterson cried. He looked wildly around the barn. \"Where is she?\"  \"Who?\"  \"Sally, of course,\" the scientist yelped.  \"Oh, she's down in the lower pasture with Queenie,\" Johnny replied.  \"She's all right, isn't she?\" Peterson asked anxiously.  \"Oh, sure, she's fine, Doc. Why?\"  \"Listen,\" Peterson said hurriedly, \"our people think they've stumbled on something. Now we still don't know what's in those eggs or in Sally's milk that make them react as they do. All we've been able to find is some strange isotope but we don't know how to reproduce it or synthesize it.  \"But we do think we know what made Sally give that milk and made those hens start laying the gold eggs.\"  Johnny and Barney laid down their work and motioned the excited scientist to join them on a bench against the horse stalls.  \"Do you remember the day Sally came fresh?\" Peterson continued.  \"Not exactly,\" Johnny replied, \"but I could look it up in my journal. I keep a good record of things like new registered stock births.\"  \"Never mind,\" Peterson said. \"I've already checked. It was May 9th.\"  He paused and smiled triumphantly.  \"I guess that's right if you say so,\" Johnny said. \"But what about it?\"  \"And that was the same day that the hens laid the first golden egg too, wasn't it?\" Peterson asked.  \"Why it sure was, Doc,\" Barney chimed in. \"I remember, cause Miz Thompson was so mad that the milk was bad and the eggs went wrong both in the same day.\"  \"That's what we know. Now listen to this, Johnny,\" the scientist continued. \"During the night of May 8th, we fired an entirely new kind of test shot on the range. I can't tell you what it was, only to say that it was a special atomic device that even we didn't know too much about. That's why we fired it from a cave in the side of a hill down there.  \"Since then, our people have been working on the pretty good assumption that something happened to that cow and those chickens not too long before they started giving the Eggnog ingredients. Someone remembered the experimental test shot, checked the date and then went out and had a look at the cave. We already had some earlier suspicions that this device produced a new type of beam ray. We took sightings from the cave, found them to be in a direct, unbroken line with the Circle T. We set up the device again and using a very small model, tried it out on some chick embryos. Sure enough, we got a mutation. But not the right kind.  \"So we're going to recreate the entire situation right here, only this time, we're going to expose not only Sally but a dozen other Guernseys from as close to her blood line as we can get.  \"And we already knew that you had a young rooster sired by Solomon.\"  \"But, Doc,\" Johnny protested. \"Sally had a calf early that morning. Isn't that going to make a difference?\"  \"Of course it is,\" Peterson exclaimed. \"And she's going to have another one the same way. And so are all the other cows. You're the one that told me she had her calf by artificial insemination, didn't you?\"  Johnny nodded.  \"Well, then she's going to have another calf from the same bull and so will the other cows.\"  \"Pore Sally,\" Barney said sorrowfully. \"They're sure takin' the romance outta motherhood for you.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  The next day the guards were back on the gate. By midafternoon twelve fine young Guernseys arrived, together with a corps of veterinarians, biologists and security police. By nightfall, Sally and her companions were all once again in a \"delicate condition.\"  A mile from the ranch house, a dormitory was built for the veterinarians and biologists and a barracks thrown up for the security guards. A thirty-five thousand dollar, twelve-foot high chain link fence, topped by barbed wire, was constructed around the pasture and armored cars patrolled the fence by day and kept guard over the pregnant bovines by night in the barn.  Through the fall, into the long winter and back to budding spring again, the host of experts and guards watched and cared for the new calf-bloated herd.  The fact that Sally had gone dry had been kept a carefully guarded national secret. To keep up the pretense and show to the world that America still controlled the only proven method of manned space travel, the Joint Chiefs of Staff voted to expend two hundred gallons of the precious, small store of milk on hand for another interplanetary junket, this time to inspect the rings around Saturn.  Piloting a smaller and more sophisticated but equally-well protected version of _Icarus_, Major Quartermain abandoned the fleshpots of earth and the adulation of his coast-to-coast collection of worshiping females to again hurtle into the unknown.  \"It was strictly a milk run,\" Major Quartermain was quoted as saying as he emerged from his ship after an uneventful but propaganda-loaded trip.  By the middle of May, it was the consensus of the veterinarians that Delivery Day would be July 4th. Plans were drafted for the repeat atomic cave shot at 9:00 p.m., July 3rd. The pregnant herd was to be given labor-inducing shots at midnight, and, if all went well, deliveries would start within a few hours. Just to be sure that nothing would shield the cows from the rays of the explosion, they were put in a corral on the south side of the barn until 9:30 p.m., on the night of the firing.  Solomon's successor and a new bevy of hens were already roosting in the same old chicken house and egg production was normal.  On the night of July 3rd, at precisely 9:00 p.m., a sheet of light erupted from the Nevada hillside cave and the ground shook and rumbled for a few miles. It wasn't a powerful blast, nor had been the original shot. Sixty miles away, thirteen Guernsey cows munched at a rick of fresh hay and chewed contentedly in the moonlight.  At 3:11 a.m., the following morning the first calf arrived, followed in rapid order by a dozen more.  Sally's Cloverdale Marathon III dropped her calf at 4:08 a.m. on Independence Day.  At 7:00 a.m., she was milked and produced two and a half gallons of absolutely clear, odorless, tasteless and non-ignitable fluid. Eleven other Guernseys gave forth gushing, foaming, creamy rich gallon after gallon of Grade A milk.  The thirteenth cow filled two buckets with something that looked like weak cocoa and smelled like stale tea.  But when a white-smocked University of California poultry specialist entered the chicken house later in the morning, he found nothing but normal, white fresh eggs in the nests. He finally arrived at the conclusion that Solomon's old harem had known for some time; whatever it was that Solomon had been gifted with, this new rooster just didn't have it.  A rush call went out for a dozen of the precious store of golden eggs to be sent to the testing labs down range.  Two hours later, Dr. Peterson, surrounded by fellow scientists, stood before a bank of closed circuit television monitors in the Frenchman's Flat headquarters building. The scene on the screens was the interior of a massive steel-and-concrete test building several miles up range. Resting on the floor of the building was an open, gallon-sized glass beaker filled with the new version of Sally's milk.  Poised directly above the opened beaker was a funnel-shaped vessel containing the contents of one golden egg.  Dr. Peterson reached for a small lever. By remote control, the lever would gradually open the bottom of the funnel. He squeezed gently, slowly applying pressure. An involuntary gasp arose from the spectators as a tiny trickle of egg fluid fell from the funnel towards the open beaker.  Instinctively, everyone in the room clamped their eyes shut in anticipation of a blast. A second later, Peterson peered cautiously at the screen. The beaker of milk had turned a cloudy pale blue. It neither fizzed nor exploded. It just sat.  He levered another drop from the funnel. The stringy, glutenous mass plopped into the beaker and the liquid swirled briefly and turned more opaque, taking on more of a bluish tinge.  A babble of voices broke through the room when it was apparent that no explosion was forthcoming.  Peterson slumped into a nearby chair and stared at the screen.  \"Now what?\" he moaned.                       *      *      *      *      *  The \"what\" developed twelve hectic hours later after time lost initially in shaking, bouncing and beaming the new substance on the outside chance it might develop a latent tendency towards demolition.  Satisfied that whatever it was in the beaker wasn't explosive, the liquid was quickly poured off into sixteen small half-pint beakers and speeded to as many different laboratories for possible analysis.  \"What about the other stuff?\" Peterson was asked, referring to the brownish \"milk\""]]]
