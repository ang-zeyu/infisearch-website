It couldn't have been in greater contrast to the contrived hominess of the casino if they'd thought about it for a year. Then, for the last twist, the furnishings were straight out of the old Southwest--Navajo rugs, heavy, Spanish oak desks, and a pair of matching couches or divans of whole steer leather stretched over oak frames.         *       *       *       *       *  Peno Rose came quickly toward me the moment Fowler Smythe showed me into the office, spurs jingling. \"Hey! There he is! The boy they had to rule off the track! How's a boy, Lefty? Long time no see.\" He had his hand stuck way out ahead of him. His sharp, dried-out features repelled me twice as much as they had ten years before. That hatchet face of his was gashed with what he thought was a smile. I've seen sharks with a pleasanter gape. Naturally, I didn't take his hand.  \"Hi, Peno,\" I said. He jerked his hand back and straightened up. He snapped the hole in his face shut.  \"My partner,\" he said, waving his hand at the dark-skinned gent standing over against one of the fumed oak desks. \"Sime, meet Lefty Bupp, the hottest TK artist with dice in the whole damned country!\"  Simonetti leaned against the desk. He drew a zipper open in his fancy blouse, dragged out the Bull Durham and started to roll his own. They watch too much TV. It makes terrible hams of them all. He spat on the floor.  \"A living doll,\" I said. I took a better look at this honey. Face it, he was an oily snake, cleaned up as much as possible, but not enough. No amount of dude ranch duds, gold spurs or Indian jewelry could hide his stiletto mentality. He was just a Tenderloin hoodlum with some of the scum scraped off. Well, I should know. So was I.  Simonetti finished licking the seam of his roach. He came forward as he lit it and blew too much smoke in my face. \"What you doing here?\" he said in a husky voice. \"I told Rose no dice. We need another TK like we need a hole in the head.\"  \"You think I _want_ to be in this trap?\" I snapped at him. \"Say the word, Tex, and I'm gone.\"  \"You're fired,\" he said huskily. \"Scram!\"  I started for the door, glad to be rid of the lot of them. Peno Rose beat me to it. He showed me several rows of teeth, the way sharks will. \"Half of this joint is mine,\" he snarled, holding a hand lightly against my chest. He knew me better than to push. \"_My_ half is hiring you.\"  The whiff of garlic over my shoulder told me that Simonetti had followed me, too. He didn't have any reservations about grabbing me and twisting me around and giving me a real face-full.  \"If you know what's good for you, you'll get out of here.\"  \"Freak?\" I said, laying it on his mitral valve. After his heart had missed about eight beats, he started to sink, and I quit the lift. \"Be polite, Simonetti,\" I said to the panic in his yellowish face. \"Next time I'll pinch down tight. The coroner will call it heart failure. Tough.\"  He wanted his stiletto. He needed it. He was sorry he had ever quit carrying it. A couple seconds of reflection told him I was too tough for him. He went for his partner, his face darkening with rage now that his heart could get some blood to it. He had his hands out, for Rose's throat, I guess. For my dough it took guts to put fingers that close to all those teeth. But he never got a chance to try it. An ashtray, one of those things with a shot-loaded cloth bag under it, flew off a desk, smacked him in the back of the head, and dropped to the floor with a thump.  It wasn't a hard blow, but an upsetting one. Fowler Smythe grinned at him from where he was sitting in one of the leather divans. \"Sit down and shut up, Sime,\" he suggested coolly.  Simonetti sagged with defeat. \"Look, Rose,\" he gasped. \"I want out. Bad enough that our losses can't be stopped by this creep Smythe. Now you drag in another TK. Buy me out!\"  \"What's a business worth that's losing its shirt?\" Rose sneered. \"We were in clover, you fool, till this cross-roader got to us. This is our only chance to get even.\"  That finished Simonetti. He went back to his desk and slumped against it, scowling at the points of his handtooled boots.         *       *       *       *       *  Rose looked over at me. \"Let's make sense,\" he said quietly. \"We watched you on the TV monitor from the time you came in.\"  \"Sure,\" I said.  \"What about it?\" he demanded.  I shrugged. \"I had my way with the dice, Peno. I dropped nine yards as fast as I could, then won it back. The spots came up for me every single roll but two, when I had my eye on something else.\"  He snickered. \"We saw her,\" he said.  \"How about it, Fowler?\" I asked my Lodge Brother. \"Was a worker tipping the dice tonight?\"  \"I never felt it,\" he said. \"But the table had dropped nearly forty grand during the shift, which was about over when you started to play. He's too good for me, Wally.\"  \"But you felt _my_ lifts,\" I protested. \"You called 'TK' on the table.\"  Smythe shrugged and took off his glasses. \"I thought I felt you tipping when you first came to the layout,\" he said, waving them around. I nodded confirmation. \"But it was smooth work, and I could hardly be sure. Most of these maverick TK's strong-arm the dice, and they skid across the layout with their spots up. You're way ahead of that--you don't touch them till the final few tumbles. And then, you were losing, and I couldn't see that the table was being hit.\"  \"I thought it was the smart move.\" I explained. \"I was still controlling the dice, and if there'd been a cross-roader working, I should have felt him skidding them.\"  Smythe nodded. \"Of course,\" he added. \"I could feel you more clearly after you got the dice, and later, while that scarecrow with you was handling your chips. You were building a stack. So I fingered you.\"  \"Careful,\" I said sourly. \"You're talking about the woman I love.\"  There was a strained moment of silence, and then they all laughed. She'd been a sight, all right.  Simonetti came back alive with that one. His husky voice cut in on the laughter. \"Where does that bag fit?\" he demanded.  \"No idea,\" I said truthfully. \"A random factor. I don't think she fits.\"  \"_Something_ has to fit!\" he yelled in his oversized whisper. \"How about the way our losses follow Curley Smythe around from table to table?\"  This was something. \"The table you watch is the one that gets hit?\" I asked Smythe.  He blushed, clear to the top of his bald head. \"A subtle, nasty operator,\" he said gruffly. \"And he's had the gall to stick it in me pretty badly, Wally. What Sime says is true.\"  Well, this we wouldn't stand for. I didn't give a care if every gambling house in Nevada went broke. But Smythe was in the Lodge. And it finally made sense that the Lodge had sent me to bail him out. I gave old Maragon my mental apology. The Grand Master wouldn't stand still for _anybody's_ making a fool out of the Lodge. Still: \"Nobody that good is out of captivity,\" I snapped. \"I don't believe it. It's not TK that's robbing you.\"  \"Oh, ridiculous,\" Rose said, showing his teeth. \"Gambling is our business, Lefty. Don't you think we could spot any of the ordinary kinds of cross-roading? This is TK, and it has real voltage. We can't spot it. We've got to have Psi power do it for us.\"  \"Maybe,\" I agreed. \"But no TK can do it if Smythe can't. Have you tried a PC?\"  Simonetti grabbed a piece of the heavens in rage. \"No!\" he yelled in his loud whisper. \"None of your crystal-ball witches in here!\"  I knew how he felt. PC's give me the colly-wobbles, too.  \"What's the matter with precognition?\" I asked him. \"If this crook has got you stuck, Rose is right. Only Psi force will get you out of this jam. If you know in advance where this operator is going to hit you, you can nail him. There's a dozen techniques.\"  Peno Rose looked at me from under lowered brows. \"Are _you_ a PC, Lefty?\" he asked me.  \"No,\" I said shortly. The Lodge had proved that several times, in spite of my strong feelings that I had flashes of precognition. Why should I resent not having PC? How many Psi personalities have more than one power? Not many. And as for precognition, as Simonetti said, more than their fair share is possessed by wild-looking women. Like Sniffles, I thought suddenly.  \"Well,\" Rose said, turning back to his partner. \"Let Sime and me talk it over. Maybe we should get a PC.\"  \"Nuts,\" Simonetti told him.  \"I'll think it over, too,\" I said. \"See you tomorrow.\" I turned to go. Simonetti and Smythe followed me out, each for his own reasons, I guess, leaving Rose behind in the cube of glass on the roof, looking like he was going to turn belly-up and take a bite out of the PBX on his desk.         *       *       *       *       *  I wasn't exactly shadowed, but I knew somebody had his eye on me as I wandered about the crowded casino, looking for Sniffles. As far as I could make out, she had vamoosed without trying to hustle another sucker. Her percentage of my winnings had certainly been a disappointment to her.  At last I went down the ersatz wooden steps into the neon-gashed night and started across the nearly deserted main drag toward the motel where I had registered. A powerful turbine howled as a car pulled away from the curb, perhaps a hundred yards up the way. His lights came on and snapped up to bright. I had a perfect flash of PC--I _do_ have moments of it, no matter what the Lodge thinks. The car was going to take a dive into the fountain pool in front of my motel. But it sure didn't act like it. I froze in the middle of the road, hearing rubber scream as the driver floored the throttle and hurled the automobile right at me. He might as well have been on tracks. There was no place to go--I was in the middle of a six-lane boulevard, and could never make either curb before he ran me down.  This is when it pays to be a perceptive. I've talked to many TK's about how they visualize their lifts. We all conceive of it differently. With me a real strain is like shining a bright"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24382"],["title","Vigorish (#4)"],["body","of light on the spot you're lifting.  Be glad, Wally Bupp, I had time to tell myself. Be glad for a mechanical mind. Where do you lift four thousand pounds of car aimed right at you? Well, there is a small valve, can't weigh half an ounce, lightly spring-loaded, that is in the power-steering mechanism. I seared a lift at it. You know what happened.  The feedback of the power-steering wrenched the wheel from the driver's hand--it was ten times as strong as he was, dragging its power as it did from a four-hundred horsepower shaft turning 30,000 rpm. The car careened and skidded across the curb. It took out a small marble rail around the fountain pool and dived in, still screaming rubber. The fountain went over with a crash and then the racket dwindled off in the shriek of twisted buckets. The turbine had gotten what for in the collision.  I didn't hang around to see what had happened to the driver. He was just some heavy who had the job of rubbing me out. But I did seek another haven. If they knew me that well, I'd never be safe where I had stashed my suitcase.  There was a 'copter squatting at the Sky Hi's ramp. I jumped for it and had him drop me toward the outskirts of the town of Lake Tahoe, and then walked a few blocks, mostly in circles to see if I were being followed, before darting into a fairly seedy motel a couple blocks off the main drag.  My room was on the third floor of the flea-bag. Part of the place was only two stories high. The door at the end of my corridor opened out onto the roof. When I had calmed down, I stepped through the door into the cool of the desert night.         *       *       *       *       *  The gravel on the built-up roof crunched in the darkness under my feet as I walked cautiously to the parapet and looked over its edge to the hunk of desert that stretched away toward Reno, out behind the motel. The third story, behind me, cut off the neon glare from the Strip and left the place in inky darkness. There was silence and invisibility out behind the motel.  Feeling a little creaky about falling a couple stories to the ground, I lay down on my back on the narrow parapet, with my hands behind my head to soften the concrete a little, and looked straight up into the night sky. A dawdling August Perseid scratched a thin mark of light across the blackness. I heard a coyote howl. This was desert. This was peace. The dice and chuck-a-luck seemed ten thousand miles away.  I heard a sound. Gravel crunched dimly under another foot. Somebody had stepped invisibly onto the roof. It scared the daylights out of me, more so because I was flat on my back. Cautiously I turned my head toward the door I had come through. I could see the fuzzy redness of a cigarette in the dark. It brightened as the smoker took a drag. Then I heard the sniffle, and knew who it was.  She stood there, apparently leaning against the wall behind her, silently, invisible but for the glow of her cigarette, and not moving her feet. \"Hello,\" I said at last.  \"Wasn't sure you wanted to talk,\" she said out of the dark. It shook me up. She certainly couldn't _see_ me.  \"How'd you know I was here?\" I asked her.  \"I don't know how. But I knew you would be.\" That wasn't what I had asked, exactly. She sniffled, and I could almost see the back of her hand swipe at the bead of moisture that kept forming at the tip of her skinny nose. Made me think. Psi powers crop up more often than they should in folks who are marked with a debility. It's the old compensation story. Look at my weak right arm. What she had said about _expecting_ to find me on the roof sounded like precognition. And she sniffled and sniffled. Maybe it was one more of those tied-in hysterical Psi weaknesses.  \"What are you doing out here?\" I asked her.  \"Resting,\" she said wearily. \"I just hit town today.\"  \"And tired already?\"  \"I was broke,\" she said. \"Worked in a hotel laundry till dinner time to get eatin' money. Hot work. But I swiped a nice dress to wear when I went looking for you, Billy Joe.\"  \"Yeah,\" I said, hiding my snicker over the dress. \"Say, I wanted to thank you for handling my chips. I'd have lost my shirt if I hadn't let you show me how. I wanted to slip you a cut, but you bugged out of there.\"  \"I figured you should handle our money, Billy Joe,\" she said. \"Anyway, can't take money for my gift.\"  She had me shaking with excitement. \"You have a gift?\" I said, trying to keep my voice calm.  \"Just some nights. Since I broke my vow, I've lost most of my prophecy. My real gift is healing. Lost _all_ of that,\" she concluded, not bitterly. \"God is punishing me.\"  Gravel crunched as she came slowly across the roof toward me. The fag end of her cigarette made a spinning arc in the night as she snapped it over the side of the roof. Now there was no way to see her at all. Perception is nice in the dark. I tracked her automatically.  \"What was the vow you broke?\" I said.  She sighed, near me. \"I divorced my husband, my own darlin' Billy,\" she said. \"There's no divorce in Heaven.\"  \"Tough,\" I said. I thought _I_ was her darlin' Billy. Talk about Double-think! \"Will you miss never having a man again? I mean, once you've been a wife--\" I added, letting it drift off.  \"God has been good to me,\" she said out of the dark. \"He let me see my own future, that he would give me a husband again.\"  That was a curve. \"Isn't that an even worse breaking of vows?\" I said. \"I mean, if in God's sight you're still married to Billy Joe?\"  \"Would be,\" she conceded from the black, now right next to me. \"But He told me that the man I should seek _would be_ Billy Joe--hit's a miracle worked for me.\" Her voice lowered. \"A miracle that come to pass tonight, my darlin' Billy.\" A shiver ran its fingers up my spine. She meant every word of it. I _was_ her darlin' Billy.         *       *       *       *       *  I wasn't in any mood to get married, and least of all to a seeress. Precognition is the least understood of the Psi powers, and the most erratic. But of all people, I could least afford to sneer at the power of Psi.  For the first time, I guess, I realized the awful helplessness that comes over the Psiless when a TK invokes his telekinetic power. I wanted no part of the future this corn-fed oracle had conjured up. But it might be the only future I'd ever have.  I tried to recall her looks. Thinking about them, they really added up to no more than hysterical sniffles, not enough to eat, and the pathetic evidence that there hadn't been any money for orthodonture. Fatten her up, straighten her teeth and--Talk about _religious_ rationalization!  I snapped out of it. Maybe she could call the turn of dice. But I'd be damned if she could call the turn of people. Let her try _me_.  I sat up on the parapet, swinging to put my feet on the gravel of the root. \"So tonight you found the husband God's been going to give you?\" I asked.  \"Yes,\" she said softly.  \"And I'm the one?\"  \"Yes!\"  \"Not that again!\" I growled, grabbing her thin shoulders and shaking her. Her glasses bobbled on her nose. \"I'm _not_ your darlin' Billy, and you well know it. Admit it!\"  She closed her lips over her buck teeth and sniffled. \"I reckon not,\" she said, raising her head and looking at me without flinching. \"I lied to you.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Kind of made me feel more decent about bein' divorced.\"  I gave her a last shake for the lie. \"Let's have it,\" I went after her. \"How much of what you've been feeding me is just window dressing?\"  She shrugged, but stayed silent.  \"_Have_ you been married?\" I insisted.  \"Yes, Billy Joe.\"  \"_And_ divorced?\"  \"Oh, darlin' Billy,\" she sighed. \"I jest shouldn't never a _done_ that. But I did,\" she added.  \"Talk English,\" I snapped. \"This chitterlin's and corn pone are just more window dressing, right?\"  Her face was solemn behind the glasses. \"When you are a smart girl, and you know the future, too, they hate you and try to hurt you,\" she said. \"They don't seem to mind it so much if it comes from a piece of white trash that never could be 'no account.' By the time I was twelve or so I had learned to act just a little stupid and corn-fed.\"         *       *       *       *       *  This, her longest speech, she delivered in quiet, Neutral American, the speech that covers the great prairie states and is as near accentless and pure as American English ever is. It branded her Ozark twang as a lie, and a great many other things about her. But it added something very solid to her claims of prophecy.  \"All this,\" I said. \"Because you see the future?\"  \"Yes, Billy Joe.\"  \"And this talk about losing your prophecy because of divorce was just that, talk?\" I insisted.  Her mouth worked silently. \"I talk like trash, and sometimes I start to think like it,\" she confessed. \"I even act like it. I've tried not to see things acomin'. But,\" she added, drifting back into her Ozark lingo. \"Always I knowed I was to find you. I knowed I was to go and search in spots of sin, for there you would be. And it kept getting stronger on me where to seek. This night I knew it was the time. I never got a dress and all before.\"  The chilly fingers touched me again. Still, what she was saying made some weird kind of sense. \"What about the healing?\" I tried, feeling a trap slowly descending over me.  She smiled at that. \"I guess I put that punishment on myself for what I done,\" she said.  \"Then you can still heal the sick?\" I asked. She shrugged. \"I want you to try,\" I added.  \"Not till I get a sign,\" she said, moving uneasily. \"I'm to get a sign.\"  I waved my hands in disgust and turned away from her. \"There had to be some fakery in it somewhere,\" I said. \"You couldn't heal a hang-nail!\"  \"Not a fake!\" she said hotly. \"I _have_ healed the sick!\"  \"Don't get uppity,\" I said. \"So have I. You see,\" I told her. \"I'm a doctor. Not much of a one,\" I admitted, pointing to my weak right arm. \"I can't heal myself.\"  \"Oh, yore pore arm,\" she said.  \"Show me,\" I said, turning on her. \"Heal me!\"  \"I'm to have a sign!\" she wailed.
