My great ancestral musket made Independence Day,  I frown on your whole conspiracy, and you are wrong, I say!\"   And so they talked and they argued, some for and some against,--  And they progressed no further than they were when they commenced.  Until in a burst of eloquence a queer little piece of punk  Arose in his place and said, \"I think we ought to show some spunk.  And I for one have decided, although I am no shirk,  That to-day is a legal holiday and not even fire should work.   \"And I am of some importance,\"--here he gave a pretentious cough,  \"For without my assistance none of you could very well be put off.\"  \"You are right,\" said the Roman candle, \"and I think we are all agreed  To strike for our rights and our liberty. Hurrah! we shall succeed!\"  The dissenters cried with one accord, \"Our objections we withdraw.  Hurrah, hurrah for the fireworks' strike!\" and they cried again, \"Hurrah!\"   Then a match piped up with a tiny voice, \"Your splendid scheme I like.  I agree with all your principles and so I, too, will strike!\"  Suiting the action to the word, the silly little dunce  Clambered down from his matchsafe and excitedly struck at once.  He lost his head, and he ran around among the fireworks dry,  And he cried, \"Hurrah for the fireworks' strike! Hurrah for the                Fourth of July!\"   With his waving flame he lit the punk--a firecracker caught a spark,--  Then rockets and wheels and bombs went off--no longer the place was dark!  The explosions made a fearful noise, the flames leaped high and higher,  The village folk awoke and cried, \"The town hall is on fire!\"  So the strike of the fireworks ended in a wonderful display  Of pyrotechnic grandeur on Independence Day!      The Arch Armadillo    [Illustration]   There once was an arch Armadillo  Who built him a hut 'neath a willow;        He hadn't a bed        So he rested his head  On a young Porcupine for a pillow.      A Dream Lesson    Once there was a little boy who wouldn't go to bed,  When they hinted at the subject he would only shake his head,  When they asked him his intentions, he informed them pretty straight  That he wouldn't go to bed at all, and Nursey needn't wait.   As their arguments grew stronger, and their attitude more strict,  I grieve to say that naughty boy just yelled and screamed and kicked.  And he made up awful faces, and he told them up and down  That he wouldn't go to bed for all the nurses in the town.   Then Nursey lost her patience, and although it wasn't right,  Retorted that for all she cared he might sit up all night.  He approved of this arrangement, and he danced a jig for joy,  And turned a somersault with glee; he _was_ a naughty boy.   And so they all went off to bed and left him sitting there,  Right in the corner by the fire in Grandpa's big armchair.  He read his books and played his games,--he even sang a song  And thought how lovely it would be to sit up all night long.   [Illustration]   But soon his games grew stupid, and his puzzles wouldn't work;  He drew himself up stiffly with a sudden little jerk,  And he said, \"I am not sleepy, and I love to play alone--  And--I--think--\" the rest was mumbled in a drowsy monotone.   He leaned back on the cushions like that night he had the croup;  His head began to wobble and his eyes began to droop;  He closed them for a minute, just to see how it would seem,  And straightway he was sound asleep, and dreamed this awful dream!   He thought he saw a garden filled with flowers and roses gay,  A great big gardener with a hoe came walking down his way;  \"Ah, ha!\" exclaimed the gardener, as he clutched him by the head,  \"Here's a fine specimen I've found; I'll plant him in this bed!\"   [Illustration]   He held the boy in one big hand, unheeding how he cried,  And with the other dug a hole enormous, deep, and wide.  He jammed the little fellow in, and said in gruffest tone,  \"This is the bed for naughty boys who won't go to their own.\"   And then the dirt was shovelled in,--it covered up his toes,  His ankles, knees, and waist and arms, and higher yet it rose.  For still the gardener shovelled on, not noticing his cries;  It came up to his chin and mouth--it almost reached his eyes;   Just then he gathered all his strength and gave an awful scream,  And woke himself, and put an end to that terrific dream.  And he said, as Nursey tucked him up and bade him snugly rest,  \"When I am planted in a bed, I like my own the best.\"      The Rivals    [Illustration]   Two well-built men, neither giant nor dwarf,  Were Monsieur Elims and Mynheer Nworf.  They lived in a town not far away,  And spent their time in work and play.  Now Monsieur Elims was loved by all--  By rich and poor, by great and small.  And Mynheer Nworf remarked one day,  \"Brother, explain to me, I pray,  Why no one likes me as well as you,  No matter what I may say or do.  I have stores of knowledge packed in my head;  I am learned and wise and very well read;  I can dance, I can sing, I'm extremely polite;  I am worth a large fortune all in my own right.  But still,--and this question has caused me much thought,--  While I am neglected, you're everywhere sought.\"  Monsieur Elims replied: \"My dear sir, that is true,  But you see, I am I, and you see, you are you.  If I receive praises and you receive blame,  'Tis doubtless because each lives up to his name.\"   You'll find his defence rather puzzling, I fear;  But read their names backward--the meaning is clear.      The New Cup    \"I've a lovely new cup from Uncle John,\"    Said Dorothy; \"only see--  It has beautiful golden letters on,    And they spell '_Remember Me_.'\"   \"Oho!\" laughed Fred. \"Why, Dorothy dear,    They put that on mugs and plates:  _I_'ve studied jography 'most a year,    And I know the names of the States.   And when you see that anywhere,--    At least, since this fuss with Spain,--  It's the President who puts it there,    And it means 'Remember the Maine'!\"      A Photographic Failure    [Illustration]       Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle      Saw a patient Periwinkle  With a kodak, sitting idly by a rill.      Feeling a desire awaken      For to have his picture taken,  Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle stood stock-still.       Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle      Felt his brow begin to wrinkle,  And his pose assume a sad and solemn style;      But the Periwinkle trusted,      As the focus he adjusted,  That his customer would kindly try to smile.       Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle      Felt his eyes begin to twinkle,  And his mouth took on a broad and open grin;      Said the Periwinkle, sadly,      \"If you stretch your jaw so madly,  I fear perhaps that I shall tumble in.\"       Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle      Felt his hair begin to crinkle,  As it rose up on his forehead in affright;      Though his comrade spoke so mildly,      Mr. Hinkle wondered wildly,  How he could escape this dire and awful plight.       Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle      Said, \"I fear it's going to sprinkle,  And really for a storm I'm not prepared.\"      Then without a further warning      He politely said, \"Good morning,\"  And the patient Periwinkle stood and stared.   [Illustration]      Christmas Gifts    Ten Christmas presents standing in a line;  Robert took the bicycle, then there were nine.  Nine Christmas presents ranged in order straight;  Bob took the steam engine, then there were eight.  Eight Christmas presents--and one came from Devon;  Robbie took the jackknife, then there were seven.  Seven Christmas presents direct from St. Nick's;  Bobby took the candy box, then there were six.  Six Christmas presents, one of them alive;  Rob took the puppy dog, then there were five.  Five Christmas presents yet on the floor;  Bobbin took the soldier cap, then there were four.  Four Christmas presents underneath the tree;  Bobbet took the writing desk, then there were three.  Three Christmas presents still in full view;  Robin took the checker board, then there were two.  Two Christmas presents, promising fun,  Bobbles took the picture book, then there was one.  One Christmas present--and now the list is done;  Bobbinet took the sled, and then there were none.  And the same happy child received every toy,  So many nicknames had one little boy.      Young America    [Illustration]   Wee Willie sat a-thinking,    And he shook his curly head.  Around him on the nursery floor    His treasures lay outspread.   Firecrackers and torpedoes,    Trumpet and flag and drum,  Rockets and pinwheels and paper caps,    For Fourth of July had come.   \"But it makes me sort o' sorry,\"    Wee Willie said with a sigh,  \"To think of those poor little English boys    Without any Fourth of July.\"      A Bicycle built for Two    There was an ambitious young eel  Who determined to ride on a wheel;        But try as he might,        He couldn't ride right,  In spite of his ardor and zeal.   If he sat on the saddle to ride  His tail only pedalled one side;        And I'm sure you'll admit        That an eel _couldn't_ sit  On a bicycle saddle astride.   Or if he hung over the top,  He could go, but he never could stop;        For of course it is clear        He had no way to steer,  And under the wheel he would flop.   His neighbor, observing the fun,  Said, \"I think that the thing can be done,        If you'll listen to me,        You'll quickly agree  That two heads are better than one.   \"And this is my project, old chap,  Around our two waists I will wrap        This beautiful belt        Of bottle-green felt  And fasten it firm with a strap.\"   [Illustration]   This done, with a dignified mien  The two squirmed up on the machine,        And rode gayly away,        Or at least, so they say,  Who witnessed the wonderful scene.      [Illustration]   Dorothy's Opinion    Mamma has bought a calendar,    And every single page  Has pictures on of little girls    'Most just about my age.   And when she bought it yesterday,    Down at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24560"],["title","The Jingle Book (#4)"],["body","bazaar,  She said, \"What lovely little girls,    How true to life they are.\"   But I don't think they're true to life,    And I'll just tell you why;  They never have a rumpled frock    Or ribbon bow awry.   And though they play with cats and dogs,    And rabbits and white mice,  And sail their boats and fly their kites,    They always look so nice.   And I am sure no little girl    That ever _I_ have seen,  Could play with dogs or sail a boat    And keep her frock so clean.   [Illustration]      The Roll of Roly Poly Roy    [Illustration]   Once on a time a lad I knew--    His sister called him Bubby;  His cheeks were red, his eyes were blue,    And he was plump and chubby.  Indeed, he was so stout a boy,  Some called him Roly Poly Roy;      They called him that      For he was fat  And very plump and chubby.   [Illustration]   He caused his father grief profound,    And made his mother worry,  Because he'd roll along the ground    When he was in a hurry.  For as he couldn't see his toes,  He often tumbled on his nose;      So, on the whole,      'Twas best to roll  When he was in a hurry.   \"Get up!\" the people urged, but he    Replied, \"There's no use talking;  I roll around because, you see,    It's easier than walking.\"  And though it looked extremely droll  To see the lad lie down and roll,      It was, forsooth,      For that fat youth  Far easier than walking.   [Illustration]   One day he thought he'd try to ride;    Alas, he was so bulky,  He tumbled off the other side,    Which made him rather sulky.  He heard his comrades jeer and scoff,  Again he tried and tumbled off,      And when he fell      They'd shout and yell--    Of course it made him sulky.   Just out of town there was a place    With rolling ground and hilly,  And here Roy started for a race    With Dick and Tom and Willy.  You'll know of course before you're told  That Roy just laid him down and rolled;      And so, you see,      He easily    Beat Dick and Tom and Willy.   That day two giants came along    From Huncamunca Valley,  Seeking some tenpins good and strong    For their new bowling alley.  They reached the hilly sort of place  Just as our hero won the race;      \"Look at him roll!\"      They said. \"He'll bowl    On our new bowling alley.   \"The other boys are squarely built;    For tenpins they'll do finely!  No matter if a few get kilt,\"    And then they smiled benignly.  Quickly they kidnapped ten small boys,  All howling with a fearful noise;      They took them all,      And Roy for ball,    And then they smiled benignly.   [Illustration]   They hurried to their home and then    Began their barbarous bowling.  They set in rows the children ten    And then set Roy a-rolling.  But as the giants were strong and great,  They shot poor Roy at such a rate,      And with such might,      That out of sight    Poor Roy was set a-rolling.   [Illustration]   He rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled,    But soon, his fears dispelling,  With happiness he did behold    He'd safely reached his dwelling.  Secure and safe from further harms,  His mother caught him in her arms,      And said with joy,      \"My darling boy,   You've safely reached your dwelling.\"   Now rolling seems to him to be    More dangerous than walking.  And Roly Poly Roy you'll see    Along the sidewalks stalking.  He'll always have a certain fear  That giants may be lurking near,      And so he'll go      With motion slow    Along the sidewalk stalking.   [Illustration]      My Barometer    [Illustration]   My little maid with golden hair    Comes each morning for a kiss;  And I know the day will be fine and fair    When Polly looks like this.   [Illustration]   Or I know the clouds will frown and lower,    The skies will be dull and gray,  And perhaps there'll be a passing shower,    When Polly looks this way.   [Illustration]   But a violent storm of rain or snow    I can prognosticate,  For the sign will never fail, I know,    When this is Polly's pate.      The Butter Betty Bought    Betty Botta bought some butter;  \"But,\" said she, \"this butter's bitter!  If I put it in my batter  It will make my batter bitter.  But a bit o' better butter  Will but make my batter better.\"  Then she bought a bit o' butter  Better than the bitter butter,  Made her bitter batter better.  So 'twas better Betty Botta  Bought a bit o' better butter.      [Illustration]   A Marvel    An old astronomer there was    Who lived up in a tower,  Named Ptolemy Copernicus    Flammarion McGower.  He said: \"I can prognosticate    With estimates correct;  And when the skies I contemplate,    I know what to expect.  When dark'ning clouds obscure my sight,    I think perhaps 'twill rain;  And when the stars are shining bright,    I know 'tis clear again.\"  And then abstractedly he scanned    The heavens, hour by hour,  Old Ptolemy Copernicus    Flammarion McGower.      An Alphabet Zoo    A was an apt Alligator,  Who wanted to be a head-waiter;      He said, \"I opine      In that field I could shine,  Because I am such a good skater.\"   B was a beggarly Bear,  Who carefully curled his front hair;      He said, \"I would buy      A red-spotted tie,--  But I haven't a penny to spare.\"   C was a cool Chimpanzee,  Who went to an afternoon tea.      When they said, \"Will you take      A caraway cake?\"  He greedily took twenty-three!   D was a diligent Doe,  In summer she shovelled the snow;      In the spring and the fall      She did nothing at all,  And in winter the grass she would mow.   E was an erudite Ermine,  Who tried very hard to determine      If he _should_ earn a cent,      How it ought to be spent,  And decided to purchase a sermon.   F was a fussy Flamingo,  Who remarked to his family, \"By jingo!      I think I would go      To that animal show,  But they all talk such barbarous lingo.\"   G was a giddy Gazelle,  Who never could learn how to spell;      But she managed to pass      To the head of her class,  Because she did fractions so well.   H was a haughty young Hawk,  Who affected society talk;      But when introduced      At a large chicken roost  He excitedly screamed out, \"Oh, Lawk!\"   I was an idle Iguana,  Who lived upon curried banana;      With tears he'd protest      That he never could rest  Till he learned to sing \"Eileen Alanna.\"   J was a jimp Jaguar,  Who purchased a Spanish guitar;      He played popular airs      At _fêtes_ and at fairs,  And down at the Fancy Bazaar.   K was a kind Kangaroo,  Whose bonnet was always askew;      So they asked her to wait      While they put it on straight  And fastened it firmly with glue.   L was a lachrymose Leopard,  Who ate up twelve sheep and a shepherd,      But the real reason why      He continued to cry  Was his food was so lavishly peppered.   M was a mischievous Marten,  Who went to the Free Kindergarten;      When they asked him to plat      A gay-colored mat,  He tackled the job like a Spartan.   N was a naughty Nylghau,  Who wandered too near a buzz saw.      It cut off his toes,      And the shrieks that arose  Filled all of the neighbors with awe.   O was an ossified Oyster,  Who decided to enter a cloister.      He could not return,      So continued to yearn  For his home in the sea, which was moister.   P was a poor old Poll Parrot,  Who had nothing to eat but a carrot,      And nothing to wear      But a wig of red hair,  And nowhere to live but a garret.   Q was a querulous Quab  Who at every trifle would sob;      He said, \"I detest      To wear a plaid vest,  And I hate to eat corn from the cob!\"   R was a rollicking Ram,  Attired in an old pillow sham.      When asked if he'd call      At the masquerade ball,  He said, \"I'll go just as I am.\"   S was a shy Salamander,  Who slept on a sunny veranda.      She calmly reposed,      But, alas! while she dozed  They caught her and killed her and canned her.   T was a tidy young Tapir,  Who went out to bring in the paper;      And when he came back      He made no muddy track,  For he wiped his feet clean on the scraper.   U was a young Unicorn,  The bravest that ever was born.      They bought him a boat      And they set him afloat,  And straightway he sailed for Cape Horn.   V was a vigorous Vulture,  Who taught animals physical culture;      When a pupil dropped dead,      The kind teacher said,  \"You needn't consider sepulture.\"   W was a wild Worm,  All day he did nothing but squirm.      They sent him to school,      But he broke every rule,  And left at the end of the term.   X was a Xiphias brave,  Who lived on the crest of the wave.      To each fish he would say,      \"Good day, sir, good day!\"  And then a polite bow he gave.   Y was a young Yellowhammer,  Who raised a ridiculous clamor;      And he chattered until      An owl said, \"Keep still!  I'm trying to study my grammar.\"   Z was a zealous old Zibet,  Toboggans he tried to prohibit.      If any one tried      To take a sly slide,  He ordered him hanged on a gibbet.      Found Wanting    [Illustration]   There lived a wondrous sculptor once, a genius in his way,  Named Phidias Praxiteles Canova Merryday.  He sat within his studio and said, \"I really must  Begin a Rhodian anaglyptic ceroplastic bust.   \"My customers demand them, their fame rings near and far,  But then, alas, the trouble is, I don't know what they are.  Though I could carve a Venus or a Belvedere with ease,  My wondrous skill is lacking when it comes to carving these.   \"I cast and cut and chisel, I model and I mould,  I copy poses picturesque from studies new and old;  In marble, bronze, and potter's clay, in wax and wood and stone  I carve the old-time statues with improvements of my own.   [Illustration]   \"I have Apollo on a horse, Minerva on a wheel,  Hercules going fishing with his basket and his creel.  A Mercury on roller-skates, Diana with a hat,  And Venus playing tennis with Achilles at the bat.   \"Yet these my customers pass by, and ask with interest keen,  For things with long and tiresome names,--I don't know what"]]]
