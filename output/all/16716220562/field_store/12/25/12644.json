Suddenly there came a moment when I realized that I wasn't keeping up with my feet....  I shouted to my skis to stop. It was no good. They went on....  I decided to stop without them....  The ensuing second went by too swiftly for me to understand rightly what happened. I fancy that, rising from my sitting position and travelling easily on my head, I caught my skis up again and passed them....  Then it was their turn. They overtook me....  But I was not to be beaten. Once more I obtained the lead. This time I took the inside berth, and kept it....  There seemed to be a lot more snow than I really wanted.... I struggled bravely with it....  And then the earthquake ceased, and suddenly I was in the outer air. My first ski-run, the most glorious run of modern times, was over.  \"Ripping!\" I shouted up the hill to them. \"But there's rather a nasty bump at the bottom,\" I added kindly, as I set myself to the impossible business of getting up....  \"Jove,\" said Archie, coming to rest a few yards off, \"that's splendid!\" He had fallen in a less striking way than myself, and he got to his feet without difficulty. \"Why do you pose like that?\" he asked, as he picked up his stick.  \"I'm a fixture,\" I announced. \"Myra,\" I said, as she turned a somersault and arrived beaming at my side, \"I'm here for some time; you'll have to come out every morning with crumbs for me. In the afternoon you can bring a cheering book and read aloud to your husband. Sometimes I shall dictate little things to you. They will not be my best little things; for this position, with my feet so much higher than my head, is not the one in which inspiration comes to me most readily. The flow of blood to the brain impairs reflection. But no matter.\"  \"Are you really stuck?\" asked Myra in some anxiety. \"I should hate to have a husband who lived by himself in the snow,\" she said thoughtfully.  \"Let us look on the bright side,\" said Archie. \"The snow will have melted by April, and he will then be able to return to you. Hallo, here's Thomas! Thomas will probably have some clever idea for restoring the family credit.\"  Thomas got up in a businesslike manner and climbed slowly back to us.  \"Thomas,\" I said, \"you see the position. Indeed,\" I added, \"it is obvious. None of the people round me seems inclined--or, it may be, able--to help. There is a feeling that if Myra lives in the hotel alone while I remain here--possibly till April--people will talk. You know how ready they are. There is also the fact that I have only hired the skis for three weeks. Also--a minor point, but one that touches me rather--that I shall want my hair cut long before March is out. Thomas, imagine me to be a torpedo-destroyer on the Maplin Sands, and tell me what on earth to do.\"  \"Take your skis off.\"  \"Oh, brilliant!\" said Myra.  \"Take my skis off?\" I cried. \"Never! Is it not my duty to be the last to leave my skis? Can I abandon---- Hallo! is that Dahlia on the sky-line? Hooray, lunch! Archie, take my skis off, there's a good fellow. We mustn't keep Dahlia waiting.\"   III.--A TYPICAL MORNING  \"You take lunch out to-day--no?\" said Josef, the head-waiter, in his invariable formula.  Myra and I were alone at breakfast, the first down. I was just putting some honey on to my seventh roll, and was not really in the mood for light conversation with Josef about lunch. By the way, I must say I prefer the good old English breakfast. With eggs and bacon and porridge you do know when you want to stop; with rolls and honey you hardly notice what you are doing, and there seems no reason why you should not go on for ever. Indeed, once ... but you would never believe me.  \"We take lunch out to-day, _yes_, Josef. Lunch for--let me see----\"  \"Six?\" suggested Myra.  \"What are we all going to do? Archie said something about skating. I'm off that.\"  \"But whatever we do we must lunch, and it's much nicer outdoors. Six, Josef.\"  Josef nodded and retired. I took my eighth roll.  \"Do let's get off quickly to-day,\" I said. \"There's always so much chat in the morning before we start.\"  \"I've just got one swift letter to write,\" said Myra, as she got up, \"and then I shall be pawing the ground.\"  Half an hour later I was in the lounge, booted, capped, gloved, and putteed--the complete St. Bernard. The lounge seemed to be entirely full of hot air and entirely empty of anybody I knew. I asked for letters; and, getting none, went out and looked at the thermometer. To my surprise I discovered that there were thirty-seven degrees of frost. A little alarmed, I tapped the thing impatiently. \"Come, come,\" I said, \"this is not the time for persiflage.\" However, it insisted on remaining at five degrees below zero. What I should have done about it I cannot say, but at that moment I remembered that it was a Centigrade thermometer with the freezing point in the wrong place. Slightly disappointed that there were only five degrees of frost (Centigrade) I returned to the lounge.  \"Here you are at last,\" said Archie impatiently. \"What are we all going to do?\"  \"Where's Dahlia?\" asked Myra. \"Let's wait till she comes and then we can all talk at once.\"  \"Here she is. Dahlia, for Heaven's sake come and tell us the arrangements for the day. Start with the idea fixed in your mind that Myra and I have ordered lunch for six.\"  Dahlia shepherded us to a quiet corner of the lounge and we all sat down.  \"By the way,\" said Simpson, \"are there any letters for me?\"  \"No; it's your turn to write,\" said Archie.  \"But, my dear chap, there _must_ be one, because----\"  \"But you never acknowledged the bed-socks,\" I pointed out. \"She can't write till you---- I mean, it was rather forward of her to send them at all; and if you haven't even----\"  \"Well,\" said Dahlia, \"what does anybody want to do?\"  Thomas was the first to answer the question. A girl in red came in from the breakfast-room and sat down near us. She looked up in our direction and met Thomas's eye.  \"Good morning,\" said Thomas, with a smile, and he left us and moved across to her.  \"That's the girl he danced with all last night,\" whispered Myra. \"I can't think what's come over him. Is this our reserved Thomas--Thomas the taciturn, whom we know and love so well? I don't like the way she does her hair.\"  \"She's a Miss Aylwyn,\" said Simpson in a loud voice. \"I had one dance with her myself.\"  \"The world,\" said Archie, \"is full of people with whom Samuel has had one dance.\"  \"Well, that washes Thomas out, anyway. He'll spend the day teaching her something. What are the rest of us going to do?\"  There was a moment's silence.  \"Oh, Archie,\" said Dahlia, \"did you get those nails put in my boots?\"  I looked at Myra ... and sighed.  \"Sorry, dear,\" he said. \"I'll take them down now. The man will do them in twenty minutes.\" He walked over to the lift at the same moment that Thomas returned to us.  \"I say,\" began Thomas, a little awkwardly, \"if you're arranging what to do, don't bother about me. I rather thought of--er--taking it quietly this morning. I think I overdid it a bit yesterday.\"  \"We warned you at the time about the fourth hard-boiled egg,\" I said.  \"I meant the ski-ing. We thought of--I thought of having lunch in the hotel, but, of course, you can have my rucksack to carry yours in. Er--I'll go and put it in for you.\"  He disappeared rather sheepishly in the direction of the dining-room.  \"Now, Samuel,\" said Myra gently.  \"Now what, Myra?\"  \"It's your turn. If you have a headache, tell us her name.\"  \"My dear Myra, I want to ski to-day. Where shall we go? Let's go to the old slopes and practise the Christiania Turn.\"  \"What you want to practise is the ordinary Hampstead Straight,\" I said. \"A medium performance of yours yesterday, Samuel.\"  \"But, my dear old chap,\" he said eagerly, \"I told you it was the fault of my skis. They would stick to the snow. Oh, I say,\" he added, \"that reminds me. I must go and buy some wax for them.\"  He dashed off. I looked at Myra ... and sighed.  \"The nail-man won't be long,\" said Archie to Dahlia, on his return. \"I'm to call for them in a quarter of an hour.\"  \"Can't you wear some other boots, Dahlia, or your bedroom slippers or something? It's half-past eleven. We really must get off soon.\"  \"But we haven't settled where we're going yet.\"  \"Then for 'eving's sake let's do it. Myra and I thought we might go up above the wood at the back and explore. We can always ski down. It might be rather exciting.\"  \"Remember,\" said Dahlia, \"I'm not so expert as you are.\"  \"Of course,\" said Myra, \"we're the Oberland mixed champions.\"  \"You know,\" said Archie, \"I was talking to the man who's doing Dahlia's boots and he said the snow would be bad for ski-ing to-day.\"  \"If he talked in French, no doubt you misunderstood him,\" I said, a little annoyed. \"He was probably asking you to buy a pair of skates.\"  \"Talking about that,\" said Archie, \"why shouldn't we skate this morning, and have lunch at the hotel, and then get the bob out this afternoon?\"  \"Here you are,\" said Thomas, coming up with a heavy rucksack. \"Lunch for six, so you'll have an extra one.\"  \"I'd forgotten about lunch,\" said Archie. \"Look here, just talk it over with Dahlia while I go and see about my skates. I don't suppose Josef will mind if we do stay in to lunch after all. What about Simpson?\"  I looked at Myra ... and sighed.  \"What about him?\" I said.         .       .       .       .       .  Half an hour later two exhausted people--one of them with lunch for six on his back--began the ascent to the wood, trailing their skis behind them.  \"Another moment,\" said Myra, \"and I should have screamed.\"   IV.--THOMAS, AND A TURN  Myra finished her orange, dried her hands daintily on my handkerchief, and spoke her mind.  \"This is the third time,\" she said, \"that Thomas has given us the slip. If he gets engaged to that girl in red I shall cry.\"  \"There are,\" I said, idly throwing a crust at Simpson and missing him, \"engagements and Swiss engagements--just as there"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24313"],["title","Once a Week (#6)"],["body"," measles and German measles. It is well known that Swiss engagements don't count.\"  \"_We_ got engaged in Kent. A bit of luck.\"  \"I have nothing against Miss Aylwyn----\" I went on.  \"Except the way she does her hair.\"  \"--but she doesn't strike me as being the essential Rabbit. We cannot admit her to the--er--fold.\"  \"The covey,\" suggested Myra.  \"The warren. Anyhow, she---- Simpson, for goodness' sake stop fooling about with your bearded friend and tell us what you think of it all.\"  We were finishing lunch in the lee of a little chalet, high above the hotel, and Simpson had picked up an acquaintance with a goat, which he was apparently trying to conciliate with a piece of chocolate. The goat, however, seemed to want a piece of Simpson.  \"My dear old chap, he won't go away. Here--shoo! shoo! I wish I knew what his name was.\"  \"Ernest,\" said Myra.  \"I can't think why you ever got into such a hirsute set, Simpson. He probably wants your compass. Give it to him and let him withdraw.\"  Ernest, having decided that Simpson was not worth knowing, withdrew, and we resumed our conversation.  \"When we elderly married folk have retired,\" I went on, \"and you gay young bachelors sit up over a last cigar to discuss your conquests, has not Thomas unbent to you, Samuel, and told you of his hopes and fears?\"  \"He told me last night he was afraid he was going bald, and he said he hoped he wasn't.\"  \"That's a bad sign,\" said Myra. \"What did you say?\"  \"I said I thought he was.\"  With some difficulty I got up from my seat in the snow and buckled on my skis.  \"Come on, let's forget Thomas for a bit. Samuel is now going to show us the Christiania Turn.\"  Simpson, all eagerness, began to prepare himself.  \"I said I would, didn't I? I was doing it quite well yesterday. This is a perfect little slope for it. You understand the theory of it, don't you?\"  \"We hope to after the exhibition.\"  \"Well, the great thing is to lean the opposite way to the way you think you ought to lean. That's what's so difficult.\"  \"You understand, Myra? Samuel will lean the opposite way to what he thinks he ought to lean. Tell Ernest.\"  \"But suppose you think you ought to lean the _proper_ way, the way they do in Christiania,\" said Myra, \"and you lean the opposite way, then what happens?\"  \"That is what Samuel will probably show us,\" I said.  Simpson was now ready.  \"I am going to turn to the left,\" he said. \"Watch carefully. Of course, I may not bring it off the first time.\"  \"I can't help thinking you will,\" said Myra.  \"It depends what you call bringing it off,\" I said. \"We have every hope of--I mean we don't think our money will be wasted. Have you got the opera-glasses and the peppermints and the programme, darling? Then you may begin, Samuel.\"  Simpson started down the slope a little unsteadily. For one moment I feared that there might be an accident before the real accident, but he recovered himself nobly and sped to the bottom. Then a cloud of snow shot up, and for quite a long time there was no Simpson.  \"I knew he wouldn't disappoint us,\" gurgled Myra.  We slid down to him and helped him up.  \"You see the idea,\" he said. \"I'm afraid I spoilt it a little at that end, but----\"  \"My dear Samuel, you improved it out of all knowledge.\"  \"But that actually _is_ the Christiania Turn.\"  \"Oh, _why_ don't we live in Christiania?\" exclaimed Myra to me. \"Couldn't we possibly afford it?\"  \"It must be a happy town,\" I agreed. \"How the old streets must ring and ring again with jovial laughter.\"  \"Shall I do it once more?\"  \"_Can_ you?\" said Myra, clasping her hands eagerly.  \"Wait here,\" said Samuel, \"and I'll do it quite close to you.\"  Myra unstrapped her camera.  Half an hour later, with several excellent films of the scene of the catastrophe, we started for home. It was more than a little steep, but the run down was accomplished without any serious trouble. Simpson went first to discover any hidden ditches (and to his credit be it said that he invariably discovered them); Myra, in the position of safety in the middle, profited by Samuel's frequent object-lessons; while I, at the back, was ready to help Myra up, if need arose, or to repel any avalanche which descended on us from above. On the level snow at the bottom we became more companionable.  \"We still haven't settled the great Thomas question,\" said Myra. \"What about to-morrow?\"  \"Why bother about to-morrow? _Carpe diem._ Latin.\"  \"But the great tailing expedition is for to-morrow. The horses are ordered; everything is prepared. Only one thing remains to settle. Shall we have with us a grumpy but Aylwynless Thomas, or shall we let him bring her and spoil the party?\"  \"She can't spoil the party. I'm here to enjoy myself, and all Thomas's _fiancées_ can't stop me. Let's have Thomas happy, anyway.\"  \"She's really quite a nice girl,\" said Simpson. \"I danced with her once.\"  \"Right-o, then. I'll tell Dahlia to invite her.\"  We hurried on to the hotel; but as we passed the rink the President stopped me for a chat. He wanted me to recite at a concert that evening. Basely deserted by Myra and Samuel, I told him that I did not recite; and I took the opportunity of adding that personally I didn't think anybody else ought to. I had just persuaded him to my point of view when I noticed Thomas cutting remarkable figures on the ice. He picked himself up and skated to the side.  \"Hallo!\" he said. \"Had a good day?\"  \"Splendid. What have you been doing?\"  \"Oh--skating.\"  \"I say, about this tailing expedition to-morrow----\"  \"Er--yes, I was just going to talk about that.\"  \"Well, it's all right. Myra is getting Dahlia to ask her to come with us.\"  \"Good!\" said Thomas, brightening up.  \"You see, we shall only be seven, even with Miss Aylwyn, and----\"  \"Miss _Aylwyn_?\" said Thomas in a hollow voice.  \"Yes, isn't that the name of your friend in red?\"  \"Oh, _that_ one. Oh, but that's quite--I mean,\" he went on hurriedly, \"Miss Aylwyn is probably booked up for to-morrow. It's Miss Cardew who is so keen on tailing. That girl in green, you know.\"  For a moment I stared at him blankly. Then I left him and dashed after Myra.   V.--A TAILING PARTY  The procession prepared to start in the following order:--  (1) A brace of sinister-looking horses.  (2) Gaspard, the Last of the Bandits; or \"Why cause a lot of talk by pushing your rich uncle over the cliff, when you can have him stabbed quietly for one franc fifty?\" (If ever I were in any vendetta business I should pick Gaspard first.)  (3) A sleigh full of lunch.  (4) A few well-known ladies and gentlemen (being the cream of the Hôtel des Angéliques) on luges; namely, reading from left to right (which is really the best method--unless you are translating Hebrew), Simpson, Archie, Dahlia, Myra, me, Miss Cardew, and Thomas.  While Gaspard was putting the finishing knots to the luges, I addressed a few remarks to Miss Cardew, fearing that she might be feeling a little lonely amongst us. I said that it was a lovely day, and did she think the snow would hold off till evening? Also had she ever done this sort of thing before? I forget what her answers were.  Thomas meanwhile was exchanging badinage on the hotel steps with Miss Aylwyn. There must be something peculiar in the Swiss air, for in England Thomas is quite a respectable man ... and a godfather.  \"I suppose we _have_ asked the right one,\" said Myra doubtfully.  \"His young affections are divided. There was a third girl in pink with whom he breakfasted a lot this morning. It is the old tradition of the sea, you know. A sailor--I mean an Admiralty civilian has a wife at every wireless station.\"  \"Take your seats, please,\" said Archie. \"The horses are sick of waiting.\"  We sat down. Archie took Dahlia's feet on his lap, Myra took mine, Miss Cardew took Thomas's. Simpson, alone in front, nursed a guide-book.  \"_En avant!_\" cried Simpson in his best French-taught-in-twelve-lessons accent.  Gaspard muttered an oath to his animals. They pulled bravely. The rope snapped--and they trotted gaily down the hill with Gaspard.  We hurried after them with the luges....  \"It's a good joke,\" said Archie, after this had happened three times, \"but, personally, I weary of it. Miss Cardew, I'm afraid we've brought you out under false pretences. Thomas didn't explain the thing to you adequately. He gave you to understand that there was more in it than this.\"  Gaspard, who seemed full of rope, produced a fourth piece and tied a knot that made even Simpson envious.  \"Now, Samuel,\" I begged, \"do keep the line taut this time. Why do you suppose we put your apricot suit right in the front? Is it, do you suppose, for the sunset effects at eleven o'clock in the morning, or is it that you may look after the rope properly?\"  \"I'm awfully sorry, Miss Cardew,\" said Simpson, feeling that somebody ought to apologize for something and knowing that Gaspard wouldn't, \"but I expect it will be all right now.\"  We settled down again. Once more Gaspard cursed his horses, and once more they started off bravely. And this time we went with them.  \"The idea all along,\" I explained to Miss Cardew.  \"I rather suspected it,\" she said. Apparently she has a suspicious mind.  After the little descent at the start, we went uphill slowly for a couple of miles, and then more rapidly over the level. We had driven over the same road in a sleigh, coming from the station, and had been bitterly cold and extremely bored. Why our present position should be so much more enjoyable I didn't quite see.  \"It's the expectation of an accident,\" said Archie. \"At any moment somebody may fall off. Good.\"  \"My dear old chap,\" said Simpson, turning round to take part in the conversation, \"why anybody _should_ fall off----\"  We went suddenly round a corner, and quietly and without any fuss whatever Simpson left his luge and rolled on to the track. Luckily any possibility of a further accident was at once avoided. There was no panic at all. Archie kicked the body temporarily out of the way; after which"]]]
