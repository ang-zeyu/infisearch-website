Whereas, when the vetturino pays, the hotel keepers are much more reasonable. They are aware that the vetturino knows what the charges ought to be, and they are afraid, if they overcharge him for his party, that then he will take his next party to some other hotel.  \"And what shall you give us,\" asked Mr. George, in talking with Vittorio on this subject, \"if you provide for us?\"  \"In the morning,\" replied Vittorio, \"before we set out, there will be coffee or tea, and bread and butter, with eggs. Then, when we stop at noon, you will have a second breakfast of mutton chops, fried potatoes, fried fish, omelets, and other such things. Then, at night, when the day's journey is done, you will have dinner.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mr. George. \"I should think that that might do. And how much must we pay you?\"  \"It used to be eight francs a day,\" said Vittorio; \"but the price of every thing is raised, and now we cannot do it well for less than nine francs. I will do it for nine francs apiece all round.\"  \"But there are two boys,\" said Mr. George. \"Don't you charge any thing extra for boys?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Vittorio, smiling. He thought at first that Mr. George was going to ask for some abatement on account of a portion of the party being young. \"No, sir; we don't charge any thing extra for them.\"  \"You _would_ charge extra for them, I think,\" said Mr. George, \"if you only knew how much they can eat.\"  Vittorio smiled and said that if the party would pay nine francs apiece all round, he should be satisfied, without asking for any thing extra on account of the boys.  The third item of expense in an Italian journey consists of the _buono manos_. In Italy, and indeed generally in Europe, though especially in Italy, nobody, in rendering you a service, is satisfied with receiving merely what you agreed to pay for the service. Every one expects something over at the end, as a token of your satisfaction with him. If you employ a guide in a town to show you about to the places and things that are curious there, under an agreement that he is to have a dollar a day, he is not satisfied at night if you pay him merely a dollar. He expects twenty cents or a quarter of a dollar over, as a _buono mano_, as it is called. This is the understanding on which the bargain is made.  In the same manner, when you pay your bill at the hotel, the waiter expects you to give him a _buono mano_. If any body renders the vetturino a service along the road, it is the vetturino who pays them, because it is in the agreement that he is to pay the way expenses; but then, after getting their pay from him, and also his _buono mano_, they generally come to the carriage and ask for another _buono mano_ from the party of travellers. Some travellers get vexed and out of patience with this system, and always give, if they give at all, with scowling looks and moody mutterings. Others, seeing how poor all the people are, and how hard it is for them to get their living, are very willing to pay, especially as it is generally only a few cents in each case that is required. Still, unless the traveller understands the system, and prepares himself beforehand with a stock of small change, the _buono mano_ business gives him a good deal of trouble. If he does so provide himself, and if he falls into the custom good naturedly, as one of the established usages of the country, which is moreover not without its advantages, it becomes a source of pleasure to him to pay the poor fellows their expected fees.  \"Rollo,\" said Mr. George, \"I am going to put the whole business of the _buono manos_ into your hands.\"  \"Good!\" said Rollo. \"I'll take the business if you will only give me the money.\"  \"How much will it require, Vittorio, for each day, to do the thing up handsomely?\" asked Mr. George.  Vittorio immediately began to make a calculation. He reckoned in _pauls_, the money which is used most in the central parts of Italy. The substance of his calculation was, that for the whole party about half a dollar would be a proper sum to pay to the domestic at the hotel where they stopped for the night, and a quarter of a dollar or less at noon. Then there were chambermaids, ostlers, and drivers of extra horses or oxen to help up the long hills, all of whom would like a small _buono mano_. This would bring the amount up to about six francs, or a dollar and a quarter a day, on the plan of doing the thing up handsomely, as Mr. George had proposed.  \"You mean to be generous with them, uncle George,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"In travelling in Italy, pay out liberally to every body that renders you any service, but not a sou to beggars. That's my rule.\"  \"Besides,\" he continued, \"it is good policy for us to be generous in this case, for Mrs. Gray will pay two thirds of the money. So that you and I, sitting in the coop, as you call it, will have all the pleasure of the generosity, with only one third of the expense of it.\"  While Mr. George was saying this, he took his wallet out of his pocket, and opened to the compartment of it which contained napoleons.  \"Let us see,\" said he; \"we shall be ten days on the way in going to Naples, and Sunday makes eleven. Six francs a day for eleven days makes sixty-six francs.\"  So saying, he took out three gold napoleons, for the sixty francs, and six francs in silver, and handing the whole to Rollo, said, \"There's the money.\"  \"But, uncle George,\" said Rollo, \"I can't pay the _buono manos_ in gold.\"  \"No,\" said Mr. George; \"you must get the money changed, of course.\"  \"And what shall I get it changed into?\" asked Rollo.  \"I don't know, I'm sure,\" said Mr. George. \"That's for you to find out. We have three different kinds of currency between here and Naples. We are now in Tuscany. After we get through Tuscany we come into the Roman states, and after we get through the Roman states we shall come into the kingdom of the two Sicilies, where Naples is. You will require different money in all these countries, and you must look out and not have any left over, or at least very little, when you cross the frontiers.\"  \"But how shall I manage that?\" asked Rollo.  \"_I_ don't know,\" said Mr. George, \"any more than you do. If I had it to do, I should try to find out. But that is your affair, not mine. You said that if I would give you the money you would take the whole business of the _buono manos_ off my hands. I must go now and see about my arrangement with Mrs. Gray.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"I'll find out what to do.\"  Thus the _buono mano_ question was disposed of.  As to the board, Mr. George made a verbal agreement with Vittorio that he would pay fifty-four francs a day for the whole party, and that, in consideration of that sum, Vittorio was to provide board and lodging for them all, at the best hotels, and in the best style. He paid for five days in advance. At the end of that time, the party were to be at liberty either to continue the system at the same rate, or to abandon it, and pay the bills at the hotels themselves.  In respect to the carriage and horses, Vittorio brought him an agreement, filled up from a printed form, which he and Vittorio signed in duplicate. It was as follows. There was a picture of a carriage and horses at the head of it. I give you the document in the original French. If you are studying French yourself, you can read it. If not, you must ask some one to translate it for you, if you wish to know what it all means.  VITTORIO GONSALVI, VOITURIER.  [Illustration]  FLORENCE, le 22 Mars, 1857.       Par la présente écriture, faite à double original, pour valoir et      pour être strictement observée, comme de droit, par les parties      contractantes, a été fixe, et convenu ce qui suit.       Le propriétaire de voiture, Gonsalvi, domicilié à Rome, promet et      s'oblige de servir Monsieur George Holiday et sa suite dans le      voyage qu'il veut entreprendre de Florence à Napoli, par la voie de      Arezzo, Perugia, Rome, et Terracina, et être conduit par un bon      voiturier, pour le prix convenu de trois cents francs, pour la      voiture et les quatre chevaux.       Moyennant ce paiement, qui s'effectuera moitié avant de partir,      moitié à Napoli, le propriétaire de voiture, ou son conducteur      délégué, est tenu des obligations ci-après designées.       Tous les frais occasionnés pour le passage des fleuves, rivières,      ponts, et montagnes, ainsi que ceux des barrières, seront à la      charge du voiturier conducteur.       L'étrenne d'usage à donner au voiturier conducteur sera selon son      bon service.       Le dit voyage sera fait dans dix jours complets.       Le depart de Florence est fixé dans le journée du 23 courant, a      onze heures matin.       Pour tous les jours en sus, qu'il plairait à dit Monsieur Holiday      de s'arrêter dans une ville, ou qu'il y fut forcé par des      imprévues, il est convenu qu'il payera cinq francs par jour par      cheval pour la nourriture des chevaux.       Le voiturier devra constamment descendre dans de bonnes auberges,      et partira tous les matins de bonne heure, pour arriver tous les      soirs avant la nuit à l'auberge ou l'on devra coucher.       Et pour l'observance des conditions ci-dessus mentionnées, les      parties interessées l'ont volontairement signée.                 GEORGE HOLIDAY,                VITTORIO GONSALVI.  The agreement which Mr. George made with Mrs. Gray was not so difficult to understand. Mrs. Gray did not, as Rollo had predicted, appear unwilling to make a definite arrangement in respect to the respective privileges and rights of the various members of the party in the carriage and at the hotels. She was a very sensible woman, and she saw the propriety of Mr. George's suggestion at once. Mr. George attributed the necessity of it, in part, to there being so many children in the party.  \"Wh"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24488"],["title","Rollo in Naples (#4)"],["body","there are children,\" said he, \"we must have system and a routine.\"  \"That is very true,\" said Mrs. Gray.  \"And the more formal and precise the arrangement is, the better,\" said Mr. George. \"It amuses them, and occupies their minds, to watch the operation of it.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Gray; \"I have no doubt of it.\"  \"Then,\" said Mr. George, \"I will draw up some articles of agreement, and if you approve of them, Rosie shall make a copy of them. Rosie shall keep the copy, too, after she has made it, and shall see that the rules are all observed.\"  \"But what shall I do,\" said Rosie, \"if any body breaks any of the rules?\"  \"Then they must be punished,\" said Mr. George. \"You shall determine what the punishment shall be, and I will see that it is inflicted.\"  So Mr. George drew up a set of rules; but before proposing them to Mrs. Gray and her children, he read them to Rollo. He read as follows:--       I.       The interior of the carriage, all the way, shall belong to Mrs.      Gray and her family, and the _coupé_ to Mr. George and Rollo. Mr.      George or Rollo may, perhaps, sometimes ride inside; but if they do      so, it is to be understood that they ride there as the guests of      Mrs. Gray; and in the same manner, if at any time any of Mrs.      Gray's party ride outside, it will be as the guests of Mr. George      and Rollo.  \"Good!\" said Rollo. \"I like that regulation very much. I shall not want to get inside very often.\"  \"You may sometimes wish to invite Rosie to take your place outside, when it is very pleasant, and you take her place inside,\" suggested Mr. George.  \"No,\" said Rollo; \"there will be room outside for her and me too. She can sit right between you and me.\"  \"And, perhaps, sometimes I may invite Rosie and her brother to come outside and ride with you, while I go inside with Mrs. Gray,\" added Mr. George.  \"_That_ will be a good plan,\" said Rollo. \"But now what is the second rule?\"       II.       On arriving at a hotel for the night, Mrs. Gray is to take her      choice first of all the rooms shown, for herself and Rosie. Then      from the other rooms Mr. George is to choose the bed that he will      sleep in. Then the two boys are to choose from the beds that are      left, each to have the first choice alternately, beginning with      Josie.  \"Why should Josie begin?\" asked Rollo. \"I am the oldest.\"  \"True,\" said Mr. George; \"but it is of no consequence at all which begins, and as _we_ are drawing up the rules, it is polite and proper to give Josie the precedence in such a point.\"  \"Very well,\" said Rollo; \"go on. How about Susannah?\"  \"O, it is not necessary to make any rule about Susannah,\" replied Mr. George. \"I suppose that Mrs. Gray will take her into her room, if there is a spare bed there. If not, they must make some other arrangement for her.\"       III.       Every evening before the party separate for the night, Mrs. Gray      shall decide at what hour we shall set off the next morning, and      also at what hour we shall breakfast, after first hearing what      Vittorio's opinion is as to the best time for setting out.  \"Why can't we have a fixed time for setting out every day?\" asked Rollo, \"and agree about it once for all beforehand.\"  \"Because we have different distances to go on different days,\" said Mr. George, \"so that sometimes we shall have to set out much earlier than will be necessary at other times.\"  \"Then why should not we consult together as to the time?\" asked Rollo. \"I don't see any reason for leaving it altogether to _one_ of the party.\"  \"Why, you see that Mrs. Gray is a lady,\" replied Mr. George, \"and it takes a lady longer to dress and get ready than men. Besides, she has two children to look after.\"  \"And Susannah to help her,\" said Rollo.  \"True,\" said Mr. George; \"still it seems proper that the time for setting out should be fixed by the lady,--of course, after hearing what the vetturino has to say.\"  \"I think so too,\" said Rollo; \"so go on.\"       IV.       Any person who is not ready to sit down to breakfast at the time      which shall have been appointed by Mrs. Gray the evening before, or      who shall not be ready to enter the carriage at the time appointed,      shall pay a fine, except in the case hereinafter provided for. If      the person so behindhand is one of the children, the fine shall be      two cents, or the value thereof in the currency of the country      where we may chance to be; and if it is one of the grown persons,      the fine shall be three times that amount, that is, six cents.  \"Yes; but suppose we don't wake up?\" suggested Rollo.  \"That contingency is provided for in the next article,\" said Mr. George.       V.       It shall be Mr. George's duty to knock at all the bedroom doors      every morning, three quarters of an hour before the time fixed for      breakfast; and if he fails to do so, then he shall pay all the      fines for tardiness that may be incurred that morning by any of the      party.  \"Very good!\" said Rollo.       VI.       It shall be Rosie's duty to decide whether or not any persons are      tardy any morning; and her mother's watch shall be the standard of      time. Her decisions shall be without appeal; and no excuses      whatever shall be heard, nor shall there be any release from the      fine, except in the case of a failure of Mr. George to knock at the      doors, as hereinbefore provided.  \"But we might some of us have a good excuse some time,\" said Rollo.  \"True,\" said Mr. George; \"we doubtless shall. But if we go upon the plan of admitting excuses, then there will be a long debate every morning, on the question whether the excuses are good or not, which will cause a great deal of trouble. It is better for us to pay the fine at once. It is not much, you know.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"go on.\"       VII.       Josie is hereby appointed treasurer, to collect and keep the fines.  \"And what is to be done with the money?\" asked Rollo.  \"You will see,\" said Mr. George.       VIII.       Any one of the party who shall at any time make complaint of any      thing in respect to the carriage, or the riding during the day, or      in respect to the food provided at the hotels, or the rooms, or the      beds, when we stop for the night, except when such complaint      relates to an evil which may be remedied, and is made with a view      to having it remedied, shall be fined one cent, or the value      thereof in the currency of the country. Rosie is to be the sole      judge of the infractions of this rule, and is to impose the fine,      while Josie, as before, is to collect and keep the money.  \"I wish you would make me the treasurer,\" said Rollo.  \"No,\" said Mr. George; \"you have the care of the _buono mano_ fund. Josie shall be treasurer for the fines.\"  \"Very well,\" said Rollo.       IX.       On the arrival of the party at Naples, the amount of the fine money      shall be expended in the famous Neapolitan confectionery, and shall      be divided equally among the three children.  \"Good!\" said Rollo. \"But, uncle George, I don't think you ought to call us _children_ exactly. We are almost all of us twelve or thirteen.\"  \"True,\" said Mr. George, \"you are not children; but what can I call you to distinguish you from the grown persons of the party. The regular and proper designation for persons under age, in a legal document, is _infants_.\"  \"Hoh!\" said Rollo, \"that is worse than _children_.\"  \"I might call you the young persons, or the junior members of the party.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"that will be better; the junior members of the party.\"  So it was agreed to strike out the word _children_ wherever it occurred in the document, and insert in lieu of it the phrase _junior members of the party_.  With this correction the document was read to Mrs. Gray in the hearing of Rosie and Josie. They all approved it in every respect. The draught was then given to Rosie in order that she might make a fair copy of it. When the copy was made, the nine rules were read again in the hearing of the whole party, and all agreed to abide by them.  Thus the arrangements for the journey were complete; and Mrs. Gray, after learning from Vittorio that the first day's journey would not be long, and that it would answer to set out at any time before noon, fixed the hour for departure at eleven o'clock. Vittorio said he would be at the door half an hour before, in order to have time to load the baggage.  [Illustration: READING THE ARTICLES.]     CHAPTER III.  THE JOURNEY.   The journey from Florence to Naples, as planned and provided for by the contracts and agreements described in the last chapter, was prosecuted from day to day, until its completion, in a very successful and prosperous manner. The various contingencies likely to occur having been foreseen and provided for by the contract and the rules, every thing worked smoothly and well, and none of those discussions, disagreements, and misunderstandings occurred, which so often mar the pleasure of parties travelling together in one company for many days.  Mrs. Gray was fined for not being ready for breakfast at the time appointed, on the very first morning after leaving Florence. It was at a place called Arezzo. The time appointed for the breakfast was at seven o'clock. Mr. George knocked at all the doors a little before quarter past six. About quarter before seven the two boys came into the breakfast room, and soon afterwards Mr. George and Rosie came. The breakfast was brought in and set upon the table by the waiter a few minutes before seven. The boys immediately began to set the chairs round.  \"Quick! quick!\" said Josie. \"Let us sit down quick, and mother will be tardy, and have to pay a fine.\"  \"Ah, but it does not go by our sitting down,\" said Rollo. \"It goes by Mrs. Gray's watch.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rosie; \"I have got the watch. It wants a minute of the time now.\"  \"I _hope_ she won't come,\" said Josie.  \"She will come,\" said Rosie. \"She has been almost ready for some time.\"  "]]]
