The clerk, hardly looking up, began going through motions, speaking into telescreens.  The clerk said finally, \"You might have a small wait, sir. Quite a few of the officers involved in this fracas have been renting out taxi-planes almost as fast as they're available.\"  That didn't surprise Joe Mauser. Any competent officer made a point of an aerial survey of the battle reservation before going into a fracas. Aircraft, of course, couldn't be used _during_ the fray, since they postdated the turn of the century, and hence were relegated to the cemetery of military devices along with such items as nuclear weapons, tanks, and even gasoline-propelled vehicles of size to be useful.  Use an aircraft in a fracas, or even _build_ an aircraft for military usage and you'd have a howl go up from the military attaches from the Sov-world that would be heard all the way to Budapest. Not a fracas went by but there were scores, if not hundreds, of military observers, keen-eyed to check whether or not any really modern tools of war were being illegally utilized. Joe Mauser sometimes wondered if the West-world observers, over in the Sov-world, were as hair fine in their living up to the rules of the Universal Disarmament Pact. Probably. But, for that matter, they didn't have the same system of fighting fracases over there, as in the West.  Joe took a chair while he waited and thumbed through a fan magazine. From time to time he found his own face in such publications. He was a third-rate celebrity, really. Luck hadn't been with him so far as the buffs were concerned. They wanted spectacular victories, murderous situations in which they could lose themselves in vicarious sadistic thrills. Joe had reached most of his peaks while in retreat, or commanding a holding action. His officers appreciated him and so did the ultra-knowledgeable fracas buffs--but he was all but an unknown to the average dim wit who spent most of his life glued to the Telly set, watching men butcher each other.  On the various occasions when matters had pickled and Joe had to fight his way out against difficult odds, using spectacular tactics in desperation, he was almost always off camera. Purely luck. On top of skill, determination, experience and courage, you had to have luck in the Military Category to get anywhere.  This time Joe was going to manufacture his own.  A voice said, \"Ah, Captain Mauser.\"  Joe looked up, then came to his feet quickly. In automatic reflex, he began to come to the salute but then caught himself. He said stiffly, \"My compliments, Marshal Cogswell.\"  The other was a smallish man, but strikingly strong of face and strongly built. His voice was clipped, clear and had the air of command as though born with it. He, like Joe, wore mufti and now extended his hand to be shaken.  \"I hear you've signed up with Baron Haer, captain. I was rather expecting you to come in with me. Had a place for a good aide de camp. Liked your work in that last fracas we went through together.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" Joe said. Stonewall Cogswell was as good a tactician as freelanced and he was more than that. He was a judge of men and a stickler for detail. And right now, if Joe Mauser knew Marshal Stonewall Cogswell as well as he thought, Cogswell was smelling a rat. There was no reason why old pro Joe Mauser should sign up with a sure loser like Vacuum Tube when he could have earned more shares taking a commission with Hovercraft.  He was looking at Joe brightly, the question in his eyes. Three or four of his staff were behind a few paces, looking polite, but Cogswell didn't bring them into the conversation. Joe knew most by sight. Good men all. Old pros all. He felt another twinge of doubt.  Joe had to cover. He said, \"I was offered a particularly good contract, sir. Too good to resist.\"  The other nodded, as though inwardly coming to a satisfactory conclusion. \"Baron Haer's connections, eh? He's probably offered to back you for a bounce in caste. Is that it, Joe?\"  Joe Mauser flushed. Stonewall Cogswell knew what he was talking about. He'd been born into Middle status himself and had become an Upper the hard way. His path wasn't as long as Joe's was going to be, but long enough and he knew how rocky the climb was. How very rocky.  Joe said, stiffly, \"I'm afraid I'm in no position to discuss my commander's military contracts, marshal. We're in mufti, but after all--\"  Cogswell's lean face registered one of his infrequent grimaces of humor. \"I understand, Joe. Well, good luck and I hope things don't pickle for you in the coming fracas. Possibly we'll find ourselves aligned together again at some future time.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" Joe said, once more having to catch himself to prevent an automatic salute.  Cogswell and his staff went off, leaving Joe looking after them. Even the marshal's staff members were top men, any of whom could have conducted a divisional magnitude fracas. Joe felt the coldness in his stomach again. Although it must have looked like a cinch, the enemy wasn't taking any chances whatsoever. Cogswell and his officers were undoubtedly here at the airport for the same reason as Joe. They wanted a thorough aerial reconnaissance of the battlefield-to-be, before the issue was joined.         *       *       *  Max was standing at his elbow. \"Who was that, sir? Looks like a real tough one.\"  \"He is a real tough one,\" Joe said sourly. \"That's Stonewall Cogswell, the best field commander in North America.\"  Max pursed his lips. \"I never seen him out of uniform before. Lots of times on Telly, but never out of uniform. I thought he was taller than that.\"  \"He fights with his brains,\" Joe said, still looking after the craggy field marshal. \"He doesn't have to be any taller.\"  Max scowled. \"Where'd he ever get that nickname, sir?\"  \"Stonewall?\" Joe was turning to resume his chair and magazine. \"He's supposed to be a student of a top general back in the American Civil War. Uses some of the original Stonewall's tactics.\"  Max was out of his depth. \"American Civil War? Was that much of a fracas, captain? It musta been before my time.\"  \"It was quite a fracas,\" Joe said dryly. \"Lot of good lads died. A hundred years after it was fought, the _reasons_ it was fought seemed about as valid as those we fight fracases for today. Personally I--\"  He had to cut it short. They were calling him on the address system. His aircraft was ready. Joe made his way to the hangars, followed by Max Mainz. He was going to pilot the airplane himself and old Stonewall Cogswell would have been surprised at what Joe Mauser was looking for.     V   By the time they had returned to quarters, there was a message waiting for Captain Mauser. He was to report to the officer commanding reconnaissance.  Joe redressed in the Haer kilts and proceeded to headquarters.  The officer commanding reconnaissance turned out to be none other than Balt Haer, natty as ever, and, as ever, arrogantly tapping his swagger stick against his leg.  \"Zen! Captain,\" he complained. \"Where have you been? Off on a trank kick? We've got to get organized.\"  Joe Mauser snapped him a salute. \"No, sir. I rented an aircraft to scout out the terrain over which we'll be fighting.\"  \"Indeed. And what were your impressions, captain?\" There was an overtone which suggested that it made little difference what impressions a captain of cavalry might have gained.  Joe shrugged. \"Largely mountains, hills, woods. Good reconnaissance is going to make the difference in this one. And in the fracas itself cavalry is going to be more important than either artillery or infantry. A Nathan Forrest fracas, sir. A matter of getting there fustest with the mostest.\"  Balt Haer said amusedly. \"Thanks for your opinion, captain. Fortunately, our staff has already come largely to the same conclusions. Undoubtedly, they'll be glad to hear your wide experience bears them out.\"  Joe said evenly, \"It's a rather obvious conclusion, of course.\" He took this as it came, having been through it before. The dilettante amateur's dislike of the old pro. The amateur in command who knew full well he was less capable than many of those below him in rank.  \"Of course, captain,\" Balt Haer flicked his swagger stick against his leg. \"But to the point. Your squadron is to be deployed as scouts under my overall command. You've had cavalry experience, I assume.\"  \"Yes, sir. In various fracases over the past fifteen years.\"  \"Very well. Now then, to get to the reason I have summoned you. Yesterday in my father's office you intimated that you had some grandiose scheme which would bring victory to the Haer colors. But then, on some thin excuse, refused to divulge just what the scheme might be.\"  Joe Mauser looked at him unblinkingly.  Balt Haer said: \"Now I'd like to have your opinion on just how Vacuum Tube Transport can extract itself from what would seem a poor position at best.\"  In all there were four others in the office, two women clerks fluttering away at typers, and two of Balt Haer's junior officers. They seemed only mildly interested in the conversation between Balt and Joe.  Joe wet his lips carefully. The Haer scion was his commanding officer. He said, \"Sir, what I had in mind is a new gimmick. At this stage, if I told anybody and it leaked, it'd never be effective, not even this first time.\"  Haer observed him coldly. \"And you think me incapable of keeping your secret, ah, _gimmick_, I believe is the idiomatic term you used.\"  Joe Mauser's eyes shifted around the room, taking in the other four, who were now looking at him.  Bait Haer rapped, \"These members of my staff are all trusted Haer employees, Captain Mauser. They are not fly-by-"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24370"],["title","Mercenary (#6)"],["body","freelancers hired for a week or two.\"  Joe said, \"Yes, sir. But it's been my experience that one person can hold a secret. It's twice as hard for two, and from there on it's a decreasing probability in a geometric ratio.\"  The younger Haer's stick rapped the side of his leg, impatiently. \"Suppose I inform you that this is a command, captain? I have little confidence in a supposed gimmick that will rescue our forces from disaster and I rather dislike the idea of a captain of one of my squadrons dashing about with such a bee in his bonnet when he should be obeying my commands.\"  Joe kept his voice respectful. \"Then, sir, I'd request that we take the matter to the Commander in Chief, your father.\"  \"Indeed!\"  Joe said, \"Sir, I've been working on this a long time. I can't afford to risk throwing the idea away.\"  Bait Haer glared at him. \"Very well, captain. I'll call your bluff, come along.\" He turned on his heel and headed from the room.  Joe Mauser shrugged in resignation and followed him.         *       *       *       *       *  The old Baron wasn't much happier about Joe Mauser's secrets than was his son. It had only been the day before that he had taken Joe on, but already he had seemed to have aged in appearance. Evidently, each hour that went by made it increasingly clear just how perilous a position he had assumed. Vacuum Tube Transport had elbowed, buffaloed, bluffed and edged itself up to the outskirts of the really big time. The Baron's ability, his aggressiveness, his flair, his political pull, had all helped, but now the chips were down. He was up against one of the biggies, and this particular biggy was tired of ambitious little Vacuum Tube Transport.  He listened to his son's words, listened to Joe's defense.  He said, looking at Joe, \"If I understand this, you have some scheme which you think will bring victory in spite of what seems a disastrous situation.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  The two Haers looked at him, one impatiently, the other in weariness.  Joe said, \"I'm gambling everything on this, sir. I'm no Rank Private in his first fracas. I deserve to be given some leeway.\"  Balt Haer snorted. \"Gambling everything! What in Zen would _you_ have to gamble, captain? The whole Haer family fortunes are tied up. Hovercraft is out for blood. They won't be satisfied with a token victory and a negotiated compromise. They'll devastate us. Thousands of mercenaries killed, with all that means in indemnities; millions upon million in expensive military equipment, most of which we've had to hire and will have to recompensate for. Can you imagine the value of our stock after Stonewall Cogswell has finished with us? Why, every two by four trucking outfit in North America will be challenging us, and we won't have the forces to meet a minor skirmish.\"  Joe reached into an inner pocket and laid a sheaf of documents on the desk of Baron Malcolm Haer. The Baron scowled down at them.  Joe said simply, \"I've been accumulating stock since before I was eighteen and I've taken good care of my portfolio in spite of taxes and the various other pitfalls which make the accumulation of capital practically impossible. Yesterday, I sold all of my portfolio I was legally allowed to sell and converted to Vacuum Tube Transport.\" He added, dryly, \"Getting it at an excellent rate, by the way.\"  Balt Haer mulled through the papers, unbelievingly. \"Zen!\" he ejaculated. \"The fool really did it. He's sunk a small fortune into our stock.\"  Baron Haer growled at his son, \"You seem considerably more convinced of our defeat than the captain, here. Perhaps I should reverse your positions of command.\"  His son grunted, but said nothing.  Old Malcolm Haer's eyes came back to Joe. \"Admittedly, I thought you on the romantic side yesterday, with your hints of some scheme which would lead us out of the wilderness, so to speak. Now I wonder if you might not really have something. Very well, I respect your claimed need for secrecy. Espionage is not exactly an antiquated military field.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  But the Baron was still staring at him. \"However, there's more to it than that. Why not take this great scheme to Marshal Cogswell? And yesterday you mentioned that the Telly sets of the nation would be tuned in on this fracas, and obviously you are correct. The question becomes, what of it?\"  The fat was in the fire now. Joe Mauser avoided the haughty stare of young Balt Haer and addressed himself to the older man. \"You have political pull, sir. Oh, I know you don't make and break presidents. You couldn't even pull enough wires to keep Hovercraft from making this a divisional magnitude fracas--but you have pull enough for my needs.\"  Baron Haer leaned back in his chair, his barrel-like body causing that article of furniture to creak. He crossed his hands over his stomach. \"And what are your needs, Captain Mauser?\"  Joe said evenly, \"If I can bring this off, I'll be a fracas buff celebrity. I don't have any illusions about the fickleness of the Telly fans, but for a day or two I'll be on top. If at the same time I had your all out support, pulling what strings you could reach--\"  \"Why then, you'd be promoted to Upper, wouldn't you, captain?\" Balt Haer finished for him, amusement in his voice.  \"That's what I'm gambling on,\" Joe said evenly.  The younger Haer grinned at his father superciliously. \"So our captain says he will defeat Stonewall Cogswell in return for you sponsoring his becoming a member of the nation's elite.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Good Heavens, is the supposed cream of the nation now selected on no higher a level than this?\" There was sarcasm in the words.  The three men turned. It was the girl Joe had bumped into the day before. The Haers didn't seem surprised at her entrance.  \"Nadine,\" the older man growled. \"Captain Joseph Mauser who has been given a commission in our forces.\"  Joe went through the routine of a Middle of officer's rank being introduced to a lady of Upper caste. She smiled at him, somewhat mockingly, and failed to make standard response.  Nadine Haer said, \"I repeat, what is this service the captain can render the house of Haer so important that pressure should be brought to raise him to Upper caste? It would seem unlikely that he is a noted scientist, an outstanding artist, a great teacher--\"  Joe said, uncomfortably, \"They say the military is a science, too.\"  Her expression was almost as haughty as that of her brother. \"Do they? I have never thought so.\"  \"Really, Nadine,\" her father grumbled. \"This is hardly your affair.\"  \"No? In a few days I shall be repairing the damage you have allowed, indeed sponsored, to be committed upon the bodies of possibly thousands of now healthy human beings.\"  Balt said nastily, \"Nobody asked you to join the medical staff, Nadine. You could have stayed in your laboratory, figuring out new methods of preventing the human race from replenishing itself.\"  The girl was obviously not the type to redden, but her anger was manifest. She spun on her brother. \"If the race continues its present maniac course, possibly more effective methods of birth control _are_ the most important development we could make. Even to the ultimate discovery of preventing all future conception.\"  Joe caught himself in mid-chuckle.  But not in time. She spun on him in his turn. \"Look at yourself in that silly skirt. A professional soldier! A killer! In my opinion the most useless occupation ever devised by man. Parasite on the best and useful members of society. Destroyer by trade!\"  Joe began to open his mouth, but she overrode him. \"Yes, yes. I know. I've read all the nonsense that has accumulated down through the ages about the need for, the glory of, the sacrifice of the professional soldier. How they defend their country. How they give all for the common good. Zen! What nonsense.\"  Balt Haer was smirking sourly at her. \"The theory today is, Nadine, old thing, that professionals such as the captain are gathering experience in case a serious fracas with the Sovs ever develops. Meanwhile his training is kept at a fine edge fighting in our inter-corporation, inter-union, or union-corporation fracases that develop in our private enterprise society.\"  She laughed her scorn. \"And what a theory! Limited to the weapons which prevailed before 1900. If there was ever real conflict between the Sov-world and our own, does anyone really believe either would stick to such arms? Why, aircraft, armored vehicles, yes, and nuclear weapons and rockets, would be in overnight use.\"  Joe was fascinated by her furious attack. He said, \"Then, what would you say was the purpose of the fracases, Miss--\"  \"Circuses,\" she snorted. \"The old Roman games, all over again, and a hundred times worse. Blood and guts sadism. The quest of a frustrated person for satisfaction in another's pain. Our Lowers of today are as useless and frustrated as the Roman proletariat and potentially they're just as dangerous as the mob that once dominated Rome. Automation, the second industrial revolution, has eliminated for all practical purposes the need for their labor. So we give them bread and circuses. And every year that goes by the circuses must be increasingly sadistic, death on an increasing scale, or they aren't satisfied. Once it was enough to have fictional mayhem, cowboys and Indians, gangsters, or G.I.s versus the Nazis, Japs or Commies, but that's passed. Now we need _real_ blood and guts.\"  Baron Haer snapped finally, \"All right, Nadine. We've heard this lecture before. I doubt if the captain is interested, particularly since you don't seem to be able to get beyond the protesting stage and have yet to come up with an answer.\"  \"I have an answer!\"  \"Ah?\" Balt Haer raised his eyebrows, mockingly.  \"Yes! Overthrow this silly status society. Resume the road to progress. Put our people to useful endeavor, instead of sitting in front of their Telly sets, taking trank pills to put them in a happy daze and watching sadistic"]]]
