The memory banks of my previous activations are available.\"  \"_All_ of them? Can you remember everything?\"  \"I can remember everything that is in my memory banks.\"  The girl's voice rose to a wail. \"But you _don't_ remember! You _always_ forgot things! They took things out each time you were reactivated, don't you remember?\"  \"I cannot remember that which is not contained in my memory banks, Jack. That is a contradiction in terms.\"  \"But I was always able to _fix_ it before!\" The tears in her eyes were audible in her voice. \"I'd tell you to remember, and I'd tell you _what_ to remember, and you'd _remember_ it! Tell me what's happened to you this time!\"  \"I cannot tell you. The information is not in my data banks.\"  Slowly, I got to my feet. Two gees isn't much, once you get used to it. The headache had subsided to a dull, bearable throb.  I was on a couch in a room just below the control chamber, and Jack Ravenhurst's voice was coming down from above. McGuire's voice was all around me, coming from the hidden speakers that were everywhere in the ship.  \"But why won't you obey me any more, McGuire?\" she asked.  \"I'll answer that, McGuire,\" I said.  Jack's voice came weakly from the room above. \"Mr. Oak? Dan? Thank heaven you're all right!\"  \"No thanks to you, though,\" I said. I was trying to climb the ladder to the control room, and my voice sounded strained.  \"You've got to do something!\" she said with a touch of hysteria. \"McGuire is taking us straight toward Cygnus at two gees and won't stop.\"  My thinking circuits began to take over again. \"Cut the thrust to half a gee, McGuire. Ease it down. Take a minute to do it.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  The gravity pull of acceleration let up slowly as I clung to the ladder. After a minute, I climbed on up to the control room.  Jack Ravenhurst was lying on the acceleration couch, looking swollen-faced and ill. I sat down on the other couch.  \"I'm sorry I hit you,\" she said. \"Really.\"  \"I believe you. How long have we been moving, McGuire?\"  \"Three hours, twelve minutes, seven seconds, sir,\" said McGuire.  \"I didn't want anyone to know,\" Jack said. \"Not anyone. That's why I hit you. I didn't know McGuire was going to go crazy.\"  \"He's not crazy, Jack,\" I said carefully. \"This time, he has a good chance of remaining sane.\"  \"But he's not McGuire any more!\" she wailed. \"He's different! Terrible!\"  \"Sure he's different. You should be thankful.\"  \"But what happened?\"  I leaned back on the couch. \"Listen to me, Jack, and listen carefully. You think you're pretty grown up, and, in a lot of ways you are. But no human being, no matter how intelligent, can store enough experience into seventeen years to make him or her wise. A wise choice requires data, and gathering enough data requires time.\" That wasn't exactly accurate, but I had to convince her.  \"You're pretty good at controlling people, aren't you, Jack. A real powerhouse. Individuals, or mobs, you can usually get your own way. It was your idea to send you to Luna, not your father's. It was your idea to appoint yourself my assistant in this operation. It was you who planted the idea that the failure of the McGuire series was due to Thurston's activities.  \"You used to get quite a kick out of controlling people. And then you were introduced to McGuire One. I got all the information on that. You were fifteen, and, for the first time in your life, you found an intelligent mind that couldn't be affected at all by that emotional field you project so well. Nothing affected McGuire but data. If you told him something, he believed it. Right, McGuire?\"  \"I do not recall that, sir.\"  \"Fine. And, by the way, McGuire--the data you have been picking up in the last few hours, since your activation, is to be regarded as unique data. It applies only to Jaqueline Ravenhurst, and is not to be assumed relevant to any other person unless I tell you otherwise.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"That's what I don't understand!\" Jack said unhappily. \"I stole the two keys that were supposed to activate McGuire. He was supposed to obey the first person who activated him. But _I_ activated him, and he won't obey!\"  \"You weren't listening to what Midguard said, Jack,\" I said gently. \"He said: 'The first _man's_ voice he hears will be identified as his master.'\"  \"You'd been talking to every activation of McGuire. You'd ... well, I won't say you'd fallen in love with him, but it was certainly a schoolgirl crush. You found that McGuire didn't respond to emotion, but only to data and logic.  \"You've always felt rather inferior in regard to your ability to handle logic, haven't you, Jack?\"  \"Yes ... yes. I have.\"  \"Don't cry, now; I'm only trying to explain it to you. There's nothing wrong with your abilities.\"  \"No?\"  \"No. But you wanted to be able to think like a man, and you couldn't. You think like a woman! And what's wrong with that? Nothing! Your method of thinking is just as good as any man's, and better than most of 'em.  \"You found you could handle people emotionally, and you found it was so easy that you grew contemptuous. The only mind that responded to your logic was McGuire's. But your logic is occasionally as bad as your feminine reasoning is good. So, every time you talked to McGuire, you eventually gave him data that he couldn't reconcile in his computations. If he did reconcile them, then his thinking had very little in common with the actual realities of the universe, and he behaved in non-survival ways.  \"McGuire was your friend, your brother, your Father Confessor. He never made judgments or condemned you for anything you did. All he did was sit there and soak up troubles and worries that he couldn't understand or use. Each time, he was driven mad.  \"The engineers and computermen and roboticists who were working on it were too much under your control to think of blaming you for McGuire's troubles. Even Brock, in spite of his attitude of the tough guy watching over a little girl, was under your control to a certain degree. He let you get away with all your little pranks, only making sure that you didn't get hurt.\"  She nodded. \"They were all so easy. So very easy. I could speak nonsense and they'd listen and do what I told them. But McGuire didn't accept nonsense, I guess.\" She laughed a little. \"So I fell in love with a machine.\"  \"Not _a_ machine,\" I said gently. \"Six of them. Each time the basic data was pumped into a new McGuire brain, you assumed that it was the same machine you'd known before with a little of its memory removed. Each time, you'd tell it to 'remember' certain things, and, of course, he did. If you tell a robot that a certain thing is in his memory banks, he'll automatically put it there and treat it as a memory.  \"To keep you from ruining him a seventh time, we had them put in one little additional built-in inhibition. McGuire won't take orders from a woman.\"  \"So, even after I turned him on, he still wouldn't take orders from me,\" she said. \"But when you came in, he recognized you as his master.\"  \"If you want to put it that way.\"  Again, she laughed a little. \"I know why he took off from Ceres. When I hit you, you said, 'Get away'. McGuire had been given his first order, and he obeyed it.\"'  \"I had to say something,\" I said. \"If I'd had time, I'd have done a little better.\"  She thought back. \"You said, '_We_ had them add that inhibition.' Who's _we_?\"  \"I can't tell you yet. But we need young women like you, and you'll be told soon enough.\"  \"Evidently they need men like you, too,\" she said. \"You don't react to an emotional field, either.\"  \"Oh, yes, I do. Any human being does. But I use it; I don't fight it. And I don't succumb to it.\"  \"What do we do now?\" she asked. \"Go back to Ceres?\"  \"That's up to you. If you do, you'll be accused of stealing McGuire, and I don't think it can be hushed up at this stage of the game.\"  \"But I can't just run away.\"  \"There's another out,\" I said. \"We'll have a special ship pick us up on one of the nearer asteroids and leave McGuire there. We'll be smuggled back, and we'll claim that McGuire went insane again.\"  She shook her head. \"No. That would ruin Father, and I can't do that, in spite of the fact that I don't like him very much.\"  \"Can you think of any other solution?\"  \"No,\" she said softly.  \"Thanks. But you have. All I have to do is take it to Shalimar Ravenhurst. He'll scream and yell, but he has a sane ship--for a while. Between the two of us. I think we can get everything straightened out.\"  \"But I want to go to school on Luna.\"  \"You can do that, too. And I'll see that you get special training, from special teachers. You've got to learn to control that technique of yours.\"  \"You have that technique, don't you? And you can control it. You're wonderful.\"  I looked sharply at her and realized that I had replaced McGuire as the supermind in her life.  I sighed. \"Maybe in another three or four years,\" I said. \"Meanwhile, McGuire, you can head us for Raven's Rest.\"  \"Home, James,\" said Jack Ravenhurst.  \"I am McGuire,\" said McGuire.

The moon, temporarily obscured by heavy clouds, gave some light now and then, which but served to make the succeeding darkness more intense. Suddenly the silence was broken by the clatter of galloping hoofs, and two riders, leaving the highway, rode into the woods on their left. The shorter of the two men muttered an oath as his horse stumbled over the uneven ground.  \"Take care, Symonds,\" said his companion quickly, and he ducked his head to avoid the bare branches of a huge tree. \"How near are we now to Poolesville?\"  \"About seven miles by the road,\" was the gruff reply; \"but this short cut will soon bring us there. And none too soon,\" he added, glancing at their weary horses. \"Still, Captain Lloyd, we have done a good night's work.\"  \"I think Colonel Baker will be satisfied,\" agreed Lloyd.  \"And friend Schmidt, now that he sees the game is up, will probably turn state's evidence.\"  Lloyd shook his head. \"I doubt if Schmidt can tell us much. He is too leaky a vessel for a clever spy to trust with valuable information.\"  \"But,\" objected Symonds, \"that is a very important paper you found in his possession to-night.\"  \"True; but that paper does not furnish us with any clue as to the identity of the spy in Washington. Schmidt is simply a go-between like many other sutlers. Probably that paper passed through three or four hands before it was given to him to carry between the lines.\"  \"Well, there is one thing certain; Baker will make Schmidt talk if any man can,\" declared Symonds. \"May I ask, Captain, why we are headed for Poolesville?\"  \"Because I am looking for the man higher up. I expect to get some trace of the spy's identity in or around Poolesville.\"  \"You may,\" acknowledged the Secret Service agent doubtfully; \"and again you may not. Poolesville used to be called the 'rebs' post-office,' and they do say that word of every contemplated movement of McClellan's army was sent through that village to Leesburg by the 'grape-vine telegraph.'\"  \"Yes, I know,\" was the brief reply. The two men spoke in lowered tones as they made what speed they could among the trees. \"By the way, Symonds, has it ever been discovered who it was delayed the despatch from Burnside, asking for the pontoon bridges?\"  \"No, never a trace, worse luck; but do you know,\" drawing his horse closer to his companion, \"I think that and the Allen disaster were accomplished by one and the same person.\"  \"Those two and a good many others we haven't yet heard of,\" agreed Lloyd. \"In fact, it was to trace this particular unknown that I was recalled from service at the front by Pinkerton, and detailed to join the branch of the Secret Service under Colonel Baker.\"  \"We have either arrested or frightened away most of the informers inside the city,\" volunteered Symonds, after a brief silence. \"Besides which, Washington is too well guarded nowadays--two years ago was a different matter. Now, the general commanding the Maryland border patrols declares that a pigeon cannot fly across the Potomac without getting shot.\"  Lloyd's answer was lost as Symonds' horse stumbled again, recovered himself, and after a few halting steps went dead lame. In a second Symonds had dismounted, and, drawing off his glove, felt the animal's leg.  \"Strained a tendon,\" he growled, blowing on his numb fingers to warm them. \"I'll have to lead him to the road; it is over there,\" pointing to a slight dip in the ground. \"You go ahead, sir; it's lucky I know the country.\"  As the two men reached the edge of the wood and stood debating a moment, they were disturbed by the distant sound of hoof beats.  \"Get over on that side of the road,\" whispered Lloyd, \"and keep out of sight behind that tree; leave your horse here.\"  Symonds did as he was told none too soon. Around the bend of the road came a horseman. Quickly Lloyd's challenge rang out:  \"Halt, or I fire!\"  As he spoke, Lloyd swung his horse across the narrow road.  Swerving instinctively to the right, the newcomer was confronted by Symonds, who had stepped from behind the tree, revolver in hand. An easy target for both sides, the rider had no choice in the matter. Checking his frightened horse, he called:  \"Are you Yanks or rebels?\"  Symonds lowered his revolver. He knew that a Confederate picket would not be apt to use the word \"rebels.\"  \"We are Yanks,\" he answered, \"and you?\"  \"A friend.\"  \"Advance, friend,\" ordered Lloyd, \"but put your right hand up. Now,\" as the rider approached him, \"where did you come from, and where are you going?\"  \"From Harper's Ferry, bearing despatches to Adjutant-General Thomas in Washington from General John Stevenson, commanding this district.\"  \"How did you come to take this cut?\" demanded Symonds.  \"I rode down the tow path until I reached Edward's Ferry, then cut across here, hoping to strike the turnpike. It's freezing on the tow-path.\" As he spoke the trooper pulled the collar of his heavy blue overcoat up about his ears until it nearly met his cavalry hat.  The clouds were drifting away from before the moon, and a ray of light illuminated the scene. Lloyd inspected the trooper suspiciously; his story sounded all right, but ...  \"Your regiment?\" he asked.  \"The First Maryland Potomac Home Brigade, Colonel Henry A. Cole. I am attached to headquarters as special messenger.\"  \"Let me see your despatch.\"  \"Hold on,\" retorted the trooper. \"First, tell me who you are.\"  \"That's cool,\" broke in Symonds. \"I guess you will show it to us whether you want to or not. Seems to me, young man,\" glancing closely at the latter's mount, \"your horse is mighty fresh, considering you have ridden such a distance.\"  \"We in the cavalry know how to keep our horses in good condition, as well as ride them.\" The trooper pointed derisively at Symonds' sorry nag standing with drooping head by the roadside.  \"None of your lip,\" growled Symonds angrily; his poor riding was a sore subject. Further discussion was cut short by Lloyd's peremptory order:  \"Come; I am waiting; give me the despatch,\" and, as the trooper still hesitated, \"we are agents of the United States Secret Service.\"  \"In that case, sir.\" The trooper's right hand went to the salute; then he unbuttoned his coat, and fumbled in his belt. \"Here it is, sir.\"  As Lloyd bent forward to take the expected paper, he received instead a crashing blow on the temple from the butt end of a revolver, which sent him reeling from the saddle. At the same time, Symonds, who had hold of the trooper's bridle, was lifted off his feet by the sudden rearing of the horse, and before he had collected his wits, he was dashed violently to one side and thrown on the icy ground.  Symonds staggered to his feet, but at that instant the trooper, who was some distance away, swerved suddenly toward the woods, and his broad cavalry hat was jerked from his head by a low-hanging branch. His horse then bolted into the middle of the road, and for a second the "]]]
