I have often seen it. It was a green stone, with brown irregular spots on it. It was a little longer than a goose's egg, and about the same thickness. When he brought it home and covered it with a hat, Belcher's little boy was one of the first to look into the hat, and as he did so, he said he saw a candle. The second time he looked in he exclaimed, 'I've found my hatchet' (it had been lost two years), and immediately ran for it to the spot shown him through the stone, and it was there. The boy was soon beset by neighbors far and near to reveal to them hidden things, and he succeeded marvellously. Joe Smith, conceiving the idea of making a fortune through a similar process of 'seeing,' bought the stone of Belcher, and then began his operations in directing where hidden treasures could be found. His first diggings were near Capt. Buck's sawmill, at Red Rock; but because the followers broke the rule of silence, 'the enchantment removed the deposit.'\"  One of many stories of Joe's treasure-digging, current in that neighborhood, Miss Blackman narrates. Learning from a strolling Indian of a place where treasure was said to be buried, Joe induced a farmer named Harper to join him in digging for it and to spend a considerable sum of money in the enterprise. \"After digging a great hole, that is still to be seen,\" the story continues, \"Harper got discouraged, and was about abandoning the enterprise. Joe now declared to Harper that there was an 'enchantment' about the place that was removing the treasure farther off; that Harper must get a perfectly white dog (some said a black one), and sprinkle his blood over the ground, and that would prevent the 'enchantment' from removing the treasure. Search was made all over the country, but no perfectly white dog could be found. Then Joe said a white sheep would do as well; but when this was sacrificed and failed, he said The Almighty was displeased with him for attempting to palm off on Him a white sheep for a white dog.\" This informant describes Joe at that time as \"an imaginative enthusiast, constitutionally opposed to work, and a general favorite with the ladies.\"  In confirmation of this, R. C. Doud asserted that \"in 1822 he was employed, with thirteen others, by Oliver Harper to dig for gold under Joe's direction on Joseph McKune's land, and that Joe had begun operations the year previous.\"  F. G. Mather obtained substantially the same particulars of Joe's digging in connection with Harper from the widow of Joseph McKune about the year 1879, and he said that the owner of the farm at that time \"for a number of years had been engaged in filling the holes with stone to protect his cattle, but the boys still use the northeast hole as a swimming pond in the summer.\"*      * Lippincott's Magazine, August, 1880.   Confirmation of the important parts of these statements has been furnished by Joseph's father. When the reports of the discovery of a new Bible first gained local currency (in 1830), Fayette Lapham decided to visit the Smith family, and learn what he could on the subject. He found the elder Smith very communicative, and he wrote out a report of his conversation with him, \"as near as I can repeat his words,\" he says, and it was printed in the Historical Magazine for May, 1870. Father Smith made no concealment of his belief in witchcraft and other things supernatural, as well as in the existence of a vast amount of buried treasure. What he said of Joe's initiation into \"crystal-gazing\" Mr. Lapham thus records:--  \"His son Joseph, whom he called the illiterate,* when he was about fourteen years of age, happened to be where a man was looking into a dark stone, and telling people therefrom where to dig for money and other things. Joseph requested the privilege of looking into the stone, which he did by putting his face into the hat where the stone was. It proved to be not the right stone for him; but he could see some things, and among them he saw the stone, and where it was, in which he could see whatever he wished to see.... The place where he saw the stone was not far from their house, and under pretence of digging a well, they found water and the stone at a depth of twenty or twenty-two feet. After this, Joseph spent about two years looking into this stone, telling fortunes, where to find lost things, and where to dig for money and other hidden treasures.\"      * Joe's mother, describing Joe's descriptions to the family, at their evening fireside, of the angel's revelations concerning the golden plates, says (p. 84): \"All giving the most profound attention to a boy eighteen years of age, who had never read the Bible through in his life; he seemed much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of our children.\"  If further confirmation of Joe's early knowledge on this subject is required, we may cite the Rev. John A. Clark, D.D., who, writing in 1840 after careful local research, said: \"Long before the idea of a golden Bible entered their [the Smiths'] minds, in their excursions for money-digging.... Joe used to be usually their guide, putting into a hat a peculiar stone he had, through which he looked to decide where they should begin to dig.\"*      * \"Gleanings by the Way\" (1842), p. 225.   We come now to the history of Joe's own \"peek-stone\" (as the family generally called it), that which his father says he discovered by using the one that he first saw. Willard Chase, of Manchester, New York, near Palmyra, employed Joe and his brother Alvin some time in the year 1822 (as he fixed the date in his affidavit)* to assist him in digging a well. \"After digging about twenty feet below the surface of the earth,\" he says, \"we discovered a singularly appearing stone which excited my curiosity. I brought it to the top of the well, and as we were examining it, Joseph put it into his hat and then his face into the top of the hat. It has been said by Smith that he brought the stone from the well, but this is false. There was no one in the well but myself. The next morning he came to me and wished to obtain the stone, alleging that he could see in it; but I told him I did not wish to part with it on account of its being a curiosity, but would lend it. After obtaining the stone, he began to publish abroad what wonders he could discover by looking in it, and made so much disturbance among the credulous part of the community that I ordered the stone to be returned to me again. He had it in his possession about two years.\" Joseph's brother Hyrum borrowed the stone some time in 1825, and Mr. Chase was unable to recover it afterward. Tucker describes it as resembling a child's foot in shape, and \"of a whitish, glassy appearance, though opaque.\"**      * Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" p. 240.      ** Tucker closes his chapter about this stone with the declaration \"that the origin [of Mormonism] is traceable to the insignificant little stone found in the digging of Mr. Chase's well in 1822.\" Tucker was evidently ignorant both of Joe's previous experience with \"crystal-gazing\" in Pennsylvania and of \"crystal-gazing\" itself.   The Smiths at once began turning Chase's stone to their own financial account, but no one at the time heard that it was giving them any information about revealed religion. For pay they offered to disclose by means of it the location of stolen property and of buried money. There seemed to be no limit to the exaggeration of their professions. They would point out the precise spot beneath which lay kegs, barrels, and even hogsheads of gold and silver in the shape of coin, bars, images, candlesticks, etc., and they even asserted that all the hills thereabout were the work of human bands, and that Joe, by using his \"peek-stone,\" could see the caverns beneath them.* Persons can always be found to give at least enough credence to such professions to desire to test them. It was so in this case. Joe not only secured small sums on the promise of discovering lost articles, but he raised money to enable him to dig for larger treasure which he was to locate by means of the stone. A Palmyra man, for instance, paid seventy-five cents to be sent by him on a fool's errand to look for some stolen cloth.      * William Stafford's affidavit, Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" p. 237.   Certain ceremonies were always connected with these money-digging operations. Midnight was the favorite hour, a full moon was helpful, and Good Friday was the best date. Joe would sometimes stand by, directing the digging with a wand. The utmost silence was necessary to success. More than once, when the digging proved a failure, Joe explained to his associates that, just as the deposit was about to be reached, some one, tempted by the devil, spoke, causing the wished-for riches to disappear. Such an explanation of his failures was by no means original with Smith, the serious results of an untimely spoken word having been long associated with divers magic performances. Joe even tried on his New York victims the Pennsylvania device of requiring the sacrifice of a black sheep to overcome the evil spirit that guarded the treasure. William Stafford opportunely owned such an animal, and, as he puts it, \"to gratify my curiosity,\" he let the Smiths have it. But some new \"mistake in the process\" again resulted in disappointment. \"This, I believe,\" remarks the contributor of the sheep, \"is the only time they ever made money-digging a profitable business.\" The Smiths ate the sheep.  These money-seeking enterprises were continued from 1820 to 1827 (the year of the delivery to Smith of the golden plates). This period covers the years in which Joe, in his autobiography, confesses that he \"displayed the corruption of human nature.\" He explains that his father's family were poor, and that they worked where they could find employment to their taste; \"sometimes we were at home and sometimes abroad.\" Some of these trips took them to Pennsylvania, and the stories of Joe's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24430"],["title","Nights With Uncle Remus (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net              NIGHTS WITH     UNCLE REMUS      BY      JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS      WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY MILO WINTER      [Illustration]      BOSTON AND NEW YORK     HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY     The Riverside Press Cambridge     1917       COPYRIGHT, 1851, 1853, 1909, AND 1911, BY THE CENTURY CO.

FOX AND MISS GOOSE]  NIGHTS WITH UNCLE REMUS  I  MR. FOX AND MISS GOOSE   It had been raining all day so that Uncle Remus found it impossible to go out. The storm had begun, the old man declared, just as the chickens were crowing for day, and it had continued almost without intermission. The dark gray clouds had blotted out the sun, and the leafless limbs of the tall oaks surrendered themselves drearily to the fantastic gusts that drove the drizzle fitfully before them. The lady to whom Uncle Remus belonged had been thoughtful of the old man, and 'Tildy, the house-girl, had been commissioned to carry him his meals. This arrangement came to the knowledge of the little boy at supper time, and he lost no time in obtaining permission to accompany 'Tildy.  Uncle Remus made a great demonstration over the thoughtful kindness of his \"Miss Sally.\"  \"Ef she ain't one blessid w'ite 'oman,\" he said, in his simple, fervent way, \"den dey ain't none un um 'roun' in deze parts.\"  With that he addressed himself to the supper, while the little boy sat by and eyed him with that familiar curiosity common to children. Finally the youngster disturbed the old man with an inquiry:--  \"Uncle Remus, do geese stand on one leg all night, or do they sit down to sleep?\"  \"Tooby sho' dey does, honey; dey sets down same ez you does. Co'se, dey don't cross der legs,\" he added, cautiously, \"kase dey sets down right flat-footed.\"  \"Well, I saw one the other day, and he was standing on one foot, and I watched him and watched him, and he kept on standing there.\"  \"Ez ter dat,\" responded Uncle Remus, \"dey mought stan' on one foot en drap off ter sleep en fergit deyse'f.
