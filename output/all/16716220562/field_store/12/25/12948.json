The passage of the forts had been obstructed by a raft or chain anchored between them.  The forts once overcome, no other defence remained to be encountered until English Turn was reached, where earthworks had been thrown up on both banks.  Here at Chalmette, on the left bank, it was that, in 1815, Jackson, with his handful of raw levies, so signally defeated Wellington's veterans of the Peninsula, under the leadership of the fearless Pakenham.  Fort St. Philip stands about 700 yards higher up the river than Fort Jackson; the river at this point is about 800 yards wide, and the distance between the nearest salients of the main works is about 1,000 yards.  A vessel attempting to run the gauntlet of the batteries would be under fire while passing over a distance of three and a half miles.  The river was now high, and the banks, everywhere below the river level, and only protected from inundation by the levees, were overflowed.  There was no standing room for an investing army; the lower guns were under water, and in the very forts the platforms were awash.  When the fleet was ready, Butler embarked eight regiments and three batteries under Phelps and Williams on transports, and, going to the head of the passes, held his troops in readiness to co-operate with the navy.  On the 16th of April the fleet took up its position. The mortar-boats, or \"bombers,\" as they began to be called, were anchored between 3,000 and 4,000 yards below Fort Jackson, upon which the attack was mainly to be directed.  From the view of those in the fort, the boats that lay under the right bank were covered by trees.  Those on the opposite side of the river were screened, after a fashion, by covering their hulls with reeds and willows, cut for the purpose.  On the 18th of April the bombardment began.  It soon became evident that success was not to be attained in this way, and Farragut determined upon passing the forts with his fleet.  Should he fail in reducing them by this movement, Butler was to land in the rear of Fort St. Philip, near Quarantine, and carry the works by storm. Accordingly, he remained with his transports below the forts, and waited for the hour.  Shepley occupied Ship Island with the rest of the force.  Early in March the raft, formed of great cypress trees, forty feet long and fifty inches through, laid lengthwise in the river about three feet apart, anchored by heavy chains and strengthened by massive cross-timbers, had been partly carried away by the flood. To make good the damage, a number of large schooners had then been anchored in the gap.  On the morning of the 21st of April this formidable obstruction was cleverly and in a most gallant manner broken through by the fleet.  On the night of the 23d of April, Farragut moved to the attack. His fleet, organized in three divisions of eight, three, and six vessels respectively, was formed in line ahead.  The first division was led by Captain Bailey, in the _Cayuga_, followed by the _Pensacola, Mississippi, Oneida, Varuna, Katahdin, Kineo_, and _Wissahickon;_ the second division followed, composed of Farragut's flag-ship, the _Hartford_, Commander Richard Wainwright, the _Brooklyn_, and the _Richmond;_ while the third division, forming the rear of the column, was led by Captain Bell, in the _Sciota_, followed by the _Iroquois, Kennebec, Pinola, Itasca,_ and _Winona_.  At half-past two o'clock on the morning of the 24th of April the whole fleet was under way; a quarter of an hour later the batteries of Forts Jackson and St. Philip opened simultaneously upon the _Cayuga_.  It was some time before the navy could reply, but soon every gun was in action.  Beset by perils on every hand, the fleet pressed steadily up the river.  The Confederate boats were destroyed, the fire-rafts were overcome, the gunners of the forts were driven from their guns, and when the sun rose Farragut was above the forts with the whole of his fleet, except the _Itasca, Winona_, and _Kennebec_, which put back disabled, and the _Varuna_, sunk by the Confederate gunboats.  The next afternoon, having made short work of Chalmette, Farragut anchored off New Orleans, and held the town at his mercy.  The casualties were 37 killed and 147 wounded, in all 184.  The Confederate loss was 50, 11 killed and 39 wounded.  The _Louisiana, McCrea_, and _Defiance_, sole survivors of the Confederate fleet, escaping comparatively unhurt, took refuge under the walls of Fort St. Philip.  Leaving Phelps, with the 30th Massachusetts and 12th Connecticut and Manning's 4th Massachusetts battery, at the head of the passes, in order to be prepared to occupy the works immediately on their surrender, Butler hastened with the rest of his force to Sable Island in the rear of Fort St. Philip.  When the transports came to anchor on the morning of the 26th, the Confederate flags on Forts St. Philip and Jackson were plainly visible to the men on board, while these, in their turn, were seen from the forts.  Here the troops received the news of Farragut's arrival at New Orleans. On the morning of the 28th they saw the Confederate ram _Louisiana_ blown up while floating past the forts, and on the same day Jones landed with the 26th Massachusetts and Paine with two companies of the 4th Wisconsin and a detachment of the 21st Indiana, to work their way through a small canal to Quarantine, six miles above Fort St. Philip, for the purpose of seizing the narrow strip by which the garrison must escape, if at all.  This was only accomplished by a long and tiresome transport in boats, and finally by wading. However, at half-past two on the afternoon of the 28th April, the Confederate flags over Forts Jackson and St. Philip were observed to disappear; the national ensign floated in their stead; and soon it became known that Duncan had surrendered to Porter.  Porter immediately took possession and held it until Phelps came up the river to relieve him.  Then Major Whittemore, of the 30th Massachusetts, with about two hundred men of his regiment, landed and took command at Fort St. Philip, while Manning occupied Fort Jackson.  Almost simultaneously the frigate _Mississippi_ came down the river, bringing Jones with the news that his regiment was at Quarantine, holding both banks of the river, and thus effectually sealing the last avenue of escape; for at this time the levee formed the only pathway.  On the 29th Phelps put Deming in command of Fort Jackson, intending to leave his regiment, the 12th Connecticut, in garrison there, and to place Dudley, with the 30th Massachusetts, at Fort St. Philip; but before this arrangement could be carried out, orders came from Butler, designating the 26th Massachusetts as the garrison of the two forts, with Jones in command.  Phelps, with his force, was directed to New Orleans.  On the 1st of May Butler landed at New Orleans and took military possession of the city.  Simultaneously, at five o'clock in the afternoon, the 31st Massachusetts with a section of Everett's 6th Massachusetts battery, and six companies of the 4th Wisconsin, under Paine, disembarked and marched up the broad levee to the familiar airs that announced the joint coming of \"Yankee Doodle\" and of \"Picayune Butler.\"  The outlying defences on both banks of the river and on the lakes were abandoned by the Confederates without a struggle.  Forts Pike and Wood, on Lake Pontchartrain, were garrisoned by detachments from the 7th Vermont and 8th New Hampshire regiments.  The 21st Indiana landed at Algiers, and marching to Brashear, eighty miles distant on Berwick Bay, took possession of the New Orleans and Opelousas railway.  New Orleans itself was occupied by the 30th and 31st Massachusetts, the 4th Wisconsin and 6th Michigan, 9th and 12th Connecticut, 4th and 6th Massachusetts batteries, 2d Vermont battery, and Troops A and B of the Massachusetts cavalry. At Farragut's approach Lovell, seeing that further resistance was useless, abandoned New Orleans to its fate and withdrew to Camp Moore, distant seventy-eight miles, on the line of the Jackson railway.   CHAPTER II. THE FIRST ATTEMPT ON VICKSBURG.  With the capture of New Orleans the first and vital object of the expedition had been accomplished.  The occupation of Baton Rouge by a combined land and naval force was the next point indicated in McClellan's orders to Butler.  Then he was to endeavor to open communication with the northern column coming down the Mississippi. McClellan was no longer General-in-chief; but this part of his plan represented the settled views of the government.  On the 2d of May, therefore, Farragut sent Craven with the _Brooklyn_ and six other vessels of the fleet up the river.  On the 8th, as early as the river transports could be secured, Butler sent Williams with the 4th Wisconsin and the 6th Michigan regiments, and two sections of Everett's 6th Massachusetts battery, to follow and accompany the fleet.  The next day Williams landed his force at Bonnet Carr√©, on the east bank of the river, about thirty-five miles above the town.  After wading about five miles through a swamp, where the water and mud were about three feet deep, the troops halted at night at Frenier, a station of the Jackson railway, situated on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, about ten miles above Kenner.  A detachment of the 4th Wisconsin, under Major Boardman, was sent to Pass Manchac.  The Confederates made a slight but ineffective resistance with artillery, resulting in trivial losses on either side.  The bridges at Pass Manchac and Frenier being then destroyed, on the following morning, the 10th, the troops marched back the weary ten miles along the uneven trestle-work of the railway from Frenier to Kenner and there took transport.  After their long confinement on shipboard, with scant rations, without exercise or even freedom of movement, the excessive heat of the day caused the troops"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24606"],["title","History of the Nineteenth Army Corps (#3)"],["body"," suffer severely.  The embarkation completed, the transports, under convoy of the navy, set out for Baton Rouge. There on the morning of the 12th of May the troops landed, the capitol was occupied by the 4th Wisconsin, and the national colors were hoisted over the building.  The troops then re-embarked for Vicksburg.  Natchez surrendered on the 12th of May to Commander S. Phillips Lee, of the _Oneida_, the advance of Farragut's fleet.  On the 18th of May the _Oneida_ and her consorts arrived off Vicksburg, and the same day Williams and Lee summoned \"the authorities\" to surrender the town and \"its defences to the lawful authority of the United States.\"  To this Brigadier-General Martin L. Smith, commander of the defences, promptly replied:  \"Having been ordered here to hold these defences, my intention is to do so as long as it is in my power.\"  On the 19th the transports stopped for wood at Warrenton, about ten miles below Vicksburg, and here a detachment of the 4th Wisconsin, sent to guard the working party, became involved in a skirmish with the Confederates, in which Sergeant-Major N. H. Chittenden and Private C. E. Perry, of A Company, suffered the first wounds received in battle by the troops of the United States in the Department of the Gulf.  The Confederates were easily repulsed, with small loss.  Almost at the instant when Farragut was decided to run the gauntlet of the forts, Beauregard had begun to fortify Vicksburg.  Up to this time he had trusted the defence of the river above New Orleans to Fort Pillow, Helena, and Memphis.  When Smith took command at Vicksburg on the 12th of May, in accordance with the orders of Lovell, the department commander, three of the ten batteries laid out for the defence of the position had been nearly completed and a fourth had been begun.  These batteries were intended for forty-eight guns from field rifles to 10-inch columbiads. The garrison was to be 3,000 strong, but at this time the only troops present were parts of two Louisiana regiments.  When the fleet arrived, on the 18th, six of the ten batteries had been completed, and two days later twenty-three heavy guns were in place and the defenders numbered more than 2,600.  The guns of the navy could not be elevated sufficiently for their projectiles to reach the Confederate batteries on the bluff, and the entire land-force, under Williams, was less than 1,100 effectives. Even had it been possible by a sudden attack to surprise and overcome the garrison and seize the bluffs, the whole available force of the Department of the Gulf would have been insufficient to hold the position for a week, as things then stood.  The truth is that the northern column with which, following their orders, Butler and Farragut were now trying to co-operate had ceased to exist; Jackson meant Beauregard's rear; and, as for any co-operation between Halleck and Williams, Beauregard stood solidly between them.  On the 17th of April, the day before Porter's mortars first opened upon Forts Jackson and St. Philip, the whole land force of this northern column, under Pope, at that moment preparing for the attack on Fort Pillow, had been withdrawn by imperative orders from Halleck, and, on the very evening before the attack on Fort Pillow was to have been made, had gone to swell the great army assembled under Halleck at Corinth; but as yet neither Butler nor Farragut knew anything of all this.  Save by the tedious roundabout of Washington, New York, the Atlantic, and the Gulf, there was at this time no regular or trustworthy means of communication between the forces descending the Mississippi and those that had just achieved the conquest of New Orleans and were now ascending the river to co-operate with the northern column.  Thus it was that a single word, daubed in a rude scrawl upon the walls of the custom-house, meeting the eyes of Paine's men after they had made a way into the building with their axes, gave to Butler the first intelligence of the desperate battle of the 6th and 7th of April, on which the fate of the whole Union campaign in the West had been staked, if not imperilled, and which in its result was destined to change materially the whole course of operations in the Gulf Department.  That word was Shiloh.  By the 26th of May the _Oneida_ had been joined by the rest of the fleet, under the personal command of the restless and energetic flag-officer.  On the afternoon of this day the fleet opened fire. The Confederates replied sparingly, as much to economize their ammunition and to keep the men fresh, as to avoid giving the Union commanders information regarding the range and effect of their fire.  The river was now falling.  The _Hartford_ in coming up had already grounded hard, and so remained helpless for fifty hours, and had only been got off by incredible exertions.  Provisions of all kinds were running very low.  On the 25th of May, after a thorough reconnoissance, Farragut and Williams decided to give up the attempt on Vicksburg as evidently impracticable.  Farragut left Palmer with the _Iroquois_ and six gunboats to blockade the river and to amuse the garrison at Vicksburg by an occasional bombardment in order to prevent Smith from sending reinforcements to Corinth.  While Williams was descending the river on the 26th, the transports were fired into by the Confederate battery on the bluff at Grand Gulf, sixty miles below Vicksburg.  About sixty rounds were fired in all, many of which passed completely through the transport _Laurel Hill_, bearing the 4th Wisconsin, part of the 6th Michigan, and the 6th Massachusetts battery.  One private of the 6th Michigan was killed and Captain Chauncey J. Bassett, of the same regiment, wounded.  The _Ceres_, bearing the remainder of the 6th Michigan and the 6th Massachusetts battery, was following the _Laurel Hill_ and was similarly treated.  After a stern chase of about twenty miles, the convoy was overhauled, and the gunboat _Kineo_, returning, shelled the town and caused the withdrawal of the battery.  During the evening Williams sent four companies of the 4th Wisconsin, under Major Boardman, to overtake the enemy's battery and break up the camp, about one mile and a half in the rear of the town. Boardman came upon the Confederates as they were retiring, and shots were exchanged.  The casualties were few, but Lieutenant George DeKay, a gallant and attractive young officer, serving as aide-de-camp to General Williams, received a mortal wound.  On the 29th the troops under Williams once more landed and took post at Baton Rouge.  During their absence of seventeen days, the Confederates had improved the opportunity to remove much valuable property that had been found stored in the arsenal on the occasion of the first landing of the Union forces.  On his return to New Orleans Farragut received pressing orders from the Navy Department to take Vicksburg.  He therefore returned with his fleet, reinforced by a detachment of the mortar flotilla, and Butler once more despatched Williams, this time with an increased force, to co-operate.  Williams left Baton Rouge on the morning of the 20th of June with a force composed of the 30th Massachusetts, 9th Connecticut, 7th Vermont, and 4th Wisconsin regiments, Nims's 2d Massachusetts battery and two sections of Everett's 6th Massachusetts battery.  This time a garrison was left to hold Baton Rouge, consisting of the 21st Indiana and 6th Michigan regiments, the remaining section of Everett's battery and Magee's Troop C of the Massachusetts cavalry battalion.  On the 22d of June the transports arrived off Ellis's Cliffs, twelve miles below Natchez, where Williams found three gunboats waiting to convoy him past the high ground.  Here he landed a detachment consisting of the 30th Massachusetts regiment and two guns of Nims's battery to turn the supposed position of two field-pieces said to have been planted by the Confederates on the bluffs, while a second force, composed of the 4th Wisconsin, 9th Connecticut, the other two sections of Nims's battery, and the four guns of Everett's, marched directly forward up the cliff road.  An abandoned caisson or limber was all that the troops found.  On the 24th, anticipating more serious resistance from the guns said to be in position on the bluffs at Grand Gulf, Williams entered Bayou Pierre with his whole force in the early morning, intending to strike the crossing, about seventeen miles up the stream, of the railway from Port Gibson to Grand Gulf, and thence to move directly on the rear of the town.  Half-way up the bayou the boats were stopped by obstructions and had to back down again.  Toward noon the troops landed and marched on Grand Gulf in two detachments, one under Paine, consisting of the 4th Wisconsin and 9th Connecticut regiments and a section of Nims's battery; the other, under Dudley, embracing the remainder of the force.  Paine had a short skirmish with the enemy near Grand Gulf, and captured eight prisoners, but their camp, a small one, was found abandoned.  The same evening the troops re-embarked, and on the 25th arrived before Vicksburg.  The orders from Butler, under which Williams was now acting, required him to take or burn Vicksburg at all hazards.  Here, too, we catch the first glimpse of the famous canal upon which so much labor was to be expended during the next year with so little result.  \"You will send up a regiment or two at once,\" Butler said, \"and cut off the neck of land beyond Vicksburg by means of a trench, making a gap about four feet deep and five feet wide.\"  To accomplish this purpose Williams had with him four regiments and ten guns, making an effective force in all less than three thousand, rapidly diminished by hard work, close quarters, meagre rations, and a bad climate nearly at its worst.  On the 24th of June the _Monarch_, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred W. Ellet, arrived in the reach above Vicksburg.  This was one of the nondescript fleet of rams, planned, built,"]]]
