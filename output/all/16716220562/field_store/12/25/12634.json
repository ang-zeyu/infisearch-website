[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24286"],["title","The Birds' Christmas Carol (#2)"],["body"," please,      and let Uncle Jack in for the holidays. I am coming with such a      trunk full of treasures that you'll have to borrow the stockings of      Barnum's Giant and Giantess; I am coming to squeeze a certain      little lady-bird until she cries for mercy; I am coming to see if I      can find a boy to take care of a black pony that I bought lately.      It's the strangest thing I ever knew; I've hunted all over Europe,      and can't find a boy to suit me! I'll tell you why. I've set my      heart on finding one with a dimple in his chin, because this pony      particularly likes dimples! [\"Hurrah!\" cried Hugh; \"bless my dear      dimple; I'll never be ashamed of it again.\"]       Please drop a note to the clerk of the weather, and have a good,      rousing snow-storm--say on the twenty-second. None of your meek,      gentle, nonsensical, shilly-shallying snow-storms; not the sort      where the flakes float lazily down from the sky as if they didn't      care whether they ever got here or not and then melt away as soon      as they touch the earth, but a regular business-like whizzing,      whirring, blurring, cutting snow-storm, warranted to freeze and      stay on!       I should like rather a LARGE Christmas tree, if it's convenient:      not one of those \"sprigs,\" five or six feet high, that you used to      have three or four years ago, when the birdlings were not fairly      feathered out; but a tree of some size. Set it up in the garret, if      necessary, and then we can cut a hole in the roof if the tree      chances to be too high for the room.       Tell Bridget to begin to fatten a turkey. Tell her that by the      twentieth of December that turkey must not be able to stand on its      legs for fat, and then on the next three days she must allow it to      recline easily on its side, and stuff it to bursting. (One ounce of      stuffing beforehand is worth a pound afterwards.)       The pudding must be unusually huge, and darkly, deeply,      lugubriously blue in color. It must be stuck so full of plums that      the pudding itself will ooze out into the pan and not be brought on      to the table at all. I expect to be there by the twentieth, to      manage these little things myself,--remembering it is the early      Bird that catches the worm,--but give you the instructions in case      I should be delayed.       And Carol must decide on the size of the tree--she knows best, she      was a Christmas child; and she must plead for the snow-storm--the      \"clerk of the weather\" may pay some attention to her; and she must      look up the boy with the dimple for me--she's likelier to find him      than I am, this minute. She must advise about the turkey, and      Bridget must bring the pudding to her bedside and let her drop      every separate plum into it and stir it once for luck, or I'll not      eat a single slice--for Carol is the dearest part of Christmas to      Uncle Jack, and he'll have none of it without her. She is better      than all the turkeys and puddings and apples and spare-ribs and      wreaths and garlands and mistletoe and stockings and chimneys and      sleigh-bells in Christendom! She is the very sweetest Christmas      Carol that was ever written, said, sung, or chanted, and I am      coming as fast as ships and railway trains can carry me, to tell      her so.  Carol's joy knew no bounds. Mr. and Mrs. Bird laughed like children and kissed each other for sheer delight, and when the boys heard it they simply whooped like wild Indians; until the Ruggles family, whose back yard joined their garden, gathered at the door and wondered what was \"up\" in the big house.  [Illustration]     IV  \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER\"   Uncle Jack did really come on the twentieth. He was not detained by business, nor did he get left behind nor snowed up, as frequently happens in stories, and in real life too, I am afraid. The snow-storm came also; and the turkey nearly died a natural and premature death from overeating. Donald came, too; Donald, with a line of down upon his upper lip, and Greek and Latin on his tongue, and stores of knowledge in his handsome head, and stories--bless me, you couldn't turn over a chip without reminding Donald of something that happened \"at College.\" One or the other was always at Carol's bedside, for they fancied her paler than she used to be, and they could not bear her out of sight. It was Uncle Jack, though, who sat beside her in the winter twilights. The room was quiet, and almost dark, save for the snow-light outside, and the flickering flame of the fire, that danced over the \"Sleeping Beauty's\" face and touched the Fair One's golden locks with ruddier glory. Carol's hand (all too thin and white these latter days) lay close clasped in Uncle Jack's, and they talked together quietly of many, many things.  \"I want to tell you all about my plans for Christmas this year, Uncle Jack,\" said Carol, on the first evening of his visit, \"because it will be the loveliest one I ever had. The boys laugh at me for caring so much about it; but it isn't altogether because it is Christmas, nor because it is my birthday; but long, long ago, when I first began to be ill, I used to think, the first thing when I waked on Christmas morning, 'To-day is Christ's birthday--_and mine_!' I did not put the words close together, you know, because that made it seem too bold; but I first said, 'Christ's birthday,' out loud, and then, in a minute, softly to myself--'_and mine_!' 'Christ's birthday--_and mine_!' And so I do not quite feel about Christmas as other girls do. Mamma says she supposes that ever so many other children have been born on that day. I often wonder where they are, Uncle Jack, and whether it is a dear thought to them, too, or whether I am so much in bed, and so often alone, that it means more to me. Oh, I do hope that none of them are poor, or cold, or hungry; and I wish--I wish they were all as happy as I, because they are really my little brothers and sisters. Now, Uncle Jack dear, I am going to try and make somebody happy every single Christmas that I live, and this year it is to be the 'Ruggleses in the rear.'\"  \"That large and interesting brood of children in the little house at the end of the back garden?\"  \"Yes; isn't it nice to see so many together?--and, Uncle Jack, why do the big families always live in the small houses, and the small families in the big houses? We ought to call them the Ruggles children, of course; but Donald began talking of them as the 'Ruggleses in the rear,' and Papa and Mamma took it up, and now we cannot seem to help it. The house was built for Mr. Carter's coachman, but Mr. Carter lives in Europe, and the gentleman who rents his place for him doesn't care what happens to it, and so this poor family came to live there. When they first moved in, I used to sit in my window and watch them play in their back yard; they are so strong, and jolly, and good-natured;--and then, one day, I had a terrible headache, and Donald asked them if they would please not scream quite so loud, and they explained that they were having a game of circus, but that they would change and play 'Deaf and Dumb Asylum' all the afternoon.\"  \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Uncle Jack, \"what an obliging family, to be sure!\"  \"Yes, we all thought it very funny, and I smiled at them from the window when I was well enough to be up again. Now, Sarah Maud comes to her door when the children come home from school, and if Mamma nods her head, 'Yes,' that means 'Carol is very well,' and then you ought to hear the little Ruggleses yell,--I believe they try to see how much noise they can make; but if Mamma shakes her head, 'No,' they always play at quiet games. Then, one day, 'Cary,' my pet canary, flew out of her cage, and Peter Ruggles caught her and brought her back, and I had him up here in my room to thank him.\"  \"Is Peter the oldest?\"  \"No; Sarah Maud is the oldest--she helps do the washing; and Peter is the next. He is a dress-maker's boy.\"  \"And which is the pretty little red-haired girl?\"  \"That's Kitty.\"  \"And the fat youngster?\"  \"Baby Larry.\"  \"And that--most freckled one?\"  \"Now, don't laugh--that's Peoria.\"  \"Carol, you are joking.\"  \"No, really, Uncle dear. She was born in Peoria; that's all.\"  \"And is the next boy Oshkosh?\"  \"No,\" laughed Carol, \"the others are Susan, and Clement, and Eily, and Cornelius; they all look exactly alike, except that some of them have more freckles than the others.\"  \"How did you ever learn all their names?\"  \"Why, I have what I call a 'window-school.' It is too cold now; but in warm weather I am wheeled out on my balcony, and the Ruggleses climb up and walk along our garden fence, and sit down on the roof of our carriage-house. That brings them quite near, and I tell them stories. On Thanksgiving Day they came up for a few minutes,--it was quite warm at eleven o'clock,--and we told each other what we had to be thankful for; but they gave such queer answers that Papa had to run away for fear of laughing; and I couldn't understand them very well. Susan was thankful for '_trunks_,' of all things in the world; Cornelius, for 'horse-cars;' Kitty, for 'pork steak;' while Clem, who is very quiet, brightened up when I came to him, and said he was thankful for '_his lame puppy_.' Wasn't that pretty?\"  \"It might teach some of us a lesson, mightn't it, little girl?\"  \"That's what Mamma said. Now I'm going to give this whole Christmas to the Ruggleses; and, Uncle Jack, I earned part of the money myself.\"  \"You, my bird; how?\"  \"Well, you see, it could not be my own, own Christmas if Papa gave me all the money, and I thought to really keep Christ's birthday I ought to do something of my very own; and so I talked with Mamma. Of course she thought of something lovely; she always does: Mamma's head is just brimming over with lovely thoughts,--all I have to do is ask, and out pops the very one I want. This thought was to let her write down,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24286"],["title","The Birds' Christmas Carol (#3)"],["body"," as I told her, a description of how a child lived in her own room for three years, and what she did to amuse herself; and we sent it to a magazine and got twenty-five dollars for it. Just think!\"  \"Well, well,\" cried Uncle Jack, \"my little girl a real author! And what are you going to do with this wonderful 'own' money of yours?\"  \"I shall give the nine Ruggleses a grand Christmas dinner here in this very room--that will be Papa's contribution,--and afterwards a beautiful Christmas tree, fairly blooming with presents--that will be my part; for I have another way of adding to my twenty-five dollars, so that I can buy nearly anything I choose. I should like it very much if you would sit at the head of the table, Uncle Jack, for nobody could ever be frightened of you, you dearest, dearest, dearest thing that ever was! Mamma is going to help us, but Papa and the boys are going to eat together downstairs for fear of making the little Ruggleses shy; and after we've had a merry time with the tree we can open my window and all listen together to the music at the evening church-service, if it comes before the children go. I have written a letter to the organist, and asked him if I might have the two songs I like best. Will you see if it is all right?\"                                           BIRDS' NEST, DECEMBER 21, 188-.       DEAR MR. WILKIE,--I am the little girl who lives next door to the      church, and, as I seldom go out, the music on practice days and      Sundays is one of my greatest pleasures.       I want to know if you can have \"Carol, brothers, carol,\" on      Christmas night, and if the boy who sings \"My ain countree\" so      beautifully may please sing that too. I think it is the loveliest      thing in the world, but it always makes me cry; doesn't it you?       If it isn't too much trouble, I hope they can sing them both quite      early, as after ten o'clock I may be asleep.                                Yours respectfully,                               CAROL BIRD.       P.S.--The reason I like \"Carol, brothers, carol,\" is because the      choir-boys sang it eleven years ago, the morning I was born, and      put it into Mamma's head to call me Carol. She didn't remember then      that my other name would be Bird, because she was half asleep, and      could only think of one thing at a time. Donald says if I had been      born on the Fourth of July they would have named me \"Independence,\"      or if on the twenty-second of February, \"Georgina,\" or even      \"Cherry,\" like Cherry in \"Martin Chuzzlewit;\" but I like my own      name and birthday best.                                Yours truly,                               CAROL BIRD.     Uncle Jack thought the letter quite right, and did not even smile at her telling the organist so many family items.  The days flew by as they always fly in holiday time, and it was Christmas Eve before anybody knew it. The family festival was quiet and very pleasant, but almost overshadowed by the grander preparations for the next day. Carol and Elfrida, her pretty German nurse, had ransacked books, and introduced so many plans, and plays, and customs, and merry-makings from Germany, and Holland, and England, and a dozen other countries, that you would scarcely have known how or where you were keeping Christmas. Even the dog and the cat had enjoyed their celebration under Carol's direction. Each had a tiny table with a lighted candle in the centre, and a bit of Bologna sausage placed very near it; and everybody laughed till the tears stood in their eyes to see Villikins and Dinah struggle to nibble the sausages, and at the same time to evade the candle flame. Villikins barked, and sniffed, and howled in impatience, and after many vain attempts succeeded in dragging off the prize, though he singed his nose in doing it. Dinah, meanwhile, watched him placidly, her delicate nostrils quivering with expectation, and, after all the excitement had subsided, walked with dignity to the table, her beautiful gray satin trail sweeping behind her, and, calmly putting up one velvet paw, drew the sausage gently down, and walked out of the room without turning a hair, so to speak. Elfrida had scattered handfuls of seed over the snow in the garden, that the wild birds might have a comfortable breakfast next morning, and had stuffed bundles of dry grasses in the fireplaces, so that the reindeer of Santa Claus could refresh themselves after their long gallops across country. This was really only done for fun, but it pleased Carol.  And when, after dinner, the whole family had gone to the church to see the Christmas decorations, Carol limped out on her slender crutches, and with Elfrida's help, placed all the family boots in a row in the upper hall. That was to keep the dear ones from quarreling all through the year. There were Papa's stout top boots; Mamma's pretty buttoned shoes next; then Uncle Jack's, Donald's, Paul's, and Hugh's; and at the end of the line her own little white worsted slippers. Last, and sweetest of all, like the children in Austria, she put a lighted candle in her window to guide the dear Christ-child, lest he should stumble in the dark night as he passed up the deserted street. This done, she dropped into bed, a rather tired, but very happy Christmas fairy.  [Illustration]     V  SOME OTHER BIRDS ARE TAUGHT TO FLY   Before the earliest Ruggles could wake and toot his five-cent tin horn, Mrs. Ruggles was up and stirring about the house, for it was a gala day in the family. Gala day! I should think so! Were not her nine \"childern\" invited to a dinner-party at the great house, and weren't they going to sit down free and equal with the mightiest in the land? She had been preparing for this grand occasion ever since the receipt of Carol Bird's invitation, which, by the way, had been speedily enshrined in an old photograph frame and hung under the looking-glass in the most prominent place in the kitchen, where it stared the occasional visitor directly in the eye, and made him livid with envy:--                                           BIRDS' NEST, December 17, 188-.       DEAR MRS. RUGGLES,--I am going to have a dinner-party on Christmas      Day, and would like to have all your children come. I want them      every one, please, from Sarah Maud to Baby Larry. Mamma says      dinner will be at half past five, and the Christmas tree at seven;      so you may expect them home at nine o'clock. Wishing you a Merry      Christmas and a Happy New Year, I am                                Yours truly,                               CAROL BIRD.     Breakfast was on the table promptly at seven o'clock, and there was very little of it, too; for it was an excellent day for short rations, though Mrs. Ruggles heaved a sigh as she reflected that the boys, with their India-rubber stomachs, would be just as hungry the day after the dinner-party as if they had never had any at all.  As soon as the scanty meal was over, she announced the plan of the campaign: \"Now, Susan, you an' Kitty wash up the dishes; an' Peter, can't yer spread up the beds, so't I can git ter cuttin' out Larry's new suit? I ain't satisfied with his clo'es, an' I thought in the night of a way to make him a dress out o' my old red plaid shawl--kind o' Scotch style, yer know, with the fringe 't the bottom.--Eily, you go find the comb and take the snarls out the fringe, that's a lady! You little young ones clear out from under foot! Clem, you and Con hop into bed with Larry while I wash yer underflannins; 'twon't take long to dry 'em.--Yes, I know it's bothersome, buy yer can't go int' s'ciety 'thout takin' some trouble, 'n' anyhow I couldn't git round to 'em last night.--Sarah Maud, I think 'twould be perfeckly han'som' if you ripped them brass buttons off yer uncle's _po_liceman's coat 'n' sewed 'em in a row up the front o' yer green skirt. Susan, you must iron out yours 'n' Kitty's apurns; 'n' there, I come mighty near forgettin' Peory's stockin's! I counted the whole lot last night when I was washin' of 'em, 'n' there ain't but nineteen anyhow yer fix 'em, 'n' no nine pairs mates nohow; 'n' I ain't goin' ter have my childern wear odd stockin's to a dinner-comp'ny, fetched up as I was!--Eily, can't you run out and ask Mis' Cullen ter lend me a pair o' stockin's for Peory, 'n' tell her if she will, Peory'll give Jim half her candy when she gets home. Won't yer, Peory?\"  Peoria was young and greedy, and thought the remedy so out of all proportion to the disease, that she set up a deafening howl at the projected bargain--a howl so rebellious and so entirely out of season that her mother started in her direction with flashing eye and uplifted hand; but she let it fall suddenly, saying, \"No, I vow I won't lick ye Christmas Day, if yer drive me crazy; but speak up smart, now, 'n' say whether yer'd ruther give Jim Cullen half yer candy or go bare-legged ter the party?\" The matter being put so plainly, Peoria collected her faculties, dried her tears, and chose the lesser evil, Clem having hastened the decision by an affectionate wink, that meant he'd go halves with her on his candy.  \"That's a lady!\" cried her mother. \"Now, you young ones that ain't doin' nothin', play all yer want ter before noontime, for after ye git through eatin' at twelve o'clock me 'n' Sarah Maud's goin' ter give yer sech a washin' 'n' combin' 'n' dressin' as yer never had before 'n' never will agin likely, 'n' then I'm goin' to set yer down 'n' give yer two solid hours trainin' in manners; 'n' 'twon't be no foolin' neither.\"  \"All we've got ter do's go eat!\" grumbled Peter.  \"Well, that's enough,\" responded his mother; \"there's more'n one way of eatin', let me tell yer, 'n' you've got a heap ter learn about it, Peter Ruggles. Land sakes, I wish you childern could see the way I was fetched up to eat. I never took a meal o' vittles in the kitchen before I married Ruggles; but yer can't keep up that style with nine young ones 'n' yer Pa always off"]]]
