Now every fellow knows what a proboscis monkey is, as he did not before except by name. I got my books out, and read him up with the animal before me. I am glad I did; for the picture of him I had seen was nothing like him in his nasal appendage, which gives him his name.\"  \"What is the reason of that?\"  \"The portrait was taken from a young one, before his nose had attained its full growth. But I don't believe in shooting monkeys for the fun of it. Our party are not inclined to eat them.\"  \"I'd as soon eat a cat as a monkey,\" added Felix.  \"Then, don't shoot those long-nosed fellows, for we have all the specimens of them we need,\" said Louis.  \"What are you going to do with them, my darling? You can't keep them much longer, and you will have to throw them overboard, for they won't smell sweet by to-morrow.\"  \"Achang learned something about taxidermy from the naturalist he travelled with, and he has promised to skin and mount one of them for me.\"  \"But what's that you are making, Louis?\" asked Felix, who had been trying to take the measure of the implement the young Cr≈ìsus was fashioning.  Its use was not at all evident. A triangular piece had been sawed out of the end of a strip of board four inches wide, and the rest of it had been cut down and rounded off, and the thing looked more like a pitchfork than anything else.  \"Is it to pitch hay with?\" persisted Felix.  [Illustration: \"WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE, MR. BELGRAVE?\"  _Page 41._]  \"No, it is not; when you see me use it, you will know what it is for. You must wait till that time before you know,\" replied Louis, who appeared to have finished the implement just as the other brought his gun to his shoulder.  \"That's the handsomest schnake I iver saw since me modther, long life to her, left ould Ireland before I was bahrn.\"  \"Don't shoot him, Flix!\" protested Louis vigorously. \"Where is he?\"  \"Jist forninst the bow of the boat. Sure, Oi'm the schnake-killer of the party, and he's moi game.\"  \"I don't want him killed yet,\" replied Louis, as he moved forward from the waist with the forked stick in his hand. \"He is handsome, as you say, Flix.\"  Creeping very cautiously till he could see over the bow, he discovered the serpent, which was nearly six feet long, working slowly down a dead log towards the water. Springing to his feet on the bow, he struck down with his weapon, directing the fork at the neck of the reptile. The outside of the log was nothing but punk, or the operation would have been a failure. As it was, the two points of the implement sunk into the wood, and the snake was pinned in the opening at the end of the stick.  \"What have you got there, Mr. Belgrave?\" asked Achang, hurrying to the side of the operator.  \"A snake; do you know him?\" demanded Louis, as the reptile struggled to escape.  \"I saw one like it years ago;\" and he gave a long Dyak name to it which the others did not understand. \"Wait a minute or two, and I will bring him on board for you.\"  \"I don't know that we want him on board,\" added Louis.  \"He is not poison, and he won't hurt you,\" said the Bornean, as he made a slip-noose at the end of a piece of cord.  Hanging over the bow, he passed the noose over the head of the snake, and hauled it taut, and then made the end he held fast to the boat. Louis lifted his implement from the neck of the snake, and he squirmed and wriggled as though he \"meant business.\" Achang leaped to the shore, and seizing the serpent by the tail, tossed him into the boat. He struck on one of the cushions, and the cord prevented him from going any farther.  Scott and Morris had just reached the fore cabin at this moment, and they started back as though they had been bitten by the snake. His head, tail, and belly were bright red, with white stripes upon a dark ground along his back and sides. No one but Achang had ever seen such a serpent, even in a museum. His snakeship was disposed to make himself comfortable on the cushion, and the Bornean loosed the cord around his neck.  \"I saw a small snake, not more than two feet long, swimming near the shore of Lake Cobbosseecontee, in Maine, that had nearly all the colors of the rainbow in his skin,\" said Morris. \"I tried to knock him over with my fishing-rod, and catch him; but I failed. I told the people where we boarded about him, but no one had ever seen a snake like him.\"  \"There are plenty of such snakes in South America, some that are not poisonous, which the native women tame and wear as necklaces,\" added Louis.  \"Well, what are you going to do with him?\" asked Captain Scott. \"I think you had better kill him, and throw him into the river, pretty as he is. He isn't a very desirable fellow to have as a companion on board.\"  \"What is the use of killing him? He would only be food for the crocodiles,\" protested Louis.  \"Do what you like with him, Louis,\" added the captain.  \"I certainly will not have him killed. If Achang never saw but one of the kind, there cannot be a great many of them in this part of the island. Put him ashore, Achang,\" said the humane young gentleman.  The Bornean complied with this request; and the handsome snake skurried off in the woods, none the worse for his adventure. But the others were not quite satisfied with the policy of the young millionaire. They wanted to shoot whatever they could see in the nature of game, including monkeys, and he was opposed to this destructive action. Of course they could kill whatever they pleased, but the moral influence of the real leader prevailed over them.  \"Steam enough!\" shouted Felipe from the engine.  \"Take the wheel, Clingman, back her out and go ahead,\" said the captain; and in a few moments they were steaming down the river.  \"I suppose you haven't any tenderness for crocodiles, have you, Louis?\" inquired Scott, with a smile.  \"You seem to believe that I am as chicken-hearted as a girl; but I believe in killing all harmful animals, including poisonous snakes; but I do not like to see these innocent monkeys shot down for the fun of it,\" replied Louis. \"You can kill them if you choose, but I will not.\"  \"The rest of us will not, if you are opposed to it,\" added Scott.  \"Crocodile on the port hand!\" exclaimed Clingman. \"He is swimming across the river, about three boats' lengths from us.\"  \"Stop her!\" said the captain.  \"I shot the last one, and I will not fire at this one,\" added Louis, who was not disposed to monopolize the fun.  \"All right; then I will be number two, Morris three, Flix four, and Achang five; and if you are all satisfied, we will fire in this order hereafter,\" continued Scott, as he took aim at the saurian.  He missed the eye of the reptile, and the bullet from the rifle glanced off and dropped into the water.  \"How many shots is a fellow to have before he loses his chance?\" asked the captain, as he aimed again.  \"I suggest three,\" said Louis. \"Those in favor of three say ay.\"  They all voted \"ay,\" and Scott fired twice more. \"Your turn, Morris;\" and he appeared to be very much chagrined at his ill luck. \"I could hardly see the eye of the varmint.\"  Morris fired his three shots with no better success. Felix took a different position from the others, placing himself on the stem. He fired, and the saurian still kept on his course. He did better the second time; and the reptile floundered for a moment, and then turned over dead. The boat was run up alongside, and Achang was required to bring out his parong latok, with which he decapitated the game at a single blow this time; but the creature was only nine feet long.  Pitts called the cabin party to breakfast at this time. The Blanchita went ahead again, and the repeating rifles were left on the cushions. At Louis's suggestion the captain gave the four men off duty permission to use the arms on crocodiles, but not on monkeys.  Ham and eggs, with hot biscuit and coffee, was the bill of fare; and the young men had sharpened their appetites in the sports of the morning. Before they were half done they heard the crack of a rifle. They listened for the second shot, but none followed it.  \"Who fired that shot, Pitts?\" asked the captain, as the steward brought in another plate of biscuit.  \"Clinch, sir,\" replied the man. \"He knocked the crocodile over at the first shot, sir.\"  \"Then he is a better shot than I am,\" said Scott, laughing.  \"Or any of the rest of us who had their turns,\" added Felix. \"Louis is the only fellow that brings 'em down the first time trying.\"  \"The rest of you would have done better if the sun had not reflected on the water, and shaken your aim,\" said Louis.  Before the meal was finished, another shot was heard, followed by two more. When the party went forward they found that the little steamer had gone around a bend so that the forest shaded the surface of the water. Wales had fired the last three times at a crocodile still in sight; but he declared that he could not hit the side of a barn twenty feet from him, and did not care to fire again. The men went to breakfast, and the cabin party picked up the rifles. It was Achang's turn; and he missed twice, but killed the game at the third shot.  \"I can see four more of them. We seem to have come to a nest of them, and the family are out for a morning airing,\" said Louis, as he picked up his rifle, while Felix was filling the other chambers with cartridges. \"They have all started to go across the river.\"  \"That must be the father of the family at the head of the procession,\" added the captain. \"It is your turn"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24252"],["title","Four Young Explorers; Or, Sight-Seeing in the Tropics (#7)"],["body",", Louis.\"  \"Go ahead a little, Pitts,\" said the next one in turn; for the cook had taken the wheel while Clingman went to his morning meal. \"I can't see his eye yet.\"  \"That will do; stop her. I can see his eye now, and there is no reflection on the water.\"  As soon as the boat lost her headway, Louis fired. The saurian leaped nearly out of the water, and came down wrong side up. There were three dead reptiles lying on the water. It was the captain's next shot, and when he placed the yacht in a position to suit him he fired. The crocodile lifted his head out of the water, and did not move again.  \"Bravo, Captain!\" cried Louis. \"You did not have a fair chance last time, and you have redeemed yourself.\"  \"I thought I could shoot better than before, and now I feel better. But there are two more, and your turn, Morris.\"  He killed the game with the third shot, and Felix finished the last in sight with the second. Achang had brought out his formidable weapon, and the six dead reptiles were decapitated. The last three killed were each nine feet long, while the one Louis had shot was fourteen. The heads were all put in the sampan, and they made a full load for it. The Blanchita arrived at Kuching early in the afternoon, and the chief of police measured the heads, and took the figures from Felix. He made one hundred and eight feet of crocodile, which the official approved as correct, and paid not quite forty dollars for the bounty.    CHAPTER VI  THE VOYAGE UP THE SADONG TO SIMUJAN   The money received for the heads of the crocodiles was in the hands of Felix, who was the clerk of the captain on board the ship, and it was proper to make him purser of the Blanchita. What to do with it was the next question. Louis's advice was asked for, and he promptly suggested that it should be divided into ten parts, and a share given to all but himself; and this was done. He refused to accept a penny, but all the others received about four dollars apiece.  The money was all in silver, as it is all over India and the Archipelago for general use. The engineer and the seamen shared with the four hunters; for the former had done all the work and some of the shooting. The steamer was made fast at the shore, and all hands except Pitts landed for a walk through the town. Their first visit was to a fruit-store kept by a Chinaman; and most of the shops in the place were in the hands of the Celestials.  Bananas and oranges were the principal, though there were also nearly all the tropical fruits in season. Many of the party purchased useful articles in other places. They had learned in Singapore and Batavia how to deal with Chinese traders, and they seldom gave even more than one-third or one-half of what was demanded. After diligent search Achang found a certain Dyak tool he wanted,--a sort of axe, which Lane, the carpenter's assistant, ridiculed without mercy.  The young men visited the English Mission, where they were kindly received, and went to the school. The American missionaries are also active in Borneo, and one of them has made a vocabulary of the Dyak language.  It was decided to start down the river the next morning on the way to the Sadong and Simujan Rivers, the latter being a branch of the former. In the early morning, as the hands were casting off the fasts, two Malays came alongside in a sampan, and asked to be towed to the Sadong. Achang had some talk with them, and made the request of the captain for them. He learned that they were engaged in the business of catching crocodiles for the reward.  \"They don't shoot crocodiles, and they have no rifles,\" added Achang.  \"How do they get them then?\" asked Louis.  \"They fish for them.\"  \"What, with a hook and line?\" demanded Captain Scott.  \"With a line, but have no fish-hook,\" replied the Bornean. \"You must see them catch one.\"  \"All right,\" replied the captain; \"we will tow them down the river.\"  After the yacht had been moving about an hour, they came to a colony of saurians apparently, for several of them were in sight at once. Achang directed the reptile-hunters to catch one of them, and they paddled their sampan towards a large one. The Blanchita kept near enough to enable all hands to witness the operation, which the Bornean described to them as the Malays made their preparations, for they had all their fishing-gear in their boat.  The line they used was a rattan about forty feet long. At the \"business end,\" as Scott called it, they attached a float to keep it on the top of the water. The steamer just crawled along on the river in order not to disturb the game, though the reptiles were accustomed to the sight of vessels.  \"Now you see that stick the hunter has in his hand,\" said Achang, though each of them had one. \"'Most a foot long, like a new moon.\"  \"Crescent-shaped,\" added Louis.  \"Called an _alir_ in Malay. Made of green wood, very tough, pointed at the ends; they fasten the rattan line to the middle of the stick.\"  Some tough green bark, braided together, was then wound around the stick so that the game could not bite it in two. A big fish for bait was then attached to the alir, and carefully fastened to it so that the reptile could not tear it off.  Thus prepared, the apparatus was thrown overboard, and the sampan paddled away from it to give the game an opportunity to approach it, the Malays each paying out his forty feet of line, one on each side of the boat. The spectators watched the result with great interest. As the sampan receded from the saurians, they approached the bait. Crocodiles and alligators do not nibble at their prey, but bolt it as a snake does a frog.  The bait nearest to the observers on the yacht was soon gobbled up by the hungry crocodile, who appeared not to have been to breakfast that morning; and the Malay at the other end of the line gave a sharp jerk to his gear, the effect of which was to draw the pointed crescent \"athwart ships,\" as the sailors would say, or across his stomach; and the harder it was pulled the more the pointed ends would penetrate the interior of the organ.  The first Malay had hardly hooked his game before the second had another ready to haul in. Both of the saurians struggled and lashed the dark water into a foam; but both of the men in the sampan kept the line as taut as they could with all their strength; and this is the rule in hauling in all gamey fish.  \"Tell them we will go ahead, Achang, and all they need to do is to make fast their rattans to the sampan,\" said Captain Scott, when he had taken in the situation.  In reply to the message the Bornean delivered to them, the Malays nodded their heads vigorously, and smiled their assent.  \"Go ahead, down the river, Clinch,\" added the captain to the helmsman.  \"I fancy there will be a lively kick-up on the part of the game,\" said Louis, as the boat came up to her course.  \"Not much,\" added Scott. \"If we put them through the water at the rate of eight knots an hour, the crocs will not feel much like doing any gambolling. We are not making more than four knots now.\"  \"They are as lively now as a parched pea in a hot skillet.\"  \"I will ring the speed-bell now, and see how that will affect them,\" replied the captain, suiting the action to the word.  The Blanchita darted ahead at her usual speed. Clingman began to overhaul the painter of the sampan, for it did not look strong enough for the present strain. He had scarcely got hold of it before it snapped in the middle, and relieved the strain on the crocodiles. The steamer backed at the order of the captain; and a strong line was thrown into the sampan, which one of the Malays seized and made fast.  When the strain upon them was thus removed, the saurians made violent struggles to escape. The yacht then went ahead again, and the speed-bell was rung immediately. The pressure on the game was renewed, and they ceased to struggle. The apparatus held fast, for the saurian fishers were experienced in their business, and had done their work well.  At eight o'clock the Blanchita reached the mouth of the river. The crocodiles were not dead, but their stomachs must have been in a terrible condition. To Louis it seemed to be cruel to prolong their sufferings; and he wished Achang to request the Malays to kill them, and Scott agreed with him. The Bornean said they could not kill them while they were towing behind, and that, if the lines were slacked, they might get away.  The captain took the matter in hand, and told Achang what he intended to do, which he communicated to the reptile-hunters. On the starboard hand Scott fixed his gaze on a small tongue of land extending out into the river. Taking the wheel himself, he run her close to the land some distance above the point, and worked the sampan and its tow close to the shore. The tow-line of the sampan was then lengthened out to a hundred feet or more, and the yacht went ahead again, rounding the point, so that the peninsula lay between the steamer and her tow.  Then she went ahead again, and the result was that she pulled the sampan upon the point; and as she was flat-bottomed, there was no difficulty in doing so. The Blanchita continued on her course, and the two crocodiles were landed after her. One of the Malays then produced a parong latok; and even more skilfully than Achang had done the job, he cut off the heads of both reptiles. They were out of misery then, and Louis was satisfied.  The yacht was then run up to the point, and Lane was sent on shore to measure the reptiles, while the fishermen proceeded to recover the apparatus from the stomachs of the defunct reptiles. The larger crocodile was twelve feet and four inches long, and the other ten feet and seven inches. The voyage was resumed on the sea to the mouth of the Sadong; and in three hours more she entered the stream, which was a large one, averaging half a mile wide for twenty miles.  \"Bujang!\" called Achang, as instructed by the captain. \"Do you want to go any farther?\"  The head man replied in his own language"]]]
