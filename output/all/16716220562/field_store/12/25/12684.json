Their faces changed. With tears one or two implored the Captain to let him ride in the ambulance. He yielded to their entreaties. Southern ladies almost always seemed handsome to us, but these in my memory have the fairest faces. I thought of Lady Clare in _Marmion_, and the words still recur:      O Woman! in our hours of ease,     Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,     And variable as the shade     By the light quivering aspen made;     When pain and anguish wring the brow,     A ministering angel thou!  Two miles before we reached our temporary destination, Meacham's Station, my own strength utterly failed. I had borne up so long, partly to set an example of cheerful endurance, and partly from something like Mark Tapley's pride at coming out strong and jolly under the most depressing circumstances. I lay beside the road, remarking to Captain Haslett, who immediately came riding to the spot, \"Captain, here's a fine chance to try your marksmanship; I can't march any further; shan't try to.\"--\"Colonel,\" he replied with something of pity in his tone and manner, \"I'm sorry to see you so used up. I'm sorry to be obliged to march you prisoners so hard. I have to keep out of the way of your damned cavalry. You may get into the ambulance.\" So into the ambulance I climbed with some difficulty, and immediately commenced my freemasonry on the driver. He responded to the signs. He proved to be an acquaintance of the Redwoods, a family in Mobile, one of whom had been a classmate of mine at Yale. He gave me some nice milk and some fine wheat bread. \"As a Mason,\" said he, \"I'll feed you; share the last crumb with you; but as a Confederate soldier I'll fight you till the last drop of blood and the last ditch.\"--\"I hardly know which to admire most, your spunk or your milk,\" I replied. Thereupon he gave me another drink, and insisted on my imbibing a little of what he called \"apple-jack.\" I was a \"teetotaler\"; but thinking the occasion warranted, I \"smiled\" upon it, \"strictly as a medicine!\" \"Apple-jack\" seemed to me the same thing as \"Jersey lightning.\" He became quite friendly, but was horribly profane. \"Look here,\" said he, \"you seem to be a sort of Christian; cuss me if you don't! What in h--l are you Yanks all comin' down here for?\"--\"You have a gift at swearing,\" I said; \"did you, among your other oaths, ever swear to support the Constitution of the United States?\"--\"Well, yes.\"--\"That's what's the matter with us,\" I said, \"we're keeping our oaths and you are breaking yours.\"--\"To h--l with the Constitution of the United States! Our first duty is to our own State. We've a right to be an independent nation, and we will. I'm a guerrilla. If our armies are defeated, I'll fight you on my own hook. I'll fire on you from behind every tree and every rock. I'll assassinate every invader. I want you to remember that I'm a guerrilla.\"--\"I like your _spirits_,\" I said. \"They are worthy of a better cause.\"--\"Take another swallow of 'em,\" he replied, handing me the canteen. I toasted him: \"Here's hoping you gorillas will outlive the Southern Confederacy!\"--\"A d--d equivocal sentiment,\" observed my fire-eating, fire-drinking Masonic brother; \"but here we are at Meacham's Station. Good-bye, Yank!\"  After our nineteen miles' march it was a most welcome relief to be placed on platform cars, though packed so closely that we could hardly stir. We objected that the cars had no tops. \"All the better opportunity to study astronomy,\" they replied.--\"The cars have no sides to keep off the wind.\"--\"The scenery is magnificent,\" they rejoined, \"and they'll answer for 'observation cars'; you have an unobstructed view.\"--\"But the nights are growing cold.\"--\"You'll keep warm by contact with each other.\" Mad at this mockery, hungry, half-frozen, squeezed like fish in a basket, we took little note of scenery or stars; but it was a comfort to believe that our discomfort was caused by the rapid advance of Sheridan's cavalry.  More dead than alive, though hardly dead enough to bury, having been jolted along all the afternoon and all night, we reached Richmond about sunrise, Tuesday, September 27th. Numbering now nearly four hundred we were escorted through the streets to the notorious Libby prison and halted in front. The Union officers inside thronged the windows to see us come. On every face was a sad, despondent, pitying look, the most discouraging sight I ever saw. No smiles there nor among us. Conspicuous among them was the sorrowful countenance of Lieut.-Col. Charles H. Hooper of the 24th Massachusetts Infantry, with his long handsome auburn beard. Some one inside whispered loud enough for several of our \"Four Hundred\" to hear, \"Hide your greenbacks!\" We passed the word down the column, \"Hide your greenbacks!\"  A few minutes revealed its significance. We were taken in a body in upon the lower floor. There Major Nat. Turner, prison inspector, cousin of the celebrated Dick Turner of unlovely reputation, made us a speech.      You will empty your pockets of all valuables. Such as are not     contraband of war, you will be allowed to retain. You will deliver     up all your Federal money. An equivalent amount in Confederate money     will be given you in instalments from time to time, or the whole     will be returned to you when you are exchanged. You will turn     pockets inside out. If you attempt to conceal anything, it will be     confiscated.  We were made to step forward singly, and were searched. Our coats and vests were taken off, also our boots and shoes; and a Confederate officer felt very carefully of all our clothing to make sure that nothing was hidden. I \"remembered to forget\" that I had two ten-dollar greenbacks compressed into a little wad in one corner of my watch fob; and that corner escaped inspection. Dick Turpin never was the richer for that money. They examined suspiciously a pocket edition of the New Testament in the original Greek; but I assured them it was not some diabolical Yankee cipher, and they allowed me to keep it. I made the most of my freemasonry, and they permitted me to retain my overcoat. One of our prisoners, it was whispered, had secretly stuffed $1300 in greenbacks into his canteen, but all canteens were taken from us as contraband of war, and nobody but \"Uncle Sam\" profited by the concealment.  Having \"gone through\" us, they incarcerated the officers in one room, the enlisted men in another.   FOOTNOTES:  [4] Dr. Fontleroy was a brother of Mrs. Major Whittlesey, one of my fellow professors, instructor in military tactics, at Cornell University. Whittlesey was a graduate of West Point, and, while there, had had cadet U. S. Grant under his command!     CHAPTER IV    At Libby--Thence to Clover, Danville, Greensboro, and     Salisbury--Effort to Pledge us not to Attempt Escape.   The two rooms at Libby adjoined each other on the second floor, but a solid brick wall was between them. When we entered, about a hundred and fifty officers were already there. The first thing that attracted my attention was an officer putting a loaf of bread through a small hole in the partition where one or two bricks were removable. He was feeding a hungry prisoner. A cap or hat nicely concealed the perforation.  Libby has a hard name, but it was the most comfortable of the six Confederate prisons of which I saw the interior. With all his alleged brutal severity, of which I saw no manifestation, and his ravenous appetite for greenbacks, for which we could not blame him, Dick Turner seemed an excellent disciplinarian. Everything went like clockwork. We knew what to expect or rather what not to expect, and _when_! My diary for Wednesday, September 28, 1864, the day after our arrival, reads as follows:      The issue to us daily is                 One gill of boiled beans,                 One quarter gill of bean broth,                 One half loaf of soft bread,                 (Four ounces meat) and                 A little salt.  There was one inestimable boon, a copious supply of pure water.  There were at this time no panes of glass, in fact no sashes, in the windows, and the wind swept freely through. The nights were becoming cold. Confederate sentries were on the lower floor and outside. They kept up a custom rather unusual, I think, during the war, of calling out in sing-song tones every hour the number of the post and the time, with occasional variations; _e. g._: \"Post number fourteen, two o'clock, and all's well.\" Then the next sentinel would sing out, \"Post number fifteen, two o'clock, and all's well.\" Then the melodious voice of the next, farther away and sadly unorthodox, \"Post number sixteen, two o'clock, and cold as h--l!\"  Except one or two rickety tables and two or three old chairs, there was no furniture in the prison. Some of the officers had contrived to save a little money when searched, and with money it was possible to procure small articles slyly smuggled in contrary to orders; but most of us were disposed to sing with old Isaac Watts,      Dear Lord, and shall we ever live     At this poor dying rate?  From the rear windows we were occasionally entertained with the sight of exploding shells, which the indefatigable Grant was daily projecting towards Richmond. Particularly was this the case on the thirtieth of the month, when the boys in blue captured Fort Harrison, and the next day when the Confederates made several gallant but unsuccessful attempts to retake it. At such times we could see some of the steeples or high roofs in Richmond thronged with non-combatants gazing anxiously towards Petersburg. The belief that our prison was undermined, a vast quantity of gunpowder stored in the cellar, and that Dick Turner had threatened and was desperate enough to blow us all into eternity in case of a sudden dash of our cavalry into Richmond, somewhat marred the satisfaction with which we contemplated the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24385"],["title","Lights and Shadows in Confederate Prisons (#6)"],["body","progress of the siege. We could sympathize with the Philadelphia Friend, who said to his wife on the introduction of gun-cotton, \"What comfort can thee take, even when sitting in thy easy chair, when thee knows not but the very cushion underneath thee is an enormous bomb-shell, ready upon the slightest concussion to blow thee to everlasting glory?\"  At three o'clock, Sunday morning, October 2d, we were roused by the entry of armed men with lanterns. They furnished each of us with a dirty haversack containing what they called two days' rations of corn bread and meat. Then they moved us single-file down stairs. As we passed, they took from each his blanket, even those the officers had just bought and paid for. If we expostulated, we were told we were going to a place where we should not need blankets! For my freemasonry or some other unexpressed reason, they allowed me to pass, wearing my overcoat. Then they took us by bridge across the James River, packed us in box-cars on the railway, forty to sixty in each car, and started the train southwest towards Danville.  The road-bed was bad and the fences on either side were gone. We made but four or five miles an hour. One of our officers declared that they kept a boy running ahead of the engine with hammer and nails to repair the track! also that they put the cow-catcher on behind the last car to prevent cattle from running over the train! At nine o'clock in the evening we reached a place called Clover. We passed the night in Clover! on the bank beside the railroad, where we studied astronomy! and meditated!  Next morning they repacked us, and we were transported seventy miles farther to Danville. My memorandum book mentions a conversation I had on the way with a very young and handsome rebel, one of the guard. He was evidently ingenuous and sincere, pious and lovable. After a few pleasant remarks he suddenly asked:  \"What are you Northerners fighting for?\"  \"In defense of the Constitution and the Union. What are _you_ fighting for?\"  \"Every right that is sacred and dear to man.\"  \"What right that is sacred and dear to man had the United States ever violated before you fired on Fort Sumter?\"  Of course he fell back on the Declaration of American Independence, that \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed\"; also on the doctrine so emphatically expressed by Abraham Lincoln in his speech in Congress in 1846; viz.:      Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the     right to raise up and shake off the existing government, and form a     new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most     sacred right, a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the     world. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people     of an existing government may choose to exercise it. Any portion of     such people, that can, may revolutionize and make their own of as     much territory as they inhabit.  We arrived at Danville at noon. A heavy rain began to fall. Having been two days without opportunity to wash, we were drenched for an hour or two by the sweet shower that seemed to pour from the open windows of heaven. When our thoughtful guards concluded that we were sufficiently cleansed and bleached, they sheltered us by putting us into coal cars, where the black dust was an inch deep. That dust was fine! but the thought seemed to strike them that our nicely laundered garments might get soiled. So in half an hour they took us out and placed us in corn cars. It rather went against the grain, but finally I sat down with the other kernels on the floor. The weather being inclement, they felt it their duty to keep us in doors, lest we should catch cold!  In these elegant and commodious vehicles we were transported next day till we reached Greensboro, North Carolina, about fifty miles southwest from Danville. Disgorged like poor old Jonah after three days' living burial, we were placed in the beautiful open square, and never before did air, earth, trees, and skies seem lovelier. Here they gave each of us three horny crackers, \"rebel hardtack,\" out of which some of us carved finger rings that might have passed for bone.  In those days I was too much addicted to making public speeches, a habit which I had contracted in Yale College. On the edge of the public green, backed by a hundred prisoners, I was haranguing a crowd of curious spectators, telling them how abominably we were treated, exhibiting to them our single ration of flinty biscuit, and consigning them all to everlasting perdition, when a well-dressed young man elbowed his way to me at the fence. He had a large black shiny haversack swung under his left arm. Patting it with his right hand, he asked:  \"Will you have a snack?\"  \"A what?\" I answered.  \"A snack, a snack,\" he said.  \"I don't know what a 'snack' is, unless it's a _snake_. Yes, I think I could eat a copperhead--_cooked_. Snake for one, if you please; well done.\"  He thrust his hand into his haversack; took out and gave me the most delicious sandwich I ever tasted. Seeing how I enjoyed it, he emptied the satchel, giving all his food to my hungry fellow prisoners. He told me he was just starting on a long journey, and had laid in a good stock of provisions. I took pains to write in my journal his name and residence--\"George W. Swepson, Alamance, North Carolina. Lives near the Court House.\" To which I added \"_Vir et Amicus_.\"--\"The blessing of him that was ready to perish\" was upon George W. Swepson.  That night we slept again on the ground and without covering under the open sky; and again several prisoners, Captain Howe and myself among them, attempted in vain to slip past the sentinels.  Next morning we reëntered the freight cars. A twelve hours' ride brought us at nine o'clock, Wednesday evening, October 5th, to our destination, Salisbury, North Carolina. As the \"Four Hundred\" passed into the dark enclosure, we were greeted with the cry, \"Fresh fish! Fresh fish!\" which in those days announced the arrival of a new lot of prisoners. We field officers were quartered that night in a brick building near the entrance, where we passed an hour of horrors. We were attacked by what appeared to be an organized gang of desperadoes, made up of thieves, robbers, Yankee deserters, rebel deserters, and villains generally, maddened by hunger, or bent on plunder, who rejoiced in the euphonious appellation of _Muggers_! We had been warned against them by kindly disposed guards, and were not wholly unprepared. They attacked us with clubs, fists, and knives, but were repeatedly driven off, pitched headlong downstairs. \"_Muggers!_\"  Salisbury prison, then commonly called \"Salisbury penitentiary,\" was in the general form of a right-angled triangle with base of thirty or forty rods, perpendicular eighty or ninety. In a row parallel to the base and four or five rods from it were four empty log houses with a space of about four rods between each two. These, a story and a half high, had formerly been negro quarters. On each side of the great triangle was a stout tight board fence twelve or fifteen feet high. Some two or three feet from the top of this, but out of our sight because on the other side, there was evidently a board walk, on which sentinels, four or five rods apart, perpetually paced their beats, each being able to see the whole inside of the enclosure. At each angle of the base was a shotted field-piece pointing through the narrow opening. We could see that behind each cannon there was a number of muskets stacked and vigilant soldiers watching every movement inside. Close to the fence outside there were three camps of Confederates, variously estimated to contain from seven hundred to two thousand in all.  The number of Union officers in prison after our arrival was about three hundred and twenty; the number of non-commissioned officers and privates was suddenly increased from about two thousand to some eight thousand. Among these were non-combatants, refugees, lighthouse keepers, and other government employees. Albert D. Richardson, then well-known as a correspondent of the New York _Tribune_, whose romantic marriage to Abby Sage by Henry Ward Beecher and whose tragic death created a sensation in the newspaper world, had been held as a prisoner there for several months. He told us he had found Salisbury a comfortable place. It immediately ceased to be such.  There stood the empty log houses. We besought the rebel commandant, Major Gee, to allow us officers to occupy those buildings. He said he would permit it on condition that we should sign a stringent parole, binding us on our honor not to attempt to escape! We objected to it as a preposterous requirement that, remaining under strict guard and wholly cut off from communication with the outside world, we should sign such a pledge as the only condition on which we could receive decent shelter. I asked Major Gee if the rigor of our confinement would be in any way relaxed. He answered bluntly, \"No.\"--\"Well, where's the reciprocity?\" I demanded; \"what are you giving up?\"--\"Well,\" he replied, \"if you don't choose to sign the parole, you can't have the buildings. Other Federal officers have not objected to signing it.\" He showed us the signature of Gen. Michael Corcoran, who had been colonel of the 69th New York, was captured at the first battle of Bull Run, was promoted to be brigadier, and who raised the so-called \"Corcoran Legion.\" Our senior officer, Brig.-Gen. Joseph Hayes of the Fifth Corps, now called a meeting of the field officers, and submitted the question, \"Shall we sign the parole, and so obtain shelter? Or shall we hold ourselves free to escape if we can, and so share the privations of our enlisted men, who have no bed but the ground and no covering but the sky?\" I spoke strongly against making any promise. We voted almost unanimously against it.  General Hayes and others then urged upon the commandant the absurdity and meanness of requiring "]]]
