When he was killed--well, we pulled out before Var was any stronger.\"  \"And sent Queeth's crowd in to do your blood-letting for you?\" Duke sneered.  \"That was their own idea,\" Flannery denied. He lighted a cigarette and sat staring at the end of it, blowing out a slow stream of smoke. \"All right, we made a mess of Cathay. We'll know better next time. Care to walk back with me?\"  \"Why? So one of your trained psychopropagandists can indoctrinate me? Or to get drunk and cry over your confession?\"  \"To keep me from sinking to your level and pushing your nose down your throat!\" Flannery told him, but there was no real anger in his voice. He stood up, shrugging. \"Nobody's forcing you, O'Neill. Say the word and I'll drive you home. But if you want that explanation, my working office seems like a good place to talk.\"  For a moment, Duke wavered. But he'd reached the end of his own research, and he'd come here to find the answers. Leaving now would only make him more of a fool. \"O.K.,\" he decided. \"I'll stay for the big unveiling.\"  Flannery grimaced. \"There's no great secret, though we don't broadcast the facts for people and races not ready for them. We figure those who finish growing up here will soak up most of it automatically. Did you get around to the film file on interstellar wars at the library?\"  Duke nodded, wondering how much they knew about his activities. He'd spent a lot of time going over the film for clues. It was so old that the color had faded in places. The rest would have been easier to take without color. Most wasn't good photography, but all was vivid. It was the record of all the wars since Earth's invention of the high-drive--nearly two hundred of them. Gimsul, Hathor, Ptek, Sugfarth, Clovis, and even Meloa--the part he hadn't seen, beyond Kordule where the real damage lay; Ronda had been wrong, and cannibalism had been discovered, along with much that was worse. Two hundred wars in which victor and vanquished alike had been ruined--in which the supreme effort needed to win had left most of the victors worse than the defeated systems.  \"War!\" The word was bitter on Flannery's lips. \"Someone starts building war power--power to insure peace, as they always say. Then other systems must have power to protect themselves. Strength begets force--and fear and hatred. Sooner or later, the strain is too great, and you have a war so horrible that its very horror makes surrender impossible. You saw it on Meloa. I've seen it fifty times!\"                      *      *      *      *      *  They reached the Foreign Office building and began crossing its lobby. Flannery glanced up at the big seal on the wall with its motto in twisted Latin--_Per Astra ad Aspera_--and his eyes turned back to Duke's, but he made no comment. He led the way to a private elevator that dropped them a dozen levels below the street, to a small room, littered with things from every conceivable planet. One wall was covered with what seemed to be the control panel of a spaceship, apparently now used for a desk. The director dropped into a chair and motioned Duke to another.  He looked tired, and his voice seemed older as he bent to pull a small projector and screen from a drawer and set them up. \"The latest chapter of the film,\" he said bitterly, throwing the switch.  It was a picture of the breakup of the Outer Federation, and in some ways worse than the other wars. Chumkt rebelled against Kel's leadership and joined the aliens, while a civil war sprang up on her surface. Two alien planets went over to Kel. The original war was forgotten in a struggle for new combinations, and a thousand smaller wars replaced it. The Federation was dead and the two dozen races were dying.  \"When everything else fails, the fools try federation,\" Flannery said as the film ended. \"We tried it on Earth. Another race discovered the interstellar drive before we did and used it to build an empire. We've found the dead and sterile remains of their civilization. It's always the same. When one group unites its power, those nearby must ally for protection. Then there's a scramble for more power, while jealousies and fears breed new hatreds, internally and externally. And finally, there's ruin--because at the technological level of interstellar travel, victory in war is absolutely, totally impossible!\"  He sat back, and Duke waited for him to resume, until it was obvious he had finished. At last, the younger man gave up waiting. \"All right,\" he said. \"Earth won't fight! Am I supposed to turn handsprings? I figured that much out myself. And I learned a long time ago about the blessed meek who were to inherit the Earth--but I can't remember anything being said about the stars!\"  \"You think peace won't work?\" Flannery asked mildly.  \"I know it won't!\" Duke fumbled for a cigarette, trying to organize his thoughts. \"You've been lucky so far. You've counted on the fact that war powers have to attack other powers nearby before they can safely strike against Earth, and you've buffered yourself with a jury-rigged economic trading system. But what happens when some really bright overlord decides to by-pass his local enemies? He'll drop fifty planet bombs out of your peaceful skies and collect your vassal worlds before they can rearm. You won't know about that, though. You'll be wiped out!\"  \"I wouldn't call our friends vassals, or say the system was jury-rigged,\" Flannery objected. \"Ever hear of paradynamics? The papers call it the ability to manipulate relationships, when we let them write a speculative article. It's what lets us rebuild worlds in less than half a century--and form the first completely peaceful politico-economic culture we've ever known. Besides, I never said we had no weapons for our defense.\"  Duke considered it, trying to keep a firm footing on the shifting quicksand of the other's arguments. He knew a little of paradynamics, of course, but only as something supposed to remake the world and all science in some abstract future. It had been originated as a complex mathematical analysis of nuclear relationships, and had been seized on for some reason by the sociologists. It had no bearing he could see on the main argument.  \"It won't wash, Flannery. Without a fleet, it won't matter if you have the plans of every weapon ever invented. The first time a smart power takes the chance, you'll run out of time.\"  \"We didn't!\" Flannery swung to the control board that served as his desk, and his fingers seemed to play idly with the dials. From somewhere below them, there was a heavy vibration, as if great engines had sprung into life. He pressed another switch.                      *      *      *      *      *  [Illustration: FLANNERY]  Abruptly, the room was gone. There was a night sky above them, almost starless, and with a great, glaring moon shining down, to show a rough, mossy terrain that seemed covered endlessly with row after row of rusting, crumbling spaceships. Atomic cannon spilled from their hatches, and broken ramps led down to the ground. Down one clearer lane among the countless ships that surrounded him, Duke saw what might be a distant fire with a few bent figures around it, giving the impression of age.  Beside him, Flannery sat in his chair, holding a small control. There was nothing else of the office visible.  The director shook his head. \"It's no illusion, O'Neill. You're here--fifty odd thousand light-years from Earth, where we transferred the attacking fleet. You never heard of that, of course. The dictator-ruler naturally didn't make a report when his fleet simply vanished without trace. Here!\"  The liquor burned in Duke's throat, but it steadied him. He bent down, to feel the mossy turf under his hand.  \"It's real,\" Flannery repeated. \"Paradynamics handles all relationships, captain. And the position of a body is simply a statement of its geometrical relationships. What happens if we change those relationships--with power enough, that is? There is no motion, in any classic sense. But newspapers appear two high-drive days away minutes after they're printed. We arrive here. And fleets sent against Earth just aren't there any more!\"  He pressed a button, and abruptly the walls of his office were around them again--the office that was suddenly the control room of a building that was more of a battleship than any Duke had ever seen.  He found himself clutching the chair, and forced himself to relax, soaking up the shock as he had soaked up so many others. His mind faced the facts, accepted them, and then sickly extended them.  \"All right, you've got weapons,\" he admitted, and disgust was heavy in his voice. \"You can defend yourself. But can the galaxy defend itself when somebody decides it's a fine offensive weapon? Or are all Earthmen supposed to be automatically pure, so this will never be turned to offensive use? Prove that to me and maybe I'll change my mind about this planet and take that job of yours!\"  Flannery leaned back, nodding soberly. \"I intend to,\" he answered. \"Duke, we tried making peaceful citizens of our youngsters here a century ago, but it wouldn't work. Kids have to have their little gang wars and their fisticuffs to grow up naturally. We can't force them. Their interests aren't those of adults. In fact, they think adults are pretty dull. No adventure. They can't see that juggling a twenty-million gamble on tooling up for a new competitive product is exciting; they can't understand working in a dull laboratory to dig something new out of nature's files can be exciting and dangerous. Above all, they can't see that the greatest adventure is the job of bringing kids up to be other adults. They regret the passing of dueling and affairs of honor. But an adult civilization knows better--because the passing of such things is the first step toward a race becoming adult, because it is adopting a new type of thinking, where such things have no value.

The shops in this passage are of a subdued exterior, and are overshadowed by a dingy old edifice dedicated to St. George the Martyr, which seems to have begun its existence as a rather handsome chapel, and to have improved itself, by a sort of evolution, into a singularly ugly church.  Into this alley, one Saturday afternoon late in October, came a short stout young man, with sandy hair, and a perpetual grin denoting anticipation rather than enjoyment. Opposite the church he stopped at a hairdresser's shop, which bore the name of Tweddle. The display in the window was chastely severe; the conventional half-lady revolving slowly in fatuous self-satisfaction, and the gentleman bearing a piebald beard with waxen resignation, were not to be found in this shop-front, which exhibited nothing but a small pile of toilet remedies and a few lengths of hair of graduated tints. It was doubtful, perhaps, whether such self-restraint on the part of its proprietor was the result of a distaste for empty show, or a conviction that the neighbourhood did not expect it.  Inside the shop there was nobody but a small boy, corking and labelling bottles; but before he could answer any question as to the whereabouts of his employer, that artist made his appearance. Leander Tweddle was about thirty, of middle height, with a luxuriant head of brown hair, and carefully-trimmed whiskers that curled round towards his upper lip, where they spent themselves in a faint moustache. His eyes were rather small, and his nose had a decided upward tendency; but, with his pink-and-white complexion and compact well-made figure, he was far from ill-looking, though he thought himself even farther.  \"Well, Jauncy,\" he said, after the first greetings, \"so you haven't forgot our appointment?\"  \"Why, no,\" explained his friend; \"but I never thought I should get away in time to keep it. We've been in court all the morning with motions and short causes, and the old Vice sat on till past three; and when we did get back to chambers, Splitter kep' me there discussing an opinion of his I couldn't agree with, and I was ever so long before I got him to alter it my way.\"  For he was clerk to a barrister in good practice, and it was Jauncy's pride to discover an occasional verbal slip in some of his employer's more hastily written opinions on cases, and suggest improvements.  \"Well, James,\" said the hairdresser, \"I don't know that I could have got away myself any earlier. I've been so absorbed in the laborrit'ry, what with three rejuvenators and an elixir all on the simmer together, I almost gave way under the strain of it; but they're set to cool now, and I'm ready to go as soon as you please.\"  \"Now,\" said Jauncy, briskly, as they left the shop together, \"if we're to get up to Rosherwich Gardens to-night, we mustn't dawdle.\"  \"I just want to look in here a minute,\" said Tweddle, stopping before the window of a working-jeweller, who sat there in a narrow partition facing the light, with a great horn lens protruding from one of his eyes like a monstrous growth. \"I left something there to be altered, and I may as well see if it's done.\"  Apparently it was done, for he came out almost immediately, thrusting a small cardboard box into his pocket as he rejoined his friend. \"Now we'd better take a cab up to Fenchurch Street,\" said Jauncy. \"Can't keep those girls standing about on the platform.\"  As they drove along, Tweddle observed, \"I didn't understand that our party was to include the fair sect, James?\"  \"Didn't you? I thought my letter said so plain enough. I'm an engaged man now, you know, Tweddle. It wouldn't do if I went out to enjoy myself and left my young lady at home!\"  \"No,\" agreed Leander Tweddle, with a moral twinge, \"no, James. I'd forgot you were engaged. What's the lady's name, by-the-by?\"  \"Parkinson; Bella Parkinson,\" was the answer.  Leander had turned a deeper colour. \"Did you say,\" he asked, looking out of the window on his side of the hansom, \"that there was another lady going down?\"  \"Only Bella's sister, Ada. She's a regular jolly girl, Ada is, you'll----Hullo!\"  For Tweddle had suddenly thrust his stick up the trap and stopped the cab. \"I'm very sorry, James,\" he said, preparing to get out, \"but--but you'll have to excuse me being of your company.\"  \"Do you mean that my Bella and her sister are not good enough company for you?\" demanded Jauncy. \"You were a shop-assistant yourself, Tweddle, only a short while ago!\"  \"I know that, James, I know; and it isn't that--far from it. I'm sure they are two as respectable girls, and quite the ladies in every respect, as I'd wish to meet. Only the fact is----\"  The driver was listening through the trap, and before Leander would say more he told him to drive on till further orders, after which he continued--  \"The fact is--we haven't met for so long that I dare say you're unaware of it--but _I'm_ engaged, James, too!\"  \"Wish you joy with all my heart, Tweddle; but what then?\"  \"Why,\" exclaimed Leander, \"my Matilda (that's _her_ name) is the dearest girl, James; but she's most uncommon partickler, and I don't think she'd like my going to a place of open-air entertainment where there's dancing--and I'll get out here, please!\"  \"Gammon!\" said Jauncy. \"That isn't it, Tweddle; don't try and humbug me. You were ready enough to go just now. You've a better reason than that!\"  \"James, I'll tell you the truth; I have. In earlier days, James, I used constantly to be meeting Miss Parkinson and her sister in serciety, and I dare say I made myself so pleasant and agreeable (you know what a way that is of mine), that Miss Ada (not _your_ lady, of course) may have thought I meant something special by it, and there's no saying but what it might have come in time to our keeping company, only I"]]]
