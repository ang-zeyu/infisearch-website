To be sure, once she brought the end of her tail _smack_ across Johnnie Green's cheek. But that was a mistake. Though it stung sharply, all Johnnie Green said was, \"So, boss! So, boss!\"  She was glad when Farmer Green came back at last, peeped into the pail that Johnnie was clutching between his knees, and said, \"Well, you haven't done badly. But you'd better let me finish for you.\"  So Johnnie slipped off the three-legged stool and watched while his father sat down and got the rest of the Muley Cow's milk in no time.  \"Farmer Green milked eight cows while that lazy boy was puttering with you,\" the little red cow said to the Muley Cow.  \"Well, well! I suppose Farmer Green had to learn to milk when he was a boy,\" the Muley Cow replied, as she flicked a big fly off her back. \"And this boy of his,\" she added, \"he's going to be a good milker--once he gets the knack of it.\"  Just then Johnnie Green came trotting down the long passageway in front of the cows. He stopped in front of the Muley Cow and offered her a piece of an early apple--one of the first ripe ones of the summer.  She accepted the gift with much pleasure, while her neighbors on either side, stirred restlessly as she munched the apple. They said nothing just then. But anybody could see that they wished Johnnie Green would let them have a taste too.  \"She earned it,\" the big white cow told the little red cow, later. \"She had to stand still at least three-quarters of an hour, while that boy was trying to milk her.\"  The little red cow gave a slight sniff. \"No doubt the apple was sour, anyhow,\" she muttered.  The Muley Cow couldn't help hearing what her two neighbors were saying. And although she was a well-mannered person and had a kindly disposition, she couldn't resist telling them that the apple was sweet and juicy.  \"If you had had a taste of it you would agree with me,\" said the Muley Cow.     IV  OWNING A BOY   By the end of a week Johnnie Green was able to milk quite well. When he sat down beside the Muley Cow he could play a merry tune as he made the tiny streams of milk tinkle against the bottom of the milk pail. And he managed to milk the Muley Cow while his father was milking only three others.  \"Don't you think,\" Johnnie asked his father, \"that I ought to own the Muley Cow by this time?\"  But Farmer Green thought that he mustn't make the prize too easy to win. He laughed and shook his head. \"When you can milk half as fast as I can, I'll agree that she's yours,\" he promised.  Before a month had slipped by Johnnie Green raced with his father one night and finished milking the Muley Cow _before_ his father could milk the little red cow and the big white one.  \"Hurrah!\" Johnnie shouted, as he jumped up from his three-legged stool. \"I've got a cow of my own!\" But he didn't shout too loud, for he had learned that one ought not to be noisy around the cattle.  Somehow his father seemed almost as pleased as he was.  As for the Muley Cow herself, she didn't know just how to feel. She couldn't help hearing what was said. And her neighbors were craning their necks, for they couldn't help staring at her to see how she took the news.  It was just a bit uncomfortable for the Muley Cow, at first. But when Johnnie Green patted her and picked a prickly burr off her back she felt that matters might have been worse. And when he gave her a tender young beet as a special treat she began to think that matters couldn't have been better. She saw right away that being owned by a boy wasn't a bad thing, after all. It was the _sound_ of it that she didn't like.  Naturally there was a good deal of gossip among the cows. And the next day, in the pasture, one meddlesome creature went up to the Muley Cow and asked her _what she was going to do about it_.  \"About what?\" the Muley Cow inquired.  \"About your being owned by Farmer Green's boy,\" the other explained. \"Are you going to run away?\"  Well, the Muley Cow laughed right in her face. It wasn't a thing she was used to doing. But the question seemed to her a very silly one.  \"Run away!\" she exclaimed. \"Why should I run away? I've lived on the farm all my life and I wouldn't leave it for anything.\"  \"But that boy! Surely, at your age, you can't enjoy belonging to anybody as young as he is!\" the prying neighbor went on.  \"Bless you!\" cried the Muley Cow. \"If he milks me, and takes me to the pasture and back, and gives me good things to eat, and brushes my coat for me, shouldn't you say that he belonged to me? It isn't every cow that has a boy like Johnnie Green to wait on her.\"  The meddlesome neighbor didn't quite know what answer to make. She was rather a stupid person, anyhow. Moreover, she was a great gossip. So she hurried off to tell all her friends that they were mistaken about Johnnie Green and the Muley Cow.  A good many of her friends admitted that there was something to be said on both sides of the question. And all of them agreed that the Muley Cow was certainly Johnnie Green's favorite.     V  THE FRIENDLY SCARECROW   Old Mr. Crow and all his cronies made fun of the scarecrow in the cornfield. They said that he was a great joke. \"He doesn't know anything,\" they used to chuckle. \"His head has nothing but straw inside it.\"  The Muley Cow had often heard the noisy crows laughing about the limp gentleman who hung on a long, upright stick beyond the pasture fence. She had paid little heed to him, herself, until one day she took a notion to jump the fence and taste the young shoots of corn. For they certainly did look tempting.  Being, generally, a well-mannered creature, the Muley Cow thought it only polite to speak to the scarecrow. So she lowed gently to attract his attention. And when he swung around, as he presently did, and faced her she bowed pleasantly and said, \"I hope you won't mind if I sample the corn.\"  No one could have been more courteous than the scarecrow. To be sure, he _said_ nothing. But he waved an arm (as the breeze caught it) in a wide sweep.  \"Surely,\" the Muley Cow thought, \"he means that I'm to take all I want.\"  After thanking him she helped herself freely to the young corn. Indeed, she was almost greedy about it. Only the fact that the scarecrow seemed to throw a look at her now and then kept her from eating more. Somehow she couldn't forget that he acted very gentlemanly, though his clothes were tattered and torn. And she felt that she must do nothing to offend him.  \"The corn is as good as any I've ever tasted,\" she assured him.  The scarecrow showed that he must have heard her, for he gave a sort of nod. And he tried his best to touch his hat. But the wind wasn't blowing quite hard enough to let him do that. \"Poor fellow!\" the Muley Cow thought. \"He hasn't the entire use of his arms.\"  Then the scarecrow went through some odd motions. First he kicked backward with one leg; then he kicked forward with the other; and after that he whirled three times around the stake that supported him.  \"Now, what can he mean by that?\" the Muley Cow wondered. And then all at once she gave a silly sort of giggle. \"I know!\" she exclaimed. \"He wants me to dance with him!\"  For a moment the Muley Cow forgot that she was the oldest cow on the farm. She tossed her head, flirted her heels in the air, and cut a few clumsy capers around the scarecrow, who did his best to dance a jig--only the wind died down completely just as he was in the middle of it. And he hung from his pole in such a woebegone fashion that the Muley Cow began to feel uneasy about him.  \"You're not ill, I hope?\" she ventured, as she stopped her prancing.  He paid not the slightest heed to her. So with her nose the Muley Cow touched him where a knee would have been, had he had any. And even then he hung motionless.  The Muley Cow was alarmed. But she didn't linger to find out what was the matter with the scarecrow. She heard shouting. And she heard old dog Spot barking. And knowing at once that Farmer Green had caught her in the cornfield she turned and fled as fast as she could go.  \"Something's wrong with that scarecrow,\" she muttered to herself as she lumbered along toward the barnyard. \"He's so kind and gentlemanly he would surely have warned me if he had been able to. He would have let me know that Farmer Green was coming.\"     VI  BUFFALO HUNTS   Johnnie Green found, after a while, that owning a cow wasn't all fun. There were times when he would have been willing to let his father, or the hired man, milk the Muley Cow. For instance, a boy from a neighboring farm might come along about milking-time with a fine plan for play. Or someone driving past the house on his way to the village might ask Johnnie to go along too.  Once or twice, on such occasions, Johnnie tried to wriggle out of milking. But he soon learned better. His father told him that a duty was a duty.  And Johnnie knew exactly what he meant.  As for the Muley Cow, she went about her business as if no great change had come into her life. And if now and then she took a notion to look for better grass in the back pasture on the edge of the woods, she would jump the fence just as she always had and stray off among the clumps of trees and bushes.  When Johnnie went to drive the cows home at \"cow-come-home time,\" as he used to call it when he was younger, he always looked first for the Muley Cow. And if he didn't see her he always knew what had happened.  \"She's in the back pasture again!\" Johnnie would exclaim--sometimes none too pleasantly. For the back pasture stretched way around a shoulder of the hill, and being half overgrown it offered a fine hiding place for the old cow. Sometimes it meant a good hour's search before Johnnie found her.  In days past Johnnie Green had been known to drive the herd home without noticing that the Muley Cow was missing. But now that she belonged to him such an oversight never happened. The Muley Cow soon noticed that Johnnie always came for her, no matter where she went."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24545"],["title","The Tale of the The Muley Cow (#2)"],["body","  \"It won't hurt him to hunt for me now and then,\" she told herself. \"A little work is good for a boy.\"  Somehow Johnnie Green did not feel just that way about work. He seemed to have an idea that work was a good thing for a boy to avoid. And if you couldn't escape it, then the wisest thing to do was to make play of it. By pretending hard enough, Johnnie had discovered that he could make a game of almost anything his father wanted him to do.  So it wasn't long before he was enjoying buffalo hunts in the back pasture. With old dog Spot along it was a lively game and most exciting.  The Muley Cow found it exciting too. The first time that Johnnie tried to lasso her with a length of his mother's clothesline she started for home on a lumbering gallop.  And Johnnie chased her until he remembered that it was bad for a cow to run. Besides, he was out of breath. So he whistled to old Spot, who had been barking just behind the Muley Cow's heels, and told him to come back and behave himself.  That night the Muley Cow wouldn't give down her milk for the longest time. And Johnnie Green knew right well that she was holding it back because he had teased her.     VII  A LITTLE SURPRISE   Little by little the Muley Cow learned not to be disturbed by Johnnie Green's clothesline lasso, when he swung it in wide circles about his head and then flung it at hers. She found that the rope did her no harm. Indeed, the more Johnnie practiced the more expert he became. Before a great while he could drop his noose over the Muley Cow's head almost every time he tried--when she stood still.  By that time Johnnie began to tire of the sport of buffalo hunting (with the Muley Cow for the buffalo). He wished he might try lassoing her from the back of the old horse Ebenezer. But he hardly thought his father would approve of the plan.  Well, Johnnie, the Muley Cow and Spot the dog were in the back pasture one day, where the Muley Cow had strayed. And as Johnnie paused to pick a few blackberries he thought what a humdrum place Pleasant Valley was, anyway, and how he would like to go off where there were real buffaloes, and Indians, and--  And just then old dog Spot began to growl. His hair bristled on his back. And Johnnie Green was sure that they had stumbled on game of some sort. He hoped it was at least a woodchuck.  \"Sic him, Spot!\" Johnnie cried.  But old Spot hung back, instead of dashing into the bushes toward which he was pointing. That wasn't at all like him. Johnnie Green couldn't understand it.  The Muley Cow, too, thought it very odd. \"I declare,\" she said to herself, \"I believe old Spot's afraid of something. I believe he's afraid of a woodchuck.\" And she gave a sort of chuckle, thinking it a great joke. Neither she nor her friends were any too fond of Spot. And she intended to tell the whole herd how he didn't dare chase a woodchuck.  Meanwhile Johnnie Green picked up a stone and threw it into the clump of bushes. And then he heard something that was between a growl and a grunt.  The Muley Cow heard it too. She knew that no woodchuck ever made a sound like that. And all at once she caught a whiff of the strangest, _wildest_ sort of scent.  It was enough for the Muley Cow. \"My goodness!\" she bellowed. \"I'm going home!\" And off she dashed down the hillside. She had forgotten all about the joke on old dog Spot.  Johnnie Green had not noticed that the Muley Cow had fled. He was running towards the hidden game, in the thicket, when that queer grunty growl made him stop short. The next moment, not ten feet in front of him a shaggy form rose up out of the tangle and glared straight at him.  It was a bear!     VIII  IT WAS A BEAR   When the bear rose out of the bushes and looked at him--and said \"Woof!\" too--Johnnie Green did not bellow as the Muley Cow had. But he turned and ran. Once he tripped on a root and fell headlong. But he was on his feet again in a jiffy and running faster than ever. And though he had only half as many legs as the Muley Cow, he reached the pasture fence not far behind her.  It was the first time Johnnie Green had known the Muley Cow to jump the fence _back into_ the pasture, after jumping out of it. Before, she had always made him let down the bars for her, quite as if she had never done such a giddy thing as to leap over a fence. Now, however, she was in too great a hurry to bother with bars. So she topped the fence like a deer, while Johnnie slipped through it like a pig a few seconds later, and old Spot wriggled under it like a weasel soon afterward.  Once in the pasture they all three went slipping and sliding down the steep hillside, tore through the prickly raspberry patch, splashed through the brook, and never stopped until they saw Johnnie Green's father raking hay in a field nearby. As they came to a halt at last they looked at one another somewhat foolishly.  \"You were scared,\" Johnnie Green accused Spot. \"You made a loud enough racket; but you took good care to keep out of the bear's reach.\"  The old dog barked his denial. He had been the last to run away. And he thought that proved he was the bravest of the three.  \"You were the scaredest,\" Johnnie told the Muley Cow.  And she didn't deny it. How could she know that the most frightened of all was young Cuffy Bear, and that even then he was scrambling up the steep side of Blue Mountain? He was still putting as much ground as he could between himself and the three odd folk he had met by accident in the back pasture.  Old Spot, too, never guessed how he had scared the bear. And Johnnie wouldn't have known it, either, except for what Farmer Green said when he heard about the adventure.  \"That bear is probably running yet,\" he said as he threw back his head and laughed. \"He'll never stop this side of the mountain. He must have come down to pick blackberries. But he lost his taste for them when he saw you.\"  \"Ho!\" Johnnie Green exclaimed all at once. \"I might have lassoed that bear--if I had thought in time.\"     IX  WEARING A POKE   The cows never paid much attention to the woodchucks, unless it was to scold them now and then for eating too much clover. But living as they did in the pasture, the woodchucks took a great interest in Farmer Green's herd. Many a bit of gossip about some cow passed from one woodchuck hole to another, without the cow herself ever dreaming that folk were talking about her.  Whenever Billy Woodchuck's mother heard any specially interesting news about a cow she was more than likely to put on her best apron and hurry over to make a call on Aunt Polly Woodchuck, the famous herb doctor, who lived under the hill.  Well, one morning while the dew was still on the grass Billy saw his mother dash into the house, whisk off her old apron and reach for her best one. He knew at once, without asking, exactly where she was going. Nor was he sorry, because Mrs. Woodchuck always stayed a long time at Aunt Polly's. And that gave Billy a chance to do a number of things without being told \"Don't!\"  Alas! \"You'd better come with me,\" his mother said.  \"Oh, I'd rather not,\" he protested. \"I--I'm not feeling very well this morning.\"  \"Then you must certainly come,\" she insisted, \"for I'm going to see Aunt Polly Woodchuck and she'll give you a dose of herbs to cure you.\"  Billy Woodchuck began to squirm. He saw that he had got himself into trouble.  \"I'll be all right if I keep still a while,\" he stammered. \"And then I'm going out to gather a nice lot of greens for you.\"  \"You'll do nothing of the sort!\" said his mother. \"You'll come with me. You'd be sure to get into mischief if I left you here.\"  So off they went. And Mrs. Woodchuck hurried so fast that she was quite out of breath when she reached Aunt Polly Woodchuck's house. She had to sit down and rest before she could tell Aunt Polly the news that was on the tip of her tongue.  While waiting for her guest to compose herself, Aunt Polly Woodchuck looked over her spectacles at Billy, who lingered near the door.  \"Come here, young man!\" she said. Though her tone was severe, Billy Woodchuck took heart. He thought he saw a twinkle in the old lady's eye. \"I can see,\" Aunt Polly told him, \"that you need an apple.\" And thereupon she handed him one. And Billy Woodchuck declared as soon as he began to eat it that he felt much better.  \"I hope you're quite well,\" Aunt Polly said to Billy's mother, who was at last beginning to get her breath.  \"Yes--very!\" said Mrs. Woodchuck. \"I've come over to tell you the news about the Muley Cow. I hope you haven't heard it already,\" she added, for she dearly loved to be the first to spread a bit of gossip.  \"I fear I do know it,\" Aunt Polly replied, as she pushed her poke bonnet back and began to fan herself with a plantain leaf. \"I suppose you've just heard about the Muley Cow's meeting Cuffy Bear in the back pasture.\"  Mrs. Woodchuck had begun to look disappointed. But now her honest face brightened. \"Oh, no! There's newer news than that,\" she explained. \"It hasn't anything to do with the Muley Cow's jumping the fence into the back pasture.\"  \"Do tell!\" Aunt Polly exclaimed.  \"It's something about her clothes--something new she's wearing.\" Mrs. Woodchuck wasn't going to give up her news too soon. She liked to get people well interested before she actually told them anything.  \"She hasn't a pair of horns, has she!\" Aunt Polly inquired eagerly.  \"Oh, no! Not that! But I knew you'd like to hear the news. I knew it would please you.\"  \"Well, _what_ is it?\" Aunt Polly demanded.  \"That's a pretty poke that you have on,\" Mrs. Woodchuck remarked.  Aunt Polly straightened her poke bonnet. \"Thank you!\" she said. \"But do let me hear the news.\"  \"Can't you guess it?\" Mrs. Woodchuck asked her. \"Can't you guess it, now that I've given you a hint?\"  But Aunt Polly couldn't. So at last Mrs. Woodchuck told her the news:  \"The Muley Cow is wearing a poke! I knew you'd approve of it, because you always wear one yourself.\"  Aunt Polly Woodchuck threw up her hands in astonishment.  \"I"]]]
