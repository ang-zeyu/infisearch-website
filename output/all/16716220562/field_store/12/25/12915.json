The death list that day is variously estimated at from 143 to 216 and the property loss by the firing of the town, the sacking of the bank, and the rest, at $1,500.000.  Maj. John N. Edwards, in his _Noted Guerrillas,_ says:  “Cole Younger saved at least a dozen lives this day.  Indeed, he killed none save in open and manly battle.  At one house he captured five citizens over whom he put a guard and at another three whom he defended and protected.  The notorious Gen. James H. Lane, to get whom Quantrell would gladly have left and sacrificed all the balance of the victims, made his escape through a corn-field, hotly pursued but too splendidly mounted to be captured.”  My second lieutenant, Lon Railey, and a detachment gave Jim Lane a hot chase that day but in vain.  When I joined Brother-in-law Jarrette’s company, he said:  “Cole, your mother and your sister told me to take care of you.”  That day it was reversed.  Coming out of Lawrence his horse was shot under him.  He took the saddle off and tried to put it on a mustang that one of the boys was leading.  Some of the boys say he had $8,000 in the saddle bags for the benefit of the widows and orphans of Missouri, but whether that is true or not I have no knowledge.  While he was trying to saddle the mustang, he was nearly surrounded by the enemy.  I dashed back and made him get up behind me.  The saddle was left for the Kansas men.  One of the treasures that we did bring out of Lawrence that day, however, was Jim Lane’s “black flag,” with the inscription “Presented to Gen. James H. Lane by the ladies of Leavenworth”.  That is the only black flag that I knew anything about in connection with the Lawrence raid.  Lawrence was followed by a feverish demand from the North for vengeance. Quantrell was to be hanged, drawn and quartered, his band annihilated; nothing was too terrible for his punishment.  Four days after the raid, Gen. Thomas Ewing at St. Louis issued his celebrated General Order No. 11.  This required that all persons living in Jackson, Cass and Bates counties, except one township, or within one mile of a military post, should remove within fifteen days.  Those establishing their loyalty were permitted to go within the lines of any military post, or to Kansas, but all others were to remove without the bounds of the military district.  All grain and hay in the proscribed district was to be turned into the military post before Sept. 9, and any grain or hay not so turned in was to be destroyed.  It was the depopulation of western Missouri.  Any citizen not within the limits of the military post after Sept. 9 was regarded as an outlaw.  Pursued by 6,000 soldiers, the Confederates in that vicinity must ultimately rejoin their army farther south, but they harassed their pursuers for weeks in little bands rarely exceeding ten.  The horrors of guerrilla warfare before the raid at Lawrence, were eclipsed after it. Scalping, for the first time, was resorted to.  Andy Blunt found Ab. Haller’s body, so mutilated, in the woods near Texas Prairie on the eastern edge of Jackson county.  “We had something to learn yet,” said Blunt to his companions, “and we have learned it. Scalp for scalp hereafter.”  Among the brave fighters who were participants in the fight at Lawrence were Tom Maupin, Dick Yager, Payne Jones, Frank Shepherd, Harrison Trow, Dick Burns, Andy McGuire and Ben Broomfield.      15. CHASING COTTON THIEVES   In the fall of 1863, in the absence of Capt. Jarrette, who had rejoined Shelby’s command, I became, at 19, captain of the company.  Joe Lea was first lieutenant and Lon Railey second lieutenant.  When Capt. Jarrette came north again, I again became lieutenant, but when Capts. Jarrette and Poole reported to Gen. Shelby on the Red river, they were sent into Louisiana, and I again became captain of the company, so reporting to Gen. Henry E. McCulloch in command of Northern Texas at Bonham.  All my orders on the commissary and quartermaster’s departments were signed by me as Capt. C.S.A. and duly honored.  Around Bonham I did scout service for Gen. McCulloch, and in November he sent me with a very flattering letter to report to Gen. E. Kirby Smith, at Shreveport, Louisiana, the headquarters of the Trans-Mississippi department.  Capts. Jarrette and Poole were at Shreveport and Gen. Smith gave us minute orders for a campaign against the cotton thieves and speculators who infested the Mississippi river bottom.  An expedition to get rid of these was planned by Gen. Smith with Capt. Poole commanding one company, myself the other, and Capt. Jarrette over us both.  Five miles from Tester’s ferry on Bayou Macon we met a cotton train convoyed by 50 cavalry.  We charged them on sight.  The convoy got away with ten survivors, but every driver was shot, and four cotton buyers who were close behind in an ambulance were hung in a cotton gin near at hand. They had $180,000 on them, which, with the cotton and wagons, was sent back to Bastrop in charge of Lieut. Greenwood.  A more exciting experience was mine at Bayou Monticello, a stream that was deeper than it looked.  Observing a cotton train on a plantation across the bayou, I called to my men to follow me and plunged in.  Seeing me floundering in the deep water, however, they went higher up to a bridge, and when I landed I found myself alone.  I was hard pressed for a time, till they came up and relieved me.  There were 52 soldiers killed here.  Other charges near Goodrich’s Landing and at Omega put an end to the cotton speculation in that locality.  The Confederate army in that section was not well armed, and our company, each man with a pair of dragoon pistols and a Sharpe’s rifle, was the envy of the Southern army.  Gen. Kirby Smith told me he had not seen during the war a band so well armed.  Consequently when, in February, 1864, Gen. Marmaduke sent to Gen. Shelby for an officer and 40 of the best mounted and best armed men he had, it was but natural that Shelby’s adjutant-general, John N. Edwards, should recommend a part of the Missouri boys, and told me to select my men and report to Gen. Shelby, who in turn ordered me to report for special service to Gen. Marmaduke at Warren, Ark.  Only twenty, and a beardless boy, Gen. Marmaduke looked me over rather dubiously, as I thought, but finally told me what he wanted—to find out whether or not it was true that Gen. Steele, at Little Rock, was preparing to move against Price at Camden, and to make the grand round of the picket posts from Warren to the Mississippi river, up the Arkansas to Pine Bluff and Little Rock, and returning by way of the western outpost at Hot Springs.  We were to intercept all messages between Price and Marmaduke, and govern our movements by their contents.  About half way between Pine Bluff and Little Rock we came up with a train of wagons, followed by an ambulance carrying several women and accompanied by mounted Federal soldiers.  The soldiers got away into Pine Bluff, but we captured the wagons and ambulance, but finding nothing of importance let them proceed.  We made a thorough examination of the interior of Little Rock, and satisfied ourselves that no movement on Price was imminent, and were on our way out before we became involved in a little shooting match with the patrol, from which no harm resulted to our side, however, except a shot in my leg.  Years afterward, in prison, I learned from Senator Cushman Kellogg Davis, of Minnesota, that he was one of the officers who galloped into Pine Bluff ahead of us that day.  He was at that time on the staff of the judge advocate general, and they were on their way into Pine Bluff to hold a court-martial.  The women were, as they had said, the wives of some of the officers.  Senator Davis was among the prominent Minnesotans who worked for our parole, although he did not live to see it accomplished.      16. A CLASH WITH APACHES   In May, 1864, Col. George S. Jackson and a force of about 300, myself among the number, were sent across the staked plains into Colorado to intercept some wagon trains, and to cut the transcontinental telegraph line from Leavenworth to San Francisco.  We cut the line and found the trains, but empty, and on our return were met at the Rio Grande by orders to detail a party to cross the continent on a secret mission for the Confederate states.  Two vessels of the Alabama type, built in British waters, were to be delivered at Victoria, B.C., and a secret service officer named Kennedy, who was entrusted with the papers, was given an escort of twenty men, including myself, Capt. Jarrette and other veteran scouts.  While on this expedition we had a brief tilt with Comanches, but in the country which Gen. Crook afterward fought over inch by inch, we had a real Indian fight with Apache Mojaves which lasted through two days and the night between practically without cessation.  We had a considerable advantage in weapons, but the reds were pestiferous in spite of that, and they kept us busy for fully 36 hours plugging them at every opportunity.  How many Indians we killed I do not know, as we had no time or curiosity to stop and count them.  They wounded some of our horses and we had to abandon one wagon, but we did not lose a man.  From El Paso we went down through Chihuahua and Sonora to Guaymas, where the party split up, Capt. Jarrette going up the mainland, while Kennedy and I, with three men, took a boat to San Francisco, disguised as Mexican miners.  We were not detected, and then traveled by stage to Puget Sound, sailing for Victoria, as nearly as I have since been able to locate it, about where Seattle now is.  On our arrival at Victoria, however, we found that Lee had surrendered at Appomattox and the war was at an end.  For a long time I was accused of the killing of several people at Centralia, in September, 1864, but I think my worst enemies now concede that it is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24585"],["title","The Story of Cole Younger, (#8)"],["body","for me to have been there at the time.  Another spectre that rose to haunt my last days in prison, and long stood between my parole and final pardon, was the story of one John McMath, a corporal in an Indiana cavalry company, in Pleasanton’s command, that I had maltreated him when he lay wounded on the battle field close by the Big Blue, near my old home in Jackson county. McMath says this occurred Oct. 23, 1863.  It is true that I was in Missouri on that date, but McMath’s regiment was not, nor Pleasanton’s command, and the war department records at Washington show that he was injured in a fight at the Big Blue Oct. 23, 1864—3 full year later—much as he says I hurt him. This was eleven months after I had left Missouri and while I was 1,500 miles away, yet this hideous charge was brought to the attention of Chief Justice Start, of Minnesota, in 1896 by a Minneapolis newspaper.  In his _Noted Guerrillas,_ Maj. John N. Edwards wrote: “Lee’s surrender at Appomattox found Cole Younger at Los Angeles, trying the best he could to earn a livelihood and live at peace with all the world.  The character of this man to many has been a curious study, but to those who knew him well there is nothing about it of mystery or many-sidedness.  An awful provocation drove him into the army.  He was never a bloodthirsty or a merciless man.  He was brave to recklessness, desperate to rashness, remarkable for terrible prowess in battle; but he was never known to kill a prisoner.  On the contrary, there are alive today (1877) fully 200 Federal soldiers who owe their lives to Cole Younger, a man whose father had been cruelly murdered, whose mother had been hounded to her death, whose family had been made to endure the torment of a ferocious persecution, and whose kith and kin, even to remote degrees, were plundered and imprisoned.  His brother James did not go into the war until 1864, and was a brave, dauntless, high-spirited boy who never killed a soldier in his life save in fair and open battle.  Cole was a fair-haired, amiable, generous man, devoted in his friendships and true to his word and to comradeship.  In intrepidity he was never surpassed. In battle he never had those to go where he would not follow, aye, where he would not gladly lead.  On his body today there are the scars of thirty-six wounds.  He was a Guerrilla and a giant among a band of Guerrillas, but he was one among five hundred who only killed in open and honorable battle.  As great as had been his provocation, he never murdered; as brutal as had been the treatment of every one near and dear to him, he refused always to take vengeance on those who were innocent of the wrongs and who had taken no part in the deeds which drove him, a boy, into the ranks of the Guerrillas, but he fought as a soldier who rights for a cause, a creed, an idea, or for glory. He was a hero and he was merciful.”      17. THE EDICTS OF OUTLAWRY   While I was on the Pacific slope, April 8, 1865, to be exact, the state of Missouri adopted what is known to the disgrace of its author as the Drake constitution.  Confederate soldiers and sympathizers were prohibited from practicing any profession, preaching the gospel, acting as deacon in a church, or doing various other things, under penalty of a fine not less than $500 or imprisonment in the county jail not less than six months. Section 4 of Article 11 gave amnesty to union soldiers for their acts after Jan. 1, 1861, but held Confederates responsible for acts done either as soldiers or citizens, and Section 12 provided for the indictment, trial and punishment of persons accused of crime in counties other than the one where the offense was committed.  The result of this was that Missourians were largely barred by law from holding office and the state was overrun with “carpetbag” office-holders, many of whom came from Kansas, and during the war had been freebooters and bushwhackers up and down the Kansas border.  Organizing a posse from men like themselves, sheriffs or others pretending to be sheriffs would take their mobs, rout men out of their beds at night under service of writs, on which the only return ever made was a pistol shot somewhere in the darkness, maybe in the victim’s dooryard, perhaps in some lonely country road.  Visiting for a time with my uncle on the Pacific slope, I returned to Jackson county in the fall of 1865 to pick up the scattered ends of a ruined family fortune.  I was 21, and no man of my age in Missouri, perhaps, had better prospects, if I had been unmolested.  Mother had been driven to a refuge in a cabin on one of our farms, my brother Jim had been away during the last few months of the war fighting in the army, and had been taken prisoner in Quantrell’s last fight at Wakefield’s house near Smiley, Ky.  He was taken to the military prison at Alton, Ill., and was released in the fall of 1865, coming home within a few days of my return.                         [Illustration: Jim Younger]                                 Jim Younger   Our faithful negro servant, “Aunt Suse,” had been hung up in the barn in a vain endeavor to make her reveal the whereabouts of my mother’s sons and money; my dead father’s fortune had been stolen and scattered to the winds; but our farms were left, and had I been given an opportunity to till them in peace it would have saved four wasted lives.  In the summer of 1866 the governor of Kansas made a requisition on the governor of Missouri for 300 men, naming them, who had taken part in the attacks on Lawrence and other Kansas towns.  Attorneys in Independence had decided that they would defend, free of charge, for any offense except murder, any of the Jackson county boys who would give themselves up.  No one did more than I to assemble the boys at Blue Springs for a meeting to consider such course.  It was while at this that I saw Jesse James for the first time in my life, so that sets at rest all the wild stories that have been told about our meeting as boys and joining Quantrell.  Frank James and I had seen service together, and Frank was a good soldier, too.  Jesse, however, did not enter the service until after I had gone South in the fall of 1863, and when I saw him early in the summer of 1866 he was still suffering from the shot through the lung he had received in the last battle in Johnson county in May, 1865.                 [Illustration: Jesse James and Frank James]                  Jesse James (top) and Frank James (bottom)   The spectre of Paola now rose to haunt me.  Although all the guerrillas knew who had killed young Judy, his father had secured my indictment in Kansas on the charge of murdering his son.  Judy, who had returned to Missouri as the appointed sheriff of Cass county, had a posse prepared to serve a writ for me in its usual way—a night visit and then the pistol or the rope.  I consulted with old ex-Governor King at Richmond, who had two sons in the Federal army, one of whom I had captured during the war, although he did not know it at the time, and with Judge Tutt of this district.  Judge Tutt said there was no sheriff in this vicinity who would draw a jury that would give me a fair trial.  If I should so make oath he, as judge, would appoint a jury commissioner who would summon a jury that would give me a fair trial, but he was confident that as soon as he did so mob law would be invoked before I could go to trial.  One man had been taken from the train and hung at Warrensburg and there had been many like offenses against former Confederate soldiers.  Judy had no legal rights in Jackson county, but in spite of that his posse started for the Younger farm one night to take me.  George Belcher, a Union soldier, but not in sympathy with mob law, heard of Judy’s plans, and through Sam Colwell and Zach Cooper, neighbors, I was warned in the evening of the intended raid.  When they came I was well out of reach on my way to the home of my great-uncle, Thomas Fristoe, in Howard county.  Judy and his mob searched the house in vain, but they put up for a midnight supper which they compelled the faithful “Aunt Suse” to provide, and left disappointed.  Judy and his Kansas indictment were the entering wedge in a wasted life. But for him and his mob law Mr. and Mrs. Cole Younger, for there was a dear sweetheart awaiting my return, might have been happy and prosperous residents of Jackson county from 1866 to this day.  It was while I was visiting my great-uncle in Howard county that there took place at Liberty the first of a long string of bank and train robberies, all of which were usually attributed either to the Younger brothers, or to some of their friends, and which we were unable to come out and successfully refute for two reasons, first the bringing down of a storm about the heads of those who had sheltered us; and second, giving such pursuers as Judy and his posse fresh clues to our whereabouts.      18. NOT ALL BLACK   From the mass of rubbish that has been written about the guerrilla there is little surprise that the popular conception of him should be a fiendish, bloodthirsty wretch.  Yet he was, in many cases, if not in most, a man who had been born to better things, and who was made what he was by such outrages as Osceola, Palmyra, and a hundred other raids less famous, but not less infamous, that were made by Kansans into Missouri during the war.  When the war ceased those of the guerrillas who were not hung or shot, or pursued by posses till they found the hand of man turned against them at every step, settled down to become good citizens in the peaceful walks of life, and the survivors of Quantrell’s band may be pardoned, in view of the black paint that has been devoted to them, in calling attention to the fact that of the members of Quantrell’s command who have since been entrusted with public place not one has ever betrayed his trust.
