I cannot admit that my mode of living is any of your business, Janet. In these retired but respectable rooms I have worked and been contented for years, until----\"  \"Until you came into your money and found you didn't have to worry over your next meal,\" she interjected. \"Well, that ought to make you still more content. And that reminds me of the second object of my visit. I want some money.\"  \"So soon?\"  \"Don't try to crawfish; it was agreed you should give me a check whenever I asked for it. I want it now, and for the full amount--every single penny of it!\"  He stared at her fixedly, seeming fearful and uncertain how to answer.  \"I cannot spare it all today.\"  \"Humbug!\" she snapped. \"You can and will spare it. I must have the money, or----\"  Her significant pause caused him to wriggle in his seat.  \"You're a miserly coward,\" she declared. \"I'm not robbing you; you will have an abundance for your needs. Why do you quarrel with Dame Fortune? Don't you realize you can pay your rent now and eat three square meals a day, and not have to work and slave for them? You can smoke a good cigar after your dinner, instead of that eternal pipe, and go to a picture show whenever the mood strikes you. Why, man, you're independent for the first time in your life, and the finances are as sure as shooting for a good seven years to come.\"  He glanced uneasily at Alora.  \"Owing to my dead wife's generosity,\" he muttered.  Janet laughed.  \"Of course,\" said she; \"and, if you play your cards skillfuly, when Alora comes of age she will provide for you an income for the rest of your life. You're in luck. And why? Just because you are Jason Jones and long ago married Antoinette Seaver and her millions and are now reaping your reward! So, for decency's sake, don't grumble about writing me that check.\"  All this was frankly said in the presence of Alora Jones, the heiress, of whose person and fortune, her father, Jason Jones, was now sole guardian. It was not strange that the man seemed annoyed and ill at ease. His scowl grew darker and his eyes glinted in an ugly way as he replied, after a brief pause:  \"You seem to have forgotten Alora's requirements and my duty to her.\"  \"Pooh, a child! But we've allowed liberally for her keep, I'm sure. She can't keep servants and three dressmakers, it's true, but a simple life is best for her. She'll grow up a more sensible and competent woman by waiting on herself and living; as most girls do. At her age I didn't have shoes or stockings. Alora has been spoiled, and a bit of worldly experience will do her good.\"  \"She's going to be very rich, when she comes into her fortune,\" said Alora's father, \"and then----\"  \"And then she can do as she likes with her money. Just now her income is too big for her needs, and the best thing you can do for her is to teach her economy--a virtue you seem to possess, whether by nature or training, in a high degree. But I didn't come here to argue. Give me that check.\"  He walked over to his little desk, sat down and drew a check book from his pocket.  Alora, although she had listened intently to the astonishing conversation, did not quite comprehend what it meant. Janet's harsh statement bewildered her as much as did her father's subject subservience to the woman. All she realized was that Janet Orme, her dead mother's nurse, wanted money--Alora's money--and her father was reluctant to give it to her but dared not refuse. Money was an abstract quantity to the eleven year old child; she had never handled it personally and knew nothing of its value. If her father owed Janet some of her money, perhaps it was for wages, or services rendered her mother, and Alora was annoyed that he haggled about it, even though the woman evidently demanded more than was just. There was plenty of money, she believed, and it was undignified to argue with a servant.  Jason Jones wrote the check and, rising, handed it to Janet.  \"There,\" said he, \"that squares our account. It is what I agreed to give you, but I did not think you would demand it so soon. To pay it just now leaves me in an embarrassing position.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" she rejoined. \"You're cutting coupons every month or so, and you may thank your stars I don't demand a statement of your income. But I know you, Jason Jones, and you can't hoodwink me, try as you may. You hid yourself in this hole and thought I wouldn't know where to find you, but you'll soon learn that you can't escape my eagle eye. So take your medicine like a man, and thank your lucky stars that you're no longer a struggling, starving, unrecognized artist. Good-bye until I call again.\"  \"You're not to call again!\" he objected.  \"Well, we'll see. Just for the present I'm in no mood to quarrel with you, and you'd better not quarrel with _me,_ Jason Jones. Good-bye.\"  She tucked the check into her purse and ambled out of the room after a supercilious nod to Alora, who failed to return the salutation. Jason Jones stood in his place, still frowning, until Janet's high-heeled shoes had clattered down the two flights of stairs. Alora went to the window and looking down saw that a handsome automobile stood before the house, with a chauffeur and footman in livery. Janet entered this automobile and was driven away.  Alora turned to look at her father. He was filing his pipe and scowling more darkly than ever.    CHAPTER VI FLITTING  Once more they moved suddenly, and the second flitting came about in this way:  Alora stood beside the easel one morning, watching her father work on his picture. Not that she was especially interested in him or the picture, but there was nothing else for her to do. She stood with her slim legs apart, her hands clasped behind her, staring rather vacantly, when he looked up and noted her presence.  \"Well, what do you think of it?\" he asked rather sharply.  \"Of the picture?\" said Lory.  \"Of course.\"  \"I don't like it,\" she asserted, with childish frankness.  \"Eh? You don't like it? Why not, girl?\"  \"Well,\" she replied, her eyes narrowing critically, \"that cow's horn isn't on straight--the red cow's left horn. And it's the same size, all the way up.\"  He laid down his palette and brush and gazed at his picture for a long time. The scowl came on his face again. Usually his face was stolid and expressionless, but Alora had begun to observe that whenever anything irritated or disturbed him he scowled, and the measure of the scowl indicated to what extent he was annoyed. When he scowled at his own unfinished picture Lory decided he was honest enough to agree with her criticism of it.  Finally the artist took a claspknife from his pocket, opened the blade and deliberately slashed the picture from top to bottom, this way and that, until it was a mere mass of shreds. Then he kicked the stretcher into a corner and brought out another picture, which he placed on the easel.  \"Well, how about that?\" he asked, looking hard at it himself.  Alora was somewhat frightened at having caused the destruction of the cow picture. So she hesitated before replying: \"I--I'd rather not say.\"  \"How funny!\" he said musingly, \"but until now I never realized how stiff and unreal the daub is. Shall I finish it, Alora?\"  \"I think so, sir,\" she answered.  Again the knife slashed through the canvas and the remains joined the scrap-heap in the corner.  Jason Jones was not scowling any more. Instead, there was a hint of a humorous expression on his usually dull features. Only pausing to light his pipe, he brought out one after another of his canvases and after a critical look destroyed each and every one.  Lory was perplexed at the mad act, for although her judgment told her they were not worth keeping, she realized that her father must have passed many laborious hours on them. But now that it had dawned on him how utterly inartistic his work was, in humiliation and disgust he had wiped it out of existence. With this thought in mind, the girl was honestly sorry him.  But Jason Jones did not seem sorry. When the last ruined canvas had been contemptuously flung into the corner he turned to the child and said to her in a voice so cheerful that it positively startled her:  \"Get your hat and let's take a walk. An artist's studio is no place for us, Lory. Doesn't it seem deadly dull in here? And outside the sun is shining!\"  The rest of the day he behaved much like a human being. He took the girl to the park to see the zoo, and bought her popcorn and peanuts--a wild extravagance, for him. Later in the day they went to a picture show and finally entered a down-town restaurant, quite different from and altogether better than the one where they had always before eaten, and enjoyed a really good dinner. When they left the restaurant he was still in the restless and reckless mood that had dominated him and said:  \"Suppose we go to a theatre? Won't you like that better than you would returning to our poky rooms?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" responded Alora.  They had seats in the gallery, but could see very well. Just before the curtain rose Alora noticed a party being seated in one of the boxes. The lady nearest the rail, dressed in an elaborate evening gown, was Janet Orme. There was another lady with her, conspicuous for blonde hair and much jewelry, and the two gentlemen who accompanied them kept in the background, as if not too proud of their company.  Alora glanced at her father's face and saw the scowl there, for he, too, had noted the box-party. But neither of the two made any remark and soon the child was fully absorbed in the play.  As they left the theatre Janet's party was entering an automobile, laughing and chatting gaily. Both father and daughter silently watched them depart, and then they took a street car and went home.  \"Get to bed, girl,\" said Jason"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24578"],["title","Mary Louise Solves a Mystery (#6)"],["body",", when they had mounted the stairs. \"I'll smoke another pipe, I guess.\"  When she came out of her room next morning she heard her father stirring in the studio. She went to him and was surprised to find him packing his trunk, which he had drawn into the middle of the room.  \"Now that you're up,\" said he in quite a cheerful tone, \"we'll go to breakfast, and then I'll help you pack your own duds. Only one trunk, though, girl, for the other must go into storage and you may see it again, some time, and you may not.\"  \"Are we going away?\" she inquired, hoping it might be true.  \"We are. We're going a long way, my girl. Do you care?\"  \"Of course,\" said she, amazed at the question, for he had never considered her in the least. \"I'm glad. I don't like your studio.\"  He laughed, and the laugh shocked her. She could not remember ever to have heard Jason Jones laugh before.  \"I don't like the place, either, girl, and that's why I'm leaving it. For good, this time. I was a fool to return here. In trying to economise, I proved extravagant.\"  Alora did not reply to that. She was eager to begin packing and hurried through her breakfast. All the things she might need on a journey she put into one trunk. She was not quite sure what she ought to take, and her father was still more ignorant concerning a little girl's wardrobe, but finally both trunks were packed and locked and then Mr. Jones called a wagon and carted away the extra trunk of Alora's and several boxes of his own to be deposited in a storage warehouse.  She sat in the bare studio and waited for his return. The monotony of the past weeks, which had grown oppressive, was about to end and for this she was very grateful. For from a life of luxury the child had been dumped into a gloomy studio in the heart of a big, bustling city that was all unknown to her and where she had not a single friend or acquaintance. Her only companion had been a strange man who happened to be her father but displayed no affection for her, no spark of interest in her happiness or even comforts. For the first time in her life she lacked a maid to dress her and keep her clothes in order; there was no one to attend to her education, no one to amuse her, no one with whom to counsel in any difficulty. She had been somewhat afraid of her peculiar father and her natural reserve, derived from her mother, had deepened in his society. Yesterday and this morning he had seemed more human, more companionable, yet Alora felt that it was due to a selfish elation and recognized a gulf between them that might never be bridged. Her father differed utterly from her mother in breeding, in intelligence, in sympathy. He was not of the same world; even the child could realize that. And yet, he was her father--all she had left to depend upon, to cling to. She wondered if he really possessed the good qualities her mother had attributed to him. If so, when she knew him better, she might learn to like him.  He was gone a long time, it seemed, but as soon as he returned the remaining baggage was loaded on the wagon and sent away and then they left the flat and boarded a street car for down town. On lower Broadway Mr. Jones entered a bank and seemed to transact considerable business. Lory saw him receive several papers and a lot of money. Then they went to a steamship office near by, where her father purchased tickets.  Afterward they had lunch, and Jason Jones was still in high spirits and seemed more eager and excited than Alora had ever before known him.  \"We're going across the big water--to Europe,\" he told her at luncheon, \"so if there is anything you positively need for the trip, tell me what it is and I'll buy it. No frivolities, though,\" qualifying his generosity, \"but just stern necessities. And you must think quick, for our boat leaves at four o'clock and we've no time to waste.\"  But Alora shook her head. Once she had been taken by her mother to London, Paris and Rome, but all her wants had been attended to and it was so long ago--four or five years--that that voyage was now but a dim remembrance.  No one noticed them when they went aboard. There was no one to see them off or to wish them \"bon voyage.\" It saddened the child to hear the fervent good-byes of others, for it emphasized her own loneliness.  Yes, quite friendless was little Alora. She was going to a foreign land with no companion but a strange and uncongenial man whom fate had imposed upon her in the guise of a parent. As they steamed out to sea and Alora sat on deck and watched the receding shores of America, she turned to her father with the first question she had ventured to ask:  \"Where are we going? To London?\"  \"Not now,\" he replied. \"This ship is bound for the port of Naples. I didn't pick Naples, you know, but took the first ship sailing to-day. Having made up my mind to travel, I couldn't wait,\" he added, with a chuckle of glee. \"You're not particular as to where we go, are you?\"  \"No,\" said Alora.  \"That's lucky,\" he rejoined, \"for it wouldn't have made any difference, anyhow.\"    CHAPTER VII MARY LOUISE INTRUDES  It was four years later when on a sunny afternoon in April a carriage broke down on the Amalfi Road, between Positano and Sorrento, in Italy. A wheel crumpled up and the driver stopped his horses and explained to his passengers in a jumble of mixed Italian and English that he could go no farther. The passengers, an old gentleman of distinguished appearance and a young girl as fresh and lovely as a breath of spring, clambered out of the rickety vehicle and after examining the wheel admitted that their driver spoke truly. On one side the road was a steep descent to the sea; opposite, the hillside was masked by a trellis thick with grapevines. The road curved around the mountain, so there was no other vista.  \"Here's a nice fix, Gran'pa Jim!\" exclaimed the girl, with an amused laugh. \"Where are we and what's going to become of us?\"  \"That is somewhat of a complicated problem, Mary Louise, and I can't guess it offhand, without due reflection,\" replied \"Gran'pa Jim,\" whom others called Colonel Hathaway. \"I imagine, however, that we are about three miles from Positano and five or six from Sorrento, and it's a stiff walk, for old legs or young, in either direction. Besides, there's our luggage, which I am loth to abandon and disinclined to carry.\"  The driver interposed.  \"Give-a me the moment, Signore--perhaps the hour--an' I return to Positano for more carriage-wheel--some other. My Cousin L'uigi, he leeve in Positano, an' L'uigi have a-many carriage-wheel in he's shed. I sure, Signore, I getta the wheel.\"  \"That is a sensible idea,\" said the old gentleman. \"Make haste, my man, and we will wait here.\"  The driver unhitched his horses from the vehicle and after strapping a blanket on one of them for a saddle mounted it and departed.  \"I take-a the two horse,\" he explained, \"for one to ride-a me, an' one for to ride-a the wheel.\"  They watched him amble away down the road and Mary Louise shook her head and remarked:  \"He will never make it in an hour, at that rate, Gran'pa Jim, and in two hours the sun will have set and it will be dinner time. Already I feel the pangs of hunger.\"  \"Those who travel in Italy,\" said her grandfather, \"should be prepared to accept any happening in a spirit of resignation. A moment ago we were jogging merrily along toward a good hotel and a savory dinner, but now----\"  \"This entire carriage seems ready to fall apart,\" declared the girl, standing in the road and viewing the ancient vehicle critically; \"so it's a wonder something didn't break sooner. Now, if we could get to the other side of that trellis, Gran'pa Jim, we might find a shady spot to rest while our charioteer is searching for a new wheel.\"  \"There must be a gate, somewhere about,\" he answered, eyeing the vine-clad barrier. \"Come, Mary Louise, let us investigate.\"  A hundred yards down the road they came to some rude stone steps and a wicket. The old gentleman lifted the wooden latch and found the gate unlocked. Followed by Mary Louise, he entered the vineyard and discovered a narrow, well-beaten path leading up the hillside.  \"Perhaps there is a house near by,\" said the girl. \"Shall we go on, Gran'pa Jim?\"  \"Why not, my dear? These Italians are hospitable folk and we may get a cake and a cup of goat's milk to stay our appetite.\"  So they climbed the hill, following the little path, and presently came upon a laborer who was very deliberately but methodically cultivating the vines with a V-shaped hoe. Seeing the strangers the man straightened up and, leaning upon his hoe, eyed them with evident suspicion.  \"Good afternoon,\" said the old gentleman in Italian--one of the few phrases in the language he had mastered.  \"Oh, I speak the English, Signore,\" replied the man, doffing his hat. \"I am Silvio Allegheri, you must know, and I live in America some time.\"  \"Why, this is like meeting an old friend!\" exclaimed Mary Louise, winning the fellow instantly with her smile. \"But why did you leave America, Silvio?\"  \"Because I have make my fortune there,\" was the solemn reply. \"It is easy to make the fortune in America, Signorina. I am chef in the restaurant in Sandusky--you know Sandusky?--most excellent! In a few years I save much money, then I return here an' purchase an estate. My estate is three miles across the hill, yonder, and there is a road to it which is not much used. However, it is a fine estate, an' I am rent it to my cousin for five hundred lira a year. Such good business habit I learn in America.\"  \"Why don't you live on your estate yourself?\" inquired the girl.  \"It is not yet the time,\" answered the man, with a shake of his head. \"I am but fifty-two years alive, and while I am still so young I shall work for others, and save the money my estate brings me. When I get old and can no longer work for the others, then I will go to my estate an' be happy.\"  \"Very sensible,\" commented the old gentleman. \"And whom do you work for now?\"  \"The"]]]
