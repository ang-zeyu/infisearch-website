He was very angry. \"There's been some trick played on us,\" he said.  \"Where's my sled, Mr. Turtle?\" Jimmy Rabbit asked. He turned around. But Mr. Turtle had vanished. He had jumped into the brook and swum away.  So Jimmy Rabbit did not get the sled after all. But he was so pleased over the way he had outwitted Tommy Fox that he didn't care very much. And all his friends said that he was not only a fast runner, but a very clever fellow as well.     [Illustration: 9 Playing Leap-Frog]  9  Playing Leap-Frog   There was great joy in the woods. Jimmy Rabbit had promised to teach his friends a new game. Frisky Squirrel and Billy Woodchuck, Fatty Coon and Tommy Fox, were all on hand to have their share of the fun.  \"What's the game called?\" Frisky Squirrel asked.  \"It's leap-frog,\" Jimmy told him.  \"Shucks!\" said Fatty Coon. \"The frog's not here yet. And we can't do anything till _he_ comes.\"  Jimmy Rabbit laughed.  \"You don't need a frog to play leap-frog,\" he said. \"Just squat down in front of me and I'll show you how it's done.\"  Frisky Squirrel did just as Jimmy told him to do. And Jimmy ran up behind him, put his front paws on Frisky's back, and leaped over him. Then he ran on a little way. And when he stopped, he crouched down and called to Fatty Coon to jump over them both.  Soon they were all playing leap-frog, though Tommy Fox said that he didn't think it was much of a game.  \"There's more to it than you think,\" Jimmy said. \"I haven't taught you the whole game yet.\"  \"Well, I want to learn it all,\" Tommy Fox grumbled.  \"Wait until you do this part better,\" Jimmy Rabbit said. \"Then I'll show you something different. You must learn to leap higher and further. You're not half as good a jumper as I supposed you were.\"  Tommy Fox did not like that very well. And if he and Jimmy Rabbit had been alone I am afraid he would have done something very unpleasant to Jimmy. But now he only snarled a little, and showed his teeth, and said that he could leap higher and further than any of the others.  \"Well, you're a good boaster, anyhow,\" said Jimmy.  Everybody laughed at that--except Tommy Fox. _He_ frowned. And when it was his turn to leap over the others he sprang so high and so far that he jumped over Frisky Squirrel and Fatty Coon together, without once touching the ground. It was really a wonderful jump.  \"What do you think of that?\" Tommy asked with a grin. \"Can any of you beat that?\"  \"It's a pretty fair leap,\" Jimmy Rabbit admitted. \"But I've seen better. When I'm in practice I can do better myself. A really good leap-frog player ought to be able to jump over three people at a time.\"  Fatty Coon shook his head. He was not much of a jumper--he was so fat, and his legs were so short. And he didn't believe he could ever leap over three people at a time.  \"I could do it, if you'd let me start from a tree,\" Frisky Squirrel said.  But Jimmy told him that that was never allowed.  \"It's against the rules of the game,\" he explained.  \"Well, I can do it, and start on the ground, too,\" Tommy Fox boasted. \"I can do anything anybody else can do.\"  \"I believe you can,\" Jimmy Rabbit said, to everybody's surprise. For they all knew that he didn't like Tommy Fox. \"We'll give you a good, fair chance to try it,\" Jimmy went on. \"You squat here,\" he told Fatty Coon. And he pointed out the exact place where he wanted Fatty to stand. A little way behind Fatty, he stationed Frisky Squirrel. And back of Frisky he took his own place.  \"Now!\" Jimmy Rabbit said, \"are you all ready?\"  \"Yes,\" they cried.  \"I'm coming!\" called Tommy Fox. And he came running up behind them. He rested his front paws on Jimmy Rabbit's back. And just as he leaped, Jimmy Rabbit leaped too.  You might say that Tommy Fox made a double jump. His own jump would have been a high one. But when Jimmy jumped, it sent Tommy Fox all the higher into the air. He went sailing far above Frisky Squirrel and Fatty Coon; and still he kept on, turning and tumbling, head over heels, until at last he landed with a great splash in the same deep pool where the hornets chased Cuffy Bear one time.  When Tommy Fox crawled out upon the bank, dripping wet, the leap-frog players were nowhere to be seen.  Though Tommy did not know it, at that very moment they were hidden in the woods, rolling over and over upon the ground, and laughing as if they would never stop.  Finally Jimmy Rabbit sat up and wiped the tears off his face. He had laughed so hard that he had cried.  \"I told him I'd teach him something different about leap-frog,\" he said.     [Illustration: 10 The Tooth Puller]  10  The Tooth Puller   Jimmy Rabbit was always changing his mind about what he was going to be when he grew up. First he thought he would be a gardener, so he would always have plenty of vegetables to eat. Next he decided he would be a preacher, because, so far as he could see, they never did anything except talk--and he was sure _that_ couldn't be very hard work. And one day he told his mother that he expected to become a tramp, so he wouldn't have to wash his face. But she soon put that idea out of his head. So Jimmy had to think of something else.  [Illustration: Jimmy Rabbit hurts Frisky Squirrel]  Now, he had heard that there were places where one could go to have a tooth pulled. And it seemed to him that it must be very pleasant to pull teeth. And he saw no reason why he need wait till he grew up, either. He saw no reason why he should not begin at once.  Jimmy knew of a hollow stump not far away which would make as fine an office as anyone could want. So he hopped into the woods. And outside the hollow stump he nailed a sign that said:      JAMES RABBIT     TOOTH PULLER  He didn't have to wait any time at all before some one came along.  It was Frisky Squirrel. And the moment he read the sign he decided that one of his teeth was in need of pulling.  \"Come right in!\" Jimmy Rabbit said. He had on a white apron, which he had borrowed from his mother when she was not looking. And in his hand he held a big pair of pincers, which he had borrowed from his father while Mr. Rabbit was away from home.  \"Do you really know how to pull a tooth?\" Frisky asked.  \"I've never yet had a complaint from anyone who let me pull a tooth for him,\" Jimmy Rabbit said. And that was perfectly true--for he had never pulled a tooth in his whole life.  It would have been a shame if Frisky Squirrel had lost one of his sharp, white teeth. But Frisky didn't know that. He thought it would be fun. And he sat down and told Jimmy Rabbit he was ready.  So Jimmy Rabbit stepped up to him. But he hadn't any more than closed his pincers when Frisky Squirrel began to scream.  Jimmy Rabbit was so surprised that he let the pincers drop and jumped back.  \"My goodness!\" he said. \"How you startled me! I didn't hurt you, did I?\"  \"Yes, you did!\" Frisky answered. And Jimmy could see that he was angry. \"You hurt my lip terribly.\"  \"Well, you must have moved,\" said Jimmy. \"Having a tooth pulled is a good deal like having your picture taken. You have to sit very still.\"  Now, sitting still was something that Frisky Squirrel never was able to do.  \"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"but I shall have to get along with my teeth just as they are.\"  \"Better try once more!\" Jimmy urged him. \"Most everybody has at least _one_ tooth out. It's quite the fashion.\"  But Frisky would not let him try again.  \"I haven't heard that it was the fashion to have your lip pulled off,\" he said. \"But I'll stay here a while,\" he added. He wanted to _see_ a tooth pulled, even if it wasn't his own.  \"Do!\" said Jimmy Rabbit. \"And after you've seen how easily the thing's done, I've no doubt you will want me to 'tend to your case.\" He was very cheerful.  But Frisky Squirrel did not appear very happy. His lip pained him terribly.  [Illustration]     [Illustration: 11 A Slight Dispute]  11  A Slight Dispute   You may have heard somewhere of Uncle Jerry Chuck. He was an old woodchuck who lived in Farmer Green's pasture. And he was known far and wide as the stingiest person in Pleasant Valley. He never paid for anything if he could possibly help it.  Well, Uncle Jerry had the toothache. That was nothing new for him, either. He often had the toothache. And it was always the same tooth, too--because he had only one in his head. But he never would go and have his tooth pulled, because he simply _hated_ the thought of paying anyone to take it out. He had an idea that _he_ was the one who should be paid. But he never could find a dentist who looked at the matter in that light.  Uncle Jerry was strolling through the woods. He had a big red handkerchief tied about his face, because it was a cold day. And he was getting very tired of the toothache. He was just wishing that he could get rid of it--for nothing. He even thought he would be willing to part with that tooth without asking any pay for it, when what should he see right in front of him but a big sign, which said:      JAMES RABBIT     TOOTH PULLER  \"Hello!\" said Uncle Jerry. \"Here's something new! I've never noticed that sign before.\" And he stepped inside the hollow stump to which the sign was nailed.  And there he found Jimmy Rabbit, in a white apron, and with a pair of pincers in his hand. Frisky Squirrel was there, too, sitting in a corner and holding onto his head.  \"What are your prices?\" Uncle Jerry asked.  \"An ear of corn for a tooth!\" said Jimmy Rabbit promptly.  \"That's reasonable enough,\" Uncle Jerry Chuck replied. And he sat down at once. \"Go ahead!\" he said.  Jimmy Rabbit was delighted.  \"Which one is it?\" he asked.  \"All of them!\" said Uncle Jerry.  That was even better than Jimmy had expected. But when he looked inside Uncle Jerry's mouth he was disappointed.  \"Why, you've only one tooth in your head!\" he exclaimed in his surprise.  \"Hurry up!\" Uncle Jerry snapped. \"I came here to have a tooth pulled--not _to be talked to_.\" He was always ill tempered. And his toothache only made him crosser than ever.  So"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24628"],["title","The Tale of Jimmy Rabbit (#4)"],["body","Rabbit went to work. He tugged away with all his might and main. Now and then Uncle Jerry groaned. And whenever he groaned, Jimmy turned pale. For he was somewhat afraid of the old gentleman.  At last Jimmy tumbled backward, head over heels. That was when the tooth came out.  \"Well, you were long enough about it, I must say!\" Uncle Jerry Chuck said. \"Give me my ear of corn now, for I must hurry home.\"  \"Give _you your_ ear of corn?\" Jimmy Rabbit cried. He could scarcely believe his own ears--and goodness knows they were big enough to hear anything anybody said.  \"Why, certainly!\" Uncle Jerry replied. \"I asked you your prices, you know. And you said: 'An ear of corn for a tooth!'\"  Jimmy Rabbit didn't know what to do.  \"Why\"--he gasped, \"I thought _you_ were going to pay _me_!\"  \"Well, you see you were mistaken,\" Uncle Jerry told him. \"And you had better give me that ear of corn at once, or it will be the worse for you.\"  For all the old fellow was toothless, Jimmy saw that his claws were long and sharp. He knew that he had got himself into a fix. And he couldn't think of any way out of it.  \"You've got my tooth! I want an ear of corn! You've got my tooth! I want an ear of corn!\" Uncle Jerry Chuck kept saying. And each time he said it, his voice grew louder, until he was shouting at the top of his lungs.  Then Jimmy Rabbit had an idea. He picked up Uncle Jerry's tooth off the floor and placed it in Uncle Jerry's hand.  \"There's your tooth!\" he cried. \"I don't want it!\"  \"But you promised to give me an ear of corn for my tooth!\" said Uncle Jerry.  \"Well, haven't you got your tooth?\" asked Jimmy Rabbit.  And Uncle Jerry Chuck was so puzzled that he went home without saying another word.  [Illustration]     [Illustration: 12 The Strange Man]  12  The Strange Man   A strange man had come to stay at Farmer Green's house. It was Jasper Jay who brought the news into the woods.  \"He doesn't seem to work with Farmer Green, or the hired man, either,\" said Jasper. \"When I first saw him he was sitting on the bank of the river, under a great, brown umbrella. But what he was doing I couldn't make out.\"  When Jimmy Rabbit heard that, he knew at once that he wouldn't be able to sleep a wink that night unless he found out exactly what the strange man was about. So he went off toward Swift River with a skip and a hop. He was always like that. Whenever there was a new sight to be seen, Jimmy Rabbit was sure to be among the first to see it.  He had no trouble in finding what he was looking for. There on the river bank was a huge umbrella. Jimmy was sure it was the biggest one in the world. And under the umbrella sat the strange man. In one hand he grasped a queerly shaped board, and a number of sticks; and in the other he held one of the sticks, with which he kept dabbing at a big, flat thing that stood in front of him.  Jimmy Rabbit was puzzled. He stole nearer. And at last he had crept so close that when he stood on his hind legs he could see what the man was working at.  To his great surprise, he discovered that Swift River was rushing and tumbling across the big, flat object which was propped upright in front of the stranger.  Jimmy couldn't understand it. Was the man fishing? he wondered. And how had he managed to get Swift River out of its banks like that?  Jimmy Rabbit began to think that the strange man had used magic. Why, he wasn't even wet!  And Jimmy turned and ran back home. If he hadn't happened to meet Mr. Crow, probably he would never have known to this day what that man was doing.  But Mr. Crow knew right away.  \"That wasn't really Swift River that you saw in front of him. It was just something that looked like it.... Haven't you ever seen a picture?\" Mr. Crow asked.  Jimmy Rabbit had to admit that he had never had that pleasure.  \"Well!\" said Mr. Crow. \"I can tell you where you can see better pictures than that man can make. He only paints rivers and mountains, and lakes. But down at Farmer Green's, all over the front of the barn, you'll find the most beautiful pictures anyone could ask for. You'll see ladies riding on horses--standing up, mind you! And you'll see men perched one on top of another until they reach the clouds. And animals! There are the oddest looking animals--different from anything you ever saw in these woods.\"  \"I'm going right down there,\" Jimmy Rabbit said. \"I'm very glad to have met you, Mr. Crow. And thank you, very much!\" It was not often that Jimmy was so polite.  He was almost afraid that Mr. Crow was playing some trick on him. But it was all just as Mr. Crow had said--only ten times more wonderful. And Jimmy Rabbit made up his mind, before he came away from Farmer Green's barn, that he wanted to make pictures himself.  Mr. Crow had said that the strange man, who made the picture of Swift River, was an artist. Well, Jimmy intended to begin to be an artist the very next day. And he was so grateful to Mr. Crow for explaining everything to him that he decided he would do something specially nice for the old gentleman.  And all at once a happy thought came into Jimmy's head. He would make a picture of Mr. Crow!  [Illustration]     [Illustration: 13 Mr. Crow's Picture]  13  Mr. Crow's Picture   In the woods near the foot of Blue Mountain news travels fast. Soon everybody knew that Jimmy Rabbit had become an artist. And many of the woods-people put on their best clothes and hurried to Jimmy's house, to have their pictures painted.  They were disappointed when Jimmy told them all that they would have to wait.  \"But after I've made a picture of Mr. Crow you shall each have your turn,\" he promised.  Some of them grumbled. And Mr. Fox, especially, was very disagreeable.  \"I was the first one here,\" he said. \"I don't see why I should have to wait for old Mr. Crow.\"  But Jimmy Rabbit would not listen to him. He felt quite important.  \"I shall have to ask you all to go away now,\" he said. \"Painting pictures is very difficult work. It would make me nervous to have so many people watching me.\"  So his callers left him--all but Mr. Fox.  \"I'm going to stay right here,\" Mr. Fox said. \"And as soon as you finish with Mr. Crow, you can begin my picture.\" And he looked so surly that Jimmy Rabbit didn't dare object.  At last Mr. Crow arrived.  \"I'd have been here before,\" he said, \"but I stopped to get a new hat.\"  \"That's too bad!\" Jimmy told him. \"You know, gentlemen never wear hats when they're having their portraits painted. But I'll tell you what you can do,\" he added, for he saw that Mr. Crow was disappointed. \"You can hold your hat in your hand.\"  That seemed to make Mr. Crow feel better. But Mr. Fox almost spoiled everything by saying, \"Then he'll have to stand on one leg.\"  Jimmy Rabbit hadn't thought of that. And Mr. Crow only made it harder for him. For he said in a loud voice, \"No hat, no picture!\"  Jimmy Rabbit thought very hard. And pretty soon he smiled all over his face.  \"It's all right!\" he said. \"I know how to fix it, Mr. Crow. You can hold your hat, just as I said.\"  So everybody was happy again--except Mr. Fox, who had hoped that old Mr. Crow would go away.  Jimmy Rabbit showed Mr. Crow where to stand. And then he began to paint. And while he worked, Mr. Fox looked over his shoulder.  It was not long before something seemed to please Mr. Fox, for he smiled broadly.  Mr. Crow noticed that grin.  \"What's he laughing at?\" he asked. \"_I_ don't see anything to laugh at.\"  Jimmy Rabbit looked around. But Mr. Fox was as solemn as an owl.  \"He isn't laughing,\" said Jimmy.  \"Certainly not!\" said Mr. Fox. \"Your eyes must be bad, Mr. Crow.\"  \"Well, I didn't bring my spectacles,\" Mr. Crow answered. \"I thought I'd look better without them.\"  After that Mr. Fox managed to keep a sober face. But _inside_ he was laughing as hard as could be.  \"What makes him shake so?\" Mr. Crow asked, a few minutes later.  \"I must have caught cold,\" Mr. Fox replied. \"I've been chilly all the morning.\"  \"You'd better go home,\" Jimmy Rabbit advised him. But Mr. Fox wouldn't have left for anything.  \"Now he's choking!\" Mr. Crow said. \"I declare, I can't have my picture painted with such goings-on.\" And he started to fly away.  But Jimmy Rabbit begged him to stand still just a little longer.  \"The picture is almost done,\" he said. \"There!\" he added, a bit later. \"It's finished. And I know you'll be pleased.\"  It was clear that Mr. Fox was pleased, for he was actually beaming. Jimmy thought he had never seen him look so pleasant. Mr. Crow had to ask him to stand aside, so _he_ could have a look.  \"I should think I might gaze on my own picture,\" he grumbled.  At first Mr. Crow was delighted. Then he seemed somewhat puzzled.  \"The face is good,\" he said. \"And no one could ask for a better picture of a hat. But there's something that doesn't look quite right.\" And all at once Mr. Crow saw what was the matter. And he flew at the picture and ran his bill through it in a dozen places. \"The idea!\" he said. \"I've never been so insulted in all my life!\" And without another word he flew out of sight.  It was no wonder that he was angry. For in the picture Jimmy Rabbit had painted him with four legs!  \"Well,\" said Jimmy, \"he needn't be so cross about it. It was his own fault. He wanted to hold his hat. And I just _had_ to give him more than one leg to stand on.\"     [Illustration: 14 Boy Lost!]  14  Boy Lost!   Poor Mrs. Rabbit didn't know what to do. Her son Jimmy had not been home since early morning; and she was sure he was lost. She hurried through the woods, looking for him everywhere. But not a trace of him could she find. No one had seen him.  At last Mrs. Rabbit happened to meet Jasper Jay.  \"Have you seen Jimmy?\" she asked.  \"Yes!\" he said. \"Right after breakfast I saw him hurrying along the road by the river. The gypsies have a camp there. And I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they had stolen him,\" he added very cheerfully.  When Mrs. Rabbit heard that she was terribly upset.  \"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" she cried. \"Whatever"]]]
