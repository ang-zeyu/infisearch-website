Amid the excitement and enthusiasm, the band of the United States steamer \"Blackstone\" struck up the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" to which ours responded with \"My country, 'tis of thee.\" Again from the \"Blackstone,\" \"The Red, White and Blue,\" followed by the martial notes of \"Hail Columbia\" from the \"Oceanus\" as she was made fast to the dock. Captain Hunt, of General Hatch's staff, came aboard promptly, and after exchanging congratulations over the great news, tendered us during our stay the \"freedom of the city.\" We were not expected to avail ourselves of this courtesy till morning; a few of us, however, did get out on southern soil, just to stretch ourselves a bit after our long sea-faring, but encountering rather a suspicious looking crowd, we soon returned on board, to await the morrow, the ever-memorable fourteenth of April, 1865.  The day dawned at length, mild and verdant with the breath of spring,               \"And o'er the bay,      Slowly, in all his splendors dight,      The great sun rises to behold the sight.\"  Turning toward the city we could easily distinguish the long line of edifices along the Battery, their windows glittering in the yellow sunshine. Quickly dressing, we set forth on a ramble through the deserted metropolis. There was plenty of time, as the transports were not to leave for Fort Sumter till ten o'clock. Vaughan and I sauntered down East Bay street, among the crumbling and deserted warehouses, to the Battery. This was a long and straight promenade, with stone pavement, commanding a fine prospect of the bay and fortifications. Here, four years before, all was activity and bustle; here the populace assembled, and sent up their frenzied shouts as the flag of the Republic was lowered, and the ensign of Rebellion supplanted it for a season.  How changed the scene! The streets were deserted. The crowds were scattered and gone forever! The silence of desolation reigned on every hand, disturbed only by the songs of the summer birds. Not even a newsboy assailed us with the _Mercury_ or _Courier_, containing an account of the latest victory over the Yankees. Here, along the Battery, were many of the finest residences, stately mansions with broad verandas, which bore the terrible effects of the long bombardment. Their walls were scarred and rent. The roofs were crushed, the glass shattered, piles of rubbish and other débris encumbered the ground, and the grass was growing in the streets. The siege of the city had steadily and relentlessly continued for five hundred and eighty-eight days. It was commenced on the twenty-first of August, 1863, by the opening of the Swamp Angel Battery on Morris Island, five miles away. On the seventh of September, Fort Wagner and Battery Gregg were taken, and more guns were trained upon the city (notably the water battery), compelling the evacuation of the lower part. During the long siege not less than thirteen thousand shot and shell were thrown into the city.  We strolled into the garden of one of the deserted mansions, which still exhibited evidences of taste and culture, even in neglect and decay. Borders of box lined the graveled walks and encircled beautiful flower shrubs, or clusters of japonica, of manifold hues; the mock-orange, the lilac and magnolia tree were blooming luxuriantly, and grew to a remarkable height. What a contrast to the bare gardens we had left at home, amid a cold and cheerless storm. We were now in another zone, in the full bloom of summer. After helping ourselves to roses in abundance, the largest I had ever seen, we passed on up the street. Notices like the following were posted on the doors of some of the houses: \"Occupied by permission of the Provost Marshal, the owner having taken the oath of allegiance to the United States.\" Similar cards in the shop windows announced that the occupants had permission to transact business.  A Charleston lady complained to one of our officers, saying, \"_You_ treat us well enough, but _the niggers_ are _dreadful_ sassy. They don't turn out now when you meet them; they even smoke cigars, and go right up to a gentleman and ask him for a light!\"  [Illustration]  We now began to meet contrabands of all ages and of all sizes, from the little barefooted piccaninnies and chimney sweeps to the old, gray-haired uncles and turbaned aunties. While all appeared bubbling over with joy, yet they were quiet and orderly, greeting us with bows and courtesies, and a \"God bress ye! we're so powerful glad ye've come!\" Said one old negro to another, \"Yer mus' try now, an' do as yer done by, Uncle Rube.\" \"Yeth,\" said Uncle Reuben, \"but de fact am _dis_ chile ain't never been _done by_! Dat's where de shoe pinches!\"  We took great pleasure in calling with other friends upon Colonel Lorenzo Potter, one of the veteran Union citizens, formerly of Providence. He had been at home only a few weeks, but his family had remained through the long and dreary siege. Fortunately the shells from the Union batteries had spared the home of these devoted loyalists.  I remember a fine fig-tree in his garden, laden with fruit, and my disappointment at finding it in a green state, \"for the time of figs was not yet.\" Reluctantly leaving this hospitable family, we made a hasty tour of several public buildings and banks, which we found in a sadly _broken_ and ravaged condition. The elaborately carved counters and wainscoting had been reduced to fragments; the tiled floors and frescoed walls were plowed up and ruined by exploding shells. In one of the banks I secured a collection of both Continental and Confederate notes, the obsolete currency of two centuries. On one of them I read this curious endorsement: \"Payable two years after a treaty of peace between the Confederate and United States Governments.\" But right before me lay the effective protest of the Union shot and shell against any treaty of peace with armed rebellion, in the shape of an immense pile of débris,--broken brick and glass, and charred timbers, the ruins of a once fine and imposing structure. I was told of an estimable lady of Charleston who, after investing her all (fully $5,000) in these Confederate \"promises to pay,\" brought them out at last, and kindled her morning fire with the worthless chaff. Most of the citizens who were considered wealthy at the beginning of the war were reduced to penury at its close, and were to be seen carrying their rations through the streets of Charleston.  \"General Wade Hampton needs horses,\" read the last order of the Governor to the citizens, on the twenty-first of January, 1865, \"and I have told him he shall have them. Put aside your please-carriages for the time, and bring or send in your horses to Columbia. Colonel C.T. Hampton is charged by me with the duty of receiving with thanks all that will be sent, and of _taking_ all that are withheld. The horses will be paid for. No one shall suffer from his devotion to the State.\"  The public conveyances kindly placed at our disposal by the authorities, showed how effectively this order had been carried out. Such a sorry looking set of horses, mules and donkeys, attached to omnibuses, army ambulances and fish-wagons, would appropriately have found a place in a Providence Antique and Horrible procession!  Passing on to the Market Building we stopped to chat with the darkey shop-keepers who occupied the few stalls which were open. We purchased here some sugar-cane and strawberries, the first of the season. The darkeys proved to be pretty shrewd traders, and promptly declined all offers of Confederate currency in payment. One shook his woolly head, saying, \"O, sar, we'd better _gib_ um to you, sar!\" They had evidently acquired some of the sharpness of their old masters, one of whom I read about used to make his negroes _whistle_ while they were picking cherries, for fear they would _eat_ some! But now they could sing their Jubilee hymn, as their colored brethren sung it, marching through Richmond:       \"De whip is lost, de han'cuf broken,      An' massa'l hab to _whistle_ for his _pay_;      He's ole enough, big enough, an' ought to known better      Dan to went an' run'd away:              Ole massa run, ha! ha!              De darkey stay, ho! ho!              It mus' be now dat de kingdom's cummin',              An' de year of Jubilo!\"  Some ragged negro boys on the street, who, by the way they danced, appeared to have india-rubber joints, and who ended their songs with a \"shout\" and a \"break-down,\" were asked if they knew the John Brown song.  \"Oh, yeth, massa; we know ole John Brown.\"  \"Well, give it to us then.\"       \"John Brown's body lies a mold'ring in de clay,      But his soul am a marchin' home!\"  \"Good! give us some more!\"       \"We'll hang Jeff Davis on a sour apple tree,      On Canaan's happy _sho'_!\"  Some of them doubtless still sing the new version, believing that Jeff Davis will yet be hung, on Canaan's happy shore; and so they are all \"bound for the happy land of Canaan!\" It has been stated as an indisputable _fact_, that some of the older negroes having never heard their masters mention the name of a Yankee except with a profane accompaniment, have been praying for years, \"O Lord! bress, we beseech Thee, and speedily bring along de comin' of de _dam_ Yankees!\"  Retracing our steps towards the steamer, we met our friends coming from various directions. Some of them would have passed for returning miners, who, in lieu of rich booty, were heavily laden with relics of stone, brass and iron. While these Yankee relic-hunters failed in getting away with old Fort Sumter itself, they successfully carried off two six-hundred pound shots from the great English Blakely gun, (sent over to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23846"],["title","The Flag Replaced on Sumter (#3)"],["body"," rebels by friends in England.) They afterwards presented these to the New York and Long Island Historical Societies, as enduring evidences of British neutrality during our war.  [Illustration: Ruins of Circular Church. St. Michael's Church. Ruins of Institute Hall.  CHARLESTON IN RUINS.]  My mementoes included _several hundred dollars worth_, so to speak, of Confederate currency; a tile from the floor of the State Bank of South Carolina, and a Book of Common Prayer picked up among the rubbish in St. Michael's Episcopal Church. The floor of the edifice was covered with the shattered glass from the windows. A large shell had ploughed its way directly through the tower, fragments passing through the rear wall of the church, demolishing the pulpit, and even \"breaking the commandments\" inscribed on tablets attached to the wall. But the iron messenger kindly spared the precepts most needed in Charleston, \"Thou shalt not kill!\" and \"Thou shalt not steal!\"  We climbed to the top of the tower of this ancient structure, whose chimes had been removed to be recast into rebel cannon. I have since heard that a new set of chimes now ring out the glad notes of Freedom.  Near by, on the right, were the ruins of Institute Hall, where the Ordinance of Secession was passed, December 20th, 1860, by more than five hundred majority. On the left, the ruins of Circular Church, where the first secession sermon was preached.  But the hour for the grand ceremonial at Sumter had now almost arrived. Hastily embarking on the transport \"Golden Gate,\" the brilliant pageant in the harbor opened before us. As far as the eye could reach, its waters were thickly crowded with shipping, gaily decked from bow-sprit to yard-arm and top-mast, \"with flags and streamers gay, in honor of the gala-day!\" While on every ship and transport, in every available place, were assembled the expectant multitude.  A steamer in the advance suddenly attracted our attention, decked with banners and crowded with the boys in blue. Can it be? Yes, it is our old Rhode Island steamer \"Canonicus.\" Summoned at the opening of the war from the peaceful waters of Narragansett bay, she had rendered efficient service as a government transport, and now at its close had been honorably chosen to lead the grand procession in the peaceful advance to Fort Sumter. Presently the signal was given, the drums were beaten, the trumpets sounded, and immediately the \"Canonicus\" led the proud procession, followed by a long line of steamers and transports which gracefully rounded into line. Prominent among them was the \"Planter,\" commanded by Robert Small, a freedman, who shouted his orders from the top of the paddle-box, while all around him, and below, in every nook and corner, were crowded the happy contrabands of South Carolina, of all ages and sizes, presenting in their variety of costumes a most novel and fantastic picture.  It was a proud day for them and for Robert Small, who, a few months before, almost unaided and alone, had captured the \"Planter\" from the armed State of South Carolina, safely passed the rebel batteries, and delivered her a prize to our blockaders. He received from the government $4,500, one-half the value of the steamer, with a commission of $1,800 as her commander. He afterwards purchased his old master's house and furniture, which set him up as immensely rich among his people, who declared him to be \"de dun smartest cullud man in Souf Curlina!\"  As the long procession of steamers and transports passed the fleet at anchor, manned and decked most gallantly, there was a scene of indescribable enthusiasm; guns were booming, bands playing triumphal marches, bells ringing and whistles sounding, while everybody was shouting and cheering at the highest pitch of patriotic exultation. This continued unabated till we reached the landing of Fort Sumter. Disembarking we passed between two files of soldiers, black men on the right, and white men on the left, rivalling each other in soldierly bearing. Ascending a flight of fifty steps we reached the parapet of the fort, where we found the Rhode Island boys of Company B, Third Artillery, Lieutenant J.E. Burroughs commanding, in charge of six pieces of artillery. Captain J.M. Barker and his men, of Company D, were on duty on Morris Island; and our comrade, Charles H. Williams, with a detachment of Company B, were on Sullivan's Island, in charge of Fort Moultrie and Battery Bee. As I stood there on the parapet of Sumter, and looked out over the battered and crumbled fortress, I realized how it had become, even in ruins, well nigh impregnable. The upper, or barbette walls, had fallen on the outside, and lay packed solidly against the lower walls, choking the entrances to the shattered casemates; numberless great guns, whose thunder had long been the voice of battle, lay dismounted and half buried in the sand, while the immense volume of shot and shell which had been hurled against the fort had served only to solidify and strengthen the entire mass. The fort was further protected from a scaling party by _cheveaux de frise_ of pointed pickets, while along the base of the wall, near the water line, was a barrier of interlaced wire fence, invisible at the distance of a few feet, and which effectively resisted the advance of our naval forces on the night of September 8, 1863.  In the interior of the fort, packed tier above tier against the walls, were layers of tall wicker baskets filled with sand. In the centre stood the new flag-staff, nearly one hundred and fifty feet high, while here and there, at considerable intervals, were piled pyramids of solid shot.  But the grim aspect of war had been somewhat softened by the floral decorations, which, I was informed, were the combined taste of six Union ladies of Charleston. Near the flag-staff, a graceful arched canopy had been erected, draped with the American flag, and handsomely trimmed with evergreens and myrtle. On the stage beside the speakers' stand, was a golden eagle, resting upon a shield of the national colors, and holding in his beak a wreath of flowers and evergreen.  Descending to the interior of the fort, we passed from the foot of the wall-steps to the platform through a double file of navy boys, in trimmest holiday attire. Here were now assembled the great audience of five thousand soldiers, sailors and citizens, and we joined them in the stirring song of \"Victory at Last,\" composed for the occasion by William B. Bradbury, who was present and led the singing. Then followed the old battle song:       \"Yes, we'll rally round the flag, boys, rally once again,        Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom.\"  The formal exercises were opened with prayer by the Rev. Matthias Harris, Chaplain United States Army, a venerable man, who had made the prayer at the raising of the flag on Fort Sumter, in December, 1860, when Major Anderson removed his command from Fort Moultrie. It was a brief but touching invocation for the blessing of God upon the flag of the nation, and upon the great occasion. The Rev. R.S. Storrs, D.D., of Brooklyn, N.Y., then read with the audience, alternately, the one hundred and twenty-sixth, forty-seventh, ninety-eighth, and a part of the twentieth Psalms.  Major Anderson's dispatch to the Government, April 18, 1861, on steamship \"Baltic,\" off Sandy Hook, announcing the fall of Fort Sumter, was then read by Brigadier-General E.D. Townshend, Assistant Adjutant-General United States Army.  Then came the crowning event of the day, the \"raising and planting upon the ruins of Fort Sumter of the SAME United States flag which floated over the battlements of the fort during the rebel assault, April 14, 1861, by Brevet Major-General Robert Anderson, United States Army.\"  Promptly upon the reading of the dispatch, Sergeant Hart (who had gallantly replaced the flag after it had been shot away in the first assault) stepped forward with the Fort Sumter mail-bag in his hand. As he quietly drew forth from its long seclusion the _same_ old flag of '61, a wild shout went up, \"prolonged and loud.\" It was quickly attached to the halyards by three sailors from the fleet, who were in the first fight, and crowned with a wreath of evergreen, set with clusters of rosebuds and orange blossoms.  All was now ready, and the hour, the moment, for which the nation had so long earnestly struggled and patiently waited, had come at last!       \"Though the mills of God grind slowly,        Yet they grind exceeding small;      Though with patience He stands waiting,        With exactness grinds He all!\"  [Illustration: ROBERT ANDERSON.]  Who of us can ever forget that memorable hour, or the deep and silent expectation of the great assembly, as General Robert Anderson, the hero of the day, stepped forward, and with uncovered head and a voice trembling with emotion, said:       \"I am here, my friends, my fellow-citizens and      fellow-soldiers, to perform an act of duty to my country,      dear to my heart, and which all of you will appreciate and      feel. Had I observed the wishes of my heart, it should have      been done in silence; but in accordance with the request of      the Honorable Secretary of War, I make a few remarks, as by      his order, after four long, long years of war, I restore      to its proper place this dear flag, which floated here      during peace, before the first act of this cruel rebellion.      [Taking the halyards in his hands, he said:] I thank God      that I have lived to see this day, and to be here, to      perform this, perhaps the last act of my life, of duty to my      country. My heart is filled with gratitude to that God who      has so signally blessed us, who has given us blessings      beyond measure. May all the nations bless and praise the      name of the Lord, and all the world proclaim, 'Glory to God      in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.'\"  \"Amen! amen!\" the multitude responded. Then the old veteran grasped the halyards with"]]]
