He drew up his horse abruptly, and contemplated the grim aperture.  “So they came into Tanglefoot down the road, and went out of the Cove by this tunnel?”  “Yessir!” she piped. What had befallen her voice? what appalled eerie squeak was this! She cleared her throat timorously. “They couldn’t hev done it later in the fall season. Tanglefoot Creek gits ter runnin’ with the fust rains.”  “An’ Tolhurst knew that too! He must have had a guide--a guide that knows the Cove like I know the palm of my hand! Well, I’ll catch him yet, sometime. I’ll hang him! I’ll hang him--if I have to grow a tree a-pur-pose.”  What strange influence had betided the landscape? Around and around circled the great stationary mountains anchored in the foundations of the earth. It was a long moment before they were still again--perhaps, indeed, it was the necessity of guarding her balance on the fiery steed, a new cause of apprehension, that paradoxically steadied Ethelinda’s nerves. Ackert had dismounted, throwing the reins over his arm. He had caught sight of the hoof marks along the moist sandy spaces of the channel, mute witness in point of number, and a guaranty of the truth of her story. A sudden glitter arrested his eyes. He stooped and picked up a broken belt-buckle with the significant initials U.S. yet showing upon it.  “I’ll hang that guide yet,” he muttered, his eyes dark with angry conviction, his face lowering with fury. “I’ll hang him--I won’t expect to prove it p’int blank. Jes’ let me git a mite o’ suspicion, an’ I’ll guarantee the slipknot!”  She could never understand her motive, her choice of the moment.  “Cap’n Ackert,” she trembled forth. There was so much significance in her tone that, standing at her side, he looked up in sudden expectation. “I tole ye the truth whenst I say I _seen_ no guide”--he made a gesture of impatience; he had no time for twice-told tales--“kase--kase the guide war--war--myself.”  The clear twilight fell full on his amazed, upturned face and the storm of fury it concentrated.  “What did you do it fur?” he thundered, “you limb o’ perdition!”  “Jes’ ter help him some. He--he--he--would hev been capshured.”  He would indeed! The guerilla was very terrible to look upon as his brow corrugated, and his upturned eyes, with the light of the sky within them, flashed ominously.  “You little she-devil!” he cried, and then speech seemed to fail him.  She had begun to shiver and shed tears and emit little gusts of quaking sobs.  “Oh, I be so feared----” she whimpered.  “But--but--you mustn’t hang--_nobody else_ on s’picion!”  There was a vague change in the expression of his face. He still stood beside the saddle, with the reins over his arm, while the horse threw his head almost to the ground and again tossed it aloft in his impatient weariness of the delay.  “An’ now you are captured yourself,” he said, sternly. “You are accountable fur your actions.”  She burst into a paroxysm of sobs. “I never went ter tell! I meant ter keep the secret! The folks in the Cove dun’no’ nuthin’. But--oh, ye _mustn’t_ s’picion nobody else--ye _mustn’t_ hang nobody else!”  Once more that indescribable change upon his face.  “You showed him the way to this pass yourself? Tell the truth!”  “He war ridin’ his horse-critter--‘tain’t ez fast, nor fine, nor fat ez yourn.”  He stroked the glossy mane with a sort of mechanical pride.  “And so he went plumb through the cave?”  “An’ all the troop--they kindled pine-knots fur torches.”  He glanced about him at the convenient growths.  “And they came out all safe in Greenbrier!” He winced. How the lost opportunity hurt him!  “Yessir. In Greenbrier Cove.”  “Did he pay you in gold?” sneered Ackert. “Or in greenbacks? Or mebbe in Cornfed money?”  “I wouldn’t hev his gold.” She drew herself up proudly, though the tears were still coursing down her cheeks. “So he gin me a present--a whole passel o’ coffee in my milk-piggin.” Then to complete a candid confession she detailed the disposition she had made of this rare and precious luxury at the rebel smallpox camp.  His eyes seemed to dilate as they gazed up at her. “Jesus Gawd!” he exclaimed, with uncouth profanity. But the phrase was unfamiliar to her, and she caught at it with a meaning all her own.  “That’s jes’ it! Folks in gineral don’t think o’ _them_, ‘cept ter git out o’ thar way; an’ nobody keers fur _them_, but kase Jesus is Gawd He makes _somebody_ remember them wunst in a while! An’ they did seem passable glad.”  A vague sweet fragrance was on the vesperal air; some subtle distillation of asters or jewel-weed or “mountain-snow,” and the leafage of crimson sumac and purple sweet-gum and yellow hickory and the late ripening frost-grapes--all in the culmination of autumnal perfection; more than one star gleamed whitely palpitant in a sky that was yet blue and roseate with a reminiscence of sunset; a restful sentiment, a brief truce stilled the guerilla’s tempestuous pulse as he continued to stand beside his horse’s head while the girl waited, seated on the saddle blanket.  Suddenly he spoke to an unexpected intent. “Ye took a power o’ risk in goin’ nigh that Confederate pest-camp--an’ yit ye’re fur the Union an’ saved a squadron from capture!” he upbraided the inconsistency in a soft incidental drawl.  “Yes, I be fur the Union,” she trembled forth the dread avowal. “But somehows I can’t keep from holpin’ any I kin. They war rebs--an’ it war Yankee coffee--an’ I dun’no’--I jes’ dun’no’----”  As she hesitated he looked long at her with that untranslated gaze. Then he fell ponderingly silent.  Perhaps the revelation of the sanctities of a sweet humanity for a holy sake, blessing and blessed, had illumined his path, had lifted his eyes, had wrought a change in his moral atmosphere spiritually suffusive, potent, revivifying, complete. “She is as good as the saints in the Bible--an’ plumb beautiful besides,” he muttered beneath his fierce mustachios.  Once more he gazed wonderingly at her.  “I expect to do some courtin’ in this kentry when the war is over,” the guerilla said, soberly, reaching down to readjust the reins. “I haven’t got time now. Will _you_ be waiting fur me here in Tanglefoot Cove--if I promise not to hang you fur your misdeeds right off now?” He glanced up with a sudden arch jocularity.  She burst out laughing gleefuly in the tumult of her joyous reassurance, as she laid her tremulous fingers in his big gauntlet when he insisted that they should shake hands as on a solemn compact. Forthwith he mounted again, and the great charger galloped back, carrying double, in the red afterglow of the sunset, to the waiting group before the flaring doors of the forge.  The fine flower of romance had blossomed incongruously in that eager heart in those fierce moments of the bitterness of defeat. Life suddenly had a new meaning, a fair and fragrant promise, and often and again he looked over his shoulder at the receding scene when the trumpets sang “to horse,” and in the light of the moon the guerilla rode out of Tanglefoot Cove.  But Ethelinda saw him never again. All the storms of fate overwhelmed the Confederacy with many a rootless hope and many a plan and pride. In lieu of the materialization of the stalwart ambition of distinction that had come to dominate his life, responsive to the discovery of his peculiar and inherent gifts, his destiny was chronicled in scarce a line of the printed details of a day freighted with the monstrous disaster of a great battle; in common with others of the “missing” his bones were picked by the vultures till shoved into a trench, where a monument rises to-day to commemorate an event and not a commander. Nevertheless, for many years the flare of the first red leaves in the cleft among the pines on the eastern slope of Tanglefoot Cove brought to Ethelinda’s mind the gay flutter of the guidon, and in certain sonorous blasts of the mountain wind she could hear martial echoes of the trumpets of the guerilla."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23555"],["title","The Lost Guidon (#0)"],["body","LOST GUIDON  By Charles Egbert Craddock  1911   Night came early. It might well seem that day had fled affrighted. The heavy masses of clouds, glooming low, which had gathered thicker and thicker, as if crowding to witness the catastrophe, had finally shaken asunder in the concussions of the air at the discharges of artillery, and now the direful rain, always sequence of the shock of battle, was steadily falling, falling, on the stricken field. Many a soldier who might have survived his wounds would succumb to exposure to the elements during the night, debarred the tardy succor that must needs await his turn. One of the surgeons at their hasty work at the field hospital, under the shelter of the cliffs on the slope, paused to note the presage of doom and death, and to draw a long breath before he adjusted himself anew to the grim duties of the scalpel in his hand. His face was set and haggard, less with a realization of the significance of the scene--for he was used to its recurrence--than simply with a physical reflection of horror, as if it were glassed in a mirror. A phenomenon that had earlier caught his attention in the landscape appealed again to his notice, perhaps because the symptom was not in his line.  “Looks like a case of dementia,” he observed to the senior surgeon, standing near at hand.  The superior officer adjusted his field-glass. “Looks like 'Death on the White Horse'!” he responded.  Down the highway, at a slow pace, rode a cavalryman wearing a gray uniform, with a sergeant's chevrons, and mounted on a steed good in his day, but whose day was gone. A great clot of blood had gathered on his broad white chest, where a bayonet had thrust him deep. Despite his exhaustion, he moved forward at the urgency of his rider's heel and hand. The soldier held a long, heavy staff planted on one stirrup, from the top of which drooped in the dull air the once gay guidon, battle-rent and sodden with rain, and as he went he shouted at intervals, “Dovinger's Bangers! Rally on the guidon!” Now and again his strident boyish voice varied the appeal, “Hyar's yer Dov-inger's Rangers! Bally, boys! Rally on the reserve!”  Indeed, despite his stalwart, tall, broad-shouldered frame, he was scarcely more than a boy. His bare head had flaxen curls like a child's; his pallid, though sunburned face was broad and soft and beardless; his large blue eyes were languid and spiritless, though now and then as he turned an intent gaze over the field they flared anew with hope, as if he expected to see rise up from that desolate expanse, from among the stiffening carcasses of horses and the stark corpses of the troopers, that gallant squadron wont to follow, so dashing and debonair, wherever the guidons might mark the way. But there was naught astir save the darkness slipping down by slow degrees--and perchance under its cloak, already stealthily afoot, the ghoulish robbers of the dead that haunt the track of battle. They were the human forerunners of the vulture breed, with even a keener scent for prey, for as yet the feathered carrion-seekers held aloof; two or three only were descried from the field hospital, perched on the boughs of a dead tree near the river, presently joined by another, its splendid sustained flight impeded somewhat by the rain, battling with its big, strong wings against the downpour of the torrents and the heavy air.  And still through all echoed the cry, “Rally on the guidon! Dovinger's Rangers! Rally on the reserve!”  The bridge that crossed the river, which was running full and foaming, had been burnt; but a span, charred and broken, still swung from the central pier. Over toward the dun-tinted west a house was blazing, fired by some stray bomb, perhaps, or by official design, to hinder the enemy from utilizing the shelter, and its red rage of destruction bepainted the clouds that hung so low above the chimneys and dormer-windows. To the east, the woods on the steeps had been shelled, and a myriad boughs and boles riven and rent, lay in fantastic confusion. Through the mournful chaos the wind had begun to sweep; it sounded in unison with the battle clamors, and shrieked and wailed and roared as it surged adown the defiles. Now and then there came on the blast the fusillade of dropping shots from the south, where the skirmish line of one faction engaged the rear-guard of the other, or the pickets fell within rifle-range. Once the sullen, melancholy boom of distant cannon shook the clouds, and then was still, and ever and again sounded that tireless cry, “Dovinger's Rangers. Hyar's yer guidon! Rally, boys! Rally on the guidon! Rally on the reserve!”  The senior surgeon, as the road wound near, stepped down toward it when the horseman, still holding himself proudly erect, passed by. “Sergeant,” he hailed the guidon, “where is Captain Dovinger?”  The hand mechanically went to the boy's forehead in the usual military salute. “Killed, sir.”  “Where are the other officers of the squadron--the junior captain, the lieutenants?”  “Killed, sir.”  “What has become of the troopers?”  “Killed, sir, in the last charge.”  There was a pause. Then Dr. Trent broke forth: “Are you a fool, boy? If your command is annihilated, why do you keep up this commotion?”  The young fellow looked blank for a moment. Then, as if he had not reasoned on the catastrophe: “I thought at first they monght be scattered--some of 'em. But ef--ef--they _war_ dead, but could once _see_ the guidon, sure 't would call 'em to life. They _couldn't_ be so dead but they would rally to the guidon! Guide right!” he shouted suddenly. “Dovinger's Rangers! Rally on the guidon, boys! Rally on the reserve!”  It was a time that hardened men's hearts. The young soldier had no physical hurt that might appeal to the professional sympathies of the senior surgeon, and he turned away with a half laugh. “Let him go along! He can't rally Dovinger's Rangers this side of the river Styx, it seems.”  But an old chaplain who had been hovering about the field hospital, whispering a word here and there to stimulate the fortitude of the wounded and solace the fears of the dying, recognized moral symptoms alien to any diagnosis of which the senior surgeon was capable. The latter did not deplore the diversion of interest, for the old man's presence was not highly esteemed by the hospital corps at this scene of hasty and terrible work, although, having taken a course in medicine in early life, he was permitted to aid in certain ways. But the surgeons were wont to declare that the men began to bleat at the very sight of the chaplain. So gentle, so sympathetic, so paternal, was he that they made the more of their wretched woes, seeing them so deeply deplored. The senior surgeon, moreover, was not an ardent religionist. “This is no time for a revival, Mr. Whitmel,” he would insist. “Jack, there, never spoke the name of God in his life, except to swear by it. He is too late for prayers, and if _I_ can't pull him through, he is a goner!” But the chaplain was fond of quoting:       “Between the stirrup and the ground      He mercy sought and mercy found----”  and sometimes the scene was irreverently called a “love feast” when some hard-riding, hard-swearing, hard-fighting, unthinking sinner went joyfully out of this world from the fatherly arms of the chaplain into the paternal embrace of an eternal and merciful Father, as the man of God firmly believed.  He stood now, staring after the guidon borne through the rain and the mist, flaunting red as the last leaves of autumn against the dun-tinted dusk, that the dead might view the gallant and honored pennant and rise again to its leading!  No one followed but the tall, thin figure of the gaunt old chaplain, unless indeed the trooping shadows that kept him company had mysteriously roused at the stirring summons. Lanterns were now visible, dimly flickering in one quarter where the fighting had been furious and the slain lay six deep on the ground. Their aspirations, their valor, their patriotism, had all exhaled--volatile essences, these incomparable values!--and now their bodies, weighted with death, cumbered the earth. They must be hurried out of sight, out of remembrance soon, and the burial parties were urged to diligence at the trenches where these cast-off semblances were to lie undistinguished together. And still the reflection of the burning house reddened the gloomy west, and still the cry, “Rally on the guidon! Dovinger's Rangers!” smote the thick air.  Suddenly it was silent. The white horse that had been visible in the flare from the flaming house, now and again flung athwart the landscape, no longer loomed in the vista of the shadowy road. He had given way at last, sinking down with that martial figure still in the saddle, and, with no struggle save a mere galvanic shiver, passing away from the scene of his faithful devoirs.  Fatigue, agitation, anguish, his agonized obsession of the possibility of rallying the squadron, had served to prostrate the soldier's physical powers of resistance. He could not constrain his muscles to rise from the recumbent position against the carcass. He started up, then sank back, and in another moment triumphant nature conquered, and he was asleep--a dull, dreamless sleep of absolute exhaustion, that perchance rescued his reason as well as saved his life.  The old chaplain was a man of infinite prejudice, steeped in all the infirmities and fantasies of dogma; a lover of harmony, and essentially an apostle of peace. Nevertheless, it would not have been physically safe to call him a Jesuit. But indeed he scarcely hesitated; he stepped over the great inert bulk of the dead horse, unclenched the muscular grasp of the soldier, as if it had been a baby's clasp, slipped the staff, technically the lance, of the guidon from its socket, and stood with it in his own hand, looking suspiciously to and fro to descry if perchance he were observed. The coast clear, he turned to the wall of rock beside the"]]]
