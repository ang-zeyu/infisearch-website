'Do you think I carry horses in my pocket?'  \"'What were you doing here, then?'  \"'This fellow's head had slipped from its pillow, and when I tried to put it back he seized me and yelled that I was murdering him! I saw no horse under the saddle.'  \"'Wait here a little,' said Tip-Top. 'Hold this thief till I return.'  \"He went to the stable, woke the thief's accomplice, who by this time was really asleep, and told him his companion had been captured. 'If I can find the horse and hide it our friend will be safe, for nothing can be proved on him.'  \"The man was so frightened that he told Tip-Top where he had arranged to meet the thief the next day. Then Tip-Top returned to the Mayor and his brother, who still held the thief, and took them to the house where the horse had been stabled.  \"When the horse had been found and restored to its owner the Mayor said to Tip-Top that he would not only reward him handsomely but grant any request he might make.  \"'Then, your honor,' replied Tip-Top, 'give this man his liberty.'  \"'Why?' asked the Mayor, much astonished.  \"'Because, your honor, he is my brother.'  \"The thief was as much astonished as the Mayor at this turn in his affairs, but he had no difficulty in recognizing Tip-Top as his younger brother.  \"'He certainly is a man of talent,' said the Mayor, 'and it is a pity that he should be executed.'  \"Then the thief fell on his knees and begged the Mayor to pardon him, promising him to live and die an honest man. And he kept his promise. He engaged in business, and, aided by Tip-Top's advice and influence, made a large fortune.\"  \"What became of the Talking-Saddle?\" asked Buster John.  \"Well,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger, \"Tip-Top hung the saddle in his front porch, as you have seen farmers do. He thought a great deal of it.\"  [Illustration: THE MAYOR PARDONING THE THIEF]  \"I've read something about the great thief,\" remarked Buster John. \"But the story didn't end that way. The thief escaped every time.\"  \"Oh, well, you know how some people are,\" exclaimed Mrs. Meadows. \"They want everything to happen just so; even a thief must be a big man if he's in a story; but I don't believe anybody ever stole anything yet without getting into trouble about it.\"  \"Who is that crying?\" Mr. Rabbit suddenly exclaimed.  \"I hear no crying,\" said Mrs. Meadows.  \"I certainly thought I heard crying,\" persisted Mr. Rabbit.  \"It is Chickamy Crany Crow and Tickle-My-Toes singing. Listen!\"  Sure enough the queer-looking boy and the queer-looking girl were singing a song. One sang one line and the other the next line, and this made the song somewhat comical. The words were something like these:--   CHICKAMY CRANY CROW.              Oh sing it slow,             This song of woe,     Of the girl who went to wash her toe!             Her name was Chick--             (Oh run here quick--             The word's so thick)--     Chickamy--Chickamy Crany Crow!              Chickamy what? and Chickamy which?             She went to the well and fell in the ditch;             What o'clock, old Witch?              The clock struck one             And bowed to the sun;     But the sun was fast asleep you know;             And the moon was quick,             With her oldtime trick--             To hide from Chick--     Chickamy--Chickamy Crany Crow!              Chickamy what? and Chickamy which?             She went to the well and fell in the ditch;             What o'clock, old Witch?              Oh, sad to tell!             She went to the well--     The time was as close to eve as to dawn--             To Chickamy Chick,             So supple and slick,             The clock said \"Tick!\"     But when she came back her chicken was gone!              Oh, whatamy, whichamy, chickamy, oh!             Moonery, oonery, tickamy Toe!             Wellery, tellery, gittery go!             Witchery, itchery, knitchery know.  [Illustration: CHICKAMY CRANY CROW AND TICKLE-MY-TOES]  \"What kinder gwines on is dat?\" exclaimed Drusilla, whose mind had never been quite easy since she walked through the dry water in the spring without getting drowned. \"We all better be makin' our way to'rds home. Time we git dar--ef we ever is ter git dar--it'll be dark good. Den what yo' ma gwine to say? She gwine ter talk wid de flat er her han'--dat what she gwine ter talk wid. Come on!\"  \"Can't you be quiet?\" cried Buster John. \"It's nothing but a song.\"  \"Oh, you kin stay, an' I'll stay wid you,\" said Drusilla; \"but when Mistiss git you in de wash-room, don't you come sayin' dat I wouldn't fetch you home.\"  \"I want to see everything,\" said Buster John.  \"I done seed much ez I want ter see,\" replied Drusilla, \"an' now I want ter live ter tell it.\"  Before Buster John could say anything more, everything suddenly grew a little darker, and in the middle of the sky--or what ought to have been the sky, but which was the enlarged bottom of the spring--there was a huge shadow. The children looked at it in silence.     VII.  THE LADDER OF LIONS.   The shadow that seemed to fall over everything caused Buster John and Sweetest Susan and Drusilla to run to the door. It was not a very dark shadow, but it was dark enough to attract their attention and excite their alarm. They were not yet used to their surroundings, for, although a great many things they saw and heard were familiar to them, they could not forget that they had come through the water in the spring. They could not forget that Mr. Thimblefinger was the smallest grown person they had ever seen,--even if he were a grown person,--nor could they forget that they had never seen a rabbit so wonderfully large as Mr. Rabbit. Drusilla expressed the feelings of all when she remarked that she felt \"skittish.\" They were ready to take alarm at anything that might happen. Therefore they ran to the door to see what the shadow meant. Finally they looked up at the sky, or what seemed to be the sky, and there they saw, covering a large part of it, the vague outline of a huge jug. The shadow wobbled about and wavered, and ripples of light and shadow played about it and ran down to the horizon on all sides.  An astronomer, seeing these fantastic wobblings and waverings of light and shadow in our firmament, would straightway send a letter or a cable dispatch to the newspapers, declaring that an unheard-of convulsion was shaking the depths of celestial space. And, indeed, it was all very puzzling, even to the children, but Drusilla, who had less imagination than any of the rest, accounted for it all by one bold stroke of common sense.  \"Shuh! 'T ain't nothin' 't all!\" she exclaimed. \"Dey done got froo wid dinner at home, an' ol' Aunt 'Cindy done put de buttermilk-jug back in de spring.\"  Sweetest Susan caught her breath with a gasp, and laughed hysterically. She had been very much alarmed.  \"I expect that's what it is,\" said Buster John, but there was some doubt in his tone. He turned to Mr. Thimblefinger, who had followed them. \"What time is it, please?\"  Mr. Thimblefinger drew his watch from his pocket with as much dignity as he could assume, and held his head gravely on one side. \"It is now--let me see--_ahem!_--it is now precisely thirteen minutes and eleven seconds after one o'clock.\"  \"Is that the jug in the spring?\" asked Sweetest Susan, pointing to the huge black shadow that was now wobbling and wavering more slowly.  Mr. Thimblefinger shaded his eyes with his hand and examined the shadow critically. \"Yes, that is the jug--the light hurts my eyes--yes, certainly, that is the jug.\"  Presently a volume of white vapor shot out from the shadow. It was larger than the largest comet, and almost as brilliant.  \"What is that?\" asked Sweetest Susan.  Mr. Thimblefinger felt almost as thoughtful as a sure-enough man of science.  \"That,\" said he, \"is an emanation--an exhalation, you might say--that we frequently witness in our atmosphere.\"  \"A which?\" asked Buster John.  \"Well,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger, clearing his throat, \"it's--er--an emanation.\"  \"Huh!\" cried Drusilla, \"'t ain't no kind er nation. It's des de milk leakin' out'n dat jug. I done tol' Aunt 'Cindy 'bout dat leakin' jug.\"  Mr. Rabbit and Mrs. Meadows had come out of the house in time to hear this, and they laughed heartily. In fact, they all laughed except Mr. Thimblefinger and Drusilla.  \"It happens every day,\" said Mrs. Meadows. \"We never notice it. I suppose if it happened up there where you children live, everybody would make a great to-do? I'm glad I don't live there where there's so much fussing and guessing going on. I know how it is. Something happens that doesn't happen every day, and then somebody'll guess one way and somebody another way, and the first thing you know there's a great rumpus over nothing. I'm truly glad I came away from there in time to get out of the worst of it. You children had better take a notion and stay here with us.\"  \"Oh, no,\" cried Sweetest Susan. \"Mamma and papa would want to see us.\"  \"That's so,\" said Mrs. Meadows. \"Well, I just came out here to tell you not to get too near the Green Moss Swamp beyond the hill yonder. There's an old Spring Lizard over there that might want to shake hands with you with his tail. Besides it's not healthy around there; it is too damp.\"  \"Oh, we are not going anywhere until we start home,\" Sweetest Susan remarked.  \"How large is the Spring Lizard?\" inquired Buster John.  \"He's a heap too big for you to manage,\" replied Mrs. Meadows. \"I don't know that he'd hurt you, but he's slept in the mud over there until he's so fat he can't wallow scarcely. He might roll over on you and hurt you some.\"  \"Are there any lions over"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23871"],["title","A Little Union Scout (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: A LITTLE UNION SCOUT By JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS]  [Illustration: I drank in the melody with a new sense of its wild and melancholy beauty (_Page 56_)]     A LITTLE UNION SCOUT    By  JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS  AUTHOR OF GABRIEL TOLLIVER, THE MAKING OF A STATESMAN AND WALLY WANDEROON    _Illustrated by George Gibbs_   NEW YORK McCLURE, PHILLIPS & CO.

She had a craze for the antique, and the older things were the more precious they were in her eyes. Among other things she found an old scrap-book that her mother and I thought was safe under lock and key. She sat in a sunny place and read it page by page, and, when she had finished, her curiosity was aroused. The clippings in the old scrap-book were all about the adventures of a Union scout whose name was said to be Captain Frank Leroy. The newspaper clippings that had been preserved were queerly inconsistent. The Northern and Western papers praised the scout very highly, and some of them said that if there were more such men in the army the cause of the Union would progress more rapidly; whereas the Southern papers, though paying a high tribute to the dash and courage of the scout, were highly abusive. He was \"one of Lincoln's hirelings\" and as villanous as he was bold.  The girl graduate at once jumped to the conclusion that there was a story behind the old scrap-book, else why should it be preserved by her father, who had been a Confederate soldier? This idea no sooner took shape than she became insistently inquisitive. As for her father, the very sight of the scrap-book awoke the echoes of a hundred experiences--long and dangerous rides in the lonely night, battles, sharp skirmishes and bitter sufferings.  The story, such as it was, took shape in my mind, and I am afraid that the young girl had small difficulty in persuading me to tell it. Memory brought before me the smiling features of Harry Herndon, my life-long friend and comrade, the handsome face of Jack Bledsoe, one of our college mates from Missouri, and the beautiful countenance of his sister, Katherine Bledsoe. These and a hundred other faces came crowding from the past, and the story was told almost before I knew it.  When Harry Herndon and I went to the wars we were somewhat belated. The excitement of '61 found us at college, where we had orders to remain until we had finished the course, and the orders came from one whom we had never dared to disobey--Harry's grandmother. And then, when we were ready to go, she cut in ahead of our plans and sent us to the West with letters to General Dabney Maury, whom she had known when he was a boy and later when he was a young officer in the regular army.  We were not ill-equipped for two raw youngsters; we had Whistling Jim, the negro, three fine horses, and more money than I had ever seen before. We went to General Maury and were most courteously received. The Virginia Herndons--Harry belonged to the Maryland branch--were related to him--and he liked the name. We caught the barest glimpse of service at Corinth, and were fortunate enough to be in a few skirmishes, where we distinguished ourselves by firing at nothing whatever.  In the course of a few weeks General Maury was made commander of the Department of the Gulf, with headquarters at Mobile, where we saw service as clerks and accountants. For my part, the life suited me passing well, but Harry Herndon fretted so that we were soon transferred to the command of General Forrest, who was sadly in need of men. As it happened, we had little difficulty in finding our man. We had heard that he was in the neighborhood of Chattanooga, giving his men and horses a much-needed rest; but on the way news came to us that, in spite of his brilliant achievements in the field, he had been deprived of the choicest regiments of his brigade--men whom he had trained and seasoned to war. After this mutilation of his command, he had been ordered to Murfreesborough to recruit and organize a new brigade.  Toward Murfreesborough, therefore, we made our way, falling in with a number of Forrest's men who had been on a brief visit to their homes in Alabama and were now returning to their command. As we shortly discovered, the Union commanders in Tennessee mistook General Forrest's movement to the neighborhood of Chattanooga for a retreat; for, shortly after he moved in that direction, an ambitious Federal officer asked and received permission to enter Northern Alabama with a force large enough to worry the Confederate leader if he could be found. The organization and equipment of this force required a longer time than the Federal commander had counted on, and by the time it was ready to move General Forrest, with the remnant of his command, was on his way to Murfreesborough.  In some way--the sources of his information were as mysterious as his movements--General Forrest learned that a Federal force was making its way toward Northern Alabama, and he did not hesitate to give it his attention. Within a very short time he had followed and overtaken it, passing it on a road that lay parallel to its line of march. Then it was that the Federal commander began to hear rumors and reports all along his route that Forrest was making a rapid retreat before him. It was stated that his men were discontented and that the condition of his horses was something terrible.  One day, along toward evening, the Federal commander went into camp in the neighborhood of a wooded hill that commanded the approach from the south. He felt sure that the next day would witness the rout and capture of the Confederate who had for so long harassed the Federals in Tennessee. As he came to the hill he passed within a few hundred yards of Forrest's men, who were concealed in the woods. The Federals went into camp, while Forrest, leaving a part of his command in the enemy's rear, silently passed around his right flank.  Now, it happened that Harry Herndon and myself, accompanied by Whistling Jim and the companions we had picked up on the way, were coming up from the south. It happened also that we were following the road leading through the valley to the left of the hill on which the opposing forces were stationed. It was very early in the morning, and as we rode along there was not a sound to be heard, save the jingling of our bridles.  The valley had more length than breadth, and was shaped something like a half-moon, the road following the contour of the crescent. We had proceeded not more than a hundred yards along the road within the compass of the valley when a six-pounder broke the silence with a bang, and a shell went hurtling through the valley. It seemed to be so uncomfortably near that I involuntarily ducked my head.  \"Marse Cally Shannon,\" said Whistling Jim, the negro, addressing me, \"what you reckon make dem white folks bang aloose at we-all, when we ain't done a blessed thing? When it come ter dat, we ain't ez much ez speaken ter um, an' here dey come, bangin' aloose at us. An' mo' dan dat, ef dat ar bung-shell had 'a' hit somebody, it'd 'a' fetched sump'n mo' dan blood.\"  Whistling Jim's tone was plaintive, but he seemed no more frightened than Harry was. Following the bang of the gun came the sharp rattle of musketry. We learned afterward that this firing occurred when the advance guard of the Federal commander collided with Forrest's famous escort. We had no idea of the result of the collision, or that there had been a collision. We had paused to make sure of our position and whereabouts. Meanwhile, the little six-pounder was barking away furiously, and presently we heard a strident voice cut the morning air: \"Go and tell Freeman to put his battery right in on that gun. I give you five minutes.\"  \"That's our man!\" cried one of the troopers who had fallen in with us on our journey. Joy shone in his face as he urged his horse forward, and we followed right at his heels. In a moment we saw him leap from his horse and throw the bridle-reins to a trooper who was holding a string of horses. We gave ours to Whistling Jim to hold and ran forward with the man we had been following.  We came right upon General Forrest--I knew him from the newspaper portraits, poor as they were. He was standing with his watch in his hand. He looked us over with a coldly critical eye, but gave us no greeting. He replaced the watch in his pocket and waved his hand to a bugler who was standing expectantly by his side. The clear notes rang out, and instantly there ensued a scene that baffles description. There was a rush forward, and Harry and I were carried with it.  I could hear loud commands, and shouting, and the rattle of carbines, muskets, and pistols made my ears numb--but what happened, or when or where, I could no more tell you than the babe at its mother's breast. I could only catch glimpses of the fighting through the smoke, and though I was as close to General Forrest as any of his men--right by his side, in fact--I could"]]]
