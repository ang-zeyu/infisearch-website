I zank you.\"  \"Do you know why the Statue of Liberty looks so sad, Frenchy?\" a soldier asked. \"Because she's facing Brooklyn.\"  \"Do you know why she's got her arm up?\" another called.  Frenchy was puzzled.  \"She represents the American woman hanging onto a strap in the subway.\"  \"Don't let them jolly you, Frenchy,\" another said.  Frenchy, a little bewildered, laughed good-humoredly as the bantering throng plied him with absurdities.  \"Are you French?\" Tom asked, as some new victim diverted the attention of the boys.  \"Ah, no! I am Americ'.\"  \"But you were born in France?\"  \"Yess--zey call it Zhermany, but it is France! I take ze coat from you. Still it is yours. Am I right? I am born in Alsace. Zat is France!\"  \"Doncher believe him, kiddo!\" said a soldier. \"He was born in Germany. Look on the map.\"  \"He's a German spy, Whitey; look out for him.\"  \"Alsace--ziss is France!\" said Frenchy fervently.  \"_Ziss_ is the United States,\" shouted a soldier derisively.  \"_Ziss_ is Hoboken!\" chimed in another.  \"Vive la Hoboken!\" shrieked a third.  Tom thought he had never laughed so much in all his life.     CHAPTER V  HE MAKES A DISCOVERY AND RECEIVES A SHOCK   Soon after dusk the soldiers were ordered to throw away their \"smokes\" and either go below or lie flat upon the decks. Officers patrolled the rail while others strolled among the boys and reminded the unruly and forgetful not to raise themselves, and soon the big ship, with its crowding khaki-clad cargo, was moving down the stream--on its way to \"can the Kaiser.\" Then even the patrol was discontinued.  A crowded ferryboat paused in its passage to give the great gray transport the right of way, and the throng of commuters upon its deck saw nothing as they looked up but one or two white-jacketed figures moving about.  Tom thought the ship was off, but after fifteen or twenty minutes the throb of the engines ceased and he heard the clank, clank of the anchor winches. A little distant from the ship tiny green, red and white lights appeared and disappeared and were answered by other colored lights from high up in the rigging of the _Montauk_. Other lights appeared in other directions and were answered by still others, changing rapidly. Tom thought that he could distinguish a dark outline below certain of these lights. The whole business seemed weird and mysterious.  In the morning he looked from the rail at a sight which astonished and thrilled him. No sign of land was there to be seen. Steaming abreast of the _Montauk_ and perhaps a couple of hundred yards from her, was a great ship with soldiers crowding at her rail waving caps and shouting, their voices singularly crisp and clear across the waters. Beyond her and still abreast was another great ship, the surging army upon her decks reduced to a brown mass in the distance. And far off on either side of this flotilla of three, and before it and behind it, was a sprightly little destroyer, moving this way and that, like a dog jumping about his master.  Upon the nearest vessel a naval signaler was semaphoring to the _Montauk_--his movements jerky, clean-cut, perfect. Enviously Tom watched him, thinking of his own semaphore work at Temple Camp. He read the message easily; it was something about how many knots the ship could make in a steady run of six hundred miles. The _Montauk_ answered that she could make twenty-eight knots and keep it up for nineteen hours. The other signaler seemed to be relaying this to the transport beyond, which in turn signaled the destroyer on that side. Then there was signaling between the _Montauk_ and her own neighbor destroyer about sailing formation in the danger zone.  It was almost like A B C to Tom, but he remembered Mr. Conne's good advice and resolved not to concern himself with matters outside his own little sphere of duty. But a few days later he made a discovery which turned his thoughts again to Adolf Schmitt's cellar and to spies.  He had piled the captain's breakfast dishes, made his weather memoranda from the barometer for posting in the main saloon, and was dusting the captain's table, when he chanced to notice the framed picture of a ship on the cabin wall. He had seen it before, but now he noticed the tiny name, scarcely decipherable, upon its bow, _Christopher Colon_.  So that was the ship on which somebody or other known to the fugitive, Adolf Schmitt, had thought of sailing in order to carry certain information to Germany. As Tom gazed curiously at this picture he thought of a certain phrase in that strange letter, _\"Sure, I could tend to the other matter too--it's the same idea as a periscope.\"_  Yet Mr. Conne's sensible advice would probably have prevailed and Tom would have put these sinister things out of his thoughts, but meeting one of the steward's boys upon the deck shortly afterward he said, \"There's a picture of a ship, the _Christopher Colon_----\"  \"That's this ship,\" interrupted the steward's boy. \"They don't say much about those things. It's hard to find out anything. Nobody except these navy guys know about how many ships are taken over for transports. But I saw a couple of spoons in the dining saloon with that name on them. And sometimes you can make it out under the fresh paint on the life preservers and things. Uncle Sam's some foxy old guy.\"  Tom was so surprised that he stood stark still and stared as the boy hurried along about his duties. Upon the _Montauk's_ nearest neighbor the naval signalman was semaphoring, and he watched abstractedly. It was something about camouflage maneuvering in the zone. Tom took a certain pride in being able to read it. Far off, beyond the other great ships, a sprightly little destroyer cut a zigzag course, as if practicing. The sky was clear and blue. As Tom watched, a young fellow in a sailor's suit hurried by, working his way among the throng of soldiers. Presently, Frenchy strolled past talking volubly to another soldier, and waving his cigarette gracefully in accompaniment. A naval quartermaster leaned against the rail, chatting with a red-faced man with spectacles--the chief engineer, Tom thought.  Who were Secret Service men and who were not? thought Tom. Who was a spy and who was not? Perhaps some one who brushed past him carried in his pockets (or more likely in the soles of his shoes) the designs of the Liberty Motor. Perhaps some one had the same thought about _him_. What a dreadful thing to be suspected of! A spy!  That puzzling phrase came into his mind again: _Sure, I could tend to the other matter too--it's the same idea as a periscope._ What did that mean? So the _Montauk_ was the _Christopher Colon_....  He was roused out of his abstraction by the fervid, jerky voice of Frenchy, talking about Alsace. Alsace was a part of Germany, whatever Frenchy might say.... Again Tom bethought him of Mr. Conne's very wise advice, and he went to the main saloon and posted the weather prediction.  That same day something happened which shocked him and gave him an unpleasant feeling of loneliness. Mr. Wessel, the steward, died suddenly of heart failure. He was Tom's immediate superior and in a way his friend. He, and he alone, had received Tom's recommendation from Mr. Conne, and knew something of him. He had given Tom that enviable place as captain's boy, and throughout these few days had treated him with a kind of pleasant familiarity.  He stood by as the army chaplain read the simple burial service, while four soldiers held the rough, weighted casket upon the rail; and he saw it go down with a splash and disappear in the mysterious, fathomless ocean. It affected him more than the loss of a life by torpedoing or drowning could have done and left him solemn and thoughtful and with a deep sense of loss.  Just before dark they semaphored over from the _Dorrilton_ that they could spare the second steward for duty on the _Montauk_. Tom mentioned this to one of the deck stewards, and to his surprise and consternation, an officer came to him a little later and asked him how he knew it.  \"I can read semaphoring,\" said Tom. \"I used to be in the Boy Scouts.\"  The officer looked at him sharply and said, \"Well, you'd better learn to keep your mouth shut. This is no place for amateurs and Boy Scouts to practice their games.\"  \"Y-yes, sir,\" said Tom, greatly frightened.  The next morning, when the sea was quieter, they rowed his new boss over in a small boat.     CHAPTER VI  HE HEARS ABOUT ALSACE AND RECEIVES A PRESENT   That was a good lesson for Tom and a practical demonstration of the wisdom of Mr. Conne's advice. Not that he had exactly gone outside his duties to indulge his appetite for adventure, but he had had a good scare which reminded him what a suspicious and particular old gentleman Uncle Sam is in wartime.  The officer, who had thus frightened him and, in Tom's opinion, cast a slur upon the Scouts, made matters worse by scrutinizing him (or so he fancied) whenever they met upon the deck. But that was all there was to it, and the captain's mess boy did his allotted tasks each day, and stood for no end of jollying from the soldiers, who called him \"Whitey\" and \"Eats,\" because he carried the captain's tray back and forth.  This banter he shared with Frenchy, who took it as good-humoredly as Tom himself, when he understood it, and when he didn't Tom explained it to him.  \"Ziss--how you call--_can_ ze Kaiser?\" he would inquire politely.  \"That means putting him in a tin can,\" said Tom.  \"Ze tin can? Ze--how you call--wipe ze floor wiz him?\"  \"They both mean the same thing,\" said Tom. \"They mean beating him--good and thorough--kind of.\"  Frenchy did not seem to understand but he would wave his hands and say with great vehemence, \"Ah, ze Kaiser, he must be defeat! Ze wretch!\"  Frenchy's name was Armande Lateur. He was an American by adoption and though he had spent much time among the people of his own nationality in Canada, he was strong for Uncle Sam with a pleasant, lingering fondness for the region of the \"blue Alsatian "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23663"],["title","Tom Slade on a Transport (#5)"],["body","mountains,\" whence he had come.  It was from Frenchy that Tom learned much which (if he had only known it) was to serve him well in the perilous days to come.  The day before they entered the danger zone the two, secure for a little while from the mirthful artillery fire of the soldiers, had a little chat which Tom was destined long to remember.  They were sitting at dusk in the doorway of the unoccupied guardhouse which ordinarily was the second cabin smoking-room.  \"Alsace-Lorraine is part of Germany,\" said Tom, his heavy manner of talking contrasting strangely with Frenchy's excitability. \"So you were a German citizen before you got to be an American; and your people over there must be German citizens.\"  \"Zey are Zherman _slaves_--yess! Citizens--no! See! When still I am a leetle boy, I must learn ze Zherman. I must go to ze Zherman school. My pappa have to pay fine when hees cheeldren speak ze French. My little seester when she sing ze Marsellaise--she must go t'ree days to ze Zherman zhail!\"  \"You mean to prison?\" Tom asked. \"Just for singing the Marsellaise! Why, the hand-organs play that where I live!\"  \"Ah, yess--Americ'! In Alsace, even before ze war--you sing ze Marsellaise, t'ree days you go to ze zhail. You haf' a book printed in ze French--feefty marks you must pay!\" He waived his cigarette, as if it might have been a deadly sword, and hurled it over the rail.  \"After Germany took Alsace-Lorraine away from France,\" said Tom, unmoved, \"and began treating the French people that way, I should think lots of 'em would have moved to France.\"  \"Many--yess; but some, no. My pappa had a veenyard. Many years ziss veenyard is owned by my people--my anceestors. Even ze village is name for my family--Lateur. You know ze Franco-Prussian War--when Zhermany take Alsace-Lorraine--yess?\"  \"Yes,\" said Tom.  \"My pappa fight for France. Hees arm he lose. When it is over and Alsace is lost, he haf' lost more than hees arm. Hees spirit! Where can he go? Away from ze veenyard? Here he hass lived--always.\"  \"I understand,\" said Tom.  \"Yess,\" said Frenchy with great satisfaction. \"Zat is how eet is--you will understand. My pappa cannot go. Zis is hees _home_. So he stay--stay under ze Zhermans. Ah! For everything, _everything_, we must pay ze tax. Five hundred soldiers, zey keep, _always_--in zis little village--and only seven hundred people. Ziss is ze way. Ugh! Even ze name zey change--Dundgart! Ugh!\"  \"I don't like it as well as Lethure,\" said matter-of-fact Tom.  Frenchy laughed at Tom's pronunciation. \"Zis is how you say--Le-teur. See? I will teach you ze French.\"  \"How did you happen to come to America?\" Tom asked.  \"Ah! I will tell you,\" Frenchy said, as a grim, dangerous look gathered in his eyes. \"You are--how many years, my frien'!\"  \"I'm seventeen,\" said Tom.  \"One cannot tell wiz ze Americans,\" Frenchy explained. \"Zey grow so queeck--so beeg. In Europe, zey haf' nevaire seen anyzing like zis--zis army,\" he added, indicating with a sweeping wave of his hand the groups of lolling, joking soldiers.  \"They make fun of you a lot, don't they?\"  \"Ah, zat I do not mind.\"  \"Maybe that's why they all like you.\"  \"I will tell you,\" said Frenchy, reverting to Tom's previous question. \"I am zhust ze same age as you--sefenteen--when zey throw my seester in ze zhail because she sing ze Marsellaise. Zat I cannot stand! You see?--When ze soldiers--fat Zhermans, ugh! When zey come for her, I strike zis fat one--here--so.\"  \"I'm glad you did,\" said Tom.  \"Hees eye I cut open, _so_. Wiz my fist--zhust boy's fist, but so sharp.\"  \"I don't blame you,\" said Tom.  \"So zen I must flee. Even to be rude to ze Zherman soldier--zis is crime. So I come to Americ'. Zey are looking for me, but I go by night, I sleep in ze haystack--zis I show. (He exhibited a little iron button with nothing whatever upon it.) You see? Zis is--what you call--talisman. Yess?  \"So I come to Epinal across ze border, through ze pass in ze mountains. I am free! I go to my uncle in Canada who is agent to our wines. Zen I come to Chicago, where I haf' other uncle--also agent. Now I go to France wiz ze Americans to take Alsace back. What should I care if they laugh at me? We go to take Alsace back! Alsace!--Listen--I will tell you!      \"Vive la France!     A bas la Prusse!     D'Schwowe mien     Zuem Elsass 'nuess!  See if you can say zis,\" he smiled.  Tom shook his head.  \"I will tell you--see.      \"Long live France!     Down with Prussia!     The Boches must     Get out of Alsace!\"  \"It must make you feel good after all that to go back now and make them give up Alsace,\" said Tom, his stolid nature moved by the young fellow's enthusiasm. \"I'd like it if I'd been with you when you escaped and ran away like that. I like long hikes and adventures and things, anyway. It must be a long time since you saw your people.\"  \"Saw! Even I haf' not _heard_ for t'ree year. Eight years ago I fled away. Even before America is in ze war I haf' no letters. Ze Zhermans tear zem up! Ah, no matter. When it is all over and ze boundary line is back at ze Rhine again--zen I will see zem. My pappa, my moother, my seester Florette----\"  His eyes glistened and he paused.  \"I go wiz Uncle Sam! My seester will sing ze Marsellaise!\"  \"Yes,\" said Tom. \"She can sing it all she wants.\"  \"If zey are not yet killed,\" Frenchy added, looking intently out upon the ocean.  \"I kind of feel that they're not,\" said Tom simply. \"Sometimes I have feelings like that and they usually come out true.\"  Frenchy looked suddenly at him, then embraced him. \"See, I will give you ziss,\" he said, handing Tom the little iron button. \"I haf' two--see? I will tell you about zis,\" he added, drawing close and holding it so that Tom could see. \"It is made from ze cannon in my pappa's regiment. Zis is when Alsace and Lorraine were lost--you see? Zey swear zey would win or die together--and so zey all die--except seventy. So zese men, zey swear zey will stand by each other, forever--zese seventy. You see? Even in poor Alsace--and in Lorraine. So zese, ze haf' make from a piece of ze cannon. You see? If once you can get across ze Zherman lines into Alsace, zis will find you friends and shelter. Ah, but you must be careful. You see? You must watch for zis button and when you see--zen you can show zis. You will know ze person who wears ze button is French--man, woman, peasant, child. Ze Zhermans do not know. Zey are fine spies, fine sneaks! But zis zey do not know. You see?\"  It was as much to please the generous Frenchy as for any other reason (though, to be sure, he was glad to have it) that Tom took the little button and put it in his pocket.  \"Ze iron cross--you know zat?\"  \"I've heard about it,\" said Tom.  \"Zat means murder, savagery, death! Zis little button means friendship, help. Ze Zhermans do not know. You take this for--what you call--lucky piece?\"  \"I'll always keep it,\" said Tom, little dreaming what it would mean to him.  An authoritative voice was heard and they saw the soldiers throwing away their cigars and cigarettes and emptying their pipes against the rail. At the same time the electric light in the converted guard house was extinguished and an officer came along calling something into each of the staterooms along the promenade tier. They were entering the danger zone.     CHAPTER VII  HE BECOMES VERY PROUD, AND ALSO VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED   Tom's talk with Frenchy left him feeling very proud that he was American born. He had that advantage over the Frenchman, he thought, even though Frenchy had escaped through a pass in the Alsatian mountains and made such an adventurous flight.  When Frenchy had spoken of the American soldiers Tom felt especially proud. He was glad that all his people so far as he knew anything about them, were good out-and-out Yankees. Even his poor worthless father had been a great patriot, and played the _Star-Spangled Banner_ on his old accordion when he ought to have been at work.  Then there was poor old one-armed Uncle Job Slade who used to get drunk, but he had told Tom about \"them confounded rebels and traitors\" of Lincoln's time, and when he had died in the Soldiers' Home they had buried him with the Stars and Stripes draped over his coffin.  He was sorry now that he had not mentioned these things when gruff, well-meaning Pete Connigan had spoken disparagingly of the Slades.  He was glad he was not an adopted American like Frenchy, but that all his family had been Americans as far back as he knew. He was proud to \"belong\" to a country that other people wanted to \"join\"--that _he_ had never had to join. And as he stood at the rail when his duties were finished that same night and gazed off across the black, rough ocean, he made up his mind that after this when he heard slurs cast upon his father and his uncle, instead of feeling ashamed he would defend them, and tell of the good things which he knew about them.  He stood there at the rail, quite alone, thinking. The night was very dark and the sea was rough. Not a light was to be seen upon the ship.  It occurred to him that it might be better for him not to stand there with his white steward's jacket on. He recalled how, up at Temple Camp, one could see the white tents very clearly all the way across the lake.  There was no rule about it, apparently, but sometimes, when people forgot to make a good rule, Tom made it for them. So now he went down to his little stateroom (the captain's mess boy had a tiny stateroom to himself) and put on a dark coat.  The second cabin dining saloon and dining room, which were below decks and had no outside ports, were crowded with soldiers, playing cards and checkers, and they did not fail to \"josh\" Whitey as he passed through. Frenchy was there and he waved pleasantly to Tom.  \"Going to get out and walk, Whitey?\" a soldier called. \"I see you've got your street clothes on.\"  \"I thought maybe the white would be too easy to see,\" Tom answered.  \"Wise guy!\" someone commented.
