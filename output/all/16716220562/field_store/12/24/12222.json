Men frequently fight on, though severely wounded, so great is the excitement of battle, and I am cognizant of several instances of men fainting from loss of blood, who did not know they were wounded, until, several minutes afterward, they were brought to a realization of the fact through a peculiar dizzy, sickening feeling. Brigadier-General (then Colonel) Lytle, who commanded a brigade during that battle, it is said, by boys who were near him, after the severe wound he received, fought on several minutes. A field-officer, whose name I have forgotten, being shot from his horse, requested to be lifted back into the saddle, and died shortly afterward. Captain McDougal, of Newark, Ohio, commanding a company in the 3d Ohio, who, with sword upraised, and cheering on his noble boys, received a fatal shot, actually stepped some eight or ten paces before falling. Colonel Loomis, of the celebrated Loomis Battery, who did such service in that engagement, says he saw no dead about him; yet there they lay, within a few feet of his battery. Loomis at one time sighted one of his favorite pieces, taking what he called a \"fair, square, deliberate aim,\" and, sure enough, he knocked over the rebel gun, throwing it some feet in the air; at the sight of which he was so elated that he fairly jumped with delight, and cheer after cheer rang out from the men of his command, and it was not until a whizzing shot from the remaining guns of the rebels' battery warned him that they were not yet conquered, that his boys were again put to work, and eventually quieted their noisy antagonists. At one time, during that fight, the rebels tried to charge up the hill from \"Bottom's farm-house,\" but were repulsed. At that time the 10th and 3d Ohio, aided by the 15th Kentucky Regiment, were holding the eminence; the rebels were protected by a stone wall that skirted the entire meandering creek, giving them, at times, the advantage of an enfilading fire; our boys were partly covered by what was known as \"Bottom's barn.\" Many of our wounded had crawled into this barn for protection, but a rebel shell exploding directly among the hay set the barn on fire, and several of our poor wounded boys perished in the flames.  Colonel Reed, of Delaware, Ohio, was in command at Perryville, some time after the battle, and it is a disgraceful fact that the rebels left their dead unburied. At one spot, in a ravine, they had piled up thirty bodies in one heap, and thrown a lot of cornstalks over them; and on the Springfield road, to the right, as you entered the town of Perryville, a regular line of skirmishers lay dead, each one about ten paces from the other; they had evidently been shot instantly dead, and had fallen in their tracks; and there they laid for four days. One, a fine-looking man, with large, black, bushy whiskers, was within a few yards of the toll-gate keeper's house, (himself and family residing there,) who, apparently, was too lazy to dig a grave for the reception of the rebel's body.  As a matter of course, the first duty is to the wounded, but these people seemed to pay no attention to either dead or wounded. And it was not until a peremptory order from Colonel Reed was issued, that the rebel-sympathizing citizens condescended to go out and bury their Confederate friends; and this was accomplished by digging a deep hole beside the corpse, and the diggers, taking a couple of fence-rails, would pry the body over and let it fall to the bottom: thus these poor, deluded wretches found a receptacle in mother Earth.  Accompanied by Mr. A. Seward, the special correspondent of the Philadelphia _Inquirer_, the day after the fight I visited an improvised hospital in the woods in the rear of the battle-ground. There we found some twenty Secesh, who had strayed from their command, and were playing sick and wounded to anybody who came along. They had guards out watching, and, as I suspected they were playing sharp, I bethought me of trying \"diamond cut diamond;\" so I dismounted, and having on a Kentucky-jeans coat, I ventured a \"HOW-DE, BOYS?\"  They eyed us pretty severely, and ventured the remark that they needed food, and would like some coffee or sugar for the wounded boys. I went inside the log-house, telling them I would send some down; that we were farming close by there; \"Dry-fork\" was the place; we would send them bread. After we had gained their confidence, they wanted to know how they could get out of the State without being captured; said they had not been taken yet, although several of the Yanks had been there; but the \"d--d fools\" thought they were already paroled.  We told them that as soon as they got well we would pilot them safely out. They said they had already been promised citizens' clothing by Mrs. Thompson and some other rebel ladies. They then openly confessed that there was only one of them wounded, and that they had used his bloody rags for arm-bandages and head-bandages only for the brief period when they were visited by _suspicious_-looking persons; but, as we were all right, they had no hesitancy in telling us they were part of Hardee's corps, and were left there by accident when the rebel forces marched.  By a strange _accident_ they were all taken prisoners that afternoon by a dozen Federal prowlers, who kindly took them in out of the wet.   SKEERED! THAT AINT NO NAME FOR IT.  About a mile and a half to the rear of the field of battle there stands, in a large, open field, a solitary log-house containing two rooms. The house is surrounded by a fence inclosing a small patch of ground. The chimney had been partly torn away by a cannon-ball. A shell had struck the roof of the building, ripping open quite a gutter in the rafters. A dead horse lay in the little yard directly in front of the house, actually blocking up the doorway, while shot and shell were scattered in every direction about the field in front and rear of this solitary homestead. I dismounted, determined to see who or what was in the house--    \"Darkness there, and nothing more.\"  A board had been taken from the floor, exhibiting a large hole between two solid beams or logs. An empty bedstead, a wooden cupboard, and three chairs were all the furniture the house contained. Hurrying across the field, we caught up with a long, lank, lean woman. She had two children with her: a little boy about nine, and a girl about four years of age. The woman had a table upon her head. The table, turned upside down, contained a lot of bedding. She had a bucket full of crockery-ware in one hand, and was holding on to the table with the other. The children were loaded down with household furniture of great convenience. As it was growing dark, I inquired the nearest road to Perryville. The woman immediately unloaded her head, and pointing the direction, set one leg on the table, and yelled to the boy--  \"Whoray up, Jeems; you are so slow!\"  \"How far is it, madam?\"  \"O, about a mile and a half. It aint more nor that, no how.\"  \"Who lived in that house?\" said I, pointing to the log-cabin I had just left.  \"I did.\"  \"Were you there during the fight?\"  \"Guess I was.\"  \"Where was your husband?\"  \"He wor dead.\"  \"Was he killed in the battle?\"  \"No; he died with the measles.\"  \"Why didn't you leave when you found there was going to be a fight?\"  \"I did start for to go, but I seed the Yankees comin' thick, and I hurried back t'other way; and jest as I e'enamost got to the brush yonder, I seed the 'Confeds' jest a swarmin' out of the woods. So, seeing I was between two fires, I rund back to the house.\"  \"Wasn't you afraid you'd be killed?\"  \"Guess I was.\"  \"What did you do when they commenced firing?\"  \"I cut a hole in the floor with the ax, and hid between the jists.\"  \"Did they fight long upon your ground?\"  \"It seemed to me like it wor TWO WEEKS.\"  \"You must have been pretty well scared; were you not?\"  \"Humph! _skeered!_ Lor bless you, _skeered! That aint no name for it!_\"   CAMP FUN IN A BURLESQUE LETTER TO A FRIEND.  The other morning I was standing by Billy Briggs, in our tent.  \"Hand me them scabbards, Jimmy,\" said he.  \"Scabbards!\" said I, looking round.  \"Yes; boots, I mean. I wonder if these boots were any relation to that beef we ate yesterday. If they will only prove as tough, they'll last me a long time. I say, Cradle!\" he called out, \"where are you?\"  Cradle was our contraband, with a foot of extraordinary length, and heel to match.  \"What do you call him Cradle for?\" I inquired.  \"What would _you_ call him? If he aint a cradle, what's he got rockers on for?\"  Cradle made his appearance, with a pair of perforated stockings.  \"It's no use,\" said Billy, looking at them. \"Them stockings will do to put on a sore throat, but won't do for feet. It is humiliating for a man like me to be without stockings. A man may be bald-headed, and it's genteel; but to be barefooted, it's ruination. The legs are good, too,\" he added, thoughtfully, \"but the feet are gone. There is something about the heels of stockings and the elbows of stove-pipes, in this world, that is all wrong, Jimmy.\"  A supply of stockings had come that day, and were just being given out. A pair of very large ones fell to Billy's lot. Billy held them up before him.  \"Jimmy,\" said he, \"these are pretty bags to give a little fellow like me. Them stockings was knit for the President, or a young gorilla, certain!\" and he was about to bestow them upon Cradle, when a soldier, in the opposite predicament, made an exchange. \"Them stockings made me think of the prisoner I scared so the other day,\" said Billy.  \"How's that?\" said I.  \"He saw a big pair of red leggings, with feet, hanging up before our tent. He never said a word, till he saw the leggings, and then he asked me what they were for. 'Them!' said I, 'them's General Banks's stockings.' He looked scared. 'He's a big man, is General Banks,' said I, 'but then he ought to be, the way he lives.' 'How?' said he. 'Why,' said I, 'his regular diet is bricks buttered with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23733"],["title","Incidents of the War: Humorous, Pathetic, and Descriptive (#3)"],["body","tar.'\"  The next day Billy got a present of a pair of stockings from a lady; a nice, soft pair, with his initials, in red silk, upon them. He was very happy. \"Jimmy,\" said he, \"just look at 'em,\" and he smoothed them down with his hand--\"marked with my initials, too; 'B,' for my Christian name, and 'W' for my heathen name. How kind! They came just in the right time, too; I've got such a sore heel.\"  Orders came to \"fall in.\" Billy was so overjoyed with his new stockings he didn't keep the line well.  \"Steady, there!\" growled the sergeant; \"keep your place, and don't be moving round like the Boston post-office!\"  We were soon put upon the double-quick. After a few minutes, Billy gave a groan.  \"What is it, Billy?\" said I.  \"It's all up with 'em,\" said he.  I didn't know what he meant, but his face showed something bad had happened. When we broke ranks and got to the tent, he looked the picture of despair--shoes in hand, and his heels shining through his stockings like two crockery door-knobs.  \"Them new stockings of yours is breech-loading, aint they, Billy?\" said an unfeeling volunteer.  \"Better get your name on both ends, so that you can keep 'em together,\" said another.  \"Shoddy stockings,\" said a third.  Billy was silent. I saw his heart was breaking, and I said nothing. We held a council on them, and Billy, not feeling strong-hearted enough for the task, gave them to Cradle to sew up the small holes.  I saw him again before supper; he came to me looking worse than ever, the stockings in his hand.  \"Jimmy,\" said he, \"you know I gave them to Cradle, and told him to sew up the small holes; and what do you think he has done? He's gone and sewed up the heads.\"  \"It's a hard case, Billy; in such cases, tears are almost justifiable.\"     CHAPTER II.       General Nelson -- The General and the Pie-Women -- The      Watchful Sentinel of the 2d Kentucky -- The Wagon-Master of      the 17th Indiana -- Death of General Nelson -- His Funeral      -- Colonel Nick Anderson's Opinion of Nelson.   A great many stories have been told about General Nelson, with whom the writer was upon the most intimate terms. That Nelson was a noble, warm-hearted, companionable man, those even most opposed to his rough manner, at times, will readily admit.  Nelson was strongly attached to the 6th Ohio. From his very first acquaintance he said he fell in love with it, and his feeling was reciprocated, for the 6th was as ardently devoted to him.  At Camp Wickliffe the General was very much annoyed by women coming into his camp, and he had given strict orders that none should be admitted on the following Sunday, as he intended reviewing the division that day. His chagrin and rage can only be imagined by those who knew him, when, upon this veritable occasion, he saw at least thirty women huddled together, on mares, mules, jacks, jennies, and horses. The General rode hastily to Lieutenant Southgate, exclaiming--  \"Captain Southgate, I thought I ordered that no more of those d--d women should come into my camp. What are they doing here?\"  \"I promulgated your order, General,\" replied Captain Southgate.  \"Well, by ----, what are they here for?\" and riding up to the bevy of women in lathed and split bonnets, he inquired, in a ferocious manner, \"What in ---- are all you women doing here?\"  Now, the party was pretty well frightened, but there was one with more daring than the rest, who sidled up to the General, and, with what was intended to be a smile, (but the General said he never saw a more \"sardonic grin\" in his life,) she answered for the party, and said:  \"_Sellin' pies, Gin'ral._\"  \"Selling pies, eh! Selling pies, eh! Let me see 'em; let me see 'em, quick!\"  The woman untied one end of a bolster-slip, and thrust her arm down the sack, and brought forth a specimen of the article, which Nelson seized, and vainly endeavored to break. It was like leather. The General gave it a sudden twist and broke it in two, when out dropped three or four pieces of dried apple.  \"By ----, madam, you call them pies, do you? Pies, eh! Those things are just what are _giving all my boys the colic_! Get out of this camp every one of you! Clear yourselves!\"  The camp was thus cleared of pie-venders, who escaped on the double-quick.  [Illustration: Skeered! That ain't no name for it. See page 18.]  General Nelson was a strict disciplinarian, and frequently tested his pickets by a personal visit. Upon one occasion he rode through a drenching rain to the outposts; it was a dark night, and mud and water were knee-deep in some parts of the road. A portion of the 2d Kentucky was on guard, and as the General rode up he met the stern \"Halt\" of the sentinel, and the usual \"Who comes there?\"  \"General Nelson,\" was the reply.  \"Dismount, General Nelson, and give the countersign,\" was the sentinel's command.  \"Do you know who you are talking to, sir? I tell you I am your General, and you have the impudence to order me to dismount, you scoundrel!\"  \"Dismount, and give the countersign, or I will fire upon you,\" was the stern rejoinder.  And Nelson did dismount, and gave the countersign, and at the same time inquired the sentinel's name, and to what regiment he belonged. The following day the man was sent for, to appear forthwith at head-quarters. The soldier went with great trepidation, anticipating severe treatment from the General for the previous night's conduct. Imagine his surprise when the General invited him in, complimented him highly, in the presence of his officers, and requested, if at any time he required any service from him, to just mention that he was the soldier of the 2d Kentucky who had made him dismount in mud and rain, and give the countersign.  On another occasion he was riding along the road, and was accosted by two waggish members of the 6th Ohio.  \"Hallo! mister,\" said one of the boys, \"won't you take a drink?\"  \"Where are you soldiers going to?\" inquired the General.  \"O, just over here a little bit.\"  \"What regiment do you belong to?\"  \"Sixth Ohio.\"  \"Well, get back to your camp, quick!\"  The boys, although they knew him well, took advantage of the fact that the General displayed no insignia of his rank, and replied:  \"They guessed they'd go down the road a bit, first.\"  \"Come back! come back!\" shouted the General. \"How dare you disobey me? Do you know who I am, you scoundrels?\"  \"No, I don't,\" said one of the boys; and then, looking impudently and inquiringly into his face, said: \"_Why! ain't you the wagon-master of the 17th Indiana?_\"  Nelson thought activity the best cure for \"_ennui_,\" and consequently kept his men busy. One day, calling his officers together, he ordered them to prepare immediately for a regular, old-fashioned day's work; \"for,\" said he, \"there has been so little work done here since the rain set in, that I fear _drilling_ has fallen in the market; but if we succeed in keeping up that article, I am sure _cotton_ must come down.\"  He was exceedingly bitter in his denunciations of the London _Times_ and rebel British sympathizers, remarking to me, one evening, that he was exceedingly anxious this war should speedily end, \"for,\" said he, \"I would like nothing better than to see our people once more united as a nation; and then I want fifty thousand men at my command, so that I could march them to Canada, and go through those provinces like a dose of croton.\"  I was present at the Galt House, in Louisville, when General Nelson was shot by General Davis, and immediately telegraphed the sad news to the daily press of Cincinnati. The following was my dispatch:        General Nelson Shot by General Davis.                                Louisville, _September 29_.       Eds. Times: I just witnessed General Jeff C. Davis shoot      General Nelson. It occurred in the Galt House, in the entry      leading from the office. The wound is thought to be mortal.                                          Alf.        Later.--General Nelson Dead.                                Louisville, _September 29_, 10 A.M.       General Nelson is dead. I will telegraph particulars as soon      as possible.                                          Alf.        THIRD DISPATCH.       Particulars of the Affair.                                Louisville, _September 29_, 11 A.M.       Eds. Times: Jefferson C. Davis, of Indiana, went into the      Galt House, at half-past eight o'clock this morning. He met      General Nelson, and referred to the treatment he had      received at his hands in ordering him to Cincinnati. Nelson      cursed him, and struck Davis in the face several times.      Nelson then retired a few paces, Davis borrowing a pistol      from a friend, who, handing it to him, remarked, \"It is a      Tranter trigger--be careful.\"       I had just that moment been in conversation with the      General.                                          Alf.   The particulars were afterward given in a letter, which is here inserted:                                Louisville, _September 29, 1862_.  The greatest excitement of the day has been in discussing the death of General Nelson, and the causes which led to the terrible _denouement_.  Sauntering out in search of an \"item\"--my custom always in the morning--I happened to be in the Galt House just as the altercation between General Nelson and General Jeff C. Davis was reaching its climax, and of which I telegraphed you within ten minutes after its occurrence. From what I learn, from parties who saw the commencement, it would seem that General Davis felt himself grossly insulted by Nelson's overbearing manner at their former meeting; and seeing him standing talking to Governor Morton, Davis advanced and demanded an explanation, upon which Nelson turned and cursed him, calling him an infamous puppy, and using other violent language unfit for publication. Upon pressing his demand for an explanation, Nelson, who was an immensely powerful and large man, took the back of his hand and deliberately slapped General Davis's face."]]]
