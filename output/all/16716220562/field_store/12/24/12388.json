And where do you live?\"  \"I'm--we,\" Elizabeth's gesture included Olga, \"we are at the camp.\"  \"And how came you mixed up in this business?\" The doctor meant to know all about the affair now. When Elizabeth had told him, he looked at her curiously. \"And so you lugged that heavy child all the way down here?\" he said.  \"Olga wanted to carry her, but the baby wouldn't let her--and she was crying, so----\" Elizabeth's voice trailed off into silence.  The doctor smiled at her again. Then suddenly he inquired in a gruff voice, \"Well now, who's going to pay me for this job--you?\"  \"_O!_\" cried Elizabeth, her eyes suddenly very anxious. \"I--I never thought of that. It was hurting her so--and she's so little--I just thought--thought----\" Again she left her sentence unfinished.  \"What's her name? Who's her father?\" the doctor demanded.  Peggy answered, \"Father's Jim Johnson. I guess mebbe he'll pay you--sometime.\"  The doctor's face changed. He remembered when Jim Johnson's wife died a year before--he remembered the three children now.  \"There's nothing to pay,\" he said kindly, \"only be careful how you pull your little sister around by the arms after this. Some children can stand that sort of handling, but she can't.\"  \"O, thank you!\" Elizabeth's eyes full of gratitude were lifted to the old doctor's face as she spoke. He rose, and looking down at her, laid a kindly hand on her shoulder.  \"That camp's a good place for you. Stay there as long as you can,\" he said. \"But don't lug a three-year-old a mile and a half again. You are hardly strong enough yet for that kind of athletics.\"  They all filed out then, and Elizabeth put little Polly John into the soapbox wagon, kissed the small face, dirty and tear-stained as it was, and stood for a moment looking after the three children as they set off towards Slabtown.  As they went on to the camp, Olga kept glancing at Elizabeth in silent wonder. Was this really the Poor Thing who could not do anything--who would barely answer \"yes\" or \"no\" when any one spoke to her? Olga watched her in puzzled silence.     V  WIND AND WEATHER   Olga, sitting under a big oak, was embroidering her ceremonial dress, and, as usual, Elizabeth sat near, watching her as she worked. Olga did it as she did most things, with taste and skill, but she listened indifferently when Laura Haven, stopping beside her, spoke admiringly of the work.  \"I wouldn't waste time over it if I hadn't promised Miss Grandis to embroider it. She gave us all the stuff, you know,\" Olga explained.  \"It isn't wasting time to make things beautiful,\" Laura replied. \"That is part of our law, you know, to seek beauty, and wherever possible, create it.\" She looked at Elizabeth and added, \"You'll be learning by-and-by to do such work.\"  There was no response from the Poor Thing, only the usual shrinking gesture and eyes down-dropped. Acting on a sudden impulse, Laura spoke again. \"Elizabeth, the cook is short of helpers this morning, and I've volunteered to shell peas. There's a big lot of them to do. I wonder if you would be willing to help me.\"  To her surprise Elizabeth rose at once with a nod. \"Olga will be glad to have her away for a little while,\" Laura was thinking as they went over to the kitchen.  It certainly was a big lot of peas. Forty girls, living and sleeping in the open, develop famous appetites, and the \"telephone\" peas were delicious. But as the two worked, the great pile of pods grew steadily smaller, and finally Laura looked at Elizabeth with a laugh. \"I've been trying my best, but I can't keep up with you,\" she said. \"How do you shell them so fast, Elizabeth?\"  A wee ghost of a smile--the first Laura had ever seen there--fluttered over the girl's face. \"I'm used to this kind of work. You have to do it fast when you're cookin' for eight,\" she explained simply.  \"And you have cooked for eight?\" Laura questioned, and added to herself, \"No wonder you look like a ghost of a girl.\"  Elizabeth nodded. Laura could not induce her to talk, but still she felt that somehow she had penetrated a little way into the shell of silence and reserve. As they went back across the camp, she dropped her arm over Elizabeth's shoulders, and said,  \"You're a splendid helper, Elizabeth. May I call on you the next time I need any one?\"  Another silent nod, and then the girl slipped back into her place beside Olga.  \"Then I will--and thank you,\" Laura returned as she passed on. Olga glanced after her with something odd and inscrutable in her dark eyes, and there was a question in the look with which she searched the face of Elizabeth. But she did not put the question into words.  Afterwards Laura spoke to her friend of the Poor Thing with a new hopefulness, telling how willingly she had helped with the peas.  \"You know I've tried in vain to get her to do other things, but this time she was so quick to respond! I'm almost afraid to hope, but maybe I've had an inspiration. I must try the child again though before I can feel at all sure.\"  She made her second trial the next day, when she sent Bessie Carroll to ask Elizabeth to help her with the dishes. \"It's my day to work in the kitchen,\" Bessie told her, \"and Miss Laura thought you might be willing to help me. Most of the girls, you know, hate the kitchen work. You don't, do you?\"  \"I _like_ to help,\" replied Elizabeth promptly.  \"I like Elizabeth!\" Bessie confided to Laura that night. \"Before, I've tried to get her into things because she seemed so lonesome and 'out of it,' don't you know? But I like her now, she was so willing to help me to-day. I thought she was awfully slow, but she was quick as anybody with the dishes.\"  Then Laura felt sure she had found the key. \"Elizabeth loves to help,\" she told Anne Wentworth.  \"'Love is the joy of service so deep that self is forgotten,'\" she quoted. \"Anne, I believe that that spirit is in the Poor Thing--deep down in the starved little heart of her--while Olga--with Olga it is the other. She 'glorifies work' because 'through work she is free.' She works 'to win, to conquer, to be master.' She works 'for the joy of the working.' That's the difference.\"  Anne nodded gravely. \"I am sure you are right about Olga. It has always seemed to me that to her 'Wohelo means work' and only that.\"  \"And to Elizabeth it means--or will mean--service and that means, underneath--love,\" said Laura, her voice full of deep feeling. \"O Anne, I so _long_ to help that poor child to get some of the beauty and joy of life into her little neglected soul!\"  \"If she has love, she has the best thing in life already,\" Anne reminded. \"The rest will come--in time.\"  A day or two later Laura found another excuse for asking Elizabeth's help, and as before, the response was quick, and again Olga's busy fingers paused as she looked after the two, and quite unconsciously her dark brows came together in a frown. Elizabeth had gone with scarcely a glance at her. A week--two weeks earlier, she would have hung back and refused. Olga shook her head impatiently as she resumed her work, and wondered why she was dissatisfied with Elizabeth for going so willingly. Of course she must do what her Guardian asked. Nevertheless----Olga left it there.  It was an hour before Elizabeth came back, and this time there was in her face something half shy, half exultant, and she did not say a word about what Miss Laura had wanted her for. Olga made a mental note of that, but she was far too proud to make any inquiries.  The next morning after breakfast Elizabeth disappeared again, and this time too it was fully an hour before she returned, and as before she came back with a shining something in her eyes--a something that changed slowly to troubled brooding when Olga did not look at her or speak to her all the rest of the morning.  When the third day it was the same, Olga faced the situation in stony silence. She would not ask why Elizabeth went or where, but she silently resented her going, and Elizabeth, sensitively conscious of her resentment, after that, slipped away each time with a wistful backward glance; and when she returned, there was no shining radiance in her eyes, but only that wistful pleading which Olga coldly ignored. So it went on day after day. Olga always knew where Elizabeth was except for that one hour in the morning, which was never mentioned between them. The other times she was always helping some one--darning stockings for Louise Johnson--Elizabeth knew how to darn stockings--or helping little Bessie Carroll hunt for some of her belongings, which she was always losing, or helping Katie the cook, who declared that nobody in camp could pare potatoes and apples, or peel tomatoes or pick over berries so fast as the Poor Thing. There was not a day now that some one did not call on Elizabeth for something like this, for the girls had found out that she was always willing. She seemed to take it quite as a matter of course that she should be at the service of everybody. But Laura noted the fact that she never asked anybody to help her.  Then came a night when Mrs. Royall detained the girls for a moment after supper in the dining-room.  \"I think we are going to have a heavy storm,\" she said, \"and we must be prepared for it. Put all your belongings under cover where they will be secure from wind and rain. I should advise you to sleep in your gymnasium suits--you will be none too warm in this northeast wind--and have your rubber blankets and overshoes handy. Guardians will examine all tent-pins and ropes and see that everything is secure. No tent-sides up to-night, of course. I shall have a fire here, and lanterns burning all night; so if anything is needed you can come right here. Now remember, girls, there is nothing to be afraid of--and Camp Fire Girls, of course, are never afraid. That is all, but attend to these"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23991"],["title","Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 2 (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

Quarter-sawed oak is the most suitable wood for this handsome piece of mission furniture. The material should be ordered from the mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded. Following is a list of the stock needed:    2 back posts, 2 by 2 by 47-3/4 in.   2 front posts, 2 by 2 by 45-1/2 in.   4 rails, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 50-1/2 in.   2 end rails, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 18-1/2 in.   4 end rails, 3/4 by 4 by 18-1/2 in.   4 pieces for end panel, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 21 in.   2 panels, 3/8 by 12 by 21 in.   1 top board, 3/4 by 17-1/2 by 47-1/4 in.   1 back board, 3/4 by 11-1/2 by 47-1/4 in.   1 shelf board, 3/4 by 2 by 46 in.   2 brackets, 1 by 2 by 7-3/4 in.   4 pieces for doors, 3/4 by 4 by 11 in.   2 panels, 3/8 by 11 by 17-1/2 in.   1 piece for drawer, 3/4 by 8 by 22-1/2 in.   1 piece for drawer, 3/4 by 7-1/2 by 22-1/2 in.   1 piece for drawer, 3/4 by 7 by 22-1/2 in.   2 pieces, 1/2 by 8 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.   2 pieces, 1/2 by 7-1/2 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.   2 pieces, 1/2 by 7 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.   1 piece, 1/2 by 8 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.   1 piece, 1/2 by 7-1/2 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.   1 piece, 1/2 by 7 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.   1 bottom board, 3/4 by 17-1/2 by 47-1/4 in.; soft wood.   2 partitions (several pieces), 3/4 by 20 by 24-3/4 in.   2 front pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 23 in.   2 back pieces. 3/4 by 2 by 23 in.; soft wood.   2 side pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 21-1/2 in.; soft wood.   1 back (several pieces), 3/8 by 25 by 46 in.   1 mirror frame (to suit mirror).   X/  Start to work on the four posts by squaring them up to the proper length in pairs and beveling the tops as shown. Clamp all four pieces on a flat surface with the bottom ends even, then lay out the mortises for the rails and panels on all four pieces at once with a try-square. This insures getting the mortises all the same height. The back posts also have a mortise cut in them at the top for the back board as shown. Lay out the tenons on the ends of the front and back rails in the same manner. Cut them to fit the mortises in the posts, also rabbet the back rails for the backing. Cut tenons on the end rails and rabbet them and the side pieces for the panels.  Lay out the top and bottom boards to the proper size and notch the corners to fit about the posts. These boards are fastened to the 1-1/2-in. square rails with dowels and glue. They can now be glued together and set away to dry. The top board is of oak, and be sure to get the best side up, while the bottom one can be made of soft wood if desired.  The partitions are made of several boards glued together. Be careful to get an oak board on the outer edge. The drawer slides are set into the partitions as shown and are fastened in place with screws from the inside.  The top back board has a tenon on each end that fits into the mortises in the back posts and is rounded at the top as shown. The shelf is also rounded at the ends and is fastened to the back with screws.  A plate glass mirror should be provided for the back. This is fitted to the back board as shown, then the brackets put up at the ends of the mirror frame.  The main parts are now ready to be assembled and glued together. Before applying any glue, see that all the joints fit together perfectly. The end rails and the panels are glued together first and allowed to dry. Be very careful to get the parts clamped together perfectly square and straight, else you will have trouble later on. When these ends are dry slip them on the tenons on the front and back rails which are already fastened to the top and bottom boards.  The back board and the partitions must be in place when this is done. Pin and glue the joints and clamp the whole together square and leave to dry.  The doors are now made by mortising the top and bottom pieces to take the 3/8-in. panel which is glued in place. The drawers are made as shown in the sketch. The front board should be oak, but the remainder can be made of soft wood. The joints are nailed and glued. Suitable hinges for the doors and handles for the drawers should be provided. Antique copper trimmings look very well with this style of furniture and can be secured at most any hardware store.  The back is made of soft wood and is put on in the usual manner. Scrape all surplus glue from about the joints, as stain will not take where there is any glue. Finish smooth with fine sandpaper, then apply the stain you like best. This can be any one of the many mission stains supplied by the trade for this purpose.     OAK STAIN   An easy and at the same time a good way to stain oak in imitation of the fumed effect, is to boil catechu in the proportion of 1/4 lb. to 6 lb. of water, after which cool and strain. Apply this to the wood, and when dry treat with a solution of bichromate of potash in the same proportion as with the catechu. Bichromate of potash alone in water will give a good stain.
