Uncle Ben tried to look delighted when he heard Flaxie was going; but it was not till her valise had been packed and she stood by the window prepared for the journey, that he happened to remember it wasn't a good time to take her to Hilltop, for Milly was gone!  This was a blow! Flaxie winked hard, trying not to cry.  \"That is,\" said Uncle Ben, \"perhaps she is gone. When I left home, a week ago, her mother was talking of sending her to Troy, to her Aunt Sarah's: but I declare I had forgotten all about it till this minute.\"  Mr. Allen was a man of business, and very forgetful, or he could not have made such a blunder as this. And there was Flaxie's new and elegant doll, Christie Gretchen, all packed in cotton, in a box by itself, on purpose to show Cousin Milly.  \"Well, my daughter, you can wait and go another time, that's all,\" said Dr. Papa, oh, so cheerfully, as if it didn't make a bit of difference.  \"Another time!\" That was a little too dreadful. Flaxie felt as if it was more than she could bear, when her bonnet was on and everything ready.  \"Oh no, papa, I don't want to wait till another time. I want to go now.\"  \"Yes, let her go,\" said Uncle Ben.  There wasn't much time to discuss the matter, and Flaxie was so eager that it seemed a pity to disappoint her; so she went.  \"Homesick?\" Why, _she_ shouldn't be homesick! The truth was, she didn't know what the word meant.  When they reached Hilltop, Milly _was_ gone. Aunt Charlotte was looking for Uncle Ben, but when he alighted from the carriage there was a glimmer of blue and gold, and Flaxie Frizzle appeared, borne aloft in his arms. Aunt Charlotte ran to the door very much surprised.  \"Why, you darling,\" said she, greeting her with kisses, \"we didn't expect you just now.\"  \"I know it,\" returned the little guest triumphantly; \"we wanted to surprise you. I knew Milly wasn't here, but I thought I'd come to see the rest of the folks.\"  Johnny and Freddy smiled at this very pleasantly; and little Ken, the very small baby, cooed and sucked his thumb.  \"I don't care a speck if Milly _is_ gone. I've brought a new dolly to show you,\" cried Flaxie, whirling Aunt Charlotte's head around as if it had been a revolving globe, and kissing her under the left ear.  \"And oh, Uncle Ben and I had such a nice time on the cars! We had bread with egg between, and bread with chicken between, and candy and pinnuts. 'Twas splendid!\"  \"Well, we'll have nice times here,\" returned Aunt Charlotte; but her tone was doubtful. She knew how suddenly Flaxie sometimes changed from one mood to another; and what could she do with such a wayward little guest, when Milly was gone?  \"I like Hilltop so much,\" went on Flaxie, pouring out compliments. \"Uncle Ben's so nice, you know; and Johnny, and Freddy, and the baby.\"  Freddy threw back his shoulders. He liked to be called \"nice;\" but Johnny was older, and only laughed.  \"And I can go to the stores if it does rain and go up in the _alleviator_, for I brought my little umbrella.\"  \"You don't need an umbrella in an elevator. And we don't _have_ elevators,\" said Johnny.  Everybody was smiling, for it was plain that Flaxie's head was a little turned. She was thinking of New York city, and had forgotten that Hilltop was only a small village.  She had been here two or three times before, and knew her way all over the house: it was a double-house, with another family in the other part. She remembered Aunt Charlotte's pictures, and vases, and ship-thermometer, and the tidy with a donkey on it drinking from a trough. She had spoiled two of the albums when she was a _little_ girl, and broken ever so much china; so you see she had reason to feel quite at home at Aunt Charlotte's. Ah, but she had never been there before without her mother!  The afternoon did seem rather long, but Aunt Charlotte told funny stories, and after a great while the boys came home from school, and there was a jolly game of romps. Flaxie thought she was very happy.  \"We are doing better with her than I expected,\" said Aunt Charlotte to her husband next morning, when the bright face beamed on them at breakfast. \"I'm so glad you brought her, for I do miss my little Milly.\"  Flaxie, too, missed Milly, but was resolved to be a little woman, and said to Christie Gretchen privately, \"_We_ won't cry.\" After breakfast she spent two hours in the kitchen with patient Nancy, spatting out little ginger cakes, and picking dirt from the cracks of the floor with a pin. Then she danced off to the sitting-room to play with the baby, telling him \"if he'd be goody, he'd grow up a doctor, like my papa.\" She had promised the same thing to every boy baby at Laurel Grove, for doctors were the best people in the world, she thought, and best of all was Dr. Papa.  She was as happy as ever, and singing merrily in the front yard, when the boys came home at noon. The moment she saw them she felt perfectly forlorn, and it suddenly seemed to her as if she couldn't live any longer without Milly. That wasn't the worst of it; she _knew_ she couldn't live any longer without her mother.  It was a terrible feeling that swept all at once over little Flaxie. I wonder if _you_ ever had it? If not, you can't understand it: it was _homesickness_. There is no ache or pain like it in the whole world, and it seemed to tingle all through Flaxie, from her head to her feet. She ran into the sitting-room, ready to scream. \"Oh, auntie, I feel so bad; I feel bad all over!\"  Mrs. Allen did not know what she meant.  \"Not _all_ over,\" said she, looking up pleasantly. \"Isn't there a good spot somewhere, dear? Perhaps there's a wee spot on your little finger that's almost good.\"  But Flaxie could not smile.  \"It's right in here, in my heart, that I feel the worst,\" moaned she; \"'cause I can't see my mamma, and haven't anything to kiss but her picture!\"  Then Aunt Charlotte was full of sympathy, for she knew the dreadful suffering Flaxie spoke of was homesickness. It seemed strange that it should have seized her so suddenly,--but Flaxie was sudden about everything.  \"Why, my precious one,\" said Mrs. Allen, taking the unhappy child in her lap, \"you know Milly is coming home next week, and in one week more Dr. Papa will send for you to go home. Two weeks won't be long.\"  \"Oh, yes'm, oh, very long! And they oughtn't to have lemme come; I'm too yo-u-ng!\"  \"Hullo! Is she sick?\" cried Freddy, bursting into the room with a great clatter.  His mother shook her head at him.  \"I think Flaxie and I will take a ride in the cars to-morrow,\" said she. \"I think we'll go to Chicopee to see Mrs. Adams, who has some gold-fishes, and a parrot, and a canary. How would you like that, Flaxie?\"  \"Wouldn't like it a tall, 'cause _she_ isn't my mamma,\" sobbed the poor little girl. \"And we couldn't go to-morrow, 'cause to-morrow is Sunday.\"  \"Sunday? First _I_ ever heard of it,\" said Freddy. \"To-day is Friday, I suppose you know?\"  \"Oh, Freddy, Freddy, I can't bear that. It's Saturday,\" said Flaxie.  As she spoke, the tears poured down her cheeks in little streams, and she squeezed her eyelids together so tight that Freddy laughed, for he thought the day of the week was a funny thing to cry about.  \"To-day isn't Saturday,\" said he. \"If 'tis, what did I go to school for? Tell me that.\"  \"Oh, it _is_ Saturday, Freddy Allen! Don't I know what day I came here? I came Friday. Didn't I hear Ninny and mamma talk about it, and don't I _know_?\" screamed the wretched child, hopping up and down, then falling, face downward, on the rug. \"Oh, I can't bear it; I _can't_ bear it! There, don't anybody in this town know what day it is! Nobody knows it but me!\"  This was funny enough to Freddy, but very painful to his mother, who knew the deep trouble at the little girl's heart. Of course Flaxie didn't care a bit what day of the week it was; she only felt so very unhappy that she could not endure the slightest contradiction.  Before another word had been spoken, she sprang up and flew out of the room. About two minutes afterward the front door slammed, and Freddy saw her dashing down street with her hat and cloak on, swinging her valise in one hand and her umbrella in the other.  [Illustration: FLAXIE LOOKED BEWILDERED. Page 60.]     CHAPTER IV.  LUCY'S MITTENS.  Aunt Charlotte ran to the door with the baby, calling out:  \"Flaxie, come back! come back!\"  But the little runaway would not even turn her head.  \"Crazy,\" said Freddy, still laughing.  \"I do believe,\" exclaimed his mother, \"that child is going to the depot! Run after her! You and Johnny both run!\"  The boys did their best, but Flaxie was already far ahead, and never once paused till she reached the station, where she nearly ran the baggage-master through the body with her little umbrella.  \"Now look here, my little lady,\" said he, catching her in his arms, \"I ain't used to being punched in this style, like a passenger-ticket; and you'd better stop to explain.\"  \"Oh, don't hold me, don't hold me! I'm going on the cars to my mamma. _Let_ me go to my mamma!\"  \"Why, certainly,\" said the man, winking to Johnny and Freddy, who had reached the platform and stood there panting. \"_To_ be sure! We let little girls go to their mothers. But you didn't think of starting on ahead of the cars, did you?\"  Flaxie looked bewildered.  \"You see the cars haven't come,\" said Johnny, coaxingly. \"You'd better go back with Freddy and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23540"],["title","The Twin Cousins (#4)"],["body","e, and wait awhile.\"  \"No, no, no,\" said Flaxie, brandishing her umbrella. The boys were too anxious to get her away, and she wouldn't trust them.  \"The cars won't be here till two o'clock,\" said the baggage-man. \"Now I'd advise a nice little lady like you to eat your dinner before starting on a journey. Or would you like it any better to have me lock you up in the ladies'-room till two o'clock? But I should think you'd get rather hungry.\"  He held up a big key as he spoke, and Flaxie gazed at it in dismay. Was this the way they treated little girls that wanted to go to see their mothers?  \"Come, Freddy,\" said Johnny, \"let's hurry home, or there won't be any apple-dumpling left. If Flaxie doesn't want to come she needn't, you know.\"  Johnny spoke with such a show of indifference that Flaxie was struck by it. He was ten years old, just the age of her brother Preston, and had had some experience in managing children younger than himself. As he was walking off with Freddy, she trudged after, exclaiming:  \"Well, will you lemme leave my umberella? Will you lemme come back again? Will you, Johnny?\"  \"We'll see what mother says. What makes you come home with us? Why don't you stay with the man and be locked up?\" replied Master Johnny. But he had her fast by the hand, and led her home in triumph.  \"What did make you try to run away?\" asked Freddy, when they were safely in the house.  Flaxie felt rather ashamed by that time, for Aunt Charlotte and Uncle Ben were both looking at her.  \"I read about a little girl that did it,\" said she, dropping her eyes.  \"Well, I'll read to you about a little girl that didn't do it.\"  \"Hush, Freddy,\" said mamma, for Flaxie's lips were quivering, \"we'll have our dinner now, and then I am going to Chicopee to see Mrs. Adams, who has the gold-fishes and parrot and canary. Flaxie may go with me if she likes.\"  Flaxie brightened a little at this, and thought she wouldn't go home to see her mother to-day; she would wait till to-morrow. Still her heart ached now and then just as hard as ever, and when she was riding in the cars that afternoon to Chicopee with her aunt beside her and her second-best dolly in her arms, she did look the picture of woe.  \"Toothache, perhaps,\" thought a woman who entered the car with a baby and two little girls. One of the girls limped along, scowling as if every step hurt her.  \"How do you do, Mrs. Chase?\" said Aunt Charlotte, making room for the mother and baby by taking Flaxie in her lap; then turning over the seat just in front of them for the two little girls. \"I think it will be a good thing for my niece, Flaxie Frizzle, to see your children, Mrs. Chase.\"  Flaxie wondered why it should be a good thing; still she was glad the little girls had come, for she liked to look at them.  Hattie was a bright child of six, just her own age; but the lame girl of ten, what a white face she had! What very light, straw-colored hair! Her manners were odd, Flaxie thought, for as soon as she saw the doll Peppermint Drop, she snatched at her and would have pulled off her blue satin sash if Flaxie had not drawn it away.  \"Lucy, Lucy,\" said Mrs. Chase, \"don't touch the little girl's doll!\"  Then Lucy leaned forward again, and fingered the buttons on Aunt Charlotte's dress, and stroked her fur cloak, with a smile. That was a queer thing for such a large girl to do, but Aunt Charlotte did not seem to mind it, and only said, \"I fancy Lucy wants a lozenge,\" and popped one into her mouth as if she had been a baby. Flaxie stared, and the mother said, with a sad smile:  \"Poor Lucy knows but very little. Aren't you sorry for her?\"  \"Oh dear, why doesn't she?\" said Flaxie, forgetting her own trouble in gazing at the strange little girl, who was now stroking Aunt Charlotte's cloak again, as if she did not hear a word that was said. \"Why doesn't she know but little?\"  \"Because she was very sick a great many years ago, and it hurt her mind.\"  \"Can she talk?\"  \"She only says 'Papa,' 'Mamma,' 'Hattie.' She talks just about as well as the baby does, and they play together half the time.\"  \"Does she go to school?\" asked Flaxie, growing very much interested indeed.  \"To school? Oh no! _she_ couldn't learn anything,\" said Mrs. Chase, sighing.  But Hattie seemed rather proud of having such a strange sister.  \"See that?\" said she, holding up Lucy's right hand.  \"Why, it's littler than mine, and all dried up,\" exclaimed Flaxie Frizzle.  \"Poor dear, she has lost her mittens again,\" said Mrs. Chase, wiping Lucy's mouth. \"I can't afford to keep buying mittens for her, she loses them so.\"  \"Wouldn't it be well to fasten them to her cloak-sleeve by a string?\" asked Mrs. Allen.  Flaxie gazed bewildered at this singular little girl, who could not wipe her own mouth, or talk, or go to school. She had never known of such a little girl before.  \"Too bad about Lucy!\" said she, thoughtfully, to her aunt as they got out at Chicopee, and left the whole Chase family looking after them from the car-window. \"Is Lucy poor?\"  \"Very.\"  \"Where does she live?\"  \"In Hilltop.\"  \"Oh! I didn't s'pose she lived in Hilltop.\"  \"There,\" said Aunt Charlotte, \"now this next house is Mrs. Adams's, where you will see the gold-fishes.\"  But Flaxie did not care just then for the gold-fishes.  \"Auntie, don't you think Lucy ought to have some mittens?\"  She spoke cheerily, as if mittens were the very thing, and the only thing Lucy needed.  \"And, auntie, _I_ can crochet!\"  \"Is it possible?\" said Aunt Charlotte, thinking how many things Flaxie had learned that little Milly knew nothing about. \"How much can you crochet?\"  \"Well, I made a scarf once for my dolly. I _wish_ I could make some mittens for Lucy!\"  \"That's the very thing! I'll buy you some worsteds this afternoon,\" said Aunt Charlotte, as she rang Mrs. Adams's door-bell; and Flaxie \"smiled\" up her face in a minute, exclaiming:  \"Red, auntie, please get 'em red!\"  They had a lovely time with Mrs. Adams's gold-fish, and parrot, and canary; but after all it was the vision of those red mittens that eased the ache at Flaxie's poor little heart.  Auntie was all patience next morning, and her young niece all smiles; and between them the ivory hook and the red worsteds kept moving.  \"Lucy can't say 'thank you,' but her mamma'll be _so_ pleased,\" said Flaxie, her face beaming. She really thought she was making the mittens herself, because she took a stitch now and then.  \"What, working on Sunday?\" said teasing Johnny.  \"Oh, it isn't Sunday, and I _didn't_ come Friday, and I _can_ wait two weeks to see my mamma. You see I didn't know there was a little girl I could make mittens for, or I shouldn't have cried,\" said Flaxie, stopping a moment to kiss the baby.  The mittens were lovely. Aunt Charlotte finished them off at the wrists with a tufted border. Lucy couldn't say \"thank you,\" but her poor mother was delighted, and fastened them to the child's cloak by a string, so they wouldn't be lost.  The moment Milly got home from Troy and had been kissed all around, Flaxie said:  \"Oh, you don't know how I did feel, staying here all alone, Milly. But I made those mittens, and then I felt better.\"  \"What mittens?\" asked Milly, who hadn't untied her bonnet yet, and couldn't know in a minute everything that had happened.  \"Why, Lucy's red mittens; don't you know? I tell you, Milly, what you must do when you don't feel happy: you must make somebody some mittens.\"  This was Flaxie's way of saying \"You must help other people.\" But Milly knew what she meant. Children understand one another when the talking is ever so crooked.  Flaxie had now been at Hilltop more than three weeks, and had become so contented and happy that she was really sorry when Aunt Jane Abbott appeared one morning to take her home.  \"Thank you ever so much,\" said Miss Frizzle, politely; \"but I don't care 'bout going home.\"  \"Indeed!\" said Aunt Jane, smiling. \"And why not?\"  \"'Cause she wants to stay here and go to school with me,\" spoke up Milly, with her cheek close to Flaxie's.  \"But we thought she'd like to see her little brother Phil; he has eight teeth,\" said Aunt Jane.  \"Oh yes'm, I do, I do!\"  \"Now, Flaxie,\" pleaded Milly, looking grieved, \"when you haven't been to my school, and haven't seen my elegant teacher!\"  \"Well, but isn't Philip my brother? And so are Preston and Ninny. I forgot about them.\"  \"And don't you want to see your mother too?\" asked Aunt Jane, with another smile. She had been smiling ever since she came.  \"Oh, yes, my mamma; I want to see her most of anybody in this world--'cept my papa!\"  Milly's head drooped.  \"Oh, but I'm coming back again,\" said Flaxie, kissing her. \"And then I'll go to school. Where's my valise?\"  She was such a restless, impatient little girl that it wasn't best to let her know till the last minute what a beautiful thing had happened at home. But the next morning, when her hat and cloak were on, Aunt Jane told her she had a dear, new little baby sister, three days old!  Flaxie did just what you might expect she would do: clapped her hands and cried for joy.  \"What's her name? Has she any teeth? Has she any curls? Where does she sleep?\"  \"Why, what's the matter now?\" said Uncle Ben, coming in as Flaxie and Milly were whirling around the room in each other's arms.  \"Oh, good-bye, Uncle Ben, good-bye! I don't know what her name is, but there's a little sister at home, and I must go right off in the cars. I _wish_ I had some _seven-legged_ boots! Good-bye, Uncle Ben.\"  She meant _seven-league_ boots, for the cars did seem very slow. And when she got home the baby was so small that she laughed and cried again.  \"Oh, it's the little _bit-of-est_ baby ever I saw!\"  Phil had a grieved lip. He hardly liked the little pink morsel in the nurse's lap; but he was glad to see Flaxie, and stood on his head with delight.  Mamma looked very happy, and so did Dr. Papa. Ninny went singing about the house, and Preston whistled more than ever.  It was all beautiful, only Flaxie wanted to have a \"talk\""]]]
