A hoss like that has him wind an' power to burn--\"  \"You raised horses before the war?\"  Kirby swallowed what must have been the last soggy crumb of hardtack. \"Well, we had a mind to try that. M'pa, he started him a spread down Pecos way. He had him a good stud-quarter hoss--one of Steel Dust's git. Won two or three races, that stud did. Called him Kiowa. Pa made a deal with a Mex mustanger; he got some prime stuff he caught in the Panhandle. One mare, I 'member--she was a natcherel pacer. Yeah, you might say as how we was gittin' a start at a first-rate string. Me an' m' brothers, we was breakin' some right pretty colts...\"  His voice trailed into silence. Drew reined in the black again and asked another question:  \"What happened ... the war?\"  \"What happened? Well, you might say as how Comanches happened. Me, I was trailin' 'long with this Mex mustanger to learn some of his tricks. When I came back, theah jus' warn't nothin'--nothin' a man wants to remember after. Someday I'm gonna hunt me Comanches. Gonna learn me some tricks in this heah war I can use in that business!\" There was no change in his expression. If anything, his drawl was a little softer and lazier, but the deadly promise in it reached Drew as clearly as if the other had burst out with the Rebel Yell.  \"This is it!\" Captain Campbell rode back along their line. It was a larger company; they had gathered in more fugitives this morning and had no stragglers. All they lacked was adequate arms to present a rather formidable source of trouble behind the Union lines. \"We're goin' into the McKeever place. You men--remember, you're prisoners!\"  Very reluctantly those in that unhappy role unbuckled gun belts, passing their side arms over to their \"captors.\" There was a graveled drive branching out of the pike to their right with a grove of trees arching over it, so they rode into a restful green twilight out of the punishing sun.  Fields rippled lushly beyond that border of trees. There was a cleanness, a contentment, a satisfaction about this place which was no part of them or any men who passed so, armed, restless, tearing apart just such peace as enfolded them here. They rode out of urgency when the gravel of that well-raked drive shifted under the hoofs of their mounts.  \"I'm sayin' one thing loud an' clear,\" Kirby announced to those in his immediate vicinity as they neared a big brick house. \"I may be playin' prisoner to you boys, but I ain't settlin' for no prisoner's rations. We all eat full plates in heah, let that be understood from the start.\"  Campbell laughed. \"Noted, Kirby. We'll see that you desperate Rebs get all that's comin' to you.\"  \"Now that, Cap'n, is jus' what I'm afraid of. We git all that's _comin'_--that sounds a right smart better!\"  \"Company ahead, Cap'n!\" The trooper who had suggested this action, indicated a man walking down the drive to meet their cavalcade.  \"That's Mr. McKeever.\" Drew identified their host for Campbell.  But the captain was already moving ahead to meet the older man. He touched fingers to kepi--a neat blue kepi--in a smart salute.  \"Chivers, Captain, Eleventh Ohio, sir. We'd like to make our noon halt here if you'll grant permission.\"  Thomas McKeever beamed. \"No reason not, suh. Take your men over in the orchard, Captain. We can add a little something to your rations. Glad, always glad to entertain our boys.\" His attention wandered to the score of \"prisoners\" in the center of the troop.  \"Prisoners, Captain?\"  \"Some of Morgan's horse thieves.\" Campbell glanced back at the shabby exhibit. \"You've heard the news, of course, sir? We smashed 'em proper over at Cynthiana--\"  \"You did? Now that's good hearin', Captain. It deserves a regular celebration; it surely does. Morgan smashed! Was he taken too? Next time I trust they'll put him in something stronger than that jail you Ohio boys had him in last time; he's a slippery one.\"  \"Haven't heard about that, sir. But his men are pretty well scattered. These aren't going to trouble any one for a while.\"  McKeever nodded. \"I've a stout barn you're welcome to use for a temporary lockup, Captain. Though I must say they don't display much spirit, do they? Look pretty well beat.\"  Drew rubbed his hand across his face, hoping the grime there--a mixture of road dust, sweat, and powder blacking--was an effective disguise. No use recalling the old days for Mr. McKeever. Allowing his shoulders to slump dispiritedly as he was herded by his file guard, he rode sullenly on to the orchard.  They stripped their saddles and allowed the horses freedom for the first time in hours, an act which was against prudence but which McKeever would expect of Union troops. Drew lay full length under the curving limbs of an apple tree, his head pillowed on saddlebags.  \"Now I wonder\"--Kirby dropped down, to sit with his back against the tree trunk--\"why they always say a fella is dog-tired. A dog, he ain't got him much to do 'cept chase around on his own business. Soldier-tired--now that's another matter. How 'bout it, kid? You ready to ride right outta heah an' chase General Grant clean back to Lake Erie?\"  Boyd had stretched out only a hand's length from Drew. There were dark smudges under his closed eyes, hardly to be told from the smears of dirt on his round cheeks, but there. He rolled his head on a hammock of grass and scowled at Kirby.  \"General Grant can--\" he added a remark which surprised Drew into opening his eyes. Kirby shook his head reprovingly.  \"Now that ain't no way for a growin' boy to talk. An' it sits on your tongue as easy as a fly on a mule's ear, too. What kinda company you bin keepin', kid? Rennie, this heah colt ain't got no reason to cram grammar into a remark that way.\"  Drew stretched, folded his arms under his head, and answered, in a voice he tried to make as blighting as possible: \"Thinks it makes him sound like a man, probably. He's findin' out the army ain't quite what he expected.\"  \"You shut up--!\" Boyd might have added something to that, but Drew had moved. He leaned over the youngster, his hand hard and heavy on Boyd's shoulder. And it was plain that, much as he wanted to, the other did not quite dare to move or shake off that grip.  \"I've had about enough,\" Drew said quietly. \"The next town we hit you're goin' to stay there, until someone comes from back home to collect you. Nobody knows you're with us, and you can go back to Oak Hill without any trouble from Union troops.\"  Boyd's eyes blazed. His mouth wasn't shaping a small boy's pout this time; it was an ugly line tight against his teeth.  \"I ain't goin' home! I said you can't make me, 'less you tie me on a horse and keep me tied all the way. And I don't think you can do that, Drew Rennie. I'd like to see you try it; I sure would!\"  \"He's got you on a stand-off, I'd say,\" Kirby remarked. \"My, ain't he the tough one though, horns sticking up an' haired all over! Gentlemen--\" he had glanced over their shoulder and was watching whatever was there--\"company comin'. Mind your manners!\"  Drew looked around. His hand clamped tighter on Boyd, keeping him pinned on his back. If he only had time ... but there was no way of disguising the younger boy. And Thomas McKeever, strolling with Captain Campbell, had already sighted them, stopped short, and now was moving swiftly in their direction.  \"Boyd Barrett!\"  Drew had to release his hold and Boyd sat up, brushing bits of grass from his shirt sleeves even as he returned Mr. McKeever's stare with composure.  \"Yes, suh?\" Boyd was on his feet now, making his manners with the speed of one harboring a guilty conscience.  \"What are you doing with this gang of cutthroats and banditti?\" Mr. McKeever had an excellent voice to deliver such an inquiry; it could rattle the unaware into confusion, and sometimes even into quick confession, as he undoubtedly knew.  \"I'm with General Morgan, Mr. McKeever.\" Boyd did not appear too ruffled.  \"I refuse to believe that even that unprincipled ruffian is robbing cradles to fill up his ranks, depleted as they may be--\"  Boyd reddened. \"General Morgan ain't no ... no unprincipled ruffian!\"  \"Yeah,\" Kirby drawled. As the other two, he had risen to his feet on the approach of the older man. \"Them's pretty harsh words, suh. Cutthroat now--I ain't never slit me a throat in all my born days. What about you, Rennie? You done any fancy work with a bowie lately?\"  Mr. McKeever favored the Texan with a passing frown; then his attention settled on Drew. \"Rennie,\" he repeated, and then said the name again with the emphasis of one making a court identification. \"Drew Rennie!\"  \"Yes, suh.\" As Boyd had done, Drew answered to the indictment of being where he was and who he was.  \"I am most unhappy to see Alexander Mattock's grandson and Meredith Barrett's son in such company. Surely\"--he turned to Captain Campbell--\"these boys are not your regular prisoners--\"  Campbell shook his head gravely. \"Unfortunately, sir, they are indeed troopers with Morgan. And, as such, they are subject to the rules of war governing prisoners--\"  \"That does not prevent my seeing what I can do for both of you,\" their host said quickly. \"At least, Boyd, you are young enough to be released by the authorities. Be sure I shall do all I can to bring that about.\"  As Boyd opened his mouth to protest, Drew spoke quickly:  \"Thank you, suh. I know Cousin Merry will appreciate that.\"  With a last assurance of his intention to help them, Mr. McKeever left. Boyd grinned.  \"He did help me,\" he observed. \"He knows now I'm with Morgan, and nobody can say that's not so!\"  Kirby laughed. \"Reckon that's true, kid. You locked yourself right into the corral along with the rest of us bad men. Look's like you've been outfought this time, Rennie.\"  Drew threw himself back under the tree. So Boyd had won this round--they were still in Kentucky and not too far from Oak Hill.     5  _Bardstown "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23625"],["title","The Magic Pudding (#0)"],["body","MAGIC PUDDING    _Written and Illustrated by_   NORMAN LINDSAY     [Illustration]     DOVER PUBLICATIONS, INC.   Mineola, New York  _Bibliographical Note_  This Dover edition, first published in 2006, is an unabridged republication of the work published by Angus and Robertson, Ltd., Sydney, Australia, in 1918.  _International Standard Book Number: 0-486-45281-6_    Manufactured in the United States of America   Dover Publications, Inc., 31 East 2nd Street, Mineola, N.Y. 11501          *       *       *       *       *   First Slice   [Illustration]  This is a frontways view of Bunyip Bluegum and his Uncle Wattleberry. At a glance you can see what a fine, round, splendid fellow Bunyip Bluegum is, without me telling you. At a second glance you can see that the Uncle is more square than round, and that his face has whiskers on it.  [Illustration]  Looked at sideways you can still see what a splendid fellow Bunyip is, though you can only see one of his Uncle's whiskers.  [Illustration]  Observed from behind, however, you completely lose sight of the whiskers, and so fail to realize how immensely important they are. In fact, these very whiskers were the chief cause of Bunyip's leaving home to see the world, for, as he often said to himself--    'Whiskers alone are bad enough   Attached to faces coarse and rough;   But how much greater their offence is   When stuck on Uncles' countenances.'  [Illustration]  The plain truth was that Bunyip and his Uncle lived in a small house in a tree, and there was no room for the whiskers. What was worse, the whiskers were red, and they blew about in the wind, and Uncle Wattleberry would insist on bringing them to the dinner table with him, where they got in the soup.  Bunyip Bluegum was a tidy bear, and he objected to whisker soup, so he was forced to eat his meals outside, which was awkward, and besides, lizards came and borrowed his soup.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  His Uncle refused to listen to reason on the subject of his whiskers. It was quite useless giving him hints, such as presents of razors, and scissors, and boxes of matches to burn them off. On such occasions he would remark--    'Shaving may add an air that's somewhat brisker,   For dignity, commend me to the whisker.'  Or, when more deeply moved, he would exclaim--    'As noble thoughts the inward being grace,   So noble whiskers dignify the face.'  Prayers and entreaties to remove the whiskers being of no avail, Bunyip decided to leave home without more ado.  The trouble was that he couldn't make up his mind whether to be a Traveller or a Swagman. You can't go about the world being nothing, but if you are a traveller you have to carry a bag, while if you are a swagman you have to carry a swag, and the question is: Which is the heavier?  [Illustration]  At length he decided to put the matter before Egbert Rumpus Bumpus, the poet, and ask his advice. He found Egbert busy writing poems on a slate. He was so busy that he only had time to sing out--    'Don't interrupt the poet, friend,   Until his poem's at an end.'  and went on writing harder than ever. He wrote all down one side of the slate and all up the other, and then remarked--    'As there's no time to finish that,   The time has come to have our chat.   Be quick, my friend, your business state,   Before I take another slate.'  [Illustration]  'The fact is,' said the Bunyip, 'I have decided to see the world, and I cannot make up my mind whether to be a Traveller or a Swagman. Which would you advise?'  Then said the Poet--    'As you've no bags it's plain to see   A traveller you cannot be;   And as a swag you haven't either   You cannot be a swagman neither.   For travellers must carry bags,   And swagmen have to hump their swags     Like bottle-ohs or ragmen.   As you have neither swag nor bag   You must remain a simple wag,     And not a swag- or bagman.'  [Illustration]  'Dear me,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'I never thought of that. What must I do in order to see the world without carrying swags or bags?'  The Poet thought deeply, put on his eyeglass, and said impressively--    'Take my advice, don't carry bags,   For bags are just as bad as swags;     They're never made to measure.   To see the world, your simple trick   Is but to take a walking-stick--     Assume an air of pleasure,   And tell the people near and far   You stroll about because you are     A Gentleman of Leisure.'  [Illustration]  'You have solved the problem,' said Bunyip Bluegum, and, wringing his friend's hand, he ran straight home, took his Uncle's walking-stick, and assuming an air of pleasure, set off to see the world.  He found a great many things to see, such as dandelions, and ants, and traction engines, and bolting horses, and furniture being removed, besides being kept busy raising his hat, and passing the time of day with people on the road, for he was a very well-bred young fellow, polite in his manners, graceful in his attitudes, and able to converse on a great variety of subjects, having read all the best Australian poets.  Unfortunately, in the hurry of leaving home, he had forgotten to provide himself with food, and at lunch time found himself attacked by the pangs of hunger.  'Dear me,' he said, 'I feel quite faint. I had no idea that one's stomach was so important. I have everything I require, except food; but without food everything is rather less than nothing.    'I've got a stick to walk with.   I've got a mind to think with.   I've got a voice to talk with.   I've got an eye to wink with.   I've lots of teeth to eat with,   A brand new hat to bow with,   A pair of fists to beat with,   A rage to have a row with.   No joy it brings     To have indeed   A lot of things     One does not need.   Observe my doleful plight.     For here am I without a crumb     To satisfy a raging tum--   O what an oversight!'  As he was indulging in these melancholy reflexions he came round a bend in the road, and discovered two people in the very act of having lunch. These people were none other than Bill Barnacle, the sailor, and his friend, Sam Sawnoff, the penguin bold.  Bill was a small man with a large hat, a beard half as large as his hat, and feet half as large as his beard. Sam Sawnoff's feet were sitting down and his body was standing up, because his feet were so short and his body so long that he had to do both together. They had a pudding in a basin, and the smell that arose from it was so delightful that Bunyip Bluegum was quite unable to pass on.  [Illustration]  'Excuse me,' he said, raising his hat, 'but am I right in supposing that this is a steak-and-kidney pudding?'  'At present it is,' said Bill Barnacle.  'It smells delightful,' said Bunyip Bluegum.  'It is delightful,' said Bill, eating a large mouthful.  Bunyip Bluegum was too much of a gentleman to invite himself to lunch, but he said carelessly, 'Am I right in supposing that there are onions in this pudding?'  Before Bill could reply, a thick, angry voice came out of the pudding, saying--    'Onions, bunions, corns and crabs,   Whiskers, wheels and hansom cabs,   Beef and bottles, beer and bones,   Give him a feed and end his groans.'  'Albert, Albert,' said Bill to the Puddin', 'where's your manners?'  'Where's yours?' said the Puddin' rudely, 'guzzling away there, and never so much as offering this stranger a slice.'  'There you are,' said Bill. 'There's nothing this Puddin' enjoys more than offering slices of himself to strangers.'  'How very polite of him,' said Bunyip, but the Puddin' replied loudly--    'Politeness be sugared, politeness be hanged,   Politeness be jumbled and tumbled and banged.   It's simply a matter of putting on pace,   Politeness has nothing to do with the case.'  [Illustration]  'Always anxious to be eaten,' said Bill, 'that's this Puddin's mania. Well, to oblige him, I ask you to join us at lunch.'  'Delighted, I'm sure,' said Bunyip, seating himself. 'There's nothing I enjoy more than a good go in at steak-and-kidney pudding in the open air.'  'Well said,' remarked Sam Sawnoff, patting him on the back. 'Hearty eaters are always welcome.'  'You'll enjoy this Puddin',' said Bill, handing him a large slice. 'This is a very rare Puddin'.'  'It's a cut-an'-come-again Puddin',' said Sam.  'It's a Christmas, steak, and apple-dumpling Puddin',' said Bill.  'It's a--Shall I tell him?' he asked, looking at Bill. Bill nodded, and the Penguin leaned across to Bunyip Bluegum and said in a low voice, 'It's a Magic Puddin'.'  'No whispering,' shouted the Puddin' angrily. 'Speak up. Don't strain a Puddin's ears at the meal table.'  'No harm intended, Albert,' said Sam, 'I was merely remarking how well the crops are looking. Call him Albert when addressing him,' he added to Bunyip Bluegum. 'It soothes him.'  'I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Albert,' said Bunyip.  'No soft soap from total strangers,' said the Puddin', rudely.  'Don't take no notice of him, mate,' said Bill. 'That's only his rough and ready way. What this Puddin' requires is politeness and constant eatin'.'  They had a delightful meal, eating as much as possible, for whenever they stopped eating the Puddin' sang out--    'Eat away, chew away, munch and bolt and guzzle,   Never leave the table till you're full up to the muzzle.'  [Illustration]  But at length they had to stop, in spite of these encouraging remarks, and, as they refused to eat any more, the Puddin' got out of his basin, remarking--'If you won't eat any more here's giving you a run for the sake of exercise', and he set off so swiftly on a pair of extremely thin legs that Bill had to run like an antelope to catch him up.  'My word,' said Bill, when the Puddin' was brought back. 'You have to be as smart as paint to keep this Puddin' in order. He's that artful, lawyers couldn't manage him. Put your hat on, Albert, like a little gentleman,' he added, placing the basin on his head. He took the Puddin's hand, Sam took the other, and they all set off along the "]]]
