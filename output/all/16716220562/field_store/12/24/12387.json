Olga's impatient rebuffs--even her angry commands--only made the Poor Thing hang back a little.  When things had gone on so for a week, Laura asked Olga to go with her to the village. She went, but they were no sooner on the road than she began abruptly, \"I know what you want of me, Miss Haven, but it's no use. I can't be bothered with that Poor Thing--she makes me sick--always hanging around and wanting to get her hands on me. I can't stand that sort of thing, and I won't--that's all there is about it. I'll go home first.\"  When Laura answered nothing, Olga glanced at her grave face and went on sulkily, \"Nobody ought to expect me to put up with an everlasting trailer like that girl.\"  Still Laura was silent until Olga flung out, \"You might as well say it. I know what you are thinking of me.\"  \"I wasn't thinking of you, Olga. I was thinking of Elizabeth. If you saw her drowning you'd plunge in and save her without a moment's hesitation.\"  \"Of course I would--but I wouldn't have her hanging on to me like a leech after I'd saved her.\"  \"I suppose you have not realised that in 'hanging on' to you--as you express it--she is simply fighting for her life.\"  \"What do you mean, Miss Haven?\"  \"I mean that Elizabeth is--starving. Not food starvation, but a worse kind. Olga, this is the first time in her life that she has ever spent a day away from home--she told me that--or ever had any one try to make her happy. Is it any wonder that she doesn't know how to _be_ happy or make friends? It seems strange that, from among so many who would gladly be her friends here, she should have chosen you who are not willing to be a friend to any one--strange, and a great pity, it seems. It throws an immense responsibility upon you.\"  \"I don't want any such responsibility. I don't think any of you ought to put it on me,\" Olga flung out sulkily.  \"We are not putting it on you,\" returned Laura gently.  Olga twitched her shoulder with an impatient gesture, and the two walked some distance before she spoke again. Then it was to say, \"What are you asking me to do, anyhow?\"  \"_I_ am not asking you to do anything,\" Laura answered. \"It is for you to ask yourself what you are going to do. I believe it is in your power to make over that poor girl mind and body--I might almost say, soul too. She thinks she can do nothing but household drudgery. She is afraid of everything. When I think of what you could do for her in the next month--Olga, I wonder that you can let such a wonderful opportunity pass you by.\"  They went the rest of the way mostly in silence. When they returned to the camp, Elizabeth was watching for them, but the glance Olga gave her was so repellent that she shrank away, and went off alone to the Lookout. Later Laura tried to interest Elizabeth in the making of a headband of beadwork, but though she evidently liked to handle the bright-coloured beads, she would not try to do the work herself.  \"I can't. I can't do things like that,\" she said with gentle indifference, her eyes wandering off in search of Olga.  The next day, however, Laura came to Anne Wentworth, her eyes shining. \"O Anne, what _do_ you think?\" she cried. \"Olga had Elizabeth in wading this morning. Isn't that fine?\"  \"Fine indeed--for a beginning. It shows what Olga might do with her if she would.\"  \"Yes, for she was so cross with her! I wondered that Elizabeth did not go away and leave her. No other girl in camp would let Olga speak to her as she speaks to that Poor Thing.\"  \"No, the others are not Poor Things, you see--that makes all the difference. But that Olga should take the trouble to make Elizabeth do anything is a big step in advance--for Olga.\"  \"There is splendid material in Olga, Anne--I am sure of it,\" Laura returned.  There was splendid persistence in her, anyhow. She had undertaken to overcome Elizabeth's fear of the water, but it was a harder task than she had imagined. She did make the Poor Thing wade--clinging tightly to Olga's fingers all the time--but further than that she could not lead her. Day after day Elizabeth would stand shivering and trembling in water up to her knees, her cheeks so white and her lips so blue that Olga dared not compel her to go further. Yet day after day Olga made her wade in that far at least; not once would she allow her to omit it.  One day she sat for a long time looking gravely at the Poor Thing, who flushed and paled nervously under that steady silent scrutiny. At last Olga said abruptly, \"What do you like best, Elizabeth?\"  \"Like--best----\" Elizabeth faltered uncertainly.  Olga frowned and repeated her question.  Elizabeth shook her head slowly. \"I--I like Molly. And the other children--a little.\"  \"You mean your brothers and sisters?\"  Elizabeth nodded.  \"Which is Molly?\"  \"The littlest one. She's four, and she's real pretty,\" Elizabeth declared proudly. \"She's prettier than Annie Pearson.\"  \"Yes, but what do you yourself like?\" Olga persisted. \"What would you like to have--pretty dresses, ribbons--what?\"  \"I--I never thought,\" was the vague reply.  Again Olga's brows met in a frown that made the Poor Thing shrink and tremble. She brought out her necklace and tossed it into the other girl's lap.  \"Think that's pretty?\" she asked.  \"O _yes_!\" Elizabeth breathed softly. She did not touch the necklace, but gazed admiringly at the bright-coloured beads as they lay in her lap.  \"You can have one like it if you want,\" Olga told her.  \"O no! Who'd give me one?\"  \"Nobody. But you can get it for yourself. See here--I got all those blue beads by learning about the wild flowers that grow right around here, the weeds and stones and animals and birds. You can get as many in a few days. I got that green one for making a little bit of a basket, that--for making my washstand there out of a soap box--that, for trimming my hat. Every bead on that necklace is there because of some little thing I did or made--all things that you can do too.\"  The Poor Thing shook her head. \"O _no_,\" she stammered in her weak gentle voice, \"I can't do anything. I--I ain't like other girls.\"  \"You can be if you want to,\" Olga flung out at her impatiently. \"Say--what _can_ you do? You can do something.\"  \"No--nothing.\" The Poor Thing's blue eyes filled slowly with big tears, and she looked through them beseechingly at the other. Olga drew a long exasperated breath. She wanted to take hold of the girl's thin shoulders and shake the limpness out of her once for all.  \"What did you do at home?\" she demanded with harsh abruptness.  \"N--nothing,\" Elizabeth answered with a miserable gulp.  \"You did too! Of course you did something,\" Olga flamed. \"You didn't sit and stare at Molly and the others all day the way you stare at me, did you? _What_ did you do, I say?\"  Elizabeth gave her a swift scared glance as she stammered, \"I didn't do anything but cook and sweep and wash and iron and take care of the children--truly I didn't.\"  Olga's face brightened. \"Good heavens--if you aren't the limit!\" she shrugged. Then she sprang up and got pencil and paper. \"What can you cook?\" she demanded, and proceeded to put Elizabeth through a rapid-fire examination on marketing, plain cooking, washing, ironing, sweeping, bed-making, and care of babies. At last she had found some things that even the Poor Thing could do. With flying fingers she scribbled down the girl's answers. Finally she cried excitingly, \"_There!_ See what a goose you were to say you couldn't do anything! Why, there are lots of girls here who couldn't do half these things. Elizabeth Page, listen. You've got twelve orange beads like those,\" she pointed to the necklace--\"already, for a beginning. That's more than I have of that colour. I don't know anything about taking care of babies, nor half what you do about cooking and marketing.\"  Elizabeth stared, her mouth half open, her eyes widened in incredulous wonder. \"But--but,\" she faltered, \"I guess there's some mistake. Just housework and things like that ain't anything to get beads for--are they?\"  \"They are _that_! I tell you Mrs. Royall will give you twelve honours and twelve yellow beads at the next Council Fire, and if you half try you can win some blue and brown and red ones too before that, and you've just _got to do it_. Do you understand?\"  The other nodded, her eyes full of dumb misery. Then she began to whimper, \"I--I--can't ever do things like you and the rest do,\" she moaned.  \"Why not? You can walk, can't you?\"  \"W--walk?\"  \"Yes--_walk_! Didn't hurt you to walk to the village yesterday, did it?\"  \"No--but I couldn't go--alone.\"  \"Who said anything about going alone? You'll walk to Slabtown and back with me to-morrow.\"  \"O, I'd like that--with you,\" said the Poor Thing, brightening.  Olga gave an impatient sniff. Sometimes she almost hated Elizabeth--almost but not quite.  \"You'll go with me to-morrow,\" she declared, \"but next day you'll go with some other girl.\"  Elizabeth shrank into herself, shaking her head.  Olga eyed her sternly. \"Very well--if you won't go with some other girl, you can't go with me to-morrow,\" she declared.  But the next day after breakfast the two set off for Slabtown. Halfway there, Elizabeth suddenly crumpled up and dropped in a limp heap by the roadside.  \"What's the matter?\" Olga demanded, standing over her.  Elizabeth lifted tired eyes. \"I don't know. You walked so--fast,\" she panted.  \"Fast!\" echoed Olga scornfully; but she sat on a stone wall and waited until a little colour had crept back into the other girl's thin cheeks, and went at a slower pace afterwards.  \"There! Do that every day for a week and you'll have one of your red beads,\" was her comment when they were back at camp. \"And now go lie in that hammock.\"  When from the kitchen she brought a glass of milk and some crackers, she found Elizabeth sitting on the ground.  \"Why didn't you get into the hammock as I told you?\" she demanded, and the Poor Thing answered vaguely that she \"thought maybe they wouldn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23987"],["title","The Torch Bearer: A Camp Fire Girls' Story (#7)"],["body","nt\" her to.  Olga poked the milk at her. \"Drink it!\" she ordered, \"and eat those crackers,\" and when Elizabeth had obeyed, added, \"Now get into that hammock and lie there till dinner-time,\" and meekly Elizabeth did so.  When, later in the day, some of the younger girls started a game of blindman's buff, Olga seized Elizabeth's hand. \"Come,\" she said, \"we're going to play too.\"  \"O, I can't! I--I never did,\" cried the Poor Thing, hanging back.  \"I never did either, but I'm going to now and so are you. Come!\" and Elizabeth yielded to the imperative command.  The other girls stared in amazement as the two joined them. It was little Bess Carroll who smiled a welcome as Louise Johnson cried out,  \"Wonders will never cease-_-Olga Priest playing a game!_\"  She spoke to Mary Hastings, who answered hastily, \"Bless her heart--she's doing it just to get that Poor Thing to play. Let's take them right in, girls.\"  The girls were quick to respond. Olga was the next one caught, and when she was blinded she couldn't help catching Elizabeth, who stood still, never thinking of getting out of the way. Elizabeth didn't want the handkerchief tied over her eyes, but she submitted meekly, at a look from Olga. Half a dozen girls flung themselves in her way, and the one on whom her limp grasp fell ignored the fact that Elizabeth could not name her, and gaily held up the handkerchief to be tied over her own eyes in turn. Nobody caught Olga again. She was as quick as a flash and as slippery as an eel. Elizabeth's eyes followed her constantly, and a little glimmer of a smile touched her lips as Olga slipped safely out of reach of one catcher after another.  When she pulled Elizabeth out of the noisy merry circle, Olga glanced at the clock in the dining-room and made a swift calculation. \"Three-quarters of an hour--blindman's buff.\"  \"We've got to play at some game every day, Elizabeth,\" she announced, with grim determination. She hated games, but Elizabeth must win her red beads and the red blood for which they stood. She had undertaken to make something out of this jellyfish of a girl and she did not mean to fail. That was all there was about it. So every day she led forth the reluctant Elizabeth and patiently stood over her while she blundered through a game of basket-ball, hockey, prisoner's base, or whatever the girls were playing. But Elizabeth made small progress. Always she barely stumbled through her part, helped in every way by Olga and often by other girls who helped her for Olga's sake.  It was Mary Hastings who broke out earnestly one day, looking after the two going down the road, \"I say, girls, we're just a lot of selfish pigs to leave that Poor Thing on Olga's hands all the time. It must be misery to her to have Elizabeth hanging on to her as she does--a dead weight.\"  \"Right you are! I should think she'd hate the Poor Thing--I should. I should take her down to the dock some night and drown her,\" said Louise Johnson with her inevitable giggle.  \"I think Olga deserves all the honours there are for the way she endures that--jellyfish,\" said Edith Rue.  \"I never saw any one thaw out the way Olga has lately though. She really deigns to speak amiably now--sometimes,\" Annie Pearson put in with a sniff.  \"She 'deigns' to do anything under the sun that will help that Poor Thing to be a bit like other girls,\" cried Mary. \"Olga is splendid, girls! She makes me ashamed of myself twenty times a day. Do you realise what it means? She is trying to make that Poor Thing _live_. She just exists now. O, we must help her--we must--every single one of us!\"  \"But how, Molly? We're willing enough to help, but we don't know how. Elizabeth turns her back on every one of us except Olga--you know she does.\"  \"I know,\" Mary admitted, \"but if we really try we can find ways to help.\"  When, compelled by Olga's unyielding determination, the Poor Thing had taken a three-mile tramp every day for a week, she began to enjoy it, and did not object when another mile was added. She was always happy when she was with Olga, but at other times--when they were not walking--her content was marred by the consciousness that Olga was not really pleased with her because she could not do so many things that the others wanted her to do--like beadwork and basketwork, and above all, swimming. But Olga was pleased with her when she went willingly on these daily tramps.  The Poor Thing seemed to find something particularly attractive about the Slabtown settlement, and liked better to go in that direction than any other. She would often stop and watch the dirty half-naked babies playing in the bare yards; and as she watched them there would come into her face a look that Olga could not understand--Olga, who had never had a baby sister to love and cuddle.  One day when the two approached the little settlement, they saw half a dozen boys and girls walking along the top of a stone-wall that bordered the road. A baby girl--not yet three--was begging the others to help her up, but they refused.  \"You can't get up here, Polly John--you're too little!\" the boys shouted at her. But evidently Polly John had a will of her own, for she made such an outcry that at last her sister exclaimed, \"We've got to take her up--she'll yell till we do,\" and to the baby she cried, \"Now you hush up, Polly, an' ketch hold o' my hand.\"  The baby held up her hand and with a jerk she was pulled to the top of the wall, but by no means did she \"hush up.\" She writhed and twisted and screamed, but there was a difference now--a note of pain and terror in the shrill cries.  \"What ails her? What's she yellin' for now?\" one boy demanded, and another shouted, \"Take her down, Peggy. You get down with her.\"  \"I won't, either!\" Peggy retorted angrily, but she was sitting on the wall now, holding the baby half impatiently, half anxiously.  \"Look at her arm. What makes her stick it out like that?\" one boy questioned.  The big sister took hold of the small arm, but at her touch the baby's cries redoubled, and a woman put her head out of a window and sharply demanded what they were doing to that child anyhow.  It was then that the Poor Thing suddenly darted across the road and caught the wailing child from the arms of her astonished sister.  \"O, don't touch her arm!\" Elizabeth cried. \"Don't you see? It's hurting her dreadfully. You slipped it out of joint when you pulled her up there.\"  \"I didn't, either! Much you know about it!\" the older girl flashed back, sticking out her tongue. But the fear in her eyes belied her impudence.  \"Where's her mother?\" Elizabeth demanded.  \"She ain't got none,\" chorused all the children.  Several women now came hurrying out to see what was the matter. One of them held out her arms to the child, but she hid her face on Elizabeth's shoulder, and still kept up her frightened wailing.  \"How d'ye know her arm's out o' joint?\" one of the women demanded when Peggy had repeated what Elizabeth had said.  \"I do know because I pulled my little sister's arm out just that way once, lifting her over a crossing. O, I _wish_ I knew how to slip it in again! It wouldn't take a minute if we only knew how. Now we must get her to a doctor--quick. It is hurting her dreadfully, you know--that's why she keeps crying so!\"  \"A doctor! Ain't no doctor nearer'n East Bassett,\" one woman said.  \"East Bassett! Then we must take her there,\" Elizabeth said to Olga, who for once stood by silent and helpless.  \"We can get her there in twenty minutes--maybe fifteen if we walk fast,\" she said.  \"Then\"--Elizabeth questioned the women--\"can any of you take her there?\"  The women exchanged glances. \"It's 'most dinner time--my man will be home,\" said one. The others all had excuses; no one offered to take the child to East Bassett. No one really believed in the necessity. What did this white-faced slip of a girl know about children, anyhow?  \"Then I'll take her myself,\" the Poor Thing declared. \"I guess I can carry her that far.\"  \"An' who'll bring her back?\" demanded the child's sister gloomily.  \"You must come with me and bring her back,\" Elizabeth answered with decision. \"Come quick! I tell you it's hurting her awfully. Don't you see how white she is?\"  Peggy looked at the little face all white and drawn with pain, and surrendered.  \"I'll go,\" she said meekly, and without more words, Elizabeth set off with the child in her arms. Olga followed in silence, and Peggy trailed along in the rear, but as she went she turned and shouted back to one of the boys, \"Jimmy, you come along too with the wagon to bring her home in,\" and presently a freckled-faced boy, with straw-coloured hair, had joined the procession. The wagon he drew was a soapbox fitted with a pair of wheels from a go-cart.  \"Let me carry her, Elizabeth--she's too heavy for you,\" Olga said after a few minutes; but the child clung to Elizabeth, refusing to be transferred, and at the pressure of the little yellow head against her shoulder, Elizabeth smiled.  \"I can carry her,\" she said. \"She's not so very heavy. She makes me think of little Molly.\"  So Elizabeth carried the child all the way, and held her still when they reached East Bassett and by rare good luck found the doctor at home. He was an old man, and over his glasses he looked up with a twinkle of amusement as the party of five trailed into his office. But the next instant he demanded abruptly,  \"What ails that child?\"  \"It's her arm--see?\" Elizabeth said. \"It's out of joint.\"  \"Yes!\" The doctor snapped out the word. Then his hands were on the baby's shoulder, there was a quick skilful twist, a shriek of pain and terror from the baby, and the bone slipped into place.  \"There, that's all right. She's crying now only because she's frightened,\" the doctor said, snapping his fingers at the child. \"How did it happen?\"  Elizabeth explained.  \"Well, I guess you'll know better than to lift a baby by the arm another time,\" the doctor said, with a kindly smile into Elizabeth's tired face. \"Is it your sister?\"  \"No--her"]]]
