CHAPTER V.  THAT HOMELY MISS PIKE.   The nurse did leave the room next day for a minute, and Flaxie ran up to the bed and nestled close to her mother.  \"Now I'll tell you all about it. I wanted to see you so, my heart ached and ached, and once I ran away home.\"  \"You did, darling? I'm glad I didn't know it,\" said mamma, kissing her.  \"I didn't tell anybody--much,\" returned Flaxie. \"I thought 'twasn't polite. And then auntie bought me some red worsteds, and I made some mittens for a sick girl named Lucy, that can't wipe her mouth, or go to school, or talk; and it made me just as happy!\"  \"That was right. Of course it made you happy to forget yourself and help somebody else.\"  \"Yes'm, I know _all about_ that!\" replied Flaxie, with a wise look. She had learned a deep lesson from those mittens.  \"But I don't ever want to go away again,\" said she, dropping a tear on the pillow, \"for there isn't any _you_ and Dr. Papa anywhere else.\"  \"Oh, some time you'll want to.\"  \"No, mamma. When I said I'd go there to school with Milly I didn't know about my baby sister. I ought to stay and take care of her, and never go away any more as long as I live,--not till I die, and go to heaven.\"  But three months passed, and Flaxie had forgotten all this. She was always fond of the baby, whose name was Ethel Gray; but sometimes she thought Ethel needn't cry quite so much, and ought to cut a tooth, and ought to have more hair.                   *       *       *       *       *  The world looked dark to Flaxie, for she was sick that spring, and a long while getting well. It was a queer sort of illness too. First it made her look yellow and then pea-green, and Julia had to sing and smile a great deal in order to keep her at all comfortable.      \"After dandelions, buttercups,       After buttercups, clover;     One blossom follows another one,       Over and over and over!\"  sang Julia one evening, when Flaxie was making ready to take her medicine.  \"Now, Flaxie dear, swallow it like a lady.\"  \"Yes. Dr. Papa knows a great deal, and I shall do just as he says,\" replied the little girl, grasping her cup of rhubarb tightly in one hand, and a glass of cold water in the other.  It was a comfort to see her take her medicine for once without crying, and Preston shouted \"Hurrah!\"  She was pea-green at this time, and oh, so cross! For supper she had had three slices of bread and butter, and cried because she couldn't have the fourth.  \"If the poor little thing wasn't so cross we'd send her to Aunt Charlotte's for a change,\" said Dr. Papa in a low voice to his wife; but Flaxie heard it.  \"Oh, mamma, do lemme go to Aunt Charlotte's, and go to school with Milly; she has such a dear teacher! And Milly's my twin cousin, born just the same month. And I won't be cross if they _don't_ give me enough to eat; and I'll take a whole bushel o' pills!\"  \"Let her go,\" laughed papa; \"the bushel of pills settles it.\"  Flaxie was six and a half years old, and could have gone to Hilltop alone--almost; but as Captain Jones happened to be travelling that way, Dr. Papa thought he would pretend to put her in his charge.  \"Did you ever go in the cars alone, Ninny, with your own valise, and a check in your pocket?\" asked Flaxie in glee, as she rode up to the station; \"and oh, a umbrella, too!\"  \"No, I never did--at your age,\" replied Ninny, who was now a young lady of twelve.  \"You see Uncle Ben will be there to meet me when we get to Hilltop,\" said Miss Frizzle, fluttering her darling umbrella against the captain's spectacles; \"and won't he laugh when he sees me coming all alone, with a check in my pocket?\"  \"Good-bye, curly-head; take care of that umbrella,\" said her father, kissing her pea-green cheek, and hurrying out of the car as the bell rang.  \"Let's see, where is Hilltop, and how will you know when you get there?\" asked the captain, before Flaxie had time to cry.  \"Oh, it's where Uncle Ben lives and Aunt Charlotte,\" replied the little traveller, who had a vague idea that the house was in the middle of a snow-drift, with roses in the front yard and strawberries behind it. \"Their name is Allen.\"  \"Well, I'm glad you've told me all the particulars,\" said the captain gravely. \"And I shall be easy, for we can't miss it.\"  Flaxie smiled and looked at her check. She felt the whole care of the journey, but it didn't trouble her at all, for the captain would tell her when to stop. She \"'membered\" all about Hilltop just as well as could be, but she didn't _'xactly_ know where it was!  It was a pleasant ride on that beautiful spring day, and the captain would have been very agreeable, only he seemed to have a perfect horror of \"pinnuts,\" the very things Flaxie had dreamed about and expected to eat all the way. He shook his head at the peanut boys, and told her he \"wished they would keep away with their trash!\" If he had only gone into a smoking-car and left her, she might have bought some, for she had her red portemonnaie with her; but then he never thought of leaving her, for he really had no idea she was travelling alone.  She had said Uncle Ben would laugh at meeting her; and so he did. He threw up both hands and cried, \"Bless me! what's all this?\" for it is not every day one sees a little girl of just that color; but he looked sober the next minute.  \"Poor little thing, you've had a hard time.\"  \"Oh no, sir, not very,\" said Flaxie, thinking he meant the journey. \"I like to travel alone.\"  Captain Jones, who was putting the little umbrella into the carriage, laughed, and said he wished he had known that before.  \"Good-bye,\" said he, kissing his hand to her. \"I shall miss you very much, for _I don't_ like to travel alone!\"  Then Flaxie drove off with her uncle in the nice easy carriage, and found Aunt Charlotte and all her cousins delighted to see her, as she had known they would be. She had told the captain they were \"elegant cousins;\" but when Johnny exclaimed, \"Hullo! Miss Frizzle, you look like a pickled lime,\" she blushed a sort of pinkish-green blush, and thought he had grown very disagreeable.  \"Well, I didn't mean anything. I've seen folks look worse'n you do--a good deal,\" added the little fellow, and thought it a handsome apology.  \"I'll tell you who looks worse,\" he broke in again, as they were all seated at supper; \"it's our teacher, Miss Pike. She isn't the same color by a long shot, but she's awful homely.\"  \"Is she? Well, I guess I shan't go to school.\"  \"Johnny ought not to speak in that way of his dear teacher,\" said Aunt Charlotte gravely; \"it is not her fault that she is not pretty; and everybody loves her, for she has a beautiful soul.\"  \"Oh, yes, everybody loves her,\" said Master Freddy; \"but didn't Jemmy Glover send her a mean valentine last winter?      'Old Miss Pike, she's ninety-nine,     Her hair's the color of a ball of twine.'\"  \"If she looks so bad, why don't she let the doctor take care of her?\" asked Flaxie, thoughtfully. \"Dr. Papa gives me medicine three times a day, and I'm going to be real white.\"  \"Oh, Miss Pike isn't sick; she was born so, and medicine wouldn't help her any,\" said Johnny, trying hard not to laugh at his simple little cousin. \"I'll take you to see her to-morrow.\"  Flaxie set her teeth firmly into a cookie, resolving that she would not see such a monster of ugliness, much less go to school to her, not if Johnny should drag her to the schoolhouse by a rope.  After tea she sat on the front doorsteps awhile in Milly's lap. The little friends had a way of sitting in each other's lap, and it was a droll sight, as they were just of a size.  \"Where's Lucy, that I made the mittens for?\" asked Flaxie.  \"Oh, she's at home, but her sister Hatty goes to school.\"  \"Well, I shan't have to make mittens or anything this time, 'cause you're at home, Milly. I like to be with my twin cousin in a twin house,\" said Flaxie, twisting her neck to look at Mrs. Hunter's door-stone. It was just like Aunt Charlotte's, only there were flower-pots on it.  \"Guess what I dreamed last night,\" returned Milly. \"I dreamed you were my sister; and then I woke up and thought how queer it is that God always sends brothers to this house, and not any sisters.\"  \"Why so he does; for Johnny and Freddy are _both_ boys, and so is Ken,\" said Flaxie, struck with a new idea. \"It's real-too-bad!\"  \"But now you've come, and we'll go to school together, and it's just as well,\" said Milly, kissing her pea-green friend in rapture.  \"Oh, I didn't say I'd go to school, Milly Allen.--Why, who's that coming?\"  \"Hush! that's my teacher and her sister.\"  \"Which is the sister?\"  \"The big one.\"  \"Well, she's got the dropsies.\"  \"Oh, no, she hasn't; she teaches the singing in our school.\"  \"But she _has_ got the dropsies, Milly Allen, for a fat woman has 'em where I live, and my papa takes care of her; so don't I know?\"  Milly said no more, for _her_ papa was not a doctor; so what right had she to give an opinion concerning diseases?  The two ladies nodded and smiled in passing. \"Oh, how homely!\" whispered Flaxie, in amazement; \"I mean the other one, not the sister.\"  There was no doubt about it. I really suppose Miss Pike was one of the ugliest women in the whole state. Her eyes were small and half shut; her mouth was large and half open; her nose was enormous, and turned up at the end,--and, to crown the whole, it was red!  Milly, who had always known her, did not mind her looks. Indeed, so little can children judge of the beauty of those they love, that I dare say she might have thought her dear teacher quite handsome if she had not heard everybody speak of her as \"that homely Miss Pike.\"  \"We don't have such looking folks keep school where I live,\" said Flaxie, in scorn.  \"I can't help it if you don't,\" returned Milly, slipping her cousin off her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23540"],["title","The Twin Cousins (#6)"],["body"," with much indignation. \"God made her so, and my mamma says you mustn't notice how anybody looks when they have a beautiful soul.\"  \"Well, you won't get _me_ to go to school, not if you give me five million thousand dollars, Milly Allen!\" said Flaxie; and their loving chat on the doorstep was over for the evening.  Flaxie kept her word, and Milly went off next morning half crying; but little Freddy confided to his mother that _he_ was \"glad Flaxie wouldn't go to school, for the scholars would laugh at her, true as you live.\"  It was rather dull, all alone with Aunt Charlotte and little Ken, who was cutting his teeth and cried a great deal; but Flaxie held out for a whole week. This was fortunate, as it gave time for the greenish color to fade out of her face, and her own natural pink and white to come back again as beautiful as ever.  \"I guess I _will_ go to school with you, Milly, if you want me to so much,\" said she at last one morning, when her cousins had all stopped teasing her. \"I just despise Miss Pike, but I like the one that has the dropsies, and I want to hear her sing.\"  Such a hugging and kissing followed this remark that Flaxie felt as if she had said a very fine thing, and started off with Milly, carrying her head very high.  The schoolhouse was white, with green blinds, and stood on the bank of the river, shaded by trees. Burdocks, milkweed, rushes, dandelions, and buttercups, were sprinkled around, while close down by the river was a narrow strip of clay bank, very nice to cut into with penknives,--as you would think if you had seen the pretty images some of the children made and spread out on boards in the sun.  Inside the schoolhouse it was nice and cool, with a large entry and recitation-room, and flowers on the desks and tables. The teacher, \"that homely Miss Pike,\" moved about softly, and spoke in low, sweet tones, smiling, and showing even white teeth.  \"I s'pose her soul will fly right out of her when she dies,--and _that_ won't have a red nose,\" thought Flaxie, gazing at her with curiosity mingled with awe.  Somehow there was a happy feeling all over the schoolroom because Miss Pike was in it, and Flaxie's thoughts grew pleasant, she could not have told why. But one thing she did know, she wanted to be a good girl,--not pretty good, but the very best in the world,--that that sweet woman might love her.     CHAPTER VI.  THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT.   \"Well, darling,\" said Aunt Charlotte at noon, \"you said you went to hear the singing, and you look as if you had enjoyed it.\"  \"Oh, the singing isn't as good as Miss Pike; she's just the best woman. Only,\" added Flaxie regretfully, \"I _wish_ I could see her soul, auntie!\"  Mrs. Allen smiled.  \"Wait till you know her better, and then you'll see it shine through her face. There's a good look about her that is better than beauty.\"  After she had once begun, Flaxie would not have missed a day at school for anything. She had never learned so fast before, for she had never had a teacher she loved so well.  \"Oh, auntie,\" said she one day, \"I've seen her soul shine! It shines when she smiles.\"  Milly and Flaxie were the best scholars, so Miss Pike told Aunt Charlotte. But they did not study all the time. Oh, no. Miss Pike understood children, and didn't _expect_ them to study all the time. She often drew pictures on the blackboard for them to copy on the slate, and if they wanted to bring their dinners and play at noon she was perfectly willing; only they were not to scream too loud, or go near the desks, for fear of spilling the ink. She noticed that the little girls were more noisy after Flaxie Frizzle came; but this was not strange, for Flaxie knew a great many games that the Hilltop children had never heard of before.  \"Lesson? Oh, yes. I've got that ole thing,\" she would say sometimes, as she rushed for her hat long before school-time.  \"Spell _ocean_, then,\" said studious Milly, following her with the spelling-book in her hand.  \"_O-s-h-u-n._ There! I'm in a hurry. I want to get to school to play 'Bloody Murder.'\"  That sounded dreadful, but I dare say was not as bad as it seemed. And one day after Flaxie had taught the little folks all the games she could possibly remember, she thought of a new thing to do.  \"See there, Milly,\" said she, pointing to a high pile of boards behind the schoolhouse, under one of the windows. \"A man has gone and put those down there, and now let's make a house of 'em, and live in it!\"  Milly hugged Flaxie, it was such a bright idea. Make a house? Of course they would! They had made cupboards out of shingles and stones, and put clay dishes on the shelves; they had dug ovens all along the bank like swallows' nests; but a real live house, what could be so charming as that?  But when you came to think of it, it wasn't what you might call easy work, for the boards were very heavy; and with all their tugging the little girls could only drag them a little way across the ground.  \"Well, Johnny will help,\" said Milly, puffing for breath. \"And perhaps Freddy will too.\"  She knew they couldn't coax Freddy quite as well as they could Johnny. The little girls never once thought of asking who owned the boards, but I will tell you; it was Esquire Blake, and he was intending to use them to repair his office, which stood not far from the schoolhouse.  \"'Twill be our ownty-doanty house, and nobody must come into it but us,\" said Flaxie, gazing with satisfaction at the clean boards.  \"The boys must come,\" suggested Milly.  \"Well, yes, I s'pose they'll have to, if they help make it.\"  \"And Ada Blake.\"  \"You always want Ada Blake to go everywhere,\" pouted Flaxie. \"We can invite her for company, if you want to, but 'twill be _our_ house.\"  Johnny thought it all nonsense, but consented to undertake the business. He drove four stakes into the ground, near a beautiful maple-tree, and then nailed boards on the stakes all around, making a pen about three feet high. Everybody looked on deeply interested. After that he and Freddy went fishing. The little girls felt very impatient.  \"Oh dear,\" said Milly, \"it doesn't look much like a house. You'd think it was for pigs to live in.\"  Next day it rained; but the day after, as Johnny could get no peace of his life, he nailed on more boards, till the pen was so high you couldn't see over it, unless you stood on tiptoe. That was high enough; but where was the roof?  \"Oh, bother, what do you want of a roof? Hold up your umbrella.\"  \"Next house I make I'll make it myself!\" cried Flaxie, stamping her foot.  That amused good-natured Johnny, and he called together some of the boys, to help him put on a sloping roof. Then he sawed a door in the side next the river; and when all was done the building looked so much like a \"truly house\" that the little girls screamed for joy, and Johnny felt rather proud of his work.  \"Tell you what,\" said he, looking around at the boys, \"this is the house that Jack built. Now let's saw a hole in the roof and put in a stove-pipe.\"  Ah, Johnny! Johnny! it was thoughtless enough to use those boards without leave; but to put in a stove-pipe was downright madness!  The girls were charmed, and wanted a fireplace immediately. Why not? That wasn't much to make, and they made it themselves with the loose pieces of brick they picked out of the old hearth in the recitation-room.  Squire Blake knew nothing of this; neither did the teacher. The new and elegant building was located on the bank behind the schoolhouse, and as the windows that way let in the sun, the blinds were kept closed, and Miss Pike did not look out. If she had only looked out! But then perhaps she wouldn't have thought much about it; for who would dream of little daughters of respectable parents bringing matches to school?  It might be very funny to light a fire on one's own little hearth, and bake one's own little biscuits for tea; but then it was certainly wrong. If it hadn't been wrong, why didn't the little girls tell of it at home? What made Flaxie seize a bunch of matches from the kitchen-shelf and hide them in her pocket? What made Milly snatch that piece of dough when Nancy's back was turned, and run away with it so fast? Children are never sly, you know, when they are doing right.  If these biscuits turned out well, they were to bake some more to-morrow, and have what Johnny called a \"house-warming,\" and Freddy had partly promised some fish. But this was only the very first day of housekeeping, and they had invited nobody but Ada Blake to tea,--Ada and her dolls.  It seemed as if recess would never come that afternoon, and when it came it wasn't \"any longer than your little finger.\" The fire was kindled the very first minute, the thimble-biscuits rolled out, and then the three children sat on the grass around their hearth to watch the baking. Seven dolls sat there too, with their party-dresses on, waiting very politely. There was a dictionary in the middle of the room for a table, with a pocket-handkerchief spread on it for a table-cloth, and Milly had set out all her best dishes there at noon, with a dot of butter, a pinch of sugar, and some bits of cake.  \"I guess our oven is slow; they don't bake much,\" said Milly, peeping at the biscuits, which were placed in a row on a cabbage-leaf at a respectful distance from the fire.  \"Let's wish something while we're waiting,\" said hungry Flaxie, who had only snatched a very hurried dinner. \"I wish this world was one big doughnut, with only us to eat it!\"  \"Pshaw!\" sniffed Milly, \"why didn't you wish something good,--sponge-cake, with jelly between?\"  \"Wish yourself, Milly Allen, if you can do it so much better'n I can,\" retorted Flaxie, putting another stick on the fire.  \"Well, lemme see; I wish you and I were sisters, Flaxie Frizzle, and Ada was our aunt come from Boston.\"  \"Well there, Milly Allen, that isn't half as nice as my doughnut! What's the use to wish we were sisters, when we are twins now, and that's almost as good?\"  \"Oh, I never!\" laughed Ada. \"Such "]]]
