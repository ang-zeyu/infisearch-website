I purpose this evening to call the attention of the Club to the state of anti-slavery opinions in this country just prior to the year 1800. In this examination I shall make use of a very rare pamphlet in the library of General Washington, which seems to have escaped the notice of writers on this subject; and shall preface my remarks on the main topic of discussion with a brief description of the Washington collection.  In the library of the Boston Athenæum, the visitor sees, as he enters, a somewhat elaborately-constructed book-case, with glass front, filled with old books. This is the library of George Washington, which came into possession of the Athenæum in 1849. It was purchased that year from the heirs of Judge Bushrod Washington--the favorite nephew to whom the General left all his books and manuscripts--by Mr. Henry Stevens, of London, with the intention of placing it in the British Museum. Before the books were shipped, they were bought by Mr. George Livermore and a few other literary and public-spirited gentlemen of Boston, and presented to the Athenæum. Mr. Livermore, as discretionary executor of the estate of Thomas Dowse, the \"literary leather-dresser\" of Cambridge, added to the gift one thousand dollars, for the purpose of printing a description and catalogue of the collection, which has not yet been done.  The collection numbers about twelve hundred titles, of which four hundred and fifty are bound volumes, and seven hundred and fifty are pamphlets and unbound serials. Some books of the original library of General Washington still remain at Mt. Vernon, and are, or were a few years since, shown to visitors, with other curiosities.  Separated from association with their former illustrious owner, the bound volumes, which are mostly English books, present but few attractions. Among them are a few treatises on the art of war and military tactics, which evidently were never much read. These were imported after his unfortunate expedition with Braddock's army, and before the revolutionary war. There are books on horse and cattle diseases; on domestic medicine; on farming, and on religious topics--such works as we might expect to find on the shelves of a intelligent Virginia planter. It is evident that their owner was no student or specialist. Many of the books were sent to him as presents, with complimentary inscriptions by the donors. The bindings are all in their original condition, and generally of the most common description. The few exceptions were presentation copies. Col. David Humphreys, Washington's aid-de-camp during the revolutionary war, presents his \"Miscellaneous Works,\" printed in 1790, bound, regardless of expense, by some Philadelphia binder, in full red morocco, gilt and goffered edges, and with covers and fly-leaves lined with figured satin. As the book was for a very distinguished man, the patriotic binder has stamped on the covers and back every device he had in his shop. Nearly all the volumes have the bold autograph of \"Go. Washington,\" upon their title pages, and the well-known book-plate, with his name, armorial bearings, and motto, _Exitus acta probat_,[1] on the inside of the covers.  There are persons at the present day who have very positive opinions on the subject of prose fiction, believing that great characters like Jonathan Edwards and George Washington never read such naughty books when they were young. Let us see. Here is the \"Adventures of Peregrine Pickle; in which are included the Memoirs of a Lady of Quality,\" by Tobias Smollett, in three volumes. On the title page of the first volume is the autograph of George Washington, written in the cramped hand of a boy of fourteen. The work shows more evidence of having been attentively read, even to the end of the third volume, than any in the library. Here is the \"Life and Opinions of John Buncle,\" a book which it is better that boarding-school misses should not read. Yet Washington read it, and enjoyed the fun; for it is one of the few books he speaks of in his correspondence as having read and enjoyed. The present generation of readers are not familiar with John Buncle. Of the book and its author, Hazlitt says \"John Buncle is the English Rabelais. The soul of Francis Rabelais passed into Thomas Amory, the author of John Buncle. Both were physicians, and enemies of much gravity. Their great business was to enjoy life. Rabelais indulges his spirit of sensuality in wine, in dried neats' tongues, in Bologna sausages, in Botorgas. John Buncle shows the same symptoms of inordinate satisfaction in bread and butter. While Rabelais roared with Friar John and the monks, John Buncle gossiped with the ladies.\"  It is the good fortune of the youth of our age that they are served with fun in more refined and discreet methods; yet there is a melancholy satisfaction in finding in the life of a great historical character like Washington, who was the embodiment of dignity and propriety, that he could, at some period of his existence, unbend and enjoy a book like John Buncle. He becomes, thereby, more human; and the distance between him and ordinary mortals seems to diminish.  Thomas Comber's \"Discourses on the Common Prayer,\" has three autographs of his father, Augustine Washington, one of his mother, Mary Washington, and one of his own, written when nine years of age. The fly-leaves he had used as a practice book for writing his father's and mother's names and his own, and for constructing monograms of the family names.[2]  The pamphlets in the collection have intrinsically more value than the larger works. They were nearly all contemporaneous, and were sent to Washington by their authors, with inscriptions upon the title pages in their authors' handwriting, of the most profound respect and esteem. Some of these pamphlets are now exceedingly rare. In a bound volume lettered \"Tracts on Slavery,\" and containing several papers, all of radical anti-slavery tendencies,[3] is the one to which I wish especially to call your attention. It is so rare that, having shown this copy for fifteen years to persons especially interested in this subject, and having made the most diligent inquiry, I have never heard of another, till within a few days since, when I learn from my friend, Mr. George H. Moore, the librarian of the New York Historical Society, that there is a copy in that society's library. Its title is: \"An Oration upon the Moral and Political Evil of Slavery. Delivered at a Public Meeting of the Maryland Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and the Relief of Free Negroes and others unlawfully held in Bondage, Baltimore, July 4, 1791. By George Buchanan, M. D., Member of the American Philosophical Society. Baltimore: Printed by Philip Edwards, M,DCC,XCIII.\" Twenty pages, octavo.  A Fourth-of-July oration in Baltimore, on the moral and political evils of slavery, only four years after the adoption of the Constitution, is an incident worthy of historical recognition, and a place in anti-slavery literature. The following extracts will give an idea of its style and range of thought:      \"God hath created mankind after His own image, and granted them     liberty and independence; and if varieties may be found in their     structure and color, these are only to be attributed to the nature     of their diet and habits, as also to the soil and the climate they     may inhabit, and serve as flimsy pretexts for enslaving them.      \"What, will you not consider that the Africans are men? That they     have human souls to be saved? That they are born free and     independent? A violation of these prerogatives is an infringement     upon the laws of God.      \"Possessed of Christian sentiments, they fail not to exercise them     when opportunity offers. Things pleasing rejoice them, and     melancholy circumstances pall their appetites for amusements. They     brook no insults, and are equally prone to forgiveness, as to     resentments. They have gratitude also, and will even expose their     lives to wipe off the obligation of past favors; nor do they want     any of the refinements of taste, so much the boast of those who     call themselves Christians.      \"The talent for music, both vocal and instrumental, appears     natural to them; neither is their genius for literature to be     despised. Many instances are recorded of men of eminence among     them. Witness Ignatius Sancho, whose letters are admired by all     men of taste. Phillis Wheatley, who distinguished herself as a     poetess; the Physician of New Orleans; the Virginia Calculator;     Banneker, the Maryland Astronomer, and many others, whom it would     be needless to mention. These are sufficient to show, that the     Africans whom you despise, whom you inhumanly treat as brutes, and     whom you unlawfully subject to slavery, are equally capable of     improvement with yourselves.      \"This you may think a bold assertion; but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23956"],["title","Anti-Slavery Opinions before the Year 1800 (#1)"],["body","is not made without     reflection, nor independent of the testimony of many who have     taken pains in their education. Because you see few, in comparison     to their number, who make any exertion of ability at all, you are     ready to enjoy the common opinion that they are an inferior set     of beings, and destined to the cruelties and hardships you impose     upon them.      \"But be cautious how long you hold such sentiments; the time may     come when you will be obliged to abandon them. Consider the     pitiable situation of these most distressed beings, deprived of     their liberty and reduced to slavery. Consider also that they toil     not for themselves from the rising of the sun to its going down,     and you will readily conceive the cause of their inaction. What     time or what incitement has a slave to become wise? There is no     great art in hilling corn, or in running a furrow; and to do this     they know they are doomed, whether they seek into the mysteries of     science or remain ignorant as they are.      \"To deprive a man of his liberty has a tendency to rob his soul of     every spring to virtuous actions; and were slaves to become     fiends, the wonder could not be great. 'Nothing more assimulates a     man to a beast,' says the learned Montesquieu, 'than being among     freemen, himself a slave; for slavery clogs the mind, perverts the     moral faculty, and reduces the conduct of man to the standard of     brutes.' What right have you to expect greater things of these     poor mortals? You would not blame a brute for committing ravages     upon his prey; nor ought you to censure a slave for making     attempts to regain his liberty, even at the risk of life itself.      \"Such are the effects of subjecting man to slavery, that it     destroys every human principle, vitiates the mind, instills ideas     of unlawful cruelties, and subverts the springs of government.      \"What a distressing scene is here before us? America, I start at     your situation! These direful effects of slavery demand your most     serious attention. What! shall a people who flew to arms with the     valor of Roman citizens when encroachments were made upon their     liberties by the invasion of foreign powers, now basely descend to     cherish the seed and propagate the growth of the evil which they     boldly sought to eradicate? To the eternal infamy of our country     this will be handed down to posterity, written in the blood of     African innocence. If your forefathers have been degenerate enough     to introduce slavery into your country to contaminate the minds of     her citizens, you ought to have the virtue of extirpating it.      \"In the first struggles for American freedom, in the enthusiastic     ardor of attaining liberty and independence, one of the most noble     sentiments that ever adorned the human breast was loudly     proclaimed in all her councils. Deeply penetrated with the sense     of equality, they held it as a fixed principle, 'that all men are     by nature, and of right ought to be, free; that they were created     equal, and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable     rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of     happiness. Nevertheless, _when_ the blessings of peace were     showered upon them; _when_ they had obtained these rights which     they had so boldly contended for, _then_ they became apostates to     their principles, and riveted the fetters of slavery upon the     unfortunate African.      \"Deceitful men! Who could have suggested that American patriotism     would at this day countenance a conduct so inconsistent; that     while America boasts of being a land of freedom, and an asylum for     the oppressed of Europe, she should at the same time foster an     abominable nursery of slaves to check the shoots of her growing     liberty? Deaf to the clamors of criticism, she feels no remorse,     and blindly pursues the object of her destruction; she encourages     the propagation of vice, and suffers her youth to be reared in the     habits of cruelty. Not even the sobs and groans of injured     innocence which reek from every state can excite her pity, nor     human misery bend her heart to sympathy. Cruel and oppressive she     wantonly abuses the rights of man, and willingly sacrifices her     liberty upon the altar of slavery.      \"What an opportunity is here given for triumph among her enemies!     Will they not exclaim that, upon this very day, while the     Americans celebrate the anniversary of freedom and independence,     abject slavery exists in all her states but one?     [Note--Massachusetts.] How degenerately base to merit the rebuke!     Fellow countrymen, let the heart of humanity awake and direct your     councils. Combine to drive the fiend monster from your     territories.      \"Your laborers are slaves, and they have no incentive to be     industrious; they are clothed and victualed, whether lazy or     hard-working; and, from the calculations that have been made, one     freeman is worth two slaves in the field, which make it in many     instances cheaper to have hirelings; for they are incited to     industry by hopes of reputation and future employment, and are     careful of their apparel and their implements of husbandry, where     they must provide them for themselves; whereas the others have     little or no temptation to attend to any of these circumstances.      \"Fellow countrymen, let the hand of persecution be no longer     raised against you; act virtuously; 'do unto all men as you would     that they should do unto you,' and exterminate the pest of slavery     from the land.\"  The orator then goes on to hold up the horrors of an insurrection. He reminds his hearers that in many parts of the South the number of slaves exceeds that of the whites. He reminds them that these slaves are naturally born free and have a right to freedom; that they will not forever sweat under the yoke of slavery. \"Heaven,\" he says, \"will not overlook such enormities. She is bound to punish impenitent sinners, and her wrath is to be dreaded by all. What, then, if the fire of liberty shall be kindled among them? What if some enthusiast in their cause shall beat to arms and call them to the standard of freedom? Led on by the hopes of freedom and animated by the inspiring voice of their leaders, they would soon find that 'a day, an hour of virtuous liberty was worth a whole eternity of bondage.'  \"Hark! methinks I hear the work begun; the blacks have sought for allies and have found them in the wilderness, and have called the rusty savages to their assistance, and are preparing to take revenge upon their haughty masters.\"  To this threatening passage the orator has appended a note, in which he says: \"This was thrown out as a conjecture of what possibly might happen; and the insurrections of San Domingo tend to prove this danger to be more considerable than has generally been supposed, and sufficient to alarm the inhabitants of these states.\"  The contingency, which he thought might possibly happen, did actually occur thirty-nine years later, when an insurrection broke out, August, 1830, in Southampton county, Virginia, under the lead of Nat Turner, a fanatical negro preacher, in which sixty-one white men, women, and children were murdered before it was suppressed.  He recommends immediate emancipation; and if this can not be done, \"then,\" he says, \"let the children be liberated at a certain age, and in less than half a century the plague will be totally rooted out from among you; thousands of good citizens will be added to your number, and gratitude will induce them to become your friends.\"  This remarkable oration suggests some interesting questions of historical inquiry. How far do these opinions represent the current sentiments of that time on the subject of slavery? It will be seen that they are of the most radical type. I am not aware that Wendell Phillips or Wm. Lloyd Garrison ever claimed that the negro race was equal in its capacity for improvement to the white race. While its rhetoric was more chaste, they certainly never denounced the system in more vigorous and condemnatory terms.  Forty-four years later (October 21, 1835), Mr. Garrison was waited upon, in open day, by a mob of most respectable citizens, while attending a meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, dragged through the streets of Boston with a rope around his body, and locked up in jail by the Mayor of that sedate city to protect him from his assailants. On the 4th of July, 1834, a meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society was broken up in New York, and the house of Lewis Tappan was sacked by mob violence. A month later, in the city of Philadelphia a mob against anti-slavery and colored men raged for three days and nights. On the 28th of July, 1836, a committee of thirteen citizens of Cincinnati, appointed by a public meeting, of whom Jacob Burnet, late United States Senator and Judge of the Supreme Court of Ohio, was chairman, waited upon Mr. James G. Birney and other members of the executive committee of the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society, under whose direction the \"Philanthropist,\" an anti-slavery newspaper, was printed here, and informed them that unless they desisted from its publication the meeting would not be responsible for the consequences. Judge Burnet stated that the mob would consist of five thousand persons, and that two-thirds of the property holders of the city would join it. The committee gave Mr. Birney and his friends till the next day to consider the question, when they decided to make no terms with the rioters and to abide the consequences. That night the office was sacked, and the press of the \"Philanthropist\" was thrown into the Ohio river.  But here was an oration delivered in the city of Baltimore in the year 1791, advancing the most extreme opinions, and it created not a ripple on the surface of Southern society.  That the "]]]
