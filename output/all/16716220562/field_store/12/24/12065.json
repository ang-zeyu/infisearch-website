Why, I was telephoning and sending errands for two hours before you kiddies were awake this morning.\"  \"Dear Daddy,\" said Marjorie, caressing his hand in both her own, \"you are _so_ good to us; and I _do_ hope it will rain next Ourday!\"  \"So do I!\" said all the others.     CHAPTER VI  THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL   At last schooldays began, and one Monday morning the three Maynards started off.  The first day of school was a great occasion, and much preparation had been made for it.  Mr. Maynard had brought each of the children a fine new box, well stocked with pencils, pens, and things of that sort. Kitty had a new slate, and Midget and King had new blankbooks.  Also, they were all in a state of clean starchiness, and the girls' pretty gingham dresses and King's wide white collar were immaculate.  Marjorie didn't look especially happy, but her mother said:  \"Now, Mopsy, dear, don't go to school as if it were penance. Try to enjoy it, and think of the fun you'll have playing with the other girls at recess.\"  \"I know, Mother; but recess is so short, and school is so long.\"  \"Ho! Only till one o'clock,\" said Kingdon. \"Then we can come home, have lunch, and then there's all the afternoon to play.\"  \"Yes, for you,\" said Marjorie. \"But I have to practise a whole hour, and that leaves almost no time at all, and there are so many things I want to do.\"  \"Now, my little girl,\" said Mrs. Maynard, very seriously, \"you must try to conquer that mood. You know you have to go to school, so why not make the best of it? You don't really dislike it as much as you think you do. So, cheer up, little daughter, and run along, determined to see the bright side, even of school.\"  \"I will try, Mother,\" said Midget, smiling, as she received her good-bye kiss, \"but I'll be glad when it's one o'clock.\"  \"I wiss me could go to school,\" said Rosy Posy, wistfully; \"me an' Boffin, we'd have fun in school.\"  \"There it is,\" said Mrs. Maynard, laughing. \"Little girls who can go to school don't want to go, and little girls who can't go do want to!\"  \"You'll go some day, Baby,\" said King, \"but they won't let you take Boffin.\"  \"Den I won't go!\" declared Rosy Posy, decidedly.  The three walked down the path to the gate, and, soon after they reached the street, they were joined by several others, also schoolward bound.  Marjorie's spirits rose, as she chatted with the merry young people; and as they passed the Fulton house, and Dick and Gladys came out, Marjorie was so glad to see her friend that she was at once her own happy, merry little self again.  Miss Lawrence's room was one of the pleasantest in the big brick building. When Marjorie and Gladys presented themselves at her desk, and asked if they might sit together, the teacher hesitated. She wanted to grant the request of the little girls, but they had been in her class the year before, and she well knew their propensities for mischief.  \"Oh, please, Miss Lawrence!\" begged Marjorie; and, \"Oh, do say yes!\" pleaded Gladys.  It was hard to resist the little coaxers, and Miss Lawrence at last consented.  \"But,\" she said, \"you may sit at the same desk only so long as you behave well. If you cut up naughty pranks, I shall separate you for the rest of the term.\"  \"We won't!\" \"We will be good!\" cried the two children, and they ran happily away to their desk.  Each desk was arranged for two occupants, and both Marjorie and Gladys enjoyed putting their things away neatly, and keeping them in good order. They never spilled ink, or kept their papers helter-skelter, and but for their mischievous ways, would have been model pupils indeed.  \"Let's be real good all the term, Gladys,\" said Midget, who was still under the influence of her mother's parting words. \"Let's try not to cut up tricks, or do anything bad.\"  \"All right, Mopsy. But you mustn't make me laugh in school. It's when you begin to do funny things that I seem to follow on.\"  \"Well, I won't. I'll be as good as a little white mouse. But if I'm a mouse, I'll nibble your things.\"  Down went Marjorie's curly head like a flash, and when it came up again, Gladys' new penholder was between her teeth, and the \"mouse\" was vigorously nibbling it.  \"Stop that, Mops! I think you're real mean! That's my new penholder, and now you've spoiled it.\"  \"So I have! Honest, Gladys, I didn't think the dents would show so. I was just playing mouse, you know. Here, I'll change, and give you mine. It's new, too.\"  \"No, I won't take it.\"  \"Yes, you will; you must. I'm awfully sorry I chewed yours.\"  Poor little Midget! She was always impulsively getting into mischief, but she was always sorry, and generously anxious to make amends.  So Gladys took Marjorie's penholder, and Mopsy had the nibbled one. She didn't like it a bit, for she liked to have her things in good order, but she said to Gladys:  \"Perhaps it will make me remember to be good in school. Oh, s'pose I'd played mouse in school hours!\"  \"Keep still,\" said Gladys, \"the bell has rung.\"  The morning passed pleasantly enough, for there were no lessons on the first day of school.  Books were distributed, and class records were made, and lessons given out for next day.  Marjorie was delighted with her new geography, which was a larger book than the one she had had the year before. Especially was she pleased with a large map which was called the \"Water Hemisphere.\" On the opposite page was the \"Land Hemisphere,\" and this was a division of the globe she had never seen before.  The Water Hemisphere pleased her best, and she at once began to play games with it.  Talking was, of course, forbidden, but motioning for Gladys to follow her example, she made a tiny paper boat, and then another, and several others. These she set afloat on the printed ocean of the Water Hemisphere. Gladys, delighted with the fun, quickly made some boats for herself, and arranged them on her own geography. Other pupils, seeing what was going on, followed the example, and soon nearly all the geographies in the room had little paper craft dotting their oceans.  Next, Marjorie made some little men and women to put in the boats. She had no scissors, but tore them roughly out of paper which she took from her blankbook. Other leaves of this she obligingly passed around, until all the boats in the room were supplied with passengers.  Then Marjorie, still in her position of leader, tore out a semblance of a fish. It seemed to be a whale or shark, with wide-open jaws.  This awful creature came slowly up from the Antarctic Ocean, toward the ships full of people.  Suddenly a boat upset, the passengers fell out, and the whale made a dash for them.  This awful catastrophe was repeated in the other oceans, and, needless to say, in a moment the whole roomful of children were in peals of laughter.  Miss Lawrence looked up from her writing, and saw her class all giggling and shaking behind their geographies. Instinctively she glanced toward Marjorie, but that innocent damsel had swept all her boats and whales into her pocket, and was demurely studying her lessons.  Marjorie did not in the least mean to deceive Miss Lawrence, but when the children all laughed, she suddenly realized that she had been out of order, and so she quickly stopped her play, and resumed her task.  Observing the open geographies covered with scraps of paper, Miss Lawrence felt she must at least inquire into the matter, and, though the children did not want to \"tell tales,\" it soon transpired that Marjorie Maynard had been ringleader in the game.  \"Why did you do it, Marjorie?\" asked Miss Lawrence, with a reproachful expression on her face. As she had meant no harm, Marjorie felt called upon to defend herself.  \"Why, Miss Lawrence,\" she said, rising in her seat, \"I didn't think everybody would do it, just because I did. And I didn't think much about it anyway. I s'pose that's the trouble. I _never_ think! But I never had a jography before with such a big ocean map, and it was such a lovely place to sail boats, I just made a few. And then I just thought I'd put some people in the boats, and then it seemed as if such a big ocean ought to have fish in it. So I made a whale,--and I was going to make a lot of bluefish and shads and things, but a boat upset, and the whale came after the people, and then, first thing I knew, everybody was laughing! I didn't mean to do wrong.\"  Marjorie looked so genuinely distressed that Miss Lawrence hadn't the heart to scold her. But she sighed as she thought of the days to come.  \"No, Marjorie,\" she said, \"I don't think you did mean to do wrong, but you ought to know better than to make paper toys to play with in school.\"  \"But it isn't exactly a schoolday, Miss Lawrence.\"  \"No; and for that very reason I shall not punish you this time. But remember, after this, that playing games of any sort is out of place in the schoolroom.\"  \"Yes, ma'am,\" said Marjorie, and she sat down, feeling that she had been forgiven, and firmly resolved to try harder than ever to be good.  But half-suppressed chuckles now and then, in different parts of the schoolroom, proved to the watchful Miss Lawrence that some of the whales were still lashing about the paper oceans in quest of upturned boats.  The game so filled Marjorie's thoughts that she asked that Gladys and she might be allowed to stay in the schoolroom at recess and play it.  \"There's surely no harm in playing games at recess, is there, Miss Lawrence?\" she asked, as she caressed her teacher's hand.  Miss Lawrence hesitated. \"No,\" she said, at last; \"I can't let you stay in the schoolroom. I'm sorry, dearies, and I hate to be always saying 'No,' but I feel sure your parents want you to run out in the fresh air at recess time, and they wouldn't like to have you stay indoors.\"  \"Oh, dear,\" said Marjorie; \"seems 'sif we can't have any fun!\" Then her face brightened, and she added, \"But mayn't we take our jographies out on the playground, and play out there?\"  There was a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23531"],["title","Marjorie's Busy Days (#8)"],["body","against taking schoolbooks out of the classrooms, but Miss Lawrence so disliked to say 'No' again that she made a special dispensation, and said:  \"Yes, do take your geographies out with you. But be very careful not to soil or tear them.\"  And so the two girls danced away, and all through the recess hour, boats upset and awful sharks swallowed shrieking victims. But, as might have been expected, most of the other children came flying back to the schoolroom for their geographies, and again Miss Lawrence was in a quandary.  \"I never saw a child like Marjorie Maynard,\" she confided to another teacher. \"She's the dearest little girl, but she gets up such crazy schemes, and all the others follow in her footsteps.\"  So, after recess, Miss Lawrence had to make a rule that books could not be used as playthings, even at recess times.  For the rest of the morning, Marjorie was a model pupil.  She studied her lessons for the next day, and though Miss Lawrence glanced at her from time to time, she never saw anything amiss.  But when school was over at one o'clock, Marjorie drew a long breath and fairly flew for her hat.  \"Good-bye, dearie,\" said Miss Lawrence, as Midge passed her when the long line filed out.  \"Good-bye!\" was the smiling response, and in two minutes more Mopsy was skipping and jumping across the playground.  \"Hello, King!\" she called. \"Where's Kitty? Oh, here you are! Now we can all go home together. What shall we do this afternoon? I want to do something jolly to take the taste of school out of my mouth.\"  \"Come over to our house and play in the hay,\" said Dick Fulton.  \"All right, we will. I'll have my practising done by three o'clock, and we'll come then.\"  A little later, and the three Maynards flew in at their own gate, and found a warm welcome and a specially good luncheon awaiting them.  \"I got along pretty well, Mother,\" said Marjorie, as they all told their morning's experiences. \"Only I couldn't help playing paper boats.\" She told the whole story, and Mrs. Maynard smiled as she said:  \"Marjorie, you are incorrigible; but I fear you will only learn by experience----\"  \"What is incorrigible?\" asked Marjorie.  \"It's 'most too big a word for you to understand,\" said her mother, \"but it means you must just keep on everlastingly trying to be good.\"  \"I will,\" said Mops, heartily, and then she turned her attention to the chicken pie before her.     CHAPTER VII  THE JINKS CLUB   Saturday was hailed with delight by the four Maynards.  Now that school had begun, a whole playday meant more than it did in vacation time, when all days were playdays.  It was a glorious September day, and as it was an early autumn, many leaves had fallen and lay thick upon the ground.  \"I know what to do,\" said Marjorie, as directly after breakfast they put on hats and coats for outdoor play of some sort. \"Let's make leaf-houses.\"  \"All right,\" said Kingdon, \"and let's telephone for the others.\"  \"The others\" always meant the two Fultons and Kitty's friend, Dorothy Adams.  Rosy Posy was too little to have a special chum, so Boffin was her companion.  Leaf-houses was a favorite game with all of them, and soon the three guests came skipping through the gate.  The leaves had been raked from the lawn, but down in the orchard they were on the ground like a thick carpet. The orchard had many maples and elms, as well as fruit trees, so there were leaves of all sorts.  \"Isn't it fun to scuffle through 'em!\" said Marjorie, as she led the way, shuffling along, almost knee-deep in the brown, dry leaves.  \"More fun to roll!\" cried Dick, tumbling down and floundering about.  Down went Rosy Posy in imitation of Dick's performance, and then they all fell into the leaves, and burrowed about like rabbits.  Presently Marjorie's head emerged like a bright-eyed turtle poking out from its shell, and shaking the dead leaves out of her curls, she said: \"Come on, let's make houses. King, won't you and Dick get some rakes?\"  The boys flew off to the toolhouse, and came back with several rakes, both wood and iron ones.  \"Here's all we can find,\" said King. \"Some of us can rake, and some can build things.\"  They all set to work with a will, and soon two houses were in process of construction.  These houses were, of course, merely a ground plan, and long, low piles of leaves divided the rooms. Openings in these partitions made doors, and the furniture was also formed of heaps of leaves. A long heap was a sofa, and a smaller heap a chair, while a round, flat heap was a table.  King, Gladys, and Dorothy were one family, while Dick, Marjorie, and Kitty were the other.  Rosy Posy was supposed to be an orphan child, who lived with one family or the other in turn, as suited her somewhat fickle fancy.  In each family the children represented father, mother, and daughter, and they were pleasantly neighborly, or at odds with each other, as occasion required.  To-day the spirit of adventure was strong in Marjorie, and she decreed they should play robbers.  This was always a good game, so they all agreed.  \"First, King's family must be robbed,\" said Midget; \"and then, after you catch us, you rob us.\"  The burglaries were thus amicably planned, and Kingdon and his family, lying on leaf-couches, fell into a deep, but somewhat noisy slumber. Indeed, their snoring was loud enough to frighten away most robbers.  Rosy Posy didn't count in this game, so she was allowed to wander in and out of either house.  When the Kingdon family were _very_ sound asleep, the Dick family crept softly in through the open doors, and endeavored to steal certain valuable silver from the sideboard. This silver was admirably represented by chips and sticks.  Dick and Marjorie had secured their booty and were carefully sneaking away when King awoke, and with a howl pounced upon Kitty, who was still industriously stealing silver.  This, of course, was part of the game, and Dick and Midget wrung their hands in despair as they saw their daughter forcibly detained by the master of the house.  Then Gladys and Dorothy were awakened by the noise, and added their frightened screams to the general hullaballoo.  Kitty was bound hand and foot in the very dining-room where the silver had been, and King went valiantly out to hunt the other marauders. Then the game was for King and his family to try to catch Dick and Midget, or for Kitty's parents to release her from her bondage.  At last, as King and Gladys were both engaged in chasing Dick, Marjorie found an opportunity to free Kitty, and then the game began again, the other way round.  At last they tired of hostilities and agreed to rebuild their houses, combining them in one, and calling it a big hotel.  \"Or a clubhouse,\" said King, who had recently visited one with his father, and had been much impressed.  \"Clubhouses are grand,\" he said. \"They have porches, and swimming-pools, and gyms, and dining-rooms, and everything!\"  So the architecture was changed, and soon a fine clubhouse was outlined in leafy relief.  \"Then if this is a clubhouse, we're a club,\" said Kitty, thoughtfully.  \"Oh, let's be a club!\" exclaimed Marjorie. \"Clubs are lots of fun. I mean children's clubs--not big ones like father's.\"  \"What do clubs do?\" asked Dorothy, who had a wholesome fear of some of the Maynards' escapades.  \"Why, we can do anything we want to, if we're a club,\" said Dick. \"I think it would be fun. What shall we do?\"  \"Let's cut up jinks,\" said Marjorie, who was especially energetic that day.  \"And let's call it the Jinks Club,\" suggested Gladys.  \"Goody! Goody!!\" cried Midge. \"Just the thing, Glad! And then we can cut up any jinks we want to,--as long as they're good jinks,\" she added, thoughtfully.  \"What do you mean by that?\" demanded King.  \"Well, you see, last summer at Grandma's, she told me there were good jinks and bad jinks. She meant just plain fun, or real mischief. And I promised I'd cut up only good jinks.\"  \"All right,\" said Dick, \"I'll agree to that. We just want to have fun, you know; not get into mischief.\"  So, as they were all agreed on this, the Jinks Club was started.  \"I'll be president,\" volunteered Marjorie.  \"Does somebody have to be president?\" asked Gladys. \"And does the president have all the say?\"  \"Let's all be presidents,\" said King. \"I know clubs usually have only one; but who cares? We'll be different.\"  \"All right,\" said Marjorie. \"And, anyway, we won't need a secretary and treasurer and such things, so we'll each be president. I think that will be more fun, too.\"  \"Me be president,\" announced Rosy Posy, \"an' Boffin be a president, too.\"  \"Yes,\" said King, smiling at his baby sister, \"you and Boff and all the rest of us. Then, you see, we can all make rules, if we want to.\"  \"We don't need many rules,\" said Dick. \"Just a few about meetings and things. When shall we meet?\"  \"Every day after school, and every Saturday,\" said Marjorie, who was of a whole-souled nature.  \"Oh, no!\" said Gladys. \"I know Mother won't let me come as often as that.\"  \"Don't let's have special times,\" said King. \"Just whenever we're all together, we'll have a meeting.\"  This was agreed to, but Marjorie didn't seem quite satisfied.  \"It doesn't seem like a real club,\" she said, \"unless we have dues and badges and things like that.\"  \"Huh, dues!\" said King. \"I want to spend my money for other things besides dues to an old club! What would we do with the dues, anyway?\"  \"Oh, save them up in the treasury,\" said Marjorie, \"until we had enough to go to the circus, or something nice like that.\"  This sounded attractive, and King reconsidered.  \"Well, I don't mind,\" he said. \"But I won't give all my money. I have fifty cents a week. I'll give ten.\"  \"So will I,\" said Dick, and the others all agreed to do the same.  Of course, Rosy Posy didn't count, so this made sixty cents a week, and furthermore it necessitated a treasurer.  \"Let's each be treasurer,\" said King, remembering how well his presidential plan had succeeded.  \"No,\" said Midget; \"that's silly. I'll"]]]
