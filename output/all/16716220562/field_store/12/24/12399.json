[Note 8: Talon, a famous St. Petersburg restaurateur.]     [Note 9: Paul Petròvitch Kaverine, a friend for whom Pushkin in    his youth appears to have entertained great respect and    admiration. He was an officer in the Hussars of the Guard, and    a noted “dandy” and man about town. The poet on one occasion    addressed the following impromptu to his friend’s portrait:        “Within him daily see the the fires of punch and war,       Upon the fields of Mars a gallant warrior,       A faithful friend to friends, of ladies torturer,                           But ever the Hussar.”]     XIV     Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels    To cool the cutlets’ seething grease,    When the sonorous Bréguet tells    Of the commencement of the piece.    A critic of the stage malicious,    A slave of actresses capricious,    Onéguine was a citizen    Of the domains of the side-scene.    To the theatre he repairs    Where each young critic ready stands,    Capers applauds with clap of hands,    With hisses Cleopatra scares,    Moina recalls for this alone    That all may hear his voice’s tone.     XV     Thou fairy-land! Where formerly    Shone pungent Satire’s dauntless king,    Von Wisine, friend of liberty,    And Kniajnine, apt at copying.    The young Simeonova too there    With Ozeroff was wont to share    Applause, the people’s donative.    There our Katènine did revive    Corneille’s majestic genius,    Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out    His comedies, a noisy rout,    There Didelot became glorious,    There, there, beneath the side-scene’s shade    The drama of my youth was played.(10)     [Note 10: _Denis Von Wisine_ (1741-92), a favourite Russian    dramatist. His first comedy “The Brigadier,” procured him the    favour of the second Catherine. His best, however, is the    “Minor” (Niedorosl). Prince Potemkin, after witnessing it,    summoned the author, and greeted him with the exclamation,    “Die now, Denis!” In fact, his subsequent performances were    not of equal merit.     _Jacob Borissovitch Kniajnine_ (1742-91), a clever adapter of    French tragedy.     _Simeonova_, a celebrated tragic actress, who retired from    the stage in early life and married a Prince Gagarine.     _Ozeroff_, one of the best-known Russian dramatists of the    period; he possessed more originality than Kniajnine. “Œdipus    in Athens,” “Fingal,” “Demetrius Donskoi,” and “Polyxena,” are    the best known of his tragedies.     _Katènine_ translated Corneille’s tragedies into Russian.     _Didelot_, sometime Director of the ballet at the Opera at    St. Petersburg.]     XVI     My goddesses, where are your shades?    Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?    Are ye replaced by other maids    Who cannot conjure former joys?    Shall I your chorus hear anew,    Russia’s Terpsichore review    Again in her ethereal dance?    Or will my melancholy glance    On the dull stage find all things changed,    The disenchanted glass direct    Where I can no more recollect?—    A careless looker-on estranged    In silence shall I sit and yawn    And dream of life’s delightful dawn?     XVII     The house is crammed. A thousand lamps    On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,    Impatiently the gallery stamps,    The curtain now they slowly raise.    Obedient to the magic strings,    Brilliant, ethereal, there springs    Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding    Istomina(*) the nimbly-bounding;    With one foot resting on its tip    Slow circling round its fellow swings    And now she skips and now she springs    Like down from Aeolus’s lip,    Now her lithe form she arches o’er    And beats with rapid foot the floor.     [Note: Istomina—A celebrated Circassian dancer of the day, with    whom the poet in his extreme youth imagined himself in love.]     XVIII     Shouts of applause! Onéguine passes    Between the stalls, along the toes;    Seated, a curious look with glasses    On unknown female forms he throws.    Free scope he yields unto his glance,    Reviews both dress and countenance,    With all dissatisfaction shows.    To male acquaintances he bows,    And finally he deigns let fall    Upon the stage his weary glance.    He yawns, averts his countenance,    Exclaiming, “We must change ’em all!    I long by ballets have been bored,    Now Didelot scarce can be endured!”     XIX     Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout    Across the stage still madly sweep,    Whilst the tired serving-men without    Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.    Still the loud stamping doth not cease,    Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,    Still everywhere, without, within,    The lamps illuminating shine;    The steed benumbed still pawing stands    And of the irksome harness tires,    And still the coachmen round the fires(11)    Abuse their masters, rub their hands:    But Eugene long hath left the press    To array himself in evening dress.     [Note 11: In Russia large fires are lighted in winter time in front    of the theatres for the benefit of the menials, who, considering    the state of the thermometer, cannot be said to have a jovial    time of it. But in this, as in other cases, “habit” alleviates    their lot, and they bear the cold with a wonderful equanimity.]     XX     Faithfully shall I now depict,    Portray the solitary den    Wherein the child of fashion strict    Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?    All that industrial London brings    For tallow, wood and other things    Across the Baltic’s salt sea waves,    All which caprice and affluence craves,    All which in Paris eager taste,    Choosing a profitable trade,    For our amusement ever made    And ease and fashionable waste,—    Adorned the apartment of Eugene,    Philosopher just turned eighteen.     XXI     China and bronze the tables weight,    Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,    And, joy of souls effeminate,    Phials of crystal scents enclose.    Combs of all sizes, files of steel,    Scissors both straight and curved as well,    Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes    Both for the nails and for the tushes.    Rousseau, I would remark in passing,(12)    Could not conceive how serious Grimm    Dared calmly cleanse his nails ’fore him,    Eloquent raver all-surpassing,—    The friend of liberty and laws    In this case quite mistaken was.     [Note 12: “Tout le monde sut qu’il (Grimm) mettait du blanc; et    moi, qui n’en croyait rien, je commençai de le croire, non    seulement par l’embellissement de son teint, et pour avoir trouvé    des tasses de blanc sur la toilette, mais sur ce qu’entrant un    matin dans sa chambre, je le trouvais brossant ses ongles avec    une petite vergette faite exprès, ouvrage qu’il continua fièrement    devant moi. Je jugeai qu’un homme qui passe deux heures tous les    matins à brosser ses ongles peut bien passer quelques instants à    remplir de blanc les creux de sa peau.”                              _Confessions de J. J. Rousseau_]     XXII     The most industrious man alive    May yet be studious of his nails;    What boots it with the age to strive?    Custom the despot soon prevails.    A new Kaverine Eugene mine,    Dreading the world’s remarks malign,    Was that which we are wont to call    A fop, in dress pedantical.    Three mortal hours per diem he    Would loiter by the looking-glass,    And from his dressing-room would pass    Like Venus when, capriciously,    The goddess would a masquerade    Attend in male attire arrayed.     XXIII     On this artistical retreat    Having once fixed your interest,    I might to connoisseurs repeat    The style in which my hero dressed;    Though I confess I hardly dare    Describe in detail the affair,    Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,    To Russ indigenous are not;    And also that my feeble verse—    Pardon I ask for such a sin—    With words of foreign origin    Too much I’m given to intersperse,    Though to the Academy I come    And oft its Dictionary thumb.(13)     [Note 13: Refers to Dictionary of the Academy, compiled during the    reign of Catherine II under the supervision of Lomonossoff.]     XXIV     But such is not my project now,    So let us to the ball-room haste,    Whither at headlong speed doth go    Eugene in hackney carriage placed.    Past darkened windows and long streets    Of slumbering citizens he fleets,    Till carriage lamps, a double row,    Cast a gay lustre on the snow,    Which shines with iridescent hues.    He nears a spacious mansion’s gate,    By many a lamp illuminate,    And through the lofty windows views    Profiles of lovely dames he knows    And also fashionable beaux.     XXV     Our hero stops and doth alight,    Flies past the porter to the stair,    But, ere he mounts the marble flight,    With hurried hand smooths down his hair.    He enters: in the hall a crowd,    No more the music thunders loud,    Some a mazurka occupies,    Crushing and a confusing noise;    Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,    The feet of graceful ladies fly,    And following them ye might espy    Full many a glance like lightning flash,    And by the fiddle’s rushing sound    The voice of jealousy is drowned.     XXVI     In my young days of wild delight    On balls I madly used to dote,    Fond declarations they invite    Or the delivery of a note.    So hearken, every worthy spouse,    I would your vigilance arouse,    Attentive be unto my rhymes    And due precautions take betimes.    Ye mothers also, caution use,    Upon your daughters keep an eye,    Employ your glasses constantly,    For otherwise—God only knows!    I lift a warning voice because    I long have ceased to offend the laws.     XXVII     Alas! life’s hours which swiftly fly    I’ve wasted in amusements vain,    But were it not immoral I    Should dearly like a dance again.    I love its furious delight,    The crowd and merriment and light,    The ladies, their fantastic"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],["title","Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#4)"],["body","ess,    Also their feet—yet ne’ertheless    Scarcely in Russia can ye find    Three pairs of handsome female feet;    Ah! I still struggle to forget    A pair; though desolate my mind,    Their memory lingers still and seems    To agitate me in my dreams.     XXVIII     When, where, and in what desert land,    Madman, wilt thou from memory raze    Those feet? Alas! on what far strand    Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?    Lapped in your Eastern luxury,    No trace ye left in passing by    Upon the dreary northern snows,    But better loved the soft repose    Of splendid carpets richly wrought.    I once forgot for your sweet cause    The thirst for fame and man’s applause,    My country and an exile’s lot;    My joy in youth was fleeting e’en    As your light footprints on the green.     XXIX     Diana’s bosom, Flora’s cheeks,    Are admirable, my dear friend,    But yet Terpsichore bespeaks    Charms more enduring in the end.    For promises her feet reveal    Of untold gain she must conceal,    Their privileged allurements fire    A hidden train of wild desire.    I love them, O my dear Elvine,(14)    Beneath the table-cloth of white,    In winter on the fender bright,    In springtime on the meadows green,    Upon the ball-room’s glassy floor    Or by the ocean’s rocky shore.     [Note 14: _Elvine_, or _Elvina_, was not improbably the owner of the    seductive feet apostrophized by the poet, since, in 1816, he wrote    an ode, “To Her,” which commences thus:     “Elvina, my dear, come, give me thine hand,” and so forth.]     XXX     Beside the stormy sea one day    I envied sore the billows tall,    Which rushed in eager dense array    Enamoured at her feet to fall.    How like the billow I desired    To kiss the feet which I admired!    No, never in the early blaze    Of fiery youth’s untutored days    So ardently did I desire    A young Armida’s lips to press,    Her cheek of rosy loveliness    Or bosom full of languid fire,—    A gust of passion never tore    My spirit with such pangs before.     XXXI     Another time, so willed it Fate,    Immersed in secret thought I stand    And grasp a stirrup fortunate—    Her foot was in my other hand.    Again imagination blazed,    The contact of the foot I raised    Rekindled in my withered heart    The fires of passion and its smart—    Away! and cease to ring their praise    For ever with thy tattling lyre,    The proud ones are not worth the fire    Of passion they so often raise.    The words and looks of charmers sweet    Are oft deceptive—like their feet.     XXXII     Where is Onéguine? Half asleep,    Straight from the ball to bed he goes,    Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep    The drum already doth arouse.    The shopman and the pedlar rise    And to the Bourse the cabman plies;    The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,(15)    Crunching the morning snow she treads;    Morning awakes with joyous sound;    The shutters open; to the skies    In column blue the smoke doth rise;    The German baker looks around    His shop, a night-cap on his head,    And pauses oft to serve out bread.     [Note 15: i.e. the milkmaid from the Okhta villages, a suburb of St.    Petersburg on the right bank of the Neva chiefly inhabited by the    labouring classes.]     XXXIII     But turning morning into night,    Tired by the ball’s incessant noise,    The votary of vain delight    Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,    Late in the afternoon to rise,    When the same life before him lies    Till morn—life uniform but gay,    To-morrow just like yesterday.    But was our friend Eugene content,    Free, in the blossom of his spring,    Amidst successes flattering    And pleasure’s daily blandishment,    Or vainly ’mid luxurious fare    Was he in health and void of care?—     XXXIV     Even so! His passions soon abated,    Hateful the hollow world became,    Nor long his mind was agitated    By love’s inevitable flame.    For treachery had done its worst;    Friendship and friends he likewise curst,    Because he could not gourmandise    Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies    And irrigate them with champagne;    Nor slander viciously could spread    Whene’er he had an aching head;    And, though a plucky scatterbrain,    He finally lost all delight    In bullets, sabres, and in fight.     XXXV     His malady, whose cause I ween    It now to investigate is time,    Was nothing but the British spleen    Transported to our Russian clime.    It gradually possessed his mind;    Though, God be praised! he ne’er designed    To slay himself with blade or ball,    Indifferent he became to all,    And like Childe Harold gloomily    He to the festival repairs,    Nor boston nor the world’s affairs    Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh    Impressed him in the least degree,—    Callous to all he seemed to be.     XXXVI     Ye miracles of courtly grace,    He left _you_ first, and I must own    The manners of the highest class    Have latterly vexatious grown;    And though perchance a lady may    Discourse of Bentham or of Say,    Yet as a rule their talk I call    Harmless, but quite nonsensical.    Then they’re so innocent of vice,    So full of piety, correct,    So prudent, and so circumspect    Stately, devoid of prejudice,    So inaccessible to men,    Their looks alone produce the spleen.(16)     [Note 16: Apropos of this somewhat ungallant sentiment, a Russian    scholiast remarks:—“The whole of this ironical stanza is but a    _refined eulogy_ of the excellent qualities of our countrywomen.    Thus Boileau, in the guise of invective, eulogizes Louis XIV.    Russian ladies unite in their persons great acquirements,    combined with amiability and strict morality; also a species of    Oriental charm which so much captivated Madame de Stael.” It will    occur to most that the apologist of the Russian fair “doth    protest too much.” The poet in all probability wrote the offending    stanza in a fit of Byronic “spleen,” as he would most likely    himself have called it. Indeed, since Byron, poets of his school    seem to assume this virtue if they have it not, and we take their    utterances under its influence for what they are worth.]     XXXVII     And you, my youthful damsels fair,    Whom latterly one often meets    Urging your droshkies swift as air    Along Saint Petersburg’s paved streets,    From you too Eugene took to flight,    Abandoning insane delight,    And isolated from all men,    Yawning betook him to a pen.    He thought to write, but labour long    Inspired him with disgust and so    Nought from his pen did ever flow,    And thus he never fell among    That vicious set whom I don’t blame—    Because a member I became.     XXXVIII     Once more to idleness consigned,    He felt the laudable desire    From mere vacuity of mind    The wit of others to acquire.    A case of books he doth obtain—    He reads at random, reads in vain.    This nonsense, that dishonest seems,    This wicked, that absurd he deems,    All are constrained and fetters bear,    Antiquity no pleasure gave,    The moderns of the ancients rave—    Books he abandoned like the fair,    His book-shelf instantly doth drape    With taffety instead of crape.     XXXIX     Having abjured the haunts of men,    Like him renouncing vanity,    His friendship I acquired just then;    His character attracted me.    An innate love of meditation,    Original imagination,    And cool sagacious mind he had:    I was incensed and he was sad.    Both were of passion satiate    And both of dull existence tired,    Extinct the flame which once had fired;    Both were expectant of the hate    With which blind Fortune oft betrays    The very morning of our days.     XL     He who hath lived and living, thinks,    Must e’en despise his kind at last;    He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks    From shades of the relentless past.    No fond illusions live to soothe,    But memory like a serpent’s tooth    With late repentance gnaws and stings.    All this in many cases brings    A charm with it in conversation.    Onéguine’s speeches I abhorred    At first, but soon became inured    To the sarcastic observation,    To witticisms and taunts half-vicious    And gloomy epigrams malicious.     XLI     How oft, when on a summer night    Transparent o’er the Neva beamed    The firmament in mellow light,    And when the watery mirror gleamed    No more with pale Diana’s rays,(17)    We called to mind our youthful days—    The days of love and of romance!    Then would we muse as in a trance,    Impressionable for an hour,    And breathe the balmy breath of night;    And like the prisoner’s our delight    Who for the greenwood quits his tower,    As on the rapid wings of thought    The early days of life we sought.     [Note 17: The midsummer nights in the latitude of St. Petersburg    are a prolonged twilight.]     XLII     Absorbed in melancholy mood    And o’er the granite coping bent,    Onéguine meditative stood,    E’en as the poet says he leant.(18)    ’Tis silent all! Alone the cries    Of the night sentinels arise    And from the Millionaya afar(19)    The sudden rattling of a car.    Lo! on the sleeping river borne,    A boat with splashing oar floats by,    And now we hear delightedly    A jolly song and distant horn;    But sweeter in a midnight dream    Torquato Tasso’s strains I deem.     [Note 18: Refers to Mouravieff’s “Goddess of the Neva.” At St.    Petersburg the banks of the Neva are lined throughout with    splendid granite quays.]     [Note 19:    A street running parallel to the Neva, and leading from    the Winter Palace to the Summer Palace and Garden.]     XLIII     Ye billows of blue Hadria’s sea,    O Brenta, once more we shall meet    And, inspiration firing me,    Your magic voices I shall greet,    Whose tones Apollo’s sons inspire,    And after Albion’s proud lyre (20)    Possess my love and sympathy.    The nights of golden Italy    I’ll pass beneath the firmament,    Hid in the gondola’s dark"]]]
