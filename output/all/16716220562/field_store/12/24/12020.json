The pistol happened to stick in the snow, with the butt in the air, and when the bear came up to it he stopped to smell it!  It it well known, nowadays, that polar bears are full of curiosity, and will stop for a few minutes to examine anything that comes in their way, even when they are in full chase of a man.  Davy Butts knew nothing of this at the time; but he was a quick-witted fellow.  He observed this stopping of the bear, and determined to give him something more to stop at.  When bruin was close at his heels he threw down his cap.  The bear at once pulled up, smelt it all round, tossed it into the air with his snout, pawed it once or twice, then tore it to pieces with one wrench, and continued the chase.  Very little time was lost in this operation. He was soon up with the man again; then a mitten was thrown down for his inspection.  After that the other mitten went, the cravat followed, and the axe went next.  All that I have just related happened in a very few minutes.  Davy was still a good quarter of a mile from the brig; everything that he could tear off his person in haste and throw down was gone, and the bear was once more coming up behind.  As a last hope he pulled off his heavy fur-coat and dropped it.  This seemed to be a subject of great interest to the bear, for it was longer in inspecting it than the other things.  And now poor Butts went tearing along like a maniac, in his flannel shirt and trousers.  He was a miserable and curious object, for his body, besides being very long, was uncommonly lanky, and his legs and arms seemed to go like the wings of a windmill. Never, since the day of his birth, had Davy Butts run at such a pace, in such light clothing, and in such severe frost!  A long line of low hummocks hid him from the brig.  The moment he passed these he came in sight of her and began to yell.  \"Wot on airth is yon?\" exclaimed Joe Davis, who chanced to be looking over the gangway when this remarkable object appeared.  \"The wild man o' the North himself, or my name aint Jim,\" said Crofts, turning pale.  \"Why, it's Davy Butts, I do believe,\" cried Sam Baker, who came on deck at that moment.  Just then the bear came tearing round the end of the hummocks in full chase.  \"Hurrah! hallo! ho!\" roared the men, who had crowded on deck at the first note of alarm.  Sam Baker seized a heavy ash handspike about five feet long, and was on his way to meet his comrade before the others had gained the ice.  They were not slow, however.  Some with muskets, some with pistols and cutlasses, and some with nothing but their fists--all followed Sam, who was now far ahead.  Baker passed Davy without a remark, and ran straight at the bear, which stopped on seeing such a big, powerful man running so furiously at him, and flourishing a bludgeon that would almost have suited the hand of a giant.  But polar bears are not timid.  He rose on his hind legs at once, and paid no attention whatever to the tremendous crack that Sam dealt him over the skull.  The blow broke the handspike in two, and the fool-hardy seaman would soon have paid for his rashness with his life had not friendly and steady hands been near.  Nothing daunted, he was about to repeat the blow with the piece of the handspike that was still in his grasp, and the bear was about to seize him with its claws, each of which were full two inches long, when the first mate and Gregory came running toward him, side by side, the first armed with a rifle, the doctor with pistols.  \"Too late,\" gasped Gregory.  \"We must fire,\" said Mansell, \"and risk hitting Sam.  Here, doctor, you are a good shot; take the rifle.\"  The young man obeyed, dropped on one knee, and took aim, but did not fire.  Sam was between him and the bear.  A sudden movement changed their positions.  The side of the monster came into view, and in another instant it was stretched on the ice with a bullet in his brain.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  A GREAT BATTLE WITH THE WALRUS.  It need scarcely be said that there was a jovial feast that night at supper.  The bear's tongue was cooked after all, but the impudent tongues of the party were not silenced, for they almost worried the life out of poor Davy for having run away from a bear.  Soon after this event the preparations for spending the winter were completed; at least as far as the fitting up of the vessel was concerned.  \"This morning,\" writes Gregory, in his journal, \"we finished housing over our Arctic home.  The _Hope_ is very snug, lined with moss, and almost covered with snow.  A sail has been spread over the quarter-deck like an awning; it is also covered with moss and snow.  This, we hope, will give much additional warmth to our house below.  We all live together now, men and officers.  It will require our united strength to fight successfully against that terrible enemy, John Frost.  John is king of the Arctic regions, undoubtedly!  \"Dawkins got a cold-bath yesterday that amused the men much and did him no harm.  For some time past we have been carrying moss from the island in large bundles.  Dawkins got leave to help, as he said he was sick-tired of always working among stores.  He was passing close to the fire-hole with a great bundle of moss on his back, when his foot slipped, and down he went.  This hole is kept constantly open.  It is Baker's duty night and morning to break the ice and have it ready in case of fire.  The ice on the surface was therefore thin; in a moment nothing was to be seen of poor Dawkins but his bundle!  Fortunately he held tight on to it, and we hauled him out, soaked to the skin.  The thermometer stood at 35 degrees below zero, the coldest day we have had up to this time; and in two minutes the unfortunate man's clothes were frozen so stiff that he could scarcely walk!  We had to break the ice on his legs and arms at the joints, and even then he had to be half hoisted on board and carried below.  We all dress in seal-skin and fox-skin garments now.  Dawkins had on a rough coat, made of white and grey foxes; trousers of the same; boots of seal-skin, and mittens ditto. When all this was soaked and frozen he was truly a humbling sight!  \"The undressing of him was a labour of difficulty as well as of love. However, when he was rubbed dry, and re-clothed, he was none the worse. Indeed, I am inclined to think he was much the better of his ducking.  \"To-morrow we are to make some curious experiments with boats, sledges, and kites.  The captain is anxious to take our largest boat over the ice as far to the south as possible, and leave her there with a quantity of provisions, so that we may have her to fall back upon if any misfortune should befall the brig, which I earnestly pray that God may forbid.  \"Davy Butts, who is an ingenious fellow in his way, says that we can sail a boat on the ice almost as well as on the water, and that we may drag sledges by means of kites, if we choose.  The captain means to attempt a journey to the north with sledges in spring, so, if the kites answer, Butts will have done us good service.  But I have my doubts.  \"The nights are closing in fast; very soon we shall be without the sun altogether.  But the moon is cheering us.  Last night, (28th October) she swept in a complete circle round the sky _all day_ as well as all night.  She only touched the horizon, and then, instead of setting, she rose again, as if the frozen sea had frightened her.  \"_October 30th_.--Baker came in to-day and reported open water about six miles off, and walrus sporting in it.  I shall set out to-morrow on a hunt.\"  The hunt which the young doctor here wrote of came off the following day, but it was a very different one from what any of the men had expected.  Early in the morning, Baker, Davy Butts, and Gregory set off on foot, armed with a rifle and two muskets, besides a couple of harpoons, a whale-lance, and a long line.  They also took a small sledge, which was intended to be used in hauling home the meat if they should be successful.  Three hours' hard walking brought the party to the edge of the solid ice, after which they travelled on the floes that were being constantly broken by the tides, and were only joined together by ice of a night or two old.  This was little more than an inch thick, so they had to advance with caution.  Presently the loud mooing of a bull walrus was heard.  Its roar was something between the lowing of a bull and the bark of a large dog, but much louder, for the walrus resembles an elephant in size more than any other animal.  Soon after they came in sight of their game.  Five walrus were snorting and barking in a hole which they had broken in the ice. The way in which this huge monster opens a hole when he wants to get out of the sea is to come up from below with considerable violence and send his head crashing through the ice.  The three men now became very wary.  They crept on their hands and knees behind the ice-hummocks until within about a hundred yards of the brutes.  Then they ascended a small hummock to take a look round and decide on their plan of operations.  While lying there, flat on their faces, they took particular care to keep their heads well concealed, just raising them high enough to observe the position of the walrus. There was a sheet of flat ice between them and the hole, so that it was impossible to advance nearer without being seen.  This perplexed them much, for although their bullets might hit at that distance, they would not be able to run in quick enough to use their lances, and the harpoons would be of no use at all.  While thus undecided what to do, they were unexpectedly taught a lesson in walrus-hunting that surprised them not a little.  \"Hallo! there's a bear!\" whispered Davy Butts, as a hairy object crawled out from behind an ice-hummock about two hundred yards from the place where they lay, and made toward the walrus in a sly, cat-like manner.  \"More like a seal,\" observed Baker.  \"A seal! why, it's a _man_!\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23492"],["title","Fast in the Ice: Adventures in the Polar Regions (#8)"],["body",", in a low, excited whisper.  \"So it is, sure enough,\" said Baker; \"it must be an Eskimo, though his hairy garments make him look more like a bear than a man, and as the fellow has got here before us, I suppose we must give up our claim to the brutes.\"  \"Time enough to talk of that when the brutes are killed,\" said Gregory with a smile.  \"But lie still, lads.  We will take a lesson from this fellow, who has been so earnestly staring at the walrus that he has not noticed us.\"  The three men lay perfectly motionless watching the native, who crept as near to the hole as he could without being seen, and then waited for a few minutes until the creatures should dive.  This they were constantly doing; staying down a few moments at a time, and then coming up to breathe--for the walrus cannot live without air.  He is not a fish, and although he can stay down a long time, he _must_ come to the surface occasionally to breathe.  In this he resembles the seal and the whale.  Presently, down they all went with a tremendous splash.  Now was the moment! the Eskimo rose, ran at full speed for a few yards, then fell flat on his face, and lay quite still as if he had been shot dead.  The reason of this was soon apparent.  He understood the habits of the walrus, and knew that they would rise again.  This they did almost the moment after, and began their snorting, bellowing, and rolling again. Once more they dived.  Up got the Eskimo, ran a few yards further forward, and then fell flat down as before.  In this way he got near to the hole without being seen.  The watchers observed that he carried a harpoon and a coil of thick line.  The next time the walrus dived he ran to the edge of the hole, but now, instead of falling down, he stood quite still with the harpoon raised above his head ready to be thrown.  In a few moments the monsters reappeared.  Two rose close at the edge of the hole; one was a male, the other a female.  They were frightfully ugly to look at.  Shaking the water from his head and shoulders, the bull at once caught sight of the man who had thus suddenly appeared.  At that instant the Eskimo threw up his left arm.  This action, instead of frightening the brutes away, caused them to raise themselves high out of the water, in order to have a good look at the strange creature who had thus dared to disturb them in their watery home.  This was just what the native wanted.  It gave him a chance of driving the harpoon under the flipper of the male.  The instant this was done he caught up the end of his coil and ran quickly back to the full length of the line.  The battle that now begun was perhaps one of the fiercest that was ever fought in the Arctic regions.  The walrus lashed the water furiously for a second or two and dived.  This checked the native, who at once stopped running, drove the sharp point of a little piece of wood into the ice, and put the loop at the end of his line over it.  He pressed the loop close down to the ice with his feet, so that he could hold on when it tightened, which it did with great force.  But the line was a stout one. It had been cut from the hide of a walrus, and prepared in a peculiar way for the purpose of standing a heavy strain.  The Eskimo now played the monster as an angler plays a trout.  At one moment he held on, the next he eased off.  The line was sometimes like a bar of iron, then it was slackened off as the animal rose and darted about.  After this had happened once or twice the bull came to the surface, blowing tremendously, and began to bark and roar in great fury. The female came up at the same time.  She evidently meant to stick by her partner and share his danger.  The others had dived and made off at the first sign of war.  The wounded walrus was a little flurried and very angry; the female was not at all frightened, she was passionately furious!  Both of them tore up the ice tables with their great ivory tusks, and glared at their enemy with an expression that there was no mistaking.  The walrus is well known to be one of the fiercest animals in the world.  Woe to the poor native if he had been caught by these monsters at that time.  After some minutes spent in uselessly smashing the ice and trying to get at the native, they both dived.  Now came into play the Eskimo's knowledge of the animal's habits and his skill in this curious kind of warfare.  Before diving they looked steadily at the man for a second, and then swam under the ice straight for the spot where he stood.  The Eskimo of course could not see this, but he knew it from past experience.  He therefore changed his position instantly; ran a few yards to one side, and planted his stick and loop again.  This had hardly been done when the ice burst up with a loud crash; a hole of more than fifteen feet wide was made on the exact spot which the man had quitted, and the walrus appeared with a puff like that of a steam-engine, and a roar that would have done credit to a lion.  The great lumpish-looking heads and square-cut faces of the creatures looked frightful at this point in the fight.  There was something like human intelligence in their malicious and brutal faces, as the water poured down their cheeks and over their bristling beards, mingled with blood and foam.  At this moment there was a shout close at hand, and two other Eskimos ran out from behind the ice-hummocks and joined their comrade.  They were armed with long lances, the handles of which were made of bone, and the points of beautiful white ivory tipped with steel.  It was afterwards discovered that these natives obtained small pieces of iron and steel from the Eskimos further south, who were in the habit of trading at the settlements on the coast of Greenland.  The strangers at once ran to the edge of the pool and gave the bull walrus two deep wounds with their lances.  They also wounded the female. This seemed to render them more furious than ever.  They dived again. The first Eskimo again shifted his position, and the others ran back a short distance.  They were not a moment too soon in these changes, for the ice was again burst upward at the spot they had just quitted, and the enraged beasts once more came bellowing to the surface and vented their fury on the ice.  It may seem almost incredible to the reader, _but it is a fact_, that this battle lasted fully four hours.  At the end of the third hour it seemed to the sailors who were watching it, that the result was still doubtful, for the Eskimos were evidently becoming tired, while the monsters of the Polar seas were still furious.  \"I think we might help them with a butlet,\" whispered Baker.  \"It might frighten them, perhaps, but it would save them a good deal of trouble.\"  \"Wait a little longer,\" replied Gregory.  \"I have it in my mind to astonish them.  You see they have wounded the female very badly, but when the male dies, which he cannot now be long of doing, she will dive and make off, and so they'll lose her, for they don't seem to have another harpoon and line.\"  \"Perhaps they have one behind the hummocks,\" suggested Davy Butts, whose teeth were chattering in his head with cold.  \"If they had they would have used it long ago,\" said Gregory.  \"At any rate I mean to carry out my plan--which is this.  When the bull is about dead I will fire at the female and try to hit her in a deadly part, so as to kill her at once.  Then, Sam, you will run out with our harpoon and dart into her to prevent her sinking, or diving if she should not be killed.  And you, Davy, will follow me and be ready with a musket.\"  This plan had just been settled when the bull walrus began to show signs of approaching death.  Gregory therefore took a deliberate aim with the rifle and fired.  The result was startling!  The female walrus began to roll and lash about furiously, smashing the ice and covering the sea around with bloody foam.  At first the Eskimos stood motionless--rooted to the spot, as if they had been thunderstruck.  But when they saw Sam Baker dart from behind the hummock, flourishing his harpoon, followed by Gregory and Butts, their courage deserted them; they turned in terror and fled.  On getting behind the hummocks, however, they halted and peeped over the ledges of ice to see what the seamen did.  Sam Baker, being an old whaleman, darted his harpoon cleverly, and held fast the struggling animal.  At the same time Davy Butts seized the end of the line which the natives had thrown down in terror, and held on to the bull.  It was almost dead, and quite unable to show any more fight. Seeing that all was right, Gregory now laid down his rifle and advanced slowly to the hummock, behind which the Eskimos had taken refuge.  He knew, from the reports of previous travellers, that holding up both arms is a sign of peace with the Eskimos.  He therefore stopped when within a short distance of the hummocks and held up his arms.  The signal was understood at once.  The natives leaped upon the top of the hummock and held up their arms in reply.  Again Gregory tossed up his, and made signs to them to draw near.  This they did without hesitation, and the doctor shook them by the hand and patted their hairy shoulders. They were all of them stout, well-made fellows, about five feet seven or eight inches high, and very broad across the shoulders.  They were fat, too, and oily-faced, jolly-looking men.  They smiled and talked to each other for a few moments and then spoke to Gregory, but when he shook his head, as much as to say, \"I don't understand you,\" they burst into a loud laugh.  Then they suddenly became grave, and ran at full speed toward the hole where the walrus floated.  Davy Butts made the usual sign of friendship and handed them the end of their line, which they seized, and set about securing their prize without taking any farther notice of their new friends.  The manner in which these wild yet good-natured fellows hauled the enormous carcass out of the water was simple and ingenious.  They made four"]]]
