Street cars at this time were comparatively new in Philadelphia, and I think we reached the last extremity of Saxonism in speech when we spoke of them as \"folk wains.\" The tide then turned toward the Latins; and I preferred the Book of Job and the story of Ruth in the Latinized version, because the words were more mouth filling, and because it was very difficult to translate everything into a bald \"early English medium\", which for a time I had been trying to do. It was Keats's lovely phrase \"amid the alien corn\" which sent me back to \"Ruth\"; and a quotation in Quackenbos's \"Rhetoric\"--\"Can'st thou hook the Leviathan\" which made me revel in \"Job.\"  Something Meg Merrilies said bore me on toward the roaring storm of Isaiah. The Latinized medium seemed to suit his denunciations best; and then, besides, I found more illuminating footnotes in the Douai version than in the King James. In both versions, some passages were so obscure that I often wondered how anybody could get any meaning out of them. I was often astonished to find in English novels that the old people in the cottages were soothed by texts, quoted at a great length, out of which I could make nothing, so I limited myself to the Douai version, which I found more illuminating.  Whether my system of reading is to be commended or not to young persons, I am not prepared to say, but for me it made the Bible a really live book. To be frank, and perhaps shocking at the same time--if anybody had asked me whether, being marooned on an island, I should have most preferred the Bible in my loneliness, I should promptly have answered \"No.\" At this age \"Nicholas Nickleby\" or \"Midsummer Night's Dream,\" or \"The Tempest,\" or \"As You Like it,\" or Macaulay's \"Lays of Ancient Rome,\" would have suited me better, provided, of course, that I could have chosen only one book.  It was borne in on me many times that no author could improve on the phrasing of the Bible. Both in the Vulgate and the King James versions there are passages which, leaving aside all question of doctrine, it is sacrilege to try to improve. The French translation of the Bible is, as everybody knows, very paraphrastic, and that may account for the fact that, while regarded as a precious depository of doctrine, it is not a household book, and the dreadfully dull interpretations of Clement Marot--called hymns--naturally bored a people who, in their hearts, believe that God listens more amiably to petitions uttered in the language of the Academy! In their novels, dealing with the beginnings of Christianity--and there are many such novels in French unknown in other countries--it is hard for a French author not to be rhetorical, in the manner of the writer of \"Ben Hur\" when the death of Christ is described. No human author could improve on the words of the Vulgate, or the words of the King James version. What young heart can ponder over these words, without a thrill, St. John XIX (Douai version: 1609; Rheims; 1582):       When Jesus therefore had seen his Mother and the disciple standing      whom he loved, he saith to his Mother: Woman, behold thy son.       After that, he saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from      that day the disciple took her to his own.       Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,      that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.       Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar, and they, putting      a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop, put it to his mouth.       And Jesus therefore when he had taken the vinegar, said, it is      consummated, and bowing his head, gave up the ghost.  When Marie Corelli became a popular author, there were persons existing--happily, they have all gone to the great beyond--who thought that the \"talented\" author could have done better!   _Essays and Essayists_  I am aware that many persons look on Emerson as somewhat dangerous reading for a boy of sixteen. The mothers and fathers of my Baptist friends and the uncle of my Methodist cousins forbade the reading of Emerson because of his Unitarianism; but, as the rector of our parish never denounced Unitarians from the altar, though he frequently offered his compliments to Martin Luther, I paid no attention whatever to these objections. I trust that I am not defending the miscellaneous reading of my boyhood; I do not recommend this course to the approval of parents and guardians; I am simply expressing the impression that certain books made on my youthful mind and heart; for, though I never said so in words, the books I liked were always nearer to my heart than to my mind. I owe a great debt to Emerson.  It was on a hot afternoon during the summer vacation that, near sundown, sitting on the warm marble steps of our house, I dipped into an early edition of Emerson. I felt inspired at once to think great thoughts and to do good things, to lift myself above the petty things of the earth, and to feel that to be an American was to be at once proud and humble. Emerson's abrupt sentences, like a number of brilliants set close together, reminded me of \"Proverbs\"; but the Book of Proverbs did not get so near to my actual life as the essays of Emerson. I liked the lessons that he drew from the lives of great men. I was shocked when he mentioned Confucius and Plato in the same breath as Christ; but I was amiably tolerant, for I felt that he had never had the privilege of studying the Little Catechism, and I thought of writing to him on the subject. But somebody told me that he was an \"American Classic\" and, from that, I concluded he was dead, and had doubtless already found out his mistake.  Perhaps I might have been better engaged in reading the more practical books offered to boys in our own time, if we had had them. There were some books then on scientific subjects, reduced to the comprehension of the young; but not so many as there are now. One of my uncles recommended the works of Samuel Smiles--\"Self-Help\" I think was his favourite; but Samuel Smiles never appealed to me. My small allowance, paid weekly, could not have been affected by \"Thrift\", and when my uncle quoted passages from this tiresome book I astounded him by replying, in a phrase I wrongly attributed to the adorable Emerson, that if I had a quarter to spend instead of twelve cents, I would give half of it for a hyacinth! My miserly uncle said it sounded just like Mohammed, and that Emerson had doubtless found it in that dangerous book, the Koran.  I cannot imagine any other author doing for me just what the essays of Emerson did. In the first place, they seemed to me to be really American; in the second, and largely because of their quality, they offered an antidote to the materialism in the very air, which had succeeded the Civil War. At this time there was much talk of money and luxury everywhere about us. Even in our quiet neighbourhood, where simple living was the rule, many had burst into ostentation, and moved away into newer and more pretentious quarters, and there was a rumour that some of these sought unlimited opportunities for extravagant expenditure. We saw them driving in new carriages, and condescendingly stopping before the white doors and the green window-shutters of our old-fashioned colonial houses. They had made money through the war. For the first time in our lives we boys heard of money making as the principal aim of life. The fact that these successful persons were classed as \"shoddy\" did not lessen the value of the auriferous atmosphere about us. Emerson was a corrective to this materialism. As to his philosophy or theology, that did not concern me any more than the religious opinions of Julius CÃ¦sar, whose \"Commentaries\" I was obliged to read. Emerson gave me a taste for the reading of essay.  By chance I fell upon some essays of Carlyle. The inflation of his style did not deter me from thoroughly enjoying the paper on \"Novalis.\" That on \"Cagliostro,\" however, was my favourite. It introduced me intimately to the French Revolution. I disliked this great charlatan for his motto, \"Tread the lilies under foot.\" I was for the Bourbons! The French Revolution, as a fact, was very near to me. My mother had been born (in Philadelphia) in 1819, and my great-uncle and my grandfather had lived through the French Revolution. There was a legend, moreover--probably the same legend exists in every family of Irish descent whose connections had lived in France--that one of them had been a clerk to Fabre d'Eglantine, and had spent his time in crossing off the list of the condemned the names of the Irish-French aristocrats and substituting in their place others that did not happen to belong to Celts!  In spite of the Little Catechism and the uplifting influence of Emerson, I looked on this probably mythical gentleman as one of the glories of our family. And then there was an old man--very old--who walked up and down Sixth Street with his head wrapped in a bandanna handkerchief, bearing a parrot on his shoulder. The boys of the neighbourhood believed that he was Sanson, the executioner of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette. We shivered when we saw him; but we boasted of his existence in our neighbourhood, all the same. After I had read \"Cagliostro\" I devoured every line on the subject of the French Revolution I could find. It seemed to me that I would have been willing to give five years out of my life to have lived in Paris during those horrors, and to have rescued Marie Antoinette and the Princess Elizabeth! Such brutalities seemed impossible in our time; and yet I have since lived very near to friends who went through even greater horrors in Russia--the Baroness Sophie de Buxhoevenden, second lady-in-waiting to the Czarina, for instance, whose letters lie before me as I write.  In spite of my taste for Carlyle, which induced me to dip into Jean Paul"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24003"],["title","Confessions of a Book-Lover (#7)"],["body","hter, of whose writings I remember only one line,       I love God and little children,  I did not get very far into his \"French Revolution.\" It seemed then an unreal and lurid book.  Emerson led to Montaigne, whose essays, in an old edition which I had from the Mechanics' Institute, of which my father was a committeeman, delighted me beyond words. I liked Emerson's essay on \"Friendship\" better than his, but for wit, quick repartee, general cheerfulness, he reminded me of my favourite heroine in literature, Sir Walter Scott's Catherine Seton! Later, I read with astonishment that Montaigne was an unbeliever, a skeptic, almost a cynic. I was extremely indignant; he seemed to me to be a very pious gentleman, with that wit and humour which I seldom found in professedly pious books; and to this day I cannot hear Montaigne talked of as a precursor of Voltaire without believing that there is something crooked in the mind of the talker. So much for the impressions made in youth, so much for the long, long thoughts of which Longfellow sings.  Who is more amusingly cheerful than Montaigne, who more amusingly wise, who so well bred and attractive, who knew the world better and took it only as the world? Give me the old volume of Montaigne and a loaf of bread--no Victrola singing to me in the wilderness!--a thermos bottle, and one or two other things, and I can still spend the day in any wild place! I did not, of course, know, in those early days, what in his flavour attracted me. Afterward, I found that it was the very flavour and essence of Old France. Carlyle's impressions of historical persons interested me, but Montaigne was the most actual of living persons who spoke to me in a voice I recognized as wholly his. To be sure, I read him in Florio's translation.  I think it was about this time, too, that I discovered a very modern writer, who charmed me very greatly. It was Justin McCarthy who contributed a series of sketches of great men of the day to a magazine called the _Galaxy_. He \"did\" Victor Emmanuel and Pope Pius IX. and Bismarck, and many other of the worthies of the times. Nothing that he wrote before or after this pleased me at all; but these sketches were so interesting and apparently so true that they really became part of my life. If I had been asked at this time who was my favourite of all modern authors, and what the name of the composer I admired most, I should have said Justin McCarthy and Offenbach! I regarded \"Voici le Sabre\" in \"La Grande Duchesse\" as a masterpiece only to be compared to an \"Ave Verum,\" by Pergolesi, which was often sung in St. Philip's Church at the Offertory! A strange mixture, but the truth is the truth. Although I have not been able to find Justin McCarthy's series of sketches, they still hold a sweet place in my memory. Perhaps, like other masterpieces that one loves in youth, one would now find them like those beautiful creatures of the sea that seem to be vermilion and purple and gold under the waves, but are drab and ugly things when taken out of the water. This applies to some books that one reads with pleasure in early days, and wonders, later, how they were endured!  There were not so many outdoor books in the late '60's as there are now. We were all sent to Thoreau's \"Walden\" and Dana's \"Two Years Before the Mast.\" \"Walden\" I learned to like, but I much preferred Fenimore Cooper's description of nature. \"Walden\" struck me as the book of a man playing at out-of-doors, imagining his wildness, and never really liking to be too far from the town. Singularly enough, it was not until I discovered Hamerton's \"A Painter's Camp\" that I began to see that nature had beauties in all weathers. In truth, I hate to confess that nature alone never appealed to me. A landscape without human beings seemed deadly dull; and I did not understand until I grew much older that I had really believed that good art was an improvement on nature.  I have not the slightest idea in what light the modern critics see the works of Philip Gilbert Hamerton. I tried to read one of his novels recently, and failed; but let me say that, allowing for receptivity and what one may call temperament, I know of no book more revealing as to the relations of nature and art than \"A Painter's Camp.\" I recall vividly the words of the beginning of the preface to the first edition:       It is known to all who are acquainted with the present condition of      the fine arts in England that landscape-painters rely less on      memory and invention than formerly, and that their work from nature      is much more laborious than it used to be.  I had seen so many pictures that seemed to be \"made up\" in the artist's studio and I knew so well from my experience in the drawing classes at school, how nature was neglected for artificial models, that I hailed these words with great joy.  Everything in life was rather conventional, rather fixed, for the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, to which our country owes the beginning of the Ã¦sthetic awakening, had not yet taken place. It may seem strange to this generation that we were limited to the wood-cuts in Godey's _Lady's Book_, the illustrations in _Harper's Magazine_, and an occasional picture in some short-lived periodical. The reign of the chromo had just begun. Rogers's groups were a fixture in nearly every self-respecting house, though I am glad to say, in my own family, very good casts of the Clytie and the Discus-thrower filled their place. My father greatly admired Power's Greek Slave, whose praises had been celebrated in the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_; but my mother regarded it as almost \"improper.\"  Nearly every youth of my generation, in Philadelphia, wanted not exactly something better, but something more vivid. There were few sports; long walks and a little cricket supplied the place of the coming baseball and tennis.  In his \"Steeplejack,\" James Huneker speaks of his weekly walks with Mr. Edward Roth, the head of a military school and the author of \"Christus Judex.\" I, too, looked on these walks with an occasional row on the Schuylkill with him as the best part of my education. But this was later. All we could do, then, in our moments of leisure, was to walk and talk and read.  The cult of the out-of-doors had not yet begun to be developed. The beginning of \"A Painter's Camp\" was most attractive to my thirsty soul. Mr. Hamerton says:       I had a wild walk yesterday. I have a notion of encamping on the      Boulsworth moors to study heather; and heartily tired of being      caged up here in my library, with nothing to see but wet      garden-walks and dripping yew trees, and a sundial whereon no      shadow had fallen the livelong day, I determined, in spite of the      rain to be off to the moors to choose a site for my encampment. Not      very far from this house still dwells an old servant of my uncle's      with whom I am on the friendliest terms. So I called upon this      neighbour on my way and asked him if he would take a walk with me      to the hills. Jamie stared a little and remarked that \"it ur feefi      weet\" but accompanied me nevertheless, and a very pleasant walk we      had of it.  Hamerton opened his book in Jane Eyre's country; our family had lately read \"Jane Eyre.\" This added interest to the volume, and there came the details of the invention of the new hut, intended to be a shelter against all weathers, so that the artist might study nature on intimate terms. He made it in order to paint the heather at close range. Now, this was a revelation! It had never hitherto occurred to me that the heather changes its aspect day by day, or indeed that our pet place of beauty, the Wissahickon Creek, or river if you like, was not the same every day in the year except when the ice bound it! This may seem a rather stupid state of mind; but it is the stupidity that is very common. I could understand how interesting it would be to be in snow-fall while yet safely out of it. Mr. Hamerton thus described his hut:       It consists entirely of panels, of which the largest are two feet      six inches square: these panels can be carried separately on      packhorses, or even on men's backs, and then united together by      iron bolts into a strong little building. Four of the largest      panels serve as windows, being each of them filled with a large      pane of excellent plate-glass. When erected, the walls present a      perfectly smooth surface outside, and a panelled interior; the      floor being formed in exactly the same manner, with the panelled or      coffered side turned towards the earth, and the smooth surface      uppermost. By this arrangement all the wall-bolts are inside, and      those of the floor underneath it, which protects them not only from      the weather but from theft, an iron bolt being a great temptation      to country people on account of its convenience and utility. The      walls are bolted to the floor, which gives great strength to the      whole structure, and the panels are carefully ordered, like the      stones in a well-built wall, so that the joints of the lower course      of panels do not fall below those of the upper. The roof is arched      and provides a current of fresh air, by placing ventilators at each      end of the arch, which insures a current without inconvenience to      the occupant.  The chapters on \"Concerning Moonlight in Old Castles,\" \"The Coming of the Clouds,\" and the little sketches, like \"Loch Awe after Sunset, Sept. 23, 1860,\" enchanted me. It had not before struck me that Loch Awe was different on September 23, 1860, from what it was at other times, or--to carry the idea further--that the imperial Delaware had changed since that momentous time when George Washington crossed it, or the Schuylkill since Tom Moore looked upon it.  To quote further:       The mountain is green-grey, colder and greener towards the summit.      All details of field and wood are dimly visible. Two islands nearer"]]]
