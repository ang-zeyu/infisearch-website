He crossed the saloon, went down the companionway and through the second class cabin dining-room where the soldiers hailed him pleasantly, and, passing the stokers' washroom, tiptoed along the dim, narrow passageway.     CHAPTER X  HE GOES BELOW AND GROPES IN THE DARK   There were half a dozen or more staterooms along this passage. At the end of it was the steep, greasy flight of iron steps leading down into the engine-rooms. Here, also, was a huge box with a hinged lid, filled with cotton waste. It was customary for one going down here to take a handful of this waste to protect his hands from the oily rail, and also on coming up to wipe his hands with a fresh lot. The very atmosphere of a ship's engine-room is oily. Here, also, were several fire-buckets in a rack.  Along the side of the passage opposite the staterooms were electric bulbs at intervals, but only two of them were burning--just enough to light one through the narrow passage. Above each closed door was a solid wooden transom, hinged at its lower side and opened at an angle into the room.  Tom moved quickly and very quietly, for he feared to be caught loitering here. He saw at once that only one of these staterooms could possibly be used for any such criminal purpose as he suspected, and that was the one with a light directly opposite it in the passage, for the other light was beyond the staterooms.  For a few seconds he stood listening to the slow, monotonous sound of the machinery just below him. The vibration was very pronounced here; the floor thumped with the pulsations of the mighty engines. And Tom's heart was thumping too.  Within the staterooms all was dark and quiet. He knew the under engineers turned in early. Not the faintest flicker was to be seen through any of those transoms. He had been mistaken, he thought; had jumped at a crazy notion. And he half turned to go up again.  But instead he listened at the companionway, then tiptoed stealthily along the passage and looked over the oily iron rail, down, down into the depths of the great, dim, oil-smelling space with its iron galleries and the mammoth steel arms, moving back and forth, back and forth, far down there upon the grated floor. A tiny figure in a jumper went down from one of the lower galleries, paused to look at a big dial, then crossed the floor and disappeared, making never a sound. No other living thing was in sight--unless those mighty steel arms, ever meeting and parting might be said to be living. To come up from down there would mean the ascent of three iron stairways.  Tom withdrew into the passage and quietly lifting one of the fire-buckets from the rack, tiptoed with it to the door which was directly opposite the passageway.  Then he paused again. He could open that door, he knew, for no keys or bolts were allowed on any stateroom door. He could surprise the occupant, whom he would find in darkness. If his suspicion was correct (and he was beginning now to fear that it was not) there would be no actual proof of anything inside of that dark little room, save only just what the authorities had already found--an apparently innocent mess plate. The criminal act would consist of simply holding a shiny plate in a certain position. The moment a sound was heard outside the plate could be laid down. And who would be the wiser?  Tom's heart was thumping in his breast, his eyes anxiously scanning one end of the passage, then the other.  Not a sound--no sign of anyone.  Tom Slade had been a scout and notwithstanding his suspense and almost panicky apprehension, he was not going to act impulsively or thoughtlessly. He knew that if he could only present a convincing case to his superiors, they would forgive him his presumption. If he made a bungle it might go hard with him. Anyway, he could not, or would not, turn back now.  In truth, he did not believe that anything at all was going to happen. The stateroom was so dark and so still that all his fine ideas and deductions, which had seemed so striking and plausible up on the lonesome, wind-swept deck, began to fade away.  But there would be no harm in one little test, and no one would be the wiser. He tried to picture in his mind's eye the interior of that little stateroom. If it were like his own, then the mirror was on the other side of the passage wall, that is, on the opposite side of the stateroom from the port hole. If one looked into the mirror he would see the port hole. All of the smaller rooms below decks which he had seen were arranged in the same way.  Therefore, thought Tom, if one should hold a shiny mess plate, for instance, up near the transom, so as to catch the light from without, he could throw it down into the mirror, which would reflect not only the glare but the brilliant image of the bulb as well. From out on the ocean that reflected light would be very clear.  All of which, thought Tom dubiously, was a very pretty theory, but----  Without making a sound he placed the inverted bucket on the floor and listened. He put one foot on it and listened again. Then he stood upon it, his heart pounding like a triphammer.  Not a sound.  Probably the tired occupant of the room was fast asleep--sleeping the peaceful sleep of the innocent.  Tom knew that if his mind's eye picture of the room's arrangement were correct, the metal reflector would be of no avail unless tilted at a slight angle from the horizontal, right inside the transom.  For a moment he stood upon the bucket, not daring to budge. He could hear his own breathing, and far away the steady, dull thud of the tireless machinery. Something creaked in the passage, and he turned cold. He did not stir a muscle.  Only some superficial crevice or crack somewhere--some loose panel or worn hinge responding to the onslaught of a giant wave without---- Nothing----  He turned his head and looked down the passage, clenching his fists in momentary fright, as if he feared the bending of his neck might be heard.  No one. Not a sound.  He tried to look through the transom but his eyes were not high enough. For another second he paused. Then he reached through the transom and moved his hand about in the silence and darkness. He heard the cracking again and waited, trembling, though he knew it was nothing.  Then he groped about with his hand again.     CHAPTER XI  HE MAKES A DISCOVERY AND IS GREATLY AGITATED   Suddenly his hand encountered something hard and cold, and he grabbed it like lightning. His heart was in his throat now. There was a scuffling sound within and the object was wrenched and twisted and pulled frantically.  But Tom had been a scout and he was prepared. The two big clumsy hands which bore the captain's tray back and forth each day had once torn a pack of thirty cards in half to entertain tenderfeet at campfire. And one of those hands clutched this thing now with the grip of a bulldog.  His excitement and his pounding heart did not embarrass him in the brief tussle. A few dexterous twists this way and that, and he withdrew his hand triumphantly, scratched and bleeding, the light in the passage glinting upon the polished surface of the mess plate which he held.  Scarcely three minutes had escaped since he came down from the deck, but in that short period his usually sturdy nerves had borne a terrific strain and for a moment he leaned against the opposite side of the passage, clutching the dish in consternation.  In that brief moment when he had paused before putting his hand through the transom, he had thought that if indeed the plate were being held there even still the conspirator's eyes would be fixed upon the stationary mirror in order to keep the reflection centered in direct line with the porthole. Evidently he had been right and had taken the plotter quite unaware.  Sherlock Nobody Holmes had succeeded beyond his most extravagant dreams!  The door of the little room flew back and a figure stood in the dark opening, looking at him.  \"That--_that's_ what you meant,\" Tom stammered, scarcely knowing what he said, \"about the same idea as a periscope. You thought--you thought----\"  The man, evidently surprised at seeing no one but the captain's mess boy, stuck out his head and looked apprehensively up and down the passage.  \"There's nobody,\" breathed Tom, \"except me; but it won't do you any good--it won't--because I'm going to tell----\"  He paused, clutching the mess plate, and looked aghast at the disheveled, half-dressed man who faced him. Then the plate dropped from his hand, and a strange, cold feeling came over him.  \"Who are you?\" he gasped, his eyes stark and staring. \"I--I didn't know--I ain't----\"  He stopped, refusing to believe, and groped for the precious mess plate, part of the makeshift periscope which his own keenness had discovered and rendered useless. Then he stood again, fumbling the thing in his clumsy hands and staring, all bewildered, at the traitor who had used it to betray his country.  Was it----? It could not be---- But the years had wrought more change in Tom himself than in the man who stood there glaring back at him, half recognizing.  Yes, it _was_ his own brother, William Slade, who had left home so long ago!     CHAPTER XII  HE IS FRIGHTENED AND VERY THOUGHTFUL   And this was the triumph of Sherlock Nobody Holmes! This was the startling discovery with which he would astonish his superiors and win their approbation! It was not Sherlock Nobody Holmes who heard in a sort of daze the whispered words that were next uttered. It was just the captain's mess boy, and he hung his head, not so much in crushing disappointment as in utter shame.  \"Come inside here and keep still. How'd _you_ get on this ship? Nobody'll be hunting for you, will they? Come in--quick. What's the matter with you?\"  Still clutching the dish, Tom was dragged into that dark little room. He seemed almost in a trance.

The Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feasts   Excited the spleen of the Birds and the Beasts:   For their mirth and good cheer--of the Bee was the theme,   And the Gnat blew his horn, as he danced in the beam;   'Twas humm'd by the Beetle, 'twas buzz'd by the Fly,   And sung by the myriads that sport through the sky.   The Quadrupeds listen'd with sullen displeasure,   But the tenants of Air were enraged beyond measure.      The _Peacock_ display'd his bright plumes to the Sun,   And, addressing his Mates, thus indignant begun:  [Illustration]      \"Shall we, like domestic, inelegant Fowls,   As unpolish'd as Geese, and as stupid as Owls,   Sit tamely at home, hum-drum with our Spouses,   While Crickets and Butterflies open their houses?   Shall such mean little Insects pretend to the fashion?   Cousin Turkey-cock, well may you be in a passion!   If I suffer such insolent airs to prevail,   May Juno pluck out all the eyes in my tail!   So a Fête I will give, and my taste I'll display,   And send out my cards for St. Valentine's Day.\"      This determined, six fleet _Carrier-Pigeons_ went out   To invite all the birds to Sir Argus's Rout.   The nest-loving _Turtle-Dove_ sent an excuse;   _Dame Partlet_ lay in, as did good Mrs. _Goose_.   The _Turkey_, poor soul! was confined to the rip;[1]   For all her young brood had just fail'd with the pip.   The _Partridge_ was ask'd; but a Neighbour hard by   Had engaged a snug party to meet in a Pie:   And the _Wheat-ear_ declined, recollecting her Cousins,   Last year, to a feast were invited by dozens,--   But, alas! they return'd not; and she had no taste   To appear in a costume of vine-leaves or paste.   The _Woodcock_ preferr'd his lone haunt on the moor;   And the Traveller, _Swallow_, was still on his tour;   While the _Cuckoo_, who should have been one of the guests,   Was rambling on visits to other Birds' nests.   But the rest all accepted the kind invitation,   And much bustle it caused in the plumed creation.  [Illustration]      Such ruffling of feathers, such pruning of coats,   Such chirping, such whistling, such clearing of throats,   Such polishing bills, and such oiling of pinions,   Had never been known in the biped dominions!   The _Tailor-Bird_[2] offer'd to make up new clothes   For all the young Birdlings who wish'd to be Beaux:   He made for the _Robin_ a doublet of red,   And a new velvet cap for the _Goldfinch's_ head;   He added a plume to the _Wren's_ golden crest,[3]   And spangled with silver the _Guinea-Fowl's_ breast;   While the _Halcyon_[4] bent over the streamlet to view   How pretty she looked in her bodice of blue!  [Illustration]      Thus adorn'd, they set off for the Peacock's abode,   With the guide _Indicator_,[5] who show'd them the road:   From all points of the compass flock'd birds of all feather,   And the _Parrot_ can tell who and who were together.   There was Lord _Cassowary_[6] and General _Flamingo_,[7]   And Don _Peroqueto_, escaped from Domingo:   From his high rock-built eyrie the _Eagle_ came forth,   And the Duchess of _Ptarmigan_[8] flew from the North.   The _Grebe_ and the _Eider-Duck_ came up by water,   With the _Swan_, who brought out the young _Cygnet_, her Daughter.   From his woodland abode came the _Pheasant_, to meet   Two kindred, arrived by the last India fleet:   The one, like a Nabob, in habit most splendid,   Where Gold with each hue of the rainbow was blended;   In silver and black, like a fair pensive Maid   Who mourns for her love, was the other array'd.   The _Chough_[9] came from Cornwall, and brought up his Wife;   The _Grouse_ travell'd south, from his Lairdship in Fife;   The _Bunting_ forsook her soft nest in the reeds;   And the _Widow-Bird_[10] came, though she still wore her weeds:   Sir John _Heron_, of the Lakes, strutted in a _grand pas_.   But no card had been sent to the pilfering _Daw_,   As the Peacock kept up his progenitor's quarrel,   Which Æsop relates, about cast-off apparel;   For Birds are like Men in their contests together,   And, in questions of right, can dispute for a feather.  [Illustration]      The _Peacock_, Imperial, the pride of his race,   Received all his guests with an infinite grace,   Waved high his blue neck, and his train he display'd,   Embroider'd with gold, and with emeralds inlaid;   Then with all the gay troop to the shrubbery repair'd,   Where the musical birds had a concert prepared.      A holly-bush form'd the Orchestra, and in it   Sat the _Black-bird_, the _Thrush_, the _Lark_, and the _Linnet_;   A _Bullfinch_, a captive almost from the nest!   Now escaped from his cage, and with liberty blest,   In a sweet mellow tone, join'd the lessons of art   With the accents of nature, which flow'd from his heart.   The _Canary_, a much-admired foreign musician,   Condescended to sing to the Fowls of condition;   While the _Nightingale_ warbled and quaver'd so fine,   That they all clapp'd their wings and declared it divine!   The _Sky-Lark_, in ecstasy, sang from a cloud,   And _Chanticleer_ crow'd, and the _Yaffil_[11] laugh'd loud.  [Illustration]      The dancing began when the singing was over:   A _Dotterel_ first open'd the ball with the _Plover_;   Baron _Stork_ in a waltz was allow'd to excel,   With his beautiful partner, the fair _Demoiselle_;[12]   And a newly-fledged _Gosling_, so fair and genteel,   A minuet swam with the spruce Mr. _Teal_.   A London-bred _Sparrow_--a pert forward Cit!   Danced a reel with Miss _Wagtail_ and little _Tom Tit_.   And the Sieur _Guillemot_[13] next perform'd a _pas seul_,   While the elderly bipeds were playing a pool.  [Illustration]    The Dowager Lady _Toucan_[14] first cut in,   With old Doctor _Buzzard_ and Admiral _Penguin_;   From Ivy-bush tower came down _Owlet_ the Wise,   And Counsellor _Cross-bill_[15] sat by to advise.   Some birds past their prime, o'er whose heads it was fated   Should pass many St. Valentines--yet be unmated,   Sat by, and remark'd that the prudent and sage   Were quite overlook'd in this frivolous age,   When birds, scarce pen-feather'd, were brought to a rout,   Forward Chits! from the egg-shell but newly come out.   In their youthful days, they ne'er witness'd such frisking;   And how wrong in the _Greenfinch_ to flirt with the _Siskin_![16]   So thought Lady _Mackaw_, and her friend _Cockatoo_;   And the _Raven_ foretold that no good could ensue!   They censured the _Bantam_, for strutting and crowing   In those vile pantaloons, which he fancied look'd knowing:   And a want of decorum caused many demurs   Against the _Game Chicken_, for coming in spurs.  [Illustration]      Old Alderman _Cormorant_, for supper impatient,   At the Eating-room door for an hour had been station'd,   Till a _Magpie_, at length, the banquet announcing,   Gave the signal, long-wish'd for, of clamoring and pouncing:   At the well-furnish'd board all were eager to perch,   But the little Miss _Creepers_ were left in the lurch.  [Illustration]      Description must fail, and the pen is unable   To recount all the luxuries that cover'd the table.   Each delicate viand that taste could denote,   Wasps _à la sauce piquante_, and Flies _en compôte_;   Worms and Frogs _en friture_, for the web-footed Fowl,   And a barbecued Mouse was prepared for the Owl;   Nuts, grains, fruit, and fish, to regale every palate,   And groundsel and chickweed served up in a salad.   The _Razor-bill_[17] carved for the famishing group,   And the _Spoon-bill_[18] obligingly ladled the soup;   So they fill'd all their crops with the dainties before 'em   And the tables were clear'd with the utmost decorum.      When they gaily had caroll'd till peep of the dawn,   The _Lark_ gently hinted 'twas time to be gone;   And his clarion, so shrill, gave the company warning,   That _Chanticleer_ scented the gales of the morning,   So they chirp'd in full chorus, a friendly adieu;   And, with hearts beating light as the plumage that grew   On their merry-thought bosoms, away they all flew.      Then long live the _Peacock_, in splendour unmatch'd,   Whose Ball shall be talk'd of by Birds yet unhatch'd!   His praise let the _Trumpeter_[19] loudly proclaim,   And the _Goose_ lend her quill to transmit it to Fame.      [1] _The Rip._ A machine used in poultry-yards, under which it is        usual to confine the mother-bird with the young brood, till it        has acquired strength to follow her. The word is derived from        the Saxon _Hrip_, meaning a covering, or protection, for the        young.     [2] _The Tailor-Bird._ So called from the singular manner in which        it constructs its nest, which is composed of two leaves, sewed        together with wonderful skill by the little tailor, whose bill        serves him for a needle, and the fine fibres of leaves furnish        him with a substitute for thread, by which means he attaches a        dead leaf to a living one, growing at the end of a branch. The        Tailor-Bird is an inhabitant of India.     [3] _The Golden-crested Wren_ is the smallest of the British Birds;        it takes its name from a circle of gold-coloured feathers,        bordered with black, forming an "]]]
