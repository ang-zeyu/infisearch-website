On their return with some of the inhabitants, the Spaniards were surprised to see them roll up the dried leaves of a plant which they called \"tobacco,\" and smoke it with a satisfaction which the voyagers could not comprehend, as it appeared to them an unsavoury nauseous indulgence, little dreaming what determined smokers their descendants would become.  The envoys described the country as fertile in the extreme, the fields produced pepper, sweet potatoes, maize, pulse, and yuca, while the trees were laden with tempting fruits of delicious flavour.  There was also a vast quantity of cotton,--some just growing, some in full growth,--while the houses were stored with it partly wrought into yarn and nets.  Columbus was, by the misapprehension of terms, led into many errors. Bohio, meaning simply \"a house,\" and therefore signifying a populous island, was frequently applied to Hispaniola.  His great object, however, was to reach some civilised country of the East with which he might establish commercial relations, and carry home its Oriental merchandise as a rich trophy of his discovery.  Besides Bohio, he had heard of another island called Babique, of which he now sailed in search, hoping that it might prove some civilised island on the coast of Asia.  Shortly afterwards he altered his course east-south-east, following back the direction of the coast, and thus did not discover his mistake in supposing Cuba to be a part of _terra firma_, an error in which he continued to the day of his death.  Some time was spent in cruising about an archipelago of small and beautiful islands, which has since afforded a lurking-place for piratical craft.  In attempting to reach the supposed land of Babique, he met with a contrary gale, which compelled him to put about, when he made signals to the other vessels to do likewise.  The _Pinta_ did not obey him, and when morning dawned was nowhere to be seen.  This circumstance disturbed Columbus, who had reason to fear that Pinzon, jealous of his success, intended to prosecute the discovery by himself, or to return to Spain with an account of the success of the enterprise.  Finding that Pinzon did not rejoin him, he returned to Cuba, and continued for several days sailing along the coast.  Again and again he was struck with the magnificence of the scenery and size of the trees, out of a single trunk of which canoes were formed, capable of holding one hundred and fifty people.  On the 5th of December he reached the eastern end of Cuba, and then steering large, away from it, he discovered land to the south-east.  On approaching, he saw high mountains towering above the horizon, and found that it was an island of great extent, being Hagi or Hispaniola.  Again his native friends exclaimed, \"Bohio!\"--by which they meant to say that it was thickly populated, though, as he understood the expression, that it abounded with gold.  He was struck with the unrivalled beauty of its scenery.  On the following day he entered a harbour at the western end, which he called Saint Nicholas.  It was deep and spacious, surrounded by trees, many of them loaded with fruit.  Sailing again, he entered another harbour, called Port Concepcion, now known as the Bay of Moustique.  Wishing to open an intercourse with the natives, he sent six well-armed men into the interior.  The people fled, but the sailors captured a young female who was perfectly unclothed,--a bad omen as to the civilisation of the island,--but an ornament of gold in her nose gave hope that the precious metal might be found there.  The Admiral soothed her terror by presenting her with beads, brass rings,--hawks' bells, and other trinkets, and sent her on shore clothed, accompanied by several of the crew and three Indian interpreters.  She would, however, willingly have remained with the native women she found on board.  The party were afraid of venturing to the village, and, having set her at liberty, returned to the ship.  The following morning nine well-armed men, with an interpreter from Cuba, again landed and approached a village containing a thousand houses, but the inhabitants had fled.  The interpreter, however, overtook them, and telling them that the strangers had descended from the skies, and went about the world making beautiful presents, they turned back to the number of a thousand, approaching the Spaniards with slow and trembling steps, making signs of profound reverence.  While they were conversing another large party of Indians approached, headed by the husband of the female captive, whom they brought in triumph on their shoulders.  The husband expressed his gratitude for the magnificent presents bestowed on his wife.  The Indians, now conducting the Spaniards to their houses, set before them a banquet of cassava bread, fish, roots, and fruits of various kinds.  They presented also numbers of tame parrots, freely offering, indeed, whatever they possessed.  Delighted as they were with all they saw, the Spaniards still bitterly complained that they found no signs of riches among the natives.  Nature abundantly supplying all they required, they were without even a knowledge of artificial wants, and so unbounded was their hospitality, that they were ready to bestow everything they possessed on their guests.  The fertile earth producing all they required, they preferred to live in that Arcadian state of simplicity which poets have delighted to picture.  Their fields and gardens were without hedges or divisions of any sort.  They were kind to each other, and required no magistrates nor laws to keep them in order.  Alas! how soon was this happy state of existence to be destroyed by the cruel, avaricious, and profligate Spaniards.  Unlike their pious, high-minded, and sagacious chief, they resembled the bloodhounds they were wont to let loose in chase of their victims.  How different might have been the fate of the islands had such men as the pilgrim fathers or the enlightened Penn been the first to settle among them!  The bright light of true Christianity might have beamed on their hearts, with all the advantages of civilisation, and far greater happiness than they had hitherto enjoyed might have been their lot.  No blame can be attached to Columbus, no slur can be cast on his fair fame. He had achieved a glorious undertaking in discovering a new world, but on its inhabitants he had been thus the instrument of bringing the direst of curses, and, instead of promulgating the faith he professed, the blackest disgrace on the Christian name.

After a brief stay among the happy and simple-minded natives, the weather becoming favourable, Columbus again attempted to discover the island of Babique.  On his way he fell in with an island, to which, on account of the number of turtles seen there, he gave the name of Tortugas.  Meeting with contrary winds, he returned to Hispaniola, and on the way fell in with an Indian in a canoe.  Having taken the man and his frail barque on board, he treated him kindly and set him on shore at Hispaniola, near a river known as Puerto de Paz.  The Indian gave so favourable a report of the treatment he had received, that a cacique in the neighbourhood, and some of his people, visited the ships.  They were handsomer than any yet met with, and of a gentle and peaceable disposition.  Several of them wore ornaments of gold, which they readily exchanged for trifles.  Another young cacique shortly afterwards appeared, carried on a litter borne by four men, and attended by two hundred of his subjects.  He was received on board, and, Columbus being at dinner, he came down with two of his councillors, who seated themselves at his feet.  He merely tasted whatever was given to him, and then sent it to his followers.  Dinner being over, he presented to the Admiral two pieces of gold, and a curiously-worked belt, evidently the wampum still employed by the North American Indians as a token of peace.  Columbus, in return, gave him a piece of cloth, several amber beads, coloured shoes, and, showing him a Spanish"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],["title","Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#6)"],["body","with the heads of the King and Queen, endeavoured to explain to him the power and grandeur of his sovereigns, as well as the standard of the cross; but these apparently failed to have any effect on the mind of the savage chieftain.  Columbus also had a large cross erected in the centre of the village, and, from the respect the Indians paid to it, he argued that it would be easy to convert them to Christianity.  Again sailing on the 20th of December, the expedition anchored in the Bay of Acul.  Here the inhabitants received them with the greatest frankness.  They appeared to have no idea of traffic, but freely gave everything they possessed, though Columbus ordered that articles should be given in exchange for all received.  Several caciques came off, inviting the Spaniards to their villages. Among them came an envoy from an important chief named Guacanagari, ruling over all that part of the island.  Having presented a broad belt of wampum and a wooden mask, the eyes, nose, and tongue of which were of gold, he requested that the ships would come off the town where the cacique resided.  As this was impossible, owing to a contrary wind, Columbus sent the notary of the squadron, with several attendants.  The town was the largest and best built they had yet seen.  The cacique received them in a large, clean square, and presented to each a robe of cotton, while the inhabitants brought fruits and provisions of various sorts.  The seamen were also received into their houses, and presented with cotton garments and anything they seemed to admire; while the articles given in return were treasured up as sacred relics.  Several caciques had in the meantime visited the ships.  They mentioned a region, evidently the interior, called Cibao, which Columbus thought must be a corruption of Cipango, and whose chief he understood had banners of wrought gold, and was probably the magnificent prince mentioned by Marco Polo.  As soon as the wind was fair, Columbus visited the chief, Guacanagari, the coast having been surveyed by boats the previous day.  Feeling perfectly secure, although so near the coast, he retired to his cabin. The helmsman handed over his charge to one of the ship's boys, and failed to notice that breakers were ahead.  Suddenly the ship struck; the master and crew rushed on deck.  Columbus, calm as usual, ordered the pilot to carry out an anchor astern.  Instead of so doing, in his fright, he rowed off to the other caravel, about half a league to windward.  Her commander instantly went to the assistance of his chief. The ship had meantime been drifting more and more on the reef, the shock having opened several of her seams.  The weather continued fine, or she must at once have gone to pieces.  The Admiral, having gone on board the caravel, sent envoys to Guacanagari, informing him of his intended visit and his disastrous shipwreck.  When the cacique, who lived a league and a half off, heard of the misfortune, he shed tears, and sent a fleet of canoes to render assistance.  With their help the vessel was unloaded, the chief taking care that none of the effects should be pilfered.  Not an article was taken; indeed, the people exhibited the greatest sympathy with their guests, who were treated with the utmost hospitality.  Two days afterwards Guacanagari came on board the _Nina_ to visit the Admiral, and, with tears in his eyes, offered him all he possessed. While he was on board a canoe arrived with pieces of gold, and, on observing his countenance light up, the cacique told him there was a place not far off, among the mountains, where it could be procured in the greatest abundance.  He called the place Cibao, which Columbus still confounded with that of Cipango.  Guacanagari, after dining on board, where he exhibited the utmost frankness, invited Columbus to his village.  Here he had prepared an abundant banquet, consisting of coneys, fish, roots, and various fruits. He afterwards conducted the Admiral to some beautiful groves, where a thousand natives were collected to perform their national games and dances.  In return, the Admiral sent on board for a Castilian accustomed to the use of the Moorish bow and arrows.  The cacique was greatly surprised at the skill with which the Castilian used his weapon, and told him that the Caribs, who made frequent descents on his territory, were also armed with bows and arrows.  Columbus promised his protection, and, to show his host the powerful means at his disposal, ordered a heavy cannon and an arquebus to be discharged.  At the report the Indians fell to the ground, as if they had been struck by a thunderbolt.  As they saw the shot shivering a tree, they were filled with dismay, until Columbus assured them that these weapons should be turned against their enemies.  The cacique now presented Columbus with a wooden mask, the eyes, ears, and other parts, of gold; and he also placed a golden crown on his head, and hung plates of gold round his neck.  The natives, though willing to receive anything in exchange for gold, were chiefly delighted with the hawks' bells, dancing and playing a dozen antics as they listened to the sound.  An Indian gave even a handful of gold for one of the toys, and then bounded away, fearing that the stranger might repent having parted so cheaply with such an inestimable a treasure.  The shipwrecked Spaniards, delighted with their idle life on shore, expressed their wish to remain on the island.  This, with the friendly behaviour of the natives, induced Columbus to agree to their proposal.  He considered that they might explore the island, learn the language and manners of the natives, and procure by traffic a large amount of gold.  He resolved also to build a fortress for their defence, to be armed with the guns saved from the wreck.  With his usual promptness he had the work commenced.  When Guacanagari heard that some of the Spaniards were to be left on the island for its defence from the Caribs, he was overjoyed, as were his subjects, who eagerly lent their assistance in building the fortress, little dreaming that they were assisting to place on their necks the galling yoke of slavery.  While the work of the fortress was rapidly going on, Guacanagari treated the Admiral with princely generosity.  As Columbus, on one occasion, was landing, the cacique met him, accompanied by five tributary chiefs, each carrying a coronet of gold.  On arriving at his house, Guacanagari took off his own crown and placed it on the head of the Admiral.  Columbus presented, in return, a collar of fine coloured beads, his mantle of cloth, a pair of coloured boots, and placed on his finger a large ring of silver, which the Indians valued far more than gold.  The cacique also exerted himself to procure a great quantity of gold.  Columbus, by misunderstanding names and descriptions, formed the most magnificent idea of the wealth of the interior of the island, and even in the red pepper which abounded he fancied that he traced Oriental spices.  He was thus led to believe that the shipwreck was providential, as, had he sailed away, he should not have heard of its vast wealth. What in some spirits would have awakened a grasping and sordid cupidity to accumulate, immediately filled his vivid imagination with plans of magnificent expenditure.  To the fortress, which was of some size, and sufficiently strong to repulse a naked and unwarlike people, Columbus gave the name of La Navidad, in memory of having escaped shipwreck on Christmas Day.  He considered it very likely to prove most useful in keeping the garrison themselves in order, and to prevent them wandering about and committing acts of licentiousness among the natives.  Of the numbers who volunteered he selected thirty-nine in all, among whom was a physician, a ship's carpenter, a cooper, a tailor, and a gunner; the command being given to Diego de Arana, notary and alguazil of the armament, with Pedro Gutierrez and Rodrigo de Escobedo as his lieutenants, directing them to obtain all the information in their power.  He charged the garrison to be especially circumspect in their intercourse with the natives,--to treat them with gentleness and justice,--to be highly discreet in their conduct towards the Indian females, and, moreover, not to scatter themselves, or on any account stray beyond the friendly territory of Guacanagari.  On the 2nd of January, 1493, Columbus bade farewell to the generous cacique and his chieftains, commending those he left behind to their care.  To impress the Indians with an idea of the warlike prowess of the white man, after a banquet he had given at his house, he ordered them to engage in mock fights with swords, bucklers, crossbows, arquebuses, and cannon.  Guacanagari shed tears as he parted with Columbus, who, returning on board, two days afterwards set sail, the garrison on shore answering the cheers of their comrades who were about to return to their native land. The ship, being towed out of the harbour, they stood to the eastward, but were detained for two days by a contrary wind.  On the 6th, a seaman aloft cried out that he saw the _Pinta_.  The certainty that he was right cheered the heart of the Admiral and his crew.  In a short time she approached, and, as the wind was contrary, Columbus put back to a little bay west of Monte Cristo, where he was followed by the _Pinta_.  Pinzon endeavoured to excuse himself, but Columbus discovered that he had purposely separated, and had gone to Hispaniola, where he had remained trading with the natives; collecting a considerable quantity of gold, the greater part of which he retained, and the rest divided among the men to secure his secret.  Columbus, however, knowing the number of friends the Pinzons had on board, repressed his indignation; but so much was his confidence in his confederates impaired, that, instead of continuing his explorations, as he hoped to have done when he first saw the _Pinta_, he resolved at once to sail for Spain.
