Instead of a quiet, dull brown, they were a garish shade that almost approached olive drab.  [Illustration]  Well, he thought, nothing's perfect. He shrugged into a harness and had his single suitcase attached to it; the harness and case were lightweight, too, and Charley headed for the station walking easily.  He climbed aboard the train and dropped his suitcase into the Automatic Porter, and then went to find a seat. The only one available was next to a middle-aged man chewing a cigar in a sour silence. Charley slipped into his seat without a word, and hoped the man would ignore him. He had a face like an overripe summer squash, and his big hands, clasped in his lap, were fat and white, covered with tiny freckles. Charley leaned back and closed his eyes.  A minute or so passed in silence.  Then a voice said: \"Heading for New York?\"  \"That's right,\" Charley said tiredly. He opened his eyes. The middle-aged man was leaning toward him, smelling of his cheap cigar.  \"Likewise,\" the man said. His voice was hoarse and unpleasant. \"I thought you might be.\"  \"That's right,\" Charley said. \"Long trip.\" He hoped desperately that the man would leave him alone. He wasn't on display now; he wanted the time to think, to try and figure out what had been happening. He had to have some questions to ask Professor Lightning, and that meant that he had to have some sort of plan of action.  \"Going to see that doctor,\" the middle-aged man said. \"That right?\"  \"That's right,\" Charley said. Apparently Professor Lightning had become a nine-day wonder; anyone going to New York was presumed to be going to see him.  Then Charley corrected himself. Not anyone.  Any cripple.  \"Get the arms fixed, right?\" the middle-aged man said.  \"That's right,\" Charley said for the third time. Maybe the man would take the hint.  But he had no such luck. \"That's a fine thing the doctor is doing,\" he said. \"I mean, helping all these people. Don't have to be ... well, look, bud, don't take me personally.\"  \"I don't mind,\" Charley said. \"I'm used to it.\"  \"Sure,\" the man said. \"Hey, by the way. My name's Roquefort. Al Roquefort.\"  \"Charley de Milo,\" Charley said.  \"Glad to know you,\" the man said. \"So while we're traveling companions, you might say ... might as well get to be friendly.\"  \"Sure,\" Charley said tiredly. He looked round the car. A great many people seemed to be heading East. There were no other seats. Charley sighed and shrugged himself deeper into the upholstery.  \"You know,\" Roquefort said suddenly, \"I can't help thinking.\"  \"Oh?\" Charley said, fidgeting his feet.  \"That's right,\" Roquefort said. \"I mean, all these people. And Dr. Schinsake. I remember once, I went to a circus, or a sideshow.\"  \"Carnival, probably,\" Charley put in, knowing exactly what was coming.  \"Something like that,\" Roquefort said. \"Anyhow, they had this sideshow, and there was a man there without any legs. Did all kinds of tricks--got along real good. But I can't help thinking now: he wouldn't have to get along that way any more. Because this doctor would fix him up.\"  \"I guess so,\" Charley said wearily.  \"Sure,\" Roquefort said. \"It's a great thing, what he's doing. All these freak shows ... you understand, it's just a name for them--\"  \"I understand,\" Charley said. \"Don't worry about it.\" He shifted his feet nervously. Shoes always felt a little uncomfortable, even lightweight sandals; he felt trapped in them. Now, if he had arms and hands ...  He choked the thought off before it got any further.  \"All these shows,\" Roquefort said, \"why, there isn't any need for them any more. I mean the people without legs, or arms, anyhow. See? Because this doctor--\"  \"I see,\" Charley said.  \"Why, anybody works in a show like that, I mean without arms or legs--why, he's just crazy, that's all. When he can get help, I mean.\"  \"Sure,\" Charley said uneasily. \"Sure, he's just crazy.\"  Roquefort chomped on his cigar and looked solemn and well-informed. Charley shivered slightly, and wondered why.  \"Just crazy.\" Was that what they thought, he wondered. Was that what they were thinking when they looked up at him?  He shivered again and slipped his shoes off quietly. Immediately, he felt a little better.  But not very much.         *       *       *       *       *  New York was a madhouse worse than any carnival Charley had ever seen. He made his way, harness and suitcase on his back, through the station crowds and out into the taxi ramp. A line of the new cabs stood there, and Charley managed to grab one inches ahead of a woman with a small, crying child in tow. He gestured to the driver with his head, and the door slid open. He stepped inside, released the catch that let his suitcase thump to the floor, and sat down with a sigh.  \"Tough, hey?\" the cabbie said. His glowing nameplate read _David Peters Wells_. He turned around, showing a face that had little in common with the official license photo, under his name. He was swarthy and short, with large yellowing teeth and tiny eyes. \"Where to, Mac?\" he said.  Charley licked his lips. \"I really don't know,\" he said.  The cabbie blinked. \"What?\"  \"I'm going to need some help,\" Charley said. \"I want to find a Dr. Schinsake, but I don't know where he is. If you can drive me to a drugstore, where we can look him up in a phone book--\"  \"Dr. Schinsake?\" the driver said. \"That's the guy who grows things? I mean, arms and legs? Like that?\"  \"That's right,\" Charley said.  \"O.K., buddy,\" the driver said. \"Just hang on.\" The cab started with a cough and a roar, and shot out of the terminal like a bazooka shell. Over the noise of travel, the cabbie said: \"Going to get yourself fixed up? No offense, Mac.\"  \"No offense,\" Charley said. \"I'm just going to talk to him.\"  \"Oh,\" the cabbie said. \"Sure.\" There was silence for a second. Then the cabbie turned around. The machine shot ahead, down a wide avenue filled with cars. Charley took a deep breath and forgot to let it go. \"You know,\" the cabbie said, \"I seen something funny the other day.\"  \"Really?\" Charley said, through clenched teeth.  The cabbie turned back casually, flicked the wheel to avoid an oncoming truck, and continued: \"Funny, yeah. Went to the Flea Museum ... you know, the sideshow here, on Forty-second?\"  \"I know it,\" Charley said. He'd been offered winter work in the place several times, though he'd never accepted. Everyone in carny life knew of the place.  \"And, anyhow, I went down the other day, and there was this guy ... he was like you, Mac, I mean no arms. You don't mind me talking about it?\"  Apparently everybody thought he was sensitive on the subject, Charley reflected tiredly. \"I don't mind,\" he said.  \"Sure,\" the cabbie said. A red light showed ahead and the cab screeched to a halt. \"Anyhow, there he was, like a freak, you know? Hell, Mac, I was mad. I mean mad. The guy wants me to pay money to see him; he don't want to go get cured. He's like lazy, Mac. Lazy. Wants to sit around and let me pay money I work hard for, like some kind of a stuffed exhibit he thinks he is.\" The light changed; the cab shuddered and moved on. \"And this doctor right here in the same city. Now, what do you think of that?\"  Charley shrugged. \"I wouldn't know,\" he said cautiously. He took out a cigarette with his left foot, lit it with his right, and slid both feet back into his shoes. \"Nearly there?\" he asked.  \"No offense, Mac,\" the cabbie said, sounding obscurely troubled. \"We're there in a minute.\" He turned and stared narrowly at Charley. The cab shot blindly on. \"Say, listen. That with the cigarette. You belong to some kind of sideshow? I mean, no offense--\"  \"No offense,\" Charley said. \"That's right. I'm with a carnival.\"  \"We'll, you're doing the right thing,\" the cabbie said, turning back to the road again. Amazingly, there was no obstruction before them. \"I mean, a guy has to be honest. With this doctor around, you can't be a no-arms guy any more; it's not fair. Right?\"  Charley licked his lips. The cab stopped.  \"Here we are,\" the driver announced.  Charley indicated his grouch-bag, still heavy with dollar bills, hanging round his neck. With scrupulous care, the driver extracted one bill. \"Keep the change,\" Charley said. \"And thanks for the conversation.\"  He stepped out, hooking the suitcase to his harness as he did so. And there, in front of him, was a small white-faced stone building. The cab roared away behind him, and Charley started across the sidewalk.  Now, in New York, he had found out what he was going to ask Professor Lightning. And it was the one thing he hadn't thought possible.         *       *       *       *       *  One flight of stairs led straight up from the doorway, and Charley took it slowly. At the top was a great wooden door with a brass plate screwed to it, and on the brass plate a single name was incised: _Dr. E. C. Schinsake_. There was nothing else. Charley slipped the shoe off his right foot, and rang the bell.  A voice inside said: \"Who's there? Who is it, please?\"  \"It's me, professor,\" Charley called. He slipped the sandal back on. \"Charley de Milo. I came to see you.\"  \"Charley--\" There was a second of silence. \"Charley de Milo?\" Professor Lightning's grating voice said. \"From the show?\" Footsteps came across a room, and the door swung open. Professor Lightning stood inside, just as tall and white-haired as ever, and Charley blinked, looking at him, and past him at the room.  People didn't live in rooms like that, he thought. They were only for the movies, or maybe for millionaires, but not for people, real people that Charley himself knew to talk to.  The furniture--a couch, a few chairs and tables, a phonograph--was glitteringly new and expensive-looking. The walls were freshly painted in soft, bright colors, and pictures hung on them, strange-looking pictures Charley couldn't make sense out of. But they looked right, somehow, in that room.  On the floor"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23889"],["title","Charley de Milo (#5)"],["body","was a rug deeper and softer-looking than any Charley had ever seen. And, away to the right, two floor-length windows sparkled, hung with great drapes and shining in the daylight. There were flowers growing outside the sills, just visible above the window frames. Charley gulped and took a breath.  \"Come in,\" Professor Lightning said. \"Come in.\" In the midst of the riot of wealth, the professor didn't seem to have changed at all. He was still wearing the same ratty robe he'd worn in the carnival, his hair was still as uncombed. It was only on second glance that Charley saw the look in his eyes. Professor Lightning was Dr. Schinsake now; the eyes said that, and were proud of it. And the world agreed with Dr. Schinsake.  Charley came into the bright room and stood quietly until Dr. Schinsake asked him to sit down.  \"Well, now, my boy,\" he said. \"You haven't given me a word since you rang the bell, and I would like to know why you're here. Frankly, you're lucky to catch me in; but we were up late last night, working in the labs. I'm afraid I overslept a little.\" His eyes shone with the mention of his laboratories. It was a far cry from the back of the science tent, Charley supposed.  But he'd come for a definite purpose. He licked his lips, waited a second, and said: \"Professor, it's about my arms. What you said you could do.\"  \"Your arms?\" The old man frowned. \"Now? You've come to me ... Charley, my boy, tell me why. Tell me why you have changed your mind now.\"  Charley nodded. \"I ... I didn't start out here to ask you about my arms,\" he said. \"But on the way I started putting things together. Professor, why do people come to side-shows?\"  The old man shrugged. \"Entertainment,\" he said.  \"Sure, but there are all kinds of entertainment,\" Charley said. \"Like strong men. There used to be a lot of strong men in carnivals, but there aren't any more. And now I know why. Ed Baylis started to tell me, but I ... well, never mind.\"  \"Charley,\" the old man said. \"What do strong men have to do with--\"  \"Let me tell you, professor,\" Charley said. \"People don't care about strong men any more; there are too many gadgets around. Nobody has to be a strong man; nobody wants to watch one. They're useless. See?\"  \"Everyone can be his own strong man,\" the old man said.  \"Right,\" Charley said. \"The chain hoist--machines like that--they killed off the whole act. Years ago. And you've killed off the Armless Wonders and the Legless Wonders, professor. You've done it, all at once.\"  Professor Lightning shook his head. \"I don't see--\" he began.  \"Anybody can grow new arms,\" Charley said. \"So the man without arms--he's not an object of pity any more. He's just some guy who doesn't want to work. Nobody wants to go and see him; let him grow arms, if he doesn't want to be called a lazy bum. See?\"  There was a little silence.  \"I see,\" Professor Lightning said slowly. \"Without pity, without a strong sense of identification, there is no audience.\"  \"For me there isn't,\" Charley said. \"Or for anybody like me.\"  Professor Lightning nodded. \"Well,\" he said. \"I hardly meant to ... well, Charley, you came for something else.\" His face seemed to lengthen. \"And I must tell you ... Charley, I have been doing a lot of work. I am hardly a professional scientist; I have been away too long.\"  \"But--\"  \"It is true,\" Professor Lightning said sadly. \"Never mind; I've had my one discovery--how much an accident, no one may ever know. But I neglected to widen the scope of what I had done; I generalized too rapidly, my boy.\" He took a deep breath. \"The method, the technique, is very complex,\" he said. \"But imagine it this way: a man comes to New York. He explores it. Later, when he goes home, he is asked to draw a map of it--and he can do so, because he has the experience. He has the memory of New York, locked in his mind.\"  Charley nodded. \"What does that have to do with me?\" he said.  \"The cells ... the cells of the body seem to have such a memory,\" the professor said. \"It is the basis of my technique.\"  Charley nodded. \"O.K.,\" he said \"I don't care how it works, so long as it-- It does work, doesn't it?\"  The professor shook his head. Very slowly, he said: \"Not for you, my boy. Not for you.\" He paused. \"You see, you were born without arms. In such a case the cellular memory does not seem to exist--like a man who has never been to New York. He cannot draw the map. He has no memory to begin with.\"  The silence this time was a long one.  At last Charley said: \"But somebody could tell him. I mean about New York, so he could draw the map.\"  \"Perhaps,\" the professor said. \"We are working on it. Some day--\"  \"But not today,\" Charley said. \"Is that it?\"  \"I ... I'm afraid so,\" the professor said.  Charley sat for a long time, thinking. He pictured the carnival, and the shrinking audiences. Could he explain to them why he couldn't get arms? Would any audience stop to listen and digest the truth? Charley thought of the armless man in the Flea Museum, and decided slowly that no explanation would be good enough. People didn't stop to make small distinctions. Not in a sideshow. Not in a carnival.  No.  There was only one thing he could do; he saw that clearly. But it took him a long time to find the right words. At last he had them.  \"Professor,\" he said, \"suppose I go right back to being a sideshow exhibit--but with a limited audience.\"  Professor Lightning looked puzzled. \"What do you mean?\" he said.  \"Well,\" Charley said, carefully and with a sudden, surprising feeling of hope, \"you don't happen to need a new guinea pig, do you?\"   THE END     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ May 1959.
