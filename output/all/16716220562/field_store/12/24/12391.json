The backing is put on and finished on the front side. A mirror can be put in the back without much trouble, if it is desired. The shelves should be put in place and held at the back by screws through the backing and at the front by two small blocks on the posts as shown.  After the closet is all assembled it should be thoroughly gone over with fine sandpaper before any finish is applied. It can be finished in any one of the many mission stains which are supplied by the trade for this purpose.     A LEATHER-COVERED FOOTSTOOL   The illustration shows a very handy footstool in mission style. The following list of materials will be needed:    4 oak posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 12 in., S-4-S.   2 sides, 3/4 by 3 by 12 in., soft wood.   2 ends, 3/4 by 3 by 8 in., soft wood.   1 bottom, 3/4 by 8 by 12 in., soft wood.   1 small box of 8 oz. tacks   2-1/2 doz. ornamental head nails.   1 piece of dark leather, 16 by 20 in.   1/2 lb. hair and a small portion of mission stain.  The posts are the only parts made of quarter-sawed oak, the other parts, being covered with leather, can be made of any kind of soft wood. Chamfer the top end of each post, and taper the lower ends as shown in detail. When this is done the mortises can be cut for the sides as shown in the post detail. When cutting the mortises and tenons take care to make them fit perfectly, as there is nothing to brace the legs at the bottom. The strength of the stool depends upon the joints. Make the surface of the posts smooth by first using No. 1 sandpaper, then finishing with No. 00.  [Illustration: Footstool Leather Covered]  The parts are now assembled. First clamp the ends together, using plenty of glue on the joints, and drive some small nails on the inside of the posts through the tenon ends. When the glue has set, the remaining sides can be put together the same as the ends. Fit the bottom on the inside about 1 in. from the top. This can be made fast by driving nails through the sides and ends of the board. The finishing is done by putting on the mission stain as the directions state on the can, then wax the surface to get a dull gloss.  [Illustration: Details of Footstool]  The leather is now put on. Notch out the corners to fit around the posts, but do not cut the ends off. Lap them under the cover. Before nailing on the cover fix the hair evenly over the top, about 6 in. deep. Draw the leather over the hair and fasten the edges with the 8-oz. tacks. The ornamental nails are driven in last, as shown in the drawing, to make a good appearance.     ARTS-CRAFTS MANTEL CLOCK   The clock shown in the illustration was designed especially for rooms furnished in mission style. The clock, however, may be made of mahogany or other wood to match the furniture in any room where it is to be placed. If the mission effect is desired, an oxidized or copper sash should be used. Movements can be bought at the salesroom of a clock company. A movement should be selected that is wide enough from the front to the back to allow the clock case to be made sufficiently deep for standing without being easily upset.  [Illustration: Mantel Clock with Wood and Copper Front]  Quarter-sawed white oak is the best material for this clock, but any other wood which works easily and takes a stain well may be used. Two pieces, 3/8 in. thick, 6-1/2 in. wide, and 8-1/2 in. long, will be needed for the front and back. One piece, 5 in. wide, 6 in. long, and with a thickness sufficient for the clock movement, is needed for the middle part. The thickness of this piece depends on the movement secured.  After the front and back pieces are finished, and a piece of hammered copper screwed on the front as shown in the drawing, the middle piece must be made just thick enough to make the whole distance from the front of the copper to the back of the clock equal to the depth of the movement. Plane one edge on both front and back pieces. Lay out the design and the centers for the circular holes from this planed edge. Use a plane and chisel to cut the outside design. The hole can be bored out with an expansive bit, or sawed out with a scroll saw, and filed perfectly round with a half-round wood file. The bit will give the best results. If the bit is used, bore holes in a piece of scrap wood until the exact size is found.  [Illustration: Details of Mantel Clock]  The outside design of the piece of copper is made to correspond to the design of the clock. The circular hole in the copper can be cut with the expansive bit by first punching a hole in the center to receive the spur of the bit, placing on a block of wood and boring through a little way. The spur on the cutter will cut out the copper. Fasten the copper to the front with copper nails or round-headed screws.  If good glue can be had, the three pieces of wood may be glued together. If the glue cannot be relied upon, put in two flat-headed screws from the back.  The clock can be finished with a dark stain and waxed, or, as it is small, it can be easily fumed. If stain is used, stain and wax the pieces before putting them together. The fuming process is more easily done after the clock is assembled. Secure a bucket, a peck measure, or any receptacle large enough, when inverted, to put over the clock. Pour about 2 oz. of strong ammonia into a saucer or small pan. Support the clock above the saucer and cover both with the inverted bucket. Allow it to stand for three or four days--the longer it stands the darker the fumed finish will be. Finish with two coats of bleached wax. Do not use ordinary uncolored wax, as it will show in the unfilled pores of the wood. The works of the clock should not be in the frame while fuming.     A MUSIC STAND   The attractive and useful piece of mission furniture shown in the accompanying illustration is made of quarter-sawed oak. Considerable labor can be saved in its construction if the stock is ordered from the mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded. The stock list consists of the following pieces:    1 top, 3/4 by 16 by 20 in., S-2-S.   1 shelf, 3/4 by 11-1/2 by 15 in., S-2-S.   1 shelf, 3/4 by 12 by 15 in., S-2-S.   1 shelf, 3/4 by 14-1/2 by 15 in., S-2-S.   1 shelf, 3/4 by 16 by 15 in., S-1-S.   4 legs, 3/4 by 5 by 41 in., S-2-S.   2 lower crosspieces, 3/4 by 3 by 9 in., S-2-S.   2 upper crosspieces, 3/4 by 2 by 9 in., S-2-S.   4 end slats, 5/8 by 2 by 34 in., S-2-S.   20 R.H. screws, 2 in. long.  The four shelves and the top are so wide that it will be necessary to make them from two or more pieces glued together. The top should have a 1/4-in. bevel cut around the upper edge as shown in the drawing.  [Illustration: Details of Music Stand]  [Illustration: Music Stand Complete]  The curve of the legs can be cut with a bracket saw or a drawknife, care being taken to get the edges square and smooth. The four crosspieces are fastened to the legs by means of tenons and mortises. The end slats are joined to the crosspieces in the same manner. The legs can be assembled in pairs with the slats and crosspieces in place. They can be glued in this position, and when dry they should be carefully gone over with fine sandpaper to remove all rough spots. The shelves can now be put in place. They should be fastened to the legs with round-headed screws. The top is also fastened on with screws. When applying the finish, remove the top board and the shelves and finish them separately. The stand can be finished in any one of the many mission stains supplied by the trade for this purpose.  This handsome piece of furniture can be used as a magazine stand as well as a music stand, if desired, and, if it is made and finished well, it will prove an ornament to any home.     MAKING SCREWS HOLD IN THE END GRAIN OF WOOD   [Illustration: MAKING SCREWS HOLD IN END GRAIN]  It is often necessary to fasten one piece of wood to the end of another by means of screws. Wood being a fibrous material, it can be readily understood that when a screw having sharp threads is put in the end grain parallel to these fibers the threads cut them in such a way that, when an extra strain is put upon the parts, the screw pulls out, bringing with it the severed fibers. The accompanying sketch shows how this difficulty may be overcome, and at the same time make the screw hold firmly. A hole is bored and a dowel, preferably of hardwood, glued in it, the grain at right angles to that of the piece.  The size of the dowel, and its location, can be determined by the diameter and the length of the screw. The dowel need not extend all the way through the piece, but should be put in from the surface where the grain of the dowel will be least objectionable.  When putting screws in hard wood much labor will be saved by applying soap to the threads.     A WALL CASE WITH A MIRROR DOOR   The wall case shown in the accompanying picture will serve well as a medicine case. Having a paneled door in which is set a mirror, it serves equally well as a shaving case. It is best made of some hard wood, though a soft wood such as pine or yellow poplar will work up easier and look well finished with three or four coats of white enamel paint.  There will be needed the following pieces:    2 sides, 5/8 by 6 by 32-1/2 in., S-4-S.   1 top and 1 bottom, 5/8 by 6 by 18 in., S-4-S.   1 top of back, 1/2 by 4 by 16-1/4 in., S-2-S.   1 bottom of back, 1/2 by 3 by 16-1/4 in., S-4-S.   1 shelf, 5/8 by 5 by 16 in., S-4-S.   1 back, 1/4 by 16 by 21 in., S-2-S.  DOOR    2 stiles, 5/8 by 3 by 20-1/2 in., S-4-S.   1 top rail, 5/8 by 2 by 11 in., S-4-S.   1 bottom rail, 5/8 by 4 by 11 in., S-4-S.   1 backing for door, 3/16 by 10 by 15 in., S-2-S.  First shape the ends of the two side pieces as shown in the drawing. Next square the top and bottom pieces of the case to size, and lay out and cut the tenons on the ends. Lay out and cut the mortises in the side pieces, also the groove for the shelf, having first squared the shelf to size. Cut and shape the top "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23991"],["title","Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 2 (#6)"],["body","bottom pieces of the back as shown. Cut the rebates in the side pieces into which these pieces are to rest their ends. Cut the rebate for the back. Thoroughly scrape and sandpaper these parts and assemble them. Cut and fit the back in place.  [Illustration: Wall Case Details]  The door is to be made next. Plan the different parts of the door so that the edges may be planed to fit the opening; that is, make the door a good quarter larger at top and bottom than the opening. In cutting the rebate the easiest way is to use a rabbeting plane and cut the full length of the pieces. By using a tenon on the rails in which one shoulder is as much longer than the other as the rebate is deep there is no resulting groove showing at the corner.  [Illustration: Case with Mirror Door]  The wood should be finished before the glass is set, at least, it should be filled, if of hard wood, and one coat of paint put on, if of soft wood which is to be enameled.  In setting the glass, place a thin cushion of putty between the rebate and the glass and another thin cushion between the glass and the fillet of wood or the backing which is to protect the back of the glass.  Fit the door, and then put on the hinges and lock. If desired, the tenons may be made keyed as shown in the photograph instead of through as shown in the drawing.  To finish the case, if of oak, apply a coat of light paste filler, the directions being on the filler can. Next put on a coat of white shellac. When this has hardened apply two coats of some good varnish. Allow time for each coat to harden and rub the first coats with haircloth or curled hair, and the last with pulverized pumice and raw linseed oil or crude oil.  If the wood is soft and an enamel white is desired, the enamel is applied not unlike paint. The directions will be found on the cans in which the paint is purchased.     A SIDE CHAIR   A side chair of simple design and construction is here given. The great difficulty with most chair designs is that the back is generally designed narrower than the front, thus necessitating the rails entering the posts or legs at angles. To the amateur this is quite confusing. The chair illustrated is the same in width, both back and front, so that the shoulders of all the rails are at right angles to the sides. The back of the chair is straight, thus simplifying the design still more.  [Illustration: Side Chair Complete]  Another thing which is confusing to the beginner in his efforts to lay out the mortises is the irregular placing of the rails. It will be noted that in this design the rails of side, front and back are on the same level.  Plain sawed red oak will be appropriate for this piece. Have the pieces mill-planed and sandpapered on four sides to size, allowing 1/2 in. extra to the lengths for squaring up the ends.  [Illustration: Details of Side Chair]  There will be needed the following:    4 rails, 7/8 by 2 by 17-1/2 in.   4 rails, 3/4 by 2 by 17-1/2 in.   2 front posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 19 in.   2 rear posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 37-1/2 in.   1 back, 3/4 by 9-3/4 by 17-1/2 in.   2 cleats, 3/8 by 1 by 16 in.   4 slats, 3/8 by 2 by 16-1/2 in.  Begin work by cutting the posts to the lengths indicated in the drawing. The lower ends should be chamfered slightly to prevent their splintering from usage. The top ends are cut to an angle of 45 deg., the slope beginning 1/2 in. below the top. Lay out and cut the mortises. To do this, lay off the measurements on one of the posts, then place all four side by side on the bench, with the face marks up. Even the ends with the try-square and then carry the measurements just made across all of them, using the try-square. The rails ought to be shouldered on all four sides. Three-eighths inch is a good thickness for the tenons. The width may be 1-1/4 in. and the length 1 in.  Place the rails side by side on the bench with the joint-edges up and the ends evened. Measure off the desired length on one of them and carry the lines across all of them to indicate the location of the shoulder lines. Separate the pieces and square these lines entirely around all of the sides of each piece. With the tenon saw rip and cross cut to these lines.  The back, it will be noted, is set on a slant to add comfort. Thoroughly clean all the parts and assemble them, using good hot glue. Put the back together first, then the front. After these have dried, put the side rails in place.  Cut and fit the two cleats--one to the front rail and one to the rear rail. Keep them even with the lower edge of the rail so as to form a slight recess at the top when the slats are in place. This is to keep the cushion from sliding off. The slats need not be \"let into\" the cleats but merely fastened to their top edges. The cushion may be made of Spanish roan skin and should be filled with elastic felt.  In the chair shown, the joints are reinforced by the addition of lag screws. If the glue is good and the joints well fitted, these are not necessary.     AN ARM CHAIR   The arm chair here described and illustrated is intended to be one of the set of diners made after the design of the side chair described on another page. The same general directions for making the side chair apply equally to the arm chair.  The stock given in the following list should be purchased surfaced on four sides and well sandpapered:    2 rear posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 38 in.   2 front posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 26-1/2 in.   9 rails, 7/8 by 2 by 19-1/2 in.   1 rail, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 19-1/2 in.   3 slats, 1/2 by 2 by 12-1/2 in.   2 arms, 7/8 by 4-1/2 by 20-1/2 in.   2 brackets, 7/8 by 2-1/4 by 2-1/2 in.   2 cleats, 3/8 by 1 by 19 in.   4 slats, 3/8 by 2 by 19 in.  Prepare the posts first by cutting them to the lengths shown in the drawing. In the photograph the front posts have their tops cut off square and the arms fastened to them by means of lag screws. A better way from a mechanical point of view would be to shoulder the top ends on the four sides, cut through-mortises in the arms and insert these tenoned posts into these mortises, pinning the arm to the post by means of small dowels in the edge of the post and through the tenon.  The brackets under the arms are to be fastened to the posts and arms by means of concealed dowels and glue of good quality.  All of the rails should be tenoned into the posts thoroughly, even if the lag screw fastenings are used. If the lag screws are used, the tenons may be what are known as stubb tenons--tenons of short length. Good hot glue should be used in either case.  The shape of the arms is indicated in the drawing. They are fastened to the rear posts by means of dowels and glue.  [Illustration: Arm Chair Complete]  The slats, or verticals, of the back should not have their ends tenoned but should have the mortises in the rails cut sufficiently large to \"let in\" the whole end of each. This is much easier and more likely to result in a satisfactory fit than to shoulder them. Any unevenness in the lengths of the respective slats will not affect the fitting of the joints by this latter method.  The tops of the rear posts in this chair, as in the side chair, are cut to angles of 45 deg., beginning the slope at lines marked 1/2 in. from the tops.  [Illustration: Details of Chair]  The bottom is made up of 2-in. slats fitted between the front and back rails and fastened to cleats which have been previously fastened to the insides of the front and back rails. Keep these cleats low enough on the rails so that the top surfaces of the slats shall rest somewhat below the top edges of the rails. Cushions, such as the one shown, can be purchased ready made or they can be easily made by the amateur.  A good finish for this chair and its mates is obtained as follows: Apply one coat of brown Flemish water stain. This stain in the original package is very dark in tone and unless an almost black finish is wanted, it should be lightened by the addition of one-half or two-thirds water. Apply with a brush or sponge and allow to dry over night. When dry, sandpaper lightly with fine or worn sandpaper to remove the raised grain caused by the water of the stain. Put on a very thin coat of shellac. This is to prevent the \"high lights\" in close-grained woods from being discolored by the stain in the filler which is to follow. The shellac being very thin does not fill the pores of the wood perceptibly. Next, sand the shellac coat lightly when it has hardened. Apply a coat of paste filler colored considerably darker than the stain to the tone desired for the open grain. If the filler is well stirred and properly applied, one coat ought to be sufficient. If it does not fill the pores satisfactorily, apply another coat when the first has had time to harden. Vandyke brown is used to color the filler, if none but natural color is to be had. On the hardened filler apply a thin coat of shellac. On this apply several coats of wax. The directions for waxing will be found upon the cans in which the wax comes.     A BOOKCASE   This beautiful piece of mission furniture can be made at a very moderate cost by anyone who has a slight knowledge of tools. Considerable labor can be saved by ordering the material from the mill ready cut to size, dressed and sanded. Quarter-sawed oak is the best wood to use and it is comparatively easy to obtain. Plain-sawed oak looks well, but is more liable to warp than the quarter-sawed and this is quite an element in pieces as wide as the ones used. For the complete bookcase the following material will be needed:    1 top, 3/4 by 15 by 31-1/4 in., hard wood, S-1-S.   1 top back board, 3/4 by 4 by 30-1/4 in., hard wood, S-1-S.   2 sides, 3/4 by 14 by 50 in., hard wood, S-1-S.   1 bottom, 3/4 by 14 by 28-3/4 in., hard wood, S-1-S.   1 bottom rail, 3/4 by 4 by 28-3/4 in., hard wood, S-1-S.   1 center piece, 3/4 by 2 by 45-3/4 in., hard wood, S-2-S.   4 door sides, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 45-1/4 in., hard wood, S-2-S.   4 door ends, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 14 in., hard wood, S-2-S.
