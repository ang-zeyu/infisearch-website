My division was about 7,000 strong when it went into the action. We fought the divisions of Anderson, Cheatham, and Buckner.  \"I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,                                          \"Lovell H. ROUSSEAU.\"   It will not be amiss here to give a brief outline of the early history, coming down to a recent date, of the renowned hero, Major-General A. McD. McCOOK, United States Volunteers.  He was born in Columbiana County, Ohio, April 22, 1831. At the age of sixteen he entered the Military Academy at West Point, as a cadet. He graduated in July, 1852, and was commissioned Brevet Second Lieutenant, in the 3d Regiment United States Infantry. After being assigned to duty for a few months, at Newport Barracks, Ky., he was ordered, in April, 1853, to join his regiment, then serving in the Territory of New Mexico. Here he remained nearly five years, constantly on active duty in the field, and participating in all the Indian campaigns on that wild and remote frontier. His long services and good conduct were mentioned in General Orders by Lieutenant-General Winfield Scott. In January, 1858, he was ordered from New Mexico to West Point, and assigned to duty in the Military Academy, as instructor in Tactics and the Art of War. On the breaking out of the rebellion he was relieved from duty there, and ordered, in April, 1861, to Columbus, Ohio, to muster in volunteers. Before his arrival there he was elected Colonel of the 1st Ohio Volunteers, a three-months regiment, already on its way to the seat of war in Virginia; and hastening to join the command, to which he was elected without his knowledge or solicitation, soon had an opportunity of exhibiting those admirable qualities as a field-officer for which he has since become so justly distinguished. His coolness in the unfortunate affair at Vienna, and his consummate military skill in the management of his command at Bull Run, were universally commended. At the close of that eventful conflict he marched his regiment back to Centerville in the same good order in which it had left there, an honorable exception to the wide-spread confusion and disorder that prevailed elsewhere among the National forces.  When the three-months troops were mustered out of the service he received permission to raise the 1st Regiment Ohio Volunteers, a three-years regiment; but on the 3d of September, 1861, and before his command was ready to take the field, he was appointed Brigadier-General of Volunteers, and assigned to command the advance of the Federal forces then in Kentucky, at Camp Nevin. Here, and at Green River, he organized his splendid Second Division, with which he afterward marched to Nashville, and thence toward the Tennessee River.  On the 6th of April, 1862, alarmed by the sullen sound of distant artillery, and learning the precarious situation of Grant's army, he moved his division, over desperate roads, twenty-two miles, to Savannah, and there embarked on steamboats for Pittsburg Landing. After clearing a way with the bayonet through the army of stragglers that swarmed upon the bank of the river, soon after daylight on the morning of the 7th of April, the Second Division of the Army of the Ohio advanced through the sad scenes of our defeat the day before, and deployed, with stout hearts and cheers, upon the field of Shiloh. General McCook fought his troops that day with admirable judgment. He held them in hand; his line of battle was not once broken--it was not once retired; but was steadily and determinedly advanced until the enemy fled, and the reverse of the day before was more than redeemed by a splendid victory.  In the movement on Corinth, a few weeks after the battle of Shiloh, General McCook had the honor of being in the advance of General Buell's army corps, and his skirmishers were among the first to scale the enemy's works.  The rank of major-general of volunteers was soon after conferred upon him, in view of his distinguished services--a promotion not undeserved.  After the evacuation of Corinth, the command of General McCook was moved through Northern Alabama to Huntsville, thence to Battle Creek, where his forces remained for two months, in front of Bragg's army at Chattanooga. Upon the withdrawal of Buell's army from Alabama and Tennessee, General McCook moved his division, by a long march of four hundred miles, back to Louisville.  Here he was assigned to command the First Corps in the Army of the Ohio, and started on a new campaign, under Buell, in pursuit of Bragg. The enemy were met and engaged near Perryville, and two divisions of McCook's corps (one of them composed of raw recruits) bore the assault of almost the entire army of General Bragg. The unexpected and unannounced withdrawal of General Gilbert's forces on his right; the sad and early loss of those two noble soldiers, Terrell and Jackson, and the tardiness of reinforcements, made the engagement a desperate one, and resulted in a victory, incomplete but honorable, to the Union forces. After the battle of Chaplin Hills, Bragg's army, worn and broken, fled in dismay from Kentucky. The army corps of Major-General McCook was afterward moved to Nashville, and he assumed command of the Federal forces in that vicinity.  On the 6th of November, 1862, on the arrival of Major-General Rosecrans, who succeeded Major-General Buell in command, General McCook was assigned to command the right wing in the Department of the Cumberland. On the 26th of December, 1862, the Army of the Cumberland moved from Nashville to attack the enemy in position in front of Murfreesboro. General McCook commanded the right. On the evening of December 30 the two armies were in line of battle, confronting each other. Rosecrans had massed his reserves on the left, to crush the rebel right with heavy columns, and turn their position. Bragg, unfortunately, learning of his dispositions during the night, massed almost his entire army in front of McCook, and in the gray of the following morning, and before we had attacked on the left, advanced with desperate fury upon the right wing. Outnumbered, outflanked, and overpowered, the right was forced to retire, not, however, until its line of battle was marked with the evidences of its struggle and the fearful decimation of the enemy. To check the advancing rebel masses, already flushed with anticipated victory, the Federal reserves moved rapidly to the rescue. The furious onslaught of the enemy was resisted, and the right and the fortunes of the day were saved.  The rebels, whipped on the left and center, checked on the right, foiled in every attack, having lost nearly one-third of their numbers, fled from the field on the night of the 3d of January, and the victorious Union army advanced through their intrenchments into Murfreesboro. The great battle of Stone River, dearly won, and incomplete in its results, was yet a victory.  The right was turned and forced to retire in the first day's fight. Whether this was attributable to accidental causes, that decide so many important engagements, or to the superior generalship of the rebel commander, it is at least certain that generalship was not wanting in the disposition of the forces under General McCook; nor was courage wanting in his troops.  Major-General McCook now commands the Twentieth Army Corps.     CHAPTER IV.       Looking for the Body of a Dead Nephew on the Field of      Murfreesboro -- The 6th Ohio at Murfreesboro -- The Dead of      the 6th -- The 35th Indiana -- Putting Contrabands to Some      Service -- Anxiety of Owners to Retain their Slaves --      Conduct of a Mistress -- \"Don't Shoot, Massa, here I Is!\" --      Kidd's Safeguard -- \"Always Been a Union Man\" -- Negroes      Exhibiting their Preference for their Friends.   On the gory field of Murfreesboro, upon the ushering in of the new year, many a noble life was ebbing away. It was a rainy, dismal night; and, on traversing that field, I saw many a spot sacred to the memory of my loved companions of the glorious 6th Ohio. I incidentally heard of the death of a nephew in that fight. I thought of his poor mother. How could I break the news to her! Yes, there was I, surrounded by hundreds of dead and wounded, _pitying the living_. O, how true it is that--    Death's swift, unerring dart brings to its victim calm and peaceful rest,   While those _who live_ mourn and live on--the arrow in their breast!  With anxious haste I sought his body during that night. Many an upturned face, some with pleasing smile, and others with vengeance depicted, seemed to meet my gaze.  Stragglers told me to go further to the left. \"There's where Crittenden's boys gave 'em h--l!\" Just to the right of the railroad I found young Stephens, of the 24th Ohio. His leg was shattered. He called me by name, and begged me to get him some water, as he was perishing. I went back to the river, stripped three or four dead of their canteens, and filled them, and returned. He told me that young Tommy Burnett was only wounded. He saw him carried back. This relieved my anxiety. The next day the dead were buried. There, amid the shot and shell and other _debris_ of the battle-field, the dead heroes of the 6th lie, until the last trump shall call.  A few days afterward I met one of the officers of that regiment. Of him I eagerly inquired as to its fate. A tear fell from his manly eye as he exclaimed, \"O, sad enough, Alf! Our boys were terribly cut up; but they fought like tigers--no flinching there; no falling out of line; shoulder to shoulder they stood amid the sheeted flame; and, though pressed by almost overwhelming numbers, no blanched cheek, no craven look, not the slightest token of fear was visible. The boys were there to do or die. They were Ohio boys, and felt a pride in battling for their country and her honor.\" And when I asked of names familiar, the loss, indeed, seemed fearful. \"What became,\" said I, \"of Olly Rockenfield?\" \"Dead!\" was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23733"],["title","Incidents of the War: Humorous, Pathetic, and Descriptive (#7)"],["body","reply. \"And George Ridenour?\" \"Wounded--can not live!\"  Dave Medary, a perfect pet of the regiment, a boy so childlike, so quiet in his deportment, yet with as brave a heart as Julius Cæsar--LITTLE DAVE was killed! I saw his grave a few days after. It was half a mile to the left of the railroad; and, although it was January, the leaves of the prairie-rose were full and green, bending over him as if in mourning for the early dead.  Jack Colwell--few of the typos of Cincinnati but knew Jack, or ADD, as he was frequently called--poor Jack died from want of attention! His wound was in the leg, below the knee. I saw him a week after the battle, and the ball was not yet extracted.  Adjutant Williams, Lieutenant Foster, Captain McAlpin, Captain Tinker, Lieutenant Schaeffer, young Montaldo, Harry Simmonds, A. S. Shaw, John Crotty, and many others, were wounded or killed in the terrific storm of shot and shell sent by the rebel horde under Breckinridge. At one time every standard-bearer was wounded, and for a moment the flag of the 6th lay in the dust; but Colonel Anderson seized it and waved it in proud defiance, wounded though he was. The Colonel soon found claimants for the flag, and had to give it up to those to whose proud lot it fell to defend it.  O! the wild excitement of a fight! How completely carried away men become by enthusiasm! They know no danger; they see none--are oblivious to every thing but _hope of victory_! Men behold their boon companions fall, yet onward they dash with closed ranks, themselves the next victims.  There are few in the Army of the Cumberland who have not heard of the 35th Indiana, commanded by Colonel Mullen, of Madison, and as fine an Irish regiment as ever trod the poetic sod of the Emerald Isle. On their march up from Huntsville, Alabama, toward Louisville, Kentucky, on the renowned parallel run between Buell and Bragg, the command were short of provisions. _Half-rations_ were considered a rarity. Father Cony, who is at all times assiduous in his duties to his flock, had called his regiment together, and was instilling into their minds the necessity of their trusting in Providence. He spoke of Jesus feeding the multitude upon three barley loaves and five small fishes. Just at this juncture an excitable, stalwart son of Erin arose and shouted: \"Bully for him! He's the man we want for the _quarter-master of this regiment_!\"  Early in January General Rosecrans issued his orders that all the men that could possibly be spared from detail duty should be immediately placed into the ranks, and that negroes should be \"conscripted\" or captured to take their places as teamsters, blacksmiths, cooks, etc. By this means the Third Division of the Army of the Cumberland, then under General James B. Steadman, was increased eight hundred men--men acclimated--men who could shoulder a musket. This was all done in less than three weeks. The negroes were all taken from rebel plantations.  One morning Colonel Vandeveer, of the 35th Ohio, commanding the Third Brigade, sent an orderly to my tent to inquire if I would not like to accompany an excursion into the enemy's country. As items were scarce, I at once assented; and, although scarce daybreak, off we went. The Colonel informed me that, as I was a good judge of darkeys, General Steadman had advised my going with the party.  We called first at Mrs. Carmichael's, and got two boys, aged, respectively, fifteen and seventeen. Mrs. Carmichael begged, and, finally, wept quite bitterly at the prospect of losing her boys--said those were all she had left--(she had sent the others South). She plead with us not to take \"them boys\"--said \"they wern't no account--couldn't do nothing nohow.\" But the _mother_ of these boys told our men a different story, and begged us to take the boys, \"For,\" said she, \"dey does all de plantin' corn and tendin' in de feel. Dey's my chill'n, and if I never sees 'em agin, I want de satisfaction of knowin' _dey is free_!\"  Mrs. Carmichael's supplications for the negroes not to be taken from her were quite pitiful. She said they had been _allers_ raised _jest_ like as they were her own flesh and blood, and she just _keered_ for 'em the same. But, as Mrs. Carmichael had two sons in the rebel army, the boys were taken. Upon the first order to come with us they seemed delighted, which caused the mistress to become very wrathy. I told the boys to go to their cabin and get their blankets, as they would need them. Judge my surprise when this _kind-hearted_ woman, who had just informed me that she had \"allers treated them boys as if they were her own flesh and blood\"--this woman seized the blankets from the half-naked boys, and fairly shrieked at them: \"You nasty, dirty little nigger thieves! if them Yankees want to steal you, let 'em find you in blankets; _I'm not a-going to do it!_\" I merely inquired if that was the way in which she treated _her other children_--those in the REBEL _army_?  From thence we went to Mrs. Kidd's, who had a husband and two sons in the rebel service. On our approach she endeavored to secrete some of the blacks, _but they_ wouldn't \"_stay hid_.\" The cause of the visit was explained. The rebels had been driving most of the likely negroes South. They were using them against the Government; and it was thought, by some, that they might as well work for as _against_ the UNION. They were raising their crops, running their mills, manufacturing their army-wagons, etc., besides supporting the families of the rebels, thus placing every able-bodied white man of the South in the hands of the government. The Federal service needed teamsters and hospital nurses and cooks.  Mrs. Kidd seemed quite a reasonable woman--said she thought she understood the policy of the North, and that the South knew that _slavery_ was their strength. I made the remark, that, probably, if her husband knew she would be left without help, perhaps he would be induced to return and respect the old flag that had at all times, while he was loyal to it, defended him.  This little speech on my part elicited a rejoinder from a young miss, a daughter of Mrs. Kidd, sixteen or seventeen years of age, who flirted around, and with a nose that reached the altitude of at least \"eighty-seven\" degrees, exclaimed--  \"I don't want my PAR nor my brothers to come home not till every one of you _Yankees_ is driven from our sile!\"  Some of the boys were busy hunting for a secreted negro, one whom this young lady had stored away for safety. A soldier opened a smoke-house door, at which the young Secesh fairly yelled--  \"There aint no nigger there! You Yankees haint a bit o' sense! You don't know a smoke-house from a hut, nohow!\"  Supposing the negro, who we felt almost sure was there, might possibly have escaped, we were about retiring with those already collected, when I suggested, loud enough for any one to hear about the building, that the whole squad should pour a volley through that rickety old dormer-window that projected from the room, when, much to our astonishment, and amid roars of laughter, appeared a woolly head, white eye-balls distended, the darkey yelling loud and fast--  \"DON'T SHOOT, MASSA! don't shoot! HERE I IS! I's a comin'! De missus made me clime on dis roof. I wants to go wid you folks anyhow!\"  Mr. Crossman's plantation was then visited; but, as the rebels had driven him away because of his Unionism, and taken his horses, his property was undisturbed by us.  From thence we visited Nolinsville--met a gang of twenty \"likely-looking boys,\" stout, healthy fellows, who had clubbed together to come to the Union camp. They told us the rebs were only four miles off, \"scriptin' all the niggers dar was in de fields, and a-runnin' 'em South.\" These were added to our stock in trade.  On our way back, a couple of old, sour-looking WOMEN were standing on the steps that were built for them to _climb_ a _fence_, who, seeing so many blacks, inquired what we were taking them for. \"To work,\" was the reply. \"The rebels were about to run them South, and we wanted them to work for us.\"  \"Now who told you that?\" they inquired.  \"The negroes themselves, madam. Many of them came voluntarily, to escape being sent South.\"  \"O, yes! you Federals git your information from the _niggers altogether_.\"  \"Yes, madam!\" facetiously replied Captain Dickerson, of the 2d Minnesota Regiment, \"that's a fact. All the _reliable_ information does come from them.\"  On our homeward trip we called at what is known as \"Kidd's Mills,\" between Concord Church and Nolinsville. There were there quite a number employed upon the lumber and grist. A selection was made from the lot. They _all_ wanted to come, but some were too young, and others too _old_.  Old man Kidd said he had a \"safeguard from the Gineral. The Gineral had been up to see his darters, Delilah and Susan, and give him a safeguard.\" Upon examination it was found to be a mere request. Requests don't stand in military (not arbitrary enough). Then the old man declared he had always been a Union man--\"allers said this war wern't no good--that the South had better stand by the old flag.\"  I at once told him if _such was the case_ he was all right--to just get his horse and come with me, and if he had \"_allers_\" been a \"_Union man_\" or a non-combatant, why, they would all be returned to him.  The negroes were grouped around with anxious faces, and with rather astonished looks; and, as Mr. Kidd went to the stable, a venerable, white-haired old darkey, who had been told to stand back--he was too old to join the Union teamsters--came forward, and begged to be taken. \"Why, I does heap o' work. I tends dis mill; I drives a team fustrate. _Please take de ole man_, and let him _die free_!\"  Another negro, too old to take, spoke up and said: \"What was dat de old man Kidd told you?\"  \"Why,\" I replied, \"he said he had always been a Union man.\"  \"DE LOR' BRESS MY SOUL! Did he say dat _he_ was a Union man?\"  \"Yes!\"  \"Well! well! well! Dat he was a Union"]]]
