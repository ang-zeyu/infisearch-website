He could hear it go rattling from log to log nearly to the bottom. Sweetest Susan gave a little screech. Drusilla sat bolt upright and exclaimed:--  \"You all better come en go see yo' ma. I want ter see 'er myse'f.\"  But there was nothing to be frightened at. The tiny man had brushed the dust and trash from his clothes, and then turned to the children with a good-humored smile. He was not above four inches high. He had on a dress-coat. Drusilla afterward described it as a claw-hammer coat, velveteen knickerbockers, and silver buckles on his shoes. His hat was shaped like a thimble, and he had a tiny feather stuck in the side of it.  \"I'm much obliged to you for getting me out of that scrape,\" he said with a bow to all the children. \"It was a pretty tight place. I stayed out last night just one second and a half too late, and when I went to go home I found the door shut. So I just crawled under the bark there for a nap. The log must have turned in some way, for when I woke up and tried to crawl out I found I couldn't manage it. I wouldn't have minded that so much, but just then I saw one of those terrible flat-headed creatures making his way toward me. Why, his head was a sawmill! He was gnawing the wood out of his way and clearing a road to me. I tried to draw my sword, but I couldn't get it from under me. Then I felt the bark rising. I pushed as hard as I could, and here I am.\"  \"Ax 'im his name,\" said Drusilla in an awe-stricken tone.  \"Ah, I forgot,\" responded the little man. \"I know you, but you don't know me. My name is Mr. Thimblefinger, and I shall be happy to serve you. Whenever you want me just tap three times on the head of your bed.\"  \"Thank goodness! I don't sleep in no bed,\" exclaimed Drusilla.  \"That makes no difference,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger. \"If you sleep on a pallet just tap on the floor.\"  \"Please, Mister, don't talk dat a-way,\" pleaded Drusilla, \"kase I'll be constant a-projeckin' wid dat tappin', an' de fus' time you come I'll holler fire.\"  \"Don't notice her,\" said Buster John, \"she talks to hear herself talk.\"  \"I see,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger, tapping his forehead significantly and nodding his head.  \"You kin nod,\" said Drusilla defiantly, \"but my head got mo' in it dan you kin comb out.\"  \"I believe you!\" exclaimed Mr. Thimblefinger, \"I believe you!\" He spoke so earnestly that Sweetest Susan and Buster John laughed, and Drusilla laughed with them.  \"You dropped your knife,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger. \"I'm sorry of it. I can't bring it up to you, but I'll see if I can't crawl under and get it out.\"  With that he leaped nimbly from log to log and disappeared under the wood-pile. The children went down to see what he would do. They were so astonished at his droll appearance that they forgot their curiosity.  \"Is that a fairy, brother?\" asked Sweetest Susan in a low voice.  \"No!\" exclaimed Buster John with a lofty air, but not loudly. \"Don't you see he's not a bit like the fairies we read about in books? Why, he was afraid of a wood-sawyer.\"  \"That's so,\" Sweetest Susan rejoined.  \"He's a witch, dat what he is,\" said Drusilla.  \"Shucks!\" whispered Buster John. He heard the voice of Mr. Thimblefinger under the wood-pile.  \"I've found it, I've found it!\" he cried. And presently he made his appearance, dragging the knife after him. He tugged at it until he got it out, and then he sat down on a chip, wiped the perspiration from his eyes, and fanned himself with a thin flake of pine bark no bigger than a bee's wing.  \"Pick me up and let's go on top of the wood-pile,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger after a while. \"It's suffocating down here. Ouch! don't tickle me, if you do I shall have a fit.\" Buster John had lifted him by placing a thumb and forefinger under his arms. \"And don't squeeze me, neither,\" the little man went on. \"I was cramped under that bark until I'm as sore as a boil all over. Goodness! I wish I was at home!\"  \"Where do you live?\" asked Sweetest Susan when they were once more seated on the wood-pile.  \"Not far from here, not very far,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger, shaking his head sagely, \"but it is a different country--oh, entirely different.\"  Sweetest Susan edged away from the little man at this, and Drusilla stretched her eyes.  \"What is it like?\" asked Buster John boldly.  Mr. Thimblefinger reflected a while, and then shook his head. \"I can show it to you,\" he said, \"but I can't describe it.\"  \"Pick 'im up an' show 'im to your ma!\" exclaimed Drusilla suddenly.  \"No, no, no!\" cried Mr. Thimblefinger, leaping to his feet. \"That would spoil everything. No grown person living in this country has ever seen me. No, no! don't try that. It would spoil your luck. I wouldn't be here now if the Dolls' Grandmother hadn't begged me to come with her last night. But I'll come to see you,\"--he pointed at Drusilla. \"I'll come often.\"  \"I des said dat fer ter see what you'd say,\" protested Drusilla. \"You wan' gwine ter take 'im, wuz you, honey?\" This question was addressed to Buster John, who scorned to answer it.  \"Grown people wouldn't understand me,\" Mr. Thimblefinger explained. \"They know a great deal too much to suit me.\"  \"How do you get to your country?\" inquired Buster John, who was keen for an adventure.  \"The nearest way is by the spring,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger. \"That is the only way you could go.\"  \"Can I go too?\" asked Sweetest Susan. \"And Drusilla?\"  \"Oh, of course,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger, shrugging his shoulders. \"One can go or all can go.\"  \"Do you go down the spring branch?\" asked Buster John.  [Illustration: FOLLOWING LITTLE MR. THIMBLEFINGER]  \"No, no,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger. \"Below the spring and below the branch.\"  \"Do you mean under the spring?\" Sweetest Susan inquired, with some hesitation.  \"That's it,\" cried Mr. Thimblefinger. \"Right down through the spring and under it.\"  \"Why, we'd drown,\" said Sweetest Susan. \"The spring is deep.\"  \"Well, you'll ha' ter 'skuze me,\" exclaimed Drusilla. \"Dat water's too wet fer me.\"  Buster John waited for an explanation, but none was forthcoming.  \"We couldn't go through the spring, you know,\" he said presently.  \"How do you know?\" asked Mr. Thimblefinger slyly. \"Did you ever try it?\"  He asked each of the children this, and the reply was that none of them had ever tried it.  \"I put my foot in it once,\" said Buster John, \"and the water was just like other spring water. I know we can't go through it.\"  \"Come now!\" Mr. Thimblefinger suggested, \"don't say you know. Sometimes people live to be very old and don't know the very things they ought to know.\"  \"But I know that,\" replied Buster John confidently.  \"Very well, then,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger, pulling out a tiny watch, \"did you ever feel of the water in the spring at precisely nine minutes and nine seconds after twelve o'clock?\"  \"N-o-o-o,\" replied Buster John, taken by surprise, \"I don't think I ever did.\"  \"Of course not!\" cried Mr. Thimblefinger gayly. \"You had no reason. Well, at nine minutes and nine seconds after twelve o'clock the water in the spring is not wet. It is as dry as the air we breathe. It is now two minutes after twelve o'clock. We'll go to the spring, wait until the time comes, and then you will see for yourselves.\"  As they went toward the spring--Mr. Thimblefinger running on before with wonderful agility--Drusilla touched Sweetest Susan on the arm. \"Honey,\" said she, \"don't let dat creetur pull you in de spring. Goodness knows, ef he puts his han' on me I'm gwine ter squall.\"  \"Will you hush?\" exclaimed Buster John impatiently.  \"Watch out, now,\" said Drusilla defiantly. \"Ef you gits drownded in dar I'll sho' tell yo' ma.\"  Fortunately, there was no one near the spring, so Mr. Thimblefinger advanced boldly, followed closely by the children, though Drusilla seemed to hang back somewhat doubtfully. When they arrived there Mr. Thimblefinger took out his tiny timepiece and held it in his hand. The children watched him with breathless interest, especially Buster John, who was thrilled with the idea of having an adventure entirely different from any that he had read of in the story-books.  As the little man stood there holding his watch and looking at it intently, the dinner-bell rang, first in the hallway and then in the back porch. The children remembered it afterward.  \"You all better go git yo' dinner 'fo' it git col', stidder projeckin' 'roun' here wid you dunner what,\" remarked Drusilla.  \"Now!\" exclaimed Mr. Thimblefinger, \"put your hand in the spring.\"  Buster John did as he was bid, and, to his amazement, he could feel no water. He could see it, but he couldn't feel it. He turned pale with excitement and withdrew his hand. Then he put his other hand in, but the result was the same. He plunged his arm in up to the elbow, but his sleeve remained perfectly dry.  \"Try it, sis,\" he cried.  Sweetest Susan did so, and boldly declared there was no water in the spring. She wanted Drusilla to try to wet her hand, but Drusilla sullenly declined.  Mr. Thimblefinger settled the matter by walking into the spring.  \"Now, then, if you are going, come along,\" he cried. \"You have just seventeen and a half seconds.\" He waved his hand from the bottom of the spring and stood waiting. A spring lizard ran near him, and he drew his sword and chased it into a hole. A crawfish showed its head, and he drove it away. Then he waved his hand again. \"Come on, the coast is clear.\"  Buster John put his hand in the water again, and this seemed to satisfy him. He stepped boldly into the spring, and in a moment he stood by Mr. Thimblefinger, laughing, but still excited by the novelty of his experience. He called to his sister:--  \"Come on, sis. It's splendid down here.\"  \"Is it wet?\" she asked plaintively. \"Is it cold?\"  \"No!\" replied Buster John impatiently. \"Don't be a baby.\"  \"Come on, Drusilla! You've got to come. Mamma said you must go wherever we went,\" cried Sweetest Susan.  \"No, ma'am!\" exclaimed Drusilla, with emphasis. \"She"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23869"],["title","Little Mr. Thimblefinger and His Queer Country (#3)"],["body"," ain't tol' me ter foller you in de fier an' needer in de water!\"  But Sweetest Susan didn't wait to hear. She jumped into the spring with a splash and then stood by her brother very red in the face.  \"Five more seconds!\" cried Mr. Thimblefinger in a businesslike way.  Drusilla looked in the spring and hesitated. She could see the water plain enough, but then she could also see Sweetest Susan and Buster John, and they seemed to be very comfortable.  \"I'm comin',\" she yelled, \"but ef you all make me git drownded in dry water I'll ha'nt you ef it's de las' thing I do!\"  Then she shut her eyes tight, put her fingers in her ears, and leaped into the spring. She floundered around with her eyes still shut, and gasped and caught her breath just like a drowning person, until she heard the others laughing at her, and then she opened her eyes with astonishment.  Suddenly there was a loud, splashing sound heard above and around them and under their feet.  \"Watch out!\" cried Mr. Thimblefinger. \"Run this way! The water is getting wet again!\"  The way seemed to widen before them as they ran, and in a moment they found themselves below the \"gum,\" or \"curb,\" of the spring and beyond it. But as they went forward the bottom of the spring seemed to grow and expand, and the sun shining through gave a soft light that was very pleasant to the eye. The grass was green and the leaves of the trees and the flowers were pale pink and yellow.  Mr. Thimblefinger seemed to be very happy. He ran along before the children as nimbly as a killdee, talking and laughing all the time. Presently Drusilla, who brought up the rear, suddenly stopped in her tracks and looked around. Then she uttered an exclamation of fright. Sweetest Susan and Buster John paused to see what was the matter.  \"Wharbouts did we come in at?\" she asked.  Then, for the first time, the children saw that the bottom of the spring had seemed to expand, until it spread over their heads and around on all sides as the sky does in our country.  \"Don't bother about that,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger. \"No matter how big it looks, it's nothing but the bottom of the spring after all.\"  \"But how are we to get out, please?\" asked Sweetest Susan.  \"The same way you came in,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger.  \"I tol' you! I tol' you!\" exclaimed Drusilla, swinging her right arm up and down vigorously. \"Ef you kin fly you kin git out, an' you look much like flyin'. Dat what you git by not mindin' me an' yo' ma!\"  \"Tut! tut!\" exclaimed Mr. Thimblefinger. \"I'll 'sicc' the Katydids on you if you don't stop scaring the little girl. Come! we are not far from my house. We'll go there and see what the neighbors have sent in for dinner.\"  Buster John followed him as readily as before, but Sweetest Susan and Drusilla were not so eager. They had no device, however, and Drusilla made the best of it.  \"I ain't skeered ez I wuz. He talk mo' and mo' like folks.\"  So they went on toward Mr. Thimblefinger's house.     III.  MR. THIMBLEFINGER'S FRIENDS.   \"I hope you are not tired,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger to Sweetest Susan when they had been on their way for some little time. \"Because if you are you can rest yourself by taking longer steps.\"  Buster John was ready to laugh at this, but he soon discovered that Mr. Thimblefinger was right. He found that he could hop and jump ever so far in this queer country, and the first use he made of the discovery was to jump over Drusilla's head. This he did with hardly any effort. After that the journey of the children, which had grown somewhat tiresome (though they wouldn't say so), became a frolic. They skimmed along over the gray fields with no trouble at all, but Drusilla found it hard to retain her balance when she jumped high. Mr. Thimblefinger, who had a reason for everything, was puzzled at this. He paused a while and stood thinking and rubbing his chin. Then he said that either Drusilla's head was too light or her heels too heavy--he couldn't for the life of him tell which.  There was one thing that bothered the children. If Mr. Thimblefinger's house was just big enough to fit him (as Buster John expressed it), how could they go inside? Sweetest Susan was so troubled that she asked Drusilla about it. But Drusilla shook her head vigorously.  \"Don't come axin' me,\" she cried. \"I done tol' you all right pine-blank not ter come. Ef de house lil' like dat creetur is, what you gwine do when night come? En den spozen 'pon top er dat dat a big rain come up? Oh, I tol' you 'fo' you started! Who in de name er sense ever heah talk er folks gwine down in a spring? You mought er know'd sump'in gwine ter happen. Oh, I tol' you!\"  There was no denying this, and Sweetest Susan and her brother were beginning to feel anxious, when an exclamation from Mr. Thimblefinger attracted their attention.  \"We are nearly there,\" he shouted. \"Yonder is the house. My! won't the family be surprised when they see you!\"  Sure enough there was the house, and it was not a small one, either. Drusilla said it looked more like a barn than a house, but Buster John said it didn't make any difference what it looked like so long as they could rest there and get something to eat, for they had had no dinner.  \"I hope dey got sho' 'nuff vittles--pot-licker an' dumplin's, an' sump'in you kin fill up wid,\" said Drusilla heartily.  Mr. Thimblefinger, who had been running a little way ahead, suddenly paused and waited for the children to come up.  \"Come to think of it,\" he remarked, \"you may have heard of some of my family. I call them my family, but they are no kin to me. We just live together in the same house for company's sake.\"  \"They are not fairies?\" suggested Sweetest Susan.  Mr. Thimblefinger shook his head. \"Oh, no! Just common every-day people like myself. We put on no airs. Did you ever hear of Mrs. Meadows? And Mr. Rabbit? And Mrs. Rabbit?\"  \"Dem what wuz in de tale?\" asked Drusilla.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger, \"the very same persons.\"  \"Sho' 'nuff!\" exclaimed Drusilla. \"Why, we been hear talk er dem sence 'fo' we wuz knee-high.\"  Sweetest Susan and Buster John said they had often heard of Mr. Rabbit and Mrs. Meadows. This seemed to please Mr. Thimblefinger very much. He smiled and nodded approval.  \"Did they ever have you in a story?\" asked Buster John.  \"No, no!\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger. \"I was so little they forgot me.\" He laughed at his own joke, but it was very plain that he didn't relish the idea of not having his name in a book.  Presently the children came to the house, but they hesitated at the gate and stood there in fear and trembling. What they saw was enough to frighten them. An old woman was sitting in a chair knitting. She was not different from many old women the children had seen, but near her sat a Rabbit as big as a man. He was a tremendous creature, grizzly and gray, and watery-eyed from age. He sat in a rocking-chair smoking a pipe.  [Illustration: MR. RABBIT AND MRS. MEADOWS]  \"Le' 's go back,\" whispered Drusilla. \"Dat ar creetur bigger dan a hoss. Ef he git a glimp' us we er gone--gone!\"  Sweetest Susan shivered and looked at Buster John, and Buster John looked at Mr. Thimblefinger. But Mr. Thimblefinger ran forward, crying out:--  \"Howdy, folks, howdy! I've brought some friends home to dinner.\" He beckoned to the children. \"Come on and see Mrs. Meadows and Mr. Rabbit.\"  Mrs. Meadows immediately dropped her knitting in her lap, and threw her hands up to her head, as if to arrange her hair.  \"Come in,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger to the children.  \"Yes, come on,\" exclaimed Mr. Rabbit in a voice that sounded as if he had a bad cold.  \"I'm in no fix to be seen,\" said Mrs. Meadows, \"but I'm glad to see you, anyhow. Come right in. Take off your things and make yourself at home. How did you get here? I reckon that little trick there has been telling tales out of school.\" She pointed at Mr. Thimblefinger and laughed.  \"He brought us,\" said Sweetest Susan. \"I'm sorry we came.\"  \"Now, don't say that,\" remarked Mrs. Meadows kindly. \"What are you afraid of?\"  \"Of him,\" replied Sweetest Susan, nodding her head toward Mr. Rabbit.  \"Is that all?\" exclaimed Mrs. Meadows. \"Why, he's as harmless as a kitten.\"  \"Yes, yes!\" said Mr. Rabbit complacently. \"No harm in me--no harm in old people. Just give us a little room in the corner--a little place where we can sit and nod--and there's no harm in us. I'm just as glad you've come as I can be. I see you've brought the Tar Baby. She's grown some since I saw her last.\" Mr. Rabbit looked at Drusilla with considerable curiosity. \"I hope she's not as sticky as she used to be.\"  \"Hey!\" cried Buster John, laughing. \"Mr. Rabbit thinks Drusilla is the Tar Baby!\"  Drusilla tossed her head scornfully. \"Huh! I ain't no Tar Baby. I may be a nigger, an' I speck I is, but I ain't no Tar Baby. My mammy done tol' me 'bout de Tar Baby in de tale, an' she got it fum her gran'daddy. Ef I'm de Tar Baby, I'm older dan my mammy's gran'daddy.\"  Mr. Rabbit took off his spectacles and wiped them on his coat-tail. \"My eyes are getting very bad,\" he said, by way of apology. \"But you certainly look very much like the Tar Baby. If you were both together in the dark, nobody could tell you apart. Well, well! I'm getting old.\"  \"You ain't no older dan you look,\" said Drusilla spitefully under her breath.  \"Hush!\" whispered Sweetest Susan. \"He'll eat us up.\"  Mrs. Meadows laughed. \"Don't worry, child. Mr. Rabbit loves his pipe and a joke, but he'll never hurt you. Never in the world.\"  \"But this isn't in the world,\" suggested Buster John.  \"Well, it's next door, as you may say,\" Mrs. Meadows replied.  Just then Mr. Rabbit slowly raised himself from his chair and examined the seat closely. \"I missed Mr. Thimblefinger,\" he said, \"and I was afraid I had sat on him.\"  \"Oh, no!\" cried Mr. Thimblefinger, coming out from under the steps; \"I was just resting myself.\"  \"Mr. Thimblefinger will take care of himself, I'll be bound,\" exclaimed Mrs. Meadows. \"He's little; but is a mountain strong because"]]]
