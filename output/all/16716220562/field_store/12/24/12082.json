I don't wonder you're tired. You've had no sleep day or night, I'll be bound.\"  \"Not much. The neighbors were kind about offering but somehow I couldn't leave Joey with 'em. Besides, how can you sleep when you are worried half out of your mind?\"  \"I know! I know!\" nodded the other woman. \"Still you can't go on forever without rest. Next you know you will be down sick yourself and then where will your baby be--to say nothing of your other children. A mother has got to think ahead. Now listen. Would you trust me to watch the baby while you curled up on the sofa and got a wink or two of sleep? I'll promise to call you should there be an atom of change. Do now! Be a sensible woman. And how would you feel about my giving the little chap a drop of medicine? A Scotch doctor in the old country once gave me a prescription that I've tried on both Timmie and Martin and it did 'em worlds of good at a time just like this. It might do nothing for your child, mind. I'm not promising it would. Still, it couldn't hurt him and it might cure.\"  Julie's dulled mind caught the final word. _Cure!_ Alas, she had given up hope that anything in the world could do that. The reaction that came with the suggestion was so wonderful that it left her speechless.  \"Now see here,\" burst out Mrs. McGregor misinterpreting her silence, \"use your common sense. Do I look as if I had come to poison your baby? Why, woman, I love children better than anything on earth. They're a precious lot of bother, there's no denying, and sometimes I get that impatient with one or the other of 'em I could toss him out the window. But for all their hectoring, and their noise, and their dirt--their meddling, and smashing, and mending, I'd not be without them.\"  While speaking she had been touching the baby with a hand so yearning and tender that it could not be stayed. She had raised his head, smoothed his pillow, straightened the coverings that lay over him. It was amazing how quietly and deftly her hands moved. Even the child seemed conscious of her healing presence, for all of a sudden his wee fingers curled about one of hers and he smiled faintly.  \"See!\" exclaimed Mrs. McGregor, \"the baby is not afraid to trust me.\"  \"Nor am I any longer,\" put in Julie with eager surrender. \"Do as you like with Joey. You know better than I.\"  \"Oh, it isn't that,\" the visitor protested, rising. \"It is just that it's sometimes well not to leave a stone unturned. You might regret not having taken the chance. I'll slip upstairs and get the medicine. It won't take a minute.\"  \"If you'll be that kind.\"  The Scotchwoman needed no second bidding. She was gone and back again in a twinkling, the magic green bottle in her hand.  \"Now if I might have a cup of hot water,\" said she. \"I've a dropper here. We'll see what a spoonful of this mixture will do for the wee laddie. What is his name?\"  \"Joey.\"  Mrs. O'Dowd's eyes had brightened and they now beamed on her neighbor.  \"It's a nice name,\" replied Mrs. McGregor, beaming in turn. \"I always liked the name of Joseph. Well, Joey boy, we'll see if we can make you well. Here, little fellow!\"  Gently she forced the liquid between the baby's lips.  \"Now we'll sponge him a bit, put on a fresh slip, and give him some air!\"  \"But won't he----\"  \"Catch cold? Not if he is shielded from the draught. He'll like the air and feel the better for it. It will help him to breathe.\"  Noiselessly she went to work and within an hour both Joey and his surroundings took on a different aspect.  \"Now,\" said she to the grateful mother, \"you roll up in that comforter and take a nap. Don't worry about the baby. I'll be right here. Will you trust me?\"  Julie hesitated.  \"It's not that I won't trust you,\" murmured she. \"But you're so heavenly kind. Not another soul has done for me what you have and I'm a hundred times better acquainted with 'em, too. Of course I know they have all they can do without taking on the cares of others. I'm not blaming them. You yourself can't have much time to spare. Haven't you other things to do?\"  \"Of course I have,\" came with curt honesty from Mrs. McGregor. \"I've six children and they leave me little time for idling. But when I do take time away from 'em, I plan to take it to some purpose. Just now I have nothing more important to do than nurse this baby. It's my first job. So don't be worrying about my work. Luckily it is Saturday and Mary, Carl, and Timmie will look after the little tots and get the dinner. I told 'em to when I was there just now. Martin and Nell seldom give any trouble, and should James Frederick wake up, one of the boys is to run down and tell me.\"  Julie placed a hand impulsively on that of the other woman.  \"I can never thank you,\" murmured she brokenly.  \"Oh, don't be talking of thanks,\" Mrs. McGregor interrupted, cutting her short. \"My dosing may do no good and before the day is out you may be calling me a meddlesome old harridan. Wait and see what happens. I'm not one that sets much store by thanks, anyhow. After all, what does it amount to but a string of words? If we can cure the baby it will be all the thanks I want.\"  If the sentiment the final phrase so modestly expressed was genuine Mrs. McGregor at least received the boon she craved, for as if by magic the baby began to mend that very night and before the week passed was out of danger and on the high road to recovery. Julie's gratitude was touching to see.  \"'Twas Mrs. McGregor saved Joey,\" declared she to every person she met. \"She's as good as any doctor--better, for Joey might have died but for her. Should I go through life kneeling to her on my bended knees I never could thank her enough.\"  Julie O'Dowd did not go through life, however, kneeling before Mrs. McGregor on her bended knees; but she did a more practical and efficacious thing. Everywhere she went she sounded the praise of her neighbor; talked of her kindness, her wisdom, her unselfishness, until not only Mulberry Court, but the area adjoining it began to view the gaunt, austere figure from quite a different angle. Shyly the women began to nod a greeting to the stranger.  \"It's just her way to be curt and quick,\" explained they to one another. \"She doesn't mean a thing in the world by it. Julie says she's sharp and prickly as a chestnut burr, but with the sweetest of hearts inside.\"  Indeed it was not long before Mrs. McGregor proved her right to this generous summary of her character. Other neighbors gained courage to consult her about their children and in time about their troubles in general.  \"Ask Mrs. McGregor,\" became the slogan of Mulberry Court. \"She'll know.\"  And she unfailingly did. She it was who prescribed medicines; gave advice; suggested plain, common-sense remedies for every variety of dilemma. Nevertheless she wasted no words about it. She had no time to fool away, she let it be known. Whatever she did had to be done with pitiless directness. Often her council was delivered through a crack in the door or even given through the door itself; and there were instances when it was shouted through the keyhole. But no matter where the words came from they were always helpful and friendly and the neighbors came to understand the manner accompanying them and did not resent it.  Her children understood it too. Mary, Carl, Timmie, Martin, four-year-old Nell, and even wee James Frederick (whom Mrs. McGregor unfailingly addressed by his full name) all understood and worshipped their quick-tongued mother. Together with the rest of Mulberry Court they also had supreme faith in whatever she did and said, and were certain that every calamity under the sun could be set right if only she were consulted and her advice followed.  And yet loyal as they were, there was one point on which neither Carl nor Mary agreed with their mother. Of course she was right--she must be right; wasn't she always so? Yet notwithstanding this belief they could not but feel that it would be a far better arrangement for them to leave school and go into the cotton mills where their father had worked for so many years. Ever so many of the boys and girls they knew worked there. Why should they remain in the High School struggling with algebra, geometry, history, Latin, English and bookkeeping when they might be earning money? It seemed senseless. Certainly the family needed money badly enough. Were there not always endless pairs of shoes to be bought? Caps, mittens, suits, stockings, and underclothing to purchase; not to mention food and groceries? And then there was the rent.  Ah, Mary and Carl knew very well about the rent, the bills, and all the other worrisome things. Even Timmie, who was only nine, knew about them; and once Martin, aged six, had startled his elders by proclaiming on a sunny May morning, \"This is rent day, isn't it, Ma?\" in a tone of awe, as if the date marked some gruesome ceremony.  You came to understand about rent day when toward the end of the month there were no pennies to be had, and you were forced to wait for the shoes or rubbers you needed.  That rent day was a milestone to be dreaded even Nell vaguely guessed and when it had passed in safety all the McGregors, both big and little, joined in a general rejoicing.  Ma was the magician who accomplished that happy miracle. Ma always contrived to accomplish everything, so of course she managed rent day along with the rest of the wonders she performed. She made no secret, either, of how she did it. She sewed! Yes, she sewed for a dressmaker who sent her marvelous dresses to embroider. For Ma was very clever with her needle and right out of the blue sky could make the most beautiful flowers and figures with colored silks. She could also do beading and she was teaching Mary how to do it. Already Mary could do quite nice embroidery and exquisite plain sewing.  Ma was very proud of this.  But what Mary did chiefly when she was not at school was to help with the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23560"],["title","Carl and the Cotton Gin (#2)"],["body","so her mother would be free to sew. That was the important thing. Ma must not roughen her hands or the silks she worked with would be spoiled. So Mary cooked and scrubbed like a real little housewife; took care of the younger children and kept them quiet so they would not interrupt their mother.  And between school hours Carl and Tim helped also. They built the fires, wiped the dishes, ran errands, and brought home any bits of discarded wood they found in the streets. In fact, there was not one drone in the McGregor hive. Even James Frederick had learned to lie in his crib and play by himself when everybody was busy.  It was a happy family, the McGregors. Its members, it is true, did not have everything they wanted. They never expected that. Those who had mittens lacked new caps, and those who had caps were often forced to wear patched shoes and made-over stockings. Martin's reefer frequently did duty for Nell, and Mrs. McGregor's cape for Mary. However, all that did not matter. They were happy and that was the chief thing, happy in spite of patched clothing, coats that were outgrown, rubbers that were either sizes too small or dropped off at every step, and shoes that were common property. The little flat was sometimes hot in summer and cold in winter but it took more than that to dampen the McGregors' spirits.  When they had lentil soup, how steaming and delicious it was! When meat stew, what a dish for the gods! And who could have asked for a greater treat than a thick slice of Mary's fresh bread coated over with molasses or peanut butter?  Every month a long blue envelope containing a check from Uncle Frederick arrived and that, together with what Mary and her mother earned, kept the household going. But they seldom saw Uncle James Frederick Dillingham. He was always sailing to India, China, or South America. Sometimes letters came from him and picture postcards showing strange countries and people in foreign dress. But the check never failed to make its appearance and as it was highly important that it should, everybody agreed that since Uncle Frederick could not come himself he was almost as satisfactorily represented by this magic bit of blue paper. The check brought things and perhaps if Uncle Frederick himself had come he wouldn't. You could not tell about uncles you had never seen.  In the meantime the blue paper kept stew in the kettle and the shelter of Mulberry Court above their heads, and what better service could an uncle render his relatives?  Hence Uncle Frederick's name came to be mentioned constantly in the household.  \"Remember, Timmie, those are your Uncle Frederick Dillingham's rubber boots and be thankful to him for them,\" the boy's mother would observe when she brought home the purchase. Or \"Uncle Frederick is presenting you with those stockings, Carl. See you don't forget it.\"  And the children did not forget. Gradually their unknown uncle came to assume in their imagination a form that would have surprised him had he been suddenly confronted by it. It was that of a benevolent-faced fairy clad in robes of purple and ermine, and wearing on his head a crown resplendent with gems of myriad colors. In his hand he carried a scepter terminating in a star that far outshone the jewels he wore, a scepter all powerful to work miracles. He was the good angel of the McGregor home, the Aladdin to whom they owed all sorts of blessings.  And yet withal Uncle James Frederick Dillingham was one and the same person who sailed the _Charlotte_ to India, China, South America, or some other ephemeral port. How paradoxical was this dual rôle, how alluring and how ridiculous!     CHAPTER II  CARL TELLS A STORY   It was April. Already spring was in the air. The grass in the parks was turning green, forsythia bloomed golden, and boys were playing marbles on the streets and sidewalks. Even Mulberry Court, shut in as it was, felt the impulse of the awakening season. The landlord came, looked over the premises, and after viewing the general shabbiness became reckless enough to order a broken windowpane to be reset, some of the tumble-down ceilings to be repaired, and the fire escapes and window frames to be repainted.  Painting at Mulberry Court was a terrible ordeal. As there was not an inch of the place that was not crowded to the limit of its capacity, painting meant that milk bottles, improvised ice chests, and woodpiles must be put somewhere else; and where that somewhere could be was an enigma. Furthermore, to add to this difficulty there were the children--dozens of them tumbling over one another and surging in and out the doors, a fact that rendered painting a precarious undertaking. Youthful investigators examined the moist pigment; chubby fingers drew hieroglyphics in it; while the less curious forgot it altogether and carried away on their garments imprints of vermilion and black that transformed their otherwise dingy garments into robes of oriental splendor.  Carl McGregor was no exception to the rule for wherever calamity lurked he was sure to be in its vicinity.  \"I'd know you'd never rest until you got a patch of red paint on yourself,\" announced his mother, surveying him as he started toward the door. \"As, if buying you sweaters ain't enough without your leaning plumb up against the fire escape and stamping a whole decalcomania of red stripes on your back like as if you were a convict.\"  \"Is there paint on me, Ma?\"  \"Is there? I suppose you had no notion of it.\"  \"I hadn't--honest Injun.\"  \"Well, aside from the fact that you're barred up and down neat as if the lines were ruled there's nothing the matter with you,\" returned his mother with a faint smile.  \"Oh, I'm awfully sorry, Ma. Truly I am.\"  \"Sorry? I'll be bound you are. You are always a bundle of regrets when it is too late to help anything. However, you need weep no tears for that sweater needed washing anyway. You're that rough on your clothes that none of 'em keep clean more than a minute. I'll get some gasoline and soak it out in the shed and it will be like new. Peel it off and give it to me.\"  \"I'm sorry, Ma,\" the boy repeated.  \"It's no great matter, sonny. Children must be children. I'm past expecting them to be grown-ups,\" his mother said kindly. \"If you hadn't been getting into the paint you most likely would have been getting into something else. You have a genius for such mishaps. I'm glad it was no worse.\"  Reassured, Carl grinned.  \"I do seem to have a good many--\" he hesitated, then added, \"misfortunes.\"  \"Misfortunes, do you call 'em? Sure that's a pretty polite word to apply to the things that manage to happen to you,\" sniffed Mrs. McGregor. \"I suppose it was a misfortune when you tumbled underneath the watering cart; and a misfortune when you sat down in the wet tar! A misfortune when you sent the snowball through the schoolroom window; to say nothing of the creamcake you treated Jakie Sullivan to that well-nigh killed him.\"  \"I didn't know the creamcake was going to make him sick.\"  \"No; 'twas just your misfortune. You seem to attract adventures like that. Why, if I was to let you go into the cotton mills as you are always begging to do you'd have every machine there out of order in less than a week and yourself hashed up into little pieces into the bargain.\"  She had touched upon an unlucky subject for instantly, with flaming face, the lad confronted her.  \"No, I wouldn't. I wish you would let me go into the mills, Ma. You might let me try it. Ever so many boys no older than I are working there and earning oodles of money. If we had more money we could----\"  \"We could be having an automobile, no doubt, and going to Palm Beach winters,\" was the grim response. \"Well, Palm Beach or not, you're not going into any mill so long as we can keep body and soul together without your doing it. You are going to get an education--you and Mary too--if it costs me my life. I'm not going to have you grow up knowing nothing and being nothing. Some day you'll see I was right and thank me for it.\"  \"I thank you now, Ma,\" declared Carl soberly. \"But that doesn't make me relish Latin and history any better.\"  \"No matter if it doesn't. What you like is of no consequence,\" Mrs. McGregor announced, with a majestic sweep of her hand. \"The chief thing is that you exercise your mind and learn how to use it. The Latin itself amounts to nothing. It is like boxing gloves or a punching bag, a thing that serves its turn to limber up your brain. It is learning to think that counts.\"  Carl's face brightened.  \"The teacher was saying something like that just the other day,\" asserted he eagerly. \"He was telling us about some of the people who had done great things in the world and explaining how long and how hard they had to work at them. The inventors, for instance, had to think and think about the things they invented. It didn't just come to them all in a minute as I used to believe it did.\"  Although his mother did not look up from her sewing she nodded encouragingly.  \"There was Eli Whitney,\" continued Carl, coming nearer. \"I remembered about him because of the mills here. He invented the cotton gin, you know. Mr. Kimball told us that Whitney went through Yale and then started down South to be a tutor in somebody's family without any idea of ever being an inventor. But when he got to where he was going the people who had hired him had changed their minds and found somebody else and poor Eli Whitney was out of a job.\"  \"A shabby trick!\"  \"Yes. Still, it was lucky for him, just the same,\" responded Carl, \"because on the way down he had met the widow of General Greene and she was sorry for him and asked him to her house. He'd just been vaccinated because there was lots of smallpox in the South and he was feeling rotten. You know how sore your arm gets and how sick you are sometimes. Remember Martin? Well, anyhow, Mrs. Greene either knew what it meant to be vaccinated or else she was kind of ashamed of the way her part of the country had treated"]]]
