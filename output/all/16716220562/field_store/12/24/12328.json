Then a beam of light flared from a headlamp, and he saw the blue crackle of a stunner. He jerked back as the beam bounced off the metal walls. Then he was firing point blank down the corridor, his stunner on a tight beam, a deadly pencil of violent energy. He heard a muffled scream and a bulk loomed up in front of him, crashed to the deck at his feet.  He fired again. Another crash, a shout, and then the sound of footsteps retreating. He waited, his heart pounding, but there was nothing more.  The first attempt on the control cabin had failed.         *       *       *       *       *  Five minutes later the second attempt began. This time there was no warning sound. A sudden, ear-splitting crash, a groan of tortured metal, and the barricaded hatchway glowed dull red. Another crash followed. The edge of the hatch split open, pouring acrid Murexide fumes into the cabin. A third explosion breached the door six inches; Greg could see headlamps in the corridor beyond.  He fired through the crack, pressing down the stud until the stunner scorched his hand. Then he heard boots clanging up the other corridor. He pressed back against the wall, waited until the sounds were near, then threw open the hatch. For an instant he made a perfect target, but the raiders did not fire. The stunner buzzed in his hand, and once again the footfalls retreated.  They _were_ being careful!  Silence then, and blackness. Minutes passed ... five, ten.... Greg checked the time again. It was over twenty minutes since Tom had talked to him. What had happened? Whatever Tom had planned must have misfired, or something would have happened by now. For a moment he considered leaving his post and starting down the dark corridor to search ... but where to search? There was nothing to do but wait and hope for a miracle.  Then suddenly the lights blazed on in the control cabin and the corridor outside. An attention signal buzzed in Greg's earphones. \"All right, Hunter, it's all over,\" a voice grated. \"You've got five minutes to get down to No. 3 lock. If you make us come get you, you'll get hurt.\"  \"I'll chance it,\" Greg snapped back. \"Come on up.\"  \"We're through fooling,\" the voice said. \"You'd better get down here. And bring your brother with you.\"  \"Sure,\" Greg said. \"Start holding your breath.\"  The contact broke for a moment, then clicked on again. This time it was another voice. \"We've got Johnny Coombs down here,\" it said. \"You want him to stay alive, you start moving. Without your stunner.\"  Greg chewed his lip. They could be bluffing ... but they might not be. \"I want to see Johnny,\" he said.  On the control panel a viewscreen flickered to life. \"Take a look, then,\" the voice said in his earphones.  They had Johnny, all right. A burly guard was holding his good arm behind his back. Greg could see the speaker wires jerked loose from his helmet.  \"It's up to you,\" the voice said. \"You've got three minutes. If you're not down here by then, this helmet comes off and your friend goes out the lock. It's quick that way, but it's not very pleasant.\"  Johnny was shaking his head violently; the guard wrenched at his arm, and the miner's face twisted in pain. \"Two minutes,\" the voice said.  \"Okay,\" Greg said. \"I'm coming down.\"  \"Drop the stunner right there.\"  He dropped the weapon onto the deck. Three steps out into the corridor, and two guards were there to meet him, stunners raised. They marched him up the ramp to the outer level corridor and around to No. 3 lock.  They were waiting there with Johnny. A moment later the guards herded them through the lock and into the hold of the Ranger ship, stripped off their suits, and searched them.  A big man with a heavy face and coarse black hair came into the cabin. He looked at Johnny and Greg and grunted. \"You must be Hunter,\" he said to Greg. \"Where's the other one?\"  \"What other one?\" Greg said.  \"Your brother. Where is he?\"  \"How would I know?\" Greg said.  The man's face darkened. \"You'd be smart to watch your tongue,\" he said. \"We know there were three of you, we want the other one.\"  The man turned to a guard. \"What about it?\"  \"Don't know, Doc. Nobody's reported him.\"  \"Then take a crew and search the ship. We were due back hours ago. He's in there somewhere.\"  \"Sure, Doc.\" The guard disappeared through the lock. The man called Doc motioned Greg and Johnny through into the main cabin.  \"What are you planning to do with us?\" Greg demanded.  \"You'll find out soon enough.\" Doc's mouth twisted angrily.  A guard burst into the cabin. \"Doc, there's just nobody there! We've scoured the ship.\"  \"You think he just floated away in his space suit?\" Doc growled. \"_Find him._ Tawney only needs one of them, but we can't take a chance on the other one getting back....\" He broke off, his eyes on the viewscreen. \"Did you check those scout ships?\"  \"No, I thought....\"  \"Get down there and check them.\" Doc turned back to the viewscreen impatiently.  Greg caught Johnny's eye, saw the big miner's worried frown. \"Where is he?\" he whispered.  \"I don't know. Thought you did....\"  \"All I know is that he had some kind of scheme in mind.\"  \"Shut up,\" Doc said to them. \"If you're smart, you'll be strapping down before we....\" He broke off in mid sentence, listening.  Quite suddenly, the Ranger ship had begun to vibrate. Somewhere, far away, there was the muffled rumble of engines.  Doc whirled to the viewscreen. Greg and Johnny looked at the same instant, and Johnny groaned.  Below them, the _Scavenger_'s jets were flaring. First the pale starter flame, then a long stream of fire, growing longer as the engines developed thrust.  Doc slammed down a switch, roared into a speaker. \"That scout ship ... stop it! He's trying to make a break!\"  Two guards appeared at the lock almost instantly, but it was too late. Already she was straining at her magnetic cable moorings; then the exhaust flared, and the little scout ship leaped away from the orbit-ship, moving out at a tangent to the asteroid's orbit, picking up speed, moving faster and faster....  In toward the orbit of Mars.  The man called Doc had gone pale. Now he snapped on the speaker again. \"Frank? Stand by on missile control. He's asking for it.\"  \"Right,\" the voice came back. \"I'm sighting in.\"  The _Scavenger_ was moving fast now, dwindling in the viewscreen. One panel of the screen went telescopic to track her. \"All right,\" Doc said. \"Fire one and two.\"  From both sides of the Ranger, tiny rockets flared. Like twin bullets the homing shells moved out, side by side, in the track of the escaping _Scavenger_. With a strangled cry, Greg leaped forward, but Johnny caught his arm.  \"Johnny, _Tom's on ... that thing_....\"  \"I know. But he's got a chance.\"  Already the homing shells were out of sight; only the twin flares were visible. Greg stared helplessly at the tiny light-spot of the _Scavenger_. At first she had been moving straight, but now she was dodging and twisting, her side-jets flaring at irregular intervals. The twin pursuit shells mimicked each change in course, drawing closer to her every second.  And then there was a flash, so brilliant it nearly blinded them, and the _Scavenger_ burst apart in space. The second shell struck a fragment; there was another flash. Then there was nothing but a nebulous powdering of tiny metal fragments.  The last run of the _Scavenger_ had ended.  Dazed, Greg turned away from the screen, and somewhere, as if in a dream, he heard Doc saying, \"All right, boys, strap this pair down. We've got a lot of work to do before we can get out of here.\"     7. Prisoners   Wherever they were planning to take them, the captors took great pains to make sure that their two prisoners did not escape before they were underway. Greg and Johnny were strapped down securely into accelleration cots. Two burly guards were assigned to them, and the guards were taking their job seriously. One of the two was watching them at all times, and both men held their stunners on ready.  Meanwhile, under Doc's orders, the crew of the Jupiter Equilateral ship began a systematic looting of the orbit-ship they had disabled. Earlier they had merely searched the cabins and compartments. Now a steady stream of pressure-suited men crossed through the airlocks into the crippled vessel, marched back with packing cases full of tape records, microfilm spools, stored computer data ... anything that might conceivably contain information. The control cabin was literally torn apart. Every storage hold was ransacked.  A team of six men was dispatched to the asteroid surface, searching for any sign of mining or prospecting activity. They came back an hour later, long-faced and empty handed. Doc took their reports, his scowl growing deeper and deeper.  Finally the last of the searchers reported in. \"Doc, we'd scraped it clean, and there's nothing there. Not one thing that we didn't check before.\"  \"There's _got_ to be something there,\" Doc said.  \"You tell me where else to look, and I'll do it.\"  Doc shook his head ominously. \"Tawney's not going to like it,\" he said. \"There's no other place it could be....\"  \"Well, at least we have this pair,\" the other said, jerking a thumb at Greg and Johnny. \"They'll know.\"  Doc looked at them darkly. \"Yes, and they'll tell, too, or I don't know Tawney.\"  Greg watched it all happening, heard the noises, saw the packing-cases come through the cabin, and still he could not quite believe it. He caught Johnny's eye, then turned away, suddenly sick. Johnny shook his head. \"Take it easy, boy.\"  \"He didn't even have a chance,\" Greg said.  \"I know that. He must have known it too.\"  \"But why? What was he thinking of?\"  \"Maybe he thought he could make it. Maybe he thought it was the only chance....\"  There was no other answer that Greg could see, and the ache in his chest was deeper.  There was no way to bring Tom back now. However things had been between them, they could never be changed now. But he knew that as long as he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23887"],["title","Strange Stories from History for Young People (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net) from page images generously made available by Kentuckiana Digital Library (http://kdl.kyvl.org/)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

PREFACE.   In calling the tales in this volume \"Strange Stories\" I have sought simply to indicate that, in the main, they are unfamiliar to youthful readers, and that most of them relate deeds and occurrences some what out of the common. In choosing the themes I have tried to avoid the tales that have been often used, and to tell only those of which young readers generally have not before heard.  Of course, a book of this kind can make no pretension to originality of matter, as the facts used in it are to be found in historical works of recognized authority, though many of them have been drawn from books that are not easily accessible to the majority of readers. If there is any originality in my little volume it is in the manner in which the tales are told. I have endeavored to tell them as simply as possible, and at the same time with as much dramatic force and fervor as I could command, while adhering rigidly to the facts of history.  It would be impossible for me to say to what sources I am indebted for materials. The incidents related have been familiar to me for years, as they are to all persons whose reading of history has been at all extensive, and I cannot say with any certainty how much of each I learned from one and how much from another historical writer. Nor is it in any way necessary that I should do so, as the recorded facts of history are common property. But a special acknowledgment is due to Mr. James Parton in the case of the tale of the Negro Fort, and also for certain details in those relating to the New Orleans campaign of 1814-15. In that field Mr. Parton is an original investigator, to whose labors every writer on the subject must be indebted. I wish also to acknowledge my obligation to Mr. A. B. Meek, the author of a little work entitled \"Romantic Passages in Southwestern History,\" for the main facts in the stories of the Charge of the Hounds and the Battle of the Canoes on the Alabama River; but, with respect to those matters, I have had the advantage of private sources of information also.  Most of the stories in the volume were originally written for _Harper's Young People_; one was first published in _Good Cheer_, and a few in other periodicals. I owe thanks to the editors and publishers concerned for permission to reprint them in this form.     CONTENTS.                                                              PAGE HISTORY STORIES.

During the war of 1812-14, between Great Britain and the United States, the weak Spanish Governor of Florida--for Florida was then Spanish territory--permitted the British to make Pensacola their base of operations against us. This was a gross outrage, as we were at peace with Spain at the time, and General Jackson, acting on his own responsibility, invaded Florida in retaliation.  Among the British at that time was an eccentric Irish officer, Colonel Edward Nichols, who enlisted and tried to make soldiers of a large number of the Seminole Indians. In 1815, after the war was over, Colonel Nichols again visited the Seminoles, who were disposed to be hostile to the United States, as Colonel Nichols himself was, and made an astonishing treaty with them, in which an alliance, offensive and defensive, between Great Britain and the Seminoles, was agreed upon. We had made peace with Great Britain a few months before, and yet this ridiculous Irish colonel signed a treaty binding Great Britain to fight us whenever the Seminoles in the Spanish territory of Florida should see fit to make a war! If this extraordinary performance had been all, it would not have mattered so much, for the British government refused to ratify the treaty; but it was not all. Colonel Nichols, as if determined to give us as much trouble as he could, built a strong fortress on the Appalachicola River, and gave it to his friends the Seminoles, naming it \"The British Post on the Appalachicola,\" where the British had not the least right to have any post whatever. Situated on a high bluff, with flanks securely guarded by the river on one side and a swamp on the other, this fort, properly defended, was capable of resisting the assaults of almost any force that could approach it; and Colonel Nichols was determined that it should be properly defended, and should be a constant menace and source of danger to the United States. He armed it with one 32-pounder cannon, three 24-pounders, and eight other guns. In the matter of small-arms he was even more liberal. He supplied the fort with 2500 muskets, 500 carbines, 400 pistols, and 500 swords. In the magazines he stored 300 quarter casks of rifle powder and 763 barrels of ordinary gunpowder.  When Colonel Nichols went away, his Seminoles soon wandered off, leaving the fort without a garrison. This gave an opportunity to a negro bandit and desperado named Garçon to seize the place, which he did, gathering about him a large band of runaway negroes, Choctaw "]]]
