As an example of successful pieces of this kind, consider MacDowell's \"The Eagle.\" It is the musical realization of Tennyson's well-known poem:      \"He clasps the crag with crooked hands;     Close to the sun in lonely lands,     Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.     The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;     He watches from his mountain walls,     And like a thunderbolt he falls.\"  Of course the crag and the crooked hands and the azure world must be granted the composer, but general exaltation and loneliness are expressed in the severe melody of the opening. The wrinkling and crawling of the sea far below are splendidly achieved in the soft, shimmering liquidity of the music. Then there are two abrupt, but soft, short chords that will represent, to the imaginative, the quick fixing of the eagle's heart on some prey beneath; and there follows a sudden precipitation down the keyboard, _fortississimo_, that represents the thunderous swoop of the eagle with startling effect.  On the other hand, the \"Moonshine\" seems to be attempting too much. \"Winter\" does better, for it has a freezing stream, a mill-wheel, and a \"widow bird.\" These \"four little poems\" of opus 32 had been preceded by six fine \"Idylls\" based on lyrics of Goethe's. The first, a forest scene, has a distinct flavor of the woods, the second is all laziness and drowsiness, and the third is moonlight mystery. The fourth is as intense in its suppressed spring ecstasy as the radiant poem itself singing how      \"Soft the ripples spill and hurry     To the opulent embankment.\"  The six short \"Poems\" (op. 31) based on poems of Heine's are particularly successful, especially in the excellent opportunity of the lyric describing the wail of the Scottish woman who plays her harp on the cliff, and sings above the raging of sea and wind. The third catches most happily the whimsicality of the poet's reminiscences of childhood, but hardly, I think, the contrasting depth and wildness of his complaint that, along with childhood's games, have vanished Faith and Love and Truth. In the last, however, the cheery majesty that realizes Heine's likening of Death to a cool night after the sultry day of Life, is superb.  Then there are some four-hand pieces, two collections, that leave no excuse for clinging to the hackneyed classics or modern trash. They are not at all difficult, and the second player has something to employ his mind besides accompanying chords. They are meaty, and effective almost to the point of catchiness. The \"Tale of the Knights\" is full of chivalric fire and martial swing, while the \"Ballad\" is as exquisitely dainty as a peach-blossom. The \"Hindoo Maiden\" has a deal of the thoroughly Oriental color and feeling that distinguish the three solos of \"Les Orientales,\" of which \"Clair de Lune\" is one of his most original and graceful writings. The duet, \"In Tyrol,\" has a wonderful crystal carillon and a quaint shepherd piping a faint reminiscence of the Wagnerian school of shepherds. This is one of a series of \"Moon Pictures\" for four hands, based on Hans Christian Andersen's lore. Two concertos for piano and orchestra are dazzling feats of virtuosity; one of them is reviewed at length in A.J. Goodrich' book, \"Musical Analysis.\" He has written also a book of artistic moment called \"Twelve Virtuoso-Studies,\" and two books of actual gymnastics for piano practice.  [Music: CLAIR DE LUNE.      La lune était sereine et jouait sur les flots.     La fenêtre enfin libre est ouverte à la brise;     La sultane regarde, et la mer qui se brise,     Là-bas, d'un flot d'argent brode les noir îlots.                  (Victor Hugo, \"Les Orientales.\")  E.A. MACDOWELL, Op. 37, No. 1.  Copyright, 1889, Arthur P. Schmidt.]  But MacDowell did not reach his freedom without a struggle against academia. His opus 10 is a piano suite published at the age of twenty-two, and opus 14 is another; both contain such obsolescences as a presto, fugue, scherzino, and the like. But for all the classic garb, the hands are the hands of Esau. In one of the pieces there is even a motto tucked, \"All hope leave ye behind who enter here!\" Can he have referred to the limbo of classicism?  It is a far cry from these to the liberality that inspired the new impressionism of \"Woodland Sketches\" (op. 51) and \"Sea Pieces\" (op. 55), in which he gives a legitimate musical presentation of a faintly perfumed \"Wild Rose\" or \"Water Lily,\" but goes farther, and paints, with wonderful tone, the moods inspired by reverie upon the uncouth dignity and stoic savagery of \"An Indian Lodge,\" the lonely New England twilight of \"A Deserted Farm,\" and all the changing humors of the sea, majesty of sunset or star-rise, and even the lucent emerald of an iceberg. His \"From Uncle Remus\" is not so successful; indeed, MacDowell is not sympathetic with negro music, and thinks that if we are to found a national school on some local manner, we should find the Indian more congenial than the lazy, sensual slave.  He has carried this belief into action, not only by his scientific interest in the collection and compilation of the folk-music of our prairies, but by his artistic use of actual Indian themes in one of his most important works, his \"Indian Suite\" for full orchestra, a work that has been often performed, and always with the effect of a new and profound sensation, particularly in the case of the deeply impressive dirge.  A proof of the success of MacDowell as a writer in the large forms is the fact that practically all of his orchestral works are published in Germany and here, not only in full score, but in arrangement for four hands. They include \"Hamlet;\" \"Ophelia\" (op. 22); \"Launcelot and Elaine\" (op. 26), with its strangely mellow and varied use of horns for Launcelot, and the entrusting of the plaintive fate of \"the lily maid of Astolat\" to the string and wood-wind choirs; \"The Saracens\" and \"The Lovely Alda\" (op. 30), two fragments from the Song of Roland; and the Suite (op. 42), which has been played at least eight times in Germany and eleven times here.  The first movement of this last is called \"In a Haunted Forest.\" You are reminded of Siegfried by the very name of the thing, and the music enforces the remembrance somewhat, though very slightly.  Everything reminds one of Wagner nowadays,--even his predecessors. Rudyard Kipling has by his individuality so copyrighted one of the oldest verse-forms, the ballad, that even \"Chevy Chace\" looks like an advance plagiarism. So it is with Wagner. Almost all later music, and much of the earlier, sounds Wagnerian. But MacDowell has been reminded of Bayreuth very infrequently in this work. The opening movement begins with a _sotto voce_ syncopation that is very presentative of the curious audible silence of a forest. The wilder moments are superbly instrumented.  The second movement, \"Summer Idyl,\" is delicious, particularly in the chances it gives the flautist. There is a fragmentary cantilena which would make the fortune of a comic opera. The third number, \"In October,\" is particularly welcome in our music, which is strangely and sadly lacking in humor. There is fascinating wit throughout this harvest revel. \"The Shepherdess' Song\" is the fourth movement. It is not précieuse, and it is not banal; but its simplicity of pathos is a whit too simple. The final number, \"Forest Spirits,\" is a brilliant climax. The Suite as a whole is an important work. It has detail of the most charming art. Best of all, it is staunchly individual. It is MacDowellian.  While the modern piano sonata is to me anathema as a rule, there are none of MacDowell's works that I like better than his writings in this form. They are to me far the best since Beethoven, not excepting even Chopin's (_pace_ his greatest prophet, Huneker). They seem to me to be of such stuff as Beethoven would have woven had he known in fact the modern piano he saw in fancy.  The \"Sonata Tragica\" (op. 45) begins in G minor, with a bigly passionate, slow introduction (metronomed in the composer's copy, [quarter-note]-50). The first subject is marked in the same copy, though not in the printed book, [half-note]-69, and the appealingly pathetic second subject is a little slower. The free fantasy is full of storm and stress, with a fierce pedal-point on the trilled leading-tone. In the reprise the second subject, which was at first in the dominant major, is now in the tonic major, though the key of the sonata is G minor. The allegro is metronomed [quarter-note]-138, and it is very short and very wild. Throughout, the grief is the grief of a strong soul; it never degenerates into whine. Its largo is like the tread of an Æschylean _choros_, its allegro movements are wild with anguish, and the occasional uplifting into the major only emphasizes the sombre whole, like the little rifts of clearer harmony in Beethoven's \"Funeral March on the Death of a Hero.\"  The last movement begins with a ringing _pomposo_, and I cannot explain its meaning better than by quoting Mrs. MacDowell's words: \"Mr. MacDowell's idea was, so to speak, as follows: He wished to heighten the darkness of tragedy by making it follow closely on the heels of triumph. Therefore, he attempted to make the last movement a steadily progressive triumph, which, at its climax, is utterly broken and shattered. In doing this he has tried to epitomize the whole work. While in the other movements he aimed at expressing tragic details, in the last he has tried to generalize; thinking that the most poignant tragedy is that of catastrophe in the hour of triumph.\"  The third sonata (op. 57) is dedicated to Grieg and to the musical exploitation of an old-time Skald reciting glorious battles, loves, and deaths in an ancient castle. The atmosphere of mystery and barbaric grandeur is obtained and sustained by means new to piano literature and potent in color and vigor. The sonata formula is warped to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23800"],["title","Contemporary American Composers (#5)"],["body","of the poet, but the themes have the classic ideal of kinship. The battle-power of the work is tremendous. Huneker calls it \"an epic of rainbow and thunder,\" and Henry T. Finck, who has for many years devoted a part of his large ardor to MacDowell's cause, says of the work: \"It is MacDowellish,--more MacDowellish than anything he has yet written. It is the work of a musical thinker. There are harmonies as novel as those we encounter in Schubert, Chopin, or Grieg, yet with a stamp of their own.\"  The \"Sonata Eroica\" (op. 50) bears the legend \"Flos regum Arthurus.\" It is also in G minor. The spirit of King Arthur dominates the work ideally, and justifies not only the ferocious and warlike first subject with its peculiar and influential rhythm, but the old-fashioned and unadorned folk-tone of the second subject. In the working out there is much bustle and much business of trumpets. In the reprise the folk-song appears in the tonic minor, taken most unconventionally in the bass under elaborate arpeggiations in the right hand. The coda, as in the other sonata, is simply a strong passage of climax. Arthur's supernatural nature doubtless suggested the second movement, with its elfin airs, its flibbertigibbet virtuosity, and its magic of color. The third movement might have been inspired by Tennyson's version of Arthur's farewell to Guinevere, it is such a rich fabric of grief. The finale seems to me to picture the Morte d'Arthur, beginning with the fury of a storm along the coast, and the battle \"on the waste sand by the waste sea.\" Moments of fire are succeeded by exquisite deeps of quietude, and the death and apotheosis of Arthur are hinted with daring and complete equivalence of art with need.  Here is no longer the tinkle and swirl of the elf dances; here is no more of the tireless search for novelty in movement and color. This is \"a flash of the soul that can.\" Here is Beethoven _redivivus_. For half a century we have had so much pioneering and scientific exploration after piano color and tenderness and fire, that men have neglected its might and its tragic powers. Where is the piano-piece since Beethoven that has the depth, the breadth, the height of this huge solemnity? Chopin's sensuous wailing does not afford it. Schumann's complex eccentricities have not given it out. Brahms is too passionless. Wagner neglected the piano. It remained for a Yankee to find the austere peak again! and that, too, when the sonata was supposed to be a form as exhausted as the epic poem. But all this is the praise that one is laughed at for bestowing except on the graves of genius.  The cautious Ben Jonson, when his erstwhile taproom roisterer, Will Shakespeare, was dead, defied \"insolent Greece or haughty Rome\" to show his superior. With such authority, I feel safe in at least defying the contemporary schools of insolent Russia or haughty Germany to send forth a better musicwright than our fellow townsman, Edward MacDowell.   _Edgar Stillman Kelley._  [Illustration: EDGAR STILLMAN KELLEY.]  While his name is known wherever American music is known in its better aspects, yet, like many another American, his real art can be discovered only from his manuscripts. In these he shows a very munificence of enthusiasm, scholarship, invention, humor, and originality.  [Illustration: Autograph of Edgar Stillman Kelley]  Kelley is as thorough an American by descent as one could ask for, his maternal ancestors having settled in this country in 1630, his paternal progenitors in 1640, A.D. Indeed, one of the ancestors of his father made the dies for the pine-tree shilling, and a great-great-grandfather fought in the Revolution.  Kelley began his terrestrial career April 14, 1857, in Wisconsin. His father was a revenue officer; his mother a skilled musician, who taught him the piano from his eighth year to his seventeenth, when he went to Chicago and studied harmony and counterpoint under Clarence Eddy, and the piano under Ledochowski. It is interesting to note that Kelley was diverted into music from painting by hearing \"Blind Tom\" play Liszt's transcription of Mendelssohn's \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" music. I imagine that this idiot-genius had very little other influence of this sort in his picturesque career.  After two years in Chicago, Kelley went to Germany, where, in Stuttgart, he studied the piano with Kruger and Speidel, organ with Finck, composition and orchestration with Seiffritz. While in Germany, Kelley wrote a brilliant and highly successful concert polonaise for four hands, and a composition for strings.  In 1880 he was back in America and settled in San Francisco, with whose musical life he was long and prominently identified as a teacher and critic. Here he wrote his first large work, the well-known melodramatic music to \"Macbeth.\" A local benefactor, John Parrot, paid the expenses of a public performance, the great success of which persuaded McKee Rankin, the actor, to make an elaborate production of both play and music. This ran for three weeks in San Francisco to crowded houses, which is a remarkable record for many reasons. A shabby New York production at an ill-chosen theatre failed to give the work an advantageous hearing; but it has been played by orchestras several times since, and William H. Sherwood has made transcriptions of parts of it for piano solo.  The \"Macbeth\" music is of such solid value that it reaches the dignity of a flowing commentary. Beyond and above this it is an interpretation, making vivid and awesome the deep import of the play, till even the least imaginative auditor must feel its thrill.  Thus the gathering of the witches begins with a slow horror, which is surely Shakespeare's idea, and not the comic-opera _can-can_ it is frequently made. As various other elfs and terrors appear, they are appropriately characterized in the music, which also adds mightily to the terror of the murder scene. Throughout, the work is that of a thinker. Like much of Kelley's other music, it is also the work of a fearless and skilled programmatist, especially in the battle-scenes, where it suggests the crash of maces and swords, and the blare of horns, the galloping of horses, and the general din of huge battle. Leading-motives are much used, too, with good effect and most ingenious elaboration, notably the _Banquo_ motive. A certain amount of Gaelic color also adds interest to the work, particularly a stirring Gaelic march. The orchestration shows both scholarship and daring.  An interesting subject is suggested by Kelley's experience in hunting out a good motif for the galloping horses of \"Macbeth.\" He could find nothing suitably representative of storm-hoofed chargers till his dreams came to the rescue with a genuinely inspired theme. Several other exquisite ideas have come to him in his sleep in this way; one of them is set down in the facsimile reproduced herewith. On one occasion he even dreamed an original German poem and a fitting musical setting.  Dr. Wm. A. Hammond, in his book on \"Sleep and Its Derangements,\" is inclined to scout the possibility of a really valuable inspiration in sleep. He finds no satisfactory explanation for Tartini's famous \"Devil's Sonata\" or Coleridge' proverbial \"Kubla Khan.\" He takes refuge in saying that at least the result could not be equal to the dreamer's capabilities when awake; but Kelley's \"Macbeth\" music was certainly an improvement on what he could invent out of the land of Nod.  After composing a comic opera, which was refused by the man for whom it was written because it was too good, he drifted into journalism, and wrote reviews and critiques which show a very liberal mind capable of appreciating things both modern and classic.  Kelley was again persuaded to write a comic opera to the artistic libretto, \"Puritania,\" by C.M.S. McLellan, a brilliant satirist, who has since won fortune by his highly successful and frequently artistic burlesquery. The work won excellent praise in Boston, where it had one hundred performances. The work musically was not only conscientious, but really graceful and captivating. It received the most glowing encomiums from people of musical culture, and largely enhanced Kelley's musical reputation in its run of something over a year. On its tour Kelley was also the musical conductor, in which capacity he has frequently served elsewhere.  Kelley plainly deserves preëminence among American composers for his devotion to, and skill in, the finer sorts of humorous music. No other American has written so artfully, so happily, or so ambitiously in this field. A humorous symphony and a Chinese suite are his largest works on this order.  The symphony follows the life of \"Gulliver in Lilliput.\" In development and intertwining of themes and in brilliance of orchestration, it maintains symphonic dignity, while in play of fancy, suggestive programmaticism, and rollicking enthusiasm it is infectious with wit. Gulliver himself is richly characterized with a burly, blustering English theme. The storm that throws him on the shores of Lilliput is handled with complete mastery, certain phrases picturing the toss of the billows, another the great roll of the boat, others the rattle of the rigging and the panic of the crew; and all wrought up to a demoniac climax at the wreck. As the stranded Gulliver falls asleep, the music hints his nodding off graphically. The entrance of the Lilliputians is perhaps the happiest bit of the whole delicious work. By adroit devices in instrumentation, their tiny band toots a minute national hymn of irresistible drollery. The sound of their wee hammers and the rest of the ludicrous adventures are carried off in unfailing good humor. The scene finally changes to the rescuing ship. Here a most hilarious hornpipe is interrupted by the distant call of Gulliver's aria, and the rescue is consummated delightfully.  In nothing has Kelley showed such wanton scholarship and such free-reined fancy as in his Chinese suite for orchestra, \"Aladd"]]]
