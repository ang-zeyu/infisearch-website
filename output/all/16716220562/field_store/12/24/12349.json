I purpose offering him the same terms as were given to him by his last employers.  He wants very little--and no current coin.  A good knife or two and some brass rings will satisfy him.  And as to his work that he is to do for you, I tell you frankly that he will not do a stroke, but he will tramp with you upon hunting expeditions till he will tire you out; he will be as keen-scented as a dog, a splendid tracker of every kind of wild beast, and if needs be he will fight for you bravely to the death.\"  \"Well, you couldn't give him a better character,\" said the doctor, \"for our purpose.  But what bad qualities have you to put against this?\"  \"Oh, he is a very wolf at eating.\"  \"Well, it's only fair that he should be,\" said Mark, \"if he hunts for and finds the meat.\"  \"I quite agree with you,\" said the captain.  \"Then let me see; I did tell you that he won't do a stroke of work.  He is too great a swell-- for he really is a chief, and was beaten by a stronger party and had to retreat for his life.\"  \"But I say,\" said Mark, \"how are we going to get on with him if he is going to carry on in that stuck-up, haughty way?\"  \"Oh, that's nothing,\" said the captain, laughing.  \"He puts that on when he comes into camp, to show his contempt for my men.  A few of the larky spirits teased him a bit some time ago, and he wouldn't stand it.  But I have seen a good deal of him, and he likes me because I wigged the men and gave them to understand before him that I would have none of that nonsense.  Why, when he is away out in the forest or veldt with a hunting party--and people treat him well--he is like a merry boy, a regular child of nature.  But treat him with contempt, and it raises his bile directly.  We are too fond of treating these natives as niggers, but some of them are fine fellows, and as brave as lions--Pooh! Nonsense!  As brave as men can be.  Yes,\" he continued, as an orderly appeared, \"send in Mak.\"  The fine-looking black stepped in, to stand in dignified silence, looking keenly round at the party, while the captain spoke to him in broken English which sounded somewhat like that of a weak old nurse prattling to a child, and in answer to which the black responded with the single word, \"Good.\"  \"There,\" said the captain, \"I have explained everything to him, gentlemen, and his word `Good' means that he will serve you faithfully, and show you plenty of game, to find which he will take you to the mineral forest where the trees are so high that it is nearly always twilight, and after that guide you on to the great city where the old people lived, and show you the mighty stones with which they built. That's all, gentlemen.  Metaphorically signed and sealed and witnessed by your humble servant, Frank Lawton, of Her Majesty's 200th Light Infantry.\"  \"Thank you,\" said the doctor.  \"I never knew there was so much in the one word good before.\"  Mark glanced at the black, who had been listening intently to the doctor, and catching the boy's movement he fixed him with his eyes so that they two were for some moments apparently trying to read each other's thoughts.  \"Well, you look all right,\" said the boy to himself, and his frank, open countenance expanded into a pleasant smile.  At this the haughty face before him changed suddenly, as if so much natural sunshine had flashed out, and stepping up to the boy he turned his spear upside down so that the point of the keen, leaf-like blade rested on the plain boarded floor of the captain's room, and bending forward he laid the back of his right hand upon Mark's breast.  \"Baas,\" he said, in a deep musical voice; and then moving slowly and with dignity he passed round to each, to repeat the action and the word, his eyes beaming upon everyone in turn, and then finishing off by uttering once more the one word, \"Good.\"  He then glanced at the captain and asked him some question, to which the captain nodded.  The next minute he had glided bare-footed and silent out of the room, while as the party watched they saw him march haughtily past the window and away across the barrack yard.  \"There, gentlemen, that's settled, then,\" said the captain.  \"Settled?\" said Sir James.  \"But I ought to give him what the country people call a fastening penny, ought I not?\"  \"Oh, no, nothing of the kind.\"  \"But about finding him when we want to start?  For I want to get away from here as soon as possible.\"  \"You will not have to find him,\" said the captain, laughing.  \"He will find you.  You may see him hanging about, or you may not.  But you may depend upon one thing, that from henceforth he will be like your shadow. Oh, but one word,\" the captain added.  \"Your men seem quiet, respectable fellows, but it might be advisable for you to say a few words to them about their treatment of your guide.  You know what I mean--about their looking upon him as a nigger.  I don't think you need speak to Buck Denham, the big bullock driver, nor to the Hottentot. There.\"  Sir James and the doctor offered plenty of words of thanks, at which the captain laughed.  \"My dear sirs,\" he said, \"not a word more.  Put yourselves in my place and suppose I came up country as you did.  Wouldn't you have been as pleased as I and our mess are to meet a brother Englishman so far away from home?  So not a word more but these: If ever I can serve you in any way, here I am, and you know my name.  There, boys, we will see you off when you start, and fire a salute, just as if we had had a visit from the Prince.\"    CHAPTER EIGHT.  MARK'S FIRST WATCH.  \"Now, look here,\" said Sir James, \"we have talked all this matter over quite enough, and it is high time that we started in a business-like way, so as to avoid all confusion.\"  \"Hear, hear,\" said the boys together, and Sir James went on.  \"First of all, I am nobody.\"  \"Oh!  Oh, I say, father!\" cried Mark laughing.  \"You hold your tongue, and don't interrupt.  I repeat that I am nobody, only a visitor who looks on and joins in the sport when I feel so disposed, and one whom you and your men must take care of.\"  \"But we must have a captain, sir, to give all orders.\"  \"Of course,\" said Sir James.  \"I constitute you captain; you, Mark, first lieutenant; Dean, second lieutenant.\"  \"But, Sir James--\"  \"Dr Robertson, I have planned all this, and I presume that I have a right to do as I please.\"  \"Certainly, sir,\" said the doctor.  \"And perhaps I may think it right to interfere when things are going on not to satisfy me.\"  \"Of course, sir;\" and the boys looked at one another.  \"Well,\" continued Sir James, \"we have arrived at this pitch, that we are quite independent of the inn.  I have paid everybody, and for the last two nights we have been practising camping out, and are going to sleep again to-night in our waggons as we intend to do during our campaign. You, Robertson, have reported to me that everything is properly packed, the waggons loaded with our stores.  You have trained our men to occupy their places; we make this waggon our tent or fort to sleep in or sleep under, according to the weather; in short, there is nothing to prevent our starting to-morrow morning.\"  \"So soon, father?\" said Mark.  \"So soon, sir!  Yes.  Haven't we been busy here for a fortnight, making our preparations?  And a very busy time it has been.  I consider that we have finished our stay here with bidding good-bye to the officers and thanking them.  You saw how I stopped back at the barracks this evening. Do you know what it was for, doctor?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"To tell Captain Lawton that I would rather not have any nonsense and procession or firing of farewell salute, and that I had made up my mind that we would start early to-morrow morning.\"  \"Then we really are to go to-morrow, father?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"But, uncle,\" protested Dean, \"there are several more things that might be useful and that I should like to get.\"  \"Of course there are, sir,\" said his uncle shortly, \"and so there would be if we stopped about here for another month.  Now, no more words.  You have got your marching orders, captain--I mean, doctor; and you will go round with your officers and see the blacks, the two drivers, and our own three men, so that there may be no excuse for their not being ready.\"  \"Exactly so, Sir James.  I am very glad that we have come to this climax.\"  \"So am I,\" said Sir James.  \"Eh?  What's that, Mark?\" for the boy was whispering to his cousin.  \"What's that you are saying?\"  \"Oh, I was only talking to Dean, father,\" said the boy, rather confusedly, and his face turned scarlet, lit up as it was by the swinging lantern beneath which he was seated.  \"Yes, sir; I saw you were; and you were protesting against my orders for what I presume you call this hurried start.\"  \"That I am sure I was not, father.  I was only joking to Dean.\"  \"And what was the joke, sir?  You, Dean, what did he say?\"  \"I don't like to tell you, uncle.\"  \"I insist that you tell me at once, sir,\" said Sir James angrily.  The boy gave a deprecating look at his cousin, and then went on hesitatingly, \"Mark said that it was comic--\"  \"Well, sir?  Go on.\"  Dean coughed to clear his voice.  \"He said it was comic that you had just made us all officers and then ended by taking it all out of the doctor's hands and playing captain yourself.\"  \"Humph!  Well,\" grunted Sir James, \"it does sound a little odd.  But this was the final instructions as I was making resignation.  But stop a minute.  I had just made the reservation that I should interfere if I thought proper.  Now I have done.  Give your final orders, captain; and then if it was my case I should say, lights out and let's all have a good rest till daylight to-morrow morning.  By the way, whose turn is it to take the watch to-night, doctor?\"  \"Yours, Sir James, and I relieve you two hours after midnight.\"  \"And to-morrow night?\"  \"Mark first watch, Dean the second.\"  \"Next night?\"  \"Not settled yet.\"  \"Good; and I think it was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23929"],["title","Revolution (#0)"],["body","By MACK REYNOLDS   _Before you wish for something--or  send agents to get it for you--make  very, very sure you really want it.  You might get it, you know...._  Illustrated by Gardner   Preface ... _For some forty years critics of the U.S.S.R. have been desiring, predicting, not to mention praying for, its collapse. For twenty of these years the author of this story has vaguely wondered what would replace the collapsed Soviet system. A return to Czarism? Oh, come now! Capitalism as we know it today in the advanced Western countries? It would seem difficult after almost half a century of State ownership and control of the means of production, distribution, communications, education, science. Then what? The question became increasingly interesting following recent visits not only to Moscow and Leningrad but also to various other capital cities of the Soviet complex. A controversial subject? Indeed it is. You can't get much more controversial than this in the world today. But this is science fiction, and here we go._         *       *       *       *       *  Paul Koslov nodded briefly once or twice as he made his way through the forest of desks. Behind him he caught snatches of tittering voices in whisper.  \"... That's him ... The Chief's hatchetman ... Know what they call him in Central America, a _pistola_, that means ... About Iraq ... And that time in Egypt ... Did you notice his eyes ... How would you like to date _him_ ... That's him. I was at a cocktail party once when he was there. Shivery ... cold-blooded--\"  Paul Koslov grinned inwardly. He hadn't asked for the reputation but it isn't everyone who is a legend before thirty-five. What was it _Newsweek_ had called him? \"The T. E. Lawrence of the Cold War.\" The trouble was it wasn't something you could turn off. It had its shortcomings when you found time for some personal life.  He reached the Chief's office, rapped with a knuckle and pushed his way through.  The Chief and a male secretary, who was taking dictation, looked up. The secretary frowned, evidently taken aback by the cavalier entrance, but the Chief said, \"Hello, Paul, come on in. Didn't expect you quite so soon.\" And to the secretary, \"Dickens, that's all.\"  When Dickens was gone the Chief scowled at his trouble-shooter. \"Paul, you're bad for discipline around here. Can't you even knock before you enter? How is Nicaragua?\"  Paul Koslov slumped into a leather easy-chair and scowled. \"I did knock. Most of it's in my report. Nicaragua is ... tranquil. It'll stay tranquil for a while, too. There isn't so much as a parlor pink--\"  \"And Lopez--?\"  Paul said slowly, \"Last time I saw Raul was in a swamp near Lake Managua. The very last time.\"  The Chief said hurriedly, \"Don't give me the details. I leave details up to you.\"  \"I know,\" Paul said flatly.  His superior drew a pound can of Sir Walter Raleigh across the desk, selected a briar from a pipe rack and while he was packing in tobacco said, \"Paul, do you know what day it is--and what year?\"  \"It's Tuesday. And 1965.\"  The bureau chief looked at his disk calendar. \"Um-m-m. Today the Seven Year Plan is completed.\"  Paul snorted.  The Chief said mildly, \"Successfully. For all practical purposes, the U.S.S.R. has surpassed us in gross national product.\"  [Illustration]  \"That's not the way I understand it.\"  \"Then you make the mistake of believing our propaganda. That's always a mistake, believing your own propaganda. Worse than believing the other man's.\"  \"Our steel capacity is a third again as much as theirs.\"  \"Yes, and currently, what with our readjustment--remember when they used to call them _recessions_, or even earlier, _depressions_--our steel industry is operating at less than sixty per cent of capacity. The Soviets always operate at one hundred per cent of capacity. They don't have to worry about whether or not they can sell it. If they produce more steel than they immediately need, they use it to build another steel mill.\"  The Chief shook his head. \"As long ago as 1958 they began passing us, product by product. Grain, butter, and timber production, jet aircraft, space flight, and coal--\"  Paul leaned forward impatiently. \"We put out more than three times as many cars, refrigerators, kitchen stoves, washing machines.\"  His superior said, \"That's the point. While we were putting the product of our steel mills into automobiles and automatic kitchen equipment, they did without these things and put their steel into more steel mills, more railroads, more factories. We leaned back and took it easy, sneered at their progress, talked a lot about our freedom and liberty to our allies and the neutrals and enjoyed our refrigerators and washing machines until they finally passed us.\"  \"You sound like a Tass broadcast from Moscow.\"  \"Um-m-m, I've been trying to,\" the Chief said. \"However, that's still roughly the situation. The fact that you and I personally, and a couple of hundred million Americans, prefer our cars and such to more steel mills, and prefer our personal freedoms and liberties is beside the point. We should have done less laughing seven years ago and more thinking about today. As things stand, give them a few more years at this pace and every neutral nation in the world is going to fall into their laps.\"  \"That's putting it strong, isn't it?\"  \"Strong?\" the Chief growled disgustedly. \"That's putting it mildly. Even some of our allies are beginning to waver. Eight years ago, India and China both set out to industrialize themselves. Today, China is the third industrial power of the world. Where's India, about twentieth? Ten years from now China will probably be first. I don't even allow myself to think where she'll be twenty-five years from now.\"  \"The Indians were a bunch of idealistic screwballs.\"  \"That's one of the favorite alibis, isn't it? Actually we, the West, let them down. They couldn't get underway. The Soviets backed China with everything they could toss in.\"  Paul crossed his legs and leaned back. \"It seems to me I've run into this discussion a few hundred times at cocktail parties.\"  The Chief pulled out a drawer and brought forth a king-size box of kitchen matches. He struck one with a thumbnail and peered through tobacco smoke at Paul Koslov as he lit up.  \"The point is that the system the Russkies used when they started their first five-year plan back in 1928, and the system used in China, works. If we, with our traditions of freedom and liberty, like it or not, it works. Every citizen of the country is thrown into the grinding mill to increase production. Everybody,\" the Chief grinned sourly, \"that is, except the party elite, who are running the whole thing. Everybody sacrifices for the sake of the progress of the whole country.\"  \"I know,\" Paul said. \"Give me enough time and I'll find out what this lecture is all about.\"  The Chief grunted at him. \"The Commies are still in power. If they remain in power and continue to develop the way they're going, we'll be through, completely through, in another few years. We'll be so far behind we'll be the world's laughing-stock--and everybody else will be on the Soviet bandwagon.\"  He seemed to switch subjects. \"Ever hear of Somerset Maugham?\"  \"Sure. I've read several of his novels.\"  \"I was thinking of Maugham the British Agent, rather than Maugham the novelist, but it's the same man.\"  \"British agent?\"  \"Um-m-m. He was sent to Petrograd in 1917 to prevent the Bolshevik revolution. The Germans had sent Lenin and Zinoviev up from Switzerland, where they'd been in exile, by a sealed train in hopes of starting a revolution in Czarist Russia. The point I'm leading to is that in one of his books, 'The Summing Up,' I believe, Maugham mentions in passing that had he got to Petrograd possibly six weeks earlier he thinks he could have done his job successfully.\"  Paul looked at him blankly. \"What could he have done?\"  The Chief shrugged. \"It was all out war. The British wanted to keep Russia in the allied ranks so as to divert as many German troops as possible from the Western front. The Germans wanted to eliminate the Russians. Maugham had carte blanche. Anything would have gone. Elements of the British fleet to fight the Bolsheviks, unlimited amounts of money for anything he saw fit from bribery to hiring assassins. What would have happened, for instance, if he could have had Lenin and Trotsky killed?\"  Paul said suddenly, \"What has all this got to do with me?\"  \"We're giving you the job this time.\"  \"Maugham's job?\" Paul didn't get it.  \"No, the other one. I don't know who the German was who engineered sending Lenin up to Petrograd, but that's the equivalent of your job.\" He seemed to go off on another bent. \"Did you read Djilas' 'The New Class' about a decade ago?\"  \"Most of it, as I recall. One of Tito's top men who turned against the Commies and did quite a job of exposing the so-called classless society.\"  \"That's right. I've always been surprised that so few people bothered to wonder how Djilas was able to smuggle his book out of one of Tito's strongest prisons and get it to publishers in the West.\"  \"Never thought of it,\" Paul agreed. \"How could he?\"  \"Because,\" the Chief said, knocking the ash from his pipe and replacing it in the rack, \"there was and is a very strong underground in all the Communist countries. Not only Yugoslavia, but the Soviet Union as well.\"  Paul stirred impatiently. \"Once again, what's all this got to do with me?\"  \"They're the ones you're going to work with. The anti-Soviet underground. You've got unlimited leeway. Unlimited support to the extent we can get it to you. Unlimited funds for whatever you find you need them for. Your job is to help the underground start a new Russian Revolution.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Paul Koslov, his face still bandaged following plastic surgery, spent a couple of hours in the Rube Goldberg department inspecting the latest gadgets of his trade.
