Come, let us examine it a little.\"  The youth and the trapper sat down and began to read the New Testament together, and to discuss its contents while supper was being prepared by their comrades.  After supper, they returned to it, and continued for several hours to bend earnestly over the Word of God.  In the wild remote part of the Rocky Mountains where their camp was made, neither trappers nor Indians were wont to ramble.  Even wild beasts were not so numerous there as elsewhere, so that it was deemed unnecessary to keep watch during the night.  But a war-party of Indians, out on an expedition against another tribe with whom they were at deadly feud, chanced to traverse the unfrequented pass at that time in order to make a short cut, and descend from an unusual quarter, and so take their enemies by surprise.  Towards midnight--when the rocky crags and beetling cliffs frowned like dark clouds over the spot where the travellers lay in deepest shade, with only a few red embers of the camp-fire to throw a faint lurid light on their slumbering forms--a tall savage emerged from the surrounding gloom, so stealthily, so noiselessly, and by such slow degrees, that he appeared more like a vision than a reality.  At first his painted visage only and the whites of his glittering eyes came into view as he raised his head above the surrounding brushwood and stretched his neck in order to obtain a better view of the camp.  Then slowly, inch by inch, almost with imperceptible motion, he crept forward until the whole of his gaunt form was revealed.  A scalping-knife gleamed in his right hand.  The camp was strewn with twigs, but these he removed one by one, carefully clearing each spot before he ventured to rest a knee upon it.  While the savage was thus engaged, Larry O'Hale, who was nearest to him, sighed deeply in his sleep and turned round.  The Indian at once sank so flat among the grass that scarcely any part of him was visible.  Big Ben, who slept very lightly, was awakened by Larry's motions, but having been aroused several times already by the same restless individual, he merely glanced at his sleeping comrade and shut his eyes again.  Well aware that in such a camp there must assuredly be at least one who was acquainted with the ways and dangers of the wilderness, and who, therefore, would be watchful, the savage lay perfectly still for more than a quarter of an hour; then he raised his head, and, by degrees, his body, until he kneeled once more by the side of the unconscious Irishman.  As he raised himself a small twig snapt under his weight. The face of the savage underwent a sudden spasmodic twitch, and his dark eye glanced sharply from one to another of the sleepers, while his fingers tightened on the hilt of his knife, but the rest of his body remained as rigid as a statue.  There was no evidence that the sound had been heard.  All remained as still and motionless as before, while the savage bent over the form of Larry O'Hale and gazed into his face.  But the snapping of that little twig had not been unobserved.  The trapper's eyes were open, and his senses wide awake on the instant. Yet, so tutored was he in the ways and warfare of the wilderness that no muscle of his huge frame moved, and his eyes were closed again so quickly that the glance of the savage, sharp though it was, failed to detect the fact of his having awakened.  The busy mind of Big Ben was active, however, while he lay there.  He saw that the savage was armed, but the knife was not yet raised to strike.  He saw, also, that this man was in his war paint, and knew that others were certainly around him, perhaps close to his own back, yet he did not dare to look round or to make the slightest movement.  His spirit was on fire with excitement, but his body lay motionless as if dead, while he rapidly considered what was to be done.  Presently the savage removed a corner of the blanket which covered Larry's broad chest and then raised his knife.  In another moment the trapper's rifle sent forth its deadly contents, and the Indian fell across the Irishman in the agonies of death.  Instantly the other sleepers sprang to their feet and seized their arms, but before they had time to use them they were surrounded by the whole band of savages, and, amid a hurricane of whoops and yells, were overpowered and pinioned.  Larry, with the fiery zeal of his countrymen, struggled like a madman, until one of the savages gave him a blow on the head with the flat of his tomahawk to quiet him, but the others, who knew that to struggle against overpowering odds would only make matters worse, at once surrendered.  \"It is all over with us now,\" exclaimed Will Osten, bitterly; \"if we had only had the chance of a good fight beforehand, it would have been some comfort!\"  \"When you have lived longer in the wilderness, lad,\" said Big Ben, \"you'll not give way to despair so easily.\"  These remarks were made as they sat on the grass while the Indians were engaged in catching and saddling the horses.  Soon after our travellers were assisted to mount, having their wrists tied behind their backs; and thus, with armed savages around them, they were led away prisoners--they knew not whither.    CHAPTER FOUR.  SHOWS THAT THE TABLES ARE TURNED, AND THAT GOOD AND BAD FORTUNE CONTINUE TO COMMINGLE.  One fortunate circumstance attending the capture of Wandering Will and his friends was that the Indians happened to follow the route which they had been pursuing, so that, whatever might be their ultimate fate, in the meantime they were advancing on their journey.  Big Ben took occasion to point this out to his comrades the next night, when, after a severe day's ride, they were allowed to sit down and eat a scanty meal surrounded by the Indian warriors.  No fire was lighted, for the savages knew they were now approaching their enemies' country. Their food, which consisted of dried buffalo meat, was eaten cold.  In order to enable the captives to feed themselves, their hands had been loosed and refastened in front instead of behind them, but this did not in any degree improve their chance of escape, for they were guarded with extreme vigilance.  \"You see, Mr Osten,\" said Big Ben, in a low tone, \"it's a piece of good luck that they've brought us this way, 'cause when we leave them we have nought to do but continue our journey.\"  \"Leave them!\" exclaimed Will in surprise.  \"How shall we manage to leave them?\"  \"By escapin',\" answered the trapper.  \"How it is to be gone about no man can tell, for man is only mortal an' don't know nothin' about the futur', but we'll find that out in good time.\"  \"I hope we may,\" returned Will sadly, as he gazed round on the stern faces of the savages, who ate their frugal meal in solemn silence; \"but it seems to me that our case is hopeless.\"  \"Faix, that's what meself thinks too,\" muttered Larry between his teeth, \"for these cords on me wrists would howld a small frigate, an' there's a black thief just forenint me, who has never tuk his eyes off me since we wos catched.  Ah, then, if I wor free I would make ye wink, ye ugly rascal.  But how comes it, Mister Trapper, that ye seem to be so sure o' escapin'?\"  \"I'm not sure, but I'm hopeful,\" replied Big Ben, with a smile.  \"Hopeful!\" repeated the other, \"it's disapinted ye'll be then.  Haven't ye often towld me that thim blackguards roast an' tear and torture prisoners nowadays just as bad as they ever did?\"  \"I have.\"  \"Well,--d'ye think them Redskins look as if they would let us off, seein' that we've shot wan of them already?\"  \"They don't.\"  \"Sure, then, yer hope stands on a bad foundation, an' the sooner we make up our minds to be skivered the better, for sartin am I that our doom is fixed.  Don't 'ee think so, Bunco?\"  The worthy appealed to was busily engaged in tearing to pieces and devouring a mass of dried buffalo meat, but he looked up, grinned, and nodded his head, as if to say that he believed Larry was right, and that in his opinion being roasted, torn, tortured, and skivered was rather a pleasant prospect than otherwise.  \"I have two reasons for bein' hopeful,\" observed Big Ben, after a short silence.  \"One is that I never got into a scrape in my life that I didn't get out of somehow or another, and the other reason is that I have observed signs on the trees that tell me the enemies, for whom the Redskins are seeking, are aware of their bein' on the trail and will give them a warm reception, perhaps sooner than they expect.\"  \"What signs do you refer to?\" asked Will Osten.  \"I see no sign of man having been here.\"  \"Perhaps not, and by good luck neither do the Injuns, for why, they can't read handwritin' as is not meant for 'em, but I know somethin' of the tribe they are after, an' one or two small marks on the trees tell me that they are not far distant.  No doubt they will attack the camp at night.\"  \"Ochone!\" groaned Larry, \"an' won't they brain an' scalp us wid the rest, an' our hands tied so that we can't do nothin' to help ourselves?\"  \"It is possible they may,\" returned the trapper; \"and if they do we can't help it, but let me warn you all, comrades, if we are attacked suddenly, let each man drop flat on the grass where he sits or stands. It is our _only chance_.\"  Poor Larry O'Hale was so overcome by the gloomy prospects before him that he dropped flat on his back then and there, and gave vent to a grievous sigh, after which he lay perfectly still, gazing up at the stars and thinking of \"Ould Ireland.\"  Being possessed of that happy temperament which can dismiss care at the shortest possible notice, and being also somewhat fatigued, he soon fell sound asleep.  His companions were about to follow his example when they heard a whizzing sound which induced them suddenly to sink down among the grass.  At the same moment an appalling shriek rudely broke the silence of the night, and two of the sentinels fell,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24086"],["title","Over the Rocky Mountains: Wandering Will in the Land of the Redskin (#7)"],["body","with arrows.  One of these lay dead where he fell, but the other sprang up and ran quickly, with staggering gait, after his comrades, who at the first alarm had leaped up and bounded into the nearest underwood, followed by a shower of arrows.  That these deadly messengers had not been sent after them in vain was evinced by the yells which succeeded their discharge.  A moment after, several dark and naked forms glided swiftly over the camp in pursuit.  One of these, pausing for one moment beside the dead Indian, seized him by the hair, passed his knife swiftly round the head so as to cut the skin all round, tore off the scalp, and stuck it under his girdle as he leaped on in pursuit.  Fortunately the prisoners were not observed.  Larry on being awakened by the yell had half raised himself, but, recollecting Big Ben's caution, dropped down again and remained perfectly still.  The attacking party had, of course, seen the sentinels fall and the rest of the warriors spring up and dart away, and naturally supposing, doubtless, that no one would be so foolish as to remain in the camp, they had passed on without discovering the prisoners.  When they had all passed, and the sounds of the fight were at a little distance, Big Ben leaped up and exclaimed:--  \"Comrades, look sharp, moments are golden.  They'll be back like a shot! Here, Larry, grip this in yer hand an' stick the point of it agin' that tree.\"  While he spoke in a cool, calm, almost jocular tone, the trapper acted with a degree of rapidity and vigour which showed that he thought the crisis a momentous one.  With his fettered hands he plucked the knife from the girdle of the dead Indian and gave it to Larry O'Hale, who at once seized it with his right hand, and, as directed, thrust the point against the stem of a neighbouring tree.  The trapper applied the stout cords that bound him to its edge, and, after a few seconds of energetic sawing, was free.  He instantly liberated his companions.  \"Now, lads,\" said he, \"down the stream and into the water as fast as you can.\"  Our hero and Larry, being utterly ignorant of the manners and habits of the people amongst whom they were thrown, obeyed with the docility of little children--showing themselves, thereby, to be real men!  Bunco, before darting away, seized an Indian gun, powder-horn, and shot-belt which had been left behind.  The attack had been so sudden and unexpected that many of the savages had found it as much as they could do to save themselves, leaving their arms behind them.  Of course, therefore, no one had thought of encumbering himself with the weapons of the prisoners.  Big Ben had thought of all this.  His wits had long been sharpened by practice.  He also knew that his white comrades would think only of escaping, and that there was no time to waste in telling them to look after their weapons.  Giving them, therefore, the general direction to rush down the banks of the stream and get into the water, he quietly but quickly seized his own piece and the guns of our hero and the Irishman, together with one of the large powder-horns and bullet-pouches of the war-party; also two smaller horns and pouches.  The securing of these cost him only a few seconds.  When Will Osten and Larry had run at full speed for several hundred yards down the stream which flowed near to the spot where the war-party had encamped, they stopped to take breath and receive further instructions.  The active trapper and Bunco were at their heels in a moment.  \"You forgot your guns,\" said the trapper, with a quiet chuckle, handing one to Larry and the other to Will.  \"What nixt?\" asked Larry, with a strange mixture of determination and uncertainty in his tone--the former being founded on his character, the latter on his ignorance.  \"Follow me.  Don't touch a twig or a blade o' grass on the banks, an' make as little noise as you can.  Running water leaves no trail.\"  Saying this, Big Ben stepped into the stream, which was a small shallow one, and flowed for nearly half a mile through a sort of meadow among the mountains.  Down this they all waded, carefully avoiding the banks, until they reached a narrow part where the stream tumbled over a precipice.  Here the trapper paused, and was about to give some directions to his comrades, when the sound of constrained breathing was heard near to him.  With a sudden demonstration of being about to fire, he turned and cocked his gun.  The sharp click was no sooner heard than three Indians burst out from beneath the bushes which overhung the water, and, springing up the bank, fled for their lives.  The trapper could not refrain from chuckling.  \"These,\" said he, \"are some of the rascals that caught us, making their escape by the same way that we are, but they don't know the ground as well as I do, and apparently have got perplexed at the top o' the fall. 'Tis well.  If the Redskins pursue, they will find the trail here as clear as a king's highway--see what a gap in the bushes they have made in their fright at the sound o' my lock!  Well, well, it's not many men that have pluck to keep quiet wi' that sound in their ears, and the muzzle pointed at their heads!  All we have to do now is to descend the precipice without disturbing the shrubs, and then--\"  A sound of horses galloping arrested him.  \"Hist! don't move!\"  At that moment about a dozen of the horses belonging to the war-party came thundering down along the banks of the stream.  They had broken loose, and were flying from the Indians who had attempted to catch them. On nearing the precipice, over which the stream leaped with noisy petulance, the snorting steeds drew up in alarm, as if undecided which way to turn.  \"A rare chance!\" cried the trapper.  \"Every man for himself--keep well up the hill, comrades? an' hem them in.\"  Saying this, he ran up the bank, the others followed, and, in a few minutes, they drove the steeds into a corner, from which they made a sudden rush, but as the long halter of each was trailing at its side, no difficulty was experienced in securing several of them as they passed by.  Next moment the fugitives were mounted and hastening away from the scene of their late adventure as fast as the rugged nature of the ground would permit.  It is not necessary that we should follow our adventurers in all their windings through the mighty fastnesses of the far West.  Suffice it to say that they made good their escape from the Indians, and that, for many days, they travelled through scenes so beautiful and varied that they have been spoken of by those who know them well as a perfect paradise.  Every description of lovely prospect met their admiring eyes in endless succession, but so wary were the lower animals, and so few the human inhabitants, that those realms were to all appearance absolute solitudes--created, apparently, for no end or purpose.  Nevertheless, there was enough there to tell the Christian philosopher that God had made the deserts for the enjoyment of His creatures, for, although not always visible or audible, myriads of living beings were there--from the huge buffalo and grizzly bear to the sand-fly and mosquito--which rejoiced in the green pastures and luxuriated beside the sweet waters of the land.  One afternoon the travellers came upon a small plain, which reminded them somewhat of the prairies.  The first glance showed them that it was crowded with buffalos.  Instantly a sensation of wild excitement passed through their frames, and showed itself in various ways.  The Irishman uttered a shout of delight, and suggested an immediate onslaught; but it is due to his wisdom to say that the shout was a subdued one, and the suggestion was humbly made.  Our hero became restless and flushed, while the eyes of Bunco and Big Ben alone served as outlets to the fire which burned within.  The plain was surrounded by low wooded hills, and had a lake on one side winding with many an inlet amongst the hills and into the plain, while here and there a tiny promontory, richly clothed with pines and aspens, stretched out into the water.  Among the bluffs, or wooded islets of the plain, were to be seen several herds of bulls feeding about a mile off, and other bands in the distance.  \"Tighten your girths,\" said Big Ben, dismounting.  The horse which the trapper had secured, though not his own, was almost equal to it in point of size and strength.  He eyed it with evident satisfaction as he tightened the girth, saying that if it wasn't for the difference in colour he would have thought it was the old one.  The others having also seen to their harness mounted, and the cavalcade advanced at a walking pace into the plain.  When they arrived within quarter of a mile of the largest band, the buffalo began to move slowly off.  The scattered groups, seeing the horsemen, drew together, and, soon forming a large band, went off at a slow lumbering canter.  The trapper, breaking into a trot, led the way, taking care to increase his speed gently, so as to gain on them insensibly, until he had got within about two hundred yards of the nearest, when he went off at full speed with a wild hurrah!  The others followed, brandishing their arms and cheering in the excitement of the moment, while they hammered the horses' ribs violently with their unarmed heels.  As they closed with them, the herd broke into separate bands, and each man, selecting the animal nearest to him, pursued it with reckless indifference to badger-holes.  Fortunately for the riders, the horses, being accustomed to the work, knew the danger, and kept a sharp look-out on their own account.  Soon several shots told that the slaughter had begun, but each hunter was quickly separated from the other, and none knew aught of the success of the rest until the pun was over.  There was something particularly ludicrous in the appearance of the bulls as they lumbered along in their heavy gallop; their small hindquarters, covered with short hair, being absurdly disproportioned to"]]]
