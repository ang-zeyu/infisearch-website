Not far inland, but a little to the south, is the beautiful Forest of Arden, where men and maids dwell together in amity, and where clowns wander, making love to shepherdesses. Some of these same pestilent pedants have pretended to believe that this forest of Arden was situated in France, which is absurd, as there are no serpents and no lions in France, while we have the best of evidence as to the existence of both in Arden--you know that, don't you?\"  I admitted that a green and gilded snake and a lioness with udders all drawn dry were known to have been seen there both on the same day. I ventured to suggest further that possibly this Forest of Arden was the Wandering Wood where Una met her lion.  \"Of course,\" was the curt response; \"everybody knows that Arden is a most beautiful region; even the toads there have precious jewels in their heads. And if you range the forest freely you may chance to find also the White Doe of Rylstone and the goat with the gilded horns that told fortunes in Paris long ago by tapping with his hoof on a tambourine.\"  \"These, then, are the Happy Hunting-Grounds?\" I suggested with a light laugh.  \"Who would chase a tame goat?\" he retorted with ill-concealed contempt for my ill-advised remark.  I thought it best to keep silence; and after a minute or two he resumed the conversation, like one who is glad of a good listener.  \"In the outskirts of the Forest of Arden,\" he began again, \"stands the Abbey of Thelema--the only abbey which is bounded by no wall and in which there is no clock at all nor any dial. And what need is there of knowing the time when one has for companions only comely and well-conditioned men and fair women of sweet disposition? And the motto of the Abbey of Thelema is _Fais ce que voudra_--Do what you will; and many of those who dwell in the Forest of Arden will tell you that they have taken this also for their device, and that if you live under the greenwood tree you may spend your life--as you like it.\"  I acknowledged that this claim was probably well founded, since I recalled a song of the foresters in which they declared themselves without an enemy but winter and rough weather.  \"Yes,\" he went on, \"they are fond of singing in the Forest of Arden, and they sing good songs. And so they do in the fair land beyond where I have never been, and which I can never hope to go to see for myself, if all that they report be true--and yet what would I not give to see it and to die there.\"  And as he said this sadly, his voice sank into a sigh.  \"And where does the road through the forest lead, that you so much wish to set forth upon it?\" I asked.  \"That's the way to Arcady,\" he said--\"to Arcady where all the leaves are merry. I may not go there, though I long for it. Those who attain to its borders never come back again--and why should they leave it? Yet there are tales told, and I have heard that this Arcady is the veritable El Dorado, and that in it is the true Fountain of Youth, gushing forth unfailingly for the refreshment of all who may reach it. But no one may find the entrance who cannot see it by the light that never was on land or sea.\"  \"It must be a favored region,\" I remarked.  \"Of a truth it is,\" he answered; \"and on the way there is the orchard where grow the golden apples of Hesperides, and the dragon is dead now that used to guard them, and so any one may help himself to the beautiful fruit. And by the side of the orchard flows the river Lethe, of which it is not well for man to drink, though many men would taste it gladly.\" And again he sighed.  I knew not what to say, and so waited for him to speak once more.  \"That promontory there on the weather bow,\" he began again after a few moments' silence, \"that is Barataria, which was long supposed to be an island by its former governor, Don Sancho Panza, but which is now known by all to be connected with the mainland. Pleasant pastures slope down to the water, and if we were closer in shore you might chance to see Rozinante, the famous charger of Don Quixote de la Mancha, grazing amicably with the horse that brought the good news from Ghent to Aix.\"  \"I wish I could see them!\" I cried, enthusiastically; \"but there is another horse I would rather behold than any--the winged steed Pegasus.\"  Before responding, my guide raised his hand and shaded his eyes and scanned the horizon.  \"No,\" he said at last. \"I cannot descry any this afternoon. Sometimes in these latitudes I have seen a dozen hippogriffs circling about the ship, and I should like to have shown them to you. Perhaps they are all in the paddock at the stock-farm, where Apollo is now mating them with night-mares in the hope of improving the breed from which he selects the coursers that draw the chariot of the sun. They say that the experiment would have more chance of success if it were easier to find the night-mares' nests.\"  \"It was not a hippogriff I desired to see especially,\" I returned when he paused, \"although that would be interesting, no doubt. It was the renowned Pegasus himself.\"  \"Pegasus is much like the other hippogriffs,\" he retorted, \"although perhaps he has a little better record than any of them. But they say he has not won a single aërial handicap since that American professor of yours harnessed him to a one-hoss shay. That seemed to break his spirit, somehow; and I'm told he would shy now even at a broomstick train.\"  \"Even if he is out of condition,\" I declared, \"Pegasus is still the steed I desire to see above all.\"  \"I haven't set eyes on him for weeks,\" was the answer, \"so he is probably moulting; this is the time of year. He has a roomy boxstall in the new Augean stable at the foot of Mount Parnassus. You know they have turned the spring of Castaly so that it flows through the stable-yard now, and so it is easy enough to keep the place clean.\"  \"If I may not see Pegasus,\" I asked, \"is there any chance of my being taken to the Castle of the Sleeping Beauty?\"  \"I have never seen it myself,\" he replied, \"and so I cannot show it to you. Rarely indeed may I leave the deck of my ship to go ashore; and this castle that you ask about is very far inland. I am told that it is in a country which the French travellers call _La Scribie_, a curious land, wherein the scene is laid of many a play, because its laws and its customs are exactly what every playwright has need of; but no poet has visited it for many years. Yet the Grand Duchess of Gerolstein, whose domains lie partly within the boundaries of Scribia, is still a subscriber to the _Gazette de Hollande_--the only newspaper I take himself, by the way.\"  This last remark of the Captain's explained how it was that he had been able to keep up with the news of the day, despite his constant wanderings over the waste of waters; and what more natural in fact than that the Flying Dutchman should be a regular reader of the _Holland Gazette_?  Vanderdecken went forward into the prow of the vessel, calling to me to follow.  \"Do you see those peaks afar in the distance?\" he asked, pointing over the starboard bow.  I could just make out a saw-like outline in the direction indicated.  \"Those are the Delectable Mountains,\" he informed me; \"and down on a hollow between the two ranges is the Happy Valley.\"  \"Where Rasselas lived?\"  \"Yes,\" he replied, \"and beyond the Delectable Mountains, on the far slope, lies Prester John's Kingdom, and there dwell anthropophagi, and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders. At least, so they say. For my part, I have never seen any such. And I have now no desire to go to Prester John's Kingdom, since I have been told that he has lately married Pope Joan. Do you see that grove of trees there at the base of the mountains?\"  I answered that I thought I could distinguish weirdly contorted branches and strangely shivering foliage.  \"That is the deadly upas-tree,\" he explained, \"and it is as much as a man's life is worth to lie down in the shade of its twisted limbs. I slept there, on that point where the trees are the thickest, for a fortnight a century or so ago--but all I had for my pains was a headache. Still I should not advise you to adventure yourself under the shadow of those melancholy boughs.\"  I confess at once that I was little prompted to a visit so dangerous and so profitless.  \"Profitless?\" he repeated. \"As to that I am not so certain, for if you have a mind to see the rarest animals in the world, you could there sate your curiosity. On the shore, between the foot-hills and the grove of upas, is a park of wild beasts, the like of which no man has looked upon elsewhere. Even from the deck of this ship I have seen more than once a drove of unicorns, or a herd of centaurs, come down to the water to drink; and sometimes I have caught a pleasant glimpse of satyrs and fauns dancing in the sunlight. And once indeed--I shall never forget that extraordinary spectacle--as I sped past with every sail set and a ten-knot breeze astern, I saw the phoenix blaze up in its new birth, while the little salamanders frisked in the intense flame.\"  \"The phoenix?\" I cried. \"You have seen the phoenix?\"  \"In just this latitude,\" he answered, \"but it was about nine o'clock in the evening and I remember that the new moon was setting behind the mountains when I happened to come on deck.\"  \"And what was the phoenix like?\" I asked.  \"Really,\" he replied, \"the bird was almost as Herodotus described her, of the make and size of the eagle, with a plumage partly red and partly golden. If we go by the point by noon, perhaps you may see her for yourself.\"  \"Is she there still?\" I asked, in wonder.  \"Why not?\" he returned. \"All the game of this sort is carefully preserved and the law is off on phoenixes only once in a century. Why, if it were not for the keepers, there soon would not be a single griffin or dragon left, not a single"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23678"],["title","Tales of Fantasy and Fact (#2)"],["body",", not a single chimæra. Even as it is, I am told they do not breed as freely now as when they could roam the whole world in safety. That is why the game laws are so rigorous. Indeed, I am informed and believe that it is not permitted to kill the were-wolves even when their howling, as they run at large at night, prevents all sleep. It is true, of course, that very few people care to remain in such a neighborhood.\"  \"I should think not,\" I agreed. \"And what manner of people are they who dare to live here?\"  \"Along the shore there are a few harpies,\" he answered; \"and now and then I have seen a mermaid on the rocks combing her hair with a golden comb as she sang to herself.\"  \"Harpies?\" I repeated, in disgust. \"Why not the sea-serpent also?\"  \"There was a sea-serpent which lived for years in that cove yonder,\" said the Captain, pointing to a pleasant bay on the starboard, \"but I have not seen it lately. Unless I am in error, it had a pitched battle hereabouts with a kraken. I don't remember who got the better of the fight--but I haven't seen the snake since.\"  As I scanned the surface of the water to see if I might not detect some trace of one or another of these marvellous beasts of the sea, I remarked a bank of fog lying across our course.  \"And what is this that we are coming to?\" I inquired.  \"That?\" Captain Vanderdecken responded, indicating the misty outline straight before us. \"That is Altruria--at least it is so down in the charts, but I have never set eyes on it actually. It belongs to Utopia, you know; and they say that, although it is now on the level of the earth, it used once to be a flying island--the same which was formerly known as Laputa, and which was first visited and described by Captain Lemuel Gulliver about the year 1727, or a little earlier.\"  \"So that is Altruria,\" I said, trying in vain to see it more clearly. \"There was an Altrurian in New York not long ago, but I had no chance of speech with him.\"  \"They are pleasant folk, those Altrurians,\" said the Captain, \"although rather given to boasting. And they have really little enough to brag about, after all. Their climate is execrable--I find it ever windy hereabouts, and when I get in sight of that bank of fog, I always look out for squalls. I don't know just what the population is now, but I doubt if it is growing. You see, people talk about moving there to live, but they are rarely in a hurry to do it, I notice. Nor are the manufactures of the Altrurians as many as they were said to be. Their chief export now is the famous Procrustean bed; although the old house of Damocles & Co. still does a good business in swords. Their tonnage is not what it used to be, and I'm told that they are issuing a good deal of paper money now to try and keep the balance of trade in their favor.\"  \"Are there not many poets among the inhabitants of Altruria?\" I asked.  \"They are all poets and romancers of one kind or another,\" declared the Captain. \"Come below again into the cabin, and I will show you some of their books.\"  The sky was now overcast and there was a chill wind blowing, so I was not at all loath to leave the deck, and to follow Vanderdecken down the steps into the cabin.  He took a thin volume from the table. \"This,\" he said, \"is one of their books--'News from Nowhere,' it is called.\"  He extended it towards me, and I held out my hand for it, but it slipped through my fingers. I started forward in a vain effort to seize it.  As I did so, the walls and the floor of the cabin seemed to melt away and to dissolve in air, and beyond them and taking their place were the walls and floor of my own house. Then suddenly the clock on the mantelpiece struck five, and I heard a bob-tail car rattling and clattering past the door on its way across town to Union Square, and thence to Greenwich Village, and so on down to the Hoboken Ferry.  Then I found myself on my own sofa, bending forward to pick up the volume of Cyrano de Bergerac, which lay on the carpet at my feet. I sat up erect and collected my thoughts as best I could after so strange a journey. And I wondered why it was that no one had ever prepared a primer of imaginary geography, giving to airy nothings a local habitation and a name, and accompanying it with an atlas of maps in the manner of the _Carte du Pays de Tendre_.  (1894.)     THE KINETOSCOPE OF TIME   As the twelfth stroke of the bell in the tower at the corner tolled forth slowly, the midnight wind blew chill down the deserted avenue, and swept it clear of all belated wayfarers. The bare trees in the thin strip of park clashed their lifeless branches; the river far below slipped along silently. There was no moon, and the stars were shrouded. It was a black night. Yet far in the distance there was a gleam of cheerful light which lured me on and on. I could not have said why it was that I had ventured forth at that hour on such a night. It seemed to me as though the yellow glimmer I beheld afar off was the goal of my excursion. Something within whispered to me then that I need go no farther when once I had come to the spot whence the soft glare proceeded.  The pall of darkness was so dense that I could not see the sparse houses I chanced to pass, nor did I know where I was any more. I urged forward blindly, walking towards the light, which was all that broke the blackness before me; its faint illumination seemed to me somehow to be kindly, inviting, irresistible. At last I came to a halt in front of a building I had never before seen, although I thought myself well acquainted with that part of the city. It was a circular edifice, or so it seemed to me then; and I judged that it had but a single story, or two, at the most. The door stood open to the street; and it was from this that the light was cast. So dim was this illumination now I had come to it that I marvelled I could have seen it at all afar off as I was when first I caught sight of it.  While I stood at the portal of the unsuspected edifice, peering doubtfully within, wondering to what end I had been led thither, and hesitating as to my next step, I felt again the impulse to go forward. At that moment tiny darts of fire, as it were, glowed at the end of the hall that opened before me, and they ran together rapidly and joined in liquid lines and then faded as suddenly as they had come--but not too soon for me to read the simple legend they had written in the air--an invitation to me, so I interpreted it, to go forward again, to enter the building, and to see for myself why I had been enticed there.  Without hesitation I obeyed. I walked through the doorway, and I became conscious that the door had closed behind me as I pressed forward. The passage was narrow and but faintly lighted; it bent to the right with a circular sweep as though it skirted the inner circumference of the building; still curving, it sank by a gentle gradient; and then it rose again and turned almost at right angles. Pushing ahead resolutely, although in not a little doubt as to the meaning of my adventure, I thrust aside a heavy curtain, soft to the hand. Then I found myself just inside a large circular hall. Letting the hangings fall behind me, I took three or four irresolute paces which brought me almost to the centre of the room. I saw that the walls were continuously draped with the heavy folds of the same soft velvet, so that I could not even guess where it was I had entered. The rotunda was bare of all furniture; there was no table in it, no chair, no sofa; nor was anything hanging from the ceiling or against the curtained walls. All that the room contained was a set of four curiously shaped narrow stands, placed over against one another at the corners of what might be a square drawn within the circle of the hall. These narrow stands were close to the curtains; they were perhaps a foot wide, each of them, or it might be a little more: they were twice or three times as long as they were wide; and they reached a height of possibly three or four feet.  Going towards one of these stands to examine it more curiously, I discovered that there were two projections from the top, resembling eye-pieces, as though inviting the beholder to gaze into the inside of the stand. Then I thought I heard a faint metallic click above my head. Raising my eyes swiftly, I read a few words written, as it were, against the dark velvet of the heavy curtains in dots of flame that flowed one into the other and melted away in a moment. When this mysterious legend had faded absolutely, I could not recall the words I had read in the fitful and flitting letters of fire, and yet I retained the meaning of the message; and I understood that if I chose to peer through the eye-pieces I should see a succession of strange dances.  To gaze upon dancing was not what I had gone forth to do, but I saw no reason why I should not do so, as I was thus strangely bidden. I lowered my head until my eyes were close to the two openings at the top of the stand. I looked into blackness at first, and yet I thought that I could detect a mystic commotion of the invisible particles at which I was staring. I made no doubt that, if I waited, in due season the promise would be fulfilled. After a period of expectancy which I could not measure, infinitesimal sparks darted hither and thither, and there was a slight crackling sound. I concentrated my attention on what I was about to see; and in a moment more I was rewarded.  The darkness took shape and robed itself in color; and there arose out of it a spacious banquet-hall, where many guests sat at supper. I could not make out whether they were Romans or Orientals; the structure itself had a Latin solidity, but the decorations were Eastern in their glowing gorgeousness. The hall was illumined by hanging lamps, by the light of which I tried to decide whether the ruler who sat in the seat of honor was a Roman or an Oriental. The beautiful woman beside him struck me as Eastern beyond all question. While I gazed intently he "]]]
