There only seems to be one in each cubicle, but as I'm the visitor----\"  \"Take care!\" screamed Maisie. \"My clean blouses!\"  \"What am I doing? I declare, I never saw them. There, I'll nurse them for you while I eat this delicious-looking piece of pink rock.\"  The new girl was so utterly different from anybody else who had ever come to St. Chad's that the others waited with curiosity to hear what she would say next.  \"Well?\" she enquired coolly at last. \"I suppose you're thinking me over. I should like to know your opinion of me. They tell me at home that my nose turns up, and my tongue is too long. But I didn't turn up my nose at the Edinburgh rock, did I?--and as for my tongue, it fits my mouth, as a general rule, though it runs away sometimes.\"  \"When did you come?\"  \"What class are you in?\"  \"Have you seen Miss Cavendish yet?\"  \"How old are you?\"  \"Have you been to school before?\"  \"Do you know anyone here?\"  \"Why did you come to St. Chad's?\"  The questions were fired off all together from seven pairs of lips.  \"One at a time, please!\" returned Honor. \"I'm older than I look, and younger than I seem. You mayn't believe me, yet I assure you I've only had three birthdays.\"  \"Rubbish!\" said Chatty Burns.  \"It's a fact, all the same.\"  \"But how could that be?\" demanded Pauline Reynolds incredulously.  \"Because I was born on the twenty-ninth of February, and I can't have a birthday except in a leap year. That accounts for anything odd there is about me; so if you find me queer, you must just say: 'She's a twenty-ninth of February girl', and make excuses for me. As for the other questions, I've never been to school before; I've seen Miss Cavendish, but I haven't heard yet what class I'm to be in; five minutes ago I didn't know anybody here, but now I know--how many are there of you?--one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine!\"  \"Have you unpacked yet?\" asked Maisie, returning to her box, which Lettice had been steadily emptying.  \"Only about half.\"  \"I think we had better come and help you, then.\"  \"Better finish our own first!\" grunted Lettice, for which remark she was promptly snubbed by her elder sister.  \"Miss Maitland will be up at eight o'clock to look at our drawers,\" said Chatty Burns. \"She'll expect you to have everything put away, and your coats and dresses hung in the wardrobe.\"  \"We have to be so fearfully tidy here!\" sighed Adeline Vaughan. \"A warden comes round each morning, and woe betide you if you leave hairs in your brush, or have forgotten to fold your nightdress!\"  \"It's just as bad at St. Hilary's,\" said Madge.  \"And worse at St. Bride's,\" added Ruth Latimer.  \"My father wanted me to be at the School House,\" said Honor, \"but Miss Cavendish wrote that it was full, so I was entered at St. Chad's instead.\"  \"Yes, you generally need to have your name down for two years before you can get a vacancy at the School House,\" said Dorothy Arkwright. \"It's the popular favourite with parents, because Miss Cavendish herself is the Head; but really, St. Chad's is far nicer. We all stand up for our own house, and I know you'll like it.\"  \"There's the tea-bell! Come along! we must go at once,\" interrupted Chatty Burns.  \"Won't they wait for us?\" enquired Honor, beginning to wash her hands with much deliberation.  \"Wait! She asks if they'll wait!\" exclaimed Adeline Vaughan.  \"One can see you've never been to school before!\" commented Maisie Talbot. \"No, you certainly haven't time to comb your hair now. You had better follow the rest of us as fast as you can.\"  St. Chad's could accommodate forty pupils, and Honor found a place assigned to her in the dining-hall near the end of a long table, which looked very attractive with its clean white cloth, its pretty china, and its vases of flowers in the middle. She had a good view of her schoolfellows, more than half of whom seemed of about the same age as herself, though there were tall girls, with their hair already put up, and a few younger ones who had apparently only just entered their teens. Grace was sung, and then the urns began to fill an almost ceaseless stream of cups, while plates of bread and butter circulated with much rapidity.  \"We're late to-day,\" explained Honor's neighbour, \"because the train from the North does not get in until five. Our usual tea-time is four o'clock, after games; then we have supper at half-past seven, when we've finished evening preparation. Did you bring any jam? Your hamper will be unpacked to-morrow, and the pots labelled with your name. I expect you'll find one opposite your plate at breakfast. Jam and marmalade are the only things we're allowed, except plain cakes.\"  Tea on the first afternoon was generally an exciting occasion at St. Chad's. There were so many greetings between old friends, so much news and such various topics to be discussed, that conversation, in a sufficiently subdued undertone, went on very briskly. The girls had enjoyed their Easter holidays, but most of them seemed pleased to return to school, for the summer term was always the favourite at Chessington College.  \"Have you heard who's in the Eleven?\" began Madge Summers. \"They've actually put in Grace Shaw, and she bowls abominably. I think it's rank favouritism on Miss Young's part. She always gives St. Hilary's a turn when she can.\"  \"She was a Hilaryite herself,\" returned Adeline Vaughan. \"That's the worst of having a games mistress who's been educated at the school; she's sure to show partiality for her old house.\"  \"And yet in one way it's better, because she understands all our customs and private rules. It would be almost impossible to explain everything to a new-comer.\"  \"What about the house team?\" asked Ruth Latimer. \"Is anything fixed?\"  \"Not yet. There's to be a practice to-morrow, and it will go by our scores.\"  \"I shall stick to tennis,\" declared Pauline Reynolds. \"One gets a fair chance there, at any rate, and we must keep up the credit of St. Chad's in the courts. I don't know whether we've any chance of winning the shield. I wish we could get a real champion!\"  \"You should see Flossie Taylor play!\" burst out Edith and Claudia Hammond-Smith, who were anxious to bring their cousin forward, and to ensure her popularity among the other girls.  \"I've not heard that she made any record at St. Bride's,\" remarked Dorothy Arkwright, who resented Flossie's removal to St. Chad's.  \"She hasn't had an opportunity. She only came to school last Christmas, and it wasn't the tennis season. Wait till you see her serve!\"  \"Miss Young will have to be judge, not I,\" replied Dorothy coldly.  \"Flossie is in your bedroom, Dorothy,\" announced Claudia. \"She has the cubicle near the fireplace.\"  \"If you're sleeping in the bed next to mine,\" said Flossie, eyeing Dorothy across the table with a rather patronizing air, \"I sincerely hope you don't snore.\"  \"Of course not!\" responded Dorothy, in some indignation.  \"At St. Bride's,\" continued Flossie, \"one of my room-mates snored atrociously. I used to have to get up and shake her, and pull the pillow from under her head, before I could go to sleep.\"  \"You'd better not try that on with me!\"  \"I would, in a minute, if you kept me awake.\"  \"It is a shame she's not in our room,\" interposed Edith. \"We've asked Miss Maitland to let her change with Geraldine Saunders, and I think perhaps she may. We want Flossie all to ourselves; I do hope she'll let us!\"  \"So do I!\" retorted Dorothy feelingly. \"The Hammond-Smiths are welcome to their cousin, so far as I'm concerned,\" she whispered to Chatty Burns; \"I don't like her. She's trying to show off. Edith and Claudia are making far too much fuss over her.\"  \"They always gush,\" commented Chatty. \"Still, I dare say Flossie will need taking down a little.\"  \"It would do her all the good in the world,\" replied Dorothy. Then, turning to the Hammond-Smiths, she remarked aloud: \"There's a new girl here who may be just as good as your cousin, for anything we know. Honor Fitzgerald, do you play tennis?\"  \"I can play, but how you'll like it is another story,\" answered Honor. \"We two,\" nodding at Flossie, \"had better try a set by ourselves, and then you can choose the winner.\"  \"I'm sure I don't care about it, thank you.\" Flossie's tone was supercilious.  \"All right! We don't force ourselves where we're not wanted in my part of the world.\"  \"Is that Ireland? Then I suppose your name is Biddy?\"  \"Certainly not!\"  \"I thought all Irish girls were called Biddy; are you sure you're not?\"  \"My name is Honor Fitzgerald.\"  \"Really! I'm astonished it isn't Mulligan, or O'Grady.\"  The Hammond-Smiths giggled, and poked Effie and Blanche Lawson.  \"Isn't Flossie funny?\" they whispered delightedly.  \"I think she's very rude,\" observed Dorothy Arkwright. \"I call that an extremely cheap form of wit.\"  \"Irish names are often rather peculiar,\" drawled Claudia Hammond-Smith.  \"They're quite as good as English ones, and sometimes a great deal more ancient and aristocratic,\" returned Honor.  \"One for Claudia, and for Flossie Taylor too!\" said Dorothy to Chatty Burns.  \"Paddy, for instance,\" interposed Flossie, who saw that the Lawsons were listening, as well as her cousins. \"St. Patrick and pigs always go together, in my mind. I suppose you keep a pig in Ireland?\"  \"Don't answer her!\" whispered Honor's neighbour. \"They're only teasing you because you're new. They want to see how much you'll stand.\"  But poor Honor was unaccustomed as yet to schoolgirl banter, and could not abstain from replying:  \"Does it matter whether we do or not?\"  She spoke quietly, but there was a gleam in her eye, as if her temper were rising.  \"Not in the least! I only thought all Irish people cultivated pigs.\"  \"It's no worse than keeping a cat, or a dog.\"  \"My dear Paddy, of course not! Still, I shouldn't care to have the creatures in the drawing-room. Take a little more bread and butter. I'm sorry we've no potatoes to offer you.\"  The Hammond-Smiths and the Lawsons tittered, and Dorothy Arkwright was about to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24025"],["title","The New Girl at St. Chad's: A Story of School Life (#2)"],["body","her frank opinion of their behaviour when Honor's pent-up wrath exploded.  \"We don't keep pigs in the drawing-room,\" she exclaimed. \"There's a saying that it takes nine tailors to make a man, so if your name is Taylor you can only be the ninth part of a lady!\" Then, realizing that her upraised voice had drawn upon her the attention, not only of all the girls, but also of Miss Maitland, she flushed crimson, scraped back her chair, and fled precipitately from the room.  Miss Maitland looked surprised. It was an unheard-of thing for any girl to leave the tea-table without permission. Such a breach of school decorum had surely never been committed before at St. Chad's! There was a very complete code of etiquette observed at the house, and to break one of the laws of politeness was considered an unpardonable offence.  \"She's made a bad beginning,\" whispered Ruth Latimer to Maisie Talbot. \"It's most unfortunate. It was really the fault of Flossie Taylor and the Hammond-Smiths. They needn't have teased her so.\"  \"Still, it was silly of her to lose her temper,\" replied Maisie. \"She stalked out of the room like a queen of tragedy. Miss Maitland can't bear girls who give way to their impulses; she despises what she calls 'early Victorian hysterics', and I quite agree with her.\"  \"Yes, we must learn to be stoics here,\" said Ruth; \"and as for teasing, the wisest thing is to take no notice of it.\"  A monitress had been dispatched to fetch Honor back, but in a short time she returned alone, and reported that she could not find her. Miss Maitland made no comment, and as the meal was now over she gave the signal of dismissal. Most of the girls went to the recreation room, but Maisie Talbot, who had not yet quite concluded her unpacking, ran straight upstairs. Noticing something move behind a curtain in the corner of the bedroom, she pulled it aside. There was Honor, sitting in a queer little heap on the floor, and rubbing her eyes in a very suggestive manner. She jumped up in a moment, however, and pretended that she was only arranging her boots.  \"I'd finished tea,\" she remarked airily, \"so I thought I might as well empty my box, and put my dresses away in my wardrobe.\"  \"You'll have to ask Miss Maitland's leave next time, before you march out of the room, or you'll get into trouble,\" said Maisie. \"If it weren't your first evening, you'd be expected to make a public apology. Of course, Flossie Taylor and the Hammond-Smiths were aggravating, but you should just have laughed at them, and then they'd have stopped. We don't behave like kindergarten children here.\"  Maisie spoke scathingly. She was a girl who had scant sympathy with what she called \"babyishness\", and disliked any exhibition of feeling. And, after all, she only voiced the general opinion of the school, which, by an unwritten law, had established a calm imperturbation as the height of good breeding.  \"I don't care in the least what any of you think!\" retorted Honor, and she hung up her skirt with such a jerk that she broke the loop.  Yet, although she spoke lightly, she evidently did care. She was very quiet indeed all the rest of the evening, and hardly spoke at recreation. Chatty Burns sat down next to her and tried to begin a conversation, but Honor answered so briefly that she very soon gave up the effort in despair, and moved away; while the other girls were so interested in their own affairs that they did not trouble to remember their new schoolfellow. At nine o'clock prayers were read, and everybody went upstairs to bed.  When the lights were out, and the room was in perfect silence, a strange, suppressed noise issued from Honor's corner. It might, of course, have been snoring; and Honor explained elaborately next morning that Irish people often have a peculiar way of breathing in their sleep--an affection from which she sometimes suffered herself.  \"All the same, I don't quite believe her,\" confided Pauline Reynolds, who occupied the next cubicle, to Lettice Talbot, a more sympathetic character than her sister Maisie. \"I know what it is to feel home-sick, and to smother one's nose in the pillow! If that wasn't sobbing, it was as like it as anything I've ever heard in my life.\"     CHAPTER II  Honor's Home   For a full understanding of Honor Fitzgerald we must go back a few weeks, and see her in that Irish home which was so far away and so utterly different from Chessington College. Kilmore Castle was a great, rambling, old-fashioned country house, built beside an inland creek of the sea, and sheltered by a range of hills from the wild winds of Kerry. To Honor that was the dearest and most beautiful spot in the world. She loved every inch of it--the silvery strips of water that led between bold, rocky headlands out to the broad Atlantic; the tall mountain peaks that showed so rugged an outline against the sky; the brown, peat-stained river that came brawling down from the uplands, and poured itself noisily into the creek; the wide, lonely moors, with their stretches of brilliant green grass and dark, treacherous bog pools; and the craggy cliffs that made a barrier against the ever-dashing waves, and round which thousands of sea birds flew, with harsh cries and whir of white wings.  Its situation at the end of a long peninsula made Kilmore Castle an isolated little kingdom of its own. On the shore stood a row of low, fishermen's white-washed cabins, dignified by the name of \"the village\"; but otherwise there was no human habitation in sight, and Ballycroghan, the market town and nearest postal, railway, and telegraph station, was ten miles off.  Trees were rarities at Kilmore; a few stunted specimens, all blown one way by the prevailing gale, grew as if huddled together for protection at the foot of the glen, but they were the exception that proved the rule; nevertheless, under the sheltering walls of the Castle Mrs. Fitzgerald had managed to acclimatize some exotic shrubs, and to cultivate quite a beautiful garden of flowers, for the temperature was uniformly mild, though the winds were boisterous. Brilliant St. Brigid's anemones, the poet's narcissus, tulips, jonquils, and hyacinths bloomed here almost as early as in the Scilly Isles, and made patches of fragrant brightness under the sitting-room windows; while in the crannies of the walls might be seen delicate maidenhair and other ferns, too tender generally to stand a winter in the open.  Born and bred in this far-away corner of the world, Honor had grown up almost a child of nature. Her whole life had been spent as much as possible out-of-doors, boating, fishing, or swimming in the creek; driving in a low-backed car over the rough Kerry roads; galloping her shaggy little pony on the moors; following the otter hounds up the river, and sharing in any sport that her father considered suitable for her age and sex. She was the only girl among five brothers, and in her mother's opinion was by far the most difficult to manage of the whole flock. All the wild Irish blood of the family seemed to have settled in her; the high spirits, the fire, the pride, the quick temper, the impatience of control, the happy-go-lucky, idle, irresponsible ways of a long line of hot-headed ancestors had skipped a generation or two, and, as if they had been bottling themselves up during the interval, had reappeared with renewed force in this particular specimen of the Fitzgerald race.  \"She's more trouble than the five boys put together,\" her mother often declared, and her friends cordially agreed with her. Mrs. Fitzgerald herself was a mild, quiet, nervous, delicate lady, as much astonished at her lively, tempestuous daughter as a meek little hedge-sparrow would be, that had hatched a young cuckoo. Frankly, she did not understand Honor, whose strong, uncontrolled character differed so entirely from her own gentle, clinging, dependent disposition; and whose storms of grief or anger, wild fits of waywardness and equally passionate repentance, and self-willed disobedience, alternating with sudden bursts of reformation, were a constant source of worry and anxiety, and the direct opposite of her ideal of girlhood. Poor Mrs. Fitzgerald would have liked a docile, tractable daughter, who would have been content to sit beside her sofa doing fancy work, instead of riding to hounds; and who would have had more consideration for her weak state of health. She appreciated Honor's warm-hearted affection to the full, but at the same time wished she could make her realize that rough hugs, boisterous kisses, and loud tones were hardly suitable to an invalid. Suffering as she was from a painful and incurable complaint, it was sometimes impossible for her to admit Honor to her sick-room, and for weeks together the girl would hardly see her mother. It was through no lack of love that Honor had failed to give that service and tenderness which, in the circumstances, an only daughter might so fitly have rendered; it was from sheer want of thought, and general heedlessness. Some girls early acquire a sense of responsibility and care for others, but in Honor these qualities were as undeveloped as in a child of six.  Many were the governesses who had attempted to tame the young rebel, and bring her into a state of law and order, but all had been equal failures. She had learnt lessons when she felt inclined, and left them undone when she was idle; and she had managed to make life in the schoolroom such a purgatory that it had been difficult to persuade any teacher to stay long at the Castle, and cope with so thankless a task as her education.  It had been of little use to complain to her father, the only person in the world whose authority she recognized; he was proud of his handsome daughter, and, except when her temper crossed his own, was apt to indulge her in most of her whims. Matters had at last, however, come to a crisis. An act of more than usual assumption on Honor's part had aroused Major Fitzgerald's utmost indignation, and had caused him"]]]
