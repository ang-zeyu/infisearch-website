Reid collects together a group of six men who would pay to take part in an expedition, camping and hunting, into the prairies.  They take with them a couple of paid men, professionals who would give them very necessary guidance.  They all make a pact that they would each tell a round of tales around the camp fire, such stories to be amusing and instructive.  Reid himself is something of a naturalist, as we can learn from his many other books.  We are given these tales just as they are told, in good English if told by an educated man, and in the dialect of the less educated ones.  This latter arrangement makes the checking of the OCR transcriptions a little difficult, but never mind.  What people may find a little tedious is Reid's habit of giving the naturalists' Latin names for the various animals and plants described.  ________________________________________________________________________ THE HUNTERS' FEAST, BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID.    CHAPTER ONE.  A HUNTING PARTY.  On the western bank of the Mississippi, twelve miles below the _embouchure_ of the Missouri, stands the large town of Saint Louis, poetically known as the \"Mound City.\"  Although there are many other large towns throughout the Mississippi Valley, Saint Louis is the true metropolis of the \"far west\"--of that semi-civilised, ever-changing belt of territory known as the \"Frontier.\"  Saint Louis is one of those American cities in the history of which there is something of peculiar interest.  It is one of the oldest of North-American settlements, having been a French trading port at an early period.  Though not so successful as their rivals the English, there was a degree of picturesqueness about French colonisation, that, in the present day, strongly claims the attention of the American poet, novelist, and historian.  Their dealings with the Indian aborigines--the facile manner in which they glided into the habits of the latter--meeting them more than half-way between civilisation and savage life--the handsome nomenclature which they have scattered freely, and which still holds over the trans-Mississippian territories--the introduction of a new race (the half blood--peculiarly French)--the heroic and adventurous character of their earliest pioneers, De Salle Marquette, Father Hennepin, etcetera--their romantic explorations and melancholy fate--all these circumstances have rendered extremely interesting the early history of the French in America.  Even the Quixotism of some of their attempts at colonisation cannot fail to interest us, as at Gallipolis on the Ohio, a colony composed of expatriated people of the French court;-- perruquiers, coachbuilders, tailors, _modistes_, and the like.  Here, in the face of hostile Indians, before an acre of ground was cleared, before the slightest provision was made for their future subsistence, the first house erected was a large log structure, to serve as the _salon du Lal_!  Besides its French origin, Saint Louis possesses many other points of interest.  It has long been the _entrepot_ and _depot_ of commerce with the wild tribes of prairie-land.  There the trader is supplied with his stock for the Indian market--his red and green blanket--his beads and trinkets--his rifles, and powder, and lead; and there, in return, he disposes of the spoils of the prairie collected in many a far and perilous wandering.  There the emigrant rests on the way to his wilderness home; and the hunter equips himself before starting forth on some new expedition.  To the traveller, Saint Louis is a place of peculiar interest.  He will hear around him the language of every nation in the civilised world.  He will behold faces of every hue and variety of expression.  He will meet with men of every possible calling.  All this is peculiarly true in the latter part of the summer season. Then the motley population of New Orleans fly from the annual scourge of the yellow fever, and seek safety in the cities that lie farther north. Of these, Saint Louis is a favourite \"city of refuge,\"--the Creole element of its population being related to that kindred race in the South, and keeping up with it this annual correspondence.  In one of these streams of migration I had found my way to Saint Louis, in the autumn of 18--.  The place was at the time filled with loungers, who seemed to have nothing else to do but kill time.  Every hotel had its quota, and in every verandah and at the corners of the streets you might see small knots of well-dressed gentlemen trying to entertain each other, and laugh away the hours.  Most of them were the annual birds of passage from New Orleans, who had fled from \"yellow Jack,\" and were sojourning here till the cold frosty winds of November should drive that intruder from the \"crescent city;\" but there were many other _flaneurs_ as well.  There were travellers from Europe:--men of wealth and rank who had left behind them the luxuries of civilised society to rough it for a season in the wild West--painters in search of the picturesque-- naturalists whose love of their favourite study had drawn them from their comfortable closets to search for knowledge under circumstances of extremest difficulty--and sportsmen, who, tired of chasing small game, were on their way to the great plains to take part in the noble sport of hunting the buffalo.  I was myself one of the last-named fraternity.  There is no country in the world so addicted to the _table d'hote_ as America, and that very custom soon makes idle people acquainted with each other.  I was not very long in the place before I was upon terms of intimacy with a large number of these loungers, and I found several, like myself, desirous of making a hunting expedition to the prairies. This chimed in with my plans to a nicety, and I at once set about getting up the expedition.  I found five others who were willing to join me.  After several _conversaziones_, with much discussion, we succeeded at length in \"fixing\" our plan.  Each was to \"equip\" according to his own fancy, though it was necessary for each to provide himself with a riding horse or mule.  After that, a general fund was to be \"raised,\" to be appropriated to the purchase of a waggon and team, with tents, stores, and cooking utensils.  A couple of professional hunters were to be engaged; men who knew the ground to be traversed, and who were to act as guides to the expedition.  About a week was consumed in making the necessary preparations, and at the end of that time, under the sunrise of a lovely morning, a small cavalcade was seen to issue from the back suburbs of Saint Louis, and, climbing the undulating slopes in its rear, head for the far-stretching wilderness of the prairies.  It was our hunting expedition.  The cavalcade consisted of eight mounted men, and a waggon with its full team of six tough mules.  These last were under the _manege_ of \"Jake\"-- a free negro, with a shining black face, a thick full mop, and a set of the best \"ivories,\" which were almost always uncovered in a smile.  Peeping from under the tilt of the waggon might be seen another face strongly contrasting with that of Jake.  This had been originally of a reddish hue, but sun-tan, and a thick sprinkling of freckles, had changed the red to golden-yellow.  A shock of fiery hair surmounted this visage, which was partially concealed under a badly-battered hat. Though the face of the black expressed good-humour, it might have been called sad when brought into comparison with that of the little red man, which peeped out beside it.  Upon the latter, there was an expression irresistibly comic--the expression of an actor in broad farce.  One eye was continually on the wink, while the other looked knowing enough for both.  A short clay-pipe, stuck jauntily between the lips, added to the comical expression of the face, which was that of Mike Lanty from Limerick.  No one ever mistook the nationality of Michael.  Who were the eight cavaliers that accompanied the waggon?  Six of them were gentlemen by birth and education.  At least half that number were scholars.  The other two laid no claim either to gentleness or scholarship--they were rude trappers--the hunters and guides of the expedition.  A word about each one of the eight, for there was not one of them without his peculiarity.  First, there was an Englishman--a genuine type of his countrymen--full six feet high, well proportioned, with broad chest and shoulders, and massive limbs.  Hair of a light brown, complexion florid, moustache and whiskers full and hay-coloured, but suiting well the complexion and features.  The last were regular, and if not handsome, at least good humoured and noble in their expression.  The owner was in reality a nobleman--a true nobleman--one of that class who, while travelling through the \"States,\" have the good sense to carry their umbrella along, and leave their title behind them.  To us he was known as Mr Thompson, and, after some time, when we had all become familiar with each other, as plain \"Thompson.\"  It was only long after, and by accident, that I became acquainted with his rank and title; some of our companions do not know it to this day, but that is of no consequence.  I mention the circumstance here to aid me in illustrating the character of our travelling companion, who was \"close\" and modest almost to a fault.  His costume was characteristic.  A \"tweed\" shooting jacket, of course, with eight pockets--a vest of the same material with four--tweed browsers, and a tweed cap.  In the waggon was _the hat-box_; of strong yellow leather, with straps and padlock.  This was supposed to contain the dress hat; and some of the party were merry about it.  But no--Mr Thompson was a more experienced traveller than his companions thought him at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],["title","The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#1)"],["body","rst.  The contents of the hat-case were sundry brushes-- including one for the teeth--combs, razors, and pieces of soap.  The hat had been left at Saint Louis.  But the umbrella had _not_.  It was then under Thompson's arm, with its full proportions of whalebone and gingham.  Under that umbrella he had hunted tigers in the jungles of India--under that umbrella he had chased the lion upon the plains of Africa--under that umbrella he had pursued the ostrich and the vicuna over the pampas of South America; and now under that same hemisphere of blue gingham he was about to carry terror and destruction among the wild buffaloes of the prairies.  Besides the umbrella--strictly a weapon of defence--Mr Thompson carried another, a heavy double-barrelled gun, marked \"Bishop, of Bond Street,\" no bad weapon with a loading of buck-shot, and with this both barrels were habitually loaded.  So much for Mr Thompson, who may pass for Number 1 of the hunting party.  He was mounted on a strong bay cob, with tail cut short, and English saddle, both of which objects--the short tail and the saddle-- were curiosities to all of the party except Mr Thompson and myself.  Number 2 was as unlike Number 1 as two animals of the same species could possibly be.  He was a Kentuckian, full six inches taller than Thompson, or indeed than any of the party.  His features were marked, prominent and irregular, and this irregularity was increased by a \"cheekful\" of half-chewed tobacco.  His complexion was dark, almost olive, and the face quite naked, without either moustache or whisker; but long straight hair, black as an Indian's, hung down to his shoulders.  In fact, there was a good deal of the Indian look about him, except in his figure. That was somewhat slouched, with arms and limbs of over-length, loosely hung about it.  Both, however, though not modelled after the Apollo, were evidently full of muscle and tough strength, and looked as though their owner could return the hug of a bear with interest.  There was a gravity in his look, but that was not from any gravity of spirits; it was his swarth complexion that gave him this appearance, aided, no doubt, by several lines of \"ambeer\" proceeding from the corners of his mouth in the direction of the chin.  So far from being grave, this dark Kentuckian was as gay and buoyant as any of the party.  Indeed, a light and boyish spirit is a characteristic of the Kentuckian as well as of all the natives of the Mississippi Valley--at least such has been my observation.  Our Kentuckian was costumed just as he would have been upon a cool morning riding about the \"woodland\" of his own plantation, for a \"planter\" he was.  He wore a \"Jeans\" frock, and over that a long-tailed overcoat of the best green blanket, with side pockets and flaps.  His jeans pantaloons were stuck into a pair of heavy horse-leather pegged boots, sometimes known as \"nigger\" boots; but over these were \"wrappers\" of green baize, fastened with a string above the knees.  His hat was a \"broad-brimmed felt,\" costly enough, but somewhat crushed by being sat upon and slept in.  He bestrode a tall raw-boned stood that possessed many of the characteristics of the rider; and in the same proportion that the latter overtopped his companions, so did the steed out-size all the other horses of the cavalcade.  Over the shoulders of the Kentuckian were suspended, by several straps, pouch, horn, and haversack, and resting upon his toe was the butt of a heavy rifle, the muzzle of which reached to a level with his shoulder.  He was a rich Kentucky planter, and known in his native state as a great deer-hunter.  Some business or pleasure had brought him to Saint Louis. It was hinted that Kentucky was becoming too thickly settled for him-- deer becoming scarce, and bear hardly to be found--and that his visit to Saint Louis had something to do with seeking a new \"location\" where these animals were still to be met with in greater plenty.  The idea of buffalo-hunting was just to his liking.  The expedition would carry him through the frontier country, where he might afterwards choose his \"location\"--at all events the sport would repay him, and he was one of the most enthusiastic in regard to it.  He that looms up on the retrospect of my memory as Number 3 was as unlike the Kentuckian, as the latter was to Thompson.  He was a disciple of Esculapius--not thin and pale, as these usually are, but fat, red, and jolly.  I think he was originally a \"Yankee,\" though his long residence in the Western States had rubbed the Yankee out of him to a great extent.  At all events he had few of their characteristics about him.  He was neither staid, sober, nor, what is usually alleged as a trait of the true bred Yankee, \"stingy.\"  On the contrary, our doctor was full of talk and joviality--generous to a fault.  A fault, indeed; for, although many years in practice in various parts of the United States, and having earned large sums of money, at the date of our expedition we found him in Saint Louis almost without a dollar, and with no great stock of patients.  The truth must be told; the doctor was of a restless disposition, and liked his glass too well.  He was a singer too, a fine amateur singer, with a voice equal to Mario's.  That may partly account for his failure in securing a fortune.  He was a favourite with all--ladies included--and so fond of good company, that he preferred the edge of the jovial board to the bed-side of a patient.  Not from any fondness for buffalo-hunting, but rather through an attachment to some of the company, had the doctor volunteered.  Indeed, he was solicited by all to make one of us--partly on account of his excellent society, and partly that his professional services might be called into requisition before our return.  The doctor still preserved his professional costume of black--somewhat russet by long wear--but this was modified by a close-fitting fur cap, and wrappers of brown cloth, which he wore around his short thick legs. He was not over-well mounted--a very spare little horse was all he had, as his funds would not stretch to a better.  It was quite a quiet one, however, and carried the doctor and his \"medical saddle-bags\" steadily enough, though not without a good deal of spurring and whipping.  The doctor's name was \"Jopper\"--Dr John Jopper.  A very elegant youth, with fine features, rolling black eyes, and luxuriant curled hair, was one of us.  The hands were well formed and delicate; the complexion silky, and of nearly an olive tint; but the purplish-red broke through upon his cheeks, giving the earnest of health, as well as adding to the picturesque beauty of his face.  The form was perfect, and full of manly expression, and the pretty sky-blue plaited pantaloons and close-fitting jacket of the same material, sat gracefully on his well-turned limbs and arms.  These garments were of \"cottonade,\" that beautiful and durable fabric peculiar to Louisiana, and so well suited to the southern climate.  A costly Panama hat cast its shadow over the wavy curls and pictured cheek of this youth, and a cloak of fine broad cloth, with velvet facings, hung loosely from his shoulders.  A slight moustache and imperial lent a manlier expression to his chiselled features.  This young fellow was a Creole of Louisiana--a student of one of the Jesuit Colleges of that State--and although very unlike what would be expected from such a dashing personage, he was an ardent, even passionate, lover of nature.  Though still young, he was the most accomplished botanist in his State, and had already published several discoveries in the _Flora_ of the South.  Of course the expedition was to him a delightful anticipation.  It would afford the finest opportunity for prosecuting his favourite study in a new field; one as yet almost unvisited by the scientific traveller.  The young Creole was known as Jules Besancon.  He was not the only naturalist of the party.  Another was with us; one who had already acquired a world-wide fame; whose name was as familiar to the _savans_ of Europe as to his own countrymen.  He was already an old man, almost venerable in his aspect, but his tread was firm, and his arm still strong enough to steady his long, heavy, double-barrelled rifle.  An ample coat of dark blue covered his body; his limbs were enveloped in long buttoned leggings of drab cloth, and a cap of sable surmounted his high, broad forehead.  Under this his blueish grey eye glanced with a calm but clear intelligence, and a single look from it satisfied you that you were in the presence of a superior mind.  Were I to give the name of this person, this would readily be acknowledged. For certain reasons I cannot do this.  Suffice it to say, he was one of the most distinguished of modern zoologists, and to his love for the study we were indebted for his companionship upon our hunting expedition.  He was known to us as Mr A-- the \"hunter-naturalist.\" There was no jealousy between him and the young Besancon.  On the contrary, a similarity of tastes soon brought about a mutual friendship, and the Creole was observed to treat the other with marked deference and regard.  I may set myself down as Number 6 of the party.  Let a short description of me suffice.  I was then but a young fellow, educated somewhat better than common; fond of wild sports; not indifferent to a knowledge of nature; fond almost to folly of a good horse, and possessing one of the very best; not ill-looking in the face, and of middle stature; costumed in a light hunting-shirt of embroidered buckskin, with fringed cape and skirt; leggings of scarlet cloth, and cloth forage-cap, covering a flock of dark hair.  Powder-flask and pouch of tasty patterns; belt around the waist, with hunting-knife and pistols--revolvers.  A light rifle in one hand, and in the other a bridle-rein, which guided a steed of coal blackness; one that would have been celebrated in song by a troubadour of the olden time.  A deep Spanish saddle of "]]]
