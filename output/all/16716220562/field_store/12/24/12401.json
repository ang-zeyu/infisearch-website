But wherefore not?—’Tis pleasant, nice,    Euphonious, though I know a spice    It carries of antiquity    And of the attic. Honestly,    We must admit but little taste    Doth in us or our names appear(26)    (I speak not of our poems here),    And education runs to waste,    Endowing us from out her store    With affectation,—nothing more.     [Note 26: The Russian annotator remarks: “The most euphonious    Greek names, e.g. Agathon, Philotas, Theodora, Thekla, etc.,    are used amongst us by the lower classes only.”]     XXV     And so Tattiana was her name,    Nor by her sister’s brilliancy    Nor by her beauty she became    The cynosure of every eye.    Shy, silent did the maid appear    As in the timid forest deer,    Even beneath her parents’ roof    Stood as estranged from all aloof,    Nearest and dearest knew not how    To fawn upon and love express;    A child devoid of childishness    To romp and play she ne’er would go:    Oft staring through the window pane    Would she in silence long remain.     XXVI     Contemplativeness, her delight,    E’en from her cradle’s earliest dream,    Adorned with many a vision bright    Of rural life the sluggish stream;    Ne’er touched her fingers indolent    The needle nor, o’er framework bent,    Would she the canvas tight enrich    With gay design and silken stitch.    Desire to rule ye may observe    When the obedient doll in sport    An infant maiden doth exhort    Polite demeanour to preserve,    Gravely repeating to another    Recent instructions of its mother.     XXVII     But Tania ne’er displayed a passion    For dolls, e’en from her earliest years,    And gossip of the town and fashion    She ne’er repeated unto hers.    Strange unto her each childish game,    But when the winter season came    And dark and drear the evenings were,    Terrible tales she loved to hear.    And when for Olga nurse arrayed    In the broad meadow a gay rout,    All the young people round about,    At prisoner’s base she never played.    Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,    Their giddy sports she ne’er enjoyed.     XXVIII     She loved upon the balcony    To anticipate the break of day,    When on the pallid eastern sky    The starry beacons fade away,    The horizon luminous doth grow,    Morning’s forerunners, breezes blow    And gradually day unfolds.    In winter, when Night longer holds    A hemisphere beneath her sway,    Longer the East inert reclines    Beneath the moon which dimly shines,    And calmly sleeps the hours away,    At the same hour she oped her eyes    And would by candlelight arise.     XXIX     Romances pleased her from the first,    Her all in all did constitute;    In love adventures she was versed,    Rousseau and Richardson to boot.    Not a bad fellow was her father    Though superannuated rather;    In books he saw nought to condemn    But, as he never opened them,    Viewed them with not a little scorn,    And gave himself but little pain    His daughter’s book to ascertain    Which ’neath her pillow lay till morn.    His wife was also mad upon    The works of Mr. Richardson.     XXX     She was thus fond of Richardson    Not that she had his works perused,    Or that adoring Grandison    That rascal Lovelace she abused;    But that Princess Pauline of old,    Her Moscow cousin, often told    The tale of these romantic men;    Her husband was a bridegroom then,    And she despite herself would waste    Sighs on another than her lord    Whose qualities appeared to afford    More satisfaction to her taste.    Her Grandison was in the Guard,    A noted fop who gambled hard.     XXXI     Like his, her dress was always nice,    The height of fashion, fitting tight,    But contrary to her advice    The girl in marriage they unite.    Then, her distraction to allay,    The bridegroom sage without delay    Removed her to his country seat,    Where God alone knows whom she met.    She struggled hard at first thus pent,    Night separated from her spouse,    Then became busy with the house,    First reconciled and then content;    Habit was given us in distress    By Heaven in lieu of happiness.     XXXII     Habit alleviates the grief    Inseparable from our lot;    This great discovery relief    And consolation soon begot.    And then she soon ’twixt work and leisure    Found out the secret how at pleasure    To dominate her worthy lord,    And harmony was soon restored.    The workpeople she superintended,    Mushrooms for winter salted down,    Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,(*)    The bath on Saturdays attended,    When angry beat her maids, I grieve,    And all without her husband’s leave.     [Note: The serfs destined for military service used to have    a portion of their heads shaved as a distinctive mark.]     XXXIII     In her friends’ albums, time had been,    With blood instead of ink she scrawled,    Baptized Prascovia Pauline,    And in her conversation drawled.    She wore her corset tightly bound,    The Russian N with nasal sound    She would pronounce _à la Française_;    But soon she altered all her ways,    Corset and album and Pauline,    Her sentimental verses all,    She soon forgot, began to call    Akulka who was once Celine,    And had with waddling in the end    Her caps and night-dresses to mend.     XXXIV     As for her spouse he loved her dearly,    In her affairs ne’er interfered,    Entrusted all to her sincerely,    In dressing-gown at meals appeared.    Existence calmly sped along,    And oft at eventide a throng    Of friends unceremonious would    Assemble from the neighbourhood:    They growl a bit—they scandalise—    They crack a feeble joke and smile—    Thus the time passes and meanwhile    Olga the tea must supervise—    ’Tis time for supper, now for bed,    And soon the friendly troop hath fled.     XXXV     They in a peaceful life preserved    Customs by ages sanctified,    Strictly the Carnival observed,    Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,    Twice in the year to fast were bound,    Of whirligigs were very fond,    Of Christmas carols, song and dance;    When people with long countenance    On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,    Three tears they dropt with humble mein    Upon a bunch of lovage green;    _Kvass_ needful was to them as air;    On guests their servants used to wait    By rank as settled by the State.(27)     [Note 27: The foregoing stanza requires explanation. Russian    pancakes or “blinni” are consumed vigorously by the lower    orders during the Carnival. At other times it is difficult    to procure them, at any rate in the large towns.     The Russian peasants are childishly fond of whirligigs, which    are also much in vogue during the Carnival.     “Christmas Carols” is not an exact equivalent for the Russian    phrase. “Podbliudni pessni,” are literally “dish songs,” or    songs used with dishes (of water) during the “sviatki” or Holy    Nights, which extend from Christmas to Twelfth Night, for    purposes of divination. Reference will again be made to this    superstitious practice, which is not confined to Russia. See Note 52.     “Song and dance,” the well-known “khorovod,” in which the dance    proceeds to vocal music.     “Lovage,” the _Levisticum officinalis_, is a hardy plant growing    very far north, though an inhabitant of our own kitchen gardens.    The passage containing the reference to the three tears and    Trinity Sunday was at first deemed irreligious by the Russian    censors, and consequently expunged.     _Kvass_ is of various sorts: there is the common _kvass_ of    fermented rye used by the peasantry, and the more expensive    _kvass_ of the restaurants, iced and flavoured with various fruits.     The final two lines refer to the “Tchin,” or Russian social    hierarchy. There are fourteen grades in the Tchin assigning    relative rank and precedence to the members of the various    departments of the State, civil, military, naval, court,    scientific and educational. The military and naval grades from    the 14th up to the 7th confer personal nobility only, whilst    above the 7th hereditary rank is acquired. In the remaining    departments, civil or otherwise, personal nobility is only    attained with the 9th grade, hereditary with the 4th.]     XXXVI     Thus age approached, the common doom,    And death before the husband wide    Opened the portals of the tomb    And a new diadem supplied.(28)    Just before dinner-time he slept,    By neighbouring families bewept,    By children and by faithful wife    With deeper woe than others’ grief.    He was an honest gentleman,    And where at last his bones repose    The epitaph on marble shows:    _Demetrius Larine, sinful man,    Servant of God and brigadier,    Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.     [Note 28: A play upon the word “venetz,” crown, which also    signifies a nimbus or glory, and is the symbol of marriage    from the fact of two gilt crowns being held over the heads    of the bride and bridegroom during the ceremony. The literal    meaning of the passage is therefore: his earthly marriage    was dissolved and a heavenly one was contracted.]     XXXVII     To his Penates now returned,    Vladimir Lenski visited    His neighbour’s lowly tomb and mourned    Above the ashes of the dead.    There long time sad at heart he stayed:    “Poor Yorick,” mournfully he said,    “How often in thine arms I lay;    How with thy medal I would play,    The Medal Otchakoff conferred!(29)    To me he would his Olga give,    Would whisper: shall I so long live?”—    And by a genuine sorrow stirred,    Lenski his pencil-case took out    And an elegiac poem wrote.     [Note 29: The fortress of Otchakoff was taken by storm on the    18th December 1788 by a Russian army under Prince Potemkin.    Thirty thousand Turks are said to have perished during the    assault and ensuing massacre.]     XXXVIII     Likewise an epitaph with tears    "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],["title","Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#8)"],["body","writes upon his parents’ tomb,    And thus ancestral dust reveres.    Oh! on the fields of life how bloom    Harvests of souls unceasingly    By Providence’s dark decree!    They blossom, ripen and they fall    And others rise ephemeral!    Thus our light race grows up and lives,    A moment effervescing stirs,    Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,    The appointed hour arrives, arrives!    And our successors soon shall drive    Us from the world wherein we live.     XXXIX     Meantime, drink deeply of the flow    Of frivolous existence, friends;    Its insignificance I know    And care but little for its ends.    To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,    Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise    And agitate my heart again;    And thus it is ’twould cause me pain    Without the faintest trace to leave    This world. I do not praise desire,    Yet still apparently aspire    My mournful fate in verse to weave,    That like a friendly voice its tone    Rescue me from oblivion.     XL     Perchance some heart ’twill agitate,    And then the stanzas of my theme    Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,    Perish absorbed by Lethe’s stream.    Then it may be, O flattering tale,    Some future ignoramus shall    My famous portrait indicate    And cry: he was a poet great!    My gratitude do not disdain,    Admirer of the peaceful Muse,    Whose memory doth not refuse    My light productions to retain,    Whose hands indulgently caress    The bays of age and helplessness.     End of Canto the Second.           CANTO THE THIRD      The Country Damsel     ‘Elle était fille, elle était amoureuse’—Malfilatre     Canto The Third     [Note: Odessa and Mikhailovskoe, 1824.]     I     “Whither away? Deuce take the bard!”—    “Good-bye, Onéguine, I must go.”—    “I won’t detain you; but ’tis hard    To guess how you the eve pull through.”—    “At Làrina’s.”—“Hem, that is queer!    Pray is it not a tough affair    Thus to assassinate the eve?”—    “Not at all.”—“That I can’t conceive!    ’Tis something of this sort I deem.    In the first place, say, am I right?    A Russian household simple quite,    Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,    Preserves and an eternal prattle    About the rain and flax and cattle.”—     II     “No misery I see in that”—    “Boredom, my friend, behold the ill—”    “Your fashionable world I hate,    Domestic life attracts me still,    Where—”—“What! another eclogue spin?    For God’s sake, Lenski, don’t begin!    What! really going? ’Tis too bad!    But Lenski, I should be so glad    Would you to me this Phyllis show,    Fair source of every fine idea,    Verses and tears et cetera.    Present me.”—“You are joking.”—“No.”—    “Delighted.”—“When?”—“This very night.    They will receive us with delight.”     III     Whilst homeward by the nearest route    Our heroes at full gallop sped,    Can we not stealthily make out    What they in conversation said?—    “How now, Onéguine, yawning still?”—    “’Tis habit, Lenski.”—“Is your ill    More troublesome than usual?”—“No!    How dark the night is getting though!    Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!    The drive becomes monotonous—    Well! Làrina appears to us    An ancient lady full of grace.—    That bilberry wine, I’m sore afraid,    The deuce with my inside has played.”     IV     “Say, of the two which was Tattiana?”    “She who with melancholy face    And silent as the maid Svetlana(30)    Hard by the window took her place.”—    “The younger, you’re in love with her!”    “Well!”—“I the elder should prefer,    Were I like you a bard by trade—    In Olga’s face no life’s displayed.    ’Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,    An oval countenance and pink,    Yon silly moon upon the brink    Of the horizon she is like!”—    Vladimir something curtly said    Nor further comment that night made.     [Note 30: “Svetlana,” a short poem by Joukóvski, upon which his    fame mainly rests. Joukóvski was an unblushing plagiarist. Many    eminent English poets have been laid under contribution by him,    often without going through the form of acknowledging the    source of inspiration. Even the poem in question cannot be    pronounced entirely original, though its intrinsic beauty is    unquestionable. It undoubtedly owes its origin to Burger’s poem    “Leonora,” which has found so many English translators. Not    content with a single development of Burger’s ghastly production    the Russian poet has directly paraphrased “Leonora” under its    own title, and also written a poem “Liudmila” in imitation of it.    The principal outlines of these three poems are as follows: A    maiden loses her lover in the wars; she murmurs at Providence    and is vainly reproved for such blasphemy by her mother.    Providence at length loses patience and sends her lover’s spirit,    to all appearances as if in the flesh, who induces the unfortunate    maiden to elope. Instead of riding to a church or bridal chamber    the unpleasant bridegroom resorts to the graveyard and repairs to    his own grave, from which he has recently issued to execute his    errand. It is a repulsive subject. “Svetlana,” however, is more    agreeable than its prototype “Leonora,” inasmuch as the whole    catastrophe turns out a dream brought on by “sorcery,” during the    “sviatki” or Holy Nights (see Canto V. st. x), and the dreamer    awakes to hear the tinkling of her lover’s sledge approaching.    “Svetlana” has been translated by Sir John Bowring.]     V     Meantime Onéguine’s apparition    At Làrina’s abode produced    Quite a sensation; the position    To all good neighbours’ sport conduced.    Endless conjectures all propound    And secretly their views expound.    What jokes and guesses now abound,    A beau is for Tattiana found!    In fact, some people were assured    The wedding-day had been arranged,    But the date subsequently changed    Till proper rings could be procured.    On Lenski’s matrimonial fate    They long ago had held debate.     VI     Of course Tattiana was annoyed    By such allusions scandalous,    Yet was her inmost soul o’erjoyed    With satisfaction marvellous,    As in her heart the thought sank home,    I am in love, my hour hath come!    Thus in the earth the seed expands    Obedient to warm Spring’s commands.    Long time her young imagination    By indolence and languor fired    The fated nutriment desired;    And long internal agitation    Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,    She waited for—I don’t know whom!     VII     The fatal hour had come at last—    She oped her eyes and cried: ’tis he!    Alas! for now before her passed    The same warm vision constantly;    Now all things round about repeat    Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet    His name: the tenderness of home    Tiresome unto her hath become    And the kind-hearted servitors:    Immersed in melancholy thought,    She hears of conversation nought    And hated casual visitors,    Their coming which no man expects,    And stay whose length none recollects.     VIII     Now with what eager interest    She the delicious novel reads,    With what avidity and zest    She drinks in those seductive deeds!    All the creations which below    From happy inspiration flow,    The swain of Julia Wolmar,    Malek Adel and De Linar,(31)    Werther, rebellious martyr bold,    And that unrivalled paragon,    The sleep-compelling Grandison,    Our tender dreamer had enrolled    A single being: ’twas in fine    No other than Onéguine mine.     [Note 31: The heroes of two romances much in vogue in Pushkin’s    time: the former by Madame Cottin, the latter by the famous    Madame Krudener. The frequent mention in the course of this    poem of romances once enjoying a European celebrity but now    consigned to oblivion, will impress the reader with the    transitory nature of merely mediocre literary reputation. One    has now to search for the very names of most of the popular    authors of Pushkin’s day and rummage biographical dictionaries    for the dates of their births and deaths. Yet the poet’s prime    was but fifty years ago, and had he lived to a ripe old age he    would have been amongst us still. He was four years younger    than the late Mr. Thomas Carlyle. The decadence of Richardson’s    popularity amongst his countrymen is a fact familiar to all.]     IX     Dreaming herself the heroine    Of the romances she preferred,    Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,—(32)    Tattiana through the forest erred,    And the bad book accompanies.    Upon those pages she descries    Her passion’s faithful counterpart,    Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.    She heaves a sigh and deep intent    On raptures, sorrows not her own,    She murmurs in an undertone    A letter for her hero meant:    That hero, though his merit shone,    Was certainly no Grandison.     [Note 32: Referring to Richardson’s “Clarissa Harlowe,” “La    Nouvelle Heloise,” and Madame de Stael’s “Delphine.”]     X     Alas! my friends, the years flit by    And after them at headlong pace    The evanescent fashions fly    In motley and amusing chase.    The world is ever altering!    Farthingales, patches, were the thing,    And courtier, fop, and usurer    Would once in powdered wig appear;    Time was, the poet’s tender quill    In hopes of everlasting fame    A finished madrigal would frame    Or couplets more ingenious still;    Time was, a valiant general might    Serve who could neither read nor write.     XI     Time was, in style magniloquent    Authors replete with sacred fire    Their heroes used to represent    All that perfection could desire;    Ever by adverse fate oppressed,    Their idols they were wont to invest    With intellect, a taste refined,    And handsome countenance combined,    A heart wherein pure passion burnt;    The excited hero in a trice    Was ready for self-sacrifice,    And in the final tome we learnt,    Vice had due punishment awarded,    Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
