Never was word yet rung so in my ears--                             90     Worse than the rabble's shout, or splitting trumpet:     I've heard thy sister talk of nothing else.      _Sal._ To change the irksome theme, then, hear of vice.      _Sar._ From whom?      _Sal._             Even from the winds, if thou couldst listen     Unto the echoes of the Nation's voice.      _Sar._ Come, I'm indulgent, as thou knowest, patient,     As thou hast often proved--speak out, what moves thee?      _Sal._ Thy peril.      _Sar._             Say on.      _Sal._                     Thus, then: all the nations,     For they are many, whom thy father left     In heritage, are loud in wrath against thee.                       100      _Sar._ 'Gainst _me!!_ What would the slaves?      _Sal._                                         A king.      _Sar._                                                 And what     Am I then?      _Sal._     In their eyes a nothing; but     In mine a man who might be something still.      _Sar._ The railing drunkards! why, what would they have?     Have they not peace and plenty?      _Sal._                          Of the first     More than is glorious: of the last, far less     Than the King recks of.      _Sar._                  Whose then is the crime,     But the false satraps, who provide no better?      _Sal._ And somewhat in the Monarch who ne'er looks     Beyond his palace walls, or if he stirs                            110     Beyond them, 'tis but to some mountain palace,     Till summer heats wear down. O glorious Baal!     Who built up this vast empire, and wert made     A God, or at the least shinest like a God     Through the long centuries of thy renown,     This, thy presumed descendant, ne'er beheld     As king the kingdoms thou didst leave as hero,     Won with thy blood, and toil, and time, and peril!     For what? to furnish imposts for a revel,     Or multiplied extortions for a minion.                             120      _Sar._ I understand thee--thou wouldst have me go     Forth as a conqueror. By all the stars     Which the Chaldeans read--the restless slaves[e]     Deserve that I should curse them with their wishes,     And lead them forth to glory.      _Sal._                       Wherefore not?     Semiramis--a woman only--led     These our Assyrians to the solar shores     Of Ganges.      _Sar._    Tis most true. And _how_ returned?      _Sal._ Why, like a _man_--a hero; baffled, but     Not vanquished. With but twenty guards, she made                   130     Good her retreat to Bactria.      _Sar._                       And how many     Left she behind in India to the vultures?      _Sal._ Our annals say not.      _Sar._                    Then I will say for them--     That she had better woven within her palace     Some twenty garments, than with twenty guards     Have fled to Bactria, leaving to the ravens,     And wolves, and men--the fiercer of the three,     Her myriads of fond subjects. Is _this_ Glory?     Then let me live in ignominy ever.      _Sal._ All warlike spirits have not the same fate.                 140     Semiramis, the glorious parent of     A hundred kings, although she failed in India,     Brought Persia--Media--Bactria--to the realm     Which she once swayed--and thou _mightst_ sway.      _Sar._                                         _I sway_ them--     She but subdued them.      _Sal._                It may be ere long     That they will need her sword more than your sceptre.      _Sar._ There was a certain Bacchus, was there not?     I've heard my Greek girls speak of such--they say     He was a God, that is, a Grecian god,     An idol foreign to Assyria's worship,                              150     Who conquered this same golden realm of Ind     Thou prat'st of, where Semiramis was vanquished.      _Sal._ I have heard of such a man; and thou perceiv'st     That he is deemed a God for what he did.      _Sar._ And in his godship I will honour him--     Not much as man. What, ho! my cupbearer!      _Sal._ What means the King?      _Sar._                     To worship your new God     And ancient conqueror. Some wine, I say.                              _Enter Cupbearer_.      _Sar._ (_addressing the Cupbearer_).     Bring me the golden goblet thick with gems,     Which bears the name of Nimrod's chalice. Hence,                   160     Fill full, and bear it quickly.                     [_Exit Cupbearer_.      _Sal._                         Is this moment     A fitting one for the resumption of     Thy yet unslept-off revels?                       _Re-enter Cupbearer, with wine_.      _Sar._ (_taking the cup from him_). Noble kinsman,     If these barbarian Greeks of the far shores     And skirts of these our realms lie not, this Bacchus     Conquered the whole of India,[8] did he not?      _Sal._ He did, and thence was deemed a Deity.[f]      _Sar._ Not so:--of all his conquests a few columns.[9]     Which may be his, and might be mine, if I     Thought them worth purchase and conveyance, are                    170     The landmarks of the seas of gore he shed,     The realms he wasted, and the hearts he broke.     But here--here in this goblet is his title     To immortality--the immortal grape     From which he first expressed the soul, and gave     To gladden that of man, as some atonement     For the victorious mischiefs he had done.     Had it not been for this, he would have been     A mortal still in name as in his grave;     And, like my ancestor Semiramis,                                   180     A sort of semi-glorious human monster.     Here's that which deified him--let it now     Humanise thee; my surly, chiding brother,     Pledge me to the Greek God!      _Sal._                      For all thy realms     I would not so blaspheme our country's creed.      _Sar._ That is to say, thou thinkest him a hero,     That he shed blood by oceans; and no God,     Because he turned a fruit to an enchantment,     Which cheers the sad, revives the old, inspires     The young, makes Weariness forget his toil,                        190     And Fear her danger; opens a new world     When this, the present, palls. Well, then _I_ pledge thee     And _him_ as a true man, who did his utmost     In good or evil to surprise mankind.                        [_Drinks_.      _Sal._ Wilt thou resume a revel at this hour?      _Sar._ And if I did, 'twere better than a trophy,     Being bought without a tear. But that is not     My present purpose: since thou wilt not pledge me,     Continue what thou pleasest.     (_To the Cupbearer_.)       Boy, retire.            [_Exit Cupbearer_.      _Sal._ I would but have recalled thee from thy dream;              200     Better by me awakened than rebellion.      _Sar._ Who should rebel? or why? what cause? pretext?     I am the lawful King, descended from     A race of Kings who knew no predecessors.     What have I done to thee, or to the people,     That thou shouldst rail, or they rise up against me?      _Sal._ Of what thou hast done to me, I speak not.      _Sar._                                             But     Thou think'st that I have wronged the Queen: is't not so?      _Sal._ _Think!_ Thou hast wronged her!      _Sar._                                Patience, Prince, and hear me.     She has all power and splendour of her station,                    210     Respect, the tutelage of Assyria's heirs,     The homage and the appanage of sovereignty.     I married her as monarchs wed--for state,     And loved her as most husbands love their wives.     If she or thou supposedst I could link me     Like a Chaldean peasant to his mate,     Ye knew nor me--nor monarchs--nor mankind.      _Sal._ I pray thee, change the theme: my blood disdains     Complaint, and Salemenes' sister seeks not     Reluctant love even from Assyria's lord!                           220     Nor would she deign to accept divided passion     With foreign strumpets and Ionian slaves.     The Queen is silent.      _Sar._               And why not her brother?      _Sal._ I only echo thee the voice of empires,     Which he who long neglects not long will govern.      _Sar._ The ungrateful and ungracious slaves! they murmur     Because I have not shed their blood, nor led them     To dry into the desert's dust by myriads,     Or whiten with their bones the banks of Ganges;     Nor decimated them with savage laws,                               230     Nor sweated them to build up Pyramids,     Or Babylonian walls.      _Sal._               Yet these are trophies     More worthy of a people and their prince     Than songs, and lutes, and feasts, and concubines,     And lavished treasures, and contemn√©d virtues.      _Sar._ Or for my trophies I have founded cities:     There's Tarsus and Anchialus, both built     In one day--what could that blood-loving beldame,     My martial grandam, chaste Semiramis,     Do more, except destroy them?      _Sal._                        'Tis most true;                      240     I own thy merit in those founded cities,     Built for a whim, recorded with a verse     Which shames both them and thee to coming ages.      _Sar._ Shame me! By Baal, the cities, though well built,     Are not more goodly than the verse! Say what     Thou wilt 'gainst me, my mode of life or rule,     But nothing 'gainst the truth of that brief record.     Why, those few lines contain the history     Of all things human: hear--\"Sardanapalus,     The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes,                                250     In one day built Anchialus and Tarsus.     Eat, drink, and love; the rest's not worth a fillip.\"[10]      _Sal._ A worthy moral, and a wise inscription,     For a king to put up before his subjects!      _Sar._"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],["title","The Works of Lord Byron. Vol. 5 (#4)"],["body",", thou wouldst have me doubtless set up edicts--     \"Obey the king--contribute to his treasure--     Recruit his phalanx--spill your blood at bidding--     Fall down and worship, or get up and toil.\"     Or thus--\"Sardanapalus on this spot     Slew fifty thousand of his enemies.                                260     These are their sepulchres, and this his trophy.\"     I leave such things to conquerors; enough     For me, if I can make my subjects feel     The weight of human misery less, and glide     Ungroaning to the tomb: I take no license     Which I deny to them. We all are men.      _Sal._ Thy Sires have been revered as Gods--      _Sar._                                        In dust     And death, where they are neither Gods nor men.     Talk not of such to me! the worms are Gods;[11]     At least they banqueted upon your Gods,                            270     And died for lack of farther nutriment.     Those Gods were merely men; look to their issue--     I feel a thousand mortal things about me,     But nothing godlike,--unless it may be     The thing which you condemn, a disposition     To love and to be merciful, to pardon     The follies of my species, and (that's human)     To be indulgent to my own.      _Sal._                    Alas!     The doom of Nineveh is sealed.--Woe--woe     To the unrivalled city!      _Sar._                  What dost dread?                           280      _Sal._ Thou art guarded by thy foes: in a few hours     The tempest may break out which overwhelms thee,     And thine and mine; and in another day     What _is_ shall be the past of Belus' race.      _Sar._ What must we dread?      _Sal._                    Ambitious treachery,     Which has environed thee with snares; but yet     There is resource: empower me with thy signet     To quell the machinations, and I lay     The heads of thy chief foes before thy feet.      _Sar._ The heads--how many?      _Sal._                     Must I stay to number             290     When even thine own's in peril? Let me go;     Give me thy signet--trust me with the rest.      _Sar._ I will trust no man with unlimited lives.     When we take those from others, we nor know     What we have taken, nor the thing we give.      _Sal._ Wouldst thou not take their lives who seek for thine?      _Sar._ That's a hard question--But I answer, Yes.     Cannot the thing be done without? Who are they     Whom thou suspectest?--Let them be arrested.      _Sal._ I would thou wouldst not ask me; the next moment            300     Will send my answer through thy babbling troop     Of paramours, and thence fly o'er the palace,     Even to the city, and so baffle all.--     Trust me.      _Sar._      Thou knowest I have done so ever;     Take thou the signet.                             [_Gives the signet_.      _Sal._                I have one more request.      _Sar._ Name it.      _Sal._           That thou this night forbear the banquet     In the pavilion over the Euphrates.      _Sar._ Forbear the banquet! Not for all the plotters     That ever shook a kingdom! Let them come,     And do their worst: I shall not blench for them;                   310     Nor rise the sooner; nor forbear the goblet;     Nor crown me with a single rose the less;     Nor lose one joyous hour.--I fear them not.      _Sal._ But thou wouldst arm thee, wouldst thou not, if needful?      _Sar._ Perhaps. I have the goodliest armour, and     A sword of such a temper, and a bow,     And javelin, which might furnish Nimrod forth:     A little heavy, but yet not unwieldy.     And now I think on't, 'tis long since I've used them,     Even in the chase. Hast ever seen them, brother?                   320      _Sal._ Is this a time for such fantastic trifling?--     If need be, wilt thou wear them?      _Sar._                           Will I not?     Oh! if it must be so, and these rash slaves     Will not be ruled with less, I'll use the sword     Till they shall wish it turned into a distaff.      _Sal._ They say thy Sceptre's turned to that already.      _Sar._ That's false! but let them say so: the old Greeks,     Of whom our captives often sing, related     The same of their chief hero, Hercules,     Because he loved a Lydian queen: thou seest                        330     The populace of all the nations seize     Each calumny they can to sink their sovereigns.      _Sal._ They did not speak thus of thy fathers.      _Sar._                                         No;     They dared not. They were kept to toil and combat;     And never changed their chains but for their armour:     Now they have peace and pastime, and the license     To revel and to rail; it irks me not.     I would not give the smile of one fair girl     For all the popular breath[12] that e'er divided     A name from nothing. What are the rank tongues[13]                 340     Of this vile herd, grown insolent with feeding,     That I should prize their noisy praise, or dread     Their noisome clamour?      _Sal._                You have said they are men;     As such their hearts are something.      _Sar._                             So my dogs' are;     And better, as more faithful:--but, proceed;     Thou hast my signet:--since they are tumultuous,     Let them be tempered, yet not roughly, till     Necessity enforce it. I hate all pain,     Given or received; we have enough within us,     The meanest vassal as the loftiest monarch,                        350     Not to add to each other's natural burthen     Of mortal misery, but rather lessen,     By mild reciprocal alleviation,     The fatal penalties imposed on life:     But this they know not, or they will not know.     I have, by Baal! done all I could to soothe them:     I made no wars, I added no new imposts,     I interfered not with their civic lives,     I let them pass their days as best might suit them,     Passing my own as suited me.      _Sal._                       Thou stopp'st                         360     Short of the duties of a king; and therefore     They say thou art unfit to be a monarch.      _Sar._ They lie.--Unhappily, I am unfit     To be aught save a monarch; else for me     The meanest Mede might be the king instead.      _Sal._ There is one Mede, at least, who seeks to be so.      _Sar._ What mean'st thou!--'tis thy secret; thou desirest     Few questions, and I'm not of curious nature.     Take the fit steps; and, since necessity     Requires, I sanction and support thee. Ne'er                       370     Was man who more desired to rule in peace     The peaceful only: if they rouse me, better     They had conjured up stern Nimrod from his ashes,     \"The Mighty Hunter!\" I will turn these realms     To one wide desert chase of brutes, who _were_,     But _would_ no more, by their own choice, be human.     _What_ they have found me, they belie; _that which_     They yet may find me--shall defy their wish     To speak it worse; and let them thank themselves.      _Sal._ Then thou at last canst feel?      _Sar._                              Feel! who feels not            380     Ingratitude?[14]      _Sal._      I will not pause to answer     With words, but deeds. Keep thou awake that energy     Which sleeps at times, but is not dead within thee,     And thou may'st yet be glorious in thy reign,     As powerful in thy realm. Farewell!                 [_Exit_ SALEMENES.      _Sar._ (_solus_).                 Farewell!     He's gone; and on his finger bears my signet,     Which is to him a sceptre. He is stern     As I am heedless; and the slaves deserve     To feel a master. What may be the danger,     I know not: he hath found it, let him quell it.                    390     Must I consume my life--this little life--     In guarding against all may make it less?     It is not worth so much! It were to die     Before my hour, to live in dread of death,     Tracing revolt; suspecting all about me,     Because they are near; and all who are remote,     Because they are far. But if it should be so--     If they should sweep me off from Earth and Empire,     Why, what is Earth or Empire of the Earth?     I have loved, and lived, and multiplied my image;                  400     To die is no less natural than those     Acts of this clay! 'Tis true I have not shed     Blood as I might have done, in oceans, till     My name became the synonyme of Death--     A terror and a trophy. But for this     I feel no penitence; my life is love:     If I must shed blood, it shall be by force.     Till now, no drop from an Assyrian vein     Hath flowed for me, nor hath the smallest coin     Of Nineveh's vast treasures e'er been lavished                     410     On objects which could cost her sons a tear:     If then they hate me, 'tis because I hate not:     If they rebel, 'tis because I oppress not.     Oh, men! ye must be ruled with scythes, not sceptres,     And mowed down like the grass, else all we reap     Is rank abundance, and a rotten harvest     Of discontents infecting the fair soil,     Making a desert of fertility.--     I'll think no more.--Within there, ho!                            _Enter an_ ATTENDANT.      _Sar._                                Slave, tell     The Ionian Myrrha we would crave her presence.                     420      _Attend._ King, she is here.                               MYRRHA _enters_.      _Sar._ (_apart to Attendant_). Away!      (_Addressing_ MYRRHA.)              Beautiful being!     Thou dost almost anticipate my heart;     It throbbed for thee, and here thou comest: let me     Deem that some unknown influence, some sweet oracle,     Communicates between us, though unseen,     In absence, and attracts us to each other.      _Myr._ There doth.      _Sar._             I know there doth, but not its name:     What is it?      _Myr._       In my native land a God,     And in my heart a feeling like a God's,     Exalted; yet I own 'tis only mortal;                              "]]]
