It was evident that in the circle of the camp-fire there was more than one pair of lips ready to narrate some similar adventure, but the hour was late, and all agreed it would be better to go to rest.  On to-morrow night, some other would take their turn; and, in fact, a regular agreement was entered into that each one of the party who had at any period of his life been the hero or participator in any hunting adventure should narrate the same for the entertainment of the others. This would bring out a regular \"round of stories by the camp-fire,\" and would enable us to kill the many long evenings we had to pass before coming up with the buffalo.  The conditions were, that the stories should exclusively relate to birds or animals--in fact, any hunted game belonging to the _fauna_ of the American Continent: furthermore, that each should contribute his _quota_ of information about whatever animal should chance to be the subject of the narration--about its habits, its geographical range; in short, its general natural history, as well as the various modes of hunting it, practised in different places by different people.  This, it was alleged, would render our camp conversation instructive as well as entertaining.  The idea originated with the old hunter-naturalist, who very wisely reasoned that among so many gentlemen of large hunting experience he might collect new facts for his favourite science--for to just such men, and not to the closet-dreamer, is natural history indebted for its most interesting chapters.  Of course every one of us, guides and all, warmly applauded the proposal, for there was no one among us averse to receiving a little knowledge of so entertaining a character.  No doubt to the naturalist himself we should be indebted for most part of it; and his mode of communicating was so pleasant, that even the rude trappers listened to him with wonder and attention.  They saw that he was no \"greenhorn\" either in woodcraft or prairie knowledge, and that was a sufficient claim to their consideration.  There is no character less esteemed by the regular \"mountain-man\" than a \"greenhorn,\"--that is, one who is new to the ways of their wilderness life.  With the design of an early start, we once more crept into our several quarters, and went to sleep.    CHAPTER FOUR.  THE PASSENGER-PIGEONS.  After an early breakfast we lit our pipes and cigars, and took to the road.  The sun was very bright, and in less than two hours after starting we were sweltering under a heat almost tropical.  It was one of those autumn days peculiar to America, where even a high latitude seems to be no protection against the sun, and his beams fall upon one with as much fervour as they would under the line itself.  The first part of our journey was through open woods of black-jack, whose stunted forms afforded no shade, but only shut off the breeze which might otherwise have fanned us.  While fording a shallow stream, the doctor's scraggy, ill-tempered horse took a fit of kicking quite frantical.  For some time it seemed likely that either the doctor himself, or his saddle-bags, would be deposited in the bottom of the creek, but after a severe spell of whipping and kicking on the part of the rider, the animal moved on again.  What had set it dancing?  That was the question.  It had the disposition to be \"frisky,\" but usually appeared to be lacking in strength.  The buzz of a horse-fly sounding in our ears explained all.  It was one of those large insects--the \"horse-bug,\"--peculiar to the Mississippi country, and usually found near watercourses.  They are more terrible to horses than a fierce dog would be.  I have known horses gallop away from them as if pursued by a beast of prey.  There is a belief among western people that these insects are propagated by the horses themselves; that is, that the eggs of the female are deposited upon the grass, so that the horses may swallow them; that incubation goes on within the stomach of the animal, and that the chrysalis is afterwards voided.  I have met with others who believed in a still stranger theory; that the insect itself actually sought, and found, a passage into the stomach of the horse, some said by passing down his throat, others by boring a hole through his abdomen; and that in such cases the horse usually sickened, and was in danger of dying!  After the doctor's mustang had returned to proper behaviour, these odd theories became the subject of discussion.  The Kentuckian believed in them--the Englishman doubted them--the hunter-naturalist could not endorse them--and Besancon ignored them entirely.  Shortly after the incident we entered the bottom lands of a considerable stream.  These were heavily-timbered, and the shadow of the great forest trees afforded us a pleasant relief from the hot sun.  Our guides told us we had several miles of such woods to pass through, and we were glad of the information.  We noticed that most of the trees were beech, and their smooth straight trunks rose like columns around us.  The beech (_Fagus sylvatica_) is one of the most beautiful of American forest trees.  Unlike most of the others, its bark is smooth, without fissures, and often of a silvery hue.  Large beech-trees standing by the path, or near a cross road, are often seen covered with names, initials, and dates.  Even the Indian often takes advantage of the bark of a beech-tree to signalise his presence to his friends, or commemorate some savage exploit.  Indeed, the beautiful column-like trunk seems to invite the knife, and many a souvenir is carved upon it by the loitering wayfarer.  It does not, however, invite the axe of the settler.  On the contrary, the beechen woods often remain untouched, while others fall around them--partly because these trees are not usually the indices of the richest soil, but more from the fact that clearing a piece of beech forest is no easy matter.  The green logs do not burn so readily as those of the oak, the elm, the maple, or poplar, and hence the necessity of \"rolling\" them off the ground to be cleared--a serious thing where labour is scarce and dear.  We were riding silently along, when all at once our ears were assailed by a strange noise.  It resembled the clapping of a thousand pairs of hands, followed by a whistling sound, as if a strong wind had set suddenly in among the trees.  We all knew well enough what it meant, and the simultaneous cry of \"pigeons,\" was followed by half a dozen simultaneous cracks from the guns of the party, and several bluish birds fell to the ground.  We had stumbled upon a feeding-place of the passenger-pigeon (_Columba migratoria_).  Our route was immediately abandoned, and in a few minutes we were in the thick of the flock, cracking away at them both with shot-gun and rifle. It was not so easy, however, to bring them down in any considerable numbers.  In following them up we soon strayed from each other, until our party was completely scattered, and nearly two hours elapsed before we got back to the road.  Our game-bag, however, made a fine show, and about forty brace were deposited in the waggon.  With the anticipation of roast pigeon and \"pot-pie,\" we rode on more cheerily to our night-camp.  All along the route the pigeons were seen, and occasionally large flocks whirled over our heads under the canopy of the trees. Satiated with the sport, and not caring to waste our ammunition, we did not heed them farther.  In order to give Lanty due time for the duties of the _cuisine_, we halted a little earlier than usual.  Our day's march had been a short one, but the excitement and sport of the pigeon-hunt repaid us for the loss of time.  Our dinner-supper--for it was a combination of both--was the dish known in America as \"pot-pie,\" in which the principal ingredients were the pigeons, some soft flour paste, with a few slices of bacon to give it a flavour.  Properly speaking, the \"pot-pie\" is not a pie, but a stew.  Ours was excellent, and as our appetites wore in a similar condition, a goodly quantity was used up in appeasing them.  Of course the conversation of the evening was the \"wild pigeon of America,\" and the following facts regarding its natural history-- although many of them are by no means new--may prove interesting to the reader, as they did to those who listened to the relation of them around our camp-fire.  The \"passenger\" is less in size than the house pigeon.  In the air it looks not unlike the kite, wanting the forked or \"swallow\" tail.  That of the pigeon is cuneiform.  Its colour is best described by calling it a nearly uniform slate.  In the male the colours are deeper, and the neck-feathers present the same changeable hues of green, gold, and purple-crimson, generally observed in birds of this species.  It is only in the woods, and when freshly caught or killed, that these brilliant tints can be seen to perfection.  They fade in captivity, and immediately after the bird has been shot.  They seem to form part of its life and liberty, and disappear when it is robbed of either.  I have often thrust the wild pigeon, freshly killed, into my game-bag, glittering like an opal.  I have drawn it forth a few hours after of a dull leaden hue, and altogether unlike the same bird.  As with all birds of this tribe, the female is inferior to the male, both in size and plumage.  The eye is less vivid.  In the male it is of the most brilliant fiery orange, inclosed in a well-defined circle of red.  The eye is in truth its finest feature, and never fails to strike the beholder with admiration.  The most singular fact in the natural history of the \"passenger,\" is their countless numbers.  Audubon saw a flock that contained \"one billion one hundred and sixteen millions of birds!\"  Wilson counted, or rather computed, another flock of \"two thousand two hundred and thirty millions!\"  These numbers seem incredible.  I have no doubt of their truth.  I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],["title","The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#7)"],["body","no doubt that they are _under_ rather than _over_ the numbers actually seen by both these naturalists, for both made most liberal allowances in their calculations.  Where do these immense flocks come from?  The wild pigeons breed in all parts of America.  Their breeding-places are found as far north as the Hudson's Bay, and they have been seen in the southern forests of Louisiana and Texas.  The nests are built upon high trees, and resemble immense rookeries.  In Kentucky, one of their breeding-places was forty miles in length, by several in breadth!  One hundred nests will often be found upon a single tree, and in each nest there is but one \"squab.\"  The eggs are pure white, like those of the common kind, and, like them, they breed several times during the year, but principally when food is plenty.  They establish themselves in great \"roosts,\" sometimes for years together, to which each night they return from their distant excursions--hundreds of miles, perhaps; for this is but a short fly for travellers who can pass over a mile in a single minute, and some of whom have even strayed across the Atlantic to England!  They, however, as I myself have observed, remain in the same woods where they have been feeding for several days together.  I have also noticed that they prefer roosting in the low underwood, even when tall trees are close at hand.  If near water, or hanging over a stream, the place is still more to their liking; and in the morning they may be seen alighting on the bank to drink, before taking to their daily occupation.  The great \"roosts\" and breeding-places are favourite resorts for numerous birds of prey.  The small vultures (_Cathartes aura_ and _Atratus_), or, as they are called in the west, \"turkey buzzard,\" and \"carrion crow,\" do not confine themselves to carrion alone.  They are fond of live \"squabs,\" which they drag out of their nests at pleasure. Numerous hawks and kites prey upon them; and even the great white-headed eagle (_Falco leucocephalus_) may be seen soaring above, and occasionally swooping down for a dainty morsel.  On the ground beneath move enemies of a different kind, both biped and quadruped.  Fowlers with their guns and long poles; farmers with waggons to carry off the dead birds; and even droves of hogs to devour them.  Trees fall under the axe, and huge branches break down by the weight of the birds themselves, killing numbers in their descent.  Torches are used--for it is usually a night scene, after the return of the birds from feeding,-- pots of burning sulphur, and other engines of destruction.  A noisy scene it is.  The clapping of a million pair of wings, like the roaring of thunder; the shots; the shouts; men hoarsely calling to each other; women and children screaming their delight; the barking of dogs; the neighing of horses; the \"crashes\" of breaking branches; and the \"chuck\" of the woodman's axe, all mingled together.  When the men--saturated with slaughter, and white with ordure--have retired beyond the borders of the roost to rest themselves for the night, their ground is occupied by the prowling wolf and the fox; the racoon and the cougar; the lynx and the great black bear.  With so many enemies, one would think that the \"passengers\" would soon be exterminated.  Not so.  They are too prolific for that.  Indeed, were it not for these enemies, they themselves would perish for want of food. Fancy what it takes to feed them!  The flock seen by Wilson would require eighteen million bushels of grain every day!--and it, most likely, was only one of many such that at the time were traversing the vast continent of America.  Upon what do they feed? it will be asked. Upon the fruits of the great forest--upon the acorns, the nuts of the beech, upon buck-wheat, and Indian corn; upon many species of berries, such as the huckleberry (_whortleberry_), the hackberry (_Celtis crassifolia_), and the fruit of the holly.  In the northern regions, where these are scarce, the berries of the juniper tree (_Juniperus communis_) form the principal food.  On the other hand, among the southern plantations, they devour greedily the rice, as well as the nuts of the chestnut-tree and several species of oaks.  But their staple food is the beech-nut, or \"mast,\" as it is called.  Of this the pigeons are fond, and fortunately it exists in great plenty.  In the forests of Western America there are vast tracts covered almost entirely with the beech-tree.  As already stated, these beechen forests of America remain almost intact, and so long as they shower down their millions of bushels of \"mast,\" so long will the passenger-pigeons flutter in countless numbers amidst their branches.  Their migration is semi-annual; but unlike most other migratory birds, it is far from being regular.  Their flight is, in fact, not a periodical migration, but a sort of nomadic existence--food being the object which keeps them in motion and directs their course.  The scarcity in one part determines their movement to another.  When there is more than the usual fall of snow in the northern regions, vast flocks make their appearance in the middle States, as in Ohio and Kentucky. This may in some measure account for the overcrowded \"roosts\" which have been occasionally seen, but which are by no means common.  You may live in the west for many years without witnessing a scene such as those described by Wilson and Audubon, though once or twice every year you may see pigeons enough to astonish you.  It must not be imagined that the wild pigeons of America are so \"tame\" as they have been sometimes represented.  That is their character only while young at the breeding-places, or at the great roosts when confused by crowding upon each other, and mystified by torch-light.  Far different are they when wandering through the open woods in search of food.  It is then both difficult to approach and hard to kill them. Odd birds you may easily reach; you may see them perched upon the branches on all sides of you, and within shot-range; but the _thick_ of the flock, somehow or other, always keeps from one to two hundred yards off.  The sportsman cannot bring himself to fire at single birds.  No. There is a tree near at hand literally black with pigeons.  Its branches creak under the weight.  What a fine havoc he will make if he can but get near enough!  But that is the difficulty; there is no cover, and he must approach as he best can without it.  He continues to advance; the birds sit silent, watching his movements.  He treads lightly and with caution; he inwardly anathematises the dead leaves and twigs that make a loud rustling under his feet.  The birds appear restless; several stretch out their necks as if to spring off.  At length he deems himself fairly within range, and raises his gun to take aim; but this is a signal for the shy game, and before he can draw trigger they are off to another tree!  Some stragglers still remain; and at them he levels his piece and fires. The shot is a random one; for our sportsman, having failed to \"cover\" the flock, has become irritated and careless, and in all such cases the pigeons fly off with the loss of a few feathers.  The gun is reloaded, and our amateur hunter, seeing the thick flock upon another tree, again endeavours to approach it, but with like success.    CHAPTER FIVE.  HUNT WITH A HOWITZER.  When the conversation about the haunts and habits of these birds began to flag, some one called for a \"pigeon story.\"  Who could tell a pigeon story?  To our surprise the doctor volunteered one, and all gathered around to listen.  \"Yes, gentlemen,\" began the doctor, \"I have a pigeon adventure, which occurred to me some years ago.  I was then living in Cincinnati, following my respectable calling, when I had the good fortune to set a broken leg for one Colonel P--, a wealthy planter, who lived upon the bank of the river some sixty miles from the city.  I made a handsome set of if, and won the colonel's friendship for ever.  Shortly after, I was invited to his house, to be present at a great pigeon-hunt which was to come off in the fall.  The colonel's plantation stood among beech woods, and he had therefore an annual visitation of the pigeons, and could tell almost to a day when they would appear.  The hunt he had arranged for the gratification of his numerous friends.  \"As you all know, gentlemen, sixty miles in our western travel is a mere bagatelle; and tired of pills and prescriptions, I flung myself into a boat, and in a few hours arrived at the colonel's stately home.  A word or two about this stately home and its proprietor.  \"Colonel P-- was a splendid specimen of the backwoods' gentleman--you will admit there _are_ gentlemen in the backwoods.\"  (Here the doctor glanced good-humouredly, first at our English friend Thompson, and then at the Kentuckian, both of whom answered him with a laugh.) \"His house was the type of a backwoods mansion; a wooden structure, both walls and roof.  No matter.  It has distributed as much hospitality in its time as many a marble palace; that was one of its backwoods' characteristics. It stood, and I hope still stands, upon the north bank of the Ohio--that beautiful stream--`_La belle riviere_,' as the French colonists, and before their time the Indians, used to call it.  It was in the midst of the woods, though around it were a thousand acres of `clearing,' where you might distinguish fields of golden wheat, and groves of shining maize plants waving aloft their yellow-flower tassels.  You might note, too, the broad green leaf of the Nicotian `weed,' or the bursting pod of the snow-white cotton.  In the garden you might observe the sweet potato, the common one, the refreshing tomato, the huge water-melon, cantelopes, and musk melons, with many other delicious vegetables.  You could see pods of red and green pepper growing upon trailing plants; and beside them several species of peas and beans--all valuable for the colonel's _cuisine_.  There was an orchard,"]]]
