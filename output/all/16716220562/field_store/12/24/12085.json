It's a little tenement house off Minton Street. Maybe you never were there.\"  \"I guess I never was,\" the man replied simply.  \"It's a nice place to live,\" continued Carl, glowing with local pride. \"Of course it isn't like this. We've no trees. But in winter trees aren't much good anyway; and in summer we can go to the parks.\"  To this philosophic observation his companion agreed with a nod and they sped on in silence.  The vast stretches of snow, so unsightly in the city's narrow thoroughfares, were on every hand white and sparkling, and each little shrub rearing its head out of the spangled fields was laden with ermine.  The boy drew a long breath, drinking in the crystal air.  \"Gee!\" he burst out impulsively. \"This is great. I feel cheered up already.\"  The man driving the car shot him a quiet smile.  \"I'm glad to hear that,\" said he. \"So you were out of spirits, were you?\"  \"I was fussed within an inch of my life,\" owned Carl with engaging candor.  \"In wrong somewhere?\"  \"Oh, I'm not; but my chum is.\"  \"What's the matter?\"  \"Why, you see his sister has just been fired from Davis and Coulter's mills. It wasn't her fault at all, either. Her brother gave the foreman, Corcoran, a jawing because he got too fresh with one of the girls. Corcoran didn't say a word at the time but a couple of weeks later he took out his spite on Hal Harling's sister, Louise. I suppose he was mad and decided on this way to get even.\"  \"Humph!\"  \"Maybe he thought he'd take Hal's pride down and make him come crawling to him on his knees to get Louise back into the mills. It is a rotten time to be out of work. Louise has tried and tried to get another job and can't land a thing. But whether she does or not, her brother isn't going crawling to Corcoran. He's not afraid of the old tyrant. Hal Harling isn't afraid of anything. Why, only the other day he tore into the street and saved a little runaway chap from being mashed to jelly under a lot of automobiles. The baby was chasing a dog and got into the middle of High Street before he realized it. He would certainly have been killed had it not been for Hal.\"  \"Whose baby was it?\" questioned the man beside him in an odd voice.  \"Oh, I don't know. We didn't wait to see. Hal was anxious to get out of the crowd and we were late home anyway. So Harling gave the kid to the nursemaid and lit out.\"  There was a muffled: \"I see!\" from his listener.  \"And where do you come in in all this tangle?\" queried the stranger presently.  \"I? Why, you see Hal Harling is my----\" a sudden reserve fell upon the lad. It was impossible to explain to anybody just what Hal Harling was to him. \"I chase round with the Harlings a lot,\" explained he. \"They are almost like my own family.\"  \"Oh, so that's it!\"  \"I'd decided just now to hunt for a job and see if I couldn't make good the money Louise is missing. She can't seem to find a darn thing to do, poor kid. She's been out of work over a week now and they've got to have money or Mrs. Harling and Grandfather Harling will starve to death. Of course I'm not so much,\" continued Carl modestly. \"But I'm willing to work and I'm sure I could earn something.\"  The owner of the velvet-wheeled car did not speak at once. Then he remarked abruptly:  \"You don't go to school to-morrow, do you?\"  \"Saturday? Not on your--no, sir.\"  \"Then you'd be free to come to my office to-morrow morning and see me, wouldn't you?\"  \"Do you think you could give me a job? Sure I'd come!\" ejaculated Carl with zest.  \"Good! Come to the Berwick building, Number 197 Dalby Street, to-morrow at ten o'clock. Give your name and--by the by, what is your name?\"  \"Carl McGregor, sir.\"  \"A fine old Scotch name. Well, you write it on a card or a piece of paper and give it to the man you will find at the door. Maybe I shall be able to do something for you.\"  The car rolled up to the curb and stopped.  \"You've been mighty kind, sir,\" said Carl, as he leaped out. \"You've brought me nearly home.\"  \"Oh, I was going this way anyway,\" smiled the man in the fur coat. \"You won't have far to walk now, will you?\"  \"Only a block. I'll be home in a jiffy.\"  \"You won't forget about to-morrow.\"  \"_Forget!_\"  Laughing at something that evidently amused him very much the stranger started his engine.  As for Carl, he raced home as fast as ever his feet would go. Already he was late for supper, a fact always annoying to his mother, who considered tardiness one of the most flagrant of sins. To be sure he was not often late, for miss what other functions he might he seldom missed his meals. To-night, however, the table had been cleared, the dishes washed, and only a saucepan of corn-meal mush, steaming on the back of the stove, remained as a souvenir of the feast.  \"For goodness' sake, Carl, wherever have you been?\" asked Mrs. McGregor, as he entered, panting from his run up the long flights of stairs. \"I've been worried to death about you. Go wash your hands and come and eat your supper right away. You know I don't like you out after dark.\"  \"I know it, Ma,\" the boy responded penitently. \"I'm mighty sorry. I'd no idea, though, that it was so late.\"  \"Where've you been?\"  \"To walk.\"  \"To walk? Just to walk? Mercy on us! Not just walking round for nothing!\"  \"I'm afraid so, yes.\"  \"Who was with you?\"  \"Nobody.\"  For an instant Mrs. McGregor looked searchingly at her son.  \"Well, did you ever hear the like of that!\" commented she, addressing the younger children who clustered about their brother with curiosity. \"What set you to go walking?\"  \"I don't know, Ma. Just a freak, I guess.\"  \"A foolish freak--worrying the whole family, delaying supper, and what not. Now come and eat your porridge without more delay. Mary, go bring the milk; and, Timmie, you fetch a clean saucer from the pantry. Martin, stop pestering your brother until he eats something; he'll play with you and Nell by and by. Such a noisy lot of bairns as you are! If you're not careful you'll wake James Frederick.\"  Nevertheless, in spite of her grumbling, the mother regarded her brood of clamoring youngsters with affectionate pride. They were indeed a husky group, red-cheeked, high-spirited, and happy; their chatter, as she well knew, was nothing more than the normal exuberance of childhood.  While Carl hungrily devoured his big bowlful of cereal his mother continued her sewing. She was working on a film of blue material a-glitter with silver beads that twinkled from its folds like stars. Every now and then little Nell, fascinated by the sparkle of the fabric, would start toward the corner where her mother sat in the ring of brilliant lamplight.  Instantly one of the older brothers or sisters would intercept the child, catching up the wriggling mite and explaining softly:  \"No, dearie, no! Nell must not trouble mother. Mother's working.\"  It was an old, oft-repeated formula which every one of the little group had heard from the time he had been able to toddle. Familiar, too, was the picture of their mother seated in the circle of light, her basket of gayly hued spools beside her, and a cloud of shimmering splendor wreathing her feet. Sometimes this glory was pink; sometimes it was blue, lavender, or yellow; not infrequently it was black or a smoky mist of gray. The children always delighted in the brighter colors, crowding round with eagerness whenever a new gown was brought home to see what hue the exciting parcel might contain.  \"Oh, nothing but a sleepy old gray one this time!\" Timmie would bewail. \"And gray beads, too! Do hurry up, Ma, and get it done so we can have something else.\"  But let the paper disclose a brilliant blue or a red tulle and instantly every child clapped his hands.  Exultantly they examined the scintillating jet or iridescent sequins.  \"Oh, this is the best yet, Ma!\" Carl would cry. \"It's a peach of a dress.\"  Their ingenious admiration did much to transform their mother's tedious task into a fine art and helped her to regard it with dignity. Certainly its influence on the characters of her children was inestimable. Not alone did it answer their craving for beauty, but far better than this Ã¦sthetic gratification was the education it gave them in thoughtfulness and unselfishness. Consideration for their mother, restraint, independence, all emerged out of the yards of foolish gauze and the frivolous spangles.  Therefore Mrs. McGregor sewed on serene in spirit and if, as to-night, her task barred her from secrets her children might amid greater leisure have bestowed on her, the circumstance was accepted as one of the unavoidable disadvantages attending constant occupation.  It was regrettable she had not more time to talk with her sons and daughters separately. Confidences were shy and volatile things that could not be delivered in a hurry or hastily fitted into the chinks of a busy day. Confidences depended on mood and could not be regulated so that they would be forthcoming in the few seconds snatched between one duty and another.  As a result it came about that after Carl had swallowed his supper, frolicked with the younger children and helped Mary put them to bed, brought in the kindlings and coal for the morning fire, it was time for him to tumble in between the sheets himself, and he did so without mentioning to his mother or any one else his adventures of the afternoon or his morrow's appointment with the stranger.  One does not always wish to relate his affairs before five small brothers and sisters whose little ears drink in the story and whose tiny tongues are liable artlessly to repeat it.  In the McGregor household there was affection and happiness; but, alas, there was no such thing as privacy.     CHAPTER V  A TANGLE OF SURPRISES   Morning, to which Carl had looked forward for a moment with his mother, brought, alas, even more meager opportunity for imparting secrets than had the night before, for as was the custom of the McGregor family the new day was launched amid a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23560"],["title","Carl and the Cotton Gin (#8)"],["body","of confusion. Hence it came about that although Carl made several valiant attempts to waylay his mother in the pantry, or corral her in her room, he was each time thwarted and was never able to get beyond a vague introduction to the topic so near his heart. At length a multitudinous list of errands to the butcher, grocer, and baker was handed him and there was no alternative but catch up his hat and coat and speed forth upon these commissions. And no sooner were they all fulfilled than the hour for his appointment with the stranger arrived and, palpitating with the interest of his mission, he set forth to the address to which he had been directed.  It was in the down-town part of the village and so busy was he dodging trucks and hurrying pedestrians that he paid scant heed to anything but the gilt numbers that dotted the street. In and out the crowd he wove his way until above a doorway the magic characters he sought stared at him.  There may have been, and probably were, signs announcing the nature of the business in which this mysterious friend was engaged but if so Carl was blind to them. All that concerned him was to find the place that sheltered his remarkable acquaintance and ascertain the sequel of the day before.  Therefore he walked timidly into the hallway and seeing at the other end of it an oaken door panelled with ground glass that bore the hieroglyphics of his quest he turned the heavy brass knob and walked in.  The room was spacious and its rich furnishings and atmosphere of stillness were in such marked contrast to the hubbub of the street that he paused on the heavy rug, abashed. There was, however, no time for retreat even had his courage failed him for the door behind him had no sooner clicked together than a boy in a gray uniform came forward. As he approached his eye swept with disapproval the shabby visitor and he said, with an edge of sharpness crisping his tone:  \"What can I do for you?\"  \"I want to see a--a--gentleman,\" stammered Carl. \"I don't know his name. I forgot to ask it. But he told me to come to this number to-day at ten o'clock and give him my name on a piece of paper. I've got it here somewheres.\"  Awkwardly he searched his pockets, the waiting messenger watching his every movement.  It was a grimy morsel of parchment that was at length produced; but the instant the supercilious page read the name scrawled upon it his attitude changed from superiority to servility.  \"This way, sir, if you please,\" said he, wheeling about.  Carl followed his guide, feeling, as he tagged across the silencing rug, deplorably small, and painfully conscious of both his hands and feet. He and his conductor passed through another door, threaded labyrinthian aisles flanked by gaping clerks and faintly smiling stenographers, and came at length to a third door which the youth preceding him opened with a flourish.  \"Mr. Carl McGregor,\" announced he in a stentorian tone.  All the blood in Carl's body rushed to his face.  The room before him was small and on its warmly tinted walls a few pictures, some of which his school training led him to recognize as Rembrandt reproductions, lent charm and interest to the interior. But these details were of minor importance compared to the thrill he experienced at discovering behind a great mahogany desk the mysterious stranger of his motoring adventure.  Yes, it was he--there could be no question about that. And yet, now that his hat and heavy fur coat were removed he appeared surprisingly slender and youthful. His eyes, too, seemed bluer, his cheeks redder, and his mouth more smiling.  \"Well, shaver, you're prompt,\" announced he, pointing to the clock with evident satisfaction.  \"You said ten, sir.\"  \"So I did. Nevertheless, I often say ten and get quarter past ten or even eleven o'clock. Sit down.\"  He motioned toward a huge leather chair at his elbow and slipping into it the boy perched with anticipation on its forward edge.  \"Well, what about that Miss Harling we were talking of yesterday? Has she a position yet?\"  \"Since last night, you mean? I don't know, sir. I haven't seen any of the Harlings to-day. But I hardly think so.\"  The stranger pursed his lips.  \"Too bad! Too bad!\" he murmured. \"And you are still for helping the family out by taking a job, are you?\"  \"If I can get one; yes, sir.\"  \"Just what kind of work had you in mind?\"  \"Why--I--I--hadn't thought about it.\"  \"I suppose you go to school.\"  \"Yes, sir. That's the dickens of it. My mother makes me. I'd a great deal rather go into Davis and Coulter's cotton mills. Lots of boys and girls my age do go there, and that is where my father worked before he died. But Ma is hot on education. She says I've got to have one, and she insists on sewing at home on all sorts of fool flummeries for some dressmaker so I can. It's rotten of me not to be more pleased about it, I suppose.\"  While Carl fumbled with his cap the man at the desk tilted back in his chair, regarding him narrowly.  \"Your school work can't leave you very much time for anything else,\" remarked he.  \"Oh, yes, it does,\" the lad hastened to retort. \"I have Saturdays and--and--spare hours at night. I'd even work Sundays if there was anything I could do.\"  \"At that rate I am afraid you would not find much time for skating or baseball. People have to have fresh air and exercise, you know, to keep well.\"  \"I don't have to play,\" protested Carl with great earnestness. \"Anyhow I get heaps of exercise and fresh air doing errands. Besides, we live up five flights.\"  His listener turned aside his head.  \"If it comes to exercise I get all I want right at home,\" persisted the boy. \"I've a crew of little brothers and sisters, too, and when I'm not busy I help take care of them so Ma can sew. Just you try doing it once if you are looking for exercise. And then I wheel the baby out.\"  There was a twinkle in the eye of the man at the desk but he said gravely:  \"Isn't it going to bother them at home if you take a position? How does your mother feel about it?\"  \"I haven't had a chance to ask her,\" Carl blurted out with honesty. \"All last evening she was rushing to finish that spangled thing; and this morning she had the kids to dress and I had errands to do. It's awful hard to get a chance to talk to Ma by herself. Some of the children are always clawing at her skirts and bothering her.\"  \"You do believe, though, in talking things over with your mother.\"  \"Sure! We always tell Ma everything if we can get a chance. So does all Mulberry Court, for that matter. Ma's that sort.\"  The stranger toyed with an ivory letter-opener thoughtfully.  \"Now I'll tell you what we'll do,\" began he at last. \"To-day is Saturday, isn't it?\"  Carl nodded.  \"Well, if your friends, the Harlings, are not straightened out by Monday morning I will let you begin a week from to-day as errand boy in this office.\"  \"Bully!\" cried the delighted applicant.  \"If, on the other hand,\" continued the gentleman at the desk, speaking slowly and evenly, and not heeding the interruption, \"Miss Harling finds work and the family do not need your aid, you must agree to put in your free time at home helping your mother as you have been doing in the past. Is that a bargain?\"  \"Y-e-s.\"  \"What's the matter?\"  \"It just seems to me we might as well settle it definitely now that I am to come here next week. To-day is Saturday and I don't believe Louise will find work before Monday morning. Of course she can't do anything about getting a job Sunday.\"  Although there was a perceptible tremor of disappointment in the boy's voice the stranger appeared not to notice it. Rising, he put out his hand with a kindly smile.  \"I am afraid the agreement I have made with you is the best I can do at present,\" said he. \"I will be true to my part of it if you will be true to yours. I promise you that if the Harlings' affairs do not take an upward turn by Monday you shall come to their rescue.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  \"I wouldn't worry any more about this, if I were you, sonny,\" concluded the man. \"Go home and try to be satisfied. I'll keep the place for you, remember. It is Carl McGregor, isn't it, of----\"  \"Mulberry Court--the top flat.\"  \"And did you tell me these friends of yours, the Harlings, lived there too?\"  \"Oh, no, sir! I wish they did. The Harlings are at Number 40 Broad Street. It is the corner house. They took the tenement because there was sun, and because it entertains Grandfather and Mrs. Harling to look out the window. They can't ever go out and it cheers them up to have something to see. It costs more to live there than where we do, but Hal and Louise decided it was worth it.\"  \"Under the circumstances I imagine it is,\" assented the stranger. \"Well, we will wish them luck.\"  \"I hope they have it!\"  \"So do I.\" As he spoke the man pressed a bell in answer to which the uniformed page appeared.  \"Show this young gentleman out, Billie,\" said he. \"Good-by, youngster! Good-by!\"  The farewell was cordial and in its cadence rang so disconcerting a finality that try as he might Carl could not repress a conviction that in spite of his suave promises his new-found friend did not really expect to see him again.  \"I guess there are folks like that,\" meditated he, as he walked dispiritedly home. \"They are awful pleasant to your face and give you the feeling they are going to do wonders for you. But when it comes to the scratch they slide from under. This chap is one of that slick bunch, I'll bet a hat.\"  It was not a cheering reflection and with every step lower and lower ebbed his hopes. It chanced that his pathway to Mulberry Court led past the corner of Broad Street (or if it did not really lead him there his subconscious mind did) and once in the vicinity what more natural than that he should drop in at Number 40 to pass the time of day? Grandfather Harling loved to have visitors. He said they cheered him up.  But to-day neither the old gentleman nor any of the Harling family needed cheering. Carl found them in such high"]]]
