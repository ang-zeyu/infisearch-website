She had tried to raise it herself, but the pressure from the outside was so strong that the friction prevented.  [Illustration: \"Pull the string, and the door will open.\"]  \"There!\" said the little girl; \"all you've got to do is to pull the string, and the door will open.\"  When the Indian saw the head of the string groping its way through the little hole in the door like a tiny serpent, he grasped the end, and gave it such a smart jerk that the latch flew up.  But, fortunately, it was necessary to do more than draw the latch to open the door. The massive bar was in place, and the Sioux, most likely with a suspicion of the truth, made no effort to force the structure.  But while he was thus employed Red Feather had slipped from the back of his pony and approached the house. He took the side opposite to that from which Melville was looking forth, so that the youth did not notice his action. He saw the idleness of trying to make his way through the door, and formed another plan.  With little effort he raised the sash in the narrow window on the right. About half-way to the top was a wooden button to hold the lower sash in place when raised. The occupants of the house used no care in securing the windows, since, as I have explained, they were too narrow to allow any person, unless very thin of figure, to force his way through them.  Red Feather seemed to forget that he had tried to take the life of one of the white persons only a few minutes before; but, since no return shot had come from within the building, he must have concluded the defenders were panic-stricken, or else he showed a daring that amounted to recklessness; for, after raising the sash, he pushed the curtain aside, and began carefully shoving his head through the opening.  Now, the house being of logs, it was necessary for the chieftain to force his shoulders a slight distance to allow his head fairly to enter the room. This required great care and labor, and more risk on the part of the Sioux than he suspected--since he should have known that it is easier to advance under such circumstances than to retreat, and, inasmuch as it was so hard to push on, it was likely to be still harder to retreat.  Dot Clarendon, like her brother, was so interested in another direction that she failed for the time to note that which was of far more importance.  But the feeling that she and her brother were in a situation of great danger became so strong that she felt there was only One who could save them, and, just as she had been taught from earliest infancy, she now asked that One to take care of them.  Sinking on her chubby knees, she folded her hands, shut her eyes and poured out the simple prayer of faith and love to Him whose ear is never closed to the appeal of the most helpless. Her eyes were still closed, and her lips moving, when the noise made by Red Feather in forcing himself through the narrow opening caused her to stop suddenly and look around.  The sight which met her gaze was enough to startle the bravest man. The head and shoulders of a hideous Sioux warrior were within six feet of where she was kneeling. The Indian was still struggling but he could get no farther, and, as it was, he was wedged very closely.  It must have caused strange feelings in the heart of the wicked savage when he observed the tiny figure kneeling on the floor, with clasped hands, closed eyes, upturned face, and murmuring lips. It is hard to think there could be any one untouched by the sight, though Red Feather gave no sign of such emotion at the time.  The face of the Sioux was not painted, though it is the fashion of his people to do so when upon the war-trail. It could not have looked more frightful had it been daubed with streaks and spots, and Dot was terrified. Springing to her feet, she recoiled with a gasp, and stared at the dreadful countenance.  Red Feather beckoned as best he could for the little one to come nigh him.  It was at this juncture that Dot uttered the cry which brought Melville in such haste from the room above. He rushed down, loaded gun in hand, and it is stating the matter mildly to say that he effected a change in the situation. Startled by the sound of the steps on the stairs, Red Feather glanced up and saw the lad, his face white with anger, and a very dangerous-looking rifle in his hand.  \"I'll teach you manners!\" called out Melville, halting on reaching the floor, and bringing his weapon to a level; \"such a rogue as you ain't fit to live.\"  [Illustration: \"Poured out the simple prayer of faith and love.\"]  As you may suppose, Red Feather was satisfied that the best thing for him to do was to leave that place as quickly as he knew how. He began struggling fiercely to back out, and he must have been surprised when he found he was fast, and that the more he strove to free himself the more firmly he became wedged in.  Seeing his predicament, Melville advanced a couple of steps, holding his weapon so that its muzzle was within arm's length of the terrified visage of the chieftain.  \"I've got you, Red Feather!\" said the exultant youth; \"and the best thing I can do is to shoot you.\"  \"Oh, Mel!\" called Dot, running towards her brother, \"don't hurt him, for that would be wicked.\"  I must do Melville Clarendon the justice to state that he had no intention of shooting the Sioux chieftain who was caught fast in such a curious way. Such an act would have been cruel, though many persons would say it was right, because Red Feather was trying to slay both Melville and his little sister.  But the youth could not help enjoying the strange fix in which the Indian was caught, and he meant to make the best use of it. It is not often that an American Indian loses his wits when in danger, but Red Feather, for a few minutes, was under the control of a feeling such as a soldier shows when stricken by panic.  Had he kept cool, and carefully turned and twisted about as required, while slowly drawing backward, he could have released himself from the snare without trouble; but it was his frantic effort which defeated his own purpose, and forced him to stop, panting and despairing, with his head still within the room, and at the mercy of the youth, who seemed to lower his gun only at the earnest pleading of his little sister.  It was no more than natural that the Sioux should have felt certain that his head and shoulders were beginning to swell, and that, even if the lad spared him, he would never be able to get himself out of the scrape, unless the side of the house should be first taken down.  It was a time to sue for mercy, and the desperate, ugly-tempered Red Feather was prompt to do so. Ceasing his efforts, and turning his face, all aglow with cold perspiration, towards the boy, who had just lowered the muzzle of his gun, he tried to smile, though the expression of his countenance was anything but smiling, and said--  \"Red Feather love white boy--love white girl!\"  It is hard to restrain one's pity for another when in actual distress, and Melville's heart was touched the instant the words were uttered.  \"Sit down in your chair,\" he said gently to Dot, \"and don't disobey me again by leaving it until I tell you.\"  \"But you won't hurt him, will you?\" she pleaded, half obeying, and yet hesitating until she could receive his answer.  Not wishing Red Feather to know his decision, he stooped over and whispered in her ear--  \"No, Dot, I will not hurt him; but don't say anything, for I don't want him to know it just yet.\"  It is more than likely that the distressed Sioux saw enough in the bright face to awaken hope, for he renewed his begging for mercy.  \"Red Feather love white folks--he been bad Injin--he be good Injin now--'cause he love white folks.\"  \"Red Feather,\" said he, lowering his voice so as not to reach the ears of the other Sioux, drawn to the spot by the strange occurrence; \"you do not deserve mercy, for you came to kill me and all my folk. There! don't deny it, for you speak with a double tongue. But _she_ has asked me to spare you, and perhaps I will. If I keep away all harm from you, what will you do for us?\"  \"Love white folks--Red Feather go away--won't hurt--bring game to his brother.\"  Having rested a few minutes, the Sioux began wriggling desperately again, hoping to free himself by sheer strength; but he could not budge his head and shoulders from their vice-like imprisonment, and something like despair must have settled over him when all doubt that he was swelling fast was removed.  It was at the same instant that two of the warriors on the outside, seeing the hapless position of their chief, seized his feet, and began tugging with all their power.  They quickly let go, however; for the impatient sachem delivered such a vigorous kick that both went over backward, with their feet pointed towards the clouds.  \"Red Feather,\" said Melville, standing close enough to the hapless prisoner to touch him with his hand, \"if I help you out of that place and do not hurt you, will you and your warriors go away?\"  The Sioux nodded so vigorously that he struck his chin against the wood hard enough to cause him some pain.  \"Me go away--all Sioux go away--neber come here 'gin--don't hurt nuffin--hurry way.\"  \"And you will not come back to harm us?\"  \"Neber come back--stay way--love white folks.\"  \"I don't believe you will ever love them, and I don't ask you to do so; but you know that my father and mother and I have always treated your people kindly, and they have no reason to hurt us.\"  \"Dat so--dat so--Red Feather love fader, love moder, love son, love pappoose of white folks.\"  \"You see how easy it would be for me to shoot you where you are now without any risk to myself, but I shall not hurt you. I will help to get your head and shoulders loose; but I am afraid that when you mount your horse again and ride out on the prairie you will forget all you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24097"],["title","The Story of Red Feather: A Tale of the American Frontier (#4)"],["body","me.\"  \"Neber, neber, neber!\" replied the chieftain, with all the energy at his command.  [Illustration: \"Oh, Mel!\" called Dot \"don't hurt him.\"--Page 30]  \"You will think that you know enough never to run your head into that window again, and you will want to set fire to the house and tomahawk us.\"  The Sioux looked as if he was deeply pained at this distrust of his honorable intentions, and he seemed at a loss to know what to say to restore himself to the good graces of his youthful master.  \"You are sure you won't forget your promise, Red Feather?\"  \"Red Feather Sioux chief--he neber tell lie--he speak wid single tongue--he love white folks.\"  \"I counted five warriors with you; are they all you have?\"  \"Dey all--hab no more.\"  Melville believed the Indian spoke the truth.  \"Where are the rest?\"  \"Go down oder side Muddy Riber--won't come here.\"  Melville was inclined to credit this statement also. If Red Feather spoke the truth, the rest of his band, numbering fully a score, were twenty miles distant, and were not likely to appear in that part of the country. Such raids as that on which they were engaged must of necessity be pushed hard and fast. Even if the settlers do not instantly rally, the American cavalry are quite sure to follow them, and the Indians have no time to loiter. The rest of the band, if a score of miles away, were likely to have their hands full without riding thus far out of their course.  \"Well,\" said Melville, after a moment's thought, as if still in doubt as to what he ought to do, \"I shall not hurt you--more than that, I will help you to free yourself.\"  He leaned his gun against the table near him, and stepped forward and placed his hands on the head and shoulders of the suffering prisoner.  \"Oogh!\" grunted Red Feather; \"grow bigger--swell up fast--bimeby Red Feather get so big, he die.\"  \"I don't think it is as bad as _that_,\" remarked Melville, unable to repress a smile, \"but it will take some work to get you loose.\"     CHAPTER FOUR  THE CONSULTATION--ON THE ROOF   Melville now examined the fix of the chieftain more closely. His struggles had hurt the skin about his neck and shoulders, and there could be no doubt he was suffering considerably.  Clasping the dusky head with his hands, the youth turned it gently, so that it offered the least possible resistance. Then he asked him to move his shoulder slightly to the left, and, while Melville pushed carefully but strongly, told him to exert himself, not hastily but slowly, and with all the power at his command.  Resting a minute or two, the attempt was renewed and this time Red Feather succeeded in withdrawing for an inch or two, though the effort plainly caused him pain.  \"That's right,\" added Melville, encouragingly; \"we shall succeed--try it again.\"  There was a vigorous scraping, tugging, and pulling, and all at once the head and shoulders vanished through the window. Red Feather was released from the vice.  \"There, I knew you would be all right!\" called the lad through the opening. \"Good-bye, Red Feather.\"  The chief must have been not only confused and bewildered, but chagrined by the exhibition made before the lad and his own warriors, who, had they possessed any sense of humor, would have laughed at the sorry plight of their leader.  Stepping back from the window, so as not to tempt any shot from the other Sioux, all of whom had gathered about the chief, Melville found himself in a dilemma.  \"Shall I take Red Feather at his word?\" he asked himself; \"shall I open the door and walk out with Dot, mount Saladin and gallop off to Barwell, or--wait?\"  There is little doubt, from what followed, that the former would have been the wiser course of the youth. Despite the treacherous character of the Sioux leader, he was so relieved by his release from what he felt at the time was a fatal snare, and by the kindness received from the boy, that his heart was stirred by something akin to gratitude, and he would have restrained his warriors from violence.  Had Melville been alone, he would not have hesitated; but he was irresolute on account of Dot. Looking down in her sweet trustful face, his heart misgave him; he felt that, so long as she was with him, he could assume no risks. He was comparatively safe for a time in the building, while there was no saying what would follow if he should place himself and Dot in the power of Indians that had set out to destroy and slay.  Besides, if Red Feather meant to keep his promise he could do so without involving the brother and sister in the least danger. He had only to ride off with his warriors, when Melville would walk forth, call Saladin to him, mount, and ride away.  \"If he is honest,\" was his decision, \"he will do that; I will wait until they are only a short distance off, and then will gallop to the settlement.\"  \"Come,\" said he, taking the hand of Dot, \"let's go upstairs.\"  \"Why don't you stay down here, Mel?\"  \"Well, I am afraid to leave you alone because you are so apt to forget your promises to me; and since I want to go upstairs I must take you with me.\"  She made no objection, and holding Susie clasped by one arm, she placed the other hand in her brother's, and, side by side, the two walked up the steps to the larger room, occupied by their parents when at home.  \"Now,\" said Melville, speaking with great seriousness, \"you must do just as I tell you, Dot; for it you don't the bad Indians will surely hurt you, and you will never see Susie again.\"  She gave her pledge with such earnestness that he could depend upon her from that time forward.  \"You must not go near the window unless I tell you to do so: the reason for that is that some of the Indians will see you, and they will fire their guns at you. If the bullet does not strike Dot and kill her, it will hit Susie, and that will be the last of _her_. The best thing you can do is to lie down on the bed and rest.\"  Dot obeyed cheerfully, reclining on the couch, with her round plump face against the pillow, where a few minutes later she sank into a sweet sleep. Poor child! little did she dream of what was yet to come.  She was safe so long as she remained thus, since, though a bullet fired through any one of the windows must cross the room, it would pass above the bed, missing her by several feet.  [Illustration: \"The chief and his five followers had re-mounted their ponies.\"--Page 41]  Relieved of all present anxiety concerning her, Melville now gave his attention to Red Feather and his warriors. That which he saw was not calculated to add to his peace of mind.  The chief and his five followers had re-mounted their ponies, and ridden to a point some two hundred yards distant on the prairie, where they halted, as if for consultation.  \"Just what I feared,\" said the youth, feeling it safe to stand before the upper window and watch every movement; \"Red Feather has already begun to repent of his pledge to me, and his warriors are trying to persuade him to break his promise. I don't believe they will find it hard work to change his mind.\"  But whatever was said, it was plain that the Sioux were much in earnest. All were talking, and their arms swung about their heads, and they nodded with a vigor that left no doubt all were taking part in the dispute, and each one meant what he said.  \"Where there is so much wrangling, it looks as if some were in favor of letting us alone,\" thought Melville, who added the next minute--\"I don't know that that follows, for it may be they are quarrelling over the best plan of slaying us, with no thought on the part of any one that they are bound in honor to spare us.\"  By-and-by the ponies, which kept moving uneasily about, took position so that the heads of all were turned fully or partly towards the building, from which the lad was attentively watching their movements.  During these exciting moments Melville did not forget Saladin. The sagacious animal, being no longer troubled by those that were so anxious to steal him, had halted at a distance of an eighth of a mile, where he was eating the grass as though there was nothing unusual in his surroundings.  \"I hope you will be wise enough, old fellow,\" muttered his young master, \"to keep them at a distance; that shot couldn't have hit you, or, if it did, it caused nothing more than a scratch.\"  The horse's wisdom was tested the next minute. One of the warriors withdrew from the group, and began riding at a gallop towards Saladin. As he drew near he brought his pony down to a walk, and evidently hoped to calm the other's fears sufficiently to permit a still closer approach.  Melville's heart throbbed painfully as the distance lessened, and he began to believe he was to lose his priceless animal after all.  \"Why didn't I think of it?\" he asked himself, placing his finger in his mouth, and emitting a shrill whistle that could have been heard a mile distant.  It was a signal with which Saladin was familiar. He instantly raised his head and looked towards the house. As he did so he saw one of his mounted enemies slowly approaching, and within a dozen rods. It was enough, and breaking into a gallop, he quickly ended all hope of his capture by _that_ Sioux brave.  That signal of Melville Clarendon had also been heard by all the Sioux, who must have thought it was due to that alone that the warrior failed to secure the valuable animal. The youth saw the group looking inquiringly at the house, as if to learn from what point the sound came, and the expression on the dark faces was anything but pleasing to him.  He wished to give Red Feather credit for the delay on the part of the Sioux. Their actions showed they were hotly disputing over something, and what more likely than that it was the question of assailing the house and outbuildings?  But there were several facts against this theory. Red Feather held such despotic sway over his followers that it was hard to understand what cause could arise for any dispute with them about the disposal to be made of the brother"]]]
