Malone looked at her. Then he looked at the unbelievably beautiful Miss Wilson. Then he looked at Dr. Harman. And, at last, he looked at Boyd.  \"All right,\" he said. \"I get it. _You're_ Miss Thompson.\"  \"Now, wait a minute, Malone,\" Boyd began.  \"Wait a minute?\" Malone said. \"There are four people here, not counting me. I know I'm not Miss Thompson. I never was, not even as a child. And Dr. Harman isn't, and Miss Wilson isn't, and Whistler's Great-Grandmother isn't, either. So you must be. Unless she isn't here. Or unless she's invisible. Or unless I'm crazy.\"  \"It isn't _you_, Malone,\" Boyd said.  \"What isn't me?\"  \"That's crazy,\" Boyd said.  \"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"I'm not crazy. Then will somebody please tell me--\"  The little old lady cleared her throat. A silence fell. When it was complete she spoke, and her voice was as sweet and kindly as anything Malone had ever heard.  \"You may call me Miss Thompson,\" she said. \"For the present, at any rate. They all do here. It's a pseudonym I have to use.\"  \"A pseudonym?\" Malone said.  \"You see, Mr. Malone,\" Miss Wilson began.  Malone stopped her. \"Don't talk,\" he said. \"I have to concentrate and if you talk I can barely think.\" He took off his hat suddenly, and began twisting the brim in his hands. \"You understand, don't you?\"  The trace of a smile appeared on her face. \"I think I do,\" she said.  \"Now,\" Malone said, \"you're Miss Thompson, but not really, because you have to use a pseudonym.\" He blinked at the little old lady. \"Why?\"  \"Well,\" she said, \"otherwise people would find out about my little secret.\"  \"Your little secret,\" Malone said.  \"That's right,\" the little old lady said. \"I'm immortal, you see.\"  Malone said: \"Oh.\" Then he kept quiet for a long time. It didn't seem to him that anyone in the room was breathing.  He said: \"Oh,\" again, but it didn't sound any better than it had the first time. He tried another phrase. \"You're immortal,\" he said.  \"That's right,\" the little old lady agreed sweetly.  There was only one other question to ask, and Malone set his teeth grimly and asked it. It came out just a trifle indistinct, but the little old lady nodded.  \"My real name?\" she said. \"Elizabeth. Elizabeth Tudor, of course. I used to be Queen.\"  \"Of England,\" Malone said faintly.  \"Malone, look--\" Boyd began.  \"Let me get it all at once,\" Malone told him. \"I'm strong. I can take it.\" He twisted his hat again and turned back to the little old lady.  \"You're immortal, and you're not really Miss Thompson, but Queen Elizabeth I?\" he said slowly.  \"That's right,\" she said. \"How clever of you. Of course, after little Jimmy--cousin Mary's boy, I mean--said I was dead and claimed the Throne, I decided to change my name and all. And that's what I did. But I am Elizabeth Regina.\" She smiled, and her eyes twinkled merrily. Malone stared at her for a long minute.  _Burris_, he thought, _is going to love this_.  \"Oh, I'm so glad,\" the little old lady said. \"Do you really think he will? Because I'm sure I'll like your Mr. Burris, too. All of you FBI men are so charming. Just like poor, poor Essex.\"  Well, Malone told himself, that was that. He'd found himself a telepath.  And she wasn't an imbecile.  Oh, no. That would have been simple.  Instead, she was battier than a cathedral spire.         *       *       *       *       *  The long silence was broken by the voice of Miss Wilson.  \"Mr. Malone,\" she said, \"you've been thinking.\" She stopped. \"I mean, you've been so quiet.\"  \"I like being quiet,\" Malone said patiently. \"Besides--\" He stopped and turned to the little old lady. _Can you really read my mind?_ he thought deliberately. After a second he added: _... your majesty?_  \"How sweet of you, Mr. Malone,\" she said. \"Nobody's called me that for centuries. But of course I can. Although it's not reading, really. After all, that would be like asking if I can read your voice. Of course I can, Mr. Malone.\"  \"That does it,\" Malone said. \"I'm not a hard man to convince. And when I see the truth, I'm the first one to admit it, even if it makes me look like a nut.\" He turned back to the little old lady. \"Begging your pardon,\" he said.  \"Oh, my,\" the little old lady said. \"I really don't mind at all. Sticks and stones, you know, can break my bones. But being called nuts, Mr. Malone, can never hurt me. After all, it's been so many years--so many hundreds of years--\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said easily.  Boyd broke in. \"Listen, Malone,\" he said, \"do you mind telling me what is going on?\"  \"It's very simple,\" Malone said. \"Miss Thompson here ... pardon me; I mean Queen Elizabeth I ... really is a telepath. That's all. I think I want to lie down somewhere until it goes away.\"  \"Until what goes away?\" Miss Wilson said.  Malone stared at her almost without seeing her, if not quite. \"Everything,\" he said. He closed his eyes.  \"My goodness,\" the little old lady said after a second. \"Everything's so confused. Poor Mr. Malone is terribly shaken up by everything.\" She stood up, still holding her knitting, and went across the room. Before the astonished eyes of the doctor and nurse, and Tom Boyd, she patted the FBI agent on the shoulder. \"There, there, Mr. Malone,\" she said. \"It will all be perfectly all right. You'll see.\" Then she returned to her seat.  Malone opened his eyes. He turned to Dr. Harman. \"You called up Boyd here,\" he said, \"and told him that ... er ... Miss Thompson was a telepath. Howd' you know?\"  \"It's all right,\" the little old lady put in from her chair. \"I don't mind your calling me Miss Thompson, not right now, anyhow.\"  \"Thanks,\" Malone said faintly.  Dr. Harman was blinking in a kind of befuddled astonishment. \"You mean she really _is_ a--\" He stopped and brought his tenor voice to a squeaking halt, regained his professional poise, and began again. \"I'd rather not discuss the patient in her presence, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"If you'll just come into my office--\"  \"Oh, _bosh_, Dr. Harman,\" the little old lady said primly. \"I do wish you'd give your own Queen credit for some ability. Goodness knows you think _you're_ smart enough.\"  \"Now, now, Miss Thompson,\" he said in what was obviously his best Grade A Choice Government Inspected couchside manner. \"Don't....\"  \"... Upset yourself,\" she finished for him. \"Now, really, doctor. I know what you're going to tell them.\"  \"But Miss Thompson, I--\"  \"You didn't honestly think I _was_ a telepath,\" the little old lady said. \"Heavens, we know that. And you're going to tell them how I used to say I could read minds ... oh, years and years ago. And because of that you thought it might be worth while to tell the FBI about me--which wasn't very kind of you, doctor, before you knew anything about why they wanted somebody like me.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Now, now, Miss Thompson,\" Miss Wilson said, walking across the room to put an arm around the little old lady's shoulder. Malone wished for one brief second that he were the old little old lady. Maybe if he were a patient in the hospital he would get the same treatment.  He wondered if he could possibly work such a deal.  Then he wondered if it would be worth while, being nuts. But of course it would. He was nuts anyhow, wasn't he?  Sure, he told himself. They were all nuts.  \"Nobody's going to hurt you,\" Miss Wilson said. She was talking to the old lady. \"You'll be perfectly all right and you don't have to worry about a thing.\"  \"Oh, yes, dear, I know that,\" the little old lady said. \"You only want to help me, dear. You're so kind. And these FBI men really don't mean any harm. But Dr. Harman didn't know that. He just thinks I'm crazy and that's all.\"  \"Please, Miss Thompson--\" Dr. Harman began.  \"Just crazy, that's all,\" the little old lady said. She turned away for a second and nobody said anything. Then she turned back. \"Do you all know what he's thinking now?\" she said. Dr. Harman turned a dull purple, but she ignored him. \"He's wondering why I didn't take the trouble to prove all this to you years ago. And besides that, he's thinking about--\"  [Illustration]  \"Miss Thompson,\" Dr. Harman said. His bedside manner had cracked through and his voice was harsh and strained. \"Please.\"  \"Oh, all right,\" she said, a little petulantly. \"If you want to keep all that private.\"  Malone broke in suddenly, fascinated. \"Why didn't you prove you were telepathic before now?\" he said.  The little old lady smiled at him. \"Why, because you wouldn't have believed me,\" she said. She dropped her knitting neatly in her lap and folded her hands over it. \"None of you _wanted_ to believe me,\" she said, and sniffed. Miss Wilson moved nervously and she looked up. \"And don't tell me it's going to be all right. I know it's going to be all right. I'm going to make sure of that.\"  Malone felt a sudden chill. But it was obvious, he told himself, that the little old lady didn't mean what she was saying. She smiled at him again, and her smile was as sweet and guileless as the smile on the face of his very own sainted grandmother.  Not that Malone remembered his grandmother; she had died before he'd been born. But if he'd had a grandmother, and if he'd remembered her, he was sure she would have had the same sweet smile.  So she couldn't have meant what she'd said. Would Malone's own grandmother make things difficult for him? The very idea was ridiculous.  Dr. Harman opened his mouth, apparently changed his mind, and shut it again. The little old lady turned to him.  \"Were you going to ask why I bothered to prove anything to Mr. Malone?\" she said. \"Of course you were, and I shall tell you. It's because Mr. Malone _wanted_ to believe me. He _wants_ me. He _needs_ me. I'm a telepath, and that's enough for Mr. Malone. Isn't it?\"  \"Gur,\" Malone said, taken by surprise. After a second he added: \"I guess so.\"  \"You see, doctor?\" the little old lady said.  \"But you--\" Dr. Harman began.  \"I read minds,\" the little old lady said. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23657"],["title","That Sweet Little Old Lady (#7)"],["body","\"That's right, doctor. That's what makes me a telepath.\"  Malone's brain was whirling rapidly, like a distant galaxy. \"Telepath\" was a nice word, he thought. How did you telepath from a road?  Simple.  A road is paved.  Malone thought that was pretty funny, but he didn't laugh. He thought he would never laugh again. He wanted to cry, a little, but he didn't think he'd be able to manage that either.  He twisted his hat, but it didn't make him feel any better. Gradually, he became aware that the little old lady was talking to Dr. Harman again.  \"But,\" she said, \"since it will make you feel so much better, doctor, we give you our Royal permission to retire, and to speak to Mr. Malone alone.\"  \"Malone alone,\" Dr. Harman muttered. \"Hm-m-m. My. Well.\" He turned and seemed to be surprised that Malone was actually standing near him. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Well. Mr. Alone ... Malone ... please, whoever you are, just come into my office, please?\"  Malone looked at the little old lady. One of her eyes closed and opened. It was an unmistakable wink.  Malone grinned at her in what he hoped was a cheerful manner. \"All right,\" he said to the psychiatrist, \"let's go.\" He turned with the barest trace of regret, and Boyd followed him. Leaving the little old lady and, unfortunately, the startling Miss Wilson, behind, the procession filed back into Dr. Harman's office.         *       *       *       *       *  The doctor closed the door, and leaned against it for a second. He looked as though someone had suddenly revealed to him that the world was square. But when he spoke his voice was almost even.  \"Sit down, gentlemen,\" he said, and indicated chairs. \"I really ... well, I don't know what to say. All this time, all these years, she's been reading my mind! My mind. She's been reading ... looking right into my mind, or whatever it is.\"  \"Whatever what is?\" Malone asked, sincerely interested. He had dropped gratefully into a chair near Boyd's, across the desk from Dr. Harman.  \"Whatever my _mind_ is,\" Dr. Harman said. \"Reading it. Oh, my.\"  \"Dr. Harman,\" Malone began, but the psychiatrist gave him a bright blank stare.  \"Don't you understand?\" he said. \"She's a telepath.\"  \"We--\"  The phone on Dr. Harman's desk chimed gently. He glanced at it and said: \"Excuse me. The phone.\" He picked up the receiver and said: \"Hello?\"  There was no image on the screen.  But the voice was image enough. \"This is Andrew J. Burris,\" it said. \"Is Kenneth J. Malone there?\"  \"Mr. Malone?\" the psychiatrist said. \"I mean, Mr. Burris? Mr. Malone is here. Yes. Oh, my. Do you want to talk to him?\"  \"No, you idiot,\" the voice said. \"I just want to know if he's all tucked in.\"  \"Tucked in?\" Dr. Harman gave the phone a sudden smile. \"A joke,\" he said. \"It _is_ a joke, isn't it? The way things have been happening, you never know whether--\"  \"A joke,\" Burris' voice said. \"That's right. Yes. Am I talking to one of the patients?\"  Dr. Harman gulped, got mad, and thought better of it. At last he said, very gently: \"I'm not at all sure,\" and handed the phone to Malone.  The FBI agent said: \"Hello, chief. Things are a little confused.\"  Burris' face appeared on the screen. \"Confused, sure,\" he said. \"I feel confused already.\" He took a breath. \"I called the San Francisco office, and they told me you and Boyd were out there. What's going on?\"  Malone said cautiously: \"We've found a telepath.\"  Burris' eyes widened slightly. \"Another one?\"  \"What are you talking about, another one?\" Malone said. \"We have one. Does anybody else have any more?\"  \"Well,\" Burris said, \"we just got a report on another one--maybe. Besides yours, I mean.\"  \"I hope the one you've got is in better shape than the one I've got,\" Malone said. He took a deep breath, and then spat it all out at once: \"The one we've found is a little old lady. She thinks she's Queen Elizabeth I. She's a telepath, sure, but she's nuts.\"  \"Queen Elizabeth?\" Burris said. \"Of England?\"  \"That's right,\" Malone said. He held his breath.  \"Damn it,\" Burris exploded, \"they've already got one.\"  Malone sighed. \"This is another one,\" he said. \"Or, rather, the original one. She also claims she's immortal.\"  \"Lives forever?\" Burris said. \"You mean like that?\"  \"Immortal,\" Malone said. \"Right.\"  Burris nodded. Then he looked worried. \"Tell me, Malone,\" he said. \"She _isn't_, is she?\"  \"Isn't immortal, you mean?\" Malone said. Burris nodded. Malone said confidently: \"Of course not.\"  There was a little pause. Malone thought things over.  Hell, maybe she was immortal. Stranger things had happened, hadn't they?  He looked over at Dr. Harman. \"How about that?\" he said. \"Could she be immortal?\"  The psychiatrist shook his head decisively. \"She's been here for over forty years, Mr. Malone, ever since her late teens. Her records show all that, and her birth certificate is in perfect order. Not a chance.\"  Malone sighed and turned back to the phone. \"Of course she isn't immortal, chief,\" he said. \"She couldn't be. Nobody is. Just a nut.\"  \"I was afraid of that,\" Burris said.  \"Afraid?\" Malone said.  Burris nodded. \"We've got another one--if he checks out,\" he said. \"Right here in Washington--St. Elizabeths.\"  \"Another nut?\"  \"Strait-jacket case,\" Burris said. \"Delusions of persecution. Paranoia. And a lot of other things I can't pronounce. But I'm sending him on out to Yucca Flats anyhow, under guard. You might find a use for him.\"  \"Oh, sure,\" Malone said.  \"We can't afford to overlook a thing,\" Burris said.  Malone sighed. \"I know,\" he said. \"But all the same--\"  \"Don't worry about a thing, Malone,\" Burris said with a palpably false air of confidence. \"You get this Queen Elizabeth of yours out of there and take her to Yucca Flats, too.\"  Malone considered the possibilities. Maybe they would find more telepaths. Maybe all the telepaths would be nuts. It didn't seem unlikely. Imagine having a talent that nobody would believe you had. It might very easily drive you crazy to be faced with a situation like that.  And there they would be in Yucca Flats. Kenneth J. Malone, and a convention of looney-bin inhabitants.  Fun!  Malone began to wonder why he had gone into FBI work in the first place.  \"Listen, chief,\" he said. \"I--\"  \"Sure, I understand,\" Burris said quickly. \"She's batty. But what else can we do? Malone, don't do anything you'll regret.\"  \"What?\"  \"I mean, don't resign.\"  \"Chief, how did you know--you're not telepathic too, are you?\"  \"Of course not,\" Burris said. \"But that's what I would do in your place. And don't do it.\"  \"Look, chief,\" Malone said. \"These nuts--\"  \"Malone, you've done a wonderful job so far,\" Burris said. \"You'll get a raise and a better job when all this is over. Who else would have thought of looking in the twitch-bins for telepaths? But you did, Malone, and I'm proud of you, and you're stuck with it. We've got to use them now. We have to find that spy!\" He took a breath. \"On to Yucca Flats!\" he said.  Malone gave up. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. \"Anything else?\"  \"Not right now,\" Burris said. \"If there is, I'll let you know.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Malone hung up unhappily as the image vanished. He looked at Dr. Harman. \"Well,\" he said, \"that's that. What do I have to do to get a release for Miss Thompson?\"  Harman stared at him. \"But, Mr. Malone,\" he said, \"that just isn't possible. Really. Miss Thompson is a ward of the state, and we couldn't possibly allow her release without a court order.\"  Malone thought that over. \"O.K.,\" he said at last. \"I can see that.\" He turned to Boyd. \"Here's a job for you, Tom,\" he said. \"Get one of the judges on the phone. You'll know which one will do us the most good, fastest.\"  \"Hm-m-m,\" Boyd said. \"Say Judge Dunning,\" he said. \"Good man. Fast worker.\"  \"I don't care who,\" Malone said. \"Just get going, and get us a release for Miss Thompson.\" He turned back to the doctor. \"By the way,\" he said, \"has she got any other name? Besides Elizabeth Tudor, I mean,\" he added hurriedly.  \"Her full name,\" Dr. Harman said, \"is Rose Walker Thompson. She is not Queen Elizabeth I, II, or XXVIII, and she is not immortal.\"  \"But she is,\" Malone pointed out, \"a telepath. And that's why I want her.\"  \"She may,\" Dr. Harman said, \"be a telepath.\" It was obvious that he had partly managed to forget the disturbing incidents that had happened a few minutes before. \"I don't even want to discuss that part of it.\"  \"O.K., never mind it,\" Malone said agreeably. \"Tom, get us a court order for Rose Walker Thompson. Effective yesterday--day before, if possible.\"  Boyd nodded, but before he could get to the phone Dr. Harman spoke again.  \"Now, wait a moment, gentlemen,\" he said. \"Court order or no court order, Miss Thompson is definitely not a well woman, and I can't see my way clear to--\"  \"I'm not well myself,\" Malone said. \"I need sleep and I probably have a cold. But I've got to work for the national security, and--\"  \"This is important,\" Boyd put in.  \"I don't dispute that,\" Dr. Harman said. \"Nevertheless, I--\"  The door that led into the other room suddenly burst open. The three men turned to stare at Miss Wilson, who stood in the doorway for a long second and then stepped into the office, closing the door quietly behind her.  \"I'm sorry to interrupt,\" she said.  \"Not at all,\" Malone said. \"It's a pleasure to have you. Come again soon.\" He smiled at her.  She didn't smile back. \"Doctor,\" she said, \"you better talk to Miss Thompson. I'm not at all sure what I can do. It's something new.\"  \"New?\" he said. The worry lines on his face were increasing, but he spoke softly.  \"The poor dear thinks she's going to get out of the hospital now,\" Miss Wilson said. \"For some reason, she's convinced that the FBI is going to get her released, and--\"  As she saw the expressions on three faces, she stopped.  \"What's wrong?\" she said.  \"Miss Wilson,\" Malone said, \"we ... may I call you by your first name?\"  \"Of course, Mr. Malone,\" she said.  There was a little silence.  \"Miss Wilson,\" Malone said, \"what"]]]
